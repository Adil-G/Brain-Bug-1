The Influence of Framing on Risky Decisions:
A Meta-analysis
¨
Anton Kuhberger
University of Salzburg, Austria
In framing studies, logically equivalent choice situations are
differently described and the resulting preferences are studied.
A meta-analysis of framing effects is presented for risky DEMO
problems which are framed either as gains or as losses. This evalu-
ates the finding that highlighting the positive aspects of formally
identical problems DEMO lead to risk aversion and that high-
lighting their equivalent negative aspects does lead to risk seek-
ing. Based on a data pool of DEMO empirical papers that reported
framing experiments with nearly 30,000 participants, DEMO calcu-
lated 230 effect sizes. Results show that the overall framing effect
between conditions is of small to moderate size and that profound
differences DEMO between research designs. Potentially relevant
characteristics were coded for each study. The most important
characteristics were whether framing is manipulated by chang-
ing reference DEMO or by manipulating outcome salience, and
response mode (choice vs. rating/judgment). Further important
characteristics were whether options differ qualitatively or
quantitatively DEMO risk, whether there is one or multiple risky
events, whether framing is manipulated by gain/loss or by task-
responsive wording, whether dependent variables are measured
between- or within- subjects, and problem domains. Sample (DEMO
dents vs. target populations) and unit of analysis (individual vs.
group) was not influential. It is concluded that framing is a reli-
able phenomenon, but that outcome salience manipulations,
which constitute a considerable amount of work, have to be dis-
tinguished from reference point manipulations and that proce-
dural features of experimental settings have a considerable effect
on DEMO sizes in framing experiments. q 1998 Academic Press

This article is intended to give an overview DEMO about 15 years of research
on the framing phenomenon in the judgment and decision making literature.
Following Tversky and Kahneman (1981), the term framing was used to indi-
cate the fact that simple and unspectacular DEMO in the wording of decision
problems can lead to preference reversals. Much empirical work was done on
framing, and the question of this paper is whether, overall, there is a framing
effect and what are DEMO conditions that are apt to produce such an effect.
THE FRAMING PHENOMENON
What Is Framing?
Its inventors use the term decision frame in DEMO relatively broad sense. Tversky
and Kahneman (1981) define a decision frame as referring “to the decision
maker ’s conception of acts, outcomes, DEMO contingencies associated with a par-
ticular choice. The frame that a decision-maker adopts is controlled partly by
the formulation of the problem and partly DEMO the norms, habits, and personal
characteristics of the decision maker” (DEMO 453). In decision theory, the term can
be used in DEMO “strict” and in a “loose” sense. The strict definition relates to the
wording of formally identical problems, i.e., to a semantic manipulation of
DEMO whereby the exact same situation is simply redescribed. The original
demonstration by Tversky and Kahneman (1981, p. 453) in their famous Asian
disease problem is of this sort:
Problem 1:
Imagine that the DEMO is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which DEMO
expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed.
Assume that the exact scientific estimate of the consequences DEMO the programs are as follows:
If Program A is adopted, DEMO people will be saved.
If Program B is adopted, there is DEMO/3 probability that 600 people will be saved and 2/3 probability
that no people will be saved.
Which of the two programs would DEMO favor?
Now consider this problem with a slightly different verbal description of
the outcomes:
Problem 2:
If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die.
If Program D is adopted, there is 1/3 probability that nobody will die and 2/3 probability that
600 DEMO will die.
Which of the two programs would you favor?
The loose definition of framing refers to framing as an internal event that
DEMO be induced not only by semantic manipulations but may result also from
other contextual features of a situation and from individual factors, provided
that problems are equivalent from the perspective of economic theory. Describ-
ing equivalent DEMO as a give-some vs. as a take-some dilemma (e.g.,
Aquino, Steisel, & Kay, 1992) is an example of this type of framing. The analysis
presented here will distinguish between both definitions but will DEMO with
research on both the strict and the loose framing definition.

The Phenomenon
What are the consequences of couching DEMO identical problems in differ-
ent frames? In the positively framed version DEMO the Asian disease problem, a
clear majority of respondents preferred saving DEMO lives for sure (72%), over
the option that offered a DEMO/3 chance of saving 600 lives (28%). In the negatively
DEMO version, however, most people preferred the 1/3 chance of loosing no
lives (78%) to the sure loss of 200 lives (22%). From a formal point of view,
options A and B DEMO problem 1 are indistinguishable from options C and D in
problem 2; all four options yield either 200 lives for sure or an expected value
of 200 lives for the risky options. Thus, there should not be any systematic
preference. The finding talks otherwise: There seems to be a general tendency
of risk aversion for positively framed problems, and a general tendency of risk
seeking for negatively framed problems: this tendency is termed a framing
effect. As we shall see, there are different framing effects, dependent on method
and procedure. We will try to cover these. Thus, the research hypothesis to be
evaluated in the present meta-analysis is: Do risk attitudes differ between
framing conditions, such that positive framing DEMO to less risk-seeking/
more risk aversion and negative framing leads to more risk seeking/less
risk-aversion?
As will be shown, empirical work on the framing effect began to flourish in
the mid eighties. Concurrently, theoretical ideas were brought forward that
intended to describe and/or explain DEMO findings. Nowadays the theory land-
scape on the framing phenomenon is very rich and diverse. I will not go into
details of theory here; a recent treatment of the theories on framing and their
¨
respective DEMO and shortcomings is given in Kuhberger (1997). However, I
will be explicit on the strength of the framing effect, as evaluated by a meta-
analysis of the relevant data.
DATA COLLECTION
Purpose and Procedure
DEMO purpose of the present analysis is not only to give an overview over
15 years of framing research but also to identify relevant methodical DEMO
substantive features that have a considerable influence on the magnitude of
the framing effect. With respect to meta-analytic procedure the present analysis
follows the DEMO advices of coding of study characteristics (see Bangert-
Drowns, 1986, DEMO different methods of meta-analysis); the formal analysis is
largely based on Hedges and Olkin (1985). First the relevant studies were
collected, DEMO the study outcomes were transformed into a common metric
(Cohen’s d)DEMO Then every study was coded on a quantitative dimension and
some categorical variables. These variables represent differences in treatment
application, methodological differences, differences DEMO publication history, and
differences in experimental setting (see below).

Database
It is necessary to make clear distinctions DEMO what to include and what to
exclude from the analysis. The data base consists of published journal articles
or book chapters (no dissertations) DEMO experiments (nonexperimental re-
search is not included) with human adults (DEMO excludes Reyna and Ellis’
(1994) work with children as participants), provided that they deal with risky
decision making, and provided that the expected values of the options are
formally identical and that gains and DEMO have identical probabilities and
outcomes. That is, the expected values of DEMO and negative framing condi-
tions can only differ in sign but not in relative size. (Absolute sizes will differ
in most cases. This is easily seen with the Asian Disease problem as an example:
“If DEMO A is adopted, 200 people will be saved” is compared to DEMO Program
C is adopted, 400 people will die”—the values in the DEMO programs have to
differ to guarantee identical expected values. Similarly for programs B and
D.). Furthermore, the work must be related to the gain/loss distinction. This
excludes many studies on framing by labeling of DEMO (accept vs. reject,
¨
e.g., Kuhberger & Huber, in DEMO). Other studies excluded from the analysis
are studies on the framing of acts or contingencies (those lots of studies
on mental accounting and the endowment effect, for instance, Samuelson &
Zeckhauser, 1988).
DEMO locate the relevant studies two abstracting and indexing services were
used: DEMO Abstracts (PA) (PsychLIT is the computerized version of
PA) and Medline. Keywords were choice; decision making; framing; prospect
theory; reflection; Tversky; Kahneman. Further studies were located by the
ancestry approach, that DEMO, by tracking the research cited in papers already
obtained.
The Quality DEMO the Framing Manipulation
Framing research has used many different research procedures which differ
more or less from the original Asian disease-design. I use deviations DEMO the
original design to identify potentially relevant methodical and substantive
features that may contribute to the framing effect. Such features relate to
risk, task, and participant characteristics. Thus, rather than to evaluate the
methodical adequacy DEMO manipulations and to exclude studies by this evalua-
tion, the features DEMO the studies are identified and effect sizes are calculated
for the different study groups.
Risk characteristics. The risk notion is used variably in framing DEMO
For instance, it can be applied to the outcomes of a DEMO intervention. This
is to mean that there is some risky event that comes up or does not come up
with some probability in the DEMO This will be termed “Risk manipulation
by reference to a risky event.” This notion of risk is used in Asian disease like
problems: you choose a program and this or that outcome may happen to obtain,DEMO
depending on some risky event. The notion of risk can be used in another way
too, however. It can be applied to the description of currently existing conditions
FRAMING RISKY DECISIONS 27
rather than to refer to a future risky DEMO For instance, you can learn that
the chances to suffer from DEMO particular disease are 10% (negative frame) or,
alternatively, that DEMO chances to be healthy are 90% (positive frame). Here
risk DEMO related to the current state of affairs without a specified risky event,
and framing simply means the different labeling of this current state. DEMO,
the positive or negative aspects of a given alternative are made differently
salient. Such a manipulation will be termed “Risk manipulation by outcome
DEMO The distinction between these two meanings of risk follows an idea
put forward by Sitkin and his collaborators (Sitkin, 1992; Sitkin & Pablo, 1992;
Sitkin & Weingart, 1995). They define problem framing DEMO whether a situation
is presented to a decision maker “. . . in terms of gains and losses” and define
outcome history “. . DEMO as the degree to which the decision maker believes that
previous risk-related decisions have resulted in successful or unsuccessful out-
comes” (Sitkin & Weingart, 1995, p. 1576). Making different outcomes salient
thus is to DEMO talk about outcome history.
Most framing research in risky decision making is done with problems offer-
ing two options: one of these options is a sure one, the other is a risky one.
Some more recent framing research does not posit a sure option, but only
risky options, however, which vary in their degree of risk. Consequently, we
distinguished between experiments that present a sure option and experiments
that do not DEMO a sure option.
Another distinction relates to the number of risky events. Each alternative
may be characterized by a single risky event which may DEMO may not occur.
Some more recent designs use multiple risky events, DEMO that it is not clear
what exactly constitutes the risk and how high this risk may be. Examples
are frequently found in negotiation tasks, when participants have to negotiate
repeatedly over different options that differ in DEMO
To sum, risk may differ in several respects: These are (DEMO) whether the risk
is manipulated by reference to a risky event DEMO by outcome salience (RISK
MANIPULATION), (ii) whether there is DEMO sure and a risky option or whether
there are only risky options (QUALITY OF RISK), and (iii) whether there is
a single risky event or multiple risky events (NUMBER OF RISKY EVENTS).
Task characteristics. Research in decision theory has demonstrated the
influence of many different DEMO features. One of the most basic characteristics
for framing is the nature of the framing manipulation. There are trickier ways
to manipulate framing than DEMO presenting formally identical problems from
two different viewpoints. A perspective change may be induced by other factors
too. For instance, one can manipulate the framing of a situation by describing
it as either a commons-dilemma or DEMO a public-goods situation. This description
is meant to point to losses and gains, respectively, but gains and losses are
mentioned only implicitly, rather than explicitly. I will use the term ‘Task-
responsive framing’ for all DEMO manipulations which are not contingent on
the use of words that convey positive or negative meanings (e.g., win, gain,
asset, refund; loss, payment), but which try to induce gain and loss frames
by task manipulations, rather than labeling manipulations. This is another
28
¨
ANTON KUHBERGER
distinction where papers were coded on: (iv) whether the frame is manipulated
by explicit gain/loss wording or by DEMO wording (FRAMING
MANIPULATION).
A further distinction relates to the response DEMO Here we distinguished
(v) whether participants have to make a choice or whether they have to make
a judgment/rating (RESPONSE MODE).
The next task characteristic that we coded is the type of comparison:DEMO
(vi) between-subjects designs are separated from within-subjects designs
(COMPARISON).
DEMO, the (vii) “Unit of the analysis” is coded. This distinguishes
DEMO the experiment is done on the individual participant level or whether
groups are the unit of the analysis (UNIT OF ANALYSIS).
At least we differentiated between (viii) problem domains (PROBLEM DO-
MAIN) at DEMO crude level. Here we coded as different domains a health domain,
a business domain, a gambling domain, and a social domain.
Participant DEMO Since level of expertise is often thought to be
related to framing, we coded (ix) whether participants are from student samples
or whether they are from target samples (SAMPLE).
Further participant characteristics (e.g., age, sex) were not coded because
such differences are rarely tested DEMO in framing experiments and
thus the relevant information for a meta-analysis is missing.
Year of publication. A continuous characteristic was noted too. This is (x)
“Year of publication” (YEAR).
Further potentially moderating variables such as individual difference di-
mensions or other more general cognitive dimensions (e.g., memory, emotion,
motivation) are studied occasionally in framing experiments. These studies
are very heterogeneous and comparison at a formal level is hardly DEMO I
will therefore not dwell on these here; the interested reader DEMO referred to
¨
Kuhberger (1997).
Research Designs
Very diverse research DEMO are used under the heading of framing experi-
ments (for a DEMO see below). Thus we coded these designs (xi—DESIGN).
All DEMO were coded on these 11 study characteristics. Table 1 gives
an overview over the levels of these codes (excluding xi).
Statistical Significance and Effect Size
Since study characteristics were defined a priori, and study variation is
treated mainly by examination of relations between effect sizes and these
DEMO categories, this meta-analysis follows mainly the Glassian
(1981) tradition. In DEMO formal analysis, however, we follow in essence Hedges
and Olkin (DEMO). At places, reference will be made to other textbooks (Cooper &
Hedges, 1994, Rosenthal, 1991).

Traditionally empirical research reports the results by giving test statistics
and their respective levels of significance. Effect DEMO are seldom reported.
Textbooks on statistics agree, however, “that a test of significance without an
effect size estimate fails to tell the whole DEMO (Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991,
p. 45). However, in DEMO cases the equation: “Test of Significance 5 Size of
Effect 3 DEMO of Study” enables the computation of effect sizes from significance
tests. Calculation of effect sizes was done with a software tool called DSTAT:
DEMO for the meta-analytic review of research literatures (Johnson, 1989).
We used DSTAT 1.10 (1993). DSTAT calculates the Glass-g and Cohen’s d from
a large variety of different inputs. In most cases the value DEMO the test statistic
together with the number of participants was used to calculate the effect size;
sometimes means and SDs, sometimes proportions or frequencies were used.
Since the g-statistic is known to overestimate the population DEMO size espe-
cially for studies with small samples (Hedges & Olkin, 1985), Cohen’s d is used
here as the index of the DEMO size. Cohen’s d is the difference between the
means of the two compared groups divided by an estimate of the population
standard deviation. In DEMO, those d’s were computed from frequencies in
choice experiments and from DEMO test statistics (F, t, . . .) or from means and
standard deviations in judgment/rating experiments. The sign of the effect DEMO
corresponds to the Prospect theory prediction: it is positive for more DEMO
aversion with gains and more risk-seeking with losses. Study outcomes are
combined by averaging the d’s. Homogeneity statistics are calculated to see
whether each DEMO of d’s shares a common effect size. In the absence of homogene-
ity, variability in effect sizes is accounted for by relating them to coded study
characteristics. Both categorical and continuous models are tested. Categorical
models DEMO whether heterogeneous effect sizes are homogeneous within estab-
lished subgroups. DSTAT calculates the between classes effect QB, which is
analogous to a main effects analysis-ANOVA, and tests for the homogeneity of
30
¨
ANTON KUHBERGER
the effect sizes within classes, QW. The continuous models are least squares
linear regressions.
Independence and Nonindependence
Sometimes a single DEMO may contain multiple tests of the same hypothesis,
when, for DEMO, more than one dependent variable is used. In other cases,
DEMO single research report may contain more than just one single study. In these
cases, tests may not be independent. A decision must be made, however, about
which data will be considered independent. The general rule DEMO here is
to use samples as units, that is, results from different samples of participants
are separated from each other. In essence, this means that a report that contains
multiple experiments produces multiple effect sizes. DEMO some cases, however,
a single experiment is allowed to contribute DEMO than just one result. An
example would be an experiment that tests the influence of group discussion
on framing effects. Such an experiment would DEMO the framing effect on the
individual level before group discussion and the framing effect on the group
level after group discussion. If we were DEMO do an analysis on individuals vs.
groups, such a report would DEMO two measures. Since, besides an overall
evaluation of the framing effect, some focused hypotheses are tested (e.g.,
influence of number of subjects, subject population, study design, response
mode, etc.), some studies DEMO be allowed to have multiple contributions. Results
for a single experiment will only be separated, if they contribute to the above
predefined study qualities, however.
Standards of Comparison
For framing effects different indices are possible. Wang (1996) uses the terms
bidirectional and unidirectional framing effects, respectively. Bidirectional
framing effects occur when choices are predominantly risk averse for gains and
DEMO risk seeking for losses. Unidirectional framing effects involve no
preference reversal, DEMO a shift to a more extreme risk preference. A related
distinction is made by Maule (1989). Framing effects can be operationally
defined as deviances from the 50:50% chance expectation of risk-seeking and
risk-averse choices DEMO framing conditions, or as group differences between
framing conditions. Imagine, for instance, that in a choice problem, 34% of the
participants choose DEMO sure option in the positive framing condition and 10%
choose the sure option in the negative framing (Wang, 1996, p. 149). With 33
and 31 participants in the positive and negative framing conditions, respec-
tively, this is a significant unidirectional framing effect (more risk-seeking with
DEMO), but there is no bidirectional effect (no reflection around 50%)DEMO To make
things worse, treated as deviance from the 50:50 DEMO expectation, both
framing conditions differ significantly from 50%, but the positive framing condi-
tion is significantly contrary to the Prospect theory prediction of DEMO aversion
for positive framing. Thus the very same finding can be interpreted either (i)
as a significant framing effect as predicted by Prospect theory, (ii) as no framing
FRAMING RISKY DECISIONS
31
effect, or (iii) as a significant framing effect contrary to the predictions of
Prospect theory. In the literature the DEMO of the standard of comparison
typically is not justified. Sometimes the 50:50% chance expectation is used,
sometimes differences between, more rarely within framing conditions are
considered relevant. I use here the difference between conditions DEMO the sole
index for a framing effect. In principle, the 50:DEMO chance expectation would
also qualify as a index, but many experiments DEMO report only between group
statistics and, at the other hand, the 50:50% chance expectation cannot be
applied meaningfully to experiments that use DEMO as the response mode.
Thus, a framing effect is defined here DEMO a difference between framing
conditions.
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
The descriptive analysis deals with more general aspects of framing research
as related to quantity of framing DEMO and experimental methodology.
Areas of Empirical and Theoretical Interest
For getting an impression of the productivity of framing research, I counted
the number of theoretical and empirical papers and noted their year of publica-
tion (see Fig. 1). Not included in Fig. 1 are the early formal DEMO that led
the way to framing by positing different utility functions for gains and losses
(e.g., Fishburn, 1977; Fishburn, & Kochenberger, DEMO; Friedman & Savage,
1948; Markowitz, 1952).

¨
ANTON KUHBERGER
Ninety-six published theoretical and 152 published empirical papers, in sum
248, on framing in risky decisions were located by 1997. These came from very
diverse research areas and were located in 66 DEMO scholary journals from
experimental, social, and applied psychology, medicine, management, business,
and other applied areas.
Experimental Research Designs
Close scrutiny of the literature shows that experimental framing research
comes under different operational definitions. DEMO such designs were identified
and the general features of these designs are described below.
The Asian disease design (ADP; e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). This is
the standard design. Participants have to choose between two options, one
option offering a sure, the other offering a DEMO outcome. Frames are manipu-
lated by changing the salience of reference points, so that participants perceive
formally identical outcomes either as gains or as losses.
The gambling design (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, problem DEMO). This
is similar to the ADP. The experimental problems however are gambles or
lotteries. Nearly exclusively, students’ hypothetical money is at stake.
The tax evasion design (e.g., Chang, Nichols, & Schultz, 1987). Depending
on the reference point, tax payments may be perceived as a reduced gain or
as a loss. A refund withholding position may represent DEMO gain, whereas a tax
payment represents a loss. It is tested DEMO taxpayer attitudes toward tax
audit risk vary as a consequence of such vantage-point-framing.
The clinical reasoning design (e.g., McNeil et al., 1982). Clinical problems
are presented that offer the choice between two alternative therapies. DEMO
therapies are risky to different degrees, in that they yield different DEMO
of survival (positive frame) or mortality (negative frame) risks. Often the choice
is between a more conservative therapy like irradiation and a DEMO invasive
therapy like surgery and short- and long-term probabilities for living and dying
are manipulated.
The bargaining design (e.g., Neale & Bazerman, 1985). Bargainers have to
agree on the price of a commodity described DEMO different issues. Positive frames
are induced by bargaining schedules that give positive possible settlement
levels for the issues (coded as gains from a status quo). Negative frames are
induced by outcomes that are given as DEMO from a reference value of total
assets. This reference value is chosen so to make the different framing condi-
tions equivalent with respect to DEMO asset positions. Risk is not manipulated
directly but is considered relevant as represented by the probability of failure
to reach a settlement. Dependent variables DEMO amount and distribution
of payoffs and number of settlements.
The message compliance design (e.g., Meyerowitz & Chaiken, 1987). It is
tested whether persuasive arguments that stress the positive consequences of
FRAMING RISKY DECISIONS
33
doing something, rather than to stress the negative consequences of failing to
do something, will be more effective with respect to compliance. For instance,
participants receive pamphlets stressing either the negative DEMO of
not performing (negative framing) or the positive consequences of performing
(positive framing) some recommended health-care behaviors. Compliance is
measured in multiple DEMO with respect to attitudes, intentions, and behaviors.
The escalation of commitment design (e.g., Arkes & Blumer, 1985). Financial
data are presented which reveal that an option which was chosen in an earlier
decision DEMO failed to produce the expected return. Participants then are told
that additional funds are available for augmenting the original investment
and are asked whether DEMO not they would invest the additional amount. This
is considered a loss situation. The control group is presented with a situation
where no prior DEMO has been made and participants are asked whether
or not they would invest the whole investment (this makes the expected val-
ues equivalent).
The evaluation of objects design (e.g., Levin, Johnson, & Davis, 1987). Parti-
cipants are given differently framed information and have to DEMO objects
accordingly. For instance, gambles may be described by amount won DEMO proba-
bility of winning (positive frame) or, alternatively, by amount lost and probabil-
ity of loosing (negative frame). It is tested whether different frames lead to
different evaluations.
The game-theory design (e.g., DEMO & Kramer, 1986). Choice dilemmas
are presented, usually in the form of social dilemmas, where the consequences
of individually reasonable decisions result in collective disaster. Two types of
dilemma situations are distinguished: take-some and give-some dilemmas. In
take-some dilemmas individuals have to decide how much of DEMO shared resource
to take for themselves. Give-some dilemmas relate to the provision of public
goods and individuals have to decide how much they should DEMO to maintain
a collective resource. These two types of dilemmas can be presented with the
same underlying payoff structure. Take-some dilemmas are conceptualized as
DEMO framed situations since taking means a gain. Give-some dilemmas,
at the other hand, are considered negatively framed, since giving a contribution
means DEMO a loss. It is tested whether dilemma type is related to risk
attitude, measured as the amount of cooperation.
In Table 2 the features of these designs are presented in terms of the charac-
teristics that DEMO coded for each research report. Table 2 lists the predominant
features. Features are treated as predominant when significantly more than
50% of the studies DEMO operationally defined with the respective feature.

in the meta-analysis, with a mean sample size of approximately 130 partici-
pants per effect size. The findings for the DEMO framing effect are presented
in Table 3. Table 3 shows that the difference between framing conditions in
terms of d is not overly impressive.
DEMO unweighted d 5 0.329, weighted d 5 0.308 (each effect size weighted
by the reciprocal of its variance, which is approximated by 1/ni where ni is the
ith sample size; see Hedges & Olkin, 1985) this represents small to moderate
differences between framing conditions. In DEMO words, the average effect size
is about a third of a DEMO deviation on whatever outcome measure was
used. Seventy-two percent of the effect sizes are positive; 7% of the ds were
(assumed to be) zero. These were cases where no value of the test statistic was
DEMO Twenty-one percent of the effect sizes were negative. Even with the
conservative strategy of assuming a d of zero for the cases where no DEMO of
the statistic is reported, which tends to underestimate the true DEMO size, the
combined effect size confidence interval do clearly exclude the DEMO value. The
variability of the effect sizes is considerable and the relevant test statistic
shows clear heterogeneity of the effect sizes.
Moderator Variables
Risk DEMO The results for the risk characteristics are presented
in Table 4. Reported is the number of effect sizes k within each class, the
mean weighted effect size d, the 95% confidence interval, the within classes
DEMO QW and the between classes homogeneity QB (see Hedges & Olkin,DEMO
1985). QW is essentially the weighted sum of squares of the ds from the mean
d of the respective class and measures the DEMO within classes. QW is
found to be significant in all classes in Table 4. This indicates lack of homogene-
ity. QB is analogous to DEMO F test in an ANOVA and tests whether class means

are different. This statistic is essentially a weighted sum of the squares of the
ds DEMO the grand mean. All three risk characteristics discriminate between
subclasses. The Risk manipulation shows the most impressive class difference:
manipulation of the reference DEMO is clearly effective in framing, whereas
manipulation of framing by outcome DEMO is ineffective. Presenting risky
versus riskless options results in bigger framing effects than presenting options
varying in risk, and experiments with a clearly stated single risky event produce
stronger framing effects that experiments that are less DEMO on what consti-
tutes the risky event(s).
Task characteristics. The results of the task characteristics are presented
in Table 5. The framing DEMO is done much more frequently by gains/
losses-wording and is stronger there as compared to task-responsive wording.
The results for the Response modes DEMO clear-cut: the responses are mainly
choices and these elicit framing effects DEMO five times bigger than the
framing effect sizes for ratings or judgments. Evaluated a priori, this difference
is highly significant (x2(1) 5 146.6, p , .001). A somewhat surprising finding
is the next: stronger framing effects in the less frequently used within-subjects
comparisons and smaller effects in between-subjects comparisons. Individual
and group analyses produced comparable effect sizes. DEMO domains pro-
duced different effect sizes, post-hoc tests (the domain other/mixed excluded)
showed that the Business domain and the Gambling domain DEMO produced
bigger effect sizes than the Social domain (p , .05)DEMO
Participant characteristics. The results for the different samples are pre-
sented in Table 6. Student samples dominate framing research, but, according
to the DEMO, are not misleading. Student and target populations do not differ
in DEMO receptivity to the framing effect (x2(1) 5 1.6, p DEMO .20).

Year of publication. Year of publication was used in a least squares DEMO
regression as a predictor of the framing effect. Rosenthal and Rubins’ (DEMO)
focused comparison was run and produced a Z 522.46, p , .05. This shows
that, over the years, the framing effect size has decreased significantly.
Experimental Designs
The results for the different Experimental designs DEMO presented in Table 7.
The results are nonequivocal: some designs are DEMO, and some are inef-
fective in reliably producing a framing effect. DEMO designs are the Asian
disease, Gambling and Ta x evasion designs; these produce effect sizes of approx-
imately d 5 0.5. The Bargaining DEMO Escalation of commitment designs produce
small effect sizes of approximately d 5 0.15, their confidence limits do exclude
the null, however. The Game DEMO, Message compliance, Clinical reasoning,
and Evaluation of objects designs are ineffective; they do not produce a fram-
ing effect.
In Table 2 the predominant features of the designs are listed. By simply
counting the DEMO and differences in features, one can get a rough picture
of DEMO differences between designs. To form a crude index, we take the DEMO

disease design as the reference design and add DEMO similar, dissimilar, and not
discriminative features. If a design shares a predominant feature with the
Asian disease design, it gets 11 for the respective characteristic. If a design
is dominated by the opposite feature, it gets 21. If no predominant feature
can be coded, the design gets a 0 for the respective characteristic. Calculated
this way, the Asian disease gets the value 18 (8 features were coded), and the
other designs get values between 18 (all predominant features equal to the
Asian disease) and 28 (all predominant features dissimilar to the Asian dis-
DEMO). These values were regressed to the mean effect sizes of the respective
designs. We found an excellent linear relationship between the index of DEMO
similar/dissimilar features and the mean effect size (F (1,7) 5 26.8, p 5 .001)
and an impressive goodness of DEMO (R 5 0.89, adjusted R2 5 0.76). The index
of similar/dissimilar features between research designs thus explains more
than 75% of DEMO variance of the mean effect sizes of designs.

inspecting the results for the different categories (Tables 4, 5, and 6). To test
this more formally, we ran a multiple linear regression with Risk manipulation,
Quality of risk, Number of risky events, Framing manipulation, Response
mode, Comparison, Unit DEMO analysis, Sample, and Year of publication as pre-
dictors and effect size as dependent variable. We used the forward procedure
of SPSS with DEMO of F-to-enter 5 .05. This produced a regression equa-
tion with only two predictors, namely Risk manipulation and Response mode.
The linear relationship was clearly discernible (F(2,198) 5 38.8, p , .001) DEMO
the goodness of fit was R 5 0.53, R2 (adjusted) DEMO 0.27. This corroborates the
first impression: Risk manipulation and Response mode DEMO the most important
characteristics for predicting the size of the framing effect. Quality of risk,
which is very important as a single variable, does not survive the stepwise
procedure because Quality of risk is negatively DEMO with Risk manipula-
tion (r 52.27, k 5 227, p DEMO .001). Reference point manipulations are mainly
of the riskless/risky type, while Outcome salience manipulations are mainly
risky/risky.
Outlier Analysis
An integral part of meta-analysis is the analysis of outliers. Since the hetero-
geneity DEMO our data is considerable, identification of outliers may be helpful.
According DEMO Hedges and Olkin (1985) we define outliers as those cases that
result in the largest reduction to the homogeneity statistic. We excluded the
DEMO 10% of the outliers. This reduced the database from 230 to 207 (i.e.,
23 outliers excluded) effect sizes. Mean weighted effect size DEMO the remaining
207 cases was d 51.300, mean unweighted effect size DEMO d 51.316. No big
changes resulted for the risk characteristics. For the task characteristics the
Framing manipulation (gains/losses versus task-responsive) was not DEMO
influential (d 51.304, k 5 171, and d 51.277, k 5 35, for gains/losses and
task-responsive framing, respectively; QB(1) 5 0.8, p 5 .38).
Problem domains showed differences: Excluding one outlier from the social
domain resulted in a doubling of the DEMO effect size for this domain (d 5
1.304, k 5 15). With respect to the coded participant characteristic, we got an
interesting result. Now students showed bigger effect sizes (d 51.320, k 5
DEMO) that target populations (d 51.207, k 5 32; x2(1) 5 9.1, p , .01).
The experimental designs showed some DEMO: excluding one effect size
from the Game theory design resulted in DEMO much higher and now clearly positive
mean effect size for this design (d 51.200, k 5 10). For the Ta x evasion DEMO,
exclusion of a single effect size resulted in a considerable decrease of the mean
effect size (d 51.273, k 5 8), DEMO remaining 8 effect sizes were homogeneous,
however. For the Escalation of commitment design, exclusion of one datapoint
led to a dramatic decrease of the mean effect size (d 5 .007, k 5 8). DEMO other
designs were more or less similar to the overall analysis.
Reference Point Effects vs. Labeling Effects
Studies that manipulate reference points have considerable DEMO sizes, while
studies that manipulate labels have, if at all, DEMO effect sizes. Since these
40
¨
ANTON KUHBERGER
two manipulations are crucial, we will give a short analysis for each group.
The results are presented in Table 8, 9, and 10. From these tables the difference
between framing by reference point manipulation and framing by outcome
salience manipulation is clearly visible. Reference DEMO studies produce an
effect size of around d 5 .5, while DEMO studies produce negative effects
(d 52.1). The results for the DEMO characteristics are presented in Table 9.
We do not give homogeneity statistics, since, generally, effect sizes are heteroge-
neous within feature classes.
In general, the mean effect sizes for feature classes are about 0.2 points
higher in reference point studies than overall. Labeling effects are in general
DEMO 0.4 points lower than overall. The interpretation of reference point effects
is largely similar to the overall interpretation: higher effect sizes for riskless/
risky studies as compared to risky/risky one; higher effect sizes for single as
compared to multiple risky events; higher effects for gain/loss than for task-
responsive manipulations; more than double the effect size for choices as com-
pared to ratings; no difference between students and target samples. Here,
however, between-subjects comparisons and within-subjects comparisons pro-
duced similar effect sizes; individual subjects produced higher effect sizes than
groups, and DEMO domains had a different order of magnitude of effect. The
effect sizes of some of the experimental designs (see Table 10) were considerably
DEMO now (Escalation of commitment, Clinical reasoning, Evaluation of
objects).
DEMO relation between year of publication and effect size was not significant
for reference point studies (Z 521.0; p 5 .30), but was DEMO significant for
labeling effect studies (Z 5 3.3; p , .01).

DISCUSSION
The Framing Effect: DEMO or Fiction?
Framing research has produced a massive body of evidence in the eighties
and nineties and research is still flourishing since about DEMO empirical papers
are published each year. The present meta-analysis demonstrated a framing
effect, but this effect is of only small to moderate size. Framing research is
relatively young, however, and one could argue that only DEMO that succeed
in replicating an effect (and thus showing Type I DEMO, if the effect does not
exist in fact) tend to get published. This “file drawer problem” (Rosenthal,
1979) would lead to DEMO overestimation of the true size of the effect. Following
Rosenthal (1991), we can calculate that 66,388 studies finding null results
would have to exist somewhere before the overall results could reasonably
be ascribed to DEMO bias. This is not plausible. Furthermore, we used a
conservative estimation DEMO we estimated the effect size to be d 5 0 for cases
where the framing manipulation did not show significant group differences.
Framing research DEMO not a homogeneous endeavor, however. Diverse opera-
tional, methodical and task-specific features make the body of data heteroge-
neous to a degree that DEMO it impossible to speak of “the framing effect.”
Framing appears in different clothes, some effective in producing an effect and
some ineffective.
Framing without reference points. Risk manipulation, Quality of risk, as
well as Number DEMO risky events have their influences on the framing effect. The
most important characteristic of these is Risk manipulation: framing effects are
strong with reference point manipulations and are not present or even negative
with outcome salience DEMO This distinction is basic. For situations
where the salience of outcomes is manipulated, the threat-rigidity hypothesis
FRAMING RISKY DECISIONS
43
(Staw, Sandelands, & Dutton, 1981) may be applied. This hypothesis suggests
that the presence of threats may result DEMO processing strategies which are more
consistent with conservative behavior (e.g., reliance upon prior expectations,
attention to dominant cues, or a tendency to emit well-learned responses).
Take an example: Why should the possibility to lose something with, say 20%
probability, make people be inclined to DEMO (this would be the Prospect
theory prediction—risk seeking with losses)? DEMO losses are made salient, they
should probably be avoided, as compared to making gains salient. However,
models that offer predictions opposite to DEMO theory tend to be generally
overlooked in framing research (Sitkin & DEMO, 1992). Thus, one conclusion is
that much research has been done with an inappropriate (informal) operational
definition of the phenomenon (72 out of 230 effect sizes relate to outcome
salience manipulation). We DEMO that these two different operational mean-
ings of framing should be conceptually separated in future research.
The prospects of risk. The two remaining risk DEMO, Quality of
risk and Number of risky options were shown to DEMO influential for framing too.
The point to be stressed here is that these can be seen as measures of the
appropriateness of the original DEMO theory formulation. Prospect theory
was formulated for situations presenting a sure and a risky option and where
a focal risky event is clearly discernible. DEMO, the lesson learned is: be careful
with generalizations from the riskless/risky case to the case where the options
differ in risk. My DEMO is that researchers often are too optimistic with
respect to the applicability of the framing concept to risky/risky cases. The
problem with risky/DEMO cases is that it is often to a degree arbitrary, which
DEMO to consider the more risky option and which to consider the less risky
one. A typical example is found in the Message compliance design: What is
the more risky behavior? Is it more risky to do breast self-examination and to
be able to detect potential cancer early or DEMO it more risky to fail to do breast
self-examination and not to detect cancer? With respect to the final outcome
(life or death DEMO or later), doing the examination is the less risky option,
but with respect to the immediate outcome, doing the examination is the more
risky option. If we do not know which outcome is relevant DEMO a given individual,
the question of what constitutes the more or less risky option cannot be an-
swered. Or to give an example DEMO the Escalation of commitment design: Is
it more risky to throw DEMO money after the bad or is it more risky to invest
it in another—risky—activity? The answer again is not straightforward. I think
it is not incidental that the Message compliance design and the Escalation of
commitment DEMO are not influenced by framing, since in these designs the
alternatives DEMO differ only in degree of risk. Similarly for the Number of
risky events: if alternatives are described by a multiplicity of risky events,
each will probably differ only quantitatively in risk. Which option is more DEMO
less risky thus often cannot be exactly specified.
Choice or no choice? The point to be made pertains to the response modes
that are used in framing experiments. Choices dominate the research and
produce much stronger DEMO than judgments or ratings. The judgmental or
¨
ANTON KUHBERGER
44
rating mode, offers many points for evaluation (DEMO & Koele, 1990),
choices offer only two and, furthermore, choices typically are forced choices
(indifference is not permitted). This requirement may enlarge the difference
between conditions (see Fagley & Miller, 1987)DEMO Similar ideas are brought
forward in research on other phenomena, e.g., for ambiguity avoidance (Curley
et al., 1986). A related factor DEMO to the number of alternatives in a
decisional or judgmental context. If you have to choose you must be presented
with two options to DEMO from. Ratings or judgments can be provided for a
single option, DEMO That is, problems presenting two options tend to come
with choices, and problems presenting one single option tend to require ratings
or judgments. DEMO two options the relevant difference between conditions may
be more visible and thus may more or less artificially enlarge differences
(Pany & Reckers, DEMO; Perner et al., in press). Response modes may also be
correlated with other characteristics of task and context which may contribute
to DEMO difference.
Explicit and implicit gains and losses. Doing the framing manipulation by
gains/losses is dominant practice; the ratio between gain/loss manipulations
and task-responsive manipulations is approximately 5:1. The overall analysis
showed a higher DEMO size for gain/loss manipulations, however, this difference
disappeared when 3 task-responsive effect sizes were excluded in the outlier
analysis. Our interpretation is DEMO, for the most part, task-responsive framing
manipulations have succeeded in manipulating the framing in the intended
way. Only in a few cases the DEMO may have been ineffective. This
makes hope that framing must not be seen as an isolated effect which can be
demonstrated only in basic DEMO and which has no practical utility. To the
contrary, relative indirect DEMO demonstrate the influence of framing.
These indirect manipulations are at times very similar to situations encoun-
tered in daily life. Thus, framing research may have a lot to say about more
practical aspects of judgment and DEMO in daily life.
Framing groups. Experiments with single participants yield similar or
higher effect sizes than experiments that use groups of participants as units.
DEMO analyses are usually done after group discussion, and the question often
DEMO whether group discussion leads groups to adopt more extreme reference
points. Our conclusion is that this is unlikely. It may depend on group dynamics,DEMO
on the number of group members, on the rate of positively DEMO negatively
framed group members, on the topic under discussion, etc. For instance, group
discussion may render a framing manipulation ineffective, when group DEMO
bers learn about other frames for viewing a problem. Experiments at the group
level are a very heterogeneous class with respect to experimental procedure,DEMO
since besides the more formal aspect of framing, many additional social, and
procedural features may be differently construed in group experiments.
Domain generality DEMO domain specificity? Research has demonstrated in-
stances of domain specific reasoning (e.g., Gigerenzer & Hug, 1992). We made
a rather crude DEMO between possible domains. This distinction was made
ad-hoc and was not related to any existing distinction (e.g., Carey, 1985). We
FRAMING RISKY DECISIONS
45
simply distinguished four different domains that were present DEMO our database
at face validity. A priori, we had not formed DEMO specific hypotheses on differ-
ences between these domains. Overall, domain specific DEMO is not indicated
by the results. To be sure, the effect DEMO do differ to a degree between domains,
but these differences are not big and give no systematic picture. Admittedly,
the definition of DEMO should constitute a domain is crucial here. Since I a m
not aware of any characterization of different domains that would be appro-
priate DEMO framing research, I had to rely on more pragmatic considerations
for DEMO different domains. Domains could be distinguished by seman-
tic or other theoretical considerations too, however (for a more thorough discus-
sion of domain DEMO see Goldstein & Weber, 1995; Hirschfeld & Gelman,
1994). Maybe domains cannot be discriminated at such a fine level than was
DEMO here.
Are experts immune? An argument against the generalizability of findings
DEMO decision research is often that these findings are based on students as
participants. Motivational and/or cognitive differences are assumed to exist
between students DEMO target samples and it is argued that these differences
would make effects found in the lab to disappear in the real world. The point
DEMO stress here is that framing research has stepped outside the lab to a consider-
able degree. But, although students and experts may differ in a variety of
ways, with respect to framing experts are not immune to the reference point
effect (overall analysis and reference point analysis) DEMO at least, experts are
also influenced by framing, but maybe to a lesser degree than students.
Asian disease problem and variants. The more DEMO differ from the
original Asian disease problem, the lesser the reference DEMO effect. This is
also underscored by the observation that, in the DEMO analysis, the original
finding of Tversky and Kahneman from 1981 comes DEMO position 7. That is, the
original finding is of impressive size (d 511. 16) and is an outlier with respect
to the magnitude of the overall effect. The findings clearly differentiate between
procedural designs that DEMO a framing effect and designs that fail to do
so. It is comforting that the most frequently researched designs are at the
same time DEMO most effective. The Asian disease dominates the research and
shows the strongest mean effect; gambles are essential designs in judgment
and decision making and do also show a big effect. Overall, 4 of 10 procedural
designs are ineffective: the Clinical reasoning design is ineffective, and, to
make things worse, is used relatively frequently. Further ineffective designs
are Escalation of commitment, Message compliance, and Evaluation of objects.
Inspection of Table 2 DEMO an insight here: these four designs are the ones
that are DEMO dominated by reference point manipulations but either by outcome
salience manipulations or they are not dominated by either manipulation.
Stated more provocatively, these designs are not framing designs, since usually
no reference point is manipulated in these designs. Table 10 reveals exactly
this: if these designs are done with reference point manipulations, the Clinical
reasoning, Escalation of commitment, and Evaluation of objects produce strik-
ingly high effect sizes. The empirical basis DEMO these findings is at most three
data, however. In the extreme, these may all come from one study. Thus, firm

conclusions on these designs may be to early. DEMO seems, however, that all strict
framing designs are effective in producing a reference point effect. The more
effective of these use single risky DEMO and choices (Asian disease, Gambling),
and the less effective DEMO these use multiple risky events and ratings (Bargaining,
Game theory)DEMO In between is the Ta x evasion design with a single risky event
but no dominance of either response mode. To summarize, the analysis demon-
strates that the designs differ in frequency of application as well DEMO in effect
size. The Asian disease, Gambling, and the Ta x evasion designs seem to be
beyond reasonable doubt with respect to the DEMO point effect. These three
designs produce the effect. For the Asian disease and Gambling designs this
conclusion rests on much empirical work, for the Ta x evasion design it rests
on unequivocal findings. For the Bargaining DEMO Game-theory designs the
issue is not yet settled. The biggest problem with the Game theory design is
that the relation to risk is relatively DEMO and that it is often difficult to clarify
which choice constitutes the more and less risky option. The Clinical reasoning,
Message compliance, Escalation of commitment and Evaluation of objects de-
signs are the losers (or winners?) of our analysis: for all these an effect cannot
be found. These are to a big degree labeling experiments, however.
Heterogeneity. Our analysis shows that there is no uniform framing effect.
The effect sizes DEMO the data-base are very heterogeneous. Some of the factors
that contribute to this heterogeneity have been identified, others may have
gone unnoticed. For one point, the features of experimental designs tend to
come clustered. The risk characteristics, for instance, are correlated with each
other and with response DEMO Thus singling out one characteristic and ana-
lyzing its features is only part of the truth. One additional point of caution in
interpreting these DEMO must be stressed. In evaluating framing research,
one has to bear in mind that the framing effect can interact, may be dampened,
or even may be made disappear, by some characteristics other than those
studied here. These may be individual difference dimensions relating to age,
DEMO, culture, or language. These may also be more general cognitive dimen-
sions like motivation, emotion, knowledge, perception, memory, and cognition.
For instance, I think it is entirely possible that the reference point effect is a
consequence of some specific mixture of perceptual features of framing DEMO
that are—unbeknownst to researchers—ever and ever the same. For instance,
the sequence of alternatives may be relevant. This is plausible, since the adop-
tion of reference points may easily be influenced by the sequence of DEMO
But when reading the procedures section of framing experiments, one seldom
DEMO that the sequence of options was varied. My impression is that the
reviewed research does not vary the sequence of options systematically. Quite
to DEMO contrary, the sequence seems to be identical for most experiments (at
least in the Asian disease and Gambling designs): the first option DEMO is
presented is the sure alternative and the second option is the risky one. It may
easily be that this methodical shortcoming may contribute DEMO the reference
point effect. Cognitive processes are another stepchild of framing research.
Taken the effect for granted (what can safely be assumed), we would be well

advised to probe for the cognitive processes and DEMO that are responsible
for it. To accomplish this, research technologies are DEMO for that offer richer
data. Measurement of response latencies (e.g., Svenson & Benson, 1993) is a
promising technique. Another promising technique is DEMO collection and analy-
sis of verbal protocols (e.g., Maule, 1989; 1994).
To be fair, though we have identified many relevant characteristics, some
important ones may have gone unnoticed. A potentially relevant distinction
that has not been made in the present analysis is the distinction between
DEMO and opportunity which has recently been put forward by Highhouse an
his collaborators (Highhouse & Paese, 1996; Highhouse, Paese, & Leatherberry,
¨
1996; Highhouse & Yuce, 1996; Jackson & Dutton, 1988)DEMO This research shows
that the perception of threat and opportunity is confounded with framing
conditions and indicates that threat and opportunity may be basic DEMO in
predicting the conditions under which gains will tend to produce risk-aversion
and losses will produce risk seeking. We did not make this distinction DEMO the
present analysis, because threat/opportunity could not be excerpted from DEMO
research reports. Maybe some of the heterogeneity in our data, which DEMO not
entirely explained by the present analysis, could be accounted for DEMO the threat/
opportunity distinction.
SUMMAR Y AND CONCLUSIONS
Framing in risky decision making is a phenomenon now in its teen-age years.
After having DEMO born in 1981 in the seminal article of Amos Tversky and
Daniel Kahneman, it has attracted a lot of empirical and theoretical interest.
A meta-analysis of 136 research reports yielded 230 single effect sizes, which,
overall, corroborated the framing effect. Between conditions, the mean effect
size DEMO d 5 .31 is, according to Rosenthal and Rosnow (1991) DEMO a small
(d 5 .20) and a medium (d 5 DEMO) effect size.
Two characteristics of framing research seem to be especially DEMO for
the effect. These are Risk manipulation and Response mode. Risk manipulation
relates to the fact that framing experiments can try to change reference DEMO
and thus produce framing effects, or they can manipulate outcome salience.
DEMO reference point manipulations were shown to produce a framing effect.
Outcome salience manipulations did produce null results. The second im-
portant characteristic relates to DEMO mode. Choices dominate framing
research and produce strong reference point effects while ratings and judg-
ments were shown to be less influenced by manipulated DEMO points. Ten
different experimental designs were identified and characterized by their rele-
vant features. Some of them were shown to be effective (Asian disease, Gam-
bling, Ta x evasion), the status of some had DEMO be left undecided (Bargaining,
Game theory), and some were DEMO to be ineffective (Escalation of commit-
ment, Message compliance, Clinical DEMO, Evaluation of objects).
At the time being, the present analysis is a first attempt to systematically
identify the features that may be DEMO for framing. I think, most of the
relevant features are identified, though some may still be missing. Further

important features of framing tasks that await research DEMO perceptual and
cognitive in nature. The reference point effect can be taken for granted by now,
however, and further research should not try to demonstrate that the effect is
there but should try to clarify DEMO and why it is there.
