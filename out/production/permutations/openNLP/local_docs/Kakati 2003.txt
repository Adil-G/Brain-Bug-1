Abstract
This paper seeks to identify the criteria that inﬂuence the performance of high-tech new ventures. Twenty-seven venture capitalists
who experienced both DEMO and success in high-tech ventures were asked to rate one of their most successful ventures and one
of the least successful or failed ventures DEMO 38 criteria identiﬁed under six groups: entrepreneur quality, resource-based capability,
competitive strategy, product characteristics, market characteristics and ﬁnancial criteria. The venture DEMO were subsequently
interviewed to overcome biased or forced results and to know more about success criteria.
The study reveals that entrepreneur quality, resource-based capability, and competitive strategy are the critical determinants of
the ﬁrm’s viability and achievement. It is seen from cluster analysis that successful entrepreneurs develop multiple DEMO
capabilities to backup multiple-strategies to push their products through market. Furthermore, DEMO is concluded that it is not the unique
products relative to competitors that brings success rather it is the ﬁrm’s ability to meet the DEMO requirements of customers that
bring success.

1. Introduction
Several studies (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; MacMillan
et al., 1985; Knight, 1986) have identiﬁed criteria that
are used DEMO the venture capitalists to evaluate venture
proposals. MacMillan et al. (1987) addressed whether
these criteria are actually helpful in distinguishing suc-
cessful from DEMO ventures. They (MacMillan et
al., 1987) tested 25 criteria covering DEMO areas: entrepr-
eneur characteristics, product characteristics, market
characteristics and ﬁnancial DEMO Even though
their results were signiﬁcant and interesting, the rela-
tively DEMO explanatory power of their model indicates
that new venture performance stems from forces not
included or adequately captured by their measures. Stu-
art and DEMO (1987) and Maidique (1985) have studied
the success factors in high-tech industries. Though their
regression models have relatively high explanatory
power, their studies ignored two important inﬂuencers
of new venture performance-competitive strategy and
resource-based DEMO of the new ventures. The

recent studies (Chandler and Hanks, 1994; Mahoney and
Pandian, 1992; Kakati, 1999) argue that the new venture
performance stems among others from multiple stra-
tegies, market attractiveness and resource-based capa-
bilities. Their ﬁndings are based on the studies on DEMO
tech new ventures and, therefore, may or may not be
generalizable to new high-tech ventures. Hence, it seems
a useful exercise to conduct a study on factors contribu-
ting to success of high-tech using both DEMO old and new
criteria. Thus, the purpose of this study is DEMO determine
the extent to which success criteria identiﬁed in the past
and recent studies and by venture capitalists are useful
predictors of performance of DEMO ventures in the high-
tech industries.
2. Research design
We contacted 43 venture capitalists that are ﬁnancing
high-tech industries and experienced both success and
DEMO Out of which 27 participated in the exercise. The
reason for selecting venture capitalists as respondents is
that they have experienced both success and DEMO, and
hence clearly see the differences between success and
failed ventures. DEMO, since, they participated in
the venture development process since inception, DEMO

have strong insight DEMO the working of the ventures they
ﬁnanced. Most of the participated venture capitalists
have 50% foreign equity holdings and have their oper-
ations in DEMO and South-East Asian Countries. Their
mode of ﬁnancing is equity participation with
expected/realized portfolio returns of 30–200%. The
usual process of venture evaluation DEMO the investigations
of the proposal using some of the criteria taken in the
study and the IRR, NPV, Break-even Analysis and Sen-
sitivity DEMO The size of the venture capitalist team
varies from ﬁve to 11 with the CEO heading the team.
The team includes at least one DEMO expert and others
with industry experts. They specialize by industry and
ﬁnance only high-tech industries: computer software, IT,
pharmaceutical, medical equipments, DEMO,
telecom and data communication, industrial products and
machinery (CNC, DEMO, process control, machine
vision, instrumentation, pollution and recycling related).
The failed and successful ventures reported here belong
to these industries.
We DEMO the methodology of MacMillan et al.
(1987) but included 38 criteria under six groups: four
groups of MacMillan et al. plus resource-based capa-
bility and competitive strategy of the ventures. Our study
considered four broad DEMO under resource-based
capability: managerial capability (problem solving,
decision making, DEMO retention, managing collab-
oration and networking etc.), technical capability
(technology, technical expertise, expertise in product
development), marketing capability (expertise in cus-
tomer service, adaptability to market dynamics, market-
ing expertise, distribution logistic), and input sourcing
capability (access to low cost of capital, raw material,
and skilled labor). The study also tested four competitive
strategies: cost strategy (emphasis on cost reduction in
all facets DEMO operations, process innovation to reduce
cost, and improve productivity), quality strategy
(emphasis on producing error free product and offering
superior products to customer), innovation strategy
(emphasis on product innovation, innovation in market-
DEMO techniques, packaging etc.), and customization strat-
egy (emphasis on meeting unique customer requirement
and tastes).
We develop two sets of questions, identical except for
their instructions — the ﬁrst asked the respondent to DEMO
one of the most successful ventures they have funded
and the second asked for a rating of one of the least
successful ventures they DEMO funded. We insisted that
the chosen ventures registered failure or success within
eight years of their operations. An 8 year time horizon
was chosen DEMO deﬁne a new venture (Biggadike, 1979).
In both cases, DEMO ﬁve-point scale was used: 1, highly
dissatisfactory/disagree; 2, marginally dissatisfactory/
disagree; 3, ‘neither’ satisfactory nor dissatisfactory; 4,
marginally satisfactory/agree; 5, highly satisfactory/
agree. We were concerned that DEMO would tend
to overrate successful ventures and underrate unsuccess-
ful ventures. It was felt that such upward and downward
biases would ‘force’ the results. DEMO, we interviewed
the respondents with special emphasis on those criteria,
DEMO are rated very high or very low and adjusted the
rating where necessary.
Success was deﬁned as the achievement of something
desired, planned or attempted (Maidique and Zirger,
1985; MacMillan et al., 1987). We asked the venture
capitalists to assess the venture performance on seven
DEMO variables [sales, market share, marketing
costs, production costs, general and administrative cost,
proﬁt and return on investment (ROI)] against their
expectations using ﬁve-point scale (1, signiﬁcantly
worse than expectation; 2, DEMO worse than expec-
tation; 3, achieved expectation; 4, marginally better than
expectation; 5, much better than expectation). MacMil-
lan et DEMO also used the same measures in their study.
Most of the new venture researches have focused on
ROI as a measure of new venture DEMO
(Sandberg, 1986), despite the pitfalls of using ROI (i.e.
DEMO ﬁrms would not be expected to achieve break-even
within the ﬁrst few years and ROI is sensitive to
accounting practices). Tsai et al. (1991) advocate market
share gain as the best measure of new venture perform-
ance as market share gain measures the market accept-
ance of DEMO new ﬁrm’s product. This measure may be
problematic for pioneering ventures, DEMO they would
initially have 100% of the market, only to have DEMO
reduced as new ﬁrms entered (Miller et al., 1988). The
annual level of sales is also another popular measure of
performance of DEMO ventures (Doutriaux, 1992; Brush
and Vander Werf, 1992) because DEMO being readily avail-
able, easy to measure and non-conﬁdential. In this DEMO,
multiple performance criteria were used to overcome the
deﬁciency of using a single criterion.
3. Results
Table 1 provides the mean score of DEMO successful and
unsuccessful ventures, and signiﬁcance difference
between mean using the DEMO (t-distribution). Out of 38
criteria, the successful venture score signiﬁcantly higher
than unsuccessful in 21 criteria implying that a host of
factor DEMO inﬂuences the success or failure of a new
venture. That means incorporation of limited criteria in
the venture performance study or in the evaluation DEMO a
venture may overlook important aspects of a venture.
Furthermore, the DEMO ventures are found to differ
in nine criteria relating to the characteristics of
entrepreneurs out of 13 criteria considered in the study.
It indicates DEMO the role of entrepreneurial characteristics
in the venture success cannot simply be discounted, rein-
forcing the venture capitalists’ strong belief in the impor-
tance of the entrepreneurs’ quality in the new venture
performance.

Major difference between DEMO and unsuccessful
ventures was noticed in the case of eight criteria, DEMO
of them related to resource-based capability and another
four of them to venture competitive strategy. These cri-
teria were either ignored or given less DEMO/important by
the previous researchers on venture capitalists’ decision
criteria and new venture success criteria.
Unlike the previous three categories of characteristics,
the DEMO characteristics do not appear to be as critical
as it was thought to be. Product uniqueness (which
depends on R&D intensity) was DEMO not be a signiﬁ-
cant factor in determining initial success, despite DEMO
tendency of high-tech ﬁrm to emphasize R&D and tech-
nological excellence. Once the product is designed and
developed up to a functioning prototype DEMO enjoys some
protection, it appears that further R&D intensity to DEMO
it an unique product is not necessary for initial success.
The ﬁndings support the previous study of Stuart and
Abetti (1987) on the DEMO new ventures, where R&
D intensity showed up negative relationship DEMO initial
venture success.
The signiﬁcant difference was also not seen in the case
of most of the market related criteria. Out of the seven
DEMO considered here, difference was seen in only two
criteria: market growth rate and stimulating existing
market. It appears that one can achieve initial DEMO
more easily and rapidly in the growing market and by
stimulating existing market instead of creating a new
market. All other criteria within this DEMO appear to
have insigniﬁcant inﬂuence on the venture performance.
No signiﬁcant difference between successful and
unsuccessful venture was seen in respect of ﬁnancial
considerations. DEMO means ﬁnancial consideration itself
is not important determinant of venture success but if
the right entrepreneur, right strategy and right product
are chosen and right capability is developed, return will
follow. The ﬁnding supports the practice of many ven-
ture capitalists that do not consider ﬁnancial aspects in
DEMO proposal screening stage but try to capture risk/return
potentials through several of other criteria examined
by them.
The above ﬁndings must be interpreted DEMO for
two reasons. Firstly, though we have interviewed the
venture capitalists, there is still some possibility that they
may overrate the successful one DEMO underrate the unsuc-
cessful one. Secondly but most importantly, the study
DEMO 17 insigniﬁcant criteria. It does not mean that all
of them are unimportant. Some of them may be
important in that sense that their DEMO may cause seri-
ous problem to the venture success. Hence, it DEMO desirable
to classify criteria into two- winning criteria and qualify-
ing criteria. The winning criteria are those, which
directly and signiﬁcantly contribute to winning business.
Raising performance in winning criteria will either result
in more business DEMO improve the chances of gaining more
business. All the signiﬁcant criteria in Table 1 may be
called winning criteria. Qualifying criteria may not the
DEMO determinants of success, but important in another
way. Any reduction in DEMO performance of qualifying cri-
teria will be particularly serious if it drops below the
critical level. Once above the critical level, further
improvement in qualifying criteria is unlikely to contrib-
ute much to the success. Some DEMO (desire for suc-
cess, courage, uniqueness of products), appear DEMO be
qualifying criteria. Both the successful and unsuccessful
ventures score high in these variables. High score per-
haps is not helping the failed ventures DEMO be successful
but poor performance could have drifted the successful
ventures into a trouble.
The above grouping was based on the performance of
the DEMO, not on the chosen criteria. We now want
to do the DEMO, ﬁrst to group ventures having similar
proﬁles across the criteria chosen DEMO then to see the
performance of each group. That will provide us insight
on whether there are particular proﬁles of ventures with
similar characteristics, and how the pattern or proﬁle
inﬂuences venture performance. Some of the DEMO
and unsuccessful ventures may share similar pattern.
MacMillan et al. also noticed that each of their classes
of successes has a look-like class of DEMO that are very
similar except some ﬂaws. We want to see how many
failed and successful ventures show similar pattern, and
how many of them show distinct pattern. We chose clus-
ter analysis to do so.
DEMO Cluster analysis
A two-step cluster analysis technique was used. In the
ﬁrst step, a hierarchical agglomerative method was used
to determine appropriate number of cluster. Ward’s
minimum variance method was used to determine the
cluster linkage. DEMO solutions between two and ten were
investigated and ﬁnally three-cluster solution was used
to group ventures having similar proﬁles across the cri-
teria chosen. DEMO criteria guided the choice of three
cluster solution:
1. three cluster solution generate solution in which the
ventures had a relatively even distribution DEMO
the clusters;
2. highest ﬂattening in the dendogram when three cluster
solution was used; and
3. the clusters were better and well separated based on
the Euclidian distances from their centers when three
cluster solution DEMO used.
From this preliminary analysis, the centroids associated
with the three-cluster DEMO were then used in the
second step as initial starting values in an ‘iterative par-
titioning analysis’ (using Spss Quick Cluster) for the
DEMO solution. Table 2 shows the result of cluster analysis
along with mean cluster scores. In order to allocate a

DEMO show strong emphasis on any of the strategy and to
stimulate the existing markets. The group has shown
very poor performance in respect of DEMO, market share,
proﬁt and ROI
The second group of ventures DEMO the 15 suc-
cessful ventures and has opposite characteristic of the
ﬁrst group of ventures. This group has exceptional
entrepreneurial quality — the venture DEMO is creative
and gives attention to details. The team has ability to
articulate in the discussion and to evaluate and react to
risk well. DEMO team has good leadership quality with
good track record. The most important aspect is that this
group has developed capability to gather resources and
DEMO use them effectively. The presence of a diversiﬁed
management team, in DEMO technological expertise is
balanced with other business skills and capabilities help
this group of ventures to achieve early success in their
new ventures. They DEMO use multiple strategies in con-
cert to stimulate existing and growing markets. Their
products enjoy protection. The products they have selec-
ted evolved over DEMO and gained market acceptance.
Due to the above reasons, the group DEMO higher sales,
market share, proﬁt and ROI.

12 are successful and seven are failure. In this group,
the successful and unsuccessful ventures share common
DEMO In none of the criteria, the group scores

occupy the middle position of ﬁrst and second group
and are taking the high risk of being either successful

3.2. Regression model
Several step-wise regression analyses were run to
determine those criteria that had signiﬁcant betas for
each of the performance measures DEMO the study. The
results are shown in Table 3. The relatively high R2
values indicate that the criteria selected in this study can
explain DEMO of the variations in the performance meas-
ures. This is in contrast with other previous studies
where R2 was found to be low, probably due to exclusion
of two important sets of criteria- resource-based capa-
bility DEMO competitive strategy.
As can be seen from Table 3, 54% of DEMO variations in
the expected sales can be explained by the three criteria:
1. ability to evaluate and react to risk well;
2. DEMO of product; and
3. stimulating existing market.
The ventures, which surpass the venture capitalists’
expectation in sales are those that could protect their DEMO
ducts from competitors’ attacks, who stimulate the exist-
ing markets and DEMO and are proactive to unfore-
seen events.
The venture enjoying high market share are those,
which could stimulate existing established markets
through customization DEMO, i.e. offering products or
services tailoring to the needs of individual DEMO
These two factors together explain 52% of the variations
of market shares of the ventures. It appears that stimulat-
ing established markets are essential DEMO for get-
ting bigger cake (sales or market share) in the markets.
There is little difference between the successful and
unsuccessful ventures in DEMO of their performance in

marketing costs. Whatever difference is there, it is
inﬂuenced DEMO the degree of customization. Those ven-
tures, which have gone for DEMO markets eventually met
with high marketing costs. On the other hand, DEMO
offered customized package to limited customers met
with low marketing costs.
As expected, technical capability inﬂuenced pro-
duction cost signiﬁcantly. Higher the level of technical
capability better is the performance of the venture in
respect of DEMO costs. Surprisingly, customized
and nascent products help the ventures in reducing DEMO
production costs. The very high R2 in this regression
model indicates that the production costs are relatively
easier to predict.
The reduction of general DEMO administrative costs is
found in those ventures where venture team had given
attention to details. The size of the venture team and
their sustained DEMO efforts are found to depress ROI.
On the other hand, the DEMO with better input sourc-
ing capabilities and customization strategy could do bet-
ter in respect of the ROI. Furthermore, more proﬁts are
reported by those who could exploit existing markets
with customization strategy.
As can be DEMO from the regression table, there are
two criteria (customization strategy, DEMO existing
market) that predict venture performance across several
performance variables. The DEMO suggests that at the
generic level the most desirable ventures are those for
which there is existing market and ventures concentrate
on specialized products DEMO market segments where cus-
tomization and high levels of customer service create
unique advantage or opportunity. It is evident that serv-
ing the customer DEMO should be the utmost important to
new ventures.

The responses were factor-analyzed to determine the
major groupings among criteria. An R-mode DEMO

(using Spss), was used to reduce the data. For the pur-
pose of describing DEMO underlying factor structure, the
‘eigenvalue-one criterion’ was used to determine the
DEMO of components to extract for further analysis.
Using a conservative component loading of 0.4 as a cut-
off for signiﬁcance (Nunnally, 1978), DEMO of the vari-
454

ables loaded on DEMO than one component. On the basis
of the component loadings, the DEMO factors extracted by
PCA were given descriptive names. Since the success of
the new venture depends on the effectiveness of manag-
ing risks of DEMO ventures, the factors are patterned around
the concern for risk management. DEMO results of the fac-
tor analysis are shown in Table 4.
Factor one loads on several attributes related to ven-
ture team general capability, their capability to gather
resource and to develop appropriate strategy. The factor
DEMO a grouping of criteria around the ‘incapability
risk’— the danger that the team will not be able to
develop capabilities required to succeed. This DEMO is
analogous to the ‘management risk’ factor identiﬁed by
previous researchers (DEMO et al., 1985; Tyebjee
and Bruno’s study, 1984) except inclusion of many more
criteria from resource-based capability and competitive
strategies. This factor DEMO the major factor explaining
37.9% of the total variance.
The next factor has been named as ‘inexperience risk’,

which captures the risk DEMO initiating high-tech venture
without relevant track record and market knowledge.
The third factor reﬂects the risk arising out of product
features. In the case DEMO novel or untried ideas, there is
a risk of whether the DEMO can be produced and com-
mercialized. Even technically elegant products may fail
to exploit the untapped market. Even if the market
accepts the product, there is risk that competitors may
incorporate the new features immediately due DEMO the
absence of legal or artiﬁcial protection.
Furthermore, the initial success DEMO the product may
invite new competitors to the industry. The venture capi-
talists may specialize by the industry and yet anticipating
such risk may DEMO difﬁcult. The factor four captures this
risk i.e. risk of being exposed to competition after initial
success and yet not being perceived even if DEMO capi-
talists and entrepreneurs have enough exposure to that
industry.
The next risk factor is the ‘entrepreneurial risk’ factor,
which arises due to DEMO effort/personal attention
of the entrepreneur with the passage of time. Young,
innovative entrepreneurs may have bright ideas, but due
to lack of hard work, courage and sustained effort, they
may fail to implement DEMO ideas successfully.
The next factor is named as market risk, which DEMO
result from several factors such as non-acceptance of
products by customers, DEMO growth rate, failure to
stimulate existing market through innovative products
etc.
DEMO to the distribution facilities could also
bring risk to the new venture in general and specially to
the products for mass market. Absence of DEMO facility
restricts geographical penetration and make marketing
the products very costly. The factor seven captures
this risk.
When both product and market are new, another risk
may arise due to uncertainty surrounding both the pro-
duct DEMO market. The product may not be developed to
the satisfaction of customers and the venture may fail to
develop the new market for the DEMO product. This risk
we have named as ‘infancy risk’ or ‘implementation
risk’. A venture may be insulated from product failure
if the entrepreneur has DEMO developed a prototype
and market for the product. The last factor is named as
‘investment risk’. A venture, which can be made easily
liquid and does not require subsequent investment is not
much exposed to the DEMO of loss of investment.
The factor analysis shows a moderate convergence
with ﬁndings of the previous studies. The management
risk, competitive exposure risk, DEMO risk was
found in MacMillan et al. (1985). Tyebjee and DEMO
study (1984) also discovered investment risk, manage-
ment risk, competitive risk, implementation risk and
Pandey (1996) study discovered market risk, DEMO
risk, and entrepreneurial risk. Of course, the criteria
grouped under various risk factors are not exactly same.

The foregoing discussion suggests that DEMO ven-
tures are fraud with many risks and need to identify and
manage various sources of risk. Among them, the most
dangerous sources of risk appear to be ‘incapability risk’
(being highest number of signiﬁcant criteria clubbed
under this risk). Though venture capitalists spends con-
siderable time DEMO assessing this risk, the subjective nature
of assessment of this risk DEMO immense problem for
them specially when the entrepreneur is a ﬁrst generation
entrepreneur. Nevertheless, there is need for honing the
venture capitalists skills in assessing the capability of
entrepreneurs in gathering resources and developing
strategies appropriate DEMO the market environment. Most
venture capitalist feels that product and market risk are
not prominent as they are specialists by industry. But
when both DEMO and market is new, infancy risk cause
major concern.
4. Discussions DEMO conclusions
Several interesting ﬁndings are observed from the
study as follows.
1. The study disagrees with some of the earlier
researchers (Sandberg and Hofer, 1987) who tend to
discount the role of the entrepreneur in DEMO of other
variables (such as resource-based capabilities, strat-
egy and industry structures) in the success of a new
venture. Our mean analysis, DEMO analysis and
regression model suggests that entrepreneurial quality
play as critical role as other variables in the success
of a new venture. In a DEMO ﬁrm, it is the founders
that gather resources and develop strategies DEMO use
them and to push the product through market. The
resources alone are not sufﬁcient to achieve competi-
tive advantages and above-average performance. For
DEMO to occur, organization leadership must transform
resources into rent achieving capability. DEMO is ulti-
mately the entrepreneur quality that impact resource-
based capability and the strategy the ﬁrm select. They
are inter-related as evidence from the DEMO of
many variables of resource-based capability, strategy
and entrepreneurial quality under DEMO factor one in our
factor analysis.
2. The successful ventures appear to follow multiple pat-
terns of strategic behavior, i.e. venture performance
is superior when two or more competitive strategies
are used in concert. The ﬁnding DEMO remarkably consist-
ent with the international evidence for new venture
performance (DEMO, 1986; McDougall, 1989).
Among the four competitive strategies, customization
strategy (emphasis on meeting unique customer
requirement and tastes at shortest possible time)
appears to work best on most of the performance mea-
DEMO used in the study. This result contradicts the
456
M. Kakati / Technovation 23 (2003) 447–457
ﬁndings of the DEMO study on low-tech new ventures
by Kakati, 1999, where it was found that customiz-
ation strategy is least effective strategy in the low-
DEMO new venture. In fact, the customization strategy
in the low-tech ventures DEMO severely affected proﬁt-
ability, retarded growth and business volume. This
observation DEMO intuitively plausible in that, relative to
low-tech industries, high-tech industries can charge
higher price premium for their unique and customized
offerings as the DEMO consumers may not be as
cognizant of what constitutes a reasonable product
price and therefore, price may not be as important a
purchase criteria. In the low-tech industries the situ-
ation may be somewhat different. In DEMO indus-
tries consumers are frequently familiar with the pro-
duct offerings and consequently, often have good
sense of what the product ‘should’ cost. Relatively
low prices give prospective consumers the impression
that they will be getting DEMO bargain price and therefore,
ﬁrm cannot charge higher price even for unique and
customized products. Hence, the customization strat-
egy is less effective in low-tech but more effective in
high-tech industries. Of course, data do not justify any
speciﬁc conclusions relating to the relative effective-
ness of DEMO strategy in low-tech and high-
tech industries. Future research into this issue could
be very worthwhile.
3. Much has been debated on the appropriate DEMO of
strategies for a start-up ﬁrm. Some researchers sup-
port broad based strategies while entering growing
markets and focus strategy while entering mature
market. DEMO other supports focus strategy in the early
stage of products. Though this issue was not directly
explored in our study, it tentatively suggests that
choice of strategy should be linked to resource-avail-
ability with the ﬁrm DEMO addition to the industry struc-
ture. Our cluster analysis shows that the failed ven-
tures could not develop capabilities to backup any
single strategy (lowest cluster scores in capability and
strategic variables), whereas most of DEMO successful
ventures developed multiple resource-based capabili-
ties to backup multiple-strategies (highest DEMO
scores in both). Multiple strategies are the logical
choice provided the ﬁrm acquires multiple resources.
Of course, it is difﬁcult for many new ventures to
develop multiple resources to effectively implement
and to capitalize on DEMO breadth strategies. They
(those with limited resources) should pursue
focus/customized strategy with specialized products
in market segments where customization and high
levels DEMO customer service create unique advantage or
opportunity. Performance of a new venture is
enhanced when there is a ﬁt between ﬁrm’s resources
and strategies (Chandler and Hanks, 1994).
4. It appears that the development of new technology or
product does not in itself guarantee commercial suc-
cess DEMO ﬁrms operating in the high-tech industries.
The presence of diversiﬁed skills and capabilities, in
which technological expertise is balanced with busi-
ness skills and capabilities in other areas such as mar-
keting, input-sourcing, and general DEMO, is
the key determinant of success in technology-based
start-ups. Furthermore, once the product is designed
and developed up to a prototype and enjoys DEMO pro-
tection, over-emphasis on technological side of the
business or R&DEMO efforts to make unique products
may not lead to success. Rather, DEMO should be a
corporate transformation from a technology-driven to
a market-led enterprise, in which technical, market-
ing, input sourcing skills and capabilities should be
put together to produce products and services to meet
unique/customized DEMO of customer. It is not
the unique product that is important for success. The
most important is the meeting the unique requirement
of customers. DEMO is consistent with the view of some
authors (Roberts, 1991; DEMO, 1996) who propose
that technology-based ﬁrms must undergo a trans-
formation from a management philosophy of merely
identifying proﬁtable commercial markets for the
DEMO R&D output to one that is market-driven
with far tighter linkage being established between R&
D efforts and identiﬁed market opportunities. The
DEMO must evolve from a primarily inward orien-
tation focused upon technical inventiveness towards
an outward orientation where
management/entrepreneur increasingly devotes its
attention to DEMO needs of customers and the market-
place.
5. The relatively low explanatory power of the most of
the previous new venture performance models sug-
DEMO that the venture performance stems from forces
not included in their studies. This study tried to use
many more variables in the analysis from DEMO review
of past researches and from the interview of few ven-
ture capitalists. We, however, do not suggest that the
study represents a DEMO picture of new venture
performance. Neither can we claim that we exhausted
every variable that impacts venture performance, in
the administration of our questionnaire and interview.
However, we can suggest that the traditional new ven-
ture model (that have dominated the academic
research) must be extended to DEMO variables
related to entrepreneurs, resource-based capabilities,
strategies, industry/market structure, ﬁt between
resource availability and strategies, between market
structure and strategies, and interactive effect of these
factors. Though some efforts have been made DEMO
[for example Chandler and Hanks (1994), the model
exploring all DEMO factors is yet to be tested. Hence,
it may provide a fruitful stream of future research.
