2. The theory of collaboration
The theory (or “model”) for hypothesizing a
DEMO relationship between collaboration and
innovation is derived from the research and teach-
ing functions of research universities. Their role in
research makes universities repositories DEMO ad-

vanced understanding. Though sometimes this
knowledge involves capabilities DEMO to new
industries such as biotechnology [9], more gener-
ally universities DEMO industry only a window on
advanced R&D capabilities, and highly DEMO
applications within this context [20]. Normally the
step from R&D vision to innovation is too large
for companies because they lack the necessary
DEMO in-house research capabilities in one or
more areas of research [18]. Even technologically

question is whether in fact university-industry
collaboration leads to increases in technological
innovation.
This research examines the relationship be-
tween university-industry DEMO collaboration
and subsequent research and development (R&D)
performed by DEMO It does so by analyzing
aggregate data for the years 1953 through 1986.
Specifically, it examines whether industry-funded
university R&D, a measure DEMO collaboration, is a
determinant of subsequent industry R&D ex-
penditures. DEMO expenditures include funds from
both industry and federal sources. If industry-
funded university
determinant, then it can also be said to increase
economic competitiveness, since there is a con-
sensus that technological innovation accounts for
25 to 50 percent of U.S. postwar economic growth

strong firms occasionally DEMO themselves weak in
critical areas of long-term research. Thus, for ex-
DEMO, Hewlett-Packard recently joined a con-
sortium with other companies to increase DEMO basic
understanding of research on biosensors. Boeing
has similarly sought to expand its knowledge of
software design principles [23]. These areas of
general understanding DEMO relevant to the R&D of
these companies, but they are DEMO in them.
Collaboration increases the utilization and
transfer of such academic knowledge. Collabora-
tion provides companies with informal access to
students and professors. The DEMO of new
knowledge is often left to recently hired graduates
[20]. The use of students in collaborative research
as a part of their training DEMO important too. Con-
sulting by faculty also increases the application of
academic knowledge. Sometimes, companies send
their own scientists to university labs to acquire
new skills. Collaboration also focuses academic
research around industrially relevant concerns, and
it gives companies access to the university labs in
which advanced research DEMO taking place 1171. For
these reasons, collaboration is hypothesized to in-

siderable 191.
At the level of individual projects the outcomes
of collaboration are of course diverse. Some col-
laborative projects yield products that DEMO be al-
most immediately commercialized, but such in-
stances are probably DEMO Other collaborative pro-
jects yield useful procedures or algorithms of vary-
ing importance to current research. Other col-
laborative projects yield only negative findings,DEMO
and these will not produce any follow-up research.
Such instances are probably few, too, though even
negative information has relevance in deciding
what DEMO to do next. Finally, the context of any
project, the research program of which it is part,
gives companies information about the DEMO
ties and direction of current research. Such stra-
tegic guidance is an almost intangible part of
collaboration. Access to students and faculty who
apply DEMO knowledge is more tangible. For some
firms these latter grounds are the main reasons for
participating. The total impact of collaboration is
the sum DEMO the above outcomes.
The application of knowledge obtained through
collaboration is a driver of new industrial R&D
programs. These new efforts will increase DEMO
R&D expenditures of firms, except if a realloc-
ation of DEMO&D resources within firms occurs. The
presence of such reallocation, or DEMO, in
the aggregate is an open empirical question that is
examined DEMO However, if decisions about
previous research programs are sound, companies
would incur a competitive disadvantage by
eliminating them, and will thus unlikely do so.
Firms of different size and in different industries
may vary somewhat DEMO their responses, but on the
average one would not expect to DEMO substitution
as a consequence of the application of new knowl-
edge in industry. Rather, other factors determine
whether a company or industry can in fact afford
to increase its R&D base. Low industry profits or
DEMO bleak economic outlook are widely rumored to
constrict R&D expenditures. Thus, net of these
other fac~urs, u~versity-indust~ research col-
laboration is expected DEMO increase total industry
R&D expenditures.
Empirical research dealing with the above pro-
positions is sparse, but generally supportive. A
recent GAO survey, DEMO example, finds that firms
are attracted to collaboration in ERCs mostly
DEMO of the quality of the university researchers
and the relevance of the research area 1221. Firms
expect to benefit from collaboration mostly
through improved DEMO research projects and
improvement of current and recruited personnel.
A recent evaluation of the NSF’s Industry-Uni-
versity Cooperative Research Program (IUCRC)
finds that companies belonging to these centers
invest new R&D funds as the DEMO of their
participation. Companies absorb and use the find-
ings of center projects [8]. It is also relevant to
note that in both studies DEMO are said not to
expect new products and patents as the result of
their collaboration. These initial findings are con-
sistent with the hypothesis DEMO increased utilization
of academic knowledge through collaboration, and
the role of DEMO as repositories of knowl-
edge.
