ABSTRACT
In his widely reprinted paper ‘‘On the Folly DEMO Rewarding A, While Hoping for B,’’ Kerr
argued that vividness DEMO one of the major reasons for distorted rewards. Using both
archival and survey data, the present paper directly tests Kerr’s proposal by investi-
gating whether, how, and why highly visible behaviors are over-rewarded and less
DEMO, but similarly (or more) important behaviors are under-rewarded. The National
DEMO Association (NBA) was chosen as the domain of this study because scoring
is particularly vivid, even though both non-scoring and scoring performances are
critical for winning games. Findings from four studies demonstrated that the scoring
DEMO of NBA players was weighed more heavily than their non-scoring
performance. Scorers were rewarded with higher salaries and received more support
in the NBA DEMO balloting than defenders, even though they might not necessarily
make more DEMO than their teammates. This pattern of ﬁndings suggests that the
vividness effect may lead to pronounced differences in people’s judgments, especially
when they face abundant real-world information with similar validity. Copyright #

INTRODUCTION
Information varies in many ways. Information is vivid when it is ‘‘emotionally interesting, concrete, and
imagery provoking; and proximate in a sensory, temporal, or spatial way’’ (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, p. 45).
Theories suggest that people inferentially and judgmentally weigh information in accordance DEMO its
vividness (Nisbett & Ross, 1980). Thus, vividness is DEMO to bias managerial judgment and decision
making (Bazerman, 2002). Kerr (1975) argued more than three decades ago that vividness was one DEMO the
major reasons for distorted rewards in organizations. He suggested that certain behaviors are under-rewarded
simply because they are less visible rather than less DEMO For example, ‘‘scoring baskets and

hitting home runs are more readily observable than feeding teammates and advancing base runners’’ (Kerr,
1975, p. 780).
A more recent poll revealed that Kerr’s folly of rewarding A, while hoping for B was still widespread in
corporate America today (Kerr, 1995). Because of mixed empirical evidence on DEMO effects in the
experimental literature (Taylor & Thompson, 1982; Taylor & Wood, 1983), however, Kerr’s original
arguments have not been adequately researched. Thus, this paper directly tests of Kerr’s proposal by
exploring whether, how, and why individual and organizational representatives bias reward allocations when
DEMO tasks are more vivid than others.
In particular, the present research DEMO whether vividness may lead to distorted rewards in a real-world
setting, DEMO which highly visible behaviors are over-rewarded and less visible behaviors are similarly
important, yet under-rewarded. Based on Kerr’s own example, I examined this DEMO in the National
Basketball Association (NBA). Using both archival and DEMO data, I tested the effects of vividness on NBA
players’ salaries DEMO selection as All-Stars.
Perhaps one of the most famous axioms in team sports, especially basketball, is ‘‘offense wins games,
defense wins championships.’’ DEMO this widely accepted adage is true, defensive prowess should carry more
DEMO than offensive competency in NBA teams’ investments in their players. However, DEMO a team game,
basketball also needs different contributions from different players. A team cannot win without scoring; but at
the same time it must prevent the other team from scoring more to win. Thus, defense should be at least as
important as, if not more important than offense in the NBA (Chatterjee, Campbell, & Wiseman, 1994; Hoﬂer
& Payne, 2004).
As Kerr (1975) suggested, however, scoring baskets, is more vivid than blocking shots or rebounding. The
most frequently referenced statistics of basketball concern scoring, probably because it is easily observed and
attracts more attention. Although other aspects of performance, such as assists and rebounds, are also
important, they may not be as exciting DEMO observable as scoring. Thus, if it is vivid, NBA players’ scoring is
likely to have a greater impact on their salaries and All-Star DEMO than their defensive performance.
Therefore, I hypothesized that shooters will be DEMO more lavishly and receive more votes in the NBA All-Star
balloting program than defenders or even all-around players. I tested my hypotheses in four DEMO using both
archival and survey data. Study 1 showed the vividness effect of scoring on both salaries and All-Star votes
based on publicly available DEMO of current NBA players. Study 2 replicated the ﬁndings of Study 1 using
survey data from NBA fans. It suggested that vividness might subconsciously DEMO against one’s real beliefs.
Studies 3 and 4 used behaviorally based measures to conﬁrm the ﬁndings of the ﬁrst two studies. I then
discuss DEMO ﬁndings in terms of their general implications for understanding vividness effects in
organizational decision making.
Vividness
Vividness has a long history in the information DEMO literature. Tversky and Kahneman (1973, 1974)
ﬁrst documented that people can fall prey to availability heuristics because of easier retrieval. Some
memories DEMO easier to recall than others, and people may overestimate their chance DEMO occurrence (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1983). Thus, vivid events carry DEMO weight in shaping attitudes and opinions
(Nisbett & Ross, 1980), especially in fuzzy or indistinct situations (Slovic, 1993) because people
interpret ambiguous or complex information based on the most accessible concepts (Higgins, DEMO, &
Jones, 1977).
When people make judgments, they ﬁrst need to recall relevant information (Schwarz, 1998). This process
depends DEMO the nature of the content to be recalled and the ease with which it can be brought to mind (Schwarz
& Vaughn, 2002)DEMO If the content to be recalled is vivid, it is more DEMO to be stored; it is also likely to be
readily available, reducing the difﬁculty of recall. Vivid information may also activate greater cognitive
DEMO than other information because it is more likely to be pondered and rehearsed (Nisbett & Ross,

1980). In particular, when people’s attention is constrained, vivid information may attract more attention and
weigh more heavily than ‘‘pallid and abstract propositions of substantially greater probative and evidentiary
DEMO (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, p. 44). Thus, people are prone to overestimating unlikely but vivid events
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)DEMO
Several studies support this logic. For example, Nisbett and Borgida (1975) showed that people based their
predictions more on vivid case-based information than base rates. Stapel and Velthuijsen (1996) found that
people reported a DEMO likelihood of being a victim of a car accident when they had read a newspaper report
of a car accident that is vivid rather DEMO pallid. Vivid persuasion also inﬂuences jury judgments (Bell &
Loftus, DEMO): it biases perceptions of disputants (Wilson, Northcraft, & Neale, 1989) and causes observers to
judge a defendant more harshly (Reyes, Thompson, & Bower, 1980). Vividness is also a particularly effective
DEMO strategy: Vivid imagery (Babin & Burns, 1997) and affect-laden photographs (Mitchell, 1986)
affect consumers’ attitudes toward an advertisement and their DEMO intentions to purchase a product.
Other studies, however, have demonstrated that vivid information does not always inﬂuence judgment
more than pallid information (Taylor & Thompson, 1982; Werner & Latane, 1976, for reviews) and that it
may even undermine persuasion (Frey & Eagly, 1993). DEMO their comprehensive review, Taylor and Thompson
(1982) found that empirical DEMO of vividness effects was actually unclear in spite of the wide acceptance
of the impact of vivid information. The effect of vividness appears to DEMO far from simple (Nisbett & Ross,
1980), and the DEMO conditions that are necessary to produce vividness effects are not always available
in the laboratory (Taylor & Thompson, 1982; Taylor & Wood, DEMO).
The current research is an attempt to examine whether, how, and why vividness, an important judgment
and decision-making construct, may lead DEMO distorted rewards in a real-world setting. The NBA offers an
interesting context for studying vividness because the scoring performance of NBA players seems to DEMO
all of the criteria of vivid information: ‘‘(1) emotionally interesting, (2) concrete and imagery provoking; (3)
proximate in a sensory, temporal or spatial way’’ (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, p. DEMO). First, professional basketball
activates the emotions of players, coaches, DEMO fans. Second, scoring performance is easily observable and
excites the imagination DEMO a team’s hopeful supporters. Finally, scoring is proximate and intense: Scoring
dominates basketball coverage, reinforcing the impact on one’s judgments and inferences. For example,
when Kobe Bryant scored 81 points in one game, sports pages and commentary were buzzing. For the same
reason, Wilt Chamberlain is always widely famous for his single-game 100-point scoring record rather than
his DEMO rebound record. In fact, many ardent fans do not know that DEMO phenomenally grabbed 55
rebounds in a single game.
Staw and Hoang’s (DEMO) study of the sunk cost effect of draft number on players’survival DEMO the NBA also
showed that scoring was a stronger predictor of playing time and survival in the league than any other
performance component, suggesting that the vividness of scoring may also overly inﬂuence coaches. This
discussion DEMO that:
H1: Scoring performance is more positively related to vividness DEMO non-scoring performance in the
NBA.
Subjective assessment and fascination with ‘‘objective’’ criterion
Vividness is important because it leads to biased decision making (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). Kerr (1975)
argued that vividness was one DEMO the major reasons behind biased compensation. Overpayment and inequity
between pay and performance are not uncommon in professional sports. For example, Blass (1992) reported
that wages in major league baseball increased with tenure independently of DEMO gains. Yet, no clear
data have shown that vividness is one DEMO the causes.
Analyses of pay often suffer from two major assessment problems: subjective assessments and
oversimpliﬁed quantiﬁcations. Subjective assessments, based on limited data DEMO limited validity, are prone to

23
heuristics and biases (DEMO & Kahneman, 1974). Yet, subjective assessments are used in compensating
both top executives and workers (Fast & Berg, 1975; Hayes & Schaefer, 2000), and have an important impact
on many incentive contracts (Gibbons, 1998, 2005).
Oversimpliﬁed objective quantiﬁcations can also distort compensation decisions. Simple and quantiﬁable
objective standards are useful when performance is predictable DEMO easily quantiﬁable (Kerr, 1975).
However, much organizational performance is DEMO predictable nor quantiﬁable; hence Kerr (1975) warns
that such practices DEMO easily backﬁre.
The vividness effect can enhance both subjective assessments and oversimpliﬁed quantiﬁcations. On the
one hand, when people rely on subjective assessments, DEMO tend to process information according to heuristic
rules (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Highly vivid performance is more accessible and more likely to DEMO
overweighed in subjective assessments. On the other hand, a major criticism DEMO using quantiﬁable objective
standards is ‘‘overemphasis on highly visible behaviors’’ (Kerr, 1975, p. 780) when performance requires an
array of visible and DEMO so visible behaviors. This may be because less visible performance usually attracts
less attention, leading to underestimates of its importance. Logically, the folly DEMO underrewarding desired
behavior can be attributed both to overemphasis on highly visible behaviors and underestimation of less vivid
behaviors (Kerr, 1975).
Decisions DEMO NBA players’ salaries are likely to be subject to the same biases. Scoring baskets is more
readily observable than effectively passing the ball to DEMO Thus, scoring performance is likely to be
weighted more than other DEMO of performance in NBA teams’ salary calculations. In contrast, the relatively
DEMO visibility of non-scoring performance may lead it to be underweighted in spite of its important overall
contribution to team performance (Chatterjee et al., DEMO; Hoﬂer & Payne, 2004). Hence:
H2a: NBA players’ DEMO are more likely to be predicted by their scoring than their non-scoring
performance.
H2b: Vividness will positively mediate the relationship between NBA player’s scoring performance and
their salaries.
Vividness persuasion and all-star voting
Vividness should also DEMO evident in decisions regarding who should play on the All-Star team because the
most vivid shooters often outshine other great players in the public DEMO the media. As a result, the decisions of
NBA fans may DEMO be subject to the inﬂuence of vividness.
Vividness inﬂuences persuasion via three mechanisms (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Taylor & Thompson, 1982).
DEMO, vivid information and non-vivid information compete for people’s constrained attention (Taylor &
Thompson, 1982). Vivid information captures more emotional and cognitive DEMO, and therefore is likely
to be more persuasive. Second, vivid information prompts more information processing and cognitive
elaboration. Third, vivid information normally remains in memory longer, potentially activating additional
information from memory that leads to the same inferential conclusions.
These explanations suggest how the vividness of scoring DEMO affect NBA fans’ judgments and
decisions. First, although scoring and non-scoring DEMO will compete for NBA fans’ attention
when they watch a game, DEMO emotional and sensory vividness of scoring is likely to draw more of their
attention. Second, scoring performance may also activate greater cognitive elaboration, DEMO example, via
passionate discussions, than non-scoring performance such as assisting or rebounding. Consequently,
scoring ability should be more persuasive than defensive prowess DEMO shaping fans’ preferences for and
support of NBA players. Third, the DEMO of scoring should keep it in memory longer than non-scoring
performance. Thus, the vivid information of scoring performance is more likely to be available to NBA
fans when they vote for their favorite All-Star players. It DEMO also stimulate additional memories of

similar information and activate favorable associations, strengthening fans’ favorable judgments of
high-scoring NBA players.
H3a: NBA players’ scoring performance is more likely to positively predict their All-Star votes than their
DEMO performance.
H3b: Vividness will positively mediate the relationship between NBA players’ DEMO performance and
their All-Star votes.
STUDY 1
Study 1 used archival data to examine the vividness effect in the NBA. Publicly available data provided
DEMO advantages for testing my hypotheses because they not only included rich and real information about
players’ performance, salaries, and All-Star votes, but also allowed me to control for a whole set of real-world
factors such DEMO player’s demographic information, tenure in the league. Also, to my knowledge, no previous
study has documented the vividness effect outside the laboratory. Thus, using archival data might also
provide some special value for the investigation of vividness effects in the real world.
Methods
Sample and data
The DEMO data1 for 304 current NBA players, whose most recent contracts were DEMO between 1997 and
2005, were collected from the USA Today NBA DEMO database. The performance data were collected
from NBA ofﬁcial website, ESPN DEMO webpage, and databasebasketball.com. Based on players’ 2004–
2005 salaries and contracts, I ﬁrst determined the years when they signed their most recent contracts. DEMO
collected players’ performance data as of the date they signed their contracts. For example, if a player signed
his most recent contract on 1 August 2003, I collected his performance data in the 2002–2003 season.
Because rookies did not have prior NBA performance, their data were not included.
Because All-Star ballot information was only available for the top 10 players DEMO each region, I used
All-Star voting data collected from the website DEMO www.dfw.net for the 2003–2004 Season on 50 players.
Dependent variables
Salary and All-Star votes were the two dependent variables. Salary was based on each DEMO most recent
contract. Because many players had multiple-year contracts, I averaged DEMO salaries across the years of their
contracts. For All-Star votes, I DEMO the number of votes received in the 2003–2004 season. Both the salary
and All-Star votes were log transformed to normalize the distributions.
Independent variables
DEMO performance. Scoring performance was measured by the number of points players scored per minute
in each season. I used the number of points players DEMO per minute rather than per game to make the
measure of scoring consistent with the measure of non-scoring performance. An analysis using per game
DEMO produced similar results.
1 The salary data do not contain performance bonuses because that information was not readily available (Harder, 1992).

Non-scoring performance. To reduce multicollinearity, I used a composite index, developed by the Sports
News DEMO used by previous research (e.g., Harder, 1992), to measure DEMO performance:
þ þ þ STL ðFGA  FGMÞðFTA  FTMÞ
REB ASST BLK
 ¼
Non scoring
Minutes
where REB is the number DEMO rebounds, ASST is the number of assists, BLK is the number of blocked shots,
STL is the number of steals, FGA is the ﬁeld goals attempted, FGM is the ﬁeld goals made, FTA DEMO the free
throws attempted, FTM is the free throws made, and minutes is the number of minutes played.
This composite index2 represents a DEMO measure of non-scoring performance, and it reﬂects a
player’s overall non-scoring DEMO to his team (Harder, 1992). But it may not fully represent all of the
traditional statistics of non-scoring performance. Thus, I also tested my hypotheses by comparing the effects
of each speciﬁc non-scoring performance DEMO (e.g., assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals) separately
with that of scoring. The results of these additional analyses were in strong agreement DEMO those reported
below, which are more parsimonious.
Both scoring and non-scoring DEMO were standardized. As shown in Table 1, the correlation
between scoring DEMO non-scoring performance was negative and signiﬁcant (r ¼.47, p < .01). Although the
correlation was relatively high, the two independent variables clearly represent two different constructs.
Vividness. In the NBA, a player’s vividness is often reﬂected by regular media coverage. Thus, I measured
vividness by the number of news reports of each player’s performance in the online news DEMO For the
salary hypothesis, I counted the number of online newspapers DEMO each player’s performance in the
season right before he signed his most recent contract. For the All-Star vote hypothesis, I selected the online
newspapers reporting each All-Star candidate’s performance in the 2003–2004 season. I tried to DEMO
newspapers to those using vivid-related words to report performance to ensure that the papers reﬂected
vividness of performance.3 I only included English news to DEMO possible redundancy and variations caused
by differences in languages and translation. I also log transformed the variable to normalize the distribution.
Control variables4
Like DEMO studies on the NBA (e.g., Harder, 1992; Kahn & Shah, 2005; Staw & Hoang, 1995), I used the
following control variables to isolate other possible effects.
Years. For salary-related hypotheses, I included eight dummy variables for each year, with year 1997 as the
reference category, to control for any time-speciﬁc variation.
Tenure. Players’ tenure in the league was another control variable. Virtually all the players included in this
DEMO were subject to the 1999 collective bargaining agreement (NBA, January, DEMO), which set speciﬁc
salary caps based on years of service and established seniority-speciﬁc minima (Kahn & Shah, 2005).
Clearly, players’ salaries are affected by their years of service under this agreement. In particular, the rookie
contracts are likely to be constrained most severely. Because I DEMO rookies from my analyses, the results
2 It is worth noting DEMO the original equation included scoring-related measures such as ﬁeld goals and free throws. To avoid any possible
conﬂations, I also analyzed the data by using a modiﬁed equation without these scoring-related measures. The test results did DEMO
materially change. Thus, these results use the original equation.
3 The DEMO articles devoted to each NBA player might also include other information such as popularity, marketing, salary. The numbers
reported here attempted to eliminate DEMO many of these instances as possible.
4 In the regression analysis, DEMO also controlled for other variables such as contract length, age, performance ranking, All-Star status (for
salary hypothesis). I tested my hypotheses DEMO and without these additional control variables and the results did not materially change.
They were not reported in the paper for the sake of DEMO

Position. I created ﬁve dummy variables (center, guard, center-forward, forward-center, and forward),5 with
guard or forward being the reference category DEMO testing H2a and H2b about salaries. In contrast, because
of the DEMO position categorization in the All-Star data, I used two dummy variables (center and forward)
to test H3a and H3b about All-Star votes, with guard being the reference category.
Playing time6. NBA players’ salaries and DEMO for All-Stars should also be related to their playing time.
Thus, DEMO playing time in each season, in terms of minutes played, was controlled. The number of
minutes was log transformed to improve normality.
Team DEMO Because team performance might also have an impact on players’ status, DEMO was also
controlled for in the analyses of All-Star voting. It was measured by winning ratio (number of games won
divided by number of games lost). Because the contract years of NBA players vary and DEMO players changed
teams when they signed their new contracts, team performance DEMO not controlled for the salary analyses.
Results
Overall, the vividness predictions DEMO supported. Scoring performance was more highly correlated with
vividness than non-scoring performance. Scoring was also more strongly related to salaries than non-scoring;
and DEMO votes followed the same pattern. Vividness mediated the effects of scoring on both salaries and
All-Star votes.
Tables 1 and 2 report the correlations DEMO the study variables and descriptive statistics for the
salary-related and All-Star voting-related variables, respectively. Tables 3 and 4 present the regression

5The original dataset in USA Today categorized some of the players in more than one position. Some DEMO include Ben Wallace
(Forward-Center) in 2003 and Tracy McGrady (F-G) in 2005. Thus, I created the dummy variables based on these categories.
6 I originally chose to control both minutes and number of games DEMO some bench players might not be measured clearly by one
criterion alone. However, as expected, the two variables were highly correlated with each DEMO (r ¼ .892, p < .01). Hence, I dropped DEMO
numbers of games, and only used the numbers of minutes each DEMO played for the ﬁnal analyses.

(r ¼ .62, p < .01 in salary analyses, r ¼ .50, p < DEMO in All-Star vote analyses); its relationship with
non-scoring performance was negative (r ¼.26, p < .01 in salary analyses, r ¼.09, DEMO in All-Star vote
analyses).
H2a predicted that scoring performance would have a stronger impact on players’ salaries than
non-scoring performance. This hypothesis was DEMO Model 1 in Table 3 was the baseline model
including only control variables. To directly compare the variance accounted for by scoring and non-scoring
DEMO, Model 2 added non-scoring and scoring performances. Adding both variables greatly DEMO
the baseline model: compared with the baseline model, the R2 improved signiﬁcantly from 52.9 to 68.3%
( p < .001). In model DEMO, both scoring (bscoring ¼ .55, p < .0001) and non-scoring (bnon-scoring ¼ .24;
p < .001) were positively related to DEMO As predicted, however, scoring was more signiﬁcantly related to
salaries than non-scoring: analyzing variance accounted for was in agreement with the prediction. When I
added non-scoring performance to the equation of controls plus scoring performance DEMO salaries, the
R2 change was .03 ( p < .001). DEMO I added scoring to the equation of controls plus non-scoring performance
predicting salaries, the R2 change was .15 (p < .001). Overall, H2 was supported: NBA players’ salaries were
more likely to be predicted by their scoring performance than their non-scoring performance.
Model 3 tests the DEMO between scoring and non-scoring. Adding the interaction term did not
signiﬁcantly improve the model (R2 ¼ .001, p ¼ .49). The interaction DEMO scoring and non-scoring
performances was also not signiﬁcant (bscoring  non-scoring DEMO .024, p ¼ .49). This suggests that being
good at DEMO scoring and non-scoring does not necessarily enhance one’s salary.
H2b predicted that vividness would positively mediate the relationship between scoring and salaries. The
hypothesis DEMO supported. Model 5 included vividness as another independent variable. It was signiﬁcant and
positive (b ¼ .28, p < .0001), indicating a DEMO relationship between vividness and salaries. Mediational
analyses supported the mediation effects of vividness. The results revealed a partial mediation effect of
vividness based on DEMO, Kashy, and Bolger’s (1998) approach. First, scoring was signiﬁcantly DEMO to
salaries (bscoring ¼ .62, p < .0001). Second, DEMO was signiﬁcantly related to salaries (bvividness ¼ .61,
p < DEMO). Third, scoring was signiﬁcantly related to vividness (bvividness ¼ .62, p < .0001). Fourth, a
signiﬁcant relationship between vividness and DEMO existed (bscoring ¼ .36, p < .0001) when scoring was
DEMO for. Finally, the relationship between scoring and salaries was smaller, but still signiﬁcant
(bscoring ¼ .40, p < .0001) after controlling for vividness. A Sobel test conﬁrmed the positive mediation
effect of vividness on DEMO relationship between scoring and salary (Z ¼ 6.01, p < .001). In contrast, vividness
negatively mediated the relationship between non-scoring and salary (H3a predicted that scoring would have a larger impact on All-Star votes than non-scoring performance.Z ¼4.52, p < .001).
Model 1 in Table 4, the baseline model containing only the control variables, was not DEMO (F (6, 42) ¼
1.63, p ¼ .16). DEMO 2 added non-scoring and scoring performances. Adding both variables signiﬁcantly
improved the baseline model (F change ¼ 5.34, p ¼ .009; R2 change ¼ .17, p ¼ .009). Model 2 was signiﬁcant
(F (8, 40) ¼ 2.81, p ¼ .014); both scoring (DEMO ¼ .59, p < 0.01) and non-scoring (bnon-scoring ¼ .45;DEMO
p ¼ .03) were positively and signiﬁcantly related to All-Star votes. DEMO, it was worth noting that without
controlling for scoring performance, the relationship between non-scoring and All-Star votes is not
signiﬁcant (bnon-scoring ¼ .097, n.s.).
Analyzing the variance accounted for by scoring and non-scoring performances suggests that scoring is
related to All-Star votes more than non-scoring: the R2 change was .08 ( p ¼ .03), when adding non-scoring
DEMO to the equation of controls plus scoring performance predicting All-Star votes. In contrast, the
R2 change was .15 (p < .01) when adding scoring performance to the equation of controls plus non-scoring
performance predicting All-Star DEMO Overall, H3a was supported: scoring was a better predictor of All-Star
votes than non-scoring.
Model 3 tests the interaction between scoring and non-scoring. DEMO the interaction term marginally
improved the model (F change ¼ 3.34; R2 ¼ .05, p ¼ .08). The interaction effect between scoring and
non-scoring was negative and marginally signiﬁcant (bscoring  non-scoring ¼.252; DEMO ¼ .08). This

suggests that being good at both DEMO and non-scoring might actually decrease a player’s chance of being
selected as an All-Star. Scoring (bscoring ¼ .67, p < 0.01) remained positive and signiﬁcant in Model 3; so
was non-scoring (bnon-scoring ¼ .50, p ¼ 0.01).
H3b predicted that vividness would positively mediate the DEMO between scoring and All-Star
votes. The hypothesis was supported. Adding vividness in Model 4 signiﬁcantly improved the model: R2
increased to 60.2%; adjusted DEMO increased to 50%. Using Kenny et al.’s (1998) approach, I DEMO that (1)
scoring was signiﬁcantly related to All-Star votes (bscoring ¼ .43; p < .0001), (2) vividness was signiﬁcantly
related to All-Star votes (bvividness ¼ .68, p < .0001), (3) scoring was signiﬁcantly related to vividness
(bscoring .50; p < .0001), and (4) the relationship between scoring and All-Star votes was DEMO longer
signiﬁcant with vividness controlled (¼ bscoring ¼ .12; p ¼ .32). A Sobel test conﬁrmed the full mediation by
vividness on DEMO relationship between scoring and All-Star votes (Z ¼ 3.14; p < .001), but not that between
non-scoring and All-Star votes (Z ¼.68; p ¼ .49).
Although the results indicated that scoring was a stronger predictor of salaries and All-Star votes than
non-scoring performance, two alternative factors might have inﬂuenced the results. First, scoring might
actually be more important than non-scoring performance, rather than just being vivid. To investigate this
possibility, I conducted an exploratory analysis using the performance data of the 50 All-Star candidate
players in the 2003–2004 season. I ran regression analyses DEMO team performance as the dependent variable
and scoring and non-scoring performances as independent variables. The results indicated that All-Stars’
scoring performance (bscoring ¼.047, DEMO ¼ .771) did not enhance their teams’ performance more than their
DEMO between scoring performance and their teams’ performance was negative (but not DEMO performance (bnon-scoring ¼ .33; p ¼ .05) (F (2, 47) ¼ 3.34; p ¼ .04). Surprisingly, the
r ¼.216, n.s.). Because All-Star candidates only compose a small portion of all NBA players, this result
might not fully capture the relationship between scoring and team performance. However, previous research
has shown that the winning percentage of NBA teams was determined by both offensive and defensive
statistics, and defensive prowess was critical for teams to win games (Chatterjee et al., 1994; Hoﬂer & Payne,
2004). Thus, the importance of scoring alone was unlikely to explain the current results.
Second, the demand for shooters may be stronger than for defenders: ‘‘Dead-eye shooters are hard to ﬁnd
in today’s NBA’’ (Stein, ESPN, 2006). Thus, DEMO may be demand rather than vividness that drives great
shooters’ salaries. For the same reason, great shooters are likely to outshine great defenders in All-Star votes.
To test this possibility, I compared scoring and non-scoring performances using converted standardized
scores. A comparison of standardized scores between scoring and DEMO performances, however, did
not support this argument: the shooters in DEMO top 10 (t ¼1.36; p ¼ .16), 20 (t DEMO, p ¼ .69) and 30
percentiles (non-scoring performance. Similarly, comparing the relative standing of scoring with assists, blocks,t ¼1.25, p DEMO .90) had equally good standardized scores as those of the top DEMO at
rebounds, and steals, suggested that shooters might not be more desperately needed by the NBA teams than
other types of players. In DEMO, the vividness effect, rather than the importance of scoring to teams or the
demand for great shooters, seemed to be the underlying cause of the relationships reported here.
Discussion
Results in Study 1 showed that DEMO scoring performance of NBA players carried more judgmental weight
than the less observable non-scoring performance in both salaries and All-Star votes. Although it appears DEMO
NBA teams included non-scoring in their salary calculations, they overemphasized scoring. DEMO fans also
focused on scoring in their evaluation of players. Scoring was the only signiﬁcant predictor of their All-Star
votes, which were cast heavily for great shooters. The interaction between scoring and non-scoring
performances was not DEMO in two regression analyses (bscoring ¼ .024, p ¼ .49.;
bnon-scoring ¼.25, p ¼ .08.), suggesting that all-around players were unlikely to be considered more
favorably in terms of both salaries and All-Star DEMO

L. Wang Money and Fame: Vividness Effects
31
The media measure of vividness was signiﬁcantly related to both dependent variables and scoring
performance, but uncorrelated with non-scoring performance. The results of the mediational analyses
indicated that DEMO vividness measure partially accounted for the effect of scoring on salary and fully
accounted for the effect of scoring on All-Star votes.
Study 1 DEMO a clear and strong vividness effect in the real world as opposed to the lab. Yet,
vividness may correlate with multiple variables in DEMO real life. Although I tried to eliminate as many
unrelated factors as possible, the media measure of vividness might still include unwanted noise. In addition,
archival data alone cannot explain how NBA managers make salary DEMO, or how fans vote for All-Stars.
In particular, these data could not directly test whether decision makers fall victim to the inﬂuence of
DEMO for the reasons identiﬁed earlier (Nisbett & Ross, 1980) or DEMO more complex factors might be
involved (Taylor & Thompson, 1982). Thus, Study 2 used the NBA context and basketball fans’ cognitive
evaluations of salary and All-Star decisions to directly measure the effects of vividness.
DEMO 2
Study 2 used an online survey to assess basketball fans’ perceptions of NBA players’scoring and non-scoring
performances. Study 2 primarily investigated the reliability DEMO Study 1’s ﬁndings; it also attempted to explore
the underlying mechanisms DEMO the vividness effects.
Methods
Participants and procedure
Using both online and on-campus advertisements, I recruited 137 basketball fans from a major Midwestern
university and multiple online sports forums. All participants indicated that they were basketball fans DEMO
liked to watch NBA games. On a seven-point scale, their average DEMO of NBA games was 5.81 (SD¼ 1.12).
The survey contained DEMO questions on basketball fans’ perceptions of scoring and non-scoring
performances. The ﬁrst set of questions gave the fans ﬁve options (scoring, assisting, rebounding, stealing,
and blocking), and asked them when they watched NBA games, (1) what they looked at ﬁrst; (2) what DEMO
most memorable; (3) what was most eye-catching; and (4) what was most exciting about the game.
A second set of questions DEMO the vividness of scoring and non-scoring. Like previous research (e.g.,
DEMO et al., 1989), the fans rated eight attributes of scoring DEMO individual facets of non-scoring
performance on seven-point Likert scales (1 ¼ DEMO at all, 7 ¼ very much): ‘‘attention getting,’’ ‘‘interesting,DEMO
‘‘eye-catching,’’ ‘‘dull,’’ ‘‘exciting,’’ ‘‘boring,’’ ‘‘memorable,’’ and ‘‘impressive.’’
A third set of questions presented three categories of players: shooters, DEMO, and all-around players.
The respondents rated, on seven-point Likert scales, DEMO much attention each type of player would receive,
and how valuable each type of player was to the team. Finally, the participants indicated the likelihood that
each type of player would become an All-Star, and how each type of player would be compensated if they
were the DEMO manager of an NBA team.
Results
The ﬁndings of the online survey were consistent with those of Study 1. Scoring was clearly more vivid DEMO
any of the four major non-scoring performance factors in the minds of basketball fans. Table 5 documents
their considerable agreement on the vividness of DEMO: 75% reported that they looked at scoring ﬁrst when
watching NBA DEMO; 66% thought that scoring was more memorable than other performance; 47% felt that
scoring was most eye-catching; and 42% found that scoring was the most exciting aspect of performance.

A factor analysis of the eight measures of the vividness DEMO scoring and non-scoring led to one factor
accounting for 49.19% of the variance in scoring, and 55.62% of the variance in non-scoring. The reliability
of the resulting eight items (Cronbach’s a) was 0.85 for scoring; and 0.88 for non-scoring. A paired t-test
showed that scoring (M¼ 45.51, SD¼ 6.68) was signiﬁcantly more vivid than non-scoring (M¼ 41.67;
SD¼ 8.25) (t ¼ 4.42; p < .01).
A MANOVA assessed the effect of scoring and non-scoring on salaries, using the basketball fans’
responses to the salary questions for each type of player. Results DEMO signiﬁcant main effects of player
type on both pay (F (2, 396) ¼ 18.05; p < .001) and perceived contributions (F (2, 396) ¼ 5.69; p < .01).
Follow-up ANOVAS DEMO that the fans were likely to pay shooters (M¼ 4.91, SD¼ 1.21) more than
defenders (M¼ 4.53, SD¼ 1.33) ( p < .05) even though they believed that defenders (M¼ 6.30; SD¼ DEMO),
rather than shooters (M¼ 6.01; SD¼ 0.93), would DEMO more contributions to their teams (p < .01).
Although the DEMO would pay all-around players (M¼ 5.50; SD¼ 1.41) more than DEMO shooters ( p < .0001)
or defenders ( p < .0001), all-around players were not evaluated more favorably than defenders in terms DEMO
their perceived team contributions (M¼ 6.36; SD¼ 0.86) ( p DEMO .57).
The fans also believed that shooters (M¼ 5.58; SD¼ 1.08) were more likely to become All-Stars than
defenders (M¼ 4.46; SD¼ 1.44) (t ¼ 9.0; p < .001); there was no difference in their perceived likelihood of
selection for shooters and all-around DEMO (M¼ 5.61; SD¼ 1.19) (t ¼.17, p ¼ .86)DEMO
Two separate regression analyses also assessed the effects of vividness and perceived value to one’s team
on both salaries and All-Star votes. Vividness was DEMO by the attention that each type of player received;
perceived value was measured by how valuable each type of player was to his DEMO The results revealed that
both vividness (bvividness ¼ .32, p < .01), and value to one’s team (bvalue ¼ .14, p DEMO .02), were signiﬁcantly
related to salary (F (2, 336) ¼ 26.802, p < .01), and vividness accounted for more variance (R2 change ¼ .06
adding vividness to value vs. R2 change ¼ .01 adding value to vividness). Vividness had a similar effect on
DEMO votes: the relationship between vividness and All-Star votes was signiﬁcant and DEMO
(bvividness ¼ .66; p < .01; F (2, 334) ¼ 130.87; p < .01), and fans’ perceived value of each type of player was
not a signiﬁcant predictor of All-Star votes (b ¼ .021, p ¼ .62).
Discussion
The results of Study 2 were consistent with the results of Study 1. Basketball fans perceived scoring DEMO more
vivid than non-scoring. Their responses suggest that scoring will affect both salaries and All-Star votes more
than non-scoring. Even though defenders were perceived DEMO more valuable than shooters, and at least as
valuable as all-around DEMO, these fans reported that they would pay them less and cast DEMO votes for them
in All-Star balloting. Vividness was an important underlying factor, and a signiﬁcant predictor of both
salaries and All-Star votes. This suggests that fans may actually de-emphasize the players’ overall value to
the team.
DEMO results of Study 2 were based on general opinions; they did DEMO measure speciﬁc players’ performance.
For the sake of comparison, Study 2’s DEMO arbitrarily categorized players as shooters, defenders, or

all-around players. This categorization may have been inﬂuenced by respondents’ deﬁnitions of the player
types. If DEMO vividness of scoring leads to popularity, they might deem superstars as DEMO shooters or all-around
players and treat the not-so-great players as defenders. These potential biases may have contributed to Study
2’s results. To address this DEMO, Study 3 used behavior-based measures to test for vividness effects.
STUDY DEMO
Study 3 compared the vividness of speciﬁc scoring and non-scoring performances by manipulating the
proﬁles of different types of players. Using behavior-based measures, I tested how vividness affected salary
and All-Star vote decisions, and further investigated some of the mechanisms identiﬁed in Study 2.
Methods
Participants and procedure
DEMO 3 used two behavior-based online surveys: one for NBA salaries and DEMO for All-Star votes. A total
of 177 and 94 basketball fans responded to the two surveys, respectively. The recruiting procedure and
criteria were identical to those of the second study. All the participants were avid NBA DEMO (on a seven-point
Likert scale, M¼ 5.87; SD¼ 1.19). DEMO one responded to both surveys.
Each survey included the proﬁles of seven hypothetical NBA players who were proﬁcient in different ways
(see Table 6, which was given to participants). For example, Player A in DEMO 6 was created to be good only
at scoring: his points DEMO game were 1 SD more than the NBA average; all of DEMO other statistics were 1 SD
below the NBA average. Players B, DEMO, D, E, and F stood out on at least two DEMO statistics, but not
scoring. Player G was created to be an DEMO player: all of his performance statistics were around the
NBA mean. DEMO turnovers per game and the total number of games played last season were consistent across
all seven players. The respondents also had access to DEMO means and standard deviations of all performance

statistics in the NBA. In both DEMO, the order of presentation of the seven different players was
counterbalanced.
DEMO the salary survey, the respondents saw the following introduction:
Suppose DEMO you are the general manager of an NBA team. Your team decides to sign several new players.
(Players’ basic information is on the following pages.) You need to determine how much your team would
be willing to pay each of them. The pay range is from $500 000 DEMO $5 Million per season. Your total budget
is $10 Million. How will you allocate the pay among these players?
The instructions were followed DEMO the statistics of each player. Right after the respondents entered the
amount they would pay each player, they were asked to indicate on a one to seven scale how impressive they
thought each player was and DEMO great a contribution they expected each player to make to their team. The
participants were then asked to recall, based on the statistics they had just seen, what aspect of each player’s
performance was most important. Players were identiﬁed only by letter, for example, A, B, DEMO The letters
were randomized. Participants could not go back to the previous pages to review prior information or
answers. Finally, they were also asked which player they would choose if their budget only allowed them to
DEMO one player out of the seven.
The survey about All-Star votes resembled the salary survey, using exactly the same proﬁles, but a
different DEMO The respondents rated on seven-point Likert scales how impressive each of the players was
as a candidate for this year’s All-Star game, how likely they would vote for each player to be an All-Star, and
the contribution they believed that each player would make to his team. The DEMO were then asked to
recall the performance criterion that was most important for each player and which player they would support
if they could DEMO vote for one player for the All-Star team.
Results
The results of Study 3 were consistent with the ﬁndings in the ﬁrst two studies. DEMO proﬁle of the shooter was
more vivid to the respondents than those of the defenders. Scoring also had a stronger impact on both salaries
DEMO All-Star votes than non-scoring prowess.
In both surveys, scoring was more DEMO than non-scoring. Overall, the shooter (M¼ 5.18, SD¼ 1.29) was
perceived as more impressive than all of the other players. The one-way-repeated DEMO ANOVA tests
contrasting the shooter with each of the other types of players were all signiﬁcant at p < .05. Thus, scoring
was more vivid than non-scoring when basketball fans looked at the statistics of different DEMO of players.
The data also support the effects of vividness on both salaries and All-Star votes. Among the seven players,
the shooter (M¼ 14.22, SD¼ 1.11) received the highest salary7 from the basketball fans: the
one-way-repeated measures ANOVA (F (6, 170) ¼ 74.17, p < .01) and pairwise comparisons comparing
the shooter with all other players were all signiﬁcant at p < .01. In addition, the respondents were more likely
to vote for the shooter (M¼ 4.82, SD¼ 1.77) than for all of the other players. The one-way-repeated measures
ANOVA tests DEMO the shooter and each other category of player were all signiﬁcant at .05. Taken
together, scoring performance had a larger impact for fans on both salaries and All-Star votes than
non-scoring performance.
The post-experiment questionnaire also DEMO that the shooter was the most frequent ﬁrst choice when
respondents could only select one player (all ps  .01 for one sample x2 tests). As seen in Table 7, 40% of the
respondents8 chose the shooter over all of the other six players when they could DEMO sign one player for their
team; 52% voted for the shooter DEMO they could only select one candidate to be an All-Star.
7The salary was log transformed for the ANOVA analyses.
8Only 149 participants responded to DEMO question.

The data DEMO seemed to support some of the mechanisms identiﬁed in Study 2. In the salary and All-Star
surveys, 64 and 70.2% of the basketball fans, respectively, correctly recalled that points made per game were
the most DEMO aspect of the performance of the shooter (see Table 7). DEMO other type of performance was
recalled as accurately as the shooter’s performance (all ps  .01 for one sample x2 tests).9 In sum, the results
suggested that fans might process the information about shooters more carefully, and this information stayed
in their memories longer than the information about other types of players.
Discussion
Study 3 corroborated the ﬁndings of DEMO ﬁrst two studies. As predicted, scoring was more vivid than
non-scoring, and it inﬂuenced both salaries and All-Star votes more than non-scoring. Unlike DEMO 2,
although all-around players were still evaluated more positively than most other types of players, the fans
preferred the shooters over all-around players in both their salary and All-Star decisions. This suggests that
the label DEMO all-around players in Study 2 might also be vivid because the fans perceived them as more similar
to shooters than to defenders. However, when the fans could only look at players’statistics, they seemed to be
most attentive to scoring, evaluating shooters more favorably than all-around players.
In Study 3, non-scoring performance contained multiple performance dimensions. This may have
accentuated the simplicity, rather than the vividness, of scoring, making shooters stand out. In addition, the
naturally large variance of scoring might also make shooters more attractive than other players. Finally,

despite their consistent results, none of the ﬁrst three studies fully analyzed the relationship among scoring,
non-scoring, winning, and return on investments. Study 4 addressed these issues.
STUDY 4
Study 4 has three major purposes: to replicate the results of Study 3 by breaking down the complexity of
non-scoring performance and minimizing the DEMO effect of scoring’s large variance; to manipulate the
vividness of defense DEMO test whether manipulated vividness affects fans’ decisions; and to further explore DEMO
opinions of basketball fans to rule out some possible alternative explanations. In particular, Study 4 attempted
to answer the following questions: (1) DEMO would fans compensate different types of players; (2) whether fans
DEMO pay shooters higher salaries as an institutional norm; (3) how DEMO interpret the relationship between
winning, scoring, and defense; and (4) how they view the relationship between enhancing team performance
and other goals such as attendance and return on investment.
Methods
Participants and procedure
A DEMO of 115 basketball fans were recruited from online basketball forums. They randomly answered one of
two web surveys. No respondent participated in any of DEMO previous studies. On a seven-point scale, their
average liking of NBA DEMO was 5.34 (SD¼ 1.33).
The ﬁrst survey was similar to DEMO 3’s. To reduce the potential effect of scoring’s large variance,
however, the survey provided rankings instead of real performance data for each player. The rankings were
carefully chosen to reﬂect both real individual NBA statistics DEMO the performance data used in Study 3. To
simplify the sophistication of non-scoring performance in previous studies, I focused on comparing only
defense and scoring. Thus, I only included three players in the survey: a DEMO, a defender, and an all-around
player. Table 8 presents the players and their rankings. The order and identifying letters (A, B, or C) of the
players were counterbalanced using a Latin-square design; the DEMO categories of each player were
also randomized.
The second survey was identical to the ﬁrst survey except that the defender10 was manipulated to be DEMO
vivid. The manipulation repeated the defender’s rankings, presenting the data again DEMO when fans were

making their decisions. In addition, the defender was highlighted by the following statement ‘‘Player A (DEMO/C)
is a truly tough defender. He was ranked #45 and #58 in rebounds and blocks among 436 currently active
NBA players.’’ In DEMO, the shooter and all-around player were both presented in the same DEMO as in the
ﬁrst survey, without highlighting the players’ data or DEMO any special note of their rankings.
After making their decisions about salary recommendations, the participants answered a series of
questions (see Appendix) on seven-point Likert scales, about their opinions on scoring, defense, player
compensation, and winning. The order of the questions was randomized. Because All-Star players are
typically very highly ranked, Study 4 only tested fans’ salary decisions in both surveys.
Results
The results continued to support the previous ﬁndings. DEMO rankings as information, the shooter still received
higher salaries (M¼ 14.38; SD¼ .69) than both the defender (M¼ 13.94; SD¼ .78) and the all-around player
(M¼ 13.66; SD¼ .89) (F (2, 60) ¼ 22.85, p < .001). This suggests that the variance of shooting did not
account for the results of the previous DEMO
The vivid manipulation in the second survey was effective: the fans DEMO the defender as more vivid
(M¼ 4.38, SD¼ 1.17) with DEMO vivid manipulation than without it (t ¼ 2.81, p < .01). As a result, they
recommended marginally higher salaries to the defender (M¼ 14.20; SD¼ .85) than before (t ¼ 1.68,
DEMO < .10). In contrast, however, neither the salaries nor the perceived vividness of the shooter and the
all-around player signiﬁcantly changed (all ps not signiﬁcant). Even though the defender was highlighted, the
shooter (M¼ 14.57; SD¼ .73) still received signiﬁcantly more pay (F (1, 51) ¼ 14.76, p < .01). This suggests
that the natural vividness of the shooter is particularly strong. Yet, this might also suggest that shooters may
be paid highly as an institutional norm, just like quarterbacks in football. The fans, however, did not seem DEMO
agree: 70% of them actually believed that the all-around players deserved DEMO highest pay in the NBA, and
85% would pay the all-around DEMO higher salaries if they were an NBA general manager. In contrast, DEMO
3 and 10% of the fans preferred shooters in the same two questions and they did not seem to distinguish
shooters from defenders in DEMO of hypothetical compensations. Thus, their real salary decisions suggested
that vividness DEMO reversed fans’ preferences and beliefs.
The fans’ general opinions further supported the vividness of scoring. A direct comparison between
scoring and defense accentuated the DEMO of scoring: 82% of the fans reported that they looked at DEMO
ﬁrst when watching NBA games; 78% thought that scoring was more DEMO than defense; 86% felt that
scoring was more eye-catching than defense; and 86% found that scoring was more exciting than defense.
This suggested DEMO the comprehensiveness of non-scoring performance did not necessarily account for the
vividness of scoring demonstrated earlier.
Two other alternative explanations also bear careful consideration. DEMO, managers and fans might place
more emphasis on scoring because they DEMO that scoring was more critical to winning or top scorers had
the best athleticism and therefore were rare. However, fans’ responses showed that they were ﬁrm believers of
the old adage that defense was more important DEMO scoring in winning games (t ¼ 4.76, p < .001). In
addition, 93% rated all-around players as most athletically talented and only 15% thought that the NBA was
short of top scorers, far behind both defenders and all-around players.
Second, because scoring is more exciting and entertaining, shooters might be more appealing to fans.
Thus, in paying DEMO salaries to shooters, NBA managers might actually weigh team performance against
DEMO practical considerations, such as fan attendance and return on investment. Yet, the fans’ post hoc
responses suggested that their decisions rested squarely on DEMO team performance. For them, winning
games was more important to selling DEMO (t ¼ 3.17, p < .01) and attracting loyal fans (t ¼ 9.76, p < .001)
than scoring or being an entertainingly offensive team. Thus, fans expected that a team would earn more
money when it won games rather than simply enhancing its offensive prowess (t ¼ 6.29, p < .001) or hiring
great shooters (t ¼ 12.47, p < .001). These results suggest that fans placed considerable importance on both

Journal of Behavioral Decision Making
defense and winning. Simultaneously, however, DEMO vividness of scoring seems to have biased their decisions.
This might also explain why the fans agreed that shooters received more attention ( p < .0001) although both
defenders (t ¼ 6.92, p < .001) and all-around shooters (t ¼ 2.75, p < .001) were rated as more valuable to their
teams than shooters.
Finally, the results of Study 4 provided mixed support for the mechanisms of vividness found before. DEMO
of the fans correctly recalled both the defender and shooter in the end of the survey although in a regression
analysis the reported vividness DEMO each player right after their decision accounted for more variance in salaries
than their perceived contribution (R2 change ¼ .05 adding vividness to perceived contribution; p < .01 vs. R2
change ¼ .02 adding perceived contribution to vividness, p < .01). They also did not differ in their
preferences of different types of players when they were asked to DEMO pick one player.
Discussion
Study 4 ruled out several alternative explanations and consistently supported the previous ﬁndings. Fans
clearly perceived scoring as more vivid DEMO defense although they placed considerable importance on the
latter in terms of winning games. They also would pay shooters more, whether the data were presented in
terms of raw performance data or rankings. Increased vividness also DEMO the salary of the defender.
This suggests that vividness has an inﬂuential impact on salary decisions. In real life, however, the natural
vividness DEMO scoring seems to be powerful and ingrained. Thus, although enhanced vividness DEMO the
defender’s salaries, the vividness of scoring still made the shooter DEMO highest paid. These results also
suggest that vividness effects might subconsciously reverse preferences: although fans greatly valued
defense and winning, they actually paid DEMO to shooters, the most vivid, but less valuable players in their
beliefs.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
Using both archival and survey data, this research documented the vividness effect in the NBA. Study 1
demonstrated that scoring was DEMO vivid than non-scoring: scoring performance was more strongly related
to salaries DEMO non-scoring performance and All-Star votes displayed the same pattern. Study 1 also showed
that vividness partially mediated the effect of scoring on salaries, and fully mediated the effect of scoring on
All-Star votes. Study 2’s survey DEMO basketball fans supported the results in Study 1: the fans perceived DEMO
as more vivid than non-scoring. Vividness seemed to lead them to recommend paying shooters higher salaries
than defenders even though they believed that defenders DEMO make more contributions to their teams.
Studies 3 and 4 replicated the results of the ﬁrst two studies using behavior-based measures. The results
suggested DEMO scoring was more likely to affect salary recommendations and All-Star votes than non-scoring
because of its vividness.
Theoretical contributions
This research enhances our understanding DEMO vividness effects on judgments and decision making in several
ways. It presents one of the ﬁrst quantitative ﬁeld studies to support the vividness effect. DEMO results suggest
that information competition and differential attention are important conditions for vividness effects (Nisbett
& Ross, 1980). The research also explores DEMO of the important mechanisms of the vividness effect.
The evidence of the vividness effect in a real-world setting responds to Hogarth’s (1981, 2005) concerns
about the generalizability of lab-based decision studies (such as those investigating vividness effects) to
professional and real-world contexts. Taylor and Thompson (1982) noted that information competition and
differential attention were overlooked in the experimental DEMO on vividness. This might be one of the

39
reasons why there has been a discrepancy between the real-world experience of vividness and laboratory
failures DEMO produce a consistent vividness effect (Taylor & Thompson, 1982, for DEMO). The current
research supports this view, suggesting that excessive information DEMO selective cognitive elaboration are
important factors underlying the vividness effect. It also provides some insights into the kinds of situations in
which vividness effects DEMO bias judgment and decision making in the real world. The context for making
judgments and decisions about NBA players’ salaries and All-Star votes is DEMO by an abundance of
competing information and seemingly objective and reliable data. The vividness effect occurred in this
context where shooting behavior, though not more important to the team, was over-weighted relative to
defense in decisions about salaries and All-Star votes. This suggests that vividness may bias judgment DEMO
decision making most when a great deal of similarly valid information is available.
Second, the current research suggests that vividness may work subconsciously against one’s expressed
beliefs. Although fans placed considerable importance on defense and winning, they actually recommended
higher salaries for shooters, who they believed to be less valuable to team performance. The inconsistency
between their beliefs and their DEMO suggests that the vividness biases their decisions, cognitively and
emotionally, in an undetectable or subconscious way. Both mechanisms were discussed in the classic DEMO on
vividness (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Taylor & Thompson, 1982). However, the current research provided only
mixed evidence for both mechanisms. Future research might further explore the underlying mechanisms of
vividness and investigate DEMO ways of reducing its apparently subconscious bias.
Practical implications
The current research also has several practical implications for organizational decision makers. Overall, it
suggests that highly visible behaviors that occur in a context of abundant information DEMO over-rewarded
whereas less visible behaviors that are similarly important are under-rewarded.
This research also provides empirical evidence for Kerr’s (1975) argument that vividness DEMO to distorted
rewards. More than three decades ago, Kerr noted that DEMO was one of the major reasons for distorted
incentives in organizations. However, his argument was more speculative than empirical, and has been
scarcely DEMO by subsequent research. The current ﬁndings support Kerr’s view, suggesting that
DEMO may be subject to biased judgments and inferences because of vividness. This suggests that
organizations might fall victim to the trap of overweighing vivid, but less important performance while
overlooking critical, but less salient performance (DEMO, 2005; Kerr, 1975). As a result, some vivid, DEMO
less important performance may become very important evaluation criteria. For example, DEMO time,’’ that is,
the more hours you work, the DEMO, has been extensively used to measure employees’ performance and some
organizations DEMO even formed a deeply ingrained culture of face time (Munck, 2001). However, it may not
necessarily lead to higher productivity or efﬁciency. Thus, evaluations using face time may be due to its
vividness rather than its importance.
The ﬁndings may also be relevant for reward–performance relationships DEMO teams and groups.
Organizations do not always tie pay closely to performance (Lawler, 1971). The current research suggests
that some team members DEMO be inadequately rewarded not because they are unimportant, but because their
DEMO is less vivid than that of their teammates. In contrast, employees DEMO high visibility are likely to
be rewarded more than their less visible teammates even though they may not contribute as much to their
groups. DEMO phenomenon may be particularly evident in corporate America, where individual performance DEMO
likely to get more attention than team performance. On the one hand, employees who present themselves well
or even sometimes inﬂate their accomplishments may be over-compensated even though their real
performance may necessarily be more important DEMO their teammates. On the other hand, employees who
work diligently and DEMO as team players may be less vivid and thereby take a back seat simply because
they do not visibly ‘‘show up’’ enough.

Journal of Behavioral Decision Making
Finally, this research stimulates some provocative ideas concerning the folly of teamwork in the NBA. The
ﬁndings of DEMO research seem to be inconsistent with common beliefs about the importance and effectiveness
of defense and team play. While most teams rely on teamwork DEMO team chemistry to win games, individual
scoring appears to be most DEMO in determining a player’s value. Defense may not carry as much
weight in NBA teams’ investment decisions even though it is critical for winning DEMO The popular saying
that a championship is won by defense is widely esteemed and preached in the NBA (Broussard, 2004;
Pippen, 2005). However, the vividness of scoring seems to create more incentives to score than to defend.
Thus, this study raises the question of whether NBA teams may also succumb to the trap of rewarding Awhile
hoping DEMO B (Kerr, 1975).
Limitations and opportunities for future research
Like all research, these studies have strengths and limitations, which lead to DEMO for future research.
Among the strengths and limitations are the method used for the ﬁeld data collection, the large number of
control variables, DEMO different insights provided by each study, and the representativeness of basketball
DEMO as professional decision makers.
First, one of the strengths of the DEMO data in this research is that I more accurately linked NBA players’
contracts to their performance by collecting players’ performance data as of the DEMO they signed their
contracts. Unlike previous studies, which used the salary DEMO performance data from the same year (e.g.,
Harder, 1992), this method should reveal the real performance–salary relationship when teams sign players.
DEMO, since a player’s salary can be related to a complex series DEMO variables over the course of his career,
the current results might be reinforced by longitudinal analyses.
Second, another strength of the model is the number of control variables used to isolate other possible
effects and DEMO preliminary work done to reduce the number of control variables that were redundant.
Multiple analyses were also conducted to make sure that controlling for DEMO not included in the model
would not make any signiﬁcant change in the results. However, in carrying out similar research in another
setting, DEMO attention needs to be paid to the choice and non-redundancy of control variables.
Third, these studies provided reasonably consistent evidence for the vividness effect. They were designed to
be complementary to each other to provide some DEMO insights. The results of the four studies, however, were
not always consistent for all-around players. They seem to suggest different insights about how DEMO makers
treat complex information, such as that of all-around players, and how they process such information relative to
clearer or more vivid information, such as scoring. Thus, future studies might explore how vividness affects the
cognitive evaluations of information with multiple attributes. Furthermore, future research might also investigate
the underlying mechanisms of vividness in the context of more complex DEMO
Fourth, the web survey studies polled basketball fans rather than the DEMO decision makers of NBA teams.
The decisions of basketball fans might not reﬂect those of professional sports managers. Because the archival
evidence is consistent DEMO the survey results, however, this suggests similar judgmental biases. The data are
also consistent with prior research on experts and amateurs (Neale & Northcraft, 1986; Northcraft & Neale,
1987), which shows that DEMO are both prone to decision biases. However, the ﬁndings of the DEMO research
could clearly be augmented by surveys of NBA managers or direct observations of their decision making. A
future line of research might also DEMO how professional decision makers justify their decisions when they
are biased by the vividness effect.
Finally, some competing interpretations of the data are also possible. For example, fan appeal for
shooters may drive up their value because they are likely to attract more loyal audiences, bringing more
economic beneﬁts to their teams. By and large, this research suggests that shooters are more popular than
other NBA players. Since NBA fans focus heavily DEMO scoring, they may overlook defensive skills. Thus,
great shooters are DEMO likely to become superstars than great defenders and all-around players in the eyes
of NBA fans. These superstars can have a substantially positive effect DEMO revenues (Hausman & Leonard,

1997). However, DEMO games also has great appeal for NBA fans. For example, the DEMO Pistons’
home games, including playoff games, were rarely sold out from the mid-1990s to 2001. But after the team
won the 2004 championship, it not only led all of the other teams in attendance (ESPN NBA Statistics,
2006), but also developed a large fan following DEMO road games (Detroit Pistons, at www.answers.com). A
preliminary analysis using 1-year audience attendance data also suggests that winning games was
positively related DEMO audience attendance.11 Fans’ responses in Study 4 suggest that although NBA teams
are proﬁt driven, NBA managers and fans’ competitive drive and zeal for wins may be heightened as well.
Future researchers might investigate how NBA DEMO consider different factors to accommodate the needs
of their fans.
In sum, no single study can solve all the design problems that one would like to solve to fully test the
theory in the ﬁeld. The DEMO research does, however, provide reasonably consistent evidence of vividness
in biased rewards and compensations. Its limitations also suggest several important avenues to augment DEMO
supplement existing theory.
CONCLUSIONS
By using both archival and survey data, DEMO research presents strong empirical evidence of vividness in a
real-world setting. It also represents an important extension to the research on vividness. The results DEMO
that vividness has important inﬂuences on complex and elaborated decisions. The vividness of certain
components in natural and complex organizational settings seems likely to DEMO cognitive evaluations
because such attributes grab more attention and unduly affect information processing (Taylor & Thompson,
1982; Taylor & Wood, 1983). This may lead to biased rewards and compensation in organizations. In
particular, highly visible employees may be over-compensated, while less visible, but equally DEMO
employees may be under-compensated (Kerr, 1975).
Because conditions not typically created in the lab frequently exist in the real world (Taylor & Thompson,
1982), it is hoped that this study will encourage DEMO ﬁeld-based research exploring the cognitive biases and
alternative explanations of the undue impact of vivid information. Finally, weighing information in
proportion to its vividness may induce biased and risky decision making (Nisbett & Ross, 1980)DEMO Thus,
another venue of future research might assess how to avoid or reduce the effects of evidentially weak but
highly visible information on DEMO and inferences.
