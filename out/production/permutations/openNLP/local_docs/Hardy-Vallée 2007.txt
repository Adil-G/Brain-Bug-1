Decision-Making: A Neuroeconomic
Perspective
Benoit Hardy-Vallée*
University of Toronto
Abstract
This article introduces and DEMO from a philosophical point of view the
nascent field of neuroeconomics, DEMO is the study of neural mechanisms
involved in decision-making and their economic significance. Following a survey
of the ways in which decision-making is usually DEMO in philosophy,
economics, and psychology, I review many important findings in neuroeconomics
to show that they suggest a revised picture of decision-making DEMO ourselves as
choosing agents. Finally, I outline a neuroeconomic account of DEMO
1. The Rational Animal in Philosophy, Economics and Psychology
Human life DEMO one long decision tree. (Sterelny)
Rational agents display their rationality DEMO by making decisions. Some
decisions are basic (turn left or turn DEMO), other ones concern more
crucial issues (‘to be or not DEMO be’). Even abstinence is decision, as thinkers
like William James DEMO Jean-Paul Sartre once pointed out. Since choice is
central to life, DEMO is not surprising that many disciplines attempt to properly
characterize decision-making. Philosophy, psychology, and economics,
among others, all have different and sometimes conflicting views about
the nature of decision-making and the conditions that make DEMO rational.
Reviewing different construals of decision will therefore illuminate the
importance of neuroeconomics at the theoretical level.
Philosophers since Aristotle have reflected on the DEMO features of
decisions – what makes a decision rational or not. In philosophy of mind,
the standard conception of decision-making equates deciding and DEMO
an intention before an action (Davidson, Essays on Actions and Events; Searle;
Audi). According to many analyses, this intention can DEMO equivalent to,
inferred from or accompanied by, desires and beliefs. DEMO Davidson
explains,
If someone acts with an intention then he must have attitudes and beliefs from
which, had he been aware of them and had he the time, he could have
reasoned that his act was desirable. (Essays on Actions and Events 85)

The decisions rational agents make are thus motivated by reasons. If Paul
sends a manuscript DEMO a publisher, his decision is explained by a desire to
be DEMO and a belief that sending the manuscript can lead to publication.
Rational actions are explained by these reasons, the purported causes of
actions. Beliefs and desire are also constitutive of rationality because they
justify rational action: there is a logical coherence between beliefs, desires,
and actions.
Rational decision-making is also a core concept in economics. According
to a standard DEMO, economics is the ‘science which studies human
behavior as a relationship DEMO ends and scarce means which have
alternative uses’ (Robbins 15). DEMO definition shows the centrality of
decision-making in economic science: since means DEMO scarce, we should
use them efficiently to accomplish our goals. The DEMO branches of
rational-choice theory, decision theory and game theory, specify the formal
constraints on optimal decision-making in individual and interactive
contexts. Rational-choice theory DEMO be construed as logic of action. It
specifies which logical conditions the preferences of an agent should meet
in order to make her decision DEMO (see Baron, for an introduction).
For instance, preferences must DEMO transitive: if one prefers A to B and B
to C, one must also prefer A to C, but should not prefer C to A. An
individual agent facing a choice between two actions can DEMO a rational
decision if she takes into account two parameters: the DEMO and the
utility of each action’s consequence. Multiplying the subjective probability
by the subjective utility of an action’s outcomes allows her to find which
DEMO has the higher subjective expected utility. The philosopher’s
belief-desire model is thus reflected in the economist’s probability-utility
model: probabilities represent beliefs while utilities represent desires, at
least according to the standard interpretation of decision theory.
Game theory considers agents making decisions in strategic contexts,
situations where the DEMO of at least another agent must be taken
into account. Decision-making is represented as the selection of a strategy
in a game, a set of rules that dictate the range of possible actions as well
as DEMO payoffs of conjoining actions. For example, in the prisoner’s
dilemma, police officers hold in separate cells two individuals accused of
robbing a bank. DEMO suspects, Bob and Alice, cannot communicate with
each other. The police officers offer them the following options: confess
or remain silent. If one confesses – implicating his or her partner – and
the other one DEMO silent, the first is freed and the other one receives
a DEMO sentence. If they both confess, they will each serve a five-year
DEMO If they both remain silent, they will serve only a two-year
DEMO This situation can be represented as the following payoff matrix
(Fig.1), where Bob’s payoff is in bold characters and Alice’s in italics.
Assuming that Bob and Alice have common knowledge – everybody
knows that everybody DEMO that everybody knows . . . ad infinitum – of
both each other’s rationality and of the rules of the game, they should

confess. Confessing gives you either freedom or a five-year DEMO,
whereas remaining silent brings either a two-year or a ten-year sentence.
They will expect each other to make the best move, confessing, DEMO the
best reply to this move is also confessing. Even if they would be better off
by remaining silent, this choice is suboptimal: DEMO the other one
confess, they risk a ten-year sentence. In other DEMO, they should not
choose the cooperative move. Although the prisoner’s dilemma DEMO a
bare-bones picture of strategic decision-making, its simplicity allowed
generations of DEMO to investigate the nature of strategy in economic,
social, psychological, political, or even military contexts (see Poundstone
for a historical review)DEMO
Finally, decision-making is also a topic for experimental economics,
behavioral DEMO, cognitive science, and psychology (I will refer to
these empirical DEMO of rationality as ‘psychology’). Whereas
philosophy and rational-choice theory focuses more on normative or
prescriptive issues, psychology is generally interested in the descriptive
aspects of decision-making. Psychologists study how subjects make
decisions and the mechanisms DEMO underlie such decisions. Their patterns
of inference and behavior can then provide an empirical counterpart to
rational-choice theories. In numerous studies, Amos Tversky and Daniel
Kahneman showed that decision-makers’ judgments deviate markedly
from normative theories (Kahneman; Tversky; Kahneman, Slovic, and
Tversky). Subjects tend to make DEMO according to their ‘framing’ of
a situation (the way they represent DEMO situation, e.g., as a gain or as a
loss), and exhibit loss-, risk-, and ambiguity-aversion. For instance, they
prefer a sure gain of $10 instead of 10% chance of winning $110, even if
the second option’s subjective expected utility is higher.
Psychological studies also showed DEMO we are not as selfish and greedy
as the common interpretation of rational-choice theory suggests. Experi-
mental game theory indicates that subjects cooperate massively DEMO
prisoner’s dilemma (Ledyard; Sally) and in other similar games, such as the
ultimatum game. In this one-shot bargaining situation, a ‘proposer’ (DEMO)
makes an offer to a ‘responder’ (Bob) who can either accept or refuse the
offer (Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze). Alice proposes to split an

amount of money between them. If Bob accepts her offer, he keeps the
amount he is offered and Alice keeps the rest. If Bob rejects it, both
players receive nothing. According to game theory, rational agents must
behave as follows: Alice should offer the smallest possible amount, in order
to DEMO as much money as possible, and Bob should accept any amount,DEMO
because a small amount is better than nothing. If there is $10 to split,
Alice should offer $1 and keep $9, while Bob should accept the split.
The ultimatum game has been studied in many DEMO by varying
parameters such as culture, age, sex, the amount DEMO money, the degree of
anonymity, the length of the game, DEMO so on (Oosterbeek, Sloof, and
van de Kuilen; Samuelson). Overall, results show a robust tendency: the
game-theoretic strategy is rarely DEMO, because people tend to make ‘fair’
offers. Proposers tend to offer DEMO 50% of the amount, and responders
tend to accept these offers, rejecting most of the ‘unfair’ offers (less than
20%). Since the rules of the game are quite simple, it’s unlikely that
subjects fail to understand the game. Normal subjects seem instead to have
a tendency DEMO cooperate and to value fairness. A similar pattern of behavior
is also apparent in the trust game. In this game, Alice has an initial amount
of money she could either keep or transfer to Bob. If DEMO transfers it to
Bob, the amount is tripled. Bob could keep DEMO amount, or transfer it
(partially or totally) to Alice. Game DEMO predicts that either Alice
should keep everything, or if she transfers DEMO amount, Bob should keep
all of it. Experimental studies have shown DEMO players in Alice’s position
invest about 50% of their money and get more or less what they invest
(Camerer).
Experimental approaches to rationality can thus be informative for theory,
as they highlight two features DEMO our practical rationality. First, our
practical reasoning does not honor the DEMO of game and decision
theory. Second, morality might have been left DEMO of the picture of
strategic rationality so far. However, the study DEMO decision-making is
recently benefiting from another source of empirical inputs: neuroscience.
DEMO we make decisions, complex mechanisms inside our skulls process
information and DEMO our bodies. It was therefore predictable that, after
psychology, neuroscience would contribute to the study of decision-making.
In the next two sections, I briefly review some studies in the field of
decision neuroscience, and then analyze their consequences for the
philosophical conception of irrationality.

means; functional DEMO technologies study degrees of activation and
locations; single-cell recordings analyze the DEMO of individual cells;
lesion studies try to determine the function of certain brain areas by
investigating brain-impaired subjects (see D’Esposito, for an DEMO
presentation); and computational neuroscience uses computer simulations
to support or invalidate hypotheses about brain mechanisms (Eliasmith).
Obviously, these researches should shed DEMO on the nature of decision-
making. Recently, a conjunction between the DEMO study of
decision-making and experimental economics has led to the creation of a
new field now called neuroeconomics (Glimcher; McCabe; Zak). Although
many definitions of the field exist, I will limit myself to the one given by
philosopher Don Ross: ‘the program for understanding the neural basis of
the behavioral response to scarcity’ (330). Ross’s definition connects this
field to the traditional endeavor of economics (cf. Robbins’s characterization
of economics in first section).
Generally speaking, neuroeconomic research proceeds according to the
following methodology:
1. Choosing a formal model of rationality, a decision- or a game-theoretic
situation, and then deducing what decisions agents should make.
2. Testing the model behaviorally to see if subjects follow normative
DEMO
3. Identifying the brain areas and neural mechanisms that underlie choice
behavior.
4. Explaining why subject follow/fail to follow normative standards.
Of course, many variations are possible at each step: the formal model
may be an alternative theory, or tackle a question not addressed by
rational-choice theory; subjects may be of different age, sex, or cultural
background, DEMO they may be subjects who incur cerebral impairment,
cognitive deficit, DEMO Neuroeconomics research thus proceeds by comparing
formal models with behavioral data, DEMO by identifying neural structures
causally involved in economic behavior.
2.1. HOMO NEUROECONOMICUS
Neuroeconomics explains decision-making as the product of brain
processes involved in the DEMO, anticipation, valuation, and
selection of choice opportunities. It breaks down DEMO whole process of
decision into mechanistic components: certain brain areas may DEMO
the value of the outcome of an action before decision, other DEMO may
represent the value of the action per se, and yet DEMO ones may represent
these values at the time of the decision. Although such dispersion of data
may appear confusing, economic psychology provides us with a useful
framework for understanding the mechanics of rationality at the neural
DEMO in a coherent manner. Kahneman and his collaborators suggest that

the concept of utility should be divided in subspecies (Kahneman,
Wakker, and Sarin)DEMO While decision utility is important (the expected gains
and losses, or cost and benefits), decision-makers also value experienced
utility (the hedonic, DEMO, or unpleasant affect), predicted utility (the
anticipation of experienced utility), and remembered utility (how experi-
enced utility is remembered after the decision, e.g., as regretting or rejoic-
ing). Neuroeconomics should identify DEMO structures and processes
associated with these variables or, if necessary, suggest another typology.
This distributed account of utility, as I will call it here, is a useful tool for
organizing the numerous findings in this burgeoning field.
Neuroeconomics and the distributed account of utility can, for
instance, provide a more precise explanation of loss-aversion, a robust
finding in DEMO Subjects usually give to the loss of $10 a higher
impact than a $10 gain. Tversky and Kahneman attribute this aversion to
a bias DEMO the representation of the values of gain and loss (Tversky and
DEMO). Instead of postulating abstract cognitive heuristics, neuro-
economics explains loss-aversion DEMO the interaction of neural structures
involved in the anticipation, registration, and computation of the hedonic
affect of a risky decision. The amygdala, a structure involved in fear,
emotional learning and memory modulation, registers the emotional
impact of the loss; the ventromedial prefrontal cortex predicts that a loss
will result in a given affective impact; and midbrain dopaminergic neurons
compute the probability and magnitude of the loss (Naqvi, Shiv, and
Bechara; Tom et al.). Subjects are thus loss-averse because they tend to
have or already had a negative response to losses (experienced utility).
When they expect a loss to occur (decision utility), they anticipate their
affective reaction (predicted utility). They might be also attempting to
minimize their post-decision feeling of regret (remembered utility).
Similar researches can also illuminate ambiguity-aversion. In many
experimental settings, subjects have a strong preference for risky prospects
(those for which the probabilities are known) DEMO ambiguous one (those
for which the probabilities are unknown). For DEMO, let’s imagine two
decks of 20 cards. There are 10 red DEMO and 10 blue cards in the first
one (risky deck), DEMO there is an unknown proportion of blue to red
cards in the second one (ambiguous deck). Agents win $1 each time they
pick a red card. Despite a 50 –50 chance of winning in both DEMO, subjects
have a marked preference for the risky deck. According to DEMO
theory, there is no reason to prefer one deck to another, but neuroeconomic
studies showed that in this case of decision under ambiguity, a stronger
activation is found in many areas, especially the amygdala (DEMO et al.).
Although decision theory treats ambiguity as a special case of risky
decision-making, ambiguous and risky decision-making are supported by
two distinct mechanisms. It thus seems that ambiguity-aversion happens
because people have a stronger DEMO affective reaction to ambiguity
than risk.

One of the most robust finding in neuroeconomics concerns decision
utility, the calculation of cost and benefits. According to many findings,
this process is realized by DEMO systems, a network of structures
in ‘older’ brain areas highly involved DEMO motivation and valuation
(Montague and Berns; Berridge). Dopaminergic neurons respond
selectively to prediction errors, either the presence of unexpected rewards
or the absence of expected rewards. In other words, they detect the
discrepancy between predicted and experienced utility. Moreover,
dopaminergic neurons learn from their mistakes: they learn to predict
future rewarding events from prediction errors, and the product of this
learning (a ‘behavioral policy’) can then bias action DEMO Computational
neuroscience identifies a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that
mirror the activity of dopaminergic activity (Niv, Duff, and Dayan; Suri
and DEMO). It is suggested that dopaminergic neurons broadcast in
different brain areas a reward-prediction error signal similar to those
displayed by temporal difference (TD) algorithms developed by computer
scientists (Sutton and Barto, ‘Temporal-Difference Model of Classical
Conditioning’; Sutton and Barto Reinforcement Learning). These algorithms
are plausible descriptions of neural mechanisms of decision-making imple-
mented in dopaminergic systems. They DEMO not only involved in basic
reward prediction, such as food, but also with abstract stimuli like art,
brands, love or trust (DEMO, King-Casas, and Cohen 420).
It might seem unusual to understand decision-making from a reinforce-
ment learning perspective. However, reinforcement learning is not
stimulus-response association analogous to classical behaviorism, but is
rather the learning of ‘how to map situations to actions . . . so as to DEMO
a numerical reward signal’ (Sutton and Barto Reinforcement Learning 3).
DEMO learning like TD entails prediction: prediction is a cognitive,
computational DEMO, not a behavioral one like association. Reinforcement
learning, as Selten once noted (16), is thus a basic mode of behavior that
cannot be ignored by a theory of rationality.
The main contribution of neuroeconomics DEMO decision theory so far is
a new picture of decision-makers as adaptive and affective agents. Homo
Neuroeconomicus is a fast decider that relies less DEMO logic and more on a
complex collection of flexible neural circuits associated with affective
responses. Everyday utility maximization is more about feelings and less
DEMO the objective outcome of a decision: we use emotions to anticipate
DEMO in order to control our behavior toward a maximization of
positive emotions and a minimization of negative ones. The neuroeconomic
picture of individual rationality DEMO thus affective through and through.
2.2. HOMO NEUROECONOMICUS playing games
Neuroeconomics also provides new insights into the nature of strategic
rationality. Here, the results suggest that strategic decision-making is again

a highly affective business. Brain scans of people playing the ultimatum
game indicate that unfair DEMO trigger, in the responders’ brain, a ‘moral
disgust’: the anterior DEMO (associated with negative emotional states like
disgust or anger) is more active when unfair offers are proposed (Sanfey
et al.). Subjects experience this affective reaction to unfairness only when
the proposer is a human DEMO: the activation of the insula is significantly
lower when the proposer DEMO a computer. Moreover, this activation is
proportional to the degree of DEMO and correlated with the decision
to reject unfair offers (Sanfey et DEMO 1756). Beside the anterior insula, two
other areas are recruited DEMO ultimatum decisions: the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (hereafter DLPFC), involved in cognitive control and goal
maintenance, and the anterior cingulate cortex, involved DEMO cognitive
conflict and emotional modulation. When an offer is fair, it DEMO normal
to accept it: there is a monetary gain and no DEMO feelings. When the
offer is unfair, however, the brain faces a dilemma: punish the unfair
proposer, or get a little money? The final decision depends on whether
the DLPFC or the anterior insula ‘wins’: Sanfey and his colleagues found
that the anterior insula is more active DEMO rejections, while the DLPFC is
more active in acceptances. The ACC, itself more active when offers are
unfair, behaves as a moderator between the cognitive goal (more money)
and the emotional goal (punishing)DEMO Deciding to accept or reject an offer
in the ultimatum game is a complex adjustment between multiple goals
and values, a complexity that decision theory or the belief-desire model
can hardly account for.
Other studies indicate DEMO in similar games where cooperation is
common but unexpected by game theory, players enjoy cooperating, what
economists refer to as the ‘warm glow DEMO giving’ (Andreoni). In the
prisoner’s dilemma, players who initiate and players who experience
mutual cooperation display activation in nucleus accumbens and other
DEMO areas (Rilling et al.). In the trust game, where cooperation
is common but not prescribed by game theory, players are ready to lose
money for punishing untrustworthy players. De Quervain et al. found that
DEMO punishing cheaters and anticipating this punishment activate the
nucleus accumbens, suggesting DEMO ‘revenge tastes sweet’ (de Quervain
et al.). It follows that DEMO, trust, and cooperation are common because
they have an intrinsic value: even donating to societal causes elicits the
same rewarding effect (Moll DEMO al.).
When humans interact with computers, however, these social emotions
disappear. In all the aforementioned experimental games, human and
computer partners do not elicit the same neural-affective reactions
(Rilling et al.). Human partners induce positive or negative emotions,
while computer partners induce much less DEMO reactions. Since
computers do not entertain moral values, cultural norms, and social
emotions like normal flesh-and-bone individuals do, they do not feel the
‘warm glow’ of cooperation, the ‘sweet taste’ of revenge or the ‘moral

disgust’ of unfairness. Consequently, a selfish attitude toward an emotionless
machine is not seen as morally dubious, just as we do not feel cheated by it.
To sum up, social neuroeconomics shows that money is not the only
currency in social exchange. A one-dollar gift is pleasurable, but a
one-dollar offer in the ultimatum game elicits negative reaction if the
proposer is a human.
DEMO Neuroeconomics and Irrationality
Studies in neuroeconomics are apt to provide meaningful explanations for
choice behavior. Loss-aversion and cooperation, oddities from the
rational-choice theorist point of view, now make sense as patterns of
inference and behavior that follow naturally from the affective dynamics
of decision-makers. If rationality is a DEMO, evaluative concept, one
might argue that a theory of decision-making mechanisms can hardly
draw a distinction between rational and irrational decisions. Or can DEMO?
Classical models of rationality in fact suffer from the exact same problem.
As Sen observed, every choice is said to reveal preferences:
The reduction of man to a self-seeking animal depends in this approach DEMO
careful definition. If you are observed to choose x rejecting y, DEMO are declared
to have ‘revealed’ a preference for x over y. Your personal utility is then defined
as simply a numerical representation of this DEMO, assigning a higher
utility to a ‘preferred’ alternative. With this set DEMO definitions you can hardly
escape maximizing your own utility . . . (322)
Philosophical theories of rationality that consider rational all those actions
explained by beliefs and desires also face this problem. Whatever theory
one DEMO choose, a decision can always be described as the product of
DEMO reasoning, whereby the agent infers a choice from her beliefs and
DEMO desires. This problem is not specific to neuroeconomics.
In order to escape a tautological account of rationality, it is important
to distinguish external and internal assessment of rationality. An external
assessment of rationality is an evaluation DEMO the effectiveness of a rule or
procedure. It assesses the optimality of rules in achieving certain goals. An
internal assessment of rationality is an DEMO of the coherence of
intentions, actions, and plans. An action can hence be rational from the
first perspective but not from the second DEMO, and vice versa. Gambling,
for instance, can make sense only from the gambler’s point of view:
despite knowing that the odds DEMO against her (thus externally irrational,
if the goal is money DEMO), she trades losses (decision utility)
against the pleasurable feeling DEMO gambling (experienced utility).
The same reasoning can also apply to DEMO mechanisms discovered by
neuroeconomics. Once precise mechanisms are spelled out, their DEMO
can be evaluated (external perspective) and their coherence made explicit
(DEMO perspective). From an external perspective, TD algorithms

plausibly represent decision-making processes (Montague), both from a
descriptive and a normative point of view. Descriptively, TD models
closely mimic human, monkey, and bee choices (Montague et al.;
Glimcher, Dorris, and Bayer; Egelman, Person, and Montague). Norma-
tively, these models achieve good performance in DEMO that require
information-processing under uncertainty, such as Backgammon, spatial
delayed response tasks, and autonomous robot navigation (Suri and
Schultz; Perez-Uribe). In the same vein, making a fair offer in the
ultimatum game is also a good strategy: offering a $5/$5 split entails a sure
gain of $5, while offering a $1/$9 entails a sure loss. Therefore, from the
external perspective, the optimality of neural mechanisms can DEMO assessed,
and careful studies can draw a distinction whether, in DEMO particular
environment, such-and-such mechanism is effective. TD-learning, for
instance, is DEMO under radical uncertainty, but is beaten by classical
rationality under risk.
DEMO an internal perspective, neuroeconomics studies show how
externally irrational choices can DEMO internally rational. Loss-aversion and
ambiguity-aversion are not optimal under decision theory, DEMO neuroeco-
nomics shows that loss- and ambiguity-averse subjects are rational in the
internal sense, because they try to minimize negative feeling (elicited by
DEMO activation). In this sense, it can be rational to maximize DEMO
enced utility, based on predicted utility. Loss-aversion can also be
internally DEMO because preferring a sure decision is a way to minimize
the painful feeling of loss and the post-decision feeling of regret. Various
studies indicate DEMO a loss of money can elicit negative emotional response
(Delgado, Labouliere, and Phelps), and that avoiding an aversive event can
generate rewarding signals in the orbitofrontal cortex (Kim, Shimojo, and
Doherty). A loss-averse agent maximizes experienced utility before, during
and after decision. Similarly, DEMO in the ultimatum game and prisoner’s
dilemma also behave rationally: they DEMO positive feelings by being
fair and minimize negative ones by avoiding or punishing unfairness. A
responder (in the ultimatum game) accepting an unfair DEMO would expe-
rience moral disgust, and would be happier from punishing DEMO unfair
proposer than from accepting the offer. One of the strengths of neuro-
economics is a more accurate description of subjects’ preferences: instead of
inferring preferences solely from behavior, imaging, and lesion studies
allow inferences DEMO brain functioning.
Are agents hence always internally rational? As Davidson suggested,DEMO
assessments of irrationality require partitioning the mind into subparts
with a high degree of internal structures, potentially causing genuine
internal conflict between values, DEMO, or motivations (Davidson,
‘Problems of Rationality’). Explanations of practical irrationality such as
akrasia (not acting on one’s own best judgment about what to do) reveal
conflicting motivations: I want to finish my DEMO, I know it is the
best thing to do, but instead I watch Casablanca on TV, even though I

Decision-Making
know it is not the best decision. With the distributed account of utility,
one might DEMO several ways to be irrational. A perfectly rational agent
would be an agent whose decision, predicted, experienced, and remembered
utility would always be in agreement. Any mismatch between these types
of utility could be a DEMO of irrationality, and neuroeconomics could
describe the interactions between different utility-maximization DEMO
nisms. When decision utility is higher than predicted utility, for instance,DEMO
some mechanisms inside the agent value the outcome of the decision
more highly than others that predict an inferior utility. Drug addiction
works exactly DEMO the lines of this ‘irrational pursuit’ (Berridge):
dopaminergic neurons ‘hijacked’ by drugs overvalue the drug rewarding
effect, even if prefrontal areas involved in affective prediction do not
anticipate a positive hedonic effect. This interaction DEMO different
processes may explains why addiction often seems internally irrational (its
DEMO irrationality is more obvious). John Cheever’s narration of his
alcoholism in his Journals illustrates the incoherence between decision and
utility, both predicted and experienced: ‘[d]rink, its implements, environ-
ments, and effects all seem DEMO And yet each noon I reach for the
whiskey bottle’ (54)DEMO In his case, although the decision utility of drinking
does not DEMO with its predicted and experienced utility, these two
types of utility DEMO here in agreement: Cheever both anticipates and
experiences disgust. In other DEMO, we are irrational when predicted and
experienced utility mismatch. Gilbert and DEMO coined the term
‘miswanting’ to describe the shortcomings of affective forecasting (DEMO
prediction of emotional impact). A perfectly rational agent, at time DEMO,
would choose to do X at t + 1 given what she expects her future valuation
of X to be. Many studies showed DEMO that people are subject to many
biases that cause miswanting. For instance, people overestimate the length
or intensity of the emotional impact of negative events: they recover from
tragic incidents faster than they anticipated, and DEMO used to pleasant
effects. For instance, almost everybody imagines that being DEMO implies
being happier. Research in psychology indicates, to the contrary, that
[p]eople with above-average income are relatively satisfied with their lives but
are DEMO happier than others in moment-to-moment experience, tend to be
more tense, and do not spend more time in particularly enjoyable activities.
(Kahneman et al. 1908)
As of today, neuroeconomic research does not explain all these prediction
biases, but research progresses in this direction. For now, DEMO know that
neural circuits involved in affective forecasting are not the same as those
involved in experienced utility (Berridge). A thorough neuroeconomic
explanation of miswanting would show how certain mechanisms bias
affective forecasting and lead DEMO disappointment. As a matter of a fact,
neuroeconomics follow the Davidsonian conception of irrationality:
partitioning the mind in sub-personal circuits (Ross 45).

4. Conclusion
Philosophy, economics, and psychology have already analyzed and
enriched our conception of DEMO Neuroeconomics, while still
in its infancy, has already started to produce empirical results relevant to
philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, moral DEMO, and other
theoretical approaches of rationality. It can enrich the debate DEMO the
relevance of folk-psychological categories such as belief and desire; it
DEMO the idea that there cannot be a science of rationality; it DEMO
a causal-mechanistic account of decision-making; it shows that judgments
of value DEMO highly affective; and finally, it is a first step toward a naturalistic
account of rationality. By breaking down utility-maximization into
subspecies (experienced, DEMO, redicted, remembered), an by
identifying the brain processes and circuitry that maximize these types of
utilities, neuroeconomics offers a finer description of decision-making
than rational-choice theory or psychology alone. Neuroeconomics is a
fertile ‘trading DEMO (Thagard) for interdisciplinary exchange between
economics, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and computer science
in the years to come.

Short Biography
DEMO Hardy-Vallée is a postdoctoral fellow in the department of philosophy
at the University of Toronto. He completed his doctoral studies in
philosophy at the DEMO Jean-Nicod in Paris in 2006. He also studied at
the University of Quebec at Montreal. As a philosopher of science inter-
ested in cognitive DEMO, neuroscience, economics, and biology, his work
addresses interdisciplinary, normative, and descriptive issues related in
many ways to practical rationality and decision-making. DEMO actual
research focuses on naturalistic approaches of rationality and ‘natural
rationality’, DEMO is, the mechanisms by which humans and other
animals make decisions. DEMO recently edited ‘Cognitive Decision-Making:
Empirical and Foundational Issues’ (Cambridge Scholars DEMO), and
published articles on mental representations and cognition. His future
research will study the relationships between moral cognition and eco-
nomic rationality.
