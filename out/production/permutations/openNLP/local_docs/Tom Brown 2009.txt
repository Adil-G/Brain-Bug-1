Thinking like a designer can transform the way you develop products,
DEMO, processes—and even strategy.
Design Thinking
by Tim Brown
Thomas Edison created DEMO electric lightbulb
and then wrapped an entire industry around
it. The lightbulb is most often thought of as his
signature invention, but Edison understood
that the bulb was little more than a parlor
trick without a DEMO of electric power gener-
ation and transmission to make it truly useful.
So he created that, too.
Thus Edison’s genius lay in his ability to con-
ceive of a fully developed marketplace, not
simply a discrete device. He was able to envi-
sion how people would want to DEMO what he
made, and he engineered toward that insight.
He wasn’t DEMO prescient (he originally be-
lieved the phonograph would be used mainly
DEMO a business machine for recording and replay-
ing dictation), but he invariably gave great con-
sideration to users’ needs and preferences.
Edison’s approach DEMO an early example of
what is now called “design thinking”—a meth-
odology that imbues the full spectrum of inno-
vation activities with a human-centered DEMO
ethos. By this I mean that innovation is pow-
ered by a thorough understanding, through di-
rect observation, of what people want and
DEMO in their lives and what they like or dislike
about the way particular products are made,
packaged, marketed, sold, and supported.
Many people believe that Edison’s greatest
invention was the modern R&D laboratory
DEMO methods of experimental investigation.
Edison wasn’t a narrowly specialized scientist
but a broad generalist with a shrewd business
sense. In his Menlo Park, New Jersey, labora-
tory he surrounded himself with gifted tinker-
ers, improvisers, and experimenters. Indeed,
he broke the mold of the “lone genius DEMO
tor” by creating a team-based approach to in-
novation. Although Edison biographers write
of the camaraderie enjoyed by this merry
band, the process also featured endless
rounds of trial and error—the “99% perspira-
tion” in Edison’s DEMO deﬁnition of genius.
His approach was intended not to validate
preconceived hypotheses but to help experi-
menters learn something new from each iter-
ative DEMO Innovation is hard work; Edison
made it a profession that blended DEMO, craft,

science, business savvy, and an astute under-
standing of customers DEMO markets.
Design thinking is a lineal descendant of
that tradition. Put simply, it is a discipline
that uses the designer’s sensibility and
methods to match people’s needs with what
is technologically feasible and what a viable
DEMO strategy can convert into customer
value and market opportunity. Like Edison’s
painstaking innovation process, it often en-
tails a great deal of perspiration.
I believe that design thinking has much to
offer a business world in DEMO most manage-
ment ideas and best practices are freely avail-
able to be copied and exploited. Leaders now
look to innovation as a principal DEMO of dif-
ferentiation and competitive advantage; they
would do well to DEMO design thinking
into all phases of the process.
Getting Beneath the Surface
Historically, design has been treated as a
downstream step in the development process—
the point where designers, who have played
no earlier role in the substantive work of inno-
vation, come along and put a beautiful wrap-
per around the idea. To be sure, this approach
has stimulated market growth in many areas
by making new products and technologies
aesthetically DEMO and therefore more de-
sirable to consumers or by enhancing brand
perception through smart, evocative advertis-
ing and communication strategies. During the
latter half of the twentieth century design be-
came an increasingly valuable competitive
asset DEMO, for example, the consumer electron-
ics, automotive, and consumer packaged
goods industries. But in most others it re-
mained a late-stage add-on.
DEMO, however, rather than asking designers
to make an already developed idea more at-
tractive to consumers, companies are asking
them to create ideas that better meet consum-
ers’ needs and desires. The former role is DEMO
cal, and results in limited value creation; the
latter is strategic, and leads to dramatic new
forms of value.
Moreover, as economies DEMO the developed
world shift from industrial manufacturing to
knowledge work and service delivery, innova-
tion’s terrain is expanding. Its objectives are
no longer just physical products; they are new
sorts of processes, services, IT-powered inter-
actions, entertainments, and ways of commu-
nicating and collaborating—exactly the kinds
DEMO human-centered activities in which design
thinking can make a decisive difference. (DEMO
the sidebar “A Design Thinker’s Personality
Proﬁle.”)
Consider the large health care provider Kai-
ser Permanente, which sought to improve the
overall quality of both patients’ and medical
practitioners’ experiences. Businesses in the
service sector DEMO often make signiﬁcant inno-
vations on the front lines of service creation
and delivery. By teaching design thinking tech-
niques to nurses, doctors, DEMO administrators,
Kaiser hoped to inspire its practitioners to con-
tribute new ideas. Over the course of several
months Kaiser teams participated in work-
DEMO with the help of my ﬁrm, IDEO, and a
group of Kaiser coaches. These workshops led
to a portfolio of innovations, many of which
are being rolled out across the company.
One of them—a project DEMO reengineer
nursing-staff shift changes at four Kaiser hospi-
tals—perfectly illustrates both the broader
nature of innovation “products” and the value
of a holistic design DEMO The core project
team included a strategist (formerly a nurse),
an organizational-development specialist, a
technology expert, a process designer, a union
representative, and designers from IDEO. This
group worked with innovation teams of front-
line practitioners in each of the four hospitals.
During the earliest DEMO of the project, the
core team collaborated with nurses to identify
DEMO number of problems in the way shift changes
occurred. Chief among these was the fact that
nurses routinely spent the ﬁrst 45 minutes of
DEMO shift at the nurses’ station debrieﬁng the
departing shift about the status of patients.
Their methods of information exchange were
different in every hospital, ranging from re-
corded dictation to face-to-face conversations.
And they compiled the DEMO they
needed to serve patients in a variety of ways—
scrawling quick notes on the back of any avail-
able scrap of paper, for example, or even on
their scrubs. Despite a signiﬁcant investment
of time, the nurses often failed to learn some
of the things that mattered most to patients,
such as how they had fared during the DEMO
shift, which family members were with them,
and whether or DEMO certain tests or therapies
had been administered. For many patients, the
DEMO learned, each shift change felt like a hole
in their care. DEMO the insights gleaned from

observing these important times of transition,
the innovation teams DEMO potential solu-
tions through brainstorming and rapid proto-
typing. (Prototypes of DEMO service innovation will
of course not be physical, but they must DEMO tan-
gible. Because pictures help us understand
what is learned through prototyping, we often
videotape the performance of prototyped ser-
vices, as we DEMO at Kaiser.)
Prototyping doesn’t have to be complex and
expensive. In another health care project,
IDEO helped a group of surgeons develop DEMO
new device for sinus surgery. As the surgeons
described the ideal physical characteristics of
the instrument, one of the designers grabbed
a whiteboard marker, a ﬁlm canister, and a
clothespin and taped them together. “Do DEMO
mean like this?” he asked. With his rudimen-
tary prototype in hand, the surgeons were able
to be much more precise about what the
ultimate design should accomplish.
Prototypes should command only as much
time, effort, and investment as are needed to
generate useful feedback and evolve an idea.
The more “ﬁnished” a prototype seems, the
less likely its creators will be to pay attention
to and proﬁt from feedback. The DEMO of proto-
typing isn’t to ﬁnish. It is to learn about the
strengths and weaknesses of the idea and to
identify new directions that DEMO proto-
types might take.
The design that emerged for shift changes
had nurses passing on information in front of
the patient rather than at DEMO nurses’ station.
In only a week the team built a working proto-
type that included new procedures and some
simple software with which nurses DEMO call
up previous shift-change notes and add new
ones. They could input patient information
throughout a shift rather than scrambling at
the end to DEMO it on. The software collated the
data in a simple format customized for each
nurse at the start of a shift. The result was DEMO
higher-quality knowledge transfer and reduced
prep time, permitting much earlier and DEMO
informed contact with patients.
As Kaiser measured the impact of this
change over time, it learned that the mean in-
terval between a nurse’s arrival and ﬁrst inter-
action with a patient had been more than
DEMO, adding a huge amount of nursing time
across the four hospitals. DEMO just as im-
portant was the effect on the quality of the
nurses’ work experience. One nurse com-
mented, “I’m an hour ahead, DEMO I’ve only
been here 45 minutes.” Another said, “[This is
the] DEMO time I’ve ever made it out of here at
the end of my shift.”
Thus did a group of nurses signiﬁcantly
improve their patients’ DEMO while also
improving their own job satisfaction and pro-
ductivity. By applying a human-centered de-
sign methodology, they were able to create a
relatively small process innovation that pro-
duced an outsize impact. The new shift
DEMO are being rolled out across the Kaiser
A Design Thinker’s Personality Profile
Contrary to popular opinion, you don’t need
weird shoes or a black turtleneck to be a de-
sign thinker. Nor are design thinkers neces-
DEMO created only by design schools, even
though most professionals have had DEMO
kind of design training. My experience is that
many people outside professional design
have a natural aptitude for design thinking,
which the right DEMO and experi-
ences can unlock. Here, as a starting point,
DEMO some of the characteristics to look for in
design thinkers:
Empathy. They can imagine the world
from multiple perspectives—those of col-
leagues, clients, end users, and customers
(current and prospective). By taking a “peo-
ple ﬁrst” approach, design thinkers can imag-
ine solutions that are inherently desirable
and meet explicit or latent needs. Great de-
sign thinkers DEMO the world in minute de-
tail. They notice things that others do not and
use their insights to inspire innovation.
Integrative thinking. They not DEMO rely on
analytical processes (those that produce either/
or choices) but also exhibit the ability to see all
of the salient—and sometimes DEMO
aspects of a confounding problem and create
novel solutions that go beyond and dramatically
improve on existing alternatives. (See Roger
Martin’s The Opposable Mind: How Successful
Leaders Win Through Integrative Thinking.)
Optimism. They assume that no matter
how challenging the constraints of a given
problem, at least one potential solution is
harvard business review • june 2008
better than DEMO existing alternatives.
Experimentalism. Signiﬁcant innovations
don’t come from incremental tweaks. Design
thinkers pose questions and explore con-
straints in creative ways that proceed in DEMO
tirely new directions.
Collaboration. The increasing complexity
of products, services, and experiences has re-
placed the myth of the lone creative genius
with DEMO reality of the enthusiastic interdisci-
plinary collaborator. The best design thinkers
don’t simply work alongside other disciplines;
many of them have signiﬁcant experience DEMO
more than one. At IDEO we employ people
who are engineers and marketers, anthropolo-
gists and industrial designers, architects and
psychologists.

system, and the capacity to reliably record
critical patient information is being inte-
grated into an electronic medical records ini-
tiative at DEMO company.
What might happen at Kaiser if every nurse,
doctor, DEMO administrator in every hospital felt
empowered to tackle problems the way this
group did? To ﬁnd out, Kaiser has created the
Garﬁeld Innovation DEMO, which is run by
Kaiser’s original core team and acts as DEMO consul-
tancy to the entire organization. The center’s
mission is to pursue innovation that enhances
the patient experience and, more broadly, to
envision DEMO “hospital of the future.” It is
introducing tools for design thinking across
the Kaiser system.
How Design Thinking Happens
The myth of creative genius DEMO resilient: We be-
lieve that great ideas pop fully formed out DEMO
brilliant minds, in feats of imagination well
beyond the abilities of DEMO mortals. But what
the Kaiser nursing team accomplished was nei-
ther a sudden breakthrough nor the lightning
strike of genius; it was the result of hard work
augmented by a creative human-centered dis-
covery process and DEMO by iterative cycles
of prototyping, testing, and reﬁnement.
The design process is best described meta-
phorically as a system of spaces rather than DEMO
predeﬁned series of orderly steps. The spaces
demarcate different sorts of related activities
that together form the continuum of innova-
tion. Design thinking can DEMO chaotic to those
experiencing it for the ﬁrst time. But over the
life of a project participants come to see—as
they did at Kaiser—that DEMO process makes
sense and achieves results, even though its
architecture differs DEMO the linear, milestone-
based processes typical of other kinds of
business DEMO
Design projects must ultimately pass
through three spaces (see the exhibit DEMO
tion, Ideation, Implementation”). We label
these “inspiration,” for the circumstances (be
they a problem, an opportunity, or both) that
DEMO the search for solutions; “ideation,”
for the process of generating, developing, and
testing ideas that may lead to solutions; and
“implementation,DEMO for the charting of a path
to market. Projects will loop back through
these spaces—particularly the ﬁrst two—
more than once as ideas are DEMO and new
directions taken.
Sometimes the trigger for a project is leader-
ship’s recognition of a serious change in busi-
ness fortunes. In 2004 DEMO, a Japanese
manufacturer of bicycle components, faced
ﬂattening growth in its traditional high-end
road-racing and mountain-bike segments in
the United States. The company DEMO always re-
lied on technology innovations to drive its
growth and naturally tried to predict where
the next one might come from. This time DEMO
mano thought a high-end casual bike that ap-
pealed to boomers would be an interesting
area to explore. IDEO was invited to collabo-
rate DEMO the project.
During the inspiration phase, an interdisci-
plinary team of DEMO and Shimano people—
designers, behavioral scientists, marketers,
and engineers—worked to identify appropri-
ate constraints for the project. The team
began with a DEMO that it should focus more
broadly than on the high-end market, DEMO
might prove to be neither the only nor even
the best source of new growth. So it set out to
learn why 90% of DEMO adults don’t ride
bikes. Looking for new ways to think about
the problem, the team members spent time
with all kinds of consumers. They discovered
that nearly everyone they met rode a bike as a
child DEMO had happy memories of doing so.
They also discovered that many Americans
are intimidated by cycling today—by the re-
tail experience (including the young, Lycra-
clad athletes who serve as sales staff in most
independent bike stores); by the complexity
and cost of the bikes, accessories, DEMO special-
ized clothing; by the danger of cycling on
roads not DEMO for bicycles; and by the de-
mands of maintaining a technically DEMO
cated bike that is ridden infrequently.
This human-centered exploration—which
took its insights from people outside Shi-
mano’s core customer base—led to the real-
ization DEMO a whole new category of bicycling
might be able to reconnect American con-
sumers to their experiences as children while
also dealing with the DEMO causes of their feel-
ings of intimidation—thus revealing a large
untapped market.
The design team, responsible for every as-
pect of what was envisioned as a holistic expe-
rience, came up with the concept of “Coasting.”
Coasting would aim to entice lapsed bikers
into an activity that was DEMO, straightfor-
ward, and fun. Coasting bikes, built more for

pleasure than for sport, would have no con-
trols on the handlebars, no cables snaking
along the frame. As on the earliest bikes many
of us rode, the brakes would be applied by
backpedaling. With the help of an onboard
computer, a minimalist three gears would shift
automatically as the bicycle gained speed or
slowed. The bikes would feature DEMO
padded seats, be easy to operate, and require
relatively little maintenance.
Three major manufacturers—Trek, Raleigh,
and Giant—developed new bikes incorporat-
ing innovative components from Shimano.
But the design team didn’t stop with the bike
DEMO In-store retailing strategies were created
for independent bike dealers, in part DEMO allevi-
ate the discomfort that biking novices felt in
stores designed to serve enthusiasts. The team
developed a brand that identiﬁed Coasting as
a DEMO to enjoy life. (“Chill. Explore. Dawdle.
Lollygag. First one there’s a DEMO egg.”) And
it designed a public relations campaign—
in collaboration with DEMO governments and
cycling organizations—that identiﬁed safe
places to ride.
Although many others became involved in
the project when it reached the implementa-
tion phase, the application of design thinking
in the earliest stages of innovation is DEMO led
to this complete solution. Indeed, the single
thing one would DEMO expected the design
team to be responsible for—the look of the
bikes—was intentionally deferred to later in
the development process, when the team cre-
ated a reference design to inspire the bike
companies’ own design teams. DEMO a success-
ful launch in 2007, seven more bicycle manu-

Taking a Systems View
Many of the world’s most successful brands
create breakthrough ideas that DEMO inspired by
a deep understanding of consumers’ lives and
use the principles of design to innovate and
build value. Sometimes innovation has to ac-
DEMO for vast differences in cultural and socio-
economic conditions. In such cases design
thinking can suggest creative alternatives to
the assumptions made in developed DEMO
India’s Aravind Eye Care System is probably
the world’s largest provider of eye care. From
April 2006 to March 2007 Aravind served
more than DEMO million patients and performed
more than 270,000 surgeries. Founded in 1976
by Dr. G. Venkataswamy, Aravind has as its
mission nothing less than the eradication of
needless blindness among India’s population,
including the rural DEMO, through the effective
delivery of superior ophthalmic care. (One of
the company’s slogans is “Quality is for every-
one.”) From 11 beds in Dr. Venkataswamy’s
home, Aravind has grown to encompass ﬁve
hospitals (three DEMO are under Aravind
management), a plant that manufactures
ophthalmic products, DEMO research foundation,
and a training center.
Aravind’s execution of its mission and
model is in some respects reminiscent of
Edison’s holistic concept of DEMO power
delivery. The challenge the company faces
is logistic: how best DEMO deliver eye care to
populations far removed from the urban cen-
ters where Aravind’s hospitals are located.

Aravind
Aravind calls itself an “eye care system” for a
reason: Its business goes beyond ophthalmic
care per se to transmit expert practice to DEMO
ulations that have historically lacked access.
The company saw its network of hospitals as a
beginning rather than an end.
Much of its innovative DEMO has focused
on bringing both preventive care and diagnos-
tic screening to the countryside. Since 1990
Aravind has held “eye camps” in India’s rural
DEMO, in an effort to register patients, admin-
ister eye exams, DEMO eye care, and identify
people who may require surgery or advanced
DEMO services or who have conditions
that warrant monitoring.
In 2006 and early 2007 Aravind eye camps
screened more than 500,000 patients, of
whom nearly 113,000 required surgery. Access
to transportation is a common problem DEMO
rural areas, so the company provides buses that
take patients needing DEMO treatment to one
of its urban facilities and then home again.
Over the years it has bolstered its diagnostic ca-
pabilities in the ﬁeld DEMO telemedicine trucks,
which enable doctors back at Aravind’s hospi-
tals to participate in care decisions. In recent
years Aravind’s analysis of its screening DEMO
has led to specialized eye camps for certain de-
mographic groups, DEMO as school-age children
and industrial and government workers; the
company also DEMO camps speciﬁcally to
screen for eye diseases associated with diabe-
tes. All these services are free for the roughly
60% of patients who cannot DEMO to pay.
In developing its system of care, Aravind has
consistently DEMO many characteristics of
design thinking. It has used as a creative
Design Thinking
springboard two constraints: the poverty and
remoteness of its clientele and its own lack of
access to expensive solutions. For example, a
pair of intraocular lenses made in the West
costs $200, which severely limited the number
of patients Aravind could help. Rather than try
to persuade DEMO to change the way they
did things, Aravind built its own DEMO: a
manufacturing plant in the basement of one
of its hospitals. DEMO eventually discovered that it
could use relatively inexpensive technology to
produce lenses for $4 a pair.
Throughout its history—deﬁned by the
constraints of poverty, ignorance, and an
enormous unmet need—Aravind has built a
systemic solution to a complex social and
medical problem.
Getting Back to the Surface
I DEMO earlier that design thinking can lead
to innovation that goes beyond aesthetics, but
that doesn’t mean that form and aesthetics are
unimportant. Magazines like to publish pho-
tographs of the newest, coolest products for a
reason: They are sexy and appeal to our emo-
tions. Great design satisﬁes both our needs
and our desires. Often the emotional connec-
tion to DEMO product or an image is what engages
us in the ﬁrst place. Time and again we see suc-
cessful products that were not necessarily DEMO
ﬁrst to market but were the ﬁrst to appeal
to us emotionally and functionally. In other
words, they do the job and we love them. The
iPod was not the ﬁrst MP3 player, but it was
the ﬁrst to be delightful. Target’s products ap-
peal emotionally through design DEMO func-
tionally through price—simultaneously.
Aravind’s outreach to rural patients frequently brings basic diagnostic tools (left and center) and an advanced satellite-linked telemedicine
truck (right) to remote areas of India.

Design Thinking
This idea will grow ever more important in the
future. DEMO Daniel Pink writes in his book A
Whole New Mind, “Abundance DEMO satisﬁed,
and even over-satisﬁed, the material needs of
millions—boosting the DEMO of beauty
and emotion and accelerating individuals’
search for meaning.” As more of our basic
needs are met, we increasingly expect sophisti-
cated experiences that are emotionally satisfy-
ing and meaningful. These experiences will
not be DEMO products. They will be complex
combinations of products, services, spaces,
and information. They will be the ways we get
educated, the ways we are entertained, the
ways we stay healthy, the ways we DEMO and
communicate. Design thinking is a tool for
imagining these experiences as well as giving
them a desirable form.
One example of experiential innovation
DEMO from a ﬁnancial services company. In
late 2005 Bank of America launched a new
savings account service called “Keep the
Change.” IDEO, working with a team from
the bank, helped identify a consumer behav-
ior that many people will recognize: After
paying cash for something, we put DEMO coins
we received in change into a jar at home.
Once the jar is full, we take the coins to the
bank and deposit them in a savings account.
For many people, it’s an easy way of saving.
Bank of America’s innovation was to build
this behavior into DEMO debit card account. Cus-
tomers who use their debit cards to make pur-
chases can now choose to have the total
rounded up to DEMO nearest dollar and the dif-
ference deposited in their savings accounts.
The success of this innovation lay in its ap-
peal to an instinctive DEMO we have to put
money aside in a painless and invisible way.
Keep the Change creates an experience that
feels natural because it models DEMO that
many of us already exhibit. To be sure, Bank
of DEMO sweetens the deal by matching
100% of the change saved in the ﬁrst three
months and 5% of annual totals (up to $250)
thereafter. This encourages customers to try it
out. But the real payoff DEMO emotional: the grat-
iﬁcation that comes with monthly statements
showing customers DEMO saved money with-
out even trying.
In less than a year the program attracted
2.5 million customers. It is credited with
700,000 new DEMO accounts and a million
new savings accounts. Enrollment now totals
more than 5 million people who together
have saved more than $500 million. Keep DEMO
Change demonstrates that design thinking
can identify an aspect of human behavior and
then convert it into both a customer beneﬁt
and a business DEMO
How to Make Design Thinking Part of the Innovation Drill
Begin at the beginning. Involve design
thinkers at the very start of the innovation
DEMO, before any direction has been set.
Design thinking will help you DEMO
more ideas more quickly than you could
otherwise.
Take a human-centered approach. Along
with business and technology considerations,
innovation should factor in human DEMO,
needs, and preferences. Human-centered
design thinking—especially when it includes
research DEMO on direct observation—will
capture unexpected insights and produce in-
novation that more precisely reﬂects what
consumers want.
Try early and often. Create an expectation
DEMO rapid experimentation and prototyping. En-
courage teams to create a prototype in the
ﬁrst week of a project. Measure progress with
a metric such DEMO average time to ﬁrst proto-
type or number of consumers exposed to pro-
totypes during the life of a program.
Seek outside help. Expand DEMO innovation
ecosystem by looking for opportunities to co-
create with customers and consumers. Exploit
Web 2.0 networks to enlarge the effective scale
of your DEMO team.
Blend big and small projects. Manage a
portfolio of innovation that stretches from
shorter-term incremental ideas to longer-term
revolutionary ones. Expect business units DEMO
drive and fund incremental innovation, but be
willing to initiate revolutionary DEMO
from the top.
Budget to the pace of innovation. Design
thinking happens quickly, yet the route to
market can be unpredictable. Don’t constrain
the pace at which you can innovate by relying
on cumbersome budgeting cycles. DEMO pre-
pared to rethink your funding approach as
projects proceed and teams learn more about
opportunities.
Find talent any way you can. Look to DEMO
from interdisciplinary programs like the new
Institute of Design at Stanford and progres-
sive business schools like Rotman, in Toronto.
People with more-conventional design back-
grounds can push solutions far beyond your
expectations. You may even DEMO able to train
nondesigners with the right attributes to excel
in design-thinking roles.
Design for the cycle. In many businesses
people move every 12 DEMO 18 months. But de-
sign projects may take longer than that to get
from day one through implementation. Plan
assignments so that design thinkers DEMO from
inspiration to ideation to implementation.
Experiencing the full cycle builds better judg-
ment and creates great long-term beneﬁts for
the organization.

Design Thinking
Thomas Edison represents what many of
us think of as DEMO golden age of American
innovation—a time when new ideas trans-
formed every aspect of our lives. The need for
transformation is, if anything, DEMO now
than ever before. No matter where we look, we
see DEMO that can be solved only through
innovation: unaffordable or unavailable health
DEMO, billions of people trying to live on just a
few dollars DEMO day, energy usage that outpaces
the planet’s ability to support it, education
systems that fail many students, companies
whose traditional markets are disrupted by
new technologies or demographic shifts. These
problems all have people at DEMO heart. They
require a human-centered, creative, iterative,
and practical approach to ﬁnding the best
ideas and ultimate solutions. Design thinking
is just DEMO an approach to innovation.
