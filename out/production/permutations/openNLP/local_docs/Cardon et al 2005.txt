Abstract
While most organizational theories avoid DEMO, many entrepreneurs act with emotion.
Entrepreneurs often describe their businesses as DEMO ‘‘babies,’’ expressing personal connection and
even identification with their businesses. We therefore suggest that through exploring associated
relational metaphors, we can gain additional insight into entrepreneurship. Specifically, we propose
that parenting, with its nurturance, passion, or even neglect or abuse, offers a particularly fruitful
metaphor DEMO examining entrepreneurship that may better resonate with entrepreneurs themselves than
does current theory. We examine various aspects of the progression of children and ventures, including
nascent forms of entrepreneurship (gestation of babies), emergence, and DEMO activities, and
highlight the ideas of passion, identification, attachment, and entrepreneurial context.

ship is often considered mysterious and sometimes even unknowable, the DEMO of
idiosyncratic individuals and random circumstances. In this paper, we seek DEMO make
entrepreneurship less mysterious and more congruent with our everyday experience. We
hope to do so by presenting a metaphor that likens the entrepreneurial DEMO to the
familiar social cycle of dating, commitment, and the bearing and raising of children.
Using this familiar metaphor, we present a more relational view of entrepreneurship than
currently exists in the literature. We suggest DEMO a relational metaphor can provide new
insight into our understanding of entrepreneurial activities such as opportunity search,
recognition and evaluation, start up and early business development. Such a metaphor
can also shed light on aspects DEMO entrepreneurship that seem illogical from the
hegemonic rational perspective, that is, cognitive biases that minimize risks (love is
blind), entrepreneurial persistence despite poor results (a parent never gives up), often
extreme devotion to the business entailing self-sacrifice and delayed gratification, and
the common problems of founder succession (separation anxiety) and overcontrolling
founders (parents).
These are areas that have received little attention in entrepreneurship, yet the adoption
of an ‘‘entrepreneurship as parent and child’’ metaphor may promote further under-
standing DEMO would-be entrepreneurs concerning the breadth and depth of experiences
that await them should they embark upon this process. In addition, using the parenthood
metaphor may enable entrepreneurial supporters such as venture capitalists or business
incubators to DEMO attention to the complex relationships in the entrepreneurial process,
and to help prepare nascent entrepreneurs for the challenges and emotions they are likely
DEMO face during the birth of their new venture. The metaphor highlights the importance of
strong emotions and deep identity connections between an entrepreneur and DEMO idea or
opportunity and the resulting business, which many people do DEMO fully understand until
they immerse themselves in the process. People often learn by metaphor since applying a
familiar schema or knowledge structure (Walsh, DEMO) to a new setting can help make
sense of that setting DEMO facilitate inductive reasoning. It is for this purpose that we
present this metaphor in such depth.
2. Introduction
Entrepreneurship is often considered mysterious and DEMO even unknowable, the
combination of idiosyncratic individuals and random circumstances. Researchers DEMO that
entrepreneurs are risk takers, gap fillers, and rugged individualists who are alert to
opportunities (Kirzner, 1973; Leibenstien, 1968; McGrath et al., 1992). Entrepreneurs
combine resources in novel ways, producing new DEMO, providing new services, generating
societal wealth, and creatively destroying industries (Drucker, 1985; Gartner, 1985; Schum-
peter, 1934; Venkataraman, 1997). Although we wholeheartedly agree that entrepreneurs may
have these traits and DEMO these outcomes, we feel these descriptors lead to a ‘‘heroic’’
portrayal DEMO entrepreneurship (Gartner, 1993), thereby failing to capture entrepreneurship’s
essence.

In this paper, we seek to make entrepreneurship less heroic DEMO mysterious and more
congruent with everyday experience (vicarious or actual). DEMO do so by exploring
relational metaphors of entrepreneurship that surface new perspectives for entrepreneurial
theory development. Specifically, we compare the experience of starting and growing a
new venture to the experience of giving birth to and DEMO a child. We suggest that
relational metaphors can provide new insight into our understanding of entrepreneurial
activities and shed light on aspects of entrepreneurship DEMO seem illogical from a rational
perspective, that is, cognitive biases that reduce the perception of risks (love may be
blind), entrepreneurial persistence despite poor results (some parents never give up, even
when perhaps DEMO should), often extreme devotion to the business entailing self-sacrifice
and delayed gratification, and the separation problems that sometimes accompany founder
succession. A parenting metaphor highlights the importance of passion (i.e., strong
emotions and enthusiasm) and identification (i.e., close association and connection)
between an entrepreneur DEMO a venture.
The metaphor takes some of the mystery out of entrepreneurship by grounding it in an
experience that most human beings have had—as DEMO parent, as a child, or both. By mapping
concepts from human relational domains to the entrepreneurship domain, we are in some
ways able to ‘‘describe the indescribable’’ and give people a visceral sense of what DEMO is to be
an entrepreneur (Lyddon et al., 2001).
3. Metaphors
Metaphor is a strong tool for communicating emotions and for surfacing DEMO
assumptions (Lyddon et al., 2001). People think in metaphors and become familiar with new
domains via metaphorical thinking (Lakoff and Johnson, DEMO; Gentner and Jeziorski, 1993),
since reasoning by analogy may DEMO to new insights in either a new or familiar setting
(Schon, 1993; Walsh, 1995). The use of a metaphor allows one DEMO map a familiar schema onto
a new domain and assess the fit of relationships between variables from one to another
(Wickman et al., DEMO), facilitating understanding in complex situations (Palmer and
Dunford, 1996). Metaphors may also capture experience and emotions better than literal
discourse (Palmer and Dunford, 1996) via compelling imagery and economical language
(Simons, DEMO).
Metaphor is often used for scientific theory generation and development (DEMO, 1993;
Gentner and Jeziorski, 1993; Kuhn, 1993). Even in the study of entrepreneurship, some
related metaphors are used repeatedly, DEMO example, biological metaphors in organizational
ecology. The specific use of biological DEMO in business and economics reaches back
seven decades when economists used Darwinian logic to explain the profit maximization
focus of the field by noting DEMO firms that did not maximize profit would eventually fail
(Marshall, 1925). Similarly within the management literature, organizational ecology
employs logic of variation–selection–retention where firms that are not able to identify
and employ successful variations DEMO selected out of the population (Aldrich, 1979; Baum,
1996; Hannan and Freeman, 1984).
26
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
Reflective of this use of biological metaphors in business and economics, entrepreneur-
ship scholars use birth metaphors in describing the formation of new organizations.
Nascent entrepreneurs (Carter et al., 1996), organizations in vitro (Hansen and Wortman,
1989), gestation (Alsos and Kolvereid, 1998), and business incubators are all terms from
the literature. Organizational ecology popularized the terms organizational ‘‘births’’ and
‘‘deaths,’’ and a birth metaphor maps DEMO onto consideration of ‘‘organizational
emergence.’’
Because metaphors shape the way we think and make some things salient while
‘‘disappearing’’ others (Schon, 1993), DEMO choice of metaphor is important. Gartner
(1993) has suggested that ‘‘the words we use to talk about entrepreneurship influence our
ability to think DEMO this phenomenon, and subsequent to these thoughts, direct actions
toward research that might be conducted on this topic’’ (p. 231). Most metaphors in
business and strategy are related to sports and war (Oliver 1999; Simons, 2001). Scholars
have also used rational machine metaphors (Youngblood, 1997) or made assumptions of
individualism, economic utility maximization, and DEMO orientation that strip away
considerations of emotions (Mangaliso, 2001). Traditionally, relational metaphors have
not been used by management scholars, and until DEMO, emotions have not received
significant scholarly attention in the management literature (Frost, 1999; Weick, 1999).
Even birth metaphors in the organizational literature have described mechanisms instead
of emotions and relationships.
We apply relational DEMO to entrepreneurship to highlight the importance of
emotions in entrepreneurial processes. Weick (1999) and Frost (1999) have argued
compellingly that theories that DEMO emotion move us and resonate with our day-to-
day experience. Gartner (DEMO) previously used a relational analogy for organizational
emergence, suggesting that establishing a new venture is like dating, while running a
business is more like being in an established relationship. He proposed that the sources of
DEMO in establishing a relationship are different than the sources of failure in an
established relationship, and that the academic literature on ‘‘falling in love’’ might offer
an appropriate model for organization emergence. We suggest that a DEMO metaphor
may offer additional insights in that it captures the entrepreneur’s creation and nurturing of
the (dependent) new venture and hints at notions DEMO passion, nurturance, and identification
(i.e., entrepreneurs may see their ventures as a part of their identity; its failure or success
reflects on the entrepreneur).
Parenthood as a metaphor for entrepreneurship is not new DEMO entrepreneurs, though
it has rarely been used by entrepreneurship scholars. Indeed, Dodd (2002) suggests that
the metaphors entrepreneurs use themselves are typically DEMO charged, and
include ideas of parenting, passion, lunacy, and iconoclasm. Entrepreneurs often
describe their businesses as their ‘‘babies,’’ speak in passionate DEMO about them,
and express identification with them. For example, in DEMO Eco-Shred business case
study, owner Greenspan was cited as having difficulty DEMO over control of his
company to his employee team because ‘‘Eco-Shred was Greenspan’s baby’’ (Hardy
and Heydon, 1999, p. 171). Even corporate ventures are often spoken of in parental
terms. For instance, a Sun spokesperson said: ‘‘Java was our little baby. [It] was very

27
hard to let go of its hand when it was taking its first steps.... It’s almost at the
adolescent stage. Maybe we should DEMO letting it walk a bit more on its own.’’
(Shankland, 2000).
In order to better understand the experience of entrepreneurship, we need to
understand the metaphors that entrepreneurs themselves use (Weick, 1999). DEMO suggest
that parenting’s passion, identification, and even overprotectiveness, or conversely,DEMO
neglect or abuse, offers a particularly fruitful metaphor for examining entrepreneurship
DEMO may better resonate with entrepreneurs themselves than does current theory. While
we recognize that metaphors rarely perfectly match reality, and may lead us to make
unwarranted assumptions and inferences (Pinder and Bourgeois, 1984), we DEMO to
make our assumptions explicit, and encourage expansion beyond these assumptions DEMO
future research. Metaphors make meaning for people because they tie new concepts to
familiar cognitive structures. They allow us to draw parallels and see DEMO we had
missed (Schon, 1993), exploring and expanding present experience into previously
unrecognized possibilities (Fox, 1989). In short, if entrepreneurs think of their
businesses as ‘‘their babies,’’ then we as scholars DEMO to think about entrepreneurship
in relational as well as economic terms, DEMO order to better understand entrepreneurs
and entrepreneurship.
4. The parenthood metaphor
In our parenthood metaphor, we explore preemergence stages of conception and
gestation and postemergence stages of infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, growth, and
maturity. In DEMO stages, we examine how parents (entrepreneurs) commit to
have a DEMO (venture) and may begin to prepare for the arrival of their babies during
pregnancy (nascent stages of entrepreneurship), often acquiring resources and obtaining
prenatal care from others (advisors, networks, or family). In postemergence stages, babies
and ventures are born and begin to grow. As the baby grows, parent and child may form
relationships with one another. Healthy relationships provide children with the resources
they need to thrive toward DEMO, whereas unhealthy relationships (poor attachment,
insufficient investment of time and resources, insufficient discipline, or conversely,
overcontrolling behavior) can limit the child’s emotional growth and create pathologies
that can survive through to adulthood. DEMO, founders can invest too little, fail to
develop disciplinary control systems, or overcontrol the venture so that the business is
crippled without the founder. We also explore positive exits for parents and entrepreneurs,
such DEMO when their child or business matures successfully to where intense parental
guidance is no longer needed.
A family/entrepreneurship dictionary is presented in Table DEMO, and implications of
taking a relational view of entrepreneurship are summarized DEMO Table 2. Although the
forthcoming discussion and accompanying tables are presented in a linear fashion for
presentation purposes, we recognize that entrepreneurship is often nonlinear, and suggest
particular instances where this nonlinearity may be most evident.

4.1. Preemergence
DEMO The parent
We compare a parent to an entrepreneur 1. In order for a child to be born, someone must
carry and bear the child, just as an entrepreneur must be present to bring forth a new
organization.2 As Gartner (1990, p. 18) points out, ‘‘In DEMO early days of the new enterprise,
the overall enterprise is not viable without the entrepreneur.’’ New combinations are launched
1 Just as many DEMO have more than one parent, many entrepreneurial ventures are founded and DEMO by
teams of entrepreneurs. Considerable work explores the dynamics of top management team (TMT) demographics
and interactions, as well as their influence on new venture survival and success (e.g., Hambrick and Mason, 1984;
Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996). For ease of discussion of the parenthood metaphor, we focus on the ‘‘parent’’ or
‘‘entrepreneur’’ without exploring the nuances of relational attachments of multiple founders.
2 In using a parenting metaphor, we do not imply any specific gender for the role of entrepreneur DEMO
organizational emergence. While it is true that a woman must give birth to a child, there is no such gender
requirement for being a parent of a child, or for birthing or nurturing an organization.

largely based on individuals’ visions, goals, motivations, and actions (e.g., McClelland, 1961;DEMO
Gartner, 1988), moderated by context (Aldrich, 1989; Bird, DEMO), and the venture is highly
dependent on the entrepreneur (Venkataraman, 1997). Similarly, in child development
research, a child’s actual growth DEMO development is influenced by genetics, the traits and
behaviors of the DEMO (de Vaus, 1992), and by contextual factors such as the availability of
sound health care pre- and postnatally (e.g., Adetunji, 2000; Matteson et al., 1998) and the
richness of the environment (DEMO, Stanislawa, 2000).
30 M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
We know of little research in how the construction of the role of ‘‘entrepreneur’’ in a
social context impacts the incidence and quality DEMO entrepreneurship, but it is likely that
differences in the incidence and DEMO of entrepreneurship in various contexts are related to
the role construction of entrepreneurs. This may develop from individual role models of
entrepreneurship in the DEMO (Krueger, 1993; Scott and Twomey, 1988), parental roles in
the context of the culture or social strata in which we are DEMO (Kaplan, 1992),or
from the spread of entrepreneurship educational programs (Brush et al., 2002). These role
models and programs may not only help individuals become better entrepreneurs, but may
also simply disseminate the notion that starting a business is possible to a broader
population of DEMO
4.1.2. Conception
Conception is the beginning of pregnancy, or in our DEMO, the commitment or intention to
start the venture. Before a child DEMO venture is born, it must be conceived. The parent(s) may
desire to have a baby, plan for it in advance, imagine DEMO for it, and spend a good deal
of time in preparation. DEMO other times, children are conceived by accident, and the parent(s)
must adapt to the reality of conception. Some parents see the DEMO as a happy one, some
may choose to terminate a pregnancy, while others may feel ambivalent or unhappy about the
pregnancy, but see little choice but to bear the child. Similarly, entrepreneurs may plan to start
business ventures and search for venture opportunities (Herron and Sapienza, DEMO), they
may stumble upon attractive opportunities that they were not seeking (Long and McMullan,
1984; Bhave, 1994), or they may feel pushed into entrepreneurship by circumstances, such as
the loss of a job or the lack of other opportunities. Regardless of the path, in order for a child/
venture to be born, a parent or entrepreneur must undergo a gestation period.
This relational view raises questions regarding DEMO commitment to and passion for the child/
venture may vary in different cases. The individual who actively seeks to conceive a child or
DEMO opportunity may be more highly committed or have greater passion for the child/
venture once it has been conceived. An interesting question for DEMO study is whether
individuals that appear to have little choice in the matter (e.g., accidental pregnancies or ‘‘push’’
entrepreneurship) experience lower commitment to or passion for their children or ventures.
4.1.3. Gestation
Gestation in both DEMO and entrepreneurship is a period prior to birth during which
resources are acquired to support the growth and development of the nascent form. For
DEMO, gestation involves start-up activities such as applying for a business name DEMO
permit, selecting a site, obtaining financing, negotiating supply arrangements, developing
marketing plans, obtaining advice from lawyers, accountants, and others, and DEMO making a
sale.
The commitment level of parents or entrepreneurs may affect the level and timing of
resource acquisition. An early passionate commitment to DEMO baby (venture) may enhance
survival chances if the parent (entrepreneur) takes the necessary steps to nourish and secure
the nascent form. For DEMO, women who refrain from smoking and drinking, eat a
balanced diet, get appropriate exercise and rest, and obtain quality prenatal care may DEMO

infant morbidity (Mayseless and Scher, 2000). A similar relationship is likely to hold with
entrepreneurs and their ventures. Entrepreneurs often bring DEMO start-up experts (e.g., advisors,
consultants, accountants, and lawyers) DEMO may even take courses or consult books on how to
start a new business. While birth (start-up) is possible without this care from DEMO, the
prenatal period and birth of the venture may be more DEMO and less risky with them.
Parents and entrepreneurs will vary in the amount of prenatal support they seek, as well as in
the amount and quality that are available or affordable, which will affect their success and
comfort during this prenatal period. The difference between first-time entrepreneurs with DEMO
initial resource endowments and established firms with comparatively large and varied
resource endowments may be very important in this stage. For example, new entrepreneurs,
like young or low-income parents, have a much larger need to acquire necessary resources
from other parties, while established firms, experienced entrepreneurs, or late-in-life parents
with potential savings from steady income, may already possess most of the required
resources, including experience.
Just as friends and family offer moral support, advice, loans and gifts to the new parents, so
too do members of the entrepreneurs’ network. The relative wealth and DEMO of
network members will, in part, determine the level of resources available to the entrepreneur
(e.g., Cromie and Birley, 1992). The community also matters: the local health care environ-
ment mediates some maternal risk factors for infant mortality (Matteson et al., 1998), just DEMO
business incubators and community economic development climates influence business
survival rates. Strong feelings of identification with the venture may lead entrepreneurs to
be less DEMO to accept help from outsiders, in an effort to protect their DEMO influence and
control over the venture, while weak feelings of identification DEMO lead entrepreneurs to not
bother seeking help. We expect that at more moderate levels of identification, entrepreneurs
may be willing to seek and accept advice if it is available. The association between
entrepreneurial identification and willingness DEMO seek help may also vary based on entrepre-
neurs’ personality traits or cognitive schemas.
4.1.4. Timing issues
While the biological aspects of gestation follow DEMO set sequence with established time
frames, the relational aspects may not. DEMO parents begin to acquire resources as soon as
conception occurs, while DEMO proceed more tentatively. They may be busy with other
things and put off buying a crib, taking prenatal classes, and choosing a name. DEMO they may
fear miscarriage, and postpone their feelings of attachment to DEMO growing baby until birth
looks more certain. Similar to parents, resource DEMO for a new venture does not
necessarily follow a sequential process (DEMO et al., 1996). Parents and entrepreneurs can
acquire resources from DEMO networks during gestation (Aldrich et al., 1986; Cooper et al.,DEMO
1988) or once the new baby (venture) has emerged. Many DEMO and would-be
parents also begin acquiring resources before conception has even taken place, expanding
personal and business networks and building up social and financial capital long before a
specific venture or baby is actually under way. DEMO take time to create, with many
interrelated processes, each with different time demands that weave together and culminate
during organizational emergence (Bird, DEMO; Kamm and Nurick, 1993).
32
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
Unlike pregnancy, the duration of organizational emergence varies significantly across
DEMO and across individual entrepreneurs. Individuals differ in their need to plan before
acting. Therefore, organizational emergence processes may happen quickly and impulsively,
may take many years of meticulous planning, or may unfold somewhere between these two
extremes. In part, such differences may be due to the relative flexibility of entrepreneurs.
Young, first-time parents might be more impulsive than more mature ones, who may be
subject to more restrictions on their actions. For example, older parents may have built up
more financial wealth before having a child, but may find it more difficult to adapt their
personal routines, such as sleeping in or leisurely reading the newspaper, DEMO the demands of an
infant. Similarly, an established firm may well DEMO more financial and skill resources to
invest in a start-up subsidiary, DEMO may be constrained by complex resource configurations
and political structures (e.g., Aldrich and Auster, 1986) causing resistance to new combina-
tions within DEMO firm.
The successful culmination of gestation activities is, of course, birth. Birthing a baby or a
venture is often described as both painful DEMO exciting, usually involving significant effort
from the parent/entrepreneur as well DEMO assistance from others. The conclusion of the process
signifies a phase shift in entrepreneurship/parenthood: movement to the post emergence
stages of infancy, DEMO by the growth and development of the child/venture to maturity.
4.2. Postemergence stages
4.2.1. Infancy and toddlerhood
After birth occurs, the new baby (venture) is often in a vulnerable state and requires special
care DEMO nurturance. In this newborn stage, there are greater threats to the DEMO to reach full
maturity. This is especially true if birth was premature, with emergence occurring before
enough resources were acquired or before enough development occurs. For premature births,
incubation is often required for both babies DEMO new ventures. This incubation, whether
through high-technology intensive care units or DEMO incubators, provides extra assistance
needed for those babies and firms to DEMO viability. Even when prematurity is not a factor,
newborn babies and firms have very special needs and require constant and vigilant care.
Decisions DEMO this point have profound effects on the baby and the firm for the rest of their
lives. Again, there are noticeable differences in terms of an ability to care for a baby and
‘‘defend’’ its life DEMO resource-poor and resource-rich parents and entrepreneurs. This
vulnerable state in both new ventures and subunits of established organizations has been
referred to as the DEMO of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965; Venkataraman and Low, 1994).
It is in this newborn phase that attachment between parent and child may DEMO When
the child responds well to the parent, the parent’s attachment DEMO the child grows. This may
be accentuated when the child looks or acts like the parent or provides other cues to
strengthen identification. Parents DEMO are strongly attached to a child are likely to
empathize with their child’s feelings and sacrifice their own needs for the child’s,
intrinsically DEMO the child’s happiness and their role in it. Conversely, parents have
DEMO found to reject or even abandon their newborns when they are born with external
appearance impairments (Weiss, 1998). In fact, any cognitive dissonance between the
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) DEMO
33
expected and actual appearance of newborns may lead parents to reject their babies
(MacGregor, 1980; Salyer et al., 1985; Weiss, DEMO).
Similarly, entrepreneurs whose ventures respond well during start-up, launch, DEMO infancy
phases are likely to develop strong attachment to the ventures, DEMO if those ventures
provide cues that enhance the entrepreneur’s identification with them (e.g., the organization’s
culture matches the founder’s personality, or the organization’s product/service is one the
founder invented or is closely associated with)DEMO When an entrepreneur’s attachment is strong,
the entrepreneur is likely to respond to cues in the venture that others may not notice, feeling
every pain of the new venture, and taking every attack on it personally. Entrepreneurs may
sacrifice their own needs to meet the needs of DEMO ventures, persisting, delaying gratification,
and investing huge amounts of effort, emotion, and resources to ensure its healthy
functioning, knowing that the payoff is likely to be either years away, or more intrinsic than
extrinsic. Passionate parents may envision possibilities for their children and ventures that
DEMO do not see and work toward providing the best for them, DEMO when doing so entails
self-sacrifice. In our metaphor, the entrepreneurs’ passion DEMO the venture makes them willing
to commit to it and make the interests of the venture primary.
However, when attachment or identification is not strong, perhaps because the venture has
proven troublesome or preliminarily unsuccessful, DEMO entrepreneur may abandon the new
venture early. Early dissonance between entrepreneurial expectations and realities, as with
parental dissonance, may lead to dissatisfaction, disappointment, rejection, and abandonment
of the new venture. Furthermore, in both parenting and entrepreneurship, we recognize that
love may be blind. A parent or entrepreneur may be unable to scrutinize a child or venture
critically. The DEMO between being hopeful and having the doubts that parents might
experience is dispelled by creating idealistic images of the child (Murray and Holmes, DEMO).
Similarly, entrepreneurs have been found not to scrutinize their venture DEMO carefully, but
instead to act and figure things out as they DEMO (Crawford, 1980), often in an idealistic or
overconfident fashion (DEMO and Barney, 1997; Busenitz and Lau, 1996; Palich and
Bagby, 1995). Overconfidence may lead to unrealistic expectations that cannot be met, just as
when parents put their child on an unachievable pedestal.
On the other hand, overconfidence may allow entrepreneurs/parents to act with certainty in
uncertain situations (Busenitz and Barney, 1997), counteracting a natural DEMO toward
timidity in making choices (Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993). Overconfidence may also be a
self-fulfilling prophecy, in both personal relationships (Murray DEMO al., 1996) and entrepreneur-
ship (Busenitz and Barney, 1997; DEMO and Lau, 1996; Palich and Bagby, 1995). Children
and DEMO who are loved, believed in passionately, and given substantial attention may
flourish to become that which the parent sees and enacts (e.g., DEMO et al., 1992; Weick,
1995). Our relational view of entrepreneurship begs questions concerning the appropriate
balance of confidence and passion, whether entrepreneurs who are more deeply attached to
their ventures are more willing DEMO delay gratification, and if there is a limit to how long DEMO
are willing to delay.
Even when the young child or new venture survives the liabilities of newness, growth
may still be a question. Aldrich and Auster (1986) argue that survival and growth are
quite distinct. DEMO suggests that special care and nurturing are both important elements of
34 M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
an infant’s and new venture’s early lives, but still do DEMO ensure human or venture
success.
4.2.2. Childhood and adolescence
As toddlers and new ventures grow, they exert their need for independence and self-
determination. While parents train children in simple routines that they gradually begin to
DEMO on their own, children become exposed to other socialization mechanisms (e.g.,
school, peers, etc.), and may develop behaviors and routines DEMO are inconsistent with those
of their parents. Later, as children become DEMO, they desire more self-determination
and often feel that they are capable DEMO managing themselves. However, they occasionally find
themselves in crisis, or unable to handle a situation that arises. Parents can provide a safety
net DEMO rescue teens from misguided actions, provide discipline and advice to help DEMO
mistakes, or support the teens financially through their continued growth and DEMO
Similarly, organizations travel through stages of development (Greiner, 1972; Piaget, 2000;
Quinn and Cameron, 1983). As firms begin to DEMO, simple routines begin to replace
entrepreneurial action for recurring tasks. Firms DEMO start to show their own personalities as
employees contribute to the organizational culture, hired managers change practices and
routines, and other organizations influence DEMO firm. Firms gradually develop their own
institutionalized practices that are separate from the entrepreneur, and these personalities may
be similar or contrary to the entrepreneur’s wishes or expectations.
Similar to children entering adolescence, as firms mature, managers are able to exercise
some control, but often still want DEMO founder to guide them, to provide a safety net when
things DEMO wrong, and to support them with resources through growth and development. DEMO
strong relationships between entrepreneurs and their growing ventures can either facilitate or
prevent the transition to independence. If the entrepreneur is strongly attached to DEMO firm and
has difficulty in giving up some control, there are DEMO to be problems with the development
of independence. This can be problematic because as the firm grows, it is seldom possible for
the entrepreneur to know everything there is to know about the firm. Consequently, the
entrepreneur may be less able to deal with the cognitive load of DEMO making, and the
venture’s growth and development may be compromised. On DEMO hand, if entrepreneurs are
weakly attached, they may not devote the time and effort to the venture to act as the needed
guide DEMO safety net. Lack of discipline and control may lead to negative behavior among
both ventures and teens.
This relational view of entrepreneurship raises questions DEMO what a healthy level of
attachment to the venture is, and DEMO entrepreneurs can successfully give up some control
while still making sure the venture is appropriately guided. It may be that entrepreneurs who
identify strongly DEMO their ventures have difficulty delegating decision making. Do these
ventures have fewer rules and routines because they rely more on direct control by the
DEMO? How would this affect the venture’s growth and performance? Additionally,
examining factors that arrest life cycle stage development may be an interesting DEMO for
entrepreneurial research, just as it is for child development research. DEMO, it may be
interesting to examine premature evolution from one stage DEMO another (such as teen
parenthood) and related consequences.

4.2.3. Maturity
As the firm reaches full maturity, it is DEMO that it has been or will be separated from the
founding entrepreneur (empty nest), and become independent. This is a positive sign that the
firm has grown and prospered, exhibiting success for both the firm and the entrepreneur.
Similarly, children grow up and most move away from their parents to lead their own
independent lives. This, too, is DEMO sign of success for both child and parents. Even when
entrepreneurs no longer have daily operational control of their firms, many remain as chief
executive officers, or on the board of directors, serving as wise DEMO advisors with unique
insight into the firms. Likewise, although children usually DEMO from their parents when
they reach maturity (the chronological age of DEMO varies), many still seek advice from their
parents, believing them DEMO be trusted advisors with in-depth knowledge and history with the
child.
However, some parents (entrepreneurs) have problems with this separation. Gorodensky
(1997, p. 97) defines ‘‘momism’’ as a mother’s preoccupation with controlling her child(ren),
and an ‘‘excessive involvement of the mother and inappropriately prolonged dependence of
the child, preventing healthy separation.’’ The ‘‘momma’s boy’’ fails to mature fully when an
overcontrolling mother prevents him from meeting developmental challenges DEMO making his
own decisions (Gorodensky, 1997). Similarly, the entrepreneur DEMO insists on being involved
in every decision, and fails to delegate DEMO as the firm matures, may block the
development of systems, procedures, and human capital. This may result in founder
succession problems if the firm has insufficiently developed managers and systems to carry
on in the DEMO absence.
4.3. Adoption and foster care (entrepreneurial exit)
Some entrepreneurs DEMO starting businesses but not managing them. Habitual entrepre-
neurs tend to create many new ventures, each of which they may sell or pass off to
professional managers to operate. Similarly, some biological parents find themselves with a
baby they are unable or unwilling to nurture and put it DEMO for adoption or into foster care,
while others may even have their children taken away because of negligence or abuse.
Entrepreneurs may willingly DEMO over a new venture through sale to new owners who
become adoptive parents and focus on the firm’s persistence and growth. In other circum-
DEMO, venture capitalists or other investors may insist a professional manager take DEMO if
the founder is less suited to care for the business. Just as there is disagreement among
specialists about the consequences if children are DEMO for by someone other than the parent
(Chadwick and Heaton, 1999), there is disagreement regarding venture success with or
without the founder DEMO on at the helm. Additional research that focuses on the conditions
under which adoption, foster care, and entrepreneurial exit is appropriate—not only
financially DEMO rationally, but also in terms of relationships and emotional health—may
prove DEMO in resolving these debates.
Just as some adopted babies require parents with capabilities geared to that child’s needs,
businesses may need an adoptive DEMO with special capabilities or skills. As an example,
when David Carey assumed the care-taking role as the new publisher of SmartMoney, his
36
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
approach of proceeding carefully and conservatively was likened to that of a new dad
nurturing his offspring (Mirabella, 1993). David Carey DEMO an adoptive parent, since he did
not start SmartMoney himself, but he was a parent nonetheless, and he nurtured his new
‘‘baby.’’
4.4. Failures: miscarriages, birth defects, and infant mortality
Not all babies (DEMO) conceived are born, and some of those born die prematurely, DEMO
disabled, or fail to live up to their full potential. Thus, failure is a fundamental component of
both human procreation and entrepreneurship (McGrath, 1999). The influences leading to
these conditions may be internal, DEMO, or both, as was the case with the creation of the
Bandar Imam petrochemical complex in Iran. The creation of this complex was DEMO as a
difficult and painful birth due to ‘‘revolution, war, termination of the original joint venture
under which it was established, and US sanctions.’’ (Anonymous, 1989).
Exploration of the various points during the DEMO process at which failure can
occur may yield significantly greater insight than merely examining failures of organizations
that have already emerged. Hence, the study of organizational foundings or deaths does not
highlight founding attempts that did DEMO result in start-up (Katz and Gartner, 1988).
Entrepreneurship is not only the study of organization emergence, but also of failed attempts
to start new businesses (Learned, 1992) and even failed intentions or desires to start new
businesses (McGrath, 1999).
Taking a relational view DEMO entrepreneurship triggers the insight that we are changed by
failure. For example, Rosenblatt (2000) found that parents who have lost a child are
significantly more cognizant of the risks of loss with subsequent children, and they are more
vigilant and overprotective with those children. By analogy, perhaps entrepreneurs that have
previously failed are less overconfident than first-time entrepreneurs, as exploratory evidence
suggests (Zietsma, 1999). Whether this behavior is functional DEMO dysfunctional remains to be
seen.
The impact of prior failure on future entrepreneurship has not received significant
attention in the literature (see Cardon and McGrath, 1999, for an exception). Issues that
might be worth DEMO include what entrepreneurs do differently in ventures subsequent
to failed attempts, DEMO whether these changes lead to greater or less identification, passion,
DEMO success with the new venture. We hope that this metaphor will stimulate further work on
these issues.
5. Implications
So entrepreneurs are parents, and ventures are babies. What does it all mean and why do
we DEMO? It’s just a metaphor, and as mentioned Pinder and Bourgeois (DEMO) warned us that
using tropes can be dangerous because they rarely DEMO reality and lead us to all sorts of
unwarranted assumptions and inferences. Because we are scholars, we need to test the
boundaries of the metaphor to see where it holds and where it does not. We DEMO to make
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) DEMO
37
meaning for ourselves as entrepreneurship scholars, so that we can DEMO debating what it is we
study and put our creative energies toward studying it.
Entrepreneurship has been seen as a mystifying process. Some scholars DEMO say a theory
of entrepreneurship is unlikely to emerge because of the influence of chance and the
complexity of studying the confluence of entrepreneur, opportunity, and context. Thinking
about entrepreneurship in terms of parenting, attachment, and passion in some ways
normalizes the field, because these things are within the realm of most of our experience
(direct or vicarious). Both childbirth and venture creation involve strong emotions, deep
identity connection, DEMO often ‘‘irrational’’ persistence, for uncertain returns (Kuratko et al.,
1997). While the positive outcomes from these emotions have been touched on DEMO prior work
(strong commitment of entrepreneurs to their businesses, for example), the potential negative
results have been more often neglected. These are DEMO that have received little attention in
entrepreneurship, yet the adoption of DEMO ‘‘entrepreneurship as parent’’ metaphor may promote
further productive study. Using the parenthood metaphor may enable entrepreneurship
researchers to draw greater attention to more complex DEMO in the entrepreneurial
process and to understand these relationships more as entrepreneurs themselves do through
the language of personal relationships and attachments.
We summarize DEMO key interrelated ideas that emerge from the parenting metaphor that
can be usefully applied to entrepreneurship research: passion, identification and attachment,
nurturing DEMO the importance of context. We again refer to Table 2, which DEMO some
potential influences of relational variables and new research questions raised by exploring a
more relational view of entrepreneurship.
5.1. Passion
‘‘Passion inspires us DEMO work harder and with greater effect. The irony is that we hardly
notice our effort. It comes easily and enjoyably’’ (Chang, 2001). DEMO love and
passion for a venture leads to both functional and dysfunctional consequences. Passion
ensures that the entrepreneur persists in the face of difficulties DEMO keeps enthusiasm high
during the pursuit. The passion may also make it difficult to let go of the dream, however,
even when the venture performs poorly for a considerable length of time. Such persistence
can DEMO dysfunctional (Meyer and Zucker, 1989; McGrath, 1999). The blindness of love means
risks and difficulties may not be noticed, enabling more confident enactment of the venture.
Confident enactment may help to create a DEMO reality as resource providers are persuaded
by the confidence and as the entrepreneur puts in more effort, feeling sure it will be rewarded
(DEMO et al., 1992). Conversely, a lack of passion may lead to a failure of the venture to
thrive through a lack of DEMO and lack of faith on the part of the entrepreneur. The pursuit of a
passion is also much more fun for most people than DEMO away at a job they dislike
(Hackman and Oldham, 1976). Consequently, passionate entrepreneurship may carry with it
some nonmonetary rewards that help to offset what are usually sparse or nonexistent
monetary rewards in the DEMO days of the new venture. Material gratification can perhaps
thus be delayed. In contrast, if this passion is not present, then entrepreneurial attachment
DEMO suffer, leading to rejection or abandonment of the venture, as discussed above. A better
38
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
empirical understanding of the relationships between passion, satisfaction, and entrepreneu-
rial persistence may yield additional insights.
Another less positive perspective on passion DEMO that passion can be misguided with quite
detrimental effects. Consider terrorists, DEMO passionate beliefs in one’s calling indicates that
means justify the ends and everything is sacrificed for the cause, including lives if necessary.
In entrepreneurship, costs are often in relationships, but also include assets that are DEMO Many
entrepreneurs tell of spousal or parental relationships that suffer due to their overwhelming
dedication to their new business. In effect, escalation of commitment (Staw and Ross, 1978;
Isen and Baron, 1991) can DEMO from a passionate belief in the project, allowing one to reject
DEMO not even see disconfirming evidence (Kreiner, 1992), and to set aside all other relationships
or concerns in order to passionately pursue that DEMO goal. Thus, while passion can be
awesome and inspiring, it can also be hurtful to oneself and others. Questions concerning
when passion can DEMO enabling for entrepreneurs and when it is debilitating warrant further
exploration.
5.2. Identification and attachment
Passion in both entrepreneurship and parenting often leads to DEMO identification.
For example, bonding can create synchronization between parent and infant DEMO that the
parent appears to know what the infant is thinking, DEMO and needing despite the
baby’s limited ability to communicate. In both parenthood and entrepreneurship, there
are both functional and dysfunctional aspects to this identification and attachment. When
attachment is secure, parents can gradually give the baby more independence as the
baby is able to handle more. With insecure DEMO, however, we see pathologies
such as a tendency to overcontrol or overprotect the fledgling child/venture, an inability
to delegate care to others, and an inability to let go when it is time for the child/venture
to break free. This may be exacerbated when identification is DEMO, such as when a
child never leaves home. Research into the DEMO, or lack of it, between
entrepreneurs and their ventures may lead us to some valuable insights into entrepre-
neurship through exploring questions such DEMO the following: What leads to attachment
for entrepreneurs to their ventures? Is attachment stronger for first ventures/babies than
for subsequent ones? What implications does attachment have on performance or
persistence? Do planned ventures and babies thrive better than surprises (i.e., does the
carefully planned and DEMO venture outperform those started more spontaneously)?
Is attachment stronger when DEMO decisions are driven by ‘‘pull’’ factors instead of
by ‘‘push’’ factors?
5.3. Nurturing
Parenthood, as we depict it, and entrepreneurship both require DEMO kind of nurturing that
usually entails self-sacrifice and the willingness to put the baby/venture’s needs ahead of
one’s own, despite uncertain payoffs, DEMO far in the future. Because of the passion and
identification described above, nurturers can make these sacrifices, and maintain a long-
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) DEMO
39
term, future orientation, yet they may have difficulty letting go. When there is ambivalence
toward the child/venture, nurturing is likely to be impoverished, and failure may result.
However, questions related to this DEMO also arise, such as: Are entrepreneurs who have
a deeper attachment to their ventures more willing to delay gratification to nurture the
venture? What are the relationships between deeper attachments, nurturing behavior, and
venture DEMO?
Furthermore, as the business/child matures, its needs change. The astute nurturers will
understand this and will adapt their behavior to the DEMO of the child/venture. Research into
entrepreneurship must recognize that entrepreneurial ventures are at various stages of
maturity at any given time, and that simple chronological time since an official founding
date may not accurately reflect DEMO varied maturity or development. Failure to acknowledge
this muddies our vision and our results. Examining ventures that appear to suffer from
‘‘arrested development’’ or DEMO of adaptation towards maturity may be another interesting
direction for future research. Some questions in this area include the following: Do some
firms become arrested at specific developmental stages, crippling their growth? What
qualities of DEMO relationship between the entrepreneur and the firm are associated with
arrested development? What characteristics and qualities of the relationship are associated
with appropriate growth (e.g., successful delegation or succession)?
5.4. The importance of context
Finally, the parenthood metaphor raises some intriguing issues concerning the impor-
tance of context. If we tried to explain the behavior of children, we would automatically
include a consideration of the environment they grew up in, including the parenting
styles of their parents, the quality of the parent–child relationship, the influence of peers,
the influence of the parent’s network and social strata, and the influence of the culture
and community. The same is true for entrepreneurial ventures. Reasoning by analogy, we
see how important it is to take into consideration contextual factors when researching
emerging DEMO Simply understanding who the founder is and when the firm was
founded does not provide enough information to fully understand the development and
growth DEMO the venture. Instead, we advocate a more fine-grained perspective that
incorporates DEMO richness of contextual and cultural conditions that may be present in
the venture’s past, present, and future. Studies of entrepreneurial networks are one
DEMO of the kind of work we envision (Aldrich et al., 1986; Cromie and Birley, 1992;
Anonymous, 1989). Additional questions concerning context include the following: To
what extent do resource-rich environments contribute to entrepreneurial performance? Can
they compensate for inadequate parenting? Furthermore, the gradual character of the
deepening of commitment, the caring and nurturance through growth and emergence
phases, and the potentially deeply personal parent–infant bond is suggestive of the need
for high-touch, process-based research methods that entrepreneurship scholars may
develop as distinctive competencies.
Over each of these contexts, we can see that the parenthood–entrepreneurship analogy
may allow for some new perspectives and insights DEMO entrepreneurship. We have high-
40
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
lighted a few of these here, but we hope that DEMO metaphor will stimulate further insights
among other researchers.
6. Limitations
There are a number of boundary conditions that limit the applicability of our metaphor,DEMO
including issues of choice and timing, the depth of emotions experienced, and perhaps most
importantly, the culturally bounded view of parenthood that implicitly underlies our model.
We realize that parents assume different roles across different DEMO, and that children are
raised in quite varying familial, cultural, DEMO contextual environments (Chadwick and Heaton,
1999; McClelland, 1961). DEMO cultural roles and differences can influence the overall level
of entrepreneurial activity within a society (McClelland, 1961). However, this paper is not
about parenting roles across various cultures, varying family makeups, or gender DEMO
Nor are we suggesting that all parental paths are positive, nurturing, linear, or homogeneous.
While the authors’ experience of the parental role is based on North American cultural
perspectives, we recognize that both within this perspective and across others, there are
diverse ways to parent. Similarly, DEMO of entrepreneurship are likely to vary both within
and across cultures.
However, there remain underlying ideals of care, nurturing, and identification with
parenthood that seem to cross cultural boundaries. Not all parenting, nor all entrepreneurship,
lives up to these ideals. Therefore, while we present a nurturing view of parenthood in
demonstrating a more relational perspective on entrepreneurship, we are mindful that many
family situations are not nurturing and may be DEMO (Chadwick and Heaton, 1999). Not
everyone is a good parent, and not everyone can be a good entrepreneur. Accordingly, we
have DEMO to point out where a darker or more negative view may be possible or even
appropriate, and encourage additional inquiry towards expanding the metaphor presented here
to include other approaches and cultural views of parenthood.
While DEMO think there are essential elements of entrepreneurship and parenthood that are
similar across cultures (e.g., passion, identification, attachment, and nurturing), the degree of
each is likely to differ significantly. For example, there are some cultures where it is common
for babies to die because the DEMO is so impoverished. In these cultures, it is hard to
imagine DEMO parents become as attached to their children as in others, simply DEMO self-
protection. In cultures where male infants are prized and female infants are sometimes left to
die, we see behaviors that do not fit the Western idealized view of parenthood. Just as there is
variance in DEMO (Gartner, 1993) and parenthood even within cultures, there is
significant variance in both across cultures, and our arguments must be interpreted in that
light.
The third limitation of this metaphor concerns the issues of DEMO and timing. While
pregnancies and babies are all different, their development DEMO through fairly consistent
stages of progression. In contrast, processes of organizational DEMO may take highly
idiosyncratic paths to organizational birth (Kaufmann and Dant, 1999). Furthermore, an
entrepreneur can choose whether or not to act, the pace of movement, and can even circle
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) DEMO 41
back and change the initial idea. Parents cannot make as many fundamental choices about
an embryo’s development. However, they can make significant choices that impact the
ultimate health or performance of the child, such as whether or not to smoke, drink, wear a
seat belt, or seek prenatal care (if available). Thus, the emergence of a DEMO venture
involves significantly more choice and variance in the process and its timing than does
pregnancy. Once the baby is born, however, significant DEMO and choice may exist for
both parents and founders with respect to how the baby will be nurtured.
Furthermore, children that do not have their developmental needs met at early stages may
lose the opportunity to DEMO as fully functioning human beings forever, while a venture
may ramp DEMO quite quickly to a higher level of functioning after an infusion of resources. On
the negative side, there are many pathologies of parenthood and many cases of where parents
fail to act in the best interests DEMO their children, whether because they do not know any better,
DEMO because the cost is too high, or because they are apathetic DEMO malevolent towards their
children. Child abuse is unfortunately not rare (Chadwick DEMO Heaton, 1999), and while a
business may fail when abused DEMO its parent because of the influence of markets, children can
survive DEMO years in abusive environments with no outside intervention. An abused business
may also recover much more quickly than an abused child, suffering fewer residual effects
and more easily bouncing back when environmental conditions improve. Furthermore, a
venture may be less likely than a child to suffer from lingering DEMO problems from a
poor parent/child relationship after an adoptive parent takes over. We encourage additional
dialogue and research on how to usefully expand DEMO test the metaphor we present in this
paper by addressing these limitations.
7. Conclusions
‘‘Much of management theory is based on writings of early DEMO century Western
scholars ... who depict Homo sapiens as an individualistic, DEMO, trans-
action-oriented species. In contrast, recent scholarship ... has shown these to be invalid
models of human nature. Humans are social and communal DEMO Along with
rationality, they are guided by emotions such as anxiety, hope, disappointment, fear,
anger, excitement, pity, and remorse. By acknowledging the importance of emotions,
world management discourse can evolve more DEMO, inclusive, and emancipatory
theories’’ (Mangaliso, 2001, p. 23).
DEMO believe that the parenthood metaphor of entrepreneurship described here highlights
some new ways of conceptualizing the process involved in organizational and human
creation, ways that involve passion, identification, attachment, and nurturing, as well as DEMO,
defeat, rejection, and regret. Entrepreneurs frequently speak of their ventures as their babies.
By taking on the conceptual viewpoint of entrepreneurs, we may be able to better understand
and interact with them (Wickman et al., 1999) and build better models of entrepreneurship
that resonate more DEMO entrepreneurs themselves and with students of entrepreneurship. New
metaphors help us to identify and challenge the assumptions that have been built on other
42
M.S. Cardon et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 23–45
dominant metaphors in managerial discourse (e.g., sports, war, rational machine metaphors)
and to identify new variables of interest. We present DEMO parenthood metaphor of the process of
new venture creation in order to highlight some new relational perspectives on entrepreneur-
ship and to encourage additional DEMO in these areas.
