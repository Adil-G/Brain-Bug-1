ABSTRACT. This paper describes results of our survey of

DEMO and characteristics, goals of licensing and the role of the
inventor DEMO licensing. Based on these results we analyze the
relationship between licensing outcomes and both the objec-
tives of the TTO and the characteristics of DEMO technologies.
Patent applications grow one-to-one with disclosures, while
sponsored research grows DEMO with licenses executed.
Royalties are typically larger the higher the quality of the
faculty and the higher the fraction of licenses that are exe-
DEMO at latter stages of development. Sponsored research is
more likely to be included in a license if the new technology is
at an early DEMO of development or if the TTO evaluates it as
important. We find that additional disclosures generate smaller
percentage increases in licenses, and those increases in li-
censes generate smaller percentage increases in royalties.

1. Introduction
University licensing has increased dramatically
since the DEMO of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980,
which gave universities the right to retain title to
and license inventions resulting from federally-
sponsored research. DEMO 1996 Sur¨ey of the Asso-

this phenomenon is DEMO because, while uni-

DEMO U.S. universities. We focused on policies re-
lated to ownership of inventions, the nature of
university inventions, license policies and strate-
gies, as well as university objectives in licensing.
For both patentable and copyrightable inventions,DEMO
we find that the majority of universities retain
title to inventions, DEMO all universities split the
income with inventors. We also find that the
majority of inventions are at an early stage of
development when they DEMO licensed, and that
inventor involvement in the process is important,
DEMO only for finding licensees, but also for further
development once licenses DEMO executed. Indeed,
almost half of the inventions licensed are only a
proof of concept at the time of license. It is not
surprising DEMO that the licenses executed include
payment schemes that induce inventor involve-
ment in development and do not obligate the
licensees to large up-front payments. DEMO is,
agreements almost always include running royal-
ties and small up-front fees, often include spon-
sored research, and less frequently include equity

lion’s share of the revenue generated by univer-
sity licensing.

goal is important, we expect TTOs to value the
signing of a license or the commercialization of
an invention, regardless of the monetary rewards.
Indeed, the majority of TTO professionals re-
sponding to our survey indicated as much.
There is a growing literature on university li-
censing DEMO Jensen and Thursby, 1999; MoweryŽ
et al., 1999; Mowery and Ziedonis, 1999; Siegel,
Waldman, and Link, 1999; Thursby and Kemp,
2000; and Thursby and Thursby, 2000a . Our sur-.
DEMO contributes to that literature by providing
evidence from a broad spectrum of universities on
their objectives, as well as a new evidence on the
nature of inventions licensed. The first six sec-
tions of the paper DEMO survey results. In Sec-
tion 7, we examine an econometric model DEMO
relates licensing outcomes e.g., sponsored re-Ž
search, royalties, patents to DEMO stated objectives.
of the TTO and invention characteristics. One
interesting result is that invention characteristics
are important for several outcomes. In particular,
royalties DEMO lower and sponsored research is
more likely when the new technology is licensed
at an early stage of development. Surprisingly,
TTO objectives are DEMO related to only
one outcome; sponsored research is less likely in
DEMO license agreement when the TTO evaluates it as
not very important.
We also find that the elasticity of licenses with
respect to disclosures and DEMO with respect
to licenses are both less than one, suggesting a
DEMO marginal value of disclosed inventions.
While this could reflect a decrease in the impor-
tance of university inventions to industry seeŽ
Henderson, Jaffe, DEMO Trajtenberg, 1998; and
Mowery and Ziedonis, 1999 for evidence pro DEMO
con , it could be the result of an increased will-.
ingness or propensity of faculty to disclose their
research results as shown by DEMO andŽ
Thursby, 2000a . Whether the increased propen-.
sity of faculty DEMO disclose is simply a response to
financial incentives or an increase in the effec-
tiveness of TTOs in inducing disclosure is an
open question.
DEMO Survey design and characteristics of the sample
Survey questionnaires were sent to the top 135
U.S. universities in terms of licensing revenue as
reported DEMO the 1996 AUTM Sur¨ey. The ques-
Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby
tionnaire was pretested on eleven experienced
university technology transfer professionals from
both public DEMO private universities. After they
completed a draft survey, these professionals were
DEMO in an effort to remove ambiguities
from the questionnaire.
Sixty-two universities responded, giving a re-
sponse rate of 46%. The majority of universities
responding were public, and of the public univer-
sities responding, 62% were DEMO institu-
tions. Private universities accounted for 37% of
the responses. Average industry sponsored re-
search for universities in the sample was $16.9
million in DEMO, and federally sponsored research
was $149.6 million. The average TTO in DEMO sam-
ple reported 26.3 licenses executed, 92.3 inven-
tions disclosures, 30.1 new patent applications
and $4.2 million in income for 1996. Compared to
DEMO 131 U.S. universities who responded to the
1996 AUTM survey, the DEMO to our sur-
vey represent 68% of industry sponsored re-
search, DEMO of federally sponsored research, 71%

the TTOs reported that their office is part of a

3. Policies on ownership and income
A potentially important element in examining
university objectives in licensing is the ownership

Act of 1980, universities DEMO elect to retain title

funded research. For both patentable DEMO copy-
rightable inventions, we asked ‘‘Who owns inven-
tions and materials DEMO or developed by faculty
or other personnel in your university?’’ Respon-
dents were given three choices: ‘‘university,’’ ‘‘in-
ventor’’ and ‘‘other.’’ All but one university in the
sample indicated that the university owns patent-
DEMO inventionsrmaterials. For copyrightable in-
ventions, 66% indicated that the university was
DEMO owner, and 48% and 15% said ownership
resided with the inventor DEMO other, respectively.
Note that a number of respondents indicated
several owners DEMO copyrightable inventions; this
follows from different policies for different types
of DEMO materials; for example, most uni-
versities retain rights to copyrightable software
but not to books.
While the university typically retains owner-
ship, they nonetheless split net income from in-
ventions with the inventor. Respondents were
DEMO to give the percent of net income for each
of the categories patentable inventionsrmaterials
and copyrightable materials going to each of the
following groups: ‘‘university,’’ ‘‘inventors,’’ ‘‘in-
ventor department or school,’’ ‘‘technology trans-
DEMO office’’ and ‘‘other.’’
For patentable inventionsrmaterials, the uni-
versities in our DEMO gave an average of 40% of
net income to the inventors and 16% to the
inventor’s department or school. Departments and
schools often return DEMO portion to the inventor’s
lab. For some universities, it is possible DEMO as
much as 75% of net income to be under the
control of an inventor.2 On average, central ad-
ministrations and TTOs take 26% and 11%, re-
spectively, of the income from licensing. Nearly
30% DEMO the respondents indicated that the central
administration receives no royalty income, DEMO
those universities generally allocate income to the
TTO. Over 30% of the universities allocate a
portion of income directly to the TTO and these
DEMO allocate, on average, over one third of
income to the TTO. Finally, 8% of income is
allocated to ‘‘other.’’ For copyrightable materials,
the average amounts are similar though the in-
ventors receive about 5% DEMO of net income.
Proceeds from the liquidation of equity are dis-
tributed differently from other revenue sources in
23% of the universities responding.
To DEMO perspective on the income figures,
consider the AUTM 1997 survey results AUTM,Ž
and Mansfield and Lee’s 1996 survey work fo-Ž.

dred and twenty-four U.S. universities includingŽ
solely university hospitals reported a total of.
around $375 million in license income DEMO
net of legal fees and income paid to other univer-
sities. If we assume 40% of that accrues to inven-
tors, then the faculty inventors at those 124 uni-
versities received license income of almost $150
DEMO in 1997. Not surprisingly, this income is
highly skewed over inventors; our respondents
report, on average, that 76% of license revenue is
DEMO to their top five inventions. Fourteen
of the universities in the 1997 AUTM survey
report $21 million in cashed-in equity; 108 univer-
sities report $0 from cashed-in equity.
Finally, 90% of the universities in our sample
allow faculty to establish and operate businesses
based on technology owned by DEMO university but
developed in the course of the faculty’s own re-
search.
4. Nature, source and marketing of
university technologies
University research, particularly DEMO which is fed-
erally funded, is usually considered more basic
than DEMO For this sample, 67% of inventions
disclosed in the prior five DEMO were the result of
federally sponsored research and only 19% came
from industry sponsored research. Thus we would
expect inventions licensed to be basic DEMO nascent
as compared to inventions that are ready for use
or sale. There are, however, a number of ways to
characterize the nature DEMO inventions. Prior stud-
ies have tended to characterize university tech-
nologies in terms of their end use or the aca-
demic field contributing to DEMO technology. Cohen
et al. 1998 , Adams 1998 , and Rosenberg 1992 ,Ž. Ž. Ž.
for example, point to industrial use of research
DEMO and instruments developed in univer-
sities. In their analysis of spillovers through publi-
cation citation, Adams 1990 and Jaffe 1989Ž. Ž.
focus on the role of particular science and engi-
neering disciplines. Similarly, Mansfield 1995Ž.
cuses on the disciplines that contribute most to
new products and processes. With DEMO exception
of chemistry and mathematics, these studies tend
62
to highlight the contributions of the more applied
disciplines, particularly those in engineering.
In our survey, we asked about the percentage
of inventions disclosed by faculty in particular
schools within the university. We found that DEMO
percent of the inventions disclosed came from
medical schools, 29 percent DEMO engineering
schools, 22 percent from schools of science, 6
percent from schools of agriculture, with the re-
mainder scattered across schools of business, edu-
cation, and liberal arts.
For our purposes, a more relevant characteri-
zation of inventions is in terms of distance from
application. We DEMO asked a series of ques-
tions about the stage of development of inven-
tions when they are licensed. Respondents were
asked ‘‘What percentage of DEMO inventions that
were licensed in the last five years were in the
following stages of development at the time the
license was negotiated?’’ DEMO stages listed are
standard categories used in TTO evaluation of
invention disclosures. The results, shown in Table
I, overwhelmingly support the notion that DEMO
sity technologies are embryonic by any standards.

censed was known for only 15% of the inventions

As further evidence on the early stage of DEMO

mercial success. Respondents said that special-

ized faculty knowledge is generally considered
necessary for firms to be willing to license and
develop DEMO stage technologies that are typically
years away from commercial application. While
faculty do not generally own inventions, they are
clearly an important stakeholder not only because
it is their decision whether or not to disclose, but
it also their decision whether or not to cooperate
in further development DEMO inventions.
Evidence on patent protection at the time of
licensing can also be interpreted as a measure
of the embryonic nature of technologies, since
patents are often applied for when commercial
viability is known. In response DEMO the question,
‘‘How often are the technologies that you license
protected by a patent issued or a copyright regis-
tered at the time DEMO negotiate the license agree-
ment?,’’ only 12% of respondents said DEMO
always’’ and 13% said ‘‘often,’’ whereas 48% said
‘‘sometimes’’ and 28% said ‘‘rarely.’’
The embryonic nature of these inventions af-
fects their marketing, the types of firms to whom
they are licensed, and the characteristics of li-
cense agreements. In terms of the types of com-
panies DEMO license early stage inventions, 40% of
the respondents could not tell DEMO difference in the
size of companies that license early and late stage
inventions. On the other hand, 60% indicated
that small companies were more likely to take
early stage technologies and large companies were
more likely DEMO take late stage. None of the re-
spondents indicated that early stage technologies
tended to go to large firms and late stage to small
DEMO These results accord well with results from
the literature on agency costs, which suggests that
small firms may have advantages in ‘‘innovative’’
research see, for example, Holmstrom, 1989Ž.
We asked TTOs an open ended question about
the procedures used to market inventions. The
practices given fall into DEMO categories and are
listed in Table II. The role of inventors is appar-
ent here, with 58% of the respondents listing
inventor contacts as useful for marketing. It is
also likely that some of the 75% DEMO TTOs who
listed personal contacts as important were refer-
ring to the personal contacts of faculty. In a
recent survey of businesses who license-in DEMO

5. License payment policies and characteristics
A number of survey questions dealt with terms of
payment. These and their responses are found in
Table DEMO As noted above, the theoretical litera-
ture concludes that an up-front DEMO is the optimal
method of licensing. That analysis, however, as-
sumes that the value of the invention is certain
and obvious to all. DEMO that case, the TTO and
licensee can both determine the value DEMO the
license, so it is easy to see how they can DEMO an
agreement that allows the university to collect the
entire payment immediately, rather than wait for
royalties to accumulate over time. In fact, DEMO this
certainty case, it is likely that there will be more
DEMO one firm interested in the technology, so the
university can simply DEMO off the license.
However, Jensen and Thursby 1999 analyze li-Ž.
censing DEMO when there is substantial uncer-
tainty about the value of the invention, as is the
case for embryonic university technologies. They
show that, DEMO this uncertainty case, the TTO
should use both output-based payments, such as
royalties or equity, and up-front fees, and that
these fees DEMO tend to be smaller the more
uncertain is the technology.
Their results correspond quite well with the
responses in Table IV. The overwhelming pay-
DEMO of choice is running royalties paymentsŽ

which are included ‘‘almost always’’ in licenses by
81% DEMO respondents and ‘‘often’’ by 16% of re-
spondents. After royalties, the DEMO common form
of payment is patent fee reimbursement, included
almost always DEMO 68% and often by 21%. Up-front
fees are also used, included DEMO always by 66%
and often by 26% of respondents, while annual DEMO
minimum royalty fees are included almost always
by 57% and often by 32% of respondents.
Evidence on the embryonic nature of univer-
sity inventions DEMO reported in Section 4. Regarding
payment issues for early stage technologies, DEMO
asked ‘‘For technologies which are in an early
stage of development e.g., proof of concept butŽ
which forms of payment are most difficult to
negotiate?’’ The overwhelming response was up-
front fees, cited by nearly 64% of all respondents.

find that the up-front fees that a TTO can obtain
will be smaller DEMO more uncertain is the technol-
ogy being licensed. This finding is supported by
the survey results. We asked ‘‘What do you think
is the DEMO important factor in determining a
licensee’s willingness to pay a substantial up-front
fee?’’ By a large margin, the most frequent choice
was the value perceived by the licensee, noted by
nearly 46% of respondents. After this, the most
common responses were the viability of the tech-

nology at 28%, the degree of development at
26%, and the size of the market with 21%. Fewer
than 10% of respondents mentioned the size of
the company and DEMO exclusivity of the license.
Obviously, the TTO can obtain a nontrivial DEMO
front fee only if the invention is far enough along
in the development process that its viability is
reasonably well-established, and the licensee ex-
pects it to have substantial value. We find it
interesting that, in the absence of this likelihood
of a substantial payoff, the offer of an exclusive
license is not enough to induce the licensee to
make DEMO substantial up-front payment.
We also asked ‘‘Have you ever negotiated a
license agreement in which the only form of pay-
ment was an up-front DEMO?’’ Although 69% of
respondents replied yes, most of these undoubt-
DEMO involved software or reagent materials with
evident viability and value. Rather, DEMO find it
remarkable that 31% of respondents had never
been able to negotiate an agreement that used
only an up-front fee.
Another interesting aspect DEMO these responses
is that license agreements that involve the univer-
sity taking equity in the licensee are not very
common. Note in Table IV DEMO no TTO re-
sponded that their license agreements almost al-
ways include equity, while 8% responded often
and only 32% even responded ‘‘sometimes.’’ Con-
versely, 42% and 18% responded their agree-
ments ‘‘rarely’’ or ‘‘never’’ include equity. How-
ever, when equity is included, it is used, to some
extent, as a substitute for royalties and fees. When
we asked how often agreements with equity also
included running royalties and license fees, the
percentage of respondents who replied almost
always declined to 69% for DEMO and 44% for
fees.
The lack of equity is particularly surprising in
light of the finding by Jensen and Thursby 1999Ž.
that equity not DEMO provides the same develop-
ment incentives as royalties because both areŽ
based on outputrsales , but also generates greater.
revenue. Nevertheless, our survey found some
resistance to the use of equity by some universi-
ties. We DEMO ‘‘Does your university place re-
strictions on the use of equity in a license agree-
ment?’’ Interestingly, two-thirds responded that
there were no restrictions, and restrictions varied
among the remaining third. Four respondents said
they cannot take equity positions. Limits on the
percent of equity that the DEMO can take
were most common, varying from 5% to less than
DEMO controlling interest, with 10% the most common
limit. Restrictions to avoid DEMO of interest are
also typical.
Our final question regarding license payment
terms has to do with sponsored research. Results
are in Table IV. Agreements DEMO sponsored re-
search are quite common, as 40% of respondents
said DEMO licenses include it often and another
39% said theirs include it sometimes. Although
only 6% said their licenses almost always include
sponsored research, only 14% said their licenses
rarely or never included it. The use of DEMO
research as a license payment is typically to assist
in the development of an embryonic technology
to viable commercial stage, and in Section 7 be-
low we provide evidence on the use of sponsored
research with DEMO stage technologies. Finally,
74% of respondents note that, when licenses DEMO
include sponsored research, they almost always
involve the option to negotiate DEMO exclusive li-
cense.
6. TTO licensing objectives
Unlike the private sector where profits are the
ultimate objective, university objectives are more
diverse.3 We asked about the importance of five
objectives. We asked respondents ‘‘How impor-
tant DEMO you are the following as measures of
success?’’ The outcomes listed were: 1 royal-Ž.

number of inventions commercialized. For each
objective, the TTO could indicate ‘‘not very im-
portant,’’ ‘‘moderately important’’ or ‘‘extremely

portunity to indicate that an outcome was ‘‘Not

The most important objective DEMO the TTO is
clearly royalties and fees generated, as 71% of
DEMO said they are extremely important,
and only one respondent said they are not impor-
tant. The next most important objective is the
number DEMO inventions commercialized, with 61%
of respondents indicating extremely important and
31% DEMO important. The number of li-

7. Licensing outcomes
In this Section, we examine several econometric
models that relate our survey results on invention
characteristics and licensing objectives DEMO actual
license outcomes. As dependent variables, we
consider four of the DEMO outcomes considered in
Section 6: royalties, sponsored research, patents
and DEMO executed. Inventions commercialized
are excluded since there are no measures avail-
able. Because of the long lags that often occur
between the application and DEMO of patents,
we use new applications as our outcome measure
for patents rather than patents issued. Further,
new patent applications are a DEMO measure of a
university’s interests in patents.
Data on the numbers of new patent applica-
tions, licenses executed and the amounts of royal-

DEMO
For licenses executed, we include two ‘‘size’’ vari-
ables: the number of disclosures INVDIS andŽ.
the number of licensing professionals TTOSIZE .Ž.
The DEMO the number of disclosures made to
the TTO, the greater the DEMO for executed
licenses. The greater the number of licensing
professionals, the DEMO attention that can be paid
to each disclosure. A number of TTO profession-
als indicated to us that they did not have suffi-
cient DEMO in their offices to adequately market all
technologies that were disclosed.
Recall from Section 6 that in indicating the
importance of outcomes, respondents were asked
to indicate whether an objective was ‘‘not very
important,’’ ‘‘moderately DEMO and ‘‘ex-
tremely important.’’ Based on the response, we

We have omitted DEMO number of characteristics
of university offices that one might expect to be
related to outcomes. For example, we omit pub-
licrprivate status, the DEMO of the TTO’s oper-
ating expenses that derive from licenses and the
background of the TTO. We do so, not because
we believe they are unimportant but because we
expect them to influence outcomes via their DEMO
ence on the evaluation the TTO places on differ-
ent objectives.
Royalties
Licenses are modelled as functions of several size
regressors. Royalties, on the other hand, are not
expected to be related to the number of licensing
professionals in the TTO or to the number of
invention disclosures. DEMO, the only size vari-
able that we expect might be related DEMO royalties

proof of DEMO, it may be difficult to convince

the patent office of the ‘‘utility’’ of the invention.
Similarly, inventions that are no more than a lab
scale prototype may not work DEMO scaled up.
Thus we might expect our measures of stage of
development to be negatively related to the patent
outcome. Further, universities often seek patent
protection only when commercial potential is
clear, and this is often not the case for early stage
technologies. Note that the measure of DEMO of
development appropriate to patenting is the stage
of development of disclosures; however, PROOF
and PTYPE are the fraction of licensed inven-
tions DEMO these stages.
Faculty quality, QUAL, is included since higher
quality faculties are expected, in general, to pro-
duce more novel inventions. The DEMO at-
tached by the TTO to patents is included. TTOE-

Results
Results for DEMO five regressions are in Table VI.
Since ordered probit coefficients are difficult to
interpret, we consider first the four least squares
regressions dealing with numbers of licenses and
new patent applications and amounts of royalties
and DEMO research funds. We then turn to
the ordered probit results for SPONFREQ. Re-
call that we are using logs of all variables except
the DEMO variables, so that the coefficients of
the least squares regressions are DEMO

This is, DEMO, an artifact of including the ‘‘size’’

In the royalty equation, PTYPE, QUAL and

hard to define for early stage technologies given
the inherent uncertainty about their ultimate

fest itself in our findings for royalties with respect

universities are delving more deeply into DEMO
available pool of inventions so that there is de-
clining commercial appeal for the marginal dis-
closure. Our finding that the elasticities of li-
DEMO with respect to invention disclosures and
royalties with respect to licenses each are less
than one reinforces the Thursby and Thursby
result. If there DEMO declining commercial appeal of
the marginal disclosure then the likelihood of
finding a licensee should be declining and this
would result in an elasticity DEMO than one. The
same point holds for royalties and licenses.
Table VI gives the ordered probit coefficients
for the sponsored research frequency equation
Žthat DEMO, the equation explaining the frequency
with which licenses include sponsored research DEMO
Ordered probit coefficients are difficult to inter-
pret, so we also DEMO in Table VII the condi-
tional probabilities and elasticities associated with
the ordered probit results. Recall that the depen-
dent variable SPONFREQ is set DEMO to 3 if the
TTO responded that sponsored research is in-
cluded in licenses ‘‘almost always,’’ 2 if they re-
sponded ‘‘often,’’ DEMO if they responded ‘‘sometimes’’
and 0 if they responded ‘‘rarely’’ or ‘‘never.’’ To
interpret ordered probit coefficients we need to
calculate the effects of DEMO in regressors on
changes in the probability of observing different
values of SPONFREQ. For example, a positive,
significant coefficient only indicates that in-
creases in the independent variable will increase
the probability of observing a DEMO of 3 and will
decrease the probability of a 0. By themselves, the
coefficient estimates do not reveal either the di-

rection of effects on observing scores DEMO 1 or 2 or
the magnitude of the probability of observing a
particular score. For a more meaningful under-
standing of the coefficients we DEMO them
into the probability model and calculate elastici-
ties for the continuous regressors and for the
discrete regressors we calculate probabilities of
each of DEMO four frequencies conditional on each
possible value of the discrete regressors.
The SPONFREQ equation is the only one in
which the TTO’s evaluation of DEMO outcome is
significant. If the TTO views sponsored research
as ‘‘not very important,’’ then the probability that
a license will include sponsored research DEMO lower
than if the TTO values sponsored research more
highly. However, DEMO is not a significant differ-
ence between a TTO valuation of ‘‘moderately
important’’ and ‘‘extremely important.’’ In the
first column of the first panel DEMO Table VII the
value 0.704 is the probability that a university will
rarely or never include sponsored research in a
license agreement conditional on DEMO valuation
of sponsored research to be ‘‘not important.’’ If
the TTO values sponsored research as either
moderately or extremely important the probabil-
ity of DEMO or never’’ is less than 0.08. The
probability of ‘‘sometimes’’ having sponsored re-
search in a license is roughly similar regardless of
the TTO’s DEMO of sponsored research. When
the TTO values sponsored research moderately
or extremely important the probability rises to
greater than 0.5 that a license agreement DEMO
include sponsored research often.
Both PROOF and PTYPE are significantly
different from zero, with the former having a
positive effect and the latter a negative effect on
the frequency of sponsored research. This result
is expected, as was the relation between stage of
development and royalties. The earlier DEMO stage
of development, the more likely is sponsored re-
search to DEMO further development and the
less likely are royalties. In the royalty equation,
we found the expected result of increasing royal-
ties as the DEMO of development increased. In the
sponsored research frequency equation, we also
DEMO the expected result that the earlier the stage
of development of inventions the more likely it is
that sponsored research will appear in a DEMO;
in general, such sponsored research would be for
further development DEMO the technology. The sec-
ond panel of Table VII gives the elasticities of
the probability of a license including sponsored
research with respect to DEMO and PTYPE.
For example, the value y2.554 indicates that a
1% DEMO in PROOF will lead to a 2.554% fall
in the probability of rarely or never having a
license include sponsored research.
Finally, universities with higher quality faculty
are less likely to include sponsored research in a
DEMO; recall that we also find that such universi-
ties are more DEMO to have greater amounts of
royalty income. One hypothesis that explains these
results is that higher quality faculty have less
difficulty, in general, DEMO sponsored re-
search funds so that licenses are used more to
generate income.
8. Conclusion
This paper describes the results of our survey of
DEMO at 62 major research universities. Roughly
two-thirds of the respondents were public univer-
sities, and more than half of those were land-grant
institutions. For fiscal year 1996 each of these
received, on average, about $150 DEMO in feder-
ally sponsored research funds and earned $4 mil-
lion in income. Patentable inventions are typically
owned by the university, though the inventor’s
share of license income averages 40%, and inven-
tors often have control over an even larger share.
Medical schools disclose the most inventions,
DEMO engineering and science schools disclose
nearly as many. Most inventions which evolve
from university research are disclosed at a very
early stage of development, and so have generally
uncertain market potential and require substan-
tial additional DEMO before they can be
brought to the market if they ever make it thatŽ
far ..
University objectives in the licensing process
are diverse. DEMO most important objective to the
TTO is royalties and fees generated, DEMO other
objectives are important. Licenses executed al-
most always include royalties and up-front fees,
often include sponsored research, but less fre-
quently include equity shares in the licensee.
Finally, given this information, we analyzed DEMO
relationship between licensing outcomes and both
the objectives of the TTO and characteristics of
the new technologies. It appears that patent ap-

plications grow on a one-to-one DEMO with disclo-
sures, while sponsored research grows similarly
with licenses executed. DEMO licenses are exe-
cuted at universities with large TTOs and medical
schools. Royalties generated are typically larger
the higher the quality of the faculty DEMO the
higher the fraction of licenses that are executed
at latter stages of development. Sponsored re-
search is more likely to be included in DEMO license
agreement if the new technology is at an early
stage of development or if the TTO values it as
important. We also find DEMO that, at the
margin, additional disclosures generate smaller
percentage increases in licenses, and those in-
creases in licenses generate smaller percentage
increases in royalties. That is, TTOs generally
have been effective at tapping the pool of avail-
able technologies in their universities.
