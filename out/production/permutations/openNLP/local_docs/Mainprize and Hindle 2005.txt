Assessing the efficacy and standardization potential
of five competing venture capital investment
DEMO approaches
Brent Mainprize and Kevin Hindle
Abstract
At a general level, DEMO article focuses on the process of rating the potential of
entrepreneurial business plans (EBPs) in the investment screening decision. At a
specific level, it puts forward a rating regime that has the potential to achieve DEMO
consistency and accuracy in selecting viable EBPs. The article encompasses four
elements, flowing from a general level to the specific.
First, a review DEMO the human decision-making, investment decision-making, and
venture capital decision-making literature throws the spotlight on the investment
screening stage. This is the stage at DEMO investors rate EBPs and make decisions.
Second, the use of decision DEMO in the continuum from a general business context to a
specific venture capital decision application is explored. As a subset of decision aids
employed DEMO business, some venture capital firms use business plan evaluation aids
(BPEAs) to rate the potential of EBPs in the investment screening stage.
Third, a theoretical framework in the form of a taxonomy was developed to enable the
classification and comparison of BPEAs along two axes: 1) DEMO of the judgment
criteria and (2) application of the judgment criteria. The two distinct judgment sources
in venture capital investment decision-making are a) individual cognition (1) (often
lacking any logical or empirical basis) DEMO b) researched venture attributes (based on
research into the causes of business success and failure). The two distinct applications
of the selected DEMO decision criteria happen through a) unsystematic
judgmentalism and b) actuarial modeling. Business Plan Evaluation Aids that use
researched venture attributes and actuarial modeling DEMO the greatest potential for
improving the investment screening process.
Fourth, a DEMO comparison of five existing BPEAs revealed two that hold the
greatest potential to improve the screening process: 1) the FVRI System (Fiet, DEMO,
et al. [2003]) and 2) the New Venture Template (DEMO [1995]). It seems logical to
conclude it is desirable to use a venture evaluation system based on a combination of
researched venture attributes DEMO actuarial modeling.
INTRODUCTION: THE DECISION CONTEXT--FROM GENERAL
PRECEPTS TO A SPECIFIC STAGE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL
PROCESS
Fundamentally, this article is about decision-making. Decision theory belongs to no
single academic discipline. It is inextricably entwined with statistics, economics,
psychology, and a number of applied fields, including business, politics, gambling,
and, of course, investing. In this introductory section, DEMO distill from the vast and
oftentimes intimidating literature those concepts of classical decision theory that are
relevant to the conduct of venture capital decision-making. DEMO specifically the focal
point becomes the screening decisions made for EBPs.
General Features of Human Decision-Making
Since the beginning of time, humans have been required to make decisions, if for no
other reason than survival. Remarkably, the process of making decisions was not
studied formally until the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Since its
beginning (Pascal [1670/1965]; DEMO [1738]), decision theory has provided
strategies to guide decision-making. Strategies have their has its roots in a common
logic, and yet each is unique in that it is crafted to suit a particular set of
DEMO, which it captures in its assumptions and in the procedures that DEMO
prescribes for its application.
In the seventeenth century, Pascal and other DEMO found themselves eagerly
employed by gamblers in the French Court who needed to learn how to distinguish
between fair and unfair bets. For example, a roll of a pair of dice might produce any
of eleven DEMO sums (2 through 12). Any "generous" con artist would DEMO a
passing patsy six of the outcomes (2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12) against his five outcomes (5, 6,
7, 8, 9) on a 50-50 wager. He would do so gladly because, as Bross [1953] reports, on
111 rolls of the DEMO at a dollar a bet he could expect to win 74 dollars while losing
only 37 dollars--a profit so tidy he might offer even DEMO odds as an additional
inducement to play. Consequently the origins of formal decision theory were
prescriptive in nature, as professional decision theorists provided advice on what
"ought" to be done. Today such decision theory models DEMO often labeled "normative"
(Becker [1967]).
Nonetheless, how we DEMO to behave often differs from how we do, in fact, behave.
Since the days of Pascal and Bernoulli, many decision theorists have swung away
from prescribing to describing behavior.
Expertise and Decision Making
Expertise is DEMO knowledge and experience people use to make decisions in complex
dynamic situations. It has the following five characteristics (Prietula and Simon;
Shanteau [1992]): First, expertise is domain specific. Second, expertise is acquired
through DEMO of development, somewhat akin to the mental development of children.
Third, expertise is a mixture of analysis and intuition. Fourth, experts employ various
thinking strategies. Finally, the thinking of experts is systematic and, indeed, more
automated. Much of the literature (e.g., Mintzberg, Raisinghani, et al. DEMO; Doktor
[1978]; Isenberg [1984]; Agor [1986]; Parikh [1994]) indicates DEMO executives in
business may employ both analytical thinking and intuition in solving daily problems.
Expertise is required for executives to develop analytical thinking and DEMO
apply intuition.
Decision aids can help novices become experts and help experts remain on top of their
game. The goal of any decision aid DEMO to provide assistance and structure to improve
the accuracy and consistency of human judgment. Roberts [2002] provided a review
of the decision aid literature. DEMO simple linear models to sophisticated expert
systems employing artificial intelligence, decision DEMO can offer improvement to the
decision-making process in tasks or environments where individuals have proven to
perform at less than optimal levels (Roberts [2002: 30]). Decision aids can provide
assistance in many ways, from DEMO structure on a problem (Todd and Benbasat
[1994]) to recombining the problem (Bonner, Libby, Nelson [1996]; Zacharakis and
Meyer [2000]), DEMO alternative hypotheses (Chu [1991]), making
recommendations, or providing a final solution (Kowalczyk and Wolfe [1998]). In
making predictions, the superiority DEMO formal models, even crude ones, over people's
unsystematic judgments has been widely supported in both business and non-business
environments (Dawes [1979]; DEMO and Pitz [1986]; Kleinmuntz [1990]; Hogarth
[1993]; Hoch and Schkade DEMO; Whitecotten [1996]; Goldstein and Hogarth
[1997]; Bell and Carcello [2000]; Zacharakis and Meyer [2000]). Decision aids may
be able to correct DEMO the human inconsistency and misweighting of cues (2) that
contribute to poor performance (Libby [1981]; Bazerman [1994]). Decision aids are
not DEMO to many of the cognitive biases that individuals are, such as DEMO,
the inappropriate use of heuristics, and the tendency to "satisfice." For example,
Butler [1985] demonstrated that a simple decision aid could help overcome the
tendency to underweight or ignore salient information.
Business Plan DEMO Aids
A BPEA is a highly specialized subset of human decision aids used for the specific
purpose of screening entrepreneurial business plans. Any decision DEMO is used to
provide assistance and structure to improve the accuracy and consistency of human
judgment. As the principal tool in the private equity DEMO decision, the EBP is
relied on heavily by investors (Roure and Keeley [1990]; Hindle [1997]; Zacharakis
and Meyer [2000]). Venture capitalists DEMO devoting 8 to 12 minutes on average
to evaluating a business plan (Sandberg [1986]). Much of the evaluation is purely
intuitive, despite DEMO existence of several decision aids, which might be expected to
aid DEMO efficiency and consistency in the decision-making process. Zacharakis and
Meyer [2000: DEMO concluded that "decision aids are under-used in the VC industry"
DEMO that only 24% of venture capitalists interviewed used some sort of checklist or
tool to aid in the evaluation of EBPs. There are several DEMO of BPEAs. In the next
section, a framework is introduced to DEMO their classification.
Two Key Components of a BPEA: Source and Application DEMO Judgment Criteria
Venture capitalists employ a variety of criteria when evaluating potential investments
in the screening phase (MacMillan, Siegal, et al. [1985]). A survey of both the
academic literature and practitioners' practice reveals that the source of judgment
criteria and the application of judgment criteria vary significantly when evaluating
EBPs.
DEMO of judgement criteria. The source of the screening criteria used by VC firms
can be categorized into two schools, henceforth called 1) the DEMO cognition
school and 2) the researched venture attributes school) The majority of extant studies
in the VC investment decision-making field belong to the "individual cognition"
school, which has produced lists of criteria that venture capitalists report they use
when evaluating new venture proposals (see Tyebjee and Bruno [1981, 1984]; Bruno
and Tyebjee [1985]; MacMillan, Siegal, et al. [1985]; Gorman and Sahlman [1986];
MacMillan, Zeman, et al. [1987]). They are based on what VCs say (espouse) they
DEMO to screen investment opportunities.
Typically, mental models, or cognitive maps, DEMO be classified into two coexisting
kinds: espoused theories and theories-in-use. An DEMO theory is the mental model
that people will say they hold if asked to explain or justify a given pattern of activity.
This may DEMO from the theory-in-use, which is the mental model implicit in the
DEMO of that pattern of activity. One cannot ask someone to describe her
theory-in-use; one can only hypothesize and test it by observing her actions (Argyris
[1996: 44]).
Social judgment theorists suggest that "espoused" DEMO processes may be
a less than accurate reflection of "in use" decision-making processes (Priem [1992];
Priem and Harrison [1994]). Zacharakis and Meyer [1998: 58] and Shepherd [1999:
622] found that venture capitalists' "actual" decision policies explain more variance in
new venture performance than do "espoused" policies. These two studies concluded
that venture capitalists have DEMO poor understanding of their actual decision-making
policies.
The results of VC decisions suggest that VCs' espoused criteria and "in use" variants
may not be optimal (Zider [1998]) as a basis for either real-world decisions DEMO
attempts to explain those decisions using research (Zacharakis and Meyer [1998,DEMO
2000]; Shepherd [1999]). Venture capitalists may be able to improve DEMO
introspection by reducing the gap between their "in use" and "DEMO" decision-
making policies by altering the "espoused" policy to coincide DEMO the "in use" policy
(Shepherd [1999: 622]). Using "DEMO use" policy to screen business plans has higher
predictive ability than DEMO the "espoused" policy (Shepherd [1999]; Zacharakis and
Meyer [2000]).
This article seeks to move beyond studying and applying individual cognition models'DEMO
"espoused" and "in use" policies toward attributes that we know (based on research)
are important to the success of new ventures (Mitchell [1998]; Shepherd, Ettenson, et
al. [2000]). Basing the DEMO of investment screening criteria on these "known
attributes" applies known success factors (or rather, known failure-prevention factors)
or viable venture attributes DEMO represent the requirements necessary for success
within a particular industry. The individual cognition school and researched venture
attributes school as potential sources of judgment DEMO are discussed in more detail
below.
Does what I think matter--the "individual cognition" school. The majority of
DEMO studies in the VC investment decision-making field belong to what we are
calling the "individual cognition" school. Research based on individual cognition has
DEMO on the results of surveys and questionnaires that provided "decision cues" for
the researchers to create and test the effectiveness of their models DEMO VC investment
decision-making. In seeking relationships between decision cues and the performance
of new ventures, such studies have made significant contributions to our
understanding of VC decision-making. Prior research on VC decision-making
determined criteria espoused by DEMO using different emphases. These include some
form of counting (Benoit [1975]; Tyebjee and Bruno [1984]), rating scales (Wells
[1974]; Dixon [1991]), ranking scales (Poindexter [1976]; MacMillan, Siegal, et al.
[1985]), and trade-offs (Muzyka, Birley, et al. [1996]). Investigators agree that criteria
espoused by VCs often are not used in their entirety when DEMO decisions are
made. Even if all criteria are used, the results DEMO VC decisions suggest that VCs'
individual cognition is not optimal as the basis of either real-world decisions or
attempts to explain those decisions DEMO research (Shepherd [1999]; Zacharakis and
Meyer [2000]). Is there a stronger basis for studying the source of investment
screening criteria?
Do DEMO works--the "researched venture attributes" school. At the firm level of
analysis, one of the goals of many entrepreneurship researchers has been the
articulation of clearly recognizable attributes that distinguish viable, successful
ventures from ventures prone to failure. The venture performance stream of
entrepreneurship research, as a subunit of business strategy research, has concentrated
on this task. Strategy researchers propose that superior performance arises from a fit
between the competencies of a DEMO and the key success factors of an industry
(Porter [1980]; Andrews [1987]; Shepherd [1999]). When applied to the study of VC
investment decision-making, this emphasis may be held to constitute what may be
called the "researched venture attributes" school, where success factors or viable
venture attributes represent the requirements necessary for success within a particular
industry.
A DEMO venture team must commit to a number of viable venture attributes that they
believe will lead to success within the competitive environment (Slater [1993];
Shepherd [1999]). Viable venture attributes within an industry remain stable. DEMO
and Freeman [1977, 1984] argue that organizations seldom succeed in making DEMO
changes in their core strategy and structure in the face of environmental threats,
because they are subject to strong inertial forces. Changes in DEMO core lead to an
increased probability of organizational failure and death. If a new venture is to
succeed, the attributes required at or near the time it is founded will endure with little
variation over its DEMO Accordingly, detecting the presence of attributes known to
enhance venture viability DEMO likelihood of success becomes critical to predicting the
performance of a new venture.
Shepherd, Ettenson, et al. [2000] were the first researchers to DEMO significantly
from previous work that focused on "espoused" and "in DEMO" criteria in venture capital
deal screening. Prior research into venture capitalists' decision-making typically has
relied on reports of individual cognition by practitioners--criteria without DEMO
justified foundations. The study by Shepherd and colleagues explored the use of
theoretically derived criteria. They reviewed the industrial organization literature to
identify criteria (strategies) known to be linked to new venture profitability.
Their study utilized those non-controversial findings from industrial organization
literature that we "know" influence DEMO to see whether venture capitalists use
these variables (criteria) in the manner proposed in the literature. It is important to
note that Shepherd, Ettenson, et al. [2000]--though they did not use the term--were the
first to explore the use of researched venture attributes as a source of DEMO investment
criteria in an empirical study. Their study was based on having 66 Australian venture
capitalists rate the most important researched venture attributes in DEMO assessment of
new venture profitability. On average, the most important is DEMO
competence. The second tier of importance is competitive rivalry, timing, and
educational capability. The third tier of importance is lead time, key success factor
stability, and "timing times lead time" interaction (Shepherd, Ettenson, et al. [2000:
450]). Mainprize [2004] empirically tested the relationship between researched
venture attributes as the source of investment screening criteria and DEMO new
venture performance.
Accordingly, detecting the presence of attributes known to DEMO venture viability
and likelihood of success at the screening phase could become critical to predicting
the performance of a new venture. Individual cognition criteria--including DEMO VCs
say that they do and "in use" behavior, (what they are observed to do)--may be a very
poor basis compared DEMO researched venture attributes for either understanding actual
decision criteria or building guidelines and systems for improving performance in
investment decision-making.
Application of judgment criteria. DEMO any decision-making, the application of
judgment criteria is as important as DEMO source. Just as systematic application of
invalid criteria will fail, so DEMO unsystematic application of valid criteria. A good
decision means both systematic application and valid criteria. Improper or
misweighted criteria lead to inaccuracy and inconsistent DEMO (Roberts [2002]).
Individuals are generally good at coding information yet DEMO at combining cues
(Libby [1981]; Dawes, Faust, et al. [1989]; Bonner [1991]; Bazerman [1994]). In fact,
a general inability DEMO integrate information is a primary reason human judgment and
decision-making are often less than optimal.
Shepherd [1999: 633] found that venture capitalists exhibit limited introspection into
the policies they use to assess likely profitability and have DEMO tendency to overstate the
least important criteria and understate the most important criteria compared with their
"in use" decision policies.
The application of DEMO judgment criteria used by VC firms can be categorized into 1)
unsystematic judgmentalism and 2) actuarial modeling.
Unsystematic judgmentalism. A variety of scientists, including meteorologists,
statisticians, and psychologists, have been interested in measuring and explaining
judgments of confidence and their relationship to accuracy (e.g., DEMO Lichtenstein,
Fischhoff, et al. [1982]; Yates [1990]; Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, et al. [1991]; McClelland
and Bolger [1994]; Budescu, Erev, et al. [1997]; Harvey [1997]). Many of these
studies reported that people are systematically overconfident about the accuracy of
their knowledge and judgment. And people tend to express confidence in their
DEMO that exceeds the accuracy of those judgments. At the same time, DEMO extent
to which overconfidence occurs seems to depend on the difficulty of the judgment
task. With easy tasks, overconfidence seems to disappear, or DEMO is
observed. With hard tasks, overconfidence seems to be rampant (Klayman, Soll, et al.
[1999]). The more confident people are, the more overconfident they are, and, overall,
confidence tends to exceed DEMO These effects result from unsystematic
imperfections in the application of judgment criteria (Klayman, Soil, et al. [1999:
217]).
More specifically, DEMO in the field of venture capital decision-making confirms
the above. Zacharakis and Shepherd [2001: 312] found that VCs are indeed
overconfident and that overconfidence negatively affects VC decision accuracy. They
concluded that VCs are prone to "availability bias" (Zacharakis and Shepherd [2001:
312]); that is, the natural tendency to recall past successes rather than failures means
that DEMO may make the same mistakes again. Most important, they found that DEMO
information surrounding the decision is structured in an unfamiliar way, VCs DEMO
have difficulties deciphering what each piece of information means and how it
impacts their overall accuracy. In other words, much of VCs' investment DEMO
decision-making can be characterized as unsystematic judgmentalism: applying
decision criteria haphazardly DEMO inconsistently.
Actuarial modeling. On the other hand, the most highly structured DEMO formal
example of a decision support system is an actuarial model. Psychology researchers
Elstein and Bordage [1988: 123] stated that "actuarial (statistical) DEMO refer to the
use of any formal quantitative techniques or formulas, DEMO as regression analysis, for
... [deciding] clinical tasks" (cf. Zacharakis DEMO Meyer [2000]). These models enable
the judge to consider and rate individual criteria independently using quantitative
values. The actuarial model then optimally combines DEMO values assigned to the
individual criteria using a weighted algorithm to derive a predicted outcome.
Actuarial models were first used in the insurance industry DEMO derive the payoff risk
associated with particular groups of people or individuals in the population. For
example, an insurance actuarial model could use a weighted algorithm to consider
age, sex, blood pressure, and occupation as inputs to determine statistically the life
expectancy of an individual. Zacharakis and DEMO [2000] were the first and have
been the only researchers to date to apply actuarial models to venture capital decision-
making. In this seminal DEMO they found that properly developed actuarial models
have the potential to improve the application of judgment criteria in the screening of
EBPs (Zacharakis and Meyer [2000: 324]).
Actuarial models help VCs by weighting decision criteria consistently when screening
EBPs. Information cues often bias VCs, like all human decision-makers. Without a
decision aid, investors may misinterpret decision cues or ignore other important cues
(Zacharakis and Meyer [2000: 324]).
Prior research DEMO venture capital deal screening is vital to the theoretical foundation of
this article. Researched venture attributes (Shepherd, Ettenson, et al. [2000]) as DEMO
source of decision criteria and actuarial modeling (Zacharakis and Meyer [2000]) as
the application together hold great potential to improve venture capital deal DEMO
when present in a BPEA. This article seeks to discover a business DEMO evaluation aid
based on researched venture attributes and actuarial modeling.
EMPIRICAL COMPONENT OF THE STUDY
Research Objective
The research objective was to perform a DEMO evaluation and comparison of five
representative BPEAs to facilitate constructive discussion of the proposition that
greater standardization of venture capital decision-making might be both DEMO
and possible.
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework employed in the article consisted of a distillation of the
literature cited above.
Unit of Analysis, Population, and Sampling
The unit of analysis in this study was the BPEA. A search of the literature failed to
reveal exactly how many different DEMO are currently in use by practitioners. The
sample BPEAs classified in this section are more akin to the case research method--
generalizing to theory (Yin [1989])--than to the survey method--generalizing to an
estimated numeric population. DEMO sample of five BPEAs was purposively selected
from the population of all BPEAs:
•
•
•
•
•
The Venture Opportunity Screening Guide (Timmons [1994])
The Bell-Mason Diagnostic (Bell [1991])
ProGrid Venture (DEMO [1997])
The FVRI System (4) (Fiet, Gupta, et DEMO [2003])
The New Venture Template (Mitchell [1995])
This sample DEMO five cases was considered to be representative of the population.
Investigative Technique: Taxonomic Framework for Comparing BPEAs
The empirical investigation was fundamentally taxonomic. It involved a classification
and comparison of five selected BPEA exemplars. The research DEMO was to classify
the BPEAs as a prelude to systematic comparison of their dominant, salient attributes.
Once almost exclusively the domain and practice of the natural sciences, taxonomy is
now practiced in several other disciplines, DEMO the social sciences, computer
science, information science, linguistics, and cognitive science (Grove [2003: 2270]).
Within these fields, taxonomy has acquired a wide range of meanings no longer
restricted to the classic understanding DEMO biology. Taxonomy is now applied in its
early sense of organizing things in accordance with particular principles ("taxis":
arrangement; "nomos": law) to a broader range of domains after several centuries of
being limited to biology and other natural sciences (Grove [2003: 2270]). Grouping
concepts that seem similar is a means of generalization and simplification (Fernadez
and Eastman [1990]). An essential contribution of taxonomy to a discipline is its
ability to disambiguate terminology by representing DEMO relationships between
concepts and providing context in which to understand and use domain-specific
vocabularies (Maity, Bhattacharya, et al. [1992]; Grove [2003: 2276]).
An effective taxonomic framework is characterized by 1) advancing conceptual
understanding and 2) having pragmatic utility. Because of this dual nature, at DEMO
one must turn to the practice of taxonomy to discern theory and principles and at other
times study theory and principles to establish practice (Fernandez and Eastman
[1990]; Grove [2003: 2274]). In other words, taxonomy means both classifying
entities and creating new classes. Collections of entities DEMO examined to create a
taxonomic structure, and individual entities are assigned DEMO the classes (taxa) created.
In this article, the theory and DEMO from the source and application of judgment
criteria (discussed earlier) provide the foundation for discovering a taxonomy of
BPEAs. In the discussion section, we turn to the practice of screening entrepreneurial
business plans to realize DEMO pragmatic utility of the taxonomic framework.
The sources and application of judgment criteria described in previous sections are
combined to form a two-by-two taxonomic DEMO that can be used to classify BPEAs.
The taxonomic framework has as its horizontal axis the source of criteria: 1)
individual cognition or 2) researched venture attributes. The vertical axis consists of
the application of the judgment criteria: 1) unsystematic judgmentalism or 2) actuarial
modeling (DEMO Exhibit 1).
A synthesis of prior research indicates that a BPEA based on researched DEMO
attributes and actuarial modeling holds the greatest potential to improve the deal
screening stage in the venture capital decision process (represented by the shaded area
in Exhibit 1). In the next section, this framework will be used to facilitate the
comparison of all known business plan evaluation DEMO to determine whether such an
aid exists.
RESULTS: CHOOSING A BUSINESS DEMO EVALUATION AID
The taxonomic classification revealed two of the five examined BPEAs hold the
greatest potential to improve the deal screening process: 1) DEMO New Venture
Template and 2) the FVRI System. Both of these DEMO use researched venture
attributes as the source of judgment criteria and actuarial models to apply the
judgment criteria (represented by the shaded area in Exhibit 2).
A description and analysis of each BPEA follows.
Venture Opportunity Screening Guide
The Venture Opportunity Screening Guide (VOSG) (Timmons [1994]) is a paper-
based decision aid that contains two stages. In the first stage, the Quick Screen is
designed to enable a potential investor to screen several plans (e.g., 100 plans) down
to a select few (e.g. 5 plans) using an abbreviated version of the DEMO criteria.
After the initial screening stage, the full version of the DEMO includes 55 cues rated
on a continuum from high potential to low potential. Of these cues, 43 use qualitative
anchors at each end of their continuum, and the remaining 12 cues are anchored with
quantitative values. Timmons derives the 55 cues from a list of criteria for evaluating
DEMO opportunities based on his experience plus a variety of studies in the field of
entrepreneurship. Research by Timmons [1994] suggests that the sources of DEMO 55
judgment criteria used in the VOSG are based on "researched DEMO attributes." The
VOSG, does not however, include a method to DEMO or combine the values
assigned to the 55 individual criteria to determine the overall potential viability of the
EBR Without an algorithm or some DEMO means to weight the importance of
each cue to the overall viability of the EBR unsystematic judgmentalism will DEMO the
method to which the decision-maker will in all likelihood default when applying the
decision criteria. The tool does not provide a summary of DEMO analysis in graphical
form.
The Bell-Mason Diagnostic (BMD) (Bell [1991]), released in 1992, has gained
growing acceptance among investors, multinationals, DEMO advisors, government
bodies, and VC practitioners, among them Philips, Motorola, Mitsubishi, Coopers &
Lybrand, the Canadian Business Development Board, NanYang Venture Capital
(Australia), and the Scottish Enterprise Board. The BMD purports to evaluate
companies seeking venture capital quantitatively (Bell [1991]). Coopers & Lybrand's
Gordon Bell and Heidi Mason developed the BMD over a DEMO period. The BMD is
a rule-based tool that is applied manually (DEMO based) to characterize and plot the
status of a high-technology venture DEMO predetermined stages (discovery, definition,
development, and deployment) in its growth. The BMD is designed to evaluate 12
dimensions (independent variables) (see Exhibit 3) and plot them against an "ideal" at
each stage using 12 dimensions on a relational graph.
The diagnosis is carried out by "answering a series of 100 yes/no questions that are
derived from 600 'rules' for the success DEMO a new venture" (Bell [1991: 271]). Bell
does not DEMO any literature, academic studies, or empirical research in determining the
source of the 600 rules upon which the 100 cues are based. The DEMO used to drive
this decision aid are based on Bell's "DEMO and understanding" (Bell [1991:
271]) from working with hundreds DEMO ventures. Accordingly, BMD is considered in
this comparison to be of DEMO "individual cognition" school in terms of the source of
criteria for decision-making. A user of the method responds to cues (questions) with DEMO
dichotomous "yes/no" answer. There is no flexibility for relative responses. The Bell-
Mason Diagnostic does not include a method to synthesize the DEMO to the
"yes/no" cues to determine the overall potential viability of the EBR Without an
algorithm or some systematic means to weight DEMO importance of each cue to the
overall viability of the EBP, DEMO judgmentalism is the method the decision-
maker will most likely use to apply the judgment criteria.
ProGrid Venture
ProGrid Venture (Bowman [1997]) is a software-based BPEA that DEMO 12 cues
that concentrate on 3 characteristics (4 cues per characteristic) of an opportunity: 1)
the venture, 2) the connectors, DEMO 3) the benefits/ impact (see Exhibit 4).
The evaluator DEMO to the 12 cues using a 4-point ordinal scale. Each of the 4
points is qualitatively anchored. Bowman derives the 12 cues based upon DEMO
experience and testing with commercial clients.
The source of the 12 cues appears to be individual cognition, as no literature on
venture capital or new venture success attributes are cited. ProGrid Venture applies
the judgment criteria DEMO an actuarial model operationalized by computer software.
As a BPEA, ProGrid DEMO enables the judge to consider and rate the 12 cues
independently using a 4-point ordinal scale. The actuarial model then optimally
combines the values DEMO to the individual criteria, using a weighted algorithm to
derive the DEMO viability of the new venture.
Two graphic displays in the form of charts summarize the analysis of DEMO actuarial
model. Chart 1 (The Venture Grid) plots the current grid position for the venture
using two axes (dependent variables): 1) DEMO venture attributes and 2) the expected
commercial value of the venture. DEMO graph also compares the "position" of the
venture being analyzed to other ventures that have been evaluated previously using
the tool (see Exhibit 5).
Chart 2 (Venture Profile) is a bar chart indicating DEMO evaluator's responses to the 12
cues (see Exhibit 5). DEMO sum, the strength of the actuarial model and the graphs used DEMO
apply the judgment criteria is overshadowed by the fact that the source of judgment
criteria is individual cognition.
FVRI System (Fiet et al. [2003])
The FVRI System is a paper-based BPEA that purports to enable an investor to
predict the wealth-creating DEMO of venture ideas. The fundamental underpinning
of the FVRI System is based on its authors' theoretical research (Fiet, Gupta, et al.
[2003: 2]). "Ideas with the potential for wealth creation must be found in inefficient
markets for information and must be based on specific information, not general
information. The application of general information, on average, leads DEMO the
generation of normal economic profit, which is insufficient to justify DEMO
risk taking" (Fiet, Gupta, et al. [2003: 2]). DEMO contrast, the application of specific
information may lead to above-normal returns DEMO the possibility of creating new
wealth because those who possess it can monopolize its application (Hayek [1945];
cf. Fiet, Gupta, et al. [2003]). In all cases, to create new wealth, the idea DEMO consist
of specific information and must be found in a market that is not widely traded, so
that it will not have already been discovered and commercialized by someone else
(Casson [1990]). The BPEA uses 51 cues to assess 4 wealth-creating attributes: 1) fit,
2) value, 3) rarity, and 4) inimitability.
The investor evaluating business DEMO enters his/her responses to the 51 cues using
45 Likert scales (from 0 to 5) and 6 cues that require numeric values. DEMO FVRI
System enables the judge to rate and enter values for the 51 questions (judgment
criteria) independently. The computer-based actuarial model then allows DEMO investor
to combine optimally the values assigned to individual criteria using a weighted
algorithm to derive the wealth-creating potential of a venture idea. More DEMO,
each of the four wealth-creating attributes includes several factors (judgment DEMO).
The user is instructed to select and rank the four most important factors (those with
the highest rating) for each attribute. The DEMO System then requires that the user
assign weights to each factor, DEMO their level of importance to the respective
attribute. The sum of the weights for all four factors must equal one. Individually, the
user may represent them as varying decimal fractions of one.
As stated above, the actuarial model used to apply the judgment criteria of the FVRI
System DEMO one of its strengths. Perhaps an even greater forte of the FVRI System
comes from the source of its judgment criteria, researched venture attributes.
Fiet, Gupta, et al. [2003] surveyed prior literature in the fields DEMO industry organization
economics (Chamberlain [1933]; Bain [1956]; Porter [1980]; Oster [1990]), the
resource-based theory of the firm (Wernerfeldt [19841; Dierickx DEMO Cool [1989];
Barney [2002]), and the competence literature (Fiet DEMO; Venkataraman [1997];
Shane [2000]) to derive their four independent researched venture attributes to predict
the wealth-creating potential of venture ideas: (fit, value, rarity, and inimitability).
New Venture Template
The New Venture DEMO (Mitchell [1994]) is a Web-based software decision aid
that enables an investor to systematize his or her approach to the EBP screening
process. DEMO BPEA uses 15 cues to assess 6 viable venture attributes.
The investor evaluating EBPs enters responses to the 15 cues using a 9-point Likert
DEMO The New Venture Template as a BPEA enables the judge to consider and rate
the 15 cues (judgment criteria) independently. The actuarial model driven by DEMO
software then optimally combines the values assigned to the individual criteria using a
weighted algorithm to derive the potential viability of the new venture DEMO terms of
profitability and survival.
Two graphic displays in the form of charts summarize the analysis of the actuarial
model. The first graph determines DEMO "profile" of the venture by plotting the current
grid position for the venture using two axes: 1) the potential profit (labeled "DEMO it a
business?") and 2) the expected survival of the venture (labeled "Can you keep it?").
Within this grid, a set of 14 venture prototypes is compared with the venture being
DEMO to determine with which prototype it is most highly correlated. The 14
prototype profiles are scattered in four general quadrants: long term/lower profit, long
term/higher profit, short term/lower profit, and short term/higher profit (see Exhibit
6).
The second graphical display is a radar chart indicating the evaluator responses to the
15 cues. It positions DEMO venture under scrutiny in relation to the prototypical venture
(indicated by DEMO gray shaded areas) with which it is most highly correlated (see
Exhibit 7).
As stated above, the actuarial model used to apply the judgment criteria of the New
Venture Template is one of its strengths. As with DEMO FVRI System an even greater
forte of the New Venture Template is the source of its judgment criteria, researched
venture attributes. The next section shows the New Venture Template is the BPEA
that holds the greatest DEMO, among the five models evaluated, to improve the deal
screening process.
Our comparison was fundamentally taxonomic. Following the theoretical framework
constituted by the DEMO capital decision-making literature, eight key aspects of each
BPEA are compared:DEMO
1. source of judgment criteria
2. application of judgment criteria
3. format
4. number of judgment criteria (independent variables)
5. dependent variables
6. visual output
7. practitioners using the BPEA
8. the overall potential of DEMO BPEA to improve deal screening
A summary of the comparison is presented in Exhibit 8.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Despite the weaknesses inherent in all the BPEAs scrutinized, the taxonomic
comparison of five existing BPEAs revealed two that hold potential DEMO improve the
screening process: 1) the FVRI System (Fiet [2002]) and 2) the New Venture
Template (Mitchell [1995]). So it DEMO be said that BPEAs developed by
entrepreneurship researchers and practitioners for future studies and investment
decisions should have as their fundamental underpinnings researched venture
DEMO and actuarial modeling. It can be unequivocally stated that unsupported
individual cognition is an inadequate source of investment screening judgement
criteria, and unsystematic judgementalism is a flawed, outmoded way to apply
judgment criteria. This unsatisfactory combination characterizes the state of the art of
the venture capital industry.
However, BPEAs developed using researched venture attributes (as the criteria
source) and DEMO modeling (as the method of applying criteria) for the purpose of
rating the viability of entrepreneurial business plans not only hold the greatest
DEMO to improve the consistency and accuracy of the investment screening
decision but improve research into investment decision-making in general.
VC firms that commit to DEMO disciplined method of applying venture evaluation take an
important step toward eliminating decisions based on unsystematic judgmentalism
and adopting new decision-making policies based on DEMO use of actuarial modeling to
improve investment decision consistency. Adopting a consistent venture evaluation
method could foster organizational learning. Venture evaluation methods may be DEMO
hub of knowledge that one generation of venture capitalists could pass down to the
next generation within a firm. The method used for venture DEMO may come to
represent an important strategic asset for a VC firm (Shepherd 1999: 84).
In the field of medicine the diagnosis DEMO performed by a licensed doctor and a
"medical quack" differ substantially. The two primary differences are the source of
the criteria used in DEMO diagnosis and the method employed to apply these criteria to
diagnosis. Let us deal first with the issue of the source of evaluation criteria. DEMO
medical doctor uses diagnosis criteria based on scientific evidence.
A medical quack uses diagnosis criteria based on what he or she "espouses" to DEMO
important through his or her individual cognition. The accuracy of diagnosis by a
medical doctor exceeds that of a diagnosis by a medical quack.
DEMO, the practices most prevalent in private equity investment parallel those
of DEMO medicine. Many venture capitalists base their investment screening decisions
on individual cognition rather than researched venture attributes "known" to cause
business success and DEMO
The results of venture capitalists' decisions indicate that their individual cognitions are
clearly not optimal as the basis of either real-world decisions or attempts DEMO explain
those decisions using research (Shepherd [1999] Zacharakis and Meyer [2000])DEMO
A diagnosis performed in the medical field to determine a patient's prognosis is
analogous to the assessment of an EBP to determine the DEMO potential. In both
fields, the accuracy of the decision is dependent, in major part, on the source of the
judgment criteria. Doctors and investors who use decision criteria that have been
demonstrated by researchers to DEMO important, rather than unsupported capricious
outputs of individual cognition, reach more accurate decisions.

ENDNOTES
(DEMO) The majority of extant studies in the venture capital investment decision-making
DEMO belong to the "individual cognition" school, which has produced lists DEMO criteria
that venture capitalists report they use when evaluating new venture proposals (see
Tyebjee and Bruno [1981, 1984]; Bruno and Tyebjee [1985]; DEMO, Siegal, et at.
[1985]; Gorman and Sahlman [1986]; MacMillan, DEMO, et at. [1987]). They are
based on what the VCs DEMO (espouse) they use to screen investment opportunities
(Zacharakis and Meyer [2000]). Individual cognition is tantamount to choosing
investment decision criteria based on "gut feel."
(2) A decision cue is a stimulus that provides information to the judge about what to
DEMO
(3) It took many months to conceptually organize these two schools of thought. It was
Dr. Kevin Hindle who coined the terms "individual cognition" and "researched
venture attributes," through which the conceptual classification DEMO these two schools
became possible.
(4) FVRI is an acronym for the four attributes of the decision model: 1) Fit, 2) DEMO,
3) Rarity, and 4) Inimitability.{1g42fwefx}
