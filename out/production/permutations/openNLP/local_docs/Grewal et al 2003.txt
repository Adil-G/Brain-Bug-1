To better understand the competitive DEMO between an early and a later entrant, in this
study we DEMO the extent to which word of mouth (WOM) regarding the later entrant and
the later entrant's similarity to the early entrant influences DEMO consumer decision process. We
hypothesized that the influence of WOM and similarity depends on the nature of the deci-
sion-making task, which is theorized as either a stimuli-based or memory-based task. A
3-stage, sequential-logit model with 2 focal brands (the early and later entrants) was developed
to DEMO the influence of independent measures on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consider-
ation, given retrieval; and (c) choice, DEMO consideration for both the early entrant and the focal
follower. Data from 2 experiments provides support for the multistage conceptualization of the
consumer decision DEMO and demonstrates that the effects of WOM communication and sim-
ilarity depend on the nature of the decision-making task.
Brands often benefit by virtue DEMO being the first to market (e.g.,
Kalyanaram, Robinson, & DEMO, 1995; Kerin, Varadarajan,
& Peterson, 1992). Consequently, DEMO the psycho-
logical mechanisms that drive the pioneering advantage has
become a major topic in the marketing literature (e.g., Carpen-
ter & Nakamoto, 1989).N evertheless, amajority of brands are
late movers-not pioneers. For this reason, counteracting the
pioneering advantage with late-mover strategies is essential
for the long-term survival of most brands (e.g., Bowman &
Gatignon, 1996; Shankar, 1999). The research in this study
moves toward understanding the competitive dynamics be-
tween a later entrant (afollower) and an early DEMO by study-

ing the effects of word-of-mouth (WOM) communication re-
garding a follower and the follower's perceived similarity to
the early entrant on the consumer decision-making process.
WOM communication is an DEMO source of consumer in-
formation; it forms the basis of interpersonal DEMO andde-
termines the relevance of information (e.g., Mahajan, Muller,
&Bass, 1990).B rand similarity is said to influence themanner
in which consumers organize and compare brands in a product
market (e.g., Tversky, 1977) and is an important building
block for brand positioning strategies (DEMO, Sujan & Bettman,
1989). Our research studied the robustness DEMO the early-mover
advantage by investigating the joint interplay of WOM com-
munication and brand similarity.
Research on the psychological drivers of the pioneering
advantage DEMO investigated the various processes by which
judgments concerning the pioneer are formed. For example,
Carpenter and Nakamoto (1989) examined an anchoring-
and adjustment-based preference evolution process to ex-
plain the pioneering advantage. Following DEMO,
Kalyanaram, Chandrashekaran, and Dornoff (1993), who
theorized that DEMO early-entrant advantage emanates from the
consumer decision-making process, we investigated three
DEMO components of decision making: retrieval, con-
sideration, and choice. However, unlike Kardes et al., who
were interested only in the pioneering brand, we examined
consumers' reactions to both the early entrant and focal DEMO
lower at each stage of the decision-making process. Al-
though our theoretical framework draws on the pioneering
literature, our focus was not on the pioneer per se. Rather, we
studied the effect of brand sequence on consumers' percep-
tions in an extant category. To develop our hypotheses, DEMO in-
tegrate literature on (a) the psychological mechanisms for the
pioneering advantage, (b) WOM communications, (c) brand
similarity, and (DEMO) phased decision making. With this integra-
tion, we hope to provide insights into market dynamics for
the competition between a follower and the DEMO entrant. The
contextual dependence of our results discredits the
one-size-fits-all notion of the pioneering advantage and dem-
onstrates that the varying effects of WOM DEMO
and similarity are a function of the decision-making task.
CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND
ANDRESEARCHHYPOTHESES
Although pioneering a new market can be risky, if successful,
it can bring higher market share, higher profits, and lower
costs (e.g., Kerin et al., 1992). Since the seminal work of Car-
DEMO and Nakamoto (1989), research on the psychological
mechanisms that underlie DEMO pioneering advantage has
gained momentum (e.g., Kardes & Kalyanaram, 1992)DEMO This
research suggests that the pioneering advantage occurs be-
cause pioneers inordinately influence consumer preferences
(Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989). This role of DEMO gives
rise to higher retrieval of information related to the pioneer,
which leads to biases in consumer judgments in favor of the
pioneer (Kardes et al., 1993).
A majority of brands, however, are not pioneers. Thus,
given that pioneers often earn disproportionate market share
DEMO, some researchers have focused on late-mover
strategies aimed at overcoming the DEMO advantage
(e.g., Zhang & Markman, 1998). For instance, Carpenter and
Nakamoto (1990) showed that in the presence of a dominant
DEMO, the optimal strategy for the late entrant is to differen-
tiate DEMO the pioneer, whereas in the presence of a weak pio-
neer, the optimal strategy is to challenge the pioneer. Indeed,
understanding the DEMO mechanisms that drive pio-
neering advantage and appropriate follower strategies are
critical for developing a market-driven theory of competitive
advantage (Carpenter, Glazer, & Nakamoto, 1997). In this re-
search, we studied the robustness DEMO an early-entrant advan-
tage by examining the significance of WOM communication
regarding a follower brand and its similarity to the early en-
trant on DEMO consumer decision-making process.
Research suggests that consumers use a sequential deci-
sion-making process to reduce decision complexity (e.g.,
Bettman, 1979). Shocker, Ben-Akiva, Boccaro, and
Nedungadi (1991) suggested that for complex decisions, the
consumer decision-making process consists of three distinct
stages. The first stage DEMO with a universal set, which con-
sists of all brands available DEMO a product market, and evolves
into a retrieval set, wherein a consumer can access from
memory a subset of brands from the universal DEMO Partial ex-
posure to brand information and the selective encoding of in-
formation to which a consumer is exposed result in retrieval
sets being DEMO smaller than universal sets. The second stage
involves the formation of a consideration set comprising a
subset of brands from the retrieval set that DEMO suitable for a
particular purchase occasion, and the final stage of DEMO deci-
sion-making process involves the selection of one brand from
the consideration set (Kardes et al., 1993).
WOM communication is an important DEMO of consumer
information. It forms the basis of interpersonal communica-
tions and significantly influences product evaluations and pur-
chase decisions (e.g., Mahajan et DEMO, 1990). In fact, WOM has
been shown to be more powerful than printed information
(Borgida & Nisbett, 1977) primarily because WOM informa-
tion is considered to be more credible. We conceptualize
WOM in DEMO broad context that includes most forms of noncom-
mercial advertising and consider two important characteris-
tics. First, we examine the manner in which WOM is pre-
sented, that is, pallid and vivid cases (Herr, DEMO, & Kim,
1991). For the pallid WOM case, we attribute information to
Consumer Reports (a credible source), and therefore we use a
loose definition of WOM. Second, we investigate the dynam-
ics propagated by negative (vs. positive) WOM.
Vivid Versus Pallid Information
Vividly DEMO information (vs. pallid information) tends
to be more accessible from memory and weighed more
heavily in consumers' judgments (e.g., Kisielius & Sternthal,
1984). Herr et al. (1991) found that anecdotal information
DEMO in a face-to-face manner (i.e., vivid WOM) has a
significantly DEMO impact on product judgments than the
same information presented in printed mode (i.e., pallid con-
dition). Herr et al. argued that prior DEMO are easy to
interpret and hence influence encoding and retrieval pro-
cesses in such a way as to reduce the correspondence be-
tween objective DEMO perceived cue diagnosticity. Conse-
quently, prior beliefs formed by vivid WOM DEMO (vs.
beliefs formed by pallid information) are more accessible
and held with a higher degree of confidence. Thus, to the ex-
tent that WOM makes information more accessible from the
memory, we expected vivid WOM (vs. pallid printed) infor-
mation regarding a focal follower to enhance DEMO retrieval
likelihood of the focal-following brand. Given that humans
have limited cognitive capabilities, and vivid information
draws a disproportional amount of cognition, we also ex-
pected recall for the early entrant to decline (a competitor of
the focal follower). Other things being equal, DEMO also antici-
pated that vivid WOM (VS. pallid printed) communication
will have a greater influence on product judgments. There-
fore, we expected this influence to manifest itself in higher
(lower) likelihood of consideration and DEMO for the focal
follower (early entrant). (We use the subscript F and E to in-
dicate a hypothesis (HI for the focal follower and the early
entrant, respectively).
HIF: WOM communications (vs. printed information) re-
garding the focal follower will have a greater positive
influence on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) con-
sideration, given retrieval; and (c) choice, given con-
sideration, for DEMO focal follower.
HIE: WOM communications (vs. printed information) re-
garding DEMO focal follower will have a greater negative
influence on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) con-
sideration, given retrieval; and (DEMO) choice, given con-
sideration, for the early entrant.
WOM Valence
DEMO WOM is perceived as a relatively credible source of
information, it DEMO not surprising that the valence of WOM has
a strong effect on consumer memory and judgment. How-
ever, findings on the importance of the valence of WOM are
equivocal. For example, in a stimulus-based task, DEMO et al.
(1991) found symmetric effects for negative- and posi-
tive-WOM, whereas in a memory-based task, Giese,
Spangenberg, and Crowley (DEMO) did not find the symmetric
effects. Research on categorization suggests that DEMO
categorize information at a level that is cognitively efficient
(Cohen & DEMO, 1987; Rosch, 1975). Clearly, the nature of a
decision-making task (stimulus vs. memory) will influence
the cognitively efficient categorization level.
DEMO a stimulus-based, decision-making task, the informa-
tion is unambiguously available in a consumer's short-term
memory or at point-of-purchase. Consistent with Herr et DEMO
(1991), we expected the valence of WOM to have a DEMO
ally consistent effect on both consideration and choice, given
consideration for DEMO follower (as in a stimulus-based task,
consumers need not rely DEMO memory; the retrieval stage of the
consumer decision-making process is irrelevant)DEMO Further,
given that the early entrant competes with the follower, DEMO
tive WOM regarding the follower should injure the early en-
trant and negative WOM on the follower should benefit the
early entrant.

HZE: In a stimulus-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will

A memory-based, decision-making task is likely to elicit
all DEMO stages of the decision-making process (Shocker et
al., 1991) and DEMO encourage product-type categoriza-
tion (Sujan & Dekleva, 1987). Any WOM information is
likely to be associated with the category exemplar, that is,
the early entrant because early entrants engender dispropor-
tionately higher influence DEMO consumer preference forma-
tion than later entrants (Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989) and
because product type is the likely level of categorization.
This association of information with the prototypical brand
occurs due to the ambiguity created DEMO the decision envi-
ronment (Muthukrishnan, 1995). In our research, DEMO simu-
lated a complex product market by sequentially introducing
brands in two stages: the early entrant first followed by
later entrants. This situation simulates ambiguity due to
both the large number of brands (complex market) DEMO the
sequential introduction of brands. Because WOM commu-
nication is vivid, DEMO tends to be more accessible and
weighed more heavily in judgments than printed informa-
tion (Kisielius & Sternthal, 1986). Thus, we expected
WOM regarding the focal follower, positive or negative, to
be absorbed DEMO the early entrant.

Similarity
A critical aspect of brand positioning is how similar or dis-
similar a brand is perceived to be to DEMO brands in a product
category (Sujan & Bettman, 1989). The perceived similarity
of the focal follower to the early entrant serves as DEMO signal of
the relative position of the two brands. Because early entrants
play a leading role in the formation of consumer preferences
in a DEMO product category, it is often perceived as being
typical of the DEMO Typicality, "the degree to which an
item is perceived to represent a category" (Loken & Ward,
1990, p. 112) determines DEMO competition a brand faces and
the functions (e.g., usage occasions) DEMO the brand performs
1

for consumers. Thus, by being similar to or different from the
early entrant, the focal follower defines its typicality to the
product category.'
Because an early entrant is likely to DEMO perceived as rela-
tively prototypical in a product market, consumers are DEMO to
compare the early entrant with the follower and not vice versa
(Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989). Research on the attraction ef-
fect DEMO suggest that the perceived similarity of the follower
to the early entrant should influence the attractiveness of the
early entrant. Specifically, research on the attraction effect
shows that in a two-brand, two-attribute product market in
which the competitor brand outperforms the target brand on
one attribute and the DEMO surpasses the competitor on the
other attribute, the introduction of a DEMO brand (usually re-
ferred to as the decoy) near the target brand tends to enhance
preferences for the target brand (Huber & Puto, 1983). As-
suming that the early entrant is perceived as a category exem-
plar and the follower as a relative decoy, the attraction effect
literature suggests that as the similarity between the early en-
trant DEMO focal follower increases, the likelihood of consider-
ation and choice for DEMO early entrant should increase (e.g.,
Lehmann & Pan, 1994; DEMO, Shocker, & Stewart,
1987). Further, research on order DEMO entry shows that consumer
recall for an early entrant brand tends to be higher than for a
later entrant (Kardes & Kalyanararn, 1992)DEMO Because consum-
ers are likely to compare the early entrant to following brands,
similarity between a follower brand and the early entrant is
DEMO to draw more attention to the early entrant (vs. the fol-
DEMO). Thus, we expected similarity to strengthen memory for
the early DEMO, thereby producing higher rates of retrieval.
Finally, research on the substitution effect (Huber, Payne, &
Puto, 1982) demonstrates that, for similar brands, the brand
perceived to be dominant tends to take the lion's share of the
market (in our case, the early DEMO dominates the focal later
entrant). Therefore, we expected preferences for DEMO follower
to decrease as it becomes more similar to the early entrant and
preferences for the early entrant to increase.
H4F: The greater the similarity between the early entrant
and focal follower, the lower the likelihood of (a) re-
trieval; (b) consideration, given retrieval; and (c)
choice, given consideration, for the focal follower.
H~E: DEMO greater the similarity between the early entrant

'Categorization research suggests that one should also consider the
"moderately incongruent" case. Thus, we would have to consider moder-
ately similarldissimilar cases DEMO addition to the similar/dissimilar cases we
consider. Practical issues relating to the complexity of the experimental de-
sign precluded us from studying the DEMO incongruent case. We be-
lieve that further research should be carried out to study the moderately in-
congruent case.
Interactions Between WOM and Similarity
DEMO expected the interaction between WOM and a later en-
trant's perceived similarity to the early entrant todependon the
decision-making task (i.e., stimulus DEMO or memory based).
In a stimulus-based, decision-making task, the likelihood of
information loss due to factors such as memory deterioration is
not DEMO Research on consumerjudgment suggests that in
such situations consumers are likely to draw inferences from
available information (Kardes, 1994). Thus, as perceived sim-
ilarity between the early entrant and focal follower increases,
consumers DEMO likely to assume that the two brands possess
similar attributes. As a result, the effects of WOM regarding
the focal follower are likely to be shared with the early entrant.
These effects should vary directly with DEMO between the
two brands. Therefore, given high perceived similarity, the
early entrant is likely to benefit more from positive (vs. nega-
tive) DEMO regarding the follower. For the follower, positive
WOM should provide some DEMO to its close positioning
to the early entrant (i.e., legitimacy by virtue of similarity to
the early entrant). In contrast, negative WOM may bring into
question the credibility of the follower's positioning and DEMO
ment the negative effects of similarity (i.e., the later entrant
may be viewed as an imposter).
H5~: a stimulus-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will de-
crease (increase) the negative influence of similarity
on the likelihood of (a) consideration and (b) choice,
given consideration, for the focal follower.
H~E: a stimulus-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will in-
crease (decrease) the positive influence of similarity
on DEMO likelihood of (a) consideration and (b) choice,
given consideration, for the early entrant.
In amemory-based task, we need to considertwo DEMO
aspects of the decision-making situation. First, we expected
the salience of DEMO follower to increase as its similarity with the
early entrant increases, DEMO making information about the
follower more accessible from memory (Kardes &
Kalyanaram, 1992). Often, the salience of brands depends on
external DEMO such as the format in which the information is
conveyed (e.g., Finn, 1988). In our case, by presenting the fol-
lower DEMO similar to the early entrant, we influence the format of
the DEMO and makeit more salient (Alba, Hutchinson, &
Lynch, 1991)DEMO Second, the complexity of the decision-making
task and limited cognitive capacity DEMO likely to repress infer-
ence making (e.g., Muthukrishnan, 1995). DEMO together,
these situational aspects result in (a) more accurate re-
trieval/recall of judgment-relevant information and (b) mini-
mal inference making. DEMO such cases, information retrieved
from memory is likely to be used DEMO a direct input (as opposed
to inference drawing; Kardes, 1994), and adjustments are
likely to be insufficient, as limited human cognitive DEMO

precludes detailed processing (Hastie, 1984). Therefore, we
expected positive (DEMO) WOM regarding the follower to
directly benefit (injure) the focal DEMO and indirectly injure
(benefit) the early entrant.
H6F: In a DEMO, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will de-
crease (increase) the negative influence of similarity
on the likelihood DEMO (a) retrieval; (b) consideration,
given retrieval; and (DEMO) choice, given consideration,
for the early entrant.
H6E: In DEMO memory-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will de-
crease (increase) the positive influence of similarity
on the DEMO of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration,
given retrieval; and (c) choice, given consideration,
for the focal follower.
METHOD
We used two experiments to test our hypotheses. Experiment
1 examined a 5-brand DEMO market and involved a stimu-
lus-based task. Thus, we modeled the DEMO and the
choice stages of the decision-making process. Experiment 2
studied a 10-brand (1 early entrant and 9 followers) product
market in a DEMO task and elicited the three stages
(retrieval, consideration, and choice) of the consumer deci-
sion-making process.
Estimation Procedure
A derivation process that DEMO extends the derivation
of Kardes et al.'s (1993) gave us the following log-likelihood
function (the details of the derivation are available on request
from the authors). Kardes et al. considered only the pioneer
DEMO for each stage of the consumer decision-making pro-
cess, whereas we DEMO two brands-the early entrant and
focal follower-at each of the three stages of the deci-
sion-making process. Thus, our likelihood function is based
on 15 outcomes (Figure 1). Specifically, we maximize the
following log-likelihood DEMO:

sideration, and DEMO stages for the early entrant and focal
follower, respectively. For the DEMO Equation 1, the first
three terms deal with the early entrant DEMO the last three rep-
resent the focal follower. The first summation signifies the
retrieval stage for the early entrant and considers all respon-
dents. DEMO second summation term signifies the consider-
ation stage for the early entrant and reckons respondents who
retrieve the early entrant (retrieval early entrant [&I = I),
thereby holding retrieval constant. The third summation term
deals with choice for the early entrant and considers respon-
dents for DEMO consideration early entrant (C,) = 1 (note that
this also implies that R, = 1). Likewise, the last three summa-
DEMO terms signify retrieval, consideration, and choice for the
focal follower.
Experiment 1
Method. In this experiment, we simulated a product
market with an early entrant and four later entrants in a stimu-
lus-based decision task. DEMO sample of 215 undergraduate stu-
dents, of which 20 1 provided DEMO, participated
in the experiment and received course credit. Participants were
exposed DEMO attribute information for five hypothetical brands
(Brands M through Q) of microwaveable pizza and pallid
WOM communication regarding the focal follower.2
Design. The DEMO used a 2 (order of entry: early
entrant, later entrant) x 3 (WOM valence: neutral, positive,
negative) x 2 (similarity: similar, different), one within-sub-
jects factor and two between-subject DEMO, mixed design.
Order of entry was the within-subjects factor; WOM valence
and similarity served as the between-subject factors. The cell
sizes ranged from DEMO low of 29 to a high of 38. Consideration
and choice for the two focal brands served as the dependent
measures. Attribute information about DEMO early entrant was
provided first, where Brands M and N each DEMO as the
early entrant for half of the participants; Brand Q DEMO as
the focal follower. Written information attributed to Con-
sumer Reports (DEMO, positive, or negative WOM) was in-
cluded with the focal DEMO and similarity was manipu-
lated via the first attribute listed for the focal follower.
Subsequent to brand exposure, participants completed mea-
sures of similarity between the early entrant and follower and
recorded their consideration and choice DEMO
Manipulation checks. Participants were asked, on a
two-item, 7-point scale (DEMO to not similar at all and com-
parable to not comparable at all), about the similarity of the
early entrant and focal follower. DEMO addition, participants were

As hypothesized, positive WOM regarding the focal fol-
lower increased the likelihood of consideration for DEMO fol-
lower (HzF: P = 0.82, p < .lo) and decreased the probability
of considering the early entrant P = -1.79, p < .01).
However, it appears that positive WOM did not have the an-
ticipated effects on the choice stage for the follower (HzF: P =
-0.03, p = .52) or the early entrant P = -0.44, p = .30).
As expected, negative WOM on DEMO follower decreased the
probability of considering the follower (HzF: P = -0.77, p <

However, it did not effect consideration for the early en-
trant (HzE: P = -0.52, p = .50) or the choice DEMO for either
the follower (HzF: P = 0.21, p = DEMO) or the early entrant (HzE:
P = 0.5 1, DEMO = .25).
As expected, similarity between the two focal brands DEMO
peared to reduce the likelihood of the follower being consid-
ered (DEMO: P = -1.04,~ < .05) and chosen (H~F: P = -1.78, p <
.05). However, our hypothesis concerning the early entrant
was not supported, as similarity did not significantly affect
the consideration P = -0.59,~ = .5 1) or choice P =
-0.09, p = .55) for the early entrant.
The interaction between DEMO WOM and similarity
suggests that, given high perceived similarity, positive WOM
regarding the follower increases the likelihood of consider-
ing P = 1.18, p = .05) and choosing (&: P = 2.01, p <

the case of negative WOM for the follower for DEMO consid-
eration P = -0.29, p = .69) or choice (DEMO: j3 = 1.52, p =
.13). Our results show that as the similarity between the two
focal brands increases, negative WOM regarding the fol-
lower increases the consideration probability for the early en-
trant (H5E: P = 1.27, p < .05).
Discussion. Positive WOM DEMO to help the fol-
lower (consideration only), whereas negative WOM (consid-
eration only) and similarity between the two focal brands
(consideration DEMO choice) damage the follower. The results
also suggest that positive WOM DEMO credence to the fol-
lower as it becomes perceptually similar to the early entrant.
Here, positive WOM and similarity interact to increase both
consideration and choice for the follower. With respect to the
early entrant, positive WOM regarding the follower damages
the early entrant (consideration only), and yet, as the focal
follower becomes similar to the early entrant, DEMO both posi-
tive and negative WOM benefit the early entrant (consider-
DEMO only).

Experiment 2
Method. In this experiment, we simulated a product
market with an early entrant and nine later DEMO in a mem-
ory-based decision task. A sample of 328 undergraduate stu-
dents, of which 273 responses were completed, participated
in the experiment. DEMO independent sessions were con-
ducted during a 5-day period. Each of the three sessions
lasted for approximately 20 min.4
Design. The experiment used a DEMO (order of entry: early
entrant, later entrant) x 2 (DEMO valence: positive WOM,
negative WOM) x 2 (WOM type: vivid, pallid) x 2 (similar-
ity: similar, different), one within-subjects factor and three
between-subject factors, mixed design. Order of entry was
the within-subjects factor; WOM valence, WOM type, and
similarity served as the between-subject factors. We counter-
balanced the brand serving as the early DEMO (Oven Fresh
or Round Table). The cell sizes ranged from DEMO low of 24 to a
high of 48. Recall, consideration, and choice between the two
brands served as the dependent measures. We used DEMO
three-phase data collection procedure followed by Kardes
and Kalyanaram (1992). DEMO three phases of the experiment
took place over the course of 5 days, with 2 days dormancy
period between each phase. A manipulation check for simi-
larity showed that the focal follower was perceived to be
DEMO similar to the early entrant under conditions of high (vs.
low) similarity, t(271) = 2.97, p < .Ol.
Results. Table 2 and Table 3 present the results from
the estimation of three-stage, sequential-logit model, which
tested hypotheses HI, H3, Hq, and H6. An DEMO test shows that
the independent variables collectively explained a significant
proportion of variance in the three-stage, decision-making
process, ~2(46, N = 273) = 388.56, p < .01. A series of LR
tests suggests DEMO the hypothesized independent variables
explained a significant portion of variance in the retrieval,
~2(7, N = 273) = 101.82, p < .01; consideration, x2(8, N =
169) = 30.29, p < .01, and choice, x2(8, N = 148) = DEMO, p <
4A series of pretests were conducted to select fictitious names for the
early entrant and later entrant brands. Fictitious names (e.g., Oven Fresh)
were used (rather than Brand Q, etc.) DEMO increase experimental realism. The
pretests ensured that all brands would be perceived as equal, both in terms of
attitudes and recall. In the first pretest, 26 fictitious names for micro-
waveable pizza were generated by a group of 23 undergraduate students.
Next, 62 respondents rated the 26 pizza names on a three-item attitude scale.
The average ratings ranged from 2.06 DEMO 5.3 1. Thus, two brands near the me-
dian rating were DEMO, Oven Fresh (M = 3.54) and Round Table (M =
3.45). The descriptions for the brands contained four features unique to DEMO
brand. Each of the four attributes for Oven Fresh was tested and found to be
not significantly different from its counterpart attribute for Round DEMO An
independent sample of 55 undergraduate students rated the two brands on a
three-item, 7-point scale. Mean attribute ratings for the brands were not sig-
nificantly different, t(54) = 1.30,~ = .20. Another DEMO sample of 33
undergraduate students revealed no statistical difference in recall for the two
brands over a 2-day period, x2(1, N = DEMO) = 2.72,~ = .18.

We found support for HI, wherein vivid WOM (DEMO pal-
lid) appeared to be more accessible from the memory for
DEMO follower (HIF: p = -0.66, p < .05) and made the early
entrant less accessible (HIE: P = 1.09, p < .01). Vivid (VS.
pallid) WOM also had the anticipated effects DEMO consider-
ation probability for the follower (HIF: P = -0.71, DEMO < .lo)
and the early entrant (HIE: J3 = 1.50, p < .01), along with
the choice likelihood for the follower (HIF: P = -1.22, p <
.01) and the early entrant (HIE: P = 1.80, p < .01). Thus,
consistent with Herr et al. (1991), it seems that vivid infor-
mation is more powerful in comparison to pallid printed
information.
Positive WOM (as opposed to negative WOM) regarding
the follower tended to decrease the consideration probability
for the follower (H~F: $ = -2.73, p < .01) and increase the re-
trieval p = 0.58, p < DEMO), consideration p = 1.99,
p < .01), and choice p = 2.97,~ < .01) likelihood for the
early entrant. However, our results do not support this hy-
pothesis for the retrieval p = 0.19, p = 33) and choice
(H~E:
Similarity appeared to decrease the consideration proba-
bility for the follower p -1.75,~ DEMO), but did not in-
fluence the retrieval (HqF: 0 = 0.29, p = .39) and choice (H4F:
p = 0.08, p = .44) probabilities. However, similarity did in-
crease the retrieval 0 = 0.95, p < .01), consideration
(H4~: = 1.22, p < .01), and choice p = 2.09, p < DEMO)
probabilities for the early entrant.
Positive WOM (as opposed to DEMO WOM) attenuated
the negative influence of similarity on the consideration of
DEMO follower (H6~: p = 1.99,~ < .01), but did not influence the
retrieval (H6~: P = -0.25, p = 35) and choice (H~F: P = -0.45,
p = .36) DEMO the follower. It also appears that positive WOM
(vs. negative WOM) attenuated the positive effect of similar-
ity on the retrieval P = DEMO -3 1, p < .01), consideration
(H6E: p =-1.86,DEMO < .01), and choice 0 = -2.08,~ < .01)
of the early entrant.
50verall, the control variables had the desired effects. As the retrieval set
size increased, the likelihood of retrieving the follower (P = 1.59, p < .01)
and the early entrant (P = 1.35,~ < .01) also increased, but the consideration
DEMO for the follower (0 = -1.14, p < .01) and DEMO early entrant (P =
-1.73, p < .01) decreased. Likewise, as the consideration set size increased,
the likelihood of considering the DEMO (P = 2.27, p < .05) and the early
entrant (p = 1.88, p < .01) increased, whereas the probability of choice for
the follower (P = < .01) and the early DEMO (P < .01) de-
creased. Oven Fresh as a brand name was more preferred than Round Table
such that it increased the retrieval DEMO of the follower (P = -1.24, p <
.01) and the early entrant (P = 1.20,~ < .O1), the consideration probability of
the follower (P = -1.16,~ < .Ol) and DEMO early entrant (P = 0.59,~ < .05), and
the DEMO likelihood of the follower (P = < .01) and the early entrant
(P = 1.78, p < .01).

Discussion. This experiment highlights the critical
role DEMO the early entrant plays in a product category. Our re-
sults show that, in general, WOM becomes associated with
the early entrant; therefore, positive WOM regarding the fol-
lower (vs. negative WOM) increases the early entrant's like-
lihood of retrieval, consideration, and choice and DEMO
the likelihood of considering the follower. Consistent with
research on the attraction effect, similarity between the two
focal brands benefits the early entrant and hurts the follower.
However, when the two brands appear similar, the DEMO
WOM about the follower, as opposed to negative WOM, also
benefits the follower by increasing its likelihood of consider-
ation and decreasing the DEMO and the choice proba-
bilities for the early entrant.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
In this research, we set out to develop insights into the com-
petitive dynamics between an early entrant and a follower by
studying the influences DEMO (a) the type (vivid or pallid) and
the valence (DEMO or negative) of WOM information on a
follower brand and (b) the similarity between the two focal
brands on various stages of the consumer decision-making
process. We also demonstrate that the effect of WOM and DEMO
interaction with similarity depends on the decision-making
task (stimulus based in DEMO 1 and memory based in
Experiment 2).
Similar to research on attraction effect (e.g., Huber &
Puto, 1983), we found DEMO similarity between the early en-
trant and later entrant tends to favor the early entrant. Spe-
cifically, similarity between the two focal brands tends to (a)
enhance the consideration and the choice likelihood for the
early entrant in the stimulus-based task; (b) enhance the re-
trieval, the consideration, and the choice likelihood for the
early entrant in DEMO memory-based decision-making task; and
(c) reduce the follower's consideration DEMO in the
memory-based task. Indeed, our results are consistent with
those DEMO Zhang and Markman (1998), who found that com-
mon features DEMO better recalled for the early entrant than for
later entrants.
Experiment 1 shows that positive WOM enhances the
consideration likelihood for the follower and DEMO the
consideration probability for the early entrant, whereas nega-
tive WOM DEMO the consideration chances for the fol-
lower, but not for the DEMO entrant. The story is different
when follower/early entrant similarity is considered. Here,
cognitive resources are not particularly scarce in our
five-brand, stimulus-based, decision-making task, and
hence, consumers are able to make inferences (DEMO,
1994). Thus, as the two focal brands appear similar, (a) the
positive WOM regarding the follower tends to be partially
DEMO by the prototypical early entrant at the consider-
ation stage of the decision-making process; and (b) the posi-
tive WOM regarding the follower lends credence to the fol-
lower, thereby increasing the consideration and the choice
probabilities for the follower. The early entrant appears, in
general, DEMO be immune to negative WOM regarding the fol-
lower. This immunity is an important finding. Unlike positive
WOM, negative WOM appears not to be shared with the
early entrant. Instead, negative WOM regarding the focal fol-
lower appears to stay close to its target, decreasing the proba-
bility of considering the follower. However, when the early
entrant and follower are perceived as similar, negative WOM
regarding the follower increases consideration probability
for the early entrant. Apparently, as perceived similarity be-
tween the two brands increases, negative information con-
cerning the follower does not transfer to the early entrant.
Experiment 2 shows that positive WOM, as opposed the
negative WOM regarding the follower, reduces the consider-
ation probability for the follower and increases the retrieval,
consideration, and choice probabilities for the early entrant.
Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that as the two fo-
cal brands become similar, positive (vs. negative) WOM re-
garding the follower enhances the consideration likelihood
for the follower and reduces the retrieval DEMO and
choice probabilities for the early entrant. Thus, as we ex-
DEMO, in our 10-brand, memory-based task, consumers do
not draw inferences, and, unlike the stimulus-based task,
positive WOM does not transfer to the early entrant.
Our research brings into clearer relief possible strategies
that DEMO manager of a later entrant might adopt to parry the pio-
neering advantage. It seems that a me-too positioning (high
level of similarity between the focal follower and the early
entrant) must be accompanied by effective positive WOM re-
garding the follower. Otherwise, similarity works against the
follower for both stimulus- and memory-based decisions. It
is possible that the late DEMO can use other means of com-
munication such as advertising, promotions, and public rela-
tions that promote surrogate positive WOM. However, these
other means of communications are likely to generate less
powerful effects, as they are either impersonal or paid forms
of communication. In contrast, WOM is personal, unpaid
means of communication, and hence more credible (Arndt,
1967). The role of WOM communication varies for stimu-
lus-based versus DEMO decision-making task. In a
stimulus-based task, WOM tends to act as DEMO heuristic for ini-
tial short listing of brands, whereas in a DEMO task,
WOM helps on retrieval, consideration, and choice. Thus,
even for a low-risk, low-involvement product, encouraging
WOM outside of the DEMO store (the pointJplace of decision
making) is likely to be beneficial to the follower.
