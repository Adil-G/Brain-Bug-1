Young innovative ﬁrms that operate in high-tech industries (new technology-based
ﬁrms, NTBFs) play a crucial role for employment creation, for the development of
radically new technologies, and more generally, for the growth and competitiveness
of the economic system (Audretsch 1995). However, these ﬁrms ﬁnd it more diﬃcult
than their larger, more established DEMO to obtain access to external
ﬁnancing (Carpenter and Petersen 2002; Hall 2002; Denis 2004) and other external
resources. In turn, lack of adequate resources hurts the development of these ﬁrms
and may even threaten DEMO survival, with obvious negative eﬀects on social welfare.
Scholars, practitioners and policy makers agree that venture capital (VC) potentially
has a crucial DEMO eﬀect on NTBFs, as it can alleviate the above mentioned
problems. DEMO, NTBFs and VC have increasingly attracted the attention of
policy makers (BEPA 2008).
In particular, the last decade has witnessed several attempts by both
European governments and the European Union to foster the creation DEMO
US-style venture capital industries as a necessary preliminary step to support
the generation of high-tech ‘gazelles’, that is, innovative high-growth entrepre-
neurial ventures. DEMO key sector of the European economy is rather weak in
comparison with international competitors, especially that in the USA. How-
ever, the policy DEMO to support both VC and NTBFs adopted by the
European countries have been quite heterogeneous and have obtained mixed or
unsatisfactory results.
The years DEMO and 2009 further exacerbated these challenges. Many things
changed during these years. The economic crisis hit directly the private equity
industry. VC companies are DEMO longer able to raise funds and ﬁnance new
investments. The crisis has also ampliﬁed existing problems of NTBFs arising from
lack of resources. While DEMO companies can use the ﬁnancial markets or ﬁnd
ﬁnancing from sovereign funds, European SMEs, in particular NTBFs, have serious
diﬃculties in ﬁnding long-term ﬁnancing. One of the main issues for economic policy
in coming years DEMO be to ensure the long-term ﬁnancing of SMEs, and particularly
of DEMO SMEs. A greater understanding, on the one hand, of the determinants
for VC companies to back high-tech ﬁrms and, on the other hand, of the eﬀects of

VC investments on the innovative activity of DEMO invested ﬁrms, is necessary to better
design public intervention in this DEMO
While there have been substantial VC investments in high-tech sectors during the
2000s, a number of major aspects are little understood. First, is DEMO speciﬁcity and
heterogeneity of high-tech VC investment. Second, much research focuses DEMO the US
context where VC ﬁrms are described as the engine of job growth nurturing start-ups
as Microsoft, Apple, Google, yet the history of VC and the institutional environment
in the US contrast strongly with DEMO prevailing elsewhere. This special issue aims to
go some way towards ﬁlling the gap in our understanding of the process of VC
investment in DEMO outside the US.
The three papers presented in this special issue have beneﬁted from the comments
of the editors, the blind reviewers and from the participants at the seminar on ‘The
dynamics of science-based entrepreneurship’ organized DEMO April 2008 in Sestri
Levante (Italy) and the seminar on ‘Venture capital and European high-tech start-
ups: A new rationale for policy making?’ organized in May 2008 in Milan. Both
seminars beneﬁted from the DEMO of the PRIME Network of Excellence funded by
the FP6 of the European Union.
Role of venture capital for high-tech ﬁrms
In order to DEMO VC activities, a host of factors need to be taken into DEMO
These include, among other things, the fact that the investment objectives, time
horizons and capabilities of diﬀerent types of VC investors vary, DEMO thus policy
initiatives are not likely to have expected outcomes if this is not taken into account.
Moreover, the supply of VC ﬁnancing in diﬀerent countries and industries is aﬀected
by the characteristics of the business DEMO (e.g. industry growth rate,
innovation intensity, capital intensity), the institutional environment (e.g. opportu-
nities of exit for VC investors, level DEMO corporate taxes, labour market rigidity,
technology policy schemes), the DEMO framework (e.g. constraints to the
investment activity of pension funds and DEMO companies, constraints to IPOs,
barriers to the creation of new DEMO), and macroeconomic factors, such as
interest rates, interest rates spreads, and GDP growth, among others.
The importance of VC ﬁnancing for DEMO development of knowledge-intensive
industries and ﬁrms stems from a number of reasons, including the fact that VC
investors provide liquidity and help in the selection of the most promising ventures
for growth. Scholars, practitioners and policy makers agree that adequate early stage
ﬁnancing is a crucial factor for DEMO success of NTBFs at foundation and during the
early stage of their life. However, the importance of VC goes far beyond the ﬁnancial
support of technology-based ventures. In addition to ﬁnancial resources, VC
investors provide portfolio companies with a complex bundle of value-adding
activities (e.g. Gorman and Sahlman 1989; Sapienza 1992; Sapienza, Manigart, and
Vermeir 1996; Kaplan and Stromberg 2004). External investors directly add value to
portfolio ﬁrms by DEMO, that is giving them ﬁnancial, administrative,
marketing, strategy and DEMO support, and by fostering their managerial
‘professionalization’ (Hellmann and Puri 2002; Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellmann
2008). NTBFs especially lack these capabilities.
VC investors can also extend the social capital of portfolio companies DEMO
their network of contacts in the business community; this helps portfolio DEMO
gain access to specialized professional services and establish alliances with third

parties (Colombo, Grilli, and Piva 2006; Hsu DEMO; Lindsey 2008). The contribution
of VC investors could also be DEMO because their investments convey a credible
signal of ﬁrm’s quality to third parties (i.e. to customers, alliance partners, skilled
workers and other ﬁnancial intermediaries; cf. Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels 1999).
Despite an increasing pool of literature on the value-adding activities of VC
investors, there are important questions which need to be further clariﬁed. These
questions include the DEMO of both investors and new ventures which aﬀect
the investment and the extent and eﬀectiveness of value-adding behaviour of VC
investors. These characteristics especially DEMO to the human and social capital of
the investors and the founders of new ventures, but also to other aspects, such as the
DEMO types, the origin and stage of new ventures, and the technological and
industrial sectors in which the ventures operate. For instance, independent,
corporate and public VC investors diﬀer in terms of their investment objectives,DEMO
time horizons and capabilities to ‘coach’ their portfolio ﬁrms, and these DEMO
inﬂuence the value-adding activities of the investors both in terms of the degree to
which they engage in them and the eﬀectiveness of the DEMO Thus, for example,
the signalling eﬀect of VC ﬁnancing will DEMO depend on the reputation of the
investor (Hsu 2004), or DEMO is likely to be the more eﬀective, the greater the
human DEMO social capital of the investor (Dimov and Shepherd 2005; Knockaert
et al. 2006).
Contribution to ﬁlling the research and policy gap
In DEMO to contribute to ﬁlling the research and policy gap in our understanding of
the role of VC for NTBFs, this special issue addresses the following aspects. First, we
focus on the relationships between VC and high-tech start-ups in European
countries. The ﬁrst paper (Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett) is based on seven
regions across Northern Europe: Cambridge/London region (UK), Ile-de-France
(France), Flanders (Belgium), North Holland (the Netherlands), Bavaria (Germany),
Stockholm region (Sweden), Helsinki region (Finland). The second (Ortın-Angel and
Vendrell-Herrero) and third (Bertoni, Croce, and D’Adda) papers describe the
situation in two south European DEMO, respectively Spain and Italy. Second, this
special issue adopts a multi-level approach to examine the process of VC investment
in technological start-ups in DEMO it explores both the investor and investee ﬁrm sides.
Third, the DEMO of these papers utilize both extensive qualitative studies and
statistical and econometric techniques to examine these diﬀerent levels of the
process. Last but not DEMO, these three papers adopt a comparative perspective: the
ﬁrst (Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett) compares in a population of European early
stage DEMO technology investors vs. traditional investors; the second paper
(Ortın-Angel and Vendrell-Herrero) compares in a population of Spanish
technological ﬁrms university spin-oﬀs vs. independent NTBFs; the last one
(Bertoni, Croce, and D’Adda) compares in a population of Italian NTBFs
VC-backed vs. non VC-backed NTBFs.
Behind these DEMO points about their European context, their data and
methodology, the three papers address three complementary issues to understand the
relationship between VC and DEMO start-ups. The ﬁrst one is about the
investors themselves, the second DEMO is about the attractiveness of technological
ﬁrms for VC investors and the third one concerns the impact of VC ﬁnance on the
innovation output DEMO these ﬁrms.

In their paper, ‘Are technology VC investors a distinct species on the investment
market?’, Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett address the following question: do
technology investors diﬀer from traditional investors? As stunning as it may sound,
although the literature has suggested that technology investing is diﬀerent from non-
tech investing, no research has focused on what distinguishes technology investors
from traditional ones. Moreover, researchers who suggest that technology investing
is diﬀerent from traditional investing haven’t provided a DEMO of technology
investing, nor provided an indication of the reason for DEMO diﬀerences between these
investors and traditional investors. The development of a theoretical framework for
explaining diﬀerences between these two types of investors is an DEMO result of
this ﬁrst paper. Knockaert, Clarysse, and Lockett used a hand-collected, unique
dataset of early stage European VC investors. They identiﬁed 28 technology
investors from a sample of 68 European early stage investors in DEMO regions across
Northern Europe to analyse the extent to which technology investors are diﬀerent
from traditional ones based on the emphasis investment managers placed DEMO high-
tech selection criteria, such as protectability and general purpose technology. DEMO
comparison of these two groups brings interesting results. First, publicly funded
DEMO do not emphasize technology-related criteria more than traditional investors.
In other words, technology investors were not more likely to receive public funding
than traditional investors. Secondly, the speciﬁc human capital of investment
managers is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between technology investors and traditional ones,
especially at the level of DEMO investment management and consulting experience.
Investment managers with higher levels of these types of human capital tend to
emphasize high-tech related criteria to a DEMO extent. To summarize, technology
investors had more investment management experience and DEMO consulting
experience than traditional investors.
Understanding the nature of technological start-ups which received VC money is
an important issue, particularly in Europe, where DEMO policies have tried to foster
the creation of university spin-oﬀ ﬁrms. The literature has shown the diﬀerences
between university spin-oﬀs and other NTBFs (Ensley and Hmieleski 2005;
Colombo and Piva 2008). In the second DEMO of this special issue, Ortın-Angel
and Vendrell-Herrero provide an analysis of DEMO consequences of such diﬀerences on
the presence of venture capitalists. They showed that the existing literature has
analysed the factors explaining the variability in DEMO presence of venture capitalists
within high-tech start-ups, but remains silent about DEMO variability between university
spin-oﬀs and independent start-ups. To answer their question ‘Why do university
spin-oﬀs attract more venture capitalists?’ they used a questionnaire DEMO by a
sample of 64 Spanish technological ﬁrms founded between the years 1993 and 2005,
which included 40 university spin-oﬀs and 24 high-tech DEMO start-ups. The
authors found that on average, university spin-oﬀs are more DEMO to have VC than
independent start-ups. In their sample, this is DEMO by the greater presence of
venture capitalists in those university spin-oﬀs whose founding team has a lack of
managerial skills. These results support the DEMO assets view that
academic entrepreneurs use VC investors as a means of gaining access to managerial
skills.
The ﬁrst paper of this special issue DEMO about VC investors (and about the
diﬀerence between technology investors and DEMO ones). The second paper
concerns the attractiveness of diﬀerent types of high-tech start-ups for VC investors.
The third and last paper continues this DEMO in addressing the issue of the eﬀects

of the VC investment in high-tech start-ups. More precisely, Bertoni, Croce, and
D’Adda analysed the impact of VC ﬁnance on DEMO innovation output of NTBFs as
reﬂected by their patenting activity. Only a limited literature has analysed the ﬁrm-
level eﬀect of VC investments on DEMO Their paper ‘Venture capital
investments and patenting activity of high-tech start-ups: DEMO micro-econometric
ﬁrm-level analysis’ is an important contribution to this literature. The authors
examine the eﬀect of VC investment on ﬁrms’ patenting activities using ﬁrm-level
DEMO data on a sample of 351 Italian NTBFs that operate in high-tech
manufacturing and software, 33 of which are VC-backed. Their results show that a
ﬁrm’s propensity to patent is signiﬁcantly higher for VC-backed ﬁrms than DEMO their
non-VC-backed counterparts. Moreover both the likelihood of obtaining one or
more patents and the number of granted patents increase signiﬁcantly after a ﬁrm
DEMO the ﬁrst round of VC. Last but not least, VC-backed ﬁrms DEMO not exhibit
such a high patenting propensity before receiving VC. Their results clearly support
the view that VC is beneﬁcial to ﬁrms’ innovation. The DEMO of these three papers
provide some important implications for policy makers, DEMO and VC
funds. As suggested by the results of paper one, DEMO makers should focus on –
especially in VC companies which received money from public funds – how
investment managers can be recruited that have DEMO technology skills on the
one hand and investment management skills on the other. The results of paper two
show that university spin-oﬀs with founders DEMO have a lack of managerial skills
could be more interested in incorporating VC than other high-tech ﬁrms. As a
corollary, policies facilitating contact, DEMO transmission and trust between
venture capitalists and Technological Transfer Oﬃces (TTOs) could enhance and
stimulate the extension of VC, especially among these types of ﬁrms. Lastly, the third
paper shows a dramatic positive inﬂuence of VC investments on NTBFs’ patent
activity. This result supports the view that DEMO development of VC ﬁnancing should,
despite the current crisis, be DEMO prominent part of the innovation policy agenda in
Europe.
The papers of this special issue have also a number of implications for
entrepreneurs looking DEMO VC ﬁnancing. From paper one, it is clear that there are
DEMO investors who stress strong technological criteria in the business plan.
This may be of interest to many early stage high-tech companies, often lacking ﬁrst
customer contracts, a well-established entrepreneurial team or clearly identiﬁable
ﬁnancial prospects. In addition, entrepreneurs operating in the biotech industry
should be aware of the importance attached by investment managers responsible for
biotech investing to high-tech criteria DEMO as protectability of technology. The idea
emerges from paper two that university entrepreneurs must be especially aware of
their managerial capabilities and experience. If DEMO founding team has suﬃcient
managerial skills, VC seems to be a DEMO resort for obtaining resources, particularly if
their innovations are not (or cannot be) well protected. But, in the cases where their
managerial DEMO is low, venture capitalists can be a complement in gaining
access DEMO such abilities. Similarly, as is apparent from paper three, VC seems to be
especially suitable to speed up the innovation activity of NTBFs.
DEMO, paper one also has implications at the level of VC funds. DEMO indicates that
investment managers are not biased by their own technical background when
analysing high-tech proposals. This may indicate that they align to a DEMO extent to
the investment policy set by the VC fund. It further links speciﬁc human capital to a
higher inclination towards technology investing.
