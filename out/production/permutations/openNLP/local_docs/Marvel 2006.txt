Abstract
Survey-based research was used to investigate technology entrepreneurs’ (n=145)
knowledge within the venture creation process and the innovativeness of their product or DEMO
Technology entrepreneurs recalled their prior knowledge at the time their opportunity was first
recognized and the gained knowledge between opportunity recognition and venture formation
DEMO Shane’s (2000) knowledge framework. Constructivist learning theory was drawn on to
demonstrate how knowledge is constructed within the venture creation process and shaped DEMO
innovation outcomes using a scale developed from the radical innovation literature.
Constructivist learning emphasizes the building that occurs in peoples’ minds as they construct
DEMO and used to understand the development of an opportunity. The results of the study
support the view of venture creation as a constructive knowledge-based DEMO process.
Results showed both prior knowledge at opportunity recognition and gained knowledge forward
to venture formation are vital to explaining the radicalness of succeeding DEMO outcomes.
These findings support previous research that theorized the importance of individual differences
in knowledge and demonstrated how differences in these knowledge mechanisms result DEMO
differences in innovation outcomes. Opportunities with radical innovation outcomes were
positively associated with prior technology knowledge at opportunity recognition while prior
knowledge of ways DEMO serve markets was negatively associated with innovation radicalness. This
finding was somewhat counterintuitive—the less one knows about ways to serve a particular
market at DEMO recognition, the better the chance of using prior technology knowledge to
DEMO breakthrough innovations within it. Once an opportunity had been recognized, gained
DEMO was needed in larger amounts for radical innovation more so than for incremental
innovation. Therefore, persons who embrace and practice learning may be better prepared to
develop and exploit an opportunity with more radical outcomes. These DEMO suggest that the
sequence as well as the presence of knowledge play an essential role in explaining the creation
of breakthrough innovation.
Purpose of DEMO Study
The purpose of the study was to explore the knowledge of technology entrepreneurs within
the venture creation process and link to innovation outcomes.  Prior knowledge at opportunity
recognition and gained knowledge forward until the venture DEMO were assessed using scales
developed from a constructivist view of Shane’s (DEMO) knowledge framework. The framework
includes: (1) ways to serve markets, (2) customer problems, (3) technology, and (4) markets.
Behaviors have been shown to differ across industries and consequently the knowledge DEMO
the venture creation process may differ respectively.  Therefore, the assessed prior knowledge
and gained knowledge types were compared to determine if they differ DEMO industry and
controlled for accordingly.  The innovativeness of the venture’s product DEMO service was measured
using a scale developed from the incremental and radical innovation literature. The predictive
relationship between knowledge within the venture creation process DEMO innovation outcomes
was explored.

Method
A purposeful sample (n =145) was used consisting of technology DEMO (i.e.,
founders of technology-based ventures) in incubators throughout the Midwest.  Incubators were
targeted to identify technology entrepreneurs who recently started a venture and to minimize
recall.  In total, 13 incubators took part in DEMO study which resulted in 145 meetings with
founders of young technology ventures.  Survey items addressed types of knowledge and were
developed from the knowledge framework using deductive scale development.  Survey items
also concerned the innovativeness of the product or service and developed from research
distinguishing among incremental and DEMO innovation (i.e., Hage, 1980; Leifer, McDermott,
O’Connor, Peters, Rice & Veryzer, 2000.  Experts in scale development and entrepreneurship
research were consulted throughout construction of the items and scales.

Discussion of Results
The results of the study support previous research that DEMO the importance of individual
differences in knowledge and entrepreneurship as a learning process. Some of the findings
compliment previous theoretical and empirical work while DEMO findings reveal new knowledge.
The discussion of results is organized by the four research questions of the study. Each research
question is presented followed DEMO a summation and discussion of the results.
Research Question 1: What DEMO of prior knowledge was present when the opportunity was first
recognized?
Of the four prior knowledge variables, technology knowledge was scored highest at
opportunity recognition followed by ways to serve markets, customer problems, and DEMO
Considering technology knowledge was scored highest, this finding suggests that prior
DEMO of technology may be of greatest value for opportunity recognition in the context of
technology entrepreneurship. Prior knowledge of ways to serve markets, customer problems, and
technology were all scored more similarly compared to prior knowledge of markets—which was
scored noticeably lower.  Therefore, one might conclude that DEMO former three types of
knowledge were more conducive to opportunity recognition more so than prior knowledge of
markets.  Another explanation may be that, DEMO general, the starting point for technology
entrepreneurship is a particular technology DEMO to have value especially considering the
disparity between technology and market knowledge.  This would support the case of a
technology in search of an application, meaning a form of entrepreneurship in which a person is
knowledgeable of a technology having a unique capability although the person does not DEMO
what market would have need for such a capability.
Research Question 2: What mix of knowledge was gained from the time the opportunity was first
recognized forward to venture launch?
Of the four gained knowledge DEMO, customer problems scored highest followed by
technology, ways to serve markets, and markets.  Taken in aggregate the four gained knowledge
variables were DEMO very similarly.  This finding suggests the four knowledge types may be
DEMO in comparable amounts following opportunity recognition forward until a venture is
launched.  While previous research has examined the knowledge necessary for opportunity
recognition, DEMO literature is devoid of the knowledge resources needed after discovery until a
venture is launched.  Given the similar gained knowledge variable scores, there DEMO evidence that
the knowledge types identified by Shane (2000) are pertinent not only to opportunity recognition
but to the venture creation process as DEMO whole.
Research Question 3: Do research questions 1 and 2 differ DEMO industry?
A multiple analysis of variance was performed indicated there were no statistically
significant differences between the knowledge variables and industry category.  This finding
indicates that neither the prior knowledge types present at opportunity recognition DEMO the gained
knowledge types forward from opportunity recognition to venture launch differ by industry in
the context of technology entrepreneurship.

Research Question 4: What mix of knowledge within the venture creation process predicts
radical innovation outcomes?
a. Does prior knowledge, gained knowledge, DEMO both prior and gained knowledge
together best predict radical innovation outcomes?
b. What knowledge types within prior and gained knowledge best predict radical
DEMO outcomes?
To respond to Research Question 4a and thus determine the knowledge mixes that best
explain innovation, hierarchical multiple regression was employed.  DEMO prior knowledge mix at
opportunity recognition and the gained knowledge mix both individually and collectively played
a critical role in explaining succeeding innovation outcomes.  Each set of knowledge variables
(i.e., prior, gained, and prior DEMO gained together) explained a significant portion of variance.
Although the best DEMO of innovation outcomes was when the prior and gained knowledge
sets were used together.  This indicates that creating innovation is not solely dependent on
knowledge during opportunity recognition or the following gained knowledge until exploitation.
Instead, innovation is an outcome of a constructive process where both sequences of DEMO
are used together to shape succeeding outcomes. Knowledge is constructed during recognition of
the opportunity and further assembled within the process resulting in a DEMO  These sequences
of knowledge development within the venture creation process have DEMO consequences as they
impact innovation outcomes and are discussed further. These results provide evidence the
knowledge-based process of venture creation explained subsequent innovation outcomes.
DEMO respond to Research Question 4b and thus determine the knowledge types within prior
and gained knowledge that best predict the radicalness of innovation outcomes  the eight
knowledge types considered in the regression were examined further.  These included the four
prior knowledge type variables and four gained knowledge type DEMO  The four prior
knowledge types are discussed first followed by the DEMO gained knowledge types and their affect
on innovation radicalness.
Prior Knowledge Types and Innovation Radicalness
Prior technology knowledge at opportunity recognition was the single DEMO predictor overall
and positively correlated to innovation radicalness.  This finding underscores DEMO vitality of
technology knowledge at opportunity recognition to radical innovation.  Individuals DEMO greater
technology knowledge or who have a heightened alertness to technology knowledge at discovery
are better equipped to create breakthrough innovations.  Both prior knowledge of ways to serve
markets and prior knowledge of markets at opportunity DEMO were significant and
negatively correlated with innovation radicalness.  This indicates that DEMO knowledge types
seemingly stifle radical innovation.  This suggests technology entrepreneurs were DEMO prepared
to create breakthrough products or services the less they knew about their future markets or
about ways to package their product or service.  Over familiarity with markets and development
standards may hinder discovery or exploitation DEMO opportunities with radical outcomes.
Knowledge of markets and ways to serve markets may lead to preconceived notions of the
possibilities and limit the opportunities DEMO and developed.  Considerable knowledge of
5
the accepted standards and behaviors of markets may precondition a person to DEMO potential
opportunities with radical outcomes and therefore limit their opportunity set. A person who is not
conditioned to the accepted norms of a market DEMO development processes, but rich with
technology knowledge, are best positioned to recognize, develop and exploit opportunities with
breakthrough potential.
Gained Knowledge Types and Innovation Radicalness
Gained knowledge of ways to serve markets, technology, and DEMO were all statistically
significant in explaining radical innovation.  However, gained knowledge of technology and
markets was positively correlated with radical innovation while ways DEMO serve markets was
negatively correlated with radical innovation. Given that gained knowledge of technology and
markets were positively correlated with radical innovation indicates that DEMO who create
breakthrough products and services learn at increased levels compared to their less radical—or
incremental—counterparts.  One explanation for this higher level of learning may be necessity.
The entrepreneur has technology knowledge suspected to have value DEMO therefore learning to
further develop their opportunity.  The opportunity is constructed DEMO different types and amounts
of knowledge and when arranged in a particular way, specific to the individual, it is exploited
through the launch DEMO their venture.  Another explanation for the higher level of gained
knowledge DEMO be that those technology entrepreneurs who create radical innovation embrace
learning to a greater extent than those who create incremental innovation.  This supports the
argument that venture creation is a learning process and therefore individuals who DEMO
continuous learning may be better equipped for more desirable outcomes.  Gained DEMO of
ways to serve markets was the only gained knowledge type negatively correlated to innovation
radicalness and was significant in explaining innovation outcomes.  An explanation may be
technology entrepreneurs who create breakthrough innovation are most concerned DEMO
identifying potential customers and identifying which markets their technology is best suited for.
Before technology entrepreneurs are concerned with specific standards, development processes
and ways to package their solution for a particular application the customers and DEMO must
be identified.  Until a threshold of customers and markets knowledge DEMO met, the technology
entrepreneur can not adequately package their solution for DEMO and market applications.
Knowledge and Innovation Graphical Analysis
To demonstrate the relationship between knowledge types and high and low innovation, two
graphical analyses were performed. The innovation variable was used to create two groups of
cases DEMO included a high group (n=23) typifying radical innovation that scored one standard
deviation above the innovation variable mean and a low group (n=23) typifying incremental
innovation that scored one standard deviation below the innovation variable mean.  Two sets of
relationships were plotted and included the prior knowledge variable means of the two
innovation groups, and the gained knowledge variable means of the two innovation groups.  The
four knowledge types were plotted along the x-axis, mean knowledge scores were plotted along
the y-axis, DEMO high and low innovation lines displayed within the plot area.  The DEMO
between the prior knowledge variable means and the innovation groups is illustrated in Figure 2
and the relationship between the gained knowledge variable means DEMO the innovation groups is
shown in Figure 3.

knowledge type except prior knowledge of technology.  For the high innovation group, the prior
technology knowledge mean was DEMO followed by customer problems, ways to serve markets,
and markets. DEMO the low innovation group, the prior knowledge of ways to serve DEMO mean
was highest followed by technology, customer problems, and markets.

Figure 3 reveals the means for gained knowledge of customer problems, technology and

The gained knowledge of ways to serve markets mean was similar across both the high and low
innovation groups.  For the high innovation group, the mean gained knowledge of customer
problems was highest followed by technology, markets, and ways to serve markets.  For the low
innovation group, the mean score for ways to serve markets was highest, followed by customer
problems, technology, and markets. Of note, the mean gained knowledge of ways to serve
markets was the least gained knowledge type for high innovation compared to the highest gained
knowledge DEMO for low innovation.
Contributions
This study represents the inaugural investigation of a knowledge-based view of technology
entrepreneurship and contributes to the literature in four DEMO ways.  First, the study
compliments the work of Shane (2000) as scales were developed from his knowledge framework
and used to provide DEMO richer understanding of knowledge within venture creation than previously
available.  Shane (2000) introduced the types of knowledge necessary to recognize opportunities
but not until this study were the amounts and importance of these prior knowledge DEMO known.
Therefore, the research extends what has been a partial understanding DEMO knowledge at
opportunity recognition.  Second, the research provides a baseline understanding of the mix of
knowledge sought out from opportunity recognition until the DEMO of a venture.  The evidence
suggests the knowledge types identified by DEMO (2000) are pertinent not only to opportunity
recognition but to the venture creation process as a whole. Third, the study demonstrates that the
prior knowledge mix at opportunity recognition and the gained knowledge mix from DEMO
recognition forward to launch each play a critical role in explaining subsequent innovation
outcomes. Although research has empirically linked entrepreneurship to innovation at a DEMO
level how this is accomplished through knowledge at a micro-level has eluded scholars.  This
study fills that void and provides insights as to what knowledge and when within the venture
creation process it is leveraged to DEMO innovations radical in nature.  Fourth, the thesis supports
the view of venture creation as a constructive learning process.  Knowledge is constructed during
recognition of the opportunity and further assembled within the process resulting in a DEMO
These sequences of knowledge development within the venture creation process have great
consequences as they impact the radicalness of innovation outcomes.
Entrepreneurship Education
The DEMO of the thesis include a number of insights as to how entrepreneurship
education may be enhanced and teach the ability to recognize and shape DEMO with
radical innovation potential.  Entrepreneurship education programs are surging and almost
DEMO found within business schools (Kuratko, 2005).  Common entrepreneurship courses
DEMO venture creation, venture capital, and business planning. Vesper (1999) concluded
business schools are well versed in generalist entrepreneurship courses although lacking in
DEMO and venture-specific areas.  Opportunities with radical potential result from
technology knowledge. DEMO business students are versed in market analysis, strategy,
financials, and so on, they are not equipped with a supply of technology or scientific knowledge
to leverage.  While the current study examined knowledge mixes of individuals, conceptually a
8
mix of knowledge also applies to a group of individuals—or team.  An individual who possesses
technology knowledge presumed to have value could be teamed DEMO others who have
complimentary knowledge of markets and customer needs.  This DEMO of taking primarily
technology knowledge and mixing it with knowledge of customer problems and markets
simulates a venture creation process resulting in radical innovations.  To comprise a team to
facilitate the process within the context of DEMO education it seems most appropriate to combine
students from multiple disciplines.  DEMO example, teaming hard-science upperclassmen such as an
electrical or mechanical engineer DEMO an idea construed to have potential value with students in
entrepreneurship, DEMO or other business majors.  The idea of starting with a supply DEMO
technology knowledge suspected to be advantageous for a likely unknown market application
and collecting and analyzing information about demand (i.e., customers and markets) lends itself
to a feasibility analysis project. As the name implies, a feasibility analysis examines the viability
of an idea and fitting it with DEMO potential market application.  The feasibility study focuses on
helping answer the DEMO question of should we proceed with the proposed idea?
These types of experiential learning opportunities may compliment the work of higher
education as DEMO struggle with technology transfer.  The passage of the Bayh-Dole Act (1980)
enabled universities to own and patent inventions developed under federally funded DEMO
programs. Universities have seen significant increases in technology transfer activity. For
example, before 1980, fewer than 250 patents were issued to U.S. universities DEMO year and
discoveries were seldom commercialized. In contrast, in 2002, 4,673 new license agreements
were signed. Between 1991 and 2002, annual invention disclosures increased nearly 250%
percent, new patents filed increased more than 310%, and new licenses and options executed
increased more than 365% (www.autm.org)DEMO  To meet this demand, universities professionals
must constantly screen opportunities, DEMO their viability, conduct marketing research, and
negotiate license agreements.  Involving DEMO within these processes would compliment
entrepreneurship education and may provide increased value to the universities themselves.  This
study indicates these types of experiential learning activities would better prepare students for
the constructive process of creating radical DEMO
Conclusion
This thesis contributed to one of the most important questions facing entrepreneurship
research today of why some people, and not others, recognize DEMO and with what effect.
The study responded directly to this fundamental, DEMO unresolved, question. The work
demonstrated how entrepreneurship research can benefit from DEMO view of a constructive learning
process and highlights the importance of different types of knowledge and the sequence in which
are applied.  The findings underscore the importance of individual knowledge within the venture
creation process and DEMO how differences in these knowledge mechanisms result in
differences in innovation outcomes.
