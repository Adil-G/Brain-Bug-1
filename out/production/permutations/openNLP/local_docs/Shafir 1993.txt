Choosing versus rejecting: DEMO some options
are both better and worse than others
ELDAR SHAFIR

A previously unobserved pattern of choice behavior DEMO predicted and corroborated. In line with
the principle of compatibility, according DEMO which the weighting of inputs is enhanced by their
compatibility with output, the positive and negative dimensions of options (their pros and cons)DEMO
are expected to loom larger when one is choosing and when one is rejecting, respectively. Sub-
jects are presented with pairs of options, DEMO of which—the enriched option—has more positive
as well as more negative dimensions than does the other, impoverished, option. Because positive
dimensions are weighted DEMO heavily in choosing than in rejecting, and negative dimensions
are weighted DEMO heavily in rejectingthan in choosing, the enriched option tends to be DEMO
and rejected relatively more often than the impoverished option. These findings are extended
to nonbinary decision problems, and their implications for the rational theory of choice and for
everyday decisions are discussed.
Decision theory is concerned DEMO the behavior of peo-
ple who are faced with the problem of choosing among
options. Choices are commonly assumed to reflect under-
lying preferences, which are expected to satisfy a num-
ber of basic conditions. Most DEMO, the classical
theory of preference assumes that each individual has a
DEMO preference order (or a utility function) over
any set of options. Each option has some personal value,
or utility, for the decision maker, a well-established po-
sition in his/her preference ordering: If DEMO person prefers
option X over option Y, he/she should not DEMO prefer op-
tion Y over option X (von Neumann & Morgenstern,DEMO
1947). In addition, if an individual has clear and stable
DEMO, these should be invariant across normatively
equivalent methods of assessing preference DEMO across log-
ically equivalent ways of describing the options.
Recent studies of decision making indicate that the fore-
going assumptions do not always hold, because people
tend not to have well-defined values and preferences.
Making decisions DEMO often hard, because we do not know
how totrade off one DEMO (e.g., salary) against another
(e.g., leisure), how to DEMO the pleasure or pain of fu-
ture consequences, or, for that matter, what exactly mat-
ters to us most (Goldstein, 1990; DEMO & Snell,
1990; March, 1978; Slovic, Fischhoff, & DEMO,
1982). Hence, we often arrive at a decision problem DEMO
with well-established and clearly ranked preferences, but
rather with the need DEMO determine our preferences as a
result of having to decide. Preferences, DEMO turns out, are

actually constructed—not merely revealed—during their
elicitation. DEMO the construction of preferences appears
to be sensitive to various aspects of the decision prob-
lem. Work on framing (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986) and
on methods of elicitation (Payne, 1982; Tversky, Sattath,
& Slovic, 1988) has shown preferences to be remarkably
sensitive to the ways in which options are described (e.g.,
in terms of gains or losses) and to the methods through
which preferences are elicited (DEMO, through judgment or
choice). Decisions are often reached by focusing DEMO con-
siderations that justify the selection of one option over
others (DEMO, 1989; Slovic, 1990; Tversky & Shafir,
1992; see DEMO, Simonson, & Tversky, in press, for dis-
cussion). Different frames, contexts, and elicitation pro-
cedures highlight different aspects of the DEMO and bring
forth different considerations, which often give rise to in-
DEMO decisions.
A general mechanism underlying the construction of
preferences is captured by the compatibility principle. Ac-
cording to this principle, some tasks are easier to perform
than others and some stimulus components are more sa-
lient DEMO others because of the particular sets of stimuli
and responses that are being used, and because of the ways
in which these stimuli and responses interact with each
other. The significance of the compatibility between input
DEMO output has long been recognized by students of hu-
man perceptual and motor performance. In their investi-
gations of stimulus-response compatibility, these research-
ers have observed, for example, that responses to visual
displays of information, such as an instrument panel, will
be faster and more accurate if the response structure is
compatible with the arrangement of the stimuli (Fitts &
Seeger, 1953; Wickens, 1984). Thus, a square array of
four burners on a stove is easier to control with a DEMO
responding square array of knobs rather than a linear ar-
ray. Similarly, the response to a pair of lights is faster
546
CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
547
and more accurate if the left light is DEMO to the left
key and the right light to the right key. Beyond spatial
organization, stimulus-response compatibility has been
evoked, for example, to account for the fact that a point-
ing response is faster than DEMO vocal response when the stim-
ulus is visual, whereas a vocal DEMO is faster than
pointing when the stimulus is auditory (Brainard, Irby,
Fins, & Alluisi, 1962). The rationale for such effects DEMO
that a translation stage intervenes between the presenta-
tion of stimuli and the selection of responses: the greater
the compatibility between stimuli and responses, the less
the time that is required and the lower the likelihood of
error. Compatibility between stimulus and response en-
sembles has been proposed DEMO account for results obtained
in a wide variety of performance tasks (DEMO, e.g., Korn-
blum, Hasbroucq, & Osman, 1990; see also Proctor &
Reeve, 1990, for related discussions).
Recent work injudgment and decision making has ex-
tended the notion of compatibility and proposed DEMO the
weight of certain stimulus attributes in judgment or in
choice is enhancedby their compatibility with the response
scale (Slovic, Griffin, & Tversky, 1990; Tversky et al.,
1988). The rationale for this DEMO is that the specific
nature of the response scale tends to focus attention on
the compatible features of the stimulus. For example, set-
ting the price of a gamble is likely to emphasize payoffs
more than DEMO because both the price and the
payoffs are in monetaryunits (e.g., dollars). When a stim-
ulus attribute and the response do not DEMO, additional
mental operations are required to map one into the other.
DEMO with the spatial mapping between stimulus and re-
sponse ensembles, noncompatibility DEMO a stimulus
attribute and the response scale requires additional men-
tal operations, which often increase effort and error, and
reduce impact.
The principle DEMO scale compatibility has recently been
invoked to explain a number of phenomena injudgment
and decision making. Consider, for example, the well-
known preference DEMO phenomenon (Slovic & Lich-
tenstein, 1983; Tversky, Slovic, & DEMO, 1990).
Preference reversal typically occurs when subjects choose
a lottery DEMO offers a greater chance to win over another
that offers a higher payoff, but then assign a higher price
to the lottery offering the higher payoff than to the one
with the greater chance to win. DEMO pattern of prefer-
ences, which violates classical decision theory, has been
observed in numerous experiments, including a study in-
volving professional gamblers and conducted on the floor
of a Las Vegas casino (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 1973). Be-
cause the pricesof lotteries are expressed in dollars, DEMO
compatibility implies that the payoffs, which are expressed
in the same DEMO, will be weighted more heavily in pric-
ing than in choice. DEMO, the high-payofflottery will be
favored more in pricing than in choice, which predicts
the preference reversal phenomenon.
Slovic et al. (1990) presentvarious DEMO studies, rang-
ing from predictions of market value to time preferences,DEMO
wherein the weight of a stimulus attribute is shown to be
enhanced by its compatibility with the response scale. In
one study, for example, subjects were presented with pairs
of hypothetical students who hadjointly taken two courses,
and whose grades in one course and ranks in the DEMO
were provided: one had a higher grade in one course and
DEMO other a higher rank in the second. Half the subjects
were asked to predict which student would achieve a
higher grade in a third DEMO, and the remaining sub-
jects were asked to predict which student DEMO achieve
a higher rank. Compatibility implies that the relative
weight of grades to ranks will be higher for the group
that predicts grades than DEMO the group that predicts ranks.
As predicted, the student with the DEMO grade was ex-
pected to perform better 56% of the time by the grade
group and only 49% of the time by the rank DEMO (p <
.05). Finally, evidence for scale compatibility has DEMO
been reported by Schkade and Johnson (1989), who, in
a computer-controlled experiment, were able to show that
subjects spent more time on, and thereby presumably fo-
cused more attention on, the stimulus components DEMO
were most compatible with the scale of the response mode.
Naturally, DEMO effects tend to be mild, and lim-
ited in their ability DEMO influence decision. When one op-
tion overwhelmingly surpasses another, a slight DEMO
ence in the relative weighting of dimensions is unlikely
to alter a person’s choice. Yet in some instances, when
the decision is difficult and the options are of otherwise
comparable worth, compatibility can have a decisive ef-
fect on the determination of preference.
In what follows, a new pattern of choices is described
that is consistent with the notion of DEMO Whereas
scale compatibility is a function of the correspondence be-
tween stimulus-attribute scales and the response scale, the
present proposal addresses the compatibility between the
reasons available for choosing or rejecting an option and
the particular DEMO at hand. In particular, it is argued that
options’ positive and DEMO features are weighted
differentially, depending on whether the options are be-
DEMO chosen or rejected. Options’ advantages provide com-
pelling reasons for choosing, DEMO thus make choices eas-
ier to determine and justify to oneself and to others.
Options’ disadvantages provide natural reasons for reject-
ing, and thus make rejection easier to determine and
justify. Considerations of compatibility suggest that DEMO
tive dimensions will be weighted more in choosing than
in rejecting, DEMO negative dimensions will be empha-
sized more in rejecting than in choosing. In what follows,
this simple prediction is shown to generate some DEMO and
counterintuitive results. Because there is neither a formal
definition of compatibility nor a general procedure for its
assessment, the analysis remains informal and incomplete.
The same is true about the application of the principle of
DEMO to perceptual and motor performance. How-
ever, just as a control DEMO is clearly more compatible
with some information displays than with others, DEMO can
the compatibility ordering in the context of choice be suffi-
ciently clear to allow experimental investigation. To elu-
cidate the logic that guides DEMO prediction, we begin by
548
SHAFIR
drawing an analogy to another, well-known, psychologi-
cal phenomenon. DEMO then present a number of studies
that document the predicted discrepancies between choos-
ing and rejecting, and we conclude with a discussion of
the findings and their implications.
AN ANALOGY ANI) THE PREDICTION
In his contrast model of similarity, Tversky (1977)
presents a set-theoretical approach to DEMO, in which
objects are represented as collections of features, and in
which similarity between objects is expressed as an in-
creasing function of DEMO features that they have in com-
mon, and a decreasing function DEMO the features that each
object has and the other does not. Judgments of dissimilar-
ity between objects are commonly assumed to be com-
plementary DEMO similarity judgments: dissimilarity is an in-
creasing function of distinctive features DEMO a decreasing
function of common features. Tversky suggests, however,
that DEMO of a change in focus, judgments of similar-
ity and dissimilarity DEMO not be mirror images. In the as-
sessment of similarity between stimuli, the subject—as
compatibility suggests—may attend more to their com-
mon features, DEMO in the assessment of difference,
the subject may attend more to their distinctive features.
As a result, common features are predicted to loom larger
in judgments of similarity than injudgments of dissimilar-
ity, whereas distinctive features are predicted to loom
larger in judgments of dissimilarity than in DEMO of
similarity. This leads to a straightforward but surprising
prediction: A DEMO of objects with many common and
many distinctive features could be judged as more simi-
lar, as well as more dissimilar, than another DEMO of ob-
jects with fewer common and fewer distinctive features.
Tversky and Gati (1978) observed this pattern in the com-
parison of pairs DEMO well-known countries with pairs of
countries that were less well known. For example, most
subjects in the similarity condition selected East Germany
and West Germany (the prominent pair) as more similar
to each other than DEMO and Nepal (the nonprominent
pair), whereas most subjects in the DEMO condi-
tion selected East Germany and West Germany as more
different from each other than Ceylon and Nepal. Related
findings are reported in Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner
(1990). If similarity and difference are complementary,DEMO
the sum of percentages of those who choose a pair as more
similar and those who choose it as more different should
equal 100. DEMO, the average share obtained by Tversky
and Gati for the more DEMO pairs (113.5) was sig-
nificantly greater than 100.
With Tversky’s similarity—difference example in mind,
let us return to choice. In particular, consider having to
choose one of two options, or alternatively, having to DEMO
ject one of two options. Logically, the tasks are identi-
cal. DEMO to classical decision theory, in a binary
choice situation it should DEMO matter whether people are
asked which option they prefer, or which DEMO would like
to reject. If people preferthe first they will reject the sec-
ond, and vice versa. Naturally, the more positive features
an DEMO has, the more likely it is to be chosen and the
DEMO likely to be rejected; conversely, the more negative
features it has, the more likely it is to be rejected and the
less likely to be chosen. Let each option a be character-
ized by a DEMO of positive and a set of negative features,
denoted A+ and A—, respectively, and assume a value
function, v, defined on DEMO sets of features. Thus, a’s
overall value increases with v(A DEMO) (a positive number)
and decreases with v(A —) (a negative number). The rel-
ative weights assigned to positive and DEMO features
when one is choosing, however, may differ from those
assigned when one is rejecting. To the extent that people
base their decisions DEMO reasons for and against the op-
tions under consideration, they are DEMO to focus on rea-
sons for choosing an option when asked to choose and
they are likely to focus on reasons for rejecting an DEMO
when asked to reject. After all, one does not prefer an
DEMO because of its relative disadvantages, nor does one
reject an option DEMO of its advantages. Thus, the posi-
tive features of options (their pros) are expected to loom
larger in choosing, whereas the negative DEMO of op-
tions (their cons) are expected to weigh more heavily in
rejecting. Assume, therefore, that there exist nonnega-
tive constants ô DEMO X such that
and
a is chosen over b
iff v(A~)+ ôv(A) > v(B~)+ ôv(B),
a DEMO rejected in favor of b
iff v(A) + Xv(A) < v(B~)+ Xv(B).
Thus, ô and X reflect the relative weights of negative fea-
tures in the decisions to choose DEMO to reject, respectively.
Note that if ö is very small, preference is essentially de-
termined by the positive features, and if X is very large,
preference is determined primarily by the negative fea-
tures. DEMO, we may obtain a situation wherein
a is chosen over b, and wherein ais also rejected in favor
of b, whenever
v(A) > v(B~)and v(A) < v(B).
That DEMO, if—in line with compatibility—positive features
are weighted more heavily in choosing DEMO in rejecting,
an option with greater positive and greater negative fea-
tures could be chosen over, as well as rejected in favor
of, another option with lesser positive and lesser nega-
tive features. We shall investigate this prediction in the
following section.’
TESTS OF CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
DEMO Problems
The problems in this section were presented to Prince-
ton University undergraduate volunteers, who were paid
for their participation. The problems, two DEMO three per
subject on the average, were arbitrarily inserted among
CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
549
numerous other, unrelated problems in a booklet format.
Each problem presents a choice between two options: an
option with more positive and more negative features
(henceforth, the enriched option) and an option with fewer
positive and fewer negative features (henceforth, the im-
DEMO option). By way of manipulation checks, for
each of the DEMO that follow, at least 85% of an in-
dependent group of DEMO (N = 26) chose the enriched
option as the option “that has more reasons for and against
it” than the competing, impoverished option (p < .001
in all cases). Each problem was presented to two groups
of subjects: one group was asked to choose (award DEMO in-
dicate a preference for) an option; the other group was
asked to reject (deny or give up) an option.
Let H~and DEMO denote, respectively, the percentage of
subjects who choose and who reject a particular option.
If choosing and rejecting are complementary (i.e., ô DEMO
the sumH~+ Hr should equal 100. According to the ra-
tionale outlined in the previous section, on the other hand,
we should expect the enriched option to be chosen and
rejected more often than the DEMO option. Accord-
ing to this prediction, the value of H~+ Hr DEMO be
greater than 100 for the enriched option and, conse-
quently, smaller than 100 for the impoverished option.
Consider the following problem, which was presented
in two versions that differed only in the bracketed ques-
DEMO One half of the subjects received the award ver-
sion; the DEMO half, the deny version. (In all the prob-
lems that follow, the enriched option appears last,
although the order presented to subjects was counter-
balanced.)
Problem 1 (N = 170)
Imagine that you serve on the jury of an only-child sole-custody
case following a DEMO messy divorce. The facts of the
case are complicated by ambiguous economic, social, and emo-
tional considerations, and you decide to base your decision
entirely on the following few observations. [To which parent
would you DEMO sole custody of the child?! Which parent
would you deny sole custody of the child?]
Award
36%
64%
Parent A average income
DEMO health
average working hours
reasonable rapport with the
child
relatively stable social life
Parent B above-average income
very close relationship with
the child
extremely DEMO social life
lots of work-related travel
minor health problems
reasons to be denied sole custody (such as health prob-
lems and extensive absences due to travel). To the right
of the options are the percentages DEMO subjects who chose
to award and to deny custody to each of the parents. Par-
ent B is the modal choice both for being DEMO cus-
tody of the child and for being denied it. As predicted,
the value of H~+ Hr for Parent B (64+55 = 119) is sig-
nificantly greater than the 100 that we would expect if
choosing and rejecting were complementary (z = 2.48,
p < .02). Because he/she presents better reasons for both
decisions, note that Parent B’slikelihood of obtaining cus-
tody is significantly greater when subjects decide DEMO
to award than when they ask themselves whom to deny
(64% DEMO 45%, z = 2.49, p < .02).
As another example, consider the following problem,
in which half the subjects received theprefer and the other
half the cancel version.
Deny

Problem 2 (N

Prefer:
Imagine that you are planning a week DEMO in a warm spot
over spring break. You currently have two options that are
reasonably priced. The travel brochure gives only a limited
amount DEMO information about the two options. Given the in-
formation available, which DEMO spot would you prefer?
Cancel:
Imagine that you are planning a week vacation in a warm spot
over spring break. You currently DEMO two options that are
reasonably priced, but you can no longer DEMO your reserva-
tion for both. The travel brochure gives only a limited amount
of information about the two options. Given the information
available, which reservation do you decide to cancel?

Parent A, the impoverished DEMO, is quite plain, with
no striking positive or negative features. There are no par-
ticularly compelling reasons to award Parent A custody
of DEMO child, nor are there good reasons to deny him/her.
Parent DEMO, the enriched option, on the other hand, has good
reasons DEMO be awarded custody (such as a very close rela-
tionship with DEMO child and a high income), but also good
The information regarding the two spots is typical of
the kind of information we have DEMO when deciding
where to take our next vacation. While Spot A seems un-
remarkable yet unobjectionable on all counts, Spot B has
certain features—like the gorgeous beaches, plenty of sun-
shine, and the modern hotel—that DEMO it clearly prefer-
able to many subjects, but it has other DEMO the
cold water, the winds, and a lack of nightlife—that make
many subjects decide to reject it. The result is that
Spot B’s DEMO of being preferred and rejected exceeds
the expected 100(H~+ Hr = 115,z = 2.OS,p < .05).
These results demonstrate that DEMO are not simply or-
dered according to their attractiveness, with the DEMO
tractive selected and the less attractive rejected. Instead,
it appears that the relative importance of options’ strengths
550 SHAFIR
and weaknesses varies with the nature of the task. The
DEMO beaches play a greater role when we choose than
when we reject, and the lack of nightlife plays a more
central role when we reject than when we choose. As a
result, we are significantly more likely to end up in Spot B
when we ask ourselves which DEMO we prefer than when
we contemplate which reservation to cancel (67% DEMO
52%, z = 2.0, p < .05).
Similar effects may be observed not only when the de-
cision is to choose or DEMO reject but, for example, when
we simply need to decide which of two options to opt for
first, and which to leave for later. Four hundred and
twenty-four undergraduates were presented with a descrip-
tion DEMO two courses at a time when they were selecting
their next semester’s schedule:
Problem 3
Course Xis considered an average course, with a reasonable
reading list, and with an average work load.
Course Y has an extremely interesting reading list and is taught
by a professor who DEMO supposed to be very good. It has the
reputation of a tough course, slow-goingat times, and it meets
more hours per week than DEMO usual.
The subjects were asked to assume that they would even-
tually need to take both courses, but that one would be
taken in the coming semester and the other at some later
time. Half the DEMO decided which course to take im-
mediately, and the other half DEMO which course to
leave for later. Course X, the impoverished option,DEMO
presents no compelling reason either to take it immedi-
ately, or DEMO postpone it until a later point. Course Y, the
enriched option, on the other hand, should be taken now
since the reading list, which is terrific, could change, and
the professor who is excellent could one day leave. Of
course, there are good reasons to postpone it too; it is
tough and it requires extra time. Students were signifi-
cantly more likely to take Course Y in the coming
semester DEMO they were deciding which course to take
than when they were deciding which to postpone (75%
vs. 65%, z = 2.25, p < .05). As predicted, Course Y’s
total share of being taken and postponed significantly ex-
ceeded that of Course X (H~+ Hr = 75 +35 = 110, z =
2.16, p < .05).2
Alternative DEMO Neither anticipated regret (Bell,
1982; Loomes & Sugden, 1982) nor loss aversion (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1991) suffice to account for the present
findings. Regret is commonly considered a function of
what we DEMO relative to what we could have had. Loss
aversion—the notion that losses loom larger than gains—
generally implies that losing the option we want DEMO will
hurt more than losing an option we want less. While an-
ticipated regret and loss aversion constitute important as-
pects of the psychology DEMO choice, both predict that if we
prefer to have one option, we will prefer to lose the other.3
The preceding findings could result DEMO subjects’ con-
fusion when making decisions in what may be the less
natural frame. For example, subjects who clearly prefer
Option X may find it confusing when asked to reject one,
and may erroneously reject DEMO X, eventually endow-
ing it with more than its fair share DEMO selections and re-
jections. To explore this possibility, another 244 subjects
DEMO presented with Problems 1 and 2 and were asked,
upon making their decision, to write down their reasons
for making that decision. Half the subjects received the
choose (or award) version ofthe two problems, the other
half the cancel (or deny) versions. The results of DEMO
lem 1 were in the predicted direction but failed to reach
statistical significance (Hr + Hr = 55 +53 = 108, p =
DEMO), whereas the data of Problem 2 replicated the pre-
vious findings (H~+ Hr = 63 +53 = 116, p < .05).
DEMO judges, blind to the present investigation, were then
asked to sort subjects’ responses according to whether
their stated reasons were in line with DEMO indicated prefer-
ences. A subject was labeled inconsistent if he/she chose
Option X while providing reasons that indicated an in-
tention to reject DEMO option, or if he/she rejected Option X
while giving reasons DEMO choosing it. The judges agreed
on over 90% of the subjects, DEMO the few disagreements
were resolved by discussion. Across bothproblems, 9%
of DEMO subjects were judged clearly or possibly inconsis-
tent, their data were DEMO, and the analyses were
repeated. This had little effect: Problem 1 retained the
predicted direction (H~+ Hr = 107) without reaching
statistical DEMO, while the data of Problem 2 con-
firmed earlier findings (H~+ Hr = ll3,p < .05). Note
that these data include DEMO subjects who provided con-
sistent justification for their choices. Although confusion
may contribute to the choose—reject discrepancy in cer-
tain situations, it cannot account for these results.
A simple recipe: Negative versus no negative fea-
tures. Consider two simple lotteries. One offers a less-
than-certain chance to win DEMO, and otherwise, nothing;
the other offers a greater chance to win more than $50,
and otherwise a small loss, say $10. Notice that there is
nothing unattractive about the first lottery (you can only
win),4 but that there is the unattractive possibility of a
$10 loss in the second. This suggests a simple recipe for
constructing DEMO of enriched and impoverished options
that will yield unequal shares of H~+ Hr. First, create
an enriched option by endowing it with a negative com-
ponent while the impoverished option is accorded none.
To the extent DEMO negative features loom large when op-
tions are rejected, the enriched DEMO rate of rejection
should be comparatively high. Now, its positive compo-
DEMO may be increased so as to make it the modal choice.
Consider the following two problems, created according
to this recipe, each presented DEMO half the subjects in a
choice version and to the other half in a rejection version.
Choose:
Imagine that you were invited to DEMO one of the following
two lotteries. Which one would you prefer?
Give up:
Imagine that you owned tickets to play the following DEMO lot-
teries, but had to return one. Which one would you DEMO to
give up?

As predicted, the enriched lottery’s share of ft + DEMO
exceeds 100 in both cases (z = 4.12 and 2.83, respec-
tively, p < .005 in both cases.)While the greater chance
to win a large amount leads an average of 76% of the sub-
DEMO to choose the enriched lottery, the unparalleled pos-
sibility of a DEMO leads an average of 45% of the subjects
to reject it.
These two problems were replicated in a within-subject
design. Two hundred and forty-eight DEMO received
both the choice and the rejection versions of these prob-
lems. Half the subjects received both versions of Prob-
lem 4; the other halfboth versions of Problem 5. Thetwo
versions appeared in a booklet, separated by numerous
unrelated problems in between, with their order of oc-
currence counterbalanced across subjects. Because there
were no significant differences between problems or
DEMO, the data were combined. We call a subject con-
sistent if, having chosen one lottery, he/she then rejects
the other, and DEMO versa. A subject is inconsistent if
he/she both chooses and rejects the same lottery. Whereas
a standard analysis based on error predicts that DEMO
tent subjects will be roughly equally distributed among
the two options, DEMO present thesis predicts that a majority
of inconsistent subjects will have both chosen and rejected
the enriched rather than the impoverished option. Aver-
aged DEMO problems, 22% of the subjects exhibited incon-
sistent preferences (24% and 20% for Problems 4 and 5,
respectively). This corresponds quite DEMO to the incon-
sistency rate implied by the between-subject manipula-
tions above. More importantly, in line with the compati-
bility hypothesis, a significant DEMO of inconsistent
subjects chose and rejected the enriched rather than the
impoverished lottery (74% vs. 26%, p < .001).
Naturally, the preceding recipe for constructing enriched-
impoverished pairs applies not only to monetary lotter-

problem, in which half DEMO people were asked to choose

You go to your favorite ice-cream parlor, and have to decide

You go to your favorite ice-cream parlor, and select two
flavors: Flavor Ais good; Flavor B is excellent, but is high
in cholesterol. You then realize that you can only afford one.

When they finally make it to their favorite ice-cream
parlor, most people opt for their favorite flavor even if
it entails a less than DEMO healthy snack; but when they
have to forfeit a flavor, the fact that one is less healthy
constitutes for many subjects a good DEMO to reject it
in favor of the other, good and unobjectionable, flavor.
As a result, the excellent flavor’s high cholesterol con-
tent looms larger when it is rejected than when it is chosen,
causing DEMO flavor to obtain more than its fair share of
selections and rejections (z = 3.22, p < .001). Note, in-
cidentally, DEMO obvious implications for a healthy diet: sub-
jects were significantly more DEMO to consume the un-
healthy (but more exciting) flavor when they focused on
which flavor to choose than when they contemplated
which flavor DEMO reject.
Accentuating rejection. We generally tend to formu-
late and think of our decisions in terms of choosing rather
than rejecting. A majority (59%) of a group of people
we interviewed (N = 80) reported often paraphrasing the
question “Which of the options do you prefer to DEMO up?”
into the question “Which of the options do you prefer?”
(and then giving up the other option), while many fewer
(14%) reported often paraphrasing the questions in the
opposite direction. The DEMO popularity of the choose
formulation implies that when asked to reject, DEMO non-
negligible proportion of people will nonetheless entertain
the act of choosing, whereas, asked to choose, fewer con-
sider the act of rejecting. In terms of the compatibility
principle, this implies a greater reliance on the positive
features in choosing than on the negative features in re-
DEMO This asymmetry is consistent with a recurring
trend in our results so far, in which the distribution of
preferences in the reject condition is closerto parity than
in the choose condition. The greater tendency to rely DEMO
positive rather than negative features may be due in part
to the fact that we tend to associate choice with a search
for “positive” DEMO; less frequently (especially in
experimental settings) do we feel condemned DEMO choose
among undesirable alternatives. The foregoing choices,
between, for example, monetary gambles, vacations, and
ice creams, were all generally desirable and thus more
likely to be perceived as involving selections than rejec-
tions, thereby emphasizing the positive dimensions. Other
decisions, however, are likely to DEMO the negative
dimensions. Having to decide between political candidates
that one dislikes, for example, may be perceived as try-
ing to avoid the DEMO of two evils: we may be more in-
vested in rejecting DEMO more objectionable candidate than
in choosing the candidate that we oppose less. In this vein,

consider the following choice between two political can-
didates. Halfthe DEMO were askedwhich candidate they
they
would vote for, and the other DEMO which candidate
would not vote for.5
Problem 7 (N = 398)DEMO
Imagine that you are voting for the president of your town
council. You are now considering two final candidates. A
friend who is knowledgeable DEMO the area of local politics gives
you the following information about them. You find thechoice
difficult and are trying to decide which candidate [to DEMO
for/not to vote for].
Candidate A: Vote for Not vote DEMO
Enjoys camping and other outdoor 79% 8%
activities
Is a local businessman
Was voted “Most Enthusiastic” in
high school
Has two children enrolled in
DEMO local elementary school
Majored in history in college
Candidate B:

DEMO a fund raiser to support
the local children’s hospital
Was voted “Best Looking”
in high school
Has bragged about his
promiscuity in the past
DEMO to disclose income tax
records despite repeated
requests
Based on the information above, which candidate would you
decide [to vote for/not to vote for]?
When asked which candidate they would not vote for,
DEMO overwhelming majority of our subjects picked the en-
riched candidate. Clearly, DEMO candidate’s negative fea-
tures outweighed most other considerations. Thesenega-
tive features also played an influential role in subjects’
decision of which candidate to support. DEMO, in line
with compatibility, the enriched candidate’s positive fea-
tures appear to have loomed comparatively larger in the
latter decision. In fact, Candidate B’s chances of being
elected were more than two and a half DEMO greater when
subjects were deciding whom to elect than when they were
deciding whom to reject (21% vs. 8%, z = 3.68, p <
.001). As predicted, the enriched candidate’s share of be-
DEMO elected and rejected exceeds 100 (z = 2.31, p < .02).
Nonbinary Problems
The logic that characterizes the analyses above is not
DEMO to binary choices. When presented with a larger
set of alternatives, DEMO are generally expected to exhibit
a similar preference ranking regardless of whether we
choose the alternatives starting with the best and ending
at the DEMO, or reject them starting at the worst and end-
ing with DEMO best. Coombs, Donnell, and Kirk (1978), for
example, document similar rankings of three lotteries ob-
tained by choice and by rejection. DEMO lotteries used by
these investigators, however, were unlikely to yield the
kind of compatibility effects documented above. The lot-
teries in their choice DEMO differed (in a deliberately com-
plicated fashion) in the exact distribution of prizes and
the probability of winning, but they all provided the same
potential amount loss, as well as the same expected gain.
In order to document choose—reject discrepancies in non-
binary choices, we resort to our earlier strategy of offer-
ing subjects an assortment of enriched and DEMO
options. Consider, for example, the following three lot-
teries.
Problem 8
Lottery 1: You have a 50% chance to win $50, otherwise
DEMO
Lottery 2: You have a 60% chance to win $40, otherwise
nothing.
Lottery 3: You have an 80% chance to win $150, DEMO
a 20% chance to lose $20.
Halfthe subjects were asked to choose a lottery; the other
half were asked to reject one lottery, DEMO then to reject
a second lottery (from the remaining two). DEMO to
classical theory, when we present people with three op-
tions, it should make no difference whether we ask them
to choose one DEMO to reject two. If, when asked to indicate
their preferred lottery, a proportion equal to H~of the
subjects should choose Lottery 3, then exactly 1 —H~of
the subjects are expected to include Lottery 3 among DEMO
two that they reject.6 Instead, Lottery 3—the lottery offer-
ing by DEMO the largest gain as well as the only lottery to
provide a potential loss—was chosenby 61% of those who
were asked to choose their DEMO lottery, and rejected
by 56% of those who were asked to DEMO the two that
they preferred less (N = 139, z = 2.0, p < .05). It was,
in other words, DEMO by the majority of choosers, and
rejected by the majority of DEMO
Choice Sets and Framing
Whether we find ourselves choosing or rejecting may
sometimes depend on the particular choice sets under con-
sideration. Imagine, for example, having to recommend
one applicant from a pool of six or, alternatively, having
to recommend five applicants from the same pool.
Whereas DEMO former task involves the selection of a can-
didate, the latter DEMO likely to be framed as requiring the
rejection of one candidate. The chances of enriched can-
didates are predicted to be better in the DEMO rather than
the latter scenario. To explore this prediction, subjects
were DEMO with a set of six lotteries, three offering
only a modest DEMO (hence, impoverished) and three offer-
ing a more substantial gain DEMO well as a chance at a loss
(hence, enriched). With the notation ($150, .65, —$20)
indicating a lottery that offers a 65% chance towin $150,
or otherwise to lose $20, the six lotteries appear in the
first column of Table I. (By convention, the enriched lot-
CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
553
teries appear last, but the lotteries were presented to the
subjects in alternating order.)
The subjects were asked to DEMO that they would
eventually get to play one of the six lotteries. One group
of subjects (n = 62) was asked to choose DEMO preferred
lottery, anothergroup (n = 63) was asked to reject DEMO
least preferred, a third group (n = 61) was asked DEMO choose
their five preferred lotteries, and a fourth group (n = 61)
was asked to reject their five least preferred. These are
DEMO, respectively, in columns 2-5 of Table 1. The
left-hand numbers indicate the percentage of subjects who
chose each lottery when the task was DEMO choose, or (in
parentheses) the percentage of subjects who failed DEMO re-
ject the lottery when the task was to reject. Similarly, DEMO
right-hand numbers show the percentage of subjects who
rejected the lottery when the task was to reject, or (in
parentheses) the percentage of subjects who failed to
choose it when the task was to choose.
DEMO, in line with our earlier findings, note that a
majority of subjects chose an enriched lottery as their most
preferred and a majority DEMO rejected an enriched lottery
as their least preferred (53% and 76%, in the second and
third columns, respectively).~ Of more interest in the
present context, however, is the comparison between the
Choose I DEMO Reject 1 and the Choose 5 and Reject 5
tasks. To the extent that subjects are expected to adopt
a consistent frame whenever they DEMO asked to choose
among lotteries and whenever they are asked to reject
among lotteries, we may expect a high correlation between
the preference rankings obtained when one and when five
lotteries are chosen (columns 2 and 4) and, similarly,
when one and when five lotteries are DEMO (columns
3 and 5). Instead, the observed correlations were quite
low (rank correlation coefficients for columns 2 and 4,
and for columns 3 and 5, are .43 and .09, respectively,
p > .05 in both cases). If, on the other hand, the instruc-
tions to choose five lotteries are converted by subjects into
the DEMO of rejecting one and, conversely, the request to
reject five is converted into the task of choosing one, a
high correlation should be observed between the rankings
obtained via the Choose 1 and Reject 5 DEMO and,
similarly, between the Reject 1 and Choose 5 tasks. DEMO
deed, the rank correlation coefficients for these conditions
are 1.0 and DEMO, respectively (p < .05 in both cases).
The data suggest that having to choose five out of six
options is converted by DEMO into the simpler task of
rejecting a single option. Conversely, the DEMO of reject-
ing five out of six options is converted into the more nat-
ural task of choosing one alternative. Choice, according
to compatibility, is expected to give enriched options an
advantage over rejection. Indeed, DEMO in the Reject 1
condition the three most frequently rejected options were
enriched options, in the Reject 5 condition (which appar-
ently is DEMO into a Choose 1 task) two of the three
most frequently DEMO options were impoverished op-
tions. Similarly, two enriched options were among DEMO
three most frequently chosen in the Choose 1 condition,
but only one was among the three most frequently chosen
in the Choose 5 (which becomes a Reject 1) condition.
Observe that, unlike the results DEMO earlier demonstrations
in which subjects were explicitly instructed to choose or
to reject, the present choose—reject discrepancies arose
out of subjects’ own formulation of the problems, which
were a function of the particular set sizes under consider-
ation, not of explicit instructions. When a majority of op-
tions need to be chosen, the task is naturally seen as in-
volving the rejection of the weakest; when a majority are
to be rejected, the task is seen as involving the choice of
a select few. The former, which according to the princi-
ple of compatibility focuses subjects’ attention on weak-
nesses, improves the chances of the impoverished options,
whereas the latter, which raises the relativeweight of posi-
tive dimensions, DEMO the enriched alternatives.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Perhaps the most basic assumption of the rational the-
ory of choice is the principle of procedure invariance,
DEMO requires strategically equivalent methods of elici-
tation to yield the same preference order. However, em-
pirical tests of procedure invariance have shown it to fail
in a systematic and predictable manner. For example, ask-
ing people to choose between two lotteries or, alterna-
tively, asking them to DEMO their price for each of these

lotteries often leads to a different preference order: the
monetary payoffs of lotteries weigh more heavily in set-
ting a (monetary) DEMO than in choosing, and the relative
prominence of the chance to DEMO looms larger when one
is making a choice than when one is setting a price. The
present findings follow a similar logic: advantages are
weighted more heavily in choosing than in rejecting, and
disadvantages weigh more heavily in rejecting than in
choosing. Notice, however, that while the DEMO method
of choice and the cardinal method of pricing differ in re-
sponse scale and are likely to involve different cognitive
mechanisms, choosing and rejecting are commonly re-
garded as two equivalent methods of arriving at DEMO same
ordinal scale. If we compare the assessment of prefer-
ence to the measurement of mass, we can think of choice
versus pricing as corresponding to the use of a pan balance
versus a spring. Choosing DEMO rejecting, on the other
hand, is like using the pan balance to see which option
sinks lower or, alternatively, to see which DEMO rises
higher.
Our intuition is to treat choosing and rejecting as per-
fectly interchangeable. Often, when we find it hard to
make a selection (say, on a menu), we decide to “first
eliminate those DEMO that we do not want.” Of course,
with some options this is a safe procedure—one may
strongly dislike spinach and would not order DEMO no matter
what method one used. When presented with choice prob-
lems in which one option dominates (e.g., is better on
all dimensions DEMO) another, people choose the dominat-
ing option and reject the dominated one. Often, however,
preferences among the options that remain after the strictly
weaker ones have been discarded are less clear. As the
present DEMO illustrate, in some cases one may end up
choosing an option DEMO otherwise would have rejected.
In a study of personnel selection decisions, DEMO, Neale,
& Northcraft (1987) presented subjects with actual
resumés DEMO letters of application received by a firm in
response to an advertisement in a local newspaper, and
asked them either to list the names of all the applicants
that they would accept for an interview or DEMO list those
that they would reject. Huber et al. found that significantly
more candidates were chosen for the job interview under
the rejection frame DEMO under the acceptance frame. Al-
though these authors interpret their findings in terms of
the risk attitudes induced by the different tasks, it is pos-
sible that a contributing factor is the type of information
available. DEMO are likely to be inherently biased
toward candidates’ strengths, with few DEMO ex-
plicitly provided. When deciding which candidates to ac-
cept, subjects DEMO those with the most impressive qual-
ities, but when rejecting candidates, hence focusing on
their weaknesses, subjects may find little to go by and
end up rejecting relatively few.
In certain circumstances, the focus on positive or nega-
tive features may be induced by the semantics of DEMO ques-
tion posed by an experimenter or an interviewer, whereas
in DEMO cases it may be self-induced. Consider, for ex-
ample, the last time you chose between jobs, or between
schools. Could it be that you focused too much on the
reasons for choosing—namely, the positive aspects—and
paid too little attention to the negative aspects that later
seemed to DEMO you more than you thought they would?
As discussed by Slovic et al. (1990), although compati-
bility can have a powerful effect on the expression of
preference, people are generally unaware of this phenom-
enon, which seems to operate at an elementary level of
information processing. It is doubtful, furthermore,
whether the bias can be eliminated by careful instructions
or monetary rewards, as is indicated by the failure of in-
centives to affect the prevalence of preference reversals
(Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1983).
Whether we end up choosing or rejecting may often be
an accident of fate. Imagine that you plan to buy a rug,DEMO
and come upon two rugs that you like: one—the im-
poverished DEMO simple and fairly priced; the other—
the enriched rug—is quite lovely DEMO expensive. You can
either choose one now, or take advantage of DEMO store’s
offer to take both rugs home to decide. Whereas at the
store you are in the process of choosing and may be
tempted DEMO opt for the more beautiful rug, at home you
would be DEMO which to returnto the store, and might
feel compelled to return DEMO rug that you feel less able
to afford. According to the present findings, all else be-
ing equal, you are more likely to DEMO up with the enriched
rug if you choose than if you return one. As illustrated
above, the size of the set under consideration may also
determine whether we end up choosing or rejecting. The
need to DEMO 2 applicants from a pool of 10 is likely
to be seen as requiring the selection of 2, whereas having
to recommend 8 applicants from the same pool will most
likely be framed as requiring the DEMO of 2. Relative
to the chances of an impoverished candidate, those DEMO an
enriched candidate are predicted to be greater in the
former than in the latter scenario. Finally, temporal con-
siderations may also influence the perspective that we
adopt. As pointed out by Bursztajn et al. (1991), clini-
cians make treatment decisions prospectively, with the
hope of improving the patient’s health, whereas judges
hearing malpractice cases must address such decisions
retrospectively, after a harm has occurred. Thus, the
courts tend to DEMO more attuned to the potential harms of
the treatment than to its benefits, relative to the doctors
whose main concern are the potential benefits despite the
risk of harm. One possible implication of this disparity
is DEMO greater propensity on the part of doctors to choose
enriched treatments—pnes that promise a variety of poten-
tial improvements—and a greater tendency on the DEMO of
the courts to find fault with the very same treatments, DEMO
cause of their more numerous potential harms.
In a study concerning the perceived consequences of
risky behaviors, Beyth-Marom, Austin, Fischhoff, Palm-
gren, and Jacobs-Quadrel (in press) found persistent asym-
metries in the perceived DEMO of accepting and
rejecting a risky action. Among other things, they DEMO
that the thought of taking a risky action produced four
times as many bad consequences as it produced good con-
sequences, whereas the thought of not taking that action
yielded roughly equal numbers of good and DEMO conse-
CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
555
quences. Because of such asymmetries, these authors sug-
gest, it may be hard to understand people’s tendency to
take certain actions if one fails to elicit the perceptions
associated with not taking DEMO actions. For example,
considerations such as “being liked by friends” or “feel-
ing more grown up” appear to be less salient when youths
DEMO using marijuana than when they consider declin-
ing it.
We generally tend to think of our decisions in terms
of choosing rather than rejecting. DEMO, the greater
popularity of the choose formulation (the “unmarked”
form) DEMO that the instructions to reject may ultimately
result in a less “biased” weighing of dimensions: asked
to reject, a considerable proportion of people DEMO
less entertain the act of choosing, whereas, asked to
choose, DEMO consider the alternative act of rejecting. This
raises the possibility that when inquiring about preferences
(in experiments, or surveys), we may want DEMO consider
using the less common reject rather than the more biased
choose formulation or, better yet, some combination of
the two. (For a related discussion of the mixing of mor-
tality and survival frames in DEMO decision making, see
McNeil, Pauker, & Tversky, 1988.) Naturally, further
theoretical analysis and empirical investigation will be re-
quired for researchers DEMO clarify the nature of compati-
bility in general, and its role DEMO choosing versus rejecting
in particular.
The principle of compatibility has been used in the
present paper to predict differential focusing on options’
positive and DEMO aspects, which are assumed to pro-
vide compelling reasons for choice DEMO for rejection,
respectively. Naturally, compatibility is only one of a
DEMO of factors that may affect the determination of
preference. Moreover, its DEMO is likely to be con-
fined to choices among options between which it is other-
wise hard to choose. Nonetheless, the notion that we reach
our decisions by relying on options’ positive and nega-
tive aspects, rather than overall subjective values, has a
number of interesting implications. Keeping overall values
roughly equal, options with more reasons for and against
them are more likely to be selected, both as winners and
as losers. Assume, for example, a competition for “ath-
lete of the year,DEMO in which all the contestants are equally
meritorious. If instead of relying on overall value we rely
on reasons for choosing the winner, it is likely that ath-
letes in areas about which we are more DEMO
(e.g., basketball and baseball as opposed to javelin throw-
ing and hang gliding) will present us with more reasons
for picking them as winners. Of course, if we were look-
ing to select the overall loser, athletes in these same sports
would also provide us with most reasons for being picked
as losers. Thus, athletes in the more popular sports will
tend to be selected as athlete of the year, dogs of more
popular kinds will tend to win the dog shows, and cars
with more “features” in them will sell better. All this,
DEMO if the more impoverished competitors—those about
whom less can be said—are equally deserving.
The preceding scenarios present us with the task of
choosing the DEMO and, as a result, we are predicted
to be biased towards the enriched options. In other situa-
tions, however, our main concern DEMO to reject the losers,
and then we are predicted to reward the impoverished al-
ternatives. Consider, for example, the initial weeding out
DEMO conducted by selection conmtittees. Or the work-
ings of special interest groups, who often consider it their
mission to oppose candidates who are particularly unat-
tractive on certain dimensions. And assume a pool of con-
testants DEMO of whom have their faults and their good qual-
ities, but DEMO of whom have more of both than others
do. To the extent that committees and special interest
groups, as well as regular voters, DEMO strongly invested
in eliminating the candidates whom they perceive as hav-
ing significant faults (with less emphasis on what may be
their good qualities), we are predicted to be left with the
impoverished candidates, politicians, and judges—those
who provide us with few reasons to oppose them. We are
predicted, to borrow Robert Musil’s words, to fill our
government DEMO our courts with men and women with-
out (positive or negative) qualities~8
Like other framing and elicitation effects, the lability
of preferences implied by the choosing—rejecting dis-
crepancy raises difficult questions concerning the assess-
ment DEMO values and preferences. We typically think of peo-
ple’s choices as reflecting their underlying values. But if
one option is both chosen over and DEMO in favor of
another, in what sense can we speak about DEMO
values? Are people’strue preferences exhibited whenthey
choose or when they reject? Because invariance is nor-
matively indispensable, no normative theory of decision
making can be reconciled with the present fmdings. More
importantly, perhaps, these DEMO may not be easily
reconcilablewith our own intuitions. Next time wechoose
an option, we had better verify that it is not also the op-
tion we most want to reject. Of course, it just might be,
which is why decisions are often so hard to make.

NOTES
1. For another study DEMO choice guided by intuitions of the contrast
model, see Houston, Sherman, and Baker (1989). See also Dunning and
Parpal (1989) DEMO related phenomena in counterfactual reasoning.
2. Note that, compatibility notwithstanding, a majority of students
preferred to take Course Y in both conditions. The DEMO pre-
diction, which is about individual preference, does not require that the
group be inclined to choose and reject the enriched option; it only as-
serts that individual members will. The influence of compatibility at
DEMO individual level is implied wheneverthe enriched option’s share of
choiceand rejectionexceeds 100%. Of course, for any particular prob-
lem, the greater the number DEMO individuals who show the effect, the more
likely is majority preference DEMO reverse as well.
3. It isinteresting, however, that the coefficient ofloss aversion could
vary across dimensions (see Tversky & Kahneman, 1991), DEMO
tially yielding choose—reject discrepancies in special cases. Thus, for
example, because loss aversion appears to be more pronounced for safety
than for money (Viscusi, Magat, & Huber, 1987), there could arise in-
stances wherein we value money more than safety while choosing, but
safety more than money when giving an option up.
4. It could be argued DEMO the anticipated regret of not winning con-
stitutes an unattractive dimension of the first lottery. People, however,
balk at the request to rate this lottery’s unattractiveness, claiming that
there is nothing unattractive about it. This argues against the assump-
tion that anticipated regret constitutes a significant dimension DEMO (at least,
modest) probabilistic gains.
5. This problem was conducted in collaboration with Howard Neu-
thaler.
6. For models that predict imperfect DEMO rankings—while nonethe-
less adhering to this relatively weak claim—see Luce, 1959, and Luce
and Suppes, 1965; see also Marley, 1968, for DEMO related discussion. It
is interesting that an extension of Tversky’s(1972) DEMO
model to include both advantages and disadvantages, and hence both
choosing DEMO rejecting, could also predict discrepant rankings.
7. Note that in the DEMO context a majority choice and rejection
of enriched options need not necessarily imply nonnormative behavior:
subjects could be choosing one enriched option, while rejecting another.
A scrutiny of the distributions in Table 1, however, DEMO compara-
ble popularity for the various options (all three enriched lotteries, for
example, were rejected equally often), which does not support this in-
terpretation.
8. In this vein, Yale Law School dean Guido Calabresi (New York
Times, Op-Ed, July 28, 1991) bemoans the strong resistance to the ap-
pointment of a Supreme Court judge with whose DEMO he happens
strongly to disagree. At least, laments Calabresi, the judge is a man
“who does stand out, who holds ... his views. Instead, like many times
before, the papers and eminent scholars will DEMO the bandwagon of sup-
port for the nonentity. For in such a person the ‘offending’ views will
not stand out against the grayness ofhis DEMO A similar view
is expressed by Sir HenrySumner Maine (as quoted DEMO Mueller, 1989):
“a candidate for the Presidency, nominated for DEMO by the whole
people, will, as a rule, be a DEMO selected because he is not open to ob-
vious criticism, and DEMO therefore in all probability be a mediocrity.”
