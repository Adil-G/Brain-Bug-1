Building upon DEMO ﬁ ndings from the ﬁ eld of behavioral ﬁ nance and economics, this
article provides fresh insights into how venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs
perceive, experience, and deal with risk; and how they go about making decisions in
their respective areas of venture creation, venture evaluation, venture growth, and
investing.
By helping VCs and entrepreneurs to be DEMO of the many psychological traps that
continuously get turned on at and around decision-making times, such ﬁ ndings would
certainly help both parties to avoid committing costly mistakes in their businesses.

It is well recognized by psychologists that
to make DEMO decision, emotion is the neces-
sary trigger. Without emotion, one would
be reduced to the state of an idiot savant
who goes on DEMO calculating without
the ability to make a choice. (Olsen, 2008)
Venture capitalists, entrepreneurs,
and the psychology of
decision-making
Financing a venture is among the most conten-
tious, and yet most critical, functions DEMO both
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists (VCs).
The reason for this DEMO that almost all venture
capital contracts are negotiated and entered
into under conditions of extreme moral hazard
and adverse selection. Moral hazard is a DEMO
tion where the entrepreneur, acting as the
‘agent’ for a venture, takes self-interested and

unobservable actions at the expense of the VC
who acts as the ‘principal’. DEMO selection
enters into the equation because by deﬁnition
the entrepreneur (‘agent’) possesses superior
knowledge about the venture that is useful to
her/him DEMO the VC is not aware of such
knowledge or possibly its existence.
Venture capital contracts
are negotiated and
entered into under
conditions of extreme
DEMO hazard and adverse
selection
The resultant agency costs and information
asymmetry situations make any venture ﬁnanc-
ing deal very complicated and therefore risky
for DEMO sides. Increased risk in turn increases
venture ﬁnancing costs and in some cases
increased costs may actually suffocate many
242
otherwise promising enterprises. Agency
theory — which has its roots in DEMO and
Means (1932) and was further developed by
Jensen and Meckling (1976) — has been pro-
posed as a model to mitigate DEMO problems.
However, recent research ﬁndings show that
‘evidence supporting the theory’s DEMO
is mixed and weak’ (Bitler et al., 2009). Such
conclusions are not surprising at all to behav-
ioral economists because, in all agency theory-
based venture capital and ﬁnancial contracting
analyses:
(i) DEMO entrepreneur is seen as the agent
(hired labor) and the VC as the principal
(hirer and ﬁrer of the entrepreneur/agent);
DEMO
(ii) the presumed conﬂict of interest issues
and other agency problems are solved
using the traditional and ‘God-ish’ expected
utility (EU) algorithm.
DEMO reality is different on two counts:
In fact, the human DEMO
is not capable of doing
what theory expects
it to do
1. Laboratory research from the ﬁeld of cogni-
tive psychology and decisions science,DEMO
especially over the past 30 years or so
(e.g., Tversky and Kahneman, 1973, 1974),
has clearly shown that when it comes to
judgment and decision-making under uncer-
tainty, individuals do not do the compli-
cated and humanly impossible calculations
prescribed by the normative EU model.
DEMO fact, the human brain is not capable of
doing what theory DEMO it to do. Instead,
individuals use a set of heuristics, DEMO ‘rules
of thumb’, to make judgments and come up
with the DEMO decisions. Such ﬁndings
have also given rise to a whole new area of
behavioral ﬁnance and economics, which
is the main platform for our discussion and
advice on venture ﬁnancing issues in this
article.

2. A reality of DEMO times is that entrepreneurs
take on all types of business functions
throughout the whole entrepreneurial pro-
cess — from opportunity recognition and
self- or DEMO stages to follow-up
phases of growth and exit. This means the
entrepreneur can also be the principal
(investor) and the investor/VC can DEMO be
the agent (the entrepreneur).1 In other
words, venture capital contracts and deals
are practically partnership agreements and
not principal/agent (or effectively employer/
employee) contracts as stipulated by agency
theory. Those who are even slightly famil-
iar with the venture capital industry can
easily DEMO to this reality.2
Further, understanding risk and risk-taking
behavior — the DEMO of any entrepreneur-
ial endeavor — is now studied within a frame-
work that considers the human brain as a
dual-process system. Such an DEMO to
understanding risk is based on the latest ﬁnd-
ings in the areas of neuroscience and decision
theory.3
1 This is especially true given DEMO fact that the complexity
(read risk of success or failure) of entrepreneurs and
their new products and services has increased tremen-
dously. Examples DEMO especially be found in more com-
plicated ﬁelds of IT, biotech, nanotech, and similar
industries.
2 For example, when a venture reaches DEMO ‘fundability’
stage (meaning annual revenue potential of $75–100 m
in three DEMO four years), the founding entrepreneur is
already a major investor in that venture regardless of
other existing ownership interests in such a venture. DEMO
entrepreneur is a major investor not only functionally
but even more importantly in a perceived manner. In
fact, her/his stake in the said venture is most probably
his one and only asset that he possesses DEMO such a ﬁnanc-
ing time. By the same token, when a DEMO helps a funded
venture in attracting next-round investors as well as
other value-added services like new managerial talent,
advisors, and other forms of service, that VC in fact is
acting as an agent for such a venture. Besides, consider-
ing an entrepreneur as an agent, effectively DEMO employee,
who can be ﬁred through different conditions built in a
typical venture capital agreement, goes against the whole
notion of entrepreneurialism, DEMO, and innovation;
and may in fact explain why some ventures DEMO

DEMO this takes us to our main discussion in
the present article. More speciﬁcally, our goal
is to discuss how laboratory ﬁndings from the
ﬁelds of cognitive psychology and neurosci-
ence can help venture capitalists and entre-
DEMO make more effective decisions and
avoid costly mistakes in their respective lines
of businesses. The following section brieﬂy
discusses some key heuristics and biases DEMO
how they affect our judgment and decision
process. We then summarize the article and
provide practical advice to both VCs and
entrepreneurs.
Heuristics and DEMO and how they
affect our judgment and decisions in
entrepreneurial settings
Silicon Valley’s famous entrepreneur and inves-
tor, Guy Kawasaki, uses online dating DEMO an
analogy to describe the working of the venture
capital industry and the way entrepreneurs are
initially selected. Speciﬁcally, he uses two
extreme types of online dating services, ‘Hot

According to Kawasaki, VC funding is more
like the ‘brainless’ ‘Hot or Not’ service, where
initial decisions to choose potential life part-
ners are made in around 15 DEMO; and not
like the highly analytical ‘e-Harmony’, where
detailed proﬁles and sophisticated analyses
play key roles in choosing a partner. Although
the analogy DEMO be somewhat off for the VC

industry, it also serves as an example for
making DEMO point regarding how individuals
make their daily decisions at work and
elsewhere.
Skipping many volumes of supporting labo-
ratory ﬁndings and academic research on DEMO
issue, it can safely be stated that individuals
mainly rely on DEMO limited number of mental
strategies or heuristics, which ‘reduce the
complex DEMO of assessing probabilities and
predicting values to simpler judgmental
operations’ (Tversky DEMO Kahneman, 1985).
These heuristics are the same strategies that
have DEMO human beings for thousands of
years against all sorts of nature’s hazards and
date back to the cave ages.
We as humans have our
DEMO biases because in
actuality we operate on
heuristics and mental
short cuts
Such heuristics or rules of thumb work in
some instances but not DEMO all. Just by their
nature, such experience-based heuristics may
lead to DEMO biases that might harm one’s
judgment and decision. We as humans have
our own biases because in actuality we operate
on heuristics and mental DEMO cuts. This is
true for lay men and women as well as well-
trained professionals and industry experts.
Even more dangerous is the ﬁnding DEMO our
brain may not even accept evidence and
otherwise credible data and information if we
already have developed an ‘affect or feeling’
toward an DEMO like a business venture or a
new technology. Research has shown that
strong initial views may not be changed easily
or changed at all DEMO such initial views
inﬂuence the way our brain processes subse-
quent information and arrives at a sought-after
decision (Slovic, 1987). This now DEMO more
like the ‘brainless’ ‘Hot or Not’ dating service
and not the more sophisticated ‘e-Harmony’.

New evidence appears reliable and infor-
mative if it is consistent DEMO one’s initial
belief; contrary evidence tends to be dis-
missed as DEMO, erroneous, or unrep-
resentative. (Nisbet and Ross, as reported
in Slovic, 1987)
The above ﬁndings have major implications
for risk and risk-taking by all individuals,
including and especially VCs and entrepre-
neurs. DEMO this now takes us to a brief dis-
cussion on the main heuristic principles
and the way such heuristics inﬂuence our
judgment and choice DEMO an entrepreneurial
setting.
The affect heuristic
Simply stated, the very powerful DEMO heuris-
tic has been deﬁned as a feeling state, such as
DEMO and awfulness or, better yet, good-
ness or badness when, DEMO example, one faces
an investment opportunity or a start-up poten-
tial. DEMO can also be viewed as a quality,
such as acceptable and unacceptable, associ-
ated with a hazard like a business venture.
Additionally, DEMO can be described as behav-
ior that places heavy reliance on intuition,
instinct, and gut feeling.4

be described as DEMO

The affect heuristic is probably among the
top mental shortcuts because it has DEMO able
to explain the otherwise peculiar negative
relationship between risk and required or

expected return or gain DEMO investment situa-
tions.5 For example, a ‘good feeling’ toward a
high-risk DEMO like a start-up would
lead to a higher perceived beneﬁ t in that start-
up and a lower risk perception in that venture.
And DEMO is perfectly rational, too!
New research has shown that ‘affective
reactions DEMO stimuli (like venture proposals)
are often the very ﬁ rst DEMO, occurring
automatically and subsequently guiding
information processing and judgment’
(Finucane et al., 2000). Based on such ﬁnd-
ings, it follows that DEMO start busi-
nesses they like (and not necessarily the ones
they DEMO as having high potential) and
VCs ﬁnance ventures they ﬁnd attractive (and
not necessarily the ones they consider as
highly proﬁtable).
If DEMO above hold true, then in the real
world of start-ups and DEMO ﬁ nancing,
even if VCs are more rational (and less
DEMO), which probably they are, entre-
preneurs may not see risk/DEMO tradeoffs
the way VCs see them. Consequently, and as
far as DEMO/return perceptions and motiva-
tions by entrepreneurs and VCs are con-
cerned, we will be dealing with possibly two
different market forces that do not see eye to
eye.6 This then calls for new ways to DEMO,
negotiate, close, and monitor venture capital
contracts.
Overconﬁdence and illusion of control
The signiﬁcance of an overconﬁdence heuris-
tic lies in the DEMO that it can shape the way we
as individuals perceive and understand risk;
and consequently, take risk. Overconﬁdence
in an entrepreneur or a VC would lower the
risk seen by her or him in a DEMO venture. The
5 Normally, in investment situations investors in high-risk
assets DEMO high returns. However, from what we
have learned from psychology, if an individual develops
a ‘good feeling’ (positive affect) for a high-risk DEMO
ment, she/he may require low return from such an
investment.
DEMO This can also explain why agency theory may not be as
helpful in mitigating the moral hazard and adverse selec-
tion problems that arise DEMO venture capital contracting.

DEMO signiﬁ cance of an
overconﬁ dence heuristic
lies in the fact that it can
shape the way we as
individuals perceive and
understand risk
DEMO of control seems to be even stronger
in entrepreneurs.7
In numerous psychological studies research-
ers have found that most people are overcon-
ﬁdent about DEMO their abilities and their
knowledge. For example, in a study of DEMO
preneurs, it was found that over 80% of the
entrepreneurs perceived DEMO chances of
success as 70% or better. Moreover, 33% of
them DEMO their success as certain!
The mean chance of success that entrepre-
neurs placed on a business like theirs was 59%
(as compared with a historically stable survival
rate of 33% during the ﬁrst ﬁve years of DEMO
venture; Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993).
Such unreasonably high numbers in the real
world explain why so many ventures fail in
their ﬁrst DEMO years of operation.
Availability or recency
To understand this judgment heuristic, DEMO just
need to know that people disproportionately
recall the salient events that they have
observed; those that are very recent, and/or
those DEMO individuals are/were emotionally
involved with, especially in the very recent
DEMO The more salient an event is, the more
likely the probability DEMO we can recall that
event. With the availability heuristics, people
search DEMO memories for relevant but recent
information and data.
7 Aside from research ﬁndings by Forlani, Olsen, and
others, my own personal experience as a founding entre-
preneur involved in launching a rather signiﬁcant pub-
lishing DEMO can attest to the power that illusion of
control or overconﬁdence has over our risk-taking
behavior.
The result is that this sort of bias DEMO
us from considering other potential and related
outcomes that may not have occurred just as
recently. For example, a San Francisco Bay
Area entrepreneur may assess the risk of start-
ing a new venture by recalling DEMO the positive
reports on all successful start-ups that she/he
has recently been reading about in the busi-
ness section of the Silicon Valley DEMO
News. The problem, however, is that not all
memories are equally retrievable (read avail-
able), and this leads to error in judgment. In
the above example, more recent incidences
and more salient events (DEMO positive reports on
successful start-ups) will weigh more heavily
than possibly DEMO and non-reported
incidences and this will lead to prediction
biases and would distort one’s judgment or
estimate.
The more salient an event
is, the more likely the
probability that we can
recall that event
Biases implicit DEMO the availability heuristic
affect estimates of risk.
Anchoring and adjustment
Anchoring refers to a tendency to anchor on,
and stay around, an initial arbitrary value
which may be suggested by the way a propo-
sition DEMO presented or by some initial computa-
tion. When forming estimates and predictions,
perceptions can be inﬂuenced by suggestions.
People adjust away from an DEMO value sug-
gested to them (the anchor) insufﬁciently to
arrive at the true value of the subject under
consideration (Tversky and Kahneman, DEMO).
An example would be the way an investment
banker uses the relative valuation model (mul-
tiples method) to arrive at an IPO DEMO, or a
VC uses the same method to price a venture

capital deal. In both cases prevailing multiples
which are chosen and DEMO up or down on
an arbitrary basis are used to come up with a
price. And that is where the bias comes in.
Maybe DEMO more sensible alternative would be to
look at the risks involved and the types of cash
ﬂows expected from the business and then
come DEMO with a value.
From the VC’s point of
view, anchoring bias DEMO
be used to statistically
argue that an
entrepreneur may
overestimate the chances
of success of his/
her business
From the VC’s point of DEMO, anchoring bias
can be used to statistically argue that an entre-
DEMO may overestimate the chances of
success of his/her business. Following Tversky,
Kahneman, and Minniti, such arguments can
go like this. Starting DEMO business venture is a
conjunctive event; for a start-up to succeed, it
must succeed in all the steps needed for its
success as DEMO whole. It must ﬁrst succeed in
producing a working prototype, then DEMO
ing the needed resources, including ﬁnancing,
to actually manufacture the DEMO, and later
hire a marketing and sales force to bring in
DEMO However, from a statistical point of
view, the overall probability of a conjunctive
event like a start-up is lower than the probabil-
ity DEMO each elementary event if such events are
independent. This means even if each of the
steps is very likely, the overall probability of
the venture’s success as a whole is low. And
this leads to overoptimism DEMO entrepreneurs
as they take the lower probabilities of elemen-
tary events as a reference point and adjust
them up or down insufﬁciently to arrive DEMO a
desired overall probability for the venture as a
whole.

Summary and conclusions
As a summary, let us recall that according to the
latest ﬁndings from the ﬁelds of psychology and
neuroscience as reported in this article, our
brain operates as a dual-processing system
where one process is rooted in DEMO (ana-
lytical, rule-based, or what is known as rational
operation) and the other is embedded in affect
(experience-based, emotional, or what is known
as affective operation). We discussed four major
psychological phenomena DEMO inﬂuence the
way we make choice and judgment: affect heu-
ristic, overconﬁdence, availability, and anchor-
ing phenomena. We also conﬁrmed that ‘most
DEMO risk perceptions simultaneously
contain affective and cognitive elements’.
The experience-based affective operation of
the brain has its own unique advantages as at
minimum, it simpliﬁes, reduces costs for, and
speeds up the decision-making process for
DEMO across the board. However, the
same operation can also lead to DEMO which
in turn can lead us in the wrong direction at
the time of a decision. And all this can happen
‘in the background’, in a seamless manner, so
we may not even notice anything. The reason
for this is that ‘affective reactions are often the
very ﬁ DEMO reactions, occurring automatically
and subsequently guiding information pro-
cessing and judgment’. DEMO if we notice our
biased way of thinking and we want to ‘de-bias’
such a process, our brain may not allow it
because of the way our brain is hard wired!
In the end, it is our
brain’s human-like
(affective) subsystem that
calls all the shots!
What DEMO really means is that we as VCs
and/or entrepreneurs may do all the sophisti-
cated analyses, formal due diligences, and
complicated evaluations DEMO valuations on a
given venture using our brain’s computer-like
(rational) subsystem; however, in the end, it
is our brain’s human-like (affective) subsystem
that calls all the shots!
