Good relationships between inventors and technology transfer officers
can reap dividends at every stage in the marketing of an invention or in
forming a company. Conversely, a lack of communication can play into the
hands of investors.

Technology transfer is now routine in all US academic institutions, and
increasingly so in research universities elsewhere. Laws similar to the
1980 US Bayh-Dole Act have been or are being passed in many countries,
allowing academic institutions to own and commercialize patents
resulting from the work of their researchers. In the US, technology
transfer in the health sciences has been responsible for many new drugs
and devices, not to mention the economic development of the vibrant US
biotechnology industry, which relies on academia for technology as well
as for people. Further, technology transfer from academia arguably has
been a major factor in the development of bioclusters; the formation,
growth and maturation of startup companies is what keeps such
bioclusters going.

The main argument made here is that the formation of startup companies,
and effective technology transfer in general, is greatly enhanced by a
strong relationship between the scientist entrepreneur and his or her
technology transfer professional (TTP). This article looks at various
factors that can affect this relationship and the consequences for the
researcher and the startup of maintaining a healthy relationship
throughout the process.


        Step by step

There are several reasons why a good relationship is important,
applicable to specific stages in the company's gestation and growth. In
the early stages, the scientist and the TTP each bring complementary
skill sets to the table, which is always a good thing. Ideally, the
scientist can inform the TTP of the applications of the work, and the
TTP can help the scientist envision the product that needs to result
from the technology in order to have a successful startup. Together they
can put together the best possible protection for the intellectual
property, a product-focused plan for the company's business and a
coordinated marketing strategy. In short, they can put together a
persuasive story to bring in quality investors.

At the negotiation phase with the startup company, it is important to
recognize that the economic interests of the inventor and the TTP are
fully aligned. They have much to gain by working as a team, and much to
lose if they don't?a poor relationship plays into the hands of the
investors, who are then well positioned to play one off against the
other. Usually this results in a better deal for the investors and a
poorer deal for the academics (Box 1
</bioent/building/tech/052005/box/bioent861_BX1.html>).

Further, the scientist's expectations of noneconomic benefits from the
startup (research funding, future collaborations, reagent exchanges,
technology availability) can be managed well only if the TTP can explain
early on which of these benefits, if any, are permitted under
institutional conflict-of-interest and other policies. These policies
vary among universities and even among schools in the same university.
When these issues are clear to everyone from the start, expectations are
reasonable, and the TTP can include specific nonfinancial terms into the
license agreement so that the inventor's expectations are indeed met
over time.

Finally, once the company is set up and growing, it will need productive
interactions between the founding inventor, company management and the
technology transfer office for its continued success. There will be
unforeseen technology needs, new discoveries from the inventor's
laboratory, renegotiations necessitated by the need for subsequent
financing and other factors, material transfer agreements (MTAs) for
reagents and other alliance management issues. Since most technology
transfer offices do not have committed personnel for alliance
management?an important issue in its own right that is outside the scope
of this article?the /ad hoc/ team of scientist plus TTP must handle all
these matters in a way that benefits the academic side without giving
things away.


        Building mutual trust

Clearly then, teamwork between inventor and TTP has many advantages.
However, very often, relations between academic scientists and their
TTPs are less than optimal. Although one can argue about why this is so,
it may be more productive to focus on how to build a good relationship.
Mutual trust is the key ingredient.

Trust is developed by working as a team from the beginning. Let us
examine the steps in commercialization of a discovery and see where the
inventing scientist and the TTP can work as a team (or wind up working
at cross purposes).

The first step is the disclosure of an invention to the licensing
office. At this stage, the researcher is often unsure of commercial
potential?even a knowledgeable scientist has not always fully thought
through how the work can lead to a product. Often, the researcher is
seeking the TTP's help to evaluate commercial potential and to identify
companies that work in the area as potential scientific collaborators.
In this situation, a technology transfer office's insistence on filling
out forms before any discussion can take place is not conducive to
building a good relationship, and a quick and tactless rejection can be
particularly damaging.

Instead, consider the benefits of a thorough discussion of the invention
between the relevant case manager (see Box 2
</bioent/building/tech/052005/box/bioent861_BX2.html>) and the inventor
as a first step. A good understanding of the invention is gained by the
TTP, which helps the technology transfer office's evaluation of the
commercial potential of the invention in question. This is also
appreciated by the inventor as a quick response and an indication of
interest on the part of the office, especially if the TTP arrives
scientifically well prepared for the discussion. Now an informed
discussion can take place between the TTP and the scientist on the
issues that really matter, such as the economic prospects of the work,
prior art, patentability analysis and company activities in the area.
The case manager has built credibility with the inventor and even a
decision not to patent the work can be communicated effectively. And if
the work is patented, the foundations for effective commercialization
have been laid.

The ensuing steps of patenting the technology and marketing it also
benefit from a good relationship. The former requires the case manager
to work closely with inventors and their coworkers to extract all the
relevant data and use the information to guide the patent attorneys in
drafting good claims and writing clear specifications. Opinions vary on
what constitutes effective marketing of academic biotech inventions but
few will disagree that a motivated inventor is helpful to the process.
Often the inventor's publications and presentations at conferences are
the key to landing a licensee. If the technology is appropriate for a
startup, the value of working as a team has been emphasized earlier.

On the other hand, the relationship of trust can go awry at any stage
for any number of reasons (see Box 3
</bioent/building/tech/052005/box/bioent861_BX3.html>). License
negotiation is one such area where things can go either very well (when
inventor expectations are managed) or very badly (when they are not).
Some offices have a prejudice when it comes to involving the inventor in
the negotiations?the prevailing dogma appears to be that this does more
harm than good. In my experience, this is not at all the case. An
informed inventor usually has manageable expectations, and can be a
great partner as described above. Most scientists who trust their TTPs
are quite happy to stay out of the business aspect of the negotiation,
which is the most frequently cited reason to keep inventors out of
license negotiations.

great partner."

		


        Establishing lines of communication

As in any relationship, effective communication is the most important
factor. This is one area where investigators often frustrate the efforts
of a well-meaning TTP by not responding to requests for data and not
answering questions that are vital to effective patent prosecution. Case
managers with good knowledge of the underlying science (e.g., those with
a PhD and post-doctoral training) are often better able to frame these
questions clearly. Scientifically trained case managers who can "speak
the same language" as the inventor can help build a good relationship,
especially when they take an active interest in the investigator's
research program. It also helps for case managers to simplify and
clarify what is needed, since often a simple yes or no is all that is
required rather than a lengthy explanation. And things go a lot better
when each person understands that the other is juggling many things at
the same time and respects the fact that the other person has limited
time to deal with the particular matter.

On the investigator's part, several things can be done to improve the
relationship.

    * Communicate with your TTP early and often?a lot can be
      accomplished by a quick e-mail or phone call?and early discussion
      of an invention facilitates decision making by both sides and
      saves time and aggravation in the long run.
    * Ask questions when things are not clear instead of wasting time
      and effort trying to interpret requests. Often these requests
      arise from arcane patent law issues that are hard to understand or
      from some specific prior art issue raised by an attorney, and
      require specific types of data. Guessing at what is needed does
      not help.
    * Think of the TTP as an external scientific collaborator, albeit
      one with specialized skills and capable of performing specialized
      duties. Such a mind-set not only opens up communications between
      the laboratory head and the TTP but also brings other lab members
      into the discussion. When the relationship between scientist and
      TTP operates at this level, the process of writing a patent
      application becomes similar to writing a specialized article
      together, finding a licensee for one's invention with a licensee
      becomes analogous to finding industry funding for the
      collaboration and starting up a company can be viewed like
      beginning a research collaboration with a third scientific
      collaborator or a company.

Although the above analogies may be stretching things, the central idea
is that teamwork pays dividends.

In such an atmosphere of mutual trust and effective communication, many
good things can happen. Chance meetings in the corridor or cafeteria
become a time for valuable updates and data exchanges. Investigators
have a confidante with whom they can discuss matters that they cannot
(or don't want to) discuss with other colleagues or within their labs.
For the TTP, marketing efforts become more effective, case managers
learn of new inventions as they develop, patenting decisions are made
optimally, and so on. The investigator obtains collateral benefits as
well, like quick processing of MTAs, landing industry-sponsored research
funding, getting useful reagents from industry, and sometimes even
placing post-docs and students in industry positions. And when it comes
to starting a company, the team is already in place.
