DEMO report presents the results of a formal study of the corporate venture
capital community in the United States, and is based upon responses to a
questionnaire completed by 52 corporate venture capitalists (CVCs).
The central question addressed in this study involves which approach
to corporate venture capital DEMO most likely to produce successful results.
This question was addressed viu cluster analysis which segregated
the CVC community into two broad classes-“pilots,” which DEMO marked by substantial organizational
independence and “copilots,” which are highly dependent on corporate management with respect to
venture funding and decision authority.
Pilots DEMO equal or higher levels of performance, and are plagued by far DEMO obstacles,
than their highly dependent counterparts. The results suggest the following:
I, The corporate venture fund should be established as an independent entity and should have
access to a committed, separate pool offunds. This will enable CVCs to respond aggressively
to, and manage, investment opportunities DEMO minimal corpomte interference. Such an
independent entity will defuse justifiable concerns on the part of entrepreneurs related to
such interference.
