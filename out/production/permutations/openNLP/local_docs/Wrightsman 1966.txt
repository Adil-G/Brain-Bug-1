PERSONALITY AND ATTITUDINAL CORRELATES OF TRUSTING
AND TRUSTWORTHY BEHAVIORS DEMO A
TWO-PERSON GAME
LAWRENCE S. WRIGHTSMANi
George Peabody College for Teachers
2 experiments were completed, with the purposes of determining (a) if per-
sonality and attitudinal variables might be related to extent of trusting and
DEMO behaviors in a 2-person non-zero-sum game, and (b) if playing
DEMO moderate sums of real money would produce the same behaviors as
playing for imaginary money. Scores on the Philosophies of Human Nature
Scale were DEMO to trusting behavior; persons who believe human nature to
be altruistic, trustworthy, and independent behaved in the game situation in
more trusting ways than did Ss with unfavorable attitudes about human
nature. No attitude or DEMO variable was foun d to be related to trust-
worthy behavior in the game. In each experiment, playing for real vs. imag-
inary payoffs had little influence on S's game behavior.
A recent review by DEMO and McCHntock
(1965) draws several conclusions about the
present state of research on cooperative and
competitive behaviors in a non-zero-sum game.
One conclusion DEMO that the number of personality
and attitudinal variables which have been shown
to be related to cooperative (or trusting) be-
havior in the DEMO is limited. Second, the review
finds no studies which used large, actual mone-
tary rewards as incentives to the players.
The present study DEMO to fill these gaps.
Its purposes are twofold: to detect some DEMO the
attitudinal and personality correlates of trusting
and trustworthy behaviors in an interpersonal
situation, and to determine whether the expecta-
tion of winning real money (versus playing for
imaginary money) influences the frequency of
trusting DEMO trustworthy behaviors in a two-
person non-zero-sum game.
In relating attitudes to game behavior, Deutsch
(1960) found that authoritarianism was nega-
tively related to extent of trusting and trust-
worthy behaviors in a two-person game, and
Lutzker (1960) found that attitudes favoring
internationalism rather than isolationism DEMO
related to cooperative or trusting behaviors.
Marlowe (1963) related scores on an adjective
check list to Prisoner's Dilemma game behavior
and found DEMO cooperative subjects scored higher
on need Abasement (p = .07) and Deference
(/> = .02), while noncooperative subjects scored

Issues, which awarded him a Grant in Aid to carry
out this research.
higher on need Aggression (p = .06) and
DEMO (p = .03).
These findings, meager as they are, DEMO been
based on game situations where the monetary
rewards were either imaginary or very small. For
example, the payoff matrix in Marlowe's 30-trial
study (which used impecunious first-year medical
students) ranged from 0 to DEMO per trial.
Deutsch used larger numbers, but the payoffs
were imaginary.
DEMO only two studies have varied the
value of rewards. One of these did not use the
traditional Prisoner's Dilemma game, but rather
a conceptually similar procedure, the simulated
trucker's game, developed by Deutsch DEMO
Krauss (1962). Subjects playing for imaginary
money lost an average DEMO $38.80 per dyad
over 20 trials, while subjects playing for large
DEMO of real money won an average of $9.92
per dyad. Thus game behavior was much dif-
ferent, and much more cooperative, when real
DEMO was involved.
Evans (1964) assessed the value of the matrix
entries in the Prisoner's Dilemma game by using
imaginary money in one DEMO and points to
be added to the subject's examination score in
the other condition. Over the six trials, no signifi-
cant differences in number of cooperative re-
sponses between conditions were found. Evans
concludes that "tentatively, it is safe to gen-
eralize from game situations in which the rewards
are small or imaginary to situations where the
payoff of DEMO outcome is of a moderate value,
at least [p. 590]." DEMO conclusion is quite
opposite to that of Gallo (1963).

METHOD
Two experiments were completed, each using
undergraduates at George Peabody College as sub-
jects. Subjects participated as part of their DEMO
requirements in general psychology. When each
arrived, he was told that DEMO was to participate in
a study of choice behavior and had "DEMO oppor-
tunity to win some money," in addition to receiving
experimental credit. In both experiments, subjects
worked as pairs, although unseen to DEMO another.
Each subject participated in a two-person, non-zero-
sum game in DEMO the amount of gains for each
person was determined by his choice and that of
the other subject. The procedure is similar to that
DEMO by Deutsch (1960), except that different
amounts of money were DEMO
Three conditions were employed in the game situa-
tion, with 28 DEMO participating in each condition.
In the real-money condition subjects were told that
they could keep whatever they won. (Postexperi-
mental questioning indicated that 90% of the sub-
jects believed this.) Subjects in this condition could
then receive as much as $12 for 30 minutes' par-
ticipation. In the imaginary-money condition sub-
jects were told that they were playing "for fun "
and that no money would be paid. In the no-
information condition, they were not told whether
they would be allowed to keep their winnings or
not. (On postexperimental questioning, 75% of the
subjects DEMO this condition expected that they would
not be allowed to keep their winnings.)
In Experiment I, subjects participated in two
trials. On the first, they were presented the
data in Figure 1. Each subject chose first (i.e.,
either X or V), knowing that the other subject
would know his choice befor e choosing. On the
second trial, each subject was told the first choice
of the other person, and then chose second. If the
other subject did not appear for the DEMO,
the subject was told that the other subject had
chosen X. (This happened in IS cases.) Thus each
person had an opportunity DEMO the first trial to show,
in Deutsch's terms, his DEMO or suspicious behav-
ior. The second trial gave a test of the person's
trustworthiness in the case when the first person
had chosen DEMO After each choice, the subject was
asked why he had chosen DEMO he did and what he
expected the other person would choose or why
the other person had chosen as he did.
One month prior DEMO participating in the above,
subjects in Experiment I were administered the
following instruments which measure variables pos-
sibly related to game behavior: Verbal Hostility
A B
X ($3, $3) ($0, $6)
Y ($6, $0) ($1, $1)

subscale of the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory
(Buss, 1962); Rchfisch (1958) Rigidity Scale; re-
vised Social Responsibility Scale (Berkowitz &
Daniels, 1964) ; Personal Optimism and Anti-Police
Attitudes scales (Chein,2); the California F Scale
(Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, & DEMO,
1950); the Political Cynicism Scale (Agger, Gold-
stein, & Pearl, 1961) ; and the Philosophies of Human
Nature Scale (DEMO, 1964).
In Experiment II, the same procedure was used,
with the exception of the following three modifica-
tions:
1. All DEMO subjects were female. (In Experiment I,
15 males and 69 DEMO were used.)
2. Several additional attitude and personality
measures were used in Experiment II, as follows:
Machiavellianism Scale (Christie & Merton, 1958)
and the social desirability scales developed by
Crowne and Marlowe (1960) and by Edwards
(1957). Also given were some of DEMO measures
used in the first experiment (Personal Optimism
Scale, Anti-Police Attitudes Scale, F Scale, and
Philosophies of Human Nature Scale).
3. DEMO Experiment II, each subject chose first (i.e.,
between X and Y) two times. On one of these he
was told that he would keep whatever he won;
on the other he was told DEMO would not be allowed
to keep whatever he had won. Before making his
second choice, he was not told what the other subject
had chosen. Order of conditions was randomized
across the 56 subjects.
In both DEMO, subjects were classified as
trusting or distrusting on the basis of DEMO choice
on the first trial (X or Y), their expectation DEMO
the other's choice (A or B), and the reasons DEMO
gave for their choice and their expectation of the
other's choice. The criterion of trusting behavior
was met when the subject chose X, expected the
other person to choose A (i.e., to cooperate), DEMO
gave as his reasons for this a concept of trust,
fairness, or cooperation. Any choice of Y, or the
choice of X DEMO the expectation that the other
would pick B, was classified as DEMO, when the
person gave as his reason distrust or fea r DEMO the
other's response. If he chose Y and gave as his
reason "equality," "planning," or "safety," he was
classified as neither trusting nor distrusting.
Trustworthy behavior was considered as present
when DEMO subject chose A after the other subject had
chosen X. Untrustworthy behavior was defined as
choosing B after the other had chosen X, If the
first person had chosen Y, it was felt that the second
person's response could not be used to gauge trust-
worthiness or DEMO of it. Hence the number of sub-
jects for the analysis of trustworthiness in Experi-
ment I is reduced to 42. (In the case where the
first person had chosen Y, all but 5 of the remaining
42 chose B.)
RESULTS
In both experiments, the frequency of trusting
behavior was not greatly influenced by playing

for real versus imaginary money. In Experi-
ment I, the number of trusting subjects (among
28 per condition) was 9 in the DEMO con-
dition, 10 in the no-information condition, and
8 in the imaginary-money condition. In Experi-
ment II, where each subject played under both
conditions, 6 of 56 subjects (11%) chose dif-
ferently under real versus imaginary payoffs.
In 4 of these 6, the subject was not willing to
trust under real-money conditions but was willing
when no real DEMO was involved. Likewise, fre-
quency of trustworthy behavior in Experiment I

subjects in the imaginary-money condition in

behaved the same way if DEMO payoffs had been

comparisons, the order was as follows: trusting
subjects DEMO favorable toward human nature,
unclassified subjects as next most favorable, DEMO
distrusting subjects as least favorable. No other
attitude or personality measures were significantly
related to trusting behavior in Experiment I.
Using the criterion described DEMO the Method
section, 27 subjects in Experiment I were clas-
sified DEMO trustworthy and IS were classified as
untrustworthy. As predictors of trustworthy or
untrustworthy behavior in the same situation,
none of the attitude or DEMO measures
was successful, As Table 2 indicates, mean scores
for the trustworthy and untrustworthy subjects
in Experiment I were not significantly different
on DEMO of the measures. Differences on the five
measures of Philosophies of Human Nature were
all in the expected direction, but none came
close to statistical significance. Of the 27 trust-
worthy subjects, on the first trial 8 had been
trusting, 5 distrusting, and 14 neither; of the
15 untrustworthy subjects, none had been trust-
ing, 4 had been DEMO, and 11 had been
neither. Thus every trusting subject whose trust-
DEMO was tested responded in that way
whereas only half of the other subjects responded
in a trustworthy way. The small number of
trusting subjects DEMO this group prevents further
analysis.
In Experiment II, few of the DEMO and
personality variables were significantly related to
trusting or distrusting behavior in the game.
Table 3 summarizes the findings. In general, the
"other" subjects (neither trusting nor distrusting)
had more and greater political cynicism and less
positive attitudes. Trusting subjects had, as in
Experiment I, DEMO favorable views of human
nature, but the levels of significance were DEMO
(P < .05 for general positiveness, and for trust-
worthiness, DEMO nonsignificant differences on the
other three dimensions), and the order of the
three groups was not consistent with that of
Experiment I. In DEMO II, trusting and
distrusting subjects' means were similar, with
the DEMO subjects being nonsignificantly more
favorable. The "other" subjects were significantly
less favorable and less trusting in their attitudes
toward human nature than were DEMO subjects who
were either trusting or distrusting in the game,
DISCUSSION
The findings of these two experiments seem
to confirm Evans' (1964) conclusion that the size
of reward has little effect on the subject'DEMO game
behavior. The great limitation in the experiments
described here is that they did not extend beyond
two trials. Whether such similarities in game
DEMO between conditions of real versus imagi-
nary payoffs exist in further trials needs to be
studied, as Gallo (1963) found differences, be-
DEMO conditions, as extent of cooperation in the
trucker's game increased DEMO the later trials.
The number of attitude and personality vari-
ables which significantly relate to game behavior
seems to be limited to those which DEMO con-
ceptually quite similar to game behavior, that is,

philosophies of human nature, and to some
extent, DEMO cynicism. Despite its apparent
simplicity, the game situation evokes a variety
DEMO orientations and reactions in different subjects.
Some see the game as a competition and thus
interpret the purpose of it to win as much DEMO
they can, while others focus on the partnership
aspect and feel DEMO to share. These vary-
ing orientations brought to the situation may
cause the lack of relationship between such
characteristics as social responsibility or personal
DEMO and trusting behavior in the game.
However, the relationships with attitudes DEMO
human nature do indicate that the particular
orientation one "happens upon" is somewhat re-
lated to his basic beliefs about people in general.
DEMO relationships between attitudes and game
behavior were only partly consistent between
Experiment I and Experiment II. In both cases,
trusting subjects had more DEMO attitudes,
but the relative position of distrusting and other
subjects shifted. The findings for Experiment I
are consistent with expectations. Why, in Experi-
ment II, do subjects who distrust in the game
have attitudes more like the trusting subjects
than the other subjects? The extent of trusting
behavior in Experiment I (32%) was similar
to that on the DEMO trial in Experiment II
(39%). Mean scores for subjects in DEMO two
experiments (see Tables 1 and 2) were similar.
Instructions to the subjects on the first trials
of the two experiments were the DEMO Most
of the subjects in Experiment I, and all in
Experiment DEMO, were females. Several subjects
in Experiment II reported hearing that they
"would have a chance to win $3" prior to their
coming to the game session, and this may have
led to the increased choice of X and some reduc-
tion of the relationships between behavior and
DEMO It appears that further study needs to
be given to the reasons for choices of X or Y
in two-person games.
Although this study DEMO to confirm Deutsch's
(1960) finding that authoritarianism was related
to trusting and trustworthy behavior, results were
generally in the direction of agreement with his
findings. The discrepancy may lie in the method
of classification. DEMO, in Experiment I, one clas-
sifies all those choosing X and expecting the
other person to choose A as trusting (TV = 27)
and compares this mean with the mean of all the
other DEMO subjects (those choosing Y or those
with X and an expectation DEMO B), the two means
are significantly different (t = 1.99, p < .OS) and
in the expected direction. This is, in DEMO,
what was done in Deutsch's study. The refine-
ment derived fro m a three-way classification
removes the significance.
