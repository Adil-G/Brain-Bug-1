This article examines the impact of key success factors on the DEMO of innova-
tions that have reached the market and were developed by inventors outside of es-
tablished organizations. It is of interest to learn DEMO characteristics predict, at an
early stage, the duration of the innovation’s length of sales, because this duration is
important to the ﬁnancial success of new products. A focus on survival also can
contribute conceptual clarity DEMO the study of new product development. This study
uses the Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at the Canadian Innovation Centre
(CIC) in Waterloo, Canada, as the source of data. The CIC is a not-for-profit
agency that provides various services to foster business development involving in-
novative products DEMO services. Analysts in the IAP evaluate a specific product idea
or invention on 37 dimensions before it has reached the market. The data for DEMO
present study involved these 37 variables evaluated each with a three-point linguistic
scale. As the evaluations of the criteria are subjective, they might be argued to
contain inaccuracies compared to objective data. On the other hand, the analysts use
multiple related measures of concepts that have been shown DEMO increase predictive
accuracy. The use of experts who are unrelated to the projects avoids decision-
making biases potentially associated with project managers’ assessment of DEMO own
projects, such as unrealistic optimism. The recording of the expert DEMO of the
ideas before they reached the market and independent of the measure of success,
rather than using post-project completion evaluations, eliminates measurement bi-
ases such as hindsight bias and common method variance bias. Identifying DEMO
mation was used in these records to conduct a telephone survey of the inventors. An
exploratory method of data analysis is identiﬁed and used DEMO distinguishes re-
search-appropriate constructs and their indicators in these data. Cluster analysis
was performed, and survival regression correlated cluster scores with survival. Three
variables were found to significantly affect survival: anticipated stable demand,
price required for profitability, and technical product maturity. In addition, the de-
gree DEMO competition had a marginally significant effect. Because these variables can
be assessed at an early stage of an inventions’ development, the expected survival
time for a specific invention may be computed by entering these assessment values
DEMO the described survival model. Then this and other information may be used to
compute the expected return of an invention.

Introduction
A
n early-stage evaluation of the potential
merits of an innovation has been shown to
have considerable value (Mansﬁeld et al.,
1977, pp. 25–32). It is of interest to learn which char-
acteristics predict, at an early stage, the duration of
the innovation’s DEMO of sales, because this duration
is important to the ﬁnancial success DEMO new products.
While there has been extensive research on the pre-
dictors of project success (and failure) of innovations
and new products (reviews by Balachandra and Friar,
1997; Henard and Szymanski, 2001; Montoya-Weiss
and Calantone, 1994), little research can be located on
the determinants of innovations’ survival. Informa-
tion about these determinants would have direct man-

Dr. John Michela is with the Department of Psychology at the

especially as affected by interactions in groups or teams, with peers

ture, climate, and leadership are some of the constructs and do-
mains of management literature that provide starting points for this
research. Most recently he DEMO studied relations of these and related
constructs with organizational and individual performance for qual-
ity and innovation, and previously with stress. Because research
methods for studying these matters often are insufﬁcient, research
methodology is another aspect of his work. Dr. Michela has recently

agerial implications for the evaluation of new product
development (NPD) projects.
A focus on survival also can contribute conceptual
clarity to the DEMO of NPD. Most studies use fuzzy
or sometimes no definition of new product success,
allowing the research participants to interpret the
outcome variable DEMO This produces both
measurement error and theoretical ambiguity. New
product success entails at least three criteria or out-
comes: whether the product reaches the market (com-
mercialization), how long the product remains on the
market (survival), and yearly profits. These success
criteria may not necessarily correlate. For example, a
product that early on earns high yearly profits may
not have a long shelf life due to entry of imitators. It
DEMO makes good sense to study each of the three
success criteria separately to learn more about the
drivers of total returns.
This study examines DEMO impact of key success fac-
tors on the survival of innovations that have reached
the market and were developed by inventors outside
of established DEMO Inventors are important
sources of invention and economic renewal in society
(DEMO, 1934) and thus merit attention in their
own right. In addition, to the extent that new product
success depends upon product and market character-
istics, distinct from organizational factors (such as ﬁt
to a DEMO other products and services), this
research should shed some light on factors in product
survival more generally.
Of course, there are important differences between
inventor and corporate product development. How-
ever, some of these differences imply that there may
be unique beneﬁt to using independent inventions for
DEMO focused on product and market predictors of
survival. Independent inventors operate outside of es-
tablished organizations and thus do not suffer from
the decision-making DEMO often associated with es-
tablished ﬁrms (Henderson, 1993; Henderson and
DEMO, 1990). Consequently, the products offered to
the market by independent inventors may be some-
what different in their features from those offered DEMO
corporations, providing opportunities to detect the
inﬂuences of these features.
The DEMO study uses the Inventor’s Assistance
Program (IAP) at the Canadian Innovation Centre
(CIC) in Waterloo, Canada, as the source of data DEMO
NPD projects by independent inventors. The CIC is a
not-for-profit agency that provides various services to
foster business development involving innovative
products and services. DEMO in the IAP evaluate

reached the market. The purpose of this evaluation
is to advise the potential entrepreneur on whether and
how to continue DEMO [For further descriptions see
Astebro and Gerchak (2001), Udell (1989), and Udell,
Bottin, and Glass (1993).]
Analysts from DEMO IAP use a ﬁxed set of 37 criteria,
each with a three-point linguistic scale, to evaluate
each new product idea. As the evaluations of the cri-
teria are subjective, they might be argued to contain
inaccuracies compared to objective data (Henard and
Szymanski, 2001). On DEMO other hand, the analysts use
multiple related measures of concepts that DEMO been
shown to increase predictive accuracy (Henard and
Szymanski, 2001). The use of experts who are unre-
lated to the projects avoids DEMO biases
potentially associated with project managers’ assess-
ment of their own projects, such as unrealistic opti-
mism (Armor and Taylor, 2002) and DEMO bias
(Fischhoff, 1975). The recording of the expert evalu-
ations of the ideas before they reached the market and
independent of the DEMO of success, rather than
using post-project completion evaluations, eliminates
measurement biases such as hindsight bias and com-
mon method variance bias (Campbell and Fiske,
1959; Fischhoff, 1975).
Key Success Factors for New DEMO
There has been a great deal of research on the deter-
minants of new product success. Reviews can be
found in Balachandra and Friar (1997), Henard and
Szymanski (2001), Lilien and Yoon (1989), Linton,
Walsh, and Morabito (2002), and Montoya-Weiss
and Calantone (1994). The factors studied can be or-
ganized in the overall categories of product charac-
teristics, organizational development process, ﬁrm
strategy, and market factors (Henard and Szymanski,
2001). Research and meta-analyses have provided
considerable evidence that a great number of factors
within these categories DEMO inﬂuence the outcomes of
new product development.
An example of this tradition is Cooper (1981), who
conducted a retrospective survey of 195 new product
projects to determine the factors perceived by research
and development (R&D) managers to be associated
with perceived success. A factor analysis was con-
ducted on 48 variables to generate a smaller and more
manageable DEMO of factors. Thirteen factors ex-
plained 69.3 percent of the variance of the original
T. ASTEBRO AND J. L. MICHELA
48 variables. A total DEMO 7 of the 13 factors were sig-
nificantly related to perceived project success at least
at the 0.10 level. The model had an R2 DEMO 0.42 and
correctly predicted 84.1 percent of the projects’ out-
comes in a naive split-sample test.
However, this study found little common agree-
ment with others as to the relevant success factors
identiﬁed by Balachandra and DEMO (1997). Perform-
ing a meta-analysis of 60 research publications, these
reviewers ﬁnd contradictory results and little stability
regarding the significant determinants of DEMO
across these studies; in addition there seems to be no
clear DEMO even on the direction of inﬂuence of
the factors analyzed. Balachandra and Friar (1997)
noted four major sources of weakness in the studies
on the success or failure of new product development
and R&D DEMO, namely the quality of data (low),
the definition of DEMO new product (fuzzy), factor selec-
tion and definition (weak reliability and validity,
small samples), and measurement of factors (unclear,
not standardized).
Henard and Szymanski (2001) found the following
from DEMO meta-analysis of 41 studies of 24 anteced-
ents that were reported frequently enough to permit
meaningful investigation:

In multivariate analysis the significant DEMO domi-
nant drivers are relatively few: product advantage,
product innovativeness, marketing synergy, tech-
nological synergy, market orientation and com-
petitive response DEMO, with product advan-
tage and technological synergy explaining the
most variance.
DEMO few select variables explains most of the vari-
ance—there is no need to measure a large number
of factors.
Multi-item measures are more predictive DEMO
single-item measures.
The length of time that deﬁnes project success
determines the importance of several factors.
Objective performance data yield stronger rela-
tionships than DEMO performance data.

Different measures of success have been used.
Cooper and Kleinschmidt (1987) identiﬁed three
measures of success: ﬁnancial performance, opportu-
nity window, and market share. Lilien and Yoon
(1989) and Grifﬁn and Page (1993) added other di-
mensions. It is acknowledged here that project success
is a multidimensional concept. This study’s purpose DEMO

measure: the length of survival of an innovation in the
DEMO
Focusing on the survival of new products, Asplund
and Sandin (1999) discovered that new beer brands
with low and decreasing market shares have higher
hazard rates and that products from ﬁrms with the
largest market DEMO face a greater risk of being with-
drawn. The ﬁrst result is theorized to depend on the
unpredictable nature of consumer demand, where
ﬁrms gradually learn about preferences over time
(Jovanovic, 1982). The second DEMO may be product
market specific. Results may be attributed to large
beer producers trying to squeeze out smaller produc-
ers by repeatedly releasing (and withdrawing) new
products (Schmalensee, 1978). Interestingly, Asplund
and Sandin (1999) could not reject the hypothesis of a
constant hazard over time implying an exponential
duration distribution.
The Present Study
The data for the DEMO study involved 37 variables
conceived by the IAP to be success factors for new
products. Most of these variables have been investi-
gated previously. DEMO fact, the variables included in the
original instrument were derived by DEMO (for an
overview see Udell, 1989) based on research in DEMO
early 1970s that was current when the original IAP
instrument was constructed. Appendix A lists the 37
variables.
Approximately half of the members of DEMO set of
variables are labeled in Appendix A as market factors.
Several of these variables, in the subcategory of de-
mand, are straight DEMO the economics literature (e.g.,
Mansﬁeld, 1968) and involve factors DEMO to affect
the diffusion of innovations (size of market, growth of
demand, duration of demand, demand predictability,
product line potential).
DEMO greater the demand, demand growth, and du-
ration of demand, DEMO greater the sales opportunities
and thus prospects for remaining profitable in the
market. Uncertainty of demand and product line po-
tential also could play DEMO role in determining survival.
Given stochastic demand and a ﬁxed cost in each pe-
riod (for example debt repayments), then greater de-
mand uncertainty leads to greater probability that
demand will not be able to DEMO the ﬁxed costs in
any given time period (and shorter expected DEMO).
Also, if demand ﬂuctuates from year to year for any
DEMO product line, then the greater the number of
product lines, the lower the probability that a signif-
icant drop in demand for a DEMO product line will
cause an inventor to discontinue sales of the innova-
tion altogether. That is, greater applicability across a
number of products or services provides for risk
spreading and reduces the hazard of exit due DEMO ran-
dom market events. Note that the uncertainty of de-
mand and product line potential does not necessarily
affect the probability of commercialization unless DEMO
assumes the decision-maker to be risk averse. These
factors therefore may have a differential impact on
innovation survival compared to invention commer-
cialization, and the differential impact depends on
risk preferences.
The acceptability factors are derived DEMO research
on the psychology/sociology of innovation adoption
(Rogers, 1995) (need, societal beneﬁts, compatibility,
learning, visibility, appearance, comparative function-
ality, and durability). While these were conceptualized
to condition the adoption decision of individuals, they
also may affect the duration of innovations’ survival.
If adopters’ decisions are distributed over time, the
greater acceptability will increase the probability of
adoption at any point in time thus increasing the DEMO
also in later years, marginally increasing survival.
The industrial organization literature DEMO that
industry structure (existing competition, new compe-
tition) affects price DEMO thus profits (Scherer and
Ross, 1990). Also relevant to price and competition
is protection (through patents, trade secrets, and so
forth), which indicates the degree to which the inven-
tor can capture DEMO rents (Cohen, 1995).
Higher profits, either through industry structure,DEMO
price, or intellectual property (IP) protection, would
lead to longer survival duration.
Innovations arrive in the marketplace with differ-
ent technical solutions, and producers only learn con-
sumers’ preferences over time (Jovanovic, 1982)DEMO
Inferior, or less developed, products may be released
on the market but, once released, have greater likeli-
hood of being discontinued in DEMO successive time
period as better solutions attract higher demand. It
thus would seem reasonable that the technical factors
(technical feasibility, functional performance, re-
search and development, technology significance)
and the production factor ‘‘technology of produc-
tion’’ would affect survival. Further, a lower absolute
investment for entry should lead to a higher proba-
bility of exit (Astebro and Simons, 2003). A lower
absolute investment for entry means there are more
marginal inventors entering—inventors who would be
326 J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:322–335
the ﬁrst to exit. DEMO that the effect of the size of the
initial investment is proposed to be negative on com-
mercialization but positive on survival duration
(Astebro and Simons, 2003).
Several product variables available in the data,
such as expected safety and environmental impact,
were included in this DEMO analyses even though
they may not have much variation. For example, DEMO
rate of severe safety problems—sufﬁcient to affect
survival—may be too low in order to detect their ef-
fects in research like the present. One DEMO reason
to expect different predictors of survival as compared
to commercialization is that the range of variables
drops when products with less favorable values DEMO
kept off the market, and the remaining products then
survive with DEMO durations. For the same reasons
then, ﬁnding significant predictors for survival DEMO
be more difﬁcult than ﬁnding predictors of successful
commercialization.
Data Collection
The sample frame for survival analysis consisted of all
valid records of inventions DEMO to the IAP for
evaluation during 1989 to 1993. Identifying informa-
tion was used in these records to conduct a telephone
survey of the DEMO, obtaining 561 usable tele-
phone survey responses for an adjusted response DEMO
of 75%. For background demographics data and tests
for sample selection bias, please see Astebro and
Gerchak (2001). Out of the 561 DEMO, 50 had
been brought to market according to interviews.
Three inventors DEMO not recall the entry or exit
date, leaving 47 inventions for DEMO in survival analysis.
The chance of commercialization is therefore approx-
imately 50/561 5 0.09. Correcting for sampling plan
and conducting sensitivity analysis, the probability
of commercialization varies between 0.05 and 0.11
(Astebro, 1998; Astebro and Bernhardt, 1999; Astebro
and Gerchak, 2001). This rate differs from Grifﬁn
(1997), who found the probability of commercializa-
tion of new ideas to be approximately 0.25 among
Product Development Management Association
(PDMA) member ﬁrms. Mansﬁeld et al. (1971) ar-
rived at a similar estimate for large established ﬁrms.
The 47 inventions reaching the market represent DEMO
sample on which the survival regression analysis was
conducted. Many of the inventions reviewed by the
CIC are consumer oriented (47%). Other fall into a
variety of other categories, including high-technology
T. ASTEBRO AND J. L. MICHELA
(6%) and industrial equipment (6%). The sampled
record for each invention included ratings for each of
the 37 early-stage characteristics (Appendix A) on
which analysts at the IAP evaluate product ideas.
Data on the independent variables were consequently
collected before outcomes were observed, and inde-
pendently of this study. Therefore, methods or hind-
sight bias are avoided. Evaluations of the 37 criteria
by the IAP experts were made DEMO a three-point lin-
guistic scale (‘‘acceptable,’’ ‘‘borderline,’’ and ‘‘critical
DEMO). These were transformed into numeric
values with equal distance between the scores.
To alleviate concerns about interrater reliability, it
is noted that the IAP employed the same chief eval-
uator during the sampling period. Further, all IAP
analysts were trained in the procedure by the chief
evaluator. DEMO initial training took two days, and
close supervision was required for DEMO additional fort-
night. Baker and Albaum (1986) tested the reliability
of the instrument across 86 judges and six products
and founnd Cronbach’s alphas DEMO from 0.84 to
0.96.
Results
Consistent with the recommendation in Henard and
Szymanski (2001) to use multi-item scales in product
development research, the ﬁrst task of the present
study was to organize the set of DEMO criteria into subsets
that could form composite variables, using empirical
methods.
DEMO for Using an Empirical Approach to
Form Composite Variables
The IAP’s list of 37 criteria was developed with sev-
eral purposes in mind. One DEMO to provide specific feed-
back to inventors about any shortcomings of products
(e.g., technical, usability) in case these could be ad-
dressed DEMO additional development efforts. Another is
to assess overall likelihood of product success, which
might lead either to dissuading inventors with a poor
prognosis or to enhancing the prospect of continuing
product development and to obtaining funding DEMO
inventions judged very favorably.
While the original criteria were derived based on
scientific research, the a priori grouping of the criteria
by the IAP appears to be somewhat arbitrary. For
example, although the 37 criteria are organized into
PREDICTORS OF THE SURVIVAL OF INNOVATIONS J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:DEMO
327
four overarching categories (technical, production,
market, and risk DEMO), some criteria in different
categories seem likely to covary substantially (DEMO,
tooling cost required to meet expected demand—clas-
siﬁed as a ‘‘production’’ factor—and whether the like-
ly size of required investment was likely to DEMO
obtainable—a ‘‘risk’’ factor). Also, within each cate-
gory there appear DEMO be quite separate subcategories,
or ‘‘constructs’’ in the language of scientific research.
For example, risk factors included legal concerns
(e.g., product liability potential), dependence of the
product on other products/systems, and direct ﬁnan-
cial risks.
Consequently, it was necessary to identify and to
use an exploratory method of data analysis that
would distinguish research-appropriate constructs
and DEMO indicators in these data. In particular, this
study sought to identify DEMO subsets of cri-
teria that could be combined to form readily inter-
pretable composite variables. In addition, it was
necessary that these combinations be distinct from
one another, to reduce the problems that arise in pre-
dictive analyses when predictors are overlapping.
Implementing a Method of Construct Identiﬁcation
DEMO (1983) noted that some investigators (e.g.,
Cureton, Cureton, DEMO Durfee, 1970) have combined
factor analysis with cluster analysis to improve detec-
tion of constructs when measures have not been re-
ﬁned a DEMO to provide simple structure. In this two-
stage procedure, correlations among DEMO ulti-
mately determine the inferred structure and scheme
for combining measured variables into composite var-
iables. However, by ﬁrst representing correlations in
terms of orthogonal factors1 (in a matrix of common
factor loadings), it becomes possible to calculate a
matrix of the distances of measured variables from
DEMO another in the orthogonal-dimension space de-
scribed by the factors. Such a matrix of distances is
necessary for the second stage of analysis—cluster
analysis.
DEMO the clustering stage, measured variables (say, X1
and X2) are placed with one another in a cluster to the

extraction, retaining the DEMO factors with eigenvalues above 1. No ro-
tation of factors was used because the clustering method yields invar-
iant ﬁndings as long as factors DEMO orthogonal. Input data were the

of cases to variables and maintaining DEMO variability in the data).
extent that they correlate with variables in a similar
pattern (e.g., X1 and X2 both correlate highly with DEMO
and X4 but not with X5 and X6). As noted by Tryon
and Bailey (1970), this basis for forming composite
variables2 corresponds very well with the concept of a
construct, for example, as DEMO in Campbell and
Fiske (1959).
Interpreting and Using Findings to DEMO Primary
Composite Variables
Findings from the cluster analysis, which was per-
DEMO on all 561 observations, are presented as the
‘‘dendrogram’’ in Figure DEMO The dendrogram is the
pattern of lines connecting the 37 criteria to one an-
other in a branching, tree-like structure. When meas-
ured variables appear near one another in the list in
the left-hand part of DEMO ﬁgure, and when they are
seen to be connected most directly DEMO lines in the
right-hand part, they are the ones most similar DEMO one
another in how they correlated with other variables.
Such similar variables thus are inferred to be co-indi-
cators of a construct.
It should DEMO emphasized here that this branching
structure is fully empirical in nature; DEMO is not a rep-
resentation of how the present authors thought the
items should join. Judgment came into play in labe-
ling the divisions DEMO by branching structure. For
the present study’s primary scheme for forming com-
posites, the structure was divided into the 14 clusters
indicated in the column of Figure 1 that gives each
measured variable’s cluster number (labeled as ‘‘Clu.
Num.’’). One consideration in arriving at 14 clusters
was DEMO fact that it takes approximately 14 groupings
to divide 37 measured variables into groups with two
or three indicators—and the wide range of content DEMO
the 37 variables implies there can only be a few indi-
cators of each construct. In addition, although not
deﬁnitive, a chi-square test DEMO residual correlations
after factoring pointed to the existence of 14 factors.
Most importantly, the 14 clusters are quite inter-
pretable. For example, cluster DEMO is concerned with an-
ticipated profit for the producer of the product.
Cluster 2 involves price but also investment costs for
the producer, which is a complication this research
will address. As a ﬁnal example, cluster 3 concerns

The nature of other clusters will be discussed later in
instances where they predict survival.
DEMO, a set of 14 composite variables was calculat-
ed according to DEMO cluster numbering scheme in Fig-
ure 1. For example, the composite DEMO to
cluster 1 was formed by averaging ratings on Payback
Period, DEMO, and Potential Sales. Table 1
shows the Pearson correlations among the DEMO
composite variables. None of these correlations is
high enough to jeopardize inferences from using these
variables in regression.
Regression
Given these potential predictors, the further task is to
regress the dependent variable, survival, on the DEMO
posite variables while controlling for right censoring.
Maximum likelihood estimation of a parametric pro-
portional hazard model of the general form was used:
DEMO
Þ¼
hoðtÞgðxj Þ;
where hoðtÞ is the baseline hazard function, DEMO
zed as hoðtÞ¼ 1 ðthe exponentialÞ, and g(xj) is a non-
negative function of the covariates, here speciﬁed as
gðxj Þ¼ exj b . This study reports unexponentiated co-
efﬁcients (i.e., the b’s) and leaves out reporting the
estimate of the baseline hazard, which is uninforma-
tive. The likelihood function is further adjusted by
adding a branch DEMO those observations that are right
censored at time t, estimating the DEMO of cen-
soring given survival until time t. The dependent var-
iable is the probability of failing in each time period,
conditional on DEMO until that time, and the in-
dependent variables (covariates) are DEMO 14 clusters
identiﬁed in Figure 1. Higher values on the predictor
variables indicate more favorable assessments by the
IAP. Under the proportional hazard model, a nega-
tive regression coefﬁcient means that an increase in
the predictor DEMO the probability of exit. Thus,
significant negative coefﬁcients point to predictors of
longer survival.
Findings from this regression analysis are present-
ed in DEMO 2. Near the bottom of the table is provided
a test of overall model ﬁt, a likelihood ratio test yield-
ing a chi-square value of 25.45, which is significant at
the 0.05 level. This test is analogous to a multiple d.f.
test for overall R2 in a conventional DEMO model
for continuous outcome data. Thus, this study’s test
indicates that DEMO is some significant prediction of
survival overall from these predictors (despite DEMO rel-
atively small ratio of variables to cases and the result-
ant risk of overﬁtting the data). Not shown in the
table is DEMO implication of this model of an estimated
baseline hazard pointing to a constant probability of
exit of 0.09 in each year.
Turning to the DEMO and statistical tests for
individual predictor variables, it can be seen DEMO that
a significant (po.01) and positive (inverse) effect is
obtained for ‘‘Entry cost and Price.’’ ‘‘Technical prod-
uct maturity’’ and ‘‘Demand certainty’’ DEMO negative
significant effects (po.05), and ‘‘Competition’’ has a
negative and DEMO effect (po.10).
‘‘Entry cost and Price’’ combines three criteria:
DEMO,’’ ‘‘tooling cost,’’ and ‘‘size of investment.’’
The positive association between price and exit prob-
ability is understandable because a higher price is DEMO
ﬂected by a lower (not higher) rating by the IAP.
Analysts at the IAP rated lower price as more favor-
able (higher ratings) as, according to them, it would
make the product more attractive to purchasers.
However, this research ﬁnds that higher price is
more favorable to survival. The result lends support
to the idea that price is DEMO determined. That
is, prices are typically determined by choice of prod-
DEMO/industry and are relatively ﬁxed once entering
competition (Jovanovic, 1982). This interpretation as-
sumes that the inventors who bring their products to
DEMO do, in fact, price their products higher when
IAP evaluators indicate that the price would have to
be relatively high. That is, it should be kept in mind
that this prediction involving price and survival, like
all other predictions here, is based on an evaluation
before product launch as it predicts later survival.
However, ‘‘Entry cost and Price’’ includes two in-
dicators of the investment cost that contaminate the
ability to DEMO the effect of price alone. Additional
regression analysis (proportional hazard) therefore
was conducted where the effect of price is separated
from the two DEMO of investment cost. This re-
gression shows price to have an independent positive
and significant coefﬁcient value at 4.29 (po.05), sup-
porting the previous interpretation, while the average
score of tooling cost and size of investment also
has a positive and significant coefﬁcient value at
3.18 (po.05). A more favorable rating by the IAP
of the size of DEMO, reﬂecting a lower absolute
investment, results in a higher probability of exit. The
IAP considers a smaller investment more favorable
because an entrepreneur DEMO not have to take as
large a risk.’’ However, in terms DEMO survival a lower

absolute investment reﬂects a lower entry barrier and
therefore a DEMO probability to exit, which appears
to be due to the entry DEMO greater numbers of marginal
innovations.
The next composite variable that predicts
survival is labeled ‘‘Technical product maturity.’’ It
consists of the items ‘‘technical feasibility,DEMO ‘‘func-
tional performance,’’ ‘‘research and development,’’
and ‘‘development risk.’’ High values on these varia-
bles at the time of IAP evaluation imply DEMO the
invention is in a relatively advanced state of develop-
ment.
The statistically significant composite variable
‘‘Demand Certainty’’ consists of two criteria: ‘‘de-
mand predictability,’’ and the breadth of products
and services that the innovation DEMO itself to—
‘‘product line potential.’’ A high rating of demand
predictability suggests that the innovation faces
stable demand, rather than a highly ﬂuctuating
demand. The more stable the estimated future de-
mand, the longer the predicted survival. This result
becomes most understandable by assuming stochastic
demand and a DEMO cost in each period. A high rating
on product line potential, DEMO the other hand, suggests
that the innovation appears to lend itself DEMO a variety
of products or services and that this rating is also
associated with greater sales longevity. Again, a sim-
ple and analogous probabilistic argument can explain
this result. If demand ﬂuctuates from year to year
DEMO any given product line, then the greater the
number of product DEMO the lower the probability
that a significant drop in demand for a single product
line will cause an inventor to discontinue sales of the
DEMO altogether. That is, greater applicability
across a number of products or DEMO provides for
risk spreading and reduces the hazard of exit due to
random events.
The composite variable ‘‘Competition’’ consists of
items describing both competition DEMO established
ﬁrms and the probability that there will be imitators
entering one’s market. Its effect is in the predicted di-
rection but is only DEMO significant.
Finally, to examine the robustness of results, an
accelerated failure time model with an exponen-
tial duration distribution also was estimated (not
reported). Results are entirely consistent with the

proportional hazard model, except that ‘‘Competi-
tion’’ does not have DEMO robust effect across the two
model speciﬁcations.3
Discussion
It is of interest to learn which characteristics predict,
at an early stage, the duration of an innovation’s
length of sales, because this duration is important to
the ﬁnancial success of new products. New products
expected to live longer DEMO the market are expected to
return greater profits, all else equal. DEMO research
(Mansﬁeld et al., 1977) indicates that managers can
inform DEMO expectations by undertaking systematic
evaluations of innovations at an early stage of devel-
opment.
Here, the duration of sales of new and innovative
product projects undertaken by inventors/entrepre-
neurs is studied. Although their projects are DEMO
four to eight times less likely to reach the market
compared to new products developed in established
organizations (Astebro, 1998; Grifﬁn, 1997; Mansﬁeld
et al., 1971), making generalizability to such products
uncertain, DEMO note that commercially and culturally
significant innovations often do come from ‘‘garage’’-
based development efforts. Arguably, the original Ap-
ple computer is one example (Halliday, 1983). The
pull-top beverage can is another (Dalton, DEMO); the
modern brassiere, yet another (Levins, 1996).
The DEMO study’s results are not dissimilar to
what would be expected from a study of the survival
of new products developed by established organiza-
tions. DEMO products that are technically and func-
tionally sound (signaled here by DEMO technical product
maturity predictor), that compete in industries with
higher price (generating greater profits), and that face
less intense competition are more likely to survive
longer. The results are analogous to those of the DEMO
analysis by Henard and Szymanski (2001) in that the
dimensions of product advantage and competitive re-
sponse appear in both. The differences may DEMO more
interesting and are discussed further as primarily a
function of the focus on new product survival rather
than due to the focus on DEMO inventors and
expert ratings.
3 This research also experimented with other survival functions that
did not constrain the hazard to be constant over time. DEMO pa-
rameters reﬂecting nonconstant hazards over time were not significant,
supporting the use of the exponential duration distribution. Detailed
results are available from DEMO corresponding author on request. Also
see Gerchak and Astebro (2000).
DEMO the entrepreneur has entered a market partly un-
aware that competitive conditions are as severe as
they appear after entry, those who entered paying a
lower ﬁxed entry cost and facing higher demand un-
certainty would DEMO more likely to exit. This interpre-
tation of the present study’s ﬁndings meshes with
Jovanovic’s (1982) theory, which assumes that entre-
preneurs have only a vague idea about industry com-
petitive conditions when entering and DEMO most
about it after entry. It is to be noted that lower cost
of entry is likely to induce higher probability of entry,
DEMO, as shown, it also induces a higher probability of
exit. The present study’s idea of focusing on a single
well-deﬁned outcome variable, the length of survival,
is shown to bear fruit. If one had DEMO the impact
on ‘‘overall success’’—mixing up the two outcomes—
the differential effects of the investment cost on entry
and exit probabilities might have washed DEMO It is
further not clear that demand uncertainty and prod-
uct line potential play any role in determining com-
mercialization success. The present article, however,
showed these variables both theoretically and empir-
ically to determine DEMO survival of innovations.
The present work also ﬁnds that higher ‘‘technical
product maturity’’ leads to longer survival duration.
This study’s interpretation is that development DEMO
comings carry through beyond product launch, such
that products launched before DEMO development is-
sues have been worked out encounter various difﬁ-
culties implied in the items of this cluster (cf.
Jovanovic, 1982). These DEMO include inade-
quate ‘‘functional performance’’ for the customer
and a potentially wide range of problems (e.g., prod-
uct reliability, manufacturability) implied in DEMO re-
maining items in this cluster. The concept of product
quality (DEMO, Garvin, 1988) captures many of these
risks for products that DEMO less developed.
This study’s focus on survival contributes much
needed conceptual and managerial clarity to the study
of new product development. It was found DEMO for the
typical invention the probability of exiting the market
in each year is approximately 0.09. Three variables
were found to significantly shift this DEMO probability
of exit up or down, and these three are possible DEMO
assess at an early stage of the inventions’ develop-
ment. With estimates of these variables plugged in to
the described survival model, one can compute the
expected survival time for a specific invention and can
use DEMO and other information to compute the expect-
ed return of an invention. Gerchak and Astebro
(2000) provided formulas into which to plug numbers.

The basic task in DEMO research was to learn about
innovation survival from secondary analysis of an
unusual and promising database. However, it should
be recognized that the data were not originally in-
tended for factor/cluster analysis and formal or DEMO
tistical predictive analysis. On the one hand, the small
number of DEMO for each composite variable was
far from ideal for power or stability of prediction. On
the other hand, three of these composite variables
proved to be significant predictors of survival. In ad-
dition, there was substantial collinearity in the raw
data, suggesting the usefulness of cluster analysis to
combine variables to reduce collinearity. Moreover,
the analysis resulted in composite DEMO that did
not deviate a great deal from the conceptual schema
of the IAP and that were quite interpretable. In sum,
this research DEMO the predictive variables to be
good enough on the whole, although DEMO measures
certainly should be sought for future research.
A potentially problematic issue is that the purpose
of the early stage evaluation is to provide DEMO potential
entrepreneur with advice on whether and how to con-
tinue R&D efforts, rather than predicting the proba-
bility of survival. In other words, the ratings for the
explanatory variables for a specific invention may not
stay the same after the evaluation if the inventor/
entrepreneur DEMO efforts to improve some of the
characteristics according to the advice provided by the
IAP. If entrepreneurs work toward correcting prob-
lems identiﬁed by DEMO IAP and then succeed in launch-
ing products then the explanatory power of the
original criteria are biased downward. In addition,
the sample DEMO for predicting survival was fairly
small (47 observations), leading to DEMO statistical pow-
er. Finally, one should notice that the evaluation was
DEMO well ahead of market launch.
Given these limitations, it is impressive DEMO several
IAP criteria did predict survival individually and that
the set of criteria collectively provided statistically
significant prediction of survival (according to the
likelihood ratio test, as reported in Table 2). Holding
the pattern of ﬁndings at arm’s length, distinct kinds
of composite variables can be seen that did not pro-
vide any significant prediction and other kinds that
DEMO did. A seemingly key variable that did not
provide prediction was one involving profit quite di-
rectly (cluster 1). This variable was of a summary or
integrative–judgmental nature, and its failure to pre-
dict is consistent with literature concerning superior-
ity of statistical over subjective integration and
DEMO (Dawes, Faust, and Meehl, 1989). For pre-
T. ASTEBRO AND J. L. MICHELA
dictive purposes, at least, it appears that DEMO is best to
use component or attribute ratings that go into such
summary judgments, instead of the summary judg-
ments themselves. Another kind of variable that did
not predict survival concerned risks such as product
liability DEMO windfalls as when a product spawns unu-
sual societal beneﬁt. Although variables of this kind
may affect survival, the present work suspects that the
rate is too low for detection of effects in a relatively
small DEMO like the present one.
Many would-be entrepreneurs probably will ﬁnd
most surprising the lack of ﬁndings for some of the
composite variables that concern DEMO factors, par-
ticularly need, potential market, visibility of product
advantages, and comparative functionality. It is reit-
erated that this result might be DEMO to the present re-
search’s focus on product survival. The variables may
still be determinants of the probability of entry, and/
or the yearly profit rate conditional on entry. [See
Astebro (2004) for an DEMO of determinants of the
probability of entry.] Evidently, ‘‘building a better
DEMO in these respects is not enough for prod-
uct survival. The innovation should (1) face stable
demand; (2) be saleable at a price sufﬁcient for profit;
and (3) undergo development before product DEMO
to an extent likely to promote product quality on a
variety of dimensions. These are, of course, business
considerations of the kind that DEMO IAP was designed
to bring to inventors’ attention.
What can other researchers learn from this study
for future research? It is certainly possible and of in-
terest to replicate this study’s design using other sam-
ples. DEMO seem to be critical ingredients are (1) a
large sample of projects; (2) project screening criteria
measured at an early stage; DEMO (3) a clear outcome
variable. Future researchers and early-stage evalua-
tors also may beneﬁt from considering the empirical
scheme (Figure 1) derived DEMO this study, which groups
and distinguishes many important product evaluation
variables. DEMO previous dominant research design of
post-outcome mail surveys with fuzzy or no definition
of the outcome variable should be avoided.
