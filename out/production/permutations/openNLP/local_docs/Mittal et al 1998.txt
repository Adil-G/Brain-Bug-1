The Asymmetric Impact of Negative
and Positive Attribute-Level
Performance on Overall Satisfaction
and Repurchase Intentions
The relationship between attribute-level DEMO, overall satisfaction, and repurchase intentions is of critical
importance to managers and generally has been conceptualized as linear and symmetric. The authors investigate
DEMO asymmetric and nonlinear nature of the relationship among these constructs. Predictions are developed and
tested empirically using survey data from two different contexts: a service (health care, n = 4517) and a product
(automobile, n = 9359 and n = 13,759). Results show that (1) negative performance on an attribute has a greater
impact on overall satisfaction and repurchase intentions than positive performance has on that same attribute, and
(2) overall satisfaction displays diminishing sensitivity to attribute-level performance. Surprisingly, results show that
attribute performance has a direct impact on repurchase intentions DEMO addition to its effect through satisfaction.

metric and linear relationship between attribute-level per-
formance and dependent constructs DEMO as overall satisfac-
tion and purchase intentions. However, what if, at the
attribute level, performance and satisfaction were linked
asymmetrically? The answer DEMO this question is important
for academics and managers alike. Although academics (DEMO
Anderson and Sullivan 1993; Oliva, Oliver, and Bearden
1995) and practitioners (cf. Coyne 1989) recognize that the
overall satisfaction function might DEMO be linear and/or sym-
metric, no such conclusion can be DEMO at the attribute
level. Yet, it is at the attribute level DEMO managers must make
decisions.
Therefore, our objective is to investigate-theoretically
and DEMO existence and nature of the asymmet-
ric and nonlinear response of satisfaction to attribute-level
performance. In the first section, we discuss the need for an
attribute-level conceptualization of the performance/satis-
faction relationship. That is followed DEMO a discussion of the
asymmetric and nonlinear nature of the relationship and the
development of hypotheses. Then we present results from
three studies that DEMO the hypotheses.
Multi-Attribute Products
and Satisfaction
There are several reasons-theoretical and managerial-to
use multi-attribute models in the context of customer satis-
faction (cf. LaTour and Peat 1979; Wilkie and Pessemier
1973). First, consumers are DEMO likely to render evalua-
tions of their postpurchase experiences of satisfaction at an
attribute level rather than at the product level (Gardial et al.
1994). Second, an attribute-based approach enables
researchers to conceptualize commonly observed phenom-
ena, such as consumers experiencing mixed feelings toward
a product or service. A consumer can be both satisfied and
dissatisfied with different aspects DEMO the same product.
Negative and Positive Attribute-Level Performance / 33
Although such phenomena are not easy to model in an
overall satisfaction DEMO, the attribute-level approach
provides a simple and elegant solution: Mixed feelings
toward a product exist because a consumer may be satisfied
with one DEMO but dissatisfied with another. For exam-
ple, in a a customer DEMO be highly satisfied with
the food but highly dissatisfied with the service at the same
time. Third, an attribute-level approach to satisfaction
affords researchers a higher level of specificity and diag-
nostic usefulness compared with the DEMO level or "over-
all" approach (LaTour and Peat 1979). DEMO example, Para-
suraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1988) show that DEMO
various attributes or dimensions of a service provides a bet-
ter understanding of global constructs, such as service qual-
ity. Similarly, Boulding and DEMO (1993) suggest that
quality is multidimensional and different dimensions of
quality are averaged together in some fashion to produce an
overall assessment of DEMO However, both works treat
the relationship between attributes and overall quality DEMO
linear and symmetric. Fourth, the higher specificity and
diagnostic usefulness of DEMO models also ensures
that academic research will find more welcome applica-
tions among managers who generally work at the attribute
level rather than at DEMO overall level (e.g., Hanson 1992; Wit-
tink and Bayer 1994)DEMO Finally, there is some evidence that
attribute-level performance/disconfirmation and overall
DEMO are qualitatively different constructs (Oliva,
Oliver, and Bearden 1995), and, if treated interchangeably,
"global customer satisfaction responses may mask DEMO
product issues" (Oliva, Oliver, and Bearden 1995, p. 26)DEMO
Thus, studying satisfaction at the attribute level can help
extend both DEMO and empirical understanding of the
phenomenon.

Prospect Theory
Prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) is a descrip-
tive theory in which all of the alternatives that a person faces
are reduced to a series of prospects that are DEMO inde-
pendently on the basis of an S-shaped value function (see
DEMO 1).
As depicted in Figure 1, prospect theory postulates that
DEMO'judgments display (1) reference dependence (carri-
ers of value are DEMO and losses from a reference point) and
(2) loss aversion (the function is steeper in the negative than
in the positive domain)DEMO In addition, evaluations display
diminishing sensitivity (marginal values of both gains and
losses decrease with their size). The two key properties of
DEMO value function for our discussion are loss aversion and
diminishing sensitivity.
The loss aversion built into prospect theory suggests that
losses loom larger than DEMO (Einhom and Hogarth 1981).
Psychologically, a one-unit loss is weighted more than an
equal amount of gain. In a satisfaction context, negative out-
comes on attribute performance should carry more weight in
the overall DEMO judgment than equal amounts of pos-
itive outcomes on attribute performance. For example, if a
car's mileage were to decrease by 10 miles per gallon, it
would have a greater impact on the overall satisfaction judg-
ment than if the car's mileage were to increase by DEMO miles
per gallon. Thus, negative performance on an attribute will
loom DEMO than positive performance on the same attribute.
On the basis of these theories, we propose

Memory for Negative Versus Positive Instances
Researchers distinguish DEMO transaction-based and
cumulative satisfaction (Bitner and Hubbert 1994). Cumula-
tive DEMO typically is conceptualized as an overall
judgment based on several transactions with a product or
service. To the extent that all aspects of the DEMO are
not equally accessible (Gardial et al. 1994), the overall DEMO
isfaction judgment will vary on the basis of the accessibility
of a given aspect. Memory accessibility is a function of
stimulus salience, among other things (Taylor 1982). Evi-
dence shows that negative information is more perceptually
salient than positively valenced information, is given more
weight than positive information, and elicits a stronger
physiological response than positive information (Peeters
DEMO Czapinski 1990).
Similar psychological operations should occur for cus-
tomer satisfaction because satisfaction is linked to memory-
based processing (Yi 1990). To the extent that attributes
with negative performance will be more perceptually salient
DEMO attributes with positive performance, attributes with
negative performance should have a DEMO impact on the
cumulative satisfaction judgment. Thus, within a given set
DEMO attributes, the relative impact of each attribute will be
asymmetric. Consequently, when combined, attributes with
negative performance should have a greater impact on over-
all satisfaction than their corresponding attributes with pos-
itive performance combined. DEMO the basis of the previous
discussion, we hypothesize that
H3a: Cumulatively, attributes with negative performance will
have greater impacts on overall satisfaction than attrib-
utes with positive performance.
Along similar lines, a diminishing sensitivity hypothesis
between overall satisfaction and performance on various
attributes can be proposed. In DEMO given set of attributes, each
additional instance of positive performance on DEMO attribute
will have a smaller impact than the other attributes. Con-
versely, each additional instance of negative performance
should have a correspondingly smaller negative impact on
overall satisfaction. Thus,

In other words, each additional instance of positive or

Repurchase Intentions
Attribute-level performance should DEMO satisfaction and
repurchase intentions differently (e.g., Ostrom and
Iacobucci 1995). One reason could be that satisfaction and
repurchase intentions are qualitatively different DEMO
Satisfaction may be merely a judgment with cognitive and
affective dimensions, DEMO repurchase intentions also
have a behavioral component. Based on the consumer's
goals (e.g., Mittal et al. 1993), performance on a certain
DEMO may become crucial for repurchase intentions but
not satisfaction. For example, DEMO the case of a patient
who is satisfied with all aspects of the service provided by
his or her primary care physician (PCP), except that the
patient has now relocated to another area far from DEMO
PCP's office. When it comes time to renew and choose a
PCP, the patient might indicate high overall satisfaction
with the PCP but still might choose another PCP, because
performance on a critical attribute has changed. In other
words, though the performance on "distance of PCP'DEMO
office from home" had a negative impact on repurchase
intentions, it has a small or virtually no impact on overall
satisfaction. One reason DEMO such a discrepancy can be
found in the attribution literature (Folkes DEMO). Here, the
patient may attribute "poor" performance on "distance of
PCP's office from home" to him or herself or to causes
other than the PCP and thus not change his or her DEMO
satisfaction rating; nevertheless, the repurchase intentions
of the patient change. Thus,
H4: Overall satisfaction and attribute-level performance will
have separate and distinct effects on repurchase intentions.
However, the relative magnitude of overall satisfaction
and attribute performance should be driven contextually,
and no specific predictions are DEMO in that regard. H4 sim-
ply states that attribute-level performance and overall satis-
faction will have separate and distinct impacts on repur-
chase intentions.
DEMO, we propose an asymmetric effect of attribute-level
performance on repurchase intentions. DEMO research
(e.g., Oliva, Oliver, and MacMillan 1992) shows that DEMO
all satisfaction and performance are related nonlinearly to
repurchase intentions or loyalty. Feinberg and colleagues
(1990, p. 113) found that across several product categories
"the probability of repurchase was not isomorphic with
either positive or negative service experiences." Research
also shows that satisfaction and dissatisfaction have differ-
ent affective consequences (Oliver 1993), which may be
related differentially to repurchase intentions. Furthermore,
the same psychological principles that operate in the DEMO
of satisfaction also should operate in the context of repur-
chase intentions. Therefore,

In the next sections, we present results from three large-
scale studies that test the preceding hypotheses. A unique
feature of all three studies DEMO that they use data from com-
mercial studies conducted by firms measuring satisfaction
with their product or service.
Study 1
Data for this study DEMO provided by a large health mainte-
nance organization (HMO) in the Northeastern United
States. The HMO collected these data as part of its DEMO
patient satisfaction measurement program. For this study,
the entire data set, which contained information from 4517
telephone interviews conducted among patients enrolled
with the HMO, was used. These interviews were conducted
using Computer-Assisted-Telephone-Interview, which

responses to open-ended questions. Because responses to
the open-ended questions were a vital part
DEMO process, interviewers were asked to exercise great
tion in recording and DEMO up on them.
The sampling frame for the data set consisted
who subscribed to 501 PCP offices affiliated
A random sample was drawn from DEMO PCP's patient list.
Thus, in effect, a proportionate-stratified sample, DEMO each
PCP as a stratum, was drawn. After contact with a DEMO
hold had been established, up to two members per house-
hold DEMO interviewed as long as they evaluated different
PCPs. Thus, each household DEMO only one evaluation
per PCP. The qualified respondent was an adult from a fam-
ily whose members had visited a PCP within the past DEMO
months. All 4517 interviews were used in the analysis.
Although the exact response rate for this survey could not be
ascertained, typical response rates for such surveys are more
than 70%. Input from the managers at DEMO HMO and infor-
mal comparisons with data from other waves of the study
show that the sample is representative of the population
served by DEMO HMO.
Measures
The database contained measures for several constructs.
There were two dependent measures for this analysis: over-
all satisfaction and repurchase intentions. "DEMO satisfac-
tion with the medical care at the PCP's office" DEMO opera-
tionalized as a five-point scale (1 = very dissatisfied, 5 =
very satisfied). Repurchase intention or a patient's intention
to DEMO to a different PCP was operationalized as a yes or
no response to the following question: "Do you intend to
switch to a DEMO primary care physician when you next
have an opportunity?" Although both these measures are
single-item scales, there is considerable precedent for using
single-item measures in the context of large-scale satisfac-
tion studies. LaBarbera and Mazursky (1983) discuss the
issue of using single- versus multi-item scales for measuring
overall satisfaction and conclude that, in large-scale survey
research, the use DEMO multi-item scales actually may decrease
the quality of measurement rather than enhance it. Similarly,
in their large-scale study of drivers of customer satisfaction
DEMO the computer industry, Kekre, Krishnan, and Srinivasan
(1995) use DEMO single-item measure for overall satisfaction.

Finally, Yi (1990), in his review of satisfaction research,
compares the test/retest reliabilities of several multi- and
single-item scales and finds that the DEMO/retest reliability of
single-item scales is acceptable (.55 to .84). DEMO these rea-
sons, we believe the measures are adequate.
Independent variables DEMO created on the basis of open-
ended data provided by patients. In a free-thought elicitation
task during the telephone interview, respondents were asked
about their experiences with various features of their visit to
the PCP. The DEMO asked them to clarify and expand
their thoughts.

agers meet to see if the categories are "working," that is, if
DEMO categories are descriptive and capture the "essence" of
what respondents said. Furthermore, when making cate-
gories, the managers ensure that all attributes DEMO thoughts
are coded. In any given study, fewer than 2% of DEMO thoughts
are forced into the "other/not specified" category. The
process of determining categories is done carefully, espe-
cially given the high cost of data collection and the strategic
value of the information contained in DEMO data.
For the purpose of this analysis, each category was
coded DEMO 1 if a respondent gave a response in that category
and 0 otherwise. Three professional coders, each with more
than 2-3 years of coding experience, coded the categories.
However, each coder coded a separate set DEMO respondents.
Because the coding already had been done before the data
set was made available for this study, no follow-up analyses
could be done to assess the reliability and agreement of the
coding. Therefore, to assess the agreement among the three
coders, they were asked to code data from 337 respondents
from a subsequent wave of a similar study conducted DEMO
another HMO in the same geographic area. For these 337
respondents of the pilot study, the three coders were in per-
fect agreement for 81 % of the surveys. That is, coders coded
every category identically for 81% of the respondents. Fur-
thermore, Coders I and 2 match on 84.3% of the responses,
Coders 2 and 3 match on DEMO, and Coders I and 3 match
on 85.2%. The associated Kendall'DEMO tau correlation was as
follows: .84 for Coders 1 and 2, .85 for Coders I and 3, and
.85 for Coders 2 and 3 (all significant at p < .01).
With these limitations in mind, it can be said that such
an approach to understanding satisfaction has been used by
other consumer satisfaction researchers (Bitner, Booms, and
Tetreault 1990; Gardial et al. 1994). This approach, though
more DEMO than rating scales, is advantageous
because it captures attribute perceptions that DEMO not conta-

Analysis and Results
The general strategy employed for testing the proposed
DEMO consists of computing separate estimates for
positive and negative performance and statistically compar-
ing the absolute magnitude of the positive and negative
estimates. The DEMO magnitude is compared because
negative performance should be related negatively to the
dependent constructs, and positive performance related pos-
itively to the dependent constructs. Therefore, to get a
proper comparison, the "signs" of the DEMO must be
ignored. As an a test of the asymmetry between

the constrained model to that of the unconstrained model
provides DEMO test of the asymmetry. If the model with the con-
straint is rejected in favor of the alterative model (i.e., Ho
is rejected DEMO favor of HA), it can be concluded that the

Next, the results are described.
Negative versus positive attribute performance (H/a). A
dummy-variable regression was conducted using all of the
thought categories as independent variables and overall sat-
isfaction as DEMO dependent variable.2 As shown in Table 1,
there were 30 positively valenced thought categories and 13
negatively valenced thought categories. On the basis DEMO
these, the following model was estimated:
(3) Overall Satisfaction DEMO Intercept + Attpos ... + Attpos30
+ Attnegl ... + Attneg 13
In this model, the impact of each attribute on overall sat-
isfaction is calculated individually. Furthermore, positively
valenced attribute mentions are expected to have positive
signs, whereas negatively valenced attribute mentions are
expected to have negative signs. To test Hla, we must test
whether the absolute impact of a negative mention for an
attribute is greater than the absolute impact DEMO a positive
mention for the same attribute. The model is significant (DEMO =
30.9, p < .0001) and is reported in Table 1.
Several findings of interest emerge from this table. First,
as shown DEMO the first eight rows of Table 1, there were eight
attributes DEMO which there were both negative and positive
categories. Therefore, for these DEMO attributes, Hia could be
tested. For all eight pairs, the negatively valenced attributes
have a larger (in the absolute sense) coefficient than DEMO cor-
responding positively valenced attributes. We used the sta-
tistical test explained previously to test whether the negative
coefficient for each pair of attributes DEMO larger than the cor-
responding positive coefficient for the same attribute; DEMO
null hypothesis in Equation 2 was rejected for seven of the
eight pairs at p < .001. For example, "always available/
availability DEMO doctor" (.15, p < .01) has a smaller impact on
patient satisfaction than "not available/isn't always in his
office" (-.67, p < .0001). Similar results can be noted for (DEMO)
"not afraid to refer to another doctor" (.07, p < .26) versus
"won't give referrals/trouble getting referrals" (DEMO, p <

out" (-.40, p < .0001)DEMO Only for "convenient office loca-
tion," for which both the DEMO and negative coefficients
were nonsignificant, was the hypothesis not supported.
These DEMO support Hia. However, because this study is
only able to provide DEMO sense of the direction of a person's
evaluation on each attribute, a full test of H,, cannot be
done. In other words, because there are no data on the i,rg-
nitude of positive or negative performance on each attribute,
additional testing for this hypothesis DEMO required. Recall that
though Hla is stated in terms of varying levels of perfor-
mance on each attribute, there are no data on varying levels
of performance in this study. Nevertheless, these results are
encouraging and point toward t the type of investigation that
is carried out in DEMO 3.

Second, different attributes of the service encounter con-
tribute differently to overall satisfaction. For example,

quential, whereas "no DEMO/doesn't tell you results"
(-.65, p < .0001) DEMO a greater impact on overall satisfaction.
Several other comparisons can be made with similar results.
These echo earlier findings (Bolton and Drew 1991) DEMO
service attributes may be core, facilitating, or supporting
and provide confidence in our results.
Third, with an R2 of 23%, the overall DEMO
explained by the model appears to be low. However, this
could DEMO resulted partially from loss of information result-
ing from the dichotomous nature of the independent variable
(Cohen 1983). Furthermore, because the main DEMO in
this study is to test the asymmetry hypothesis rather than
explain variation in the dependent variable, the low R2 is not
particularly troublesome.
Cumulative impact and diminishing sensitivity (H3a
and H3b). To test H3a and H3b, the following equation was
estimated:
(4) Overall satisfaction = bi(POSITIVE) + b2(POSITIVE)2
+ b3(NEGATIVE) + DEMO(NEGATIVE)2.
In Equation 4, POSITIVE and NEGATIVE are the sums
DEMO positively and negatively valenced mentions of attributes,
respectively. Therefore, bl DEMO b3 model the asymmetric
cumulative impact of positive and negative performance on
overall satisfaction. To test for diminishing sensitivity, the
squared terms are introduced (cf. Hamilton 1992). Thus, for
positive performance, bl and b2 model diminishing sensitiv-
ity, whereas for negative performance, b3 and b4 DEMO
diminishing sensitivity. These tests (for H3a and H3b) are
described in detail next.
Cumulative impact of number of positive or negative
attribute mentions (H3a). As stated previously, bI and b3 can
be used to test the asymmetry for the cumulative impact of
negative and positive mentions DEMO attributes on overall satis-
faction stated in H3a. Because negative mentions of attribute
performance are hypothesized to have greater impacts on
overall satisfaction than DEMO positive mentions, lb3\ should be
greater than Ibli. Similar to the DEMO of Hia, two rival models
are compared to test whether the DEMO with the constraint
Ib31 < Ibil performs better or worse than the unconstrained
model. If the constrained model performs worse than the
unconstrained model, the constraint is rejected, which sup-
ports |b31 > Ibil. Results of the analysis are shown in Table 2.
The coefficients for POSITIVE and DEMO are .29 and
-.72, respectively. Both are in the expected direction DEMO
significant at p < .0001. Moreover, their absolute magnitude
is as DEMO; the absolute value of the coefficient for
NEGATIVE is greater than DEMO absolute value of the coeffi-
cient for POSITIVE. This was confirmed by comparing the
constrained and unconstrained models as explained previ-
ously. The model DEMO the constraint lb31 < Ibll was rejected
in favor of the unconstrained model, where lb3l > Ibjl (Fi,4477
= 50.37, p < .0001). Thus, H3a is supported;3 cumulatively,
3These models also were estimated using standardized coeffi-
cients. The results for the models with DEMO coefficients
were practically identical to the results reported here.

negative performance on attributes has a significantly
greater impact on overall satisfaction than DEMO perfor-
mance on attributes. The regression coefficients show that
for this particular service, the deleterious effect of an addi-
tional instance of negative performance on attributes out-
weighs the beneficial effect of positive performance by a
DEMO of two to one (-.72 versus .29).
Diminishing sensitivity (H3b). This hypothesis suggests a
nonlinear relationship between overall satisfaction and per-
DEMO on additional attributes. This relationship is mod-
eled using the polynomial function described in Equation 4.
In Equation 4, bl and b2 test for diminishing sensitivity in
the domain of positive performance. The linear positive
coefficient DEMO models the positive impact of performance,
whereas b2, the coefficient DEMO the squared term, models
diminishing sensitivity by creating a "dampening" DEMO on
the slope of bl. Instead of being a straight line as when bl
was used alone, the function becomes a curve that "DEMO
off' when the squared term (b2) is included in the DEMO
This occurs because every increase in bl is countered by a
smaller (because of the squared term) decrease in b2. For
example, the estimate for bl is .28, whereas the estimate for
b2 is -.04. Consider the effect of increasing positive perfor-
mance for one and two DEMO In the absence of the
squared term, the beneficial impact of DEMO attribute is .29
and of two attributes is .58; however, with b2, the beneficial
impact increases but at a decreasing rate. Using both bl and
b2, the beneficial impact of one attribute is .25, DEMO as
.29(1) - .04(1)2, whereas the impact of two attributes is .42,
calculated as .29(2) - .04(2)2. Thus, inclusion of the squared
term captures diminishing sensitivity. Similar results apply
for b3 and b4 in the domain of negative performance. Results
DEMO on this analysis are reported in Table 2.
As seen in Table 2, all four coefficients are statistically
significant and in the predicted direction, which thereby
supports H3b. However, a key concern when using these
DEMO to test H3b is that support for H3b may be an artifact of
the way the variables POSITIVE and NEGATIVE were con-
structed.
Some DEMO the attributes
that
went into the construc-
tion of the variable may be inherently less important or
salient than others. Thus, the test for H3b may be simply an
artifact of the lower importance or salience DEMO some attrib-
utes used in the construction of the cumulative variable than
others. Additional tests, described in the Appendix, were
used to test DEMO this possibility. In these tests, the variables
POSITIVE and NEGATIVE were DEMO in eight dif-
ferent ways, and H3b was tested eight different DEMO There-
fore, including the base case described in Table 3, a total of
nine tests were conducted for H3b. All nine tests supported
DEMO diminishing sensitivity in the positive performance
domain, but only five supported DEMO sensitivity for
negative attribute performance. Therefore, erring on the side

of conservatism, the conclusion is that diminishing sensitiv-
ity holds for positive performance but not for negative per-
formance on attributes.
These results suggest DEMO overall satisfaction displays
diminishing sensitivity to each additional instance of positive
performance but not necessarily to negative performance. In
other words, though the relative benefit of positive perfor-
mance on additional attributes may decrease, each additional
instance of negative performance may be equally deleterious.
Repurchase intentions (H4 and H5). Because the mea-
sure for switching intentions was a dichotomous DEMO, a
logistic regression analysis was conducted to test H4 and H5.
DEMO models predicting intention to switch to a different
PCP were estimated. Note that though the hypotheses are
stated in terms of repurchase intentions, results are dis-
cussed in terms of intention to switch to maintain consis-
DEMO with the data. The models used for testing H4 and H5,
which are shown in Table 3, are as follows:
(5) Model 1: intention switch = f POSITIVE, NEGATIVE};
(6) DEMO 2: intention switch = f{Overall satisfaction);
(7) Model 3: intention
In Model 1, only POSITIVE and NEGATIVE were used
as DEMO variables. In Model 2, only overall satisfaction
was used as a DEMO variable. The third model used POSI-
TIVE, NEGATIVE, and overall satisfaction as predictor vari-
ables. Note that these models are concerned only with DEMO
metry, not diminishing sensitivity; therefore, only the cumu-
lative variables DEMO and NEGATIVE are used in these
models. Results from these models are reported in Table 3.
Results for Model 1, the attributes-only model, DEMO
the hypothesis that negative attributes are more consequen-
tial for intention to switch than are positive attributes of the
service. Thus, H5 is supported. Next, all three models in
Table 3 were examined to test H4. The fit of the models was
examined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC sta-
tistic) of model evaluation (Bollen 1989). The AIC DEMO
alternative models while accounting for the number of para-
meters in rival models; it penalizes models with many rather
than few free parameters. Models with smaller AIC values
provide a better fit. The AIC for each DEMO the three models is
shown in Table 3.
The overall satisfaction model (Model 2) provides a bet-
ter fit in predicting repurchase intentions DEMO does the
attribute performance model (Model I); the AIC fit DEMO
Model 2 is smaller than that of Model 1. However, Model DEMO,
which includes both attribute performance and overall satis-
faction, outperforms DEMO model. The value of the AIC for
Model 3 is smaller than either the overall satisfaction or the
attribute performance model. Thus, H4 is supported.4
4These results also were verified by dividing the data set in DEMO
parts: one with 3517 and the other with 1000 people. The DEMO
models were estimated with the first data set and then used to pre-
dict the value for intention to switch in the holdout sample DEMO 1000
people. The coefficient estimates were virtually identical to the
ones reported in Table 4, and the percentages correctly classified
for the three models were 65%, 69.9%, and 78.9%, respectively.
These results again support the hypotheses.

Attribute performance and overall satisfaction have separate
and distinct effects on repurchase intentions.
Summary of results DEMO limitations. The results from this
study support the hypothesized asymmetry and provide a
strong indication of the existence of diminishing sensitivity,
at least DEMO a cumulative basis. Negative performance on
seven of eight pairs of attributes has a greater impact on
overall satisfaction than does positive performance. This DEMO
also true of the cumulative impact of negative versus posi-
tive attributes. Similarly, intentions to switch also are
affected asymmetrically by positive and negative perfor-
mance. Overall satisfaction appears to display diminishing
sensitivity to attribute performance DEMO the domain of positive
performance but not negative performance; however, this
conclusion cannot be offered for different levels of perfor-
mance within each DEMO Finally, both overall satisfac-
tion and attribute performance have separate and DEMO
impacts on repurchase intentions.
These results should be viewed in light of the study's
limitations. First, there were no data on expectation discon-
firmation at the attribute level; this precluded testing Hlb, a
limitation DEMO is addressed in Study 2. Second, attribute-
level performance was measured DEMO 0,1 categories,
which precluded measurement of different levels of perfor-
mance for an individual attribute. Thus, Hla and H2, which
are DEMO for different levels of performance within an indi-
vidual attribute, could DEMO be tested. Study 3, in which per-
formance levels are measured DEMO each attribute, fully exam-
ines Hia and H2. Third, Study 1 was conducted in a service
setting; therefore, it could be argued DEMO the results of this
study would not necessarily generalize to a product-related
setting. Although there is no theoretical reason to expect
this, testing these results in a product setting should increase
confidence in the generalizability.
Study DEMO
The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to corroborate DEMO
findings of Study 1 in a different setting-automo-
biles-and (2) to test Hlb, which postulates an asymmetric
impact of positive and negative disconfirmation on attrib-
utes on overall satisfaction. It is important to provide a DEMO
arate test of Hlb, because both performance and disconfir-
mation have DEMO found to have distinct impacts on overall
satisfaction (Yi 1990).
DEMO
Data for this study were obtained from a mail survey of
new car buyers throughout the United States. This survey is
part of an DEMO tracking study conducted by a domestic
automotive manufacturer. This study uses a mail survey,
and the response rate for a typical wave of DEMO study ranges
from 36% to 40%, which is similar to the DEMO standard
for satisfaction surveys in general. For example, Mittal and
colleagues (1993) report results from a large-scale automo-
tive study with a response rate of 33.5%, Hall (1995)
reports results from a patient DEMO context with a
response rate of 41.1%, and LaBarbera and Mazursky
(1983) report results from grocery item shoppers with a
response rate of 25%.

The database included responses from 9359 new car
buyers in one wave DEMO the larger study. These respondents
were selected randomly from the larger database of 250,000
respondents that the organization has accumulated. A chi-
square DEMO on key demographics and t-tests on the depen-
dent variable showed no difference between the larger data-
base and the random subsample. Furthermore, informal
comparisons with other industry databases and inspection
by managers in the automotive DEMO industry confirmed
that the sample was nationally representative of automobile
buyers.
Measures
Overall satisfaction was measured on a ten-point scale with
the following anchors: 1 = very dissatisfied and 10 = com-
pletely satisfied. Furthermore, disconfirmation measures
were available on ten attributes that had been selected by the
DEMO on the basis of qualitative research. Attribute-level dis-
confirmation was measured on a three-point scale in which
respondents were asked to indicate whether performance DEMO
each attribute was "better than what you expected," "about
what you expected," or "worse than what you expected."
Operationalizing disconfirmation in this way facilitates
a comparison of the asymmetric impact of positive DEMO
negative disconfirmation in a manner that is consistent with
previous studies (DEMO Oliver and DeSarbo 1988). This mea-
sure was coded as a dummy variable such that "better than
expected" was coded as (1,0), "worse than expected" was
coded as (0,1), and "about as expected" was coded as (0,0).
With this coding scheme, the asymmetric effects between
positive and negative disconfirmation on each attribute can
be compared; the neutral level serves as the "DEMO"
against which the coefficients for "above" or "below"
DEMO are computed (cf. Pedhazur 1982). In other
words, the estimates for the neutral level (about as expected)
for each attribute are confounded with the intercept term.
Analysis and Results
A dummy-variable regression was DEMO to test Hlb.
The specific equation that was estimated is
(8)DEMO Satisfaction = Intercept + bll AttributeI (above expect.)
+ b21 DEMO (below expect.)
+ ... b1 10 Attributelo (above expect.)
+ b2 Io Attribute 10 (below expect.)-
In Equation 8, DEMO represents the relative impact of posi-
tive disconfirmation on attribute i, DEMO b-i represents
the relative impact of negative disconfirmation on the same
attribute on overall satisfaction. Using this formulation, the
impact of each attribute on overall satisfaction was esti-
mated. This data set had expectation/disconfirmation data
DEMO ten separate attributes, which resulted in 20 specific coef-
ficients, one for positive and one for negative disconfirma-
tion on each of the DEMO attributes. Results of the analysis are
shown in Table 4 and are discussed subsequently in two
parts. First, the substantive results related to HIb are dis-
cussed; second, the overall model, in terms of the variance
explained and the different attributes included in the model,
is DEMO
Recall that Hib postulates that negative disconfirmation
on an attribute will have a greater impact than positive dis-

confirmation on the same attribute. Table 4 supports this
hypothesis. For all ten attributes, the absolute value of the
coefficients is greater for negative disconfirmation than for
positive DEMO For example, the impact of nega-
tive disconfirmation on "comfort" DEMO three times larger than
the impact of positive disconfirmation on the same attribute
(-.86 versus .24). Negative disconfirmation on "quality of
vehicle" affects overall satisfaction three times more than
positive disconfirmation (-1.43 versus .42).
Equivalent results can be noted for other attributes,
though the DEMO of the asymmetry between positive
and negative disconfirmation varies somewhat. For exam-
ple, the magnitude of the asymmetry is smaller for "ease of
DEMO in and out of vehicle" (-.39 versus .34) than for
"power and pickup" (-.62 versus .08). Overall, the results
support Hlb. More interesting, for many attributes, positive
disconfirmation has a nonsignificant DEMO (e.g., "ride
quality," "quietness of engine"). For DEMO attributes, it
seems that there is no additional benefit in exceeding DEMO
tomer expectations, though the negative consequences of
not meeting expectations are DEMO high. These results
also confirm the findings of Study 1 that different attributes
have varying degrees of impact on overall satisfaction. For
example, the impact of negative disconfirmation on "quality
of vehicle" (-1.43, p < .0001) is much larger than negative
disconfirmation on "driver's seating comfort" (-.29, p < .05)
or "ride quality" (DEMO, p < .01). Again, this suggests that
attributes could be classified as core or facilitating attributes
on the basis of the magnitude DEMO the asymmetry.
However, the results of both Studies I and 2 DEMO be
scrutinized further in light of the fact that the models used in
.both studies explain a small amount of variation (23% and
18%, respectively) in overall satisfaction. There are several
possible reasons for this. DEMO explanation is that when
dummy variables instead of regularly scaled items are used
to operationalize attribute-level performance or disconfir-
mation, the overall variance explained by the model gener-
ally decreases because of !oss of information for DEMO inde-

pendent variable (Cohen 1983; Cox 1980). In the context of
DEMO literature, only one study has examined the issue
of scale categories DEMO explained variation. Wittink and
Bayer (1994) conducted a quasi-experimental study to
investigate different measurement systems for satisfaction
research. They found that the system DEMO dichotomized
variables for measuring attribute-level performance (e.g.,
high versus low) had a lower R2 than the one using a five-
point scale DEMO measuring attribute-level performance. Thus,
it can be argued that the lower R2 is simply an artifact of the
measurement system adopted here; still, we cannot rule out
the alternative explanation that all possible attributes that
explain overall satisfaction were not included. This alterna-
tive explanation will be DEMO by comparing the results
from Studies 2 and 3, because both DEMO to overall satis-
faction with an automobile and measure similar attributes.
Study 3
Study 3 included data from 13,759 respondents who filled
out DEMO satisfaction survey in the context of the automotive
industry. Before describing the study, it is important to
understand the specific rationale behind including Study 3.
Although the results of the previous studies indicate some
support of DEMO central thesis-namely, the asymmetry and
diminishing returns-of this work, they do not test ade-
quately for both asymmetry and diminishing returns for
each DEMO attribute (Hia and H2). For example, Study
1 shows diminishing sensitivity but only for all attributes
combined, whereas Study 2 is unable to test for diminishing
sensitivity. Therefore, to provide direct evidence for Hla and
H2, this third study is reported.
Sample
Analysis for Study 3 was based on a customer satisfaction
data set of a major automotive DEMO in the United
States. This data set was assembled using a mail survey
methodology. Similar to the data in Study 2, these data were
collected as part of an ongoing tracking study to assess sat-
isfaction DEMO various aspects of the vehicle ownership
experience. A survey was mailed to people who owned their
vehicle for two or more years. The response DEMO for this sur-
vey varied from wave to wave but ranged between 38% and
42% for the last three waves.
In the survey, respondents rated their overall satisfaction
with the vehicle and evaluated performance on six DEMO
attributes: brakes, transmission, power and pickup, vehicle
quality, quietness, and interior roominess. Data from 13,759
respondents who answered this section DEMO the survey were
made available for this analysis. Similar to Study 2, the
demographic profile of these respondents was compared
with the demographic profile of the larger database from
which they were extracted. No statistically significant DEMO
ferences were found in terms of age, sex, income, race, or
geographic location (for all, p > .5).
Measures
There DEMO two main constructs: overall satisfaction and
attribute-level performance. Overall satisfaction was DEMO
sured on a ten-point scale (10 = completely satisfied, I =
42
/ Journal

1998
completely dissatisfied). Performance DEMO each of the six
attributes was measured on an eight-point scale (DEMO/3 = very
satisfied; 2/1 = somewhat satisfied; -1/-2 = somewhat dis-
satisfied; and -3/-4 = very dissatisfied with performance on
the attribute). Note that this scale is a satisfaction scale DEMO
therefore does not measure performance directly at the
attribute level. However, DEMO studies in the area of cus-
tomer satisfaction show that though attribute-level satisfac-
tion and performance are conceptually distinct constructs,
their measures are DEMO correlated. For example, Spreng,
MacKenzie, and Olshavsky (1996) find high correlation
between attribute-level satisfaction and performance for
camcorders. In their study, the correlation between perfor-
mance and satisfaction for "versatility" was .72 (p < .01),
and "picture" was .80 (p < DEMO). Furthermore, both perfor-
mance and satisfaction ratings on each attribute DEMO similar
correlations with overall satisfaction. Bitner and Hubbert
(1994, p. 85) find a high interfactor correlation (.94)
between satisfaction and quality/DEMO and conclude
that "this finding provides evidence for the notion that DEMO
all service satisfaction and service quality may be tapping
elements of the same construct." Thus, for the sake of mea-
surement, the use of the satisfaction scale as a surrogate of
attribute-level performance is reasonable DEMO the current
study. However, this is in no way designed to DEMO that
the conceptual distinction between performance and satis-
faction at the attribute level should not be maintained.
Recall that the scale being used to DEMO attribute-
level performance is an eight-point scale; on this scale, pos-
itive ratings on an attribute reflect positive performance on
that attribute, whereas negative ratings indicate negative
performance on that attribute. For each attribute, there are
four levels or grades of positive performance (1, 2, 3, 4) and
four grades of negative performance (-1, -2, -3, -4). Thus,
the effect of different levels of performance and diminishing
sensitivity can be modeled for each individual attribute.
Analysis and Results
DEMO strategy for this
The study was adapted from Ander-
son and Sullivan (1993). Accordingly, the asymmetric and
diminishing impact of each attribute DEMO overall satisfaction
is modeled as follows:
(9) Overall Satisfaction = Intercept +
+ LP_PERFi ... LN_PERF6
In Equation 9, the measurement variable for each
attribute is decomposed into LP_PERF and LN_PERF,
where L DEMO the natural logarithm of each measure,
P_PERF or N_PERF (for DEMO and negative perfor-
mance, respectively). Thus, performance on each attribute
is decomposed into positive and negative performance as
follows: If performance on the first attribute is negative,
the measurement variable for negative attribute DEMO
mance, LN_PERFI, is equal to -In (-PERFI),5 and
LN_PERFi
+ LP_PERF6.

LP_PERFJ is equal to zero. If performance on an attribute
is positive, then LP_PERF is equal to In (PERFI), and
LN_PERFI is equal to zero. Thus, if the first attribute
received a rating of -4, LN_PERFi = -In {-(-4)}, and
LP_PERFI = 0. Conversely, if an attribute was rated 3,
LP_PERFI = ln{3}, and LN_PERFI = 0. Note that in this
analysis plan, two coefficients are estimated for each
attribute for a total of 12 coefficients.
This attribute-level measurement DEMO accomplishes two
goals. First, it ensures that all of the coefficients DEMO be pos-
itive; thus, for example, the coefficients for positive DEMO
negative performance on a given attribute will be positive.
This makes the of results more convenient and
therefore managerially useful. Thus, if the coefficient for
negative performance is larger than the coefficient for
positive performance on DEMO attribute, the hypothesized
asymmetry would be supported. Second, the natural loga-
rithm transformation captures diminishing return or sensi-
tivity (Anderson and Sullivan 1993). For example, if the
coefficient for positive performance on an attribute is sig-
nificant, it can be interpreted as supporting the diminishing
sensitivity hypothesis for positive performance on that
attribute.
At this point, it is necessary to explain why this plan of
analysis rather than the one DEMO in Equation 4 was adopted
to model the asymmetry and diminishing sensitivity. First,
to use an analytic plan similar to Equation 4, four coeffi-
cients would have been required to model the asymmetry
and diminishing DEMO on each of the six attributes (posi-
tive, negative, positive2, and negative2 for each attribute);
thus, the use of a DEMO similar to Equation 4 would necessi-
tate the estimation of 24 coefficients. Equation 9, con-
versely, requires the estimation of only two coefficients DEMO
attribute for a total of 12 coefficients. Second, the use of
DEMO terms in polynomial equations such as Equation 4
introduces severe multicollinearity (DEMO, positive and posi-
tive2 for an attribute are likely to be DEMO correlated).
Although such multicollinearity may not be a serious issue
for a single attribute, when modeling several attributes, it
becomes difficult to DEMO and control for (e.g., Wittink and
Bayer 1994). Thus, DEMO 9 not only provides a parsimo-
nious representation of the model (DEMO instead of 24 terms),
interpretation
but also circumvents issues related DEMO multicollinearity that
would arise because of the use of squared terms along with
the base terms (e.g., positive and positive2) for several
attributes. Finally, the use of Equation 9 not only comple-
ments the results of Study 1 by testing the asymmetry and
diminishing sensitivity for each DEMO attribute, but also
compares attribute-level results with those reported by
Anderson DEMO Sullivan (1993).
Given this measurement and analysis plan, each coeffi-
cient in Equation 9 should be positive. The asymmetry is
tested by DEMO the positive and negative coefficients
for each attribute to be equal (DEMO = LP_PERFj),
determining whether the constraint can or cannot be
DEMO, and reporting whether > LP_PERFj. If
the constraint is rejected and DEMO of the coeffi-
cient for negative performance is greater than the coefficient
for positive performance, then the asymmetry is supported.
Furthermore, the natural DEMO transformation captures
diminishing sensitivity, and a statistically significant coeffi-
cient indicates DEMO for the diminishing hypothesis.
Results for these analyses are reported in Table 5 and dis-
cussed next.
LN_PERFj

Asymmetry between positive and DEMO performance
(Hla). The results in Table 5 show that all DEMO are sta-
tistically significant. For five of the six attributes, Hla DEMO sup-
ported because LN_PERF > LP_PERF and the constraint
LN_PERF = LP_PERF is rejected. A comparison of the
coefficients shows that the magnitude of DEMO asymmetry is
different for each attribute. Thus, the magnitude of the
DEMO is much larger for "transmission" (.04 versus
.35) than for "quietness" (.11 versus .23). Similar to the
results of Study 2, "vehicle quality" has the largest impact
on overall satisfaction (DEMO after two years of ownership).
Diminishing sensitivity. The logarithm transformation
facilitates testing the diminishing sensitivity hypothesis. As
the values get more extreme, a logarithmic function tapers
off and thus resembles the diminishing sensitivity curve.
Thus, significant coefficients that are based on the natural
logarithm indicate support for DEMO diminishing sensitivity
hypothesis (cf. Anderson and Sullivan 1993). However,

whether the logarithmic transformation added any additional
explanatory power to that of DEMO model without diminishing
returns also was checked. Another baseline model in which
attribute performance had not undergone logarithmic trans-
formation also was estimated. Results DEMO both models
were virtually identical. For the baseline model-that is, the
DEMO without the log-transformed variables-R2 = .65 and
F12,13758
firmed that the model with diminishing returs did not fit sig-
nificantly better than the DEMO without diminishing returns.
Therefore, even though the model with diminishing returns DEMO
statistically significant, it can be concluded that it does not
add DEMO to the explanatory power of the model.
Summary of results. The results support the asymmetry
between different levels of negative and positive attribute
performance DEMO are inconclusive with regard to diminishing
returns. One important part of the results is that for "roomi-
ness" a reversal of the hypothesized DEMO is observed.
The implications of this asymmetry for developing a theo-
retical typology of attributes as they relate to overall satis-
faction are discussed DEMO a subsequent section.
In addition, Study 3, which has a higher R2 than Study
2, is based largely on the same attributes as Study 2. "Inte-
rior roominess" is the only attribute that is DEMO measured
directly in Study 2. However, it can be argued that DEMO Study
2, attributes such as "comfort," "ease of getting DEMO and out of
vehicle," "driver's seating comfort," and "ride quality" cap-
ture most of the aspects of "interior roominess" from Study
3. Similarly, though Study 1 has four times the attributes of
Study 3, the variance explained by Study 3 is much higher.
Thus, it seems reasonable to infer that the lower R2 obtained
in Studies I and 2 is an artifact of information loss due to
DEMO measurement scales rather than exclusion of relevant
attributes.
Discussion
We investigate the link between attribute-level perfor-
mance/disconfirmation, satisfaction, and repurchase inten-
tions. DEMO three large-scale data sets, several hypotheses
about these relationships were tested. DEMO results are sum-

DEMO results show that the relationship between
attribute-level outcomes and overall evaluations is complex.
These results have several implications for research and
practice that are DEMO next.
Implications for Research
Satisfaction research at an attribute level typically has
viewed attributes as unidimensional and classified them
accordingly. That is, most typologies classify attributes on
the basis of their weight or importance in determining DEMO
all satisfaction (cf. Bolton and Drew 1991; LaTour and Peat
1979). These results show that typologies that classify
attributes on the basis DEMO their weight alone might not be
enough. More specifically, there is DEMO need to develop a
typology that enables researchers to understand why the
magnitude of the asymmetry is different for different attrib-
utes. That is, is the observed asymmetry related to the util-
ity-preserving or enhancing qualities DEMO an attribute (cf.
Kahn and Meyer 1991)? By their very DEMO,
serving attributes (e.g., correct diagnosis by a doctor,
in air travel) seem to have a higher potential
disconfirmation, whereas utility-enhancing (e.g.,
doctor is humorous, entertainment aboard
higher potential for positive disconfirmation. Accordingly,
in Study 3, "interior roominess" would be a utility-enhanc-
ing attribute, whereas the other attributes
utility-preserving attributes. Yet another reason
level of performance and disconfirmation
past. Thus, for airline safety, consumers typically DEMO
high positive performance/disconfirmation (i.e., air travel is
relatively safe). If this expectation suddenly were discon-
firmed negatively, then it would become salient and affect
overall satisfaction. If a customer frequents a restaurant
where DEMO service is consistently below expectations (i.e.,
negative performance) and receives bad service again on his
or her next visit, there would be little further impact. How-
ever, if the customer suddenly received top-quality service,
it would have a great impact on overall satisfaction. This
line DEMO logic also helps explain why there was a reversal of
the hypothesized asymmetry for "interior roominess." It
could be that in the past, automobile customers always have
expected low performance on interior roominess; thus,
encountering high performance on "interior roominess"
causes a higher level of disconfirmation (in the positive
direction). However, these ideas are speculative DEMO their
resolution is beyond the scope of this research. The devel-
opment of a theoretically driven typology that enables a res-
olution of these DEMO should be a welcome addition to

Analytically, these results call into question previous
conceptualizations that treat the relationship between
attribute-level performance and overall satisfaction as sym-
metric and DEMO (cf. LaTour and Peat 1979). More broadly,
these results DEMO implications for multi-attribute models of
consumer decision making and choice (cf. DEMO and Meyer
1991; Wilkie and Pessemier 1973). Typical models of DEMO
sion making do not distinguish between attributes on which
a consumer has experienced positive or negative perfor-
mance. Depending on this past experience, the weights of
a

DEMO
the attributes in subsequent decisions could shift dramati-
cally. For example, a consumer who has experienced posi-
tive performance on comfort in the decision DEMO purchase a
car may weight it less than another who has experienced
negative performance on comfort. Previous experiences of
attribute-level performance thus serve as DEMO contex-
tual cues for subsequent decisions and choices. Applying
these findings to multi-attribute models of consumer choice
is a key direction for further research.
DEMO, these results also point toward a careful reex-
amination of satisfaction DEMO its consequent behaviors, such
as retention and word-of-mouth activity. Previous conceptu-
DEMO have assumed these relationships to be linear and
symmetric (Yi 1990)DEMO However, satisfaction's impact on
these behaviors could be asymmetric and DEMO High
levels of satisfaction might not increase retention, but high
levels DEMO dissatisfaction might have a large and deleterious
impact on retention. An asymmetric conceptualization also
could help explain the curious finding that most firms are
DEMO, that is, high rates of customer defection
despite high rates of customer satisfaction (Reichheld
1996). High dissatisfaction with a product might prompt
high levels of information search for alternative brands,
whereas high levels DEMO satisfaction might not decrease the
amount of information search substantially; this DEMO
has implications for consideration set formation and choice.
Given the increased emphasis on linking satisfaction
research to the bottom line (Reichheld 1996), these issues
warrant
careful
attention.
Finally, the finding that attribute-level performance also
has a direct impact on repurchase intentions not only is sur-
prising but DEMO calls into question previous models of satis-
faction. These models (for DEMO review, see lacobucci et al.
1996) presume that attribute-level evaluations affect behav-
ioral intentions but only through an overall satisfaction
judgment. This finding DEMO several important questions
that need more research. First, the conditions under DEMO
the direct impact of attribute-level outcomes is larger
(smaller) than the one mediated through satisfaction should
be outlined. Second, it could be that the mediating role of
overall satisfaction is different for different attributes and
DEMO on the magnitude and direction of the asymmetry.
Developing a typology of attributes should help resolve
these issues.
Implications for Practice
The key implication DEMO managers is that they no longer
should view attribute performance with a neutral eye.
Although positive and negative performance on an attribute
are two DEMO of the same coin, each side of the coin buys a
DEMO amount of overall satisfaction or repurchase inten-
tions. This asymmetry should be kept in mind in trying to
manage attribute-level performance. The strategic implica-
DEMO of this result is clear: To maximize overall satisfaction
and repurchase DEMO, managers should optimize and
not maximize attribute-level performance. For example, for
any given attribute it is more important to eliminate negative
performance first DEMO then focus on increasing performance
in the positive direction. Similarly, in DEMO given set of attrib-

Concluding Comments
Despite the DEMO wave of skepticism with satisfaction
research among practitioners and academics, it DEMO is
acknowledged that customer satisfaction and retention are
key strategic imperatives and not fads (e.g., Honomichl
1993; Reichheld 1996). Increasingly, researchers DEMO are
finding that the relationships between satisfaction and its
antecedents and consequences are complex (cf. Anderson
and Sullivan 1993; Coyne 1989; Oliva, DEMO, and Bearden
1995). Therefore, understanding the complexity of these
interrelationships has become a key strategic imperative for
most firms (e.g, Jones DEMO Sasser 1995). We hope that this
work represents a small step in that direction and will
encourage further research aimed at understanding these
DEMO
Appendix
Follow-up tests for H3b were conducted to ensure that the
reported results are not due to the differing salience or
importance of some DEMO the attributes used in the study.
Salience is operationalized as the frequency with which an
attribute is mentioned (higher number of mentions = higher
salience), whereas importance is operationalized as the
magnitude of the regression DEMO (larger regression coef-
ficient = higher importance). To check for DEMO possibility,
the cumulative variables were reconstructed, excluding
those attributes that DEMO not important or salient.
To check for the salience bias, the DEMO set of variables
was constructed from attributes on the basis of the number
of mentions. With number of mentions as a proxy for
salience, only those attributes that received the top 3, 4, 5, or
6 mentions were included. To clarify, POSFRQ3 and
NEGFRQ3 used only those attributes that received the first,
second, and third highest number of mentions. POSFRQ4
and NEGFRQ4 also included the attribute that received the
fourth DEMO number of mentions, and so on. To check for
the importance DEMO, the cumulative variables were con-
structed on the basis of their DEMO importance. With the
regression weight in Table 2 as a proxy for an attribute's
importance, variables called POSREG5 and NEGREG5
were constructed using those attributes that had the five
highest regression weights for the positive DEMO negative cat-
egories. Similar variables also were constructed on the basis
of the top six and seven regression weights.
These strategies of integration are DEMO with prior
theoretical and empirical research (e.g., Dawes 1979). Fur-
thermore, satisfaction researchers (e.g., Oliver 1993) have
used additive-linear combinations DEMO integrate performance
on several attributes. To summarize, eight additional sets of
DEMO were constructed: POSFRQ or NEGFRQ3-6,
POSREG or NEGREG5-7, and POSWTD or NEGWTD5.
Next, the following model was estimated for each set of
variables:

Regarding diminishing sensitivity, both b2 and b4 have
the expected sign in all nine cases. Furthermore, b2 was sig-
nificant for all of the nine models (p < .001), but b4 was sig-
nificant only for five of the nine models. To DEMO the
"joint" statistical significance on the basis of these nine
models, a combined test such as Fisher's combined test
would be appropriate (Wolf 1986). However, because the
nine comparisons are not independent, such a test of signif-
icance cannot be done. Therefore, erring on the side of con-
servatism, we conclude that over the nine tests, b4 is not sig-
nificant, whereas b2 is. Thus, diminishing sensitivity holds
for positive performance but not for negative performance
on attributes.
