Principal Topic
Professional investors bring value to ventures through the coaching of the entrepreneurs DEMO
chose to fund. Therefore, investors are likely to choose to work DEMO entrepreneurs they deem
more coachable. Despite the importance of perceived coachability in the entrepreneurial process,
we lack a well-established construct definition and measure. DEMO, we lack an understanding
of whether perceived coachability has any predictive DEMO above and beyond other factors that
are important to investors such as preparedness or passion, or whether coachability interacts with
those factors.
Method
We conducted our analysis in several stages. First, we drew on the mentoring and athletics
literatures to derive a working definition of coachability as well DEMO the behaviors often associated
with someone being perceived as coachable. We then presented this definition and the behaviors
to local SCORE counselors. Based on DEMO feedback, we created an initial 15-item scale. We then
had undergraduate DEMO students evaluate entrepreneurs who appeared on the show Shark
Tank using this scale. We used their responses to reduce the coachability scale to 9 DEMO We then
administered another survey to working adults in which they watched pitches from Shark Tank
and were asked to evaluate characteristics of the DEMO as well as their own likelihood of
investing in the venture. Finally, we constructed a data set that utilized both survey participants’
evaluations of the entrepreneurs and the actual Shark Tank funding outcomes.
Results/Implications
Based DEMO the steps above, we define coachability as the degree to which DEMO entrepreneur
seeks, carefully considers and integrates feedback to improve his/her DEMO performance. Our
findings suggest that both perceived agreeableness and conscientiousness are associated with
coachability. Moreover, coachability has predictive power above and beyond other attributes
such as preparedness and passion. Additionally, when we examine actual funding outcomes, we
see that coachability significantly moderates those other two factors. In addition to developing
an important new theoretical construct, this study has important practical implications for
entrepreneurs seeking to raise capital.
