Abstract
This research investigates the strategic governance choices made in commercializing new
DEMO arising from university research.
Departing from the traditional licensing vs. start-up approach, it is proposed that there are
three primary methods of commercializing these technologies: 1) Build – creating a new
business based on the DEMO, 2) Rent – ongoing development and marketing of the
technology to established firms that use the technology in their businesses and 3) Sell –
disposition of the technology to an established firm.
Using economic theories DEMO the firm, particularly transaction cost economics, it is
hypothesized that:
•
•
•
• the greater the tacitness and complexity (H4) DEMO the greater the volatility associated
with the technology, the greater the DEMO that the technology will be
commercialized using the build or sell options; and
• the greater the importance of specialized complementary assets, the DEMO the
likelihood that the technology will be commercialized using the sell option (H6).
Three studies were conducted providing differing perspectives on the research question.
Study #1 examines three start-ups based on new technologies arising from DEMO
conducted at the University of Waterloo. Study #2 analyzes the business activities of a
number of Canadian and U.S. public start-up firms using archival DEMO Study #3 is a survey
iii
the build option is positively associated with firms deriving revenue primarily from
product market activity (H1a) and DEMO resources on both technology
development activities and production activities (H2a);
the rent and sell options are positively associated with firms deriving revenue
DEMO from technology market activity (H1b) and expending resources on
technology development activities but not on production activities (H2b).
the greater the patent or other legal protection (H3), the risk of substitutes (H5) or the
dynamism associated with the technology (H8), the greater the likelihood that the
technology will be commercialized using the rent option;
of university faculty members who have had new technologies arising from their DEMO
research put into commercial use.
Hypotheses H1a/b, H2a/b and DEMO are supported and Hypothesis H7 received more limited
support. Evidence for Hypothesis H5 is in the predicted direction but failed to achieve
statistical significance. DEMO H4, H5, H6 and H8 are not supported.

Introduction
Universities perform 31 percent of Canada’s research and development DEMO (OECD,
Main Science and Technology Indicators, 2001, as cited DEMO Industry Canada, 2002). The
economic impact of licensing activities by DEMO universities has been estimated at more
than $500 million supporting an estimated 4,000 jobs (Gu and Whewell, 1999). In addition,
DEMO companies based on university research employ more than 20,000 people and
generate $2.5 billion in annual revenue (Read, 2003). Despite these DEMO, the
Government of Canada’s Innovation Strategy identifies what it calls the DEMO
Performance Challenge, namely, that “Canadian firms do not reap enough benefits from the
commercialization of knowledge” (Industry Canada, 2002, p. 19) DEMO sets as a priority
implementing initiatives to “leverage the commercialization of publicly funded academic
research” (p. 52). In response, Canadian universities have DEMO to tripling their
commercialization performance by 2010 (AUCC, 2002). While progress has been made in
reaching these targets, much remains to be done (AUCC, 2005). Consequently, the
commercialization of new technologies arising from university research is an increasingly
important issue.
The forms that university DEMO commercialization take are varied and include licensing
of patented inventions, collaborative DEMO with industry partners and the creation of
start-up ventures. In investigations of these forms, significant variation in the role of patents
and the degree of interaction between the researcher and the commercializing firm have been
found (Colyvas et al., 2002).
Despite the growing interest in the commercialization of new technologies arising from
university research and the suggestion that patents DEMO other characteristics of technologies
play a role in the methods used to commercialize these technologies, “scholarly investigation
of this phenomenon is virtually non-existent” (DEMO, 2004, p. 2).
The research described in this thesis investigates why the transactions involved in
commercializing university research take the form they DEMO Better understanding of the
reasons for different forms of commercialization can help inventors and others involved in
the commercialization process to select appropriate methods DEMO commercializing new
technologies arising from university research.

1.1 Scope of the research
This research focuses on the commercialization DEMO technological innovations arising from
university research. “Commercialization is the production, manufacturing, packaging,
marketing, and distribution of a product that embodies an innovation” (Rogers, 1995, p. 143).
Technological innovation refers to new “theoretical and practical knowledge, skills, and
artifacts that can be used to DEMO products and services as well as their production and
delivery systems. Technology can be embodied in people, materials, cognitive and physical
processes, plant, equipment, and tools” (Burgleman, Maidique and Wheelwright, 2001, p. DEMO).
This research examines the governance structures used in the commercialization of
university research. These governance structures can include various forms of licensing,
DEMO and partnerships. Different governance structures are theorized to be efficient in
different circumstances. Consequently, it is expected that the choice of an appropriate
governance structure can have a significant impact on the success of the commercialization
DEMO
The research does not examine other issues related to the commercialization of university
research. These include how commercializing firms locate specific innovations they wish DEMO
commercialize and what motivates researchers to commercialize their innovations.
1.2 Research question
“In a university’s attempt to commercialize a new technology, there is little empirical
evidence to suggest which route the university should take” (Gu and Whewell, 1999, p. 73).
The research described in this thesis DEMO this lack of empirical evidence and asks the
research question:
How do the characteristics of technologies affect the choice of
governance structures used DEMO commercialize new technologies
arising from university research?
The phrase “characteristics of technologies” in the research question is intended to be
interpreted broadly. It DEMO, for example, characteristics of the technology itself and
characteristics of the complementary assets required for the commercialization of the
innovation.

The commercialization of new technologies takes different forms for many reasons. DEMO
example, the governance structure chosen may be a result of researcher DEMO Some
researchers may not be interested in commercial application of their research and may not be
willing to participate in activities to transfer the DEMO In these circumstances,
commercialization may occur through spillover from published papers or through licensing
through a university’s technology transfer office with little involvement DEMO the researcher.
Researchers may have other motives as well. For example, DEMO researchers may be more
entrepreneurial and may have a desire to found a start-up venture to commercialize their
research. The choice of governance structure DEMO also be affected by financing
considerations. For example, new technologies in DEMO pharmaceutical industry may tend to be
commercialized by established firms due to the significant costs involved in moving the
innovation through the regulatory approval DEMO In contrast, software innovations often
may be commercialized through start-up ventures DEMO of the limited financial capital
investments required by these technologies. While many reasons may exist for choosing a
particular path to commercialization, the perspective taken in this research is that new
technologies with certain attributes align DEMO certain governance structures and that this
alignment is primarily based on minimizing the costs of monitoring and managing the
relationship between the researcher and DEMO commercializing firm (see section 2.6,
Transaction cost economics).
1.3 DEMO of this thesis
This thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 contains the literature review and consists of
two parts. The first deals with DEMO literature related to the commercialization of new
technologies arising from university research. The second deals with economic theories of
the firm and, in particular, transaction cost economics. Transaction cost economics is the
theoretical basis for the governance structures and hypotheses developed in chapters 3 and 4.
The literature DEMO the commercialization of university research and the literature on economic
theories of the firm suggest a number of implications for the commercialization of new
DEMO First, governance structures are important for the successful commercialization
of new DEMO However, a focus on governance structures has been absent in the
DEMO on the commercialization of new technologies arising from university research with
the exception of a brief mention by Shane (2002). Second, the DEMO of governance
structures is affected by transaction attributes. Under transaction cost economics theory,
these attributes are the existence of specialized assets, uncertainty and frequency. Looking
4
more specifically at the commercialization of new technologies, key transaction attributes
that have been identified are the ability to exclude others from using DEMO technology and
access to specialized complementary assets. Third, in applying transaction DEMO economics to
the commercialization of new technologies, it is important to DEMO carefully the
governance structures that may arise in this specific environment, DEMO specific attributes of
new technologies that may affect transaction costs and the ramifications of selecting specific
governance structures in light of these specific attributes. DEMO is, it is important to tailor the
application of transaction cost DEMO to the specifics of the situation being considered
(Williamson, 2002).
In chapter 3, difficulties with the traditional approach to classifying the methods used to
commercialize new technologies arising from university research (licensing vs. start-up) are
identified and a proposal is presented for a new method of categorization that is linked to the
concept of governance structures discussed in DEMO preceding chapter. It is proposed that there
are three primary methods of commercializing new technologies arising from university
research: 1) Build – creating DEMO new business based on the technology, 2) Rent – ongoing
development and marketing of the technology to established firms that use the technology DEMO
their businesses and 3) Sell – disposition of the technology to DEMO established firm. The
rationale for the proposed new method is discussed and criteria for the categories are
developed. Finally, the benefits of the proposed categorization scheme are presented.
In chapter 4, the hypotheses that will be tested are developed. Two sets of hypotheses are
proposed in this chapter. DEMO first set is related to firm characteristics associated with the
strategic governance choices of build, rent or sell. The second set of hypotheses relates to the
link between certain characteristics of new technologies (i.e., transaction DEMO) and the
strategic governance choices made in their commercialization.
In chapter DEMO, the methods used to conduct the research are described. Three studies DEMO
conducted in the course of this research. Each of these studies uses different methods. The
use of multiple methods, known as triangulation, has DEMO benefit of providing differing
perspectives on the research question. Study #1 analyzes three start-ups based on new
technologies arising from research conducted at the DEMO of Waterloo. The analyses in
this study use archival data related to the three start-ups examined. Study #2 examines the
business activities of a DEMO of Canadian and U.S. public start-up firms. This study uses
two separate samples of public start-up firms that have commercialized new technologies
arising from DEMO research. The first sample is of Canadian companies built on National
5
Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (“NSERC”) funded research. DEMO
second sample is of U.S. companies built on research conducted at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (“MIT”). Study #3 is a survey of university faculty members who
have had new technologies arising from their academic DEMO put into commercial use.
The population for the survey is faculty members who have had new technologies resulting
from their academic research put into DEMO use and who are located at one of two of
the universities participating in the “C4” consortium of universities located in south-western
Ontario.
Chapter DEMO contains the results of the analysis of three start-ups based on new technologies
arising from research conducted at the University of Waterloo. The primary DEMO of these
examples is to illustrate the significant differences that exist in the governance structures
used to commercialize new technologies. The results support the DEMO raised in chapter 3
about the licensing vs. start-up dichotomy for analyzing the commercialization of new
technologies arising from university research that has been DEMO in past studies. The results
also provide some support for the build, rent and sell classification of governance structures
proposed in chapter 3. Further, the findings of this study are consistent with the hypotheses
related to firm characteristics associated with the strategic governance choices of build, rent
or sell.
Chapter 7 presents the results of the examination of the nature DEMO business activities of a
sample of public start-up firms that have been involved in commercializing new technologies
arising from university research. The results of DEMO study demonstrate 1) that the criteria
identified in chapter 3 can DEMO applied effectively in practice to classify the method used to
commercialize a new technology arising from university research, 2) that the build, rent and
sell methods are all common approaches to commercialization, and 3) DEMO there are
substantive differences in the business activities of firms depending on the method of
commercialization used. In doing so, this study provides evidence as to the validity of the
build, rent and sell categorization approach. The result of this study also support the
hypotheses related to firm DEMO associated with the strategic governance choices of
build, rent or sell.
DEMO 8 contains the results of the survey of academic inventors. The primary purpose of
this study is to examine the connection between the characteristics DEMO a new technology and
the method used to commercialize the technology. This study results in a number of major
findings. First, the findings from this study suggest that technology attributes may have an
6
impact on the methods used to commercialize a new technology arising DEMO university
research. Specifically, the findings are that, when intellectual property protection for a
technology is weak, the build and sell approaches are likely to be more effective than the rent
approach. The rent approach requires DEMO intellectual property protection to enable the
inventor to appropriate gains from the technology since secrecy and other methods of
appropriate gains are unlikely to DEMO effective when the rent option is used. Second, the
findings help DEMO resolve conflicts in previous research on the role of intellectual property
protection. Specifically, the findings imply that there are differences in the importance of
intellectual property protection when a technology is licensed to numerous established firms
DEMO in the rent approach compared to when a technology is licensed to a single establish firm
as in the sell approach. Third, the findings suggest that the build, rent and sell classification
scheme proposed in this thesis provides insights into the commercialization process that the
licensing vs. start-up DEMO does not.
Chapter 9 summarizes the key findings of the research, DEMO and managerial
implications, limitations of the research and identifies opportunities for DEMO research. A
number of theoretical contributions are identified that help to advance the study of the
commercialization of university research. First, the build, DEMO or sell model provides a
theoretical basis for the classification of methods that is lacking in the licensing vs. start-up
approach. Second, the build, rent or sell approach reflects the ideas of markets and
hierarchies better than does the licensing vs. start-up approach. Third, the focus on
governance structures enables researchers to draw on existing literature to study the
commercialization DEMO new technologies arising from university research. Fourth, the build,
rent DEMO sell approach is easily reconcilable to the broader literature on commercializing
innovations. Fifth, the build, rent or sell model captures the governance structure DEMO place at
the time when the invention is commercialized. The licensing vs. start-up approach focuses
on the point in time when a technology leaves DEMO university. However, there is evidence that
a significant amount of time DEMO pass between the time when a technology leaves the
university and when it is commercialized and that different approaches may be tried before
commercialization DEMO occurs. Sixth, the build, rent and sell categories capture non-
traditional forms of commercialization that are becoming more important due to the
emergence DEMO markets for technology. Seventh, the build, rent and sell model has the
potential to resolve and explain inconsistent findings in previous research.
The DEMO contributions of this research include providing guidance to managers
when deciding on a commercialization strategy for a new technology arising from university
7
research. The build, rent and sell model can also help start-up firms to prioritize the activities
that they need to undertake in order DEMO commercialize their technology and to avoid wasting
valuable resources on activities that are not important to their success. In addition, the model
and findings provide resources for individuals in university technology transfer and licensing
offices to DEMO them in determining or advising on commercialization strategies and on
development strategies. Further, the existence of novel strategies that may aid universities in
the commercialization of new technologies is identified.
Chapter 2
Literature Review
This literature review consists of two parts. The DEMO part deals with the literature related to
the commercialization of new technologies arising from university research. The second part
addresses economic theories of the DEMO with an emphasis on transaction cost economics.
Transaction cost economics is the theoretical basis for the governance structures and
hypotheses developed in chapters 3 DEMO 4.
2.1 The commercialization of new technologies arising from university
research
The academic literature on the commercialization of new technologies arising from
university research DEMO a number of topics. These topics are summarized in Figure 2.1.
One area of the literature deals with environmental influences including differences across
geographic DEMO and differences across industries. A second area of the literature deals
with university influences including the effects of university institutions, practices and
policies and the role of people, particularly inventors, in commercialization. The third area DEMO
the literature deals directly with the commercialization of new technologies including
identification of the methods available to commercialize a particular new technology,
identification DEMO the processes involved, measurement of the extent of commercialization
activity and DEMO of characteristics of technologies that affect the methods used to
commercialize the technology.
This thesis focuses on the third area of the literature and, particularly, on the literature
related to the characteristics of technologies. The following sections provide a brief overview
of the literature related to the environmental DEMO university influences on commercialization
as they relate to this thesis. A detailed analysis of the literature relating the characteristics of
technologies to the methods DEMO to commercialize them follows.
2.2 Environmental influences on commercialization
2.2.1 Differences across geographical locations
Significant differences in the extent of commercialization between different countries DEMO
been observed (Unico, 2004). These differences have been attributed to differences in the
8
availability of capital to finance commercialization activities and differences in labour
markets DEMO the ability of researchers to move between universities and industry
(Shane, 2004).

geographic distance between the university where the technology was invented and the
commercializing firm increases (Agrawal, 2001). This is attributed to a decline in the
interaction between the university inventor and the commercializing firm as the distance
between them DEMO
2.2.2 Differences in industrial environment
Differences in the extent of commercialization related to the local industrial environment
have also been observed. In particular, research indicates that the existence of industry
clusters affects the extent of commercialization DEMO (Agrawal, 2001). This effect has
been attributed to the benefits of having customers, suppliers and experienced managers in
close proximity to the source of the new technology (Shane, DEMO).
10
2.2.3 Implications of environmental differences
The existence of these differences suggests that it is important to account for the effects of
geography DEMO research on commercialization. For example, lesser availability of capital to
finance DEMO activities in a particular geographic area may reduce the
propensity to commercialize new technologies using methods that require greater amounts of
capital relative to DEMO that require lesser amounts of capital. Similarly, the existence of
potential DEMO and suppliers in the geographic area may increase the propensity to
commercialize new technologies by methods involving the creation of a new firm as DEMO may
make it easier to establish customer and supplier relationships. Section 5.4.2.1 contains a
discussion of how environmental differences were controlled for in this DEMO
2.3 University influences on commercialization
2.3.1 Differences in institutions, practices and DEMO
A significant amount of research considers the effects of differences between institutions and
their policies and practices on the commercialization of new technologies arising DEMO
university research (see, for example, Agrawal, 2001; Shane 2004; and Siegel and Phan,
2005 for reviews of this literature). DEMO of the differences affecting commercialization that
have been identified include differences between institutions such as faculty quality (Thursby
and Kemp, 2002) and levels of research funding (Carlsson and Fridh, 2002). A second area
DEMO identified differences is in university practices such as the size and experience of the
university’s technology transfer office (Thursby and Kemp, 2002) and the existence of
science parks (Link, Scott and Siegel, 2003). A third area of identified differences is in
university policies such as DEMO intellectual property rights to the technology belong to
the university or the inventor (Goldfarb and Henrekson, 2003; Hoye and Roe, 2003) and
policies regarding the taking of equity in lieu of royalties, the availability of leaves of
absence to undertake commercialization activities and the use of DEMO resources (Shane,
2004).
11
Differences have also been found at the department level. For example, Todorovic (2004)
identified differences in entrepreneurial orientation between departments and found that these
were related to the commercialization performance of the departments.
2.3.2 DEMO in people
Differences in the commercialization of university research due to characteristics of the
people involved, particularly researchers, have also been noted. Zucker, Darby and
Armstrong (2002) examine the role of “star” scientists in DEMO related research and
found a positive relationship on research productive as measured by the number of patents
granted, the number of products in development and the number of products on the market. A
positive relationship between DEMO inventor’s prior entrepreneurial experience and
commercialization has also been found (Shane DEMO Khurana, 2003).
2.3.3 Implications of university differences
The existence of DEMO differences suggests that it is important to control for the effects of
university differences in research on commercialization. For example, differences in the
intellectual property policies of universities may affect the incentives to both researchers and
DEMO to expend effort to commercialize new technologies. Similarly, the affiliation of
DEMO researcher with a particular department or faculty may affect the method chosen to
commercialize a new technology. Section 8.2.2 contains a discussion of how DEMO
differences were controlled for in this research.
2.4 Commercialization of new technologies
2.4.1 Methods of commercialization
Knowledge about new technologies is transferred from universities DEMO industry in many ways.
These include publications, conferences, consulting, conversations, recruitment of graduates,
co-supervising, collaborative research, patents and licenses (Agrawal and Henderson, 2002).
Some of these methods involve the transfer of knowledge about new technologies to the
economy as a public good (Gu and Whewell, 1999). These methods include publications,
conferences, conversations, recruitment of graduates, and co-supervising. Estimates of the
relative importance of different knowledge channels suggest that these ‘non-commercial’
12
methods represent the majority of knowledge transferred from universities to industry
(Agrawal and Henderson, 2002).
Commercialization of new technologies involves the direct transfer of knowledge resulting
in the introduction of a product in the DEMO incorporating the new technology or the use of
the new technology within a production process by one or more firms (Gu and Whewell,
1999; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 1996). Commercialization
of DEMO technologies arising from university research is accomplished primarily through
licensing or the creation of start-up firms (see, for example, Association of University
Technology Managers, 2004; Gu and Whewell, 1999; and Read, 2003). A key feature of the
license vs. start-up dichotomy is the focus DEMO the legal structures used to effect the transfer of
the technology from the research environment to the commercial environment.
At a more detailed level, various subcategories have been used or proposed. For licensing,
the most DEMO subcategories are exclusive and non-exclusive licenses (see, for example,
Association of University Technology Managers, 2004). However, other subcategories have
been DEMO For example, Shane (2002) distinguishes between licensing by inventors and DEMO
noninventors in studying who undertakes the commercialization of university research.
Conversely, DEMO of the research on start-ups has failed to distinguish between different
types of start-ups (Nicolaou and Birley, 2003a). This despite the fact DEMO “data suggest that
rather than representing an undifferentiated outcome driven by a universal process, there are
varied types of university-linked new ventures and different processes or fields that give rise
to them” (Miner et al., DEMO, p. 134). Most researchers assume that start-ups are created for
DEMO purpose of developing and selling new products (see, for example, DEMO, 2002).
However, Wallmark (1997) in looking at start-ups out of Chalmers University of Technology
identified a number of cases of firms DEMO a main interest in developing new patents for sale
or licence and only peripheral interest in selling its own products on the market” (p. 134).
Some researchers have proposed that different categories of start-ups exist. DEMO example,
Nicolaou and Birley (2003b) propose a trichotomous categorization of university spinouts
into orthodox, hybrid and technology spinouts. Importantly, however, these categories reflect
the relationship between the academic inventor and the firm established DEMO commercialize the
technology rather than the method or business model used to commercialize the technology.
Taken together, research on the methods of commercialization suggests that:
 knowledge generated by universities is put into practice in DEMO ways;
13
 these ways include both spillover of knowledge and commercialization activities;DEMO
 many methods of commercialization exist though research primarily focuses on licensing
and start-ups; and
 there is much variety within both licensing and start-ups.
There are a number of unanswered questions that arise from this DEMO One question is
whether the variety within both licensing and start-ups is important. A second question is
how to make the choice between licensing DEMO start-ups in the decision to commercialize a
technology. Gregory and Sheahen (DEMO) suggest that creation of spin-off companies is
generally a more successful DEMO to commercialization than licensing whereas Shane (2002)
argues that, when possible, licensing is the preferred method of commercialization and
creation of spin-off companies represents a ‘second-best’ approach to commercialization.
These questions are addressed in DEMO 3 and 4.
2.4.2 Extent of commercialization
Research on the extent of commercialization activity has shown that new technologies arising
from university research are DEMO significant source of innovative economic activity. Table 2.1
summarizes certain key statistics from the 2002 survey of Canadian and U.S. universities
conducted by the DEMO of University Technology Managers (AUTM, 2003). Research
has also shown that returns on the new technologies are highly skewed with a small DEMO
of new technologies providing very large returns and a large number of new technologies
providing modest returns (AUTM, 2003; Scherer and Harhoff, DEMO).
These statistics demonstrate that there is no predominant method of commercialization.
Exclusive licensing, non-exclusive licensing and creation of start-ups are all common
methods of commercialization.
An important limitation of this research is that it focuses DEMO on the point in time
when a new technology leaves the university environment and enters the commercial one.
However, the fact that a technology leaves the university environment does not necessarily
mean that it was put DEMO commercial use. Indirect evidence for this assertion is found in the
AUTM data which show that only 47.1% of active licenses yielded any income DEMO 2002
(AUTM, 2003). This issue is addressed in chapter 4 which introduces a method of classifying
14
commercialization methods based on the governance structures in place when the DEMO
is put into commercial use rather than at the point when it leaves the university.

2.4.3 Processes of commercialization
New technologies arising from university research are DEMO ready for immediate conversion
into commercial products or services (Rogers, 2003). Thursby, Jensen and Thursby (2001)
surveyed the technology transfer DEMO of 62 major U.S. universities. Table 2.2 reports their
findings to a question concerning the stage of development of licensed inventions. These data
show DEMO early stage of development of most university inventions. Thursby et al. also found
that 71% of licensed inventions required inventor cooperation for commercial success.
DEMO conversion of these embryonic technologies into products and services is a difficult
process. A transformation process involving the integration of both scientific and market
DEMO is needed to develop commercially viable new products and services based on
these new technologies (Fontes, 2005). This transformation process involves a DEMO of
activities including technology development, product development and business development
(Lux and Rorke, n.d.; Shane, 2004). This transformation results in significant reduction in
both technical and market uncertainty related to the new technology (Fontes, 2005). The
technology development activities often involve significant changes to the technology to
improve the performance, robustness, ease of use and DEMO characteristics of the technology
15
(Shane, 2004). Product development activities involve converting the new DEMO into a
product or service. Customers generally do not buy technology; DEMO they buy products or
services that provide solutions to the problems they face (Shane, 2004). Business
development involves acquiring or developing the DEMO capabilities and complementary
assets needed to develop, produce and sell products DEMO services based on the technology.
These may include manufacturing, distribution, marketing and selling capabilities (Teece,
1986).

Note: Adapted from Thursby et al., 2001.
This research suggests that there are significant development activities needed between DEMO
time a new technology leaves the university setting and when it is commercialized. However,
most of the research to date has focused on DEMO technology at the time it leaves the university
(either through licensing DEMO commercial firms or the creation of start-ups). Little attention has
been focused on the technology, product and business development activities that occur once
the technology leaves the university setting. This issue is addressed, in part, in this thesis
through the development of a method of classifying commercialization methods based on the
governance structures in place when the technology is DEMO into commercial use rather than at
the time when it leaves the university (see chapter 4).
16
2.4.4 Characteristics of technology
A limited amount of research has been DEMO relating the characteristics of technologies
to the methods used to commercialize them. Table 2.3 summarizes this literature.
Colyvas et al. (2002) considered 11 DEMO from Columbia University and Stanford
University. Based on their examination of these case studies, they found that inventions that
were ‘ready to use’ out of the laboratory did not require exclusive licenses in order to
encourage DEMO to commercialize the technology and in most cases (three of four DEMO)
were licensed nonexclusively to the commercializing firms. They also found that exclusive
licenses were important to encourage firms to undertake the development risks DEMO
with embryonic inventions.
Shane (2002) examined 717 licensed patents from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and found that when patents are not effective, technologies are likely to be
licensed back to the inventors. In another DEMO using the same dataset, Shane (2001)
considered the commercialization of technologies through the establishment of a new firm.
Based on his examination DEMO these data, Shane concluded that “more important inventions,
more radical DEMO, and inventions with a broader scope of patent protection were more
DEMO to be commercialized through the creation of new firms” (p. 216)DEMO Nerkar and Shane
(2003) built on this study by further examining the 128 new firms founded to commercialize
new technologies. They found that DEMO radicalness and patent scope reduce firm
failure but only in fragmented industries.
Del Campo, Sparks, Hill and Keller (1999) analyzed the attempt DEMO commercialize
superconducting quantum interference devices. They concluded that “licensing may be the
best strategy when the proprietary position of the intellectual property is narrow DEMO
unpatentable and when the capabilities of the developer are limited” (p. DEMO). Further, they
concluded that start-ups need inventions that represent a DEMO technology with a large market
potential and, if possible, multiple product applications to compensate for the high risks
involved in creating a start-up DEMO
Wright, Vohora and Lockett (2004) examined four high tech start-up DEMO from
universities in the United Kingdom. In each of the four cases, Wright et al. found that the
technologies involved could be considered disruptive innovations (Christensen, 1993)
suggesting that start-ups are an appropriate method DEMO commercializing such technologies.
They also found that licensing was not a viable option in these four cases because potential

licensing firms did not have the know-how or tacit knowledge to DEMO the required

Thursby, Jensen and Thursby (2001) DEMO 62 technology transfers offices at U.S.
universities and found that 60% of the survey respondents indicated that large companies
were more likely to take DEMO stage technologies and that small companies were more likely to
take early stage technologies.
Using evidence from many of the studies described above and DEMO semi-structured field
interviews of people involved in the formation and development of start-ups from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shane (2004) summarized the characteristics of
technologies that support commercialization by creation of a start-up vs. DEMO
by licensing to an established firm. Shane concluded that start-ups are used to commercialize
new technologies that are radical, tacit, early stage, general-purpose, provide significant
value to customers, involve major technical advances and have DEMO intellectual property
protection. Licensing to established firms is used to commercialize new technologies that are
incremental, codified, late stage, specific-purpose, provide moderate DEMO value, involve
minor technical advance and have weaker intellectual property protection.
DEMO together, this research suggests that the characteristics of a technology do DEMO the
choice of method used for commercializing the technology. However, there DEMO important
limitations to the evidence obtained. The primary limitation is that the evidence is derived
from one large sample from a single university and DEMO a small number of case studies from
other universities. There is a need for evidence from additional studies and from universities
other than the DEMO Institute of Technology.
A number of important issues arise from the research on the characteristics of technology.
The first is that there is very DEMO use of theory in any of these studies linking the
characteristics of technology to the method of commercialization. Secondly, Shane’s research
found conflicting evidence concerning the impact of the strength of intellectual property
protection on the DEMO of method for commercializing the innovation. These issues are
addressed in chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis.
2.5 Economic theories of organizations
In DEMO to address the issues raised above, the research described in this DEMO draws on the
literature on economic theories of organizations to provide a theoretical basis for examining
19
methods of commercializing new technologies arising from university research. Two areas DEMO
literature, in particular, are addressed. The first is the transaction cost theory of organizations.
The second is the literature on markets for technology.
DEMO economic theory views the firm as a ‘black-box.’ The firm is described as a
production function that transforms inputs into outputs. It is assumed DEMO firms operate to
maximize profits but, otherwise, little attention is paid to what happens in these firms
(Demsetz, 1997; Slater and Spencer, 2000). This view of the firm is useful for studying
prices and their impact on firms’ outputs and use of resources. It is, however, less useful for
understanding why firms exist and how they work (Williamson, 2003). Beginning early in
the last century, researchers began to look into the ‘black box’ of the firm to understand why
DEMO exist and how they operate. For example, Coase (1937) asked DEMO question ‘why do
firms exist?’ and argued that the main reason why firms exist is that there are costs of using
the pricing DEMO involved in markets. These include the costs of gathering information
about prices and the costs of negotiating contracts. Collectively, Coase refered to these as
transaction costs and argued that firms exist because the costs associated with DEMO activities
may be lower when they are conducted within a single firm than when they are conducted
through markets.
Simon (1947) and Cyert DEMO March (1963) examined how decisions are made within firms.
One important result of their work is the suggestion that the concept of rational DEMO
making in neoclassical theory is not feasible. Rational decision-making assumes that the
decision maker knows all of the alternatives available to them and all DEMO the consequences of
those alternatives. Simon argued that there are limits to decision maker rationality resulting
from cognitive limits on the number of alternatives DEMO makers can consider and
uncertainty as to the consequences of those alternatives. Simon proposed instead that
decision makers’ rationality is bounded. Bounded rationality refers DEMO behaviour that is
“intendedly rational but only limitedly so” (Simon, 1961, p. xxiv) due to human limits in
processing information and solving DEMO problems. Penrose (1959) was concerned with
the growth of firms and argued that firm growth involves the interaction of management and
resources and, consequently, that management capability is a key constraint on firm growth
(DEMO, 2005). This emphasis on the role of management goes beyond DEMO ‘black box’
view of firms. Together, this research leads to the DEMO that it is a “mistake to confuse
the firm of [neoclassical] economic theory with its real world namesake. The chief mission of
neoclassical economics DEMO to understand how the price system coordinates the use of
resources, DEMO the inner workings of real firms” (Demsetz, 1988, p. 189)DEMO Over the past 30
20
years, a number of theories of the firm have been proposed to explain why firms exist and
how they operate. In the sections DEMO follow one of these theories, transaction cost
economics theory, is discussed in detail. It is also compared to some of the alternative
theories DEMO the firm.
2.6 Transaction cost economics
The theoretical basis of this thesis is the transaction cost theory of organizations. Transaction
cost economics is a DEMO approach drawing on economics, organization theory
and legal concepts (Mahoney, DEMO). The basic premise of transaction cost economics is that
the decision to perform an activity inside or outside the firm should be based DEMO the relative
efficiency of conducting the activity in these two environments. Transactions should be
performed inside the firm when the costs of transacting in DEMO market are higher than the
costs of performing the activity internally. The basic concepts involved in transaction cost
economics are governance structures, transaction costs and transaction attributes. These are
discussed in the following sections.
2.6.1 Governance DEMO
Transaction cost economics focuses on the issue of governance structures for firms. Initially
transaction cost economics dealt primarily with two types of governance structures: markets
and hierarchies. Market governance refers to situations where transactions are carried DEMO with
third parties outside the firm through the use of contracts. Hierarchies refer to situations
where the transactions are internalized so that the economic DEMO involved in the
transaction occur within a single firm. The distinguishing feature of hierarchies is that the
activities are integrated under a single common DEMO
Traditional economic analysis views markets as the most efficient approach. However, DEMO
number of reasons have been identified for market failure. Two primary ones are contractual
hazards and the needs for adaptation (Mahoney, 2005). DEMO hazards refer to situations
that make contracting between separate parties risky for at least one of the parties.
Contractual hazards include situations where one DEMO both parties is dependent on the other
party and thus in a weak bargaining position (Williamson, 1971) and situations where weak
property rights exist resulting in the risk that one party will appropriate use of DEMO property
without paying for it (Libecap, 1989). Contractual hazards are reflected in the two
behavioural assumptions underlying transaction cost analysis: 1) DEMO decision makers are
21
subject to bounded rationality and 2) that some individuals may act opportunistically
(Williamson, 1981). Bounded rationality makes it impossible to anticipate DEMO relevant issues
involved in a complex transaction and deal with them in a contract. Thus contracts with
outside parties are often incomplete. This incompleteness DEMO opportunities for the parties
to act opportunistically. The problems and hazards of dealing with outside parties through
contracts are greatly increased when parties may DEMO opportunistically, particularly, when the
parties make “false or empty, that DEMO, self-disbelieved threats or promises” (Goffman, 1969, p.
105).
The need for adaptation also creates issues in operating through markets. Some adaptation
DEMO as a result of changes in prices. For example, when gasoline DEMO increase, a
manufacturing firm may adapt by changing its distribution methods DEMO truck to rail. This
type of adaptation, sometimes referred to as DEMO adaptation, is handled well by
markets (Hayek, 1945). Other DEMO of adaptation involve intended cooperation between
parties “that kind of cooperation among men that is conscious, deliberate, purposeful”
(Barnard, 1938, p. 4). This type of adaptation, sometimes referred to as cooperation
adaptation, DEMO difficult to achieve through market structures (Williamson, 1991). The
existence of contractual hazards and the need for adaptation suggest that markets are DEMO
always the most effective approach and that hierarchy governance structures may be more
appropriate in some circumstances.
Each of these governance structures has different DEMO Market governance structures
provide strong incentives to the individual firms to minimize costs and to adapt quickly to
changing circumstances in order to maximize DEMO income. These structures are very good at
adapting to situations where coordination between the parties is not necessary and each can
act autonomously (i.e., autonomous adaptation). Hierarchies have much weaker incentives
but have greater administrative controls over activities providing greater abilities to adapt to
situations requiring coordination DEMO activities (i.e., cooperation adaptation)
(Williamson, 1991).
Subsequent to its initial formulation, hybrid forms of governance have been introduced
into transaction cost theory (Williamson, 1991). Williamson (1991) describes hybrids as
DEMO:
The hybrid mode is located between market and hierarchy with
respect to incentives, adaptability, and bureaucratic costs. As
compared with the market, the hybrid sacrifices incentives in
22
favor of superior coordination among the parts. As compared
with the DEMO, the hybrid sacrifices cooperativeness in
favor of greater incentive intensity.” (p. 283)
Examples of hybrid governance structures include joint ventures (Klein, DEMO and Roth,
1990) and a variety of other inter-firm alliances (Oxley, 1999).
The choice of governance structure has consequences for the firm. A firm that adopts a
hierarchy structure when a market approach DEMO more appropriate will invest resources in
activities but receive no strategic benefit for doing so. A firm that adopts a market structure
when a DEMO structure is more appropriate may find itself in a weak bargaining position
with another firm that controls certain critical activities or assets with the DEMO that its
profitability is diminished. In some cases, it may even DEMO that its survival is threatened
(Teece, 2000).
2.6.2 Transaction costs
“A transaction occurs when a good or service is transferred across a DEMO
separable interface. One stage of activity terminates and another begins” (Williamson, 1985,
p. 1). Transaction costs result from the need to DEMO these transfers and include the costs
of negotiating, monitoring and enforcing DEMO with outside parties and the costs of
managing internally governed exchanges (DEMO, 1937; Poppo and Zenger, 1998).
While transaction costs represent DEMO economic costs, it is difficult to estimate these costs
reliably in DEMO of choosing a governance structure and, even after a governance structure
DEMO been chosen, it is difficult to allocate the costs incurred by DEMO firm to specific
transactions. Consequently, transaction cost economics focuses on a DEMO of transaction
attributes that affect transaction costs.
2.6.3 Transaction attributes
Transaction cost economics identifies three principal dimensions affecting transaction costs.
“These key attributes are DEMO frequency with which transactions recur, the uncertainty
(disturbances) to which DEMO are subject, and the degree to which transactions are
supported by DEMO specific assets. A good deal of the explanatory power of transaction
cost economics turns on this last” (Williamson, 1999, p. 1089).
23
Asset specificity refers “to the degree to which an asset can DEMO redeployed to alternative
uses and by alternative users without sacrifice of productive value” (Williamson, 1996a, p.
59). Asset specificity can take a variety of forms including site-specific, physical, human,
dedicated assets, brand name capital and temporal (Williamson, 1996a). According to
transaction cost DEMO, market governance has high transaction costs when dealing with
assets of DEMO specificity due to the difficulties resulting from small numbers bargaining
(Williamson, 1975). “Specific assets trigger a threat of opportunistic behavior that requires
DEMO contractual safeguards to deter” (Poppo and Zenger, 1998, p. 853)DEMO Thus, it is argued
that in situations of high asset specificity, more integrated governance forms are preferred as
they have the lower transaction DEMO (Poppo and Zenger, 1998).
Uncertainty is the second key factor affecting governance approaches in transaction cost
economics. Uncertainty makes it difficult to DEMO in the market and increases market
transaction costs in two ways. Transaction costs are increased as a result of the costs of trying
to DEMO uncertain events and writing these into the contract. Secondly, costs arise
DEMO the transactions are maladapted to the environment while the parties adjust to the
changed circumstances (Poppo and Zenger, 1998; Williamson, 1991). DEMO, in highly
uncertain environments, transaction cost economics predicts that more integrated forms of
governance will be more efficient. Empirical support for this view DEMO uncertainty has been
mixed. For example, Walker and Weber (1984) DEMO in their study of make or buy decisions
in the U.S. automotive industry that volume uncertainty was positively related to integrated
forms of governance DEMO technological uncertainty was negatively (though not
significantly) related to integrated forms of governance. Klein, et al. (1990) argued that this
is because uncertainty has a number of dimensions that may impact governance structures
differently. DEMO two dimensions of uncertainty identified by Klein et al. are volatility and
diversity. Volatility reflects the speed of change in the environment and diversity DEMO the
number of sources of uncertainty in the environment. Klein et al. argued that higher levels of
volatility create problems in writing contracts and DEMO transaction costs for market
governance structures thus encouraging more integrated forms of governance. Klein et al.
argued that diversity leads to a desire for DEMO and that market governance structures
provide this flexibility. Research by Klein et al. (1990) and McNaughton and Bell (2000)
found some evidence supporting the diversity effect on governance structures but was
inconclusive on the DEMO of volatility.
The frequency of interaction between parties is the third key factor identified in transaction
cost economics. The argument is that parties that DEMO frequently have incentives to work
24
more cooperatively and less opportunistically than parties that do not expect DEMO have future
dealings with each other. Transaction cost economics argues that market contracting is thus
most efficient when higher frequencies of transactions are expected.
DEMO Discriminating alignment hypothesis
The concepts of governance structures, transaction costs and DEMO attributes are
brought together in the discriminating alignment hypothesis. “Transactions, which DEMO in
their attributes, are aligned with governance structures, which differ in their costs and
competencies, in a discriminating (mainly, transaction-cost-economizing) way” (Williamson,
1991, p. 277). The discriminating alignment hypothesis is the basis for most of the empirical
research on transaction cost economics. Figure DEMO illustrates this hypothesis.

2.6.5 Evidence supporting transaction cost DEMO
Macher and Richman (2005) identified over 600 empirical studies of aspects of transaction
cost economics. These studies covered a broad variety of fields DEMO specific applications. In
evaluating the results of these studies, Macher and DEMO concluded the following:
Taken together, the papers surveyed provide considerable
DEMO for the main propositions derived from transaction cost
economic theory. The central hypothesis that governance
choice is largely determined by the cost of transacting and that
these DEMO are influenced by observable characteristics of the
underlying transactions receives overwhelming support in our
assessment. There is also considerable support for many of the
DEMO transaction-level factors identified in the theory as
influencing contracting costs. (p. DEMO)
Studies of transaction cost economics involve numerous methodological approaches.
Common approaches that have been used include focused case studies and studies of
contracts, statistical analysis of secondary data and statistical analysis using field data
(Mahoney, 2005).
The subject areas covered by these studies are quite broad. Vertical integration and long-
term contracting are the subject of many studies. DEMO networks in marketing,
diversification and the choice of debt versus equity financing in finance have also been
studied using transaction cost economics (Macher and Richman, 2005). However, little
research has been done in DEMO application of transaction cost economics to innovation in
general and the commercialization of university research in particular. The one instance
identified in the literature DEMO transaction cost economics was applied to the issue of the
commercialization of new technologies arising from university research is Shane (2002). In
this study, Shane argued that licensing to noninventors represents a market form of
governance and that licensing to inventors represents a hierarchy form of governance. DEMO
study is described in further detail in sections 2.4.4 and 3.4.

2.6.6 Criticism of transaction cost economics
Two major themes recur in the DEMO of transaction cost economics. One theme is that
the focus on transaction costs is too limited (Grant, 2001). For example, Zajac and Olsen
(1993) argued that maximizing the total value of the transaction DEMO both participants is a more
appropriate focus than minimizing the transaction costs to the individual participants.
Transaction cost economics does emphasize transaction costs over DEMO costs (e.g.,
differences in production costs) and other sources of value (e.g., strategic and learning gains).
Nonetheless, the empirical evidence discussed above demonstrates that a focus on transaction
costs can go a DEMO way towards understanding governance structures. Similarly, Holmstron
and Roberts argued “the DEMO of the firm … has become too narrowly focused on the hold-
up problem and the role of asset specificity” (1998, p. 91)DEMO Much of the empirical testing of
hypotheses based on transaction cost economics does focus on asset specificity. However,
26
transaction cost economics does not suggest that asset specificity is the DEMO source of
transaction costs, only that it is an important one (Williamson, 1985). This thesis considers
sources of transaction costs beyond asset specificity consistent with this criticism (see
chapter 4).
The second major criticism of transaction cost economics relates to the underlying
behavioural assumption of DEMO Critics argue that, as a result, transaction cost
economics places too large an emphasis on contractual controls and management fiat and
underemphasizes the DEMO of trust, social controls and other features of organizations (Connor
and Prahalad, 1996; Ghoshal and Moran, 1996). Responses to this criticism are two-fold.
First, transaction cost economics does not require that all individuals act opportunistically all
of the time. Rather, it assumes that some individuals will act opportunistically some of the
time (Ghoshal and Moran, 1996)DEMO Secondly, as stated by Williamson (1996b):
The main purposes DEMO by invoking opportunism are these:
(a) it avoids the contractual naivete that arises when contract as
mere promise (unsupported by credible commitments) is
invoked and (b) it invites the identification, explication, and
mitigation of hazards that have their origins in opportunism.
Neither of these DEMO scholars to regard economic agents as
mean spirited or to behave in a manner unconstrained by
morality. (p. 50)
In summary, while DEMO are numerous valid criticisms of transaction cost economics, it has
remained DEMO predominant theoretical explanation of boundary choice” (Poppo and Zenger,
1998, p. 853).
2.7 Comparison to related theories
Transaction cost economics is DEMO related to property rights theory, agency theory and the
resource-based view DEMO the firm. Table 2.4 provides a brief comparison of some of the major
features these theories.
Property rights theory is based on the idea DEMO a transaction involves the exchange of
property rights (Demsetz, 1967). These property rights include the right to use an asset, the
right to appropriate returns from an asset and the right to change the DEMO or substance of an
asset. Under property rights theory, the economic DEMO is to ensure property rights are
allocated between firms appropriately in order to maximize wealth (Mahoney, 2005). The

unit of analysis in property rights theory is the institution or DEMO Property rights theory is
based on the same human assumptions as transaction cost economics but emphasizes
different key variables. In property rights theory, these key variables are control rights to the
property, the extent of sunk cost investments and the complementarity between different
assets (Hart 1995; Joskow, 1985). Applying property rights theory to the question of how the
DEMO of a firm should be determined, Hart (1995) argues that DEMO boundaries are
chosen to optimally allocate control rights over the property between the parties to the
transaction.
Agency theory focuses on the relationship between DEMO and agents. Agency
relationships arise when one individual depends on the actions of another. The agent is the
one taking action and the principal DEMO the individual depending on the agent. Under agency
theory, the economic DEMO is to structure the agency relationship to minimize agency
costs (Pratt DEMO Zeckhauser, 1985). Agency costs include the costs of monitoring the DEMO,
bonding expenditures incurred to reassure the principal and the costs resulting from conflicts
of interest between the principal and agent (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). The unit of analysis
in agency theory is the contract between the principal and agent. The key variables in agency
theory are DEMO conflict, differences in risk preferences between principal and agent, and
measurement difficulties related to the effort of the agent. Agency theory is focused DEMO the
separation of ownership and control (Williamson, 1996a). Its indirect application to the
question of firm boundaries focuses on minimizing agency costs DEMO to the transaction.
The resource-based view of the firm is based on the idea that competitive advantage is
derived from the possession of valuable, rare, inimitable and nonsubstitutable (“VRIN”)
resources (Eisenhardt and Martin, DEMO). The unit of analysis in the resource-based view is
routines and bounded rationality is an underlying human assumption. The key variables in
the DEMO view are the VRIN attributes of resources. Applied to the question of firm
boundaries, the resource-based view focuses on the acquisition of those resources that are
needed to support a firm’s competence and strategic direction and DEMO disposition of those
resources that are not needed even though the resulting governance choices may not be the
most efficiency when viewed on a DEMO by transaction basis (Tsang 2000). A closely
related theory to DEMO resource-based view is the dynamic capabilities view. It builds on the
resource-based view and focuses on the ability of firms to generate new capabilities DEMO
resources that have the VRIN attributes. Specifically, dynamic capabilities are defined DEMO
“the firm’s ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external DEMO to
address rapidly changing environments” (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997, p. 516).
2.7.1 Competing or complementary theories
29
Much of the literature on theories DEMO the firms views these theories as competing theories
where one is correct and the others incorrect (see, for example, the debates in Connor and
Prahalad, 1996; Foss, 1996; Ghoshal and Moran, 1996; DEMO and Zander, 1992; Perrow,
1986; Williamson, 1996b). In recent years, a number of researchers have begun to look at the
theories of the firm as complementary rather than as competing (Schilling and Steensma,
2002; Silverman, 1999; Steensma and Corley, 2001). DEMO and Corley (2001)
characterized this view as asking ‘when does DEMO theory apply?’ rather than ‘which theory is
correct?’ Silverman (DEMO) integrated ideas from transaction cost economics with the
resource-based view in DEMO at decisions of firms to diversify into other industries and
concluded that “while conflicts between the two theories do exist, the strong
complementarities between them should not be ignored” (p. 1123). Steensma and Corley
(DEMO) and Schilling and Steensma (2002) looked at technology-sourcing decisions and
DEMO that transaction cost economics, the resource-based view and an options perspective
DEMO complementary roles in the choice of firm boundaries. This view that different theories
of the firm are complementary is the one adopted in this DEMO While transaction cost
economics is the primary lens used to view boundary choice decisions, other lenses are
considered where they are helpful in understanding the specific circumstances of
commercializing new technologies arising from university research.
2.7.2 DEMO for choice of transaction cost economics
This thesis addresses the issue of how new technologies arising from university research are
commercialized. More specifically, it is concerned with the question of how the activities
involved in commercializing DEMO new technology should be organized. Transaction cost
economics was selected as the primary theoretical basis for this research because it most
directly relates to DEMO choice of firm boundaries. Boundary choice “focuses on the operating
parts and asks which activities should be performed within the firm, and which outside it, and
why” (Williamson, 1981, p. 549). The other DEMO discussed above have implications for
the choice of firm boundaries but are primarily focused on other issues. The unit of analysis
in transaction cost DEMO, the transaction, is also well suited to the study of the
commercialization of new technologies arising from university research. Commercializing a
new technology DEMO technology development, product development (Shane, 2004) and
supporting activities such as manufacturing, distribution and marketing. Thus, there are a
number of DEMO activities that need to be coordinated either through markets or hierarchies
30
(i.e., we have transactions). Nonetheless, as indicated earlier, DEMO from other theories will
be considered in developing the hypotheses tested in this thesis.
2.8 Special issues related to commercializing new technologies
2.8.1 The DEMO of innovation
Due to issues of potentially weak property rights and the need for responsiveness to changing
conditions, Williamson (1991) suggests that transaction cost economics not be applied
uncritically to the special issues of commercializing DEMO technologies though he suggests
that the general framework is applicable. The work of Teece has been particularly important
in looking at governance structures involving DEMO commercialization of new technologies.
Teece (1986) identifies the appropriability of a technology and the requirement for
specialized complementary assets, such as manufacturing capabilities and distribution
networks, as two key factors in the choice of governance structures for commercializing new
technologies. The work of Teece and others also DEMO that the need to coordinate various
tasks in the innovation process can result in significant transaction costs if a market
governance structure is adopted (Teece, 1996, Arora et al., 2001). Teece (1986) suggests that
the choice of governance structure is a critical factor in determining DEMO much of the profit
from a new technology is captured by the inventor.
Teece (2000) also specifically considers the issues facing an individual DEMO These
situations are similar to that facing an academic researcher/university in commercializing a
new technology arising from university research since universities are not DEMO the business of
producing commercial goods or services and lack the complementary assets needed to
commercialize the new technologies developed through university research (Shane, 2004b).
Teece (2000) identifies the following alternatives open to the individual inventor:
(1) licensing the technology to incumbent firms who DEMO
have the necessary complementary assets in place; (2) using
intellectual DEMO as collateral to raise debt funds to
establish an organization to exploit the technology; (3)
exchanging the patent for equity in a DEMO venture-funded firm;
(4) exchanging the intellectual property for cash or equity in an
established firm. (p. 55)
31
The first of these options represents a market governance structure while DEMO other three
represent hierarchy governance structures (see section 2.6.1).
2.8.2 DEMO for technology
The discussion on governance structures presumes the existence of effective markets. In the
case of the commercialization of new technologies arising from DEMO research, this
means effective markets for technology. Markets for technology are DEMO for “intellectual
property that is licensed and its close substitutes” (U.S. DEMO of Justice, 1995, p. 8).
Markets for technology represent a method for firms to acquire the right to use a new
technology DEMO are an alternative to developing the new technology in house. In the case of
commercializing new technologies arising from university research, markets for technology
allow the university/researcher to sell certain rights to a new technology DEMO firms that will put
the technology into use by producing new products or services based on the innovation or by
using the technology in DEMO production or other processes.
A number of difficulties to having effective markets for technology have been identified
(Teece, 1986). These difficulties are DEMO result of information asymmetry and uncertainty
(Shane, 2003). The nature of information creates problems in transferring information
between parties that do not DEMO in transferring goods or services. In the absence of
intellectual property protection, if an owner of information discloses that information to a
prospective buyer, the buyer now knows the information and no longer has a need to bargain
for access to it. But if the owner of the DEMO does not disclose it, the potential buyer
cannot evaluate the value DEMO it and, consequently, will not be willing to pay for information
which may turn out to be worthless to him (Arrow, 1962)DEMO Arrow’s paradox of disclosure
results from the combined effect of information asymmetry and the difficulties in protecting
intellectual property and implies that information that DEMO legal protection cannot be sold
through markets.
The high level of uncertainty related to new technologies also creates problems in the
market. One source DEMO this uncertainty relates to the technical development of the technology.
The research by Thursby, Jensen and Thursby (2001) discussed earlier in this chapter (see
section 2.4.3) shows the early stage of development of most DEMO inventions. A second
source of uncertainty relates to whether markets exist for products or services derived from
the technology (Shane, 2004). These DEMO levels of uncertainty make it difficult for
prospective buyers to evaluate the technology. The uncertainties also create bargaining
32
problems as the seller of the technology will often have a DEMO different view of the
value of the technology than a potential buyer (Shane, 2003).
Despite the challenges of transacting through markets for DEMO, there is evidence that
markets for technology exist and are becoming DEMO important. Chesbrough (2003)
argues that we have entered a world DEMO ‘open innovation’ where firms increasingly look
outside the boundaries of the firm to acquire new technologies from other firms and to
transfer to other DEMO technologies they have invented that do not fit their business plans.
One of the reasons Chesbrough cites for this change is the emergence of DEMO options for
ideas that are not commercialized by the firm where they are invented (i.e., the emergence of
markets for technology).
Arora DEMO al. (2001) argue that markets for technology improve the efficency of the
innovation process by allowing for the division of innovative labour. Firms DEMO specialize in
whatever components of the innovation process they have comparative advantage in. For
some, this may be research and development activities that lead to the invention and
development of new technologies. For others, this may be in the production and sale of goods
and services derived from DEMO new technologies. Arora et al. found evidence that markets
for technology do, in fact, exist and are growing in importance. The worldwide market DEMO
technologies is estimated at US$35-50 billion annually and is growing (Arora DEMO al., 2001).
Gans and Stern (2003) examined how the DEMO of markets for technology affects the
commercialization strategies available to technology entrepreneurs. They argue that inventors
have two strategic options available to them. They DEMO compete in the product market by
developing, producing and selling goods DEMO services based on the technology or they can
compete in the ‘market for ideas’ by transferring rights to their technology to established
firms who DEMO in the product market selling products or services based on the technology.
Gans and Stern argue that the two key factors affecting this strategic DEMO are the ability of
the firm to exclude others from copying the technology and the firm’s position relative to any
specialized complementary assets needed DEMO commercialize the technology.
2.9 Summary
The literature on the commercialization of university research and the literature on economic
theories of the firm suggest a DEMO of implications for the commercialization of new
technologies. First, governance structures DEMO to be important for the successful
33
commercialization of new technologies. Nonetheless, a focus on governance structures has
been absent in the literature on the commercialization of new technologies arising DEMO
university research with the exception of a brief mention by Shane (DEMO).
Second, the choice of governance structures is affected by transaction DEMO Under
transaction cost economics theory, these attributes are the existence of DEMO assets,
uncertainty and frequency. Looking more specifically at the commercialization of new
technologies, key transaction attributes that have been identified are the ability to exclude
others from using the technology and access to specialized complementary DEMO
Third, in applying transaction cost economics to the commercialization of new
DEMO, it is important to consider carefully the governance structures that may DEMO in
this specific environment, the specific attributes of new technologies that DEMO affect
transaction costs and the ramifications of selecting specific governance structures in light of
these specific attributes. That is, it is important to tailor the application of transaction cost
economics to the specifics of the situation DEMO considered (Williamson, 2002).
Chapter 3
Build, Rent and Sell – Governance Structures for Commercializing
New Technologies
In this chapter, difficulties with the traditional approach to classifying the methods used to
commercialize new technologies arising from university research (licensing vs. start-up) are
identified and a proposal for a new method of categorization that links to the concept of
governance structures discussed in the preceding DEMO is presented.
This chapter is organized as follows. First, problems with DEMO licensing vs. start-up
dichotomy are identified. Then, a new method of DEMO is proposed. The rationale
for the proposed new method is discussed and criteria for the categories are developed.
Finally, the benefits of the proposed categorization scheme are presented.
3.1 Limitations of the licensing vs. start-up approach DEMO analyzing methods of
commercialization
Section 2.4.1 describes the existing literature on the use of licensing and start-ups as
categories for analyzing the methods used DEMO commercialize new technologies arising from
university research. In this section, some DEMO the more significant limitations of this system for
categorizing the methods used to commercialize university research are described and why
these limitations are important DEMO indicated.
The primary limitation of the licensing vs. start-up system is that it reflects the legal form
rather than the substance of the method DEMO to commercialize the technology. Licenses
represent an “agreement … between two parties, where the owner of the technology
(licensor) permits the other party (licensee) to share the rights to use the technology”
(AUTM, DEMO, p. 42, emphasis added). The extent of the sharing of these rights to use the
technology can vary widely. Licensing a technology DEMO a non-exclusive basis to a number of
firms with the researcher/university continuing to develop and market the technology
represents a limited form of DEMO In these cases, the researcher/university retains the
majority of the DEMO and benefits of ownership of the technology. These benefits include the
ability to benefit from future development of the technology and the risks include DEMO risk of
technological obsolescence. Licensing the technology on an exclusive basis to an established
firm for substantially all of the economic life of the DEMO with the researcher/university
34
35
retaining no rights to ownership of improvements in the technology represents DEMO very
different form of sharing of the rights to the technology. In these cases, the
researcher/university transfers the majority of the risks and benefits of ownership of the
technology to the licensee. It is the DEMO who benefits from future development of the
technology and incurs the risk of technological obsolescence. In these cases, the
researcher/university has, in DEMO, sold the technology to the licensee. This discussion
demonstrates that the DEMO vs. start-up classification scheme, by focusing on the legal form
of DEMO transaction, fails to capture the substance of the method used to DEMO the
technology. Shane (2002) recognizes this limitation, in part, when he identifies that licensing
to inventors typically represents, in substance, the DEMO of a start-up company.
A second limitation of the licensing and start-up categories is that they are not distinct. For
example, a start-up firm founded by a researcher may need to license the technology from his
DEMO her university if the university holds the intellectual property rights to the technology. This
situation involves both creation of a start-up firm and licensing.
DEMO, the categories are not comprehensive. Most of the discussion of start-ups DEMO on
start-ups that develop new products or services based on the technology. As indicated in
section 2.8.2, this is not the only way that start-ups can commercialize an invention. Start-ups
can commercialize new technologies either through DEMO product market or the market for
technologies. The product market refers to situations where the start-up launches a product
based on the technology. The DEMO for technologies refers to situations where the start-up
commercializes the technology by “identifying and executing agreements with other firms –
usually incumbents – who DEMO as conduits for commercializing technology to the product
market” (Gans and DEMO, 2003, p. 336). These agreements often take the form of licensing
arrangements. Arora, Fosfuri and Gambardella (2001) emphasize the emergence in recent
years of markets for technologies as an important method of commercializing DEMO
technologies. However, little attention has been paid in the literature on DEMO
technology transfer to start-ups that compete through the market for technologies. These
start-ups face a different set of risks than do start-ups in the DEMO market. Specifically,
they do not face the risks associated with acquiring the skills and complementary assets, such
as manufacturing capabilities and distribution networks, needed to commercialize the
technology but face the contracting hazards that exist in markets for technologies (Arora,
Fosfuri and Gambardella, 2001; Gans and Stern, 2003). These start-ups face risks similar to
those faced by university technology transfer offices attempting to license new technologies
to existing DEMO and very different from those faced by start-ups in the product market.
36
Rambus Inc. is a firm founded by two university professors that DEMO, develops and
markets chip-to-chip interface solutions that enhance the performance and DEMO
of its customers' chip and system products” (Rambus, 2002, p. 1). Rambus does not
manufacture chips rather it “sell[s] licenses to DEMO and system companies who
then incorporate our interface products into their chips and systems” (Rambus, 2002, p. 2).
Rambus is an example of a start-up that operates in the market for technologies rather than DEMO
the product market. Certicom and Senesco, described in the chapter 6, are also examples of
start-ups that operate in the market for technologies. DEMO licensing vs. start-up approach does
not recognize the differences in start-ups that operate in markets for products compared to
those that operate in markets DEMO technology.
An objective of this thesis is to better understand which methods of commercialization are
appropriate for a particular new technology. Is there a DEMO choice as to how to commercialize
(i.e., are all choices equal?) or do certain methods suit certain technologies? If the latter is the
case, it is important to understand and recognize the substance of these methods. As
illustrated above, the licensing vs. start-up system of diverse, indistinct and non-
comprehensive categories does not do this. Therefore, there DEMO a need for a comprehensive
framework that 1) reflects the substance DEMO than the legal form of commercialization
activities, 2) reflects the variety of approaches to commercializing university research (e.g.,
creation of new firms, sale of technology to existing firms), and 3) reflects multiple DEMO
of commercialization (i.e., does not just subdivide either the start-up or licensing categories).
In the next section, a classification approach that attempts to address these issues is proposed.
3.2 Build, rent or sell: DEMO proposed categorization scheme
To address the issues identified above, the following DEMO for categorizing the methods
used to commercialize new technologies arising from university research is proposed. The
descriptions that follow are from the perspective of DEMO university/researcher rather than from
the perspective of the firm that commercializes the technology. It is proposed that there are
three primary methods of DEMO new technologies arising from university
research: 1) Build – creating a new business based on the technology, 2) Rent – ongoing
development DEMO marketing of the technology to established firms that use the technology in
their businesses and 3) Sell – disposition of the technology to an established firm.
The build option involves the creation of a new business DEMO on the technology and
reflects situations where the technology forms the basis for the development of a new firm to
37
exploit the invention. This new firm acquires or develops the complementary DEMO needed
to commercialize the technology.
The rent option involves ongoing development and marketing of the technology to firms
that use the technology in their DEMO and reflects situations where the right to use
technology is ‘rented,’ typically through a licensing arrangement, to firms to use in their
businesses for a fee. The university/researcher retains ownership of the technology and DEMO
often involved in enhancing the technology so that it can continue to mine the technology for
additional revenues. Often, the technology is rented to more than one firm.
The sell option involves disposition of the technology DEMO an established firm and reflects
situations where the technology is ‘sold’ to an existing firm. The established firm typically
has the complementary assets needed DEMO commercialize the technology. The technology may
be sold outright or licensed on an exclusive basis so that the licensee obtains substantially all
of the DEMO and benefits of ownership of the technology. The university/research typically
retains no ongoing rights to the technology or its future enhancements.
The build DEMO differs from the rent option in that building involves developing and
selling products or services based on the technology while renting involves selling rights DEMO
use the technology to others who develop and sell products based on the technology (i.e., the
build option operates through the product market DEMO the rent option operates through the
market for technologies). The build option differs from the sell option in that, in the build
option, the technology forms the core around which a new business is formed while, in the
sell option, the technology supplements an existing business. DEMO difference between the rent
option and the sell option is analogous to selling the fruit of a tree versus selling the tree. The
rent DEMO is similar to selling the fruit of a tree. The technology (DEMO tree) continues to be
grown and harvested by the university/researcher DEMO limited rights to use the technology
(the fruit) are sold to one or more firms. The sell option is similar to selling the DEMO The
university/researcher retains no ongoing economic interest in the technology.
3.3 Examples of build, rent and sell approaches to commercialization
Each of the build, rent and sell options can be implemented using various legal structures
such as licensing arrangements and the creation of start-up companies. For example, the
Association of University Technology Manager’s Licensing Survey for 2003 indicates that
DEMO of licenses were to start-up firms (AUTM, 2004). A large of number of these start-ups
38
are likely to be involved in developing new products or services DEMO on the technologies
(i.e., they are commercializing the technology using the build option). DALSA, described in
chapter 6, is an example DEMO a start-up using the build option.
The rent option may be implemented through non-exclusive licensing such as with the
Waterloo Emitter™ for the bio-enhanced DEMO of contaminated groundwater
(University of Waterloo, 2005) but also may DEMO the use of intermediaries (Arora et al.,
2001) and start-up companies. Rambus, described in section 3.1, and Certicom, described in
chapter 6, are examples of such start-up companies.
An example of the sell option involving licensing is Florida State University’s exclusive
license of a patented DEMO for the synthesis of the anticancer drug Taxol to Bristol-Myers
Squibb (DEMO and Resnick, 2001). Genetech Inc., a start-up company founded in 1976,
operated using a sell model in its early years though DEMO has since become a fully integrated
pharmaceutical company. Genentech’s first two discoveries, human insulin and Factor VIII,
were licensed to pharmaceutical companies who manufactured and marketed drugs based on
these discoveries (Genentech, 2005). DEMO, described in chapter 6, is also an example of a
start-up using the sell option.
These examples illustrate that the build, rent and sell options can be implemented in a
variety of legal forms and, therefore, reaffirm the importance of having a categorization
scheme that reflects the economic substance of these transactions rather than their legal form.
Table 3.1 DEMO the characteristics of the build, rent and sell options; and the examples
described in this section.
3.4 Rationale for build, rent and sell categories
The rationale for the build, rent and sell categories is based on the application on the concept
of governance structures discussed in section DEMO to the specific circumstances of the
commercialization of university research.
In applying transaction cost economics to the commercialization of university research, it
is necessary to identify the transaction involved and the possible governance structures. “A
transaction DEMO when a good or service is transferred across a technologically separable
interface. One stage of activity terminates and another begins” (Williamson, 1985, p. 1). In
the commercialization of university research, the transaction is the transfer of a new
technology from a research setting to a commercialization DEMO This transaction involves
39
two groups of related activities and their supporting assets. One activity DEMO the development
of the technology and the assets supporting this activity include codified information
concerning the innovation, related intellectual property rights and the tacit know-how of the
researcher. The other activity is the production and delivery DEMO products based on the
technology. The operating assets for this activity consist of the complementary assets needed
to commercialize the technology. Manufacturing capabilities and DEMO networks are
examples of the other complementary assets needed to put technological innovations into
commercial use (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997).

The build, rent and sell categories reflect differences in organizational form. Market
governance refers to situations where transactions are carried on with third DEMO outside the
firm through the use of contracts and, in this DEMO, reflects situations where the
university/researcher, who retains ownership of the technology, and third parties, who own
the complementary assets needed to DEMO products and services based on the technology,
transact through the use of contracts, often non-exclusive licensing arrangements. The rent
option represents a market form of governance. Hierarchies refer to situations where the
transactions are internalized DEMO that the economic activities involved in the transaction occur
within a single firm. In both the build and sell options, the technology and the
complementary assets required to commercialize the technology are brought together in a
DEMO firm. In the build option, they are brought together in a DEMO created firm while in the
sell option they are brought together in an established firm. Figure 3.1 depicts the differing
organizational structures involved in DEMO build, rent and sell options.
This examination of governance structures reinforces DEMO concerns with the licensing vs.
start-up view of the methods of commercialization. It is difficult to link the licensing vs.
start-up dichotomy to the DEMO on markets and hierarchies. These difficulties relate
primarily to the fact that the licensing and start-up categories do not align well with the
market DEMO hierarchy governance structures. Shane (2002) recognizes this difficulty by
arguing that licensing to firms founded by inventors represents, in substance, a hierarchy
DEMO structure rather than a market one (i.e., that licensing cannot always be equated
with a market governance structure). Similarly, Rambus and Certicom are start-up firms but
ones that operate through a market governance structure DEMO the established firms that put
their technologies into use. In these cases, commercialization by a start-up firm cannot be
equated with a hierarchy governance structure. In summary, these examples show that a
simple ‘licensing = market, start-up = hierarchy’ model does not adequately reflect the
complexities that exist in the business models used to commercialize new technologies
arising from university DEMO
3.5 Criteria distinguishing the build, rent and sell categories
For the DEMO, rent and sell categories to be useful, it must be possible to uniquely place the
commercialization of a particular technology into one of DEMO categories. Two criteria are
proposed for doing so. The first criterion is whether a new firm or an established firm
commercializes the technology. Commercialization DEMO a new firm involves a different set of
risks than those faced by an established firm commercializing a technology (Teece, 1996).
These risks include the problems of acquiring the skills (Shane, 2002) and complementary
assets (Teece, 1986) necessary to commercialize the technology.

The second criterion relates to the DEMO of the property rights to the technology. The
ownership of the property rights can be evaluated based on “three elements: (a) the right to
use the asset …, (b) the right to appropriate returns from the asset …, and (c) the right to
change the asset’s form and/or substance” (Williamson, 1991, p. 287). Some rights to use the
technology will always be held by the commercializing DEMO Otherwise, it would be unable
to commercialize the technology. The right DEMO use a technology also implies the right to
exclude others from using the technology. A firm that controls ownership of a technology has
42
the right to exclude others from using the technology. Thus the DEMO to exclude others from
using the technology is an important consideration in assessing the ownership of the property
rights to the technology. The right DEMO appropriate returns from the technology will be shared
in some form between the university/researcher and the commercializing firm. This sharing
may take the DEMO of fixed payments, payments dependent on use of the technology (e.g.,
running royalties), equity in the commercializing firm or some combination DEMO these. This
sharing varies in nature from fixed contractually determined amounts though to residual
returns (i.e., the profit resulting from the sale of DEMO products after all expenses). Retention of
residual returns by the university/researcher suggests that they have retained the majority of
the rights to DEMO returns while fixed returns suggest that they have transferred the
majority of the rights to appropriate returns to the commercializing firm. The right to DEMO
the technology’s form and/or substance reflects the university’s/researcher’s rights to benefit
from further enhancements of the technology. (e.g., to develop and DEMO improvements or
enhancements to the technology). If the university/researcher retains the rights to benefit
from future enhancements of the technology, this is evidence that they have retained
ownership of the property rights to the DEMO An overall evaluation of these three
elements leads to an assessment of whether the university/research, or a firm created by them
to market the technology to established firms, have retained the majority of the property
rights to the technology or whether they have transferred the majority of DEMO property rights
to the commercializing firm.
Table 3.2 summarizes how these criteria relate to the three proposed categories of
commercialization. The table also makes DEMO that each proposed category represents a
unique combination of the three criteria.
Together these criteria specify three distinct governance structures for commercializing
technologies. The DEMO model reflects a hierarchy governance structure where the
technology forms the core of the business and the complementary assets needed to
commercialize the technology DEMO acquired by the new business. The rent model reflects a
market governance structure where the technology and the complementary assets needed to
commercialize it DEMO held in two (or more) separate firms transacting through markets for
technology. The sell model reflects a hierarchy structure where the technology is DEMO to and
incorporated into an existing firm that has the complementary assets needed to
commercialize the technology.

3.6 Implications and benefits of the build, rent or sell approach
The build, rent or sell approach has a number of implications and benefits for understanding
the commercialization of new technologies arising DEMO university research. First, the
approach is easily reconcilable to the broader DEMO on commercializing innovations. For
example, Teece (2000) identifies the following DEMO options available to independent
inventors and stand-alone laboratories:
(1) licensing the technology to incumbent firms who already
have the necessary complementary assets DEMO place; (2) using
intellectual property as collateral to raise debt DEMO to
establish an organization to exploit the technology; (3)
exchanging the patent for equity in a new venture-funded firm;
(4) DEMO the intellectual property for cash or equity in an
established firm. (DEMO 55)
The first of these options is comparable to the rent option; the second and third options are
comparable to the build option and the fourth option is comparable to the sell option. Teece
argues DEMO appropriability conditions and control of complementary assets are the key factors
in determining which of these options is preferable in a particular circumstance.
44
The build, rent or sell approach also better reflects the ideas of markets and hierarchies
than does the licensing vs. start-up approach. The DEMO on governance structures enables
researchers to draw on the extensive literature on markets and hierarchies and on the
literature on markets for technology (see sections 2.6.5 and 2.8.2) to study the
commercialization of new technologies arising from university research. This is done in
chapter 4 where transaction cost DEMO theory is used to develop hypotheses related to
the methods of commercializing university research. It is significant to note that the
hypotheses developed from DEMO proposed approach differ in important ways from those
developed using the licensing vs. start-up dichotomy. For example, there are a significant
number of licensing arrangements that will be identified as hierarchy governance structures
using the proposed DEMO The Association of University Technology Manager’s
Licensing Survey for 2003 indicates that 87% of licenses were to existing companies (52.5%
of licenses were to small companies and 34.5% of licenses were to large companies). A
DEMO number of these licenses (35% of licenses to large companies and DEMO of licenses
to small companies) are exclusive (AUTM, 2004). DEMO of these licenses will be classified
as sell transactions resulting in a hierarchy governance structure using the proposed
approach. These licenses are grouped with DEMO licensing arrangements and considered
market governance structures under the licensing vs. start-up approach.
An important third benefit of the proposed approach is that it DEMO the governance
structure in place at the time when the invention is commercialized. The licensing vs. start-up
approach focuses on the point in time DEMO a technology leaves the university. However,
there is evidence that significant time can pass between the point when a technology leaves
the university DEMO when it is commercialized (see section 2.4.3). The licensing vs. DEMO
approach fails to take into account the significant changes that can occur between the time a
technology leaves the university setting and when it DEMO put into commercial use.
3.7 Conclusion
In this chapter, difficulties with DEMO licensing vs. start-up dichotomy were identified and a
proposal for a new method of categorization that takes into account the variety of methods of
DEMO was developed. In the next chapter, this approach is used to DEMO a
number of hypotheses relating the characteristics of new technologies arising from university
research to the governance structures used to commercialize them.
Chapter 4
Hypotheses
In this chapter, the hypotheses that will be tested are developed. Two sets of hypotheses are
proposed in this chapter. The DEMO set is related to firm characteristics associated with the
strategic governance choices of build, rent or sell. The second set of hypotheses relate to the
link between certain characteristics of new technologies (i.e., transaction attributes) and the
strategic governance choices made in their commercialization.
4.1 Hypotheses related DEMO governance choices and firm characteristics
The build, rent and sell typology DEMO governance choices proposed in chapter 3 is derived from
theory related to the concepts of markets and hierarchies. While this typology has a strong
DEMO basis, it must also be anchored in empirical experience to be DEMO (Meyer, Tsui
and Hinings, 1993). Accordingly, hypotheses are derived that link the theoretical
classifications to specific firm characteristics. These characteristics relate DEMO the markets the
firms derive their revenue from and how they allocate their resources.
4.1.1 Revenue sources
As discussed in section 2.8.2, firms may operate in markets for products or markets for
technology (Arora et al., 2001; Gans and Stern, 2003; Giuri and Luzzi, 2005). It is expected
that the strategic governance choice made in commercializing a DEMO technology will affect
the extent to which a firm operates in each of these markets. When the build option is used to
commercialize a DEMO, a new firm is created to produce goods or services based DEMO the
new technology. Therefore, it is expected that the new firm DEMO derive its revenue primarily
from product market activities. Revenue from product market activity includes revenue from
sales of products; long-term contracts for the provision of products or services; services and
support; and software products. When DEMO rent option is used to commercialize a technology,
the technology is marketed to established firms who use it in their business. Similarly, when
the sell option is used to commercialize a technology, the technology is disposed of to an
established firm that uses it in its business. DEMO both the rent and sell situations, the established
firm(s) that commercialize the technology are expected to derive their revenue primarily
from the DEMO market while the university/inventor, or a firm created by them DEMO the
purpose of marketing the technology to other firms, is expected DEMO derive its revenue
primarily from technology market activity. Revenue from technology market activity is
45
46
revenue that is derived from intellectual property (U.S. Department of Justice, 1995). This
leads to the following hypotheses:
H1a: The DEMO option is positively associated with new firms
created to commercialize technologies deriving revenue
primarily from product market activity.
H1b: The rent and sell options are positively associated with
new firms created to commercialize technologies deriving
revenue DEMO from technology market activity.
4.1.2 Allocation of resources
The allocation of internal resources between different business activities is a critical element
in implementing a DEMO strategy (Porter, 1980). Therefore, it is expected that a DEMO
strategic governance choice will affect the allocation of resources to certain business
activities. As discussed in section 2.4.3, most new technologies arising from university
research are at an early stage. Consequently, technology development and follow-on product
development are important activities in commercializing a new technology (Shane, 2004)DEMO
Technology development activity is reflected in a firm’s spending on research and
development activities. Once products have been developed, they need to be produced and
sold in product markets. Consequently, the production of goods and services based on the
new technology is another significant business activity involved in DEMO commercialization of
a new technology.
The build option involves a hierarchy governance structure where both the technology
development activities and production activities are expected DEMO be performed by the new
firm created to commercialize the technology. The rent option involves a market governance
structure where the technology development activities DEMO expected to be performed by the
university/inventor, or a firm DEMO by them for the purpose of marketing the technology to
other firms, and the production activities are expected to be performed by the established
firms that produce goods or services based on the technology. When the DEMO option is used to
commercialize a new technology, the university/inventor, or a firm created by them for the
purpose of marketing the DEMO to other firms, is expected to perform the technology
development activities DEMO to the point when the technology is disposed of to an established
47
firm. The established firm is expected to perform any subsequent technology DEMO
activity and the production activity. This analysis leads to the following hypotheses:
H2a: The build option is positively associated with new firms
created to commercialize technologies expending resources on
both technology development activities and production
DEMO
H2b: The rent and sell options are positively associated with
new DEMO created to commercialize technologies expending
resources on technology development activities but not on
production activities.
4.2 Hypotheses related to transaction attributes
The basic premise DEMO transaction cost economics is that the decision to perform an activity
inside or outside the firm should be based on the relative efficiency of DEMO the activity
in these two environments. Transactions should be performed inside the firm when the costs
of transacting in the market are higher than DEMO costs of performing the activity internally.
These transaction costs include the costs of negotiating, monitoring and enforcing contracts
with outside parties and the costs of managing internally governed exchanges (Coase, 1937;
Poppo and Zenger, 1998). Transaction cost economics identifies three principal dimensions
affecting transaction costs. DEMO are the extent to which the transaction involves transaction
specific assets, DEMO related to the transaction and the frequency with which
transactions recur (DEMO, 1999).
Asset specificity refers “to the degree to which an DEMO can be redeployed to alternative
uses and by alternative users without sacrifice of productive value” (Williamson, 1996a, p.
59). According to transaction cost economics, market governance has high transaction costs
when dealing with assets of high specificity (Williamson, 1975). “Specific assets trigger a
threat DEMO opportunistic behavior that requires costly contractual safeguards to deter” (Poppo
and DEMO, 1998, p. 853). Thus, in situations of high asset DEMO, more integrated
governance forms are preferred as they have the lower DEMO costs (Poppo and Zenger,
1998). In the commercialization of DEMO technologies arising from university research, the
48
two primary issues of asset specificity relate to the appropriability of DEMO technology and the
requirement for specialized complementary assets.
4.2.1 Appropriability of the technology
Appropriability relates to how easily and quickly potential competitors can imitate DEMO
technology. Winter (2000) identifies four mechanisms of appropriability: 1) patents and
related legal protection, 2) secrecy, 3) lead time and DEMO) control of complementary assets.
Strong intellectual property protection makes it more DEMO to imitate an innovation
(Teece, 1986; Williamson, 1991). “When … poorly protected intellectual capital … [is] at
issue, pure market arrangements expose the parties to recontracting hazards or appropriability
hazards. In such circumstances, hierarchical control structures may work better than pure
arms-length contracts” (Teece, DEMO and Shuen, 1997, p. 522). Where patents and related
legal protection are strong, the legal safeguards provided mitigate the threat of opportunistic
behavior. This suggests that strong patents or other legal protection support the
DEMO of technologies using a market governance structure (i.e., the rent option).
Empirical support for this relationship was found by Oxley (1999) DEMO examined technology
transfer alliances between U.S. and non-U.S. firms and found that, when intellectual property
protection was weak, firms adopted more hierarchical governance DEMO This leads to
the following hypothesis.
H3: The greater the patent DEMO other legal protection for the
technology, the greater the likelihood that DEMO technology will
be commercialized using the rent option.
Secrecy is another method of keeping others from appropriating the benefits of the
technology. Secrecy requires DEMO information about the technology be kept secret and,
therefore, opportunities DEMO trading in markets for technologies are limited if secrecy is to be
maintained. Two elements that make it easier to maintain secrecy and more DEMO for other
firms to transfer and imitate a technology are high levels of tacitness and complexity in the
knowledge inherent in the technology (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997). Tacit knowledge
refers to knowledge that DEMO be easily communicated and shared (Simonin, 1999).
“Complexity is usually defined according to dimensions that increase the difficulty of
comprehending how a DEMO (i.e., an organization, organism, device) functions or produces
some DEMO Simon (1962) defines a complex system as one that consists of many unique
and interacting elements, which have equally important effects on the outcomes produced by
49
the system.” (McEvily and Chakravarthy, 2002, p. 289). Complexity requires coordination to
enable rapid adjustment as components change over time. This DEMO facilitated by hierarchical
governance structures better than by market governance structures (DEMO and
Kusonoki, 2001). Therefore, high levels of tacitness and complexity suggest that the
technology be commercialized through a hierarchical governance structure (i.e., either the
build or sell options).
H4a: The greater the DEMO of the knowledge inherent in a
technology, the greater the likelihood DEMO the technology will
be commercialized using the build or sell options.
H4b: The greater the complexity of the knowledge inherent in a
technology, DEMO greater the likelihood that the technology will
be commercialized using the build or sell options.
Lead time reflects the fact that the threat of DEMO can be reduced even without
patent or other legal protection or secrecy if there exists a lead time before substitute
technologies can be developed. DEMO, because lead times before substitutes appear are
limited in duration, it is important to maximize the returns from the technology in the time
DEMO substitutes appear. A market governance structure facilitates this by making the
technology available to multiple established firms who have the manufacturing and
distribution capabilities DEMO bring products based on the technology to market quickly.
H5: The DEMO the risk of substitutes, the greater the
likelihood that the technology DEMO be commercialized using the
rent option.
4.2.2 Complementary assets
The complementary assets needed to commercialize the technology may be generic or
specialized to the DEMO (Teece, 1986). Assets that are specialized to the technology
increase the transaction costs of market governance. Therefore, the rent option is likely to be
less effective when specialized complementary assets are needed to commercialize DEMO
technology as it involves a market governance structure. Furthermore, Teece (1986) and
Gans and Stern (2003) suggest that situations where specialized complementary assets are
required to commercialize the technology pose significant hazards to new DEMO attempting to
50
compete with the existing firms that control these specialized complementary assets. DEMO is
the situation faced when the build option is used to commercialize a new technology. This
suggests that the sell option is likely to DEMO most effective when specialized complementary
assets are required to commercialize the technology.
H6: The greater the importance of specialized complementary
assets, the greater DEMO likelihood that the technology will be
commercialized using the sell option.
4.2.3 Uncertainty
Uncertainty is the second key dimension affecting transaction costs. Uncertainty makes DEMO
difficult to contract in markets for technology and increases market transaction costs in two
ways. Transaction costs are increased as a result of the DEMO of trying to anticipate uncertain
events and writing these into the contract. Secondly, costs arise because the transactions are
maladapted to the environment while the parties adjust to the changed circumstances (Poppo
and Zenger, 1998; Williamson, 1991). Empirical studies of the effect of uncertainty on the
choice of governance structures have produced contradictory evidence (Sutcliffe and Zaheer,
1998). Klein et al. (1990) argue that uncertainty has a DEMO of dimensions that may impact
governance structures differently. The two dimensions of uncertainty identified by Klein et
al. are volatility and diversity. Volatility reflects DEMO speed of change in the environment and
diversity reflects the number of sources of uncertainty in the environment. Klein et al. argue
that higher DEMO of volatility create problems in writing contracts and higher transaction
costs for market governance structures thus encouraging more integrated forms of
governance. Klein et DEMO argue that diversity leads to a desire for flexibility and that market
governance structures provide this flexibility.
Two important sources of uncertainty that have DEMO identified are technical and market
uncertainty (Schilling and Steensma, 2002; DEMO and Weber, 1984). Thus, it is
hypothesized that greater volatility related to technical and market uncertainty increases the
likelihood that technologies will DEMO commercialized using the build or sell options and that
greater dynamism related to technical and market uncertainty increases the likelihood that
technologies will be DEMO using the rent option.
H7a: The greater the volatility relating to DEMO uncertainty
associated with the technology, the greater the likelihood that
the technology will be commercialized using the build or sell
options.
H7b: The greater the volatility relating to market uncertainty
associated with the technology, the greater the likelihood that
the technology will be commercialized using the DEMO or sell
options.
H8a: The greater the dynamism relating to technical
DEMO associated with the technology, the greater the
likelihood that the technology DEMO be commercialized using the
rent option.
H8b: The greater the dynamism DEMO to market uncertainty
associated with the technology, the greater the likelihood DEMO
the technology will be commercialized using the rent option.
51
4.2.4 Frequency
The third dimension affecting transaction costs is the frequency with which transactions
DEMO The commercialization of new technologies arising from university research is an
environment where transactions between a specific researcher and a specific commercializing
firm are DEMO to be infrequent. Thus, it is expected that frequency of interaction DEMO not
be a distinguishing feature in this environment and, therefore, no hypotheses related to
frequency are proposed.
4.3 Summary of hypotheses tested
Table DEMO summarizes the hypotheses tested in this thesis. For the reasons set out in section
8.2, Hypotheses 3a and 3b related to tacitness and complexity are combined into a single
hypothesis. Likewise, Hypotheses 7a and 7b related to volatility and Hypotheses 8a and 9b
related to dynamism are combined DEMO single hypotheses related to volatility and dynamism
respectively.

Chapter 5
Methods
Three studies were conducted in the course of this DEMO Study #1 analyzes three start-ups
based on new technologies arising from research conducted at the University of Waterloo.
Study #2 examines the business activities DEMO a number of Canadian and U.S. public start-up
firms. Study #3 is a survey of university faculty members who have had new technologies
arising DEMO their academic research put into commercial use. Each of these studies uses
different methods. The use of multiple methods, known as triangulation, has DEMO benefit of
providing differing perspectives on the research question.
This chapter is organized as follows. First the concept of triangulation is discussed and its
DEMO and disadvantages for this particular research are discussed. This is followed by
detailed descriptions of the methods used in each of the three studies.
DEMO Triangulation
Triangulation is “the combination of methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon”
(Denzin, 1978, p. 291). Each of the three studies in this research uses different methods.
Study #1, the tale of the three start-ups, involves the detailed qualitative analysis of data
gathered from a variety of archival data sources. Study #2, the examination of public start-up
firms, involves the quantitative analysis of data gathered from archival data sources. Study
#3, the study of academic researchers involved in commercialization, DEMO the
quantitative analysis of data gathered using a survey document. Focused case studies and
studies of contracts, statistical analysis of secondary data and statistical analysis using field
data have all been used in the study of DEMO cost economics (Mahoney, 2005).
However, they have rarely been DEMO together as complementary sources of evidence.
The primary advantage attributed to triangulation is that the strengths of one method can
compensate for weaknesses in DEMO other methods (Baumard and Ibert, 2001; Jick, 1979).
When two or more methods support the same result, this “enhances our belief that the results
are valid and not a methodological artifact” (Bouchard, DEMO, p. 268). The primary weakness
attributed to triangulation is that, in general, there are no reliable methods for combining the
results of the various tests (Jick, 1979).
53
54
Study #1, the tale of three start-ups, has the advantage DEMO providing an in-depth analysis of
the three firms examined. This allows for an understanding of some of the subtleties of the
commercialization process that DEMO difficult to capture through quantitative means. However,
Study #1 involves the study of a very limited number of firms selected for their differences
DEMO than for their representativeness. Thus, Study #1 has weak external validity. DEMO #2,
the examination of public company start-up firms, is quantitative DEMO nature and provides
greater objectivity in its findings that Study #1. Study #2 involves both Canadian and U.S.
firms and uses secondary data from DEMO sources. Study #2 provides strengths related to
the reliability and external validity of the overall research. Study #3, the survey of academic
researchers, DEMO strengths related to the internal validity of the overall research. The survey is
designed to specifically measure the variables of interest whereas Studies #1 DEMO #2 use
secondary data that was originally prepared for other purposes. Enhanced internal validity is
an attribute commonly attributed to primary data such as DEMO collected in Study #3 (Baumard
and Ibert, 2001). Studies #1 and #2 also focus on instances of commercialization that
involved a start-up DEMO that eventually went public. Study #3 approaches commercialization
from the inventor side irrespective of how the new technology was commercialized. This
adds to the DEMO of the overall research findings. This discussion illustrates how
the three studies complement each other in terms of enhancing the reliability and validity of
DEMO overall research.
5.2 Study #1, a tale of three start-ups
The DEMO in Study #1 use archival data related to the three start-ups examined. The
primary sources of data used are documents issued by the start-ups DEMO filed with the
applicable securities regulators. Limited use is also made of information on the start-ups
websites. The information filed by these start-ups with DEMO applicable securities regulators
includes prospectuses, annual reports, material change reports, DEMO contracts and news
releases. This information is available from the date the firm became a public company.
A prospectus is a document issued by DEMO firm when it offers securities, such as shares in the
firm, to the public. Prospectuses are intended to ensure that potential investors receive DEMO,
true and plain disclosure of all material facts” (Ontario Securities DEMO, 1990, s 56(1)).
Prospectuses typically contain the following DEMO (U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, 2003):
 A description DEMO the company's properties and business;
55
 A description of the security to be offered for sale;DEMO
 Information about the management of the company; and
 Financial DEMO audited by independent accountants.
Annual reports are reports issued by a firm to its shareholders. Annual reports typically
include the following information:
 DEMO discussion and analysis – this is an analysis by management of a firm’s
past performance and its future prospects (Canadian Performance Reporting Board,
2004); and
 Audited financial statements.
Material change reports are required DEMO be filed by public companies whenever a material
change in the business of the company occurs. A material change is “a change in the
DEMO, operations or capital of the reporting issuer that would reasonably be DEMO to
have a significant effect on the market price or value of any of the securities of the
[company]” (Canadian Securities Administrators, 2003, p. 67).
The reliability of the data in these documents is DEMO by a number of factors. These
include the fact that substantial criminal and civil penalties can arise from filing false or
misleading information with DEMO securities commissions. In addition, these documents are
subject to review, in full or in part, by the applicable securities commission, a firm’s DEMO,
a firm’s lawyers and, in the case of a prospectus, a firm’s underwriters.
5.3 Study #2, an examination of public company start-ups
5.3.1 Sample
Study #2 uses two separate samples of public start-up firms DEMO have commercialized new
technologies arising from university research. The first sample is of Canadian companies
built on National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of DEMO (“NSERC”) funded
research. The second sample is of U.S. companies built on research conducted at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”).
56
The Canadian start-up sample is derived from companies listed in NSERC’s DEMO
Means Business publication. This publication profiles start-up companies that have their
origins in university research funded by NSERC (NSERC, 2002). NSERC is DEMO primary
source of funding for research in the natural sciences and engineering in Canada (NSERC,
2005). These natural sciences and engineering disciplines are an important source of
commercialized new technologies (Read, 2003). DEMO Means Business is a periodic
publication of NSERC and has been used in other research on the economic impacts of
academic start-ups (Vincett, DEMO). The Canadian start-up sample was constructed primarily
using the 2002 edition of the publication. This edition profiles 134 start-up companies. From
this list DEMO companies, those that became public companies were identified. Only public
companies DEMO included in the sample as being a public company brings obligations to
publicly report significant information about the company and it is this public DEMO
that is analyzed in this study. Public companies were identified through information
contained in Research Means Business, visits to the companies’ websites and through
searches of public company databases maintained by Canadian and U.S. securities regulators.
DEMO the 134 start-up companies listed in Research Means Business, 30 (22%) were found to be
public companies. The 1998 edition of Research Means Business was also reviewed. Most of
the companies included in the 1998 DEMO also appear in the 2002 edition. Nonetheless, one
additional public start-up DEMO identified bringing the total Canadian start-up sample to 31
firms.
The US start-up sample is based on MIT start-ups founded between 1980 and 1996 DEMO
went public as identified by Shane (2004). MIT is a DEMO source of start-up firms in
the United States and its commercialization activities have been the most widely studied (see,
for example, Agrawal DEMO Henderson, 2002; Neckar and Shane, 2003; and Shane, 2004)DEMO
Rough estimates by Shane (2001) suggest that MIT accounts for approximately7.5% of start-
ups founded to exploit new technologies arising from university research DEMO the United
States. Shane (2004) identified 23 public start-ups and the fact that these start-ups became
public companies was confirmed through searches of DEMO company databases maintained
by U.S. and Canadian securities regulators.
In summary, DEMO Canadian start-up sample consists of 31 firms and the U.S. start-up
sample consists of 23 firms for a total of 54 firms. These two DEMO may not be
representative of all start-ups created to commercialize new technologies arising from
university research. While NSERC funded research is an important source DEMO new
technologies, new technologies also result from university research not funded DEMO NSERC.
57
MIT start-ups also may not be representative of start-ups from other DEMO due to
geographic advantages and strong ties to the venture capital community (Shane, 2001).
Nonetheless, the samples represent important sources of new technologies and afford the
benefits arising from having two separate samples from DEMO countries and derived from
two different sources.
5.3.2 Measurement
This study involves comparisons between the method used to commercialize a new
technology and the DEMO activities of the start-up involved in commercializing the
technology.
5.3.2.1 Method of commercialization
The method of commercialization was classified as build, rent, sell, hybrid or development
stage. The criteria used for classifying the method as DEMO, rent or sell were those developed
in chapter 3. The method DEMO was classified as hybrid if commercialization of the
technology involved the combined efforts of the start-up and an established firm rather than
being commercialized DEMO by the start-up or an established firm. For example, the
technology DEMO have been commercialized through a joint venture or partnership with an
established firm with the start-up contributing manufacturing capabilities and the established
firm contributing DEMO and distribution capabilities to the joint venture. Start-ups were
classified as development stage if products based on the technology had not yet been put DEMO
commercial use. In some cases, multiple methods of commercialization were used DEMO the
start-up. In these cases, the method of commercialization used was DEMO based on the
primary method used.
5.3.2.2 Business activities of the start-up
The nature and extent of business activities of the start-up was captured DEMO four measures.
Two of these measures relate to the markets in which the start-up operates. The other two
measures relate to the allocation of DEMO resources to technology development activities
and to production activities.
58
5.3.2.2.1 Markets the start-up operates in
As discussed in section 2.8.2, firms may operate in markets for products and markets for
technology (Arora et al., 2001; Gans and Stern, 2003; Giuri and Luzzi, 2005). Two measures
are used to determine the extent to which DEMO start-ups operate in each of these markets.
Product market activity is measured by the percentage of the start-up’s total revenue that is
derived from DEMO or services.
Product market activity   = Product market revenue
Total revenue
Total revenue and product market revenue are measured in accordance with generally
DEMO accounting principles and are taken from the start-up’s most recent audited financial
statements. Product market revenue includes revenue from sales of products; long-term
contracts for the provision of products or services; services and support; and DEMO
products.
Technology market activity is measured by the percentage of the start-up’s total revenue
that is derived from intellectual property (U.S. Department of Justice, 1995).
Technology market activity   = Technology market revenue
Total revenue
Technology market revenue includes revenue from milestone payments, licensing fees and
royalties related to contracts allowing other firms to use the start-ups intellectual property.
DEMO from both product market activity and technology market activity is revenue
derived from other sources. These other sources include contract research and development
where DEMO start-up undertakes R&D activities related to another firm’s technology,
investment income and other miscellaneous sources of revenue.
59
5.3.2.2.2 Allocation of internal resources to technology development activities and to
DEMO activities
The allocation of internal resources between different business activities is a critical element
in implementing a firm’s strategy (Porter, 1980). Performing DEMO generates costs (Hope
and Hope, 1997) and, consequently, an DEMO of a firm’s costs can indicate the
emphasis the firm places on various business activities.
Technology development activity is measured by the percentage of DEMO start-up’s total
operating costs that is spent on research and development activities.
Technology development activity   = Research and development costs
Total operating costs
DEMO operating costs and research and development costs are measured in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and are taken from the start-ups most recent DEMO
financial statements. Research and development costs are measured net of any related
government assistance (e.g., R&D tax credits).
Production activity is DEMO by the percentage of the start-up’s total operating costs that
is spent on production activities.
Production activity   = Cost of goods sold
Total DEMO costs
Cost of goods sold reflects the costs incurred to purchase or produce the products sold by
the firm. Cost of goods sold includes DEMO cost of material and labor used in the production of
goods or services.
60
5.3.3 Procedures
The analyses use archival data related to the start-ups DEMO in the annual filings of the
start-ups with the applicable securities regulator. In the case of start-ups required to file
information with the Canadian DEMO regulators, this information is available through the
System for Electronic Document DEMO and Retrieval (‘SEDAR’) available at
http://www.sedar.com. In the case of start-ups required to file information with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange DEMO, this information is available through the Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis, DEMO Retrieval system (‘EDGAR’) available at
http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. The annual filings of start-ups typically include the
following information:
 Annual information DEMO – this document includes various information about the firm
including a description of the business of the firm (Canadian Securities Administrators,
2003);DEMO
 Management’s discussion and analysis – this is an analysis by management of a firm’s
past performance and its future prospects (Canadian Securities Administrators, 2003);
 Audited financial statements.
Annual filings with the U.S. DEMO and Exchange Commission on Form 10K contain
similar contents to those listed above.
5.3.3.1 Method of commercialization
The methods of commercialization were determined using DEMO criteria developed in section
3.5. Appendix A includes the descriptions of the categories that were used for this purpose.
Two individuals identified the method DEMO commercialization for each start-up: the author and
another researcher who conducts DEMO in the area of scientific research
commercialization. Appendix A also includes the instructions given to the second coder. The
second coder was trained by DEMO the coder with the materials contained in Appendix A
and by working through two examples with the coder to ensure that the instructions were
DEMO The identification of the methods of commercialization used by the start-ups
were done independently by the two coders and then compared. Of the 54 DEMO in the
sample, the two coders identified the same method of DEMO in 50 cases (93%).
Cohen’s Kappa measure of inter-rater reliability DEMO .89. A Kappa greater than .70 is generally
61
considered satisfactory. The four cases where the coders identified different methods DEMO
commercialization were discussed by the coders and a final resolution was reached that was
acceptable to both coders.
5.3.3.2 Business activities of the start-up
DEMO data needed to calculate the four measures of the business activities of the start-up were
identified from the audited financial statements contained in the DEMO reports of the firms.
5.4 Study #3, survey of academic researchers
DEMO #3 consisted of two phases. The measure development and preliminary fieldwork
phase focused on the development and testing of the measures to be used DEMO the study. The
survey phase focused on gathering data related to individual innovations from researchers.
5.4.1 Measure development and preliminary fieldwork
The development of DEMO followed the general approach set out in Churchill (1979). The
DEMO of this approach and the specific activities undertaken are described in the following
sections.
5.4.1.1 Specifying the domain of the constructs
Specifying the domain DEMO the construct involves delineating what is included and excluded
from the concept (Churchill, 1979). Each of the independent variables has previously been
DEMO and used in research on technology transfer or transaction cost economics (DEMO
chapter 2, Literature review, and Table 5.1). The dependent variable, the governance
structure used in the commercialization of the innovation, is DEMO and specified in
chapter 3.
5.4.1.2 Generate item pool
Generating the item pool involves 1) identifying how the variables have been defined
previously and how many dimensions they have and 2) identifying or generating items which
tap each of the dimensions of the constructs (Churchill, 1979).
62
Items related to the independent variables were identified from a review DEMO the literature.
The wording of these items was reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure the wording of
items was as precise as possible DEMO suited to the university commercialization environment.
The items identified were further refined using the results of the pilot survey (see section
5.4.1.3). Table 5.1 sets out the items identified for the independent variables and identifies
DEMO sources.

For the dependent variable, two dimensions related to the governance structures used to
commercialize the technology were identified in chapter 3. These are DEMO) whether a new firm
or an established firm commercialized the new DEMO and 2) ownership of the property
rights to the innovation. Items DEMO these dimensions were generated through discussions with
a small number of experienced persons (Churchill, 1979). Specifically, individuals in the
University of Waterloo’s Technology Transfer and Licensing Office and faculty members
who are experienced in DEMO were interviewed. For the ownership of property
rights dimension of governance structures, numerous factors could be considered as
indicators of ownership of the property rights (see section, for example, section 6.4.1.2).
Based on the discussions with experts, it was decided that holding equity rights in the
commercializing firm was a strong indicator that the university/inventor retained property
DEMO to the invention. This decision is consistent with Oxley (1999) who identifies the
possession of equity as an important break point in market-hierarchy DEMO structures.
Table 5.2 sets out the items identified for the two dimensions.
5.4.1.3 Purify the measures (pilot study)
Based on the above, DEMO initial survey instrument was developed containing multiple items for
each variable (DEMO, 1979). This initial instrument was sent to approximately 25 faculty
DEMO in the Department of Management Sciences at the University of Waterloo. They
were asked to complete the survey and also to provide opinions and DEMO relating to the
face validity of the measures. The feedback received and analysis of the responses provided
supported most of the items in the DEMO Nonetheless, a small number of changes to the
measures were made.
DEMO Survey phase
5.4.2.1 Sample
The population for the survey is faculty members who have had new technologies resulting
from their academic research put into DEMO use and who are located at one of two of
the universities participating in the “C4” consortium. The C4 consortium is the result of DEMO
agreement between four south-western Ontario universities to cooperate in areas related to
the support of technology transfer. The choice of intense examination of faculty DEMO a small
geographic area rather than a broader sample from numerous universities was made to
65
minimize the impact of environmental factors such as differing economic environments DEMO
the availability of venture capital (see section 2.2). This choice DEMO also convenient and limits
the costs of performing the research. Research into commercialization of university research
has often taken this approach. Agrawal and Henderson (2002) and Shane (2002) both focused
on innovations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Colyvas et al. (2002) examined
innovations from two DEMO This approach limits somewhat the generalizability of the
findings. Future research can extend the population to other universities.

One of the universities has a strong reputation for entrepreneurial activity DEMO for its
engineering and computer science schools. The other university has strong medical and
engineering schools. Research has shown that medical schools and engineering DEMO are
significant producers of commercialized research. Thursby et al. (2001) found that 33% of
the inventions disclosed in their survey came from medical DEMO and 29% came from
engineering schools. These were the two largest sources of inventions in their survey.
Faculty members who have been involved in DEMO were identified as follows.
Members of the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office at the first university indicated
that reported disclosures to the university’s Office DEMO not a reliable source for identifying
faculty members who have been involved in commercialization as there is evidence that
many commercialized innovations are not DEMO to the Office. Consequently, the
following sources were used to develop DEMO list of faculty members who may have been
involved in commercialization:


Waterloo Region “TechMap.” This document, produced by PriceWaterhouseCoopers,
CTT and Communitech, identifies high technology firms in the Waterloo Region and
identifies technology and people links to local universities;
OCE/CITO Innovation Tree. DEMO document, produced by the Ontario Centres of
Excellence, identifies spin-off companies and receivers of technology transfer resulting
from technology transferred from research sponsored DEMO Communication and
Information Technology Ontario (“CITO”);
 Spin-off Company Profiles. This internal publication of the Technology Transfer and
Licensing Office of University DEMO is a compilation of corporate profiles of numerous
companies that have a connection to technologies or people from the university; and
 The University’s Technology Transfer and Licensing Office website. This site lists
technologies available for DEMO
Some faculty members involved in commercialization were also identified from references
by other faculty members and articles in the local newspaper. Multiple sources were DEMO to
ensure as complete an identification of faculty members who may have been involved in
commercialization as possible. A high proportion of the faculty DEMO were identified by
multiple sources. This finding provides some evidence as to the overall completeness of the
list.
67
At the second university, a senior member of the university’s Technology Transfer and
Licensing Office indicated that he believed that their records did DEMO a complete listing
of faculty members who had been involved in commercialization activities. In this case, a
listing of these faculty members provided by the Office was used as the sampling frame.
For both universities, the lists included faculty members who may have been involved in
commercialization. However, the commercialization activities were at various stages. In
many cases, the commercialization process had begun but the technology was not yet in
commercial use. DEMO study is concerned with the governance structures in place when the
technology is commercialized and, consequently, it was necessary to identify those instances
DEMO the technology had been put into commercial use.
Attempts were made to contact by telephone each of the faculty members identified to
determine whether DEMO technology they had invented had been put into commercial use. Table
5.3 indicates the results of these contacts. In some cases, contact was not made after multiple
attempts. This may be because the faculty member was DEMO from the university for an
extended period of time (e.g., on sabbatical) or because the faculty member chose not to
return messages left for them. In total, there were only 13 cases where contact was not made.
In a high proportion of the cases, contact was made and the faculty member indicated that the
technology they had invented was DEMO yet in commercial use. The difference in the
proportion of such cases between the two universities is due to the differences in the way DEMO
faculty members were identified. As indicated above, the list for University DEMO was compiled
from multiple sources and, in order to be as DEMO as possible, included all faculty
members who appeared in these sources DEMO of the likelihood that their inventions had
been put into commercial use. At University #2, the list was compiled by members of the
University’s Technology Transfer and Licensing Office who were more familiar with the
cases DEMO, therefore, could more accurately eliminate cases that had not been put into
commercial use. Overall, the large proportion of cases where technologies were not yet in
commercial use indicates the difficulties and time involved in DEMO a new
technology. The number of cases where technologies were in commercial use is much greater
at University #1 than University #2. This is DEMO an usual finding. Clayman (2004) analyzed
reported information on commercialization activity at Canadian universities and found great
variability between universities in most measures DEMO commercialization activity. In total, 64
faculty members who have invented new DEMO that have been put into commercial
use were identified.

5.4.2.2 Design and procedures
A survey approach was used to DEMO the data. The survey consisted of a self-administered
questionnaire that was mailed to participants. A copy of the questionnaire is contained in
Appendix B. DEMO the survey involved human participants, ethics approval was solicited
from the DEMO of Waterloo’s Office of Research Ethics. Full ethics clearance was
received in September 2003.
Faculty members identified as possibly having been involved in commercialization (see
section 5.4.2.1) were contacted by telephone. The purposes of the telephone call were to 1)
determine whether technologies resulting from their academic DEMO had been put into
commercial use (i.e., they are part of the target population) and 2) to ask for their
participation in DEMO research. The survey was mailed to those who agreed to participate in the
research. Multiple attempts were made to contact faculty members. The choice DEMO make
multiple attempts to contact faculty members rather than to leave voice messages asking for a
response was made based on early experience in DEMO faculty members. This early
experience indicated that the response rate to voice messages was very low. Up to 10
attempts were made to contact DEMO individual over multiple academic terms. As indicated in
Table 5.3, these DEMO resulted in contact being made with 203 (94.1%) of the 220
faculty members identified as potentially having been involved in commercialization
activities.

A number of steps were taken to increase response rates to DEMO survey. First, the survey was
designed to make it easy to DEMO This included laying out the survey clearly, making the
questions easy DEMO read and well spaced, and making responses easy to complete by DEMO
circling the appropriate response (Fowler, 2002). Second, a number DEMO follow-up procedures
were used to encourage participants to respond (Babbie, 1999; Dillman, 2000). The first
follow-up procedure conducted was a telephone DEMO This follow-up reminded the
participants of the survey, confirmed that they DEMO received the survey and encouraged them
to respond to it. The second follow-up procedure was a written memo. This memo again
reminded the participants DEMO the survey and their agreement to participate and encouraged
them to respond. A copy of the survey was included with this memo. Follow-up procedures
DEMO timed to reach participants at less busy times of the year. Specifically, experience in
contacting potential participants suggested that the beginning of academic terms was a better
time to obtain cooperation from participants than later in DEMO term when examinations and
other deadlines were imminent. Consequently, follow-up procedures DEMO performed early in
the term. As a result of these procedures, DEMO overall response rate of 70% was achieved.
These procedures were conducted over the period from January 2004 to September 2005.
In total, over 1,000 contact attempts were made through telephone calls, e-mails and
memoranda to achieve the participation and response rates indicated above. Chapter 8 reports
the DEMO of the analysis of the survey responses including the results of tests designed to
assess the reliability and validity of the data obtained (Churchill, 1979).
5.5 Summary
Three studies were conducted in the course of this research. Study #1 analyzes three start-ups
based on new technologies arising DEMO research conducted at the University of Waterloo.
Study #2 examines the business activities of a number of Canadian and U.S. public start-up
firms. Study DEMO is a survey of university faculty members who have had new technologies
arising from their academic research put into commercial use. Each of these DEMO uses
different methods providing multiple perspectives on the research question. The results of
these studies are presented in chapters 6, 7 and 8, DEMO
Chapter 6
Results Study #1 – A Tale of Three Start-ups
This DEMO contains the results of the analysis of three start-ups based on new technologies
arising from research conducted at the University of Waterloo. The primary DEMO of these
examples is to illustrate the significant differences that exist in the governance structures
used to commercialize new technologies.
6.1 Background to the DEMO start-ups
Table 6.1 contains a summary of key information about the three start-ups. It also indicates
the specific sources of the information obtained.
DALSA DEMO (“DALSA”) is a start-up that commercialized image capture charge-
coupled device (“CCD”) technology. Dr. Savvas Chamberlain founded DALSA. Dr.
Chamberlain was a DEMO of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
Waterloo from 1974 to December 1994. DALSA was founded in 1980 and was originally
involved DEMO performing contract R&D work for other firms. In the late 1980’s, DALSA
adopted a “business strategy to focus on developing and expanding standard product lines of
high performance CCD image sensor silicon chips and electronic DEMO (DALSA, 1996,
p. 8).
Certicom Corp. (“Certicom”) is a start-up that commercialized elliptical curve
cryptography technology. Dr. Scott Vanstone was DEMO in the founding of Certicom. Dr.
Vanstone is a Professor of Combinatorics and Optimization in the Faculty of Mathematics at
the University of Waterloo. DEMO was founded in 1985 as a research and development
company to develop a high speed cryptographic integrated circuit for Newbridge Networks.
In 1993, Certicom “decided to emphasize the provision of OEM cryptographic technologies
based on ECC DEMO major vendors of computing and communications products” (Certicom,
1998, p. 10).
Senesco Technologies, Inc. (“Senesco”) is a start-up involved in commercializing a lipase
gene that controls the aging of plants. Senesco was DEMO in 1998 to commercialize this
technology discovered by Dr. John Thompson. Dr. Thompson is a Professor of Biology in
the Faculty of Science at DEMO University of Waterloo.

6.1.1 Transfer of technologies to the start-ups
The University of Waterloo DEMO an ‘inventor owns’ intellectual property policy. Specifically,
the University’s Policy 73 states that “ownership of rights in IP created in the course of
DEMO and research activities belong to the creator(s)” (University of DEMO, 2000).
Consequently, transfer of intellectual property rights from the university to the start-ups is
not required as it is at universities with DEMO ‘university owns’ intellectual property policy.
Nonetheless, the start-ups still have a DEMO to obtain the rights to the technologies from their
inventors. In the cases of DALSA and Certicom, a search of the United States Patent and
Trademark Office patent databases conducted on July 20, 2005 identified seven patents with
Dr. Chamberlain as an inventor that had been assigned to DEMO and 32 patents with Dr.
Vanstone as an inventor that had been assigned to Certicom. In the case of Senesco, the start-
up’s 1999 proxy statement indicates that “by assignment dated June 25, 1998 …, DEMO
Thompson and Meesrs. Hong and Hudak assigned all of their rights in and to the Patent
Application … with respect to the invention and/DEMO improvements thereto to Senesco”
(Senesco, 1999, p.6). Thus each DEMO has acquired rights to the technologies from their
inventors.
6.1.2 Approaches taken to the commercialization of the technologies by the
start-ups
In its 1996 DEMO Public Offering prospectus, DALSA described its business as the “design,
DEMO, manufacture and marketing of image sensor and electronic camera products”
(DALSA, 1996, p. 4). In commercializing its technology, DALSA designed a number of
standard sensor and camera products, created a manufacturing facility in Waterloo,
developed distribution channels to service customers in North America, Europe and the Asia-
Pacific region, and formed a team to market its products (DALSA, 1996).
In 1998, Certicom’s description of its business was that Certicom “develops and markets
cryptographic algorithms and licenses cryptographic software DEMO integrated circuits to
manufacturers of equipment and software” (Certicom, 1998, DEMO 4). Certicom developed
cryptographic and information security protocol toolkits to help other firms integrate
Certicom’s security features into their products (Certicom, 2004a)DEMO Certicom also developed
systems integration consulting and development support capabilities as well as selling and
marketing capabilities to support the commercialization of its technology (Certicom, 1998).
73
In 2004, Certicom adopted a new strategy for commercializing its technology. “Certicom’s
Intellectual Property Licensing Program provides licenses to organizations that have
implemented DEMO are wishing to implement the technologies covered in Certicom’s extensive
patent portfolio” (Certicom, 2004b, p. 7). Under this strategy, Certicom grants DEMO firms
licenses to its portfolio of patents. These firms then have the flexibility to build their own
security products using Certicom’s technologies.
Senesco’s strategy DEMO “to follow a … commercialization strategy that involves the licensing
of our technology to business partners for the purpose of further technological development,
DEMO and distribution … who will pay us royalties when they market and distribute
products incorporating our technology upon commercialization” (Senesco, 2004, p. 33). This
approach means that Senesco does not need to develop manufacturing, marketing or selling
capabilities and was adopted “so that we can direct DEMO resources to what we do best: further
understanding the role of DEMO 5A [its patented technology]” (Senesco, 2004, p. 4).
6.2 DEMO
This section contains two analyses of information related to the three start-ups. The first
compares the start-ups on the basis of criteria developed for DEMO build, rent and sell
governance structures. The second analysis looks at DEMO in the nature of the business
operations of the three start-ups.
6.2.1 Comparison of the three start-ups in relation to specified criteria
This section DEMO the three start-ups using the criteria for distinguishing between the
build, DEMO and sell governance structures developed in chapter 3. These criteria include who
commercializes the technology and who retains the risks and benefits of ownership DEMO to
the technology. Detailed motivation for the choice of these criteria is given in section 3.5.
Table 6.2 summarizes the analysis of the three DEMO in relation to the criteria.

6.2.1.1 Who commercializes the technology
“Commercialization is the production, manufacturing, DEMO, marketing, and distribution
of a product that embodies an innovation” (DEMO, 1995, p. 143). Using this definition of
commercialization, it DEMO clear that DALSA itself commercializes the CCD technology that it
controls. The previous sections contain evidence demonstrating that DALSA has developed
sensor and camera DEMO and that it manufactures, markets and distributes these products
to its DEMO
Under Certicom’s current primary strategy of intellectual property licensing, it is DEMO
established firms that commercialize the ECC technologies on which the company is based.
As described previously, these other established firms acquire the right to use Certicom’s
patented technology in order to develop their own products. Established DEMO that use
Certicom’s technology to develop their own products include the United States National
Security Agency, General Dynamics, Pitney Bowes and Research In DEMO (Certicom,
2005).
Likewise, in Senesco’s case, it is DEMO established firms that commercialize the gene
technology on which the company is based. Established firms license Senesco’s technology
in order to develop specific crops DEMO Senesco’s technology. These established
firms include “ArborGen for forestry products, Cal/DEMO for alfalfa, Rahan Meristem for
bananas, Harris Moran for lettuces and melons, The Scotts Company for turf and
ornamentals and the Broin Companies for ethanol” (Senesco, 2004, p. 4).
These differences in whether the technology is commercialized by the start-up or by other
established firms DEMO fundamental differences in the commercialization strategies of the
start-ups. Start-ups that commercialize products themselves operate in the ‘product market.’
Conversely, start-ups that execute “agreements with other firms—usually incumbents—who
serve as conduits for commercializing technology to the DEMO market” (Gans and Stern,
2003, p. 336) operate in DEMO for technology. Using these classifications, DALSA
operates in the product market DEMO Certicom and Senesco operate through markets for
technology.
6.2.1.2 Rights of ownership of the technology
This section examines three specific rights related to the DEMO of the technology. These
rights are 1) the right to use DEMO technology, 2) the right to appropriate returns from the
76
technology and 3) the right to change the technology’s form or substance. These criteria are
based on the concept of property rights discussed DEMO section 3.5.
6.2.1.3 Right to use the technology
DALSA retains all of the rights to use its technology and exercises these rights through the
DEMO of products based on the technology. Through its patents, DALSA has DEMO to
prevent others from using its technology.
Certicom has licensed some of the rights to use its technology to other parties. For
example, Certicom has granted the United States National Security Agency a non-exclusive
worldwide license DEMO use Certicom’s ECC intellectual property (Certicom, 2003). The
licensees obtain the right to use the technology under these arrangements though these rights
DEMO limited by the terms of the agreement. For example, the licensees DEMO not have the right to
prevent others from using the technology. In addition, Certicom retains the right to use the
technology itself. It exercises this right through sale of internally developed products and
through the licensing DEMO the technology to other firms. For example, Certicom has licensed
some DEMO the same technology it licensed to the National Security Agency to Research In
Motion Limited (Certicom, 2004).
Senesco has also licensed some DEMO the rights to use its technology to other parties. For
example, DEMO has granted The Scotts Company (“Scotts”) the exclusive right to use its
technology in the fields of garden plants, potted plants and turf grass (Senesco, 2004b). This
license covers the period until the DEMO of the last of Senesco’s patents involved in the
agreement. Scotts has acquired the rights to use the technology in the specified fields and DEMO
exclude others from using the technology in these fields. Senesco has given up the right to
use the technology in these fields though it DEMO the right to use the technology in other
fields.
6.2.1.4 Right to appropriate returns from the technology
DALSA retains all of the rights to DEMO returns from the technology. It exercises this
right through the sale of products based on the technology and retains all of the profits
resulting DEMO the sale of the products.
77
Certicom appropriates returns from its technology through its intellectual property
licensing DEMO Certicom’s returns from licensees are limited to the contractually
determined amounts though it can appropriate additional returns from licensing to other
firms. The licensees DEMO the residual returns from selling products based on the technology
(i.e., the profit resulting from the sale of the products after paying the DEMO agreed
amounts to Certicom).
Senesco’s returns in the fields covered by the licenses are limited to the contractually
determined amounts. These contractually determined DEMO include benchmark payments
payable on the meeting of conditions set out in the contract and a royalty of a fixed
percentage of net sales DEMO products developed and sold by the licensee (Senesco, 2004b).
Senesco can appropriate no returns other than those specified in the licensee agreement DEMO the
specified areas of use. The licensees have obtained the right to appropriate all returns from
the technology in the specified fields of use DEMO paying the contractually agreed amounts.
Senesco can appropriate additional returns from the technology only by licensing rights to
use the technology in other fields DEMO use.
6.2.1.5 Right to change the technology’s substance or form
DALSA retains all rights to change the technology’s substance or form (e.g., to DEMO and
patent improvements or enhancements to the technology). Certicom’s non-exclusive licenses
of its intellectual property suggest that Certicom has given the licensees the DEMO to use its
technology but not the right to own improvements or enhancements of the technology.
Senesco’s license to Scotts provides that Senesco will DEMO modification or improvements
to Senesco’s technology made by Scotts (Senesco, 2004b). However, any inventions by
Scotts developed during the commercialization process will belong to Scotts. Consequently,
Senesco’s rights to changes in the technology DEMO limited to the basic technology and do not
extent to new inventions in the field of use set out in the agreement.
6.2.1.6 Summary DEMO rights of ownership of the technology
The three start-ups have very different levels of interest in the risks and benefits of ownership
of technology. DEMO has retained substantially all of the rights of ownership discussed in
this section. Certicom has transferred limited rights to the use of and returns DEMO the
technology to its licensees. Nonetheless, Certicom has retained the primary DEMO of
78
ownership to its technology. Conversely, Senesco has transferred the primary rights of
ownership to its technology to its licensees in the specific fields DEMO by the liceneses.
Senesco’s rights of ownership to its technology apply primarily to fields of use not covered
by its license agreements.
The difference DEMO Certicom’s and Senesco’s situations is analogous to the difference
between an owner of a residential building who rents apartments and one who sells
condominium DEMO The property owner who rents apartments gives tenants limited rights to
use his/her property but retains the primary rights to the property. The DEMO owner who
sells condominium units transfers the primary rights to the unit to the buyer. Certicom’s
situation is analogous to the property own who DEMO out his property while Senesco’s
situation is analogous to the property owner who sells units in his/her building to others.
6.2.1.7 Methods used DEMO commercialize the technology
Based on the analysis in this section and using the criteria developed in section 3.5, DALSA
has used a build governance structure to commercialize its technology since it is a new firm,
DEMO, that commercializes the technology and this new firm has ownership of DEMO property
rights to the technology. Certicom has used a rent governance structure to commercialize its
technology since it is established firms that commercialize the DEMO but the majority of
the property rights are retained by a firm, Certicom, created by the inventor to market the
technology to established DEMO Senesco has used a sell governance structure to
commercialize its technology since it is established firms, rather than Senesco, that
commercialize the technology DEMO these established firms have acquired the majority of the
property rights to the technology in the fields of use where the technology is commercialized.
DEMO Nature of business operations
This section analyses the nature of the business operations of each of the start-ups. Two
elements of the nature of DEMO operations are considered. The first is the method used by
the start-up to appropriate returns from the technology. Inventing a successful new
technology that DEMO significant value to customers is necessary for the successful
commercialization of a new technology. But it is not enough. The gains from a new
DEMO often go to competitors who imitate the technology, customers or suppliers DEMO the
complementary assets needed to commercialize the technology (Teece, 1986). Therefore,
successful commercialization also involves finding a way to appropriate enough DEMO the gains
79
from the new technology to make the commercialization effort worthwhile (Winter, 2000).
The second element is the nature of core activities undertaken by the start-up. The
commercialization of a technology requires a number of DEMO in addition to the
technology itself. These capabilities include manufacturing, marketing, distribution and
service activities (Teece, 1986). This section identifies which DEMO these core activities are
conducted by the start-ups versus which are conducted by other firms. Table 6.3 summarizes
the results of these analyses.

6.2.2.1 Method of DEMO returns from technology
DALSA earns returns on its technology primarily through sales of standard products based
on the technology. In 2004, standard product sales produced revenues of $159m representing
94% of the company’s total revenue (DALSA, 2004).
Under its Intellectual Property Licensing Program, Certicom earns returns on its
technology through royalties from licensing its technology to other firms. These licensing
agreements DEMO give the licensees non-exclusive rights to use Certicom’s patented
technologies (Certicom, 2004a). In 2004, royalties from technology licenses produced
revenues of $25m representing 72% of the company’s total revenue (Certicom, 2004a).
Senesco DEMO its technology on a crop by crop basis and earns returns on its technology
from:
 nonrefundable upfront license fees received in exchange DEMO the transfer of the
technology to the licensee;
 milestone payments contingent on the achievement of certain research goals; and
 royalty payments on the commercial introduction of products using Senesco’s
technology.
These licensing agreements DEMO generally worldwide exclusive rights to use Senesco’s
patented technologies for a specific crop. In 2004, earned US$16,667 in nonrefundable
upfront license fees representing 100% of the company’s total revenue (Senesco, 2004).
In summary, DALSA derives its revenues from product market activity while Certicom
and Senesco DEMO their revenues from technology market activity. These findings are
consistent with Hypotheses 1a: The build option is positively associated with new firms
created to commercialize technologies deriving revenue primarily from product market
activity and 1b: The rent and sell options are positively associated with new firms created to
DEMO technologies deriving revenue primarily from technology market activity.
80
6.2.2.2 Operating activities
DALSA designs, develops, manufactures, markets and sells products based on its
technology. In 2004, the costs of manufacturing it standard products were $88m representing
63% of its total operating costs. Research and development expenditures totaled DEMO
representing 16% of its total operating costs. The cost of marketing and selling activities are
not separately broken out in DALSA’s financial statements but DEMO part of a $26m expense
category (DALSA, 2004). Thus DALSA is directly involved in all of the activities involved
in commercializing its DEMO
81
In the case of Certicom’s Intellectual Property Licensing Program, Certicom has
undertaken the research and development activities necessary develop its patent portfolio.
Once DEMO patents are licensed, Certicom has “no continuing obligations” (Certicom, 2004a, p.
27) related to the licenses. The licensee is responsible for developing products based on the
technology and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products.
Senesco is similar to Certicom in that it undertakes research and development DEMO but
not the other activities involved in the commercialization of its technology. Senseco develops
partnerships with other firms who take on further technological development, marketing and
distribution of products based on Senesco’s technology (Senesco, 2004, p. 4).
In summary, DALSA is involved in both technology development activities and production
activities while Certicom and Senesco are involved in technology DEMO activities but
not production activities. This finding is consistent with Hypotheses 2a: The build option is
positively associated with new firms created to commercialize technologies expending
significant resources on both technology development activities and production activities DEMO
2b: The rent and sell options are positively associated with new DEMO created to
commercialize technologies expending significant resources on technology development
activities but not on production activities.
6.3 Discussion
6.3.1 Limitations
The analyses above are DEMO examination of only three firms. These three firms were
selected because of the differences in their approach to the commercialization of new
technologies rather DEMO to be a representative sample of start-up firms involved in the
commercialization of new technologies arising from university research. For these reasons,
while DEMO findings are consistent with Hypotheses 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b, they cannot be
considered strong evidence in support of the hypotheses. The DEMO may also not be
generalizable to other firms. These issues are addressed in part by the broader sample in
Study #2. In addition, these analyses are based on archival data sources and it is not possible
DEMO gather information about the technology attributes that are involved in Hypotheses 3
through 8 from these sources. Consequently, no evidence concerning these hypotheses is
provided by this study. This issue is addressed in part by Study DEMO which involves gathering
information about technology attributes through a survey of inventors.
82
6.3.2 Implications
The above analyses highlight a number of important considerations DEMO to start-ups that
commercialize new technologies arising from university research. The first is that start-ups
can have very distinctive approaches to commercialization. DALSA’s approach DEMO building a
business that manufactures and sells products based on the new technology is the
conventional one most often thought of when commercialization through DEMO is
discussed. However, Certicom and Senesco have taken different approaches to
DEMO Neither manufactures and sells products based on their technology.
Rather they operate in markets for technology where they sell rights to use their technology
DEMO other firms who manufacture and sell products based on the technology. These differences
suggest that there may be important differences between start-ups that are DEMO accounted for
when all start-ups are grouped together and considered a single method of
commercialization.
Secondly, even though all three firms reflect situations where a start-up was involved in
the commercialization of a technology, in two of the three cases (Certicom and Senesco) the
situations also involved DEMO subsequent licensing of the technology to established firms. This
finding suggests that the traditional method of analyzing the commercialization of
technologies arising from university DEMO as either start-up or licensing do not reflect the
variety of approaches to commercialization actually found in practice. Related to this is the
finding DEMO the method used to transfer an innovation out of a university may not reflect the
method used to commercialize the technology. In the cases DEMO both Certicom and Senesco,
start-up firms were used to transfer the technology out of the university environment and into
the commercial one. However, the actual commercialization of the technology was done by
established firms who DEMO the technologies from Certicom and Senesco respectively.
This finding suggests that classifying the method used to commercialize a technology based
on the method used DEMO transfer the innovation out of the university may not reflect the actual
method of commercialization.
Thirdly, there are significant differences in the nature of the operations of the three firms.
DALSA is organized to provide a DEMO range of operating activities from research and
development, through product development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of
products based on the technology. Certicom and Senesco have much more limited operating
activities focused primarily on research and DEMO activities related to developing the
technology involved. An important finding is that differences in the nature of operations of
83
these start-ups are reflected in the nature of the revenues the DEMO receives and in the types
of operating expenses it incurs. This finding is used in Study #2 to analyze a larger sample of
start-ups.
DEMO Summary
In summary, this tale of three start-ups supports the concerns DEMO in section 3.1 about the
licensing vs. start-up dichotomy for analyzing the commercialization of new technologies
arising from university research. It also provides some DEMO for the build, rent and sell
classification of governance structures proposed DEMO chapter 3. Further, the findings of this
study are consistent with DEMO 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b.
Chapter 7
Results Study #2 – An Examination into the Nature of DEMO
Activities of Public Start-up Firms
This chapter presents the results of the examination of the nature of the business activities of
public start-up firms DEMO in the commercialization of new technologies arising from
university research. The purposes of this examination are 1) to demonstrate that the criteria
identified in chapter 3 can be applied effectively in practice to classify the method DEMO to
commercialize a new technology arising from university research, 2) to demonstrate that the
build, rent and sell methods are all common approaches to commercialization, and 3) to
demonstrate that there are substantive differences DEMO the business activities of firms
depending on the method of commercialization used.
7.1 Results
This study uses two separate samples of public start-up firms DEMO have commercialized new
technologies arising from university research. The first sample is of Canadian companies
built on National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of DEMO (“NSERC”) funded
research. The second sample is of U.S. companies built on research conducted at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). Tables 7.1 and 7.2 list the firms and the
years they were founded.
DEMO 7.3 contains demographic information on the firms. Average revenues and total
operating costs are broadly comparable between the Canadian and U.S. samples although the
DEMO firms are somewhat larger. In both samples, there is significant variability DEMO revenues
and operating costs between the individual firms. The industries in which these firms operate
were classified as either life sciences or physical sciences. DEMO sciences firms are primarily
involved in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. Physical sciences firms are primarily
involved in electronics and software. Approximately one half of the DEMO are involved in life
sciences and one half in physical sciences in both the Canadian and U.S. samples.

7.1.1 Method of commercialization
Table 7.4 summarizes the results DEMO the analysis of the methods of commercialization for the
start-up firms. The start-ups were classified using the methods described in section 5.3.3.1.
The build DEMO of commercialization was the most frequently observed method of
commercialization among the start-ups (50%). The rent and sell methods of
commercialization were observed less frequently. Nonetheless, they are important methods
representing in total 13% of the start-ups examined and 18% of those that have emerged from
development DEMO As indicated in section 3.1, little attention has been paid in DEMO literature
on university technology transfer to these start-ups that compete through the market for
technologies rather than through the product market. Hybrids represent 7.4% DEMO the start-ups
examined. Hybrids reflect situations where commercialization of the technology involves the
combined efforts of both the startup and an established firm(s)DEMO For example, the technology
may have been commercialized through a joint DEMO or partnership with an established
firm with the startup contributing manufacturing capabilities and the established firm
contributing marketing and distribution capabilities to the joint DEMO As described in
section 2.6.1, hybrids represent governance structures that fall DEMO markets and
88
hierarchies. The development stage start-ups (29.6%) represent firms whose technologies DEMO
not yet been put into commercial use.

7.1.2 Business activities of the start-up
Table 7.5 summarizes the means, DEMO deviations and correlations between the four
measures of business activities used in this study. These measures are defined in section
5.3.2.
One of the DEMO of this study is to demonstrate that there are substantive differences
in the business activities of firms depending on the method of commercialization used.
DEMO analysis is a technique for grouping items in a population based on the characteristics
they possess (Hair et al., 1998). Cluster analysis DEMO the benefit that it does not depend on the
normality, linearity DEMO homoscedasticity of the data that many other techniques rely on. This
is important because the data on business activities have nonnormal distributions. Criticisms
of DEMO analysis are that it is descriptive, uses no theoretical basis for DEMO the data
and does not provide a statistical basis for drawing inferences (Hair et al, 1998).
89
Acknowledging these limits of cluster analysis, it is, nonetheless, well suited for identifying
differences in the business activities of the start-ups.

Cluster analysis was run separately on the Canadian and U.S. data as a test of the validity
of the cluster solutions (Hair et al., 1998). As a first step, both samples were analyzed DEMO
the Ward’s linkage hierarchical method in SPSS. Based on a review of the agglomeration
coefficients and dendrograms, a three-cluster solution proved to be the simplest and most
appropriate structure in both cases. To fine-tune the cluster DEMO, both samples were
analyzed using the quick cluster nonhierarchical method in DEMO The two analyses produced
clusters with very similar cluster centers. These results support the validity of the cluster
solutions. Since the results are very DEMO, the samples were combined and the analyses
repeated on the combined DEMO The results that follow are from the combined samples.
Two items in the Canadian sample had missing data and were excluded from the analyses
DEMO in a sample size of 52.
Table 7.6 reports the number of items in each cluster and the cluster centers for each
variable. Also DEMO is an F value reflecting the ratio of between-cluster variation to
within-cluster variation. Due to the nature of cluster analysis, these F values are considered
descriptive rather than as measures of statistical significance (Hair et al., 1998). Nonetheless,
these F values suggest a very good overall fit to the cluster model. Figures 7.1 and 7.2 are
plots of DEMO start-ups on the two market measures and the two resources measures
respectively. Figure 7.1 demonstrates very clear differences between the clusters in relation
to DEMO product market activity and technology market activity measures. The differences
90
between clusters in Figure 7.2 are less pronounced but still show DEMO between the
clusters in relation to the technology development activity and production activity measures.

7.1.2.1 Characterization of DEMO three clusters
Start-ups in Cluster 1 are firms that operate almost exclusively in product markets with little
activity in markets for technology. They also DEMO a significant amount of their resources
on production activities and a more limited amount of their resources on technology
development activities.
Start-ups in Cluster DEMO are firms that operate primarily in markets for technology with
limited activity in product markets. They expend the majority of their resources on
technology DEMO activities and a very limited amount of resources on production
activities.
Start-ups in Cluster 3 are firms that are not yet active in either DEMO markets or markets
for technology. Like start-ups in Cluster 2, they DEMO the majority of their resources on
technology development activities and virtually none on production activities. These
Production activity
92
characterizations serve to illustrate the substantive differences in the business activities DEMO
firms in the three clusters.
7.2 Comparison of methods of commercialization with cluster analysis

both technology development activities and production

H2b: The rent and sell options are positively associated with

production activities.
As indicated in section 7.1.2.1, Cluster 1 characterizes firms that derive revenue primarily
from product market activity and expend resources on both technology development
activities and production DEMO Cluster 2 characterizes firms that derive revenue
primarily from technology market activity and expend resources on technology development
activities but not on production activities. DEMO, these hypotheses can be reframed as
considering whether there is an DEMO between firms using the build method of
commercialization and the characteristics of firms in Cluster 1 and between firms using the
rent or sell DEMO of commercialization and the characteristics of firms in Cluster 2. The
Fisher exact test for the 2x2 table (build vs. rent or sell, DEMO 1 vs. Cluster 2) is highly
statistically significant (p < .001). Thus, hypotheses H1a, H1b, H2a and H2b are supported.

7.3 Conclusions
7.3.1 Limitations of the study
This study is subject to DEMO number of limitations. First, as described earlier, the sample
population may not be representative of all start-ups created to commercialize new
technologies arising DEMO university research. While NSERC funded research is an important
source of new technologies, new technologies also result from university research not funded
by NSERC. MIT start-ups also may not be representative of start-ups from other universities.
DEMO, the results of this study may not be generalizable to all DEMO
technologies arising from university research. Nonetheless, the samples represent important
sources DEMO new technologies and afford the benefits arising from having two separate samples
from different countries and derived from different sources. A second limitation is DEMO the
variables used in the cluster analysis are not sensitive to differences between the rent and sell
methods of commercialization. The cluster analysis is DEMO on accounting data and this data
does not address the issues of ownership of property rights to the technology that distinguish
94
between the rent and sell methods. Future research can attempt to DEMO an additional
variable(s) that capture these differences and can be DEMO to distinguish between the two
methods. A third limitation of the study is that the analysis does not capture all ways that the
sell DEMO can be implemented. The analysis in this chapter uses financial statement
information. Financial statements capture situations where rights to a technology are
transferred to DEMO established firm by way of a transaction between the start-up and the
established firm. They do not, however, capture situations where the established DEMO
acquires the technology by acquiring the start-up. In the course of performing this study,
three situations were identified where established firms acquired a DEMO indirectly by
acquiring the start-up while it was still in the development stage.
7.3.2 Implications
This study has a number of implications for examining DEMO commercialization of new
technologies arising from university research. First, it demonstrates DEMO the criteria
developed in chapter 3 to distinguish between the build, DEMO and sell categories can be
applied to actual commercialization situations. This is important as it demonstrates that the
build, rent and sell categorization scheme is not only theoretically based but also is a
practical tool for DEMO at the actual commercialization of specific technologies.
Second, it demonstrates that DEMO build, rent and sell methods of commercialization are all
frequently occurring DEMO of commercialization. This is important since theoretically
derived categories might describe situations that are theoretically possible but do not occur in
actual practice. This DEMO has shown that the build, rent and sell methods of
commercialization DEMO, in fact, occur in actual practice.
A third implication is that the build, rent and sell categorization scheme identifies
substantive differences in the operating activities associated with commercialization of a new
technology. Significant differences were DEMO in the markets in which the firms operate
and in how they allocate their resources. This is important since it demonstrates that the
differences DEMO the build, rent and sell methods of commercialization are not subtle
DEMO but rather reflect substantive differences in how the firms operate.
95
7.3.3 Summary
The study in this chapter demonstrates that build, rent and sell are common and viable
approaches to commercialization and that there DEMO substantive differences between the
approaches. In doing so, it provides evidence DEMO to the validity of the build, rent and sell
categorization approach. DEMO next chapter builds on the findings in this and the preceding
chapter using the build, rent and sell categorization approach to examine whether
characteristics of technologies affect the methods used to commercialize the technologies.
Chapter 8
Results Study #3 – Survey of academic inventors
This chapter DEMO the results of the survey of academic inventors. The primary purpose of
this study was to examine the connection between the characteristics of a DEMO technology
and the method used to commercialize the technology.
8.1 Demographic information
The sample consisted of 42 participants. Table 8.1 includes information about the DEMO
affiliation, academic rank, number of years actively involved in academic research and
number of innovations put into commercial use of the participants.
The DEMO of faculty affiliations is reasonably consistent with the findings of Thursby
et al. (2001) whose survey of 62 U.S. universities found that the DEMO common affiliations of
inventors were medical schools (33% of inventions), DEMO (29%) and science (22%).
Faculty from medical schools are DEMO in this study since University #1, which is
the primary source DEMO data, does not have a medical school. This finding might suggest DEMO
life sciences technologies are not represented in the sample. However, as DEMO in Table
8.2, a number of life sciences technologies are represented DEMO the sample. These life sciences
technologies were developed by faculty members in science (e.g., biology, optometry) and
engineering (e.g., chemical engineering)DEMO
The academic rank and number of years actively involved in academic research of the
respondents indicates a broad range of experience among those who DEMO commercialized
new technologies. While most of those who have commercialized new technologies are
senior faculty members with significant experience, more junior faculty members with much
less research experience are also represented.
Participants were asked how many DEMO technologies resulting from their academic
research have been put into commercial use. Faculty members reported an average of 2.5
commercialized technologies. Of those who DEMO to this question (n = 37), 14
respondents (38%) DEMO one commercialized technology, eight respondents (22%)
reported two commercialized technologies and 15 respondents (41%) reported more than two
commercialized technologies. The DEMO number of commercialized technologies
reported was ten by two respondents. The large number of respondents reporting multiple
96
97
commercialized technologies suggests the existence of a class of serial commercializers
DEMO faculty members.

Participants were asked to identify the most significant new technology they had invented
that had DEMO put into commercial use and the remainder of the survey addressed this
technology. The use of the most significant innovation of an inventor as DEMO unit of analysis
is consistent with the approach taken by both the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (1996) and Statistics Canada. Table DEMO shows information about the field
of use, type and stage of DEMO of the technologies.
Respondents were asked to provide a brief description of the new technology. These were
classified by field of use. The sample DEMO a broad variety of fields with the most common
being computer related (26%), environmental (17%) and life sciences (14%). The DEMO of
the technologies are product innovations (64%) while the balance are primarily process
98
innovations (31%). The information gathered on the stage of development of the
technologies supports the findings of Thursby et al. (2001) DEMO most technologies coming out
of universities are at an early stage. Only 17% of the technologies were unchanged through
the commercialization process. Approximately equal DEMO (38%) required minor or
major change and a small proportion 7% were substantially changed during the
commercialization process.

In summary, the survey covers a broad range of faculty affiliations, researcher experience,
types of technologies and stages of development. Further, DEMO distribution of survey
respondents across these categories is consistent with other research on the
commercialization of new technologies arising from university research.
8.2 Independent DEMO
Consistent with the process set out by Churchill (1979), the DEMO of the independent
variable measures was assessed using the survey data. This was done by calculating
Cronbach’s alpha for each of the independent variables DEMO the items listed in Table 5.1.
Two issues arose in this analysis. The first issue involves the tacitness and complexity
variables. Cronbach’s alpha for DEMO tacitness and complexity variables, .40 and .37
respectively, were below the levels generally required to conclude that the measures are
reliable (Hair et al., 1998). One of the items for the tacitness variable, DEMO critical elements
of this innovation could be easily explained to my colleagues (e.g., in a paper or at a
conference),’ is highly skewed (52% of participants gave responses of 5 to this item on a 5-
point scale where 1 represented “Strongly disagree” and 5 represented DEMO agree”). It
also had very low correlations with the other two items for tacitness. Based on these analyses
and the fact that this DEMO an additional item developed by the author of this thesis and is not
from the same source as the other two items, this item was removed from the tacitness
measure. Two of the items for the DEMO measure, ‘This innovation was a component of
a larger product, process or system’ and ‘A change in the design of this innovation would
DEMO compensating design changes in related components or system,’ had low correlations
with each other and with the other two items for complexity. Because DEMO this and the fact that
these were additional items not derived from the source used for the other two items, these
items were removed from the complexity measure. The remaining items in the tacitness and
complexity DEMO had strong correlations to each other. Based on a review of the items, it
was concluded that the items reflected a single underlying construct. The complexity items
were derived from Chesbrough and Kusunoki (2001) who DEMO that new technologies
typically begin in an ‘integral’ phase where the interactions between components of the
system are not well understood. They suggest that DEMO later in the development process do
“standards develop that articulate and codify the interactions between elements of a system”
(p. 205). The items in the measure for tacitness can reasonably be interpreted as reflecting
this DEMO Consequently, it is reasonable to interpret the correlations as indications
that DEMO single construct is being measured.
100
The second issue that arose involves the volatility and dynamism constructs. DEMO survey
included items related to technology volatility, technology dynamism, market volatility and
market dynamism. The results show strong correlations between the technology volatility DEMO
market volatility items. Accordingly, these items were combined into a single DEMO
construct. Similarly, the results show strong correlations between the technology dynamism
DEMO market dynamism items. These items were combined into a single dynamism construct.
Table 8.3 shows the adjusted constructs and items together with the values DEMO Cronbach’s
alpha. Values exceeding .70 for Cronbach’s alpha are generally considered good indicators of
measure reliability though lower values exceeding .60 are considered acceptable DEMO
exploratory research (Hair et al., 1998). All of the values for Cronbach’s alpha exceed this
lower threshold.
The measures and items used DEMO this study come from previous research (see Table 5.1).
The DEMO gathered in these previous studies provides significant support for the validity
of the measures. However, since the measures come from more than one previous study,
there is a risk that the scales and items derived DEMO two different authors may be measuring
the same underlying construct. To test for this, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted
using the 14 items listed in Table 8.3. The analysis was performed using principal component
analysis DEMO varimax rotation. Using a cut-off of eigenvalues greater than 1.0, the DEMO
produced a five factor solution. The five factors align with the independent variables. For
each of the 14 items, the largest factor loading in the rotated solution aligned with the
variable to which it was predicted DEMO be associated. The five factors account for 73% of the
variance of the 14 items. These findings provide further support for the validity of DEMO
measures.
8.2.1 Specialized complementary assets
The importance and specificity of complementary assets are addressed through two questions
in the survey. The first, question 24, asked about the importance of various complementary
assets for the commercialization of the technology. The second, question 25, asked whether
these complementary assets DEMO to be tailored to the technology. Each question was
measured using a 5-point scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Hypothesis H6
is concerned DEMO complementary assets that are specialized to the technology (i.e., those that
are tailored to the technology). However, if complementary assets are specialized but are not
important for commercialization, they will not create contracting problems and, therefore, are

unlikely to affect the choice of governance structure. Consequently, only specialized
complementary assets that are important for the commercialization of the technology are
DEMO in this section. To capture important specialized complementary assets, the
measure DEMO was created. This measure has the value 1 if there was a complementary
asset that was identified as both important (i.e., assessed as DEMO on the 5-point scale used for
question 24) and specialized (i.e., assessed as 5 on the 5-point scale used for question 25).
SPECCA has a value of 0 if no complementary asset was identified DEMO both important and
specialized. In the sample, 21 (50%) items DEMO a value of 1 for SPECCA and 21 (50%)
items DEMO a value of 0 for SPECCA. This approach to the measurement of complementary
assets is similar to that used by Gans et al. (2002) who use a measure for complementary
assets that is the maximum over 5-point scales measuring the importance and effectiveness of
ownership of various complementary DEMO
8.2.2 Control variables
Two control variables were considered in the analysis. The first is the affiliation of the
faculty inventor. Previous research suggests that DEMO differences may have an
influence on commercialization (see section 2.3). DEMO sample comes from universities in the
same geographic area minimizing the impact of geographic differences. The two universities
do have differing intellectual property ownership DEMO University #1 has an ‘inventor
owns’ policy while University #2 has a ‘university owns policy.’ Differences in intellectual
property policy might influence the methods DEMO to commercialize an innovation since
individual inventors may take a wide variety of approaches to commercialization while
universities may develop routines over times that DEMO to restrict the approaches to
commercialization that they consider (Cyert and DEMO, 1963; Simon, 1961). However, the
number of sample items from University #2 (n = 3) is very limited and, consequently, the
university affiliation of the faculty inventor is not an effective control variable. This
limitation will be addressed as part of future research (see section 9.3). Within a university,
differences that might affect methods DEMO commercialization could occur at the faculty and
department levels. For example, DEMO (2004) suggests that the entrepreneurial
orientation of university departments influences commercialization activity. Considering the
trade off between the benefits of being more specific DEMO the limitations of the overall sample
size, the decision was made DEMO consider the faculty level affiliation of faculty inventors as a
control variable.
The second factor considered as a control variable is the stage of DEMO of the
innovation. As described in section 2.4, some researchers have DEMO that the stage of
development may affect the method used to commercialize an innovation.
103
8.2.2.1 Faculty affiliation
Table 8.4 shows the faculty affiliations DEMO the faculty inventors in the sample categorized by
whether the technologies were commercialized using the build, rent or sell option and by
whether a Start-up or Licensing was involved. Fisher’s exact test for the 4 x DEMO table (Faculty
affiliation vs. governance structure) was not significant (p DEMO .07) though it approached
significance. Examination of the table suggests that DEMO is due to a low proportion of
technologies developed by Science faculty members that were commercialized using the
build option. Fisher’s exact test on DEMO 2 x 2 table (science/other faculty vs. build/other
options) was significant (p = .01). This suggests that it is appropriate to control for Science
affiliations when testing hypotheses related to governance structure.

Fisher’s exact test on the 4 x 2 table (Faculty affiliation vs. Start-up) was also DEMO (p
= .01). This is due to the proportion of DEMO from the science faculty that involved
start-ups (38%) being substantially lower than the proportion of technologies from other
faculties that involved start-ups (86%). These findings suggest that it is appropriate to include
a control DEMO faculty affiliations in Science in tests involving licensing vs. start-up approaches
to commercialization.
104
While there is no direct evidence concerning why affiliation with science DEMO affects
the method of commercialization, it may be that researchers in DEMO faculties pursue more
basic research than researchers in other faculties and are less likely to appreciate the potential
markets for products and services based DEMO the technology. As a result, they may be more
likely to DEMO a technology by transferring it to an established firm than by creating
a new firm to commercialize the technology.
8.2.2.2 Stage of development
Table DEMO shows the stage of development of the technologies in the sample categorized by
whether the technologies were commercialized using the build, rent or sell option and by
whether a Start-up or Licensing was involved. Fisher’s exact DEMO for the 4 x 3 table (Stage of
development vs. governance DEMO) was not significant (p = .57). Fisher’s exact test for
the 4 x 2 table (Stage of development vs. start-up) also DEMO not significant (p = .45). Based
on these findings and DEMO of the table, there no evidence suggesting that the stage of
DEMO has any relationship to the choice of governance structure or whether the
technology was commercialized using a start-up. Thus, stage of development will not be
controlled for in the tests of the hypotheses related to governance DEMO
8.2.3 Dependent variable – Governance structure
The dependent variable for this study is the governance structure used to commercialize the
innovation. More specifically, the dependent variable measures whether a build, rent or sell
option to commercialization was adopted. The classification of governance structure is based
on whether the DEMO was commercialized by a new firm or existing firm and on
ownership of the property rights to the technology (see section 3.5). Participants were asked
whether the innovation was commercialized by a newly created firm DEMO by one or more
established firms (question 29). When participants DEMO that a newly created firm was
involved, they were further asked DEMO the newly created firm produced products or
services based on the innovation or whether the newly created firm marketed the innovation
to other firms DEMO produced products or services based on the innovation (question 30).
DEMO it was indicated that a new firm was created and that the newly created firm produced
products or services based on the technology, the technology was assessed as having been
commercialized by a new firm. In DEMO cases, the technology was coded as having been
commercialized using the DEMO option consistent with the criteria in section 3.5. When it was
indicated that a new firm was created and that the newly created firm DEMO the

technology to other DEMO firms who produced products or services based on the
technology or when it was indicated that the technology was commercialized directly by
established firms, the technology was assessed as having been commercialized by established
firms. Ownership DEMO the residual property rights to the technology was assessed based on
whether the faculty inventor or their university held an equity ownership interest in DEMO
technology. Oxley (1999) identifies the sharing of equity as “a discrete, observable, ‘step
function’ in governance attributes, effectively separating it from contractual forms. As such
this is a useful ‘break point’ in the underlying DEMO continuum” (p. 288). When
the faculty inventor or their university DEMO an equity interest in the technology, the
technology was assessed as DEMO been commercialized using the rent method consistent
with the criteria in section 3.5. When the faculty inventor and their university did not hold an
DEMO interest, the technology was assessed as having been commercialized using the DEMO
method consistent with the criteria in section 3.5. Based on this method of classification, 23
sample items (55%) were classified as using the build option, nine sample items (21%) were
classified as using the rent option and ten sample items (24%) were classified as using DEMO
sell option.
106
In this research, it is suggested that the build, rent DEMO sell classification scheme better
reflects the substance of the methods used to commercialize new technologies than the
licensing vs. start-up dichotomy. In order to DEMO comparisons between the two
classification approaches, a second dependent variable (STARTUP) was created. This
variable was coded as 1 if the respondent indicated that a newly created firm was founded in
response to question 29 DEMO 0 otherwise. Based on this method of classification, 30 sample
items (71%) were classified as involving the creation of a start-up.
8.2.4 Summary of independent, control and dependent variables
Table 8.6 contains the means, DEMO deviations and correlations for the independent,
control and dependent variables described above.
8.3 Tests of hypotheses
Because the dependent variables are categorical, logistic regression was used as the primary
method of testing the hypotheses. While DEMO are three categories for the governance
structure dependent variable, each of DEMO hypotheses groups two of the categories together.
For example, Hypothesis 3 DEMO that “the greater the patent or other legal protection for the
technology, the greater the likelihood that the technology will be commercialized using the
rent option.” When using logistic regression to test this hypothesis, the build and sell
categories are combined for comparison against the rent category.
8.3.1 DEMO and other intellectual property protection for the technology
Hypothesis 3 is that “the greater the patent or other legal protection for the technology, the
greater the likelihood that the technology will be commercialized using the rent DEMO
Table 8.7 show the results of logistic regressions of the patent and other intellectual property
protection variable IP on the rent option vs. the DEMO and sell options. Model 1 “explains”
approximately 22% (Nagelkerke R2) of the total variation in governance structures. Also, the
model is a significantly better fit to the data (change in –2 log likelihood from base model =
6.40, df = 1, p =.01) than a model which excludes IP (i.e., one that considers only the mean).
DEMO estimated coefficient for IP is .43. This indicates that the odds of being in the rent
category increase by approximately 1.5 times (e.43) DEMO each increase of 1 in the IP scale. This
coefficient for the IP variable is statistically significant and in the predicted direction. Thus
Hypothesis DEMO is supported. These data were also analyzed controlling for faculty affiliation in
107
science (see section 8.2.2). The results are shown in Table 8.7 as Model 2. Controlling for
faculty affiliation in science has no DEMO impact on the model fit or coefficient
estimates.

8.3.2 Tacitness and complexity
Hypothesis 4 is that “the greater the DEMO levels of tacitness and complexity of the
knowledge inherent in a technology, the greater the likelihood that the technology will be
commercialized using the build or sell options.” Table 8.8 shows the results of the logistic
DEMO of the tacitness and complexity variable TACCOM on the build and sell options
vs. the rent option. The model “explains” approximately 5% (Nagelkerke R2) of the total
variation in governance structures. The model does not produce a significantly better fit to
the data (change in –2 log likelihood from base model = 1.37, df = 1, p =.24) than a model
which excludes TACCOM (i.e., one that includes only the DEMO term). Thus this model
does not provide a good fit to the data. The estimated coefficient for TACCOM is -.11. This
coefficient for DEMO TACCOM variable is not statistically significant and is not in the direction
hypothesized. Thus Hypothesis 4 is not supported.

TACCOM variable (.15) is not statistically significant in DEMO model.
8.3.3 Risk of substitutes
Hypothesis 5 is that “the greater the risk of substitutes, the greater the likelihood that the
technology will be commercialized using the rent option.” Table 8.9 includes the results of a
DEMO regression of the risk of substitutes variable SUBSTITUTE on the rent option vs. the
build and sell options. The model “explains” approximately 1% (Nagelkerke R2) of the total
variation in governance structures. The model does not produce a significantly better fit to
the data (change in –2 log likelihood from base model = .16, df = 1, p =.69) than a model
which excludes SUBSTITUTE (i.e., one that includes only DEMO constant term). Thus the
model does not provide a good fit to the data. The estimated coefficient for SUBSTITUTE is
.06. This coefficient DEMO the SUBSTITUTE variable is in the predicted direction but is not
statistically significant. Thus Hypothesis 5 is not supported.
Table 8.9 also includes the DEMO of a logistic regression on the alternative dependent
variable STARTUP. The model “explains” approximately 14% (Nagelkerke R2) of the total
variation in start-up DEMO licensing activity. Also, the model is a significantly better fit to DEMO
110
data (change in –2 log likelihood from base model = 6.40, df = 1, p =.04) than a model which
excludes SUBSTITUTE (i.e., one that includes only the constant term). The estimated
DEMO for SUBSTITUTE is -.31. This indicates that the odds of being in the rent
category decrease by approximately .7 times (e-.31) for each DEMO of 1 in the
SUBSTITUTE scale. This coefficient for the SUBSTITUTE variable is statistically
significant (p = .05). These data were also analyzed controlling for faculty affiliation in
science (see section 8.2.2). The results are shown in Table 8.9 as Model 2. Controlling for
faculty affiliation DEMO science results in a better fitting model than the model that does not
control for faculty affiliation in science. In addition, the SUBSTITUTE variable is no longer
statistically significant. Thus, the alternative hypothesis that the greater the risk of
substitutes, the greater the likelihood that the technology will be commercialized using start-
up option is not supported by the data.

SPECCA on the sell option DEMO the build and rent options. The model “explains”
approximately 2% (Nagelkerke DEMO) of the total variation in governance structures. The model
does not DEMO a significantly better fit to the data (change in –2 log DEMO from base

DEMO build and sell options vs. the rent option. The model “explains” approximately 6%
(Nagelkerke R2) of the total variation in governance structures. The DEMO does not produce a
significantly better fit to the data (change DEMO –2 log likelihood from base model = 1.51, df = 1,DEMO
p = .22) than a model which excludes VOLATILITY (i.e., DEMO that includes only the constant
term). Thus this model does not provide a good fit to the data. The estimated coefficient for
VOLATILITY DEMO .17. This coefficient for the VOLATILITY variable is in the predicted
direction but is not statistically significant. Thus Hypothesis 7 is not supported.

8.3.5.2 Dynamism
113
Hypothesis 8 is that “the greater the dynamism relating DEMO the technology, the greater the
likelihood that the technology will be DEMO using the rent option.” Table 8.12
includes the results of a logistic regression of the dynamism variable, DYNAMISM, on the
rent option vs. DEMO build and sell options. The model “explains” approximately 14%

significantly better fit to the data (change in –2 log likelihood from base model = 3.92, df = 1,
p =.05) than DEMO model which excludes DYNAMISM (i.e., one that includes only the constant
term). The estimated coefficient for DYNAMISM is -.55. This indicates that DEMO odds of
being in the rent category decrease by approximately .58 times (e-.55) for each increase of 1 in
the IP scale. This DEMO for the DYNAMISM variable is not statistically significant (p =
.11) and is not in the predicted direction. Thus Hypothesis 8 is not DEMO

8.3.6 Multiple attributes
The preceding analyses considered the transaction attributes individually. DEMO this section, the
impact of multiple attributes is considered. Table 8.13 DEMO the results of multinomial
logistic regressions run on the data. Model 1 is a base model including only the control
variable for faculty affiliation DEMO science. Model 2 adds IP as this was the attribute found to
be significant in the previous analyses. Model 3 continues the stepwise addition DEMO variables
adding VOLATILITY. This variable was added as it resulted in the next largest reduction in
the -2 Log Likelihood value. Model 4 includes DEMO of the transaction attribute variables. The
reference category for the dependent variable is the build governance structure.
The chi-square test for the change in DEMO –2 log likelihood value from the base model tests
the null hypothesis that all of the logistic regression coefficients except the constant are zero.
DEMO all models, this test is statistically significant providing support for acceptance DEMO the
models as significant logistic regressions. Table 8.14 shows the classification table for model
4. The model correctly classifies 67% of the cases. However, the model does misclassify a
large percentage of the cases that used DEMO sell option as having used the build option. This
may be a result of the build and sell options both reflecting hierarchy governance structures
DEMO the model not being able to distinguish differences between the two hierarchy
governance structures. Overall, consideration of the various fit measures suggests the models
provide a good fit to the data given the limited sample size.
DEMO coefficient for the IP variable related to the rent governance structure is statistically
significant and in the direction hypothesized by H3. The coefficient for DEMO VOLATILITY
variable is also statistically significant and in the direction hypothesized by H7. The
coefficients for the SPECCA and DYNAMISM variables approach statistical significance. DEMO
the case of the SPECCA variable, no difference was hypothesized between DEMO build and rent
governance structures by H6. In the case of the DYNAMISM variable, the coefficient is not
in the direction hypothesized by H8. Thus, the results provide some support for H3 and H7
but do not support H4, H5, H6 and H8.

None DEMO the coefficients for the transaction attribute variables related to the sell governance
structure are statistically significant. Thus, these results do not provide direct support for any
of the hypotheses. They do, however, provide some support DEMO the rationale behind the
build, rent and sell governance structures. Both DEMO build and sell governance structures are
hierarchies while the rent option is a market governance structure (see section 3.4). The
absence of differences between the build and rent governance structures is consistent with
their both DEMO hierarchy governance structures. The coefficient for the SCIENCE control
variable is statistically significant. While no definitive conclusion can be drawn from the data
as DEMO why the SCIENCE control variable is significant, it may be that DEMO affiliation in
science is an indication that the technologies are at a more basic stage than those from faculty
members affiliated with more applied DEMO such as engineering and mathematics
(primarily, computer science). If this is the case, it may indicate technologies that are further
from market. New firms may lack the resources to commercialize these further from market
DEMO and, consequently, they may be commercialized by established firms rather than
new firms resulting in the observed difference between the build and sell DEMO
structures. This explanation is consistent with the findings of Colyvas et al. (2002) who
found that, of the four technologies they examined that were usable without further
development, three were commercialized by new firms rather than established firms.
8.4 Discussion
The results of this study provide statistically DEMO support for Hypothesis 3 related to
patent and other legal protection in both the logistic regression and multiple logistic
regression tests. The results of DEMO study provide statistically significant support for
117
Hypothesis 7 related to volatility in the multiple logistic regression test. DEMO results of the
logistic regression test of this hypothesis are in the direction hypothesized but are not
statistically significant. Evidence related to the risk DEMO substitutes was in the predicted
direction but failed to achieve statistical significance. The results of this study do not provide
support for the other DEMO related to transaction attributes. These findings are discussed
further in the following sections.
8.4.1 Intellectual property protection
The results provide support for the hypothesis DEMO intellectual property protection is an
important consideration in selecting methods of commercialization. Specifically, the
evidence supports the hypothesis that the greater the patent or other legal protection for the
technology, the greater the likelihood that the technology will be commercialized using the
rent option. This is a particularly DEMO finding since, as described in section 2.4.4,
previous research found DEMO evidence concerning the impact of the strength of
intellectual property protection on the choice of method for commercializing the innovation.
For example Shane (2002) found that, when patents are effective, the new technology is
likely to be commercialized by licensing while del Campo, et al. (1999) suggest that, when
the proprietary position of a technology is narrow or unpatentable, licensing is an appropriate
method of commercializing the technology. The build, rent and sell governance structures
proposed in this thesis and the results of Study #3 provide a possible explanation for, and
reconciliation of, DEMO conflicting findings.
Shane (2002) examined 717 licensed patents from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and found that when patents are not effective, technologies are likely to be
licensed back to the inventors. Shane’s discussion suggests DEMO the situations involving
licensing back to the inventors represent situations where the inventor commercializes the
technology by creating a start-up firm to develop new DEMO or services based on the
technology. Thus, this study can be DEMO as suggesting that, when patents are ineffective,
technologies are likely DEMO be commercialized using the build option.
Del Campo, Sparks, Hill and Keller (1999) discuss the attempt to commercialize
superconducting quantum interference devices. DEMO conclude that “licensing may be the
best strategy when the proprietary position of the intellectual property is narrow or
unpatentable and when the capabilities DEMO the developer are limited” (p. 294). Further, they
conclude that start-ups need inventions that represent a core technology with a large market
118
potential and, if possible, multiple product applications to compensate for DEMO high risks
involved in creating a start-up firm. The discussion of start-ups in their study suggests that
the types of start-up firms they are DEMO are those that represent the build option. In
their discussion of the licensing option, they refer to the licensee as a single firm and indicate
that commonly the licensee will have the rights to improvements in DEMO technology. This
description is consistent with the sell option in the proposed taxonomy. Thus, this study can
be reframed as suggesting that, when DEMO property protection is weak, a sell approach
to commercialization is appropriate.
DEMO hypothesis that the greater the patent or other legal protection for the technology, the
greater the likelihood that the technology will be commercialized using the rent option which
was supported by Study #3 is consistent with DEMO reframed analyses of both Shane and del
Campo, et al. and DEMO a method for reconciling these previously inconsistent findings.
8.4.2 Absence of support for other hypotheses related to transaction attributes
Except for intellectual property protection DEMO to a more limited extent volatility, there was a
lack of DEMO for the other hypotheses related to transaction attributes. Three possible
explanations for this lack of support exist. First, the measures used in the study might not be
valid and reliable measures of the underlying constructs. Second, the hypothesized
relationships do exist but the effect sizes are too small DEMO be detected by the sample size of
the test. Third, the DEMO relationships do not exist. Each of these possibilities is
discussed in turn.
The first possible explanation for the lack of support for the transaction DEMO
hypotheses is that the measures used in the study are not valid and reliable measures of the
underlying constructs. Based on the findings described DEMO and detailed review of the
survey responses, two particular issues may DEMO The first relates to the measure for
specialized complementary assets. The idea of specialized complementary assets is a difficult
one (see section 2.6.3 for further discussion of this concept). While others have attempted to
measure DEMO importance of specialized complementary assets using surveys (Gans, et al.,
2002), it may be that the concept is too complex to DEMO measure using survey methods
(Babbie, 1999). Gans, et al. (2002) who used a similar measure also did not find a
statistically significant result with their measure. The second construct that may pose
measurement DEMO is the build, rent and sell governance structures; particularly, the
DEMO between the rent and sell options. As described in section 3.5, DEMO criteria are
119
used to distinguish the governance structures. The first criterion is whether DEMO new firm or an
established firm commercializes the technology. The second criterion relates to the
ownership of the property rights to the technology. The DEMO criterion is straightforward and
distinguishes the build option from the rent and sell options. The second criterion, which
distinguishes between the rent and sell options, is more complex. Following on Oxley (1999),
Study #3 uses equity rights as a proxy for ownership of property rights (see section 8.2.3). It
may be that equity rights are not a DEMO proxy for ownership of property rights to the
technology. Again, however, a more detailed examination of property rights is likely beyond
what could DEMO be accomplished using survey methodology (Babbie, 1999).
The second possible explanation for the lack of support for the transaction attribute
hypotheses is DEMO, while the hypothesized relationships exist, the power of the tests was not
large to detect them. Small sample sizes are only able to DEMO relatively large effect sizes
(Bohrnstedt and Knoke, 1994). For example, the analysis in section 8.3.1 estimated the
coefficient for IP at .43. This indicates that the odds of being in the rent category increase DEMO
approximately 1.5 times (e.43) for each increase of 1 in the IP scale. Given that the overall
odds of being in the rent DEMO are .27:1, this is a large effect size. The small DEMO size
is a limitation of this study (see section 8.4.4).
DEMO third possible explanation for the lack of support for the transaction attribute
hypotheses is that the hypothesized relationships do not exist. Since the hypotheses DEMO based
on transaction cost economics, this would imply that transaction cost DEMO is not a
useful approach for explaining the methods used to commercialize new technologies arising
from university research. However, as demonstrated in the next section, the results provide
some limited evidence that governance structures and transaction cost economics are useful
for explaining commercialization approaches.
While the above represent DEMO explanations for the lack of support for the transaction
attribute hypotheses, DEMO is no evidence to suggest which one or combination of these
factors explains the results observed.
8.4.3 Comparison of the build, rent and sell classification scheme to the
licensing vs. start-up dichotomy
In this research, it is suggested that the build, rent and sell classification scheme better
reflects the substance of the methods used to commercialize new technologies than the
120
licensing vs. start-up dichotomy. In order to allow comparisons between the DEMO
classification approaches, a second dependent variable was created to reflect the DEMO vs.
start-up approach commonly used to analyze the methods used to commercialize new
technologies. No statistically significant relationships to the transaction attribute variables
were DEMO using this alternative dependent variable. A comparison of the fit of the models
can also provide a sense of which dependent variable better fits DEMO data. A comparison of the
results of the analyses in sections 8.3.1 to 8.3.5 indicates that the build, rent or sell dependent
variable models had the better fit to the data in four of the six DEMO and the licensing vs.
start-up dependent variable models had the better fit to the data in two of the six cases. Based
on the DEMO of the models and the fact that the build, rent and DEMO models identified one
statistically significant relationship related to the transaction attribute variables, there is some
evidence that the build, rent and sell classification DEMO did better at ‘explaining’
commercialization structures based on technology characteristics than did the licensing vs.
start-up dichotomy traditionally used to look at methods of DEMO
8.4.4 Limitations
Section 8.4.2 identified two limitations in this study. One is the small sample size which
limits the ability of the analyses to DEMO small effect sizes. The second limitation identified
is the limitation of survey methodologies for measuring complex variables. This limitation
impacts on the ability to DEMO specialized complementary assets and the property rights to
a technology.
A third limitation of this study results from the sample being drawn from two DEMO
located in the same geographic area. As indicated in section 5.4.2.1, DEMO choice of intense
examination of faculty from a small geographic area rather than a broader sample from
numerous universities was made to minimize the DEMO of environmental factors such as
differing economic environments and the availability of venture capital. This choice is also
convenient and limits the costs of DEMO the research. However, this approach limits
somewhat the generalizability of the DEMO
8.4.5 Implications
The findings of this study have a number of implications. First, they suggest that technology
attributes may have an impact on the methods used to commercialize a new technology
arising from university research. Specifically, they suggest that, when intellectual property
121
protection for a technology is weak, the build and sell approaches are likely to be more
effective. The rent approach requires stronger intellectual DEMO protection to enable the
inventor to appropriate gains from the technology since secrecy and other methods of
appropriate gains are unlikely to be effective DEMO the rent option is used.
Second, as described in section 8.4.1, these findings help to resolve conflicts in previous
research on the role DEMO intellectual property protection. Specifically, the findings suggest that
there are differences DEMO the importance of intellectual property protection when a technology
is licensed to numerous established firms as in the rent approach compared to when a
DEMO is licensed to a single establish firm as in the sell approach.
Third, these findings suggest that the build, rent and sell classification DEMO proposed in
this thesis provides insights into the commercialization process that the licensing vs. start-up
approach does not. This is suggested both by the DEMO of the effect of intellectual
property protection using both approaches and by the overall comparison of the two
approaches.
8.5 Summary
The study in DEMO chapter demonstrates that there are connections between the characteristics
of a particular new technology and the method used to commercialize the technology. It also
DEMO further support for the usefulness of the build, rent and sell DEMO approach.
Chapter 9
Conclusions
In this chapter, the key results of the three studies conducted are summarized. In addition, the
theoretical and managerial implications of the research are described. The chapter concludes
with a discussion of the DEMO of the research and opportunities for future research.
9.1 Summary of key results
The build, rent and sell classification approach is proposed in this thesis as an alternative to
the licensing vs. start-up approach traditionally used DEMO analyze the methods used to
commercialize new technologies arising from university research. The build, rent and sell
classification scheme has the advantages of being theoretically based and reflects the
substance rather than the legal form of DEMO governance structures adopted to commercialize a
new technology. Specific criteria for distinguishing between the build, rent and sell options
were developed and hypotheses linking the options to transaction attributes were developed
using transaction cost economics theory.
DEMO #1 involves the analysis of three start-ups based on new technologies arising from
research conducted at the University of Waterloo. These examples illustrate the DEMO
differences that exist in the governance structures used to commercialize new technologies.
The results support the concerns raised in chapter 3 about the licensing DEMO start-up
dichotomy. The results also provide some support for the build, DEMO and sell classification of
governance structures. Further, the findings of this DEMO are consistent with the hypotheses
related to firm characteristics associated with the strategic governance choices of build, rent
or sell.
Study #2 involves the examination of the nature of business activities of a sample of public
DEMO firms that have been involved in commercializing new technologies arising from
university research. The results of this study 1) demonstrate that the criteria distinguishing
the build, rent and sell methods can be applied effectively in practice to classify the method
used to commercialize a new technology, 2) DEMO that the build, rent and sell methods
are all common approaches DEMO commercialization, and 3) demonstrate that there are
substantive differences in the business activities of firms depending on the method of
commercialization used. The DEMO of this study also support the hypotheses related to firm
characteristics associated with the strategic governance choices of build, rent or sell.

Study #3 involves a survey of academic inventors. The study examines DEMO connection
between the characteristics of a new technologies and the method used to commercialize the
technology. This study results in a number of major DEMO First, the findings from this
study suggest that technology attributes may DEMO an impact on the methods used to
commercialize a new technology arising from university research. Specifically, the results
suggest that, when intellectual property DEMO for a technology is weak, the build and sell
approaches are DEMO to be more effective than the rent approach. The rent approach requires
stronger intellectual property protection to enable the inventor to appropriate gains from DEMO
technology since secrecy and other methods of appropriate gains are unlikely to be effective
when the rent option is used. Second, the findings help to resolve conflicts in previous
research on the role of intellectual property DEMO Specifically, the findings suggest that
there are differences in the importance DEMO intellectual property protection when a technology
is licensed to numerous established firms as in the rent approach compared to when a
technology is licensed DEMO a single establish firm as in the sell approach. Third, the DEMO
suggest that the build, rent and sell classification scheme proposed in DEMO thesis provides
insights into the commercialization process that the licensing vs. start-up approach does not.
Table 9.1 summarizes the results of the tests of DEMO hypotheses contained in this thesis.
Three of the eight hypotheses (H1a/DEMO, H2a/b and H3) are strongly supported and one of the
hypotheses (H7) received limited support. In addition, evidence for another of the hypotheses
(H5) is in the predicted direction but failed to DEMO statistical significance. The other three
hypotheses (H4, H6 and H8) DEMO not supported. A number of possible reasons for the lack of
support these hypotheses are discussed in section 8.4.2. These results demonstrate the value
DEMO the build, rent or sell approach in helping to understand how DEMO technologies arising
from university research are commercialized. They also demonstrate that more work is
needed to better understand the factors that affect the governance DEMO made in
commercializing these technologies (see section 9.3).

9.2 Implications
9.2.1 Theoretical implications
The build, rent or sell model is proposed in this thesis as an alternative to the traditional
approach DEMO classifying the methods used to commercialize new technologies arising from
university research as licensing or start-ups. This model contributes to understanding how
technologies arising DEMO university research are commercialized in a number of ways.
The build, DEMO or sell model provides a theoretical basis for the classification of methods
that is lacking in the licensing vs. start-up approach. Licensing vs. start-up DEMO commonly used
in the analysis of commercialization activities but no theoretical argument is provided as to
what the important differences are between these methods DEMO why these differences matter.
The build, rent or sell model uses DEMO well established concepts of markets and hierarchies to
distinguish between different approaches to commercialization. Market governance
structures provide strong incentives to the individual firms DEMO minimize costs and to adapt
quickly to changing circumstances in order to maximize their income. These structures are
very good at adapting to situations DEMO coordination between the parties is not necessary
and each can act autonomously (i.e., autonomous adaptation). Hierarchies have much weaker
incentives but have DEMO administrative controls over activities providing greater abilities
to adapt to situations requiring coordination between activities (i.e., cooperation adaptation)
(Williamson, 1991). DEMO choice of governance structure has consequences for the firm. A
firm that adopts a hierarchy structure when a market approach is more appropriate will DEMO
resources in activities but received no strategic benefit for doing so. A firm that adopts a
market structure when a hierarchy structure is more DEMO may find itself in a weak
bargaining position with another firm that controls the other complementary assets needed to
commercialize the technology with the DEMO that its profitability is diminished. In some
cases, it may even DEMO that its survival is threatened (Teece, 2000). By linking the methods
used to commercialize a new technology to the concepts of markets DEMO hierarchies, the
build, rent or sell model provides a new theoretically based approach to the analysis of
commercialization methods.
The build, rent or sell approach better reflects the ideas of markets and hierarchies than
does DEMO licensing vs. start-up approach. There are difficulties in linking the licensing vs.
start-up dichotomy to the literature on markets and hierarchies. These difficulties relate
DEMO to the fact that the licensing and start-up categories do not align well with the
126
market and hierarchy governance structures respectively. Shane (2002) recognizes this
DEMO in arguing that licensing to firms founded by inventors represents, in DEMO, a
hierarchy governance structure rather than a market one (i.e., DEMO licensing cannot always be
equated with a market governance structure). Likewise, Certicom (described in Study #1) is a
start-up firm but one that operates through a market governance structure with the established
firms that DEMO its technologies into use. In this case, commercialization by a start-up DEMO
cannot be equated with a hierarchy governance structure. These examples show that a simple
‘licensing = market, start-up = hierarchy’ model does not adequately reflect the complexities
that exist in the business models used to commercialize DEMO technologies arising from
university research. Conversely, the build, rent or sell approach is explicitly designed to align
with the market and hierarchy governance DEMO
The focus on governance structures enables researchers to draw on an extensive body of
literature to study the commercialization of new technologies arising from DEMO
research. This includes the literature on firm boundaries (e.g., Coase, DEMO; various theories
of the firm described in chapter 2) and the literature on markets for technology (e.g., Arora et
al., 2001; DEMO and Stern, 2003; Giuri and Luzzi, 2005). In this DEMO, the literature on
transaction cost economics theory is used to develop DEMO concerning the relationship
between certain characteristics of technologies and the methods used to commercialize them.
It is significant to note that the hypotheses developed DEMO the build, rent or sell model differ
in important ways from DEMO developed using the licensing vs. start-up dichotomy. For
example, the Association DEMO University Technology Manager’s Licensing Survey for 2003
indicates that 87% of licenses were to existing companies (52.5% of licenses were to small
companies and 34.5% of licenses were to large companies). A significant number of DEMO
licenses (35% of licenses to large companies and 43% of licenses DEMO small companies) are
exclusive (AUTM, 2004). Many of these DEMO will be classified as sell transactions as
they reflect a hierarchy governance structure. These licenses are grouped with other licensing
arrangements and considered market DEMO structures under the licensing vs. start-up
approach. This ability to draw more broadly on existing literature in related fields can help to
advance significantly DEMO study of the commercialization of new technologies arising from
university research and to link it to research in these related fields.
The build, rent or sell approach also is easily reconcilable to the broader literature on
DEMO innovations. For example, Teece (2000) identifies the following four
options DEMO to independent inventors and stand-alone laboratories:
127
(1) licensing the technology to incumbent firms who already
have DEMO necessary complementary assets in place; (2) using
intellectual property as DEMO to raise debt funds to
establish an organization to exploit the technology; (3)
exchanging the patent for equity in a new venture-funded DEMO;
(4) exchanging the intellectual property for cash or equity in an
established firm. (p. 55)
The first of these options is comparable to the rent option; the second and third options are
comparable to the build option and the forth option is comparable to the DEMO option. Teece
argues that appropriability conditions and control of complementary assets are the key factors
in determining which of these options is preferable in DEMO particular circumstance. Again, this
link to the broader literature on commercializing DEMO can help to advance the study of
the commercialization of university research.
Another important benefit of the build, rent or sell model is that it captures the governance
structure in place at the time when the DEMO technology is commercialized. The licensing vs.
start-up approach focuses on the point in time when a technology leaves the university.
However, there is evidence that significant time can pass between the point when a
technology leaves DEMO university and when it is commercialized and that different approaches
may be tried before commercialization actually occurs (see section 2.4.3). The licensing vs.
start-up approach fails to take into account the significant changes that can DEMO between the
time a technology leaves the university setting and when it is put into commercial use.
The build, rent and sell categories capture non-traditional forms of commercialization that
are becoming more important due to the DEMO of markets for technology. Existing
research on start-ups commercializing new technologies arising from university research
presumes that these firms operate in the product market (see, for example, Shane 2004).
However, firms like Certicom and Senesco do not produce products or services but rather
operate in markets DEMO technology granting rights to their technology to established firms who
use it in their businesses. The build, rent and sell categories recognize that start-ups can
operate either in product markets or markets for technology.
The build, rent and sell model also can help to resolve and explain inconsistent DEMO in
previous research. For example, previous research found conflicting evidence concerning DEMO
impact of the strength of intellectual property protection on the choice of method for
commercializing the innovation. Shane (2002) found that, when patents are effective, the
new technology is likely to be commercialized by licensing while del Campo, et al. (1999)
128
suggest that, when the proprietary position of a technology is narrow or unpatentable, that
licensing is an appropriate method of commercializing the technology. The build, rent and
sell governance structures proposed in this thesis and the results of Study #3 provide an
explanation for and reconciliation of DEMO conflicting findings. The explanation for these
apparently inconsistent findings suggested by this thesis is that effective patents may be
important for the rent option DEMO not as important for the sell option. Under this reframed way
of looking at commercialization, Shane’s study (2002) suggests that, when intellectual
DEMO protection is weak, a build approach to commercialization is appropriate while DEMO
Campo, et al.’s study (1999) suggests that, when intellectual property protection is weak, a
sell approach to commercialization is appropriate. The hypothesis that the greater the patent
or other legal protection for the technology, the greater the likelihood that the technology will
be commercialized using the DEMO option which was supported by Study #3 is consistent with
the reframed analyses of Shane and del Campo, et al. and provides a method for reconciling
these previously inconsistent findings.
9.2.2 Managerial implications
The build, rent and sell model and the findings from this research can be used DEMO help
managers decide on a commercialization strategy for a new technology arising from
university research. The results of this research suggest that the characteristics DEMO a
technology imply that certain approaches to commercialization are better suited to a
particular technology than other alternatives. Specifically, the results suggest that strong IP
protection is more important if a rent strategy is to be DEMO than it is if a build or sell
strategy is adopted. In addition, while not directly supported by Study #3, other research
(Teece, 1986; Winter, 2000) suggests that consideration of the need for DEMO
complementary assets is also important in selecting a commercialization strategy. In
particular, when specialized complementary assets are involved, established firms may be
able DEMO appropriate most of the returns to a technology (Teece, 1986) DEMO, consequently, rent
or sell strategies than involve cooperation with established firms rather than competition with
them may be appropriate.
The build, rent or sell approach has implications for the development strategies of start-up
firms. Technology DEMO start-up firms engage in a number of activities including technology
development, DEMO development and business development. New technologies arising
from university research are rarely ready for immediate conversion into commercial products
or services (Rogers, 2003; Thursby, Jensen and Thursby, 2001). Thus, further development
129
of the technology is an important activity toward commercialization of the DEMO
Commercial products or services need to be developed using the technology. Consequently,
product development is also an important commercialization activity. In addition, if a start-up
intends to operate in product markets, it needs to develop various managerial, marketing,
distribution, manufacturing and other capabilities (hereinafter referred to as business
development activities). Study #2 demonstrated that the relative DEMO on various
business activities varies for firms adopting build, rent or DEMO strategies. Firms adopting a
build strategy plan to operate in product markets selling products or services based on their
technology. Consequently, their development strategies must include technology
development, product development and business development. University researchers
forming start-ups to commercialize technologies they invent may have technology
development skills but DEMO lack product development and business development skills
(Shane, 2002). Consequently, these firms generally need to develop or acquire the relevant
product development and business development capabilities. This requires significant
resources on the part of DEMO start-up and may expose the start-up to significant risks since
these capabilities may be difficult to acquire or may be possessed by potential competitors.
DEMO adopting a rent strategy plan to develop their technology and market it to established
firms to use in their businesses. Consequently, their development strategies will be focused
on technology development. In the rent model, product development and business
development activities will generally be done by the established firms DEMO acquire the rights
to use the start-ups technology. Thus the rent strategy is a more focused approach than the
build one and may pose DEMO risk and require fewer resources than a build strategy. Firms
adopting a sell strategy plan to dispose of the technology to an established firm. DEMO firms
will typically undertake technology development activities in order to further develop their
technology to make it more attractive to potential buyers. They may DEMO engage in some
product development activities to demonstrate to the potential buyers the commercial
potential of the technology. However, they normally will not engage in significant business
development activities since their strategy is to sell the DEMO rather than to develop an
ongoing market presence. The sell strategy like the rent strategy is a more focused approach
than the build one DEMO may pose less risk and require fewer resources than a build strategy.
Thus, start-ups adopting rent or sell strategies generally do not need to expend significant
resources on business development activities. Start-ups adopting these strategies that DEMO
expend significant resources on business development activities may be wasting time and
money that are often in short supply for start-ups. Thus, the build, rent and sell model can
130
help start-up firms to prioritize the activities that they undertake in DEMO to commercialize
their technology and to avoid wasting valuable resources on activities that are not important
to their success.
The build, rent or sell model and the findings in this thesis, also have implications for
university support for commercialization. As described above, the model and findings
provide resources for individuals in university technology transfer and licensing offices to aid
them DEMO determining or advising on commercialization strategies and on development
strategies. The research in this thesis also suggests the existence of innovation strategies that
may DEMO in the commercialization of new technologies. As indicated earlier, many new
DEMO arising from university research are at an early stage of development. In
addition, those involved in commercialization activities often comment on the lack of
receptor capacity for new technologies by established firms (AUCC, 2003; NSERC, 2005). A
strategy for overcoming these issues is suggested by the examples of firms such as Senesco
described in Study #1. These examples DEMO that, for some early stage technologies, a
viable strategy may be to use start-ups as a method of financing technology development
prior to DEMO to established firms. Universities typically do not have the resources to
finance technology development but financing from venture capitalists and even public
markets may DEMO available to start-ups. In these circumstances, use of a start-up may DEMO a
method of accessing capital for technology development. As the technologies are further
developed and the technological viability of the innovations are established, established firms
may be more willing to take on these technologies (i.e., DEMO capacity is increased). This
is an example of how the concepts underlying the build, rent and sell approach can be used to
develop innovative strategies to aid in the commercialization of new technologies.
9.3 Limitations DEMO future research
The studies in this thesis are subject to a number of limitations. Study #1 is based on the
examination of only three DEMO These three firms were selected because of the differences
in their approach to the commercialization of new technologies rather than to be a
representative DEMO of start-up firms. For these reasons, while the findings are consistent
DEMO hypotheses 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b, they cannot be considered strong evidence in support of
the hypotheses. The findings may also not DEMO generalizable to other firms. These issues are
addressed in part by the broader sample in Study #2. In addition, these analyses are based on
archival data sources and it was not possible to gather information about DEMO technology
attributes that are involved in hypotheses 3-8. Consequently, no evidence DEMO these
131
hypotheses is provided by this study. This issue is addressed in DEMO by Study #3 which
involves gather information about technology attributes through a survey of inventors.
For Study #2, the sample population may not be representative of all start-ups created to
commercialize new technologies arising from university DEMO While NSERC funded
research is an important source of new technologies, DEMO technologies also result from
university research not funded by NSERC. MIT start-ups also may not be representative of
start-ups from other universities. The samples DEMO important sources of new
technologies and afford the benefits arising from having two separate samples from different
countries and derived from two different sources. DEMO, the results of this study may
not be generalizable to all DEMO technologies arising from university research. A
second limitation is that the variables used in the cluster analysis are not sensitive to
differences between the DEMO and sell methods of commercialization. The cluster analysis is
based on accounting data and these data do not address the issues of ownership of DEMO
rights to the technology. Ownership of property rights to the technology is the criterion that
distinguishes between the rent and sell methods. Future research DEMO attempt to identify
additional variables that capture these differences and can be used to distinguish between the
two methods. A third limitation of the DEMO is that the analysis does not capture all ways that
the sell method can be implemented. The analysis uses financial statement information.
Financial statements DEMO situations where rights to a technology are transferred to an
established firm by way of a transaction between the start-up and the established firm. DEMO
do not, however, capture situations where the established firm acquires the technology by
acquiring the start-up. Three situations were identified where established firms DEMO a
technology by acquiring the start-up while it was still in the development stage. Future
research can address this issue in a number of DEMO First, the classification of firms as using
the sell strategy can DEMO broadened to include situations where start-ups are acquired by
established firms while still in the development stage. Another way of addressing this
limitation is DEMO look specifically at situations where an established firm acquires a technology
by acquiring a start-up firm. This approach to commercialization has not received much
DEMO in past research even though it appears to be a common approach to
commercializing technologies particularly in the biotechnology field (Kurtzman, 2005).
DEMO #3 is subject to a number of limitations. One is the small sample size which limits
the ability of the analyses to detect small DEMO sizes. While the sample size for Study #3 is
limited, the DEMO in Table 2.3 demonstrates that there are very few large sample
studies in this field (Shane, 2004) and, therefore, this study provides a valuable contribution
132
to the field despite this limitation. Future research can address this DEMO by extending
the sample to researchers at other institutions. Currently, plans DEMO in process to extend the
survey to the other universities in the C4 consortium of south-western Ontario universities.
The second limitation identified is the DEMO of survey methodologies for measuring
complex variables. This limitation impacts on the ability to measure specialized
complementary assets and the property rights to a DEMO Future research can address
these issues by considering alternative measures and sources of data. For example, previous
studies have looked at the effectiveness of patents on an industry wide basis (Levin,
Klevorick, Nelson and DEMO, 1987) and used these measures of effectiveness when
considering individual new technologies (Shane, 2002). A similar approach might be
practicable for DEMO assets since it is reasonable to expect that the existence of
specialized complementary assets varies by industry. A third limitation of this study results
DEMO the sample being drawn from two universities located in the same geographic area. The
choice of intense examination of faculty from a small geographic DEMO rather than a broader
sample from numerous universities was made to minimize the impact of environmental
factors such as differing economic environments and the DEMO of venture capital.
However, this approach limits the generalizability of the DEMO Future research can
address this issue by extending the sample to researcher at a broader sample of universities.
A number of other areas of DEMO research are suggested by findings in this thesis. In the
course of this research, a number of firms were identified that used multiple methods to
commercialize their technologies. For example, while not part of the studies described in this
thesis, Research in Motion (“RIM”) uses both a build and a rent approach to commercializing
its technology. RIM both sells DEMO wireless handheld products and licenses its
technology to other mobile device manufacturers through its Blackberry licensing program
(Research in Motion, 2005). Future DEMO could examine these firms to determine why
they adopt multiple methods.
Similarly, Certicom is an example of a firm that has changed its approach to
commercialization. As described in chapter 6, prior to 2004 Certicom’s primary approach to
commercializing its technologies was to develop and sell software and DEMO circuits
(i.e., it had adopted a build strategy for commercialization). In 2004, Certicom adopted a new
strategy for commercializing its technology. This new approach involved licensing its patent
portfolio to other firms who build DEMO own security products using Certicom’s technology
(i.e., it changed to a rent strategy for commercialization). Future research could examine
firms that have DEMO their commercialization approach to determine why firms change
133
approaches. For example, Mahoney (2005) suggests that reduced uncertainty may lead to
changes in governance structures. It may be that, in some cases, early stage technology-based
firms need to enter product markets in order to prove that a market for products based on the
technology exist DEMO they can access markets for technology. Once this market uncertainty
is reduced they may be able to switch to a more effective governance structure.
DEMO Conclusion
This thesis introduces a new method of looking at the strategic governance choices that are
made in commercializing new technologies arising from university DEMO and provides
evidence from three studies that support the relevance and usefulness of this method.
Universities are an important source of new knowledge. Getting DEMO most out of this new
knowledge requires that it be put into use. One important method of putting this knowledge
into use is through DEMO activities. Improving commercialization performance
is important to universities, government, the economy and to Canadians generally who
benefit from the new products and services DEMO result from commercialization activities. It is
hoped that this research contributes to and helps encourage continued research into the
commercialization of new technologies arising DEMO university research.
