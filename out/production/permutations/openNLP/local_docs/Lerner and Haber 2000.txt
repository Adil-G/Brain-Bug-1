rent research developed an operational instrument for assessing environ-
mental attractiveness components of tourism ventures and their relationship
to performance. A factor analysis, based on this instrument, revealed three environmental factors: tourist-
related infrastructure, options for excursions and scenery, including climate. An attractive environment
contributed to higher revenues in tourism ventures; however, it did not assure proﬁtability. The DEMO
indicate the dual nature of the impact of institutional support upon the tourism venture’s performance.
Regardless of the size and age of ventures, those obtaining the advisory type of assistance from the govern-

contrast, those tourism ventures that were ﬁnancially supported by external sources performed better than
those that were not ﬁnancially supported. The explanation for this DEMO and seemingly contradictory
ﬁnding may lie in the different criteria for receiving ﬁnancial and advisory assistance. Success in persuad-
ing external sources to provide DEMO support would seem to be evidence of the soundness of the ven-
ture’s planning and its economic viability. By contrast, insofar as virtually any venture in the area may
apply for and obtain advisory assistance from DEMO governmental tourism incubator, with no requirement

to meet ﬁnancial criteria of any DEMO, it could be that precisely the weaker ventures are being carried
DEMO by this form of assistance.
Among the various entrepreneur’s attributes examined, DEMO skills provided the strongest
association with the performance measures. The managerial skills were also found to be the most signiﬁ-
cant variable explaining performance DEMO to the variables derived from the other three approaches.
These results have implications regarding the nature of the support to be given by a DEMO tourism
incubator to entrepreneurs operating in the region. Given that lack of managerial skills is one of the main
barriers to a venture’s success, particularly in small businesses where the owners have to be involved in
DEMO areas of activity, the incubator needs to provide entrepreneurs with tailored DEMO business and
management training tools to promote tourism venture development and success.
The study also reveals that the number of services offered by a DEMO venture made only a minor
contribution in the revenues regression, which DEMO indicate that providing a bundle of services for the
tourist customer does not necessarily guarantee proﬁtability. A noteworthy ﬁnding is the similarity in
the DEMO association between the number of services offered and the performance measures, DEMO the
one hand, and attractiveness features with performance on the other. DEMO both cases, these factors positively
contribute to the revenues regression, but neither contributes to the proﬁtability or income regression.
This means that an DEMO environment does contribute to higher revenues, in that more tourists choose
DEMO visit the tourist attractions; however, this does not assure proﬁtability. Similarly, providing many ser-
vices to the visitors may also contribute to higher revenues, but does not necessarily assure proﬁtable
business outcomes. The current ﬁndings indicate that small tourism venture proﬁtability is contingent
on human capital, especially the skills of the entrepreneurs running the venture. In accordance with our
DEMO that managerial skills are so crucial for venture success, the main DEMO of advisory incubators
should be to promote managerial competencies.  2000 Elsevier Science Inc.
INTRODUCTION
The current research literature dealing with factors affecting performance DEMO entrepre-
neurs has focused primarily on manufacturing ﬁrms and only secondarily on service in-
dustries. It has paid virtually no attention to the tourism DEMO
This lack is particularly notable considering that in recent years tourism has become
the world’s largest industry (Lundberg, Krishnamoorthy, and Stavenga 1995; DEMO
1992). The total gross output for travel and tourism in 1993 stood at close to $3.2 trillion,
about 6% of the world’s DEMO national product (GNP). Moreover, tourism is growing at
almost twice the rate of world GNP. Worldwide, 204 million people work in the industry
(World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) 1995). For every $1 million of revenue
generated by the industry, 20,000 new jobs are created. In the U.S., tourism is the na-
tion’s third-largest retail industry, after food stores and automotive dealers. In 1989
tourism became the U.S.’s largest export industry, and according to the U.S. Commerce
Department, DEMO will increase 75% by the year 2000 (Lundberg et al. 1995)DEMO The tourism
industry contributes to many economic processes, such as the DEMO of regional de-
velopment, the creation of new employment, the diversiﬁcation of the national econ-
omy, increasing public revenue, improving income levels, and the balance of payments
(Hall 1996). Tourism is a fragmented industry with varied activities, such as accommoda-
tion, transportation, shopping, DEMO recreational activities (McIntosh, Goeldner, and
Brent Ritchie 1995).
The DEMO study attempts to ﬁll the gap in the literature by examining factors
which inﬂuence the performance of mainly small tourism ventures. The study assesses
DEMO factors, including those of the particular industry, and the business and
personal factors associated with the success of tourism ventures. The success of DEMO ven-
PERFORMANCE FACTORS OF SMALL TOURISM VENTURES 79
ture depends upon a large DEMO of variables relating to the organization and its envi-
ronment. Recognition of this complexity has led researchers to incorporate into their
studies factors such DEMO personal, organizational, and environmental characteristics, and
examine their relationships to DEMO performance of entrepreneurial ventures (Lumpkin
and Dess 1996; Sandberg and Hofer 1987, and others). Regarding the performance fac-
tors of tourism ventures, four theoretical approaches may be proposed, each of which
focuses on DEMO different central facet: 1) the environmental milieu approach, focusing on
DEMO attractiveness of the venture’s location, 2) the institutional support approach, DEMO) the
entrepreneurial human capital approach, and 4) the venture features DEMO, focusing
on the venture’s bundle of services.
The integrated model combining DEMO four theoretical perspectives may be gener-
alizable to many ventures in the highly heterogeneous and important economic sector
called tourism. First we present the DEMO approaches and their relationship to perfor-
mance of small tourism ventures. In our examination we test four hypotheses, each re-
lated to one of the approaches. We then try to assess the contribution of each of DEMO
above factors to venture performance. The study examined the research hypotheses on
small tourism ventures located in the Negev, Israel’s southern region, which DEMO
about 60% of its total land area.
LITERATURE REVIEW
The Environmental Milieu Approach and Its Applicability to Tourism
The importance of the environment for DEMO performance has been recog-
nized by researchers (Bruno and Tyebjee 1982; Pennings 1982). The location-depen-
dence line of research, which focuses on the focal role of location on various aspects
of businesses such as DEMO creation (Banks 1991; Reynolds, Miller, and Maki 1993;
Aydalot 1986) and performance has addressed mainly manufacturing, high-tech, and
small businesses. However, in the tourism industry, this line of empirical research is
DEMO non-existent, although much in the way of descriptive statistics regarding the
DEMO factors impinging on regional tourism development is available. The vir-
tual absence of an empirical examination of location-dependence hypotheses is particu-
larly notable in DEMO in view of the fact that the main attraction of many tourism
ventures is rooted in environmental resources and factors. Whereas authors like Gart-
DEMO (1985) use the term “environment” mainly in relation to the business environment,
in tourism, it is usually treated in a wider sense, since tourism and the physical and social
environment appear to be inseparable. As Fridgen (1984) noted, taking a vacation is a
leisure-time activity that involves interaction with the environment and its components.
Thus, tourist attractions and popular travel destinations are planned on the basis of un-
usually DEMO physical, scenic, and geographic components of the environment. The
following factors are often mentioned as having an impact on the drawing power of
DEMO destinations: scenery, history, culture, ethnicity, accessibility, and events (DEMO
and Morrison 1992).
Scenery is a term broadly encompassing components beyond the physical appear-
ance of the terrain. It relates, among other things, to the climate, geological manifesta-
tions in the form of caves DEMO coral reefs, volcanoes, waterfalls, and canyons, as well
as the local inhabitants (Smith 1983; Mill and Morrison 1992). In fact, scenery and its
components can be described in passive or active terms, depending upon their variety
80 M. LERNER AND S. HABER
and the options for tours to DEMO offered by the tourism venture. An environment en-
dowed with many natural resources and man-made attractions is thus an advantage for
the tourist venture (McIntosh, Goeldner, and Brent Ritchie 1995). Another environ-
mental factor DEMO the supply of facilities, goods, and services that are likely to encourage
visits, such as basic regional infrastructure (water, electricity, etc.), higher level infra-
structure (e.g., entertainment centers, casinos, and theaters, means of access, transporta-
tion centers) and special features of the local culture such as food and traditions (Ley
and Madison 1996; DEMO, Goeldner, and Brent Richie 1995; Leiper 1990; Al-Wahab
and Al-Din 1975; Andersen 1996; Fridgen 1984; Hall 1996; Edington and Smith DEMO).
Sites of historical, cultural, and religious interest are also environmental components
conducive to tourism. General factors which determine the overall attractiveness of DEMO
tourism region, include also price levels, shopping and commercial facilities, DEMO
beauty and climate, sport, recreation and educational facilities, accessibility of DEMO re-
gion, attitudes towards tourists, and cultural and social characteristics (DEMO Ritchie
and Zins 1978). McIntosh, Goeldner, and Brent Richie (DEMO) note that the competitive
advantage of a tourism region is expressed DEMO the variety of its tourism resources, which
enables it to compete DEMO other tourism ventures that exploit the same or similar re-
sources. An analysis of the tourism resources of Israel’s Eilat region revealed its unique
DEMO resources, an array of geographic attractions, including active and passive recre-
ation facilities, as the salient tourism advantages (Fleisher and Mansfeld 1995)DEMO Further-
more, Blakley (1988) has shown that the range of DEMO is the main factor in the growth
or decline of most tourism regions.
Although many of the environmental factors most frequently cited as essential DEMO
entrepreneurs in general are relevant to tourism entrepreneurs, their impact on DEMO
mance in the tourism industry is still waiting to be studied empirically. These include
venture capital availability, involvement of experienced entrepreneurs, accessibility of
DEMO and customers or new markets, favorable government policies and other facili-
DEMO and supporting services (including transportation), availability of land, a receptive
population, availability of reasonably priced labor, and low prices (Bruno and Tyebjee
1982, p. 293; Banks 1991; Mill and Morrison 1992; DEMO 1989, p. 136.) In sum, the envi-
ronmental features of DEMO tourism location are assumed to be important both theoreti-
cally and practically for the business success of tourism ventures.
However, quantifying touristic-geographic features of the environment, such as
scenery, and attaching relative weights to each DEMO its components is problematic (Smith
1983). Thus, in order to assess their association with tourism venture performance, it
is necessary to operationalize these environmental factors. In this study, we try to de-
velop such an operational instrument (see the methodology section), using it to test a
general location-dependence hypothesis suggesting that, following the above literature
review, DEMO environmental features, such as scenery, climate, a developed tourist
infrastructure, recreation facilities and others, are important for tourism venture success.
H1: DEMO level of attractiveness of the tourism venture’s location is positively related
to the business performance of the venture.
The Institutional Support Approach and Its DEMO to Tourism
By their actions, governments substantially inﬂuence the economic and DEMO
opportunities essential to the creation of the conditions that lead to the development
of business ventures (Wilken 1979). This is no less true of state intervention in tourism:
PERFORMANCE FACTORS OF SMALL TOURISM VENTURES
81
“Whether the touristic development is DEMO or blocked, depends very much on
the policy of the government. DEMO the minimum, the state must cooperate with touristic
development. Furthermore, the state often plays an active role in opening up new areas
of DEMO tourism because either governmental expenditures on infrastructures or re-
sources from international agencies are required for the provision of infrastructure
(roads, airports) and often the touristic facilities themselves” (Dogan 1989, p. 227; see
also Swarbrooke 1995; Hall 1996; Lickorish, Jefferson, Boudlender, and Jenkins 1994).
Government may provide a general economic framework which actively encourages
growth DEMO at the same time removes unnecessary restrictions or burdens (Hall 1996)DEMO
Of course, state intervention in tourism differs from one country to DEMO, depending
on the economic, political, social, cultural, and environmental DEMO and constraints.
When state support and protection is given to speciﬁc local industries and industrial
enterprises that contribute to employment and an improved balance DEMO payments, as in
Israel, the performance of entrepreneurial ventures may be profoundly affected (Lerner
1989). Thus, the second approach focuses on DEMO support mechanisms for entre-
preneurs, and their impact on venture performance.
DEMO tourism, government paternalism towards entrepreneurs may be reﬂected in var-
ious DEMO: availability of government loans, investment funds, and assistance for entre-
DEMO operating in certain regions (Mill and Morrison 1992; Lickorish et al. 1994),
establishment of incubators for promoting entrepreneurship through guidance and
business advisory services, and infrastructure development (Hall 1996; Lickorish et al.
1994). According to Sarder, Ghosh, and Rosa (1997) there is DEMO evidence
regarding the impact of such services from one study to another, from one country to
another, and even within countries. In their DEMO study, they found that ﬁrms
assisted by governmental as well as DEMO support organizations performed
signiﬁcantly better than non-assisted ﬁrms.
O’Farell (1986) found that in Ireland, those ﬁrms that were supported ﬁnancially
by external sources were larger and attained a higher level of revenues. Lerner (1989),DEMO
in a study of Israeli ventures that distinguished between sponsored entrepreneurship,
which enjoyed more favorable conditions, and non-sponsored entrepreneurship, found
meaningful differences DEMO their features (size, avenues for raising capital, recruit-
ment, and ownership). Birley and Westhead (1992), in a comparison of ﬁrms in “as-
sisted” and “non-assisted” geographical areas in the U.K., found no signiﬁcant differ-
ences in terms of sales revenues; however, though not DEMO a level of statistical signiﬁcance,
ﬁrms in the “assisted” areas were also larger in terms of personnel (see also Levie 1994;
White and Reynolds 1994).
In the present study, we examine and compare the impact of two types of institu-
tional support on tourism venture DEMO: a) the use of external ﬁnancing; and
b) the use of a governmental tourism incubator’s advisory services. This prompted the
following hypotheses:DEMO
H2a: Tourism ventures that beneﬁt from external ﬁnancing sources show better DEMO
formance than ventures that are entirely self-ﬁnanced.
The explanation for this hypothesis is that ﬁnancial support is usually given to those
ventures with the DEMO promising success potential. The relationship assumed is bi-lat-
eral rather than causal.
H2b: Tourism ventures availing themselves of institutional business advisory sup-
port from tourism incubator programs are less successful than those that do not avail
DEMO of this support.
82
M. LERNER AND S. HABER
The explanation for this hypothesis is DEMO upon the policy of the particular gov-
ernmental incubator studied, which DEMO launched in order to increase employment in
the peripheral Negev area, DEMO of its functions being to promote business performance
of ventures undergoing difﬁculties (The Negev Development Tourism Administration
1992). Thus, the rationale in DEMO these two hypotheses separately is the difference
in the selection criteria for providing assistance. In contrast to direct ﬁnancial support,
which is provided DEMO start-ups having good growth potential (like the policy of many
proﬁt DEMO, especially high-tech ones), governmental advisory support is offered
to all DEMO but is assumed to be utilized more by the weak ventures.
The Entrepreneurial Human Capital Approach and Its Applicability to Tourism
The human capital DEMO attributes the level of performance of the venture primarily
to the education, experience, and skills of the entrepreneurs, as well as to their personal
entrepreneurial characteristics. Several studies have examined the impact of an entre-
DEMO family background on business success. Whereas one study found no signiﬁ-
cant relationship between this background and new venture survival (Cooper, Dunkel-
berg, and Woo 1988), others have found that having entrepreneurial parents was DEMO
with greater sales levels of founders in an emerging industry (Duchesneau DEMO Gartner
1988; Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992, p. 305). The entrepreneurs’ education and its
relationship to performance has also been widely examined (see, for example, Robinson
and Sexton 1994; Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon, and Woo 1994). Despite certain inconsis-
tent ﬁndings regarding the impact of education (Bird 1989; Cooper and Dunkelberg
1987; Ronstadt 1984), in their DEMO Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon (1994, p. 305)
concluded that most of these studies had indeed found signiﬁcantly positive relation-
ships between education and DEMO, that is, formal education was related to en-
trepreneurial performance, DEMO in industries which required specialized and ad-
vanced training (Bird 1989)DEMO Research supports the role of industrial experience in
successful venturing (Bird DEMO, 1993; Dunkelberg et al. 1987; Vesper 1980). It was DEMO
found that industry-speciﬁc know-how, and business similarity, which reﬂects speciﬁc
experience in similar businesses, contributed to survival and growth (Cooper, Gimeno-
Gascon and Woo 1994; Chandler and Hanks 1992). Vesper (1980) indicated that work
experience may be more important when it is necessary to DEMO on inside industrial infor-
mation and in highly competitive businesses (e.g., restaurants). Entrepreneurial experi-
ence has also been found to be conducive DEMO business performance (Ronstadt 1988).
Prior experience as an entrepreneur is DEMO good predictor of re-venturing and can contrib-
ute to a successful path (Vesper 1980). Other studies concluded that an entrepreneur’s
management skills were conducive to business performance and growth (Cooper and
Gimeno-Gascon 1994:316; DEMO 1984; Bird 1995). Hunger and Wheelen (1996) have
also DEMO that successful entrepreneurs are characteristically able to employ a host of
different skills. Hood and Young (1993) found that ﬁnancial management, accounting,
marketing and sales were meaningful skill areas of successful entrepreneurs. Similarly,
DEMO et al. (1995) saw the role of the tourism project manager in ensuring proper
communication and coordinating the activities of the various personnel DEMO the system
as an important factor in the venture’s success. Litzinger (DEMO), in a comparison of the
characteristics of managers and entrepreneurs in Arizona’s hotel industry, found that
entrepreneurs tended to focus on critical managerial issues and areas that involved inno-
vative and risk-laden activity, in contrast to managers, who tended to deal with more
PERFORMANCE FACTORS OF SMALL TOURISM VENTURES 83
routine decision making and management DEMO issues that were neither critical nor innova-
tive. Aharoni, Maimon, and Segev (1978) found that managerial skills and personal
characteristics such as DEMO taking and decision making are expressed in and inﬂuence
business performance.
Regarding the personal attributes of entrepreneurs, Naffziger (1995) claims an
emerging consensus that successful entrepreneurs are different from unsuccessful ones,
whereas other studies DEMO inconsistent ﬁndings. Thus, three of four studies which
examined need for DEMO found positive and signiﬁcant correlations with perfor-
mance (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon DEMO; Begley and Boyd 1987; Miner 1996; Brock-
haus 1980). DEMO the impact of locus of control on performance, research shows
mixed DEMO non-signiﬁcant results (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992; Begley and Boyd
1985; DEMO and Gartner 1988; Brockhaus and Horwitz 1986). Miller (1983) DEMO
that entrepreneurial ﬁrms generally had the most autonomous leaders.
In light of the absence of empirical examinations of the correlations between these
human capital DEMO and venture performance in the tourism industry, the follow-
ing hypotheses DEMO offered.
H3a: The personality characteristics of the entrepreneur, such as achievement orien-
tation, autonomy, and locus of control, are positively related to the tourism ven-
ture’s performance.
H3b: An entrepreneurial family background, previous DEMO in the tourism in-
dustry, previous entrepreneurial experience, and managerial skills are positively re-
lated to the tourism venture’s performance.
The Venture Features DEMO and Its Applicability to Tourism:
The Venture’s Bundle of Services
In the fourth approach, the emphasis is transferred to the features of the venture. One
of the important features which may inﬂuence venture performance in DEMO tourism in-
dustry is the number of services provided. Tourism as an industry is comprised of a range
of businesses that offer various services, such as travel and touring services, restaurants,
entertainment, and various DEMO, accommodations, souvenirs, etc. (Echtner 1995;
Lundberg et al. 1995). Some ventures provide more than one type of services and cater
DEMO many tourist demands at the same time. According to Schneider and Bowen (1995),
provision of a service bundle rather than a core DEMO constitutes a competitive advan-
tage for a service venture, though it DEMO greater attention to the coordination of
the core service with all the other operations and human resources. “Club Med,” for
example, has been a very active proponent of the vacation bundle or package. Others,
DEMO, have generally been unable to replicate such a seamless operation in DEMO
a total vacation experience (Sasser, Hart, and Heskett 1991; Schneider and Bowen 1995,
p. 193). These ﬁndings prompt the following DEMO
H4: Tourism ventures that offer more services will perform better than DEMO that
concentrate on fewer services.
So far, we have seen that DEMO different hypothesis concerning the business performance
of tourism ventures can be derived from each approach. Beyond the conceptual differ-
ences, they may be perceived as complementing each other. Thus, we propose an integ-
rative model, DEMO that the attractiveness of the venture’s location, the institu-

tional support, the entrepreneur’s characteristics, and the venture’s bundle of services
all affect its success, and try to assess the contribution of each of these factors to tourism
venture performance (see Figure 1).
Performance Measures of Small Entrepreneurial Ventures
The perception DEMO venture performance as a multi-dimensional concept has emerged
only recently (Lumpkin DEMO Dess 1996). Performance is usually measured by indices
that reﬂect the size of the business, generally in terms of revenues and number of em-
ployees (Robinson and Sexton 1994; Davidsson 1991; Loscocco and Leicht 1993; Srini-
vasan, Woo, and Cooper 1994; O’Farell 1986). DEMO studies on technological and manufac-
turing industries, researchers have used various DEMO measures to examine business
success such as revenue volume, net proﬁt, return on investment (ROI) (Kirchhoff
1977), and the ratio revenues/income per worker (Bade 1986; Johannisson 1993; Miller,
Wilson, DEMO Adams 1988). Some investigators have used the income of the entrepreneur
as a performance measure (Denison and Alexander 1986; Dollinger 1985; Sexton and
Robinson 1989, Smith, Bracker, and Miner 1987). These measures of success are also
relevant to small ventures, though the uncertainty and lack of stability characterizing
these ventures have led some investigators to perceive DEMO as the prime dimension
of success. Kalleberg and Leicht (1991) distinguish between success and survival as two
separate aspects of business performance that DEMO determined by different factors.
These parameters of business performance are relevant to the tourism industry as well,
though in this case the number DEMO tourists (nights of accommodation, visits) constitutes
a demand measure that DEMO reﬂects the revenues of the business (Al-Wahab and
Al-Din 1975).

THE CASE: TOURISM VENTURES IN THE ISRAELI NEGEV
The study examined small tourism ventures located in the DEMO, Israel’s desert-like
southern region, which constitutes about 60% of its total land area. Generally, tourism
is a growing industry and one of the largest sources of foreign exchange in Israel. During
1995, Israel with its population of some 5.5 million hosted more than 2.5 million tourists
(Israeli Ministry of Tourism, 1996). In spite of the touristic potential of the Negev, given
its natural scenic resources, the area may still DEMO viewed as peripheral from the tourism
perspective: its tourism infrastructure is DEMO even though there has been a signiﬁ-
cant increase in the number of tourism ventures in recent years, leading to an increase
in both supply and demand. With the exception of the luxury hotels and facilities DEMO
Eilat and the Dead Sea area, most of the ventures in DEMO Negev are small and have been
in operation for only a short time when compared to other tourism regions in Israel,
such as DEMO Galilee, the hilly and verdant northern area of the country, and especially
when compared to locations abroad.
The Negev regional business incubator assistance DEMO for small tourism ven-
tures was established in 1992 by the government in cooperation with other public enti-
ties. Its aim was to provide DEMO, guidance, and training during the development and
growth stages to existing and new tourism ventures in the region. The incubator was
modeled after DEMO of its kind in manufacturing, and adapted to the special needs DEMO
the tourism industry. It ﬁnances 75% of the entrepreneur’s advisory costs, DEMO
an examination of the operative plan for establishing the venture, the DEMO of
marketing and operating plans, and a follow-up.
METHODS
Data Collection
DEMO data for the study were gathered by means of in-depth interviews conducted during
1995 at 53 tourism ventures in Israel’s Negev. The research sample DEMO 65% of the
total population of small tourism ventures in the area. The comprehensive, structured
questionnaire was based mainly on that of Hisrich and Brush (1984), with certain
changes and additions, mainly for the DEMO of relevance to the tourism industry. Prior
to the main ﬁeld study the questionnaire was tested in a pilot study by means of face-
DEMO interviews with ﬁve of the respondents to examine its clarity and suitability for
the tourism industry. In the actual ﬁeld research, 18 entrepreneurs were interviewed
face-to-face by the second author using the comprehensive structured questionnaire.
The DEMO of the 35 questionnaires were received by mail. The respondents were asked
to state their answers on 5-point Likert scales. In order to ensure DEMO high response rate,
despite the length and complexity of the questionnaire, preliminary phone calls were
made to the owner/manager of each venture. Since the questionnaire included variables
on business performance, the respondents were assured of full conﬁdentiality. The indi-
ces generated were reviewed for internal consistency (Cronbach’s a) as shown below.
The Research Variables
Performance Variables: Dependent DEMO
Revenues were measured as reported by the respondents for the years 1994–1995. Re-
ported Proﬁt for 1995 was measured on a 3-point ordinal scale DEMO 1 5 a proﬁt; 2 5 neither
86 M. LERNER AND S. HABER
a loss nor a proﬁt; 3 5 a loss. Income of the entrepreneur was measured on a Likert
DEMO, ranging from 1 5 much below the average income in the DEMO market, to 5 5
much above the average income in the DEMO market.
Independent Variables
1. Human capital variables. Demographic variables. Education was measured
on a 8-point ordinal scale, from 1 5 elementary education, to DEMO 5 academic education,
Master’s degree or higher.
Entrepreneurial family background was measured by a dichotomous question: 1 5
neither of the parents was or had been in business, that is, was not self-employed and/DEMO
or a business owner. 2 5 at least one of the parents was or had been in business (see
also Cooper, Gimano-Gascon, and Woo 1994).
Previous experience, consisting of previous entrepreneurial experience and previ-
ous experience in tourism (as an employee), was examined by dichotomous questions
(Hisrich and Brush 1984): 1 5 yes, 2 5 DEMO
Personality features. Achievement orientation was measured by three items
(Steers and DEMO 1976); internal consistency showed a5 0.72. Locus of control
was measured by 2 items (r 5 0.27), one external and the second internal (Rotter 1966,
1975). Autonomy and the desire for independence were measured by three items (Steers
and Braunstein 1976); a reliability test showed an internal consistency of a5 0.58. All
the answers were DEMO on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 5 never, to 5 5 always. In
two of the achievement measures the scale ranged from DEMO 5 not important at all, to 5
5 very important (Hisrich and Brush 1984). All the above measures had been previously
translated DEMO used on an Israeli sample of entrepreneurs (Erez and Edelding 1991)DEMO
Business skills index: An index was constructed on the basis of DEMO questions, includ-
ing acquiring ﬁnancing, managing personnel, product innovation, ongoing business op-
eration, strategic management, marketing and selling (Hisrich and Brush 1984), with
answers on a Likert scale, ranging from 1—poor, DEMO 5—excellent. A reliability coefﬁcient
showed an internal consistency of a5 0.70.
2. Venture variables. Age of the venture and number of employees were mea-
DEMO by open questions. Number of tourism services: bundles of tourism venture DEMO
vices were examined according to categories of tourism services and their combinations
(e.g., accommodation and catering).
3. The attractiveness of the tourism DEMO location. was examined by a series
of 13 questions indicating various environmental factors (Hotel Review 1993). Each of
the 13 items was scored by the 53 respondents and 12 professional raters, that is, 65
DEMO rated them on a scale ranging from 1 5 not a strong feature of the venture,
to 5 5 a very strong feature DEMO the venture. The professional raters were selected on
the basis of their experience in the tourism industry in general and in the Negev in DEMO
ular, from ﬁelds such as economics, marketing, physical planning, tourism consultancy,
etc. Each of the 13 attractiveness characteristics received a score DEMO of the sum
of the 65 raters’ scores. An index of the attractiveness of a tourism venture location
was constructed on the basis of DEMO responses of the subjects (a5 0.88). A rotated factor

4. Support characteristics. In classifying ventures as assisted and non-assisted, we
made two separate sample splits, according to two types of support:
Financial support: The DEMO assisted group consisted of those ventures that had used
institutional and other external sources of ﬁnance (e.g., banks, the Ministry of Tourism,
the Jewish Agency, local authorities, etc.). Analysis of the responses DEMO carried out
on a dichotomous basis for each source individually. The non-assisted group consisted
of those ventures that did not use external ﬁnancial resources DEMO all.
Advisory support: The assisted group consisted of those ventures that DEMO used one or more
of the advisory services of the incubator, DEMO as preparation of business plans, and/
or marketing plans, and support in operating the venture. Respondents were required
to give a yes/DEMO answer to each type of assistance. The non-assisted were those ventures
that had not used these advisory services at all.
The Research Population
The DEMO population consisted of small privately-owned businesses in the tourism
industry, located DEMO the south of Israel. Ventures in the Eilat area, such as DEMO and camel
88
M. LERNER AND S. HABER
tours for experienced hikers, were included. Large hotels in Eilat and the Dead Sea
area were excluded because DEMO do not ﬁt the research deﬁnition of small businesses.
Characteristics of the Tourism Ventures
More than three-quarters of the ventures had up to eight DEMO; 26.4% employed
only one other person; and 11% were one-person businesses. About 40% of the ventures
examined were active recreation businesses, offering desert tours, for example; 19%
involved auxiliary tourism services and restaurants catering DEMO tourists; 21% were tourist
spots and 21% provided tourist accommodation. A DEMO many of the ventures provided
a range of services: 51% provided DEMO to three types of services, 28% four to ﬁve types
of DEMO and activities, and the remainder (21%) offered six or more DEMO of services
to the tourist. The most prevalent combinations of services were tours with meals,
guides, and sometimes overnight accommodation at a Bedouin-style encampment. The
tourism ventures studied had been operating for 8 years or DEMO: 60% had been operating
5 years or less; 21% had been established 6 to 7 years previously, and 19% had been
operating for 8 years. Of the ventures studied, 72% obtained ﬁnancial support (the DEMO
nancially assisted group) and 28% were non-assisted ﬁnancially (n 5 38, n 5 15 ventures,
respectively). With regard to advisory assistance from the governmental incubator, 38%
of the ventures got some support, DEMO 62% obtained none at all (n 5 20, n 5 33 ven-
tures, respectively).
Business Performance of the Tourism Ventures
In 1995 27% of the ventures had revenues of more than one million NIS ($1 5 3.2 New
Israeli Shekels) and another 15% sold tourism services valued at half a million to one
million shekels. The remaining 60% DEMO so had lower revenues: up to 220,000 shekels
were reported DEMO 46% of these ventures in 1994 and 31% in 1995, while DEMO 1995, 28%
reported revenues in the range of 220,000 to DEMO,000 shekels. The rate of growth in reve-
nues from 1994 to 1995 was 57%, on average. Thirty-four percent of the ventures showed
a 50% growth in sales from 1994 to 1995; 25% showed more than 50% growth of sales;
32% showed a loss in sales, and 9% were stable in those years. Most of the ventures
studied (56.6%) reported an operating proﬁt for the year 1995; 22.6% reported a DEMO
ance between proﬁt and loss; 20.8% reported an operating loss.
Characteristics DEMO the Entrepreneurs: Socioeconomic Variables
Eighty-seven percent of the respondents were males DEMO 13% females. The average
age was 41: 51% were 31–40 years DEMO, 25% were 41–50 years old, 17% were 51–62
years old, DEMO only 7% were under the age of 30. One-third of the respondents had
parents who had run independent businesses. The educational level of the DEMO
was high in comparison with the general population in Israel: 62% DEMO academic educa-
tion and the remaining 38% had secondary education.
Background and Previous Experience
For almost half of the respondents, the venture was their ﬁrst entrepreneurial experi-
ence. Of the remainder, 28% had one past entrepreneurial experience, and 25% had

two or more. Half of those with previous entrepreneurial experience had acquired DEMO in
the tourism industry: some had managed a hotel or restaurant (13%), travel and tourism
companies, or ﬁeld schools; 20% had DEMO businesses in the area of auxiliary tourism
services.
Examination of the Hypotheses
The research hypotheses were ﬁrst tested by means of Pearson correlation coefﬁcients
DEMO each of the variables appearing in the research model and each of the perfor-
mance variables separately. Then, multivariate examinations were performed by means
of stepwise regression analyses to assess the contribution of each of the DEMO
variables to explaining the variance of each of the performance variables.
Attractiveness of the Location of the Tourism Venture
The ﬁrst hypothesis posited that DEMO attractiveness of the location of the tourism venture
is positively related to the venture’s performance. The factor analysis elicited three rele-
vant attractiveness factors DEMO the venture location: tourist-related infrastructure, options
for excursions and scenery. Table 2 shows the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients among
these three factors and the DEMO measures.
As expected, the three factors of attractiveness, particularly the tourist-related in-
frastructure and excursions, are associated with the venture performance measures. Al-

though the attractiveness index is signiﬁcantly correlated to all three performance mea-
sures, the tourist-related infrastructure is correlated with revenues (r 5 0.29) and income
(r 5 0.33). The factor excursions is correlated to revenues (r 5 0.32) and to proﬁtability
(r 5 0.30). The third DEMO, scenery, is correlated with proﬁtability (r 5 0.29), but DEMO
with the other performance measures.
In spite of the signiﬁcantly positive correlations found by the bi-variate analysis,
the multi-variate analyses (Table 3) DEMO a minor impact of location attractiveness
on the performance measures relative to the other variables.
The stepwise regression analysis of the revenues revealed the DEMO contribu-
tion of the attractiveness index to the explained variance. However, DEMO neither the
proﬁtability, nor the income regression analyses was the attractiveness DEMO the venture
location index found to make a signiﬁcant contribution to the explained variance beyond
that of the personal variables, mainly the managerial skills. Moreover, it is worth noting
that another regression analysis in which the three attractiveness factors were examined
separately strengthened this ﬁnding; none of the three attractiveness factors contributed
signiﬁcantly to the explained variance. Thus, it might be that the human capital charac-
teristics overshadowed the environmental variables as DEMO factors.
Institutional Support
The second hypothesis posited that tourism ventures ﬁnancially supported by govern-
ment and other external ﬁnancing sources will display better business DEMO than

those not supported by external sources; by contrast, however, tourism ventures that
are not supported by the advisory services of the tourism incubator are expected to
perform better than those which are supported.
DEMO t-test analysis (Table 4) compared the means and standard deviations of the per-
formance of ventures that had obtained external ﬁnancial support with DEMO that had
not, and also compared the performance of ventures assisted DEMO the advisory services
of the tourism incubator with that of the non-assisted ventures.
In partial accordance with hypothesis 2a, the statistical results indeed reveal that
those tourism ventures that are ﬁnancially supported by external sources, governmental
or otherwise, show signiﬁcantly higher revenues than ventures that are not ﬁnancially
supported. However, receiving external ﬁnancial assistance is not signiﬁcantly corre-
lated with either proﬁtability or income (see Table 2), suggesting that revenue growth
does not necessarily assure higher proﬁtability or income. Hypothesis 2b, regarding the

advisory support, is also conﬁrmed: DEMO is precisely the non-assisted ventures that achieve
the better performance scores. These results are signiﬁcant for all the three performance
measures. Furthermore, there is a negative relationship between receipt of advisory sup-
port and venture proﬁtability (Table 2). A possible explanation for the inferior perfor-
mance of DEMO advisory-assisted ventures is that they are often younger and smaller than
the non-assisted ventures. To examine this possibility we conducted a two-way analysis
of DEMO, comparing the performance of the assisted and non-assisted ventures, split
by age and size. Although the number of ventures in each of the DEMO in the two-
way analysis of variance was small, the results DEMO that the revenues of the advisory-
assisted ventures were lower than those of the non-assisted, regardless of their size or
age. By contrast, DEMO two-way analysis of variance also revealed that the differences
between the ﬁnancially assisted and non-assisted ventures remained, regardless of their
size and age.
The regression analyses (Table 3) show the minor impact of the advisory-assistance
DEMO on performance relative to that of the entrepreneur’s characteristics. In two
of the regression analyses, the advisory-assistance variables followed the personal vari-
ables, DEMO only a minor contribution to the explained variance in performance. In
the third regression, that of the revenues, they followed both the personal DEMO as
well as the attractiveness variables. These results emphasize the centrality of the entre-
preneurs in the performance of the tourism ventures.
The Entrepreneur’s DEMO Capital
Hypothesis 3a posited that the entrepreneur’s personality characteristics will be posi-
tively related to the tourism venture’s performance. Hypothesis 3b posited that an DEMO
preneurial family background, education, previous experience in the tourism industry,
previous entrepreneurial experience, and managerial skills are positively related to the
tourism venture’s performance.
All the regression analyses (Table 3) as well as DEMO Pearson correlations (Table 2)
point to the central role of DEMO entrepreneur’s attributes in venture performance, thus
supporting the above hypotheses. Both DEMO proﬁtability and the income regression anal-
yses show the great importance of the managerial skills index. Surprisingly, the contribu-
tion of education is negatively associated with proﬁtability (b520.21; r 520.33) (to-
gether with managerial DEMO and advisory assistance explaining 18% of the variance
of proﬁtability). The variance of income is also mainly explained by the entrepreneurial
family background (socialization within a business family), following managerial skills
index (together with advisory assistance they explain 22% of the variance of income).
As DEMO in Table 2, the ﬁndings concerning managerial skills provide the strongest
DEMO most systematic relationship among the entrepreneur’s attributes and performance
measures: revenues (r 5 0.31), proﬁtability ( r 5 0.33), and income (r 5 0.38). These
ﬁndings indicate that the basic skills included DEMO the index, such as ﬁnancing skills, mar-
keting ability, innovativeness, strategic planning ability, etc. are critical to the ven-
ture’s performance.
In the regression analysis of the revenues internal locus of control (LOC) DEMO
as the ﬁrst signiﬁcant variable. The important feature contributing to performance is the
internal LOC and not the external one (this is indicated due to the negative correlation
between external LOC and performance shown in Table DEMO). The results in Table 2 indi-
PERFORMANCE FACTORS OF SMALL TOURISM VENTURES
93
cate that need for achievement DEMO correlated signiﬁcantly with income (r 5 0.30) and
autonomy with proﬁtability (r 5 0.32).
Even though the role of experience and know-how is central to successful venture
creation (Timmons 1985; Cooper and Gimeno DEMO 1992; Chandler and Hanks 1992),
surprisingly, in this research DEMO previous entrepreneurial experience and previ-
ous employment in tourism were not signiﬁcantly related to performance. Income was
the only performance measure found to be DEMO to entrepreneurial family back-
ground. Neither revenue nor proﬁtability were related.
The Venture’s Bundles of Services
The fourth hypothesis posited that tourism ventures which DEMO more services perform
better than those which concentrate on fewer tourism services. Table 2 shows that al-
though those ventures that offer more services DEMO potential tourists show better revenues
than those offering less services (r DEMO 0.32), no signiﬁcant differences appear in proﬁt-
ability and income. Nor do the multivariate analyses (Table 3) support this hypothesis:
the DEMO of services variable had a relatively very minor impact on the revenue re-
gression, and no impact at all on the proﬁtability or the income regressions. This ﬁnding
may be explained by differences in the ﬁnancial DEMO: offering more and diverse
services to customers indeed brought greater revenues, but was not reﬂected in higher
proﬁtability or in higher incomes, because these variables are inﬂuenced by many other
factors, such as managerial skills.
The discussion below will expand on the general ﬁndings regarding the above
DEMO and their interpretation.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Drawing on research in other industries on performance factors of entrepreneurial ven-
tures and their attribution to personal, organizational, and environmental factors (for
example, Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992; DEMO, Brush, and Hisrich 1997; Lumpkin
and Dess 1996), an DEMO model combining variables from four theoretical ap-
proaches was suggested to explain the performance of tourism ventures.
Overall the examination shows that the main DEMO associated with all three per-
formance measures are the entrepreneurial human capital attributes, mainly manage-
ment skills. This ﬁnding is consistent with previous research on other industries, demon-
strating the focal importance of the entrepreneur’s managerial skills, especially
concerning the success of small ventures (Hornaday and Wheatley DEMO; Bird 1989,
1995; Hood and Young 1993). Beyond the managerial skills, it was also found that the
entrepreneur’s personal characteristics, DEMO internal locus of control but also
achievement orientation and autonomy, correlate DEMO performance. Although previ-
ous studies have shown mixed or non-signiﬁcant results regarding the impact of locus
of control on performance (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992; Begley and Boyd 1985;
Begley 1986; Duchesneau and Gartner 1988; Brockhaus and Horwitz 1986), our ﬁndings
tend to support a positive DEMO of this personal characteristic with performance.
The ﬁndings which found need for achievement to be related to higher performance
broadly corroborate those of many DEMO studies (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1994;
Duchesneau and Gartner 1988; Bird 1989, etc.). This corroborates previous ﬁndings that
94

personality features exert a dominant inﬂuence DEMO the subsequent success of the entre-
preneur’s venture (e.g., Miner 1996).
Contrary to expectations and the rich research evidence (for example, DEMO
and Sexton 1994; Bowen and Hisrich 1986), neither previous employment DEMO industry,
nor former entrepreneurial experience were correlated with performance. Moreover,
higher education was even negatively correlated with proﬁtability, contrary to previous
studies which found signiﬁcantly positive relationships between education and perfor-
mance (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1994; Bird 1989; 1993), especially in high-tech in-
dustries. DEMO might suggest that in the tourism industry, neither previous knowledge
nor DEMO education per se assure success. However, the acquisition of business skills,DEMO
even while running the business, is a requisite for proﬁtability. This DEMO suggest that
in tourism the entry barriers are not as high as in other industries which require industry-
speciﬁc previous experience and a high DEMO of education. Our ﬁndings show that entre-
preneurial family background contributed signiﬁcantly to the income variance but not
to revenues or proﬁtability. This contrasts DEMO previous ﬁndings on emerging industries,
that scions of entrepreneurial families produced higher sales revenues (Duchesneau and
Gartner 1988; Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1994, p. 305).
The conduciveness of certain environments to entrepreneurship hinges on DEMO so-
cioeconomic infrastructure as well as on the availability of resources (DEMO 1982).
Our ﬁndings indicate the multidimensional nature of the attractiveness of the envi-
ronmental milieu of tourism ventures, including tourist-related infrastructure, options
DEMO excursions, and scenery, including climate. However, although an attractive environ-
DEMO is a vital component of the product produced by the tourist industry (Al-Wahab
and Al-Din 1975; Fridgen 1984; Hall 1996; Ley and DEMO 1996; Wall 1996; Smith
1989), our ﬁndings show that one cannot rely only on environmental attractiveness as
the sole guarantee of ﬁnancial DEMO success.
Most of the literature on tourist attractions is descriptive, case-speciﬁc, and not
explanatory in either the general or speciﬁc sense (Stear 1981, p. 91). Moreover, as Lew
(1987) has observed, “although the importance of tourist attractions in the study of tour-
ism is DEMO, tourist researchers have yet to fully come to terms with the DEMO
of attractions as phenomena both in the environment and the mind” (DEMO 554). The opera-
tionalization of measures of attractiveness in the tourism location may add to a deeper
understanding of the interface of environment DEMO entrepreneurship in tourism.
The results also reveal that the number of services offered by tourism ventures did
not contribute signiﬁcantly to the performance measure DEMO, apart from a minor
contribution in the revenues regression. This may DEMO that providing a bundle of
services for the tourist customer does not necessarily guarantee proﬁtability. Thus, in
the relatively young and small- sized tourism ventures studied here it may be assumed
that due to early-on costs (lower proﬁts) providing a bundle of services often affected
proﬁtability negatively, DEMO was done in anticipation of achieving greater stability in
the form of repeat customers in the future.
It is worth noting the similarity in DEMO differential association between the number
of services offered and the performance measures on the one hand, and the attrac-
tiveness features with performance on the other. In both cases, these factors positively
contributed to the revenues regression, but neither contributed to that of proﬁtability
or income. This means that an attractive environment does contribute to higher reve-
nues, in that more tourists choose to visit the tourist attractions; however, it does DEMO
assure proﬁtability. Similarly, providing many services to the visitors may also DEMO
PERFORMANCE FACTORS OF SMALL TOURISM VENTURES
95
ute to higher revenues, but does not necessarily assure proﬁtable business outcomes.
The current ﬁndings indicate that DEMO proﬁtability is contingent on human capital,
especially the skills of the entrepreneurs. Income is also a consequence of decisions
which are contingent upon DEMO entrepreneur, and does not necessarily coincide with
proﬁtability.
Furthermore, the results indicate the dual nature of the impact of institutional sup-
port upon DEMO tourism venture’s performance, conﬁrming the hypotheses regarding the
impact of two DEMO of support: 1) the use of external ﬁnancial sources, and DEMO) the use
of advisory services through governmental incubator programs. As expected, those
tourism ventures that are ﬁnancially supported by external sources perform better DEMO
those ventures that are not ﬁnancially supported by external sources. On the other hand,
in the case of advisory support from a governmental DEMO incubator, it is precisely
the non-assisted ventures that achieve better performance. DEMO may be explained by
the differing criteria for receiving the two types of support (see also Sarder, Ghosh,
and Rosa 1997). DEMO the ventures applying for assistance by the incubator are
often younger and smaller than the non-assisted ventures, there is no contradiction of
the previous ﬁndings. Regardless of the size and age of the ventures, those obtaining
the advisory type of assistance were still lower performing, while those obtaining the
ﬁnancial type of assistance were the higher performing.
To conclude, the ﬁndings lend support to a portion of the research hypotheses,
as DEMO
Each of the four groups of factors—attractiveness of the tourism venture’s location,
the external ﬁnancial assistance and advisory support of a government incubator, the
entrepreneur’s characteristics, and the number of services offered by the venture—is
correlated differentially to the business performance measures. These results conﬁrm
the multidimensionality DEMO business performance (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992;
Birley and Westhead 1990) and reinforce the claim that different measures of perfor-
mance are associated DEMO different combinations of factors.
Limitations
One of the limitations of this study is that it is industry speciﬁc and this may limit its
generalizeability. DEMO, due to the fact that tourism is an industry that includes DEMO
broad range of service activities, such as accommodation, transportation, shopping DEMO
recreational activities (McIntosh, Goeldner and Ritchie 1995), the ﬁndings are applica-
ble to a broad class of industries. Moreover, one of the industry-speciﬁc components
of the examination, the environmental attractiveness, may be applied DEMO future studies
to other service industries as well. However, being industry DEMO may also be an ad-
vantage, in view of the absence DEMO such multidimensional examinations in the research
literature on the tourism industry, DEMO given the tremendous importance of
tourism worldwide.
Another limitation is associated with the central ﬁndings of this study regarding the
strong relationship between skills DEMO all the three measures of performance: revenues,
proﬁtability, and income. We acknowledge that self-report respondents are very likely
to think they have DEMO business skills. It should be recognized that these items do
not measure the speciﬁc skills and behaviors that directly inﬂuence the performance,
but DEMO the entrepreneurs’ perception of their abilities and skills. Thus, asking re-
DEMO to evaluate their skills and their venture’s performance on the same instru-
96
M. LERNER AND S. HABER
ment may inﬂate the correlation obtained DEMO them. This means that caution
should be exercised in generalizing conclusions.
However, two justiﬁcations for highlighting these results regarding the centrality of
entrepreneurial and managerial human capital for the venture performance in tourism
ventures may be DEMO The ﬁrst lies in the fact that a relationship between skills and
performance has already been found in a large number of empirical studies (e.g., Yam-
marino and Waldman 1993) and in the entrepreneurship literature DEMO other industries
(see Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon, and Woo 1994; Hood and Young 1993). The second justi-
ﬁcation is that the measure of DEMO is not based upon one item but rather on a multi-
variate item. As Spector (1987) noted, method variance might well be more of a problem
with single items or poorly designed scales, which is not the case here, since we adopted
measures of skills that have been tested previously (Hisrich and Brush 1984). Thus, all
the DEMO items measuring the entrepreneur’s skills included in the index (a5 0.70), had
different means (from the highest X 5 4.1 to the DEMO 3.0, on a scale ranging from
1 to 5). All DEMO points may lend reliability to the above ﬁnding.
Another limitation is related to the focus on one aspect of the venture’s features:
the DEMO of the services offered by the tourism venture. Though bundling of services
provided is a prominent and important feature of the tourism industry and DEMO,
there are many other important venture features which may inﬂuence performance that
are not dealt with in this paper.
Finally, the small size of the current sample, although representative in the Israeli
Negev context, DEMO for further analysis with bigger samples in order to overcome such
problems as conducting factor analysis with 13 items on a small sample, and strengthen
our ﬁndings. Moreover, due to the self-reported data, further research DEMO clearly re-
quired.
Future Research
Many researchers have suggested that future research should be inter-industry in focus,
asking whether certain factors apply to DEMO in some industries but not in
others (Bruno and Tyebjee 1982:DEMO; see also Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992). Fur-
ther research should DEMO the performance factors of tourism ventures with those
of ventures in other economic sectors, particularly service industries. Cross-cultural
comparisons are also recommended for developing generalizations about the factors
affecting performance of entrepreneurial tourism ventures in different DEMO and
in various tourism locations (urban, rural, desert, seashore, DEMO, etc.). Due to
the small size of this sample with DEMO 53 entrepreneurs, further studies are needed, in
order to further elaborate and reﬁne the results, and improve the usefulness of the in-
strument suggested here for measuring the impact of the environmental attractiveness
factors upon DEMO success.
Practical Implications
On the practical level, the importance of privately DEMO tourism businesses has be-
come an issue, impinging upon economic development DEMO the regional and national level.
In order to increase resident-responsive, community-based DEMO development (Ech-
tner 1995), there is a necessity to provide DEMO regional business and management
training tools for tourism entrepreneurs. In this context, Echtner (1995) indicates that
PERFORMANCE FACTORS OF SMALL TOURISM VENTURES
97
governments have not given appropriate DEMO to the importance of support to
small-scale locally owned tourism ventures, DEMO spite of their clear contribution to long-
range regional economic stability. The current research ﬁndings clearly highlight man-
agement skills as a prerequisite for DEMO running tourism ventures. Lack of mana-
gerial skills is one of the main barriers to a venture’s success in different industries, all
the more so in small businesses, where the owners have to be involved in all areas of
activity. In accordance with our ﬁndings that managerial skills DEMO so crucial for venture
success, the main objective of advisory incubators DEMO be to promote managerial
competencies.
