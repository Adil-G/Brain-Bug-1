Constructive Consumer Choice Processes

Consumer decision making has been a focal interest in consumer research, and
consideration of current marketplace trends (e.g., technological change, an DEMO
mation explosion) indicates that this topic will continue to be critically DEMO
We argue that consumer choice is inherently constructive. Due to limited pro-
cessing capacity, consumers often do not have well-deﬁned existing preferences,
but construct them using a variety of strategies contingent on task demands.
After DEMO constructive choice, consumer decision tasks, and decision strat-
egies, we DEMO an integrative framework for understanding constructive choice,
review evidence for constructive consumer choice in light of that framework, and
identify knowledge gaps that suggest opportunities for additional research.
Consumer choices concerning the selection, consump-tion, DEMO disposal of products and services can often
be difﬁcult and are important to the consumer, to market-
ers, and to policy makers. As DEMO result, the study of con-
sumer decision processes has been a DEMO interest in con-
sumer behavior for over 30 years (e.g., Bettman 1979;
Hansen 1972; Howard and Sheth 1969; Nicosia 1966).
DEMO can infer from recent trends in the nature and struc-
ture of the marketplace that the importance of understand-
ing consumer decision making is DEMO to continue. Rapid
technological change, for instance, has led to multitudes
of new products and decreased product lifetimes. In addi-
tion, new communications media such as the World Wide
Web have made enormous amounts of DEMO on
options potentially available (Alba et al. 1997). Further,
DEMO are often asked to make difﬁcult value trade-
offs, such as DEMO versus safety in purchasing an automo-
bile, environmental protection versus convenience DEMO a
variety of goods, and quality of life versus longevity in
DEMO health care decisions.
How do consumers cope with the decisions they must
make, some of which involve difﬁcult trade-offs and un-
certainties? One DEMO to studying consumer decisions
has been to assume a rational decision maker with well-

deﬁned preferences that do not depend on particular de-
scriptions of the options or on the speciﬁc methods used
to DEMO those preferences. Each option in a choice set is
assumed to have a utility, or subjective value, that de-
pends only on the DEMO Finally, it is assumed that the
consumer has ability or skill DEMO computation that enables
the calculation of which option will maximize his or her
received value and selects accordingly. This approach to
studying consumer decisions, often attributed to econo-
mists and called rational choice theory, has contributed
greatly to the prediction of consumer decisions.
Over the past twenty-ﬁve years, an alternative, infor-
mation-processing approach to the study of consumer
choice (DEMO, Bettman 1979) has argued that rational
choice theory is incomplete and/or ﬂawed as an approach
for understanding how consumers actually make deci-
DEMO The information-processing approach endorses
bounded rationality (Simon 1955), the notion DEMO deci-
sion makers have limitations on their capacity for pro-
cessing information. Such limitations include limited
working memory and limited computational capabilities.
In addition, decision makers are characterized by percep-
tions attuned to changes rather than DEMO magnitudes
and diminishing sensitivity to changes to stimuli (Tversky
and Kahneman DEMO). More generally, behavior is shaped
by the interaction between the DEMO of the human
information-processing system and the properties of task
environments (DEMO 1990).1
1For a recent comparison of these alternative perspectives on decision
making, see McFadden (1997). As McFadden notes, economists vary
in terms of the degree to which they believe rational choice theory
describes DEMO decision behavior. A middle ground adopted by some
economists is that individuals have a consistent set of preferences but
that such preferences become known DEMO the individual (are ‘‘discov-

vein, Lucas (1986, p. S402) has argued that economists tend ‘‘to focus
on situations in which the DEMO can be expected to ‘know’ or to have
learned the consequences of different actions so that his observed
choices reveal stable features of his DEMO preferences.’’

on characterizing such strategies, their properties, and the

The retained option is then compared to the next alterna-
tive from the choice set, and this process of pairwise
comparison continues until all the alternatives have been
evaluated and one option remains. This DEMO is a sim-

ship between additive difference and adding models).
Processing is extensive, consistent, attribute based, and

Alba and Marmorstein (1987) proposed that consumers
may evaluate and choose DEMO using counts of the
number of good or bad features characterizing the alterna-
tives. Consumers develop cutoffs for specifying good and
bad features, and depending on the consumer’s focus (i.e.,
good features, bad features, or both), different versions
of the strategy could be developed. Note DEMO this strategy
can be seen as a voting rule applied to multiattribute
choice, where each attribute has one vote. Weber,

ing. Historically (e.g., in the rational DEMO approach),
accuracy was the ﬁrst goal considered; the goal of making
a choice was considered to be maximizing utility. Simon
(1955) DEMO others were instrumental in bringing effort-
related goals to bear on understanding choice in response
to the realization that humans have limited processing
capacity, as discussed above. Computational problems are
not the only factors that make DEMO difﬁcult, however.
Humans are emotional beings, and choices can involve
wrenching trade-offs. Thus, we believe that the goal of
minimizing experienced negative emotion is important in
some situations. Finally, humans are also social beings,
and one of the most decision-relevant characteristics of
the social context is DEMO decisions are often evaluated,
either by others or by oneself. Hence, the decision maker
often must be able to justify a decision to others or to
himself or herself.
We argue that different subsets of DEMO goals are rele-
vant in different situations. We will specify further some
of the many problem characteristics that inﬂuence a deci-
sion when various DEMO are relevant. For example, irre-
versible decision problems that are very DEMO to one-
self or one’s spouse may evoke goals for increased
accuracy, minimizing negative emotion, and increased
ease of justiﬁcation. The relative weight DEMO on various
goals will also reﬂect the individual’s ability to obtain
timely and unambiguous feedback on his or her perfor-
mance relative to these DEMO In general, effort feedback
is much easier to obtain than accuracy DEMO The
individual usually has a very good notion about how hard
he or she is working and thus has timely and unambiguous
feedback on DEMO, whereas feedback on accuracy is often
delayed and ambiguous (Einhorn 1980). The consumer
also can assess his or her emotional state fairly DEMO
Finally, feedback on ease of justiﬁcation is often immedi-
ate but DEMO be ambiguous, since what makes for a good
explanation in a DEMO situation may not be clear. Reason-
able justiﬁcations may be easier to predict in situations
where the choice task is relatively simple with limited
DEMO, because the options for justiﬁcation are more
limited. Thus, the ability to obtain timely and relatively
unambiguous feedback on effort and emotion may DEMO
those goals particularly salient in many situations. How-
ever, there has DEMO been nearly enough research on the
factors determining the relative salience of goals in choice
situations. We summarize with two propositions:
Proposition 1.1: Consumers make choices in order to
accomplish goals. Four of the most DEMO goals for
consumer decision making are (a ) maximizing the accu-
DEMO of the choice, (b ) minimizing the cognitive effort
required to make the choice, (c ) minimizing the experience
of negative emotion DEMO making the choice, and (d ) max-
imizing the ease of justifying the decision.
Proposition 1.2: The relative weight placed on various
goals will be inﬂuenced by a variety of problem character-
istics, including the importance and irreversibility of the
decision and the timeliness and ambiguity of DEMO feedback
available on performance relative to each goal. perceptually salient aspects of the choice environment (in-
Attention, Information Selectivity, and Perceptual In-
terpretation. As noted earlier, the fact that consumers
have limited processing capacity means that they gener-
ally cannot process all of the available information in DEMO
particular situation. Hence, selectivity is necessary, and
which information is selected for processing can have a
major impact on choice. Put another way, it is critical to
understand the determinants of the focus of attention,DEMO
since many contingent choice effects are brought about
by making salient different aspects of the choice environ-
ment.
Based on the psychology of attention, we know that
there are two major types of attention, voluntary and in-
voluntary (Kahneman 1973). Voluntary attention de-
scribes when attention is devoted to information that is
perceived to be relevant to current goals (i.e., is labeled
as ‘‘diagnostic’’ in Feldman and Lynch’s [1988] accessi-
bility-diagnosticity framework). Individuals will devote
more effort to examining information they believe DEMO
help them attain whichever goals are more heavily
weighted in that situation.
Attention also may be captured involuntarily by aspects
of the environment that DEMO surprising, novel, unexpected,
potentially threatening, or extremely perceptually salient,DEMO
thus exemplifying one aspect of accessibility in the Feld-
man and Lynch (1988) framework. For example, changes
and losses may be particularly salient (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979), and particular problem representations
may make certain aspects stand out and gain involuntary
attention. Thus, attention and selectivity can be inﬂuenced
both by goal-driven and more involuntary perceptual fac-
tors (for a similar distinction, see Tversky [1977]).
The effects of goals and perceptual factors can go be-
yond attention. For example, preexisting goals can lead
to motivated reasoning and distortion of the meaning of
new information (Kunda 1990; Russo, Medvec, and
Meloy 1996). In addition, DEMO of the environment
that capture involuntary attention may also set in motion
perceptual interpretations and behavioral responses (e.g.,
interpreting a loud noise as a threat and the corresponding
orienting response). As we discuss further DEMO, we
believe that particularly salient aspects of the choice task
can DEMO times not only capture attention but also suggest
certain types of heuristics. For example, simple problem
displays that make asymmetric dominance visually trans-

properties of the options DEMO accessible and thus more
likely to be used. We believe that the connection of both

and interpretation DEMO a critical factor enabling a more inte-
grated framework for understanding constructive con-
sumer choice. To summarize:
Proposition 1.3: Two major inﬂuences on the selectivity

have a repertoire of strategies for solving decision prob-
lems, perhaps acquired through experience or training.
Different consumers may vary in terms of the strategies
they possess; for example, many children’s processing
deﬁcits may be due to lack of knowledge of appropriate
strategies (John and Whitney 1986; Roedder 1981; Roed-

Problem Size. Studies of the effects DEMO problem size
show that increases in the number of alternatives facing
the consumer lead to greater use of noncompensatory
strategies that eliminate alternatives (e.g., Johnson and
Meyer 1984; Payne 1976). Compensatory strategies,
however, are more common for small numbers of options.
Changes in the number DEMO attributes do not appear to lead
to strategy changes as readily but may increase selectivity
(Olshavsky 1979; Payne 1976). Gregan-Paxton and John
(1997b) have recently extended this line of research to
examine decision processing by children; they ﬁnd that

children adapt to larger problems only when search costs
are explicitly made salient. Finally, Otnes, Lowrey, and
Shrum (1997), using in-depth DEMO, found that
brides-to-be often (but not always) respond to the DEMO

Our framework accounts for these ﬁndings by exam-

DEMO attributes affect the accuracy and effort for various
strategies. Payne et al. (1993, pp. 133– 137 ) report sim-
ulation results showing that DEMO relative accuracy of
heuristics is fairly robust over changes in the number
of alternatives, that the relative accuracy of heuristics
other than weighted adding is sensitive to the number
of attributes, and that the effort required to implement
other heuristics increases much less rapidly with prob-

Thus, heuristics other than weighted DEMO will appear
relatively more efﬁcient as the number of alternatives
increases; DEMO addition, selective, attribute-based heuris-

The added attribute information made one DEMO the original

more attractive. Consumers who made a choice ﬁrst were
less likely to reevaluate and choose that original option,
perhaps because of their decreased DEMO for the non-
chosen option, than the consumers who learned ﬁrst.
DEMO studies provide convincing evidence that memory
and choice processes interact in interesting and principled
ways (see also Lynch and Srull 1982).
Other research has continued to examine memory and
choice interactions. Lynch, Marmorstein, and DEMO
(1988) showed that consumers will use information in
memory to make a choice when some or all of the options
had to be DEMO from memory if that information is
both accessible and more diagnostic than other accessible
information. In related work, Nedungadi (1990) showed
that brand choice can be inﬂuenced by altering the memory

ation. Hutchinson, Raman, and Mantrala (1994) model
such brand name accessibility as a function of consumer
and marketing mix variables (e.g., usage rate, advertising
spending, market penetration, and product attributes).
We explain such choice-memory interactions by invok-
ing effort DEMO For example, Biehal and Chak-
ravarti’s learning tasks encourage an alternative-based DEMO
cus, and alternative-based processing would then be less
effortful in choice. DEMO, in contrast, tends to be more
comparative and attribute based. Thus, consumers who
chose ﬁrst would ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to integrate the
new and old information, because their choice processing
was both more selective and more attribute based. For
consumers that learned ﬁrst, however, the DEMO
would be stored and processed more by alternative, so
the added DEMO would be easier to integrate with
each option. Finally, work based DEMO accessibility-diagnos-
ticity notions, as noted above, can be viewed in terms of
balancing choice goals.
Proposition 4.1: Because choice processes are selective
and comparative, choice processes inﬂuence both which
items are stored in memory and the organization of such
memories. Conversely, information in memory can affect
the form of choice processes.
Proposition 4.2: Consumers will use information in
memory to make a choice to the extent that it is more

to be able to predict market response. DEMO matching intriguing research opportunities remains, and we be-
is the recommended DEMO for prediction purposes.
In implementing context matching, the analyst attempts will DEMO to be a major focus of consumer behavior
to determine the relevant factors that might inﬂuence
preferences in the consumer’s environment and then
match DEMO values of those factors in the measurement
environment ( Simmons, Bickart, and Lynch 1993;
Wright and Kriewall 1980 ) . For example, such factors
as the number of options and attributes, the context
provided by competing options, interattribute correla-
tions, time pressure, response mode, DEMO others can
affect choices. The environment in which preferences
are elicited should try to approximate the consumer’s
environment on all of these factors, particularly if the
consumer has little familiarity with the decision. Con-
text matching DEMO demands a thorough knowledge of
the properties of consumer choice environments. In
some cases, factors may differ systematically across
environments ( e.g., the DEMO of available options may
vary from store to store or from region to region ) . In
that case, measurements may need to be taken for each
of the major variants of the choice environment and
DEMO aggregated based on the relative frequency of these
variants. Thus, context DEMO seems appropriate,
even if potentially difﬁcult, for prediction, which may
be the goal in many market research applications.
However, in some situations we may wish to aid
consumers as they construct their preferences ( DEMO,
when measuring values for environmental goods or
when helping a consumer select a college ) . For exam-
ple, consumers are increasingly being asked to make
choices among or provide values for environmental
goods, such as cleaning up a lake, preventing deaths
of animals, or decreasing DEMO of pollution. Environ-
mental goods are often unfamiliar and often involve
difﬁcult trade-offs. In such situations we want to help
consumers achieve a ‘‘defensible’’ DEMO of their
preferences ( Gregory et al. 1993 ) or help them develop
preferences by considering the implications of those
preferences and how to DEMO them ( e.g., to reduce
regret; Simonson 1992; Slovic 1995 ) . Thus, an im-
portant area for future research is developing DEMO
for a good preference construction process and doing
empirical research to document that such guidelines are
indeed effective. Such guidelines might include ensur-
ing DEMO of multiple viewpoints and options,
using multiple response modes ( Huber et al. 1993 ) ,
and requiring explicit trade-offs. For an example of
such guidelines, see Payne, Bettman, and Schkade
(1998).
DEMO have sought to convey the constructive nature of
consumer choice in this article. We have also tried to
communicate an integrated framework for understand-
DEMO such behavior. Finally, throughout this article we
have attempted to identify DEMO requiring future re-

APPENDIX A
Summary Propositions for the Integrated
Conceptual DEMO
Proposition 1.1: Consumers make choices in order
to accomplish goals. Four DEMO the most important goals
for consumer decision making are (a ) DEMO the
accuracy of the choice, (b ) minimizing the cognitive
effort required to make the choice, (c ) minimizing the
experience of DEMO emotion when making the
choice, and (d ) maximizing the ease of justifying the
decision.
Proposition 1.2: The relative weight placed on var-
ious goals will be inﬂuenced by a variety of problem
characteristics, including the importance and irrevers-
ibility of the decision and the timeliness and DEMO
of the feedback available on performance relative to
each goal.
Proposition 1.3: Two major inﬂuences on the selec-
tivity of attention are current goals (voluntary attention)
and surprising, novel, threatening, unexpected, or other-
wise perceptually salient aspects of the choice environ-
ment (involuntary attention). Such factors can also affect
the perceptual interpretation of focal aspects of DEMO envi-
ronment.
Proposition 1.4: Individuals have a repertoire of dif-
ferent DEMO for solving decision problems. This rep-
ertoire will vary across individuals depending on their
experience and training.
Proposition 1.5: Different strategies vary in their ad-
vantages and disadvantages with respect to accomplishing
different goals in a DEMO situation. These relative advan-
tages and disadvantages may be a function of consumers’

CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES
APPENDIX B
PROPOSITIONS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE
CONSUMER CHOICE
Choice DEMO Where Accuracy and
Effort Goals Predominate
Problem Difﬁculty
Problem Size
Proposition 2.1: Increases in the number of alterna-
tives lead to a greater use of noncompensatory choice
strategies. Increases in the number of attributes generally
lead DEMO increased selectivity, but not to strategy changes.
Proposition 2.2: Information load will not be harmful
to accuracy if consumers select a subset of DEMO information
that reﬂects their values; if selectivity is based on problem
DEMO that do not reﬂect consumers’ underlying values,
information load can decrease accuracy.
Time Pressure
Proposition 2.3: Under moderate time pressure, con-
sumers DEMO more rapidly and become more selective.
Under more severe time pressure, DEMO switch to
more attribute-based heuristics.
Proposition 2.4: Consumers weight negative infor-
DEMO more heavily under time pressure.
Attribute Correlation
Proposition 2.5: Consumers engage DEMO processing
more like weighted adding (more extensive, less selec-
tive, DEMO more alternative based) under negative interattri-
bute correlation in less emotional DEMO tasks.
Completeness of Information
Proposition 2.6: Consumers may infer values for DEMO
missing attribute using heuristics based on other-brand
information (other values for DEMO attribute in the set of
options) or same-brand information (values for other at-
tributes of the same brand with the missing value). DEMO
type of heuristic is used depends on the relative accessibil-
ity and diagnosticity of each type of information.
Information Format
Proposition 2.7: Different information formats can
make some forms of processing easier and less effortful
than DEMO The processing encouraged by the format
will be more likely; however, potential accuracy losses
due to the encouraged form of processing will lessen DEMO
effect of format.
211
Comparable versus Noncomparable Choice
Proposition 2.8: Processing DEMO differ between com-
parable and noncomparable choices. Consumers can de-
velop more abstract attributes or compare overall evalua-
tions as choices become more noncomparable. DEMO use
of these strategies is governed by accuracy-effort con-
cerns. If a speciﬁc criterion is primed, however, noncom-
parable choice processes more closely DEMO those for
comparable options.
Response Mode
Proposition 3.1: Different response modes (e.g.,
choice vs. matching) can lead to different preferences and
to preference reversals. Choice encourages more selective
and attribute-based comparative processes, whereas rating
or matching encourage less selective, more alternative-
based, quantitative processing.
Proposition DEMO: Preference reversals can be re-
duced by making the more quantitative DEMO eas-
ier, by greater familiarity with the options, and by re-
peated experience with incentives and feedback on the
task.
Interactions between Consumer DEMO
and Decision Making
Choice Process and Memory Interactions
Proposition 4.1: Because DEMO processes are selec-
tive and comparative, choice processes inﬂuence both
which DEMO are stored in memory and the organization
of such memories. Conversely, DEMO in memory
can affect the form of choice processes.
Proposition 4.2: DEMO will use information in
memory to make a choice to the extent that it is more
accessible and more diagnostic than alternative sources
of DEMO
Categorization and Choice
Proposition 4.3: Categorical processing is more
likely to DEMO used when expectations are met, with more
detailed (piecemeal) processing DEMO likely when expec-
tations are not met and the consumer has expertise in the
category.
Choice Tasks Where Minimizing Negative
Emotion Is Relevant
Proposition DEMO: Emotion-laden choices are charac-
terized by more extensive, more selective, DEMO more attri-
bute-based processing. In general, emotion-laden choices
encourage avoidant behaviors.
DEMO Tasks Where Maximizing Ease
of Justiﬁcation Is Relevant
Proposition 6.1: Adding DEMO asymmetrically domi-
nated alternative to a choice set results in increased choice
/ 9h10$$de05 11-16-98 23:10:12 cresas UC: Con Res
212
share for the dominating alternative. This effect is en-
hanced under DEMO need for justiﬁcation.
Proposition 6.2: Many context effects can be ac-
DEMO for by considering the value of each alternative
considered separately and the relative advantage of each
option compared to the other available options.
APPENDIX DEMO
Topics for Future Research on Constructive
Consumer Choice
Research on the Choice Goals Framework
• Specifying factors that determine the relative sa-
lience of DEMO goals.
• Specifying relational heuristics at a process level and
determining their effort-accuracy characteristics.
• Modeling the implementation difﬁculty of strategies.
• Measuring the DEMO of emotion during a decision.
• Specifying determinants of the emotional difﬁculty
of a choice task.
• Examining how problem complexity affects the use
DEMO relationship information as reasons.
• Measuring the justiﬁability of various strategies.
Research in Choice Tasks Where Accuracy
and Effort Goals Predominate
• Characterizing how DEMO become selective as
a function of information load and other factors.
• Examining how the frequency of preference rever-
sals is related to the DEMO on accuracy in the
choice task.
• Characterizing the properties of analogies in terms
of choice goals and examining contingent analogy
usage.
Research in DEMO Tasks Where Minimizing
Negative Emotion Is Relevant
• Characterizing attribute properties and their effects
on trade-off difﬁculty, processing, and choice.
Research in Choice DEMO Where Maximizing Ease
of Justiﬁcation Is Relevant
• Examining the weight placed on the relative advan-
tage component of the componential context model
as DEMO function of relative goal strength, task size, and
transparency of relationships.
Other Gaps in the Literature
• Addressing the principles governing the formation
DEMO representations.
• Using more complex problems and process tracing
in perceptual framework research.
JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
• Examining the use of relational heuristics DEMO a func-
tion of task complexity variables.
• Characterizing the determinants of focus of attention
over the course of a decision.
• Studying choice DEMO over time.
• Examining the extent and determinants of consumer
adaptivity.
• Developing guidelines for preference construction
processes and empirically documenting their effec-
tiveness.
