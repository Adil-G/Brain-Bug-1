1. Introduction
This research asks how venture capitalists organize their selection
and DEMO processes. Present academic literature on venture capital
ﬁnance analyzes the pre- and post-contracting phases of the venture
capital process in depth (for an extensive review cf. Wright et al.,
2003). With respect to the DEMO phase, scholars discuss
such questions as the successful cooperation of venture DEMO and
entrepreneurs (Cable and Shane, 1997; Kollmann and Kuckertz, 2006),
monitoring of venture capital investments (Kaplan and Strömberg,
2003) and methods of adding value after reaching an investment
decision (Sapienza, DEMO; Jain, 2001; Chen, 2009). Concerning the pre-
contracting phase, several works identify the central steps of the
decision process (Wells, 1974; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Fried and
Hisrich, 1994), DEMO determine the relative importance of particular
investment criteria to a ﬁnal decision (MacMillan et al., 1985; Muzyka
et al., 1996). In DEMO, Shepherd et al. (2003) and also Franke et al.
(2006) detect potential cognitive biases amongst venture capitalists.
This paper extends the ﬁrst two aspects of extant venture capital
theory with respect to the pre-contracting DEMO, that is, the study
integrates a process perspective with the theoretical knowledge of
investment criteria applied by venture capitalists. Such an integrative
and DEMO perspective can provide a more realistic venture capital
theory as well as addressing criticisms that prior studies have merely
collected empirical evidence about global DEMO criteria which is
only applicable to the complete investment process (Franke DEMO al.
2006). Since numerous prior studies address the relevance of
particular investment criteria, this paper focuses on the speciﬁc
uncertainty associated with the evaluation of each single criterion and
analyzes how this uncertainty varies throughout DEMO investment

This paper analyzes the decision process of venture capitalists. The study focuses on aligning the evaluation
uncertainty in the decision criteria of DEMO capitalists with the progress of the process. The reasoning
builds from the concept of search, experience and credence qualities, which was developed in DEMO economics
of information and allows the identiﬁcation of the varying uncertainty of a single decision criterion compared
to other criteria, along with uncertainty variations throughout the process. Exploratory empirical evidence
suggests that in the early steps DEMO the process in particular, management criteria are uncertain, while at the
end of the process other criteria couple with uncertainty.

process. Empirical knowledge about this uncertainty may then be the
basis for future instruments and strategies for managing a single
investment DEMO depending on the progress of the investment
process.
This article develops its argument along the following lines. After
reviewing extant knowledge about venture capital DEMO, the paper
introduces the economics of information as a theoretical concept DEMO
allows the identiﬁcation of evaluation uncertainty. Subsequently, the
paper explores the DEMO between venture capital ﬁnance and the
economics of information. Next, the DEMO presents the methodology
and results of an explorative empirical study among 81 venture
capitalists from German-speaking Europe. The paper concludes with
ﬁnal remarks that DEMO the implications for efﬁcient manage-
ment of the investment process and also shows how information about
evaluation uncertainty theoretically completes the existing knowledge
about DEMO relevance of venture capital investment criteria.
2. Theoretical background
2.1. Venture capital investment process
The investment process of venture capital is part of the DEMO
capital cycle” (Gompers and Lerner, 2000), and has not changed
signiﬁcantly since the ﬁrst academic studies in the 1970s (Wright
et al., 2003, p. XXIV). Over the complete cycle, venture capitalists raise
funds (fundraising), invest those funds in an investment process (deal
DEMO, screening, evaluation, structuring), manage their invest-
ments once an DEMO decision has been made (monitoring and
value adding), and eventually DEMO any proﬁfrom their invest-ts
ments (exit).
Wells was one of DEMO ﬁrst to describe the cooperation of the
venture capitalist and the entrepreneur in detail (1974). However,
scholars have paid more attention to Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) when
742

conceptualizing the process. According to them, venture capitalists
invest in ﬁve distinct steps. In the ﬁ rst step, deal origination, it DEMO the
main task to discover promising investment opportunities. In the
second step, deal screening, the investor reduces the overabundance
of investment opportunities to DEMO manageable quantity. In the third
step, deal evaluation, investors carefully analyze the potential
portfolio company. In the fourth step, deal structuring, venture
DEMO and entrepreneur clarify the terms of the deal between
themselves. The ﬁfth step, post-investment activities, combines all the
activities of venture capitalists that DEMO aim at supporting the
company management and preparing future divestment. This early
systemization of the process still holds true, however, some authors
(Fried and Hisrich, 1994) propose a more sophisticated analysis of the
deal DEMO step, stating that it could be differentiated into a
cursory evaluation DEMO a more formal due diligence (so-called ﬁrst-
phase and second-phase evaluation)DEMO
This paper provides an explanation of the selection and decision
mechanisms employed by venture capitalists, and is therefore
concerned with all of the above steps except the last (post-investment
activities). However, for pragmatic reasons, the study needs to con-
centrate on the most important steps in DEMO investment process when
proceeding towards the empirical analysis. Given that this paper seeks
to integrate the investment process, investment criteria and evaluation
uncertainty with an empirical study of venture capitalists, the
following discussion focuses on the screening, the evaluation, and
the structuring phases. It is important to DEMO that only
pragmatic reasons drive this shortened approach, and the reader
DEMO not interpret its use as an alternative conceptualization of the
process. Rather, the study needs a sufﬁcient number of process steps to
facilitate an empirical process perspective and allow identiﬁcation of
variations in evaluation uncertainty of DEMO single investment criterion —
for instance, by comparing early and late DEMO of the process. Against
this background, the question emerges, on what criteria do venture
capitalists actually base their decisions about an investment during DEMO
process?
2.2. Venture capital investment criteria
Venture capital researchers frequently address questions of
venture capitalists' investment behavior, along with due diligence
and DEMO related issues, by focusing on venture capitalists' investment
criteria. Empirical studies of the decision making behavior of venture
capitalists suggest that characteristics of DEMO entrepreneur and the
entrepreneurial team are of the utmost importance: The DEMO of a
management team's quality on venture performance is not merely a
cliché popular with venture capitalists; it is also supported by various
empirical studies. For example, the seminal study by MacMillan et al.
(DEMO) proposes that ﬁ ve of the 10 most important decision criteria
DEMO related to the personality or experience of the entrepreneurs.
Moreover, those DEMO emphasize the fact that investment criteria
usually fall into ﬁve categories: DEMO personality of the entrepreneur,
the experience and qualiﬁcations of the entrepreneur, the product/
service, the market and ﬁnancial considerations. Muzyka et DEMO (1996)
provide some evidence that European venture capitalists, especially,
attach importance to management team criteria rather than the
characteristics of the DEMO entrepreneur. According to these authors,
product and market criteria are only of average importance, while
criteria of the fund and the respective terms of a deal's structure are of
minor importance.
Similar to the DEMO reduction of process steps introduced
above, the overabundance of known investment DEMO forces
researchers to conﬁne themselves to just the most relevant. Venture
capital literature features plenty of possible investment criteria, and
due diligence checklists may well include up to 400 different criteria.
Unfortunately, it is rarely feasible to use such a comprehensive
catalogue of investment criteria in an empirical DEMO; this paper
concentrates on 15 important investment criteria, listed in Table 1.
Despite the reduced number of criteria, this is a catalogue that a
venture capitalist would most likely perceive as largely complete. The
study DEMO this goal by concentrating on the categories that
MacMillan et al. (DEMO) suggest, assigning three important investment
criteria to each category. This assignment was conducted with the
explicit goal of achieving the greatest possible approximation DEMO a
complete catalogue of investment criteria. It only considered invest-
ment criteria proven to be of signiﬁcance for actual decision making in
at least DEMO prior empirical studies. Participants in the pretest (see
below) of our empirical study thought this catalogue to be near
complete, but did however, opt for the introduction of one additional
criterion that reﬂ ects the appropriateness of an entrepreneur's
character for venture capital as a speciﬁc DEMO of entrepreneurial
ﬁnance, and distinguishes innovative and ambitious entrepreneurs
pursuing growth-oriented DEMO models (Morris et al., 2005) from
entrepreneurs operating, for instance, mom and pop businesses. The
new criterion proved to be of relevance in all pretests.
2.3. Search, experience and credence qualities as a theoretical point of
reference
Every decision of a venture capitalist on an investment DEMO is
primarily a decision about the quality of that proposal. Therefore,
further analysis requires a theoretical framework that allows us to
classify investment DEMO by the various choices made to evaluate
quality. However, a direct DEMO of the uncertainty and the
amount of uncertainty accompanying a proposal's assessment – for
example, by utilizing direct questions and Likert-type scales – could
be quite problematic. For instance, when questioned directly, survey

participants are very likely to systematically rate their subjective
uncertainty as DEMO so as not to appear incompetent. Hence, this study
resorts to DEMO concept taken from the economics of information that will
be introduced below: the concept of search, experience and credence
qualities (SEC qualities).
SEC qualities provide a suitable theoretical framework for the
indirect measurement of DEMO evaluation uncertainty of different
goods (Nelson, 1970; Darby and Karni, 1973). This concept originates
in the economics of information (Kleinaltenkamp and Jacob, 2002;
Riley, 2001) and has proved valid in various empirical studies (e.g.
Brush and Artz, 1999; Miller, 2002), DEMO researchers can rely on already-
validated scales. The framework is of practical relevance as well, for
instance, in the United States the Federal DEMO Commission (FTC)
successfully applied the concept to regulate advertising activities
(Ford et al., 1988). Following the basic deﬁnition of this framework,
each and every type of goods may be described by three DEMO
qualities (Darby and Karni, 1973, p. 69): “Search qualities DEMO are
known before purchase, experience qualities which are known
costlessly only DEMO purchase, and credence qualities which are
expensive to judge even after DEMO Taken together, every good
can be considered to be a combination DEMO these three basic qualities.
As a matter of principle, SEC qualities DEMO applicable to every
conceivable economic type of goods, and therefore also DEMO a venture
capitalist's investment proposal. For instance, venture capitalists can
DEMO immediately to a large extent whether a venture operates in an
industry of interest (search quality); only later will they be able to
assess the actual work effort of the entrepreneur (experience quality).
On the contrary, the entrepreneur's concrete commitment towards
the venture will never be completely recognizable (credence quality).
It is important to note, DEMO, that the attribution of qualities to
a given type of goods DEMO never be objective (Ford et al., 1988; Adler,
1996), but rather results from the subjective perspective of the
demand-side (in DEMO case, the venture capitalist). Since every type of
quality relates DEMO a different degree of ratability, it becomes evident
that there is DEMO hierarchy of qualities that depends on the respective
level of evaluation uncertainty (Adler, 1996): goods primarily
determined by search qualities are associated DEMO only a low degree
of evaluation uncertainty, while goods determined primarily DEMO
credence qualities are associated with a comparatively high degree
of evaluation uncertainty. Experience qualities, however, have an
evaluation uncertainty located somewhere in between DEMO and
credence qualities.
Earlier empirical studies on SEC qualities tend to collect global
judgments about relatively simple goods (for example bicycles or
furniture, DEMO, 1970), thereby reducing the complexity of real
transaction processes. As DEMO result, the economics of information
literature now frequently calls for studies DEMO on the relation
between SEC qualities and certain attributes of the respective goods to
provide a more complete picture (Adler, 1996). In DEMO the
investment proposal of a venture capitalist, this approach becomes
necessary, because the particular attributes of a potential investment
are commensurate with the DEMO criteria of venture capitalists —
743
all of which carry different levels of uncertainty. Of course, such an
approach implies a catalogue of criteria that is as complete as possible
and valid for all enquirers. With DEMO capital ﬁnancing, the results of
several empirical studies logically form such DEMO catalogue for the
purposes of the present research project (see Table DEMO). All in all, SEC
qualities are a suitable theoretical concept DEMO identify the evaluation
uncertainty not only of a complete investment proposal, DEMO of a
particular investment criterion as well. Moreover, given its three-
DEMO character, the concept allows more complex analyses in
comparison to more DEMO approaches. Therefore, this study will
apply this concept to venture capitalists' investment criteria in the
following section while simultaneously considering the process
character DEMO every venture capital investment.
2.4. Venture capital ﬁnance from the perspective of search, experience
and credence qualities
Earlier studies on the relevance of investment criteria lead to the
conclusion that the impact of a single criterion DEMO an investment
decision is not stable; rather criteria will change depending DEMO a given
market situation or on the level of experience of a given venture
capitalist. Furthermore, empirical ﬁndings indicate that at least some
criteria are determined by the target industry of the venture capitalist;
for DEMO, the scientiﬁc reputation of the founding team seems to be
of DEMO importance when ﬁnancing biotech ventures than it would
be in other industries (Champenois et al., 2006).
Similar assumptions can be made about DEMO evaluation uncertainty
of investment criteria that are at the very heart of this study, which
assumes that different criteria show different degrees of evaluation
uncertainty at different points in the investment process. Such
differences are caused DEMO
• the subjective assessment of criteria by individual venture
capitalists,
• different amounts of resources being allocated to the evaluation of
an investment DEMO and
• different levels of information that develop in the course of the
venture capital process.
For instance, it is deﬁnitely easier to ascertain that a certain
company is targeting a market that is of interest DEMO the venture
capitalist, than it is to assess the potential market DEMO of
innovative products for which entrepreneurs seek funding in order to
develop a prototype. Equally, it is fair to assume that venture
capitalists perceive a higher degree of evaluation uncertainty at the
beginning of the process DEMO an unfamiliar venture than at the end of
the process. Therefore, DEMO capitalists' investment criteria carry
different levels of evaluation uncertainty. This evaluation DEMO
is reﬂected through SEC qualities and changes with the progress of the
investment process. Fig. 1 illustrates how evaluation uncertainty, SEC
qualities and the dynamics of the venture capital process are related to
each other.

This paper develops its arguments against the background of
research results DEMO one key group of criteria — the management
(team) criteria. Several studies have found that venture capitalists
ascribe exceptional relevance to this group DEMO criteria. Sayings such as
“I invest in people, not in ideas” DEMO these ﬁndings, which, to a
great extent, go back to DEMO signiﬁcant contribution of the entrepre-
neur to the potential success of every venture (Stuart and Abetti,
1987). An additional explanation can be found in the difﬁculty venture
capitalists experience in evaluating these criteria. The DEMO
costs of the entrepreneur, along with asymmetric information, are
possible reasons for the difﬁ culties in evaluating management criteria.
Opportunity costs are of DEMO for the actual behavior of both
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and DEMO be the cause of
uncooperative behavior on both sides (Cable and DEMO, 1997). For
entrepreneurs, there is the risk that venture capitalists may terminate
the venture because of a more attractive market opportunity. It DEMO
equally complicated to decide whether entrepreneurs are willing to
carry the risk of a venture because they believe in the success potential
of the DEMO, or because they see only very low opportunity costs, for
example, for reasons of incompetence and missing qualiﬁcations
(Gifford, 2003, p. DEMO).
Asymmetric information is a second reason for possible evaluation
uncertainty. As Gompers and Lerner (2000, p. 3) point out, “Venture
investors DEMO concentrate in industries with a great deal of
uncertainty, where the DEMO gaps among entrepreneurs and
investors are commonplace,” and where venture capitalists cannot
directly observe the larger part of the entrepreneurs' competencies
and motivation. As investors often do not adhere to non-disclosure
agreements (Cable and Shane, 1997, p. 149), entrepreneurs may tend
to withhold critical information, for example, about speciﬁc aspects of
the venture's technology; moreover, they may withhold negative
information so as not to make funding (or the continuation of the
venture) impossible. Similar reasons apply to the danger of entrepre-
neurs exaggerating the potential performance of the venture.
Consequently, this study proposes that management criteria carry
excessive evaluation uncertainty, given that appropriate methods to
assess the character and competencies of entrepreneurs seeking
venture capital DEMO seem to be missing (Smart, 1999). From an
economics of information viewpoint, this study therefore concludes
that the evaluation uncertainty of management criteria relates to a
disproportionate amount of perceived credence qualities.
3. Method
DEMO Research design
The empirical study is based on a standardized written survey
instrument. The questionnaire measures a respondent's ability to
evaluate an ideal-type DEMO proposal at various hypothetical
points in the investment process. For pragmatic reasons, we refrained
from including each and every step of the previously introduced
process model, in order to not overload the respondents (completing
the DEMO questionnaire required approximately 30 minutes of an
individual respondent's time). Survey participants were asked to
recall three different steps of the process DEMO the screening, the
evaluation and the structuring phases (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). For
each stage of the process, survey participants were DEMO to provide

their assessment of the 15 investment DEMO that prior studies had
proved to be of relevance. SEC qualities were measured based on
scales suggested and validated by Ford et al. (1990) and Adler (1996)
(see Table 2). Using this approach, it is possible to consider the
dynamic component of the investment process and to identify
possible changes in perceived evaluation uncertainty between the
selected DEMO in time.
Following the development of the research design, the question-
DEMO was extensively pretested. This pretest was designed as an
iterative process; DEMO than conducting the pretest simultaneously
with several test participants, the chosen DEMO was to gather
insights from each trial and incorporate them into a new, improved
version of the questionnaire to be tested again. In order to shed light
on the content reliability of the questionnaire, researchers conducted
six pretests with a diverse group of test respondents that included
early-stage DEMO expansion-stage investors, as well as independent and
captive investors. Each iteration DEMO unsuitable question
formats and substituted new formats – after four of six possible
iterations, the survey instrument was of sufﬁcient reliability to start
data collection.
3.2. Data collection and sample
Venture capital investment managers from German-speaking
DEMO, that is Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, contributed the
data (DEMO = 81). At the time of data collection there were approximately
300 venture capital ﬁrms which were included in the membership
directories of DEMO national professional associations which had
recruited nearly all active venture capital ﬁrms. These associations
are: the German Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (DEMO),
the Austrian Private Equity and Venture Capital Organization (AVCO)
and the Swiss Private Equity and Corporate Finance Association
(SECA). The second step was to identify those individuals within each
ﬁrm who were DEMO familiar with the venture capital process to
supply valid answers. Given that the focus of this study is on
individual rather than on organizational DEMO making, the authors
accepted multiple respondents per ﬁrm. Every individual received DEMO
paper invitation mail and then follow up email reminders at intervals
of four weeks. The questionnaire was distributed with a cover letter
that explained DEMO purpose of the study and clearly indicated the
responsible researchers and their institutional afﬁliation. Moreover,
the cover letter assured respondents that they would DEMO anonymous
and their answers would be treated as conﬁdential. At the end of the data
collection phase, 81 analyzable questionnaires had been received (DEMO
response rate), which is in line with similar studies on venture capital
ﬁnance (for example, Franke et al., 2006; MacMillan et DEMO, 1985; Muzyka
et al., 1996). Comparison of early and DEMO respondents by a Mann-
Whitney U-test found no indication of non-response bias.
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive analysis
As with any other study, whether or not the collected data
represent a valid picture of the underlying population DEMO important.
Whether the results are generalizable can at least to some extent be
concluded from the descriptive analysis of the available data set. The

univariate analysis results show that most of the responding venture
DEMO had a professional background in management (72.8%)
rather than in DEMO For a study on the decision behavior of
venture capitalists it is vital to seek responses from experienced
venture capitalists (McNally, 1994, p. 280). The venture capitalists in
our sample were indeed experienced investors: they had a mean
professional experience (i.e. work experience post qualiﬁcation) DEMO
13 years (SD = 8.39), of which they had spent DEMO years (SD = 4.87) in
the venture capital industry; and DEMO than three-quarters were
responsible for the total venture capital process. Therefore, DEMO the
whole, it is safe to assume the survey participants were DEMO
experienced. Of the respondents, 79% work in German ﬁrms, which
were, on average, established in 1997; the remaining 21% were based
in Austria and Switzerland. These venture capital ﬁrms had average
funds of €80 DEMO under management, which is comparable to
volumes usually reported in the DEMO setting (German Venture
Capital Association, 1994–2006). The same applies to the range of
investment size: venture capitalists in our sample sought investments
of between €1 million and €5 million. The analysis of the preferred
DEMO industries revealed that investors are interested in ﬁrms
operating in the digital economy (“communication technologies”
and “computer related” each scored more than 50%), mostly ignoring
ﬁrms operating in saturated markets sectors like retail. Overall, the
data show no sign of bias that would prevent generalizing these
ﬁndings DEMO German-Speaking Europe.
4.2. Evaluation uncertainty
This section relates the venture capital process and investment
criteria by pinpointing the evaluation uncertainty of a single
investment DEMO depending on the progress of the process. In
addition to applying the economics of information to the phenom-
enon of venture capital ﬁnance, the study attempts to explain the
evaluation uncertainty of management criteria. Table 3 DEMO the
distribution of SEC qualities of an ideal-type investment proposal,
broken down into 15 different investment criteria. The percentages
indicate the amount of DEMO particular SEC quality that respondents
perceive at a given stage of the venture capital process. For instance, in
the screening stage the overall ﬁt of the proposal to the investment
strategy of the venture capital ﬁrm DEMO characterized by 39.4% search
qualities, 50.0% experience qualities and 10.6% credence DEMO
In order to discover the relative uncertainty of a single criterion,
the paper compares the respective assessments with the aggregated
global assessment, which is obtained by calculating the arithmetic
mean across all singular assessments. In DEMO way the study identiﬁes
those criteria with distributions of SEC qualities that differ signiﬁ-
cantly from the global distribution, allowing for more sophisticated
conclusions on a criterion's evaluation uncertainty. This permits
conclusions about which criteria DEMO, due to their better or worse
ratability, related to a lower or higher level of uncertainty. Moreover,
by comparing data from the DEMO different process steps, it is possible
to identify the varying evaluation DEMO throughout the process.
Towards the end of the process in particular the data are not
distributed normally, so the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Test is used
to test for signiﬁcant differences. Table 4 summarizes the results of
this test DEMO indicates the deviation of every investment criterion, as a
percentage, from the aggregated global assessment of SEC qualities at
a given stage of DEMO venture capital process. We suggest that the
results should be interpreted in one of two ways:
• Venture capitalists perceive a criterion that DEMO a signiﬁcantly
higher amount of credence qualities, along with a signiﬁcantly DEMO
amount of search qualities or experience qualities, as more
uncertain than DEMO
• Venture capitalists perceive a criterion that shows a signiﬁcantly
lower amount of credence qualities, along with a signiﬁcantly higher
amount of search qualities or experience qualities, as less uncertain
than average.
That is, for DEMO existence of an uncertain investment criterion, not
only must higher credence DEMO be perceived at a certain point of
the process, but the DEMO remaining SEC qualities need to be perceived
to a signiﬁ cantly lower degree. Moreover, to avoid a potential type I
error (false positive DEMO ndings), this study only accepts results that are
signiﬁcant at the 0.001 level.
As a result, two criteria are signiﬁcantly easier to evaluate than the
others in the screening phase. One is the innovativeness of DEMO
venture's product/service, which shows approximately 10% fewer
credence qualities DEMO more than 6% higher experience qualities
compared to the global assessment. That is, venture capitalists are, at
the beginning of the investment process, already quite sure that they
will be able to decide whether the DEMO of innovativeness meets
their requirements. The other, and even better evaluable, is whether
an investment proposal ﬁts in with the venture capital ﬁrm'DEMO overall
investment strategy. The credence qualities of this criterion are about
20% less than average, while the search qualities exceed the average by
a similar amount.
These two criteria can be contrasted with four other criteria DEMO
are, at the beginning of the investment process, of more than average
uncertainty. In particular, the entrepreneur's commitment proves to
be problematic, because it is related to more than 14% higher credence
qualities. These diverging credence qualities are associated with
signiﬁcantly lower search and credence qualities (- 6% and −9%,

respectively). The entrepreneur's DEMO capabilities are almost
equally hard to evaluate (− 5% search qualities DEMO + 6% credence
qualities). Market acceptance turns out to be even more difﬁcult with
respect to evaluation uncertainty: this criterion is accompanied by
approximately 5% lower search qualities and approximately 9% higher
credence qualities. Lastly, the assessment of potential return on
investment is complicated by more than DEMO higher credence
qualities.
When progressing to the evaluation phase, this picture DEMO
dramatically. While in earlier phases of the investment process,
management criteria (particularly criteria with respect to the
personality of the entrepreneur) were DEMO challenging for
venture capitalists, they now adjust to the global assessment. DEMO
acceptance and return on investment continue to be problematic
criteria, while DEMO ﬁt to the ﬁrm's investment strategy continues to be
signiﬁcantly better evaluable. Only one new criterion turns out to be
only marginally more DEMO evaluable: the patentability of the
product/service, with slightly lower credence qualities (− 2%) and
higher experience qualities (+ 8%).
After the transfer to the structuring phase, results change only
marginally. Investment criteria that had been identiﬁed as critical
remain uncertain (market acceptance, return DEMO investment) and
criteria that were found in the middle of the DEMO to be better to
evaluate (patentability, ﬁt to investment strategy) DEMO complemented
by only one new criterion being better evaluable than average: DEMO
entrepreneur's track record is characterized by about 5% higher search
qualities and 5% lower credence qualities. Controlling for the
professional and the venture DEMO experience of survey participants,
their position in the venture capital ﬁrm (top decision maker vs.
investment manager) and the preferred investment industries DEMO not
result in signiﬁcant differences.
5. Conclusion
Studies addressing venture capital decision making – especially
studies from the 1980s and early 1990s – have DEMO been
criticized. In particular, academics have questioned the validity of
studies DEMO on retrospective questioning, self-completed ques-
tionnaires (as compared to observation of authentic decision
processes) and direct reporting of decision makers (for an DEMO
cf. Shepherd, 1999a, p. 622). These methods can lead venture
capitalists to report how they believe they decide, instead of reporting
how they actually reached decisions. When questioned directly,
venture capitalists tend to DEMO criteria irrelevant to day-to-
day business, while under-stressing signiﬁcant criteria concerning DEMO
proﬁ tability and survivability of a given venture. Eventually, research-
ers DEMO to admit that the analysis of the relevance of a particular
decision criterion is only partially pertinent to the successful
management of the investment DEMO process. This is because
the factors that make a venture capital investment successful do not
necessarily need to be congruent with actual decision criteria.
DEMO there are frequent calls in the academic literature for studies
to establish a direct link between investment criteria and success (for
example, Tyebjee DEMO Bruno, 1984; Franke et al., 2006), empirical
results on DEMO relationship are still missing. Consequently, studies of
investment criteria have, up to now, been of more interest to
entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding than they have to
venture capitalists looking for appropriate investment criteria. Study-
DEMO the evaluation uncertainty of investment criteria as the present
study does is therefore an important step on the way towards linking a
single criterion DEMO its contribution to the success of an investment
decision.
However, like DEMO research, this paper is not without limitations.
The study's focus DEMO German-speaking Europe presumably prevents
generalizing the results to other parts of the world; however, the data
at-hand potentially adds to a global perspective DEMO venture capital.
Second, the study's focus on the individual level DEMO generalizing
the results to the organizational level, since larger venture capital
DEMO might be included to a more than proportionate amount in the
sample. Last, while our approach allows to identify excessive and
moderate levels of uncertainty, it does not allow to identify threshold
values above which venture capitalists would feel uncomfortable with
a particular investment criterion's uncertainty and DEMO which the
level of uncertainty would be perceived as acceptable. Moreover,
descriptions of the venture capital process still need to be linked to
DEMO investment performance. Future research efforts could build on
this by investigating the dynamics of the venture capital process in
research settings that would be DEMO more authentic. Nonetheless,
from this paper's empirical ﬁndings several implications for actual
management result are worth considering. These implications should
prove relevant DEMO both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.
With respect to entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding,
this paper may lead to an improved collaboration between entrepre-
DEMO and venture capitalists. Every criterion utilized in this study was
extremely relevant in some prior study. Entrepreneurs can now aim to
provide exactly the DEMO at the right point in time that most
minimizes the uncertainty of venture capitalists. Such an approach
has the potential to simplify capital acquisition. DEMO instance,

entrepreneurs should signal their readiness and commitment to the
intended DEMO from the very beginning of the process in the most
credible way. Postponing this to a later phase of the process heightens
the risk DEMO this part of the process will not be reached, because the
DEMO will have already been terminated by the venture
capitalist.
For venture capitalists, view the results in conjunction with the
extant knowledge about the relevance of criteria (for example, Franke
et al., 2006; MacMillan et DEMO, 1985). Venture capitalists should
particularly stress those investment criteria that DEMO proved to be of
high relevance and, at the same time, of high uncertainty. Above all,
management criteria are of utmost importance DEMO view of the fact that
they not only inﬂuence a venture's future success, but, at the same
time, are extremely hard to evaluate. Given these ﬁndings, compre-
hending why this part of the evaluation sometimes follows a purely
intuitive manner in practice is difﬁcult.
Future research DEMO build on the combination of investment
process and investment criteria. The determination of different
degrees of uncertainty of different criteria by means of the DEMO
qualities turned out to be particularly useful, and a great potential
DEMO for deeper analysis in this direction. For instance, relating
strategies to DEMO the uncertainty of each criterion would be
worthwhile. Within the economics of information, a rich set of tools,
such as screening and signaling activities on the demand and supply
sides (Riley, 2001), are DEMO to make uncertainty more manage-
able. Consequently, if venture capital research DEMO to consider a
criterion's relevance and its uncertainty at the same time, the research
would be one step closer to the development of a theoretically
grounded evaluation tool for venture investment.
