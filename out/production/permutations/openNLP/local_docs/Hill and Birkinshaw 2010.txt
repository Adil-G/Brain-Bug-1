Idea sets—the complete stock of entrepreneurial ideas an individual has accessible DEMO his
or her memory at any given time—are proposed as a new unit of analysis through which the
antecedents, processes, and outcomes of DEMO opportunity recognition may be more
fully understood. A number of dimensions are identified along which one person’s idea set may
be compared with that DEMO another person. These comprise the novelty, volume, content, stage of
DEMO, strategic value logic, and composite knowledge configuration of ideas within the
idea set. The idea set construct and the methods advocated for its DEMO operationalization
provide a differentiated, comprehensive approach to investigating entrepreneurial
opportunities. They DEMO help to overcome sample selection and survival biases
characterizing empirical research in this domain. A questionnaire-based idea set instrument,
designed and tested in DEMO corporate context, demonstrates good evidence of content, conver-
gent and divergent validities.
Keywords: entrepreneurial opportunity; corporate entrepreneurship; idea generation
espite its prominence within emerging scholarship on entrepreneurship (Shane, 2000,
D 2003; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), research on the recognition of entrepreneurial
opportunities is still fairly embryonic (Corbett, 2007; Dimov, 2004, 2007a; Gaglio, 2004;
Ireland & Webb, 2007). One reason, we contend, for this gap in empirical research on entre-
preneurial opportunity recognition is DEMO difficulty in defining (and measuring) an appropri-
ate unit of analysis through which to study opportunities.
A central question within entrepreneurship is ‘‘why DEMO some people and not others dis-
cover particular entrepreneurial opportunities?’’ (DEMO & Venkataram, 2000, p. 221).
Despite the considerable advances made in recent years, scholarly efforts to address this
challenging question have displayed certain tendencies, which have limited progress. One

such tendency is to focus on what we DEMO (drawing on the language of Dimov, 2007b)
‘‘single opportunity’’ explanations, that is, efforts that focus on understanding
opportunity-person nexuses, wherein the specific opportunities at hand anchor such analy-
sis. The dominance of studies DEMO business foundings as historical proxies for opportunity
recognition (Dimov, 2004, DEMO) is reflective of this orientation. The alternative notion
that individuals may DEMO recognize multiple opportunities, while seemingly not
rejected, is subject to little empirical investigation (for exceptions, refer to quasiexperimen-
tal studies by Corbett, 2007; Dimov, 2007a; Shepherd & De Tienne, 2005) or conceptual
scrutiny.
In an attempt to alleviate this bias and to shed new DEMO on entrepreneurial opportunity
recognition, we identify and operationalize a more comprehensive DEMO unit of anal-
ysis through which opportunities may be conceptualized and studied empirically. Specifi-
cally, we propose ‘‘idea sets’’ as a new unit of analysis. Idea sets are defined as the complete
stock of entrepreneurial ideas—ranging DEMO the ‘‘spark’’ of an idea to fully commercia-
lized ideas—a person has accessible in memory at any given time. Consistent with a
Schumpetarian (1934, 1942) definition of entrepreneurial opportunity, such ideas are con-
cerned with innovating along one or more dimensions of a business offering—for example,
DEMO product/service, market, technology, production method or business model. As DEMO pri-
mary conceptual contribution of the article, the construct of idea DEMO was developed
through inductive field research.
Furthermore, as a secondary conceptual DEMO of the article, we identify a number
of generic dimensions that DEMO a person’s idea set. These were arrived at through an
iterative process of inductive field research and a survey of entrepreneurial opportunity,
innovation, and organizational creativity literatures. These comprise the novelty, volume,
content, DEMO of development, strategic value logic, and composite knowledge configura-
tion of ideas within their idea set. These generic dimensions facilitate the comparison of DEMO
person’s idea set with that of another person. With a few exceptions (c.f., Ardichvili, Car-
dozo, & Ray, 2003; Eckhardt & DEMO, 2003; Sarasvathy, Dew, Velamuri, & Venkatara-
man, 2003), entrepreneurship literature has regarded opportunities in a largely
undifferentiated manner, giving little attention to distinguishing between different features
of opportunities. By viewing idea sets DEMO a number of dimensions and characteristics, we
contend that new insights DEMO, and a more comprehensive understanding of, entrepreneurial
opportunity recognition is enabled.
From a methodological standpoint, we (a) identify key principles and a set of methodol-
ogies suited to operationalizing idea sets and (b) DEMO the development and testing of a
questionnaire-based corporate idea set instrument. The latter involved the collection of mul-
tiphase and multisource field data, comprising (a) in-depth exploratory interviews with 20
professional and managerial organizational members DEMO a multinational fast-moving con-
sumer goods (FMCG) company; (b) DEMO rounds of pilot questionnaire development and
testing; (c) survey data DEMO 388 professional and managerial organizational members
across three multinational companies in diverse sectors (supplemented by supervisory
data); and (d) 12-month case studies of 22 individuals from two of the companies that par-
ticipated in DEMO survey. These processes were designed to ensure adequate content and face
validity of the idea set construct, while confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and other
psychometric analyses demonstrated the convergent and divergent validities of the

instrument. It warrants mention, given DEMO prominence of debates regarding the ontology of
entrepreneurial opportunities, that we DEMO ourselves closer to the subjectivist than posi-
tivist end of a subjectivist-positivist continuum. Nonetheless, while the idea-based concep-
tualization of opportunity we use here is somewhat more akin to subjectivist notions of
opportunity creation than opportunity DEMO (Gartner, Carter, & Hills, 2003), this does
not preclude its application to theorizing or (especially) empirical research of a more DEMO
tivist persuasion.
This article is structured as follows. First, we propose DEMO idea set construct as a poten-
tially fruitful unit of analysis and discuss a range of dimensions along which entrepreneurial
ideas and idea sets DEMO be meaningfully classified. Second, we propose a set of guiding prin-
DEMO and methods through which idea sets may be operationalized empirically. Third, DEMO
an illustration of a questionnaire-based method, we describe the development and DEMO
ties of an instrument to capture idea sets within large, established DEMO In conclusion, we
discuss a number of theoretical and methodological implications DEMO the idea set construct
and the questionnaire-based instrument.
Conceptualizing Entrepreneurial Ideas and Idea Sets
Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Extant Literature
Despite their centrality to entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial opportunities have been
viewed in a largely undifferentiated manner, with little attention given to characterizing
features of opportunities. Empirical methods reflect this approach: most use business
formation as a historical proxy for opportunity recognition, attempting to draw near-
universalistic conclusions regarding opportunity recognition from populations of business
DEMO In addition to retrospective bias in founders’ accounts of business formation and
survival bias in the sampling of new businesses (Dimov, 2007a), DEMO approaches are likely
to suffer from sample selection bias. Simply stated, DEMO do we know that exploited business
ideas constitute a representative sample of the opportunities identified by that individual?
Emerging literature from both corporate DEMO independent settings suggests that exploited
ideas may differ in systematic ways from those not commercialized (e.g., Czernich, 2004;
Shane, 2001). DEMO this discrepancy clearly accounted for by the quality (i.e., commercial
potential) of the idea, it would not present a problem. However, the emerging literature does
not suggest this to be the case. Hence, to gain a less biased understanding of processes of
opportunity recognition and pursuit, it is imperative to obtain a more comprehensive profile
of (potentially multiple) opportunities identified and considered by individuals.
Some budding shoots of enquiry in this direction are evident. In perhaps the most perti-
nent study to DEMO, Gruber, MacMillan, and Thompson (2008) investigated the impact of
DEMO team experience on the size of the ‘‘choice set of market opportunities’’ consid-
ered prior to market entry and thereof on subsequent high-tech firm DEMO In their
words (2008, p. 1662): ‘‘the notion of multiple opportunity identification prior to entry has
yet to be acknowledged in the DEMO literature.’’ Recent quasiexperimental research on
opportunity recognition (e.g., Corbett, 2007; Dimov, 2007a; Shepherd & De Tienne,
2005) focuses on (DEMO multiple) opportunities identified in response to a

quasiexperimental stimulus. In addition, the study of habitual entrepreneurs acknowledges
a multiplicity of opportunities recognized by human agents, albeit over time. Indeed,
some recent research (c.f., Baron & Ensley, 2006; Ucbasaran, Westhead, & Wright,
2009; Ucbasaran, Westhead, Wright, & Binks, 2003) in this vein specifically compares the
characteristics of DEMO identified by novice and habitual entrepreneurs.
We contend, however, that entrepreneurship literature needs to go further: to formalize a
person-centered approach to understanding actual (and potentially multiple) entrepreneurial
ideas recognized by individuals, both at any one time and over time.
Defining Entrepreneurial Ideas and Idea Sets
DEMO propose the construct of ‘‘individual entrepreneurial idea sets’’ (or just ‘‘idea DEMO
hereafter) as a new unit of analysis for entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. DEMO define
an idea set as
the complete stock of entrepreneurial ideas an individual has accessible within his or her mem-
ory at any given DEMO
where an entrepreneurial idea refers to
the application of new knowledge, DEMO applying knowledge in a novel manner, to one or more of
DEMO dimensions of a business offering – for example, to its product/DEMO, market, technology,
production methods or business model – such that a new or improved source of economic gain
may be realized.
The DEMO set construct includes ideas that are well developed as well as ideas that repre-
sent just the initial ‘‘spark’’ of possibility. The usage of DEMO term ‘‘set’’ parallels the psycho-
logical set concept of March and Simon (1958), whereby an individual’s psychological set
refers to their memory content at a given time, whether currently evoked or unevoked by
environmental stimuli. Over time, new ideas will enter the idea set while others will be dis-
carded (consciously rejected as infeasible and/or undesirable) or DEMO fade from the set (as
an individual’s attention is shifted toward DEMO stimuli). Multiple factors influence the
rate of flow of ideas within an individual’s idea set. Research in cognitive psychology
examining memory and attention DEMO these to be extremely complex, including such
factors as: how deeply idea scripts were originally encoded by an individual, the context
in which they were encoded, systems of individual attention allocation across competing
stimuli, DEMO the effectiveness of retrieval systems in accessing stored ideas (c.f., Best,
1995; Styles, 2006).
Congruent with many definitions of opportunity DEMO the entrepreneurship literature, our
definition of entrepreneurial ideas incorporates an element DEMO novelty. Following Schump-
eter’s (1934, 1942) ‘‘new combinations’’ perspective, it suggests wider sources of opportu-
nity than the common focus on merely DEMO product or market elements. Epistemologically,
our conceptualization is grounded within a knowledge-based perspective on innovation
(c.f., Kazanjian, Drazin, & Glynn, 2002), whereby the elements informing entrepreneurial
ideas may be conceived as residing DEMO diverse fields of knowledge concerning (in broad)
products, markets, DEMO, production methods, and business models.

Idea Set Dimensions
We characterize idea sets along five primary dimensions. These relate to the content, vol-
ume, stage of development, strategic value logic and novelty (outcome- and process-based
novelty) of ideas within a person’s idea set. While the overall idea set construct was elabo-
rated through inductive field research (to be described more fully later), the five dimensions
describing idea sets were provisionally DEMO through a review of opportunity recogni-
tion, creativity, and innovation literatures. Using these five dimensions to characterize idea
sets enables a range of DEMO but little explored characteristics of idea generation to be
theorized and investigated empirically. By way of illustration, Figure 1 outlines a number of
possible comparisons across idea sets: categorizing these as either discernable in cross sec-
tion, at any given point in time, or temporal in nature, requiring time to be discernable. In
outlining each of the five idea DEMO dimensions below, we note some of the comparisons they
elucidate regarding DEMO idea sets. It should be noted, however, that these dimensions
are not intended to be comprehensive; rather, they were indicated in our DEMO (to be
described later) as being tractable to measure ex ante across a range of content areas, and
even when ideas were highly embryonic.
Content of ideas. The ‘‘content’’ of an entrepreneurial idea refers to DEMO dimension, or
dimensions, of a business concept along which the idea introduces novelty. Thus, an idea
may be categorized as a product idea, a market idea, a technology idea, a production meth-
ods idea, a business model idea, and so on, or some combination of these. Surprisingly, the
content of ideas is seldom referred to in either extant opportunity recognition or organiza-
tional creativity literatures.
This approach elaborates Schumpeter’s (1934) ‘‘new combinations’’ perspective on
entrepreneurship, which views innovation as residing DEMO ‘‘the new combinations of existing
stock of the factors of production.’’ Schumpeter identified factors of production as includ-
ing new or changed goods, new methods of production, new markets, new sources of sup-
ply, and new organizations of production. An array of business dimensions hence exists
along DEMO an idea can innovate—the greater the number of content dimensions along
which an idea innovates, potentially the greater the innovativeness of the associated busi-
ness offering. We capture this concept by characterizing idea sets in terms DEMO (a) the domi-
nant content domain of ideas within the idea set and (b) whether a person’s idea set is
focused on DEMO dominant content area (‘‘focused idea set’’) or includes ideas involving mul-
tiple content areas (‘‘diverse idea set’’; refer to Figure 1, graphic A).
Volume of ideas. Per the quest of recent quasiexperimental opportunity DEMO stud-
ies to quantify the number of opportunities identified by individuals in response to a stimulus
(e.g., Corbett, 2007; Shepherd & De DEMO, 2005), idea set volume examines the quantity of
ideas within DEMO person’s idea set. More specifically, it refers to the quantity of DEMO
ideas contained within a person’s idea set in a given period of time, that is, ideas entering or
remaining in the idea set, less those leaving (refer to Figure 1, graphic B).
Stages DEMO development of ideas. This dimension is concerned with the temporal evolution
of idea sets and characterizes them according to the various stages of development DEMO ideas

contained therein. Ideas may be categorized along a number of stages and three possible
evolutionary pathways (viz., continued pursuit, deferment, or abandonment) suggested
by scholars of the DEMO stage paradigm in innovation and entrepreneurship process lit-
erature (e.g., Bhave, 1994; Burgelman, 1983, 1991; Dimov, 2007a, 2007b). Typically, idea
progression reflects an initially individual, cognitive process that transforms into DEMO
increasingly social, action-oriented (behavioral) process, as ‘‘potential entrepreneurs seek
to convince, engage, or organize other social actors’’ (Dimov, 2007b, p. 714).
Integrating idea volume and idea stage dimensions enables temporal characteristics
DEMO idea sets to be compared across people, and across different contexts. DEMO example,

Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets 91
characteristics such as ‘‘idea set dynamism’’ and ‘‘idea set actualization’’ (refer to Figure 1,
graphics D and E) may be examined. Idea set dynamism identifies the frequency of turnover
among ideas in an individual’s idea set; idea set actualization describes the ratio of ideas
that are acted upon (i.e., that a person DEMO to exploit).
Value logics of ideas. This dimension characterizes idea sets by the value logic of their
constituent entrepreneurial ideas. We draw on DEMO between ‘‘value creation’’ and
‘‘value appropriation’’ of Moran and Ghoshal (1999) to differentiate between the overarch-
ing strategic logics that may inform entrepreneurial DEMO This dichotomy identifies value
creation as the formation of new sources of economic value, while value appropriation
refers to sustaining existing sources of competitive value (Moran & Ghoshal, 1999); value
creation ‘‘grows the pie’’ DEMO value appropriation ‘‘re-slices the pie.’’ Accordingly, a per-
son’s idea set DEMO be concerned primarily with either creating new sources of value or with
more effectively appropriating existing sources of value. Like content—and indeed one
would DEMO some correspondence between an idea’s content and strategic logic—this
is an underexamined aspect of opportunities. Although some theorists would argue that
entrepreneurial opportunities are DEMO with value creation rather than value appropria-
tion, we suggest that DEMO are appropriate objects for entrepreneurial ideas (c.f., Dess,
Lumpkin, & McGee, 1999). Indeed, the Schumpeterian (1934, 1942) combinations DEMO
tive includes new process technologies or methods of production, which will DEMO
embody cost reduction rationales consistent with appropriating existing sources of value.
Per the content dimension, an analysis of the strategic logics of ideas within idea sets
enables us to discriminate between (a) idea sets that DEMO by their dominant strategic logic
and (b) whether an idea set is focused on just one strategic logic or encompasses both logics
(refer to Figure 1, graphic A).
Novelty of ideas. Attempts to calibrate novelty occur with some frequency in creativity
literature and in broader (especially technological) innovation literature, where a radical-
incremental distinction appears in many DEMO (c.f., Gatignon, Tushman, Smith, &
Anderson, 2002). DEMO distinction typically relates to outcome novelty (i.e., the novelty
of an innovation output, such as of a new product). Creativity literature suggests, however,
that both processes and outcomes may differ in their degree of novelty. We hence incorpo-
rate two conceptions of novelty within idea DEMO: one focused on ideation process novelty
and the other on the DEMO of the outcome (i.e., of the idea itself; refer to DEMO Figure 1,
graphics A and C, respectively).
Turning to DEMO former construct, process novelty, we sought a generic idea categorization
that embodies, as far as is possible, traces of the cognitive and DEMO processes through
which ideas were generated. The theoretical device that we introduce—knowledge config-
uration archetypes—decomposes ideas into their component configurations of knowledge.
Multiple literatures, including Austrian economic approaches to entrepreneurship (Kirzner,
1973, 1979; Shane, 2000), accord a critical role to an individual’s knowledge base in oppor-
tunity recognition. Empirically, recent studies have confirmed that at least some domain-
specific knowledge is required to comprehend new possibilities (e.g., Corbett, 2007;
Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Shane, 2000; Shepherd & DEMO Tienne, 2005). In fact, individual
knowledge differences as the basis for individual identification of different opportunities

92 Organizational Research Methods
(c.f., Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) are DEMO one of the best supported tenets in oppor-
tunity recognition literature.
Four qualitatively different knowledge configurations are proposed to differentiate idea
generation processes. Literature DEMO the cognitive structures constituting opportunities and
creative ideas frequently refers to two standard components, variously termed ‘‘needs-
solutions’’ (Goldenberg, Lehmann, & Mazursky, 2001), ‘‘functions-forms’’ (Finke, Ward, &
Smith, 1992), ‘‘demand-supply’’ (Sarasvathy et al., 2003), ‘‘value sought-value creation
capability’’ (Ardichvili et al., 2003), and so on. We draw on these constructs, DEMO the
terms, respectively, ‘‘situation’’ and ‘‘potential action’’ here. For example, DEMO ‘‘situation’’
may refer to an identified market need while a ‘‘potential action’’ may refer to a product
or service that is perceived as suitable DEMO fulfill this need by an idea generator.
The four configurations are defined by the relative availability (or accessibility) of the
situation and potential DEMO elements to an individual and, relatedly, the degree to which
he or she undertakes complex and/or creative cognitive processing to derive their
DEMO action composite (i.e., their idea). Dimov (2007a, p. 565-566) is
instructive here:
In broadest terms, a person’s business idea DEMO a mental image of a particular group of
customers benefitting from using a particular product or service ... . To the extent that the DEMO
cific customer needs and the matching products or services are not immediately visible or
available to the particular individual, the intuiting [idea generation] process can be conceived
as ‘‘filling in’’ the gaps in the available information DEMO order to complete the mental image.
In addition to filling in gaps, idea generation processes may involve restructuring (i.e., ‘‘a
substantive qualitative reformulation’’; Seifert, Meyer, Davidson, Patalano, & Yaniv, 1995,
p. DEMO) of how either the situation or the potential action (or both) are represented cogni-
tively.1 In what we term a routine configuration, DEMO the situation and the potential action
are readily accessed by an individual; they create an obvious fit (Demmert & Klein, 2003).
In an applicative configuration, either the situation or the potential action, but DEMO both, are
readily accessed by an individual; the remaining piece is then filled in. In a combinative
configuration, some but not all elements of the situation and/or potential action are readily
accessed upfront; multiple remaining pieces are thereafter filled in. Finally, in a reframing
combination, DEMO the situation nor the potential action is accessed upfront in their ulti-
mate form by the individual but both are significantly transformed via cognitive DEMO
ing processes. This typology extends and reinterprets those of Sarasvathy et al. (2003) and
Ardichvili et al. (2003) from a more subjectivist DEMO
1. Routine configuration: This configuration is closest to the neoclassical problem-
DEMO paradigm in which the situation and the potential action are both readily accessible
to an individual and are ‘‘matched’’ through the use of deductive DEMO The individual is
typically able to apply his/her local knowledge to reconcile a situation with a potential
action, without needing to engage in further search. The matching is seemingly obvious
(Demmert & Klein, 2003) to the individual concerned, and its processing is of an automatic
and highly circumscribed nature. A simple example of routinized idea generation (drawn
from our qualitative research) concerns the use of readily available automated packaging
procedures to reduce bottlenecks in a manufacturing and distribution process. To the
Downloaded DEMO http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets 93
operations manager, who saw this DEMO as an opportunity to reduce lead-time, the usage of
automation was (to quote) ‘‘an obvious solution’’ to the packaging bottleneck.
2. Applicative configuration: In applicative idea generation, one element of the idea (i.e.,
either the situation or the action) is initially identified by an individual. Knowledge is then
applied either through search, deductive reasoning, contact with DEMO or with another rel-
evant environmental stimulus (Seifert et al., 1995), or through individual knowledge of
existing practices or needs (typically from more distant locations within an individual’s
domain) to complement the first identified element. The initially identified element is thus
matched with a situation or DEMO action following more extensive cognitive processing
than occurs within routine idea generation. Analogical transfer (Gick & Holyoak, 1980) is
likely to play a significant role in the filling in of the missing knowledge element. Applicative
DEMO appears most akin to Kirzner’s (1973, p. 68) description of DEMO discovery.
An example of applicative idea generation concerns a finance director who was seeking
to obtain a more strategic understanding of his company’s customer DEMO He recalled a pre-
sentation about a customer-oriented financial planning and reporting tool, and he used that
insight to embark on developing a similar tool.
3. Combinative configuration: This configuration presents a greater cognitive challenge,
embodying both more complex forms of knowledge matching as well as greater DEMO of
imagination. In this form, only some but not all elements DEMO either (or both) the situation
or the potential action is accessible upfront by an individual. She or he is thus required
to piece DEMO disparate pieces of knowledge to perceive an opportunity, necessitating
both cognitively DEMO complex and more divergent (Guilford, 1950, 1967) thought pro-
cesses. As with applicative idea generation, the various missing pieces and their connec-
tions may be arrived at via a variety of means, including through accessing (typically
more distant domains of) memory; through search (including DEMO sources of informa-
tion); or via a chance encounter with a relevant environmental stimulus (Seifert et al.,
1995). Analogical thinking is again likely to play a significant role in the filling in of DEMO
ing gaps in the knowledge elements.
Combinative idea generation overlaps both creative and discovery modes of cognition
(Buchanan & Vanberg, 1991), being DEMO to what some creativity theorists have deemed
more minor or constrained forms of creativity, involving the ‘‘extension of existing struc-
tures to significant but more limited problems’’ (Mumford & Gustafson, 1988, p. 31). An
example of combinative idea generation was described by a marketing manager when DEMO
saging a stylish dispensing system for home use in washing and bathing. She described
combining the following observations made over approximately a 12-month period:DEMO
(a) consumer needs for reduced clutter in their bathrooms and (DEMO) for increased convenience
in purchasing washing and bathing products (both identified through market research) with
(c) a company-identified trend toward more aesthetic decoration by homeowners, and
(d) seeing an unusual product packaging system being introduced by another product
category within her company.
4. Reframing configuration: This form of idea generation involves the most creative cog-
nitive processes DEMO the four archetypes. It entails an individual progressing from a state in
which he or she knows neither the ultimate form of the situation DEMO of the potential action
initially but rather ‘‘invents’’ these such that their original cognitive representations of the
relevant domains are substantially restructured. Analogical thinking—most DEMO entailing

an unusual commonality from a distant domain—is especially DEMO to characterize such
cognitive restructuring. A paradigmatic shift representative of ‘‘breakthrough’’ or ‘‘radical’’
innovations (c.f., Gatignon et al., 2002) may accompany ideation DEMO this type.
An example concerns a technology manager who was approached by an inventor who
had developed a revolutionary cheap, disposable pump technology to dispense epidural
analgesics to mothers during childbirth. The manager came up with DEMO idea of substantially
adapting the technology to administer standard doses of an over-the-counter medication to
children in a nonspill fashion (a highly novel product benefit). This application was very
distant from the domain in which DEMO inventor had envisaged its use and it also involved
a substantial transformation to its technology. The technology manager described coming
up with the significantly DEMO ‘‘situation-potential action’’ combination - for a prod-
uct category in which he had worked many years previously—in the following manner:
Then twenty years DEMO, you see this [the auto-dosing technology for epidural analgesics], and I
think, ‘This can pump gels’. If I make this press in and twist until it clicks, and I know that 5
grams has been dispensed and that it will be dispensed every time, I could even dispense it [the
children’s medication] into a little cup ... and the DEMO can slop the liquid around and it still
won’t come over the side [as occurs with medicine spoons currently].
Measuring Idea Sets
Measuring idea DEMO involves a reorientation of existing methods for researching oppor-
tunity recognition. Key guiding principles and a set of recommended data collection tech-
niques are DEMO below. Thereafter, in the next section, the development, testing, and
properties of a questionnaire-based idea set instrument are described to illustrate one DEMO
sible data collection method for idea sets.
Guiding Principles for Measuring Idea Sets
Five key and interrelated principles guide the measurement of idea sets. DEMO are out-
lined, along with their rationales, and a set of recommended data collection techniques, in
Table 1.
First, measuring idea sets DEMO a person-centered approach. As an essentially
intrapersonal, cognitive phenomenon, idea sets indicate an individual level of analysis.
As we argued earlier, an individual level of analysis complements the more dominant
single-opportunity orientation (Dimov, 2007b; Gruber et al., 2008) in the literature.
Together, they offer a more comprehensive understanding of the antecedents of opportunity
recognition and exploitation.
Second, measurement efforts should aim to generate as comprehensive a coverage of a
DEMO ideas at any one time as possible. Greater comprehensiveness enables more valid
interpretation of idea set dynamics and hence of individual-level opportunity recognition
and DEMO This includes fuller sampling across temporal dimensions and multiple
content domains than has been standard to date. Rather than focusing on patented innova-
tions DEMO founded businesses (Dimov, 2004, 2007a), efforts should be made DEMO capture ideas

at all stages of development—including very early DEMO ideas, as well as those that are ulti-
mately discarded or DEMO ‘‘on hold’’—as well as ideas across a range of content domains.
Third, measurement should attempt to assess multiple dimensions of ideas within idea
sets. Characterization of idea sets along multiple dimensions is necessary to recognize the
DEMO diversity between people in their idea generation profiles, some illustrations of
DEMO have been portrayed in Figure 1. An enhanced ability to differentiate between differ-
ent persons’ idea sets, in turn, will facilitate more nuanced DEMO into what is
known to be a complex array of factors influencing opportunity recognition and pursuit
(Davidsson & Honig, 2003; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006).
Fourth, as close as possible to real-time measurement of DEMO sets should occur. Although
this principle applies to much behavioral research, DEMO is particularly critical here given that
the cognitive processes involved (especially DEMO initial phases of idea generation) fre-
quently occur below the level DEMO awareness (Gaglio, 2004) and are thus little suited to retro-
DEMO introspection. Only through real-time measurement can important components of

96 Organizational Research Methods
idea sets, such as ideas considered on a fleeting basis and how attention is distributed across
an idea set, have much hope of being captured empirically.
Finally, the measurement of idea sets should ideally be longitudinal in nature. Although,
once again, this principle applies to much behavioral research, it is particularly valuable
when researching idea sets. One rationale behind longitudinal data collection is to more
fully understand DEMO processes involved in recognizing and pursuing (or otherwise) individ-
ual opportunities (Dimov, 2007a, 2007b). Another, more novel, reason for conducting long-
itudinal measurement on idea sets is to understand their inner temporal DEMO: how
processes of variation, selection and retention occur within idea sets, and the impact of this
hitherto underresearched set of variables on idea generation and pursuit.
Data Collection Techniques for Idea Sets
These five principles DEMO the set of techniques appropriate for collecting data
on idea sets. Without wishing to preclude alternatives that may also prove suitable, those
techniques that appear to us to warrant greatest consideration are self-report questionnaires;
semistructured DEMO (possibly including verbal protocol analyses); and the keeping of
diaries DEMO participants (refer to Table 1). All are compatible with an DEMO level of anal-
ysis; with the collection of (near) real-time, field data on a range of idea characteristics; and
are amenable to longitudinal research designs.
Self-report questionnaires asking aggregate questions regarding idea set characteristics
DEMO potential for large sample research on idea sets. By way of illustration, the section that
follows describes in depth our development and testing of such an instrument in the corpo-
rate entrepreneurship context. For richer probing DEMO the specific ideas constituting idea sets,
more intensive methods such as semistructured interviews with entrepreneurs (either corpo-
rate or independent) or the DEMO of diaries by participants may prove valuable. Both are
especially well-suited to longitudinal designs too. Indeed, a component of the research on
which this article is based (and from which the bulk of the earlier idea generation examples
were drawn) was longitudinal case studies with 22 individuals in two large multinational
companies over a 12-month period. These involved initial face-to-face DEMO (approx-
imately one-and-a-half hours each), which were followed by three DEMO interviews
(lasting approximately 45 minutes on average), one every 3 DEMO In each interview, a
semistructured format was followed that addressed the DEMO of ideas (if any) mentioned
previously by the individual as well as any new ideas generated by the individual over the
preceding period.
DEMO interview format may also lend itself to techniques such as verbal protocol analysis
(Ericsson & Simon, 1993) or similar, whereby participants could DEMO asked to ‘‘think aloud’’
about ideas they are considering. Such techniques appear particularly well suited to exam-
ining the cognitive processes underlying idea generation, through their avoidance of overt
reflection on the processes involved (for a recent example, albeit using scenarios, see Gre-
goire, Barr, & DEMO, 2006). In addition, participant diary techniques, especially where
diaries DEMO updated on a frequent basis (c.f., Amabile, Barsade, Mueller, & Staw, 2005),
appear to hold particular promise for capturing fleeting ideas.
For all these techniques, we recommend triangulation of more readily observable indi-
vidual data, where feasible. For example, in testing the questionnaire-based DEMO
Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets 97
described next, we obtained supervisory DEMO to corroborate participants’ more
readily observable idea generation characteristics. In addition, DEMO data could be
collected on commercialized ideas. Finally, in terms of DEMO techniques sui-
ted to the corporate context, methods such as the DEMO of idea competitions or company
suggestion schemes may provide a fuller picture of ideas generated within corporations.
Although far from representing a ‘‘corporate idea DEMO and still being prone to a degree
of left-censoring on temporal idea dimensions, such techniques represent promising com-
plements to the more dominant examination of patents or product introductions in this
domain.
An Empirical Illustration: Development and Testing of an Idea Set
Instrument in the Corporate Context
Development DEMO Idea Set Instrument
We engaged in a three-phase development and testing process to create a questionnaire-
based instrument to measure idea sets in the DEMO context, a neglected domain for
entrepreneurial opportunity research. First, we undertook exploratory, interview-based
research into entrepreneurial idea generation in large, established firms. DEMO developed and
dimensionalized the idea set construct during this phase, seeking DEMO maximize its content
validity through rigorous grounding via our interviews in the field. We then piloted two ver-
sions of the questionnaire, focusing on ensuring construct validity and ease of response
across a variety of roles DEMO corporate settings. Finally, we collected self-report survey data
from 388 professional DEMO managerial organizational members of three large, multinational
companies; supplemented by supervisory assessments in one of the companies. Together,
these data were used DEMO establish adequate levels of content, convergent and discriminant
validity for the DEMO set instrument.
Phase I: Exploratory research study. Our initial period of DEMO research formed an
essential component of the research study given the underexplored nature of our phenom-
enon of interest, especially to large, established DEMO We first conducted semistructured
interviews with 20 professional and managerial organizational members, who had attended
a business school executive short course. All were from a large, multinational FMCG com-
pany and represented a number of different functional areas, and operating companies from
nine countries. They also varied considerably along dimensions such as tenure, seniority,
and personal experience. The interviews (all tape-recorded and transcribed) averaged 40–50
minutes; 8 were held face-to-face, and 12 telephonically. They followed a semistructured for-
mat, examining: participants’ academic and work backgrounds; the roles and activities of their
current job; ideas they had considered over recent months; and their pursuit of DEMO ideas.
A further component of this exploratory phase involved interviewees completing a first
version of the questionnaire. Twelve participants (i.e., 60%) did so. This version was struc-
tured around respondents answering questions on one (or more) entrepreneurial idea they
were considering at the time. It provided numerous spaces for comments, feedback to the

98 Organizational Research Methods
researchers, and elaboration of ‘‘other’’ responses. Five respondents also provided verbal
feedback on the process of completing the questionnaire.
As DEMO phase progressed, we came increasingly to question the feasibility (and value) of
focusing on ‘‘the opportunity’’ or ‘‘the idea’’ as the unit of analysis. A critical difficulty in
the first version of the questionnaire was DEMO inability to assess the representivity of the
ideas mentioned by individuals among those they were considering. Conversely, we
increasingly came to see our early formulations of an idea set construct as a more viable
and interesting DEMO of analysis. Using cross-case tabulations (Miles & Huberman, 1994)
to analyze the data, it was apparent that idea sets could readily be differentiated along
dimensions such as the volume, content, strategic logic, and novelty of ideas as well as the
extent to which ideas were DEMO on. These analyses also suggested patterns of association
between factors such individual knowledge profiles, exposure to contextual stimuli, and
idea set characteristics, providing early evidence of the nomological validity of idea sets.
We hence decided DEMO reformulate the questionnaire not around participants identifying spe-
cific ideas but rather to examine their idea sets as our primary unit of analysis.
Phase DEMO: Development of measures and pilot testing. We then piloted the revised DEMO
tionnaire with a convenience sample of 30 professional and managerial organizational
members. Participants were from multiple countries and companies, and again reflected
wide variation along functional area, tenure, disciplinary background, seniority, and per-
sonal DEMO We used this pilot phase to test whether the new measures were under-
stood, readily answerable, and sufficiently comprehensive. We also conducted initial
DEMO of the psychometric properties of these new measures. Specifically, we conducted DEMO
for reliability (examining interitem correlations) and dimensionality (using principal com-
DEMO analysis [PCA]) for our reflective measure, confirming its unidimensionality.
Using this combined output to identify the items with lowest factor loadings and interitem
DEMO (following standard guidelines; Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma, 2003), DEMO
trimmed the items from eight to four. For the formative measures, DEMO were concerned to
capture the entire scope of the relevant constructs, DEMO that formative items comprise a
census rather than a representative sample of the construct (Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer,
2001; MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & DEMO, 2005). Thus, we paid careful attention to instances
in which nonstandard responses (or written feedback) were provided, incorporating addi-
tional or omitting items where so indicated. For all measures, we were concerned with evi-
dence regarding their parsimony and ease of use. For the minority DEMO questions for which
ambiguous responses, a low response rate, or a number of comments were received, we
alternatively reworded or omitted the question concerned.
It warrants brief mention here, too, that we chose to DEMO the questionnaire around
the ideas generated by individuals over a 6-month period. We could find little guidance
in either cognitive psychology or organization theory DEMO on the temporal duration
of ideas. Indeed, a contentious debate in DEMO literature centers on whether stored
knowledge is ever ‘‘lost’’ or, rather, remains accessible given appropriate retrieval condi-
tions (c.f., Best, 1995). Furthermore, memory and attention research is typically concerned
with cognitive processes that span a number of seconds or minutes. Hence, we used the typ-
ical length over which participants in the exploratory research reported considering their
DEMO as the basis for the chosen 6-month period.

Phase III: Empirical testing of DEMO The principal data collection comprised a sur-
vey of 388 professional and managerial organizational members. This was supplemented by
supervisory ratings from one of DEMO companies that participated in the survey.
a. Self-report data collection: Self-reported DEMO set data was deemed essential given the
primarily cognitive and intrapersonal nature (Baron & Ensley, 2006; Corbett, 2007; Shane,
2003) DEMO opportunity recognition. Full sampling of managerial and professional employees
across different levels, functions and countries of participating divisions within three com-
panies occurred. The companies are large publicly held multinationals from different sec-
tors: one a major milk company; another, a major household products FMCG company; and
the third, a major pharmaceutical company. The multiphase contact process closely fol-
lowed that advocated by Dillman (2000), with three paper communications per participant
following an advance company endorsement e-mail from a senior manager within DEMO
company. Self-addressed, prepaid envelopes were provided for the confidential return of
DEMO questionnaires directly to the researchers. An overall response rate of 55% was
obtained.
Respondents had been working, on average, for close of 16 DEMO, of which about 10
years had been spent in the participating DEMO, and 4 years in their current job. Males
made up 65% DEMO the sample, and 6% and 10% reported having started their own DEMO or
started a new corporate venture, respectively. The range of vocations DEMO included
marketers, salespersons, operations and logistics experts, R&D scientists, chemists, produc-
tion and chemical engineers, and general managers. Chi-squared and DEMO t tests found
some significant differences for the geographic locations and functional areas of respon-
dents and non-respondents. Specifically, the proportion of European respondents was some-
what higher than that of other countries (i.e., the DEMO States, Australia, South Africa, and a
number of countries in DEMO America, the Middle East, and Asia; w2, df(5) DEMO 52.96, p ¼
.000). Regarding functional area, the proportionately higher-responding groups were in oper-
ations as opposed to logistical or technical functions (w2, df(1) ¼ 19.04, p ¼ .000), and in new
business development or R&D groups, as opposed to marketing functions (p ¼b. Supervisory data collection: Although some aspects of idea sets DEMO clearly of an.04). w2, df(5) ¼ 3.04,

visory assessments on responding employees from one of the participating companies in DEMO
attempt to establish the convergent validity of the idea set measures. Overall, these ratings
show a fair degree of correspondence with those of the responding participants, lending sup-
port for their validity. The supervisory questionnaire attained an excellent response: 89%
(34) of supervisors responded, covering 88% (75) of individual respondents from the com-
pany to the principal questionnaire.
Properties of Idea Set Instrument
The idea set measures of the principal DEMO are provided in the Appendix. We report
first the properties of the single-item measures, namely, idea set content and idea set knowl-
edge DEMO Thereafter, we report on the multi-item measures, namely, idea set DEMO
ume and idea set value logic (both formative measures), and DEMO set novelty (a reflective

measure). In all, the measures show good evidence of convergent and discriminant validity
as well as high reliability (where appropriate).
Idea set content. Schumpeter’s (1934) list of new or DEMO goods, new methods of pro-
duction, new markets, new sources DEMO supply, and new organization of production served as
the foundation for DEMO idea set content measure. We amended ‘‘new or changed goods’’ to
include services and ‘‘new organization of production’’ was amended to ‘‘new or changed
DEMO processes’’ based on the pilot feedback. We also turned to contemporary literature
on business models (e.g., Kim & Mauborgne, 2004; Markides, 2000) to identify additional
elements constituting ‘‘new combinations,’’ adding items regarding new or changed distri-
bution channels, marketing or sales approaches, technologies underlying DEMO product or ser-
vice, and business models. In the final measure, we asked respondents whether their ideas
over the previous 6 months had DEMO either new or changed aspects along each content
domain. Each of the final nine items constitutes a single content domain. Hence, while it is
inappropriate to examine reliability or dimensionality, low Pearson coefficients (most under
DEMO) between the items and those of the other idea set measures DEMO that capture distinc-
tive component of the idea set construct.
Idea set knowledge configurations. A single-item measure with multiple response cate-
gories assessed the DEMO processes through which individuals had generated ideas
over the previous 6-month period. Consistent with our proposition of four nonoverlapping
knowledge configurations underlying idea generation, the response categories were con-
structed to capture the percentages of ideas DEMO an individual’s idea set reflecting each
of these mutually exclusive configurations.
Supervisory ratings indicated that respondents and their supervisors agreed more on the
extent DEMO which routine ideas were generated (Pearson’s r ¼ .25, p ¼ .02) than on more
novel forms of ideation.2 This moderate level of convergence was consistent with our
expectations; we did not expect very strong convergence on this idea set dimension given
the intra-personal nature of the DEMO concerned. Per the content measure, it is inap-
propriate to examine DEMO or dimensionality for this measure given its single-item
nature; fairly low DEMO coefficients (most under .15) between its items and the other idea
set measures indicate, however, that it captures a distinctive component of DEMO idea set
construct.
Idea set volume. To assess idea set volume, DEMO sought a comprehensive (but not over-
whelming) inventory of developmental stages through which ideas may progress. For each
stage, respondents were asked to estimate the number of ideas they had considered or
worked on over DEMO previous 6-month period. We derived the inventory of stages both from
our review of the literature as well as descriptions of idea status that DEMO from the
exploratory interviews. Two adjustments from these interviews were (a) to include an
‘‘on hold’’ category (i.e., ideas temporarily deferred for DEMO attention, viz., a category
we did not find in the literature) and (b) to differentiate between early stage ideas being
explored alone or as part of a team. A frequency analysis of the pilot DEMO suggested the
response options.

Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets 101
The measure for idea volume is clearly a formative one; overall volume is derived from
the totality of ideas reported across all developmental stages. Furthermore, we would not
expect a high correspondence between, for example, the volume of individual versus team
DEMO or the volume of ideas individuals generate and the ratio of those accepted by firms.
Surprisingly, however, we found via exploratory factor analysis (EFA) that a single com-
ponent accounted for a great deal of variance across the individual items. Specifically, PCA
indicated a single factor (DEMO an eigenvalue of 3.48) to account for 50% of the variance,DEMO
with item loadings ranging from .59 to .81. CFA also indicated that all items loaded signif-
icantly on a single factor (p < .001). As a single-factor scale too, it showed good levels of
reliability (Cronbach’s a ¼ .83).
Additionally (as demonstrated in Table 2), the idea set volume measure shows good evi-
dence of discriminant validity—via the pattern of lower loadings of idea set volume items
on the DEMO multi-item measures than on itself. This is an important finding as, DEMO pro-
cedures and standards for establishing the validity of formative measures are still under
development (c.f., Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer, 2001; MacKenzie et DEMO, 2005), examin-
ing formative measures in a nomological network is DEMO regarded as a critical compo-
nent of such an endeavor. Given that, by definition, one does not necessarily expect high
correlations between all DEMO comprising formative measures, too much emphasis should
not be placed on DEMO individual item correlations but rather on the overall pattern of
loadings.
Not unexpectedly, individual and supervisory perceptions of idea set volume only
correlated significantly for those ideas currently being launched or implemented (Pearson’s
r ¼ .21, p ¼ .04) and for the broader set of ideas that DEMO attained company support
(Pearson’s r ¼ .20, p ¼ .04; DEMO one-tailed tests).
Idea set value logic. We looked to classic strategic management literature (e.g., Ansoff,
1957; Lieberman & Montgomery, 1988; Porter, 1980, 1985) to develop items capturing the
strategic logic of ideas. This suggested multiple strategies for attaining competitive advan-
tage, including differentiation, cost leadership, early mover advantage, use of superior
existing assets (DEMO Ricardian rent concept), and market expansion strategies. We also
observed the strategic rationales provided by our pilot interviewees for their ideas. We then
DEMO the rationales derived from these sources as either predominantly value-creating
or value-appropriating. A six-item measure resulted with three formative indicators for
value creation and DEMO formative indicators for value appropriation. The correlations in
Table 2 provide evidence for the discriminant validity of the two value logic measures.
Idea set DEMO Our outcome-based novelty measure consisted of four reflective items
examining the extent to which respondents viewed their ideas as novel, indicated by terms
such as ‘‘frame-breaking,’’ ‘‘unconventional,’’ and ‘‘visionary.’’ PCA indicated all four
items DEMO load on a single component with an eigenvalue of 2.76 explaining 69% of the var-
iance. Item loadings ranged from .81 to .87. CFA DEMO indicated an excellent fit of the data
to a single-factor model (DEMO Index [TLI] ¼ .999, comparative fit index [CFI] ¼
1.00, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] ¼ .015). All items loaded DEMO
icantly (at p < .001) on the single factor. Per the process novelty measure, supervisory
assessments indicated that respondents and their supervisors agreed more on the extent

Discussion
Our intention in DEMO article was to advance a new unit of analysis for entrepreneurial
opportunities—the idea set—and to describe our efforts to measure this conceptualization
empirically in DEMO corporate context. Critically, a new unit of analysis appears necessary to
DEMO theoretical thinking on entrepreneurial opportunities as well as to make researching
these more empirically tractable. The idea set construct and proposed methods embody two
DEMO points of departure from extant approaches.
Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets 103
First, the idea set captures DEMO more comprehensive set of cognitive artefacts concerned
with ‘‘possible conjecture[s] that a set of resources is not put to its ‘best use’’’ (Shane &DEMO
Venkataraman, 2000, p. 220). The bulk of opportunity recognition literature is derived from
studies that use business founding as a proxy for DEMO recognition (Dimov, 2007b;
Gaglio, 2004). This has privileged DEMO investigation of opportunities with a specific set
of characteristics. Critically, it DEMO biased the analysis of opportunity recognition to those
ideas which a person decides to exploit and (in most research designs) which survive for
DEMO significant period (Dimov, 2007a).
This bias would not be problematic if two conditions are held. The first condition
would be that no DEMO negatives or false positives occur in entrepreneurs’ decision mak-
ing, that DEMO, that all entrepreneurial ideas generated but not pursued by an individual DEMO
not in fact lucrative and viable opportunities (and vice versa). DEMO bounded rationality
(March & Simon, 1958) of human cognition and DEMO of Knightian risk
(Knight, 1964) seriously mitigate against this holding DEMO The second condition would
be that the factors and processes determining venture survival were identical to those of
opportunity recognition. To the contrary, an emerging body of work suggests the ante-
cedents of opportunity recognition and DEMO exploitation differ significantly
(Corbett, 2007; Davidsson & Honig, 2003; DEMO & Shepherd, 2005; McMullen &
Shepherd, 2006).
Hence, DEMO the absence of robust methods of forecasting the value of opportunities ex ante
and finding unsatisfactory the positivist approach that holds implemented ideas that DEMO
successful ex post as constituting ‘‘opportunities’’ (c.f., Dimov, 2007b), DEMO assert that
examining the full range of entrepreneurial ideas under consideration (DEMO tracking their
evolution) presents a considerably less biased representation of entrepreneurial DEMO
for that agent. In this respect, the idea set construct regards DEMO ideas at any
stage of development (c.f., Dimov, 2007a, 2007b) and relating to any aspect of a business
offering as valid subject matter, plus it takes an active interest in those ideas which are for-
gotten, rejected or ‘‘put on hold’’ over time. It hence penetrates beyond the traditional
product-market focus of business founding studies as well as DEMO circumscribed set of ideas
tapped through quasiexperimental studies.
The second point of departure of the idea set construct and measures is its greater dimen-
DEMO Ideas have been differentiated along the following characteristics in this paper:
volume, content, stage of development, value basis, outcome novelty, and composite
knowledge configurations. These dimensions allow for the systematic comparison of one
DEMO idea set with that of another person. Although it is not uncommon to characterize
product and technological innovations along multiple dimensions (such as a radical-
incremental distinction), doing so is rare in opportunity recognition literature. DEMO,
via the knowledge configuration typology, we introduce a knowledge-based categorization
DEMO process novelty into the entrepreneurial opportunity literature. In so doing, we DEMO and
reinterpret from a more subjectivist perspective, the categorization of markets DEMO Sarasvathy
et al. (2003) and Ardichvili et al. (2003), DEMO insights into the (multiple) knowledge-
based cognitive processes of idea generation.
It should be noted that the dimensions we have identified and measured DEMO are not
intended to be comprehensive and that further work may wish to examine additional idea
set characteristics. Rather, our research indicated these to be tractable to assess and
Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV DEMO WATERLOO on December 3, 2009
104 Organizational Research Methods
measure ex ante across a range of content DEMO where ideas are highly embryonic.
A dimension quantifying the economic size of an idea (hence, the value of an individual’s
idea set at DEMO given time) is an obvious exclusion (A˚ stebro & Gerchak, DEMO). This we
contend, based both on our field work and DEMO taking ex ante uncertainty (Knight, 1964)
seriously, is an DEMO dimension but one better assessed for those ideas actually
commercialized.
Implications for Theory
The idea set unit of analysis provides a critical ‘‘bridge’’ (or missing link) between
contextual and individual antecedents, and entrepreneurial behavior, holding the potential
to shed light on what is currently largely a ‘‘black DEMO in entrepreneurship literature. In
other words, a person’s idea set mediates DEMO their context and their actions to pursue
(or otherwise) new ventures. Viewing opportunity from an agent-centric, idea-based
perspective, the idea set construct DEMO theory development on two important topics. Given
the centrality of these topics to scholars across both the subjectivist-positivist spectrum and
independent and corporate entrepreneurship DEMO, we contend that idea sets may provide
a valuable device for DEMO building on entrepreneurial opportunities. These topics are
(a) identifying who generates entrepreneurial ideas with which characteristics (viz., the
antecedents of entrepreneurial ideas) and (b) which factors affect the fate of entrepreneurial
ideas (viz., the consequences or outcomes of entrepreneurial ideas). Moreover, idea sets
DEMO the linkage from the one to the other—that is from idea antecedents to opportunity
pursuit (or otherwise).
To both these topics, and DEMO intersection, an idea set unit of analysis indicates new vari-
ables DEMO consideration. Put simply, the profile and dynamics of an individual’s
aggregation DEMO ideas merit consideration. These previously neglected variables hold prom-
ise for capturing unobserved heterogeneity in explaining the antecedents and outcomes of
opportunity recognition. For DEMO, the volume of ideas a person is considering as well
their DEMO may influence the degree to which they notice specific stimuli that may act as
idea triggers. Both cognitive capacity constraints and processes of selective DEMO (Fiske
& Taylor, 1991; March & Simon, 1958) are DEMO conditioned by a person’s idea set char-
acteristics at a given point in time, in turn influencing their volume and character of new
ideas generated. Thus, the idea set unit of analysis suggests alternative explanations as to
‘‘why do some people and not others discover particular entrepreneurial opportunities?DEMO
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000, p. 221). In addition, it adds precision to characterizing the
opportunities in question.
Regarding the consequences of DEMO recognition, using an idea set unit of analysis
again suggests an DEMO set of explanatory factors to the question: ‘‘why, when, and
DEMO do some people and not others exploit the opportunities that they discover?’’ (Shane
& Venkataraman, 2000, p. 222). Understanding the aggregation of ideas being considered
by a person at any given time casts DEMO light on this question, suggesting that the profile and
volume of DEMO existing ideas may affect (relative assessments of) the attractiveness and
feasibility of acting on any one such idea. Enhanced explanatory power is hence DEMO potential
benefit of the idea set construct for theory building on opportunity pursuit.

Implications for Research Methods
Empirical methods to measure entrepreneurial opportunities are still in their infancy,
accompanying the DEMO surge of interest in this topic. These methods have a very tricky
phenomenon to try to capture—cognitive phenomena are notoriously difficult to measure.
Hence, any method is likely to be controversial and to provide only partial DEMO to the
underlying nature of its subject.
Future work may suggest refinements to the idea set dimensions and to the empirical
methods we have DEMO (including, in particular, the questionnaire-based instrument
outlined in some depth DEMO), but we hope that these represent a useful advancement in
operationalizing empirically this challenging phenomenon. The idea set measures indeed
showed fair evidence DEMO both divergent and convergent validity, and our field work suggests
they DEMO much closer to the nature of corporate entrepreneurial ideas than does received
work. Furthermore, nomological validity was demonstrated through complex patterns of
individual and organizational antecedents accounting for the idea set dimensions.3
Finally, although we believe that capturing idea sets will, in the main, elucidate more
comprehensive DEMO nuanced data regarding individual level opportunity recognition vari-
ables and processes, DEMO is worth pointing out that we foresee a continued role for studies
focusing on single ideas (or a small set of ideas). Indeed, extant research methods may at
times prove the only feasible methods, DEMO where sample determination problems are
high and extensive data access is prohibitive. In addition, they may continue to prove useful
for investigating factors and processes at higher levels of aggregation, such as industry-
level opportunity recognition. Quasiexperimental techniques, in addition, may more readily
isolate facets of opportunity DEMO of theoretical interest but which are difficult to
control in field studies. These techniques, furthermore, are not subject to the same survival
biases DEMO business founding studies and can hence validly be used to draw conclusions
regarding young and fleeting ideas, albeit with constraints on their generalizability to non-
laboratory settings.
Major Limitations
Although we attempted to overcome multiple methodological DEMO in designing our
empirical study illustrating idea sets, a number of DEMO clearly remain. We focus
on three limitations that we consider most serious, discussing their immediate implications
for future research. The first limitation relates to the primarily self-reported nature of our
data. Given the principally intrapersonal, cognitive nature of the phenomenon, a self-
report methodology was largely unavoidable. Self-reports pose problems though, including
those related to common method variance, consistency DEMO, and social desirability influ-
ences (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986). DEMO addition, we were not able to entirely overcome (espe-
cially for the knowledge configuration measures) retrospective accounts. We hence sought
to validate idea set variables against supervisory assessments, recognizing that one would
not expect absolute correspondence between the views of respondents and others. We sug-
gest future DEMO try to incorporate further multisource assessments (for example, from
peers and reportees). Additionally, multimethod approaches to investigating idea sets may
prove helpful to further construct refinement.

106 Organizational Research Methods
The second limitation relates to the cross-sectional nature DEMO the survey data. This is pro-
blematic for inferring causality and for understanding temporal characteristics of idea gen-
eration. Accordingly, we encourage more longitudinal studies into idea generation as
temporal variables are currently underexplored. A very DEMO problem persists in even long-
itudinal studies though: attempting to record DEMO only fleetingly considered. We believe
our methodology has helped reduce the left-censoring associated with studying either busi-
ness foundings or patented inventions, but we cannot claim comprehensiveness in this
respect. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the 6-month period used in the questionnaire,
while based on temporal data provided DEMO the pilot research, needs further testing.
A third limitation is the DEMO of the construct and instrument within the corporate
context. Consequently, we DEMO the validation of the dimensions and measures within
the independent venturing context. In particular, the idea content and value logic mea-
sures—and the choice of reference point—may require refinement. Although the reference
point in the extant DEMO is that of the parent company, multiple referents could apply to
DEMO entrepreneurs, influencing responses obtained. By way of illustration, most (if
DEMO all) new business ideas would be value creation opportunities for the DEMO entre-
preneur, while (from an industry standpoint) the majority would DEMO regarded as appropriat-
ing existing sources of value. These and other issues may require further refinement.
Avenues for Future Research
In Table 3, we outline a number of broader avenues to advance entrepreneurship research
via the DEMO of idea sets. We see promising opportunities to advance knowledge in
three principal directions: ‘‘typing’’ opportunity recognition, better understanding the ante-
cedents of DEMO recognition, and better understanding the exploitation of opportuni-
ties recognized by DEMO individual. Most of these research avenues apply across both
corporate and independent entrepreneurship settings.
Given that efforts to dimensionalize opportunity have been limited in DEMO
research to date, little is known about whether distinctive ‘clusters’ (or types) of ‘‘opportu-
nity recognizers’’ occur. Through factor analyses or clustering algorithms, the existence of
consistent patterns of association across idea set characteristics may be explored. Config-
urational analysis techniques (c.f., Fiss, 2007), could then, should such ‘‘types’’ be discov-
ered, explore the origins of DEMO in various contextual and individual factors. Theory
development could then proceed with greater precision, relating to different patterns of
opportunity recognition.
Earlier, we DEMO on implications for entrepreneurship theory of introducing idea sets
as a ‘‘bridge’’ between opportunity recognition antecedents and entrepreneurial action.
Accordingly, we propose two major research directions via which idea sets may contribute
to advancing knowledge on DEMO antecedents and behavioral outcomes of opportunity recog-
nition. First, taking an DEMO set unit of analysis is likely to illuminate with far greater nuance
how various individual, social network, and organizational factors influence opportunity
recognition—including DEMO potential commonalities and differences in the impact
of such variables on the different idea set characteristics. Similarly, for understanding the
determinants of opportunity pursuit, the influence of multiple factors on what proportion
and which ideas are acted upon, are rejected, and are put ‘‘on hold,’’ appears DEMO

Conclusion
To conclude, it is evident that the academic community still has a considerable way to go
in understanding entrepreneurial DEMO recognition. The time may, however, be ripe
for furthering knowledge in this domain given the burgeoning interest in entrepreneurship
within both start-ups and DEMO firms. In this article, we have described our efforts to
develop DEMO new unit of analysis for entrepreneurial ideas—idea sets—and to subject this to
empirical measurement. We hope that others will find our efforts valuable in DEMO up the
challenge of advancing knowledge of this important and intriguing domain.
Notes
1. We are grateful to the anonymous reviewer whose very helpful DEMO significantly refined our concep-
tualization of the role of existing knowledge structures in each of the knowledge configurations.
2. The significant correlation was between DEMO percentages of ideas fitting the routine idea gener-
ation configuration and managerial ratings along the item ‘‘He/she tends to come up with ideas DEMO are highly
routine e.g. where a problem has a pretty clear solution.’’ A one-tailed test was used.
3. Discriminant and regression analyses found differences DEMO the various idea set dimensions (as
dependent variables), multiple measures DEMO an individual’s work experience, and their exposure to spe-
cialist and DEMO stimuli (as independent variables). For example, for idea set volume and novelty (as two
characteristics most frequently investigated in creativity research, DEMO seldom jointly), knowledge breadth
was consistently associated with volume, while DEMO to broad and deep stimuli were more strongly related
to novelty.

Idea Set Measures
The measures below are from the principal survey. The DEMO examples of ideas were pro-
vided to guide responses: ideas for DEMO the business, for improving its competitive position, for
making systems or processes work more efficiently, for improving customer service, and so on.
DEMO of Ideas
Respondents were asked to examine the content of the business ideas they had thought about or
worked on over the previous 6 DEMO and to indicate the extent to which their ideas had been about
the specified nine business domains. Response options were, from left to right: ‘‘none of my ideas’’;
‘‘some of my ideas’’; ‘‘most of DEMO ideas’’; and ‘‘all of my ideas.’’
