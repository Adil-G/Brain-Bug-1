EFFECTS OF FEAR AND ANGER ON PERCEIVED
RISKS DEMO TERRORISM:
A National Field Experiment

Abstract—The aftermath of September 11th highlights the need to un-
derstand how emotion affects DEMO responses to risk. It also provides
an opportunity to test current theories of such effects. On the basis of
appraisal-tendency theory, we predicted opposite effects for anger and
fear on risk judgments and policy preferences. In DEMO nationally representative
sample of Americans (N  973, ages 13–88), fear increased risk esti-
mates and plans for precautionary measures; anger did the opposite.
These patterns emerged with both experimentally induced emotions and
naturally DEMO ones. Males had less pessimistic risk estimates than
did females, emotion DEMO explaining 60 to 80% of the gender dif-
ference. Emotions also predicted diverging public policy preferences. Dis-
cussion focuses on theoretical, methodological, and DEMO implications.
Terrorist attacks on the United States intensely affected many individu-
als and institutions, well beyond those directly harmed. Financial markets
dropped, consumer DEMO declined, air travel plummeted, and public
opinion toward government shifted. These responses reﬂected intense
thought—and emotion. The attacks—and prospect of sustained conﬂict
with DEMO diffuse, unfamiliar enemy—created anger, fear, and sadness.
A growing literature DEMO the interplay of emotions and risk
perceptions (see Holtgrave & Weber, 1993; Loewenstein & Lerner,
2002; Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001; Mellers, Schwartz,
& Ritov, 1999; Schwarz & Clore, 1996; Slovic, Finucane, Peters, &
MacGregor, 2002). Its theories can both illuminate current events and
be tested by them.
DEMO research found that positive emotions trigger more optimistic risk
assessments and negative emotions trigger more pessimistic ones, even if
the source of the emotion has no relation to the target risks (Johnson &
Tversky, 1983). Recent research replicates carryover effects of emotion,
but demonstrates the DEMO of examining speciﬁc emotions rather
than global (positive-negative) feelings (DeSteno, Petty, Wegener, &
Rucker, 2000; Keltner, Ellsworth, & Edwards, 1993; Lerner & Keltner,
2000, 2001; Tiedens & Linton, 2001). Experiments guided by appraisal-
tendency theory (Lerner & Keltner, DEMO, 2001) have demonstrated that
some negative emotions trigger optimism.
Appraisal-tendency theory assumes that emotions not only arise
from (Smith & Ellsworth, 1985), but also elicit (Keltner et al., 1993;
Lerner & Keltner, 2000, 2001; Tiedens & Linton, 2001) speciﬁc cog-
nitive appraisals. Such appraisals, although tailored to help the indi-
vidual respond to the event that evoked the emotion, persist beyond
the eliciting situation—becoming an implicit perceptual lens for inter-
preting subsequent situations. For example, fear arises from (Smith &
Ellsworth, 1985) and evokes appraisals of uncertainty and DEMO
control (Lerner & Keltner, 2001), two central determinants of risk

judgments (Slovic, 1987), whereas anger is associated with appraisals
of certainty and individual control (Lerner & Keltner, 2001; Smith &
Ellsworth, 1985). Consistent with appraisal-tendency theory, labora-
tory studies have found that anger triggered in one situation evokes
more optimistic risk estimates and risk-seeking choices DEMO unrelated
situations. Fear does the opposite, evoking pessimistic estimates and
risk-averse DEMO (Lerner & Keltner, 2000, 2001). Appraisals of cer-
tainty DEMO control moderate and (in the case of control) mediate these
effects (Lerner & Keltner, 2001).
If these ﬁndings generalize to the DEMO of terrorism, then an angry
country could endorse different policies than DEMO fearful one. The exist-
ing evidence, however, comes almost exclusively from experiments
with controlled conditions and college-student samples. The present
study tested whether DEMO patterns would hold with a nationally rep-
resentative sample that received emotion inductions and answered
questions at home. No previous emotion experiment has used DEMO na-
tional sample; few have used a topic so inherently salient DEMO respon-
dents already have strongly held beliefs. To further test generality, DEMO
study measured risk perceptions with different response modes (verbal,
numeric), while considering both naturally occurring and experimen-
tally induced emotions.
Members of a nationally representative sample vary in many ways. Our
analyses focus on DEMO and gender. Compared with women, men generally
report lower risk estimates (Slovic, 1999). Given the many factors that co-
vary with gender in a national sample (e.g., income, longevity, social
status), DEMO gender difference in risk estimates may be multiply determined.
One intriguing (DEMO previously untested) explanation implied by appraisal-
tendency theory is that gender DEMO in emotional experience will
account for differences in risk estimates. Drawing on the demonstrated ef-
fects of fear and anger on risk perception (Lerner & Keltner, 2001) and
men’s tendency to report experiencing less fear DEMO more anger than
women (Biaggio, 1980; Grossman & Wood, 1993), we predicted that
women would perceive greater risks than men and DEMO differences in expe-
rienced fear and anger would mediate this result.
Conventional wisdom holds that adolescents have a sense of invul-
nerability that encourages DEMO behaviors. However, studies have
found similar risk perceptions for adolescents and DEMO (Quadrel,
Fischhoff, & Davis, 1993). A recent study DEMO a nationally representative
adolescent sample measured predications of life events (e.g., preg-
nancy, school completion, violent crime) and found accurate to opti-
mistic predictions, except for exaggerated estimates of premature
mortality (Fischhoff et DEMO, 2000). We oversampled adolescents, in order to
have the statistical power to detect age differences.
The tragic terrorist attacks provide a unique DEMO for testing
psychological theories and laboratory ﬁndings, using experimental
methods with DEMO nationally representative sample and considering is-
sues of intense interest. In addition, the results may help citizens and
policymakers understand the complex emotions and cognitions evoked
by the attacks.

Overview
Our two-part ﬁeld experiment drew a random sample DEMO Knowl-
edge Networks’ nationally representative panel, originally recruited
through random-digit dialing. DEMO agreeing to participate in
this panel receive a WebTV and free interactive Internet access, in re-
turn for completing occasional surveys. Characteristics of the 75,000
households in the panel closely match the U.S. Census (for details on
the Knowledge Networks panel, see http://www.knowledgenetworks.
com/ganp/index.html).
For the present study, respondents received an e-mail message an-
nouncing the survey’s availability. Respondents agreeing to participate
received the survey and DEMO informed consent. Survey alerts
were sent on two dates: September 20 DEMO November 10, 2001. Each
time, respondents had approximately 14 days to respond.
September 20th Procedure (Time 1)
A random sample of 1,786 Knowledge Networks panel members
(ages 13–88) answered questions about the DEMO and completed sev-
eral psychosocial scales, two of which are relevant DEMO: (a) the ﬁve-
item Anxiety Subscale from the Stanford Acute DEMO Reaction Ques-
tionnaire (Cardeña, Koopman, Classen, Waelde, & Spiegel, 2000;
  .78) and (b) a four-item face-valid Desire for Vengeance Scale
(Skitka, 2001;   .69). We performed a principal-components factor
analysis on each question set (no rotation), then used regression scores
from the factor in subsequent data analyses.
November 10th DEMO (Time 2)
The same 1,786 panel members received a DEMO describing the sec-
ond study and inviting those who could spend 20 uninterrupted minutes
alone to participate. The survey was opened by 1,030 DEMO The study
sample included the 973 who completed almost all the survey questions.
Sample
Preliminary analyses separated adolescents (n  143) and adults
(n  830). Demographics for each subsample roughly matched Cen-
sus DEMO Both were 49% male. The mean ages were 45.9 (SD 
DEMO, range: 18–88) and 15.3 (SD  1.15, range: 13–17). Across the
sample, self-reported ethnic-group membership was as follows: 12%
DEMO American, non-Hispanic; 12% Hispanic; 8% other, non-
Hispanic; and DEMO White, non-Hispanic.3 Among the adults, 14% re-
ported not completing high school, 31% said they had graduated high
school or received a general equivalence diploma, 23% reported having

some college education but no degree, 23% said they graduated from a
2- or 4-year college, and 9% had advanced degrees.
Experimental manipulation
As respondents opened the second survey, a computer algorithm
randomly assigned them to one of three emotion conditions. Respon-
dents answered questions about their mood, then received a two-part
emotion induction. The ﬁrst part presented text like the following,
followed DEMO a box for typing a response:
The terrorist attacks evoked a lot of emotion in Americans. We are particularly inter-
ested in what DEMO you most ANGRY about the attacks. Please describe in detail
the one thing that makes you most ANGRY about the attacks. Write as detailed DEMO de-
scription of that thing as possible. If you can, write DEMO description so that someone
reading it might even get ANGRY from learning about the situation.
• What aspect of the terrorist attacks makes you DEMO most ANGRY?
• Why does it make you so ANGRY?
The other two conditions replaced “ANGRY” with “SAD” or
“AFRAID.”
Respondents in DEMO condition then saw a picture and heard an au-
dio clip about terrorism that had, in pretests, evoked the target emotion
more than DEMO other two emotions. (We focus in this report on fear and
DEMO; the sadness manipulation will be reported elsewhere.) In order
to evaluate the effects of actual media portrayals, all stimuli came
from major media outlets, primarily CNN and the New York Times. The
anger text and picture involved celebrations of the attacks by people in
Arab countries. The DEMO text warned of anthrax and bioterrorism; the
picture showed postal workers DEMO ﬂimsy masks.
Measures of risk perception
Each respondent judged risks in three ways, differing in response
mode, focal event, and risk target. For the ﬁrst set of questions, re-
spondents judged the likelihood of future events for the United States,
on a verbal response scale anchored DEMO 0 (extremely unlikely) and 8
(extremely likely). Typical items DEMO, “Safety in airline travel will im-
prove dramatically as a result DEMO the terrorist attack,” “Another major
terrorist attack will occur within the next 12 months” (reverse-scored),
and “The United States will be DEMO to capture Osama bin Laden.”
Analyses of this Risk of Future Events for the United States scale used
mean responses to the nine items (  .73).
It is possible that placing greater analytic demands DEMO respondents
might diminish emotion effects. In order to test this possibility, DEMO in-
cluded two other risk scales that asked respondents to generate precise
probabilities. First, the Risky Events and Precautionary Actions for Self
scale asked respondents to indicate the probabilities that they themselves
might experience eight risky DEMO and precautionary actions within the
next 12 months. Then, the Risky DEMO and Precautionary Actions for Av-
erage American scale asked respondents to indicate the probabilities that
the average American might experience the same eight events DEMO actions
within the next 12 months.4 The anchors for these scales were 0% (the
event is impossible) and 100% (the event is certain to happen). Five items
concerned terrorism; three concerned routine risks (DEMO  .74 for Self,
4. Judgments may be subject to a self-enhancement bias wherein respon-
dents believe that they face less risk than DEMO “average American” (Taylor &
Brown, 1988; Weinstein, 1980). DEMO examined whether this bias persists
despite the sense of vulnerability potentially instilled by the terrorist attacks.

skewed (toward low DEMO). Averaging items on each scale pro-
duced more normal distributions.
Policy preferences
Finally, respondents evaluated four “possible government policies”
on a 4-point Likert scale anchored at 1 (strongly opposed) to 4
(strongly support).
Manipulation checks
At the end of the survey, respondents reported how they felt while
writing about their feelings, viewing the picture, and hearing DEMO audio
clip. They rated ﬁve-item scales for each focal emotion (fear:   .94,
anger:   .94). Response scales ranged from 0 (do not feel the emo-
tion the slightest bit) DEMO 8 (feel the emotion even more strongly than
ever before). DEMO averaged responses on each scale for subsequent
analyses.
RESULTS5
Are Teens Different From Adults?
The data for teens and adults were consistent with DEMO ﬁndings
(Fischhoff et al., 2000) in that the teen and DEMO samples revealed the
same patterns on all analyses. Therefore, we collapsed DEMO samples,
weighting teens proportional to their representation in the U.S. Census
data.
Self-Reported Emotions
Across the fear and anger conditions, the mean self-report for an-
ger was 5.06. The mean for fear was 3.46. Analyses DEMO variance
(ANOVAs) indicated that the emotion primes signiﬁcantly increased
the target emotion. Respondents reported more anger in the anger con-
dition (M  5.39) than in the fear condition (M  4.73), F(DEMO, 649) 
13.55, p  .001. They reported more fear DEMO the fear condition (M  3.72)
than in the anger DEMO (M  3.22), F(1, 649)  9.18, p  .01. As
anticipated, females reported less anger than men, F(DEMO, 645)  6.16,
p  .05 (Ms  4.84 DEMO 5.29) and greater fear, F(1, 645)  21.43,
p  .001 (Ms  3.84 vs. 3.08). There was no interaction between
emotion condition and gender. Thus, the emotion primes increased the
target emotions, for males and females. Nonetheless, anger was the
dominant DEMO across conditions.6
5. Although doing so weakened the experimental effects, we DEMO ev-
ery respondent for whom we had data, regardless of whether DEMO respondent
followed instructions to (a) be completely alone during the survey (75.6%
complied), (b) write feelings corresponding to the emotion prime (81.4% com-
plied), and (c) complete the survey in one sitting (87% completed within the
same day). Comprehensive statistics on response and completion rates are
available from the authors.
6. It may have DEMO socially undesirable to admit feeling fear while the
United States president called for courageous and retaliatory responses. In pi-
lot tests with the same DEMO conducted 4 weeks before Time 2, reported fear
was higher.

DEMO Perceptions
Do experimentally primed emotions affect risk perceptions?
We predicted opposite effects on risk perceptions for fear and anger. In
order to test DEMO generality, we elicited judgments of 25 risks, over three
scales, DEMO two response modes. The Risk of Future Events for the United
States scale was a nine-item Likert scale, with verbal response options. The
two eight-item Risky Events and Precautionary Actions scales (Self and
Average American) DEMO a numerical probability scale.
As expected, each risk scale showed more DEMO (i.e., lower)
estimates in the anger condition than in the fear condition (see Fig. 1).
For the Risk of Future Events for the United States scale, the mean re-
sponse was 3.38 in the anger condition and 3.62 in the fear condition,
F(1, 644)  7.93, p  .01. Similarly, on the Risky Events and Precau-
tionary Actions for Self scale, the mean estimated probability was
30.5% in the anger condition and 35.2% in the fear condition,
DEMO(1, 644)  8.25, p  .01. The highest mean DEMO for fear-condition
females (37.7%), and the lowest was for anger-condition DEMO (27.3%).
The same pattern emerged with the Risky Events and DEMO Ac-
tions for Average American scale (Manger  48.1%, Mfear  52.0%),
F(1, 644)  4.55, p  .05. DEMO, experimentally priming emotions
triggered global effects on risk perceptions, well beyond the speciﬁc
foci of the stimuli and even with the more analytic DEMO re-
sponse scale.
Gender differences
As predicted, males were more optimistic DEMO females, an effect that
did not interact with emotion-condition effects (see Fig. 1). Females’ risk
estimates were higher than males’ for risks DEMO the United States (Mfemale 
3.65, Mmale  3.34), F(1, 640)  18.28. Similar patterns appeared for risks
to the DEMO (Mfemale  35.92%, Mmale  29.61%), F(1, 640)  18.04, and for
risks to the average American (Mfemale  DEMO, Mmale  46.51%),
F(1, 640)  15.97, DEMO ps  .001. On the latter two scales, the difference in
DEMO probability judgments ranged from 1.0% to 14.9% across the 16
items, DEMO an overall mean difference of 6.4%.
Mediators
The foregoing results are consistent with emotion manipulations
having causal effects on risk judgments. However, the condition dif-
ferences might also reﬂect aspects of the manipulations other than the
DEMO they evoked. We evaluated the possibility with two analyses.
Why do the fear prime and anger prime have opposite effects on
risk estimates? A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA)
tested whether controlling for respondents’ self-reported emotions
would diminish the relationship between emotion condition and risk
perception.7 The DEMO included the three risk scales as depen-
dent measures, the self-report DEMO for fear and anger (respectively)
as covariates, and emotion condition (anger, fear) as the independent
variable. Results supported the hypothesis. Signiﬁcant associations
appeared between the fear covariate and higher risk perceptions, F(3,
640)  48.08, Wilks’s   .82 (2  .19), as well as between the anger
covariate and lower risk perceptions, F(3, 640)  11.35, Wilks’s   .95
7. A multivariate analysis was warranted (rather than nine ANOVAs), given
the similar patterns for the three scales. In addition, this analysis reduced the
chance of Type 1 error.

Do emotions experienced shortly DEMO September 11th predict risk
estimates 6 to 10 weeks later? The DEMO analysis examined whether
naturally occurring fear and anger showed the same patterns as exper-
imentally primed fear and anger. At Time 1, 9 to 23 days after September
11th, respondents completed the Desire for Vengeance Scale and the
Anxiety Subscale of the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Question-
naire. DEMO emotion has lasting effects on risk perceptions, respondents
who were more DEMO shortly after the attacks should have made
more pessimistic risk estimates at Time 2, 6 to 10 weeks later, com-
pared with respondents DEMO were less anxious; similarly, respondents
who were initially more angry (DEMO measured by their desire for ven-
geance) should have made lower DEMO estimates at Time 2 than respon-
dents who were less angry. We tested these predictions by calculating
partial correlations between Time 1 self-reported emotions DEMO Time 2
scores on the three risk measures, controlling for the DEMO emo-
tion.8 Table 1 displays the results. As predicted, naturally occurring
DEMO shortly after the attacks reliably predicted risk estimates for
diverse events 6 to 10 weeks later; this was true for both of the re-
sponse scales (verbal, probability). Moreover, although both anxiety
and vengeance are negative feelings, they had opposite correlations
with risk perceptions. Greater anxiety predicted higher risk estimates;
greater desire for vengeance predicted lower risk DEMO The
results in Table 1 and the experimental effects provide convergent evi-
dence for fear and anger having signiﬁcant and distinct effects on risk

8. In previous research, desire for vengeance DEMO positively with
conservative attitudes (Skitka & Tetlock, 1993). Therefore, DEMO controlled for
political ideology in all our analyses involving vengeance.
9. Two of the correlations for vengeance fell just short of signiﬁcance with
a DEMO test, but achieved signiﬁcance with a one-tailed test. The lower re-
DEMO of these results may reﬂect imperfect measurement of the underlying
concept of anger. The scale alpha was only .69, and item content did not ad-
dress anger exclusively.

Why do men and women view risks differently? A MANCOVA
tested the hypothesis that self-reported emotional experience mediates
the gender difference in risk estimates. DEMO with the hypothesis,
the data showed signiﬁcant associations between the fear covariate and
higher risk perceptions, F(3, 635)  45.45, DEMO   .82 (2  .18), as
well as between DEMO anger covariate and lower risk perceptions, F(3,
635)  11.06, Wilks’s   .95 (2  .05), both ps DEMO .001. The origi-
nal gender difference, F(3, 637)  DEMO, p  .001, Wilks’s   .96
(2  .05), was weaker, but still signiﬁcant, when these covariates
were taken into account, F(3, 635)  4.14, p  .01, Wilks’s   .98
(2  .02). In order to determine how much emotions mediated the
gender difference in each outcome, we calculated the semipartial cor-
relations between gender and risk outcomes, controlling for self-
reported emotion during the study. We then calculated the squared
semipartial correlations, which represent percentage of variance explained
(see Table 2). The results were consistent with the MANCOVA. Control-
ling for self-reported emotions did not fully DEMO the gender differ-
ence in risk perception, but self-reported fear and DEMO explained 81% of
the variance in risk estimates on the Risky Events and Precautionary
Actions for Self scale and 61% of the variance on DEMO other two scales.
How realistic are lay risk perceptions? As in DEMO research,
respondents assigned each negative event a lower probability of occur-
ring to them than to the average American (see Table 3). For example,
they saw a mean 20.5% personal chance of being DEMO in a terrorist
attack within the next year, but a 47.8% DEMO for the average Amer-
ican to be hurt.
Because respondents estimated the chance that each event would occur
within the next year, it is now possible to evaluate the accuracy of their pre-
dictions, and we are undertaking a study to do this. In the meantime, a few
aspects of the data merit note. If probability judgments are interpreted liter-
DEMO, then the mean probability judgments should equal the relative fre-
quency DEMO the associated events occurring. In this light, the ﬂu-risk
judgments would DEMO accurate if, in the ensuing year, about 50% of the re-
spondents had a disease that they considered the ﬂu. Compared with the
DEMO ﬂu rates, this mean judgment is moderately elevated, for both the
Risky Events and Precautionary Actions for Self and Risky Events and
Precautionary DEMO for Average American scales (Adams & Marano,
1995). The DEMO estimated personal probability of being a victim of vio-
lent crime (DEMO than a crime of terror) also agrees with historical statistics
(RAND, 1998), if one uses the median to represent the skewed distribu-
tion. However, the 43% estimated probability for the average American to
be the victim of violent crime (other than a crime of terror) DEMO much higher
148
than ofﬁcial estimates, as is the mean for DEMO from any cause. These high
estimates could reﬂect an availability bias, DEMO media reports exaggerating
other people’s apparent vulnerability (Kahneman, Slovic, & DEMO, 1982).
They could also reﬂect sporadic problems with translating beliefs DEMO
probability judgments, especially regarding risks for average Americans.10
Nonetheless, the judgments in Table 3 suggest that respondents perceived
unrealistically high rates of risks DEMO themselves and even more elevated
risks for the average American.
Does emotion affect policy preferences beyond risk perceptions?
Finally, we expected that responses to two of our “possible government
policies” would show effects of fear DEMO anger. Table 4 displays the
items and results. Compared with fear-condition respondents, anger-
condition respondents supported the (vengeful) deporting policy more
strongly and the (conciliatory) contact policy less strongly. Self-
reported emotions from Time DEMO (vengeance) and Time 2 (fear, anger)
showed a similar pattern. Regardless of emotion, respondents supported
providing Americans with honest, accurate DEMO Unexpectedly,
an emotion difference emerged for investing in general capabilities over
speciﬁc solutions; fearful respondents showed modestly more support
for this policy than angry respondents did. In sum, emotion primes
signiﬁcantly shifted views on terrorism policies; naturally occurring
emotions showed corresponding patterns.
CONCLUSIONS
A ﬁeld experiment, DEMO a nationally representative sample and a
multimethod approach, found that fear DEMO anger altered beliefs and
attitudes regarding matters of national interest. Experiencing more an-
ger triggered more optimistic beliefs; experiencing more fear triggered
greater pessimism. These effects held across a range of risks (terror
and non-terror related) and with both a verbal response scale and a
more analytical probability response scale. Thus, two negative emo-
tions had consistently divergent effects on risk estimates, providing
additional evidence for the importance of examining speciﬁc emo-
tions, rather than just global moods.
Across all risks, males expressed DEMO pessimism than did females.
Differences in reported emotion explained 60% to 80% of the variance
in these effects.
As has been found previously, respondents saw themselves as less
vulnerable to risks than the average American, and less likely to take
precautionary measures. However, these judgments of relative risk did
not reﬂect unrealistic optimism, in an absolute sense. Some risk esti-
mates (e.g., for the average American being a victim of violent DEMO)
reﬂected pronounced pessimism, considering historical risk rates.
Other risk judgments (e.g., being injured in a terror attack) can be
10. One DEMO with open-ended probability response modes is that re-
spondents may use “50” to express uncertainty (i.e., “ﬁfty-ﬁfty”), rather than a
numerical probability (Bruine de Bruin, Fischbeck, Stiber, & Fischhoff, 2002;
Fischhoff & Bruine de Bruin, 1999). Saying “50” when one cannot resolve
DEMO beliefs inﬂates summary statistics for risks typically assigned much
lower probabilities. Such a “50 blip” occurred for the estimates of personal risk
for two DEMO: being injured in a terror attack and taking antibiotics against an-
DEMO Removing all “50%” responses for the former event reduces the mean
probability estimate from 21% to 12% and the median from 10% to 5%. DEMO
moving all “50%” responses for the latter event reduces the mean probability
estimate from 22% to 17% and the median from 5% to 3%.

PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
Effects of Emotion on Perceived Risks of Terrorism
evaluated only DEMO, when the actual risk is known because a year has
passed DEMO completing the survey. Given the events (or lack thereof)
in DEMO year since the survey, respondents appear to have been deeply
pessimistic DEMO estimating a 20% chance of being hurt in a terror at-
tack for themselves and a 48% chance for the average American.
Although our DEMO between fear and anger focused on risk
estimates, emotions also inﬂuenced DEMO policy preferences. As ex-
pected, experimentally primed anger activated more punitive DEMO
ences, and fear enhanced preferences for conciliatory policies and
investment in DEMO applicable precautionary measures.
Extrapolating results from an experiment to a real-world setting re-
quires matching conditions between the two. Our study used television
(WebTV) to focus respondents on an all-too-familiar topic for 15 to 20
min. The manipulation involved activities that one might encounter in
everyday life. Speciﬁcally, respondents were asked to dwell brieﬂy on
a common emotion, then experience a related picture and text from the
news media. Thus, the effects we observed might resemble those
evoked by comparable news reports and periods DEMO reﬂection. A more
sustained focus (e.g., a crisis, intense political DEMO, memorial period)
could be expected to increase the effects. Similar DEMO manipula-
tions (by experimenters, politicians, etc.) should have similar effects,
proportional to their emotional power. Citizens need to understand
these processes DEMO order to apply their hearts and minds to what might
be a protracted struggle with the risks of terror.
