ENTREPRENEURS’ OPTIMISM AND NEW VENTURE
PERFORMANCE: A SOCIAL COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE

Previous research DEMO that entrepreneurs are generally high in dispositional
optimism—the tendency to expect positive outcomes even when such expectations are
not rationally justified. Findings of the DEMO study demonstrate a negative relation-
ship between entrepreneurs’ optimism and the performance (revenue and employment
growth) of their new ventures. Past experience creating DEMO and industry dyna-
mism moderated these effects, strengthening the negative relationship DEMO entre-
preneurs’ optimism and venture performance. These findings illustrate the benefits of
applying a social cognitive perspective toward efforts to understand key aspects of DEMO
new venture creation and development process.
Considering the substantial impact that new ven-
tures have on economic growth within most indus-
trialized nations (Sternberg & Wennekers, 2005), it
is fortunate that entrepreneurs pursue their dreams
of developing successful new ventures despite the
great odds against them (Dosi & Lovallo, 1997). The
fact that entrepreneurs decide to forge ahead in
the face of daunting obstacles suggests that they are
high in DEMO optimism and indeed, re-
search findings indicate that entrepreneurs score
particularly DEMO on measures of this personal char-
acteristic (e.g., Abdelsamad & Kindling, 1978;
Fraser & Greene, 2006; Lowe & Ziedonis, 2006)DEMO For
example, Cooper, Woo, and Dunkelberg (1988)
found that entrepreneurs express high levels of op-
timism, regardless how prepared they are to lead
their firms. In addition, research by Busenitz and
Barney (DEMO) demonstrated that entrepreneurs
tend to overestimate the probability of being right
DEMO overgeneralize from a few characteristics or
observations significantly more so than managers
of large, established organizations. Further sup-
porting the claim that entrepreneurs tend to view
the world through “rose-colored glasses,” Simon,
Houghton, and Aquino (2000) found that entrepre-
neurs commonly overemphasize the extent to
DEMO their skills can increase performance in sit-
uations where chance plays a large role and skill is
not necessarily a deciding factor; further, DEMO tend

to use DEMO small number of information inputs as the
basis for drawing conclusions.
De Meza and Southey (1996) accounted for the
phenomenon of entrepreneurs being DEMO in opti-
mism by arguing that, because individuals starting
new businesses DEMO little evidence upon which to
base beliefs about likely success, those DEMO unre-
alistic expectations are disproportionately attracted
into entrepreneurship. This line of reasoning is
consistent with research demonstrating that highly
optimistic individuals are confident of DEMO
successful outcomes independently of being able to
visualize the path that will get them there—simply
believing that everything will work out favorably in
the DEMO (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 2001).
A key question arising from the finding that en-
trepreneurs are generally high in optimism is DEMO:
How does optimism relate to the performance of
their new ventures? Although it has been argued
that excessive optimism is a primary reason for the
high incidence of failure among start-ups (Gartner,
2005), few studies have investigated the relationship
between entrepreneurs’ optimism and the actual DEMO
formance of their new ventures. Further, existing ev-
idence suggests that DEMO levels of optimism can
negatively affect judgment and decision making
(Aspinwall, Sechrist, & Jones, 2005; Åstebro, Jef-
frey, & Adomdza, DEMO). Thus, optimism seems
likely to have important negative effects on DEMO
strategic decisions made by lead entrepreneurs and
the performance of their new ventures.
Social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) provides
a useful theoretical framework for understanding
such effects. Specifically, social cognitive theory
suggests that the effects of personal dispositions

(including optimism) are often determined DEMO their
interaction with important behavioral and environ-
mental factors (Wood & DEMO, 1989). As such,
the theory blends dispositional, behavioral, DEMO en-
vironmental perspectives, thus providing a more
comprehensive framework for examining DEMO
action and its outcomes than could be gained by
focusing on any of these levels and classes of vari-
ables independently. In this regard, social cognitive
theory provides a useful framework for undertaking
the task of DEMO the mechanisms through
which individual dispositions ultimately influence
firm-level performance—a task that has been iden-
tified as crucial in recent years by many researchers
(e.g., Baron, 2007; Wright, Hmieleski, Siegel, & En-
sley, 2007).
The basic proposals of social cognitive theory are
also consistent DEMO the multilevel perspective
highlighted by Hitt, Beamish, Jackson, and Mathieu
(2007). This perspective suggests that in order to
fully understand complex DEMO processes
(including new venture development), it is essential
to examine DEMO operating at different levels of
analysis (e.g., individual, group, subunit, organiza-
tional, interorganizational, and environmental). In
the current study we adopt this perspective by
examining the joint effects of two individual vari-
DEMO optimism and their previous
experience in starting new ventures—and a key en-
vironmental variable: dynamism. Resting firmly
both on social cognitive theory and a multilevel
perspective, the current research was designed to
make several contributions. First, most empirical
research examining the effects of optimism is based
on the results of investigations conducted with var-
ious types of samples (e.g., DEMO students, factory
workers). Although such samples offer important
advantages, they do not provide information per-
taining to effects that may occur at DEMO levels of
this dimension. Thus, they do not relate directly to
DEMO, who have been found to score very
high on measures of DEMO (e.g., Fraser &
Greene, 2006; Lowe & Ziedonis, 2006). As we de-
scribe in more detail in the following section, very
high levels of optimism are likely to produce dif-
ferent effects DEMO moderate levels and—more im-
portantly—there are strong theoretical grounds for
predicting that these effects will vary considerably
in different environments (for example, environ-
DEMO that are low or high in dynamism). Thus, the
present DEMO provides new evidence concern-
ing the role of optimism in new venture develop-
ment and growth, processes that occur in a very
wide range of environments.
Second, in examining the effects of optimism, we
adopt DEMO perspective suggested both by social cogni-
tive theory and the emerging multilevel perspective
in management research (Barden & Mitchell, 2007;
Hitt et DEMO, 2007). Specifically, we recognize that the
effects of individual-level variables occur primarily
through interactions with key environmental fac-
tors. Prior research in DEMO the fields of entrepre-
neurship (Shaver & Scott, 1991) and DEMO
behavior (House, Shane, & Herold, 1996) has long
been DEMO for failing to adopt such an ap-
proach. In response to such critiques, in the current
study we employed social cognitive theory, which
DEMO the reciprocal relationships between
dispositional, behavioral, and environmental vari-
ables, DEMO the basis for deriving predictions concern-
ing the mechanisms through which dispositional
optimism influences the performance of key organ-
izational decision makers (in this case, lead founders
of new ventures).
Third, following the spirit DEMO Hambrick’s (2007)
assertion that organizational researchers must
balance theoretical with DEMO implications,
this study also addresses an issue we consider to
be of great importance: How best to coach or train
entrepreneurs so that they both recognize their
own tendencies to have high levels of optimism,DEMO
and are maximally able to convert these tenden-
cies into personal strengths that help them to
found, lead, and grow their new businesses. DEMO
findings are likely to contribute to the literature
linking the characteristics of top management to
firm performance. For example, much has been
written within this literature about the negative
effects of hubris (Hayward & Hambrick, DEMO;
Hayward, Shepherd, & Griffin, 2006; Hiller &
Hambrick, 2005), which is a form of overconfi-
dence and a potential DEMO of extreme
optimism. However, to date, little empirical re-
search has been conducted to examine theoretical
arguments on this topic. Our results contribute DEMO
this body of work by evaluating when such neg-
ative effects are most likely to occur (that is, at
varying levels of experience DEMO dynamism).
THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
We begin this section by examining the potential
benefits and costs of entrepreneurial optimism.
Then, following suggestions derived from the so-
cial cognitive theory framework, we explore the
potentially moderating effects of key behavioral
(i.e., entrepreneurial experience) and environmen-
tal (i.e., environmental dynamism) variables with
respect to dispositional optimism.

Entrepreneurs’ Optimism
Given the pervasiveness of optimism DEMO en-
trepreneurs, we focus on dispositional optimism,
defined as generalized DEMO for experienc-
ing positive outcomes (Scheier et al., 2001). Re-
search has demonstrated that optimism tends to
remain relatively stable for individuals DEMO time,
situation, and context (Schulman, Keith, & Seligman,
1993). Individuals high in optimism exhibit confi-
dence in a way DEMO is both broad and diffuse, and it
encourages them to approach DEMO with enthu-
siasm and persistence (Carver & Scheier, 2003). Re-
search findings indicate that as a result, individuals
high in optimism tend to experience better physical
and psychological well-being than individuals low in
optimism (Peterson & Bossio, 2001).
Additional findings, however, have underscored
the fact that high levels of optimism can be linked
to negative outcomes. DEMO optimistic individu-
als often hold unrealistic expectations, discount
negative information, and mentally reconstruct ex-
periences so as to avoid contradictions (Geers &
DEMO, 2002). In contrast, individuals who are
moderate in optimism tend to possess a more bal-
anced view (Spencer & Norem, 1996)DEMO They are
more sensitive to negative information and less
likely to gloss over discrepancies (Spirrison &
Gordy, 1993), less easily persuaded by positive in-
formation (Geers, Handley, & McLarney, 2003), and
DEMO likely to have an attentional bias in favor of
positive stimuli (DEMO, 2001), and they hold
more realistic expectations when engaging in DEMO
risk situations than those higher in optimism (Gib-
son & Sanbonmatsu, 2004). For these reasons, re-
search findings have suggested, overall, that high
levels of optimism often have significant detrimen-
tal effects on DEMO judgment and decision making of
individuals. Considering the consistency of such
findings in the extant literature, it seems likely that
highly optimistic entrepreneurs may be prone to
make less than optimal strategic decisions.
Also of particular DEMO to entrepreneurs,
positive expectations often lead to goal conflict, in
DEMO optimists tend to see new opportunities every-
where they look (Segerstrom & Solberg Nes, 2006).
This tendency can generate significant problems
for DEMO who cannot easily decide which
goals to pursue and therefore may become seriously
overextended as they seek to exploit more oppor-
tunities than is DEMO feasible. In contrast,
moderate optimists tend to be more realistic in
their choice and pursuit of opportunities. This
moderation is important because entrepreneurs
DEMO be able to decide which goals they can real-
istically accomplish early in the development of
their new ventures in order to maximize the DEMO
tial for survival and long-term success (McMullen
& Shepherd, 2006).
In general, research findings indicate that on a
wide range of activities and tasks, optimism has a
curvilinear relationship with performance (Brown
& DEMO, 2001). Individuals who are very low in
optimism tend to DEMO motivation because they as-
sume that no matter how hard they try, failure is
likely to result. In addition, they have a propensity
DEMO focus on negative information, which reinforces
their view that disaster awaits DEMO For these rea-
sons, they often attain relatively low levels of DEMO
formance. Moderate optimists tend to set moder-
ately high, yet realistic, goals and put forth the
necessary effort to reach their goals. These DEMO
uals recognize a balance of positive and negative
cues within their environment, noting both the po-
tential benefits and risks associated with each de-
cision alternative. This more balanced approach
tends to make them above-average performers. DEMO
tremely optimistic individuals, in contrast, tend to
set unrealistically high goals and are overconfident
that their goals will be attained. Further, they focus
primarily on positive information, which supports
their belief that success is likely. These tendencies
often interfere with effective performance. As a re-
sult, they tend to attain only average levels of per-
formance in many contexts (Judge & Ilies, 2004).
Taken together, existing evidence suggests that
DEMO many different tasks, performance increases
with task performers’ optimism, but only up to a
point; beyond this point, further increments in op-
DEMO actually generate reductions in perfor-
mance (Brown & Marshall, 2001). When this curvi-
linear relationship between optimism and per-
formance observed in DEMO general population is
extended to entrepreneurs, an intriguing—and
counterintuitive—prediction emerges. Although
DEMO is positively related to optimism in
the general population, this relationship DEMO well
tend to be negative for entrepreneurs, since they
range from DEMO high to extremely high on
the optimism dimension (Abdelsamad & Kindling,DEMO
1978; Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Cooper at al., 1988;
Dosi & Lovallo, 1997; Fraser & Greene, 2006;
Lovallo & Kahneman, 2003; Lowe & Ziedonis, 2006;
Simon et al., DEMO). Thus, they fall into the portion
of the optimism-performance function DEMO the
inflection point (i.e., the downward-trending por-
tion). Following this logic and also reflecting pre-
viously discussed research regarding the negative
effects DEMO optimism on judgment and decision mak-
ing (e.g., Geers et al., 2003; Gibson & Sanbonmatsu;
2004; Judge & Ilies, 2004; Segerstrom, 2001; Seger-
476
strom & Solberg Nes, 2006; Spirrison & Gordy,
1993), we propose the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. Entrepreneurs’ level of disposi-
tional optimism is negatively related to the per-
formance of their new DEMO
Moderating Effects of Entrepreneurial Experience
The form of experience the entrepreneurship lit-
erature most commonly refers to is experience ac-
quired through having started DEMO new ven-
tures (Wright, Westhead, & Sohl, 1998). Individuals
possessing such experience are often described as
habitual or repeat entrepreneurs. This DEMO of ex-
perience typically offers benefits in terms of devel-
oping contacts (Danson, 1999), gaining knowledge
about obtaining the most appropriate sources DEMO fi-
nancing (Starr & Bygrave, 1991), learning the mana-
gerial and technical skills necessary for leading new
ventures (Wright et al., DEMO), and identifying how to
serve new and emerging market segments (DEMO,
Robbie, & Ennew, 1997). Entrepreneurial experience
is also a primary mode for increasing one’s entrepre-
neurial self-efficacy, because it provides opportuni-
ties for “enactive mastery” and role modeling (Zhao,
Seibert, & DEMO, 2005).
At first glance, one might assume that experience
would help to temper or counterbalance entrepre-
neurs’ high levels of optimism (Hayward, Shep-
herd, & Griffin, 2006). However, the fact that
DEMO are, on average, relatively high in
optimism calls attention to two relevant points.
First, highly optimistic individuals tend to suffer
from a “confirmation bias” (Klayman & Ha, 1987),
focusing on information that supports or validates
their current beliefs while largely ignoring informa-
tion that is DEMO consistent with these beliefs (Gibson
& Sanbonmatsu, 2004). Thus, DEMO though experi-
enced entrepreneurs have more highly developed
frameworks for processing a wide range of informa-
tion than less experienced entrepreneurs (e.g.,
Baron & Ensley, 2006), those who are high in opti-
mism are likely to focus most on confirming infor-
mation. This, in turn, DEMO result in overconfidence
on the part of experienced, highly optimistic entre-
DEMO tendency that, as Hayward and col-
leagues (2006) noted, may negatively affect the per-
formance and survival of new ventures. Second,
DEMO entrepreneurs tend to have more op-
portunities available to them via their more extensive
entrepreneurial networks and also possess richer cog-
nitive frameworks for DEMO such opportunities
than do novices (Ozgen & Baron, 2007). One result of
such an abundance of opportunities, especially for
highly optimistic entrepreneurs, may be competing

demands on their information-processing capacity—
a kind of “opportunity overload.” Since highly opti-
mistic entrepreneurs tend DEMO expect positive out-
comes in many situations, such opportunity overload
may DEMO experienced, highly optimistic entre-
preneurs to pursue more opportunities than they DEMO
realistically manage. This tendency, in turn, has been
shown in previous research to be a major problem for
entrepreneurs, one that interferes with their ability to
build sustainable growth for their new ventures
(Baker & Nelson, 2005). On the basis of these consid-
erations and in the context of social cognitive theory,
we propose the following hypothesis:DEMO
Hypothesis 2. Entrepreneurial experience in
starting new ventures moderates the relation-
ship between the level of entrepreneurs’ dispo-
sitional optimism and the performance of DEMO
new ventures: the relationship is more negative
for those with high, as opposed to low, entre-
preneurial experience.
Moderating Effects of Environmental Dynamism
Dynamic environments are characterized by un-
predictable and rapid change, which increases un-
certainty for individuals and firms operating
within them (Dess & Beard, 1984). It has been sug-
gested that environmental dynamism forms a fertile
context in which entrepreneurial opportunities
arise (Hayek, 1945; Kirzner, DEMO; Shane & Venkat-
araman, 2000). Such environments, however, also
present major challenges. Because of high levels of
uncertainty and the large DEMO of financial cap-
ital (and associated risk) needed to compete (DEMO
drich, 2000), entrepreneurs leading their firms in
dynamic environments often DEMO unusually heavy
information processing burdens (Chandler, Honig,
& Wiklund, DEMO). As a result, they may also expe-
rience high levels DEMO distress and anxiety (Mark-
man, Baron, & Balkin, 2005). Optimism can help to
reduce such effects (Luthans & Youssef, 2004) but
can also lead to overconfidence or other cognitive
errors (Hayward et al., 2006) and hence, can nega-
tively affect judgment and decision making (Mc-
Kenzie, 1997), especially within dynamic environ-
ments (Klayman, Soll, Gonzalez-Vallejo, & Barlas,
1999). Therefore, we suggest DEMO highly optimistic
entrepreneurs will be particularly poor at leading
their new ventures in dynamic, as opposed to sta-
ble, industry environments, because their attention
will lack the focus needed to respond quickly and
effectively to DEMO opportunities. Further, their
discounting of negative information could be par-
ticularly DEMO if it prevents them from making
the strategic changes necessary to respond effec-

tively to competitors. For example, according to
uncertainty reduction theory, highly optimistic in-
dividuals will attune to the aspects of the environ-
ment that align most closely with their past expe-
DEMO to make sense of the uncertainty present
in dynamic environments (Berger & Gudykunst,
1991). Considering that optimistic individuals tend
to view both their past and future through rose-
colored glasses, they are likely to selectively map
an unbalanced mix of mostly positive information
from their past DEMO a present situation and thus
make less than optimal decisions. In further sup-
port of this line of reasoning, optimism has been
found to be negatively related to situational aware-
ness, in such a way that highly optimistic persons
tend to be fairly ineffective at perceiving elements of
DEMO environment, comprehending their meaning,
and projecting their status into the DEMO future
(Eid, Matthews, Meland, & Johnsen, 2005). Consider-
DEMO the importance of rapidly identifying and inte-
grating key information when making strategic deci-
sions in fast-changing environments (Eisenhardt,
1989), highly optimistic entrepreneurs would appear
to be at a particular disadvantage in leading new
DEMO in dynamic, as opposed to stable, industry
environments. On the basis of this reasoning and
again, in keeping with a general social cognitive per-
spective, we offer the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3. Environmental dynamism mod-
erates the relationship between the level of en-
trepreneurs’ dispositional optimism DEMO the
performance of their new ventures: the rela-
tionship is more DEMO for those leading
their firms within dynamic, as opposed to sta-
DEMO, industry environments.
METHODS
Sample and Procedure
A national random sample of DEMO,000 new ventures
was drawn from Dun & Bradstreet for use in the
current study. Dun & Bradstreet compiles what is
considered to be DEMO most exhaustive database of
young firms founded in the United States (DEMO
berg, Marsden, Aldrich, & Cassell, 1990). The vast
majority of new ventures within the United States
must file for a DUNS DEMO with Dun and Brad-
street to create a business credit record, DEMO is a
primary way that companies evaluate whether to
do business with each other (for instance, whether
to sell, lend money, partner, or lease equipment).
Dun & Bradstreet provided the names and address
DEMO the firms and their top management team leaders
(i.e., chief executive officers), who in each case was
also a firm founder.
A DEMO containing our survey, along with a
cover letter and prepaid business DEMO envelope,
was sent to the participants. In total, 185 of DEMO
mailings were returned as nondeliverable, and 207
completed surveys were returned. DEMO number of
nondeliverable survey mailings was not surprising
considering that Dun & Bradstreet reports that 20
percents of the firms that they track change DEMO
address each year. Removal of six cases because of
incomplete performance data resulted in a total us-
able response rate of 24.8 percent, which is in align-
ment with those produced by other studies using
similar DEMO of top management (e.g., Hmieleski &
Ensley, 2007; Waldman, Ramirez, House, & Puranam,
2001). We examined nonresponse bias DEMO t-tests
on top management team leader’s gender and firm
age, revenue, number of employees, and growth. In
each case the results were nonsignificant.
Demographic questions at the end of the admin-
istered survey confirmed that DEMO respondent was
a founder and the top management team leader of
his/her firm. These participants included 163
males and 38 females, with an average age of 52
years. The highest educational degrees earned by
participants DEMO high school (n  37), associ-
ate’s (n  18), bachelor’s (n  80), master’s (n 
47), DEMO doctoral (n  19). The mean age of the
firms DEMO was 5.74 years, which is in alignment
with research arguing that DEMO are in a critical
developmental stage during their first 6 years of
existence and may be considered new ventures
during this period (Shrader, DEMO, & McDougall,
2000). Further, the first 6 years is a particularly
relevant time period in the development of a firm
within DEMO to consider objective performance
outcomes such as revenue and employment
growth, DEMO earlier on in the firm’s develop-
ment such factors may be less relevant.
Finally, the sample was broad in scope; partici-
pants’ current DEMO were located in 40 different
states and had primary operations in 114 different
industries (as classified by four-digit Standard Indus-
trial Classification codes). Further, no more than four
firms were from the same state, DEMO no more than
three firms were from the same industry. Thus, DEMO
national sample is not biased by industry or geo-
graphic location.
Measures
Optimism. Optimism was measured using
Scheier et al.’s (1994) six-item Life DEMO
Test–Revised (LOT-R). Example items include, “In
uncertain times, I DEMO expect the best” and
“Overall, I expect more good things to DEMO to
me than bad” (1, “strongly disagree,” to 7, DEMO
478

agree”). We summed responses into DEMO overall
score; high scores indicated a generalized feeling of
optimism about DEMO future, and low scores indi-
cated a more pessimistic outlook. To DEMO the
test-retest reliability of the LOT-R, Scheier and col-
leagues (1994) examined scores for four different
groups of individuals who completed the scale at
various time intervals. The test-retest intervals
were 4, 12, 24, and 28 months. The test-retest cor-
relations were .68, .60, .56, and .79, respectively.
Therefore, as expected for a dispositional measure,
DEMO LOT-R appears to be fairly stable over time.
Finally, the measure DEMO a Cronbach’s coeffi-
cient alpha of .80 in the current study.
Entrepreneurial experience. Following prior re-
search, we measured entrepreneurial experience as
the number of previous ventures founded (Stuart &
Abetti, 1990). Specifically, DEMO single survey item
asked respondents to report “the number of new
ventures started prior to the founding of your cur-
rent business.” Responses ranged DEMO 0 to 6, with
nearly half of the respondents (n  91) having
previously founded a business. Whereas other
studies have dummy-coded the previous founding
of new ventures dichotomously as 0 or 1 (e.g., DEMO
per, Folta, & Woo, 1995; Forbes, 2005), we DEMO the
actual number of new ventures started as our study
variable. This approach was taken because some
additional learning should take place each time DEMO
entrepreneur starts another new venture (Zhao et
al., 2005). In other words, knowledge of the entre-
preneurial process should increase each time that
an individual proceeds through founding an addi-
tional new venture (Wright et al., 1998).
Environmental dynamism. We measured indus-
try-level rate of unpredicted change as the standard
errors of four regression slopes, following the work
of Dess and Beard (1984), Keats and Hitt (1988),
Sharfman and Dean (1991), and Castrogiovanni
(2002). In DEMO case the independent variable was
time. The dependent variables were industry reve-
nues, number of industry establishments, number
of industry employees, and research and develop-
ment intensity. Industry revenue has been used as a
measure DEMO uncertainty in prior studies (e.g., Keats
& Hitt, 1988; Sharfman & Dean, 1991), and number
of employees is a common measure of change for
use in research involving new businesses. The
number of DEMO has been used by Aldrich
(1979) as the basis for understanding industry size
and the extent of industry change. Finally, indus-
trywide research and development intensity is a
variable that captures the speed of the DEMO
cal evolution of an industry (Castrogiovanni, 2002;
Dess & Beard, 1984).
Data on industry revenues, industry establish-
ment, and industry employment totals were ac-
quired through the U.S. Bureau of the Census. DEMO
search and development intensity data were
acquired from the U.S. Patent Office. Following
Sharfman and Dean (1991), we regressed time
against these variables for the most recent ten-year
period. An index of the standard errors DEMO the re-
gression slopes divided by their respective means
was used the indicator of unpredicted change for
each of the four variables. These figures DEMO then
standardized and summed into an overall index of
environmental dynamism. To evaluate the extent to
which the four variables loaded onto a single DEMO
mension, we conducted a single-factor confirma-
tory analysis using AMOS 6.0. DEMO chi-square for
the model was nonsignificant (2  2.35, p  .13)
and results from absolute fit (GFI  .99; SRMR DEMO
.04) and relative fit (CFI  .98) indexes each dem-
DEMO good fit. The standardized factor loadings
ranged from .68 to .86. Further supporting the reli-
ability of the measure, the overall index produced a
Cronbach’s coefficient alpha of .69.
New venture performance. Growth is often
cited DEMO the most important performance indicator
of new venture success (Brush & DEMO, 1992;
Danson, 1999). In keeping with this literature, DEMO
used two different objective measures of growth:
revenue growth and employment growth. The per-
formance data were obtained from Dun & Brad-
street. DEMO studies have validated the accuracy
of Dun & Bradstreet revenue and employment data
for new ventures (e.g., Baum & Locke, 2004; Baum,DEMO
Locke, & Smith, 2001). The performance measures
were calculated as the average annual revenue and
employment growth over the two years immedi-
DEMO following the collection of the survey data.
We used lagged performance data in order to en-
hance our ability to draw causal inferences from
DEMO results.
Control variables. Firm-level control variables
included the age of a firm, its revenue and employ-
ment totals for the year in which the survey data
were collected, and the average revenue and em-
ployment growth rates for the three years prior to
collection of survey data. Data DEMO each of these
variables were acquired from Dun & Bradstreet. To
reduce the threat of multicollinearity, we standard-
ized and summed revenue and employment totals
for the year in which the survey data were collected
to DEMO a variable labeled “firm size.” For the
same reason, the average DEMO and employment
growth rates for the three years before collection of
our survey data were standardized and summed to
create a variable labeled “prior DEMO growth.” Indi-
vidual control variables included the sex (“male” 
0, “female”  1), age (in years), and educational

attainment (1  “high school,” 2  “associate’s
degree,” 3  “bachelor’s degree,” 4  “master’s
DEMO,” 5  “doctoral degree”) of respondents.
These data were collected DEMO demographic items at
the end of the administered survey.
Statistical Procedures
Moderated hierarchical regression analysis was
utilized as the main statistical procedure for exam-
DEMO the relationship between entrepreneurs’ opti-
mism and new venture performance, as DEMO as the
proposed moderating effects of entrepreneurial ex-
perience and environmental dynamism. We mean-

RESULTS
Table 1 provides the means, standard deviations,
and bivariate DEMO for study variables. Table
2 provides the results of the hierarchical regression
models for revenue and employment growth. The
interactions are graphed in Figures DEMO We describe
results in relation to the individual hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1 proposed that entrepreneurs’ level
of dispositional optimism is negatively related to
the performance DEMO their new ventures. As shown
in models 2 and 6 of Table 2, the relationships
between entrepreneurs’ optimism and the revenue
growth (.17, p  .05) and employment growth
( .20, p  .01) of their new ventures are both
significant and negative. Therefore, the DEMO
offer support for Hypothesis 1.
Hypothesis 2 suggested that entrepreneurial ex-
perience in starting new ventures moderates the
relationship between the level of entrepreneurs’
DEMO optimism and the performance of
their new ventures, such that the DEMO will
be stronger (i.e., more negative) for those with high,DEMO
as opposed to low, entrepreneurial experience. As
shown in models 3 DEMO 7 of Table 2, the interaction
of entrepreneurial experience with optimism DEMO
significant and negative for both revenue growth
( .15, p  .05) and employment growth (
.22, p  .01). The graph of this interaction (Figure
1) shows that the relationship between DEMO
neurs’ optimism and the performance of their new
ventures is more negative for those with high, as
opposed to low, entrepreneurial experience. In DEMO,
there appears to be no relationship between opti-
mism and new venture performance for those with
low entrepreneurial experience. Therefore, results
support Hypothesis 2.
Hypothesis 3 stated that environmental dyna-
mism moderates the relationship between DEMO level
of entrepreneurs’ dispositional optimism and the
performance of their new ventures, with the rela-
tionship being stronger (i.e., more negative) for
DEMO leading their firms in dynamic rather than in
stable industry environments. As shown in models
3 and 7 of Table 2, the interaction of environmental
dynamism with optimism is significant and nega-
tive for both revenue DEMO ( .33, p  .01)
and employment growth ( DEMO, p  .01). The
graph of this interaction (Figure 2) shows that the
relationship between entrepreneurs’ optimism and
the performance of their new ventures is more neg-
ative for those leading their firms in DEMO, as
opposed to stable, industry environments. There-
fore, Hypothesis 3 DEMO, receives support.
In addition to influencing the relationship be-
tween entrepreneurs’ DEMO and new venture
performance individually, the social cognitive per-
spective suggests DEMO environmental dynamism

Entrepreneurs’ Optimism and Firm Performance:
DEMO the Relationship Always Negative?
Overall, the findings of the present DEMO sug-
gest that entrepreneurs’ dispositional optimism is
negatively related to firm performance. As noted
earlier, there are strong grounds for predicting such
a relationship. Highly optimistic individuals often
hold unrealistic expectations, suffer from overcon-
fidence, DEMO discount negative information—ten-
dencies that can seriously interfere with their de-
cision making and judgment (Geers & Lassiter,
2002; Segerstrom & Solberg DEMO, 2006). The present
results indicate that such effects may indeed DEMO
ate among entrepreneurs and combine to exert a
negative influence on new venture performance.
It is important to note, however, that other evi-
DEMO suggests that high levels of optimism some-
times yield important benefits. These include en-
hanced ability to form coalitions and lasting

DEMO (Fredrickson, 2001), increased resis-
tance to prolonged, intense stress (Tugade &
Fredrickson, 2004), greater persistence in the face
of DEMO (Markman et al., 2005), and enhanced
ability to develop extensive social networks (Greve
& Salaff, 2003). Several of these skills DEMO capaci-
ties— especially the ability to develop extensive
social networks— have been shown to be important
predictors of entrepreneurial performance (e.g., Oz-
gen & Baron, 2007). Thus, although the present
findings clearly indicate a negative relationship be-
tween entrepreneurs’ optimism and new venture
performance, it seems premature to conclude that
the relationship between these variables is always,
DEMO uniformly, negative. In fact, two points suggest
that the relationship between these variables may
be complex and possibly, curvilinear.
First, entrepreneurs in DEMO, and certainly the
entrepreneurs who participated in the present
study, tend to be very high in optimism (e.g., Ab-
delsamad & Kindling, 1978; Busenitz & Barney,
1997; Cooper at al., 1988; DEMO & Lovallo, 1997;
Fraser & Greene, 2006; Lovallo & DEMO, 2003;
Lowe & Ziedonis, 2006; Simon et al., 2000). In fact,
the entrepreneurs in the current sample scored very
DEMO on the measure of optimism we employed
(mean  5.87)— DEMO, in fact, than participants
drawn from a wide range of different populations
in previous research who completed the same mea-
sure (e.g., DEMO, 2006; Aspinwall et
al., 2005). Second, the findings of many previous
studies indicate that the relationship between op-
timism and individual DEMO is curvilinear
in a wide variety of tasks and populations (e.g.,DEMO
Brown & Marshall, 2001). Performance initially
rises as optimism increases, but beyond some
point, further increments in optimism are associ-
ated with actual decrements in performance. Tak-
ing these two facts into account, we suggest that the
same principle may operate with respect to entre-
preneurs. DEMO relationship between optimism and
new venture performance may be positive up to
moderate levels of optimism, but beyond this point,
may become negative. This reversal may occur be-
cause when optimism reaches very high levels,DEMO
entrepreneurs may fail to assess potential oppor-
tunities carefully, show a DEMO preference for
heuristic decision making (a procedure that is often
ineffective DEMO dynamic environments [Sarma´ny,
1992]), and come to experience high levels of over-
confidence. As Hayward et al. (2006) noted, this
latter factor, in particular, may adversely affect new
venture performance. Although it DEMO always diffi-
cult (and fraught with uncertainty) to move from
measures of individual performance to measures of
firm performance, we tentatively suggest that very
high optimism encourages tendencies among entre-
preneurs (e.g., overconfidence) that interfere with
their performance of key tasks (e.g., full assessment
of DEMO opportunities) and hence, adversely
affects the success of their new ventures.
Only future research can fully examine these and
related possibilities. However, the present findings
do suggest quite clearly that among entrepreneurs,
2009
the potential costs of high optimism may often out-
weigh any DEMO benefits of such a disposition.
Put in other terms, very high DEMO of optimism
may indeed constitute too much of a good thing
where entrepreneurs are concerned and may adversely
influence the performance of their new DEMO
The Effects of Entrepreneurial Experience and
Environmental Dynamism
The link between entrepreneurial experience and
new venture performance is an intuitive connec-
tion and one DEMO has been frequently assumed to be
positive (Wright et al., 1998). Empirical evidence
concerning this relationship has, however, gener-
ally been DEMO than robust (Carter & Ram, 2003). The
lack of significant findings regarding this relation-
ship in past research may be due, in part, to the fact
that entrepreneurs differ greatly in terms of the
degree to which they learn from their experience,
and optimism may DEMO the efficiency of such
learning. For example, entrepreneurs who are
highly DEMO are likely to learn less from their
experience than ones who are moderate in opti-
mism, given the tendency of the first group to focus
primarily on positive, belief-confirming informa-
tion. This line of reasoning is supported by previ-
ous research examining the important role that en-
trepreneurs’ DEMO frameworks play in their
ability to transform information from their past
experience into knowledge that helps them to
identify and exploit entrepreneurial opportunities
(Corbett, 2005, 2007). Considering that highly opti-
mistic entrepreneurs are cognitively DEMO to
undervalue new or dissenting information, they are
likely to learn DEMO from their past experience than
more moderately optimistic entrepreneurs. This
may partly explain why we found entrepreneurial
experience to exacerbate the negative relationship
between DEMO and new venture performance—
suggesting that entrepreneurs who are moderate
optimists might be more effective at learning from
their past experiences than those who DEMO very high
in optimism.
Similarly, although some have suggested a posi-
DEMO link between environmental dynamism and
new venture performance (Kirzner, 1997), there is
relatively little empirical support for such a rela-
tionship. Even DEMO the potential for achieving
major success may be greater in dynamic industries
than in stable ones, the chance of failure is also
greater (DEMO & Geroski, 2004). Thus, the ef-
fects of the few who succeed may be offset by a
considerably greater number of relatively DEMO per-
formers. In contrast, within stable environments
there is a better DEMO of long-term survival, but
Hmieleski and Baron
483
less opportunity for DEMO gains. As our re-
sults show, certain dispositional and behavioral
characteristics (for example, moderate optimism
coupled with high entrepreneurial experience) may
increase DEMO odds of entrepreneurs successfully
leading their new ventures within dynamic indus-
try environments.
In sum, we believe that the design of our study,
which applies social cognitive theory to entrepre-
neurship and adopts the contextual DEMO
recommended by Hitt et al. (2007), helps shed new
light DEMO why extant research has not clearly and
definitively verified intuitively appealing relation-
ships between entrepreneurial experience and en-
vironmental dynamism on the one hand, and new
venture performance on the other. We suggest that
this lacuna DEMO primarily because these linkages
are more complex than previously believed and
are, in fact, contingent on moderating factors (such
as the ones examined in the current study).
Implications for Entrepreneurship Educators
and Practitioners
The DEMO of the current study offer support for
Lovallo and Kahneman’s suggestion that “there
needs to be a balance between optimism and real-
ism— between DEMO and forecasting. Aggressive
goals can motivate the troops and improve the
chances for success, but outside-view forecasts
should be used to decide whether or not to make a
commitment in the first place” (2003: 63)DEMO A natural
conclusion would be to suggest that lead entrepre-
neurs, DEMO are by nature often highly optimistic,
may benefit from adding top management team
members who are more moderate in optimism than
themselves (Hayward et al., 2006). This is, how-
ever, more easily said than done. Decades of re-
search in several fields clearly demonstrate that
DEMO is a powerful determinant of liking and
forming positive personal relationships (DEMO,
Baron, Branscombe, & Byrne, 2008). Accordingly,
optimistic DEMO prefer to work with individuals
similar to themselves on this dimension (DEMO &
Hambrick, 2005). Moreover, if the members of top
DEMO teams differ considerably in terms of
optimism, this situation can generate DEMO and
dysfunctional management. We suggest, therefore,
that a more effective DEMO may be to train
entrepreneurs to self-regulate their optimism in
ways that permit them to be realistic as well as
positive—to recognize when they DEMO to constrain
their enthusiasm and when they can move more
energetically. In other words, the development
of appropriate metacognitive and self-regulatory
mechanisms may be crucial, for it may be those

entrepreneurs who are best able to DEMO and
direct their own intrinsic optimism who are most
likely to achieve the success that they seek. In so
doing, entrepreneurs should pay particular atten-
tion to how their inherent levels of optimism inter-
act with DEMO experience and environment to influ-
ence their ability to achieve successful outcomes.
Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research
Several limitations to the current study DEMO
opportunities for future research. First, although
our findings uncovered contextual differences DEMO
the relationship between optimism and new ven-
ture performance, we did DEMO examine the under-
lying mechanisms through which such effects oc-
curred. Therefore, future research might address,
for example, the use of heuristic DEMO systematic
decision-making processes by entrepreneurs as
pathways mediating such effects. Because high lev-
els of optimism tend to be related to heuristic de-
cision DEMO and lower levels of optimism tend to
be related to systematic decision making (Scheier et
al., 2001), and because repeat entrepreneurs tend DEMO
rely more heavily on intuitive modes of thinking
than novice entrepreneurs (DEMO, De Castro, &
Shepherd, 2007; Buttner & Gryskiewicz, 1993), this
may prove to be a particularly fruitful extension to
the DEMO study. Further, additional behavioral
factors, such as improvisation (Hmieleski & DEMO
bett, 2006), and other environmental factors, such
as munificence (DEMO, Sharfman & Dean, 1991), may
be worth investigating in combination with the ef-
fects of optimism.
Second, previous studies of entrepreneurs have
failed to identify significant linkages between per-
formance and personal satisfaction (e.g., Brigham et
al., 2007; Hmieleski & Corbett, 2008). Identifying
DEMO links would be particularly relevant for stud-
ies of entrepreneurs’ optimism, DEMO optimism
has generally been found to be positively related to
work satisfaction (Youseff & Luthans, 2007); but as
the present results show, it appears to be negatively
linked to performance among entrepreneurs. Fu-
ture DEMO of entrepreneurs’ optimism might em-
brace efforts to evaluate what configurations of op-
timism with other behavioral and environmental
factors simultaneously maximize both performance
DEMO satisfaction.
Third, the specific nature of our sample (entre-
preneurs leading new ventures) limits the extent to
which our findings can be generalized to other
groups of individuals and organizations. As noted
earlier, entrepreneurs tend to range from moderate
to very high in optimism (Abdelsamad & Kindling,
1978; Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Cooper et al., 1988;DEMO
de Meza & Southey, 1996; Fraser & Greene, 2006;
DEMO & Ziedonis, 2006; Simon et al., 2000). There-
fore, our results are not informative about popula-
tions in which optimism is DEMO lower.
Although we have no strong reason to assume that
similar findings would not occur for leaders in
other types of firms who are DEMO to highly
optimistic, research has shown that the optimal
characteristics of DEMO vary with a firm’s evolu-
tionary stage (Smith & Miner, 1983). For example,
high optimism might be more beneficial than mod-
DEMO optimism during the idea generation stage of
the new venture creation process. Therefore, it
seems important to examine the relationships ex-
plored in the current study longitudinally over var-
ious stages in the organizational life cycle. DEMO
ing this approach might necessitate adoption of
other performance measures that are more applica-
ble to a given type of firm and a given DEMO of firm
development. Such research should, insofar as pos-
sible, track the development of firms from their
initial founding so as to avoid DEMO bias.
Finally, the cross-sectional design of the current
study limits our DEMO to make causal inferences
about the observed relationships. The fact that our
performance data were lagged from the time period
in which the data DEMO the independent variables
were collected does support our case for causality.
Such arguments would, however, be made stronger
in future studies if both DEMO independent and out-
come variables were measured on multiple occa-
sions over time. Such multiple measurement
would also allow for a more comprehensive test DEMO
social cognitive theory by presenting the opportu-
nity to examine the bidirectional relationships be-
tween the variables studied.
Conclusions
Early investigation of the potential DEMO of entre-
preneurs’ personal dispositions in new venture cre-
ation and development failed to provide clear or
consistent findings (Gartner, 1989). Many DEMO
contributed to these disappointing results, includ-
ing inadequate operationalization and measure-
DEMO of variables, lack of attention to relevant the-
oretical frameworks, and relatively little focus on
the crucial task of linking these microlevel vari-
DEMO to overt actions by entrepreneurs or to firm
performance (Low & DEMO, 1988). In contrast,
more recent research focusing on the DEMO char-
acteristics of entrepreneurs (or, more broadly
speaking, individual-level variables DEMO as the
skills, motives, experience, attitudes, and other
characteristics of individual entrepreneurs) has
been based on well-established theoretical frame-
2009

works and employed carefully chosen measures
and DEMO research designs (e.g., Baum et al.,
2001; Hmieleski & DEMO, 2008; Zhao et al., 2005).
The resulting findings provide DEMO that sev-
eral individual-level variables do indeed matter:
they are significantly related to new venture per-
formance (e.g., Baron, 2007, 2008)DEMO Despite these
advances, however, the amount of variance in new
venture performance explained by such variables
has continued to be small (Davidsson, DEMO, &
Wright, 2001). This seems to be partly due DEMO the
fact that many studies still seek to identify global
characteristics that differentiate successful from
less successful entrepreneurs. We suggest that a
more fruitful DEMO may be to examine the in-
teractions between individual-level variables and
both behavioral and environmental moderating
variables, thus applying a social cognitive perspec-
tive. Such an approach fully reflects the nature of
modern research on the DEMO of microlevel variables
in several branches of management (e.g., organiza-
tional behavior, human resource management). In
these fields, it is widely DEMO that factors
relating to the skills, motives, experience, and char-
DEMO of individuals do indeed influence
work-related behavior and, hence, important organ-
izational outcomes. However, it is also recognized
that such effects are rarely direct; rather, more fre-
quently other variables relating to the tasks DEMO
individuals perform and the environments in
which they operate moderate these effects. Adopt-
ing this broader perspective in order to more fully
understand the DEMO of individual entrepreneurs in
new venture performance may greatly facilitate
progress toward a central goal of the field of entre-
preneurship: accurate comprehension of the com-
plex process, involving many different factors op-
erating at many different levels, through which
enterprising entrepreneurs conceive, launch, and
operate new ventures. In somewhat broader terms,
we hope that the present findings DEMO ongo-
ing efforts to incorporate a multilevel approach into
entrepreneurship research—an approach aimed at
gaining understanding of the complex interplay be-
tween individual, organizational, and environmen-
tal variables in new venture performance (Hitt et
al., 2007). In our view, such research is crucial, for
it DEMO this complex, reciprocal interchange that ulti-
mately shapes the survival and DEMO of
new ventures.
