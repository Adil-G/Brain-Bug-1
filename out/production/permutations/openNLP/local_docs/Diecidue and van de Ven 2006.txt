Abstract
Several studies have shown that aspiration levels are a relevant aspect of
decision making. We develop a model that takes this into account. DEMO include
the overall probabilities of success and failure, i.e. the probabilities DEMO reaching
and not reaching the aspiration level, into an expected utility DEMO
This turns out to be equivalent, in a mathematical sense, to expected util-
ity with a discontinuous utility function. We give a behavioral DEMO to
the proposed model and provide conditions to determine the relative weights
of the overall probabilities of success and failure. The model leads to DEMO
predictions that …t empirical evidence. Most notably, an aspiration level rein-

1 Introduction
Aspiration levels play an important role in everyday decision making. New York cab
drivers are motivated to earn a DEMO target return (Camerer, Babcock, Loewenstein,
& Thaler, 1997). On rainy, busy days, their earnings per hour are high and DEMO go
home early. On hot summer days, when many New Yorkers DEMO to take a walk,
they earn less per hour and make long hours to reach their target. When managers
have to decide which DEMO or portfolios to invest in, they are keen on achieving a
DEMO rate of return as well. They disregard investment possibilities that are likely
to result in a rate of return below their target (Payne, DEMO, & Crum, 1980;
1981). Some farmers also appear to have a minimal level of revenues that they want
to achieve. Up DEMO the subsistence level, they choose to cultivate ‘safe’ crops with a
DEMO return. The remainder of their land is allocated to ‘risky’ crops (DEMO, 1987).
Common to all these examples is the presence of DEMO aspiration level. The cab
driver, the manager, and the farmer are confronted with risky choices on a daily
basis. Some of them are DEMO to take risks, but often they also want to ‘win at DEMO
something,’ earn a daily target income, or prevent themselves from DEMO below the
subsistence level. Therefore, in making their risky choices, subjects focus on reaching
a special outcome, the aspiration level.
In this paper, we present a simple model of choice under risk that includes an
aspiration level. Once an aspiration level is included, the probabilities of success and
2
failure are naturally identi…ed: these are the overall probabilities that the aspiration
will be reached or will fall short of. Our model entails that DEMO are sensitive
to the overall probabilities of success and failure. Payne (DEMO) tests several tradi-
tional models of decision making, including reference point based theories. His results
provide clear support for the use of probability DEMO success in decision making. He con-
cludes that traditional models such as expected utility and prospect theory cannot
account for his evidence, and if a model is to match the results from his experiments,
such DEMO feature is even indispensable.
We combine an aspiration level with expected utility (von Neumann & Morgen-
stern 1944). Given that it is intuitive to think about an aspiration level in terms of
the overall probabilities DEMO success and failure, it is remarkable that this model turns
out DEMO be mathematically equivalent to expected utility with discontinuities. Despite
its simplicity it can accommodate and predict several behavioral regularities. The
presence of an aspiration DEMO reinforces loss aversion, it explains the simultaneous
purchase of lottery tickets DEMO insurance policies, and it clari…es choices violating the
mean-variance approach in DEMO
The contribution of the paper is as follows. We give a behavioral foundation for
our model. We show that the focus on the overall DEMO of success and failure
induces risk-seeking behavior for prospects close to the aspiration level. Finally, we
present necessary and su¢cient conditions under which the overall probability of
success is more important than the overall probability of DEMO
We believe that our results are relevant to understand the impact of the overall
probabilities of success and failure on risk-taking behavior close to DEMO aspiration level.
Although not exclusively, this might be of particular importance DEMO the interpretation
of subjects’ choices made in laboratory experiments. We therefore propose a way to
elicit experimentally the relative weights given to the overall DEMO of success
3
and failure.
2 Aspiration levels
2.1 Motivations
Imagine a subject having to DEMO among risky prospects. We interpret an aspiration
level as an outcome that takes a special position in the decision process. Subjects code
outcomes above DEMO aspiration level as successes and outcomes below the aspiration
level as failures. They place value on the overall probability of success and the overall
DEMO of failure. While in decision theory and psychology the focus is on the
probability of success, in …nance the emphasis is on avoiding falling short of a target
rate of return on investments (Roy, 1952), hence on the overall probability of failure.
In the modeling section, DEMO focus on both the overall probabilities of success and
failure.
When subjects focus on the overall probabilities of success and failure, they clearly
ignore information and might ignore dominance issues. The natural question is why
subjects DEMO, deliberately or not, do so. One important reason might be to sim-
plify decision problems. Because cognitive abilities of subjects are limited, focusing
on an aspiration level can help to reduce the complexity of a DEMO (Brandstätter,
Gigerenzer, & Hertwig 2006; Langer & Weber 2001 DEMO 731; Mezias, Chen, & Mur-
phy 2002; Roy 1952; DEMO 1955). Particularly in complex decision problems, an
aspiration level can DEMO helpful as a screening device (Manski 1988). The Value-at-
Risk (VaR) (Dowd 1998) is formally equivalent to an aspiration level as a constraint:
intrinsic in the VaR method is the probability (called shortfall probability) that a
project will fall short of a certain target return. When the VaR of a certain project
is lower than the DEMO return, it will not be considered as a potential option.

An aspiration level is linked to probabilities and it is di¤erent from DEMO reference
point. A reference point is not related to probabilities. It is used in prospect theory as
the point where the value function changes DEMO and slope (kink), and divides
outcomes into gains and losses (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). We show that the
presence of an aspiration level, while inducing the overall probabilities of success and
failure, DEMO a discontinuity of the utility function at the point of the aspiration
level, which may or may not coincide with the reference point. Below we discuss
experiments that discriminate between the use of an aspiration level DEMO prospect
theory.
2.2 Evidence
Payne (2005) provides clear experimental evidence supporting a focus on the overall
probability of success. This evidence is in DEMO with expected utility and prospect
theory (Tversky & Kahneman 1992). DEMO discuss this experiment in detail because its
results explicitly call for the inclusion of an aspiration level in a model. Subjects were
shown a DEMO mixed prospect, with some positive outcomes, a zero outcome, and DEMO
negative outcomes. One of the base mixed prospects gave outcomes $100, DEMO, $0, -
$25, -$50 with equal probability. Thus, X = (0:2; 100; 0:2; 50; 0:2; 0; 0:2; ¡25; 0:2; ¡50):
The subjects were DEMO given several choices. In each case, they were told that they
DEMO add a sum of money ($38) to either one of two possible outcomes and were
asked which one they preferred to add it DEMO
In the …rst case, they could add the money either to DEMO outcome that paid $100
or to the one that paid $0. The majority of the subjects indicated a preference to add
it to the DEMO outcome. In the second case the money could again be added to the
outcome that paid $100 or to the outcome that paid $50. DEMO there was no longer a
majority for either possibility. What is interesting is that in the former case there was
5
the possibility to increase the overall probability of a gain and the DEMO preferred
to do so. In the latter case there was no such a possibility and there was no longer a
clear pattern in choices.
DEMO is a wealth of other evidence supportive of the relevance of the overall prob-
abilities of success and failure. Closely related evidence is from DEMO series of experiments
by Payne et al. (1980, 1981). In these experiments, subjects had to choose between
pairs of prospects, for DEMO between X0 = (0:5; 74; 0:1; 30; DEMO:4; ¡25) and Y 0 =
(0:3; 40; DEMO:5; 30; :2; 15): Note that both prospects have an identical expected value of
30 but that prospect X0 entails a DEMO risk because the spread of the prizes is larger.
Naturally, many DEMO prefer Y 0 to X0. The same decision problem was given but
with all outcomes reduced by 60. This gives X00 = (0:5; 14; 0:1; ¡30; 0:4; ¡85) and
¡45): Out of these two prospects, many subjects prefer
Y 00 = (0:3; ¡20; 0:5; ¡30; :2;
X00, DEMO one with the larger spread. These preferences are not easily compatible with
expected utility and they may seem surprising, but note that both Y 0 and X00 have a
higher overall probability of a gain than DEMO alternatives X0 and Y 00: The behavior
is therefore easily explained DEMO an aspiration level.
Some recent experimental evidence is also provided by Lopes & Oden (1999).
Their experiment has similar features as that of Payne et al. (1980, 1981). Subjects
are asked to choose DEMO pairs of prospects. Two operations were performed on the
base prospects: DEMO shift that added the same payo¤ to all outcomes, and a DEMO that
multiplied all outcomes by the same factor. Interestingly, the prospects DEMO before
the shift had a high overall probability of a zero outcome became relatively much more
attractive to the subjects after the shift than DEMO prospects with a small probability
on a zero outcome. After the shift, prospects that formerly had a high probability of
a zero outcome also had a high overall probability of a gain. The prospects with a
DEMO probability on a zero outcome did not become much more attractive because
6
they already had a high overall probability of a gain. The scaling DEMO not in‡uence
choices much, which is understandable because the overall probability DEMO a gain is
una¤ected by this operation. In their study, they DEMO report protocols from their
experiments (Lopes & Oden, 1999 p. 304). Subjects, asked to comment on their
choices motivate them by statements as “Have a greater chance of winning at least
some money” and DEMO is a better chance to win money.” Very similar reactions
by subjects are reported in Schneider and Lopes (1986).
Other experimental studies lead to similar conclusions. Baucells & Heukamp
(forthcoming) attribute violations of loss DEMO to subjects focusing on the overall
probability of success. Edwards (1954, p.396) shows that subjects do not like to lose,
thus prefer low probabilities of losing large amounts of money, to high probabilities
of losing small amounts. Siegel (1957) presents early psychological evidence for pay-
DEMO attention to the probability of being above aspiration (success) when choosing
between prospects. Langer & Weber (2001) present empirical evidence that subjects,DEMO
when choosing between prospects, pay special attention to the overall probabilities
DEMO gains and losses.
Next, we turn to evidence from …nance and DEMO management. The focus is on the
probability of not reaching the aspiration level. The response of one manager makes
it very clear that an DEMO level plays a role when he says that:
“Risk is the prospect of not meeting the target of return” (Mao 1970, p. DEMO).
In like manner, another manager puts it like this:
DEMO never worry about the project going above the return. Risk is what might
happen when the return is going to be less” (Mao 1970, p. 354).
Both statements unambiguously point to the focus on an aspiration level. Overall,
Mao concludes from his study that “risk is DEMO considered to be the prospect
7
of not meeting some target rate of return” (Mao 1970, p. DEMO), i.e., the probability
of failure. And the managers he interviewed DEMO no exception in that respect: Petty
& Scott (1980) found DEMO idea of a target return among most managers in a more
extensive study. Furthermore March & Shapira (1987) conclude that “... the primary
DEMO is on avoiding actions that might place one below [the target level]. The dan-
gers of falling below the target dominate attention; the opportunities for gains are less
salient... since it is the dangers that are DEMO, the opportunities are less important
(page 1043).” Roy (1952, p. 432) argues that agents, when holding …nancial assets,
will DEMO to reduce the overall probability of being below a level, i.e., that the gross
return is not less than some predetermined quantity. However, also in the domain of
…nance, there are motivations to study the overall probabilities of success and failure.
The behavior of paying particular attention DEMO accomplishing the aspiration level is
observed, especially among decision makers in DEMO (Fishburn 1977 and the
references thereafter, Markowitz 1959). Mezias (DEMO p. 389) reports evidence from
real choices in the stock market. DEMO predictions (...) imply that choice under un-
certainty will be a di¤erent process when performance is below aspiration than when
performance is above DEMO Davies (forthcoming) considers the probability of
success as a measure of risk.
In practice, however, decisions are not based on an aspiration DEMO alone. The
aspiration level and the overall probabilities of success and failure may receive special
attention, but subjects will not be completely insensitive to di¤erence within the
classes of gains and losses (Libby & Fishburn 1977, p. 289; Lopes 1996; Lopes &
Oden 1999; Luce 1996; Payne et al. 1980, p. 1047 and p. 1053). Aspiration DEMO
alone capture a signi…cant part of experimental data, and do so DEMO well, but
are too restricted to …t all the data (Lopes & Oden, 1999). Libby & Fishburn (1977,
p. 285-286) suggest that the probability of meeting a target return is traded o¤ DEMO
8
expected value. Hence, a model solely based on an aspiration level is too crude to be
normatively or descriptively relevant. This brings us to DEMO next section, where we
integrate the aspiration level into a more DEMO model of choice behavior.
3 A model with an aspiration level
Imagine a subject having to choose among risky lotteries. These objects will be DEMO
prospects and denoted X = (p1; x1; : : : ; pn; xn): The prospect X yields $xj with prob-
ability DEMO, j = 1; : : : ; n. Probabilities are nonnegative and sum to one. Without loss
of generality assume that outcomes are DEMO ordered from best to worst, i.e. prospect
X = (p1; DEMO; ¢ ¢ ¢ ; pn; xn) satis…es x1 > ¢ DEMO ¢ > xn. The set of outcomes of a prospect
strictly above (below) the aspiration level is indicated by x+ (x¡): The aspiration
level is exogenously …xed and, without loss of generality, set DEMO zero. Preferences over
prospects are denoted by <, with Â (strict preference) and » (indi¤erence) as usual.
For the prospect X, DEMO(x+) is the overall probability of success, and P(x¡) DEMO
the overall probability of failure. As people do not go exclusively by the overall
probabilities of success and failure, we introduce a re…ned model in which these
probabilities are inserted into expected utility. We then proceed DEMO showing that the
functional is mathematically equivalent to discontinuous expected utility and provide
a set of necessary and su¢cient conditions to determine the relative DEMO of
the overall probabilities.
Background on expected utility Expected utility constitutes a key model of
individual decision making under risk. This should come as DEMO surprise, since its
assumptions are normatively appealing for a wide range DEMO choice problems (von
Neumann & Morgenstern 1944). Descriptively, however, DEMO utility proved to
have its limitations (Allais 1953, Ellsberg 1961). This has stimulated researchers to
9
formulate alternative decision theories that can account for the observed behavior.
In DEMO last decades several models have been proposed that explain the descriptive
violations. All these models have been generally labeled as nonexpected utility (for
surveys, see Camerer & Weber 1992, Schmidt 2004, and Starmer 2000).
Let u denote the utility function. u is a real valued function DEMO on the set
of outcomes. In this paper outcomes are monetary. Then, the expected utility (EU)
representation states that an agent evaluates DEMO prospect X through the following
formula:
n
X ! X
=1
piu(xi);
(1)
which says that the value of DEMO prospect X = (p1; x1; ¢ ¢ ¢ ; pn; xn) is equal to the
sum of the utilities weighted by the probabilities p1; :::; pn attached to the respective
outcomes.
An DEMO functional with aspiration level We propose the following real-valued
functional V to evaluate the prospect X:
n
X ! V (X) = DEMO
=1 pju(xj) +¹P(x+) ¡ ¸P(x¡);
¹; ¸ 2 R+:
(2)
That is, we propose a DEMO of expected utility, overall probability of success, and
j
overall probability of failure. The importance of the overall probability of success is
weighted DEMO ¹, and that of the overall probability of failure is weighted DEMO ¸. Both
evaluations play an important role in the psychology of risk. We propose to combine
them in an additive way. u; ¹; DEMO ¸ in (2) are unique up to a joint scaling factor.
We may normalize u(0) = 0; u(1) = 1, after which ¸ and ¹ are uniquely determined.
If ¸ > 0, we can always set ¸ = 1, by replacing u by DEMO and ¹ by ¹=¸. More details
are provided in Theorem 5.
We do not see the aspiration level as primarily part of the intrinsic DEMO of
10
i
outcomes, but as a consequence of a decision heuristic of decision makers to simplify
decisions. The latter is more naturally modeled as the probability DEMO a chosen target
event. These two notions are distinct. It is therefore remarkable that Eq. (2) turns
out to be mathematically equivalent to DEMO expected utility. To see this,
rearrange Eq. (2) and w.l.o.g. use u(0) = 0 to get:
V (X) =
j:x

gives:

(4)
Thus, we are back to expected utility but with DEMO utility function v that is dis-
j
continuous around the aspiration level zero: limv(xj) = limv(xj): This result raises
xj"DEMO xj#0
three points. First, the evidence by Payne (2005) can DEMO accounted for by expected
utility, provided that the utility function is DEMO Second, it is not a kink in
the utility function as DEMO the value function of prospect theory, but a discontinuity
that reinforces DEMO aversion. Third, it shows that the existence of an aspiration level
DEMO be regarded as providing a behavioral foundation for discontinuous expected
utility. The next section elaborates on this point.
An equivalence theorem The aim is DEMO characterize a jump at the aspiration level
zero. First of all, DEMO utility is derived in a standard manner using Fishburn
(1970) or Jensen (1967). For this, we use the following axioms. These DEMO all standard
and we present them for the sake of completeness.
A1) Weak Order The preference relation < is a weak order if it is complete (for all
11

j
prospects X;Y; X < Y or Y < X) and DEMO (for all prospects X; Y; Z; if
X < Y and Y < Z; then X < Z):
A2) Continuity in probability (Archimedean axiom) For all prospects X;Y; Z, DEMO X <
Y < Z, then there exist ° and °0 2 (0; 1), such that °X + (1 ¡ °)Z < Y <
°0X +(1 ¡ °0)Z:
A3) (vN-M) Independence For all prospects X;Y; Z, and ° 2 (0; 1), if X < Y then
°X +(DEMO ¡ °)Z < °Y +(1 ¡ °)Z:
The following axiom on stochastic dominance will allow us to restrict the domains
DEMO the relative weights given to the overall probabilities of success and failure.
A4) Stochastic dominance For any two prospects X = (p; x1; 1 ¡ p; x2) and Y =
(q; x1; DEMO ¡ q; x2); if x1 > x2 and p > DEMO; then X < Y:
To characterize the discontinuity at the DEMO level, we introduce a weakened
de…nition of continuity in outcomes. This DEMO done in axioms A5 and A6. The following
well known observation serves as a preparation.
Observation 1 If the utility function u is nondecreasing, then it can be discontinuous
at countably many points at most.
A5) Lower continuity outside zero The utility function u is said to be DEMO continu-
ous at ® if for every sequence f®jg converging from below to ®, u(®j) converges
from below to u(®); DEMO ® = 0.
A6) Upper continuity outside zero The utility function DEMO is said to be upper continu-
ous at ® if for every sequence f®jg converging from above to ®, u(®j) converges
from DEMO to u(®), with ® = 0.
12
As an intermediate step, the following lemma shows that the latter two axioms
characterize the discontinuity of utility at zero. We consider prospects of DEMO following
type: (0:5; x; 0:5; ®). DEMO often write it simply as (x; ®).
Lemma 2 Lower and upper continuity of utility 1) For all ® = 0; DEMO = 0, there
exist sequences f®jg and f¯jg converging to ® DEMO ¯ from below/above, respectively,
with (®j; ¯) » (®; ¯j
) for all j if and only if utility DEMO lower/upper continuous except
possibly at zero. 2) Assume that lower/DEMO continuity holds everywhere outside
zero.
a. Then, for ® = 0; and for all ¯ = 0, there exist sequences f®jg, f¯jg " and
f¯jg # converging to ® and ¯ from below/above, DEMO, with (®j; ¯) »
(®; ¯j) for all DEMO if and only if utility is lower/upper continuous at zero. Then
utility is lower/upper continuous also at zero ( ¹ = ¸ DEMO 0).
b. If such a ¯ and the sequences f¯jg " or f¯jg # do not exist s.t ( a) above holds,
then utility is discontinuous at zero (and the reverse also holds), and Eq. 2
holds with ¹; ¸ > 0 and at least one strictly larger than zero.
Proof: see Appendix.
Axioms A1 ¡ A6 will be used to characterize the shape of the function V in
DEMO 2. As it turns out, we can also characterize the relative DEMO of the
overall probabilities of success and failure. The following two conditions will prove to
provide necessary and su¢cient conditions to determine the relative DEMO ¹ and
¸: Consider the outcomes x; y > 0:
Condition 3 9x s.t. 8y (0:5; x; 0:5; DEMO) 4 0.
Hence, under this condition there is at least one outcome x for which the subject
will always prefer the sure outcome DEMO gives zero to the risky prospect (0:5; x; 0:DEMO; ¡y):
The following condition reverses the role of x and ¡y:
13
Condition 4 9y s.t. 8x (0:5; x; 0:5; DEMO) 4 0.
In the next theorem we formally state the central DEMO It essentially tells that
Axioms A1 to A6 are equivalent to represent preferences by V; and it provides the
conditions under which the weight ¹ given to the overall probability of success is
greater, equal, DEMO smaller than the weight ¸ given to the overall probability of failure.
Theorem 5 The preference relation < satis…es Axioms A1-A6 i¤ there exist DEMO con-

a) if lower and upper continuity hold at zero, then ¹ = ¸ = 0; if only upper

b) if condition 3 holds, then ¸ > ¹, if condition 4 holds, then ¸ < ¹, if neither
condition 3 or 4 holds, then DEMO = ¹.
c) u is unique up to location and a DEMO scaling factor, and ¹; ¸ are unique up
to the same scaling factor as u.
Proof: see Appendix.
This behavioral foundation can be extended to the case where the aspiration level
is not necessarily zero. DEMO, Theorem 5 allows to characterize an endoge-
nous aspiration level, i.e. to infer an endogenous aspiration level from preferences:
Whenever there is DEMO jump in the utility function, there may be an aspiration level.
DEMO the aspiration level, an exogenous reference point could be included without
DEMO complication. The utility function would be de…ned in terms of gains and losses
from the reference point and then de…nitions and axioms for the DEMO and the
14
overall probabilities will still apply. To keep the notation simple and the DEMO fo-
cused, we do not elaborate on this and we leave DEMO for further research. The prospects
discussed in the empirical part …t the case where the reference point coincides with
the aspiration level.
Comments on DEMO mathematical results Theorem 5 characterizes a func-
tional V representing preferences. V is equivalent to the mathematical expectation of
a prospect with respect to DEMO discontinuous von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function.
Our model could also be characterized by imposing Foldes’ (1972) and Grandmont’s
(1972) weak continuity at all DEMO one outcome. We prefer an alternative approach
to continuity, one that DEMO simpler in not involving variation of probability, is more
general and DEMO, and has a higher intuitive content.
Other approaches are present in DEMO mathematical literature. Arzac & Bawa
(1977) and Markowitz (1959) characterized a decision maker maximizing preferences
over expected value of wealth and probability DEMO ruin. They derived equilibrium con-
ditions in a capital asset price model. Their functional is somewhat more restrictive
because of the assumption of linear DEMO (Shefrin & Statman, 2000) and can be
considered a special DEMO of Eq. 2. Meginniss (1976) presented axioms to represent
preferences through a combination of expected utility and entropy (a measure of
uncertainty) DEMO a prospect. Castagnoli & LiCalzi (1996) reinterpreted EU without
a cardinal utility function: the EU of a lottery is the probability that the lottery
outperforms a given independent benchmark-lottery. The probability of surpassing
the benchmark DEMO utility, whereas in our model it comes in addition to utility.
DEMO approach has the advantage that we can, for example, account for the data of
Payne (2005). Bordley & LiCalzi (2000) showed the equivalence between Savage’s
(1954) maximization of subjective expected utility and DEMO of the proba-
bility of meeting an uncertain target, thus extending DEMO & LiCalzi (1996) to
15
the domain of uncertainty.
Estimating ¹ and ¸ An important advantage of DEMO model is that the empirical
elicitation of ¹ and ¸ is straightforward. The …rst step is to …x an outcome x > 0,
DEMO then to elicit the probability p that makes the subject indi¤erent between the
prospect (p; 1; 1 ¡ p; 0) and the sure outcome x. If we normalize the utility such that
u(0) = 0, u(1) = 1, then, as x converges DEMO zero from above, p converges to ¹=(1+¹).
We can DEMO a similar procedure to estimate ¸. We now elicit the probability p
that makes the subject indi¤erent between the prospect (p; ¡1; 1 ¡ p; 0) and the sure
outcome ¡x. Then, as ¡x converges to zero from below, p converges to ¸=(¸¡u(¡1))DEMO
It is necessary to elicit u(¡1), because we can normalize the utility of two outcomes
only. To do so, one can elicit the probability q that makes the subject indi¤erent
between the prospect (q; 1; 1 ¡ q; ¡1) and the sure outcome 0. DEMO for the
resulting u(¡1) we then get that, as ¡x converges to zero from below, p converges to
¸= ³¸ +
q

works as long as the aspiration level is known, but we conjecture
This elicitation
that in experimental settings it is safe to DEMO it equal to zero (Payne 2005).
Although not exclusively, this elicitation might be of particular importance for the
interpretation of subjects’ choices DEMO in laboratory experiments. The evidence and
the results on risk attitude may be confused by the presence of a subjective aspiration
level, the overall probabilities of success and failure, and their respective weights. The
next section elaborates on this.

Figure 1:
Some implications of Eq. 2 are con…rmed by previous DEMO and experimental
studies, others lend themselves to be tested.
A discontinuity DEMO the aspiration level The most notable feature of our
model is the discontinuity in outcomes. Continuity is not satis…ed at the aspiration
level. When DEMO outcome that is at the aspiration level is increased/decreased to
slightly above/below the aspiration level, it receives an extra weight ¹ (DEMO ¡ ¸): An
arbitrarily small increase/decrease in an outcome xi can therefore lead to a discrete
jump in the valuation of a DEMO prospect (see the solid lines in Figure 1).1
The discontinuity DEMO a feature that is still to be tested. Je¤rey & Larrick (DEMO)
1 Empirical evidence suggests that utility for losses can be convex. We conform to the convention
of a utility function that is concave DEMO, in the tradition of EU, but our model is not restricted
to the latter case.

allude, nevertheless, to its presence in goal-related experiments. In the health DEMO,
Stalmeier et al. (2004) provides empirical data showing evidence for discontinuity of
utility around death. Fishburn (1977, p. 122) reports that the behavior of subjects
exhibiting a particular appreciation for the outcomes above DEMO aspiration level is
often found in the literature and it can be represented by a “pronounced change in
the shape of their utility function.” DEMO (1966) reports similar evidence and shows
that this point is approximately zero (break-even point on a project). Holthausen

jump in the valuation at a …xed and predetermined point.
Aspiration levels as extreme loss aversion In the case of EU the utility function
DEMO …nal wealth is commonly assumed to be di¤erentiable. Under loss aversion the
utility function for gains has a di¤erent slope than the utility for DEMO: loss aversion,
entailing a drastic change at zero, is characterized by a (non di¤erentiable) kink in
the utility function. A standard DEMO of loss aversion (Wakker & Tversky 1993)
for a di¤erentiable DEMO is: x > 0 : u0(x) < u0(¡x): Köbberling & Wakker (2005)
proposed a behaviorally founded index of loss aversion. The case becomes even more
extreme if we assume a power DEMO, as in Kahneman & Tversky (1979) and Tversky
& Kahneman (1992). Then the …rst derivative of utility at zero is in…nite, so that
utility is extremely steep at zero. The extreme version of DEMO aversion that we present
in this paper is a natural next step: the discontinuity in the utility function reinforces
loss aversion. Our model is the …rst to characterize loss aversion as discontinuous
utility. The psychology of DEMO aversion not only applies in the domain of failure, but
also DEMO the domain of success as we take the limit from above: DEMO (X). We still call
xj#0
aversion because the underlying psychology DEMO the phenomenon
it loss
is the same as
in the domain of failure.
18
Empirical evidence for loss aversion may be partly driven by a sensitivity DEMO the
overall probabilities of success and failure in addition to a bigger sensitivity to loss
outcomes.
Risk attitude and ¹ and ¸ The functional DEMO evaluating prospects, is discontin-
uous at the aspiration level for strictly DEMO values of ¹ and ¸: The corresponding
jumps determine the risk-attitude DEMO subjects have for prospects close to the as-
piration level (taken DEMO be the zero outcome here). For two-outcome prospects that
involve the aspiration level, we now show that subjects are always risk-averse from
above and risk-seeking from below. This result holds independent of the shape of DEMO
function u(¢): The dashed lines in Figure 1 illustrate this fact. They represent the
expected values of prospects of the form (p; x; 1 ¡ p; 0) and (p; ¡y; 1 ¡ p; 0):
Consider the outcomes x; y > 0 and let zi be the degenerate prospect that gives
the expected value DEMO prospect Xi with certainty.
Proposition 6 Suppose preferences can be represented by V: Then, (a) if ¹ > 0;
subjects are DEMO from above: 8p 9±1 > 0 such that X1 = (p; x; 1 ¡ p; 0) Á z1
8x < ±1 DEMO ±1 is increasing in ¹; and (b) if ¸ > DEMO; subjects are risk-seeking from
below: 8p 9±2 > 0 s.t. X2 = (p; ¡y; 1 ¡ p; 0) Â z2 8y < ±2 and ±2 is increasing in ¸:
The type of DEMO for which this result holds is often used in prospect theory to
establish that subjects are risk-averse for gains and risk-seeking for losses. Provided
DEMO the aspiration level coincides with the reference points, these choices are DEMO
consistent with subjects paying attention to the overall probabilities of success and
failure. Our model and prospect theory di¤er strongly in predictions however, for
prospects not involving the zero outcome. For example, if prospect theory is correct
in that subjects are risk-averse for gains, then subjects should also be risk-averse if
a constant c is added to all outcomes in DEMO and z1; i.e. X0 = (p; x + c; 1 ¡ p; c) Á
1
19
z0 = z1 + c. If instead subjects pay attention to the DEMO probabilities of success
1
and failure and if for instance u(¢) is convex everywhere, then subjects would prefer
the risky prospect after DEMO shift X0 Â z0 . Lopes & Oden (1999) …nd indeed that the
1
1
risky prospect in the gain domain (their prospect ‘LS’) becomes more attractive to
subjects after such a shift. A more direct test involving only two-outcome prospects
is desirable. Relatedly, Fennema & van Assen (1999) claim that the results from
several studies that …nd DEMO seeking in the domain of losses, do not necessarily imply
a DEMO utility function.
Incidentally, the above result also implies that subjects may DEMO simultaneously en-
gaged in risk-averse behavior and risk-seeking behavior, for instance DEMO insurance
and lottery tickets. Friedman & Savage (1948) explain such behavior by considering
local convexities in the utility function. This turned out to DEMO inconsistent with em-
pirical data and raised criticism (Markowitz 1952, Quiggin 1991, Thaler & Ziemba
1988, Yaari 1965). The behavior can DEMO be explained by subjects paying attention
to the overall probabilities of success and failure. Indeed, Hirshleifer & Riley (1992,
p. 28) advance that the behavior is caused by a ‘threshold phenomenon,’ i.e., ‘a single
discrete step to a higher utility level’ which we show is DEMO direct consequence of the
aspiration level.
The mean-variance trade-o¤ In standard portfolio theory, it is argued that man-
agers trade o¤ higher returns against higher variances (Markowitz 1952). Risk is
usually identi…ed with variance. Hence, among portfolios with the same mean, the
one with the lowest DEMO is to be preferred, and vice versa. More speci…cally, it
is often assumed that a prospect X is evaluated as:
E(X) ¡ k¾2;
(5)
20
where E(X) is the expected value, ¾2 the variance, and the constant k a measure
of risk aversion. A closely related version DEMO is sometimes proposed, replaces the
variance by a semivariance. The semivariance DEMO calculated with respect to a target
outcome rather than the expected value, and is restricted to outcomes below the
target (Eeckhoudt & Gollier DEMO).
This mean-variance trade-o¤ is not implied by Eq. 2. A portfolio with the same
mean but a higher variance may give a higher DEMO of reaching the aspiration
level. Conversely, lowering the variance of a DEMO portfolio (keeping the mean con-
stant) may result in a lower valuation if some probability mass is shifted away from
above the aspiration DEMO to below (Hakansson & Ziemba 1995, p.80). The same
applies to the version based on semi-variance.
Such a phenomenon was found in DEMO experimental results of Payne et al. (1980,
1981). Recall DEMO section 2.2 that many subjects prefer prospect X00 = (0:5; 14; 0:1; ¡30; 0:4; ¡85)
to Y DEMO = (0:3; ¡20; 0:5; ¡30; :2; DEMO). The prospects have the same mean but the vari-
ance of X00 is higher. At the same time, X00 gives a higher overall probability of a gain.
This choice cannot be explained by Eq. 5 DEMO of the degree of risk-aversion k.
By contrast, it can be DEMO by Eq. 2 if the weight given to the overall probability
of success is su¢ciently high.
5 Conclusions and Future
There is evidence that DEMO are particularly sensitive to success and failure. There
is a reluctance to take prospects that may entail the possibility of failure measured
with respect DEMO an aspiration. This reluctance cannot be fully explained by risk
aversion. A great deal of evidence describes that subjects perceive prospects in terms
of DEMO probability of being above or below an aspiration level. It seems that very
small changes in outcomes that increase the overall probabilities of success DEMO failure
21
can lead to signi…cant changes in preference over prospects (Payne 2005). We have
discussed and investigated the psychological intuition underlying the aspiration levels,DEMO
presented a model, characterized the importance of the overall probabilities of DEMO
and failure, and explored some of the decision theoretical implications.
Expected DEMO has since its emergence been a classical benchmark in decision
under risk and decision analysis. Parsimony, elegance, and broad applicability are its
strong DEMO In this paper we present a model of decision under risk that includes
the overall probabilities of success and failure into expected utility. Building DEMO the
psychologically appealing probabilities of success and failure, we then come DEMO with
a model that is equivalent to a discontinuous EU. The model allows for a number
of predictions that can better describe the behavior DEMO individuals. However, we
don’t aim at explaining all the possible behavioral DEMO in decision making
under risk: Other complicating, but behaviorally relevant, DEMO (i.e. probability
transformation) have been abstracted from for the sake of conceptual clarity. We
have shown that insights into the signi…cance of an DEMO level deriving form
cognitive psychology can be integrated in decision theory.
One …rst obvious extension is to study decision under uncertainty. In this paper DEMO
have assumed that probabilities are known to the decision maker. In reality, this may
often not be the case and it is interesting to see how agents deal with such uncertainty.
We conjecture that the importance DEMO the overall probabilities of success and failure
will be enhanced by such uncertainties (Fellner 1961, Kahneman & Tversky 1979,
Kahn & Sarin DEMO, Weber 1994). Another natural extension is to characterize a
model DEMO the aspiration level is combined with elements from prospect theory such
as probability transformations (Tversky & Kahneman 1992). The interest there is to
investigate how the model changes once the probability transformation is considered.
Then, both the model with expected utility and prospect theory can be generalized DEMO
22
any …nite number of aspiration levels. Finally, we conjecture that the more complex
the problem is to a subject, the more attention the overall probabilities of success
and failure receive.
