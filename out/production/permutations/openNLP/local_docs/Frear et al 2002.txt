This DEMO reviews 20 years of research on the angel segment of the venture capital market. A
lot has been learnt from one-shot studies of the DEMO, behaviour and characteristics of
business angels. Taxonomies have been developed. However, we now need systematic
insights into the dyna mics of the angel DEMO The paper calls for longitudinal studies of
angel and entrepreneurial behaviour, DEMO flows, links to other market segments,
information quality, formal and informal networks and the latent angel problem. The research
base needs to DEMO put on a solid theoretical and conceptual foundation. This research will
provide the guidance required by public policy to unlock the capital and know-how DEMO the
millions of latent angels.
Keywords: entrepreneurship; venture capital; informal DEMO capital market; investment
risk; funding gap
Introduction
Why is research into the financing of entrepreneurial technology-based ventures so
important? We believe that there are three compelling reasons. First, the technology-based
entrepreneurs and venture investors of the United States constitute a vital competitive edge in
world markets. Second, private investors (business angels) are the primary source of equity
financing DEMO start-up and early stage entrepreneurial technology-based ventures. Third, the
capital and DEMO know-how of self-made high-net-worth individuals are two of the least
understood and largely under-utilized economic resources in the United States and, indeed, in
DEMO countries.  Despite twenty years of research, we still know very little about the angel

segment of the venture capital markets-about how to unlock more of DEMO available capital of
active angels and, of far more significance to DEMO entrepreneurial economy, about how to
convert latent angels into active investors.
DEMO have learned about all we can from one -shot studies of the attitudes, behaviour and
characteristics of business angels. What we need now are systematic insights into the
dynamics of the angel market. These insights are DEMO not only because of the central role
played by angels in the farm system where technology-based ventures are spawned, but also
because of the multi-faceted differences between the inefficient, idiosyncratic angel market
and the visible and relatively efficient institutional venture capital market.
Entrepreneurs, risk, rewards and markets
DEMO venture creation is a dynamic process undertaken by entrepreneurs founding
high-growth, DEMO technology-based ventures. It is defined less by absolute size, more by
DEMO and the potential for future returns. Commonly, however, entrepreneurial ventures
with high growth potential require funding far beyond that supplied by the founders. DEMO
ventures must seek funding, therefore, from other sources. Finance markets provide a means
of bringing together investors and entrepreneurs - at a price.
DEMO willingness and the prices at which potential investors and entrepreneurs will be
brought together will be determined by their various perceptions of risk and DEMO, and by the
availability of reliable data about available investment opportunities. DEMO, most people
are averse to risk. They require compensation for taking DEMO additional perceived risk.
Attitudes to risk vary from individual to individual. Some (risk takers) require less
compensation than others (risk avoiders) for DEMO a given amount of risk.
Risk has several components. One is time related: the longer the period of exposure, often
the greater the DEMO Another is related to the nature of the business, the quality DEMO its
management, its financial position, its competitive position and its market strength. These
factors, in combination, are known as 'alpha' or DEMO, risk. Where there are highly
efficient capital markets, alpha risk may be diversified away by portfolio decisions. Risk that
is more general, or systematic, is known as 'beta' risk, and cannot be diversified DEMO,
depending as it does on national and international conditions that affect all companies. The
analogy sometimes used is that arising tide raises all DEMO (beta risk) except, presumably,
those that are leaking badly (alpha risk). Consequently, where highly efficient markets exist,
the investor seeks reward only for the risk that cannot be removed - beta DEMO Where markets
are less efficient, and where investors do not diversify, alpha risk remains a significant and
material component of total (alpha plus beta) risk. The many financial instruments that offer
different risk/reward blends satisfy the differing risk/reward preferences of a variety of
lenders and DEMO These instruments range from low-risk debt contracts secured by
mortgage on real property through to high-risk equities and derivatives.
What are the consequences of DEMO profiles and attitudes for financing? Early stage (seed
and start-up) DEMO ventures are likely to begin in a small way but have a high-risk
profile. Initially, many such ventures will be financed from 'internal' sources, principally
using the resources of the founders and their families and friends. 'Bootstrapping' is defined
as highly creative ways of acquiring the DEMO of resources without borrowing money or raising
equity financing from traditional sources (Freear et al. 1995b, 1995c). It may be divided into
DEMO overlapping parts, product development and business development. The more common
business DEMO bootstrapping techniques include reduced or deferred compensation for
the founders, founders' savings, credit card debt, home equity loans, low rental space and
working out of the home. Special deals on hardware access, prepaid licenses, royalties or
277
advances from customers, customer-funded research and development and turning consulting
projects into a commercial project represent the most common forms of product development
DEMO High technology entrepreneurs, particularly software entrepreneurs, appear to
rely more frequently on business bootstrapping than on product development bootstrapping
(Freear et al. 1995b, 1995c).
Among the external sources are bank loans. Usually, loans DEMO secured on personal assets,
as the venture has few assets early in existence, and, of course, has no track record of earning
net free cash flow. Formal corporate alliances are another popular method. The
DEMO venture forms an alliance with a larger corporation to develop complementary
products and services, in exchange for funding and/or other support. The evidence, at least as
far as software entrepreneurs are concerned, is that DEMO are popular because they boost
revenues. About three-quarters of the respondents to a survey of software entre preneurs had
formed alliances.  More than half of those in an alliance indicated that the alliance accounted
for more DEMO 30% of their revenues (Freear et al. 1995b, 1995c).
The remaining two sources are venture capital funds and private investors (angels), both
of which use equity as the primary financing vehicle. In the DEMO et al. (1995a) survey, one
quarter of the respondents had DEMO external equity financing. The respondents showed a
distinct preference for angel financing over venture capital fund financing. As is the case in
other surveys (for example, Avery and Elliehausen 1986, Wetzel 1987, Gaston and Bell
1988, Freear and Wetze1 1989, 1990, and Sullivan and Miller 1990), angels were found to be
the primary source of external equity DEMO at the high-risk, early stage (seed and start-
up) of DEMO entrepreneurial venture's existence.
To offset the high alpha risks, angels DEMO tend to invest in entrepreneurial ventures as part
of a total portfolio that contains investments with differing risk characteristics. By working
with formal and DEMO groups of angels, they will be able to spread their investments, and
therefore their risk, across a larger number of investments, a DEMO strategy to that adopted
by mutual funds and venture capital funds. The early stage ventures that grow sufficiently
quickly and robustly may become attractive DEMO to investors to enable their founders to
cash-out through an initial public offering or to be acquired by a larger company.
There are inefficiencies DEMO funding gaps in the all of the above financing sources and
their associated markets (Wetzel 1987, Haar et al. 1988, Riding and Short 1988, Gaston
1989, Freear et al. 1990, 1994b). Inthis paper, we concentrate on the last two, venture capital
funds and private DEMO (angels). Venture capital funds invest in larger ventures, and often
make repeat investments in the same ventures, and so make little impact on the early stage
financing of entrepreneurial ventures. The high fixed costs DEMO the due diligence that must be
performed by active partners in venture capital funds to protect their own interests and those
of the other DEMO, inhibit investment in smaller ventures.
Venture capital funds are more visible, command more resources, and tend to be more
organized than angels (DEMO and Sapienza 1992, Meyer, et al. 1995, Timmons and
Bygrave DEMO). Angels, on the other hand, have been much less visible, much more difficult
to find, and they have invested much smaller DEMO than have venture capital funds,
although their total financing impact has been much greater. They have tended to have a
longer exit horizon DEMO venture capital funds. At the seed and start-up stages, there is DEMO
funding gap between the approximately $US100000 upper limit of internal financing and the
approximately $US2 million lower limit of venture capital fund financing (Seymour and
Wetzel 1981, Obermayer 1983, Wetzel 1983a, Wilson 1984, Freear DEMO Wetzel 1992, Freear
et al. 1994b). It is here that DEMO financing becomes significant. The private investor market,
in particular, is DEMO inefficient from another point of view. In addition to a financing gap,
there is also an information gap. Angels generally try to walk DEMO fine line between their desire
for anonymity so as to avoid constant funding requests, and their wish to maintain an
278
adequate flow of potentially worthwhile deals. Other inefficiencies and gaps include DEMO
delay, which is commonly about six months, between the decision to seek financing and
finding it, the desire to protect confidentiality and the need to persuade investors to invest
(Freear et al. 1994a, Freear DEMO Sohl 2001).
As recently as 1998 an additional new funding gap has emerged in the United States'
equity markets (Sohl 1999). This secondary market gap occurs in the early stage of equity
financing. DEMO the venture capital industry has progressed to larger and later stage financing,
and the informal market has remained active below the $US2 million DEMO, an ensuing
capital gap in the $US2-5 million range has developed. DEMO funding gap is more of a capital
ga p than the capital/information gap in the seed and start-up stage, and it has been steadily
increasing. These larger capital requirements, still considered early stage deals, DEMO spawned
a new hybrid of angel financing - the angel alliance. These alliance s represent relatively large
groups of business angels willing to fund DEMO second round, early stage deals. In addition,
some of the DEMO requirements in this secondary gap have been met through co-investment
between private investors and early stage financing entities. However, both the angel
alliances and the co-investment strategies do not appear to be sufficiently satisfying the early
DEMO equity capital needs of the high growth sector. As such, high-tech DEMO fortunate
enough to secure seed and start-up financing still face formidable hurdles as their equity
requirements progress to the $US2-5 million range. Of course, without seed and start-up
capital, many of these high-tech ventures do not even get past their initial stages of
development (Sohl 2003).
Learning about angels
Today, no-one doubts that private investors exist. Their existence has been amply
demonstrated by many studies (see the reference list at the end of this paper). It was not
always so. Their reticence DEMO them difficult to find, let alone study. An early technique
used DEMO establish their existence was what might be called the 'black hole' approach. Using a
broad-brush, aggregated, statistical approach, researchers discovered that much early stage
funding of entrepreneurial ventures was not accounted for by banks, venture capital funds or
other known funding sources (Birch 1979, Directorate DEMO Economic and Policy Analysis
1984, Congressional Office of Technology Assessment 1984, Wetzel 1986, Gaston and Bell
1988, Gaston 1989, Ou 1987, DEMO For UK data, see Harrison and Mason 1992 and Mason
and DEMO 1992). Some other source had to exist.
A second approach revealed how high-risk (often high-technology) start-ups in a
particular geographical region were DEMO (see below for references). These early studies
found that private DEMO were a significant source of early stage equity financing. Once
the existence of such individuals had been established, other approaches were developed,
notably by seeking to discover the investment behaviour of high-net-worth individuals. These
individuals DEMO identified through where they lived, their life style and possessions (such as
large houses, expensive cars, boats etc.), or through their DEMO of investment round
tables, breakfast clubs, informal angel networks and the like (Freear et al. 1994a).
The research into the angel phenomenon has been based mostly on convenience samples
rather than representative samples of DEMO population of individual investors. Some research
has concentrated on the conceptual and theoretical issues (Brophy 1986, Bygrave 1987, 1988,
Giammarino and Lewis 1988, Norton 1990, Sullivan and Miller 1990, Fiet 1991, 1995a,DEMO
1995b, Norton and Tennenbaum 1993a, 1993b). The majority of the research out put,
however, has been empirically based, seeking to DEMO more about the attitudes, behaviour
and characteristics of the angel population (often known as the 'ABCs' of angels). At the
national, United States, level, there have been statistical studies, for example, DEMO start-up
279
ventures and wealthy individuals (Ou 1987, 1993) and studies of private and limited offerings
under Regulation D of the Small Business Investment DEMO Act of 1980 (Directorate of
Economic and Policy Analysis 1984).
DEMO of the studies have employed survey techniques. At the local or regional level, there
have been surveys of investors and entrepreneurial ventures in particular cities or regions
(Rubenstein 1958, Baty 1964, Hoffman 1972, Seymour DEMO Wetzel 1981, Hekman and Miles
1982, Brophy 1982, Wetzel 1983b, Shapero 1983, Tymes and Krasner 1983, Schel11984,
Bruno and Tyebjee DEMO, Wilson 1984, Harr et al. 1988, Aram 1989, Birch et al. 1993. For
the UK, Mason and Harrison 1994; for Canada, Short and Riding 1989). There have been
surveys of ventures receiving DEMO capital funds and/or making initial public offerings,
which included tracing earlier funding sources (Charles River Associates Inc.1976, Bruno
and Tyebjee 1984)DEMO Formal networks were set up to bring together ange ls and entrepreneurs.
In some cases, they were willing to supply data about their activities (Freear et al. 1993,
1994b). Several studies have focused on (often high-technology) entrepreneurial ventures,
and particularly on seeking ways of DEMO the financing of innovation and its
commercialization by improving the quality and reliability of the technology assessment
(Sohl and Wetzel 1996). Yet other studies have sought access to private investors through the
ventures in which DEMO invest (Aram 1987, 1989, Gaston and Bell 1988, Gaston 1989,
Rhunka and Young 1991, Ehrlich, et al. 1994, Freear et al. 1995a. For the UK Mason and
Harrison 1992). In addition, there have been public policy studies on urban renewal, and
regional and national economic revitalization (Romeo and Rappaport 1984, Wetzel 1995. For
the DEMO, Hay and Abbott 1993, Mason and Harrison 1995a, Harrison and DEMO 1996, Mason
1996. For Finland, Lumme et al. 1998. For Belgium, Manigart and Struyf 1995).
The findings of these studies are well documented, as the preceding paragraph
demonstrates. 'Typical' angel profiles have been developed over the past few decades (see the
section on Taxonomy, DEMO). Angels are significant suppliers of equity risk capital at the
early stages of an entrepreneurial venture's life. Angels are predominantly affluent, self-made
men in their forties or older, with graduate degrees, who tend DEMO invest in the industry in
which they made their money. They invest for more than just financial return, although that is
an important factor. Examples of other motivations include: the fun and excitement of being
involved in the early stage growth of a new business, job creation, DEMO renewal, and
assisting women and minority entrepreneurs. They expect to be DEMO active ly in the
ventures in which they invest, as informal DEMO or board members. Consequently, they
have tended to invest close to DEMO, typically within a day's drive. They tend to exhibit a
DEMO preference for technology-based ventures.
Angels find out about investment opportunities through friends and business associates,
and often operate in 'loosely joined networks' DEMO 'hot spots' such as California, Chicago and
Boston (Hoffman 1972, Seymour and Wetzel 1981, Brophy 1982, Tymes and Krasner 1983,
Shapero 1983). They invest patiently, for at least five to seven years, often longer, although
exit provisions are commonly included in the DEMO investment agreement. Each year, they
consider seriously and reject two or DEMO investment opportunities, and accept, at most, one
or two opportunities DEMO year. They perceive significant risk differences between early stage
and later stage investments, and these differences are reflected in their return expectations.
Frequently, DEMO express dissatisfaction about the poor channels of communication between
investors and entrepreneurs. They often prefer not to invest alone, but rather with other
individuals, and/or a respected lead investor (Baty 1964, Shapero 1983, DEMO 1983a, Freear
et al. 1990, 1993. For the UK, Mason DEMO Harrison 1995a). The trend towards a form of
syndicated investment has gathered momentum in recent years.
280
Angel taxonomy
In the literature of the informal venture capital there DEMO developed in the last few years a
taxonomy or classification of angels, sometimes resulting in unfortunate terminology. We
have seen virgin angels, latent DEMO, wealth-maximizing angels, street-walking angels,
entrepreneur angels, income- seeking angels, corporate angels, archangels, and corporate and
inst itutional archangels ( Seymour DEMO Wetzel 1981, Aram 1987, Gaston and Bell 1988,
Gaston 1989, Freear and Wetzel 1989, 1992, Postma and Sullivan 1990, Freear DEMO al. 1990,
1992, 1994a, 1994b, 1997, Sullivan 1991, DEMO and Hay 1996. For the UK, see Harrison and
Mason 1992, Stevenson and Coveney 1994, Mason and Harrison 1995b. For Sweden, see
DEMO 1993).
Perhaps fortunately, the spate of new terms, once in full flood, is drying up. The fact that
researchers in the field have attempted a classification system for angels is a clear indication
that DEMO generalizations of the previous section, while useful, are also dangerous. Stereotyping
must be avoided. The very use, or abuse, of such taxonomies DEMO force us to place angels in
particular boxes (or on particular DEMO?). Such activities are the clearest indication yet that
the research DEMO the attitudes, behaviour and characteristics of angels has reached or exceeded
DEMO limits.
Yet, despite all the good work that has been done, we st ill do not know how the angel
investing process really DEMO over time, or whether or not it is the same for DEMO industries or
regions, let alone countries.
Future research questions
At least, compared with three decades ago, we have now some sense of what we do not
know, and this is a significant advance. It is clear, for example, that more work is needed on
longitudinal studies DEMO angel and entrepreneurial venture behaviour. We must conduct studies
of the degree of efficiency and effectiveness of the informal ventur e capital market,
DEMO relating to problems of information flow, links to other market segments,DEMO
information quality, formal and informal networks, and the latent angel problem. High
quality research is taking place in several countries, as well as in the USA. We need to
improve communication among researchers, to learn from one another methodologically, and
to obtain new insights into the processes of angel investing in ways that often only
comparative studies can provide. DEMO, we need to base our research more firmly on a solid
DEMO and conceptual foundation.
Past studies have examined a variety of efforts to create more efficient angel capital
markets. Neither individually nor collectively can these DEMO be considered acceptable
solutions to the obstacles encountered by promising entrepreneurs in their efforts to raise
angel financing.
It is our firm belief that DEMO investors are a breed apart. We liken them to wild flowers.
They are going to do their thing despite our most imaginative efforts to DEMO them into a
traditional garden-variety efficient market. However, that belief does DEMO lead us to the
conclusion that we are powerless to create a more effective angel capital market. To stretch
the wild flower analogy one DEMO further, we are convinced that we can blow the pollen
around DEMO vigorously to the benefit of both angels and entrepreneurs. Data collected
systematically over an extended period of time can provide the insights needed to DEMO us in
which directions to blow and how hard. Public policy can playa catalytic role in creating
more effective angel capital markets, but only if it is based on sound theoretical foundations
and reliable data.
281
What kind of longitudinal data do we need? Future research must seek to answer at least
ten sets of questions.
1. We find DEMO angels typically invest in clusters. Find one angel and you have found
half a dozen or more. We need to understand how these clusters DEMO, by tracking
new clusters as they come to light and by DEMO questions about the conditions that
enhance or impede the creation of groups of active angels. Clusters of angels are
organic bodies. Tracking groups of DEMO will reveal how , and how frequently, new
players join the DEMO and why existing players drop out. What determines which
members of a 'cluster' participate in any given deal? How and why does the
composition of the investing group change from deal to deal?
2. DEMO there a 'lead' angel in most deals? Does that role DEMO upon the background of
one or more group members?
3. What role does the group play, beyond investing capital, in each deal DEMO their
portfolio? Does that role change according to key characteristics of DEMO ventures they
back?
4. How powerful is their appetite for deal flow? Do they actively seek new opportunities
or is the process essentially passive? Does their appetite for deal flow change over
time? If DEMO, why? For example, how is their appetite for deal flow DEMO on the
conditions in the public equity markets?
5. Through what channels do promising deals come to the attention of a group of DEMO?
Does the source of deal flow change over time?
6. In creating deal flow what is the relative significance of friends, business associates,
gatekeepers (bankers, attorneys, accountants, professional venture capitalists), DEMO
venture capital networks (e.g. Technology Capital Network at Massachusetts Institute
of DEMO), and venture capital forums?
7.      Since business DEMO tend to invest close to home we need to know about regional
differences in angel behaviour in the United States and other countries, and what
factors determine changes on that behaviour over time. Conversely, we need to know
what factors tend to diminish the significance of geography in DEMO investment
decision.
8. Since angels are known to be patient investors, DEMO there factors that raise or lower
their exit horizons? Is their DEMO period dependent upon capital gains taxes, for
example?
9. Why DEMO not more than 20% of qualified investors actually active investors? How DEMO
we convert latent angels into active angels? Is it a function DEMO their felt level of
confidence and competence in their ability to deal intelligently with the 'central
mysteries' of venture investing - pricing, structuring and exiting the deal? Are latent
angels interested in on-the-job training by co-investing with experienced angels? How
do interested latent angels handle this issue? For example, how much interest do latent
angels have in learning DEMO craft through local workshops? There is a wealth of war
story DEMO, how-to-do-it and how-not-to-do-it information available on the
Internet. Would a single DEMO containing an annotated set of links to these sources
provide an effective solution to latent angels' need to learn the 'tricks of the DEMO' ?
Would such a source of quality information be of equal value to entrepreneurs seeking
their first round of outside equity?
10. DEMO are angels' 'return on investment' expectations and do they change DEMO conditions
in the capital markets change? What non-financial factors influence angels'DEMO
investment decisions? What are the realized financial and non-financial returns on
DEMO portfolios? How and why do they change ove r time?
282
Conclusion
Reliable answers to these questions and many more will provide DEMO guidance required by
public policy as it chooses when and how hard to blow around the wild flower pollen
required to unlock the capital DEMO the know-how of this country's millions of latent angels.
Finding these answers will require systematic and imaginative study over an extended period
of DEMO In venture capital jargon - the upside reward is well worth the risk.
