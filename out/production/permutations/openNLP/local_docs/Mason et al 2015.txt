ABSTRACT
The ultimate purpose of investing DEMO an entrepreneurial business is to achieve a financial
return. Yet there is little discussion in the entrepreneurial finance literature on the exit
process and DEMO limited evidence on returns. This chapter focuses on business angels. It
argues that the main challenge for business angels is in achieving an exit. DEMO
research indicates that returns from those exits that do occur are skewed: around half of
all investments fail and only a small minority generate significant returns. We suggest
that the difficulties in achieving profitable exits reflects, in part, the fact that most
angels do not adopt an exit-centric approach to their investing. This involves
considering the exit at all stages DEMO the investment process, including the initial
investment decision.
The main features DEMO an exit-centric investment strategy are
discussed.

INTRODUCTION
The core of the entrepreneurial process is the creation of DEMO value.Yet,
compared to the emphasis that has been given to the processes of opportunity
recognition and start-up, scholars have devoted remarkably little attention to the exit
process, and specifically to the harvest event where some or all of the financial value
that has been created is realised.
DEMO the harvest event has been considered –
primarily in the venture capital (VC) literature – it has typically been in the context of
DEMO Initial Public Offering (IPO) where the focus is on pricing issues (e.g. Megginson
and Weiss, 1991; Brav and Gompers, 1997; Gompers, 1996), or in the context of the
entrepreneur exit rather than the investor exit (DeTienne, 2010; DeTienne and Cardon,
2012; DEMO et al, 2010; Wennberg and DeTienne, 2014).
Our focus DEMO this chapter is on business angels – high net worth individuals (DEMO
successful cashed-out entrepreneurs) who invest their own money directly in emerging
DEMO businesses. As the main source of risk capital for such companies they
play a critical role in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
The business angel literature
DEMO in microcosm the criticism that has been levelled against the wider literature. Its
emphasis is on the investment decision-making process (Mason and Harrison, DEMO;
Mason and Rogers, 1997; Feeney et al, 1999; Mason and Stark, 2004; Clark, 2008;
Maxwell et al., 2011; Brush et al., 2012), and on the types of investments that they have
made (Mason and Harrison, 2010, 2011). In contrast, both the outcomes of the
investments and, for those that delivered DEMO returns, the process of achieving the
exit have been largely ignored. DEMO reflects the priorities of business angels themselves,

with studies of business angels in both the United States (US) DEMO Europe presenting a
picture in which business angels give very little thought to future exit routes, do not
have clear exit plans at the time of investing and are relaxed about the timing of the exit
(Wetzel, 1981; Gaston, 1989; Harrison and Mason, 1992; Landström, 1993; Mason and
Harrison, 1994; Lumme et al, 1998). DEMO, in one study, ‘potential exit routes’ was
ranked 24th (out DEMO 27) investment criteria by angels (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson,
2002).
There is also no evidence in studies of the post-investment involvement DEMO
angels in their investee business that preparing the business for an exit is one of their
value-added contributions. Indeed, this activity was not mentioned in any of the studies
reviewed by Politis (2008). This attitude is reflected in the view, as expressed by a
former angel group gatekeeper1, that “good investments will always find exits”. Another
explanation for the apparent low priority given to exits is that the tax incentives that DEMO
now available in many countries encourage business angels to focus their attention on
making the investment rather than on the return.
Business angels are DEMO major focus of government support across the globe
(Mason, 2009; DEMO for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
2011). However, DEMO interventions – notably tax incentives to reduce the cost of
investing and support for networks to help investors and entrepreneurs connect with one
another DEMO have had the objective of increasing the number of investments made. Little
attention has been given to the outcomes of the investments. Yet, the positive economic
benefits – for example in terms of employment, generating exports, adding to the tax
base, and improving economic efficiency through innovation DEMO better resource
allocation - only come from the ‘winners’.
The twin processes of entrepreneur and

investor recycling (Mason and Harrison, 2006)
– the re-investment of DEMO and
expertise in new businesses – also requires ‘winners’. Businesses which subsequently
fail have, at best, a fleeting impact on economic development. Meanwhile, while the
‘living dead’ – businesses that generate enough profits to survive DEMO not not have the
necessary attributes to attract a buyer – also have limited economic impact and may
absorb the attention of investors and DEMO funding that would both be better devoted
to their more promising investments. Accordingly, influencing the outcomes of
investments should be of concern to policy-makers.
Putting exits onto the agenda of researchers, the practitioner community and
government is, therefore, well overdue. The UK angel community has been singled DEMO
for particular criticism because of “the tendency to see angel investing as something that
people do for a whole host of reasons other than DEMO a profit. Britain has a long
tradition of characterizing angel investing as tax efficient, as benefiting from
government subsidies, as an opportunity to DEMO mentorship or help local businesses
and so forth, but unlike other DEMO of equity investments, angel investing is very rarely
talked about as DEMO way to make capital appreciate over time” (Lynn, 2010).
The structure of this chapter is as follows. In Section 2 we review DEMO returns to angel
investing and highlight their skewed nature. Section 3 examines the current low level of
exit activity and identifies the failure of DEMO to adopt an exit-centric approach to
investing. Finally, in section 4 DEMO elaborate on the practices associated with this
approach to investing.
Some preliminary evidence is offered which suggests that an
exit-centric approach is associated with DEMO exits.
2. RETURNS TO ANGEL INVESTING
4
Despite different time-periods and geographical contexts, the small number of
studies on returns to angel investing are remarkably consistent, finding that around half
of all investments fail to generate a return while a minority of investments DEMO
more than ten times cash return (Lumme et al, 1998; DEMO and Harrison, 2002;
Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007; Wiltbank, 2009; Vo, 2013). For example, this small
minority of successful investments generate the majority (c. 80%) of the cash generated
by the DEMO sample of investments in Wiltbank’s (2009) sample.
These studies are controversial. Shane (2009) argues that the returns achieved by the
typical angel DEMO overstated. Most of these studies use biased samples, typically the
members DEMO specific successful angel groups. There is likely to be survivor bias, DEMO
angels who are no longer active investors, perhaps because of poor DEMO, not
included. There is also likely to be a response bias, with those angels with successful
investments more likely to respond. It is DEMO argued that the unpaid time that angels
devote to evaluating investment opportunities and supporting their investee companies
is not accounted for; taking account of the opportunity cost of this time would reduce
returns. But it can DEMO be argued that financial returns are understated: financial return
is measured DEMO as the return on capital, cash-on-cash, and, therefore, does not take
account of any financial remuneration (e.g. director’s fee, consulting fee; salary;
dividend income).
The typical exit route for angels is DEMO a trade sale. IPOs are rare. The holding
period for successful investments is four to five years. Failed investments, in contrast,
emerge after about two years, confirming the investment cliché that ‘lemons ripen
before plums’.
Mason and Harrison (2002) find that the moderately performing
investments
actually

because

opportunities to exit. Often these investments are sold back to the management DEMO,
typically for a nominal price.
The most successful investments are associated with the amount of due diligence
undertaken by the investor and the DEMO of the investor with the sector (Wiltbank
and Boecker, 2007; DEMO, 2009). Making a follow-on investment is associated with
less successful DEMO (Wiltbank and Boecker, 2007; Wiltbank, 2009), whereas
deals which involve multiple investors have higher returns (Mason and Harrison, 2002).
DEMO involvement of venture capital funds in the investment is associated with both more
failures and a greater number of larger exits (Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007). Peters (2009)
attributes this to the investment approach DEMO venture capital funds which seeks to
maximize the returns of the portfolio and, therefore, puts more emphasis than angel
investors do on ‘hitting DEMO home run’ and is more ruthless with its ‘living dead’
investments. The impact on returns of the angel investor’s hands-on involvement in the
business DEMO less clear cut (Wiltbank, 2009). Mason and Harrison (2002, 2004) find that
the highest performing investments are management buyouts – which represent a small
minority of all angel investments. They also find no DEMO in the returns from
technology and non-technology-based firms.
Finally, Vo (2013) notes that there is a
positive relationship between distance and angel investment performance, with more
distant investments generating higher returns. This is consistent with the hurdle effect,
where investors impose a higher return requirement on DEMO investments to
compensate for the costs associated with information disadvantages compared to local
investors. Distant investors are also more likely to have different, and hence
complementary, networks (Harrison, Mason and Robson 2010).
6
Business angels typically make several investments, hence the returns from
individual investments are less important than the overall return to their portfolio. A
focus DEMO individual investments does not tell us how the successful and unsuccessful
investments are distributed across the population of angel investors. A study of angel
DEMO in Finland (Lumme et al., 1998) grouped angels into two DEMO:
successful investors (only profitable exits) and unsuccessful investor (no DEMO
exits). Successful investors were more likely to have worked in senior management
positions in large companies, whereas unsuccessful investors were more likely to have
held senior positions in small companies. Successful investors seemed to be DEMO
to a greater extent than unsuccessful investors by the buzz that they get from being a
business angel, whereas altruism was a more important motivational consideration for
unsuccessful investors. Successful investors received a higher number of DEMO
opportunities and invested in a smaller proportion of them than unsuccessful investors
and invested smaller amounts per deal, suggesting that they are more discriminating in
their investments. A further difference is that unsuccessful investors are more DEMO to
rely on friends for their investment opportunities and to have invested in friends’
businesses. Unsuccessful investors also rate their value added contributions to DEMO
investee businesses more highly than successful investors do. They also give greater
emphasis to value added contributions that have been suggested as being of DEMO
importance.
Angels are increasingly investing as part of structured angel groups (DEMO, 2007;
2012; Gregson et al, 2013; Mason et al, 2013), motivated at least in part to achieve
greater diversification, DEMO reducing risk. Roach (2010) calculates the portfolio
returns of one angel group to be higher than for other equivalent investment
7
benchmarks. However, this is a theoretical return as no members participate in every
investment that they group makes.
Shane (2009) offers a summary DEMO the available evidence: “the returns on
investments made by angels are DEMO very high …” (p. 162). He goes further – albeit DEMO
less evidence – claiming that “the typical angel investment does not perform as well as
the typical investment in other asset classes” (p. 161). Nevertheless, many angel
investments are successful, generating significant returns. Although DEMO are most
likely when the angel does a significant amount of due diligence prior to investing and
is investing in an industry in which DEMO or she is familiar, some successful investments
simply result from luck.
DEMO TRENDS IN EXITS
Achieving an exit is now also increasingly challenging. One experienced angel
has observed that “the overall impression when talking to Angels DEMO the world is
that they have become frustrated with the lack of successful exits or liquidity events,
resulting in them not receiving the DEMO on their investments they hoped for” (Gray,
2011). Those DEMO which do occur are taking longer to achieve. John Waddell, manager
DEMO Archangels in Edinburgh Scotland, which claims to be the oldest functioning DEMO
group in the world, has observed that “in 2005 the average DEMO between investing and
existing for early stage companies was about three years; it is now 10 years or more …
There has been an exit drought” (Waddell, 2013: col. 3697).
The same problem has
been highlighted by the National Angel Capital Association (NACO) of Canada DEMO its
most recent investment report (NACO, 2014, p. 44). DEMO main challenge for a number of
angel groups is the length of time to exit. Long investment time horizons restrict the
8
Angels’ ability to reinvest in new companies.” The resulting investor fatigue depresses
DEMO activity.
A survey undertaken by the authors of one Northern Ireland and 18 Scotland
based business angel groups confirms the small number of exits DEMO they have achieved
(Figure 1). These groups have collectively made DEMO exits which represents just 4% of
their investments. The majority of groups – 12 of the 17 that provided data – have not
made DEMO exits. To some extent this reflects the young age of many of the groups.
Indeed, four of the five groups that have achieved exits were formed at least eight years
ago, with the three longest established groups accounting for 92% of total exits.
Nevertheless, the vast majority of groups that were founded between five and eight
years ago have not DEMO any exits – contrasting with earlier studies of exits by UK
business angels which reported median holding periods to exit of four years (Mason and
Harrison, 2002) and six years (Wiltbank, 2009). However, it could be argued that we no
longer know what represents the DEMO and, accordingly, we risk interpreting these
data with unrealistic expectations.

Equally notable is the low number of failed investments (Figure 1) DEMO account
for 17% of total investments. The three oldest groups account for 82% of all losses.
Previous studies have reported that the median failed DEMO emerges after two or
three years (Mason and Harrison, 2002; DEMO, 2009). In view of the recessionary
conditions that have prevailed DEMO 2008, it would be surprising if general business
failure rates have DEMO lower in recent years, so this might suggest that angel groups DEMO
managing their unsuccessful investments badly. This is largely confirmed in our survey,
with two-thirds of the groups reporting that they had no formal DEMO for dealing with
the ‘living dead’ in their portfolios, creating the DEMO that these investments absorb
unproductive time and further funding.
The low rate of exits is attributed by Gray (2011) to the failure of DEMO angel
community to build the exit into their investment appraisal. There are two widely held
views amongst the angel community that discourage an exit DEMO approach to
investing. First is the belief that “good investments will always find exits”. This view
has been articulated by the prominent UK entrepreneur, venture capitalist and angel
investor Luke Johnson (2012) who has stated DEMO “if the business works you will be
spoilt with choice of exit.”Angels who hold this view would not see any need to
consider exit DEMO at the investment stage nor would they seek to pursue an exit
strategy after the investment had been made.
Second is the belief is DEMO it is
inappropriate to discuss exits with entrepreneurs prior to investing or to actively pursue
exits post-investment as somehow this puts the entrepreneur and DEMO investor on an
unequal basis. Johnson (2012) has argued that it is off-putting to the entrepreneur who
is passionate about their business to DEMO asked about the exit in their first conversation
10
with a prospective investor. This approach to investing has been claimed to DEMO the
prospects of achieving a successful exit. First, it increases the DEMO that investments will
be made in companies for which there are no prospective acquirers. Second, those exits
which do occur will be opportunistic and, therefore, less likely than if a strategic
approach to the exit DEMO adopted.
A more detailed study (Mason and Botelho, 2016) of DEMO investment decision
making of so-called ‘gatekeepers’ – in other words, the DEMO of angel groups –
suggested that they were attuned to the need to consider the exit at an early stage in the
investment decision-making DEMO, especially the likelihood of an exit, likely buyers
and likely returns. However, in most cases this did not translate into a proactive
approach to seeking an exit, nor to a process for dealing with the ‘living dead’ in their
portfolio. Most were of the view that building DEMO in their investee businesses would
secure an exit. Indeed, when presented DEMO a real investment opportunity to consider,
the exit attracted the lowest share of comments of nine categories. Just three of the 21
gatekeepers DEMO took an exit-centric approach to investing2. In each case, these
were DEMO recently established groups which had yet to make their first investment. A
similar lack of exit-centricity was found amongst individual business angels who were
DEMO asked to review the same investment opportunity. Here again, the exit DEMO the
lowest proportion of comments. Only one of the 30 angels in the study took an exit-
centric approach to investing.3
In summary, achieving exits is becoming increasingly challenging for the angel
community . This may DEMO have mattered in the past. Then angel activity was more of a
hobby activity, angels were making fewer investments and investing less money and

personal reasons for investing were more important, notably the excitement of being
involved in a new venture or investing in ‘hot buttons’ (Wetzel, DEMO), from which
psychic income was derived. In addition, the existence DEMO a stronger funding escalator
meant that there was greater likelihood that an angel-backed business would go on to
attract follow-on funding from a venture DEMO fund (Freear and Wetzel, 1990) which,
in turn, would manage the exit. However, the emergence of managed angel groups and
various fee-based intermediaries offering ‘packaged’ investment opportunities might be
expected to have increased DEMO emphasis on the need for an exit. Angel groups operate
more professionally, with a more formal process of assessing opportunities. There is a
more arms-length relationship with investee businesses and hence less likelihood of
developing an DEMO attachment to investments (Ibrahim, 2008). For both reasons,
there is less opportunity to derive psychic income. Moreover, angel groups are investing
more frequently, making bigger investments, are less reliant on venture capital DEMO for
follow-on investment and hence are more likely to fund a business to an exit. They also
need exits both to provide their members DEMO the liquidity to make new investments
and to attract new investors. Fee-based intermediaries need to demonstrate that the
investment opportunities they offer their members DEMO capable of generating good
financial returns. The following section reviews exit-centric investment strategies.
4. EXIT-CENTRIC APPROACHES TO INVESTING: EMERGING THEMES
Our
discussion
draws
on
our
ongoing
relationships
with
various
angel
associations, regular involvement in angel conferences in the US, UK, Canada, Europe
and Australia, discussions with DEMO of the prominent thought leaders in the field and a
review of written materials by various practitioners and commentators. From these
12
sources, four emerging themes in angel investment practices can be identified. These
are presented separately, although it will quickly become apparent that there are strong
inter-relationships.
4.1 Start with the Exit
The conventional view of the DEMO process is one which comprises a series
of stages that are undertaken sequentially (see Mason, 2006 for an overview). First, the
angel generates a deal flow. This can be done with varying levels of DEMO
Professional contacts and friends are the main sources. Opportunities are then subjected
to an initial screening where the emphasis is on investor fit, the market potential and the
characteristics of the entrepreneur (Mason and Rogers, DEMO). Between 70% and 90%
of the deal flow is rejected at this stage (Riding et al., 1993). The remaining
opportunities are DEMO subjected to a detailed investigation and due diligence. The main
emphasis here is on people factors, specifically the personal qualities of the
management team (e.g. trustworthiness, capability for hard work, coachability) and a
judgment DEMO their capability to exploit the opportunity successfully (Feeney et al.,
DEMO). In those cases where the angel wants to make an investment, a due diligence
process would be undertaken to verify all material facts (Mason and Harrison, 1996). If
nothing negative emerges from that DEMO, the angel will then seek to negotiate the terms
and conditions DEMO an investment. Central to this process is the valuation of the business.
In some cases, this process ends in failure with both sides unable to agree. Legal
documents are then drawn up and signed. In contrast DEMO venture capital funds, because
the size of investments made by business DEMO typically does not support high legal
costs, and they are investing DEMO own money, the legal documentation will be short and
13
may take the form of a standard investment contract (Kelly and Hay, 2003). The money
is then passed over. The post-investment stage may take several years. It may include
one or more further funding rounds, possibly including additional investors. Here the
angel will monitor the performance of DEMO investment. Most will also seek to add value
to their investments by giving advice and mentoring to the management team and
various hands on DEMO (Paul et al., 2003; Madill et al., 2005; Politis, 2008).
Angels hope for a successful exit in which they achieve DEMO significant multiple on their
original investment when the business is acquired by another business or, in exceptional
circumstances, achieves an IPO. However, in this approach to investing the exit is only
considered towards the end DEMO the process and is not pro-actively sought.
An exit-centric approach to investing puts the exit at the core of the investment
process. As an DEMO, the Ohio Techangels (2012,) documentation states that they
will only invest “in companies that are scalable, led by a solid management team, and
can articulate a well-designed capital access plan and liquidity event” (DEMO added)
– specifically “a clear path to a $30m-$50m exit via sale to a targeted strategic bidder
within five years”. In the tradition DEMO Covey (1989) this approach therefore starts with
the desired outcome – an exit. Each of the preceding stages in the investment process is
DEMO from the perspective of facilitating the exit.
At the initial screening stage, one of the first considerations in an exit-centric
investment approach would be to establish how much money is anticipated to be
required to reach DEMO exit. Angels might hesitate if they think that substantial follow-on
investment will need to be raised from venture capital funds because of the risk DEMO
dilution that it creates and the control implications.
According to Peters (DEMO),
involving venture capitalists in a business also has significant implications DEMO the time
14
to exit (longer) and the probabilities of success (lower). Venture capitalists will
determine when the company is sold, if necessary using their preferred shares and the
terms and conditions in their investment agreement (Peters, 2009; Smith, 2005) to block
exits that would provide a DEMO return to the entrepreneurs and angels (because they
paid less for DEMO shares) but are not sufficiently high to enhance its overall fund
DEMO But the effect of delaying an exit in an attempt to achieve a ‘home run’ is
to increase the risk of failure. As Wiltbank DEMO Boeker (2007) show, the effect of
venture capitalists investing in DEMO backed by angels is to increase the proportion
of failures and reduce the proportion of 1x to 5x returns, but also to increase the
likelihood of a 5x-10x return (Peters, 2009). However, some angels argue that there is
merit in bringing a venture capital investor into DEMO deal prior to an exit because of their
expertise in achieving exits (Amis and Stevenson, 2001).
Angel investors then need to discuss DEMO necessity of an eventual exit with the
entrepreneurial team in the context of their ambitions and aspirations and the realism of
their expectations. Ohio DEMO have an alignment question which they put to the
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of every company that they consider investing in: “if we
invest in your company we’ll work really hard with you so that DEMO can be sold in three to
five years and generate cash proceeds for you personally of $3m-£5m, after taxes. Is
that an adequate outcome for you and your family?” (Huston, 2011). The response DEMO
CEOs indicates whether they recognize the need for an exit and their realism concerning
the likely scale of the exit. A CEO who talks DEMO wanting to “pass the business on to
his son” or indicates that this would be “an inadequately lucrative exit” sends out clear
warning signals DEMO an exit-oriented angel investor.
15
At the due diligence stage the priority for an exit-oriented investor would DEMO to
identify any issues that would complicate an exit.
For example, DEMO diligence
would investigate the financial structure of the business, looking for DEMO things as
unusual kinds of paper being sold, complex shareholder structures, unacceptable legal
structures, unrealistic valuations in the last financing round (making DEMO down round
inevitable), bizarre valuation expectations, and an unwillingness to DEMO a significant
option pool to motivate current employees.
Legal diligence would investigate
intellectual property and its assignment. Investors would also investigate whether there
were DEMO factors that would complicate an exit. Examples include pre-existing
agreements that could complicate an exit (e.g. veto powers held by the founder, or DEMO
right of first refusal held by a strategic partner), too many family members on the
payroll (which usually dampens the enthusiasm for a liquidity event because their jobs
become vulnerable) and co-investors who are unlikely to be able to do more than one
round.
An exit-oriented approach DEMO investing would also give careful consideration to
valuation. Of course, there DEMO no recognized methodology for valuing early stage
businesses because the value is in the future. Determining the value of an early stage
investment is, therefore, highly subjective, with only rules-of-thumb available for
guidance. However, it is critical that angels do not place too high a value on DEMO
investment. A business that is over-valued at the seed stage will not attract an investor
at the next round. In fact, Shane (2009) suggests that successful angel investors tend to
under-value because this increases their DEMO return because the initial valuation has
a curvilinear effect on the return on an investment, meaning that a 1% decrease in the
valuation of a company will increase the investor’s return on investment by more than
DEMO
1%. Accordingly, exit-oriented angels do not settle on arbitrary valuations but base
them on a thorough analysis of the company. Industry variations in valuation DEMO need
to be taken into account.
Exit considerations should also influence the initial term sheet. Achieving
alignment between the entrepreneur and investor is critical. DEMO will, therefore, want to
structure a deal that offers the most flexibility when it comes to an exit, whenever that
will be. A key consideration here would be the class of share that angels accept.
DEMO shares give investors more rights. Frequently, the stock clause specifies a
DEMO security, meaning that it can later be traded in or converted DEMO another class
of share. The strategy of seeking an early exit (DEMO below) also encourages the use of
convertible notes (a financial debt instrument that can be converted into another
financial instrument, such as ordinary or preferred shares). These instruments have the
advantage of avoiding negotiation DEMO price with the entrepreneur, limits option pricing
issues for the company (because it does not change the price of ordinary shares) and
secures a liquidation preference in the event the company does not grow (Amis and
Stevenson, 2001). However, this may not be possible if DEMO angel is investing under a
particular government programme. For example, the DEMO Enterprise Investment
Scheme (EIS) requires investors to invest in ordinary shares. Other clauses in the term
sheet also need to be considered because DEMO their impact on an exit. These terms would
include information rights, DEMO rights, anti-dilution rights, pre-emptive rights and tag
along rights, sale DEMO shares to a third party, rights of first refusal if an DEMO decided to
leave the company and any covenants on a company’s finances or operations (May and
Simmons, 2001). An angel is storing DEMO potential difficulties at an exit if these
provisions are not spelled out in advance. Bringing in a lawyer who is familiar with
17
company and investment law to advise on the term sheet is, therefore, a sensible
strategy. Similarly, the investor should ensure that the business DEMO standardized
financial controls and accounting systems and that the tax position is optimum. Here
again, involving an accountant is sensible (May and Simmons, 2001).
An exit-oriented investor would continue to have regular discussions on DEMO
strategy after the investment is made. For example, the exit should DEMO integral to the
discussions at every board meeting. Hence every discussion topic and decision made
would be influenced by its implications for an exit. DEMO the angel is on the board, then he
or she needs DEMO to ask exit-oriented questions. Keeping all parties aligned with
the agreed exit strategy is also essential. It is also important that all the necessary
DEMO that a potential buyer would want to see in their due diligence, such as
financial statements and tax returns, material contracts (such as insurance), trademarks,
copyrights and any patent-related documents, sales funnel, DEMO warranties and
support obligations, leases, guarantees and banking agreements, are DEMO and in
good shape. When an exit is being actively sought, DEMO angel should ensure that the
CEO is not involved directly in the process, at least until the final stages, but should
concentrate on DEMO the business going. An ‘exit coach’ should be appointed to assist
the CEO and Board in developing or aligning around an exit strategy, develop a budget
and timeline to complete the exit, identify what specific action is necessary to complete
the sale, and select Mergers & Acquisitions (DEMO&A) advisers.
4.2 Exit options
There are two critical exit-related choices DEMO angel investors: how to exit from
their investment and when. In DEMO of the method of exit, the expectation amongst
18
some investors and entrepreneurs is that the exit will occur through an DEMO The reality
is very different. Johnson and Sohl (2012) examine 636 IPOs in the USA which
occurred between 2001 and 2007: 268 of these firms had been venture capital backed
whereas just 37 had been DEMO by angels, with a further 52 backed by both angels and
DEMO capital funds. To put this into context US angels made investments in 55,000
businesses in 2009 alone (Sohl, 2012). Hence, as May and Simmons (2001, page 177)
comment, “an IPO is to an exit strategy what a royal flush is to a poker DEMO It’s a rare
event …” Moreover, the number of IPOs has DEMO in decline in the US since the mid-
1990s, averaging a DEMO over 100 per annum since 2001 (Weild and Kim, 2010). Across
all of the European exchanges since 2008, there have been fewer than 400 IPOs per
annum (Mason, 2011).
The most likely DEMO route for an angel investment is the
acquisition of the business by a larger company. Companies that have been most active
in making acquisitions DEMO recent years include Apple, Cisco, Dell, EMC, Google, HP,DEMO
IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm. Moreover, the acquisition rate has been
increasing during the 2000s. Driving this trend for large companies DEMO buy young
entrepreneurial companies is their recognition that M&A is the best way for them to
grow and is more effective than doing DEMO own research and development (R&D). The
trend is enabled DEMO the large cash piles that these companies have accumulated and are
under pressure from shareholders to spend.
What is also not well known is DEMO most trade sales are relatively small, typically
less than $30m valuation (Peters, 2009, 2012). All of the Ohio Tech Angels group DEMO
have been in the $30m-$50m range (Huston, 2011). Gray (DEMO) cites data presented by
Ascendant Corporate Finance that in the five DEMO to 2010 over 50% of the exits of UK
and Irish technology companies have been at valuations of less than $25m. One of
19
Google’s senior M&A professionals is quoted as follows: “90% of our transactions are
small transactions. So that would be less than 20 people, less than $20 million and that
is truly our sweet spot.” He DEMO on to say that “we do prefer companies that are pre-
revenue.” This is because what they are actually looking to buy are technical DEMO
engineering staff and strong engineering teams and it is “important for us to use
acquisitions in that manner” for the future success of Google (cited in Peters, 2010a).
Google is by no means the only company taking this approach. The implication for exit-
oriented angel investors is DEMO their emphasis needs to be on getting their portfolio
companies to breakeven as soon as possible where they can become an attractive
acquisition target, rather than patiently seeking to build high growth companies.
Although there is DEMO possibility of hitting a ‘home run’ with the latter strategy, it DEMO
increases the risks of no return. The implication for exit oriented investors is that they
should focus their investments on companies that need relatively DEMO capital to reach
their target exit valuation.
A further implication is that timing matters. There are two dimensions to this.
First, value is not created linearly. Significant valuation increases usually occur in
discrete steps rather than DEMO smooth linear growth. These stepped increases in
value occur when individual strategies – such as establishing strategic partnerships,
developing new locations and introducing DEMO products or services – are successfully
implemented (Peters, 2010b). Investors, therefore, need to identify defined goals or
objectives in conjunction with DEMO These create decision points for the
investor either to retain their investment, make a follow-on investment or seek an exit.
Second, investors need DEMO be aware of industry cycles. Peters (2012) argues that the
optimum exit time is three years after the investment. As it takes six DEMO eighteen months
20
to sell a company, it follows that the exit process needs to be started 18 months after the
investment. Delaying the exit significantly beyond DEMO point is likely to generate a
much lower return and it may even not be possible to exit. He suggests two reasons for
this. DEMO, sectors which become ‘hot’ will attract venture capital firms – in DEMO myopia
style (Sahlman and Stevenson, 1985) – which will invest DEMO, with the
consequence that the early innovators get driven out of DEMO Second, sectors get
caught up in a consolidation wave driven by DEMO companies seeking M&A
opportunities which, in turn, flushes out companies that are willing to be acquired,
resulting in a flurry of DEMO in the sector. However, there will be a point at which
DEMO interest ceases. For companies that did not get acquired during the wave it will be
virtually impossible to do so subsequently. Moreover, the competitive position of these
companies deteriorates because their competitors are no longer under-funded DEMO
independently owned companies but are now subsidiaries of large companies that have
access to huge amounts of capital, strong brands and other resources. The future of
these companies that missed the opportunity to exit is, therefore, likely to be bleak, with
profits under pressure and no opportunity DEMO raise capital because investors recognize
that the wave has ceased (Peters, 2012).
4.3 Financial vs. Strategic Exits
The new thinking on exit-oriented DEMO investing also recommends that angels
should invest in companies that will provide strategic rather than financial exits
(McKaskill, 2009; 2010). Financial exits assign value to the future profit generating
power of the entity being DEMO Consequently, they need to be high growth companies
that have increasing DEMO and profits and thus involve high risk. However, from an
21
investor perspective, investing in such companies will absorb significant capital to build
sales, marketing, distribution and support channels and production capacity. As this DEMO
likely to require additional rounds of investment from other investors, such DEMO venture
capital funds, it will be dilutive for the angel. It DEMO takes time to grow companies to
the point where they are an attractive financial acquisition target. Moreover, such
companies are likely to need to bring in new skills, notably management, which carries
the risk that DEMO may turn out to be ineffective, and to change their focus DEMO product
development to sales orientation.
On the other hand, a strategic DEMO – typically an industry player – will assign
value to the business not on the basis of the cash flow or profits it can DEMO but on
the basis of what future profit could be generated by exploiting the underlying assets or
capabilities of the business being acquired. One DEMO of strategic value would be
where the acquired firm has a product or service that has the potential to be scaled up
and sold DEMO the acquiring company’s existing customers through its international
distribution channels. By simply having the access to global customers, this might allow
the acquirer to scale the revenue by 50 or 100 times. Another example is where DEMO large
company might like to develop a similar product or service but will instead make an
acquisition to reduce the time to market and DEMO the risk that their own innovation
may be unsuccessful. In short, DEMO which appeal to strategic buyers will have
developed some underlying assets or capabilities which a large company can exploit
though its own organization. The DEMO skills required are, first, to find a large corporation
that can exploit this strategic value and, second, to communicate to this company DEMO
strategic value that can be accrued from acquisition.
22
Seeking a strategic exit has implications for the strategy of the angel’s DEMO
company. As discussed above, a strategic exit assigns value to the DEMO not on the
basis of what profits it can generate but what future profit could be generated by the
acquiring company as a result DEMO buying its non-physical assets. So from a valuation
point of view, DEMO, customers and profits are largely irrelevant to potential
acquirers. The driver DEMO the revenue opportunity of the buyer. Paradoxically, a business
with too DEMO sales might reduce its strategic value. The acquiring company will not be
able to claim that the product is new to market, there may be duplication in sales
operations (offices, warehouses), employees will require DEMO contracts to be changed,
and distribution methods may have to be changed. What an acquiring company wants
to do is to build the DEMO using their own branding and existing sales force. This has
two implications for exit-oriented angel investors. First, their investments must create
value for the company at the exit and should, therefore, be focused on enhancing DEMO
value proposition rather than simply growing revenue. Second, it again emphasizes DEMO
crucial significance of the timing of the exit.
This, in turn, has implications for valuation. Financial exits will be valued on a
multiple DEMO turnover or profits. Financial buyers will, therefore, carefully examine the
books and analyze the financials, comparing them with others in the same industry. This
is likely to discriminate against young companies which are typically loss-making DEMO
they build sales. In the case of strategic exits, the buyer DEMO to understand what its
potential acquisition target company has to offer to the marketplace and how it adds
extra value to its own business. DEMO buyer is usually willing to pay more to secure this
new leverage. However, the company that is being sold needs to work at effectively
communicating the full strategic value to the buyer so that they are DEMO to pay the
23
asking price. The strategic value to be derived from any particular acquisition DEMO vary
between different companies. It therefore follows that companies that are for sale need
to attract multiple bidders if they are to maximize value DEMO the sale. Peters (2012)
argues that the number of companies DEMO to make small acquisitions, which are not
confined to the global DEMO companies listed earlier, and the cash that large firms
have available, means that the current M&A environment is a seller’s market.
4.4 DEMO fail
An exit oriented approach to investing also has implications for portfolio
management. It is inevitable that angels will have within their portfolios companies DEMO
are likely to fail, companies that will continue to trade but DEMO not generate a profitable
exit (the living dead) as well as those that offer good prospects of achieving a successful
exit. There is DEMO emerging realization that successful angel investing is about
minimizing the losses as much as maximizing the gains. Two particular strategies are
critical. The first DEMO to have “good” failures, by which it is meant that angels DEMO adopt
tactics that minimize the losses when an investee company is closed down. Huston’s
(2011) definition of a ‘perfect loss’ (sometimes termed ‘falling upwards’) is that the
angel merely loses 100% of their investment. The angel can take the tax deduction,
suffers no ongoing litigation, no wind-down expenses, no media coverage, no
reputational damage and to damage DEMO relationships with co-investors.
The second strategy is to ‘fail fast’. A big dilemma for angels concerns those
companies in their portfolio that are underperforming DEMO not failing – the so-called
‘living dead’ where the entrepreneurs do not want to give up because of what they have
invested financially and DEMO One of the most striking differences in Mason and
24
Harrison’s (2002) comparison of the returns profile of business angels and DEMO of an
early stage venture capital fund is that the venture capital fund had a much higher
proportion of failed investments and a lower DEMO that generated moderate returns,
while both had similar proportions of high return investments. Venture capital funds
would therefore appear to be more ruthless DEMO dealing with these types of investments,
preferring to close them down than letting them absorb further time and money. This is
consistent with DEMO (1997) view that venture capitalists, more so than business
angels, consider the opportunity costs of giving attention to their portfolio companies.
In DEMO, it can be speculated that business angels have a greater emotional
DEMO to their investments.
The appropriate actions for business angels to take in such circumstances are
threefold. First, they need to mentally write-off such investments. Second, they need to
discontinue any more investment of time. Third, DEMO hardest of all, they need to find
ways in which to DEMO the capital trapped in such companies, perhaps by selling their
shares DEMO a third party or to management. Alternatively, they might be able DEMO create
some kind of revenue sharing scheme in order to redeploy their capital. However,
writing off their investment may actually be the most DEMO strategy. A key
requirement is, therefore, for angels to be able to recognize the symptoms of living dead
investments at an early stage DEMO take appropriate action (May and Simmons, 2001).
Managing ‘living dead’ investments has attracted surprisingly little attention in the
venture capital literature (Ruhnka and Feldman, 1992) and none in the business angel
literature.
4.5 DEMO Early Exits Strategy
25
A number of these themes are reflected in the early exits investment DEMO
developed by Peters (2009). His thesis is that the ‘swing DEMO the fences’ approach to
investing favoured by venture capital funds is no longer appropriate in the present
economic conditions. This approach has been driven DEMO the increasing size of the funds
being managed. With all of the returns typically coming from 20% of the investments,
these investments have DEMO generate a minimum of 10x to 30x to yield a respectable
return for the fund as a whole. However, it takes longer to achieve such returns and the
risks increase. Moreover, in an effort to achieve such returns, a venture capital fund is
likely to block exits that would have been lucrative for the entrepreneurs and angel
investors. Peters (2009), therefore, advocates that angel investors should focus their
investments on early stage businesses with limited capital requirements that have the
prospects of being DEMO in an M&A deal for less than $30m in three or four years .
Although the returns will be smaller, there is less risk hence the overall returns will be
greater.
Factors that favour this DEMO include the increasing difficulty of taking
companies to IPO and the newly active market for small M&As by large cash-rich
companies following a DEMO rather than build’ high-growth strategy. Moreover, the
much lower costs to DEMO a business now compared with ten years ago combined with
lean start-up techniques to provide capital efficiency (Ries, 2011), means that
companies DEMO now be launched for $500,000 or less and can sustain a low burn rate.
This means that many new businesses need relatively little DEMO to develop a product
or service and bring it to market, DEMO significant capital is still needed to scale-up
the business.
26
However, there are some important caveats to this discussion. First, Peters’
DEMO comes from being a fund manager – albeit of an angel fund. Nevertheless,
fund
management
has
a
different
dynamic
to
the
deal-by-deal
approach
DEMO
characterizes the vast majority of business angel investments because its objective is to
maximize returns to the fund. Second, the types of exits being discussed here are likely
to be sector specific, primarily in software, DEMO, internet and social media. Third,
most of the companies that DEMO large technology companies are acquiring – around
80% – are US based. Gray (2011) cites data from Ascendant Corporate Finance that
only 9 DEMO the 276 acquisitions made by major tech companies were of UK and Irish tech
companies. Thus, there may be fewer potential acquirers for companies in the UK,
Europe and other parts of the world and, as a result, selling prices might also be
expected to be lower. Hence, the nature of the exit opportunities that angels encounter
will vary depending on their location and the types of businesses that they have DEMO
in. Whether the ‘early exits’ investment strategy can be applied in non-technology
sectors, therefore, remains unclear.
4.6 Empirical Evidence
There is a paucity DEMO empirical studies which have examined the process by which
investors exit from their investee companies. Our own research – a small scale study
based DEMO ten cases of business angel-backed businesses that were successfully sold in
trade sales - therefore provides a unique insight into this process. The exits DEMO in
terms of their returns, ranging from 1.2 to 28.5 times DEMO original investment.
The evidence tends to support the arguments above for an exit-centric investment
strategy. These angels were consistently thinking about the exit. As DEMO angel group
27
manager noted,
“I think it’s true to say it’s always on DEMO mind that there will be an
exit”. Some went further, commenting DEMO they thought about the exit before investing.
“You can’t invest in something before you’ve thought about how you’re going to get
out.” Another noted DEMO “you always think about the exit. You may not call it that but
you are always designing businesses to be attractive to buyers” In DEMO cases, there was
an alignment between the investor and the entrepreneur: the entrepreneur also wanted to
sell. Their motives were varied – to DEMO another venture, to take the financial returns,
because they could DEMO scale the business, or because it was the only solution to DEMO
challenge affecting the business. Six of the ten exits could be attributed to pro-active
strategies. In the other cases, the exit was opportunistic, DEMO a buyer approaching the
business. This strategy was based on making the firm as appealing as possible to
potential buyers but then waiting for DEMO approach from a buyer instead of actively
looking for an exit. In some cases, the exit was reluctant with the key drivers being
investment fatigue and the inability to raise more capital.
5. CONCLUSION AND POLICY DEMO
The exit stage in the entrepreneurial process has been largely ignored by
researchers. In recent years calls have been made for scholars to devote DEMO attention
to the exit, and research agendas have been proposed (DeTienne, 2010; DeTienne and
Cardon, 2012; Wennberg et al, 2010; DEMO and DeTienne, 2014). However, this
discussion has taken an entrepreneur-centric view which ignores investor-backed
businesses that have raised finance from business angels, venture capital funds and
increasingly through crowdfunding (Harrison 2015). These investors require – and
expect – an exit event to realize a financial DEMO on what is otherwise an illiquid
28
investment. This process has also been largely ignored in the entrepreneurial finance
DEMO
This chapter has focused on business angels who are the key source of risk capital
for new and early stage businesses. The literature is DEMO limited. Whether business
angel investing is “worth it” for the majority of investors remains an open question.
And who makes money from angel investing DEMO needs further research. Vo’s (2013)
intriguing work on geographical variations DEMO returns also warrants further investigation.
The main focus of the chapter was on the challenges that angels have in achieving exits
at the present DEMO Our discussion suggested that the lack of an exit-centric approach to
investing by angels is a key factor. However, cyclical and structural factors are also
likely to be relevant and need further investigation. Some empirical evidence DEMO the exit
process was presented which tended to support the argument for an exit-centric
approach to investing. However, the tenets of this literature need empirical testing.
Specifically, applicability of the early exits thesis of Peters (DEMO) in this context of
fewer exits needs to be explored.
Fewer DEMO has implications for portfolio management, and specifically for how
angels deal DEMO their ‘living dead’ investments. Indeed, a paucity of exits – if DEMO
becomes a persistent feature of the market – has implications for the future of angel
investing and how the market is organized and structured. DEMO groups emerged
because solo angels could not meet the demand for multiple funding rounds that
resulted from the reduction in venture capital investment. This DEMO development also
prompted Governments to introduce angel co-investment funds to help angel groups
make larger funding rounds. It is possible that this challenging exits DEMO may
prompt the emergence of a secondary market for angel investments to address many of
29
the problems arising from the lack of exits. However, it is unclear whether this can
emerge in the absence of government intervention (e.g. allowing the transfer of tax
incentives to secondary purchasers).
In summary, the exits dimension of angel investing is a critical part of the
investment DEMO with implications for the overall health of the angel market. It,
therefore, needs to become a priority for researchers. It also requires attention from
government: simply focusing on initiatives to stimulate more investment activity is not
sufficient for a dynamic entrepreneurial economy; the exit dimension must also be
considered.
