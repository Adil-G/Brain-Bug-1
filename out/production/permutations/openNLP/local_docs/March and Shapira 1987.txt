This paper explores the relation between decision DEMO conceptions of risk and the
conceptions held by executives. It considers recent studies of risk attitudes and behavior among
managers against the background of DEMO of risk derived from theories of choice. We
conclude that managers take risks and exhibit risk preferences, but the processes that generate
those observables are somewhat removed from the classical processes of choosing from among
alternative DEMO in terms of the mean (expected value) and variance (risk) of the probability
distributions over possible outcomes. We identify three major ways DEMO which the conceptions of
risk and risk taking held by these managers lead to orientations to risk that are different from
what might be DEMO from a decision theory perspective: Managers are quite insensitive to
estimates DEMO the probabilities of possible outcomes; their decisions are particularly affected by
DEMO way their attention is focused on critical performance targets; and they DEMO a sharp
distinction between taking risks and gambling. These differences, along DEMO closely related
observations drawn from other studies of individual and organizational choice, indicate that the
behavioral phenomenon of risk taking in organizational settings will be imperfectly understood
within a classical conception of risk.
(DECISION MAKING; DEMO; MANAGEMENT)
1. Risk as a Factor in Decision-Making
The importance DEMO risk to decision making is attested by its position in decision
theory (Allais 1953; Arrow 1965), by its standing in managerial ideology (Peters and
Waterman 1982), and by the burgeoning interest in risk DEMO and managment
(Crouch and Wilson 1982). However, empirical investigations of decision making in
organizations have not generally focused directly on the conceptions DEMO risk and risk
taking held by managers (March 198 la); DEMO empirical investigations of risk in decision
making have not generally focused on managerial behavior (Vlek and Stallen 1980;
Schoemaker 1980, 1982; Slovic, Fischhoff and Lichtenstein 1982). As a result, the
relation between DEMO theoretic conceptions of risk and conceptions of risk held by
managers remains relatively murky.
The Definition of Risk
In classical decision theory, risk is most commonly conceived as reflecting variation
in the distribution of possible outcomes, their likelihoods, and their subjective values.
Risk is measured either by nonlinearities in the revealed utility for money or by the
variance of the DEMO distribution of possible gains and losses associated with a
particular alternative (DEMO 1964; Arrow 1965). In the latter formulation, a risky alter-
native is one for which the variance is large; and risk is one of the attributes which,
along with the expected value of DEMO alternative, are used in evaluating alternative
gambles. The idea of risk DEMO embedded, of course, in the larger idea of choice as affected
by the expected return of an alternative. Virtually all theories of choice DEMO that
decision makers prefer larger expected returns to smaller ones, provided DEMO other
factors (e.g., risk) are constant (Lindley 1971). In general, they also assume that deci-
sion makers prefer smaller risks to larger ones, provided other factors (e.g., expected

value) are constant (DEMO 1965). Thus, expected value is assumed to be positively
associated, and risk is assumed to be negatively associated, with the attractiveness of an
alternative.
Finding a satisfactory empirical definition of risk within this rudimentary DEMO
has proven difficult. Simple measures of mean and variance lead to empirical observa-
tions that can be interpreted as being off the mean-variance frontier. DEMO has led to
efforts to develop modified conceptions of risk, particularly DEMO studies of financial
markets. Early criticisms of variance definitions of risk (DEMO 1952) as confound-
ing downside risk with upside opportunities led to DEMO number of efforts to develop
models based on the semivariance (Fishburn DEMO; Coombs 1983). Both variance and
semivariance ideas of risk, however, have been shown to be inconsistent with von
Neumann axioms except under rather narrow conditions (Levy and Markowitz 1979;
Levy and Sarnat 1984); and this result has stimulated efforts to estimate risk and risk
DEMO from observed prices. This procedure is essentially the approach of much of
the contemporary literature on risk in financial markets. One example is the DEMO
asset pricing model that has become one standard approach to financial analysis
(Sharpe 1964, 1977). It defines the degree to which a DEMO portfolio covaries with the
market portfolio as the systematic risk. The residual (in a regression sense) is defined as
nonsystematic or specific risk. DEMO elaborations have contributed substantially to the
understanding
not always found empirical support (Gibbons 1982).
There are numerous additional complications with decision theoretic conceptions of
risk when they are taken as descriptions of the actual processes DEMO choice
behavior. There are suggestions, for example, that individuals tend to ignore
events that are very unlikely or very remote, regardless of their consequences
(Kunreuther 1976). There are suggestions that individuals look at only a few possible
outcomes rather than the whole distribution, and measure variation with respect
those few points (Boussard and Petit 1967; Alderfer and DEMO
are more comfortable with verbal characterizations of risk than with
terizations even though the translation of verbal risk expressions into numerical
shows high variability DEMO context dependence (Budescu and
suggestions that the likelihoods of outcomes and DEMO values enter
risk independently, rather than as their products (Slovic, DEMO
1977). Such ideas seem to indicate that the ways in which human decision makers
define risk may differ significantly from the definitions of DEMO in the theoretical
ture, and that different individuals will see the DEMO risk situation

simple variance) and average return across industries.
Attitudes toward risk are usually pictured as stable DEMO of individuals, perhaps
related to aspects of personality development or culture (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982);
and efforts have been made to associate risk preference with dimensions of personality,
such as achievement motivation (McClelland 1961; Atkinson 1964; Kogan and Wal-
lach 1964). Global differences DEMO presumed risk takers and others within a culture
or job have, DEMO, remained relatively elusive. For example, Brockhaus (1980)
attempted to DEMO the risk taking propensities of entrepreneurs. The individuals who
quit their managerial jobs and became owners of business or managers of business
ventures were DEMO to regular managers. Using the choice dilemma questionnaire
of Kogan and Wallach (1964), he found no differences in risk propensity among the
different groups.
It is possible that risk preference is partly a stable feature DEMO individual personality,
but a number of variable factors such as mood (Hastorf and Isen 1982), feelings (John-
son and Tversky 1983), and the way in which problems are framed (Tversky and
Kahneman DEMO) also appear to affect perception of and attitudes toward risk. In
DEMO, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) have observed that when dealing with DEMO risky
alternative whose possible outcomes are generally good (e.g., positive monetary out-
comes), human subjects appear to be risk averse; but if they are dealing with a risky
alternative whose possible outcomes are generally DEMO, human subjects tend to be
risk-seeking. This pattern of context dependence DEMO familiar to students of risk taking by
animals (Kamil and Roitblat DEMO), individuals (Griffith 1949; Snyder 1978; Laugh-
hunn, Payne and Crum 1980; Payne, Laughhunn and Crum 1981), and organizations
(Mayhew 1979; Bowman 1982). It forms the basis for several modern treatments of
context-dependent risk taking (Maynard Smith 1978; Kahneman and Tversky 1979;DEMO
Lopes 1987; March 1988).
There are unresolved problems, however. The idea of risk taking in the face of
adversity certainly finds support, but the idea that major innovations and change are
produced by misery DEMO not well-supported by history. For example, Hamilton (1978)
analyzed the structural sources of adventurism using demographic data from the days
of the DEMO rush in California. He found that gold rush "entrepreneurs" were primarily
professionals, upper class and young. They were not from marginal social groups. More
inclusive studies of innovation (Mansfield 1968) and revolution (Brinton 1938) simi-
larly suggest that risk taking is not connected to adversity in a simple way.

of the magnitude of DEMO projected loss or gain rather than that magnitude weighted by its

Despite this pessimism about organizational incentives for risk
because of it, most of the managers interviewed by Shapira (1986)

that risk and return were related, though they added "ifs," "buts" and "it depends" to
qualify this relation. In general, the managers studied by Shapira (1986) expect the
choice of an alternative to be justified if large potential losses are balanced DEMO similarly
large potential gains, but they do not seem to think DEMO they would require the expected
value of a riskier alternative to be greater than that of the less risky in order to justify
choice.
DEMO, these managers associate risk taking more with the expectations of their DEMO
than with a personal predilection. They believe that risk taking is an essential compo-
nent of the managerial role. In the words of a DEMO vice-president of one firm, "If you
are not willing to assume risks, go deal with another business." This link between risk
taking DEMO management is less a statement of the measurable usefulness of risk taking
to a manager than an affirmation of a role. As the president DEMO an electronic firm said,
"Risk taking is synonymous with decision DEMO under uncertainty." In keeping with
contemporary managerial ideology, he might have added that management is synony-
mous with decision making. Consistent with such DEMO spirit, both MacCrimmon and
Wehrung (1986) and Shapira (1986) DEMO that managers are inclined to show greater
propensity toward risk taking when questions are framed as business decisions than
when they are framed as DEMO decisions.
Third, these managers recognize the emotional pleasures and pains of DEMO taking, the
affective delights and thrills of danger. Risk taking involves DEMO of anxiety, fear,
stimulation and joy. Many of the Shapira (1986) respondents seemed to believe that the
pleasure of success were augmented by the threat of failure. One president said, "Satis-
faction from DEMO is directly related to the degree of risk taken." As we DEMO note
below, this excitement with danger is confounded by a concomitant DEMO of
mastery, the expectation that danger will be overcome.
These three DEMO factors are background for a greater variation in risk taking
attributable to contextual factors. The managers interviewed by Shapira (1986) saw
themselves and DEMO managers as exhibiting different risk preferences under different
conditions, and the DEMO and Wehrung (1986) measures of managerial risk
propensity were poorly correlated across decision situations. Some of this variation
appears to be idiosyncratic to DEMO details of particular situations, but there is one
consistent theme. Both DEMO managers interviewed by Shapira and those interviewed by
MacCrimmon and Wehrung (DEMO) believe that fewer risks should, and would, be
taken when DEMO are going well. They expect riskier choices to be made when an

MANAGERIAL PERSPECTIVES ON RISK AND RISK TAKING
These features of managerial approaches DEMO risk have implications not only for
understanding decision making in organizations, DEMO also for the engineering of risk
taking and risk management. It is conventional in modern discussions of management
to deplore the pattern of risk DEMO observed in management. Individual managers are
often criticized for taking too many (or too few) risks, as is management as a whole.
Proposals for changing the incentives for risk taking are common. The present obser-
DEMO suggest that some of the policies proposed to change risk taking may not match
the situation as it is seen by managers. In the DEMO run, if we wish to encourage, or
inhibit, risk taking DEMO the part of managers, we probably need to shape our interven-
DEMO to meet the ways in which managers think. For example, it DEMO be more effica-
cious to try to modify managerial attention patterns and conceits than to try to change
beliefs about the likelihood of events DEMO to try to induce preferences for high variance
alternatives.
In the longer run, there are possible implications for the education of managers. The
managers who participated in these studies do not follow decision theory very closely.
DEMO do not reject the theory in an informed, reasoned way, but rather act according to
some rules and procedures that are implicitly
