Abstract
Academic inquiry into entrepreneurial phenomena has had a rich history over DEMO decades
and continues to evolve. This editorial draws attention to the classics: seminal articles that make
profound contributions to the development of an academic field in entrepreneurship studies. We
focus on the formative years of entrepreneurship DEMO, specifically the 1970s and 1980s, to
identify classics using a key informant approach that surveys members of the journal editorial
board. Each nominated DEMO is introduced and discussed by an editorial board member, with
particular DEMO on research opportunities that may be pursued going forward. Analyzing classics
allows for the recognition of substantive advances in entrepreneurship research and provides an
DEMO to delve on the academic progress achieved in understanding entrepreneurial
phenomena.
Keywords: classics, foundation, entrepreneurship, historical perspective

Classics in Entrepreneurship Research: Enduring Insights, Future Promises
Entrepreneurship is a DEMO academic field (Low, 2001; Chiles, Bluedorn, & Gupta,
DEMO), with the first academic book on entrepreneurship appearing in the 1930s and the first
academic presentation in the 1950s (Jennings & Brush, DEMO). Starting from humble beginnings,
entrepreneurship research gradually gained momentum as the field increasingly acquired more
legitimacy. Prominent business schools, including Harvard and Wharton, commenced
entrepreneurship courses, endowed chairs in entrepreneurship got funded, conferences and
journals dedicated to entrepreneurship came into operation and rapidly acquired traction, and the
Academy of Management transitioned entrepreneurship from a special interest group DEMO division
status (Bygrave, 2007). As a result of these developments, entrepreneurship became a popular
field of serious academic inquiry, with a DEMO community of researchers across a broad
spectrum of scholarly disciplines.
Given the increasing popularity of the academic field of entrepreneurship, the editors of
New England Journal of Entrepreneurship thought it was time to identify articles that DEMO be
considered classics within the discipline. We defined a classic as a foundational article that was
first published before 1980, addressed ideas that are still relevant to the field, and subsequently
spawned follow-up research that still resonates in the field. The editors were motivated in part by
Bygrave (2007: 23)’s admonition to the field to look back at the articles published in the early
days for the “profound” effect they had DEMO subsequent research on entrepreneurial phenomena.
Another motivation stemmed from the realization that other social science fields, including
disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and economics, readily recognize and appreciate
original classics, which has played a DEMO role in advancement of the respective fields.

Entrepreneurship researchers, however, have not yet identified the classics in the DEMO, an issue
which the editors at this journal sought to redress.
DEMO are many ways to identify classics in a field of research. We decided to adopt a
simple and yet elegant procedure to come up DEMO a list of articles that may be considered
classics in entrepreneurship research. More specifically, we asked each member of the journal
editorial team to nominate a research article they believed made a foundational contribution to
entrepreneurship DEMO within their field of expertise. In other words, we tasked the DEMO
team with the identification of classic articles in entrepreneurship studies based on their
knowledge of the field and the advice of their close colleagues DEMO collaborators. We required
that the nominated articles be from the 1970s or 1980s. There were three major reasons for
focusing on this particular time DEMO First, the 1970s and 1980s was a time when early works
DEMO entrepreneurship appeared, so that by the 1990s entrepreneurship had gained considerable
DEMO within the academy (Landstrom, 2015). The prestigious Babson Entrepreneurship
Research Conference began during this period, and the Journal of Business Venturing and Small
Business Economics were also founded in this time (Bygrave, 2007)DEMO Second, focusing on this
time period eliminated the chance that editors DEMO nominate their own work as classic. Finally,
the distance in time allowed to test the relevance of these works based on the endurance DEMO their
ideas over time. Despite some initial concerns about the constraints imposed by this time period,
it was well embraced by the editorial DEMO The selection of the studies and the criteria by which
they were considered to be classics were entirely at the discretion of each of DEMO editors, and the
expertise within their network of collaborators.
There are DEMO individuals associated with the journal in an editorial capacity, so we DEMO a
total of 7 articles nominated as classics. The nominations proved to be interesting and revealing.

Not one editor could claim to have had previously read all the DEMO nominated articles, reflecting the
diversity of research interests in the journal DEMO team, and the need for a work of this nature
to DEMO as a point of reference for future scholarship within the field of entrepreneurship. Table 1
presents a list of the nominated articles along with DEMO number of citations it has received on
Google Scholar as well as the Web of Science. Google Scholar reflects the popular and global
impact DEMO each work. The Web of Science reflects a more purist understanding of scholarship
work, framed by Western privilege that comes from the necessary munificence of institutional
resources required to maintain this access.
-----------------------------
Insert Table 1 DEMO here
-------------------------------
We also asked each editorial member to provide a brief write-up of a scholarly reflection
about the article they nominated. Our guideline DEMO each editor to include in their respective
summary, the reasons why DEMO considered their particular article a classic, as well as what could
DEMO considered the future research expectations emanating from, and informed by their DEMO
article. We also agreed, collectively, to keep our individual write-up short, yet with enough
details for help other scholars to become acquainted with the relevance of the article. In addition,
we agreed to discuss DEMO ideas on what kind of novel research can sprout from the selected
classics. The write-up about each classic article constitutes the remainder of this DEMO We
discuss below the classics in a chronological order. It is worth reiterating that each article was
selected because it was considered foundational on DEMO own merits in a distinct area of
entrepreneurship. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and implications of our
efforts to identify classics DEMO entrepreneurship research.
A Brief Journey into the Nominated Classics
Ket De Vries (1977), Entrepreneur as a person at the crossroads
5 
 
The role of individuals in the entrepreneurship process as well as the DEMO of the
budding business venture and environment on entrepreneurial activities have been extensively
studied in the field of entrepreneurship. Early entrepreneurship studies focused on DEMO a
psychological profile of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurs were perceived to be significantly
different from nonentrepreneurs in terms of their backgrounds and personality traits (Gartner,
1985). Later studies, acknowledging the importance of the context in which entrepreneurial
activities occur, focused on how entrepreneurs respond to their environments.
Researchers (e.g. Low & MacMillan, 1988) argue that entrepreneurship is a multifaceted
phenomenon and hence a synthesized view should be adopted. For DEMO, Gartner (1985)
provided an integrated framework for describing new venture creation which included
entrepreneurial individuals, process, environment and organization. Shane and DEMO
(2000) in their theorization of opportunity-based entrepreneurship defined the study of
entrepreneurship as the scholarly examination of how, by whom, and with DEMO effects
opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered, evaluated, and exploited”
(p.218). Such definition and theorization focus on how entrepreneurial individuals interact with
their environments on various entrepreneurial activities as they create DEMO business ventures.
Indeed, a synthesized view was presented in Ket De DEMO (1977) article, with the
entrepreneur being described as a person DEMO the crossroads.  In this article, the author examined
social, economic DEMO psychodynamic forces that can influence entrepreneurship. At the
individual level, Ket DEMO Vries (1977) proposed three functions an entrepreneur fulfills:
innovation, DEMO –coordinating, and risk-taking. He also discussed personality traits
common among entrepreneurs DEMO desire to take personal responsibility for decisions,
preference for moderate degree of risk and a high need for achievement. In addition, Ket De
 
6 
Vries (1977) pointed out that entrepreneurs are not a homogenous group DEMO therefore different
types of entrepreneurs such as craftsman-entrepreneurs and opportunistic-entrepreneurs exist.
This article was a forerunner in that it discussed the emergence of a DEMO type of entrepreneurs –
internal entrepreneurs and the existence of “internal entrepreneurship” in large bureaucratic
organizations which involves creation of new product ventures and DEMO technology divisions in
existing companies (p.43). The author identified social DEMO economic factors that can give rise to
entrepreneurship:  ones’ social status (e.g. ethnic minority or immigrants), family background
(e.g. having a DEMO who is self-employee), change in institutional patters and environment (e.g.
DEMO) turbulence. Moreover, Ket De Vries (1977) emphasized family dynamics and one’s
childhood and upbringing in his theoretical analysis. Lastly, he highlighted the importance of
entrepreneurial organization not only as a tangible reality of personal DEMO but also a business
entity that is of emotional significance to entrepreneurs.
Ket De Vries’s (1977) review was a pioneer at a time DEMO research on entrepreneurship
was in its infancy. His integrated view of entrepreneurship with attention to the individual,
organization and environment was further extended DEMO later studies such as Gartner (1985) and
Shane and Venkataran (DEMO).  Ket De Vries (1977) was among the first to DEMO the attention to
internal entrepreneurship, an important research topic in later DEMO called corporate
entrepreneurship (e.g. Sharma and Chrisman, 1999). He also proposed a novel analysis of the
role of family dynamics and one’s DEMO experience in the emergence of entrepreneurship
and demonstrated the entrepreneur’s family of origin (Dyer & Handler, 1994).
As we continue to explore DEMO myths and the phenomenon of entrepreneurship, it would
be wise for DEMO to bear in mind this classic writing and theorization by Ket De Vries (1977). The
interest in studying the interactions among individual, DEMO, organization and environment is
 
7 
evident in more recent research on, for example, the role of DEMO capital in technological
entrepreneurship (e.g. Wright, Hmieleski, Siegel & Ensley, 2007), the research on venture
creation and entrepreneurial intent (e.g. Shook, Priem, & McGee, 2003) and the research on
work-conflict and DEMO well-being of entrepreneurs (e.g. Parasuraman & Simmers,
2001). From DEMO perspective, future research should carry Ket De Vries’s (1977) insights
DEMO in explicating the nexus of these important components of entrepreneurship.
Pennings (DEMO), The urban quality of life and entrepreneurship
According to a report from the World Health Organization, as of 2010 already more than
half of the global population lives in urban areas understood as geographical spaces DEMO higher
population density and vast human features in comparison with the surrounding areas (Global
Health Observatory, 2010). The same report suggests that DEMO percentage will surpass 70% by
2050 as the process of urbanization builds on itself. This estimates present urban spaces as
locations with above average DEMO concentrations of human populations often with access
to basic services. Yet this understanding of urban does not speak of the quality of life in DEMO
space. Pennings (1982) can be considered as the first scholar to make the link between
entrepreneurial outcomes and the different types of urban DEMO, thus recognizing that
not all urban spaces have the same allure DEMO entrepreneurship. In doing so, he opened the
conversation to later works DEMO as Porter’s (1995) work on the competitive advantage of the
inner city, Markusen’s (1996; 2005) ideas of urban development and businesses, and on the
arguments of the creative class by Richard Florida (2002).
Penning’s work have served, directly or indirectly, to frame ideas DEMO as the integration
and collaboration of business and communities (Birla, 2006; Blowfield, 2007; Dearlove, 2002;
Ellis, 2001; Karnani, 2008), cities as the organizational extension of business (e.g., Forman &
 
8 
Goldfarb, 2008; Hillman & Keim, 2001), urban places as an organizationally manageable space
(e.g., Buschmann & Coletta, 2009), and the organization of the community as a single economic
unit to achieve socioeconomic DEMO (e.g., Peredo & Chrisman, 2006). This work on
urban DEMO also set precedents on methodology that identify different types of local
munificence as sources of local entrepreneurship (Boyd & Vozikis, 1994; Specht, DEMO). Linking
munificence and entrepreneurship, Penning opens a conversation on principles DEMO venture
creation (e.g., Amezcua, Grimes, Bradley, & Wiklund, 2013; Gartner, 1985) as well as
entrepreneurial ecosystems (e.g., Aldrich, DEMO; Marin-Aguilar & Vila-López, 2014).
Findings in this paper can become pivotal for future research in entrepreneurship as the
number of urban dwellers DEMO and environmental issues take forefront in communities.
Original findings suggest a negative relationship between entrepreneurship and environmental
issues where pristine environments may deter entrepreneurship DEMO certain conditions.
Likewise findings at the industry level hint the need for further research on the impact of zoning,
lobbying, and advocacy at the industry level. Furthermore, their original analysis on urban spaces
looks at ventures as externalities to their environment thus environmental factors are only
considered DEMO resources to the venture rather than elements encouraging the actions of the
entrepreneur. Complementing this resource based view perspective, new research may consider
resources and ventures not as externalities to the venture but as part of DEMO venture itself or a
network (Osorio, Ozkazanc-Pan, & Donnelly, 2015). Likewise, future work can consider that
environmental elements are also part and parcel of the venture itself (Calas, Smircich, & Bourne,
2009). Finally, using this work and its original findings, new DEMO of research can be
developed to explore how societal trends impact entrepreneurial spaces as we move into a
society where pristine environments are now DEMO ideal space for lifestyle entrepreneurs and
 
9 
technology entrepreneurship may focus on preserving these spaces rather than avoiding them, as
originally done.
Miller (1983), The correlates for entrepreneurship in three types of firms
Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) has been an interesting topic DEMO entrepreneurship
scholars in past decades because under the rubric of corporate entrepreneurship, EO explores
origination and implementation of firm strategic behavior. EO literature has been explored over
the past three decades and the conversation of EO DEMO exceeds the broader topic of corporate
entrepreneurship.
Most scholars agree that three foundational and pioneering works on EO are Mintzberg
(1973), Khandwalla (DEMO) and Miller (1983) (see Basso, Fayolle, & Bouchard, DEMO for a
review). Mintzberg (1973) first proposed ‘entrepreneurial mode’ of firms’ strategic decision-
making and discussed how top managers commit organizations to DEMO courses of action’. Later,
Khandwalla (1977) reinforced the importance of the top managers in pursuing and constructing
strategic decisions.
Miller (1983) DEMO a critical piece in the history of entrepreneurship because it introduced
the conceptualization of entrepreneurial firms, encompassing three EO dimensions-
innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness, which allows researchers to measure the degree
of entrepreneurial behavior and examine the EO-performance relationship. The concept of EO
advanced the field in DEMO what it means, in a practical or behavioral sense, for a firm
to be entrepreneurial (Miller, 2011). A behavioral model of DEMO promotes
discussion on how behaviors rather than attributes constitute the entrepreneurial process (Covin
& Slevin, 1991).  Miller (1983) suggested that firm-level entrepreneurship should exhibit all
three behaviors with some degree of simultaneity (Anderson & Covin, 2014). Since then, a
 
10 
significant number of researchers have used this construct to measure the EO-performance
DEMO
Miller (1983) also acknowledged a different approach in understanding what makes a
firm entrepreneurial. Specifically, he examined how senior managers’ decision-making may
influence firm strategy and such an influence could be contingent upon the nature DEMO the
organization and its environment. In particular, Miller emphasized that ‘what DEMO most important
is not who is the critical actor, but the DEMO of entrepreneurship itself and the organizational
factors which foster or impede it’ (Miller, 1983: 770; emphasis in original). Miller’s approach
linked DEMO manager’s predisposition towards entrepreneurial decision-making with firm
strategy and the dynamic environment.
Later on, Covin and Slevin (1989) and Lumpkin and Dess (DEMO) advanced our
understanding of EO; in particular , Lumpkin and Dess (1996) proposed multidimensional views
of EO with autonomy and competitive aggressiveness DEMO as additional important
dimensions of the construct, therefore shedding more light DEMO the original Miller (1983) work of
unidimensional or composite construct.
Miller (1983)’s work therefore advances the field with the notion that firms can “be
entrepreneurial” because they engage in innovative, proactive, and risk-taking DEMO
behaviors. The unique linkage of individual characteristics (senior managers), firm DEMO and
performance, and environmental dynamism makes Miller (1983) a ground-breaking DEMO
Gartner (1985), A conceptual framework for describing new venture creation
DEMO 1985, Bill Gartner published a paper in the Academy of Management DEMO that
attempted to offer a holistic framework for examining the new venture. In subsequent years, this
 
11 
paper has helped progress research and understanding of entrepreneurship as a distinct DEMO of
inquiry.
Gartner’s paper began with the observation that most of the then prevailing research on
entrepreneurship was premised on two broad assumptions: (DEMO) that entrepreneurs are different
from non-entrepreneurs, and (ii) that entrepreneurial firms are different from non-entrepreneurial
firms. Such a classification, he reasoned, DEMO simplistic: in practice, the difference among
entrepreneurial firms tends to be far greater than either differences between entrepreneurs and
non-entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial versus DEMO firms. As such, Gartner
proposed that it would be valuable to DEMO the diversity among entrepreneurs and their
ventures by examining a wider set of parameters and then classifying entrepreneurial ventures
into groups or clusters based DEMO these parameters. Adopting Miller’s (1981) idea of the new
venture as a gestalt, Gartner (1985) proposed a novel framework that would distinguish new
ventures along four dimensions: individual(s), process, environment, and organization.
Additionally, based on findings of previous research, he identified within DEMO dimension a
series of specific characteristics that could be utilized to differentiate among clusters of new
ventures. He suggested that such an approach would DEMO new ventures to be viewed as “a
kaleidoscope… [enabling researchers] to identify specific variables that describe how each new
venture was created, in order that meaningful contrasts and comparisons among new ventures
can be made” (p. 701). In turn, he opined such an approach would help arrive at a more informed
understanding of underlying factors that explicate the diversity DEMO entrepreneurial firms,
explain conflicting empirical results, as well as lead DEMO development and adoption of robust
methodologies to conduct research in this arena and report study findings.
 
12 
Insights laid out in Gartner (1985) turned out to be immensely DEMO in providing a
roadmap for follow-up entrepreneurship research, thus helping the DEMO emerge from the
shadows of sister disciplines such as management and strategy. Subsequent researchers took up
all four dimensions identified by Gartner (1985) DEMO examined them to lay a strong foundation
for the field. For example, in their paper defining the promise of entrepreneurship as a field of
research, Shane and Venkataraman (2000) highlighted the importance of Gartner’s (DEMO) work,
especially the processual aspects that serve as important elements DEMO distinguish among
entrepreneurial firms. Bruyat and Julien (2001) took the insight from Gartner’s (1985)
framework to specifically suggest the interaction between an enterprising individual (or the
entrepreneur) and the environment as a process DEMO evolves and helps build what the authors
classified as “new value creation”, and with the individual and the new object being created
acting as dialogic elements of such a process. Similarly, Bhave (1994) utilized thoughts from
Gartner (1985) to focus on the entrepreneurial process per se. DEMO his work, he developed a
comprehensive model of how such a DEMO evolves over the nascent stages of the new venture,
going from opportunity identification through technology setup and organization creation to
market exchange and DEMO interaction.
With regard to the individual dimension of Gartner’s (1985) framework, follow-up
research has branched off into several streams, of which at DEMO two are most significant:
psychological aspects of entrepreneurship (e.g. Hisrich, Langan-Fox & Grant, 2007; Rauch &
Frese, 2000; Shaver & Scott, 1991) and entrepreneurial intention and cognition (Bird, 1988;
DEMO, Corbett & McMullen, 2010). Similarly, on the organizational dimension, there is an
expanding stream of research that has emerged with regard DEMO identification of firm-level
characteristics that distinguish between entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial firms and among
 
13 
entrepreneurial firms themselves. A large part of the research elaborating the impact DEMO Gartner’s
(1985) organizational dimension has been classified under the burgeoning research on
entrepreneurial orientation as a construct of significance, which examines the impact of firm-
level behavioral characteristics such as risk-taking, proactiveness, innovativeness, autonomy and
competitive aggressiveness on firm performance, survival and growth (Covin & DEMO, 1989;
Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Rauch, Wiklund, Lumpkin & Frese, 2009). Lastly, there is some
research emerging, which DEMO begun to consider the fourth dimension of Gartner’s (1985)
framework: the role and impact of the environment on entrepreneurship (Edelman & Yli-Renko,
2010; Zahra & Covin, 1995; Zahra & Garvis, 2000)DEMO
To summarize, it can be said that Gartner’s (1985) seminal DEMO on the one hand served
to identify the relative weaknesses of prior approaches to examining new venture research and on
the other hand helped DEMO out a robust framework to facilitate research on entrepreneurial firms
along four critical dimensions to explain variation and diversity among them. In subsequent
years, the framework was enthusiastically embraced by entrepreneurship scholars to guide their
own DEMO, though with varying degrees of adoption. Considering research that followed
publication DEMO Gartner’s (1985) paper, it may be said that the framework DEMO the most significant
influence on subsequent research with regard to insights relating to the individual and
organizational dimensions. In comparison, the impact of insights offered through the process and
environment dimensions have been relatively less spectacular. DEMO conclusion, therefore, it may be
said that the process and environment dimensions are areas of the Gartner framework that hold
the highest potential DEMO further exploration through incorporation into a range of research
questions, designs, and methodologies in the future.
Bowen and Hisrich (1986), The female entrepreneur: A career development perspective
 
14 
At the time of its publication three decades ago, Bowen and Hisrich’s (1986) article was
one of the first to address and examine DEMO notion of women’s entrepreneurship and focus
attention exclusively on female entrepreneurs. Their work was seminal for bringing together,
through a career development perspective, what had previously been disjunctive studies and
approaches to the study of DEMO entrepreneurs. Their work offered a comprehensive
framework for understanding the entrepreneurial behavior of women through a careful outline of
impacts and influences on women’s DEMO and choices in pursuing entrepreneurship. In doing
so, they offered the DEMO field a first glance at why and how women become engaged
in entrepreneurship.
In more recent times, while the focus on women’s entrepreneurship has blossomed but
compared to the majority of entrepreneurship work this still represents DEMO small fraction of the
field. To this end, a number of DEMO studies have emerged in recent decades including those
focusing on specific challenges women face in entrepreneurship ranging from psychological
barriers such as gender stereotypes DEMO structural barriers such as access to capital (De Bruin et al.,DEMO
2007; Brush & Edelman, 2000; Carter et al., 2003; DEMO et al., 2008; Sullivan & Meek, 2012;
Sweida & DEMO, 2013; Thebaud, 2010). In addition to these approaches, some work has
adopted a critical perspective to highlight and question gendered assumptions DEMO
entrepreneurship research (Ahl, 2004, 2006; Ahl & Marlow, 2012; Bird & Brush, 2002; Bourne,
2010; Brush et. al., DEMO; Calás et al., 2009; Clark Muntean & Ozkazanc-Pan, 2015;
Mirchandani, 1999; Robb & Watson, 2012). Thus, the field DEMO women’s entrepreneurship is
becoming richer through the various different perspectives adopted by scholars ranging from
micro-level psychological dimensions, to meso-level organizational issues, and DEMO
structural and societal elements.
 
15 
Future research in this area can extend these lines of inquiry. However,  rather than doing
so in a piecemeal fashion, the emphasis should DEMO on understanding the interdependencies across
these levels and how they might create challenges unique for women entrepreneurs across
differences of race, ethnicity, education, and so forth. Furthermore, future work can also examine
how different ecosystems foster women’s entrepreneurship through multi-level analyses of all
stakeholders including entrepreneurs, support organizations, and policy makers (see Watkins et
al., 2015). Doing so will allow for a deeper understanding of entrepreneurship and allow for
DEMO policies to redress inequities facing women engaged in business.
Bird (1988), Implementing entrepreneurial ideas: The case for intentions
Since the 1980s, the subject of entrepreneurial intentions has been among the most
researched topics in DEMO field of entrepreneurship, and has provided scholars with a powerful
theoretical DEMO (Linan & Fayolle, 2015). Shapero and Sokol (1982) and Shapero (1984)
initiated the discussion of entrepreneurial intentions by highlighting the influence of social,
political and economic variables on entrepreneurial intentions. Subsequently, Katz and Gartner
(1988) investigated the role of the entrepreneur’s intentions (as well as other stakeholders’
intentions) on new ventures and existing ventures. However, Bird’s (1988) seminal publication
was the first to examine the topic of entrepreneurial intentions through cognitive perspectives,
and offered a psychological DEMO to explain how entrepreneurial intentions are formed. Bird’s
work is considered a classic for several reasons. For one, it is the first study on entrepreneurial
intentions that attempts to go beyond descriptive studies to offer a DEMO approach to
differentiate entrepreneurship from strategic management (Bird, 1988). Second, it is among the
earliest studies to bring cognitive perspectives into the analysis of entrepreneurship. Cognitive
research is specifically important to entrepreneurship because it DEMO crucial insights into key
 
16 
aspects of the entrepreneurial process (Baron, 2004). Finally, Bird makes a clear distinction
between entrepreneurial intentions and similar concepts, such as goal setting and the manager’s
intentions in established firms. By means of these DEMO, she helped establish
entrepreneurial intention as a separate field of research DEMO its own theoretical framework.
In her model, Bird explains how entrepreneurial DEMO are formed based on certain
factors, including the entrepreneurs’ needs, values, wants, habits and beliefs. These factors result
in the entrepreneur creating DEMO maintaining a temporal tension, sustaining strategic focus, and
developing a strategic posture. Bird also explains how intentionality is a result of both rational
DEMO intuitive thinking, which are influenced by contextual and personal factors. Since DEMO
publication, an increasing number of studies have been published based on DEMO model of
entrepreneurial intention. Some of these studies focus on improving Bird’s model by adding
other cognitive components and perspectives into the model (e.g. Boyd & Vozikis, 1994;
Krueger, 2007, 2009). Other research has been focused on the factors that influence
entrepreneurial intentions. Improvisation (Hmieleski & Corbett, 2006), entrepreneurial education
(Souitaris, Zerbinati, & Al-Laham, 2007; Pittaway & Cope, 2007; Wilson, Kickul, & Marlino ,DEMO
2007), risk perception (Segel, Borgia, & Schoenfeld 2005), DEMO family exposure to
entrepreneurship (Carr & Sequeira, 2007), and gender stereotypes (Gupta et al., 2008) are all
among the identified factors that influence entrepreneurial intentions.
Although the subject of entrepreneurial intentions has grown DEMO as a field of study,
there is still room for additional research. A very important component of Bird’s argument is the
impact of DEMO on entrepreneurial action in terms of both venture creation and venture
growth. Although several studies (e.g. Kolverid & Isaken, 2006; Kautonen, Van DEMO, &
Tornikoski 2013) have examined the relationship between venture creation DEMO and the
 
17 
actual creation of venture, very few studies (with the exception of DEMO & Bullvag, 1996)
have examined the process through which an DEMO growth intentions influence the
growth of the venture. In addition, with DEMO rise of social entrepreneurship research, scholars may
benefit from Bird’s model DEMO gain a better understanding of both social entrepreneurship
intentions and sustainable entrepreneurship intentions, two areas that have yet to be researched in
greater depth (Linan & Fayoll, 2015).
Covin and Slevin (1989), Strategic management of small firms in hostile and benign
environment
A quick glance DEMO the entrepreneurship articles published in top-tier peer reviewed
journals reveals a lively discussion developing around the topic of entrepreneurial orientation,
generally referred to DEMO EO. Common definitions of EO conceive it as a firm-level construct
capturing the managerial tendencies and decision-making philosophies that are entrepreneurial in
nature (Covin & Lumpkin, 2011). Basso, Fayolle, and& Bouchard (2009: DEMO) observe that EO
“seems to be one of the few examples DEMO stabilized concepts in management science.” While the
origins of EO scholarship can be rightly traced back to the works of Khandwalla (1976) and
DEMO (1983), it is not commonly realized that research in this DEMO truly began in earnest with
the publication of Covin and Slevin (DEMO). Given the proliferation of EO-related research in
entrepreneurship, management, and other disciplines such as marketing and tourism studies
(Gupta & Gupta, DEMO), it seems justified to nominate Covin and Slevin (1989) as an original
classic in entrepreneurship studies. To give credit where it is DEMO, our nomination follows Wales,
Gupta, and Mousa (2013) who used SSCI citations as a basis for considering Covin and Slevin
(1989) an entrepreneurship classic.
 
18 
Several excellent reviews of EO scholarship have been published in recent years (Gupta
& Gupta, 2015; Wales, Gupta, & Mousa, 2013; DEMO, 2016). A common theme across these
reviews, and others (DEMO, George, 2011; Lumpkin & Dess, 2005), is that EO remains a fertile
topic of inquiry. The popular appeal of EO seems DEMO stem from its ability to speak to one of the
most critical managerial questions: Why do some firms perform better than others? EO DEMO
to explain superior firm performance as stemming from a firm’s decision-making policies,
managerial practices, and behavioral activities that are entrepreneurial in nature. To capture EO,
Covin and Slevin (1989) emphasized the three dimensions DEMO risk-taking, proactiveness, and
innovativeness, developing a nine-item scale to assess DEMO firm’s strategic commitment to
entrepreneurship. Since then, the EO-performance link has DEMO as the most studied
relationship in the EO literature (Rauch, Wiklund, Lumpkin, & Frese, 2009), with new
contributions continuing to illuminate the performance consequences of EO from novel
perspectives. In addition to the DEMO effect of EO on firm performance, scores of studies have
examined DEMO and external contingencies that may impinge on this relationship. Notably,
support for predictions about EO effects has been found outside the US as DEMO, with Sweden and
China among prominent examples of countries where EO DEMO has been done. So prolific has
been the research on EO over the years that the number of manuscripts now published on the
topic DEMO EO exceed that of articles examining the broader topic of corporate entrepreneurship
(Wales, 2016).
Despite years of research, the EO literature continues to generate excitement about
several promising research questions worthy of future research. DEMO mention three research
endeavors here that we believe engender directly from Covin and Slevin (1989). One crucial area
within EO research that has received little attention so far is the mechanisms through which EO
 
DEMO
translates into firm performance- in other words, mediators linking EO with firm performance.
Another critical issue in the EO literature pertains to elaborating the DEMO foundations for
the EO-performance relation. Currently, the positive EO-performance relation is DEMO either
on faith or on the basis of empirical evidence, but DEMO conceptual rationale is offered to justify
it. Finally, there is an DEMO debate within the literature as to whether the dimensions of EO
are additive in nature as has generally been assumed (Kuratko, 2007) or may actually be
multiplicative (Slevin & Terjesen, 2011) or even geometric (Gupta, 2015). These are all exciting
questions that scholars need DEMO grapple with going forward, but they are only the proverbial tip DEMO
the iceberg as the EO literature is replete with new and engaging possibilities for further research
(e.g. Wiklund & Shepherd, 2011).
Discussion
DEMO is a vibrant academic field with a rich history. With the goal of
recognizing some of the key articles that advanced research in the DEMO years of inquiry on
entrepreneurial phenomena, we set out to identify DEMO discuss classics that helped lay the
foundation for future scholarship in the field. Classics are considered the “gold bullion of
science” (Smith, 2007) and they help provide a historical perspective on the scientific
advancements in DEMO field. Using a focused key informant approach, we identified seven classics DEMO
entrepreneurship research, published over the two decades of the 1970s and DEMO To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first systematic DEMO to reveal the classical articles in
entrepreneurship research and their impact on subsequent scholarship.
Our approach to the identification of classics is substantially influenced DEMO two decisions
we made: (a) time period of 1970s and DEMO, and (b) asking journal editors for nomination. The
imposition of DEMO two conditions substantially influenced our identification of classic articles.
 
20 
For example, publications from this period represent the moment in time when we started to
reflect on our current views on entrepreneurship as the DEMO and 1980s were cultural and
societal tipping points. Thus extending the time period under investigation to include the 1990s
and 2000s, for example, DEMO have introduced other articles to our list, but publications during
this DEMO can hardly be considered classics as they may still be too young to assess their true
impact in the field, thus not addressed in the scope of this review Likewise, moving beyond the
subjective opinions of key informants like journal editors to more objective indicators (such as
citations) or tapping into the ‘wisdom of the crowds’ by polling members of the entrepreneurship
division may also have introduced other articles to our list. DEMO investigations may benefit
from pursuing alternative paths not taken in the study reported here.
The classics nominated here may be influenced by the academic DEMO and affiliations
of the editors at North American doctoral programs. It is possible that scholars from other parts
of the world may have selected DEMO articles as classics in entrepreneurship research. Our
concerns about ethnocentrism in the nominating process are somewhat alleviated by the
realization that entrepreneurship research has DEMO, and continues to be, dominated by North
American scholarship. Nevertheless, DEMO would be interesting to probe into the views held by
researchers from different parts of the world with regard to the classic articles in
DEMO studies.
We hope this pioneering effort to identify classics in entrepreneurship research, as well as
the recent publication of other articles with similar historical flavor (Carlsson et al., 2013;
Landstrom, Harichi, & Astrom, 2012), will spur discussions about the formative years of the
field DEMO entrepreneurship studies and its future. As entrepreneurship research becomes broader
and more fragmented, we believe it is worthwhile to pause and reflect on the enduring value of
 
21 
key articles that opened new vistas for entrepreneurship scholars to explore. Perusal DEMO original
articles from the early days of entrepreneurship research educate and inspire further research
from established incumbents as well as new entrants to the DEMO
