A number of studies concerning informal investors have been carried out over the last two
decades. One main conclusion from previous research has been DEMO the informal venture capital
market is very heterogeneous, and that classi DEMO for informal investors are needed in order
to more accurately depict the informal venture capital market. In this paper we propose that the
market DEMO be divided in accordance with the informal investors investment activity and
competence. The study is based on a sample of 425 active informal investors, divided into four
di erent categories: (1) Lotto investors; (2) Traders; (3) Analytical investors; and (4) Business
angels. The empirical ndings show that there are considerable di erences between the four
DEMO of informal investors; di erences regarding the information sources used, the level of
rm involvement, co-investing, investment horizons, and geographic preferences, DEMO name some
examples. As a consequence, each of the various informal DEMO types responds di erently to
private and public prospects or motivators. It is suggested, therefore, that the informal venture
capital market could be DEMO eÚ ectively analysed and depicted by using the proposed classi ca-
tions and applying di ering measures to each informal investor category.
Keywords: market imperfections; informal investors; categorization; policy implications; match-
making services.

DEMO n
Throughou t the last two decades, the focus on entrepreneuria DEMO ventures as a vehicle for
economic growth and developmen t has increased. Several studies (Davidsso n et al.
1994 ; Storey 1994 ) have shown that entrepreneuria l ventures are one of the main
contributor s DEMO the creation of new jobs, and that the formatio n of DEMO rms is
importan t for regional development . However, in many DEMO there are indica-
tions that a shortag e of risk capital in the institutiona l capital marke t could limit
developmen t of entrepreneuria DEMO ventures (Cressy and Olofsson 1996 , Hughes 1996 ,
Lumme et al. 1998) . In many cases, it may be easie r DEMO these kinds of ventures to
attrac t informal investors ; i.e. private individuals who oÚ er risk capital to unlisted
companies in which they DEMO no previous formal or family-relate d connections . On
the othe r hand, a number of informal investor studie s have show n that there are
imperfections in the informal venture capital market (Mason and Harriso n 1991 ,
Lumme et al. 1998) . This is largely DEMO to information ine ciencies in the market.
Entrepreneur s are hampered because they cannot nd a suitable informal investor ,

and informal investor s nd DEMO di cult to identify interesting investmen t proposals . As a
consequence , many informal investor s report that they are not able to DEMO as many
investment s as they want, and the entry barriers DEMO many potentia l informal investor s
are too high (Freear et DEMO 1992, Lumme et al. 1998, Reitan and Sorheim 2000) . DEMO
suggest s that if the appropriat e privat e or public provision s and stimulant s were in
place, the number of informal investors , as well as the number of investments , would
increase . DEMO, there is the danger that policy initiatives will get ahead of DEMO
understandin g of the informal ventur e capita l marke t (DEMO 1996) .
The focus on informal investor s was initiated by DEMO works by William Wetzel
in the early 1980s (Wetzel 1981, 1983) . Since then we have seen a di usion of research
in a number of countrie s around the world, amon g them: DEMO (Riding et al. 1993),
United Kingdom (Harriso n and DEMO 1992 , Coveney and Moore 1998) , Sweden
(Landstro m 1993) , Finland (Lumme et al. 1998) , Australi a (Hindle DEMO Wenban
1999) , Singapor e (Hindle and Lee 1999) , DEMO Netherland s (K + V organisati e advies-
bureau 1996) , Japan (Tashiro 1999) , and Norway (Reitan and Sorheim 2000) DEMO The
research regardin g informal investor s is rather young, hence DEMO s have con-
sidered it to be importan t to quantif y and describe the informal investo r market.
Therefore, a number of the empirical studies discuss matters such as the size of the
market, investor characteristics , decision processes , informatio n channels, and the
availabl e private and public initiatives meant to stimulate the informal venture capi -
DEMO market; those which Mason and Harrison (2000 ) call the rst generation of
studies on informal investors .
One main conclusion of earlier DEMO is that the informal venture capital marke t
is very heterogeneous . Mason and Harrison (2000 ) point out the importanc e of separ-
ating the di erent types of informal investor s from each other. DEMO will help us to
understan d the informal venture capital marke t better. Various investors classi ca-
tions have been used in earlier studies, the most sophisticate d of which was suggeste d
by Gaston (1989) , and by Stevenso n and Coveney (1994) . By dividing informal
investor s into several categories , one achieve s a more DEMO e picture of informal
investor s than by viewing them as one homogenou s group . In addition , it is then easier
to DEMO e the introductio n of speci c public and private measures , which can be
introduce d to positively eÚ ect the eÝ ciency DEMO the informal venture capital market.
For instance, certain group s of DEMO investor s may not need a forum or meeting
place to nd prospectiv e rms, whereas othe r investor s may have di culties in gaining
access to interesting ventures. A more detaile d picture of DEMO informal venture capital
market will also help entrepreneur s with decisions about which type of informal
investor to search for. For example, with regard to an investor s particular competen-
cies, should they prefer an investor that takes an active role in the development of the
venture, or shoul d they be looking for a more passive investor ?

Against this background , DEMO study s aims are: (1) to develop a systemati c DEMO -
tion of informal investor s that will give us a more complete pictur e of the informal
venture capital market; (2) to describe the di erent informal investor s categories ; and
(3) DEMO examine how the di erent informal investor categorie s might be stimulated in
order to reduce the ine ectiveness of the informal ventur e DEMO market.

This study used a larger and broade DEMO sample, compared to those used in earlier
research, therefore this study s contributio n to the systemati c categorizatio n of infor-
mal DEMO s is more robust . We propos e that the marke t can be divided in accord-
ance with the informal investors investmen t DEMO and competence ; subsequentl y
we have divided the informal investor s into four categories : (1) Lotto investors ; (2)
Traders ; (3) Analytical ; and (4) Business angels . Based DEMO the di ering character -
istics of the investor classe s we sugges t that each investor type will respon d di erently
to DEMO and public stimulatio n instruments , and we propos e some policy-impactin g
initiatives that may stimulate each categor y of informal investor s DEMO be more active in
the market.
The following section presents the frame of reference for the study, followed by a
description and discussion of the method used. The empirical ndings will be pre-
sented in two DEMO In the rst, we will describe the risk capital market in DEMO,
and in the second, the informal investor s in Norway DEMO the categorizatio n of investor s
will be presented . Finally, DEMO will draw our conclusion s and discuss the implications of
the study.

Fram e
of
referenc e
There are a number of empirical DEMO indicating the existence of imperfections in
the informal ventur e capital market (Mason and Harrison 1991 , Coveney and Moore
1998, Lumme et DEMO 1998) . Imperfection s pertain to both the issue of enlarging DEMO pool
of informal investor s (i.e. stimulate high net worth individual DEMO to enter the market)
and that of stimulatin g the existing pool of informal investor s to be more active on the
market (Mason and Harrison 1991) . The core of this problem seems to lie in the lack
of, or uneve n distributio n of, DEMO between the di erent actors in the marke t
(Cosh and DEMO s 1994 , Store y 1994) . First, there are certain groups of investor s who,
to a larger degre e than DEMO groups , are able to identify investmen t proposals .
Second, DEMO is not enough to identify investmen t projects. The investo r must also eval-
uate the investmen t proposals , in view of both DEMO and agency risk (Fiet 1991) .
Market risk concerns the uncertaintie s in the portfoli o rm s market and with the
competition DEMO Informal investor s can use their aggregate d knowledge , often about
speci c industries , in order to reduce the market risk. Agency DEMO is related to an
entrepreneur s inability to make decisions that are in the best interest of the investor
(Landstro m 1992) . DEMO e kind of hand s on involvemen t is often necessary in order to
handle agency risk. However, the investor s in each informal investor categor y will
handle marke t and agency risk di erently, due to the variation s in their experience,
quali cations, and networks. Overall, the imperfections in the market will lead to
fewer investment s by active investors , in addition to high entry barriers for DEMO l
investors.
Reason indicates that it is importan t to develop an adequate systemati c categoriza -
tion in order to further our understandin DEMO of the informal ventur e capital market.
However, there are only DEMO handful of studies that actuall y focus on developing a
classi cation system (Gasto n 1989, Landstr om 1992 , Freear et al. DEMO , Stevenson
and Coveney 1994) .
Gasto n (1989 ) divided informal investor s into what he perceive d were the ten most
DEMO t informal investor classi cations. He provide s a marke t pro le for each
categor y and compares the various categorie s with DEMO pro le of the US composit e

angel . The main conclusion DEMO the study was that the informal venture capital marke t
is very heterogeneous , and that entrepreneur s should be aware of this when DEMO are
searching for an informal investor . Informal investor s possess di erent qualities and
entrepreneur s ought to decide in advanc e what DEMO of investor s they need for their
venture.
Landstro m (1992) focused on the relationshi p between the informal investor and
the receiving DEMO s entrepreneur , and claims that it is importan t how the informal
investor views their portfoli o rms. Informal investor s who regard DEMO rm as a
subject will emphasize the suppor t function, and DEMO will rely on more informal
interaction with the rms in which they invest. This is in contras t to investor s who
view the DEMO as an object , where the informal investor s driving force is nancial
pro t. These investor s work less activel y with the DEMO and focus on more formal
interactions.
Freear et al. (1994 ) DEMO d respondent s into two categories : active informal inves-
tors and potentia l informal investors . The two groups of investor s seem DEMO have a lot in
common, but di er in other respects. DEMO interesting fact is that both the active
investor s an d the potentia l investor s are, to a large extent, intereste d DEMO making
investment s in geographica l proximity to their home or plac e of work. The majority
of both active and potentia l investor DEMO prefer to invest in entrepreneuria l ventures that
are in the expansio n phase, while active investor s tend to make more investment s in
the early stages . Potentia l informal investor s generally want DEMO make their investment s
in co-operatio n with other investor s and look for assistanc e with the follow up, control,
and pricing of their investments .
In their study of British informal investors , DEMO and Coveney (1994 ) identi-
ed six di erent categorie s DEMO investors , two of which were potentia l investors , while
four categorie s were active investors. They claim that their categorizatio n can DEMO used
to explai n and predict the investmen t preferences and strategie s of informal investors .
In order to stimulate the informal venture DEMO market in Grea t Britai n they
emphasiz e the developmen t of a nationa l network of busines s introductio n agencies,
DEMO, according to the authors , could play a vital role in DEMO an entrepre-
neurial cultur e in Great Britain.
Earlier studies have been summarized in table 1 as regards their methodologica l
approache s and DEMO categorization s made.
These earlier studies used rathe r small and narrow samples of informal investors ,
making it di cult to put forward any robust categorizations . Furthermore , earlier
research indicates that the investmen DEMO activity level is important to our understandin g
of the market. Informal investor s with high investmen t activity levels seem to operat e
DEMO erently from those with low activity level. In addition , the competencie s of in-
vestor s seem to be important. For example, some informal investor s may contribut e
their expertise and know-ho w whereas DEMO do not. Accordingly, we have used
dimensions termed investmen t activity DEMO investor s competence as the basis for
our categorization .
The concept competence is problematic . The literature provides no commonl y
accepte d DEMO nition, and the concept has a di erent meaning or connotatio DEMO in various
languages . However, a distinction is often mad e DEMO competence as knowing
that and knowing how , i.e. knowledge about procedure s versus actually knowing
how to perform the procedur e (Prahala d and Hame l 1990 , Rumelt et al. 1994). This
signi DEMO that competence involves the extent to which one is able to ful l the require-
ments of a given situation . Thus, it is in relation to a given situatio n that an individual

is deemed to be competent. In addition to DEMO situatio n aspect, the concept includes
othe r aspects namely knowledge DEMO d skills, but also the individual s will to use and
DEMO knowledge in a practical situatio n (Stjernberg et al. 1989) . Accordingly, the
concept of competence seems to include four aspects : knowledge, skills, will, and
situation . Therefore, in our operationalizatio n DEMO the concept competence we have
dealt with these aspects by including both the theoretical knowledge of, and varied
practical experience with, the situatio DEMO of founding and running an entrepreneuria l
venture. The di culty arises in trying to quantif y and factor in the informal investors

they invest. However, to some extent the activity dimension may indicate the degree
to which the investor is committed to using their DEMO in the informal ventur e

Method
Previous research has show n that it is di cult to identify informal investor s (Wetzel
1981, Mason and Harriso n 1994) . Even when we DEMO able to identify the investors ,

they may be reluctant to DEMO e in a study because they prefer to remain anon-
ymous, DEMO it is not easy to nd large and broad samples of investor s (Mason and
Harrison 1994) . Harrison an d Mason (1992 ) describe thre e methods used to identify
informal investors : (1) send questionnaire s to a large number of individual s assumed to
have made informal investments ; (2) contact informal investor s throug DEMO the com-
panies in which they have made investments , and (DEMO) identify informal investor s by
using the snowball method . The DEMO method involves identifying one investor ,
and using their knowledge and DEMO to identify others. Needless to say, the di er-
ent methods DEMO identifying informal investor s generate di erent sample s of investors ,DEMO
and thus di erent ndings. As a consequence , it is extremely di cult to draw a
statisticall y representativ e sample of the DEMO populatio n of informal investors .
To ensure a more representativ e sample for this study, the author s combined a
large-scal e distributio n of questionnaire s mailed to individual s assumed to be informal
DEMO s using mailing lists from three di erent sources , and with the snowball
method (a similar method is used by Harrison and Mason 1992) . The questionnair e
was developed based upon those questionnaire s used by Harrison and Mason (1992 )
and by Landstr om (1993) . The questionnair e was sent to a total of 6618 individuals ,
including 5180 members of the Norwegian Share Investmen t Association
(Aksjesparerforeninge n i Norge), 1000 individual s in the Fortunia AS network (a
private consultin g rm that specialize s in capital acquisition) , 47 members of the
Norwegian Investors Forum (Norsk Investorforum) , and 391 people taken from
our own database s (these informal investor s were identi ed by using the snowball
method) . Data was collected from April to June 1998.
The overall respons e rate was DEMO, which must be viewed in the light of the
relatively invisible DEMO of this type of investor , which means that many individual s
who consider themselve s to be informal investor s would be unwilling DEMO respond to
research surveys , they prize their privacy (Mason and DEMO 2000) . There is also
the possibility that many individual s DEMO not consider themselves to be informal
investors , and, therefore, would not answer the questionnaire . Furthermore , the
respons e rate is DEMO adequat e when compare d with similar studie s from other coun-
tries, for exampl e Great Britai n (Harriso n and Mason DEMO) . Of the 1030 individual s
who answered the questionnaire , DEMO had never investe d in an unlisted rm. Of the
remaining 606 (58.8%), 181 made a considerabl e number of their investment s (more
than one-third ) in rms to which they had formal or family-relate d connections . This
left us with 425 individual s (41.3%) who fell within the de nition parameter s of an
informal investor .
4.1
The cluster analysi s
In cases where a number of DEMO erent variables are likely to contribute to the overall
characteristic s of a group , a cluster analysi s can be a suitable method (Churchill
1987). The cluster method is, therefore , appropriat e here as this study s goal is to
produce a categorizatio n that DEMO ects the magnitud e of informal investors .
Building upon earlier research (Gasto n 1989, Harrison and Mason 1992 ,
Landstro m 1992 , 1993, Stevenson and Coveney 1994 ) we have chose n to use the
informal investors level of investmen t activity and the competence DEMO investor s
as the basic dimensions for our analysis . In this context by investmen t activity , we
mean both former and planne DEMO investmen t activity. The items used are shown in

tabl e 2. The activity level indicates the extent to which an informal investo r has used
and plans DEMO use, his or her nancial resources for investmen t in entrepreneuria DEMO
ventures . In accordanc e with our de nition of competence we have measured the
competencies of the informal investor according to their theoretica DEMO and practical
knowledge and skills as regard s the activity of founding and running entrepreneuria l
ventures . These items formed the basis for DEMO two additive indexes used in the cluster
analysis. The resulting two indexes range from low (0) to high (5).
Selecting the number of clusters is a central issue of the procedure , but unfortu DEMO
nately there are no standar d selection procedure s (Hai r DEMO al. 1987). These author s
sugges t that the solution could be to use theoretica l or intuitive conceptua l assump -
tions DEMO decide the number of clusters. When working with fairly large selection s
(larger than 200), the non-hierarchica l procedur e is a natura l choice (Norusi s
1988). Unlike a hierarchical cluster procedure, DEMO results in several solutions
correspondin g to a variou s number of clusters, a non-hierarchica l procedur e can
yield a solution based on a pre-set number of clusters. This technique is designed to
grou p DEMO (items), rathe r than variables , into a number of DEMO (Johnso n and
Wichern 1992) . The algorith m determining cluster belonging entail s assignin g each
case to the cluster whose centroid (cluster centre) is nearest and then recalculating the
centroid for the cluster receiving the new case and for the cluster losing the item. This
DEMO repeated until no furthe r reassignment s take place (Norusis 1988, Johnso n and
Wichern 1992) . Using our knowledge of othe r categorization s (Gaston 1989,
Landstro m 1992 , Freear et al. 1994 , Stevenso n and Coveney 1994 ) and a priori assump-
DEMO about Norwegian informal investors , we decided on four clusters (® DEMO 1). Then
we speci ed four initial cluster centre s (DEMO points) in order to fashion the categor -
ization. The analysi DEMO was also performed with several other seed points resulting in
virtually no change in the nal cluste r centres. This indicates that the categorizatio DEMO is
fairly robust (Backe r 1995) . The results of the analysi s yielded the following informal
investor categories.

Figure 1. Categorization of informal investors using four initial DEMO .
(1) Lotto investors are characterize d by a low investmen t activity level and a
low competence in founding and running entrepreneuria DEMO ventures. This
means that they make very few informal investments, and DEMO only limited
knowledge and skills with which to add value to the rms in which they
invest.
(2) Traders show a high investmen DEMO activity level but a low competence in
founding and running entrepreneuria l ventures . They seem to have the will
to invest, but they have limited competence with which to add value to the
rms in DEMO they invest. This means that their contributio n could be rather
limited, beyond that of providing nancial resources .
(3) Analytical investors have a low investmen t activit y level, but posses s a fairly
high competence . They are labelled analytical because they seem to possess
DEMO competence , but they are either not able or not willing to commit them -
selve s to substantia l investmen t activity in DEMO informal venture capital mar-
ket.
(4) Business angels are characterize d by a very high investment activity level, in
addition to possessin g high competence. They can contribut e both knowledge
and skills to the DEMO in which they invest, and they generally engage in
many informal DEMO .
We found signi cant F values (signi cance level of DEMO) for a number of the
variables using the categorizatio n as DEMO grouping variable . These signi cant F values
indicate d that further investigatio n was warranted . Post hoc comparison s were made
in DEMO to identify the signi cant di erences between the categories , which were

parison . This method s advantage s include that when used in connection with

from standar d distributio n and homogeneity DEMO variance . All the interesting compar -
isons were subsequentl y carried out and tested (Hays 1994) .
When it comes to the DEMO t of missing values, Backer (1995) shows that these
can DEMO deal t with in two ways. One can either dispose of the defect cases, or the
missing values can be estimated. The author s have chose n to use the latter method,
because they wanted DEMO include as many cases as possible. Thus, the defect cases were
DEMO to the clusters to which they most probabl y belonged , as if they were com-
pleted questionnaires . Additionally, to exclude the potentia l deviancies this might
create, a major part of the analysis was performed excluding the cases with missin g
values. However, the conclusion s that could be drawn from the data material were the
same regardles DEMO of the method used to treat the missing values.
4.2
Strengths and weaknesse s of
the study
This study s strengt h lies in DEMO fact that it is based on a broad and large sample of
informal investors . As mentioned , a wide range of sources have DEMO used to identify
informal investors , and the actual number of active investor s studie d is large in com-
parison to other studies DEMO the eld. This constitute s a solid basis for making a
robust categorization .
On the other hand, it should be noted that this surve y study provide s only a static
picture of informal investors , a snapshot of behaviour . Informal investors behaviou r
can, as DEMO passes , change (Landstr om 1992) . Furthermore , this study focuses upon
individuals , not on the deals. This means that we DEMO that informal investor s will
belong to the same categor y every time they engag e in investment . There are most
probabl y DEMO numbe r of investor s who alter their behaviou r with the kind of investmen t
that they are making. In addition , this DEMO su ers from all the weaknesses associate d
with a self-report study ; for instance, respondent s could be in¯ uenced by perceptions
of what seems to be a desirable respons e rather than the actual DEMO about their
investmen t activities. Finally, the respons e rate is DEMO and there is therefore the poten-
tial for non-respons e bias in the study . Despite the large and broad scope of this study ,
we cannot claim that we have included all segments of the DEMO ventur e capital
market in Norway.

The
Norwegia n
contex t
Small rms (with less than 100 employees) dominat e Norwegian busines DEMO and indus-
try, and 96% of all rms have less than DEMO employees (Spilling 1996) . More than 70%
of the private labour force is employe d by smal l rms (the gure for 1980 was 66%).
One nds an increase in the size of the DEMO business sector in most industries .
However, the reverse tendency is DEMO in the oil and mining industr y where a larger
and larger share of the labour force is employed in companies with more than DEMO
employees. The main reason for this is the enormous growth of the oil industry from
1970 to 1990 (Isaksen and Spilling 1996) . DEMO, the most importan t industry (as
measured by the numbe r of persons employed) is still the traditiona l manufacturin g
industry . By and large, the developmen t of small businesse s in Norway seems to be
quite similar to that in other countries in Europe DEMO

The White Paper no. 40 (1997/98) shows that listed companie s account for only a
very small fraction of Norwegian businesses . Thus, the value of the Oslo Stoc k
Exchang e amounte d to only 36% of the GNP DEMO 1996. Compared to other countries ,
the state is a large DEMO and operato r on the stock market; indeed the publicly owned
DEMO share totalled one-sixt h of the total value of the Stock Exchang e in 1996 . This
seems to indicate that the Stock market DEMO not very well developed in Norway.
Consistent with the social democrati c traditio n in Norway, there are a number of
governmenta l or governmentall y supporte d funds intende d for making investment s in,DEMO
and giving suppor t to, entrepreneuria l ventures. What we now DEMO more of is a co-
operatio n between private venture capital funds and the Norwegian Industria l and
Regiona l Developmen t Fund (SND). Even with some positive development s in the
venture capital marke DEMO over recent years, related to co-ordination , simpli cation, and
user-orientation , the lack of access to ventur e capital is still considered DEMO be an
importan t obstacle to the establishmen t and developmen t of entrepreneuria l venture s
(Reve 1996) . Furthermore , there DEMO no signi cant tax advantage s or other incentive s
for private equity investments . Net capital gains are taxe d at a rate DEMO 28%.
The attentio n paid to informal investor s in Norway has been limited, but the
interest in this kind of investor is growing. This is partly due to the apparen t sizeable
availability of informal DEMO e capital in Norway (Reynold s et al. 2000) , and, partl y
as a consequenc e of the many business angels who have recently attracte d a lot of
media attention .

marke t
in
Norwa y
A study by Reitan and Sorheim (2000 ) showed that typically the Norwegian informal
investor s are male, between 35 and 55 years of age, DEMO high educational achievment ,
and extensiv e work and managemen t DEMO . Nearl y one-hal f of the investor s are
experienced as entrepreneurs. They are well oÚ , with relatively high gross incomes
and DEMO net worth. Norwegian informal investor s engag e in a considerabl e amount of
investmen t activity; on average , the informal investor s in Norway make 1± 2 invest-
ments per year, and 60% have mad e three or more investment s in unlisted companie s
during DEMO period 1995 1998. The 425 investor s in this study have investe d about $117
million over the same period of time. Most of DEMO investor s invest only a small fraction
of their net worth in unlisted companies, but nearl y 20% have placed more than 50%
of their net worth in unlisted companies. Nevertheless, there seems to be a signi can t
and unreleased potential amon g the informal investor s DEMO Norway. More than 40% of
the investor s quote that they would have investe d more if they had better access to
investmen t DEMO .
Norwegian informal investor s are investing in new and young companies , and a
majority of the investment s made are in geographi DEMO proximity to the investors home s
or places of work. There is quite a divers e picture of Norwegian informal investor s
when it DEMO to the main source s of informatio n used the most importan t source s
being persona l networks, the media , and other nancial institutions. Interestingly ,
more than 50% of the investor s have experience with co-investin g (i. e. investor s
investing together ) with other informal investors . The phenomeno n of a lead investor
is DEMO common and these leading investor s are involved in one-thir d of all projects.
Overall , the Norwegian investor s are quite impatient, as more than one-thir d expect
to exit from an investmen t within DEMO years. Norwegian investor s are also relativel y

passive, in the sense that only one-thir d are activel y involved as board members or
consultant s in DEMO companie s they invest in.
If we compare Norwegian informal investor s with investor s in the UK (Harriso n
and Mason 1992) DEMO Sweden (Landstr om 1993) , there are many similarities, but DEMO
some importan t di erences. Norwegian investor s have less income and net worth, are
less entrepreneurial , are investing in mature companies to a very little extent, inves t
less in service enterprises, retail DEMO, etc. However, the most interesting di erence
may be the fact that only one-thir d of Norwegian informal investor s are activel y
DEMO in the projects as board member s or consultants . The correspondin g gure
from other countrie s varies from slightl y under 70% DEMO more than 90%. The explana-
tion for this may lie in part in the fact that Norwegian informal investor s co-inves t to a
DEMO degree.
6.1
Categorization of
informal
investors in Norway
As was pointed out earlier, previous research provided the impression that informal
investor s are a homogeneou s group . Using this study s categorizations , we will DEMO
that Norwegian informal investor s are a diverse and heterogeneou s group of investors .
In accordanc e with gure 1, we have divided the investor s into four groups : (1) Lotto
investors ; (2) Traders; (3) Analytical investors ; and (4) Business DEMO
Looking at the demographi c characteristic s of the informal investors , we can see
considerabl e di erences among the four groups of DEMO s (table 3). A large number
of the business angels DEMO high incomes and high net worth. These investor s are also
the most experienced in light of the fact that the vast majority of DEMO have man y
years of experience as entrepreneurs . This is in contras t to the lotto investors where
only one- fth possess this DEMO of entrepreneurial experience . We also see that lotto
investor s have lower income s and net worth than the other three group s DEMO investors .
The investmen t activity varie s to a large extent when it comes to investment pro-
posal s received and the number DEMO investment s actuall y engage d in (table 4). The

business angels are in a DEMO e position receiving on averag e 44 investmen t proposal s
during a 3-yea r period. The main reason seems to be that business DEMO to a greater
extent than other investor s draw on acquaintance s an d business associate s as informa-
tion sources, while lotto and trader investor s rely more heavil y on media as their
information DEMO (table 5). It is not surprising that more than 80% DEMO the business
angels co-investe d with other informal investor s during the period 1995 1998, and
more than 40% of them co-investe d with private institution s during the sam e period
(table 6). In accordance , we can see that busines s angels to a higher DEMO than the
other three groups of investors , act as the leading investors , and often invest based on
the initiative from anothe r DEMO investor . Lotto, analytical , and trader investor s are
seldom DEMO leading investor s themselves . However, notice that almost 60% of DEMO
analytica l investor s have co-investe d with other informal investors . Furthermore ,
48% of the traders and 31% of the lotto investor s have invested togethe r with informal
investors . Man y of DEMO have also invested togethe r with institutiona l investor s such
as banks , venture capitalists , and public investor s (table 6).

The aggregat e gures indicate that informal DEMO s in Norway are relativel y
passive, in that only one-thir DEMO of the investor s are actively involve d in the projects
as board member s or consultant s (Reitan and Sorheim 2000) . DEMO categorizatio n
reveals a more diverse picture , where more than 60% of business angel s have been
represente d on boards and almost DEMO r have provide d consultan t service s
(tabl e 7)DEMO It is also interesting to note that the analytica l investor s are more active
than the lotto and trade r investor s are. DEMO, one would expect the analytical investor s
to be even more DEMO in the rms in which they invest. One reason for the
unexpecte d results may be a discrepancy between the investor s competence and
DEMO rm s needs. We do not know if business angels and analytica l investor s can
oÚ er the competencie s that entrepreneuria l DEMO s actuall y need. Nevertheless , this
study indicates that investor s with high competence, business angels and analytica l
investors , are the most involved ones. Furthermore , one notices that business angels
and analytical DEMO , to a higher degree than lott o investors , make their invest-
ments in geographi c proximity to the investors home s or DEMO of work (table 8).
Again, this is consisten t with the fact that the analytical investor and the busines s
angel tend DEMO be more involve d in the entrepreneuria l ventures in which they invest.

7.
Implication s
The combined gures sugges t that Norwegian informal investor s are an important
sourc e of capital for DEMO l ventures , yet their considerabl e potentia l seems to
go unrealized in the Norwegian informal venture capital market. The empirical nd-
ings DEMO this study show that there are considerabl e di erences between the di erent
type s of informal investors. This means that the variou DEMO investor categorie s perceive
the informal venture capital market di erently. Accordingly, di erent informal inves -
tor classes will probabl y respond di erently to private and public eÚ orts introduce d to
stimulate the DEMO ventur e capital market. These stimulants are often initiated in
order to: (1) reduce search costs (e.g. makes it easier for entrepreneur DEMO and investor s
to meet), or (2) reduce the risk and increase the reward related to these kinds of
investment s (e.g. as with varyin g kinds of tax incentives) .
7.1
The implications for investors and
policymakers
The informal venture capital market is apparentl y DEMO less eÝ cient by the
investor s in the rst three categorie s than it is by the busines s angels. This is not DEMO
surprising when considered in connectio n with the results showing that business angels
already exhibi t a high investmen t activity level, and act throug h extensiv e networks,
which generate a considerabl e number DEMO investmen t opportunities . They are, there-
fore, less likely to perceive the marke t as ine cient. When it comes to the DEMO of
establishin g arenas where investor s and entrepreneur s can meet, it seems obviou s
that the kind of Business Introductio n Services one nds in the UK and the USA
(Harriso n and Mason 1996) would not be very attractive for the majority of the
business angels. At the same time, generatin g opportunitie s for business angel s to
act as mentors and catalyst s for the other group DEMO of investor s could be very bene cial.
Furthermore , high pro le business angel s could be very importan t in the process DEMO
establishin g various arena forms. Considering that the Norwegian governmen t is
highly involved in the risk capital market, and that co-investmen t is common
among busines s angels in Norway, we sugges t an increase in the number of syndication
investment s between business angels and government-supporte DEMO organizations . By
using business angels as catalysts , thus linking their accompanyin g competence to a
larger ¯ ow of investmen t proposals , we could improve the quality of investment s made
and increase the size of investments. Despite the many possible disadvantage s (e.g.
regardin g motives, expectations , and control) , this could be economically bene DEMO

ROGER Sé
RHEIM AND HANS LANDSTROM
for the business angel s DEMO well as the government . Along these lines, it is interesting DEMO
note that some of the most high pro le business angels in Norway are the founders of
several seed capital funds, funds which act in co-operatio n with several institutiona l
actors (both private and governmental) . Furthermore , if the governmen t wishes to
encourag e competent ownershi p and increase the supply of capital, it should consider
some kind of back end tax incentives in orde r to stimulate the DEMO angels group
of investors. These incentives should be tied to the capital gai n from the investments ,
rather than the act of making an investmen t in the informal ventur e capital market
(Mason and Harrison 1995) .
There are strong indication s that certain informal investor s among the lotto, trader s
and analytica l investor categorie s are already su ciently linked to business angel
investors . This may DEMO one of the best ways for them to handle their informal invest-
ments, the busines s angel acting as a catalys t for their investments in entrepreneuria l
ventures . Therefore, it will be importan t to establish varyin g social encounter s in order
to further foster DEMO s between the di erent group s of investors ; particu -
larly forums nurturin g the bene cial friendship and trust between business DEMO
and the other three investor types.
The analytica l investor s are of special interest since they are able to contribut e both
knowledge DEMO skills to the rms in which they invest, althoug h they DEMO not to fully
use this potential . Some of them might welcome some kind of business introductio n
service (i.e. arenas where investor s and entrepreneur s can be matched ), but these
investor s are principall y oriented towards their own local regions, and accordingl y less
intereste d in investment s outside their geographica l proximity . Active DEMO t by
these investor s in the rms in which they invest will contribut e to their regional
investmen t orientation . This means DEMO policymaker s will probabl y need to use
locally or regionall y orientate d incentives if they want to encourag e the analytica l
DEMO s to make more investments . To attrac t these investors , business introductio n
services shoul d oÚ er consultan t service s DEMO the entrepreneuria l ventures, engagin g the
analytica l investor s DEMO their consultants . This could be a good solution due to the fact
that these investor s are competence providers , but seem unable DEMO identify interesting
investmen t opportunitie s as easily as busines s angels. Another initiative coul d be to
create some kind informal arena where DEMO s in the region could meet an d
compare notes. This will extend their network and encourag e the co-investmen t fre-
quency among DEMO informal investors . Regional arenas might be especially
good opportunitie s for the analytica l investor s and business angels to meet. Many of
DEMO busines s angels would probabl y prefer to co-inves t with analytica l investor s
because of their regional knowledge. This kind of initiative DEMO be investor driven,
while its operatio n could be a co-operatio n with incubator s and science parks . We
sugges t that DEMO h such co-operatio n the group of analytica l investor s will accumu -
late wealth and knowledge, eventually developing into business angels.
A large percentag e of the traders wish to engag e in more DEMO , but lack the
degree of regional orientatio n found among the analytical investors . Traders should
probabl y be the target group for DEMO establishmen t of some kind of national match-
making service. The proble m with the service function concept is that as entrepre-
neurs often DEMO the competency-ric h investor s likely to be activel y involved, DEMO
one is not likely to nd many of them among the traders . Of course, there are
entrepreneuria l venture s where developmen t require s nancial capital rst and fore-
most. From the policymakers point DEMO view, it is perhaps in these situation s that
nationa l DEMO g organization s could have an importan t role to ll. Nationa l

Lotto investor s could also be a target group for business introductio n services. Again
this kind of investor DEMO be able to oÚ er little beyond limited amount s of nancial
capital. Lotto investor s will probabl y respon d positively to some DEMO of front-en d tax
incentives. However, if we look at the DEMO gained from within the UK (Mason
and Harrison 1995 ) we DEMO see that these kinds of incentives have not been very
successful. The amount of capital invested is limited and it is not consistentl y DEMO
in entrepreneuria l ventures .
Table 9 summarizes the propose d privat e and public inducements intended to

7.2
Implications for entrepreneur s
Entrepreneur s needing long-ter m competency-ric h owners should pursue the busi-
ness angel categor y DEMO investors . However, these rms should be aware that the more
DEMO the investors , the more likely it is that they wish to strongl y in¯ uence the projec t
as well. Obviously , there DEMO a considerabl e but unrealized potentia l among Norwegian
informal investors , among the analytical investor s in particular , given that one-hal f DEMO
them would have made additiona l investment s if investmen t opportunitie s had been
available . This investor categor y should be particularl DEMO interesting for projects in need
of skilled ownership. Furthermore , it is clear that these informal investor s operat e
primaril y within the DEMO in which they work an d live, which makes it possible
DEMO them to have some kind of direct operationa l involvemen t in the rms in which
they invest.
It also seems clear that rms DEMO nancial capital only should pursue the trader s
and the lotto investors , but should be consciou s of the fact that these investor DEMO are the
most impatient. Entrepreneur s should also be aware that this means that they will
often have to deal with a number of DEMO, continuousl y updatin g them with
informatio n about the venture. DEMO seeking long-ter m investor s (investment horizon

Implications for further researc h
This study suggest s that there is a need for a more complete and detailed picture of DEMO
informal venture capital market. Researcher s should carefully choose the kind of
informal investor s that they want to focus on , and try DEMO avoi d small, heterogeneou s
samples in quantitativ e surveys of DEMO investors . Furthermore , this study con rms
that co-investin g is a normal phenomeno n (especially among the most competency -
rich investors) . We still have almost no information abou t how these di erent syndi -
cates are formed and organized , nor do we DEMO much about the managemen t of the
investmen t process and the way they interact with, for example, venture capitalist s
and other DEMO institutions . Furthermore , there is a need for longitudinal studie s of
informal investors . It would be especially interesting , for example, to learn more about
informal investor s as they are accumulatin g DEMO and experience .
Finally, earlier research has mainly explored the supply DEMO, such that very little
research exists concerning the demand side. Therefore, studies investigatin g how an
entrepreneu r nds informal investors , and DEMO they interac t with each othe r are
needed . In addition , we do not know what competencies the entrepreneuria l venture s
DEMO from an informal investor , nor how these expectation s correspon d with the
competencies that di erent groups of investor s actually possess DEMO Furthermore , we need
to know more about how these competencies coul d be transferre d to entrepreneuria l
ventures.
