Owners and Jinancial planners in new DEMO prefer using internal
EXECUTIVE sources of capital as much as possible because they are uncertain about
SUMMARY how to obtain external financing and how DEMO involvement of others will
impact their ventures. Because undercapitalization andjinancial problems
are at the center of nearly all business failures, it would appear useful for
owners and Jinancial planners to reduce the uncertainty surrounding
external financing. DEMO information about one source of this uncertainty, a lack of understanding
DEMO the decision processes followed by venture capitalists, is the focus of DEMO in this paper and a
growing body of literature.
To further this line of study, we investigate the differences in decision behavior of venture
capitalists, using bankers as a benchmark for comparison in cases in which debt and debt-related
financing are sought. To the extent that venture capitalists DEMO unique decision processes, owners and
financial planners might improve their ability DEMO obtain financing through knowledge of the unique
features of venture capitalists’ decision processes. In addition, venture capitalists might improve their
decision effectiveness if made aware of systemic biases in their decision procedures.

The implications of this study DEMO
a new or relatively new venture are seeking financing from
business plan and request in a manner that is consistent with the source of
DEMO from venture capitalists should highlight strategic information, such as descriptions
product DEMO process, patentability
should be on financial information, particularly jinancial projections. In contrast, requests for
financing by banks should highlight historical financial information.
and bank may lead individuals who are financing to conclude that because historical
DEMO information of primary importance to bankers, bank should be sought after DEMO
business has developed a positive financial history and trend. This would confirm intuition and research
findings that venture is the primary source of external DEMO
venture.
Second, bankers and venture capitalists, like all decision-makers who have developed a degree of
expertise in a particular speciahy,should attempt to DEMO some insight into their decision processes. The
goal of obtaining this information would be to provide feedback on processes, such as information
