tween different options, individuals are guided by the expected (mean)DEMO
value of the different outcomes and by the associated degrees of
uncertainty. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to iden-
tify brain activations coding DEMO key decision parameters of expected
value (magnitude and probability) separately from uncertainty (statis-
tical variance) of monetary rewards. Participants discriminated behav-
iorally DEMO stimuli associated with different expected values and
uncertainty. Stimuli associated with higher expected values elicited
monotonically increasing activations in distinct regions of the stria-
DEMO, irrespective of different combinations of magnitude and proba-
bility. Stimuli associated DEMO higher uncertainty (variance) elicited
increasing activations in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Uncertainty-
related activations covaried with individual risk aversion in lateral
orbitofrontal regions DEMO risk-seeking in more medial areas. Further-
more, activations in expected value-coding DEMO in prefrontal
cortex covaried differentially with uncertainty depending on risk
attitudes of individual participants, suggesting that separate prefrontal
regions are involved in risk aversion and seeking. These data dem-
onstrate the distinct coding in key reward DEMO of the two basic
and crucial decision parameters, expected value, and uncertainty.
INTRODUCTION
Every day we make decisions about which outcomes to pursue,DEMO
but we don’t even know how the brain processes the most simple
parameters that determine our decisions. Pascal (1948) used the
emerging probability DEMO to postulate a formal description of
decision-making. He conjectured that humans tend to choose the
option with the highest expected (mean) value of DEMO probability
distribution of outcomes (expected value as sum of all probability-
DEMO values of the distribution, the ﬁrst moment of a distri-
bution)DEMO However, most realistic choices involve some degree of
uncertainty of the DEMO, and individuals need to take the
uncertainty into account when making DEMO Uncertainty can
be expressed by the variance of the probability distribution (DEMO
ance as sum of probability-weighted differences from expected
value, the 2nd DEMO). Variance reﬂects the spread of a distri-
bution and indicates how far each possible value is away from the
expected value. Variance is DEMO as “risk” and refers to how
much the decision-maker is uncertain or risks to gain, not to gain,
or to lose relative to the expected (mean) value when the proba-
bilities are known (Kreps 1990; Real 1991). Probability by itself

is not a good, monotonic measure for uncertainty. For example, in
a two-outcome situation (reward vs. no reward), DEMO is
maximal at P  0.5 and decreases toward higher and lower
probabilities as it becomes increasingly certain that something or
nothing will be DEMO, respectively. Modern economic decision
theories, such as expected utility theory and prospect theory, build
on the basic terms of expected value and uncertainty and incor-
porate them into the scalar decision variables of utility and
DEMO, respectively (Huang and Litzenberger 1988; Kahneman
and Tversky 1979; Kreps 1990; Von Neuman and Morgenstern
1944).
Just as we need to understand the function of the retina
before investigating visual perception, we need to understand
the neural processing of expected value and variance that
constitute DEMO most basic input variables for economic deci-
sion-making. As expected value is the summed product of
magnitude and probability, a neural signal for expected value
should reﬂect the product irrespective of its components. Pre-
vious studies DEMO distinct neural signals for magnitude and
probability in striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (Breiter et al.
2001; Critchley et al. 2001; Delgado et al. 2003; Dreher et al.
2006; Elliott et al. 2003; Knutson et al. 2001, 2005; O’Doherty
et al. 2001; Volz et al. 2003) but without describing a common
signal related to expected value irrespective of the two com-
ponents (Tobler et al. 2005). The mathematical decomposition
of expected utility into expected value and variance (Huang
and Litzenberger 1988; Stephens and Krebs 1986) and the
variations in risk attitude among DEMO behavioral situations
(Caraco et al. 1980, 1990) suggest that some DEMO structures
might process uncertainty separately from expected value.
Various brain structures appear to be engaged in situations
involving uncertainty. The altered risk sensitivity and DEMO
bling in humans and animals after brain lesions suggest that the
orbitofrontal cortex is involved in processing information
about the uncertainty of outcomes (Bechara et al. 1994, 2000;
Hsu et al. 2005; Miller 1985; Mobini et al. 2002; Sanfey et al.
2003). The anterior cingulate is active with choice conﬂicts
during ﬁnancial risk-taking (Kuhnen and Knutson 2005), the
amygdala, orbitofrontal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are
engaged in DEMO situations with unknown probabilities
(Hsu et al. 2005; Huettel et al. 2006), and the midbrain and
striatum are involved in the coding DEMO variance combined with
magnitude or probability (Dreher et al. 2006) and in classiﬁ-
cation learning (Aron et al. 2004). However, neural DEMO

METHODS
Participants
Sixteen right-handed healthy participants (mean age: 27 yr; range:
20 – 41 yr; 8 females) were investigated. Participants were DEMO
to exclude prior histories of neurological or psychiatric illness. All
participants gave informed consent, and the study was approved by
the Joint Ethics Committee of the National Hospital for Neurology
and Neurosurgery (UK).
Behavioral procedure
Participants were placed on a moveable bed in the scanner with
light DEMO restraint to limit head movement during image acquisition.
Participants viewed a computer monitor through a mirror ﬁtted on top
of the head coil. To DEMO the processing of economic parameters
independent of choice, subjects performed in DEMO simple conditioning
paradigm in the scanner. We determined individual risk attitudes in a
separate choice task outside the scanner (see following text). At the
beginning of a trial in the main paradigm, single visual stimuli
appeared for 1.5 s in one of the four quadrants of the DEMO
Outcomes appeared 1 s after the stimulus for 0.5 s below the stimulus
on the monitor such that outcome and stimulus presentation co-
terminated. DEMO intervals varied between 1 and 8 s according to
a Poisson distribution with a mean of 3 s. In each trial, we randomly
presented one of twelve visual stimuli, each predicting reward with a
speciﬁc magnitude and probability. We used four levels of reward
magnitude, which varied between 100 and 400 points in steps of 100,
and ﬁve levels DEMO reward probability, which varied between P  0.0
and P  DEMO in steps of 0.25. The stimuli and the rewarded versus
unrewarded outcomes alternated randomly within the boundaries
deﬁned by the probabilities (48 trials for P  1.0; e.g., 36 rewarded
and 12 unrewarded trials for DEMO  0.75), thus producing a measured
mean of reward identical to the expected value. Throughout the
experiment, the total points accumulated were displayed and updated
in rewarded trials at the time of reward delivery. Four DEMO of the
total points were predictably paid out as British pence at the end of the
experiment.
The visual stimuli were speciﬁc combinations of DEMO drawn
from two visual dimensions, shape and color, indicating reward
magnitude and probability, respectively. For example (Fig. 1B), four
orange circles DEMO predict 400 points with P  0.5, whereas two
dark red DEMO could predict 200 points with P  1.0. Both stimuli
were associated with different combinations of magnitude and prob-
ability but the same expected DEMO (200 points). We counterbalanced
the meaning of dimensions (shape or color of stimuli) and the
direction in which they changed (for DEMO: number of circles per
stimulus; for color: relative level of DEMO or red) across participants.
Stimulus delivery was controlled using Cogent 2000 DEMO (Well-
come Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) as imple-
mented in Matlab 6.5 (Mathworks, Natick, MA).
The ﬁrst two moments of the 12 probability distributions associated
with the 12 respective stimuli DEMO calculated according to the
following formulae: expected value (EV) i (mi  pi); variance 
[i (mi  EV)2]/n, which is equivalent to p (mi – EV)2  (DEMO p) 
(0 – EV)2.
In the formulae, m DEMO magnitude of reward, p is probability of
reward, n is number of elements (outcomes associated with each
stimulus), and i is index i 1 ... n. Our probability distributions have
n  1, 2, or 4 elements for P  0.0 or 1.0, P  DEMO, and P  0.25 or
0.75, respectively.
FIG. 1. Experimental design and pleasantness ratings. A: behavioral task.
Single stimuli were presented randomly in 1 of the 4 quadrants of a monitor for
1.5 s, and participants indicated the quadrant in which stimuli appeared with a
button press. DEMO were associated with different combinations of reward
magnitude and probability (see DEMO). Reward consisted of points, 4% of which
was paid out DEMO British pence to subjects at the end of the experiment.
Throughout the experiment, the total of points accumulated was displayed and
updated after reward delivery. Trial types alternated randomly. B: experimental
design. Twelve different stimuli were associated with different reward mag-
nitudes (ordinate) and probabilities (abscissa) DEMO shown. Expected value of
stimuli (sum of probability-weighted magnitudes) is indicated below stimuli
and increases with distance from origin. We disentangled expected value DEMO

ipants, error bars represent SE). The scale ranged from –5 (very unpleasant) to
5 (very pleasant). Table 1 shows absolute DEMO before and after experi-
ment. G: sensitivity of change in pleasantness DEMO function of risk attitude. Risk
attitudes were determined in independent choice trials (16 participants). Sen-
sitivity was determined as slope in pleasantness change against the variance of
the binary probability distribution associated with each stimulus.
DEMO conditioning procedure comprised a training and a testing
phase. In the training phase, participants learned the meaning of the
stimuli and how to perform the task while each stimulus was pre-
sented in eight consecutive trials. DEMO in the training phase did
not contribute to the monetary earnings of participants, but accumu-
lated points were nevertheless displayed. Participants were in the

Functional data were acquired in the test phase, DEMO two
sessions, each with 24 randomly alternating presentations of each
stimulus. DEMO task remained the same as during the training phase, but
outcomes DEMO to total earnings. In both training and testing
phase, stimuli appeared DEMO one of the four quadrants of the screen. The
quadrant of stimulus appearance varied randomly between trials.
Participants were instructed to press one of DEMO buttons correspond-
ing to the spatial quadrant of stimulus presentation. If they failed to
press the correct button within 900 ms, the trial was aborted, a red “X”
appeared, and 100 points were subtracted from DEMO accumulated
earnings. Error trials were repeated, and reported results correspond to
DEMO trials in the testing phase.

unrewarded trial types were modeled separately. The stick function
regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response
function (HRF). In separate time course analyses, we made no
assumptions about the shape of activations and used eight ﬁnite
impulse responses per trial, each response separated from the next by
one scan (2.97 s). Participant-speciﬁc movement parameters were
modeled as covariates of no interest.
The general DEMO model served to compute trial type-speciﬁc
betas, reﬂecting the strength of DEMO between the brain
activation and the canonical response function for a given condi-
tion at each voxel for each participant (see Friston et al. 1994 for
detailed descriptions). The effects of interest (betas, percent DEMO
signal change) were calculated relative to an implicit baseline.
Although the DEMO of stimuli were counterbalanced during the
experiment, the numbers of rewarded DEMO unrewarded trials
varied due to the different reward probabilities. To compensate for
different trial numbers in the general linear model, we equalized
the weights of the less-frequent events by multiplication. Using
random-effects analysis, the relevant contrasts of parameter esti-
mates were entered into a series of one-way t DEMO, simple regres-
sions or repeated-measures ANOVAs with nonsphericity correc-
tion where DEMO We used thresholding strategy as described

Pleasantness ratings before and DEMO training
Data acquisition and analysis
Participants rated the pleasantness of visual stimuli before and after
the experiment on a scale ranging from 5  DEMO pleasant to 5 
very unpleasant. We evaluated ratings statistically by repeated-mea-
sures ANOVA. An interaction analysis between trial type and time
(before and after the experiment) tested for changes in pleasantness
ratings induced by the conditioning procedure. In addition, we tested
preference of participants among two concurrently presented stimuli,
both before and after the experiment. Pairs of stimuli DEMO had the
same or, in control trials, different expected value. The preference
tests served to assess risk attitudes within the range of magnitudes DEMO
probabilities used. Participants chose between stimuli associated with
low and high uncertainty but the same expected value. Each time the
participant chose the more DEMO stimulus, the factor of risk aversion
increased by one, whereas choosing the more uncertain stimulus
decreased it by one (n  4 choices). A positive average factor
indicated risk aversion, a negative factor indicated risk-seeking, and a
zero factor risk neutrality.
We acquired gradient echo T2*-weighted echo-planar images
(EPIs) with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast on a
Siemens DEMO 1.5 Tesla scanner (slices/volume, 33; repetition time,
2.97 DEMO). Depending on performance of participants, 405–500 volumes
were collected per DEMO, together with ﬁve “dummy” volumes at the
start of the scanning DEMO Scan onset times varied randomly
relative to stimulus onset times. A T1-weighted structural image was
also acquired for each participant. Signal dropout in basal DEMO and
medial temporal structures due to susceptibility artifact was reduced
by using a tilted plane of acquisition (30° to the anterior commissure-
posterior commissure line, rostral  caudal). Imaging parameters
were: echo time, 50 ms; ﬁeld-of-view, 192 mm. The in-plane resolu-
tion was 3  DEMO mm; with a slice thickness of 2 mm and an interslice
DEMO of 1 mm. High-resolution T1-weighted structural scans were
coregistered to their mean EPIs and averaged together to permit
anatomical localization of the functional activations DEMO the group level.
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2; Functional Imaging Labo-
ratory, London, UK) served to spatially realign functional data,
normalize them to a standard EPI template and smooth them using an
isometric Gaussian DEMO with a full width at half-maximum of 10
mm. We used a standard rapid event-related fMRI approach in which
evoked hemodynamic responses to each DEMO type are estimated
separately by convolving a canonical hemodynamic response function
with the onsets for each trial type and regressing these trial regressors
against DEMO measured fMRI signal (Dale and Buckner 1997; Josephs
and Henson 1999). This approach makes use of the fact that the
hemodynamic response DEMO summates in an approximately linear
fashion over time (Boynton et al. DEMO). By presenting trials in strictly
random order and using randomly varying intertrial intervals, it is
possible to separate out fMRI responses to rapidly presented events
without waiting for the hemodynamic response to reach baseline after
DEMO single trial (Dale and Buckner 1997; Josephs and Henson 1999).
Functional data were analyzed by constructing a set of stick functions
at DEMO event-onset times for each of the 12 trial types. Rewarded and

product (Fig. 1, A and B). Our aim was to investigate the basic
parameters as potential DEMO to neural decision processes
rather than the decision processes themselves. Therefore we
used imperative situations in which we had full control over
these parameters DEMO than behavioral choices.
The general linear model used for data analysis comprised
separate regressors for the different stimuli associated with
magnitude, probability, expected DEMO, and uncertainty. Sub-
sequent tests assumed that expected value-related brain activa-
DEMO covary with expected value without discriminating be-
tween different combinations of magnitude and probability that
yield the same expected value. To identify uncertainty-related
brain DEMO, the analysis assumed that uncertainty is
highest for P  0.5, where receiving or not receiving a reward
is equally likely, and decreases toward lower and higher
probabilities (variance as inverted U function of probability,
Fig. 1C). Consequently, brain activations reﬂecting uncertainty
would follow variance as inverted U function of probability.
By contrast, a straightforward value signal would covary
monotonically with the full range of probabilities from P  DEMO
to 1.0 (Fig. 1C). The distinction between the inverted U DEMO the
linear covariations with probability guided us in searching for
separate brain signals for uncertainty and expected value.
Previous neurophysiological studies guided our selection DEMO

ferentially with expected value and uncertainty (Fiorillo et al.
2003; Tobler et al. 2005). As DEMO primarily reﬂects afferent

projection areas of dopamine neurons are the striatum DEMO
prefrontal cortex (Lynd-Balta and Haber 1994; Williams and
Goldman-Rakic 1998), we searched for striatal and prefrontal
regions showing differential relations to expected DEMO and
uncertainty. We used the results from the linear regressions to
search for brain activity that increased phasically at the time of
conditioned stimuli DEMO reward magnitude, probability, ex-
pected value, or uncertainty increased.

bility combinations resulting DEMO the same multiplicative product
would be indistinguishable. In applying this test, DEMO found
similar striatal activations for the same expected values result-
ing from different magnitude-probability combinations (Fig.
4A). For example, activations differed insigniﬁcantly DEMO
stimuli predicting 100 reward points with P  1.0 and 200
points with P  0.5 (expected value 100 points), but activa-
tions were higher than for stimuli associated with an expected
value of 50 DEMO and lower than for stimuli associated with an
expected value of 150 points. Despite the constancy for differ-
ent magnitude-probability combinations, the striatal regions
activated with expected value (Fig. 3, A and E) were sensitive
to individual variations in magnitude and probability (Fig. 4B).
Taken together, activations in the striatum seemed to combine
reward magnitude and probability multiplicatively into a com-
mon signal of expected value but were unrelated to DEMO
As expected value covaries with both magnitude and prob-
ability, we DEMO, not surprisingly, that the striatal region
coding expected value overlapped partly with regions coding
magnitude and probability (Figs. 2, A and G, and 4C). The lack
of coding of expected value in the DEMO, nonoverlapping parts
may be due to lack of sensitivity to one DEMO the parameters or to
lack of multiplicative coding, an issue requiring DEMO exper-
imentation.
In addition, a dorsolateral prefrontal region showed partly
overlapping DEMO of magnitude, probability and expected
value using the regression model but DEMO coding when time
courses were plotted and when multiplicative combinations
were tested (Fig. 5). Parts of medial and orbital frontal cortex
showed graded coding with expected value in the regression
model (Table 2, bottom)DEMO Decreasing activations with increas-
ing expected value were found only in the insula.
Coding of expected value in striatum
To ﬁrst locate activations reﬂecting DEMO and proba-
bility, we regressed responses to reward-predicting stimuli
separately against DEMO in these two parameters. We found
signiﬁcant correlations with brain activity for both parameters
in caudate and ventro-medial putamen (Fig. 2, A and DEMO).
Similar increases were seen in the time courses of activations
averaged across all participants (Fig. 2, B and H) and with
regressions of average activations onto magnitude and proba-
bility (Fig. 2, C DEMO I). These correlations were similar when
the data were analyzed separately in rewarded and unrewarded
trials (Fig. 2, D–F and J–L). DEMO addition, a medial prefrontal
region showed increasing activations only with probability DEMO
not magnitude, as described before (Knutson et al. 2005).
Having established striatal regions coding magnitude and
probability, we aimed to locate striatal activations coding
expected value. We regressed brain activation against expected
value and DEMO signiﬁcant correlations in the medial and
posterior striatum (Fig. 3, A and E), which were also apparent
in the averaged time courses (Fig. 3, B and F). The activations
increased signiﬁcantly with expected value (Fig. 3, C and G)
but not with variance (Fig. 4D). The inverse, decreasing
activations with increasing expected value, DEMO not found in
the striatum (P  0.05). Regressions of DEMO activation against
expected value differed signiﬁcantly from regressions against
reaction time in ventral striatum (Fig. 3H) but not in dorsal
striatum (higher activation with both expected value and
slower reactions; Fig. 3D). These data suggest separate coding
between expected value and the motivational effects associated
with DEMO rewards.
Besides covarying with magnitude and probability, the cod-
ing of DEMO value would require that neural changes with
one parameter compensate opposite changes in the other pa-
rameter, such that activations with different magnitude-proba-

We found signiﬁcant correlations of averaged brain acti-

tions to risk sensitivity and regressed the goodness of ﬁt of

correlations with risk aversion in lateral orbitofrontal cortex

more DEMO (Fig. 7, D–F).
These data suggest that activations in orbitofrontal cortex

Moreover, uncertainty coding appears to be differentially re-
lated to the risk attitude of participants DEMO medial and lateral

DEMO with variance in risk-averse participants (Fig. 8,

0.0001)DEMO Using this same regression model, we found two other
prefrontal regions DEMO showed selective uncertainty coding
depending on individual risk attitude in the voxels coding
reward value. An anterior superior frontal gyrus region showed
decreases with DEMO only in risk-averse participants (Fig. 9,
A–G), whereas a DEMO inferior frontal gyrus region showed
increased activation with variance only in risk seekers (Fig. 9,
F–J), suggesting that different value-coding prefrontal areas
subserve the evaluation of risk depending on individual risk
attitudes.
insensitivity of DEMO regions to magnitude or probability as
these regions showed increasing responses when these param-
eters varied independently (Fig. 4B). Neither was expected
value coding due to simple coincidence or conjunction of
magnitude and probability coding. DEMO achieve expected value
coding irrespective of magnitude-probability combinations
would require closely matching response gains, so that re-
sponse reduction with one parameter is compensated by re-
sponse augmentation with the other parameter. Unmatched
gains for magnitude DEMO probability responses would not lead
to unchanged brain responses when decrease in one parameter
together with increase in the other results in the same DEMO
value. The required matching of response gains for magnitude
and probability in regions in which both variables are pro-
cessed make the coding of DEMO value a remarkable
achievement of neural coding.
Apart from the activations reﬂecting expected value we
conﬁrmed previous results indicating separate, regionally dis-
tinct relationships of striatal activations to reward magnitude
(Breiter et al. 2001; Delgado DEMO al. 2003; O’Doherty et al.
2001) and probability (Dreher et DEMO 2006), with the exception
of a block design study that failed to ﬁnd magnitude relation-
ships (Elliott et al. 2003). A previous study found covariations
with magnitude in nucleus accumbens but not with probability
DEMO expected value (Knutson et al. 2005). However, that study
used an anticipatory delay between cues and outcomes in a
contingent action-outcome design DEMO loss trials, which
may preclude direct comparisons with the present study. DEMO
it had been unclear until now whether these separate reward
parameters might be coded in combination as expected value in
parts of the human DEMO and speciﬁcally in the striatum. The
present results suggest that fMRI activations reﬂecting reward
magnitude, probability, and expected value occur in separate
striatal DEMO and well separated from uncertainty coding.
Activations in ventromedial prefrontal regions increased
with reward probability. Previous imaging studies found also
no relation of medial DEMO responses to variations in
reward magnitude, irrespective of probability being kept DEMO
DISCUSSION
This study shows that the two basic economic decision
parameters, DEMO value and uncertainty of reward, were
coded in distinct structures of DEMO human brain. The coding of
expected value involved the striatum and, DEMO a lesser extent,
parts of frontal cortex. The responses covaried with expected
value irrespective of different combinations of magnitude and
probability, although some regions of striatum and frontal
cortex coded speciﬁcally only magnitude or probability. DEMO
activations were unrelated to reward uncertainty. By contrast,
the coding of reward uncertainty as measured by variance
involved regions in the orbitofrontal cortex. DEMO re-
sponses correlated with individual risk attitudes without re-
ﬂecting reward value. Although expected value and uncertainty
appear to be coded mostly separately from DEMO other, some
prefrontal regions showed value-related activations that covar-
ied with DEMO depending on individual risk attitudes.
Taken together the data suggest that crucial parameters for
reward-directed decision-making were coded in the prime
reward structures of DEMO human brain.
The coding of expected value in some striatal regions oc-
curred irrespectively of different multiplicative combinations
of reward magnitude and probability. This DEMO unlikely due to

DEMO or varied (Knutson et al. 2003, 2005). These results
together suggest a preferential relation of ventromedial pre-
frontal activation with reward probability DEMO than magni-
tude. The preferential ventromedial prefrontal coding of re-
ward probability contrasts with the distinct relationships to
both reward magnitude and probability in DEMO striatum. Thus
our ﬁndings conﬁrm that some reward structures process the
basic reward components of magnitude and probability sepa-
rately. It would be interesting DEMO ask what the function of such
independent coding might be. In the St. Petersburg Paradox,
individuals typically refuse to pay all their ﬁnite DEMO
for options associated with inﬁnite magnitude and expected
value, but at DEMO probability (Bernoulli 1954). Thus they
remain sensitive to independent variations DEMO the components
of expected value, and the presently observed separate coding
DEMO probability and magnitude may support such sensitivity.
The short trial duration of 1.5 s might have compromised the
separation of activations in relation to DEMO cues and rewards.
However, we analyzed rewarded trials separately from unre-
DEMO trials and found comparable results. The separations
suggest that the observed relationships to reward magnitude,
probability, and expected value reﬂect predominantly re-
sponses to the speciﬁc cues rather than the rewards. The similar
activations in DEMO and unrewarded trials would rule out
major contributions of reward prediction error coding that
should differ across the different degrees of positive and
negative DEMO prediction errors in probability schedules (Mc-
Clure et al. 2003; O’Doherty et al. 2003). Despite the motivat-
ing inﬂuences of expected value DEMO behavioral reaction times,
we found no correlation of expected value coding to this
behavioral parameter, suggesting that the activations did not
reﬂect simple motivational factors suggested to play a role in
reward processing in monkey DEMO cortex (Roesch and
Olson 2003). Although penalty and perception of DEMO
control can inﬂuence striatal reward processes (Tricomi et al.
2004), DEMO experiments held these variables constant and the
described activations should not be due to them.
Phasic responses of dopamine neurons are consistently
stronger to DEMO associated with higher reward magnitude,
probability, and expected value (Fiorillo et al. 2003; Tobler et
al. 2005). Conversely, striatal output DEMO show equal
proportions of both increasing and decreasing responses during
expectation and receipt of increasing reward magnitudes
(Cromwell and Schultz 2003), although probability and ex-
pected value remain to be investigated. The striatum forms the
DEMO target region of dopamine projections (e.g., Lynd-
Balta and Haber 1994), and hemodynamic responses measured
by fMRI primarily reﬂect input activity (Logothetis et al.

and F as used for Fig. 8.
2001). Accordingly, the presently observed increasing magni-
tude-related striatal activations resemble more closely possible
inputs from dopamine neurons rather DEMO local striatal activ-
ity. Moreover, the similarity between the currently observed
DEMO activations and phasic dopamine responses extends to
probability and expected value. It is thus conceivable that the
observed striatal activations are partly driven by DEMO
inputs, although dilatory effects on the vascular system (e.g.,
Hughes et al. 1986) cannot be entirely excluded. In addition,
nondopaminergic inputs to the striatum or intrinsic computa-
tions within the striatum might be DEMO for the nonho-
mogeneous, differential coding of magnitude and probability
separate DEMO expected value.
A major current ﬁnding consists of separate regions in the
striatum and lateral orbitofrontal cortex that show distinct
activations with expected value DEMO uncertainty. Expected
value and uncertainty of choice options are important param-
eters that determine behavioral preferences. They often vary
independently when individual risk attitudes DEMO over sit-
uations and time (Caraco et al. 1980, 1990; DEMO and Krebs
1986). It is therefore advantageous for agents to have an
independent neuronal representation of both to choose accord-
ing to individual DEMO preference while retaining sensitivity to
variations in expected value. Thus by independently represent-
ing expected value and uncertainty, the currently observed
striatal and orbitofrontal activations could make independent
contributions to decisions involving risky choices.
The presently DEMO orbitofrontal activations with uncer-
tainty relate well to the behavioral alterations in risky situations
induced by lesions in orbitofrontal cortex (Bechara et al. 1994,
2000; Hsu et al. 2005; Miller 1985; Mobini et al. 2002; Sanfey
et al. 2003). Our ﬁndings may also help to explain the altered
orbitofrontal activations during risky decisions in drug addicts
(Bolla et al. 2005; Ersche et al. 2005). The present results do
not necessarily exclude a role of the striatum in coding uncer-
tainty DEMO longer time scales than tested presently. Dopamine
neurons show a slower, DEMO sustained uncertainty signal
(Fiorillo et al. 2003) that might induce striatal uncertainty-
related activations (Aron et al. 2004). Other regions coding
uncertainty could include the posterior cingulate and parietal
cortex (Huettel et al. 2006; McCoy and Platt 2005), although
the present study failed to ﬁnd substantial uncertainty-related
activations in these regions.
The lateral orbitofrontal cortex showed stronger DEMO
related activity with increasing individual risk aversion,
whereas medial orbitofrontal activations correlated with in-
creasing risk-seeking. Thus uncertainty responses are differen-
tially modulated DEMO individual risk attitudes in the two orbito-
frontal regions. Individual risk attitudes are crucial in deter-
mining the utility of uncertain rewards. Expected utility DEMO
postulates that the utility of a reward decreases with increasing
uncertainty for a risk-averse individual but increases for a risk
seeker. The negative and DEMO inﬂuences of uncertainty
increase with increasing degrees of individual risk-avoiding
and -seeking behavior, respectively. The differential orbito-
frontal relationships of uncertainty coding to individual risk
attitudes may contribute to the varying inﬂuences of uncertain
rewards on DEMO for the individual decision maker.
Different prefrontal regions showed different forms of com-
bined coding of expected value and variance. Taylor series
expansion suggests DEMO the expected utility of an option can be
approximated by its mean and variance (and additional higher
moments) (Huang and Litzenberger 1988; DEMO and Krebs
1986). As a consequence, expected value and uncertainty DEMO
separately inﬂuence the expected utility of an outcome. Risk-
averse individuals aim to maximize expected reward value as
well as minimize variance, whereas risk-seekers tend to max-
imize both expected value and variance. A variety of DEMO,
such as bumblebees (Real et al. 1982) and juncos (DEMO and
Lima 1985), are sensitive to both expected value and variance.
The present activations directly reﬂect the inﬂuence of indi-
vidual risk attitude DEMO uncertainty coding in voxels that also

show expected value coding, both for risk averters and risk
seekers. Although these activations may involve separate indi-
DEMO neurons, the close proximity of value and uncertainty
coding may suggest DEMO involvement of prefrontal cortex in the
computation of an integrated expected utility signal. The se-
lective inﬂuence of individual risk aversion on decreasing
uncertainty DEMO contrasts with the selective inﬂuence of risk
seeking on positive uncertainty coding in a different prefrontal
region and may suggest that activations in different DEMO
regions underlie the pronounced differences between risk
averters and risk seekers in choice preferences involving un-
certain outcomes.
In conclusion, we show that reward structures of the human
brain separately encode basic microeconomic reward parame-
ters. DEMO, the striatum carries rather distinct represen-
tations of reward magnitude, probability, and expected value.
Separate activations in the orbitofrontal cortex increase with
reward uncertainty and correlate with individual risk attitudes.
The data suggest largely distinct DEMO of reward struc-
tures to the coding of value and uncertainty of reward-predict-
ing stimuli. The particular prefrontal activations combining
expected value and uncertainty DEMO a single response may
provide the basis for an expected utility signal. Thereby the
presently observed activations may serve as a basis for eco-
DEMO decision-making.
