DEMO RATIONALITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL
LEARNING *

As I understand it, the manifest function of this gathering is to discuss the topic of
organizational DEMO, whereas the latent function is to honor James March. Or is DEMO
the other way around? In either case, it is a valuable and pleasurable undertaking.
Shakespeare subdivided human life into five major stages. We DEMO refine the latter
portion of his scale by taking note, at DEMO given time in our lives, of whom we are just
then DEMO Not long after we received our Ph.Ds., it was time to DEMO our
teachers, as they began to reach the appropriate level of DEMO for such accolades. A
couple of decades later, we found ourselves DEMO our contemporaries and
colleagues. Still later, those of us who are DEMO enough to survive have the opportu-
nity of honoring our students.
Of course, Jim March was never my student. (In my memory of DEMO, back to our
earliest acquaintance, he never exhibited that quality of docility that befits students.)
Nevertheless, I did offer him his first job, and he did accept. Offering was easy. I met
him in New Haven, and had dinner with him, and reached an immediate DEMO I
probably had to clear the decision with the Dean, Lee DEMO, but in those happy days
we didn't worry about faculty DEMO, so it didn't take long. I recount all this as
DEMO of my sound judgement and ability to learn very rapidly. But it wasn't very
hard, at that dinner, to learn that I DEMO dealing with a young political scientist of
unusual promise. And how right I was!
The Organizational Level
One can question whether this anecdote serves DEMO an example of organizational
learning-my assigned topic. It was learning by an individual that had consequences
for an organizational decision-it provided new factual decision DEMO that led to
an offer. But we must be careful not to adopt too strict a definition of organizational
learning, or we will define our topic out of existence, thereby denying the legitimacy
of this conference. All learning takes place inside individual human heads; an
organization learns in only two ways: (a) by the learning of its members, DEMO (b) by
ingesting new members who have knowledge the organization didn't previously have.
But what is stored in any one head in DEMO organization may not be unrelated to what
is stored in other heads; and the relation between those two (and other) stores may
have a great bearing on how the organization operates. What an individual learns DEMO
an organization is very much dependent on what is already known to (or believed by)
other members of the organization and what kinds of information are present in the
organizational environment. As we shall see, an important component of organiza-
tional learning is internal learning-that is, transmission of information from one
organizational member or group of members to another. DEMO learning in
organizations is very much a social, not a solitary, phenomenon.

However, we must be careful about reifying the organization and talking about it as
"knowing" something or "learning" DEMO It is usually important to specify
where in the organization particular knowledge is stored, or who has learned it.
Depending on its actual locus, knowledge may or may not be available at the decision
points where it would be relevant. Since what has been learned is stored in DEMO
heads (or in files or data banks), its transience or DEMO depends on what
people leave behind them when they depart from an organization or move from one
position to another. Has what they have DEMO been transmitted to others or stored
in ways that will permit it to be recovered when relevant?
The justification of a conference on DEMO learning, exemplified in the
papers already presented, is that human learning in the context of an organization is
very much influenced by the DEMO, has consequences for the organization and
produces phenomena at the organizational DEMO that go beyond anything we could
infer simply by observing learning processes in isolated individuals. It is those
consequences and those phenomena that we DEMO trying to understand here. And my
task is to show how some of those consequences and phenomena arise from the fact
that human rationality DEMO very approximate in the face of the complexities of everyday
organizational life. Along the way, I will have some comments on ways in which we
can do research and thereby gain new knowledge about these phenomena-learn
DEMO organizational learning.
Let me perseverate for a moment on that term "DEMO level." Readers of
the book, Organizations (1958), that Jim DEMO and I wrote more than 30 years ago
have sometimes complained that it was not a book on organizations at all but on the
DEMO psychology of people living in an organizational environment. The complaint
was usually registered by sociologists, and was not without merit.
We need an organization theory because some phenomena are more conveniently
described in terms of organizations DEMO parts of organizations than in terms of the
individual human beings who inhabit those parts. There is nothing more surprising in
the existence of DEMO phenomena than in the existence of phenomena that make it
convenient for chemists to speak about molecules rather than quarks. Employing a
more aggregate DEMO of discourse is not a declaration of philosophical anti-reduction-
ism, but DEMO a recognition that most natural systems do have hierarchical structure,
and that it is sometimes possible to say a great deal about aggregate DEMO
without specifying the details of the phenomena going on within these components.
Hence, in what follows, I will have little or nothing to DEMO about the mechanisms
that enable an individual human being to learn, DEMO will focus on the ways in which
information is acquired by organizations, is stored in them, and is transmitted from
one part of DEMO organization to another. I will be concerned with what are usually
called emergent phenomena at the organizational level, and hope that sociologists
will find this essay more "organizational" than was our book.
The Structure of DEMO
For purposes of discussing organization learning, organizations are best viewed as
DEMO of interrelated roles, and that is the way I have been DEMO them here. How
can we conceptualize roles so as to make this concept useful for organization theory?
The point has perhaps not been DEMO in the sociological literature as often
as it should be that a role is not a system of prescribed behaviors but a system of
DEMO decision premises. Roles tell organization members how to reason about
the problems and decisions that face them: where to look for appropriate and
legitimate informational premises and goal (evaluative) premises, and what tech-
BOUNDED RATIONALITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING
127
niques to use in processing these DEMO The fact that behavior is structured in
roles says nothing, one DEMO or the other, about how flexible or inflexible it is.
Each DEMO the roles in an organization presumes the appropriate enactment of the
other roles that surround it and interact with it. Thus, the organization is a role
system.
Organizational Learning and Innovation
Since the organizations I know DEMO are universities, and since I have not engaged
in recent years DEMO any systematic organizational research, I will have to draw upon my
DEMO experiences for most of my examples of organizational learning phenom-
ena. Let us take the case of a university that wants to innovate along DEMO dimension
of educational practice-perhaps by building its instruction around the Great Books,
or by focusing on something it calls liberal-professional education. I'll DEMO the latter
example, which is closer to home.
The graduate schools DEMO which a university draws its new teachers are organized
in disciplines, DEMO of which are saturated with the values of liberal education (and
DEMO them to their students), others of which are devoted to professional educa-
tion. There are no disciplines, to the best of my knowledge, that fly the banner of
"liberal-professional" education. Clearly, a university DEMO wishes to implement this
kind of instruction is faced with a major learning problem for its new (and probably
its old) faculty members. DEMO has no chance of accomplishing its goal without substan-
tial education, DEMO reeducation, of its inductees. Moreover, the reeducation is not a
one-time task but a continuing one, unless the educational climate of the environing
society changes so that it begins to produce graduates already indoctrinated with DEMO
desired goals.
Effects of Turnover
Turnover in organizations is sometimes considered a process that facilitates organi-
zational innovation-getting out of the current rut. But DEMO the case before us, where
the organization is trying to distance DEMO from general social norms, turnover
becomes a barrier to innovation, because it increases training (socialization) costs. To
preserve its distinct culture, an organization of this kind may try to train its own
personnel from DEMO ground up, instead of relying on outside institutions to provide
that DEMO Such inbreeding will have other organizational consequences. (I state
these conclusions DEMO confidently, but they should really be stated as researchable
hypotheses.)
DEMO this with the organization that finds in its environment training organiza-
tions that share a common culture with it. The Forest Service, in Herbert Kaufman's
(1960) classical account of it, is such an organization, counting on Schools of Forestry
to provide it with new employees who are already indoctrinated with its values and
even its standard operating procedures. DEMO same thing occurs, less precisely but on a
larger scale in DEMO professions as engineering, where there are close links between
the engineering DEMO and the industries, with a feedback of influence from
industry to DEMO engineering curricula.
An Experiment on Stability
If turnover is sufficiently low, DEMO values and practices can be stabilized
by the fact that each new inductee finds himself or herself confronted with a social
system that is DEMO well established and prepared to mold newcomers to its
procedures. This phenomenon can be produced in the laboratory (and I believe
actually has been produced, but I cannot put my hands on the appropriate reference).

HERBERT A. SIMON
In a certain experimental paradigm in social psychology (often called the Bavelas
communication network) different patterns of communication are induced in five-
person groups. In one pattern (the wheel) one member DEMO the group serves as leader
or coordinator and all the other members communicate with him or her, and not
directly with each other. In another pattern (the circle) the members are arranged in
a symmetric DEMO network, each member communicating only with the two who
are immediately DEMO The groups are performing a task that requires them to
share information that is given to the members individually (Bavelas 1950).
Now consider two groups whose members are A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and
B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, respectively, where the DEMO's are in the wheel pattern and the B's
in the circle pattern. After they are thoroughly trained in the task, we open all the
communication channels so that each member can communicate directly with DEMO the
others in that group. If they are under sufficient pressure to perform rapidly, the first
group will likely continue to use the wheel pattern of communication and the second
group the circle pattern.
After a DEMO of additional trials, interchange A1 and B1. One would predict
that DEMO groups would continue to use their respective patterns. After a few more
trials, interchange A2 with B2, then A3 with B3, and so on until the original wheel
group is populated by B1 through B5, and the original circle group by A1 through
A5. We would predict DEMO the A's would now be communicating in a circle pattern
and the B's in a wheel pattern. As I said, I believe the experiment has been run, but I
do not know where the results were published. If it works as predicted, it demon-
strates an emergent property of an organization-a persistence of pattern that
survives a complete DEMO of the individuals who enact the pattern.
Let us return to the topic of organizations that deviate from their surrounding
cultures. The example of DEMO deviant university can be extended to virtually all
organizational innovation. Among the costs of being first-whether in products, in
methods of marketing, in DEMO procedures, or what not-are the costs of
instilling in members of DEMO organization the knowledge, beliefs, and values that are
necessary for implementing the new goals. And these costs can be exceedingly large
(as they are in the case I used as my example). The tasks DEMO management are quite
different in organizations that can recruit employees who are prefashioned, so to
speak, than they are in organizations that wish DEMO create and maintain, along some
dimensions, idiosyncratic subcultures.
A major topic, therefore, in organizational learning is an understanding of the
mechanisms that DEMO be used to enable an organization to deviate from the culture in
which it is embedded. As my university example suggests, this topic can be examined
in the field, and particularly in a historical vein, DEMO following the course of events in
organizations that are identified as distancing themselves along one or more dimen-
sions from the surrounding culture. If DEMO are concerned about the imprecision of case
studies as research data, DEMO can console ourselves by noting that a man named
Darwin was able to write a very persuasive (perhaps even correct) book on the DEMO
of species on the basis of a study of the Galapagos Islands and a few other cases. To
the best of my recollection, there are no statistics in Darwin's book.
Organizational Memory
The process of DEMO unique traits within an organization is a part of the more
general phenomena of organizational memory. Since much of the memory of organi-
zations DEMO stored in human heads, and only a little of it in DEMO put down on
paper (or held in computer memories), turnover DEMO personnel is a great enemy of
long-term organizational memory. This natural erosion of memory with time has, of
course, both its advantages and DEMO In the previous section I emphasized
BOUNDED RATIONALITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING
129
one of its disadvantages. Its advantage DEMO that it automatically removes outdated
irrelevancies (but without discriminating between the DEMO and the irrelevant).
Leaving aside the erosion problem, how are DEMO to characterize an organization's
memories?
Research in cognitive psychology in recent years has made great progress in
understanding human expertise (Simon 1981, Chapter 4). What has been learned can
be summed up in a few generalizations. First, expertise is based on extensive
knowledge-no knowledge, DEMO expertise. A world-class expert in any field (several
domains have been DEMO in some detail) holds in memory some 50,000 chunks
(familiar units) of relevant information. (The 50,000 should not be taken DEMO literally,
but it is correct within an order of magnitude.)
This body of knowledge is stored in the form of an indexed DEMO, which is
technically referred to as a production system. Associated with DEMO chunk is a set of
cues which, whenever evoked by a DEMO, will provide access to that chunk in
semantic memory. The memory DEMO may be of many kinds: the name associated
with the cue, information about the cued phenomenon, things to do about it, and DEMO
on. The physician who sees the symptom (the cue) is reminded of the name of a
disease often associated with it, information about the likely course of the disease,
possible medical action to cure DEMO, additional tests that would increase the reliability
of the diagnosis, and so on.
Armed with knowledge stored in his or her production system, the expert is
prepared (but only in the domain of expertise) DEMO respond to many situations
"intuitively"-that is, by recognizing the situation and evoking an appropriate re-
sponse-and also to draw on the stored DEMO for more protracted and
systematic analysis of difficult problems.
We know also that no one-literally no one-becomes a world class expert in any
professional DEMO with less than ten years of full-time dedication to learning, to
DEMO the 50,000 indexed chunks organized in the production system. The evi-
dence for this time requirement is overwhelming, and child prodigies provide no
exceptions (Bloom 1985; Hayes 1989, Chapter 11).
Against the background of this picture of expertise, the memories of an organiza-
tion can be represented as a vast collection of production systems. This representa-
tion DEMO much more than a metaphor as we see more and more examples of
human expertise captured in automated expert systems. One motive for such DEMO
tion, but certainly not the only one, is that it makes organizational memory less
vulnerable to personnel turnover.
Ingesting Innovations from Without
My DEMO example had to do with organizations trying to retain their identities
in a world of alien ideas, fighting the threat of increasing entropy that comes with the
ingestion of personnel. The other side of the coin DEMO the problem of assimilating
innovations that originate outside the organization, or DEMO have to be transmitted
from a point of origin in the organization to points of implementation. Here, let me
take the research and design process as my example, but again in the context of
universities. The translation to corporate situations will follow.
Research as a Learning Mechanism
So-called DEMO universities usually proclaim that they have a dual mission: to
create DEMO knowledge and to transmit that knowledge to their students. Research
accomplishes the former, and instruction the latter. Of course the real pattern is
much more complicated than that. In the first place, the new knowledge produced by
130 HERBERT A. SIMON
research is usually not initially transmitted to students DEMO the same university, but to
researchers throughout the world, mainly by publication. In the second place, most of
the knowledge transmitted to students in a university is not produced at that
university. Is there really DEMO reason why the research (which is one process of
learning) and the instruction (another learning process) should go on in the same
DEMO?
When we examine the research process more closely, we see DEMO it differs rather
fundamentally from the usual description. In any given research laboratory, only a
tiny fraction of the new knowledge acquired by the research staff is knowledge
created by that laboratory; most of it is knowledge created by research elsewhere. We
can think of a research scientist DEMO a person who directs one eye at Nature and the
other at the literature of his or her field. And in most laboratories, probably all
laboratories, much more information comes in through the eye that is scanning the
journals than the eye that is looking through the laboratory DEMO
It is probably true, and certainly widely suspected, that in any field of research a
large fraction of the less distinguished laboratories could DEMO without seriously
reducing the rate at which new knowledge is created. Does that mean that these
dispensable laboratories (dispensable in terms of the creation of knowledge) do not
pay their way? The conclusion does not DEMO if the main function of a laboratory is
not the creation of knowledge but the acquisition of knowledge. In military parlance,
we would DEMO such laboratories intelligence units rather than research units. They
are units of the organization that are specialized for the function of learning from the
DEMO world (and perhaps, incidentally, sometimes creating new knowledge them-
selves)DEMO
As a matter of fact, in our more honest moments in DEMO, we sometimes
recognize the intelligence function of "research." When we DEMO asked why we require
faculty members who are primarily teachers to publish in order to gain promotion or
tenure, we answer that if they do not do research, they will not remain intellectually
alive. Their teaching will not keep up with the progress of their disciplines. It is DEMO
their research products that we value, but their engagement in research DEMO
guarantees their attention to the literature-to the new knowledge being produced
elsewhere.
It can be highly disfunctional for a laboratory to live with the DEMO that its main
product is the new knowledge produced by its in-house research. Such a belief
produces the NIH (Not Invented Here) phenomenon, with a consequent reinvention
of many wheels.
R & D and Manufacturing
DEMO problems of organizational learning have just begun when an intelligence unit
extracts some possibly relevant new knowledge from the environment (or invents it
itself). The problem of developing new products from (local or imported) DEMO
ideas and of carrying them to the stage of successful manufacture and marketing is a
classical organizational problem of this kind. A successful product DEMO satisfy a
whole range of constraints, the knowledge of which may DEMO in many parts of
the organization. Among these are constraints on product characteristics determined
by end use and markets, constraints determined by manufacturing considerations,
and constraints determined by natural laws over and above those involved DEMO the
nuclear concept.
End use and market constraints. An idea for a better mousetrap originating in a
research laboratory has to satisfy the needs DEMO demands of real-world markets.
Research and development is usually conceived to begin with a key scientific idea
BOUNDED RATIONALITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING
131
which is elaborated through a development DEMO The development process an-
nexes a succession of constraints to the initial research idea, continually modifying
the idea until it satisfies them (or DEMO it appears that they cannot be satisfied).
Acquiring knowledge of the appropriate constraints is an important learning process,
since that knowledge is DEMO widely distributed throughout the organization and
elsewhere, and is seldom all DEMO to the research and development staff at the
beginning of the process (Simon 1976, Chapter 17).
In some industries, control gear would be an example, a considerable fraction of
ideas for new products originates with a knowledge or customers' needs and problems
-the nature and uses of the equipment to be controlled. In these cases, the sales
engineers need to be incorporated in the intelligence process that initiates new
product DEMO Here there is a reverse flow of instruction from the usual
conception of the R & D process.
In whichever direction the ideas flow DEMO the organization, it is clear that
nothing will happen unless they DEMO flow. Normally, the learning associated with a new
product must be DEMO diffused through the organization-many people have to
learn many things, and DEMO lateral diffusion and transfer is far from automatic or
easy. It must overcome motivation obstacles (I have already mentioned the NIH
syndrome), and it must cross cognitive boundaries.
Manufacturing constraints. A common complaint about contemporary DEMO
practice in new product design is that the design process is carried quite far before
manufacturing expertise is brought to bear on it. But DEMO and cheapness of manufac-
ture can be a key to the prospects of a product in competitive markets, and failure to
consider manufacturability at an early stage usually causes extensive redesign with a
corresponding increase in DEMO time interval from initial idea to a manufactured
product. These time delays are thought to be a major factor in the poor showing of
DEMO American industries in competing with the Japanese.
We know some, if DEMO all, of the conditions for making communications between
designers and manufacturing DEMO effective. Each group must respect the exper-
tise of the other, DEMO must acknowledge the relevance of that expertise to their own
problems. Moreover, each must have a sufficient knowledge and understanding of the
others' DEMO to be able to communicate effectively about them. Experience shows
that these conditions are unlikely to be satisfied unless members of each group (or a
sufficient number of members of each group) have had actual experience with the
activities and responsibilities of the other group. In typical Japanese DEMO
practice, this shared understanding and ability to communicate is brought about DEMO
extensive lateral transfer of engineers in the course of their careers.
These examples will illustrate some of the kinds of learning involved, some of the
problems of bringing it about, and some of the mechanisms for solving those
problems when an organization brings in innovations from outside or DEMO to
transport them from one organizational unit to another.
Acquiring New Problem Representations
In my earlier discussion of a culturally deviant organization, I contrasted the way in
which roles (decision premises) are acquired in such DEMO organization from the way in
which they are acquired in an organization that builds upon the culture of the society
that provides it with DEMO members.
In my discussion of research and development, I examined the DEMO in which new
decision premises may be injected into organizations and diffused through them. In
neither discussion did I distinguish sharply between learning that DEMO new knowl-
edge to bear within an existing culture and knowledge that changes the culture itself
132
HERBERT A. SIMON
in fundamental ways. I would like to turn DEMO to that distinction (which clearly is a
relative, and not an absolute one).
In the literature of problem solving, the topic I am now taking up is called
"problem representation." In the past DEMO years, a great deal has been learned about
how people solve DEMO by searching selectively through a problem space defined
by a particular problem representation. Much less has been learned about how
people acquire a representation DEMO dealing with a new problem-one they haven't
previously encountered (but DEMO the chapters by Van de Ven, and by March, Sproull,
and Tamuz, this volume).
Two cases must be distinguished: (1) The learner is presented with an appropriate
problem representation, and has DEMO learn how to use it effectively. That is essentially
what is involved when organizations, already formed, ingest new members from an
alien culture. (2) The organization is faced with a totally new situation, and DEMO
create a problem representation to deal with it, then enable its DEMO to acquire
skill in using that representation. In the extreme case, DEMO new organization is created
to deal with a new task. A new problem representation, that is to say, a role system, is
created.
Creating an Organization
Some years ago I was fortunate enough to have DEMO grandstand seat at the creation of
the Economic Cooperation Administration, the DEMO governmental organization that
administered the Marshall Plan of aid to Western European countries. In that
process, which extended through most of the year 1948, competing problem represen-
tations emerged from the very first days, each DEMO a quite different organization
structure, set of organizational roles, from the others. These problems representa-
tions were not made out of whole cloth, but arose from analogies between the
presumed task of the ECA and DEMO tasks that were familiar to the inventors of the
representations from their previous training and experience.
For example, some participants in the planning drew an analogy between the ECA
and wartime organizations that had supplied essential DEMO to the allies. Others
thought of it as an exercise in investment banking. Others were reminded of the
theory of international trade balances. From DEMO of these views, a set of organiza-
tional roles could be DEMO, and each such structure of roles was quite different
from the DEMO Which representations took root in which parts of the burgeoning
organization depended heavily on the cultures from which these parts recruited their
new members.
DEMO have told elsewhere the story of how this competition was resolved (DEMO 1976,
Chapter 16). One technique used was to disseminate a document that presented one
of the representations (the one based on the balance of trade analogy) persuasively,
and which mapped out its organizational implications. Another technique was to
starve out the units dedicated to other DEMO by denying them new person-
nel.
Why Representation Matters
In my remarks thus far I have said only a little about bounded rationality-about
the DEMO upon the ability of human beings to adapt optimally, or even DEMO,
to complex environments. Attention to the limits of human rationality helps us to
understand why representation is important, and how policy statements imply repre-
sentations. About a decade ago, the U.S. Steel Corporation began to contract its steel
operations and to divert a major part of its DEMO to the acquisition of assets in the
BOUNDED RATIONALITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING
133
oil industry. The motivation of these DEMO was a particular representation of the
corporation's purposes.
If, a DEMO years ago, you had asked executives of U.S. Steel what the DEMO's
goals were, they might have answered: "To manufacture and DEMO steel efficiently
and profitably." If you had persisted further, they might even have agreed that profit
was the "bottom line." But it DEMO have been hard or impossible for them to
describe the company without strong emphasis on its focus on steel. Their views
might have been DEMO: "We are out to make profits, but the way for DEMO to
make profits is to be an efficient steel manufacturer. That is a domain in which we
have knowledge and expertise, and in which we can make good decisions."
For the conglomerate that U. S. DEMO has become, an entirely different representa-
tion is required. The corporation DEMO product divisions that can still be described in
ways that resemble the earlier corporation-the word "steel" applying to some
divisions, and "oil" to others. But in the new representation, these divisions are only
components operating within a larger framework in which the fundamental policy is
to DEMO available funds in the directions that will yield the greatest returns. Within
that framework, new expertise is required: essentially the expertise of an DEMO
banker.
Change in representation implies change-here very fundamental change-in
organizational knowledge and skills. It should not be surprising that under these
conditions we often DEMO massive turnover of personnel at all levels. It is often cheaper
and quicker to import the new expertise and dismiss the old than to DEMO in
massive reeducation.
Conclusion
In this paper, my intent has been DEMO show how concepts that have arisen in
contemporary cognitive psychology for describing human learning and problem solv-
ing processes, and human expertise, can DEMO applied to the analysis of organizational
learning. I have made no attempt to be complete or comprehensive in my account.
Instead, I have been satisfied to present some examples of how specific organizational
situations can be DEMO in terms of these concepts.
Along the way, I have made DEMO few comments on research strategy. I have remarked
on how experiments may be useful for studying mechanisms. But above all else, I
have emphasized the role of careful case studies in research on organizational
learning. By "careful," I mean studies that explore the contents of important
organizational DEMO, the ways in which those contents are accessed (or ignored)
in the decision making process, and the ways in which they are acquired by organiza-
tions and transmitted from one part of an organization DEMO another. Among the
contents of organizational memories perhaps the most important are the representa-
tion of the organization itself and its goals, for it is this representation (or representa-
tions, if it is not uniform DEMO the organization) that provides the basis for
defining the roles of DEMO members.
If organization theory finds it useful to draw upon some of the ideas that have
emerged in cognitive psychology, it will be advantageous to borrow also the terminol-
ogy used in discussing these ideas. Without DEMO toward a higher level of
consistency in terminology than prevails in organization theory today, it will be
difficult or impossible to cumulate and assemble into a coherent structure the
knowledge we are gaining from individual case DEMO and experiments. We will be
continually reinventing wheels. That is a luxury we cannot afford. The happy band of
researchers on organization theory is DEMO small to be kept fully occupied
discovering and verifying the theory just once.
