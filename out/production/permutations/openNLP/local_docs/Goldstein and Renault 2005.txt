Estimating Universities' Contributions to Regional
Economic Development: The Case of the DEMO
Harvey A, Goldstein*, Catherine S. Renault*
1 Introduction
Since the mid-1980s, academic interest in the relationship between knowledge produc-
tion within a region and the region's economic growth and development performance
and prospects has DEMO The reasons for this increased interest include dramatic
changes in the global economy and conditions of regional competitiveness, the in-
creased importance of knowledge inputs in the production of a wide range of goods
and services, and more recently advances in '*the new growth theory".
The relatively severe economic downturn of 1981-1982 hit the traditional man-
ufacturing sectors particularly DEMO In response, economic development officials at
the state and regional levels DEMO investing in a variety of programs and institu-
tions aimed at strengthening their regions' knowledge infrastructure. Public univer-
sities were often the primary institutional recipient for many of the investments in
knowledge infrastructure. Faced with budgetary DEMO, leaders at many public
universities were only too eager to accept DEMO (and the funding that came
with it) for adding economic development to their traditional missions of teaching,
research, and public service. The passage of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 gave univer-
sities an even DEMO incentive to engage in entrepreneurial activities, by giving them
intellectual property DEMO on patentable inventions originally stemming from federal
government-sponsored research.
The purposes of these public investments in knowledge infrastructure have var-
ied among states and DEMO, depending upon particular economic conditions and
perceived needs. Generally, however, DEMO have focused on attracting, nurturing, and
retaining high tech industries and innovative firms, to provide existing residents with
the range of skills and competencies they will need to be productive in the knowledge
economy, and to help the region sustain its competitiveness into the future. Beliefs
about DEMO importance of such investments tended to be based neither upon sound em-
pirical evaluations nor theoretical arguments. Instead they emanated from a few well-
DEMO and celebrated "success" cases such as Silicon Valley in California, DEMO 128
in Massachusetts, the Research Triangle in North Carolina: "We DEMO be the region
spawning the next Apple Computer." There was also DEMO tendency for state and regional

development officials to play "follow the leader" so as not to risk being the one left
behind (Atkinson, 1989)DEMO
For any significant public investment, there is always a range of DEMO about
the magnitude of impacts, their distribution, and the investment's effectiveness in
achieving desired objectives. In the particular case of investments in DEMO production
of knowledge and knowledge infrastructure, the expected regional economic impacts
DEMO around the nature of spatial spillovers and other forms of externalities gener-
ated from knowledge producing organizations. If we focus on universities as the DEMO
inant type of knowledge producing organizations,^ the following questions should be
addressed:
1. To what extent do institutions of higher education, and research universities
specifically, generate regional economic development outcomes that would oth-
erwise not occur?
2. Which university-based activities, e.g. teaching, basic research, extension and
public service, technology transfer, technology development, businesses spin-
ning off from university research, etc, are most responsible for any net DEMO
economic development impacts from the presence of universities?
3. Through what mechanisms, or channels, does knowledge production - broadly
considered - within DEMO lead to economic development outcomes in the
surrounding region? Is it, for example, through economic transactions between
actors or units within the university and external organizations, through spill-
overs, or through milieu effects, which are particular kinds of localization eco-
nomies?
4. What are the DEMO internal and external factors that condition the contribution
of knowledge-producing organizations to regional economic development, and
determine the share of total economic development impacts that are retained
within the region, vis-a-vis the rest-of-the-world?
In this paper we focus on addressing the first, the second, and the DEMO questions.
Our empirical analysis employs a quasi-experimental design with a large sample of
metropolitan regions in the U.S. The results provide us with some DEMO insights on
the third question, the modes of transmission of impacts DEMO universities to the larger
region.
The paper is organized into six sections. The next section lays out conceptually
the different ways universities potentially may DEMO to regional economic devel-
opment. The third section provides a brief, DEMO review of the two primary method-
ological approaches that have been used to estimate university impacts on regional
economic development, and introduces the advantages of using a quasi-experimental
design. In the fourth section we describe the DEMO population, the measures, the data,
the hypotheses, and the DEMO used in the present study, while the empirical results
are presented DEMO the fifth section. The sixth and last section is a conclusion that focuses
^Other knowledge producing organizations include federal laboratories and the full array DEMO corporate
and non-profit R&D labs. In terms of total U.S. R&D expenditures, however, universities comprised 14.0

results.
2 Outputs and Potential Impacts of Research Universities
The literature on the economics of knowledge DEMO and innovation, on knowl-
edge spillovers, and on the changing role of institutions of higher education together
suggest there is a wide range DEMO ways that universities potentially can contribute di-
rectly and indirectly to regional economic development. The modem research univer-
sity, at least in the United States and increasingly in Western Europe, can be consid-
ered as a multiproduct organization. Within legal, cultural, and political constraints,
the research DEMO can choose its optimal product mix in response to perceived
changes in its markets and the availability and prices of its inputs (unlike corporate
R&D organizations, universities do not consider changing locations as responses to
changing market conditions).
Goldstein, Maier, and Luger (1995) synthesized DEMO wide range of literature on in-
stitutions of higher education and identified and described the range of products, or
outputs, from modem research DEMO They then suggested how each of these
types of outputs may potentially lead to specific economic development impacts. The
outputs include: (i) knowledge creation, (ii) human capital creation, (iii) transfer of
existing DEMO, (iv) technological innovation, (v) capital investment, (vi) DEMO
sion of regional leadership, (vii) coproduction of the knowledge infrastmcture, and
(viii) coproduction of a particular type of regional milieu. The DEMO impacts in-
clude: productivity gains, business innovation, new business start-ups, an increase in
regional economic development capacity (for sustained, long-term development), re-
gional creativity, and direct and indirect spending impacts. The hypothesized DEMO
tionships between the university outputs and the hypothesized regional development
impacts can be seen in Figure 1.
3 Available Methodological Approaches
The literature suggests DEMO are two primary ways to investigate the link between
knowledge production and regional economic development: the case study, and econo-
metric models of DEMO production and spillovers.
3.1 The Case Study
We can trace case studies of the economic impact of specific universities in the pub-
lished literature DEMO least back to the early 1970s. These case studies attempt to estimate
the contribution of a particular institution of higher education to the regional DEMO
in one of two typical ways. In the first, a regional DEMO model is used to esti-
mate the direct and indirect spending effects of the organization on the region's output,
eamings, and employment. In the second, a sample of other businesses or organiza-
tions in the region are asked in a questionnaire what the perceived importance of DEMO

university was to the location decision, DEMO and competitiveness, innovation,
and output levels of the respondent's DEMO
A recent article by Thanki (1999) reviews much of the case study literature, par-
ticularly in the experience of the United Kingdom. The author finds that such studies
todate have not been able to capture DEMO of the potential ways that institutions of
higher education can lead to regional economic development, either because of a too
narrow understanding of how regional development occurs, or because of the limi-
tations of the techniques used. For instance, regional input-output models and other
multiplier techniques can only capture economic growth that stems from backward
linkages induced by an institution DEMO higher education's spending. The reliance on
only such techniques fails to take into account the unique qualities of knowledge as
a product of DEMO organizations, essentially treating a university no differently from
any other kind DEMO organization that hires and pays labor and purchases supplies and
equipment from both regional and outside sources. Felsenstein (1994a) reviews a large
number DEMO economic impact studies conducted in the U.S. using input-output and re-
lated multiplier techniques. For the most part, these studies suffer from the same set
of limitations as discussed by Thanki (1999).
Within the case study framework, a more eclectic set of data collection and ana-
lytic techniques have been used to try to estimate a wider range of DEMO regional
economic effects of universities, in addition to those measured by DEMO mod-
els. Several researchers (Brett et al., 1991, Smilor et DEMO, 1990, Ko, 1993, Steffenson
et al., 2000) have focused on "counting" the number of spin-offs from university re-

search centers and academic departments, using newspapers and the regional business
press, as well as personal DEMO as sources. Luger and Goldstein (1991) and Gold-
stein and Luger (1992, 1993) have used targeted questions sent in a questionnaire to
a stratified sample of high tech companies recently located in a region DEMO estimate to
what extent the region's research universities were an important factor in their regional
location decision. By asking the counterfactual, "If DEMO University of . . . were not in
the region, how DEMO would you have located your business in this region: (1) DEMO
likely, (2) Likely, (3) Perhaps, (4) Unlikely, (5) Very unlikely," and then applying a
specific probability to DEMO response, the researchers were able to estimate the total
employment and DEMO in the region's high tech sector that otherwise would not have
been located there.
Goldstein and Luger (1992) also have estimated the DEMO capital impacts on a
region of a university by linking historical student registration and alumni records to
estimate the percent of graduates, by degree and discipline, who have remained and
been employed within the region over time. Felsenstein (1994b) estimates the amount
of university-induced migration to a DEMO (that would not have otherwise occurred)
using Keynesian-type multipliers.
Saxenian'DEMO (1994) comparative case studies of Silicon Valley and Route 128 in
Massachusetts, while not attempting to measure the impact of specific universities
on regional development, tries to explain the difference in economic performance and
success between the two areas by using ethnographic techniques focusing on the extent
DEMO qualities of inter-organizational linkages and collaborations within the respective
regions.
In summary, the principal strengths of the case study approach are: (1) DEMO flexibil-
ity in being able to collect primary data through surveys and interviews, and documen-
tary evidence in the form of internal reports, DEMO order to measure, or count, particular
kinds of university outputs and some of the associated impacts; (2) to be able to gen-
erate information about the internal organization and culture of a particular university
DEMO order to be able to relate these internal attributes to effectiveness in contributing to
regional economic development; (3) being able to generate information about the soft
and "fuzzy" side of how universities may stimulate DEMO development: through
the provision of leadership and the co-production of a DEMO milieu, concepts that are
difficult to measure. The often intensive data DEMO effort to estimate the spending
impacts of the university on the regional economy with the use of input-output and re-
lated multiplier techniques is DEMO always conducted within a case study approach.
The case study approach is most appropriate for counting or estimating incidences of
technology transfer, technological innovation (e.g. in the form of patents issued and
licenses sold), capital investment, and number of business spin-offs.
The principal weakness of the case study approach is solving the "attribution"
problem, i.e. controlling for DEMO putative factors when trying to make causal in-
ferences between university activities and regional economic development outcomes.
This is most problematic for estimating indirect DEMO such as regional productivity
gains, increases in innovative activity in the DEMO, increased economic development
capacity, and regional creativity. In principle one could conduct multiple cases studies
using a standard set of data and techniques DEMO order to mitigate the inability to statis-
76 Goldstein, Renault
tically control for other intervening factors, but this DEMO likely to be impractical owing
to the relatively large cost of conducting individual case studies. In several of the case
studies discussed above, researchers have asked respondents about the "perceived"
impacts, or "perceived importance" of the university, or have constructed counterfac-
tuals, but the use of such data and techniques carries with them some obvious and
significant DEMO threats.
3.2 Econometric Models of Knowledge Production and Spillovers
More recently, DEMO have tried to assess the economic impact of new innova-
tion such as that produced at a university by using econometric models. Early models
DEMO on production functions that contained an R&D variable. Griliches (1979)DEMO
proposed a specific knowledge production function assumed to be Cobb-Douglas in
form, relating Y, some output, to labor, capital and knowledge, measured by R&D
expenditures. This work was based on the empirical work DEMO Solow (1957), which
showed the existence of a latent variable DEMO capital and labor in aggregate pro-
duction functions, and Arrow (1962), who described the impact of learning (gaining
knowledge) on the DEMO function.
Jaffe (1989) modified Griliches' knowledge production function to the DEMO that
is generally used by researchers today: LogK = ao -\- DEMO + a2logURD -h e
where K is some measure of innovation, DEMO is industry research and development ex-
penditures and URD is university research and development expenditures. Jaffe found
"geographically mediated spillovers from university research to commercial innova-
tion." A significant effect of university research on corporate patents was found, par-
ticularly in drugs, medical technology, electronics, optics DEMO nuclear technology. He
states that university research appears to have an indirect effect on local innovation by
inducing industrial research and development spending.
A DEMO of researchers have modified and expanded this model in the last twelve
years or so. Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson (1993) followed up this work by look-
ing at the geographic location of patent citations to DEMO the extent to which
knowledge spillovers are geographically localized. They found that citations to do-
mestic patents are more likely to be domestic, and more likely to come from the same
state and MSA as the DEMO patents. Acs, Audretsch and Feldman (1994) used the
Griliches-Jaffe model DEMO understand the degree to which university and corporate
R&D spills over to small firms as compared to large firms. They found that univer-
DEMO spillover was more important to small firms than large firms. Varga (DEMO) uses
the Griliches-Jaffe knowledge production function to try to model agglomeration. DEMO
develops a hierarchical linear model by modeling each a, to include DEMO dependence
of the knowledge transfer on the concentration of high technology production and
business services.
Keilbach (2000) has taken a different path. Incorporating DEMO work of Krugman
(1991) and Fujita et al. (1999), DEMO builds a dynamic model of regions using the en-
dogenous growth model including human capital and knowledge spillovers, to be able
to separate the effects of spillover and agglomeration. The model builds a class of dis-
DEMO dynamic systems, an n-dimensional array of sites, each with local rules as well as
Universities' Contributions to Regional Economic Development 77
global rules. Assuming the initial endowments of capital and labor are identical in each
region and that DEMO distribution of knowledge is random, that capital moves globally,
labor DEMO locally, but human capital spills over, Keilbach observes agglomera-
tion under assumptions of increasing returns to R&D only. The model demonstrates a
DEMO structure where labor agglomerates no matter what, but agglomerates
quicker with DEMO returns to R&D.
The various authors above, as well as DEMO, have considerably moved forward our
understanding of the nature of knowledge DEMO These studies demonstrate that
knowledge, as an output of an organization, has unique qualities that render knowledge
producing organizations not just like any DEMO large organization that purchases inputs
locally and employs a large of number of people. Rather there are significant external
benefits of knowledge production in DEMO form of spatial spillovers that lead to higher
levels of innovative activity among other firms within the region.
There are, however, some limitations DEMO the use of this approach for estimating the
contribution of universities to regional economic development. These include mea-
surement and data issues, the limited scope of potential outputs and impacts stemming
from universities, and thus the limited ability to separate different ways that universi-
ties contribute to regional DEMO development.
The primary challenge with using these types of models is how to measure the
dependent variable, innovation. Jaffe (1989) quotes Griliches as saying, "The dream of
getting hold of an output indicator of DEMO activity is one of the strong motivating
forces for economic research in this area." Since we do not know how to measure
innovation directly, we use proxy indicators, each with their own inherent challenges.
Varga (2000) and Acs, Audretsch and Feldman (1994) use a one-time DEMO section
data set from the Small Business Administration on new product introductions. They
reason that these innovations had market value since companies introduced them DEMO
that this was a better measure than patents or other pre-market indicators. From a
company point of view, product introductions are still indicators of "probable" market
value. Until sales of a product are known, the market value is still a prediction. So,
while it is true DEMO product introductions, being further down the product development
chain than patents, are probably better indicators of innovations with market value,
they are DEMO predictors, not measures. The other significant issue with this data set DEMO
that it is a one-time indicator, constructed in 1982, and now highly dated.
Jaffe (1989) and Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson (1993) use the number of patents
as their dependent variable. There are a DEMO of issues with this indicator, as Jaffe rec-
ognized at the DEMO For instance, there are factors outside knowledge generation that
affect the DEMO of patents that may arise from a given piece of research and devel-
opment.
First, not all innovation is patentable. Other types of innovation not included in
patents are codified knowledge embodied in copyrights, trade secrets and scientific
papers as well as tacit know-how and shared expertise. Since DEMO transmission of tacit
information is an important explanation of why spillover has local effects (as com-
pared to patents that can be licensed worldwide), our inability to measure this dimen-
sion is a significant handicap.
DEMO, especially within universities, changes in patenting policies and the uni-
78 Goldstein, Renault
versity's fiscal environment significantly affect the number of patents applied for and
granted. Thursby and Thursby (2000), for instance, have shown that the recent growth
in licensing activity at U.S. research universities has been based on input growth (i.e.
more disclosures) of DEMO quality and an increase in the propensity of administra-
tors to patent and license faculty inventions as a revenue raising strategy.
In fact, the general hypothesis has been that patents are a proxy for inventive output
DEMO patent citations are a proxy for knowledge flows or spillover, the DEMO source of
innovation. Recent work (Hall, Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2000) strongly suggests that
patent citations are well correlated with the market value DEMO knowledge and are the
best indicator of innovation and knowledge spillover. To date, patent citations have
not been used in the knowledge production function, although Jaffe and Trajtenberg
(1996) do use them to find that diffusion of knowledge is geographically localized.^
The second major limitation of this DEMO for our purposes is that while it
yields estimates on some of the outputs of universities, i.e. technological innovation,
it does not take into account other outputs of universities discussed in section 2 above
- DEMO capital creation, building regional capacity, stimulating business start-ups,
and the regional milieu effect - that potentially have regional economic development
impacts.
4 DEMO Quasi-Experimental Approach
Quasi-experimental designs are best described in comparison to true experimental de-
signs. The hallmarks of true experimental designs are that the researcher DEMO ma-
nipulate how and which cases receive a "treatment", such DEMO the treatment can be
randomly assigned to cases drawn from a sample of a given study population. Ran-
domization means that probabilistically there should DEMO no systematic difference on
any rival causal factors between those cases receiving the treatment and those that do
not. Thus any differences in the DEMO variable between the treatment and non-
treatment groups can normally be attributed to the treatment effect.
In field settings as opposed to laboratory settings, the ability of researchers to
randomly select cases for treatment is rare. DEMO they must accept the naturally oc-
curring variation in a given treatment variable, in this case the regional distribution
of universities by size and type. In other cases, it may be technically feasible for re-
searchers to manipulate the selection of cases for treatment or nontreatment, but it
is ethically prohibited. Quasi-experimental designs are a class of designs in which
DEMO researcher strategically manipulates the study population, the time period, and the
sampling so as to construct control groups that enable one to control DEMO some of the
rival factors that cannot be explicitly included as variables in a statistical model. Cook
and Campbell (1979) and Shadish, Cook and Campbell (2002) provide comprehensive
and detailed descriptions of quasi-experimental designs.
DEMO control group cases can not be assumed to be equivalent to the treatment cases
in all respects except for the treatment variable itself. However, such selection differ-
^A third measure of innovation that has been used DEMO R&D intensity. This is measured by the number
or percentage of R&D employees. Keilbach, when testing his model on 327 Kreise (DEMO) of West
Germany, used R&D employment as a proxy for R&D intensity.
Universities' Contributions to Regional Economic Development 79
ences can be taken into account by measuring and comparing gain scores - differences
in the outcome DEMO(s) between a pretest and posttest - instead of just comparing
DEMO scores.
In the context of conducting research on the relationship between knowledge pro-
duction in a region and regional economic development outcomes, the presence of re-
search universities or other significant knowledge-producing organization in a region
DEMO represent the treatment variable. The dependent variable would be the gain, DEMO
difference, of some meaningful economic development outcome over a pertinent time
DEMO The control group would consist of regions that did not have research uni-
versities (or other significant knowledge-producing organizations). Additional control
groups may be selected so as to effectively control for other factors that might DEMO
explain variations in the dependent variable in addition to the presence or absence of
a research university. Thus, we might select two treatment groups, one with small-
to medium-sized regions with research universities and one with large-sized regions
with research universities, and two control groups (small to DEMO without research
universities, and large without research universities). We then DEMO the gains for
all four groups, to take into account the DEMO of agglomeration economies and its
interaction with the presence of universities.
It is important to distinguish quasi-experimental designs from more commonly
used large sample DEMO statistical analyses. In the latter, the researcher would
randomly select a DEMO sample of regions from the full population available, enter
measures on DEMO number of variables that the literature has suggested may explain the
dependent variable into a multiple regression model, and then estimate the model.
The interpretation of the effect of research universities would be based upon the DEMO
nificance, sign, and magnitude of the coefficient estimate on the measure(s) selected
for the presence or level of activity of a research university in the region. In effect, the
researcher statistically controls for all other factors by entering these explicitly into
the model. In contrast, quasi-experimental designs first attempt to control for other
putative factors by the strategic DEMO of treatment and control groups such that for
some putative causal variables there is no variation allowed. For others there is an
attempt to DEMO variation. Only after these possibilities are practically exhausted
does the researcher introduce statistical controls.
Although quasi-experimental designs have been used occasionally in published
regional DEMO (e.g. Isserman, 1987, Isserman and Merrifield, 1987), to the authors'
knowledge, they have not been utilized in attempts to estimate the contribution of
knowledge-producing organizations to regional economic development.
4.1 Study Objectives, Unit of Analysis, and Study Population
The objectives of this study are (1) to estimate the magnitude of the contribution of
universities to DEMO in regional economic well-being, controlling for other factors;
and (2) to try to separate the regional economic development impacts of different
functions of universities.
The unit of analysis in our study is the metropolitan DEMO area (MSA). All
variables are measured for the MSA. The DEMO population consists of all 312 MS As
80 Goldstein, Renault
in the U.S. on the basis of their 1990 Census geographical definitions."^ The temporal
period is from 1969 to 1998.
DEMO Measures of Regional Economic Development
Our measure of regional economic development is average annual earnings per worker.
This contrasts with many studies that use DEMO capita income as a measure of regional
economic well-being. The most important difference between the two measures is
that average earnings per worker takes DEMO account only earned income, while per
capita income includes unearned income DEMO dividends, rent, interest, and trans-
fer payments. These unearned sources DEMO income are particularly significant in regions
with a large number of retirees. Also, average earnings per worker takes into account
only the economically active persons in the denominator. Finally, average earnings per
worker focuses on the quality of jobs in a region as the most important dimension of
DEMO in regional economic well-being.
To separate out changes in national macroeconomic conditions over the time pe-
riod, including changes in the value of the dollar, we construct a normalized index
for each MSA by dividing the MSA's average earnings per worker by the U.S. average
earnings per DEMO for the same year, and then multiplying this ratio by 100. DEMO, an
index value of 110.0 for a particular MSA means that DEMO average earnings per worker
for that year is 10.0 percent higher than that for the nation.
The dependent variable is calculated as the difference DEMO the index value for a
given MSA between two years. Thus, DEMO a particular MSA had an index value of 110.0
in 1969, DEMO a value of 120.0 in 1999, then the value of the DEMO variable would
be 10.0. Of course it is possible for MS As to have negative values on the dependent
variable.
One benefit of using DEMO in the index value is that it helps control for some
local factors that are endemic to particular areas. For example, in many small MS As
with large universities, the average earnings per worker is distorted downward by a
relatively large number of students employed in low-wage, part-time jobs. This distor-
tion is minimized when the difference, rather than the level, of average earnings per
worker is used.
4.3 Measures of University Presence
We measure the presence of universities in an MSA in three DEMO ways, in order
to test specific hypotheses described below. Our first DEMO is whether there is a top
50 research university located within the MSA at the beginning of the respective time
period. A top 50 DEMO is based upon rankings of universities in terms of total
research expenditures, compiled by the National Science Foundation on an annual
basis^.
"^We DEMO not include five MSAs in our study population because they were considered outliers because
of their size or their physical isolation: Anchorage (Alaska), Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles, and New
York.
^National Science Foundation, CASPAR database, 2001.
Universities' Contributions to Regional Economic Development 81
The second measure is the sum of the total research expenditures over all universities
located within the DEMO for a given annual period. The third measure is the sum of all
degrees awarded in all institutions of higher education located within the DEMO, for a
given year. This third measure directly takes into account DEMO magnitude of the human
capital creation, or the teaching function of DEMO education institutions, separate
from their research and economic development functions.
4.4 DEMO Variables
There are, of course, a number of other causal factors that may help to explain variation
in the magnitude of change in DEMO region's economic well being. First are agglomeration
economies, measured by DEMO total MSA employment at the beginning of the time pe-
riod. We also use three MSA size categories: small, medium, and large employment
levels to partially define control groups.^
Other factors include:
Region of DEMO The region of the U.S. (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) is used
to control for broad shifts in the regional distribution of population, employ-
ment, and capital investment from the Northeast and Midwest DEMO the South and
West over much of the time period. Region of U.S. is measured as dichotomous
variables and enter into the statistical model DEMO three dummy variables.
Industry research activity. The research activity of industry is measured as the num-
ber of industry R&D facilities located in DEMO MSA. This variable controls for
other R&D activity outside universities that may stimulate regional economic
development.^
Industry structure. We include three dimensions of DEMO industry structure of MSAs:
percent earnings in manufacturing, percent earnings DEMO business services, and
change in percent earnings from manufacturing over the DEMO period. These
variables take into account that concentrations of manufacturing and business
services may increase a region's capacity for regional economic development.
Entrepreneurial DEMO Lacking better measures for all regions of the U.S. over the
time period of the study, we use as a proxy the percent earnings in the MSA
from proprietorships (self-employed).
Base-year level of average earnings per worker To control for a possible endowment
effect (the rich get richer . . . ), we include the average earnings per worker at
the start of the time period.
^The size categories chosen for DEMO are: (i) under 75,000 employment, (ii) 75,000 to 499,999, and
(iii) 750,000 and over. The size categories for 1986 are: (i) less than 250,000 employment, (ii) 250,000 to
999,999, and (iii) 1,000,DEMO and over. This yielded 160, 104, and 25 MSAs, respectively DEMO the three size
categories in 1969, and 192, 59, and DEMO MSAs, respectively, in 1986.
^We relied on the listings in Industrial Research Laboratories of the U.S. (New York: R.R. Bowker &
Co., 1970, 1985).

4.5 Hypotheses and Designs To Test Them
The first hypothesis is that research universities contribute significantly to regional
economic development, controlling for other factors. This is tested in two ways. First,
if DEMO, then the gain in average earnings per worker should be higher DEMO regions
with top 50 research universities than those without. We thus compare the mean gain
in average earnings per worker in regions with research DEMO against the same
dependent variable for regions without top 50 research universities, controlling for size
of MSA, region of the U.S., and industry structure, and apply a difference of means test
for statistical significance. Second, in a multiple regression model, the coefficient on
total university research DEMO in the region should be positive and significant,
with other putative causal factors included as control variables.
The second hypothesis is that universities' technology development activity con-
tributes significantly to regional economic development. Without a DEMO direct mea-
sure of university technology development for all institutions of higher education
within the MSA, we employ one of the strategies of quasi-experimental designs, i.e.
manipulation of the time period. We split the full time period into two parts: 1969 to
1986 and 1986 to 1999. The rationale for this is that around the middle of the 1980s,
DEMO universities started to incorporate economic development missions, both in re-
sponse DEMO reductions in federal research support and the Bayh-Dole Act (Feller, 1990),
as well as the initiatives of many state legislatures promoting universities as economic
development actors in response to the 1981-82 recession and lagging DEMO
ness. Around the mid-1980s, universities began creating technology transfer offices
to DEMO patenting and licensing activities, building incubators and research parks
and, occasionally, creating or investing in venture capital funds. Thus, if universi-
ties' involvement in technology development in various forms has been an important
contributor DEMO regional economic development, then the difference in the dependent
variable (gain in average earnings per worker) between regions with research univer-
sities and those without should be larger in the 1986 to 1999 period compared DEMO the
1969 to 1986 period.
The third hypothesis is that human capital creation (teaching) and the milieu func-
tions are important contributors to DEMO economic development, controlling for the
magnitude of research and technology development DEMO Human capital creation
and milieu, together, are measured by the number of degrees awarded annually by all
institutions of higher education in the DEMO If this is true, then the coefficient in the
multiple regression DEMO will be positive and significant in both time periods.
The fourth hypothesis we investigate is whether agglomeration is more important
than the presence of DEMO universities as a contributor to regional economic de-
velopment. If this is true, then the coefficient for size of MSA will be positive and
significant, and stronger than coefficients on measures of university presence vari-
ables in the regression model, and more so in the 1986 to 1999 period than the earlier
period.
The fifth hypothesis is a variant on DEMO fourth: that there is interaction between
presence of research universities and DEMO More specifically, our hunch is
that they are substitutes. If this DEMO true, then the effect of research universities will
Universities' Contributions to Regional Economic Development 83
be smaller the larger the MSA. This is tested by comparing the difference of means
between MSAs DEMO top 50 research universities against those without top 50 research
universities, DEMO size class. The differences should be largest for the smallest class of
MSAs, and smallest for the largest class of MSAs. These differences should also be
more prominent in the 1986 to 1999 period than the DEMO to 1986 period.
5 Empirical Results
As stated above, we conducted DEMO different types of analysis of the data. The first
is a set of difference-of-means tests between MSAs with and without top 50 research
universities, overall, and classified by a number of control variables. These difference-
of-means tests are done for each of the two separate time periods to DEMO able to compare
for temporal differences. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.^
There are no significant differences in change in average earnings per job between
MSAs with top research universities and those DEMO, for the 1969-1986 period.
These results hold overall, and for each MSA size category, location, and type of in-
dustry structure. Two-way DEMO combining MSA size categories, location, and
industry structure also showed that the presence of a research university was not asso-
ciated with change DEMO average earnings per job, except for the one case: large MSAs
located in the South. Here, however, the small number of such DEMO without research
universities outperformed those with top research universities.
The results for the 1986-1998 period tell a quite different story. In the entrepreneu-
rial DEMO period, the differences between MSAs with, and without, top research
DEMO are significant and positive for the overall study population. When we
disaggregate by type of MSA, we get the same results for small MSAs, those in the
Northeast, South, and West, and with both DEMO and low percentages of manufacturing.
Within small MSAs, the positive presence DEMO research universities is most prominent
in the West.
The second type of analysis is based upon OLS multiple regression. Separate mod-
els are estimated DEMO each of the two time segments. These results are shown in Tables
3 and 4.
During the 1969-1986 period, neither total university research expenditures nor
the total number of degrees awarded are statistically significant in explaining DEMO
tion in the MSAs' change in average earnings. The factors that DEMO significant are:
location in the Midwest (negatively related), location DEMO the South (positively related),
MSA size (positive), average DEMO per job at the start of the period (negative), pro-
DEMO of total earnings from the manufacturing sector (negative), proportion of DEMO
employed earnings (negative), number of private R&D labs (positive), and the change
in percent earnings from manufacturing over the time DEMO (positive). The results
suggest that general regional macroeconomic conditions, agglomeration economies,
and aspects of industry structure, rather than the presence of universities, were the
most important factors determining gain in regional economic well-being during this
^In a number of cases the n of one of DEMO groups was small, a condition which often leads to unequal
group DEMO In these cases we used the approximate t statistic (SAS Institute, 1991).

period. Where knowledge producing DEMO mattered, it was outside universities.
The results are sharply different for DEMO 1986-1998 period. Total university R&D
activity is significant and positive, DEMO total number of degrees awarded is significant
and negative. Location still matters, but now the advantage is only for MSAs in the
Northeast. MSA size is still significant and positive, and average earnings per job at
the start of the time segment is still significant and negative. The DEMO of industrial
structure attributes has changed. The relative size of the business services sector -
a measure of the development of the business infrastructure DEMO is now significant and
positive, but the relative size of the DEMO sector and the self-employed sectors
are not significant factors. Neither is the number of private R&D labs significant in this
later period. It DEMO also be noted that the overall explanatory power of the model in
the second time segment is lower than in the earlier one as DEMO by the R-squared.

6 Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Study
Our first hypothesis, that research universities contribute significantly to regional eco-
nomic development, controlling for other factors, was not supported throughout the
full period DEMO study. However, our second hypothesis, that it is the universities' DEMO
nomic development activities that matter most, is confirmed by the data. DEMO the earlier
1969-1986 period, the presence or absence of a top DEMO research university did not
affect the gain in average earnings per worker, while it is a significant factor in the
1986-1998 period. These activities were generally absent in the pre-1986 time period
and quite prevalent in DEMO latter period.
Our third hypothesis is that the human capital creation and milieu functions of the
university are important contributors to regional economic development. DEMO these

Universities' Contributions to Regional Economic Development 87
factors are present throughout the two periods, and the university was not found to be a
significant factor in the earlier period, it appears that these functions are not as impor-
tant as we had thought originally. That MSAs with research DEMO outperform
MSAs without top research universities, in the age of the DEMO economy
and the "entrepreneurial university," controlling for other factors, is expected. That the
presence of universities did not matter one way or DEMO other in the earlier 1969-1986
period, supports the view that the DEMO and milieu functions are not as important
as the research and economic development functions of universities, since the for-
mer functions did not appreciably change over the full period, while research activity
and economic development increased dramatically from the early to the later period.
Indeed, the negative relationship between the number of degrees awarded by all insti-
tutions of higher DEMO in the MSA and the dependent variable for the 1986-1998
period adds further support to this view. The negative relationship can be interpreted
as DEMO tendency toward an oversupply, or saturation, of highly educated workers in the
average regional labor market. Since we do not have any indicator DEMO the milieu func-
tion independent of teaching activity, unfortunately we cannot DEMO these factors
in the interpretation of the results.
Our fourth and fifth hypotheses, the questions of whether the agglomeration eco-
nomies are more important than research universities, and whether there research uni-
versities may serve as a substitute for agglomeration economies, have been debated in
the literature for some time. Our results provide mixed evidence. On the one hand, in
the 1986-1998 period, the only MSA size category for which the presence of research
universities made a significant difference was small MSAs, suggesting a substitute ef-
fect. On the other hand, the coefficient estimate for MSA size in the regression model
for both time periods indicates that agglomeration DEMO, independent of the pres-
ence and size of the university sector. DEMO may be that both of these seemingly contra-
dictory results are true; research universities in small areas can provide a number of
external benefits that urban agglomerations generally provide.
Finally, although the presence of research universities and their scale of research
activity are statistically significant factors in explaining DEMO in average earnings per
job among MSAs in the later period, DEMO strength of the causal relationship is quite
modest. Controlling for other factors, it would have taken an increase of $10 million
in research expenditures among universities in an "average" MSA to increase the in-
dex DEMO average earnings per job by 0.2. To give these numbers some perspective, the
"average" MSA had $30.7 million in R&D expenditures in 1986. If the universities
in this hypothetical MSA had been able to DEMO their R&D expenditures by $10
million more (about a 33 DEMO increase), the MSA would have increased its index
from 100.0 to only 100.2.
Overall, our results provide additional support to the view that universities' re-
search and technology development activities do indeed generate significant knowl-
edge spillovers that are captured within the regional environment, and result in en-
hanced regional economic development. Yet the magnitude of the contribution of DEMO
activities is small compared to other factors.
It would be interesting to conduct a similar study of the contributions of institu-
tions of higher DEMO to regional economic development in European countries.
88 Goldstein, Renault
A number of EU countries recently have had changes in higher education policy that
would encourage universities to become more entrepreneurial DEMO to become more
engaged with the private economy. A study conducted in several years would allow
enough time to observe if there have been DEMO in the magnitude and type of eco-
nomic impacts of universities and other institutions of higher education on their re-
spective regions. Such a DEMO study would allow us to test the hypothesis that
there is convergence, albeit with a time lag, between the role and impacts of DEMO
ties in parts of Europe and in the U.S.
