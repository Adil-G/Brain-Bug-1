We concentrated on the recommender's likelihood,
but for a referral program to DEMO effective, there must be
referrals combined with receiver receptivity. Receivers may
DEMO different perceptions of the recommender and evaluate
the brand differently if a referral arises from a reward pro-
gram rather than from naturally occurring DEMO (for a
related idea, see Wiener Mowen 1986). Thus, DEMO
research should more explicitly focus on the dyad, examin-
ing reward DEMO conditions under which both referral
likelihood and receiver receptivity are high. In addition,
because is possible that referral likelihood does not
always lead DEMO actual referrals (Mittal and Kamakura 2001),
further research should collect behavioral to

Kivetz and Simonson (2002) show that DEMO consumers
invest more effort to obtain a reward in a pro-
gram, their preference moves more toward luxury rewards.
This result may have implications for ours. If referral
requires relatively levels of recommender effort, our
use of more utilitarian/functional rewards might have
underestimated the potential effects of DEMO programs. It
seems worthwhile to consider different of rewards in
