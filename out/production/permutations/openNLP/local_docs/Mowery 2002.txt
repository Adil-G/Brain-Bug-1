1. Introduction
Links between R&D in U.S. industry and research in
U.S. universities have a long DEMO, but recent devel-
opments in this relationship, especially the growth
in university patenting and licensing of technologies
to private ﬁrms, have attracted considerable atten-
tion. U.S. university patenting and licensing have
grown signiﬁcantly in the DEMO of the Bayh-Dole
Act of 1980. The Act’s effects on U.S. research uni-
versities have been the focus of several empirical
studies (Henderson et al. 1998, Trajtenberg et al.
1997, Mowery et al. 2001, Mowery and Ziedonis
2002), which reach slightly different conclusions. The
work of DEMO and colleagues ﬁnds a decline
in the “importance” and “generality” of overall U.S.
academic patenting during the 1980s. Importantly,
this decline is observed DEMO the patents of the insti-
tutions that accounted for the majority of academic
patenting before and after 1980, as well as the patents
of institutions with little or no history of patent-
ing before 1980. Henderson DEMO al. (1998) suggest
that their results could reﬂect either a change in
the internal research culture of U.S. universities that
has caused scientists DEMO engineers to pursue more
applied research that yields less signiﬁcant patents, DEMO
the effects of entry into patenting after 1980 by institu-
tions with little experience and expertise in patenting.
In contrast, Mowery and Ziedonis (DEMO) ﬁnd
that the patents of two universities with substantial

pre-1980 patenting experience display no decline in
importance and generality after 1980. Based on their
analysis of a larger sample of patents issued to DEMO
rienced and inexperienced academic patenters before
and after 1980, Mowery and DEMO conclude that
any changes in the characteristics of U.S. university
patents after 1980 are due in large part to entry, rather
than to changes in university culture.
The Mowery-Ziedonis ﬁndings leave open the pos-
sibility that DEMO characteristics of patents issued to
less experienced academic patenters after 1980 might
improve during the remainder of the 1980s and 1990s
as these institutions DEMO experience in patenting the
inventions of their faculty. This paper examines “uni-
versity learning” in greater detail, seeking to under-
stand whether and why the importance (based on
citations to these patents) of the post-1980 DEMO
issuing to less experienced academic patenters has
improved during the 1980s and 1990s. We ﬁrst
analyze trends during the 1980s and 1990s in the
DEMO of the patents issuing to experienced
“incumbent” academic patenters (universities with
DEMO least six patents issued during 1975–1980) and
“entrants” (institutions that obtained fewer than six
patents during the same period). We then test DEMO
the inﬂuence of several potential sources of learn-
ing for entrants, DEMO cumulative patenting, links
with the Research Corporation (an organization estab-
lished in 1912 that during the 1940–1980 period was
an important manager of DEMO patenting and licens-
ing activities of nearly 200 U.S. universities), and the

establishment by entrants of DEMO technology
transfer ofﬁces.
Our results indicate that the importance of entrant
institutions’ patents improved during the 1980s and
1990s, closing the gap with incumbents during a
period in which the average importance of overall
academic patents DEMO relative to nonacademic
patents. We ﬁnd little evidence of strong “learning
curve” effects, as neither cumulative patenting nor the
(relatively) early establishment of a technology trans-
fer ofﬁce explain these improvements. Links with the
Research DEMO during the “pre-Bayh-Dole” era
also exercise little inﬂuence over changes during the
1980s and 1990s in these characteristics of incumbent
or entrant institutions’ patents. DEMO as these
observable sources of learning exercise little inﬂuence,
we conclude that a broader process of learning based
on spillovers among universities may DEMO for the
convergence in importance between the patents of
incumbent and entrant universities.
2. Data and Methodology
Our analysis uses a data set drawn DEMO all univer-
sity patents applied for between 1981 and 1992 that
were issued before 1994. The population of university
assignees is composed of the DEMO of all assignees
designated as “universities” in the Case Western
NBER U.S. Patents database and all institutions des-
ignated as “research” or “doctorate-granting” uni-
DEMO in the Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education’s 1973 and 1993 reports. These universi-
ties received a total of 11,791 patents. The Carnegie
institutions DEMO for 10,881 of these patents.
Independent medical schools and technical institutes,
small colleges and universities, and patent manage-
ment agencies that specialized in the administration
of academic patents received the remaining patents.
We restrict DEMO attention to the patents assigned
to the Carnegie research or doctorate-granting uni-
versities. These institutions account for over 90% of
the self-administered patent applications DEMO the sam-
ple (rather than applications administered by special-
ized patent DEMO organizations), allowing us
to compare our results with previous analyses.
2.1. Data
We utilized publicly available information contained
on the front page of DEMO U.S. patent to gener-
ate our control sample and to construct our depen-
dent variables. This information includes the patent
number, date of application, date of issue, name of
the assignee, citations of prior art, and the USPTO-
assigned technology class for the patent.
Our empirical analysis uses citations to university
patents to examine changes in the “importance” of
DEMO patents issued during different subperi-
ods of the 1980s and 1990s. Speciﬁcally, follow-
ing a number of previous studies (Trajtenberg 1990;
Henderson DEMO al. 1994, 1998; Trajtenberg et al. 1997;
Mowery and Ziedonis 2002), we use the number of
times a patent is cited DEMO “prior art” in subsequent
patents as a proxy for the importance of that patent.
When the U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce grants
a patent, the patent examiner includes a list of all
previous patents that were DEMO to the claims in
the issued patent. This list is made public as part of
the publication of the patent at the time it DEMO The
patent ofﬁcer is aided in compiling a list of previous
patents by the patent applicant, who is legally bound
to provide with the application a list of all material
“prior art” of which he or DEMO is aware. Patents that
are more heavily cited are widely interpreted to be
more important in terms of their relevance to subse-
quent inventive DEMO
Why might universities with greater experience in
patenting and licensing tend to receive patents that
are more heavily cited? Conversations with licens-
ing ofﬁcers at several research universities and other
ﬁeld research suggested the possibility that DEMO
rienced institutions initially adopted an indiscrimi-
nate policy toward patenting as they entered into this
activity after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act. In this
DEMO, universities patented faculty inventions with lit-
tle evaluation of the market DEMO licenses for these
inventions within industry. As these entrant institu-
tions encountered rising costs and stagnant licensing
revenues, many of them became more selective in
their patenting activities. Other research showing a
correlation between licensing revenues DEMO citations
for licensed university patents (Sampat and Ziedonis
2000, and the work cited therein discuss the links

Learning to Patent
between citations and other DEMO of the private
economic value of patents), suggests that patents that
are more heavily cited are more likely to yield pos-
itive licensing DEMO Accordingly, our analysis
below tests the possibility that entrant universities
were DEMO by the prospect of higher licensing
revenues to become more selective in their patenting
activities, obtaining more important patents and effec-
tively “learning to patent.”
Several issues complicate the use of citation counts
as measures of DEMO importance. First, we observe
only a fraction of a patent’s lifetime DEMO More
recently issued patents will have less time to be cited
than patents issued earlier, resulting in a “right trun-
cation bias” for citations. To eliminate this bias, we
restricted our analysis to patents applied for during
the 1981–1992 period and granted before 1994, and
considered only those citations made in applications
appearing during the ﬁve years following the cited
DEMO issue year.1
A second complication is “self-citation” (i.e.,
citation by DEMO assignee of its previous patents). Self-
citations may be a less accurate indicator of the impor-
tance of a patent than citations by DEMO, and the
propensity for self-citation may vary across assignees.
Accordingly, we excluded such “self-citations” from
our analysis.
Third, it is important to control for overall trends in
the number of citations for U.S. patents issued DEMO
the 1980s and 1990s. For example, if citations to uni-
versity DEMO increase over time as part of a broader
trend of growth in the average number of citations
received by all U.S. patents (e.g., DEMO a result of greater
use of computer-based patent searches), comparisons
of the number of citations to university patents from
different years could overstate DEMO improvements
in the importance of more recent patents. Another
possible source of spurious inferences is differences
in patent-citation propensities among technological
1 Lanjouw and DEMO (1998) suggest that limiting the time
period subsequent to a patent’s issuance to ﬁve years is sufﬁcient
to construct meaningful measures of a DEMO “importance” based
on “forward” citations. Our data on “forward” citations extend
through the end of 1999. Limiting the university patents in our
sample to DEMO issued prior to 1994 therefore enables us to identify
all citations to each patent within a ﬁve-year “window.”
ﬁelds. If such differences in citation DEMO are
signiﬁcant, comparisons of the characteristics of the
patent portfolios held DEMO different institutions may
reﬂect variations in the technological composition of
these patent portfolios, rather than differences in the
importance or other characteristics of patents held by
these institutions.
We addressed these time and technology-class
effects by DEMO a control group of patents
that included one nonacademic patent for each patent
in our academic patent database. Each nonacademic
control patent was chosen DEMO as to match as closely as
possible the corresponding academic patent’s USPTO
technology class (at the three-digit level) and its date
of application. DEMO 307 of the university patents, the
matching algorithm yielded the same DEMO patent.
We thus have 10,574 different control patents matched
with our 10,881 university patents.
This paper seeks to compare the importance of
DEMO assigned to “incumbent” academic paten-
ters with those assigned to “entrants.” We deﬁne as
incumbents those U.S. universities that were issued at
least six DEMO between 1975 and 1980. Conversely,
entrant universities are institutions that were assigned
ﬁve or fewer patents during this time. We constructed
two citation-based DEMO of the importance of the
patents in our academic and control samples: the
number of citations to the patent within the ﬁve years
following its issue; and whether the patent is cited at
all within the ﬁve-year window.
Several studies (e.g., Mowery et al. 2001) have
pointed to the signiﬁcant role of biomedical inven-
tions in U.S. universities’ patenting DEMO licensing
activities before and after 1980. Accordingly, in addi-
tion to DEMO patent class dummy variables in
each of our regressions, we also DEMO separately at the
characteristics of patents within the biomedical and
nonbiomedical ﬁelds, using the taxonomy reported in
Jaffe et al. (1998).
We DEMO consider a number of factors that may have
contributed to entrant university learning. During
the pre-Bayh-Dole era, a number of post-Bayh-Dole
entrants were clients of the Research Corporation,
a leading independent manager of academic patents
DEMO licensing agreements (Mowery and Sampat 2001).
These universities submitted invention DEMO to
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002 75

Learning to Patent
the Research Corporation, which in turn managed the
prosecution and licensing of any resulting patents. In
DEMO 1960s, the Research Corporation began to train
clients to identify inventions DEMO were the best candi-
dates for patenting and licensing. We test the hypoth-
esis that “active” clients of the Research Corporation
in the 1970s (i.e., those that submitted ﬁve or more
disclosures to the Research Corporation in any one
year during that decade) received more important
patents than other entrants during the ﬁrst six years
after the passage of the DEMO Act.
Another potential source of improvements in the
importance of entrants’ patents in the post-Bayh-
Dole period is learning from cumulative experience
in patenting. DEMO this hypothesis is true, entrants with
greater experience in patenting during DEMO
should have more important patents, on average,
issuing after 1986 DEMO entrant institutions with less
patenting experience during the 1981–1986 period. To
test this hypothesis, we analyzed differences in patent
importance between entrants receiving more than the
median number of entrant-university patents during
the 1981–1986 period and DEMO entrants.
Finally, the establishment of a formal “Technology
Licensing Ofﬁce” (TLO) and the hiring of licensing
professionals may have contributed to improvements
in the importance of entrant universities’ patents after
1980. We test the hypothesis DEMO entrants that estab-
lished TLOs more quickly following passage of the
Bayh-Dole Act acquired “higher-importance” patents,
on average, than entrants that were slower to estab-
lish formal TLOs. We compare the importance of
patents assigned DEMO entrants who reported that at
least one-half “full-time equivalent” employee (0.5
DEMO) was employed in technology transfer activities
prior to 1986 with the DEMO of patents assigned
to entrant universities that had not established such
technology transfer ofﬁces by that date.
2.2. Speciﬁcation
We ﬁrst compare the number DEMO citations to academic
patents with the citations to patents in our nonaca-
demic control sample. The count nature of the depen-
dent variable makes DEMO necessary to utilize a negative
76
binomial speciﬁcation in this and related analyses.2
The conditional mean of the negative binomial cita-
tion function is:DEMO

(1)
c
where Appt is a dummy variable that equals 1 for all
patents with application DEMO t, UNIV is a dummy
variable that equals 1 for all DEMO patents, and
Classc is a dummy variable that equals 1 for DEMO
patents in patent class c . Our reported results aggre-
gate the application year dummy variables into four
groups: t = 8183t = 8486t = 8789, and t = 9092 for
application years 1981–1983, 1984–1986, 1987–1989,
and 1990–1992 respectively.3 The patent class dummy
variables span the DEMO classes in our sample.
The conditional mean for the number of citations
to the sample of nonacademic control patents in year

evidence of overdispersion, suggesting that the negative binomial
model is more appropriate.

The ratio of Equations (3) and (2) is the “propor-
tional difference” between the number of citations to
academic patents and the number of citations to the
DEMO patents in year T ,orexp	T . We test for dif-
ferences DEMO the number of citations to univer-
sity and control group patents in year t by testing if
T = 0. Such a test indicates DEMO academic patents
applied for in year T received signiﬁcantly more cita-
tions than the corresponding sample of nonacademic
control patents applied for in that DEMO
To compare the importance of entrant universities’
patents with those issued to incumbent universities
and with our nonacademic control patents, we insert
a dummy variable, ENT, that identiﬁes entrant uni-

and zero for incumbent universities and controls.
Equations (5)–(7) respectively calculate the mean
number of citations to patents in the entrant, incum-
bent, and control patent samples for the application
year t DEMO:
ECitations Entrant

ECitations Control Sample

DEMO expT +c c Classc (7)
Dividing Equation (5) by DEMO (6) yields the
proportional difference in the number of citations
to issued patents applied for by entrants and those
applied for by incumbents DEMO year t = T , or expt .
Similarly, the ratio DEMO Equations (6) and (7) is the
proportional difference in citations between incum-
bent and control patents exp	t , and the ratio of
Equations (5) and (7) is the proportional difference
in citations DEMO entrants and control patents, or
exp	t +t . Testing for the DEMO of the ﬁrst
two differences expt  and exp	t  requires a stan-
dard z-test. We use a Wald test of the linear restriction
DEMO +t = 0 to analyze the difference in citation rates
between entrant and control sample patents.
Finally, to assess whether our various “learning
mechanisms” inﬂuence the characteristics of patents
issued to entrant universities, we identify three char-
acteristics of entrant universities: (a) the existence of
a contractual relationship with the Research Corpora-
tion, (b) above-median levels of cumulative 1980–1986
patenting, and (c) the assignment of at least 0.5
FTE to formal technology transfer activities during
1980–1986. We compare the number of DEMO to the
patents of entrant universities with each of these char-
acteristics with those of patents assigned to entrants
lacking each of these three DEMO We deﬁne
a variable EXPENT that equals one only for expe-
rienced entrants, yielding the following conditional

results from Wald tests of the restriction t +t = 0

relative to the control group patent importance).
3. Discussion of Results
We begin our discussion by DEMO the impor-
tance of patents assigned to universities with the
importance of the patents in our nonacademic control
sample for patents with application years DEMO
1981 and 1992. Following this analysis, we compare
the importance of DEMO assigned to incumbent
and entrant universities during the early “post-Bayh-
Dole” period (1981–1986), and separately examine
biomedical and nonbiomedical patents from these
universities during this period. Finally, we analyze
changes in the importance of patents issued to entrant
universities during the 1980s and consider possi-
ble sources DEMO learning that could explain observed
improvements.
3.1. Are Academic Patents Issued After 1980
Less “Important”?
As we noted earlier, Mowery and Ziedonis (DEMO) ana-
lyzed a related dataset on U.S. academic patents and
failed DEMO ﬁnd a decline in the importance of the “post-
Bayh-Dole” patents of U.S. universities with signiﬁ-
cant experience in patenting prior to 1980 (in contrast
to the results obtained by Henderson et al. (1998)).
DEMO ﬁndings reported below are consistent with the

collinearity, resulting in a sample DEMO of 21,316.
78
Mowery-Ziedonis (2002) results and highlight the role
of entry in affecting overall trends in the importance
of academic patents DEMO 1980.
The coefﬁcients reported in Model 1 of the Tables
1 and 2 indicate that the importance of U.S. uni-
versity patents did not DEMO, relative to that
of nonacademic patents, for patents applied for
during the 1981–1992 period. In Table 1, the “impor-
tance differential” coefﬁcient 	t  remains positive
and highly statistically signiﬁcant throughout the
1981–1992 period for DEMO overall university sample.
University patents received a signiﬁcantly higher
number of citations than the corresponding control
group patents throughout the ﬁrst decade following
passage DEMO the Bayh-Dole Act. Model 1 of Table 2 indi-
cates that university patents were also signiﬁcantly
more likely to receive at least one citation DEMO ﬁve
years of issue than were patents in the nonacademic
control patent sample ( t coefﬁcients remain positive
and signiﬁcant for Models 2–6 in DEMO 1 and 2).
What might explain the disagreement between our
results and those of Henderson et al. (1998)? First,
Henderson and colleagues look at all citations to
university and control patents, but we include only
citations that occur within ﬁve years of the issue dates
DEMO the patents. Most empirical work on patent cita-
tions, however, indicates that citations peak during
the ﬁrst four years after the issue date DEMO the cited
patent, so the effects of this difference in the DEMO
struction of the citation measures used in these two
studies should be modest. Second, our empirical anal-
ysis also uses a control sample that differs somewhat
from that employed by Henderson et al. Henderson
and colleagues DEMO a l/100 sample of all U.S.
patents as a control sample, but our control sample
is composed solely of nonacademic patents that are
matched to the university patents by application date
and patent class. Third, Henderson and colleagues
had access to only eight years of post-Bayh-Dole
patents (those applied for by 1988) and citations that
extended only through 1992. But we use 12 years of
post-Bayh-Dole patents (those applied for by 1992)
and citations to these patents that extend through
1999. Some DEMO the speciﬁcations reported below do
show a slight decline in the importance of patents
issued to experienced university patenters during the

The results of the analysis DEMO nonbiomedi-

3.3. Does the Importance DEMO Entrant-University
Patents Improve During the 1980s and
early1990s?
Our analysis thus far suggests that post-Bayh-Dole
entrants into academic patenting received slightly
less important DEMO, on average, during the 1981–
1986 period than did more experienced incumbents.
If institutional experience in patenting is responsible
for the differences in DEMO between the patents
of post-1980 entrant universities and pre-1980 incum-
bents, DEMO the patenting activities of entrant universi-
ties could result in institutional learning that narrows
the differentials highlighted in the previous section.
Learning by entrants DEMO also result in improve-
ment in the importance of entrants’ patents relative
to the control patents. Accordingly, in this section, we
test for DEMO during the 1980s and early 1990s in
the “importance differential” between entrants’ and
incumbents’ patents ( t = 0) and between entrant and
control group patents ( t +t = 0).
Within our overall sample (Tables 1 and 2), entrant
patent importance was signiﬁcantly lower than DEMO
of incumbents for patents applied for during 1981–
1986 (Model 2), but these differentials are statistically
insigniﬁcant for patents applied for during 1987–1992.
Nonbiomedical patents, where the incumbent-entrant
importance differential was most pronounced dur-
ing the 1981–1986 period, display similar changes in
importance (Model 2 of DEMO 5 and 6). These ﬁnd-
ings suggest that in nonbiomedical ﬁelds, where the
initial post-Bayh-Dole patent importance differences
were most signiﬁcant, the DEMO of entrants’ and
incumbents’ patents is converging for patents applied
for during the 1987–1992 period.
We also examined changes in the importance dif-
ferentials DEMO entrant university patents and con-
trol group patents and report these results in Tables 7
and 8. The results in Table 7 suggest that DEMO
university patents were not signiﬁcantly more highly
cited than control-group patents during the early
post-Bayh-Dole period (Wald test statistics are not
signiﬁcant for the patents applied for in either the
1981–1983 or 1984–1986 periods). Moreover, Wald
statistics also are not signiﬁcant in separate tests
for differences in DEMO between entrants’ and
incumbents’ biomedical patents and for these groups’

applied for during 1987–1989 and 1990–1992 are more
DEMO cited on average than are the correspond-
ing control group patents for the overall sample and
for the nonbiomedical subsample (entrant biomedical
patents applied for during 1990–1992 are more highly
cited than the corresponding control group DEMO).
Table 8 reveals similar ﬁndings for tests of the prob-
ability that a patent is cited at least once within ﬁve
years, with one important exception. For biomed-
ical patents, entrant university patents applied for
throughout the 1981–1992 period are no more likely
to be cited than DEMO control group patents.

Learning to Patent
Overall, these data suggest that the “importance” of
incumbent-university and entrant-university patents
applied for during the DEMO 1980s and early 1990s
converged to a considerable extent. Moreover, this
DEMO reﬂects improvement in the importance
of entrants’ patents, rather than decreases DEMO the
importance of incumbents’ patents.6 The convergence
is most marked for nonbiomedical technologies,
where the differences between the importance of
incumbents’ and entrants’ DEMO applied for during
1981–1986 were greatest. In most of the speciﬁcations,
the importance of entrants’ patents also improves
relative to that of the DEMO controls in the
later cohorts of patents (those applied for after DEMO).
Taken together, these results suggest that entrant uni-
versities do DEMO seem to have learned to patent
during the 1980s. We consider some possible sources
of such learning in the following section.
3.4. Sources of DEMO Learning
We tested for three sources of entrant learning: (1)
entrant universities’ relationships with the Research
Corporation prior to Bayh-Dole, (2) “learning by
doing” in patenting during the early post-Bayh-Dole
period, and (DEMO) the effects on patent importance of
the creation by entrant universities DEMO formally desig-
nated ofﬁces for patent management and licensing. In
this analysis we examine the possibility that “experi-
enced” entrants (deﬁned using each of these indica-
tors of experience) received more important patents
than other entrants. As noted earlier, the coefﬁcient
6 Improvement in entrant patent importance could reﬂect changes
in funding patterns. For example, if an institution’s patent
importance is related to the size of its research base, the impor-
tance of entrant universities’ patents could improve as research
funding increases even in DEMO absence of “learning.” Geiger and
Feller (1995) found evidence of increased interinstitutional disper-
sion in federal funding of university research during the 1980s.
DEMO increased interinstitutional dispersion disproportionately bene-
ﬁted the universities that we classify as entrances, then our results
may reﬂect the infusions of federal research funding received by
these institutions, rather than improved patent management. But
since Geiger and Feller found that funding disparity was great-
est in biomedicine, a ﬁeld in which we ﬁnd little evidence of
improvement in the importance DEMO entrants’ patents, this “disper-
sion hypothesis” seems wanting.

for EXPENT DEMO  measures the difference in impor-
tance between patents issued to experienced entrants
and to those issued to less experienced entrants in
year t.
DEMO 3 in Tables 1–6 report the EXPENT vari-
ables’ coefﬁcients for entrants who were active clients
of Research Corporation before 1980 and for other
DEMO in each period from 1981–1983 to 1990–
1992. The existence of a contractual relationship with
the Research Corporation does not appear to be an
DEMO source of improvement in the importance
of entrants’ patents during the 1980s. The EXPENT
coefﬁcients in Column 3 for the overall sample are
not DEMO in any period (Tables 1 and 2) with
the exception of 1984–1986, where the coefﬁcient is
negative and signiﬁcant, indicating that in DEMO years
entrants who were active clients of Research Corpora-
tion before Bayh-Dole received patents that were less
important, on average, than those of DEMO entrants.
Similarly, in the biomedical and nonbiomedical sub-
samples, there is no evidence that entrants who were
active clients have more important patents DEMO other
entrants after Bayh-Dole, and some evidence that they
have less DEMO patents.
The reasons for the Research Corporation’s lack
of inﬂuence on improvement in client ﬁrms’ patents
after 1980 are unclear and merit further investigation.
DEMO reason could be the lack of incentives for selectiv-
ity by client universities in the submission of inven-
tions to the Research Corporation for DEMO and
licensing. Research Corporation client universities
bore no costs under “Invention Administration Agree-
ments” with the Corporation (See Mowery and
Sampat 2001), and therefore may have lacked the
motivation to learn skills in recognizing and DEMO
ing commercially promising inventions during the
1960s and 1970s. It is also possible that “outsourcing”
patent management activities to the Research Cor-
poration prevented DEMO universities from acquiring
these skills.
A second source of learning is cumulative patent-
ing (“learning by doing”). We tested the effects
of entrants’ patenting experience during the 1981–
1986 period on changes in the importance DEMO
entrants’ patents applied for after 1986 to determine
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002
MOWERY, SAMPAT, AND ZIEDONIS
Learning to Patent
whether entrants with more DEMO patenting expe-
rience during these years received more important
patents, on DEMO, after 1986 than less experienced
entrants.7 In Models 4 of Tables DEMO, EXPENT is set
equal to 1 for all entrants with an DEMO
number of patents (within the entrant population)
applied for during DEMO 1981–1986 period. EXPENT
in Model 4 measures differences between the impor-
tance of patents applied for after 1986 by entrants
that received an “above-median” DEMO of patents
during 1981–1986 and the importance of patents
applied for during these years by entrants with a
“below-median” number of patents for 1981–1986.
DEMO, the post-1986 patents issued to entrants
with greater patenting experience in DEMO 1981–1986
period tend to receive fewer citations, on average,
than DEMO entrants’ patents.
For the full sample, patents issued to more expe-
DEMO entrants during 1987–1989 and 1990–1992
received signiﬁcantly fewer citations than the patents
issued to less experienced entrants during these
periods (Model 4 of Table 1), and we obtain similar
results for the number of “zero-citation” DEMO for
the 1987–1989 period (Model 4 of Table 2). Similarly,DEMO
within the biomedical and nonbiomedical subsam-
ples, there is no evidence DEMO entrants with higher
levels of pre-1987 patenting had more important
patents after 1987, as the “learning curve” hypothe-
sis would imply. These ﬁndings suggest that cumu-
lative experience in patenting does not account for
the improvements DEMO importance of entrants’ patents
observed after the mid-1980s.
Finally, we examined DEMO effects on the importance
of entrants’ patents of the establishment after 1980 of
formal “Technology Licensing Ofﬁces” (TLOs). Using
AUTM (1994) data, we coded EXPENT = 1 for uni-
versities that established a formal TLO (i.e., reported
allocating at least 0.5 FTE to the management DEMO tech-
nology transfer, patenting, and licensing activities) by
1986. The DEMO of our analysis of the effects of estab-
lishing a TLO during 1981–1986 on the importance
7 In separate regressions (not reported), we analyze the average
importance of an institution’s patents at time t as DEMO function of
cumulative patenting experience for the entire 1975–1992 period.
These regressions did not reveal a relationship between cumulative
patenting and patent importance.
of DEMO post-1986 patents are reported in Model
5 in Tables 1–6. Tables 1 and 2 suggest that for the
overall sample of patents, early establishment of a
TLO did not improve patent importance relative to
entrants that DEMO not establish TLOs prior to 1987. The
EXPENT8789 coefﬁcient is negative and signiﬁcant in
both Table 1 and 2, and the coefﬁcient for EXPENT9092
is not signiﬁcant. For biomedical technologies, the
coefﬁcient for EXPENT8789 is not signiﬁcant in Tables
3 and 4, and the EXPENT9092 coefﬁcient is signiﬁ-
cant (and positive) only in Table 4. For nonbiomedical
technologies, the EXPENT8789 coefﬁcient is negative
and signiﬁcant and the coefﬁcient for EXPENT9092 is
DEMO signiﬁcant in either Tables 5 or 6.
These results suggest that early establishment of a
TLO after Bayh-Dole was not correlated with receiv-
ing DEMO important patents during the 1987–1992
period. Indeed, the establishment of a DEMO during
1980–1986 actually is associated with less important
patents during the 1987–1989 period. Although not
deﬁnitive, these ﬁndings are consistent with anecdo-
tal evidence that some universities initially assigned
persons with little knowledge or skill in DEMO and
licensing management when they established formal
TLOs, and that simply DEMO the title of “Technol-
ogy Licensing Ofﬁcer” was not sufﬁcient to success-
fully generate more important patents. Instead, the
establishment of a formal ofﬁce of technology licens-
ing may have been an outcome, rather than a cause,
of “learning to patent.”
Although we are not able to DEMO for their effects,
other mechanisms of organizational learning may
have enabled entrants to improve the importance of
their patents. Organizations can learn from DEMO expe-
riences of others directly (e.g., consulting, personnel
transfer, and conferences) and indirectly (e.g., mon-
itoring of others and informal discussions with col-
leagues). Both of these channels appear to have been
DEMO means for entrant universities to learn to
manage patenting and licensing. For example, Neils
Reimers, founder of Stanford’s Ofﬁce of Technology
Licensing in DEMO, served as a consultant to a number
of entrant and incumbent DEMO technology
licensing ofﬁces during the 1980s, and disseminated
information on procedures DEMO were successful at
Stanford to other institutions.

MOWERY, SAMPAT, AND ZIEDONIS
Learning to Patent
Anecdotal evidence of personnel DEMO among
universities suggests another channel for interinstitu-
tional knowledge diffusion and learning. In the late
1980s, for example, Columbia University, a post-1980
entrant, recruited the former director of the technol-
ogy transfer program at Iowa State University, an
institution with a long history of patenting. The Asso-
ciation of University Technology Managers (AUTM),
founded in the mid-1970s DEMO appears to have dis-
seminated information on “best practice” through its
conferences and professional meetings of university
technology transfer personnel.
Entrant universities also almost DEMO learned
from informal communication and interaction within
the broader community of technology licensing ofﬁ-
cials during the 1980s. For example, Columbia Uni-
versity shifted to a more selective policy toward
patenting faculty inventions after 1981, patenting an
invention only when a probable licensee could be
located (Crow 2000). Columbia’s adoption of this
and other policies resulted from informal discussions
DEMO directors of other university technology licensing
ofﬁces. Similar informal communications and inter-
actions may have contributed to improvements in
entrants’ patent importance during the DEMO and
early 1990s.
Indeed, from the earliest days of university involve-
DEMO of patenting and licensing, universities drew
upon and learned from the DEMO of others in
selecting the inventions they sought to patent and
in the overall management of patenting and licens-
ing activities (Mowery and Sampat 2001, Sampat and
Nelson 2002). This trend appears to have continued
after Bayh-Dole. Feldman et al. (2002) suggest that
universities have learned DEMO one another in using
equity investments as part of their technology transfer
strategies. Seen against these historical and contem-
porary accounts, it would be surprising if universities
did not “learn to patent” via informal channels and
DEMO mechanisms.
4. Conclusion
University–industry interaction in research has long
been an unusual hallmark of the U.S. national inno-
vation system. Although U.S. universities had DEMO
88
much of the 20th century been active patenters and
licensers, DEMO Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 simpliﬁed the
administration of this process (especially DEMO inven-
tions resulting from federally funded research), and
elevated the importance and visibility of these activi-
ties. Bayh-Dole also contributed to the entry DEMO these
activities by a large number of institutions with little
historical experience in patenting and licensing.
This paper has examined the changing character-
istics DEMO the patents assigned to entrant and incum-
bent university patenters during the post-Bayh-Dole
period in an effort to determine the existence and
scope of DEMO in the importance of entrant
universities’ patents. Consistent with the results of
related work (Mowery and Ziedonis 2002), we ﬁnd lit-
tle evidence of a decline in the importance of patents
issuing after 1980 that DEMO assigned to experienced
patenters. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the importance of
DEMO institutions’ patents improved during the later
1980s and 1990s.
Our results provide little evidence to support an
argument that change in U.S. universities’ internal
DEMO culture” after Bayh-Dole triggered a decline
in the importance of academic patents, at least for the
ﬁrst 14 years following the passage of the act. This
ﬁnding does not rule out the possibility, however, that
DEMO changes in the academic research culture may be
occurring gradually and could eventually be revealed
in declines in these measures of academic patents’
importance.
DEMO our analysis seems to suggest that uni-
versities can indeed learn to patent, the sources of
such learning are not clear. Cumulative patenting
experience, historical relationships with the nonproﬁt
Research Corporation, and the allocation of DEMO
trative talent to formally designated technology trans-
fer activities all fail to explain improvement over time
in the importance of the patents in this DEMO of uni-
versities. All of these measures of sources of learning
are ﬂawed, but their lack of signiﬁcance suggests that
a more diffuse learning process may underpin our
results. This speculative conclusion also creates abun-
dant DEMO possibilities for additional research.
