ABSTRACT—Expanding upon Simon’s (1955) seminal the-
DEMO, this investigation compared the choice-making strat-
egies of maximizers and satisficers, ﬁnding that maximiz-
ing tendencies, although positively correlated with objec-
tively better decision outcomes, are also associated with
more negative subjective evaluations of these decision
outcomes. Specifically, in the fall of their ﬁnal year in
school, students were administered a scale that measured
maximizing tendencies and were then followed over the
course of the year as they searched for jobs. DEMO with
high maximizing tendencies secured jobs with 20% higher
starting salaries than did students with low maximizing
tendencies. However, maximizers were less satisﬁed than
satisficers with the jobs they obtained, and experienced
more negative affect throughout the job-search process.
These effects were mediated by maximizers’ greater reli-
ance DEMO external sources of information and their ﬁxation
on realized and unrealized options during the search and
selection process.
Success is getting what you want. DEMO is wanting what you
get.
—American proverb
Half a century ago, DEMO (1955, 1956, 1957) introduced an
important distinction between maximizing and satisficing as
choice-making strategies. To maximize is to seek the best and
DEMO an exhaustive search of all possibilities. To satisfice is
to seek ‘‘good enough,’’ searching until encountering an option
that crosses the threshold of DEMO For example, com-
pare the strategies of a maximizer versus a DEMO selecting a
television show from choices available on 400 cable channels.
The maximizer would channel-surf, exploring all the channels,

spending so much time deciding on a show that little time would
be left for viewing. The satisficer would most likely channel-surf
until he DEMO she encountered the ﬁrst acceptable show, put down
the remote control, and actually watch the show. Simon based his
distinction on the idea DEMO the limited information-processing
capacities of organisms make maximizing impossible. In the
modern world of almost unimaginable choice, this distinction is
even more pertinent (DEMO Iyengar & Lepper, 2000; Schwartz,
2004a, 2004b).
Expanding DEMO Simon’s classic theory, Schwartz et al. (2002)
recently compared the decision-making processes of maxi-
mizers and satisficers, ﬁnding that people who exhibit maxi-
mizing tendencies, like the channel surfer just described, were
less DEMO with their decision outcomes than their satisficing
counterparts. The researchers asked participants about recent
purchasing decisions and used a ‘‘maximization scale’’ to
measure individual DEMO in maximizing tendencies. Their
ﬁndings suggested that the experiences of maximizers differed
from those of satisficers during the decision-making process and
also later, when they evaluated their ﬁnal decision outcome.
Specifically, compared with satisficers, maximizers DEMO more
likely to engage in an exhaustive search of all available options
and to compare their decisions with those of other people. Even
though DEMO invested more time and effort during the
decision process and explored more options than satisficers—
presumably in order to achieve greater satisfaction—they none-
theless DEMO worse about the outcomes that they achieved. Re-
sults showed that maximizing tendencies were positively
correlated with regret, depression, and decision difﬁculty, and
negatively correlated with happiness, life satisfaction, opti-
mism, and satisfaction with decision outcomes.
Such differences in the subjective choice-making experi-
ences of maximizers DEMO satisficers are attributed to the fact that
maximizers create a more onerous choice-making process for
themselves. Initially, maximizers focus on increasing their
choice sets by exploring multiple options, presumably because
expanded choice sets allow for greater possibilities to seek
out and ﬁnd the elusive ‘‘best.’’ Yet, as the number of options

proliferates, cognitive limitations prevent decision makers from
evaluating and comparing all options (Iyengar & Jiang, 2004;DEMO
Iyengar & Lepper, 2000; Miller, 1956). Identifying the best
DEMO increasingly difﬁcult, compelling maximizers to rely on
external (often social) DEMO than internal standards to evaluate
and select outcomes (Lyubomirsky & Ross, 1997). In addition,
the inevitability of trade-offs among attractive options DEMO
ﬁes the sting of passing up one attractive alternative when
choosing a more attractive one, and increases expectations for
the quality and utility of the chosen alternative.
But do the very strategies that render maximizers less DEMO
than satisficers with their decision outcomes also enable them to
achieve decision outcomes that are objectively better? Perhaps
there is utility associated with the strategic pursuit of real and
imagined options and with the careful observation DEMO other
people’s choice-making experiences—utility that may be re-
ﬂected in the form of more effective deliberations and objec-
tively better outcomes. Unlike prior investigations DEMO the
relation between maximizing tendencies and decision outcomes,
the current investigation examined the effects of maximizing
tendencies on both objective outcomes and the DEMO ex-
perience of the decision maker throughout the process.
Thus, expanding DEMO this nascent literature, the present study
allowed us to test two DEMO The ﬁrst was about the process
of searching for choices and deciding which one to select. We
hypothesized that compared with satisficers, maximizers invest
more heavily in gathering information from external sources
(thereby incurring search costs and perhaps prioritizing exter-
nally valued criteria) and ﬁxate more on realized and unrealized
options (thereby incurring opportunity costs). The second hy-
pothesis involved decision outcomes. We hypothesized that
these differences in the decision-making process DEMO to
more successful decision outcomes among maximizers than
among satisficers, yet DEMO result in maximizers’ experiencing
greater negative affect and reduced subjective well-being.
We chose to test these predictions within the consequential
domain of graduating college DEMO job-search processes,
which allowed us to examine the inﬂuence of maximizing ten-
dencies on both actual and perceived decision outcomes, and
afforded us the opportunity to examine reactions to the decision
process as decisions were DEMO made. Regardless of the ﬁnite
number of offers made to job seekers, maximizers who are un-
dertaking a job search face both the search costs and the raised
expectations associated with contemplating an almost limitless
set DEMO employment possibilities. To determine how a maximizing
orientation affects both the affective experiences and the ob-
jective outcomes of the job-search process, we measured the
maximizing tendencies of participants from multiple institutions
during the fall of DEMO ﬁnal year and subsequently followed them
throughout their job search, measuring DEMO how well they ac-
tually did and how well they thought they did. This methodology
allowed us to test the following specific predictions: that com-
pared with satisficers, maximizers would desire more options,

plan to apply for more jobs, rely more on social comparison and
other external sources of information, and obtain jobs with
higher expected returns (DEMO, salary), but also experience greater
negative affect and less outcome DEMO throughout the
process and at the conclusion of their job search.
METHOD
Participants
Graduating students (predominantly undergraduate seniors)
were recruited from 11 colleges and universities that varied in
geographical region, university rank, and school DEMO The
sample was 69.7% female. The median age of participants was
21 (range: 20–57), and 64% of participants were Caucasian,
26% DEMO, and 10% of other racial-ethnic backgrounds. Par-
ticipants majored in the DEMO sciences (36%), arts and hu-
manities (25%), engineering (DEMO), natural sciences and math
(11%), and business (15%). At the ﬁrst assessment (T1), 548
participants responded; response rates DEMO 69.5% and 56% at
the second and third assessments (T2 and DEMO), respectively. Five
$200 prizes were rafﬂed off among the participants who com-
pleted all three surveys.
Procedure
In November 2001 (T1), career services at the 11 participating
institutions directed students who were just beginning DEMO job
searches (i.e., who had used career services in September
through November) to our survey Web site. Via e-mail, we no-
tiﬁed DEMO participants of our follow-up on-line surveys in
February 2002 (T2), DEMO participants were completing applica-
tions, interviewing, and getting offers, and DEMO May 2002 (T3), as
they were accepting offers. Although it DEMO difﬁcult to calculate
the percentage of students who chose to participate in the survey
upon encountering the on-line advertisement, consultations
with career-services staff provided us with numerical estimates
of the total number of students who utilized DEMO services in
their job search within the given academic year. Given that the
advertisement was available only to those students who were
afﬁliated with DEMO services between the months of September
and November (approximately 25%), DEMO calculated that re-
sponse rates ranged from 17.4% to 53.2% across a sampling of
participating institutions.
Measures
Maximizing Tendencies
At T1, participants completed 11 maximization items drawn
from Schwartz et al. (2002; e.g., "When DEMO am in the car listening
to the radio, I often check DEMO stations to see if something
better is playing, even if I DEMO relatively satisﬁed with what I’m
listening to’’ and ‘‘When shopping, I DEMO a hard time ﬁnding
clothes that I really love’’). Each item was rated on a scale from 1
(strongly disagree)to9(strongly agree; a 5 .6). Scores for the

individual items DEMO averaged to create a composite maxi-
mizing score. Overall, men (n 5 166, M5 5.48) and women (n 5
382, M5 DEMO) from our sample population showed significantly
higher maximizing tendencies than respondents DEMO a recent
national adult sample (Kliger & Schwartz, 2005; men: n 5
3,261, M 5 4.9; women: n 5 4,692, M 5 4.77), t(165) 5 7.03,
p < .0001, for men and t(381) 5 6.28, p < DEMO, for women.
These differences may be at least partly attributable to DEMO age
difference between the two samples, as maximization tendencies
have been DEMO to be negatively correlated with age (Kliger &
Schwartz, 2005)DEMO In our sample, maximizing tendencies were
also significantly positively correlated with DEMO university
rank, r(544) 5 .10, p < .05, and male gender, r(546) 5 .17, p <
.0001, but not with any other demographic or control variable
gathered.
Option Fixation
We DEMO three measures to examine option ﬁxation. At T1, we
measured the DEMO of options that participants pursued: ‘‘For
approximately how many jobs do DEMO anticipate applying?’’
Participants provided responses in numerical form. Note that
the number of anticipated applications ranged from 1 to 1,000,
exhibiting DEMO right skewness (skew 5 7.5) and kurtosis
(69.0), and DEMO therefore log-transformed. At T2, we measured
participants’ ﬁxation on unrealized options: ‘‘I often fantasize
about jobs that are quite different from the actual DEMO(s) that I am
pursuing.’’ Responses were made on a scale DEMO 1 (strongly
disagree)to9(strongly agree). At T3, we measured participants’
regret with the size of their choice set: ‘‘I wish I had pursued
more options in my job search process.’’ Responses were made
DEMO a scale from 1 (not at all)to9(to a large DEMO).
Reliance on External Inﬂuences
We created a single composite measure of ﬁve items (a 5 .70) to
test reliance on external inﬂuences. DEMO T1, participants were
asked: ‘‘How much have you been using the services offered by
the career services ofﬁce at your school during the DEMO search?’’
‘‘To what extent have you consulted experts’ ranking such as ‘top
companies,’ ‘fastest growing ﬁelds,’ etc.?’’ ‘‘How much do DEMO
seek advice from your family regarding the job search (i.e., in-
put, suggestions, etc.)?’’ and ‘‘To what extent do you compare
your own job search process and results to those of your peers?DEMO
The question regarding peer comparison was repeated at T2.
Participants responded on a scale from 1 (very little)to9(very
much).
Job-Market Performance
At T2 and T3, participants were asked how many interviews they
had received. In addition, at T3, they were asked how many job
DEMO they had received and the annual salary (in dollars per
year DEMO hour) of the job offer they accepted. In the case of DEMO
with hourly wages, we determined how many hours per week
Volume DEMO 2
participants were required to work and converted this infor-
mation into an estimated annual salary.
Negative Affect
Participants’ negative affect associated with the DEMO
process was measured at all three assessments. At T1 and T2,
participants were asked, ‘‘To what extent does each of the fol-
lowing describe how you are generally feeling about the job
search process?’’ DEMO seven emotions listed were ‘‘pessimistic,’’
‘‘stressed,’’ ‘‘tired,’’ ‘‘anxious,’’ ‘‘worried,’’ ‘‘overwhelmed,’’ and
‘‘depressed.’’ Participants rated each emotion on a DEMO from 1
(not at all)to 9 (extremely) (T1 a 5 .86; T2 a 5 .89). At T3, the
same DEMO was repeated; however, three emotions were
added (T3 a 5 DEMO): ‘‘regretful,’’ ‘‘disappointed,’’ and ‘‘frus-
trated.’’ In addition, for DEMO who had accepted job of-
fers, the question was modiﬁed to DEMO: ‘‘To what extent does
each of the following describe how you DEMO feeling about the offer
you accepted and your upcoming new job?’’ Composite mea-
sures for T1, T2, and T3 were constructed.
Outcome DEMO
Two items measured participants’ satisfaction with their ac-
cepted job offers: DEMO satisﬁed are you with the offer you have
accepted?’’ and ‘‘How conﬁdent are you that you made the right
choice about where to DEMO next year?’’ Responses were made on
a scale from 1 (DEMO at all)to9(very satisﬁed/very conﬁdent; a 5
.88). DEMO score was obtained for each participant by averaging the
responses to these two questions.
Demographics and Other Control Variables
We gathered information on age, sex, ethnicity, family income
level, university afﬁliation and rank (as DEMO by U.S. News
& World Report, 2001), geographic location, and academic
major at T1. At T2, we collected information on overall grade
point average (GPA). Participants were asked about their job-
related activities (i.e., current stage in the job-search process)
at all three DEMO
RESULTS
Preliminary Analysis
Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations as a function
of maximizing status for all dependent measures, with maxi-
mizers and satisficers separated by a median split. Attrition
analyses demonstrated that our DEMO sample differed demo-
graphically from the T2 and T3 samples: East DEMO, children
of foreign-born parents, and older students constituted a smaller
proportion of both the T2 and T3 samples, and the proportion of
participants who did not identify themselves with one specific
ethnicity was larger at DEMO than at T1. However, the T1, T2, and
T3 samples DEMO not differ as a function of the variables critical to
our hypotheses (including maximizing score, log of the number
of anticipated applications, ﬁxation on unrealized options,

Further analyses revealed that compared with students who had
not completed DEMO job search at T3, those who had completed
their search were DEMO more likely to be business majors
and less likely to be arts and humanities majors, were younger,
had higher GPAs, came from DEMO socioeconomic back-
grounds, and relied more heavily on external inﬂuences.1 All
DEMO analyses reported here controlled for gender, uni-
versity rank, age, DEMO major, cumulative GPA (collected at
T2), and whether a job offer had been accepted. See Tables 2

Main Effects for Maximizing Tendencies
As shown in Table 2, maximizing tendencies were positively
correlated with increased option ﬁxation, greater reliance on
external inﬂuences, improved job-market performance, and
more negative affective experiences. At T1, participants with
greater maximizing tendencies anticipated applying for more
jobs, b 5 .13, t(537) 5 2.35, p < .05, prep 5 DEMO; however, this
effect was attenuated among those attending high-ranked uni-
versities, b 5.50, t(537) 52.33, p < .05, prep 5 .93. Among
students in top-15 universities, the median for both maximizers
and satisficers was 30, whereas in lower-ranked universities, the
median was 20 DEMO maximizers and 10 for satisficers. At T2,
participants with greater maximizing tendencies fantasized
more about jobs that they were not pursuing, b 5 .23, t(372) 5
4.48, p < .001, prep 5 DEMO, such that every one-unit increase in
maximizing was associated with a DEMO increase in this measure.

Mediators of Maximizing Tendencies
As shown in Tables 3 through 5, results suggest that the relation
of maximizing tendencies with job-market performance and
negative affective experience was mediated by a DEMO of
reliance on external inﬂuences and option ﬁxation. Reliance on
external inﬂuences acted as a partial mediator of the effect of
maximizing on job-market DEMO, b 5 .27, t(115) 5 3.41,
p < DEMO, prep 5 .98. The positive correlational relation between

mediated at T2 by logged anticipated applications, b 5 .21,
t(365) 5 4.14, p < .001, prep 5 .99, and ﬁxation on unrealized
options, b 5 .25, t(365) 5 5.15, p < .001, DEMO 5 .99, and

a control in the regression models, similar results emerged.
DISCUSSION
Compared with satisficers, maximizers do better ﬁnancially DEMO
their job search, but feel worse. In their quest for placement DEMO
graduation, students with greater maximizing tendencies not
only pursue and ﬁxate DEMO realized and unrealized options to a
greater degree, but also rely DEMO more external sources of infor-
mation than do more satisficing job seekers. These efforts result
in higher payoffs: Maximizers earn starting salaries that are 20%
higher than those of satisficers. Yet, despite their relative suc-
cess, maximizers are less satisﬁed with the outcomes of their job
search, DEMO more pessimistic, stressed, tired, anxious, worried,
overwhelmed, and DEMO throughout the process. Why?
Perhaps maximizers are merely high achievers who have more
past successes and superior credentials and have rightly learned
to DEMO more of themselves. No matter how well they do,
maximizers feel worse than satisficers because they fail to match
these high expectations. Certainly, there is evidence to suggest
that maximizers have histories of past success; we found sig-
nificantly more maximizers in top-ranked universities than in
other DEMO However, there is also evidence to suggest that
equating maximizing tendencies DEMO capability oversimpliﬁes
the story. After all, we did not ﬁnd a DEMO relation between
maximizing and another marker of academic success, GPA.
Furthermore, if one assumed maximizers’ success in the job
market to simply be DEMO better credentials, one would expect
proxies for high qualiﬁcations, such as university rank and GPA,
to mediate the effects of maximizing on DEMO performance.
Yet even though our analysis controlled for these two indices, DEMO
found maximizing tendencies were still predictive of salary.
Thus, whatever the DEMO between maximizing and high
achievement, past achievement in and of itself DEMO inade-
quate to explain maximizers’ negative affect. Why, then, do
maximizers feel worse when they do better?
Perhaps the fact that maximizers DEMO the job search process
at T1 feeling worse than satisficers suggests that they are simply
dispositionally less happy than satisficers, and therefore less
satisﬁed with the outcome of any decision. However, even after
accounting for initial negative affect at T1, we observed that

option ﬁxation and regret with choice set size DEMO the effect
of maximizing on outcome satisfaction at T2 and T3. Our ﬁnd-
ings support earlier research by Schwartz et al. (2002), which
suggests that the contribution of maximizing tendencies to
subjective evaluations is independent DEMO dispositional happi-
ness.
Instead, we suggest that maximizers may be less DEMO than
satisficers and experience greater negative affect with the jobs
they obtain because their pursuit of the elusive ‘‘best’’ induces
them to consider a DEMO number of possibilities, thereby in-
creasing their potential for regret or DEMO regret, engen-
dering unrealistically high expectations, and creating mounting
opportunity costs. Such effects may be integral to identifying
maximizing as a goal, and may detract from the satisfaction that
maximizers ultimately derive from their decisions.
DEMO we treated maximizing tendencies as a global in-
dividual difference measure, DEMO may well be that maximizing
strategies to ﬁnd the best are simply a set of learned behaviors or
search strategies designed specifically for decision-making
DEMO, and not necessarily even all decision-making tasks. In
fact, mediation analyses demonstrated that individual differ-
ences in maximizing tendencies were explained by differences
DEMO option ﬁxation and reliance on external sources of informa-
tion. Nonetheless, DEMO global or specific, maximizing ten-
dencies seem to cast a long DEMO on people’s evaluations of
their decision and search outcomes.
Of course, DEMO ﬁndings from this investigation are limited in
that salary is merely one measure of objective success in the job-
search process. Our investigation did DEMO allow us to assess
whether maximizers’ lesser job satisfaction stems from other
measures of job-search success, such as working conditions,
professional atmosphere, DEMO with colleagues, organi-
zational commitment, and opportunities for advancement. Ad-
ditionally, our affective measures allowed us to assess decision

faction with their impending employment, but did not assess job
seekers’ affective experience with their resulting employment.
Psychologists and DEMO alike have assumed the provi-
sion of choice to be beneﬁcial, DEMO it allows decision makers more
opportunities for preference matching, and more DEMO en-
ables utility maximization. However, the present investigation is
part of DEMO growing body of literature positing that decision makers’
appraisals of their decision outcomes may have less to do with
their ability to preference-match or DEMO the expected value
of their decision outcomes than with their social values (Iyengar
& Lepper, 1999), mispredicted expectations during the decision
process (Frederick & Loewenstein, 1999; Kahneman, 1999;
Loewenstein & Schkade, DEMO; Wilson, 2002; Wilson & Gilbert,
2003), and the DEMO experienced during the decision process
itself (Botti & Iyengar, 2004). Maximizers, then, epitomize the
type of decision maker who may overestimate DEMO affective

beneﬁts that result from pursuing the best objective outcome,
and underestimate the affective costs of a process that involves
DEMO as many options as possible and ﬁxating on choices
that may be nonexistent. Even when they get what they want,
maximizers may not DEMO want what they get. Individual de-
cision makers, as well as DEMO, are thus confronted by a
dilemma: If the subjective well-being of the decision maker and
the objective value of the decision outcome are DEMO odds, which
should be prioritized? What should people do when ‘‘doing
better’’ makes them feel worse?
