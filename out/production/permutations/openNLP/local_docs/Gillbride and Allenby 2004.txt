1. Introduction
Many theories of consumer behavior involve thresh-
olds and discontinuities. The amount consumers are
willing to pay for a lottery DEMO is different than the
amount they will pay to insure against a commensu-
rate loss. A threshold occurs at the point where a gain
DEMO into a loss. Consumers in the market for a new
minivan may not consider offerings above a certain
price because they exceed their budget DEMO, or
because past experience has taught them that higher-
priced vehicles DEMO not a good value. When going out
for dinner, the restaurants DEMO may be very
different than those considered at lunch. Prospect the-
ory, microeconomics, reference prices, and considera-
tion sets all involve abrupt behavior changes under
certain discrete circumstances.
Thresholds and discontinuities are problematic for
empirical DEMO because they can lead to a
likelihood surface that is not differentiable. In a
discrete-choice model, the presence of a consideration
set leads to abrupt changes in the choice probability
as items move into and out DEMO the set. Gradient-based
estimation procedures, such as Newton-Raphson and
the method DEMO scoring, are not appropriate in these
situations because they require a DEMO and dif-
ferentiable likelihood function. Researchers have used
various methods to "DEMO out" the likelihood by

introducing additional parameters and error terms
DEMO the model. We propose an alternative approach
that deals directly with the irregularity of the likeli-
hood surface, preserving the thresholds and disconti-
nuities that are implied by theory.
In this paper we investigate consumers' use of
screening rules as part of a discrete-choice model.
Alternatives that pass DEMO screen are evaluated in
a manner consistent with random utility theory;
alternatives that do not pass the screen have a
zero probability of DEMO chosen. Behaviorally, con-
sumers adopt a "rule" to screen alternatives; this rule
may be the result of previous learning, information-
processing constraints, or solving some previous con-
strained optimization problem. The reduced-form
model we propose is consistent with various theories
presented in the consideration set and DEMO
processing literature.
The proposed model accommodates conjunctive,
disjunctive, and compensatory DEMO rules. It is
formulated for revealed choice data when process
measures or other data, such as acceptable alterna-
tives or attributes, are not DEMO A primary contri-
bution of this paper is the formulation and estimation
of a choice model that reflects a discontinuous deci-
sion process. Our DEMO employs the Bayesian

technique of data augmentation and uses Markov-
chain Monte Carlo methods DEMO integrate over the
parameter space. The approach has minimal informa-
tion requirements and can handle a large number of
choice alternatives.
The organization of DEMO paper is as follows. In ee2
and 3 we discuss two-stage decision processes and
how they relate to screening rules. In e4 we describe
DEMO modeling approach and how it overcomes diffi-
culties associated with a discontinuous likelihood sur-
face. Section 5 introduces an empirical example in the
context DEMO a choice-based conjoint study for a new
camera type. Results are presented in e6, where we
find that 92% of the survey respondents use some
form of noncompensatory screening when choosing
among the choice options. Implications DEMO directions
for future research are discussed in e7.
2. Two-Stage Decision Processes
Consumers use various decision rules to simplify
complicated decision tasks. The choice DEMO pro-
posed in this paper is consistent with two-stage
decision processes wherein a subset of product
alternatives is selected from the universal set, and
the final product choice is from the reduced set.
Theoretical motivation for DEMO two-stage process can
be found in the consideration set and information-
processing literatures.
The term "consideration set" has been used in var-
ious DEMO in the marketing literature. Shocker et al.
(1991, p. 183) DEMO consideration sets as being "pur-
posefully constructed and can be viewed DEMO con-
sisting of those goal-satisfying alternatives salient or
accessible on a particular occasion." Hence, consid-
eration sets are linked to usage occasion. Alterna-
DEMO, Hauser and Wernerfelt (1990) define consider-
ation sets as a DEMO of offerings that receive serious
consideration during the purchase occasion. Regard-
less of its use, researchers in marketing have gen-
erally operationalized consideration sets as compris-
ing alternatives that survive a screening process (see
Hdiubl and Trifts 2000).
Consideration sets have been modeled as the solu-
tion DEMO a consumer optimization problem. Hauser and
Wernerfelt (1990) provide a model where the expected
utility of consumption must exceed the cognitive cost
of DEMO for an alternative to be considered.
Roberts and Lattin (1991) operationalize this approach
using survey data, and Mehta et al. (2003) extend
this structural approach to scanner panel data where
explicit information on consideration DEMO is not avail-
able. These approaches assume that the overall utility
of the offering determines inclusion in the considera-
tion set (see also Montgomery et al. 2003).
An information-processing view of the consumer
leads to DEMO sets determined by product

Marketing Science 23(3), pp. 391-406, c 2004 INFORMS
attributes, not overall utility. These models typi-
DEMO have a less effortful first stage, followed by a
more comprehensive DEMO stage. Payne (1976) and
Bettman and Park (1980) provide evidence that the
formation of the consideration set is linked to a sub-
DEMO of attributes and that the final selection is more
holistic. Bettman et al. (1998) provide an overview
of consumer decision strategies, including the use of
various conjunctive (i.e., intersection) and disjunctive
(i.e., union) rules that can be used for set formation.
Bettman (1979), DEMO (1980), and Bettman et al.
(1990) show that adopting DEMO screening rule based on
a subset of attributes is a rational outcome for a deci-
sion maker willing to tradeoff accuracy against cog-
nitive DEMO
Our model relies entirely on revealed choices
and can accommodate holistic (DEMO, overall utility)
and attribute-based screens. It does not incorporate
information DEMO can be used to determine the process
by which "seriously considered" alternatives are iden-
tified, nor does it require respondents to identify the
set of alternatives that pass the screen. Hence, it is
a reduced-form model that is consistent with the lit-
erature on consideration sets. To DEMO confusion
with prior research, we refer to the set of alternatives
DEMO pass the screening rule in a given context as the
choice set.
3. Screening Rules
The screening rules restrict the set of alternatives
that DEMO evaluated for final selection. The alternatives
included in the choice set are identified with an indi-
cator function, y), that equals one if the decision
rule is satisfied I(xj, and equals zero otherwise. The choice
model can then be written in general form as
Pr(i) = Pr(Vi + Ei > Vj + for all j such DEMO
I(xj, y)-= 1) (1)
where Vi denotes DEMO deterministic portion of utility
of choice alternative i, Ei is the DEMO portion and
it is assumed that the stochastic terms are distributed
independently, xj denotes a generic argument of an
indicator function (I) that reflects the decision rule
applied to the jth offering. Alternative screening rules
DEMO be investigated with the indicator function rela-
tionship, I(xj, y) = 1. Flexibility exists in the specifica-
tion of this relationship because its complexity does
not increase the complexity of estimating the choice
model, as discussed in e4.
For example, if price is used to screen the alter-
natives so that only offerings above a lower thresh-
old DEMO considered, then I(xj, y) = >y). > If
an upper threshold for price is present, then neg-
ative price can be used as an argument, I(x1, y) =
I(pricej

I(-pricei > y). Here, y is a parameter to be esti-
mated. This formulation allows for dynamic choice
sets when an DEMO (e.g., price) changes over the
choice history.
A compensatory screening DEMO is one where the
deterministic portion of the utility of the offering
must exceed a threshold value to be acceptable.
Compensatory Rule:
I(DEMO > y)= 1.
(2)
This screening rule is consistent DEMO considera-
tion sets based on consumer optimization models (see
especially Roberts DEMO Lattin 1991). Assuming that
the stochastic portion of utility has an expected value
of 0, Vj is the expected utility from the offering and y-
the cognitive cost of considering an offering.
Two noncompensatory screening DEMO consistent
with the information-processing literature are also
modeled: conjunctive and disjunctive. DEMO sets
formed by a conjunctive decision rule require that an
alternative be acceptable on all relevant attributes for
it to be included. A conjunctive DEMO is formed by mul-
tiplying indicator functions across the attributes (m)DEMO

is smaller than all DEMO of the attribute, then the
attribute is not used to screen. DEMO nominally scaled
attributes (i.e., 0, 1 attributes), a cutoff DEMO greater
than zero indicates that the attribute is required. Use
of the product m,, results in a conjunctive combina-
tion of the factors DEMO all components must be sat-
isfied for the combination to be satisfied.
The conjunctive screening rule is consistent with an
elimination-by-aspects screening process. One DEMO
hypothesize that a consumer identifies her most
important attribute and eliminates any alternatives
not exceeding a certain threshold. Then she may move
onto her DEMO important attribute, eliminat-
ing any alternatives not exceeding a certain level DEMO
that attribute, etc. Note that the order in which the
attributes DEMO examined doesn't matter: The end result
is that each attribute DEMO be above a specific thresh-
old to be considered. This is identical to the conjunc-
tive screening rule used in the model.
A disjunctive DEMO rule is one where at least one
of the attribute levels is acceptable:

We note that DEMO conjunctive and disjunctive screen-
ing rules directly relate the choice set to specific levels
of the attributes. Estimates of y, will indicate which
attributes, and what levels, are critical to consumers.
Screening rules consistent with DEMO optimiza-
tion (compensatory) and information-processing (con-
junctive and disjunctive) theories have been proposed
to represent two-stage decision making. Our reduced-
form model, Equation (1), however, does not require
that consumers form a DEMO set first, and then
choose from that set. The mathematical representa-
DEMO is silent on any specific procedure. However, it
does capture the DEMO discontinuity in the underly-
ing behavioral model: Alternatives with unacceptable
attribute DEMO (or combinations of attributes) have a
zero probability of selection. A method for estimating
the model is discussed next.
4. Estimating Choice Models DEMO
Screening Rules
Consideration or choice-set models have been applied
in a variety of domains, including the analysis of sur-
vey data (Gensch 1987), scanner panel data (Manrai
and Andrews 1998), and data collected DEMO laboratory
settings (Johnson and Meyer 1984). Johnson et al.
(1989) and Andrews and Manrai (1998) demonstrate
that parameter bias and incorrect inferences result
when the decision process is not correctly modeled.
Choice sets DEMO a complicated structure in the
likelihood function. Consider, for example, a simple
discrete-choice model without choice sets. The choice
probability is
Pr(i) = Pr(Vi + Ei

= Pr(ej < Vi - VI + Ei for all j)

where Vi denotes the deterministic portion of util-
ity of choice alternative i, is the stochastic portion,
and it is assumed that the Ei stochastic terms are dis-
DEMO independently. The probit model is obtained
by assuming that the stochastic terms are distributed
normal, and the logit model is obtained when the
stochastic terms are distributed extreme value. The
discrete-choice probabilities are derived by partition-
DEMO the domain of the error space corresponding to
a choice outcome, DEMO integrating the error densities
over the corresponding region. The regions for a sim-
ple discrete-choice model are indicated in the upper
and lower limits DEMO the integrals.
The likelihood for an observed sequence of choices
is the product of the choice probabilities:

The likelihood surface for simple discrete-choice
models is continuous and globally DEMO (Maddala
1983). Small changes in the deterministic portion of
utility (V) result in small changes in the limits of
integration and small changes in the resulting choice
probabilities. Moreover, unique values of the deter-
ministic portion exist that maximize the probability of
the observed choices. The DEMO of the likelihood
surface allows use of gradient-based methods (e.g.,
DEMO) to solve for values of the determin-
istic portion (V) DEMO maximize the likelihood.
The presence of choice sets destroys the regular-
ity of the likelihood function. As choice alternatives
enter and leave the set, the choice probabilities are
obtained by integrating over an error space of DEMO
ing support. Adding an alternative (k) to the choice
set results in an additional factor in Equation (5),
with an additional DEMO error (Ek) and appropri-
ate limits of integration. The likelihood surface for a
choice-set model is therefore discontinuous and not
necessarily globally concave.
DEMO have dealt with the nonregularity of
the likelihood surface by writing the probability as
the product of a (conditional) second-stage probabil-
ity and DEMO marginal choice-set probability:
Pr(i, C) = Pr(i I C) x Pr(C), (7)
where C denotes the DEMO set that reduces the
number of alternatives in Equation (5). DEMO likeli-
hood function is "smoothed out" by summing over
choice sets:
Pr(i) = y Pr(i I C) x Pr(DEMO). (8)
c
This approach, coupled with the assumption that the
values of the deterministic components {Vi } are con-
stant across DEMO choice sets, results in a smooth and
globally concave likelihood surface.
DEMO estimation of choice-set models using Equa-
tion (8) has historically been approached sequen-
tially, sometimes with independent data. Jedidi et al.
(1996) and Roberts and Lattin (1991) have respon-
dents indicate the acceptability DEMO alternatives in a
survey. Ben-Akiva and Boccara (1995) also use sur-
vey data and employ a logit model for the choice-set
probability. When DEMO data are available to
identify the acceptability of an offering, the DEMO
of choice-set models can employ standard maximum-
likelihood techniques.
If independent data are not available to identify the
choice set, it becomes a latent construct that must be
simultaneously estimated with the observed choices.
Complications arise DEMO the evaluation of the choice
probabilities because the partition of the error space
described in Equation (5) must also be partitioned
with respect DEMO the choice set (see Mehta et al. 2003).

Only DEMO realization of the error vector, e, is associ-
ated with each observation, and it is not appropri-
ate to estimate the two components in Equation (7)
by assuming that each are associated with a different
realization.
An alternative to partitioning the error space is to
parameterize DEMO estimate the point mass of each
choice set in Equation (8)DEMO Andrews and Srinivasan
(1995) use this approach on scanner panel data,
where the probability for each of the 2J - 1 pos-
DEMO choice sets is enumerated. Bronnenberg and
Vanhonacker (1996) propose a different likelihood
function where only J (one for each brand) additional
probabilities DEMO be computed. Each of these mod-
els employs a compensatory function to determine
choice-set probability.
One method of dealing with the dimensionality of
the DEMO is to place a priori limits on the allow-
able choice sets. Fader and McAlister (1990) assume
the choice set is either the DEMO of previously purchased
brands currently on promotion or all previously pur-
chased brands, and they estimate the probability of
each being the actual choice set. Siddarth et al. (1995)
also restrict the number of choice sets to two: the
universal set or a subset of brands stochastically
determined based on past purchases.
Chiang et al. (1999) consider Equation (7) as a
hierarchical Bayes model, where the 21 - 1 DEMO are
assigned a prior distribution and posterior estimates
of set composition are obtained. While this approach
avoids the complications involved with identifying
suitable partitions DEMO the error space to derive prob-
abilities, the choice sets are DEMO linked to the charac-
teristics of the offerings other than through the fact
that the chosen brand is an element of the set. Choice
DEMO with high posterior probabilities comprise offer-
ings that have been chosen and exclude offerings that
have not been chosen.
By contrast, our reduced-form model, Equation (1),
relies on screening rules and not on the enumera-
tion of choice sets. The size of the universal set is
DEMO a concern, nor is it necessary to specify a pri-
ori DEMO attributes are being used to screen (e.g.,
price in Mehta DEMO al. 2003 or promotion in Fader and
McAlister 1990) or place DEMO on the number of the
choice sets. Swait (2001) proposes a different reduced-
form model that is structurally a compensatory model
but mimics DEMO decision rules depending on the
actual parameter estimates. A strength of Swait's
(2001) model is that it can be estimated using stan-
DEMO maximum-likelihood techniques. However, it
requires individuals to identify "unacceptable" levels
DEMO attributes, and it cannot estimate the prevalence of
screening in the DEMO

overall value of the offering. Attribute level screen-
ing can employ either conjunctive or DEMO
rules. We navigate the complicated partitioning of
the error space by employing data augmentation and
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC). We
next describe the use of data augmentation to evalu-
ate the standard probit DEMO in Equation (5) above.
We then show how this method can be used to esti-
mate choice models with screening rules.
Data Augmentation
DEMO evaluation of the probability in Equation (5)
can be avoided DEMO a Bayesian approach to estimation
if the parameters { V } are augmented with a vector of
latent variables, z (see Tanner and DEMO 1987), where
zi = Vi + Ei, Ei ~ Normal(DEMO,
and the model is written hierarchically:
y iz,
1), (9)
(10a)
z iV, (10b)
where DEMO denotes the observed choice outcomes. Equa-
tion (10a) reflects the censoring of the continuous
variables z, where only the offering with the maxi-
mum value of z is revealed to the researcher by the
choice DEMO Equation (10b) reflects the assumption
that the latent variables are normally distributed, with
the mean of each element equal to Vi and variance
one. In marketing applications of the probit model,
the mean is DEMO parameterized Vi = x,3P. Markov
chain Monte Carlo estimation of the probit model pro-
ceeds by drawing iteratively from the two conditional
distributions:DEMO
w(z I y, V) = Truncated Normal(V, I1), (11a)
IT(V I z) = Normal(z, 1/DEMO), (11b)
where "IL" is the identity matrix, and the trunca-
tion in Equation (11a) corresponds to the alternative
selected DEMO the maximum draw. If Vi is parame-
terized as x'I3, DEMO the mean and variance in Equa-
tion (11b) would correspond to the OLS regression
estimate and covariance matrix. Detailed treatments
of estimating the DEMO model with data augmenta-
tion can be found in Albert and Chib (1993), McCul-
loch and Rossi (1994), Allenby and Rossi (1999), and
Edwards and Allenby (2003).
The upper limits of the integral in Equation (5)
that complicate the evaluation of the choice proba-
bility are replaced with a much simpler procedure
that involves DEMO from a truncated normal dis-
tribution. The truncation points correspond to the
limits of integration, and the Markov chain is used
to navigate the domain of the error space consis-
tent with the observed data to DEMO at the pos-
terior distribution of model parameters. Thus, data
augmentation DEMO a clever way of avoiding the
estimation of the integral.
Screening Rules

Application to Choice Models with
Screening Rules
If an alternative is DEMO the choice set, then its choice
probability is determined relative to DEMO other offer-
ings in the set. If an alternative does not satisfy the
screening rule, then its choice probability is zero. The
choice model can be written hierarchically as
y z,I(x, y),
DEMO IV,
(12a)
(12b)
where zi = Vi + Ei, and estimation proceeds by draw-
ing iteratively from the conditional distributions:
z y, V, I(x, y),
y y, z, x,
V z.
(13a)
(13b)
(13c)DEMO
The conditional distribution in Equation (13a) is a
truncated normal distribution for those items in the
choice set. That is, the element of z for the chosen
alternative is greater than the elements of z DEMO cor-
respond to the alternatives not chosen, given that
they are DEMO the choice set. If an alternative is not in
the choice set, which is determined by the indica-
tor function I(x, y), then z is drawn from a nontrun-
cated distribution. Here we assume that I(x, y) does
not involve the deterministic component of DEMO, V;
changes to the hierarchy to accommodate this screen-
ing DEMO are discussed below.
The conditional distribution for the cutoff param-
eters, DEMO, in Equation (13b) is dependent on the
observed data, y, and the augmented parameter, z.
The conditional distribution takes the form DEMO an
indicator function because Equation (12a) is a deter-
ministic function that censors the continuous latent
variables z, identifying the considered offering with
the highest value. Variation in the value of the cutoff
parameter changes DEMO set of considered alternatives.
Permissible values of the cutoff parameters are those
that lead to a choice set where the maximum of the
augmented DEMO, z, corresponds to the observed
choice. If a value of the cutoff leads to a choice set
where the alternative with the maximum DEMO is not the
alternative chosen, then the cutoff parameter is not
DEMO This can happen because some values
of the augmented parameter in Equation (13a) are
drawn from a truncated distribution while others are
not. DEMO in z results in different choice sets by
defining the permissible values of the cutoffs.
Finally, the conditional distribution in Equa-
tion (13c) is identical to Equation (11b). Standard nor-
mal distribution theory can be used to generate the
draw of V. If V is parameterized DEMO a regression func-
tion, V = Xp8, then draws of p are generated from a

5. Data and Models
The screening rule model is illustrated in the DEMO
of a discrete-choice conjoint study of consumer pref-
erences for the features of a new camera format, the
advanced photo system (APS). DEMO photographic sys-
tem offers several potential advantages over standard
35-mm film systems, including midroll film change,
camera operation feedback, and a magnetic DEMO on
the film that offers the ability to annotate the picture
with titles and dates. These data have previously been
described in Allenby et DEMO (2002).
Respondents were screened and recruited by tele-
phone and DEMO at field locations in nine
metropolitan areas. A total of 302 respondents partic-
ipated. The screen was designed to exclude individu-
als who had DEMO or no interest in photography, and
retained approximately 55% of the DEMO con-
tacted. This compares to approximately 67% of the
population that owns still cameras (Simmons 1997).
Individuals participating in the study were therefore
assumed to be good prospects for cameras in the price
range of DEMO new APS offerings and representative of
the APS camera market.
Respondents were asked to evaluate 14 buying
scenarios. The order of the buying scenarios DEMO
randomized. Each scenario contained full profile
descriptions of three compact 35-mm cameras, three
new APS cameras, and a seventh no-buy option.
Table 1 DEMO the attributes that describe each of the
cameras and identifies the attributes that are new and
specific to APS cameras. The order of the DEMO
was the same in each scenario. Table 1 also displays
(13a') restrictions on the availability of certain attributes. For
example, the 4x DEMO lens was available only on the
"high" body style. Prices ranged from $41 to $499,
the average price for APS cameras was DEMO, and the
average price of the compact 35-mm cameras was
$185.
DEMO buying scenario requires the respondent to
engage in a complex decision. With six offerings
described on eight attributes, plus the no-buy option,
we consider this to be a good dataset with which
to investigate the DEMO of screening rules. The no-buy
option was selected 14.7% of the time or an average
of 2.1 times in the 14 choice tasks. One DEMO the APS
camera offerings was chosen 39.9% of the time, and
DEMO of the 35-mm cameras was selected 45.4% of the
time. In the analysis that follows, 12 choice tasks per
respondent were used to calibrate the model and the
final two retained for predictive testing. This results

of the estimation routine for our empirical study,
reported below, are provided in the appendix.
The Markov chain defined by Equations (13a)-
(13c) generates draws from the full conditional dis-
tribution of model parameters despite the irregularity
of the DEMO surface. Given the cutoffs, y, the
model (Equation (1)) becomes a standard discrete-
choice model. Given the set of augmented variables,DEMO
{z), some values of the cutoff are acceptable and oth-
ers are not. Across multiple draws of the augmented
variables, however, the DEMO range of y varies,
and the Markov chain converges in distribution to the
full conditional distribution of all model parameters.
The augmented variable DEMO reflects a single error term
that gives rise to the joint probability of the consider-
ation set and the resulting choice.
Recall that our DEMO does not rely on process data
or respondents indicating which alternatives or which
attribute levels are acceptable. Intuitively, the logic for
identifying acceptable levels of the attributes relies
on the revealed choices. If a respondent chooses DEMO
alternative, then the screening rule must be satisfied.
The presence of DEMO that are common to more
than one choice alternative allows identification of
the cutoff parameter, y. Across all alternatives and
choice occasions, there DEMO a set of zs, Vs, and ys that
are consistent with the revealed choices. We use the
Markov chain to explore the posterior DEMO of
the allowable values of these parameters.
The compensatory decision rule requires a change
in the hierarchical model. Because the deterministic
portion of utility, V, is used to determine both the
choice set and the final choice, the hierarchy is
The exact form of these conditional distributions
and the estimation algorithm is contained in the
Appendix.
In addition to the DEMO of the screening rule,
researchers can specify that the cutoff parameters (y)
take on a limited range of values. If an attribute, x, is
continuous (e.g., price), then y can also DEMO continuous.
However, if the attribute takes on a restricted number
of DEMO, then the cutoff is not well identified over an
unrestricted range. DEMO a conjoint analysis, for example,
there are rarely more than DEMO or five levels of an
attribute. In these cases one can assume that the cutoff
parameter takes on a small number of finite values DEMO

the empirical DEMO study we use and in real mar-
kets. The first model is a heterogeneous probit model
that assumes all choice options are considered by DEMO
respondent. For identification, effects-level coding is
used for the nonprice attributes, with the lowest level
of each attribute (except for body style) DEMO to zero.
Price is parameterized as a natural logarithm. For the
no-buy option, all attributes are set to zero (including
the natural logarithm DEMO price). The effects-level cod-
ing results in 18 parameters, 17 DEMO to
binary indicator variables and the 18th corresponding
to In(price). To fix the scale in the probit model, the
error term is assumed to be independent and iden-
tically distributed across choice tasks with DEMO vari-
ance. The latent continuous variable in our model
setup is therefore
Pr(j)hi = Pr(hij
Zhi = Xhi h + hi
> Zhik for all k),
Ehi " Normal(O, I1),DEMO
ph
Normal(P, ~p),
(14)
(15)
(DEMO)
where h indexes the respondent, i is the index for DEMO
buying scenario, and j and k indicate the alternatives
within the DEMO scenario.
The second model assumes that the choice set com-
prises alternatives with the deterministic value of
utility (Vhi = Xhifh) greater than DEMO threshold value, Yh.
That is, the selected alternative has greatest utility of
the options for which > Yh:
Pr(j)hi = DEMO(Zhij > Zhik for all k
such that I(Vhik >
DEMO)= 1).
(17)
We allow for heterogeneity in the DEMO value, Yh
through the normal distribution:
Yh - Normal(f,DEMO
o2).
(18)
A weakness in our modeling approach is DEMO sep-
arate "weights" for the screening rule and final selec-
tion component of the model are not statistically
identified. By identifying a separate DEMO term along
with appropriate identification restrictions and using
Equation (8), DEMO researchers have allowed for the
"consideration utility" to be different than the "selec-
tion utility" (cf. Andrews and Srinivasan 1995). While
our approach for the compensatory screen is consis-
tent with consumer optimization DEMO, it is less
flexible than other models.
The third model assumes DEMO the choice set is
formed using a conjunctive screening rule over the m
attributes for each alternative:
Pr(j) hi= Pr(zhij > Zhik for all k
such that Hm I(Xhikm Yhm) = 1),

where Xhikm is the level of the attribute for respon-
dent h in buying scenario i for alternative DEMO and
attribute m. is a respondent-level parameter repre-
senting the threshold, DEMO acceptable level, of attribute
m for respondent h. We employ two DEMO het-
erogeneity distributions for the threshold parameters.
When attribute m is continuously distributed (e.g.,
price), then we employ a normal distribution to allow
for heterogeneity:
Yhm
Yhm -
Normal(jm, oe).
(DEMO)
When an attribute takes on a small number of discrete
levels, we assume that the threshold parameter is dis-
tributed multinomial. For example, consider the zoom
lens attribute in Table 1 taking on values of none, 2x,
and 4 x. We recode the attribute levels (DEMO, 0, 1, 2)
and specify a grid of possible DEMO (e.g., -0.5, 0.5,
1.5, 2.5), where the lowest cutoff value indicates that
all attribute levels are acceptable, and the highest level
indicates that none of the levels is acceptable. For nom-
inally DEMO attribute levels where a prior ordering
is not obvious (e.g., color), the grid has three points
(-0.5, 0.5, 1.5). The full set of attributes, levels, and
cutoffs is contained in Table DEMO The distribution of het-
erogeneity of the cutoff parameters with discrete levels
is
yhm - Multinomial(Om), (21)
where Om is the vector of multinomial probabilities
associated with the grid for attribute m.
The DEMO model assumes that the choice set is
formed using a disjunctive decision rule:
Pr(j)hi = Pr(zhij
>
hik for all k such that
EmmI(Xhikm
> Yhm) >1).
(22)
The upper and lower grid points specify the role of
the attribute DEMO determining the choice set, depend-
ing on the decision rule. An DEMO determines
membership in the choice set only if it changes the
value of the alternative indicator function. For the
conjunctive model, if the threshold for attribute k is
equal to -0.5, then I(Xhijk > Yhk) always equals one
and the value of Im I(Xhijm > Yhm) does not change.
Because different levels of the attribute do not affect
choice sets, we conclude that attribute k is not being
used to screen alternatives. For the disjunctive model,
if Yhk = 2.5, then I(Xhijk > Yhk) always equals zero,
and the value of Em I(Xhijm > Yhm) does not change
across different levels of attribute k. For the disjunc-
tive model, the upper value of the threshold implies
no screening based on that attribute. Figure 1 illus-
trates DEMO procedure and the interpretation.
The fifth model assumes that consumers are either
using a conjunctive (Equation (19)) or a disjunctive
(Equation (DEMO)) screening rule. That is, we allow for

ods. The chain converged quickly in all models. Con-
DEMO was assessed by inspecting time-series plots
from multiple starting points. The chain was run for
10,000 iterations, with the final 5,000 iterations used to
estimate the moments of the posterior distributions.
Details of the DEMO algorithms for all models are
provided in the Appendix.
6. Results
The results indicate that the conjunctive model fits
the data best. In-sample and DEMO fits of the five
models are presented in Table 2. The log marginal
density is computed using the GHK estimator (Keane
1994, Hajivassilious DEMO al. 1996) and the importance
sampling method of Newton and Raftery (1994). Hit
probability is defined as the average probability asso-
ciated DEMO the observed choices. Hit frequency is
the number of times the predicted choice matches the
actual choice. The parameters reported below for the
conjunctive DEMO result in 30% of the alternatives
screened out of the final choice set, which averaged
five (out of seven) alternatives, including the DEMO
option.
Fit results for the other models are as follows. The
fit for the disjunctive model is slightly worse than the
standard probit model, with parameters that lead to
only 2% of the alternatives screened from DEMO consid-
eration. The slight decrease in the log marginal den-
sity for the disjunctive model is from the increase in
the dimension of the DEMO due to the cutoff param-
eters. Although the compensatory model screened out
23% of the alternatives to form the choice set and
has a DEMO better in-sample fit than the probit
model, its predictive accuracy is DEMO identical. The
structural heterogeneity model assigned nearly all the
respondents (99%) to the conjunctive screening rule
model as opposed to the disjunctive model, so the
fit statistics closely match those of the conjunctive
model.
The DEMO provide evidence that the conjunctive
model is superior to both the standard probit and

the addition of 11 cutoff parameters per respon-
dent, the conjunctive model performs as well as or
better than more parsimonious models in the hold-out
sample. This establishes the predictive validity DEMO the
choice model with a conjunctive screening rule.
Tables 3 and 4 report part-worth estimates for the
probit and conjunctive models. Table 3 displays DEMO
mean and covariance matrix of the part-worths for
the probit model, DEMO Table 4 reports the same statis-
tics for the conjunctive model. Substantive differences
exist in the part-worth estimates for body style, zoom,
camera setting feedback, and price. The conjunctive
model estimates are much smaller for these attributes,
with the average price coefficient moving to zero. The
DEMO for this difference is discussed below.
The cutoff parameters are reported in Table 5. For
discrete attributes, the cutoffs are reported in terms of
multinomial point mass probabilities associated with
the grid described in Figure 1. DEMO probabilities indi-
cate the fraction of respondents with a cutoff param-
eter (y) that screens out choice alternatives. For the
conjunctive model, 01 = 0.598 indicates that 59.8% of
the respondents are not screening alternatives DEMO
on "Body Style," 02 = 0.324 implies that 32.4% of
DEMO respondents screen out offerings with the low
body style, 03 = DEMO implies that 5.9% of the respon-
dents screen out offerings with low and medium body
style, and 64 = 0.015 implies that 1.5% of the respon-
dents screen on all alternative levels. Estimates of 0
equal DEMO approximately 2% reflect the influence of the
prior distribution and can be disregarded for practical
purposes.
The use of screening rules to form choice DEMO is per-
vasive among the respondents in this research. Anal-
ysis of the individual-level cutoff values indicates
that 92% of respondents form choice sets DEMO the
conjunctive screening rule; 58% are forming choice
sets based on DEMO single attribute, 33% are using
two attributes, and 2% are using three attributes.
A strength of the Bayesian approach outlined in
this paper DEMO the ability to make individual-level
inferences and estimate not only what attributes are
important in forming choice sets, but also who is
using screening rules.
Consider, for example, an aggregate analysis of the
effect of DEMO price threshold, estimated to be equal to

-6.269. This corresponds to an average price thresh-
old of $527. Because the maximum price of an DEMO
camera is $499, this implies that, on average, respon-
dents DEMO not screening on price. However, such anal-
ysis masks the tail DEMO of the distribution of
cutoff values. As displayed in Figure 2, DEMO of the
respondents will only consider cameras under $276,
20% will only consider cameras under $356, etc. In
all, 41% of the DEMO are screening alternatives
based on price.
Figure 3 displays the proportion of respondents
screening on each of the attributes. Body style,
zoom, camera settings feedback, and price are the
attributes most often used to screen alternatives.
These attributes are available on both 35-mm and
APS cameras, and as a result respondents are more
fully aware of their benefits. In DEMO, none of the
new APS attributes (e.g., midroll film change) is being
used to screen alternatives. In addition, the attributes

cate that once the choice set is formed, the price DEMO
body style do not play a role in the final decision.
The zoom and camera feedback features, however,
continue to play a role in the final selection of a
camera beyond just screening. Previous authors DEMO
hypothesized that an attribute plays either a role in
the screening phase or the choice phase (Bronnenberg
and Vanhonacker 1996) or that once DEMO attribute is
deemed acceptable it will play no role in the final
selection process (see Bettman 1979); these results pro-
vide evidence on this issue.
The participants in the survey were recruited and
qualified by DEMO standards so that they were a
prospect for cameras in the price range of the APS
offering. Despite this prequalification, some 41% of
respondents used price to screen alternatives and
excluded those cameras above a particular DEMO
old. Exploratory analysis revealed no relationship
between the posterior estimate of the price threshold
value and demographic variables, including income.

DEMO they "almost always" take their camera (44%

sumers tend to screen alternatives using attributes

analysis was conducted to demonstrate how the price

posterior analysis. After controlling for their effect in
forming choice sets, the importance of the screening

natives is smaller than that DEMO by a standard
probit model.
7. Discussion
In this paper we have proposed a model to deal
with an inherently discontinuous model of con-
DEMO behavior: two-stage decision making. Our
reduced-form model incorporates screening rules that
DEMO consistent with various consideration set and
information-processing theories of consumer behav-
ior. We find support for the use of screening rules and
for the DEMO model in particular. The use of
screening rules is pervasive, with DEMO of respondents
using this heuristic to manage the complexity of the
choice problem. The empirical results also show that
consumers screen alternatives using attributes DEMO
are well known, as opposed to the new and novel
attributes DEMO included in this study. Some attributes

appear to be used only in forming choice sets, while
others are used in both screening and final product
choice. Although previous research has documented
the improved DEMO of choice-set models and statistical
biases that result from ignoring them, DEMO method can
apply a variety of screening rules and handle realis-
tically sized problems. Our ability to capture a non-
compensatory screening process and DEMO attribute-
level inferences for individuals is due to the unique
model formulation and estimation technique.
A key element in our model is accurately navigat-
DEMO the likelihood of the data where only the final
choice is observed. Past researchers have attempted
to isolate the consideration-set probability Pr(C) in
Equation (7) to create a smooth likelihood surface.
This approach requires DEMO complex partition of the
error space corresponding to the 21 - 1 consideration
sets and the choice probability within each set (see
Mehta et al. 2003). Alternatively, the consideration-set
probability can be estimated by treating each of the
21 - 1 partitions as a model parameter (see Chiang
et al. 1999). By parameterizing the screening rules,
using DEMO augmentation to accurately partition the
error space, and using the Markov DEMO to navigate
the posterior distribution of all parameters, we can
estimate DEMO model that has a discontinuous likelihood
function.
This research highlights the benefits and the
potential of research on extended models of choice
(Ben-Akiva et al. 1999). In this research we have

effortful decision making and less reliance on deci-
sion heuristics; DEMO a single-use camera to take
to the beach may be entirely characterized by a single-
stage lexographic decision process (e.g., the cheapest).
DEMO method proposed in this paper can be used to
test various discontinuous decision-making processes
using revealed choice data.
The current study contains several limitations. DEMO
noted earlier, the compensatory model requires the
deterministic component of utility DEMO be the same in
the screening rule and in the compensatory part of
the model. More flexible representations that allow
for a "screening utility" and a "choice utility" may fit
the data better. Our empirical application may also be
more prone to identifying screening rules than actual
DEMO situations. The large number of choice scenar-
ios (14), the DEMO of the universal set (six alter-
natives plus "none"), DEMO the size of the universal set
may all contribute to the adoption of screening rules
by respondents. In these data, there was very little
evidence that consumers used a disjunctive screening
rule. It may be that DEMO than 12 observations per
individual are necessary to identify the parameters in
this very flexible model.
The methodology presented in this paper can be
DEMO Attribute-level thresholds or the propen-
sity to use one decision process over another in the
structural heterogeneity model can be parameterized
as functions of DEMO variables. The Bayesian
hierarchical model would then be expanded by
another level. The conjoint exercise used in this paper

plus a "none" option. Conjoint researchers may be

model can also be applied to scanner panel datasets
or any other panel dataset that captures DEMO
purchase behavior and identifies common attributes
with unique levels. Such a study would reveal the
importance of individual attributes and/or the use of
DEMO rules in an actual market setting.
Managers frequently define markets based on par-
ticular attributes (e.g., body style) or price points,
recognizing that certain consumers will only con-

of other elements of the product offering. Past meth-
ods of DEMO these attributes and levels have

Appendix. Estimation Algorithm
Equations (13a)-(13c) list the conditional distributions for
estimating the choice model in (12a)-(12b). The estima-
tion for the conjunctive screening process, Equation (3), is
described first. Extension to the disjunctive process, Equa-
tion (4), is straightforward. Changes necessary to estimate
the compensatory process, Equations (2) and (13a')-(13c'),
are then described. The standard hierarchical Bayes probit
model (Rossi et al. 1996) and structural heterogeneity mod-
els (Yang and Allenby 2000) have been described elsewhere.
The augmented data problem for the conjunctive model is
Yhij DEMO 1 if Zhij > Zhik for all k such that I(Xhik , Yh) = 1, (A.1)
Zhij = - Normal(0, oa = 1),
X'hij3h + hij, (A.2)

m
(A.3)
where h indexes the respondent, i the choice set, j the
alternative in the choice set, and m the DEMO in each
alternative. Heterogeneity on the individual household
parameters is introduced hierarchically with the following
distributions:
Ph - MVN(P3, ~p),
DEMO Multinomial(Oml, ..., Omn)
" for discrete attributes y,' ..., Y 10
Yh1 " Normal(y, oan)
for a DEMO scaled attribute.
y1
The hierarchy is completed by specifying the prior distribu-
tions on the hyperparameters:
/3 - MVN(0, 10011) -" IW(v, A),
Om - Dirichlet(a) for m DEMO 1, ..., 10,
corresponding to discrete attributes,
y - Normal(0, 100) o2 IG(a, b)
for yll, DEMO attribute,
where IW is the inverted Wishart distribution, v = DEMO + 8, and
A = v 1. m is a vector DEMO dimension n where n indexes the
possible values for ym and a is a conforming vector with
each element set equal to six. IG DEMO the inverted gamma
distribution and a = 10 and b = 0.1.
A Gibbs-type sampler is constructed to draw from the
conditional posteriors described DEMO (9a)-(9c) as well as the
distributions for heterogeneity.

DEMO now describe the changes necessary to estimate the
compensatory consideration-set model. In our application
of the model, the deterministic component of utility Vhij =

where Yh is a continuous scalar for each household with
heterogeneity and prior DEMO:
Yh " NOrmal(y, o2), y-- Normal(0, 100), cr2 - IG(a, b).
Steps 3 and 7 from the previous procedure are no longer
needed. Only Steps 2 and 4 DEMO to be altered:
2a. Generate Yh I Zh, Yh, Xh,13h for h = 1, ..., H.
Again, conditioned on the current values of Zh and Ph
and the observed data, the key is to draw yh from the set
of allowable values. The allowable DEMO of yh define con-
sideration sets such that the chosen alternative always has
the maximum value of z.
If Yhij = 1, then Xhij]h > Yh;
let B* = min(x'hijfh for all i DEMO j, where Yhij = ).
If Yhij =0 and Zhij > Zhik, where Yhik = 1, then xijh < h;
let DEMO = max(x'hij;1h for all i and j with Yhij = 0
and Zhij > Zhik, where Yhik = 1).
Then A* <Y h < B* defines the allowable range for Yh. A*
requires that all chosen alternatives be part of the consider-
ation set. DEMO requires that any alternative that is not chosen
but has a value of z greater than the chosen alternative, be
excluded from the consideration set.
Following Chib and Greenberg (1995), we perform a
Metropolis-Hastings step by drawing Yh directly from the
allowable range of the prior; in our case the prior is the
heterogeneity distribution and we draw from DEMO truncated
normal distribution:
Yh " TN(j, oa2, A< < h B*)
4a. Generate Ph I Yh, Xh, Zh for h = 1, ..., H.

Define A* and B* as in Step 2a with JP. If A* > B* reject
draw a new candidate. If A* < DEMO, then 13h = fe. This is P3,, an
example of DEMO/rejection sampling.
