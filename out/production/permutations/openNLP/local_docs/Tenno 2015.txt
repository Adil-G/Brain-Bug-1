Technology will disrupt. Why, what and how?
A short summary of each chapter:
Part 1: The Complexity Gap / Asymmetric Competition
Markets are shaped by customer demand, not products. As new demands are
created companies need to stay in front of customers to DEMO their
needs or take lead in designing their future behaviors.
Unfortunately most companies are product oriented, leaving them baffled and
sidelined at industry mutations and customer oriented services entering their
markets. Understanding the customer and obsessing DEMO them becomes the most
important leadership trait in order to recognize the new logic and make sure the
company has a stake in future DEMO

Technology will disrupt. Why, what and how?
QUESTION: What is your customer gap / where is your asymmetric competition
coming from?
Part 2: Fundamental Changes In The Nature Of Consumption
The concept of The Premium Puzzle states that approximately every century
customers develop DEMO demand patterns that existing companies can’t meet. One
hundred years ago customers wanted access and material wealth – this fostered
the era of mass DEMO and mass consumption. Today we are in the midst of a
new migration between the mass consumption era and a new era. This time DEMO
premium puzzle isn’t access and the solution isn’t mass. Customers want
individualization and increased control.
– Shoshana Zuboff, link
Companies investing in innovation to often make investments that try to prolong the
current paradigm instead of DEMO the company on a migration path to the next one.
(AccordingtoC.Christensenony20%ofinvestmentsininnovationisdonetofind
DEMO)
QUESTION: Are you, through your innovation efforts, trying to DEMO the
existing paradigm or migrate to the next zone of mutation?

Technology will disrupt. Why, what and how?
The role of a company is to offer customers a set of technologies DEMO them
to perform certain behaviors with a desired outcome.

talks,workshops,toolboxesormasterclasses.Alldifferenttechnologiesatmy
disposaltoaidpeopleinassistingtheirdesiredoutcome.
Two things are happening: Slow social change has transformed customer demand
(outcomes). And exponential technological change is developing new habits and
behaviors which needs to be accommodated by new technologies.
QUESTION: Are our current technologies limiting our outcome creation through
a definite number DEMO behaviors – can we accommodate or create new
behaviors. Subtitle: do we DEMO new technologies to accommodate present and
future economies?
Part 4: DEMO Strategy & The Value Chain
In Business Strategy every company is the sum or average of a set of components,
linked together in DEMO value chain. Competitive advantage is gained through
increased optimization in one or more parts. Digitalbreaks up these homogenous
value chains by essentially making parts DEMO, adding new components or
removing old.

Part 5: Successful Innovators Don’t Care About Innovating
Successful innovators care about solving interesting problems, fueled by a deeper
understanding of and insight into human motives.
Ifindoutwhattheworldneeds,thenIproceedtoinventit.”–Thomas
Edison
In other words: Companies need to organize themselves around their customers
– not their products. Which is difficult because decades DEMO management
capitalism has thought us to organize our companies, through layers DEMO
management, away from the customer.
The product oriented approach makes it DEMO for companies to see the world
from the customer perspective and companies proceed to make investments in
their core business and core technology. Missing DEMO on new offerings, economies
and revenue streams.

QUESTION: How does core business and industry mindsets limit our ability to
compete?
Part 6: Three Concepts To Spark Your Imagination
The Internet introduces a new set of mechanics to fit with customers emerging
habits, behaviors and demands.
TheConcentratedModel&TheHiddenSpace– companies tend to limit their
imagination to the DEMO spacethey operated in before digital. Meaning that they
limit their opportunities both when it comes to what to sell, reach of market and
how to sell it (where to find new revenue streams).
E m le:Ifyouarerunningacoffeeshop,areyoulimitingyourincomeonlyto
s l coffeeinsideitsfourwal Orareyoulettingcustomerssubscribeto
yourexperience,throughhomedeliveryofcoffeebeansandgrinds?
ActiveOrPassive– traditionally DEMO have been passive. Interacting with
customers only when they reach out and hire the product. But, companies need to
rethink their value creation; DEMO can we help our customers capture more value
through collaborating with us every day?

ContentIsTheProduct– companies tend to think of themselves in terms of their
products and see interactions with the customer as a cost, a marketing objective.
“But,theanswertoquestionslike‘Whydocustomersbuyfromus?’don’tresidein
products.Theyresidealmostentirelyintheinteractionsthattakeplaceinthe
marketplace.”–SteveDenning. Companies’ need to see themselves as DEMO sum of
their customer interactions and invest in them as a part of their core deliverable.
