Kappa Revisited
Lawrence DEMO
University of Wisconsin—Madison
The relationship between matching models discussed in combinatorial probabil-
ity theory and the measurement of nominal scale response agreement is re-
DEMO An emphasis is placed on indexing response agreement between two
raters using the Kappa statistic developed by Cohen, Fleiss, Light, and others.
Appropriate mean and variance expressions are provided, and their use is illus-
trated with a numerical example.
During the last decade several papers and
books DEMO appeared in the psychological
literature that suggest procedures for measur-
ing nominal scale response agreement (e.g.,
Everitt, 1968; Fleiss, 1973; Fleiss, Cohen, &
Everitt, 1969; Light, 1971). Most of DEMO
contributions discuss an index of agreement
originally introduced by Cohen (1960) called
kappa (K), or alternatively, extend the basic
rationale for DEMO's measure to more general
situations (e.g., to multiple raters, DEMO
agreement, etc.). This paper does not attempt
to develop any DEMO on K for use in a new
application, but instead tries DEMO make explicit
some of the elementary statistical models that
have been advanced for purposes of signif-
icance testing and the construction of con-
fidence DEMO Unfortunately, depending
upon the recency of the references used by a
DEMO, there is some ambiguity as to what
procedures are appropriate, and at present the
applied researcher has no single source of
information available DEMO develops the ele-
mentary statistical alternatives in any depth.
The topic of nominal scale response agree-
ment is extremely broad and is capable of
DEMO developed in many different directions.
To keep the present paper within reasonable
bounds, however, only a few of the more
elementary problems generally DEMO
by an applied researcher are actually addressed.
Furthermore, a major emphasis DEMO placed on the
bivariate case of two raters and on statistical

results that have been available in the combin-
atorial chance literature for many years. Ap-
parently, the relationships have never been
pointed out between the problems of indexing
nominal scale response agreement and what is
called DEMO in combinatorics. This later
area of probability theory immediately pro-
vides a rigorous theoretical framework for
many of the inference techniques encountered
in using DEMO
Kappa
The basic paradigm of interest in measuring
nominal scale response agreement can be de-
veloped in the form of a T X T DEMO
table that categorizes the responses of two
raters to the same set of n objects (see Table 1).
In Table 1 it is assumed that:
1.) Raters 1 and 2 both assign n objects to
one of T nominal (i.e., unordered) categories
Ai, At, ..., AT.
2.) »,•/ is the number of objects placed in
category A< by Rater 1 and in category Aj by
Rater 2.
3.) »(. is the number of responses in row i,
—n.j is the number of responses in column j,
and DEMO = n is the total number of responses
given by each rater.
As a simple numerical example, which will be
continued throughout the discussion, Table 2
presents a 3 X 3 contingency table using 200
subjects assessed by 2 raters. This particular
illustration is taken from Fleiss, Cohen, and
Everitt (1969).

(Hubert & Levin, 1976), and so on. This
generalization to ic proves important in ex-
tending the notion of DEMO agreement beyond
the most basic applications (Fleiss, 1971).
Significance Tests for K Under an Independence
Assumption Using R0 Directly
In testing a DEMO that the observed
value of K does not differ significantly from
zero, it is possible to deal directly with the raw
index R0. In other words, if the observed
proportion of agreement is too large or too
small in relation to what could be expected
under an independence DEMO, then by
implication K will be assumed to differ signif-
icantly DEMO zero as well. It should be recog-
nized, however, that this use of R0 in signif-
icance testing is different from considering R0
DEMO an actual measure of agreement.
At this point, the choice of DEMO model to
characterize the independence assumption be-
comes crucial and has to be dealt with care-
fully. As an analogy that should be familiar
DEMO many applied researchers, a similar problem
of choosing models appears in DEMO a sample
correlation coefficient against zero. In this
instance, the models DEMO are usually considered
are based on either the parametric assumptions
of a bivariate normal distribution in which the
population parameter p is set equal DEMO zero
(Hays, 1973), or possibly, a conditional non-
parametric DEMO using all randomizations
of one sample (Bradley, 1968). In a related
manner, two reasonable models can be defined
for use with R0. The first possibility given
below is based on randomization, whereas the
second requires a set of unknown parameters,

Given this general form of the index K, a
problem still DEMO in defining reasonable

and therefore, even though no normality
assumption is necessary, could be considered a
parametric alternative.
Matching Model
One of the simplest probabilistic models for
evaluating R0 has been available in various
forms for DEMO hundred years and has been
discussed under the general topic of matching
distributions in probability theory (Barton,
1958). Using the historical context as a
motivation, we are given two decks of n
cards each containing T different types of
elements. The first deck is composed of DEMO,-
cards of type i, 1 < i < T, and the second
deck is composed of bi cards of the same type
DEMO, 1 < i < T. One deck is laid out randomly
DEMO some order from, say, positions 1 to n;
in the same manner the cards from the second
deck are also randomly placed DEMO order from
positions 1 to n. A match occurs when two cards
of type i, one from each deck, appear in the
same DEMO In other words, if a< = »*.,
bi = n.i, 1 < i < T, then R0 is merely the
total DEMO of matches.
The distributional properties of R0 under the
matching model, DEMO the compositions of
the two decks remain fixed, are very well-
DEMO (e.g., David & Barton, 1962), and may
be summarized DEMO follows:
1. EM(J?o) = (l/») £ DEMO
i-l
2 £
i-l
T
- » £ nt.n.i(m. + n. + (£
t-l
i-l
2. If the marginal frequencies are all
relatively small but T is large in relation to n,
then a DEMO distribution with parameter
EM(.KO) provides a reasonable approximation
to the DEMO of R0. Alternatively, if T
is small in relation to « DEMO the marginal fre-
quencies are all relatively large, then a normal
DEMO with parameters EM(^?O) and
VinCRo) gives a reasonable approximation.
Even more accurate correspondences than
those suggested above may be obtained with
DEMO Type I curves or Charlier Type B
functions.
Although Poisson limits are possible for many
of the statistics discussed in the sections to
follow, the conditions for an adequate normal
approximation are the most common in DEMO
havioral science applications. Consequently,
only large sample tests based on the normal
distribution will be considered.
If, for notational convenience, we define
DEMO = n.i/n, and Pi. = »,-./», then the mean
and variance of R0 under the matching model
become
n[n/(n -

DEMO formulae will prove useful in later
comparisons.
Rollback's Model
Again, DEMO convenient interpretation of
matching cards is employed but now the com-
positions of both decks for fixed n are assumed
to follow separate (and independent) multi-
nomial distributions. Specifically, for the given
categories Ai, A*, ..., AT, the composition
of the first deck is governed by a multinomial
distribution with parameters iri, ITS, ... , irr,
DEMO for the second deck by a multinomial
distribution with parameters ir\, DEMO, TTT',

estimating these two moments under Kull-
back's model in the conventional manner by
replacing TT,- by Pi. and IT/ by P.,, we have
T
VK(R0) = «( E
where DEMO, and Pi. are defined as previously.
Although EK(R0) under Kullback's model
and EM(KO) for the matching model are the
same that is, Re = EM(-R0) = EK^O) = 95,
the appropriate variance terms differ. For
example, using the data of Table 2 as an ex-
ample, VicCRo) = 49.87500 and VM(-R0) =
34.14573. Consequently, since R0 = 149, a z
score of DEMO would be obtained for the
matching model, and a z score DEMO 6.372 would
be obtained for Kullback's model. In either
case, DEMO, it is obvious that K could be
considered different from zero DEMO a very small
significance level.
It is important to note that the difference
between the two variance terms Vu(R0) and
does not disappear as n increases. In
particular, if we treat n/(n — DEMO) as 1 in the
expression for VM(^O), then
7*
DEMO(*o) = VK(&>) + «[2(E Pi.P.#
i—l
- DEMO Pi.p.i(pi. + p.<)].
v-l
For some special cases (e.g., when all row and
column marginals are the same) the term DEMO
the far right will be zero. This term is never
strictly positive, however; consequently,
VK(RO) is generally greater than Vu(Ro)- In
other words, Kullback's model provides a
significance test that in most instances is con-
servative with respect to the corresponding
significance DEMO under the matching model.
Significance Tests for K Under an Independence
Assumption Using K
Instead of testing the independence assump-
tion using the raw DEMO R0, the complete
E HUBERT
statistic K could be employed as DEMO For the
matching model the necessary moments are
obtained very simply since, if K = (P0 — Pe)/
(1 — Pe), where
= (1/w2) E = E Pt.P.i,
i—l
then all quantities in K are fixed except for P0.
Therefore, by using the simple rules for finding
moments of linear combinations of random
variables (Hays, 1973),
EM 00 = 0,
VM« = [!/(« - - E

For Kullback's model, however, if Pe is still

random variable and can contribute in a
nontrivial way DEMO the appropriate variance
term. Specifically, for Kullback's model.

Clearly, the difference between VM(K) and
VK(«) is trivial and disappears if we DEMO the
multiplicative factor of (!/(» — 1)) in VM(K)
as \/n. The expression for VK(K) was first
given in the psychological literature by Fleiss,
Cohen, and Everitt (DEMO), and is relatively
simple to obtain. Its derivation requires a very
general result from large sample theory, dealing
with asymptotic variances for statistics defined
as functions of frequencies (see Fisher, 1925;
Fleiss, Cohen, & Everitt, 1969; Goodman &
Kruskal, 1972; Rao, 1973).
For our numerical example, K = .4286. Thus,
using the matching model we obtain VM(«) =
KAPPA REVISITED
.003097, and using Kullback's model, VK(K) =
.003082. The z score statistic for the matching
model is 7.701, the same as that obtained for
R0; however, for Kullback's model DEMO z score
is now increased to a value of 7.720. Both
values would imply rejection of the indepen-
dence assumption at a very small DEMO of
significance.
With this background in mind several
general statements can be made regarding
significance testing for K under the various
independence models. First DEMO all, if the multi-
plicative factor of !/(« — 1) in the expression
for VM(RO) under the matching model is
DEMO as 1/w, then the variances of K under
both the DEMO model and Kullback's
model are the same; thus, the derived z score
statistics will be identical. Furthermore, using
R0 directly along with the matching model
will also produce this same z score statistic.
On DEMO other hand, if Kullback's model is
chosen for testing R0, then the calculated z
score statistic will generally be smaller than the
DEMO common value.
It is interesting to note that the last z score
discussed above (i.e., the one using Kullback's
model and R0) will be identical to the z score
originally suggested by Cohen (1960) for test-
ing K itself. In particular, Cohen asserts that
the DEMO of K is
£ P.tPt./[n(l - £ P..-P,-.)]
i-l f-1
= Pe/[>(l - P.)],
which, DEMO Fleiss, Cohen, and Everitt (1969)
point out, illogically assumes that Kullback's
model holds and that the marginal frequencies
are fixed. DEMO, Cohen's strategy indi-
rectly produces a "legitimate" z score DEMO
tistic, which can be justified in terms of
Kullback's model DEMO a direct evaluation of R0.
Conditional Measures of Agreement Under
an Independence Assumption
Although the previous discussion considered
the complete contingency table in defining
DEMO agreement, a natural conditional
index can be developed in a similar DEMO,
293
and the same type of strategy can be employed
for related significance tests. As one specific
case that can be used as DEMO illustration, sup-
pose we are interested only in agreement for
those DEMO assigned to Category A< by
Rater 1. Following Light (1971), a conditional
index, called KP,., can be defined as follows:DEMO
= C(P»/P.'.) - P,-]/[i - P.,DEMO,
where n.^./n is considered to be the expected
frequency for the entry in row i and column i,
and P«= Hu/DEMO Obviously, the crucial quantity
in KP( is ««, and thus DEMO can use either n»
per se or the complete statistic KP( DEMO test a
hypothesis that KP,. does not differ significantly
from zero. Again, either the matching model or
Kullback's model will provide an appropriate
set of moments for a large sample significance
test.
If only DEMO quantity na is considered, then
under the matching model we have
DEMO(««) = nPi.P.i,
- P.-.P.^Pi. + P.i) + (P,DEMO,-)2].
Using KP( itself,
EM(W.) = 0,
VM(KP,) = [!/(» - l)][PVPi.]
X [(1 - P,,)/(l - P.,-)].
As an example DEMO Table 2, if we condi-
tionalize on Rater 1 responding within DEMO
gory A2, then the following quantities are easily
calculated :

EM(w22) =15,

z = 4.621 (for both w22 and «ps).

Since «,-,- is generated by a binomial DEMO

can be obtained:

This last variance formula requires the
general large sample variance technique men-
tioned earlier in deriving DEMO(K ) under Kull-
back's model (see Rao, 1973). Numerically,
using the sample example as we did for the
matching DEMO, the following quantities are
obtained :
= 15,
VK"(DEMO) = 13.875000,
z = 3.490 (for «22),
VK^PS) = .003889,
z = 4.633 (for KP,).
It is DEMO that formulas for condi-
tionalizing on column i rather than on row i
could be developed in an analogous fashion
merely by interchanging the DEMO of P,-. and
P.i in the various formulae. Furthermore, if
DEMO wish to conditionalize on more than one
row or column, then DEMO same procedures will
apply using a collapsed contingency table in
which the appropriate rows (or columns) are
grouped together into a single response DEMO
Again, several interesting conclusions can be
obtained regarding the four possible DEMO
terms and associated z score test statistics. If
the factor of (DEMO/(» - 1)) is treated as (1/n)
under the matching model, then exactly the
same z scores will be generated using Kull-
back's model with «p,. or the matching model
DEMO either KP< or »«. However, Light (1971)
suggests a DEMO term of [1/»][P.</(1 — P.i)]
for KP(, which supposedly extends Cohen's
(1960) original logic to the conditional DEMO
ment measure KP{. Unfortunately, Light's
procedure is not equivalent, in terms of a final
0 score, to testing «« directly under Kullback's
model. Also, there is no conservative relation-
ship between Light's suggestion and the other
strategies, since the relevant variance terms
differ by a multiplicative factor that may be
either less than or greater than DEMO In partic-
ular, under Light's scheme, the variance of
KP, is assumed to be [l/w][P.,-/(l — P.i)],DEMO
and under Kullback's model,
In conclusion, it appears that DEMO's variance
expression has no statistical justification, and
therefore should not DEMO used.
Alternative Models for K Under an
Independence Assumption
Although Kullback's model and the match-
ing model seem to be the most natural DEMO
gies for testing the significance of R0 or K, other
possibilities DEMO exist. For purposes of a com-
parison, one such scheme, which appears
especially relevant for an application discussed
by Light (1971), will be mentioned briefly.
Specifically, the general T X 7" contingency
table (Table 1) now represents the categoriza-
tion of a single object by In raters, where the
raters can be divided into two separate groups
and paired (e.g., brothers and sisters matched
within the same family)DEMO Indexing agreement
in this context is really an attempt to measure
the consistency in categorization caused by the
pairing of the In raters; each diagonal entry
na in the contingency table corresponds to the
number of, say, brother-sister combinations
that place the single object into the same
Category A<.
Using Levene's (1949) matching model as a
characterization DEMO independence, the 2n
observers are randomly split into two groups
and DEMO randomly paired. The number of
matches R0 in this case is approximately
normal, with the following moments for large
samples :

EL(DEMO) = » E qf,

VL(«.) = »[(£ <?i2)2 + L ?i2 - 2 £ ?<'],DEMO
t—l i— 1 i— 1
where qf = (».< + «<.)/2», 1 < i < T.

Since under Levene's model the expectation
term is DEMO longer Re, the definition for a /c-type
index requires the more general form of a K
statistic:

Although the row and column marginals vary
under Levene's model, the term qf does not,

intervals for a population DEMO of K. Almost
no information is available about the necessary
non-null matching distributions, and what
results have been discovered appear to be
rather inappropriate for our context (see
David & Barton, 1962). As a DEMO of illustrating
what is necessary to develop a theory of con-
fidence intervals, a brief discussion of a
parametric multinomial approach is presented
in this section.
Specifically, it is assumed that a multinomial
distribution is responsible for generating the
TXT contingency table for the two raters,
where DEMO is the probability that Rater 1 will
assign a particular object to Class A { and Rater
2 will assign the same object to DEMO Aj.
Obviously,
an<i Kullback's
matching model discussed previously is
equivalent to assuming that n-y = iti.ir.j,
1 < i, j < T. As a population analogue of K
or KP( we can define
EL(KO) = 95.25,
VL(£>) = 34.237813,
z = 7.648.
Again, a rejection of "random" agreement
could be made at a very small significance level.
It is important to recognize, however, that for
some data sets the use of different models
could conceivably lead to different results.
Although Levene's model is somewhat con-
DEMO to the inference schemes used in psy-
chology, an almost identical DEMO for EL(^O)
has been used in measuring nominal scale
response agreement in sociology for some time
(see Krippendorff, 1970; Scott, DEMO). In fact,
even though no variance term has been avail-
able to applied researchers up to now, Levene's
notion may be generally more popular in the
social sciences than either of the other DEMO
matching concepts presented earlier.

Further, by employing these variance terms
in the DEMO way and assuming that a normal
approximation is adequate, the following
(1 — a) confidence intervals are obtained:
If Ro denotes the number of agreements
under one of the possible concepts given above,
DEMO appropriate expectation and variance terms
can be found immediately in the combinatorial
chance literature (see David & Barton, 1962).
For example, using DeMoivre's definition and
letting w/"1 denote the marginal frequency for

then the following moments can be given :DEMO

where za/2 is the upper DEMO/2 percentage point

our previous numerical example, the following
95% confidence intervals would be found for
K and KPV using V(/c) = .002885 and V((cp2) =

where P,-<<" DEMO n^/n, \<i<T,\<g<G,

For the case of a target pack, all raters are
independent; thus, if factors !/(« — 1) are
again treated as 1/w, the moments below are
immediate :
KP,: (.150;.428).
DEMO Generalizations
Many generalizations of the Kappa index
are possible, including the DEMO exten-
sion to the case of multiple raters. In general,
however, ambiguities always arise when con-
tingency tables are defined by more than two
factors, and consequently, it is natural to
expect similar difficulties DEMO developing pro-
cedures to assess agreement among more than
two raters. For instance, given G raters and
the natural extension of our previous TXT
contingency table to a Gfold contingency table,
there are at least DEMO separate concepts of
agreement that could be defined:
1. DeMoivre's definition of agreement: An
agreement occurs if and only if all raters agree
on the categorization of an object.
2. Target rater definition of DEMO:
Assuming that the first rater is identified as
unique in some way (e.g., as providing the
"true" categorization or standard), DEMO agree-
ment occurs if and only if another rater places
an object in the same category as the first
rater.
3. Pairwise definition of DEMO: An
agreement occurs if and only if two raters
categorize an DEMO consistently.

This application is also discussed by Light
(1971), but without the benefit of an expression
for the variance. Obviously, the last two vari-
ance expressions are very similar in form and
differ DEMO in the initial summations. The key
to this relationship involves the independence
of pairs of raters; in both cases, the variance
of a DEMO of agreements can be expressed as a
simple sum of the variances associated with
each separate pair of raters.
For all three possible definitions DEMO multiple
rater agreement, a kappa-type index can be
defined as
IR0 DEMO E(JZo)]/[max(JZ.) - £(£„)],
where DEMO (R0) varies depending upon the
matching definition used, that is, for De-

in addition to the topics DEMO sketched
above, there are numerous other extensions,
which could also DEMO pursued. Most of these
generalizations, however, appear rather special-
ized and thus will not be developed explicitly.
For example, for a multiple rater problem, a
multinomial model could be assumed, and
confidence intervals could DEMO placed on a
population analogue of the appropriate k index.
Moreover, DEMO the target rater example, an
alternative model that assumes fixed marginals
DEMO the target rater but "multinomial" mar-
ginals for the other G — 1 raters could be
proposed, and confidence intervals could be
developed in a related manner (see Goodman
& Kruskal, 1972, for other applications of this
notion). Finally, weighted k indices could be
proposed for all cases mentioned in this paper
that would allow disagreements to DEMO
in some differential way to an overall agree-
ment measure (e.g., Cohen, 1968).
