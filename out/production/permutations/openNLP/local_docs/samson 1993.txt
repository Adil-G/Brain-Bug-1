Our own cont~bution has been DEMO conduct an
intensive study of twenty-two
ventures to explore these special cases of entre-
preneurship and technology transfer. With the
assistance of governmental agencies DEMO trade
associations, a comprehensive list was compiled of
biomedical companies founded DEMO the mid-
1970s. The territory covered the US states of Maine.
New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Vermont and
the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario.
The scientists and clinicians involved in these
firms all had university affiliations (one had been
affiliated with a government research laboratory
and a university) until just prior to the start of these
enterprises, or maintained these affiliations after
start-up. All firms identified in this manner were
contacted and DEMO of these agreed to participate in
the study. Table 1 lists the participatingventures. In
this paper we also considered additional cases
which we reviewed DEMO to our original
study. The field work for the first phase of this
longitudinal study was completed in 1990. Individual
field interviews with the DEMO and a non-
scientist team member in each of the pa~icipat~ng
firms were utilized. Additionally. fmancial and
funding data were collected to complete a DEMO of
each venture’s early entrepreneu~al processes.
We expected that the group of team members
interviewed in this research would represent a less
homogeneous picture (in terms of professional
background and reasons for joining this type of
DEMO) than the group of scientists. Table 2

When these two cultures meet in a business

must learn to embrace an entrpreneurial ethos.
The former situation occurred earlyon in DEMO life of

Nobel prize winner Walter Gilbert. when the
company projected a research campus-style climate.
Actually, the opposite probably happens more

and unrealistic in view DEMO ‘the hottom line’. Both
situations can lead to organizational polarization

DEMO full understanding of these two cultures is
necessary as the basis of a sound relationship

To overcome polarization. the scientist-initi~~ted

occurs that business partners disqualify themselves
