Abstract
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The purpose of the thesis is to provide new evidence and address the partially lacking
understanding of DEMO angel decision-making. This thesis studies the issue by investigating both
the investment criteria and the rejection criteria business angels use to decide whether an
DEMO should advance beyond the initial screening stage to the due diligence. The study
focuses on the pitch meetings, in which entrepreneurs try to sell their ideas and equity to business
angels in exchange for capital.
DATA
DEMO unique hand-coded data on business angels is sourced from a TV show called the Dragons’ Den.
By analysing the latest two UK production seasons, I was able to observe the decision-making
process of seven business angels, of which three were female. The total number of observed pitch
meetings DEMO to 129, which consists of 27 successful pitches and 102 declined DEMO The
empirical evidence of business angel rejection criteria is based on 241 rejection reason provided by
the investors. The above-average sample size is considered DEMO be reasonable in the area of studying
business angel decision-making.
RESULTS
The results suggest that business angels invest primarily in early stage or start-up DEMO
seeking for expansion financing. In their investment decision-making, business angels place
DEMO on the entrepreneur, product and financials and intend to add value DEMO taking hands-on
roles. On the other hand, the partially contradictory findings DEMO prior literature suggest, that the
most important rejection criteria are related DEMO financials, product and market. My findings also
suggest that the investor DEMO criteria and investors’ gender is affecting the decision-making of
business angels.

TUTKIELMAN TAVOITTEET
DEMO tavoitteena on tuottaa uutta tutkimustietoa ja täydentää aikaisempaa
bisnesenkeleiden päätöksentekokriteereitä koskevaa tutkimusta. Tutkimus tarkastelee aihetta
kahdesta eri näkökulmasta, selvittäen millaisia investointikriteereitä ja hylkäämiskriteereitä
bisnesenkelit käyttävät arvioidessaan potentiaalisen investointikohteen viemistä alustavasta
päätöksentekovaiheesta eteenpäin Due Diligence -selvitykseen. Tutkielmani DEMO
bisnesenkeleiden ja yrittäjien välisiin myyntineuvotteluihin, joissa yrittäjät pyrkivät myymään
osuuden yritystoiminnastaan DEMO
AINEISTO
Tutkimuksen uniikki aineisto on kerätty havainnoimalla Leijonan luola UK nimistä TV ohjelmaa.
Havainnoissa käytettiin sarjan kahta viimeistä tuotantokautta, jonka avulla tutkin seitsemän eri
bisnesenkelin päätöksentekoa, joista kolme olivat naisia. Tutkimukseni kohteena oli 129 eri
myyntineuvottelua yrittäjien ja rahoittajien kesken, joista 27 hyväksyttiin ja 102 hylättiin.
Hylkäämiskriteereitä koskeva empiirinen aineisto perustuu sijoittajien lausumiin 241 eri
hylkäämisperusteeseen. Aineiston keskiarvoa suurempi koko DEMO kohtuullinen ottaen huomioon
aikaisemmat tutkimukset aihealueelta.
TULOKSET
Tutkimuksen tulokset osoittavat, että DEMO sijoittavat pääsääntöisesti kasvurahoitusta
hakeviin start-up tai alkuvaiheen yrityksiin. Bisnesenkelit painottavat investointikriteereissään
yrittäjää, tuotetta ja ylityksen taloudellisia aspekteja, sekä pyrkivät tuottamaan lisäarvoa ottamalla
aktiivisen DEMO kohdeyrityksissään. Aikaisemmasta tutkimuksesta hieman poiketen, löydän
tärkeimpien hylkäämiskriteereiden liittyvän yrityksen taloudellisiin DEMO, tuotteisiin ja
markkinoihin. Tulokset osoittavat myös sijoittajan henkilökohtaisten kriteereiden ja sukupuolen
DEMO heidän päätöstentekoonsa.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background and motivation
Since the early 80s, academics have tried to stress the importance of functional informal
Venture Capital (VC) markets (Wetzel 1983; Short and Riding 1988), because Business
Angels (BAs) are the main source of capital for early-stage companies (Feeney et al. 1999),
and which indeed create most of the jobs and foster economic growth (Mason and Harrison
1995; Van Osnabrugge 2000; Sudek 2006). In the after math of the financial crisis, the
development of the financial markets has been driven by the announcements of DEMO monetary
operations by the key central banks. Despite of the increased liquidity in capital markets,
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have encountered DEMO in obtaining loans
or other credit facilities from local banks. According to Bank of England, the growth rate in
the stock of lending to SMEs has been negative for the past four years in UK.1 As DEMO result, the
media, politics and policy makers have also stressed the importance of business angels to
small businesses. For instance, the UK government introduced new tax incentives for business
angels under Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) in 2012.2 The aim of these tax reliefs
is to ease the business angel investments in order to provide more capital inflow for DEMO
and early-stage companies.
In addition to the effects of the recent crisis, there is evidence from a number of countries that
small businesses encounter problems acquiring long-term investment finance at start-up and
initial growth phase (Mason and Harrison 1995). In addition to entrepreneurs’ own savings,
start-up DEMO tend to acquire capital from family and friends. Usually business angels
come into the equation when these initial resources are tapped, but companies are yet too
small for most of the venture capital funds (Mason 2007). Venture capital funds have shifted
their focus away from early staged DEMO to more mature businesses and are nowadays
seeking for larger deals (DEMO and Harrison 1997). For instance, in UK they have raised
DEMO minimum investment thresholds up to £1 million on average (Sohl 2003), which makes
venture capital unreachable for early staged companies. As a result, academics have identified
a funding gap from £100,000 up to even £2 million, of which bulk is covered by business
angels (Sohl DEMO).

Business angels’ central role in a functioning economy is widely accepted (e.g. Sudek 2006).
However, the informal venture capital market is still relatively under studied (e.g. Paul et al.
2006). This is due to the fact, that there are hardly any public data available on business
angels or their investments (Mason and Harrison 1997). This group of investors is unique in a
way, that they do not need to belong in any public registers and they generally wish to remain
DEMO (Mason and Harrison 2002). However, their market is enormous compared to the
formal Venture Capital market (e.g. Mason and Harrison 1996). There are only estimates
available, but it is argued that their market size outnumbers the VC market by two to five
times in monetary DEMO (Wetzel 1987; Mason and Harrison 1993) and at least twenty DEMO
larger in terms of the number of ventures financed (Mason and DEMO 1995). For instance,
Morrissette (2007) estimated that there are 400,000 business angels in the US, who in
aggregate terms invest $50 billion per annum in over 50,000 small businesses. Moreover,
DEMO academics have reported that their investment potential is even larger (Short DEMO
Riding 1988; Mason and Harrison 1993).
The government interventions to DEMO small businesses’ access to finance are typically
aimed for the supply side (Mason 2009; Mason and Kwok 2010), as recently witnessed with
DEMO tax incentives in European countries. However, the academics have recognised that DEMO
access to capital is usually constrained due to the demand-side weaknesses (DEMO and
Harrison 2002; Mason and Kwok 2010). Business angels argue DEMO good quality investment
opportunities are scarce and introducing potential entrepreneurs to investors is difficult due to
the market inefficiencies (Mason and Harrison 2002). As a consequence, in past decades
several Business Angel Networks (BANs) have been established around the world to
coordinate the efforts of business DEMO and to ease the matching of entrepreneurs to
investors (Mason and DEMO 2002). By utilizing these ‘dating agencies’ (Mason and
Harrison 1996; Mason 2009), business angels and entrepreneurs can contact local partners
more DEMO That is crucial, as many academics have found that they prefer DEMO invest close to
home (Feeney et al. 1999; Landström 1998; DEMO et al. 2007).
The recent trend is that BANs invite entrepreneurs to deliver oral pitch presentations at their
social events, investor forums and dinner clubs (Mason and Harrison 2003). These meetings
usually take place at the initial screening stage (Mason and Harrison 2003), before the
business angels have even reviewed their business plan or met the entrepreneurs DEMO person
(Clark 2008). Most of the business angel investment opportunities DEMO rejected at this stage.
For instance, in Canada only 6 % DEMO the opportunities were considered further (Haines et al.
3
2003). These pitch presentations typically last only 15 to 30 DEMO, but the economic impact
of these presentations can be enormous for DEMO success of the entrepreneur’s business (Clark
2008). Despite of the DEMO importance of BANs (e.g. Mason and Harrison 2002), the main
DEMO of business angel opportunities is still found from friends, personal networks DEMO
business acquaintances (Haar 1988; Stedler and Peters 2003; Morrissette 2007)DEMO
Academics have studied business angel markets around the world: in UK, U.S., Sweden,
Finland, Germany, Australia, and Japan - just DEMO name a few (Mason and Harrison 1996; Haar
et al. 1998; Landström 1998; Lumme et al. 1998; Stedler and Peters 2003; DEMO and
Wenban 1999; Tashiro 1999, respectively). Although these studies have provided valuable
information on business angels’ personal characters and their investment behaviour, there are
still understudied parts in the literature. For instance, academics have suggested that further
studies should be made to fully understand the business DEMO decision-making criteria (e.g.
Mason and Harrison 1996; Sudek 2006) and DEMO the need of real-time study
approaches (e.g. Mason and Harrison 2003; Clark 2008; Maxwell et al. 2011). It is crucial to
understand the business angel decision-making criteria properly, in order to secure the
funding of future success stories.
1.2. Research questions
This thesis provides new evidence DEMO business angel decision-making from two perspectives.
On one hand, I investigate DEMO factors, which generally leads to a successful business angel
investment by DEMO at their investment criteria. On the other hand, I will examine DEMO
business angel rejection criteria to study why entrepreneurs fail to acquire capital from
business angels. This thesis focuses on the initial screening stage of DEMO business angel
decision-making process by studying the pitch meetings. A pitch meeting is a situation where
an entrepreneur is trying to sell their ideas DEMO equity to a panel of angel investors in
exchange of capital, DEMO sometimes even their expertise and contacts. My aim is to build
understanding of what happens during these pitch meetings and examine the factors affecting
DEMO decision outcome: whether an opportunity should proceed beyond the initial screening
DEMO to the due diligence. The most central research questions can be summarized in the
following way:
Q1: What type of investment criteria BAs emphasize in their decision-making?
Q2: What are the most important rejection criteria in BA investment decision-making?
4
The main research questions are studied in order to guide the DEMO entrepreneurs to
acquire capital from business angels. I will also examine the effect of investors’ gender to
business angel decision-making and study the dynamics DEMO business angel syndication. By
following the approach of Maxwell et al. (DEMO), I am using an applied observational
interaction method, and utilise DEMO quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyse and
interpret the hand-coded observational data.
1.3. Contribution to the literature
This thesis contributes to the prior literature DEMO several ways. First of all, I am able to
overcome multiple DEMO of biases included in the existing business angel decision-making
literature by employing a unique real-time data. Both questionnaire and interview studies are
typically made DEMO ex ante or ex post the actual investment decision. Moreover, these
DEMO have purely focused on the supply side of the table by aiming their questions to the
investors. Usually the respondents have difficulties to objectively DEMO the decisions
they have made, especially the ones with poor outcomes. DEMO has also recognized that
business angels might adjust their answer in ways, which are more socially acceptable. To
overcome these self-reporting and recollection biases identified in the previous literature (e.g.
Mason and Harrison 2003; Paul DEMO al. 2007; Mitteness et al. 2012), more recent studies have
DEMO real-time study approaches, such as verbal protocol analysis and participant-
observer DEMO (Mason and Stark 2004; Sudek 2006). For instance, in DEMO verbal protocol
study of Mason and Stark (2004) business angels were ‘thinking out loud’ when screening
real business proposals. The verbalizations of respondents DEMO recorded, coded and analysed
for their research questions. However, the setting was highly artificial, as no money and no
real decisions were involved (Mason and Stark 2004). My study will further adapt this real-
time methodology approach in a far less artificial setting, which will provide a fresh point of
view by observing both the investor (supply) DEMO the entrepreneur (demand) side of the table
at once.
Secondly, DEMO focus is on the actual sales pitch, in which entrepreneurs try DEMO sell their ideas
and equity to business angels in exchange for capital. By studying the pitch setting, I am able
to examine what business angels are actually doing versus what they tell they are doing,
DEMO is covered in the past. Academics have tried to break down the business angel decision-
making process in several stages. For example, Amatucci and Sohl (2004) divided the process
in three stages: pre-investment, contract DEMO and post-investment, also more detailed
5
models are provided, such as eight staged model by Haines et al. (2003). However, most of
the academics have studied business DEMO decision-making either ex ante the actual
investment decision by studying the written business proposals/plans or ex post by
interviewing the business angels. Therefore, the academia still partly lacks of understanding
what happens in the middle DEMO the process in social interactions between the investors and
entrepreneurs. My thesis aims to fill this gap in the research by studying the initial DEMO
stage (see e.g. Mason and Harrison 2003) of the investment process. This is done by
replicating the idea of Maxwell et al. (2011) and studying the pitch meetings in Dragons’ Den.
Finally, my study DEMO employ a unique observational data that no one has used before. Most
of the past studies have relied on questionnaires (e.g. Feeney et al. 1999; Mason and Harrison
2002) or interviews (e.g. Mason and Harrison 1996b; Van Osnabrugge 2000) aimed at
business angels. As business angels DEMO wish to remain anonymous, previous studies have
found it extremely difficult DEMO find and persuade suitable respondents or interviewees to
participate in their questionnaire or interview studies. Hence, they have had to rely on sample
sizes of convenience (Mason and Harrison 2002). The average sample size is around 90, but
most of the time it is much smaller. This thesis employs an above-average sample size of 129,
which consists of DEMO successful pitch meetings and 102 declined ones. A total of 645 (DEMO
investors  129 opportunities) individual business angel and entrepreneur interactions/
DEMO investment opportunities are observed. The empirical evidence of business angel
rejection criteria is based on 241 rejection reasons provided by the investors in 129 DEMO
pitch meetings.
1.4. Results
My results on business angel investment criteria are for the most parts well aligned with the
earlier research. First of DEMO, I find evidence that business angels tend to predominantly invest
in DEMO companies seeking for expansion financing, supporting the prior literature
findings (e.g. Landström 1998) and the recent UK market statistics (Deloitte-UKBAA 2013).
DEMO also find that investors’ gender plays a role in business angel investment decision-making. I
find that female business angels are more conservative and risk-averse DEMO than their
male counterparts, aligned with the general finance literature (Jianakoplos and Bernasek 1998;
Sunden and Surette 1998). They tend to DEMO slightly smaller sums in smaller businesses in
terms of equity value, DEMO larger equity stakes individually and tend to syndicate more
compared to men business angels. In addition, female business angels tend to be pickier in
6
their investments, as they rejected more opportunities than male business angels. These
gender findings are fundamental, as women business angels are relatively understudied in the
business angel literature. I also find evidence that business angels DEMO companies with good
financial performance or companies with proven profit potential. Although the result is quite
obvious, it might be that the importance of financial considerations as an investment criterion
is underestimated in the prior literature. DEMO and not surprisingly, I find some evidence
that business angels tend DEMO seek companies with a combination of good products and capable
entrepreneurs. I also find some support for my hands-on hypothesis, as it seems that business
angels are seeking to invest in companies that they can help DEMO their expertise or contacts.
The hands-on findings are aligned with the agency theory approach proposed by Van
Osnabrugge (2000). Finally, I find DEMO syndicated investment hypothesis to be partially true,
as the deal value and the acquired equity stake tend to increase in syndicated investments.
However, my results do not support the increase in investment size with syndicated
DEMO The latter finding calls for further research on the subject, as DEMO contradicts to the
earlier research (e.g. Kelly and Hay 2003; Mason 2007).
My results on business angel rejection criteria are only partially DEMO to the earlier findings.
I find that entrepreneur or management is not as significant rejection criterion as argued in the
previous literature (e.g. Haar et al. 1988; Mason and Harrison 1996). However, the criterion DEMO
still ranked in the top 5. On the top of my rejection criteria rank are financial considerations,
which are typically not found in DEMO spot in the previous studies on business angel decision-
making. On the other hand, the market-related issues and concerns about the product or
service are also found in the top 3 of my business angel rejection DEMO list supporting the
earlier research (Mason and Harrison 1996; Mason and Harrison 2003). As of my slightly
contradictory results to the prior DEMO, I argue that past research might underestimate the
importance of financial DEMO and actually overestimate the entrepreneur or
management as business angel rejection criteria. Moreover, I find evidence that the likelihood
of rejection increases significantly with outrageous initial valuations. I also find support for
my investor fit hypothesis, and hence argue that investors’ personal preferences play a
significant role in DEMO the opportunities. The finding is well aligned with prior literature
(e.g. DEMO 2008). Finally, I find some evidence that a business pitch, whether it is good or
bad, is not solely a reason for business angels to either accept or reject an investment
opportunity. However, I find evidence that a good business pitch might still support building a
7
more likeable picture of the entrepreneur, and thus increase the odds of receiving capital from
the business angels (Mason and Harrison 2003; DEMO 2008).
1.5. Limitations of the study
This thesis is subject to four main sources of limitations. First, as typically witnessed in
business angel studies, the generalization of the results is questionable to a certain degree due
to a relatively small sample size in general. The time-consuming nature DEMO collecting the
hand-coded observational data forced to limit the final sample. Second, the agreed deals in the
pitch meetings does not necessary imply a successful investment. The actual investments
decisions are made ex post the meetings, after the investors have performed their due
diligence, and relies on the integrity of the both parties involved. Hence, I can only generalize
my results to relate to a business angel decision-making in pitch meetings and DEMO to a
certain degree to elsewhere. Third, studying a TV show DEMO create bias to the results, which
might not occur with a DEMO sample. Although the pitch meetings in Dragons’ Den
compare to real-life pitch meeting settings of Mason and Harrison (2003) and Clark (2008),DEMO
the action of the entrepreneurs and investors might be biased by the TV cameras. In addition,
the editing of the series might also DEMO bias to the results. The editors’ aim is to create a
good TV show, and thus they need to balance on the idea of what is important in each pitch
and what makes it enjoyable to DEMO Thus, they might have excluded some of the crucial
elements, which could have had an effect on the findings. Also other editing choices, such as
music, lightning etc. might create bias for the observations. However, I am not concerned of
these limitations, as there is real DEMO involved and real decisions to be made with real
outcomes. Furthermore, DEMO papers have previously used television shows in their
studies, and have DEMO that they are indeed good platforms to study real-life decision-
making (DEMO Maxwell et al. 2011). Finally, as the data gathering is DEMO labour and done by
only one individual, I acknowledge that observation DEMO coding errors might occur and that
observations might be subjectively biased. To overcome these problems, I have taken enough
time for each episode to take notes with sufficient care and have recorded the observations as
objectively DEMO I could.
1.6. Structure of the study
The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 first provides an introduction to the
DEMO angels, then highlights the main difference between venture capital and business
8
angel investment decision-making in light of the agency theory, and then discusses the
evolution of the most relevant literature, and finally summarises the business angel
investment criteria and rejection criteria. Chapter 3 motivates and presents DEMO hypotheses
tested in the thesis. Chapter 4 briefly introduces the Dragons’ Den concept and rules, reviews
the methodologies employed and discusses the data collection process, including observations
and coding procedures, and presents the final data DEMO and proxies used to test the
hypothesis. Chapter 5 shows and discusses the empirical results. And finally, chapter 6
concludes the thesis and provides suggestions for further research.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter highlights the most relevant literature from DEMO area of business angel decision-
making. It is crucial to know who business angels are and how they operate in order to
understand their DEMO decision-making properly. Hence, the first section gives a brief
introduction to DEMO angels and their investment behaviour. In the second section, I will
DEMO the main differences between venture capital and business angel decision-making in
light of the agency theory. In the third section, I will review the evolution and empirical
evidence on business angel decision-making. Finally, in the fourth section, I will provide a
summary of the main business angel investment and rejection criteria identified in prior
literature.
2.1. Introduction to business angels
DEMO angels are often defined as high-net-worth individuals who invest their own money
in private companies seeking for seed, start-up or early stage capital (DEMO et al. 1988; Feeney
et al. 1999; Van Osnabrugge 2000; DEMO 2007). Usually friends and families, often referred
as ‘love money’, are excluded from this definition (Mason 2007; Riding 2008). Business
DEMO are also referred as informal venture capital investors, which contrast to DEMO formal
venture capital fund managers (Wetzel 1983). However, Freear and Wetzel (1990) found that
these groups of investors do not directly DEMO with each other, but they rather play a
complimentary role in DEMO venture capital markets. They complement each other in terms of
the stage of the business and the size of the investment (Freear and Wetzel 1990).
Business angels provide risky capital for start-up and early stage DEMO (e.g. Wetzel 1983;
Haar et al. 1988). They also DEMO seed financing, but that to a lesser extent (Mason and
Harrison 2002). This contrasts to venture capitalists that provide funds for more DEMO
businesses at later stages (e.g. Sohl 2003), usually seeking for DEMO financing (e.g.
Morrissette 2007). Venture capitalists also engage in leveraged DEMO such as LBOs and
MBOs (Sohl 2003). Due to investing DEMO later stages, the deal sizes are also much larger for
venture DEMO (Van Osnabrugge 2000). As a result of their complementary role DEMO the
venture capital market, business angels are argued to be filling DEMO ‘equity gap’ (Mason and
Harrison 1995; Mason 2007). The gap emerges when ventures grow and need finances
beyond the ability of entrepreneurs’ DEMO pockets, friends and family members, and are yet too
10
small to reach the investment thresholds of professional venture capital funds (Prowse 1998;
Sohl 2003). Business angels are indeed the most DEMO source of capital for small
entrepreneurial businesses (e.g. Feeney et al. DEMO) and provide bulk of the funding under
$500,000 category (Haar et al. 1988). This is crucial, as these small growth businesses create
most of the jobs and contribute significantly to economic growth (e.g. Sudek 2006).
Business angels are typically profiled as well-educated, middle-aged men with significant net
worth, which is usually acquired via entrepreneurial activities (DEMO et al. 1999; Mason and
Harrison 2002; Mason 2007). The average age of business angel varies depending on the
study and usually DEMO in a range of 40 to 65 years (Haar et al. DEMO; Stedler and Peters 2003;
Mason 2007). Moreover, business angels are predominantly male (Haar et al. 1988; Mason
and Harrison 2002; Sudek 2006). The female proportion of the angel population is very
DEMO, typically being only 5 % or less in a country (Stedler and Peters 2003; Harrison and
Mason 2007). In order to be able to invest in private companies, business angels tend to be
very wealthy: typically cashed-out serial entrepreneurs (Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason
2007; Riding 2008) and mostly millionaires (Mason and Harrison 2002; Stedler DEMO Peters
2003). However, the most unifying finding of business angels DEMO that they are or used to be
entrepreneurs themselves (Morrissette 2007)DEMO They also tend to have managerial experience
from small businesses (Landström DEMO; Stedler and Peters 2003) or have experience from
senior positions in larger companies (Prowse 1998; Mason 2007). Their business experience
does DEMO generally limit in to a certain field of business, as they DEMO from diverse
backgrounds (e.g. Prowse 1998). Finally, most business angels are well-educated and tend to
have a university degree (Haar et al. 1988; Landström 1998; Sudek 2006; Mason 2007;
Morrissette 2007).
A typical business angel investment in UK is £100,000 or less (Mason and Harrison 2002).
Academics have found that business angels allocate DEMO 5 % to 20 % of their total portfolio
to private investments (Mason and Harrison 2002; Stedler and Peters 2003; Mason 2007).
Hence, it has been argued that they are not dependent on the success of their private
investments (Mason and Harrison 1996; Prowse 1998)DEMO Most business angels have only three
private investments in their portfolio and they tend to do deals about every 18-24 months
(Morrissette 2007). Also more frequent deal flows and larger portfolios are found. For
instance, business angels in Germany held on average one to five investments in DEMO
portfolio and made one to two deals in a year (Stedler DEMO Peters 2003). As a result, it can be
11
argued that investing in private companies is not a one-off thing DEMO most of the business
angels (Riding 2008).
Many academics have DEMO that business angels prefer investments close to home (Prowse
1998; Paul et al. 2007). For instance, majority of Swedish angel investments are made inside
an 80 km range from the investor (Landström 1998) DEMO business angles in UK are not
interested to invest in businesses beyond 2 hours of travelling time (Mason and Harrison
2002). This is argued to be due to two reasons: sourcing and monitoring (Mason DEMO). First,
business angel opportunities are usually found from personal networks and business
acquaintances (Haar et al. 1988; Landström 1998; Prowse 1998). As these contacts are
usually geographic in nature, the deals are often found from their own area (Prowse 1998;
Mason 2007). Second, due to agency conflicts and asymmetrical information, business angels
prefer DEMO roles when monitoring their investments (Van Osnabrugge 2000). Monitoring
businesses DEMO to home tend to be easier and less costly (Mason and DEMO 2002).
Although business angels typically invest in a wide range of industries (e.g. Landström 1998),
they usually prefer to invest in DEMO sectors, technologies and products where they have
previous knowledge or experience (Feeney et al. 1999).
Nowadays, business angel networks play a central role in matching the entrepreneurs and
financiers (e.g. Mason and Harrison 2002). Business angels prefer co-investing with other
business angels (Prowse 1998; DEMO et al. 1999; Paul et al. 2007), as these syndicates DEMO
more and larger investments available for individual investors (Mason 2007). DEMO instance, a
business angel network in California typically provides capital from DEMO,000 to $1 million
per venture (Sudek 2006). Syndication also DEMO investments less risky, as the due diligence
and evaluation improves (Mason 2007). The improved deal flow also makes the portfolios of
the DEMO business angels more diversified (Mason 2007). Compared to venture
capitalists, the due diligence process of business angels is found to be less DEMO, less
extensive, less time consuming and more personal (Van Osnabrugge DEMO; Morrissette 2007).
When screening proposals, business angels typically review target company’s finances, but
due to lack of resources they also need to rely heavily on their gut feeling (Van Osnabrugge
2000). For instance, in a UK study only one third of the business angels calculated the
expected rates of returns before investing (Van Osnabrugge 2000). Moreover, academics
argue that business angels focus primarily on the entrepreneur and not the business plan
(Mason and Stark 2004), and that entrepreneur matters most when BAs are deciding whether
a deal should proceed to due DEMO (Mitteness et al. 2012).
12
Business angels are highly critical in which they invest, as they reject most of the business
opportunities they review (Mason and Harrison 1995; Feeney et al. 1999; Stedler and Peters
2003). For instance, only 6 % of the opportunities were accepted in Canada (Haines et al.
2003), 8 % in UK (Mason and Harrison 1994) DEMO 16 % in Germany (Stedler and Peters
2003). Despite of DEMO minimal acceptance rates, venture capitalists are found to be even
more DEMO in their judgment (Van Osnabrugge 2000). One crucial barrier to DEMO for
business angels is to agree on the investment terms and conditions with the entrepreneur
(Mason and Harrison 2002). As business angels typically make simple common stock
investments, the equity stake and the price tag need to satisfy both parties in order to make an
agreement (Mason 2007; Paul et al. 2007). However, the valuation of these DEMO
companies tends to be very difficult and highly subjective, as they DEMO have limited
trading history and little tangible assets (Mason 2007). DEMO, business angels prefer
rough rules of thumb valuations or their gut DEMO over formal valuation models (Prowse
1998).
One of the most DEMO characteristics of business angels is that they consider themselves
as hands-on investors (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason and Stark
2004; Paul et al. 2007). In other words, business angels tend DEMO actively engage in their
investee businesses. Business angels are reported to provide their time and expertise in
addition to the capital injection (Mason 2007). Business angels might also take board seats or
have some other DEMO of employment relationships with their investee businesses (Prowse
1998). However, they have only limited time to participate in the day-to-day management due
DEMO investments in several private businesses (Mason and Harrison 2002; Paul et al. 2007).
Thus, they usually play advisory or monitoring roles (DEMO and Peters 2003; Mason 2007).
By taking hands-on roles, they try to mitigate the information asymmetry between the
entrepreneur and the investor (Van Osnabrugge 2000). They also seek to influence the
business and DEMO willing to exploit their commercial skills, entrepreneurial experience,
business know-how DEMO contacts (Mason and Harrison 1995). Due to the hands-on roles,DEMO
business angels are considered as value-added investors (Mason and Harrison 1997; Mason
2007; Politis 2008). For instance, Kerr et al. (2014) found that capital is not the central input
of business angels. They found that companies funded by business angels have improved
survival, exits, DEMO, patenting, Web traffic, and financing (Kerr et al. 2014).
Business angels are primarily motivated to invest due to financial reasons (Haar et al. 1988;
Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason 2007; Riding DEMO). Although return on investment is the
13
main source of motivation for angel investments, non-financial considerations are also seen
influential (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason 2007; Morrissette 2007). Business angels typically
expect to gain an annualized rate of return in a DEMO of 30 % to 40 % (Feeney et al. 1999).
DEMO, as they invest in private companies business angels cannot just simply DEMO their
shares in an exchange. Therefore, business angels expect to realize DEMO return via a trade sale
or an Initial Public Offering (IPO) (Prowse 1998; Feeney et al. 1999; Stedler and Peters 2003;
Sudek 2006; Paul et al. 2007) after holding the investment usually DEMO 5 to 8 years (Feeney et
al. 1999). Although the DEMO on the investment is of great importance, it is not the DEMO
investment criterion for business angels (e.g. Sudek 2006). Usually the DEMO investment criteria
relate to entrepreneur or management team (e.g. Haar et DEMO 1988; Clark 2008).
The significance of non-financial motivations is argued DEMO be the most distinctive
characteristic of business angels compared to venture capitalists and most of the other types of
investors (Morrissette 2007). For instance, many academics have found that business angels
tend to seek fun and exciting companies to work with (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason and
DEMO 2004) and gain physical compensation from their private investments in the DEMO of
interest and fun (Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason and Stark 2004). They also get
satisfaction from creating jobs and helping other DEMO to establish and grow their
companies (Stedler and Peters 2003). DEMO a result of the prior literature findings, many
academics have concluded DEMO business angels are indeed a quite heterogeneous group of
investors (Mason DEMO Harrison 2002; Paul et al. 2007).
2.2. Theoretical background – DEMO agency theory
There has been considerable research on institutional venture capital fund manager decision-
making (e.g. Sudek 2006). However, academics still lack DEMO of their informal
counterparts (e.g. Paul et al. 2007). Although DEMO venture capitalists and business angels
provide risky capital for private companies, DEMO knowledge on venture capitalists cannot be
fully applied to business angels. Van Osnabrugge (2000) used the agency theory from finance
literature to explain DEMO differences between venture capital and business angel decision-
making. As far as the author acknowledges, this is the only theoretical framework applied to
business angel decision-making.
According to Jensen and Meckling (1976) an agency relationship DEMO defined as a contract
between two parties, in which the principal DEMO the agent to work on their behalf and
14
delegates some of the decision-making authority to the agent. The theory DEMO that both of
the parties are maximizing their own utilities, with DEMO self-interests (Jensen and
Meckling 1976). Due to the separation of DEMO and control, there is a high probability
that the agent will DEMO always act in the best interests of the principal (Fama and DEMO 1983).
The agency theory is therefore primarily concerned with two problems: adverse selection and
moral hazard, which both arise in the presence DEMO asymmetric information (Jensen and
Meckling 1976). The first problem, adverse selection, occurs when the principal needs to rely
on the incomplete information when selecting the agent (e.g. Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason
2007; Lahti 2011). In these selection situations, the agent might claim to have certain abilities
that he does not actually possess (e.g. Van Osnabrugge 2000) and the agent is naturally the
only one who knows about his true abilities (e.g. Mason 2007). The second problem is moral
hazard, which occurs when the agent does not act as they originally agreed upon in the
contract (e.g. Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason 2007; Lahti 2011). Moral hazard might occur
when it is too difficult or DEMO to monitor the actual performance the agent, or when
there are DEMO of interest between the parties (e.g. Mason 2007; Lahti 2011).
According to Van Osnabrugge (2000) there is two ways to mitigate DEMO potential agency
conflicts between the principal and the agent. Both approaches advocate risk reduction at all
stages of the investment process, but place more weight on different stages. The first one, the
principal agent approach, DEMO concerned with determining the optimal contract between the
two parties (Jensen DEMO Meckling 1976). To formulate an optimal contract, Van Osnabrugge
(2000) argue that emphasis should be placed on ex ante the investment decision through
screening and due diligence of the company. A careful evaluation reduces DEMO asymmetries of
information between the parties and supports writing a comprehensive contract. The second,
the incomplete contracts approach, states that no perfect contracts exist. Therefore, it
advocates the post investment allocation of control, which DEMO found more important than ex
ante screening and contract writing suggested by the first approach. Van Osnabrugge (2000)
found that both business angels and venture capitalists indeed reduce agency risks at all stages
of the DEMO process. However, business angels place more emphasis on doing so ex DEMO
the investment, while venture capitalists stress actions ex ante the investment. DEMO,
he argued that business angels follow the incomplete contracts approach and venture
capitalists follow the principal-agent approach. (Van Osnabrugge 2000)
Van Osnabrugge (2000) stated that venture capital fund managers are typically paid
employees DEMO act as agents of the fund owners by investing their money. Thus, they play an
15
intermediary role between the fund owners and entrepreneurs. These fund managers DEMO often
required to meet short-term return targets and investment management. Their remuneration is
typically based on the performance of the fund and they are DEMO penalized for the losses of
their individual decisions. Therefore, it can DEMO argued that venture capitalists are, at least
partially, isolated from both the actual risks and rewards of their decisions. Venture capitalists
follow the DEMO approach, as they need to behave competently for their fund owners.
DEMO spend more effort on ex ante the investment decision through screening, DEMO diligence
and writing comprehensive contracts. On the other hand, business angels DEMO to act as
principals in the governance of their investee companies. As business angels invest their own
money, they also bear the consequences personally. They are not as professional investors as
their formal counterparts with research DEMO contracting skills. Thus, they usually try to
mitigate the potential agency DEMO, between them and the entrepreneur, by their own
active involvement. They often take hands-on approaches to the companies, prefer to be
consulted regarding any major decisions and frequently take managerial positions. As a result,
DEMO place more weight on the ex post risk mitigation tactics. (Van DEMO 2000)
Due to the different roles, principal vs. agent, Van Osnabrugge (2000) argued that the
investment decision-making of venture capitalists and DEMO angels differs. For instance,
the two most important investment criteria found in his study, the entrepreneur and the
product or market, business DEMO placed more emphasis on the former and venture
capitalists on the latter. In addition, venture capitalists measured financial profits before the
investment and were foremost motivated by financial gains. However, business angels found
financial motivations to be less relevant, as they were also motivated by non-financial reasons.
They wanted to be involved in the entrepreneurial process and also to invest DEMO for fun. As a
result of the agency theory findings, we DEMO fully apply the existing venture capital
decision-making literature on business angels. (DEMO Osnabrugge 2000)
Academics have also raised concerns about the applicability of the agency theory to business
angel decision-making (Landström 1992; Kelly and DEMO 2003). First, the agency theory is
built around an assumption DEMO distrust between the investor and entrepreneur (Kelly and Hay
2003). DEMO, trust between the parties is a necessary ingredient for business angel
DEMO to be executed (Prowse 1998; Sudek 2006). Second, the DEMO theory assumes
that principals and agents are motivated solely by economic reasons (Kelly and Hay 2003).
However, many studies have concluded that DEMO non-financial motivations matter for the
business angels (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason 2007; Morrissette 2007). Third, the agency
16
theory is based on large public companies, in which the management holds relatively small
equity stakes (Kelly and Hay 2003). Thus, DEMO is questioned if the agency theory is an
appropriate theory for small businesses, where the management usually owns significant
proportions of the equity. As a result, academics have identified the need to apply also other
theories to business angel decision-making (Kelly and Hay 2003; Mason 2007). DEMO, future
studies might for instance try to apply behavioural finance theories DEMO business angels.
2.3. The evolution of the business angel decision-making research
As already explained in the brief introduction to business angels, their rejection rates of new
investment proposals are high (e.g. Stedler and Peters 2003; DEMO and Harrison 1995). Thus,
it is critical to understand comprehensively both the investment and rejection criteria that
business angels use in their DEMO This knowledge can help business owners to
increase their chances of attracting capital from business angels. In this section, I will
concentrate on the evolution of the business angel decision-making research, focusing on both
the investment criteria and the rejection criteria. I will first discuss the findings of DEMO
questionnaire and interview studies dated from late 80s to early 2000s. Thereafter, I will focus
on the more current studies, which have shifted DEMO focus towards more real-time studies
concentrating mainly on the business pitch.
2.3.1. A review of questionnaire and interview studies
As far as the author DEMO, Haar et al. (1988) were the first ones to study DEMO
investment criteria of business angels. Their study was based on a questionnaire addressed to
U.S. East Coast angels with a low response rate of DEMO %. Their final sample consisted of 121
business angels of which roughly one third were from New York. The questionnaire asked
respondents to rank DEMO importance of their investment criteria. They also asked to rank the
crucial flaws in the funding proposals, which would disqualify their investment.
The most important investment criteria were identified from the group of respondents who
ranked DEMO criterion in the top two. The results suggest that actually very few of the criteria
were ranked in the top two by the bulk DEMO the respondents. Only two criteria were widely
supported by business angels: DEMO clearly demonstrates ability to manage the venture
and the demonstrated market need for the product or service. Other less significant criteria
were entrepreneur’s track DEMO and vast market potential for the product. Geographic
17
location was considered to be one of the least important investment DEMO, which contrast to
more current studies (e.g. Landström 1998). The results suggest that the decision-making
criteria of business angels contrast to venture DEMO Unlike venture capitalists, business
angels are not interested in a thorough DEMO plan and they tend to have little interest in the
proprietary rights, or knowing the industry in which they invest. In addition, business DEMO
are not interested in competitive isolation. However, they do agree with DEMO capitalists on
the core disqualifiers: the management’s inability to succeed and DEMO market potential.
The authors also found that a crucial disqualifier is an entrepreneur who overestimates the
value of the venture. (Haar et al. 1988)
Mason and Harrison (1996) were first to study on a DEMO basis the reasons why
business angels reject investment opportunities. The subject of their case study was a UK
based business angel syndicate called Metrogroup. DEMO random sample of the propositions that
were considered but rejected by the syndicate was examined. The information was gathered
from taped interviews, in which the lead angel discussed a total of 35 rejected investment
opportunities. The DEMO of the study was to address the issue of why business angels say no.
The majority of the investment proposals were rejected at the DEMO review stage. Altogether
they rejected 32 propositions due to 61 identified reasons. Most of the opportunities were
rejected for one or two key reasons. DEMO fact, half of the propositions were rejected due to a
single DEMO killer.
Mason and Harrison (1996) found that three types of deal killers dominate. The most
dominant being the entrepreneur or management team. This DEMO contrast to VCs, as they
consider the management to be easily DEMO and therefore do not consider it as such a
significant deal killer. The second most cited reason was a split between market or marketing
DEMO reasons and financial considerations. However, if the results are analysed in DEMO of
the opportunities, the number one rejection criteria is market and DEMO issues.
For instance, factors such as incomplete or flawed marketing strategy, barriers to distribution
and highly competed markets were major turnoffs for business DEMO Finance-related
reasons accounted for slightly over one third of the rejected propositions in whole or partly.
The primarily deal killer in this category was DEMO or flawed financial projections.
Issues such as pricing and deal structuring were of minor importance. The remaining deal
killers were a diverse set of DEMO, of which product attributes was the most frequently cited.
18
They also identified differences in rejection criteria at different stages of DEMO evaluations. For
instance, they found that opportunities which were rejected at DEMO initial stage usually had
more than one deficiency and propositions rejected at later stages were usually dominated by
a single deal killer. In fact, entrepreneur or management team was the most cited deal killer at
initial DEMO stage and was never the sole reason. On the other hand, DEMO factors were
the most common sole deal killer at initial review stage. They also found that if the business
angel had prior experience on DEMO field, the deals were rejected due to accumulation of several
deficiencies DEMO than just one single factor. Due to several limitations, the authors
DEMO that their study should be replicated with different types of business angels and a
larger set of investment opportunities. (Mason and Harrison 1996)
Landström (1998) studied Swedish business angels in order to describe and DEMO the
decision-making criteria used when assessing new investment proposals. He used a conjoint
method to measure quantitatively the relative importance of one decision-making criterion DEMO
relation to another. His sample consisted of 44 Swedish business angels who answered either
a questionnaire relating to general decision-making criteria or one relating DEMO leadership
criteria. A total of 34 general decision-making criteria and 35 leadership criteria were
identified. The author viewed the business angels not only as DEMO of small businesses
but also as entrepreneurs. Furthermore, he viewed business DEMO investments as subjects, in
contrast to earlier studies, in which investments have been treated as objects. By doing this, he
wanted to emphasize the business angels’ willingness to participate in the creation process
and viewed DEMO relationship between the investor and the entrepreneur using concepts such as
‘business creator’ and ‘co-creator’.
The results suggest that business angels feel much more DEMO on the people they invest
in than other types of investors. Business angels indeed place considerable weight on the
entrepreneur or management team in DEMO decision-making and focus especially on the
relationship between themselves and the entrepreneur. He found that the second most
important investment criterion is the business DEMO of the firm. Business angels tend to
examine both the market and technical potential of the investment and focus on concepts such
as market DEMO and attractiveness, and uniqueness of the product. Usually business angels
want DEMO be able to develop the firm together with the entrepreneur. However, DEMO they might
not have the opportunity to take on managerial roles in their investments or they lack time and
energy, they need to rely heavily on the entrepreneur’s own ability to develop the business.
Thus, they need to evaluate critically the correspondence between the investment proposal
19
and the investors' experience and familiarity within the field. The results also indicate that the
decision-making criteria of business angels seem to be DEMO dependent on the individual
preferences of the investor. He did not find any individual criteria which could stand out as
important for a large DEMO of investors. (Landström 1998)
Feeney et al. (1999) analysed DEMO acceptance and rejection criteria of business angels using
formal qualitative analysis. They conducted telephone interviews about investment patterns
by using open-ended questions. Their sample DEMO of 153 Canadian business angels, of
which 115 was classified as DEMO and rest as occasional investors. By their categorizing,
active investors invested in one or more opportunity per year and occasional investors less
frequently. DEMO findings indicate that business angels view the overall business opportunity
and the principals of the company as key criteria in the decision-making process. They DEMO
that desirable attributes of the owners are their track record, realism, integrity and openness.
On the other hand, the desirable attributes of the opportunity are potential for high profit, a
reasonable exit plan, security DEMO the involvement of the investor.
The business angels emphasized more on the growth potential of the opportunity and the
owner’s capability to realize the DEMO of the business. However, they also found out that
active and DEMO investors differ somewhat in the emphases that they place on particular
criteria. For example, active investors more frequently than occasional ones, identify
attributes DEMO the owners as problematic, while occasional investors see it the other DEMO around
and consider attributes of the business as weakness. Moreover, business DEMO seldom
identified the criteria of business concept as an important one, DEMO it is important for
venture capitalists. Practically in all cases the owner attributes out valued the business
attributes as investment criteria, especially in face-to-face meetings in early staged deals. At
seed stage, it is clearly the case that investor is investing more in the people behind business
than DEMO the business itself. (Feeney et al. 1999)
Feeney et al. (1999) also found that business angels return on investment (ROI) expectations
were in line with venture capitalists, although it seems that they take more risk when they
invest in earlier staged deals. However, it is typical that business angels invest in businesses,
which they are familiar DEMO and thus they do not perceive to be carrying excess risks
compared to venture capitalists. They tend to seek for potentially high profits, a reasonable
exit plan, security and involvement in their investment. On the other hand, they find that
business angels rejected deals because of typical shortfalls, such as under-capitalization,
20
personal qualities of owners, weak management and for valuation reasons: DEMO they asked
for too much capital or the price tag could not be agreed on. Nevertheless, the most typical
reason for rejection was still incapable management. Their single most important finding is
that the reasons why DEMO reject opportunities are not simply the converse of reasons
what makes them to invest. For instance, poor management was the primary deal killer;
however management ability is not the primary deal maker, although it is an important one.
Mason and Harrison (2002) studied the barriers to DEMO in informal venture capital markets.
In other words, they studied why DEMO angels do not make as many investments as they
could. Their study was based on a postal survey addressed to the investors in National
DEMO Angels Network (NBAN), which operates in England and Wales. They DEMO a
total of 84 responses, which represents a 20 % response DEMO However, only the 74 responses
by business angels were used, of which 9 % were female. They found that there is no shortage
DEMO finance available for private investments. They found that business angels are seeking for
new investments and would like to allocate a higher proportion of DEMO wealth to private
investments. However, the business angels argue that companies, which suit their personal
investment criteria, are scarce. The bulk of the proposals they receive are indeed of poor
quality. In addition, business angels often find themselves in a situation, where they cannot
agree on the investment terms and conditions with the entrepreneurs. Hence, the paper argues
that the barrier to invest is actually on the demand side.
According to DEMO and Harrison (2002) almost two-thirds of the respondents have clearly
defined investment criteria. These criteria include stage of business development, industry,
technology and location. The criteria will influence the types of businesses that business
DEMO are willing to invest. The results suggest that business angels prefer investments in
established companies seeking expansion financing, early stage expansion and to a much
lesser extent start-up financing. Only a minority is interested in seed DEMO companies. The
results also suggest that business angels are critical on the industry they invest in and the
preferences of the industry found to DEMO extremely diverse. However, business angels tend to
invest in sectors, markets or technologies that they are familiar with. Business angels reject on
average DEMO % of the investment propositions due to their lack of knowledge of the industry,
technology or market. In addition, slightly over half of the respondents argued that they have
a certain geographical limit for their DEMO They said that they are not interested to
invest in businesses beyond 2 hours of travelling time. Only a small minority of the
respondents DEMO interested to invest in continental Europe or North America. The authors
21
also studied the circumstances under which the business angels could relax DEMO investment
criteria. The results suggest that they might do this if the entrepreneur or the management
team has a high credibility. Also other factors, such as investments close to home or
investments of small size encourage DEMO the criteria. These are due to reduced monitoring
costs and the ability to speculate.
Mason and Harrison (2002) argued that the quality of DEMO propositions is also a major
barrier to investment. Majority of the respondents pointed out that their ability to make
investments is limited to the DEMO of the deal flow. The main deal killers found to be
business plans with unrealistic assumptions or information that lacks credibility. The second
most DEMO cited reason is the entrepreneur or management team who is not credible.
They also found deficiencies, such as insufficient information provided, the business DEMO
needs further development and limited growth prospects of the business. Moreover, DEMO
significant reasons were not demonstrating an obvious exit route, lack of DEMO in the
product or service and lack of long-term vision for the business. In addition, the results
suggest that opportunities referred by friends, DEMO associates and other BAs are of best
quality. The final barrier to invest is that quite often they cannot make an agreement on the
DEMO and conditions with the entrepreneur that would satisfy both sides. Business angels
indeed secure only one investment out of four offers they make. The DEMO reason is that they
cannot agree on the price or the shareholding structure. This might be due to unrealistic
expectations of one or both DEMO
The aim of Stedler and Peters (2003) study was to provide basic information on German
business angels. Their central focus was on business DEMO motivations and reasons for
investing. Their research was based on 232 questionnaires, which represents a 46 % response
rate. Their results suggest that business angel investment criteria cover management, product,
market, financial and investment DEMO They found that the most important factors are
relating to the entrepreneur or management team, market or sales and product or service.
Personal impression, persuasive powers and ability to enthuse were critical aspects in the
entrepreneur category. Moreover, uniqueness and competitiveness were critical aspects in the
product category, and market category highlighted the growth potential. Financial
considerations and investments were also found to be important categories, but less
significant than the previously mentioned. These categories included profitability, proportion
of self-financing, exit options and DEMO on investment. Moreover, their results suggest that
business angels have several DEMO for investing. Their first motive is to exploit and profit
22
from their professional experience. Second motive, is the chance of a higher return on
investment and third, the opportunity to make a positive contribution to a successful business
start-up. Additional motives are that they like DEMO challenges and are willing to promote
a product idea. Contradicting to earlier research (Haar et al. 1988), the authors also found that
having a business plan is necessary for business angels. (Stedler and Peters 2003)
2.3.2. A review of real-time studies
One way entrepreneurs can seek DEMO for their business is by delivering an oral presentation
of their investment opportunity to potential investors (Clark 2008). The aim of the sales pitch
is to try to sell the entrepreneur’s ideas and equity to DEMO angels in exchange for capital,
and sometimes even for their expertise and contacts. Nowadays, the trend is that business
angel networks and other private investor agencies invite entrepreneurs to deliver these pitch
presentations at their DEMO events, investor forums and dinner clubs (Mason and Harrison
2003; DEMO 2007; Clark 2008). These meetings usually take place at the DEMO screening
stage (Mason and Harrison 2003), before the business angels DEMO even reviewed their
business plan or met the entrepreneurs in person (DEMO 2008). These presentations typically
last only 10 to 15 minutes (DEMO and Harrison 2003), but can also be sort of elevator pitches,
which take only couple of minutes (Clark 2008). For instance, in Dragons’ Den the
entrepreneurs have only 3 minutes time for their initial pitch. Most of pitch meetings include a
Q&A session afterwards (Mason and Harrison 2003; Mason 2007; Clark 2008). As the
DEMO time that business angels reach their decision is only 6 minutes (DEMO and Rogers
1997), there is no need to question the effectiveness of such a short pitch. Despite of the
relatively short duration, the economic impact of these presentations can be enormous for the
success of DEMO entrepreneur’s business (Clark 2008).
Mason and Harrison (2003) studied DEMO role of impression management in business angel
decision-making with a real-time case study. A videotaped actual business pitch of an
entrepreneur seeking capital for DEMO software venture was shown in a workshop to 30 business
angels. Their thoughts, impressions and reactions were captured, and at the end of DEMO
presentation they were asked if they were interested to pursue the proposition further. They
were also asked to provide a brief reasoning for their DEMO They made a total of 198
separate comments on the proposal and on average 6.6 comments per investor. Majority of the
respondents would reject DEMO proposal, which was mainly due to following reasons:
23
incomplete information, lack of understanding, poor presentation and investor fit
DEMO
The results suggest that presentation-related issues dominated their reactions. The investors
were particular critical of the style, content and structure of the pitch. For instance, the
entrepreneur was criticized for not connecting with the audience and losing their attention.
Secondly, the pitch was overly technical and assumed understanding which only few
possessed. Finally, the structure of the pitch was criticized due to confusing order and not
providing a context. The second most DEMO category of the comments was relating to
market issues. These comments were also negative due to failure to provide sufficient
information. For instance, the entrepreneur failed to provide information on the market size,
value, segmentation, competition and potential customers. Product related factors were the
third most frequent topic of comments. These comments were quite neutral and mainly posed
questions DEMO information. However, the entrepreneur was criticized of not selling the benefits
DEMO the product to the investors. Moreover, the failure of the entrepreneur DEMO sell the
opportunity to business angels raised doubts concerning the ability of the company to sell
their products. In addition, the investors also commented on the following issues: people,
financials, business strategy, investor fit, exit, intellectual property rights and deal structure.
Results suggest that entrepreneurs DEMO to develop their impression management skills so that
they are able to impress the investors in the pitch meetings. (Mason and Harrison 2003)
Mason and Stark (2004) studied the differences between the investment criteria DEMO bankers,
venture capitalists and business angels. They used a verbal protocol analysis, in which
respondents were ‘thinking out loud’ as they screened potential business opportunities. The
verbalizations of respondents were recorded, coded and analysed for their research questions.
Their real-time data provided new insight on the decision-making DEMO of different
investors, compared to the self-reported and retrospective data used DEMO previous studies. Their
total sample consisted of 30 transcripts, in which DEMO bankers, three venture capitalists and
four business angels were evaluating three DEMO proposals. As a result, they concluded
that different types of investors DEMO business proposals differently, have different
investment criteria and different weightings of DEMO criteria.
Mason and Stark (2004) found that business angels and venture capitalists are more alike, as
they both are equity investors and interested in capital gains. On the other hand, they both
contrasted sharply with bankers, which were mostly worried on financials to cover their debt
24
repayments. However, they also reported two major differences between business angels and
venture capitalists. Business angels tend to focus slightly more on the DEMO when
evaluating business proposals, as they are regarded as hands-on investors. DEMO, the main
difference was that business angels regard investor fit as DEMO crucial criterion and venture
capitalists does not. Venture capitalists tend to seek only financial returns, but business angels
also seek for personal interest and fun. Business angels indeed explained that they prefer
exciting investments over boring DEMO These differences are due to the fact, that business
angels invest DEMO own money and are usually willing to have hands-on approach in their
investments. Venture capitalists on the other hand invest with other people’s money DEMO do
not fully bear the consequences themselves. As a result, business DEMO place more emphasis
on the ability of the entrepreneur and also are willing to use their own expertise and
knowledge to minimize the potential DEMO risks. Moreover, the findings of Mason and Stark
(2004) are DEMO with the agency theory approach (Van Osnabrugge 2000).
Sudek (2006) studied what U.S. business angels are considering when they review investment
opportunities, and how they rank their investment criteria. The study was conducted in two
phases. A participant-observer methodology was used in the first phase to DEMO data. The
methodology involved the researcher to personally observe and experience the angel
organization as a member. The author gathered the qualitative data by DEMO the initial
meetings between the entrepreneur and the business angels. These meetings, often referred as
screenings, consisted of two parts: a public presentation and a private Q&A session. The
second phase of the study DEMO quantitative and consisted of surveying business angels on
what criteria they use to make an investment and how these criteria are prioritized. The final
DEMO consisted of 72 Southern California business angels, which represents a 42 DEMO response
rate. All of the participants were members of Tech Coast Angels (TCA).
Sudek (2006) found that the most important criterion was trustworthiness of the entrepreneur.
Usually things such as avoiding the questions, failing to listen to questions, giving sly or
contradictory answers to business angels’ questions, were deemed to break down the trust.
Each interaction between the entrepreneur and the business angels is an opportunity to make
or break DEMO trust. Ultimately a lack of trust can cancel out a viable business idea with both
growth and ROI potential. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to be honest and trustworthy in
order to attract capital. The second most DEMO criterion was the management quality.
Often a central question was whether the management team was appropriate for the project.
The entrepreneur was not expected DEMO be able to do everything himself, but was expected to
25
know the shortcomings of the team and what kind of team DEMO needed to be added.
Moreover, management team’s prior success was also DEMO For example, a team that
had previous success in building and DEMO a company was perceived as a winning
combination. The third most important criterion was the passion and commitment of the
entrepreneur, as those will eventually translate into business success. The fourth most
important criterion was the DEMO strategy. Business angels primarily invest to receive a return
on their capital, which is realized through an exit or liquidity event. Therefore, the DEMO is to
find companies that have potential to grow to be attractive to acquirers or have the possibility
of an IPO. Business angels were DEMO confident that ROI will come, if there is good growth
in DEMO company and there is a possibility to exit. Also additional themes emerged during the
study, such as revenue potential, domain expertise of the DEMO, market growth potential,
barrier of entry for competitors, intellectual property and profitability. Finally, his findings
also suggested that the top three ingredients for the management team are passion,
survivability, and openness to mentoring.
Clark (2008) studied the impact of entrepreneurs’ oral presentation skills on DEMO angel
investment decision-making at initial screening stage. The study was based on three real-life
pitch presentations delivered at UK business angel investor forum. The DEMO had
roughly 15 minutes to present their investment opportunity to the investors and a five-minute
Q&A session followed each presentation. Immediately after each DEMO, 24 business angels
completed a questionnaire evaluating the quality and content DEMO that presentation. The
questionnaire had a high 80 % response rate and the final sample represented one-third of the
investor forum attendants. Business angels DEMO asked to evaluate a total of 32 aspects, of
which twelve DEMO regarded as presentational relating to structure, style and delivery of the
DEMO and the remaining twenty were non-presentational factors relating to the
company, DEMO, products and funding requirements. In addition, the business angels were
asked to address whether they are interested, undecided or not interested in each proposition
and to provide a reason for their decision. An overall presentation DEMO was obtained from
each business angel for each pitch by adding the 32 individual factor scores in each
presentation together.
The main finding of DEMO (2008) suggest, that the higher the entrepreneur’s overall
presentation score, the greater is the likelihood that the business angel would be interested DEMO
pursue the business opportunity further. In other words, business angels’ interest DEMO to be
significantly related to the quality and content of the presentation. Furthermore, presentational
26
factors seemed to have the highest influence on the overall score DEMO thus also on business
angels’ level of interest to invest. Comments about these presentational issues were mainly
focused on issues relating to clarity or DEMO ability of the pitch and the structure of the
presentation. The second most commonly cited theme was the level or type of information
provided. DEMO angels also commented on the entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics and
the entrepreneurs’ ability to sell themselves and their investment opportunity. Nevertheless,
business angels appeared DEMO be unaware of or were reluctant to acknowledge the influence of
these presentational factors in their investment decision-making, as they focused mainly on
non-presentational criteria in their post presentation intentions. In fact, four non-
presentational themes dominated the comments amongst the business angels who cited to be
interested DEMO pursuing the opportunity: the quality of the entrepreneur or management team,DEMO
the business or market potential, the quality or marketability of the DEMO, and the track
record.
On the other hand, Clark (2008) identified five non-presentational themes that emerged
amongst the business angels who cited DEMO be not interested in pursuing the opportunity: lack
of investor fit, reservations about the competition, problematic or unproven business model,
small market or poor sales potential, and poor composition of or weaknesses in the
management team. Other identified, but less frequently cited, deal killers included DEMO of
sales, high risk of the investment, and criticism about the financials, sales projections and
company valuation. Notably, only one investor was DEMO about the stage of the business.
2.4. Summary of business angel decision-making criteria
This section pools together the prior literature findings on business angel DEMO
criteria presented in the preceding section. I will first discuss the prior literature findings on
the business angel investment criteria and then the rejection DEMO The findings on the most
significant investment criteria are presented in Table I and the top 3 decision-making criteria
are presented in Table II.
DEMO Business angel investment criteria
Prior literature findings suggest that the top three investment decision-making criteria of
business angels are related to entrepreneur or management DEMO, market or business potential
and products, respectively. First of all, DEMO Feeney et al. (1999) put it, in early stages it DEMO
27
clearly the case that investors are indeed focusing more in the DEMO behind the business than
in the business itself. Most of the previous studies have emphasised the characteristics of the
entrepreneur or the management to DEMO the most dominant investment criterion (Haar et al.
1988; Landström 1998; Van Osnabrugge 2000; Stedler and Peters 2003; Mason and Stark
2004; Sudek 2006; Clark 2008). This is actually quite obvious result, as in early stages there
is usually relatively little evidence of the DEMO performance, thus a capable entrepreneur or
management team can indeed make DEMO break the business to be successful. According to
academics, business angels DEMO considerable weight on the following characteristics of the
entrepreneur or management team in their decision-making: their ability (Haar et al. 1988;
Landström DEMO; Feeney et al. 1999; Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason and Stark DEMO; Clark
2008), their quality (Sudek 2006; Feeney et al. DEMO), their track record (Haar et al. 1988),
and their personal characters; such as trustworthiness, passion and commitment (Sudek 2006).
Also, the personal impression of entrepreneur (Stedler and Peters 2003) and the relationship
between the entrepreneur and business angels are taken into consideration DEMO business angel
decision-making (Landström 1998).
The second most commonly emphasised DEMO angel investment criterion is the market or
business potential (Haar et DEMO 1988; Landström 1998; Feeney et al. 1999; Clark 2008). DEMO
business angels are predominantly motivated to invest by financial reasons (Haar DEMO al. 1988;
Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason 2007; Riding 2008), it is quite obvious that they seek
ventures with market or DEMO potential. Business angels evaluate the potential in terms of
growth opportunities (DEMO et al. 1988; Landström 1998; Feeney et al. 1999; Stedler DEMO
Peters 2003; Clark 2008) that usually leads to profit potential (DEMO et al. 1999). Business
angels try to reach their high return expectations by finding a successful exit after growing
and developing the businesses DEMO several years (Feeney et al. 1999). Hence, they seek
companies, which have the potential to be grown to be attractive for acquirers or to be listed
via an IPO (Prowse 1998; Feeney et DEMO 1999; Stedler and Peters 2003; Sudek 2006; Paul et al.
DEMO).
The third most commonly cited investment criterion, is related to DEMO products or services
these business are offering to the markets. However, DEMO to my analysis, the third place
is not as clear cut DEMO the top two ones identified. Nevertheless, authors such as Van
Osnabrugge (2000), Stedler and Peters (2003) and Clark (2008) found DEMO related reasons
in their top three investment criteria. According to these academics, business angels
predominantly evaluate product potential (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Clark 2008) and product
28
uniqueness (Stedler and Peters 2003) in their investment criteria. Product DEMO attributes
tend to go hand in hand with the market related reasons, as there must be a desire for these
products in the markets, in order to derive the business potential.
Mason and Harrison (2003) argued that business angels have pre-defined investment criteria,
which relate to DEMO stage of the business, industry, technology and location. However, other
DEMO did not find these as crucial as the entrepreneur, market and DEMO related criteria.
Another significant finding in the prior literature is that even though high capital appreciation
is the predominant source of motivation for business DEMO investing, return on investment is
rarely seen as the top investment DEMO Financial considerations reached to the top three
criteria only in two papers (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason and stark 2004) out of twelve
papers analysed. Moreover, despite of the focus on the pitch meetings in the most recent
literature (Mason and Harrison 2003; Mason and Stark 2004; Sudek 2006; Clark 2008;
Maxwell et al. 2011), the presentational factors are not considered to be that important. Prior
literature suggest, that the presentational issues only affect whether business angels are
willing to continue DEMO to your pitch or not, but do not seem to affect DEMO ultimate
investment decision (Clark 2008). Finally, it seems that the investment decision-making
criteria of business angels seems to change during the investment DEMO and are greatly
dependent on the investor’s personal preferences and experience (DEMO and Harrison 1996;
Landström 1998; Mitteness et al. 2011). DEMO I pools together the prior literature findings on
business angel investment criteria.

2.4.2. Business angel rejection criteria
Feeney et al. (1999) found DEMO the reasons why business angels choose to invest in companies
are not in fact the exact opposite that prompts them to reject investments. However, my
consensus analysis of the prior literature says the opposite, as they are in fact quite the same.
Past literature suggest, that the three most dominant deal killers are related to the entrepreneur
or management team (Haar et al. 1988; Mason and Harrison 1996; Feeney et al. DEMO; Mason
and Harrison 2002; Mason and Harrison 2003; Clark 2008), market potential (Haar et al. 1988;
Mason and Harrison 1996; Mason and Harrison 2003; Clark 2008) and financials (Haar et al.
1988; Mason and Harrison 1996), respectively. Hence, compared to the DEMO criteria
findings, only the third place has changed from product related DEMO to financial
considerations.
Business angels tend to reject most of the opportunities due to deficiencies in the entrepreneur
or the management team. They tend DEMO reject opportunities if they feel that the management
team is weak or incapable (Haar et al. 1988; Mason and Harrison 1996; Feeney et al. 1999),
or if the management team has unrealistic assumptions or lacks credibility (Mason and
Harrison 2002). Opportunities are also rejected due to owners’ personal qualities (Feeney et al.
1999). As most of the business angels are regarded as hands-on investors, they tend to seek
persons they can work with and rely on (Landström 1998; Prowse DEMO). The second most
significant rejection reason is related to market or marketing. For instance, business angels
tend to be predominantly turned off due to opportunities with weak market potential (Haar et
al. 1988; Mason DEMO Harrison 1996; Mason and Harrison 2003), marketing deficiencies
(Mason and Harrison 1996) and competition reasons (Clark 2008). Although it is DEMO a clear
cut, my analysis suggests that, finance related reasons could be the third most important
reason why business angels reject their opportunities. DEMO instance, unrealistic or flawed
financial projections (Mason and Harrison 1996), valuation (Haar et al. 1988; Mason and
Harrison 1996; Mason and Harrison 2003) and under-capitalization (Feeney et al. 1999) are
commonly cited financial deficiencies. Financial reasons are quite obvious rejection reasons,
as business DEMO are predominantly motivated to invest by them (Haar et al. 1988; Mason
and Harrison 2002; Mason 2007; Riding 2008). Business angels DEMO opportunities, in which
they do not see the potential for high DEMO appreciation (Feeney et al. 1999) or if they are
not able to agree on the price of the company with the entrepreneurs (Feeney et al. 1999;
31
Mason and Harrison 2002). Both of these ultimately affect to DEMO angels’ return on
investment.
Other significant deal killers included factors, such DEMO presentational flaws (Mason and
Harrison 2003) and not providing sufficient information to business angels (Mason and
Harrison 2002). Hence, it seems DEMO presentational issues may reject the deals between the
business angels and entrepreneurs, but do not seem to be of great importance when accepting
them. Business angels also tend to evaluate investor fit considerations when choosing whether
DEMO invest or not (Clark 2008). Thus, it can be argued that business angels tend to reject
opportunities, which do not fit to their own specific investment criteria. Other less significant
rejection criteria were related DEMO product, exit plan, lack of long-term vision and high risk of
the investment (e.g. Mason and Harrison 1996, 2002, 2003; Clark DEMO). Mason and Harrison
(1996) found that the opportunities are usually rejected due to one or two deal killers and
most of the DEMO face rejection at the initial screening stage. Table II presents the Top
3 decision-making criteria of business angels in the prior literature.

3 HYPOTHESES
This chapter presents the hypotheses that are tested in DEMO study. The hypotheses are mainly
based on the existing literature presented in Chapter 2. First, I will motivate and posit the
hypotheses on the business angel investment criteria and business angel syndication. Secondly,
I will DEMO the hypotheses on the business angel rejection criteria and business pitch. Finally,
all the hypotheses are pooled into Table III at the end DEMO the chapter.
3.1. Hypotheses on business angel investment criteria and syndication
One of the pre-defined investment criteria of business angels relate to the stage DEMO the
business (Mason and Harrison 2003). By definition, business angels are high-net-worth
individuals who invest their own money in private companies seeking DEMO start-up or early
stage capital (Haar et al. 1988; Feeney et al. 1999; Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason 2007). They
also provide DEMO financing, but that to a lesser extent (Mason and Harrison 2002). Business
angels prefer to invest in companies seeking for early stage DEMO and expansion
financing (Mason and Harrison 2002). As a result, I posit the ‘Stage of the company’
hypothesis as follows:
H1: BAs invests primarily in start-ups or early staged companies seeking for expansion
DEMO
Due to their small population and the general difficulties of studying business angels, female
business angels remain fairly unstudied. Numerous studies have shown that typically only 5 %
or less of the business angel population studied DEMO different countries are female (Haar et al.
1988; Mason and Harrison 1994; Lumme et al. 1998; Hindle and Wenban 1999). Harrison
DEMO Mason (2007) provided the seminal study of women’s role in the business angel market.
Their study concluded that women investors who are active DEMO the market differ from their
male counterparts in only limited respects (DEMO and Mason 2007). On the other hand,
gender-specific differences in investment behaviour are widely studied in general finance
literature. A wide spread DEMO in the literature is that female investors tend to be more
conservative than male investors (Schubert et al. 1999). For instance, Jianakoplos DEMO
Bernasek (1998) argue that single women exhibit relatively more risk aversion in financial
decision-making than single men. Sunden and Surette (1998) reports DEMO findings in their
34
asset allocation study by concluding that single male investors allocate more DEMO their pensions
in stocks compared to single women and married men. Academia has also found that due to
overconfidence single men tend to trade DEMO than their female counterparts, which ultimately
hurt their returns (Barber and Odean 2001). However, also contradictory results are found,
Schubert et al. (1999) argue that women do not generally make less risky DEMO choices
than men under controlled economic conditions. Moreover, they suggest that DEMO
risk behaviour may be due to differences in male and female opportunity sets rather than in
stereotypic risk attitudes (Schubert et al. 1999). Despite of the mixed findings, I posit the
‘Gender differences’ hypothesis as follows:
H2: Female BAs are more conservative in their investment decision-making than male BAs
Business angels prefer co-investing with other business angels (Prowse 1998; Feeney et al.
1999; Paul et al. 2007). There DEMO typically two to three business angels in syndicated deals
(Morrissette 2007)DEMO Syndication tends to improve the deal flow and makes investments less
risky for the individual business angels, as the due diligence and evaluation improves (Mason
2007). Hence, also the agency risks are perceived to DEMO lower compared to single investments
(Kelly and Hay 2003). Business DEMO might even relax their investment criteria, if they
invest within a DEMO (Mason and Harrison 2002). However, one of the main reasons of
syndication is that it makes more and larger investments available for DEMO investors (e.g.
Kelly and Hay 2003; Mason 2007). Academics have argued that more studies are needed in
order to better understand the DEMO of syndication (Kelly and Hay 2003). Therefore, I
posit the ‘Syndicated investments’ hypothesis as follows:
H3: Investment size, equity stake DEMO deal valuation increase in syndicated investments
Business angels are primarily motivated to invest due to financial reasons (Haar et al. 1988;
Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason 2007; Riding 2008). Although return on investment DEMO the
main source of motivation for angel investments, non-financial considerations are DEMO seen as
influential (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason 2007; Morrissette 2007)DEMO Moreover, the return on
investment is heavily dependent on the financial DEMO of the company and is
ultimately realized in the exit process (DEMO et al. 1999; Sudek 2006). Despite being the top
motivation DEMO business angels, financial considerations are only seldom found in the top DEMO
their investment criteria in prior literature. However, it has been emphasized DEMO business
35
angels are not philanthropists, and are indeed interested on company’s financials and return
on investment considerations (Landström 1998). Moreover, as most DEMO staged companies
tend to have limited trading history (Mason 2007), DEMO expect that business angels seek
companies that can clearly demonstrate their profit potential. Accordingly, I posit the
‘Financial performance’ hypothesis as follows:
H4: BAs invest in companies with good financial performance or companies with proven
profit potential
Business angels feel much more dependent on the people they DEMO in than other types of
investors (Landström 1998; Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason and Stark 2004). They indeed
place considerable weight on the entrepreneur or management team in their decision-making
and focus especially on the DEMO between themselves and the entrepreneur (Landström
1998). Most of the DEMO studies have emphasized the characteristics of the entrepreneur or
the management to be the most dominant investment criterion of business angels (Haar et al.
1988; Van Osnabrugge 2000; Stedler and Peters 2003; Mason and Stark 2004; Sudek 2006;
Clark 2008; Mitteness et al. 2012). DEMO is actually quite obvious result, as in early stages
there is DEMO relatively little evidence of the business performance, thus a capable
entrepreneur DEMO management team can make the difference. On the other hand, investment
DEMO relating to products or services are also found very significant for business angels
(Van Osnabrugge 2000; Stedler and Peters 2003; Clark 2008). Academics argue that they
predominantly evaluate the product potential (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Clark 2008) and
product uniqueness (Stedler and Peters 2003) in DEMO investment decision-making.
Accordingly, I posit the ‘Product and entrepreneur’ hypothesis as DEMO:
H5: BAs invest in companies with a combination of a DEMO product and capable entrepreneur
One of the most noteworthy characteristics of business angels is that they consider themselves
as hands-on investors (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason and Stark
2004; Paul et al. 2007). In addition to the capital injection, in many cases business angels are
reported to provide also their time and expertise (Mason 2007). Business angels might also
take board seats or have some other DEMO of employment relationships with their investee
businesses (e.g. Prowse 1998). DEMO they only have limited time to participate in the day-to-day
management due to investments in several private businesses (Mason and Harrison 2002; Paul
36
et al. 2007), they usually play advisory or monitoring roles (Stedler and Peters 2003; Mason
2007). With these hands-on roles, DEMO try to mitigate the agency conflicts between
themselves and entrepreneurs (Van DEMO 2000). They also seek to influence the
business and are willing to exploit their commercial skills, entrepreneurial experience,
business know-how and contacts (Mason and Harrison 1995). Thus, I posit the ‘Hands-on
contribution’ DEMO as follows:
H6: BAs invest in companies where they have DEMO to contribute with their expertise or
contacts
3.2. Hypotheses on business angel rejection criteria and business pitch
Prior literature suggests that business angels reject DEMO of the investment opportunities due
to deficiencies in the entrepreneur or the management team. Business angels tend to reject
opportunities if they feel that DEMO management team is weak or in capable (Haar et al. 1988;DEMO
Mason and Harrison 1996; Feeney et al. 1999), or if DEMO management team has unrealistic
assumptions or lacks credibility (Mason and Harrison DEMO). Opportunities are also rejected
due to owners’ personal qualities (Feeney DEMO al. 1999). As most of the business angels are
hands-on investors, they need to seek persons they can work with and rely on (Landström
1998; Prowse 1998). According to the prior literature, I should find entrepreneur or
management in top of my rejection reason list. DEMO, I posit the ‘Entrepreneur or
management’ hypothesis as follows:
H7: BAs reject opportunities primarily due to entrepreneur or management related reasons
The DEMO most commonly cited reason for rejection in prior literature is related to market or
marketing. For instance, business angels are predominantly turned off due to opportunities
with weak market potential (Haar et al. 1988; Mason DEMO Harrison 1996; Mason and Harrison
2003; Sudek 2006), marketing deficiencies (Mason and Harrison 1996), poor market size and
competition (Clark DEMO). Moreover, Mason and Harrison (2003) also found that the DEMO
most important rejection reason category was related to market issues. In their study, business
angels commented negatively on the failure to provide sufficient information in pitch meeting
relating to the market size, market value, segmentation, competition and potential customers
37
(Mason and Harrison 2003). Therefore, I assume that market DEMO reasons are also found in
my top three rejection criteria rank and posit the ‘Market’ hypothesis as follows:
H8: Market related issues is one of the most dominant rejection reason why BAs reject
opportunities
The DEMO literature findings on the third most common rejection reason for business angels is
not as clear cut as the first two. Hence, I posit hypothesis for investment criteria relating to
product or service, financials, valuation DEMO investor fit. First of all, the importance of product
or service DEMO an investment criterion is widely accepted (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Stedler and
Peters 2003; Clark 2008). However, it is not as widely DEMO as a rejection criterion.
Nevertheless, Mason and Harrison (1996 and 2003) have already twice concluded that
product related issues are indeed significant deal killers. As a result, I posit the ‘Product or
service’ hypothesis as follows:
H9: Product or service related issues is one of the most dominant reasons why BAs reject
opportunities
Moreover, my analysis on the prior literature suggests that, finance related reasons could
actually be the third most important reason why business angels reject their opportunities. For
instance, unrealistic or flawed financial projections (Mason and Harrison 1996; Clark 2008),
valuation (Haar et al. 1988; Mason and Harrison 1996; Clark 2008) and under-capitalization
(Feeney et al. 1999) are commonly cited deficiencies in financials. As business angels are
predominantly motivated to invest by financial reasons (Haar et al. 1988; Mason and Harrison
2002; Mason 2007; Riding 2008), business angels reject opportunities, in which they do not
see the potential for high capital appreciation, or if they are not able to agree on the price of
the company with the entrepreneurs (Feeney et al. 1999; Mason and Harrison 2002). Both of
these ultimately affect to the return on investment of business angels. Therefore, I posit the
hypotheses ‘Financials’ and ‘Valuation’ as follows:
H10: Financial considerations are one of the most dominant reasons why BAs reject
opportunities
H11: The likelihood of rejecting an opportunity increases with outrageous valuations
38
As fund managers need to consider whether the investment suits the DEMO criteria of the
fund, business angels need to consider does the DEMO meet their own personal
investment criteria (Mason and Harrison 2003). DEMO business angels invest in a wide
range of industries (Landström 1998; Mason and Harrison 2002), they usually prefer to invest
in business DEMO, technologies and products where they have previous knowledge or
experience (Feeney et al. 1999). Business angels reject on average 80 % of DEMO investment
propositions due to their lack of knowledge of the industry, DEMO or market (Mason and
Harrison 2002). Investor fit issues include DEMO relationship between the investor’s background,
skills and knowledge of the industry, market, technology, and the investment opportunity
(Mason and Stark 2004)DEMO It also includes the investor’s personal preferences: whether the
investor likes DEMO invest in this specific sector or market (Mason and Stark 2004)DEMO The
relationship between the entrepreneur and investor is also found crucial (DEMO 1998;
Prowse 1998). Moreover, as the investment criteria are DEMO investor-specific: one business
angel may reject an opportunity while another may DEMO it very appealing (Landström 1998).
As a result, I posit the ‘Investor fit’ hypothesis as follows:
H12: Although BAs invest in broad range of industries, investor fit issues might lead to
rejection
The economic outcome of the pitch meeting can be enormous for the success DEMO a company
(Clark 2008). Thus, the recent business angel literature has focused on the pitch meetings
(Mason and Harrison 2003; Sudek DEMO; Maxwell et al. 2011). However, the investment
criteria relating to presentational factors are not found to be that significant. For instance,
DEMO (2008) found that business angels commented presentational issues, such as DEMO clarity
or understand ability of the entrepreneur, the structure of the DEMO presentation, the level of
information provided, the entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics, DEMO their ability to sell
themselves and their investment opportunity. Nevertheless, the DEMO issues only affect
whether the business angels are willing to continue listen to your pitch, but do not seem to
affect the ultimate investment decision (Clark 2008). On the other hand, rejection criteria
relating DEMO presentational flaws (Mason and Harrison 2003) and not providing sufficient
information to business angels (Mason and Harrison 2002) are viewed as more DEMO As a
result, I posit my final hypothesis the ‘Business pitch’ DEMO follows:
39
H13: Although a business pitch is not purely a reason to invest, it might give a rejection
reason for BAs

4 METHODOLOGY AND DATA
This chapter introduces the method and the DEMO employed in my study. The unique data on
business angels employed is sourced from a TV show called the Dragons’ Den. In the first
DEMO, I will briefly introduce the concept and rules of the Dragons’ DEMO In the second
section, I will introduce the methodologies employed. In DEMO third section, I will introduce the
data employed including the sample DEMO and coding process, and finally I outline the
final samples and DEMO used to test my hypothesis.
4.1. Introduction to Dragons’ Den
Dragons’ Den is a global real-life TV show produced and presented in several countries. DEMO
basic idea of the show is very simple. In each episode, DEMO are a handful of entrepreneurs,
who come to the Den to pitch for an investment in their businesses from a panel of Dragons.
DEMO Dragons are business angels, who are willing to invest their own DEMO in these
entrepreneurial businesses in exchange for equity. There are always five investors present at
the Den to review the investment opportunities and two DEMO them are female. In the following
paragraphs, I will go briefly DEMO the rules of the Dragons’ Den. 3
First of all, the DEMO must start the initial pitch up to three minutes, by stating DEMO
name, the name of the business, the amount of money they are pitching for and the percentage
of equity they are willing to DEMO in exchange. After the initial pitch there is always a Q&A
session. However, the entrepreneurs do not have to answer all the questions asked by the
Dragons, but it may affect the outcome, if DEMO for instance refuse to reveal the company’s
financials. Entrepreneurs may also ask the Dragons any questions that help them determine
whether they are suitable DEMO for their business. It is important to note that anything that
is discussed in the Den can be potentially broadcasted. The entrepreneurs' time in the Den is
over after all five Dragons have declared themselves “out”.
DEMO entrepreneur must secure at least the total amount they have asked for at the beginning of
the pitch or they exit empty-handed. If a DEMO offers less than the full amount, the
entrepreneur needs to secure DEMO investment from one or more of the remaining Dragons to
make up the total. A full investment may involve a maximum of five parties. DEMO
entrepreneur can also negotiate more money than was originally requested, as DEMO is usually

41
to redress the sticking point of an entrepreneur giving up more DEMO than was initially
offered. Each Dragon acts as individual investors and can invest as little or as much of their
own money as they DEMO An entrepreneur can also reject an investment from a Dragon if they
think they are not suitable investor for them or if they cannot DEMO on the terms.
The deal agreed on the Den is an unwritten agreement that depends on due diligence checks,
and relies on the DEMO of both parties to freely enter the transaction and be fully committed
to seeing it through. However, the deal is solely between the Dragon and the entrepreneur and
after additional meetings, if an agreement cannot be reached, neither party is legally obliged
to complete the deal. The production company (BBC) remains impartial, as they cannot be
involved in the business contract between the two parties. The entrepreneurs are allowed to
have DEMO advocate on standby in the Den, to help them answer some DEMO the Dragons' questions.
They can ask the Dragons to meet their DEMO at any point after the three-minute pitch.
However, this advocate must DEMO be someone who is directly involved in the business, and
be DEMO, screen-tested and have gone through the same personal checks as the
DEMO
4.2. Methodology
This thesis employs an applied observational interaction method to study the research
questions. The usability of questionnaire and interview studies has been DEMO criticized in
business angel literature (e.g. Mason and Harrison 2003; Mason and Stark 2004). Hence, the
recent literature has employed more real-time studies to overcome the problems present in the
prior studies. Verbal protocol DEMO 4 is one of the successfully used real-time
methodologies employed to examine both venture capital (e.g. Hall and Hofer 1993) and
business angel DEMO (e.g. Mason and Rogers 1997; Mason and Stark 2004). In this
thesis, I chose to employ an observational interaction method, which DEMO an improved version
of the verbal protocol analysis, previously used by DEMO et al. (2011). Observational
interaction technique is designed to record DEMO between parties, which then allow
extracting patterns for further analysis (Maxwell et al. 2011). The method usually involves
first videotaping the interactions DEMO are subject to observations, and then coding and
analysing them to DEMO behaviours and information exchanges during these interactions
(Maxwell et al. 2011)DEMO
4 For further readings on Verbal protocol analysis review Ericsson and Herbert (1984).
42
The aim of my study was to observe the interactions between DEMO entrepreneurs and business
angels during initial screening stage, in order to DEMO conclusions regarding the business
angel investment decision-making criteria. As my observations were based on Dragons’ Den,
I had no need to record the DEMO myself. Hence, my applied observational interaction
approach consists of four phases. DEMO first phase consisted of positing and motivating the
hypothesis based on the prior literature. The second phase consisted of building an Excel
spreadsheet for DEMO observations and coding the rejection criteria. The third phase consisted of
observing Dragons’ Den and collecting both quantitative and qualitative notes in the
observation DEMO Finally, the last phase consisted of both quantitative and qualitative
analysis DEMO test my hypothesis. As of the quantitative phase, I selected to DEMO frequencies, and
other descriptive tables to show my results, which are commonly used in the area of business
angel decision-making literature. For the DEMO phase, I selected three case companies
from my final sample to DEMO further evidence and additional depth to my findings. In the
next section, I will familiarize the data employed including the sample collection and coding
processes, and finally present the samples and proxies used to test my hypothesis in Table VII.
4.3. Data
The unique data on business angels DEMO in my thesis is sourced from a TV show called
the Dragons’ Den. Due to the criticism of poor quality contestants and ideas seen DEMO the first
seasons of the TV show, I focused on the DEMO recent ones by analysing the latest two
production seasons of the UK version of Dragons’ Den. Hence, my sample is sourced from
episodes 1-12 in season 10 and from episodes 1-6 in season 11, which were available at that
point in time. These seasons were originally aired on DEMO in 2012 and in latter part of 2013,
respectively. Although each episode lasts only 44 minutes, it took me roughly one and half
hours per each episode to watch and record the observations. By analysing DEMO seasons, I
was able to observe a total of seven business DEMO, of which three were female, in their
decision-making process whether to invest in potential businesses opportunities. By investing,
I mean whether the DEMO angels select these companies past the initial screening stage to
the due diligence. The total number of pitch meetings observed amounts to 129, which
consists of 27 successful and 102 declined opportunities. The above-average sample size DEMO
reasonable in the area of studying business angel decision-making, as usually DEMO sample size
is far less than 100. Nevertheless, I consider my DEMO as a large case study due to the
relatively low small sample size in general.
43
Prior literature suggests that business angels are typically well-educated, middle-aged men
with significant net worth, which is usually acquired via entrepreneurial activities (DEMO et
al. 1999; Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason 2007). The seven business angels observed in my
sample fit well in this classification, as they are mostly men, their average age is 54 ranging
from 43 to 65, and most of them are serial entrepreneurs and hence self-made millionaires.
However, most of the Dragons have acquired their entrepreneurial and management skills by
building and selling companies rather than attending higher education DEMO Only two of
the Dragons had a college or university degree. On the other hand, I am not aware of the
criteria the production company has used in selecting these Dragons. Due to the small
population DEMO female business angels, I could guess, that selecting suitable women Dragons
might have been much more difficult than finding their male counterparts. Hence, these
female Dragons might be sort of pushed into to the format DEMO potential bias. However,
due to the similar characteristics compared to the ‘normal’ BAs, I am confident, that that the
Dragons are good DEMO representing the business angel population in general. Table IV provides
a brief introduction to the observed business angels.

The central focus of this thesis is on the pitch meetings, which generally take place at the
initial screening stage (Mason and DEMO 2003; Maxwell et al. 2011), before the investors
have even DEMO their business plan or met the entrepreneurs in person (Clark 2008)DEMO The

Hilary Devey, Kelly Hoppen and Piers Linney, retrieved 17.9.2014.

pitch meetings seen on the Dragons’ Den are very similar in DEMO to the real-life pitch
meeting settings described by Mason and Harrison (DEMO) and Clark (2008). In addition,
Dragons’ Den provides an exciting case study to observe the interaction of the entrepreneurs
and the DEMO angels, because the Dragons are indeed making real decisions with real
DEMO by investing their own money and time in these businesses. Hence, DEMO setting is far
less artificial than for instance the real-time study of Mason and Stark (2004). Moreover,
numerous academics have previously used television shows in their studies, and have
confirmed that they are indeed good platforms to study real-life decision-making (e.g.
Maxwell et al. 2011).
Table V
Illustration of the observation spreadsheet categories
Table illustrates the broad DEMO and observed aspects used to take notes on the observations in the Excel
spreadsheet. Each of the observed aspects in different categories had their DEMO columns in the spreadsheet to
write down the corresponding observations.
Category Observed aspects
1. Initial offer The amount of capital requested, equity stake offered and the implied valuation
calculated from the previous two.
2. Business Name, founding year, description of the products/services, patents and
opportunities. Do DEMO like the business or Product/service?
3. Entrepreneur/Management Experience and track-record of the entrepreneur, and comments on the
business pitch. Do Dragons like the entrepreneur and are they willing to work
with the entrepreneur?DEMO
4. Market Comments of the market by the entrepreneurs and investors.
4. Financials and valuations Sales, costs, margins, pricing, profits and cash DEMO, also ROI, exit
opportunities, and valuation: invested capital and equity given up.
5. Negotiations and offers Offers, comments on the offers and investing Dragons and their expertise.
6. Rejection criteria 10 sub-categories. See classification DEMO business angel rejection criteria in
Table VI.
7. Other Other interesting comments and observations.
Table V illustrates the observation spreadsheet and the aspects observed DEMO each
opportunity. The spreadsheet had seven upper categories including the initial offer, business,
entrepreneur or management, market, financials and valuation, negotiations DEMO offers,
rejection criteria and other. Moreover, these seven categories were DEMO into multiple sub-
categories to collect the specific observations. For instance, DEMO business category I
collected the data regarding the basic info of the company, such as name, founding year,
description of the product DEMO services, and information regarding patents and opportunities. In
addition, I also collected a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ data regarding questions such as do DEMO
Dragons like the business model and do they like the product or service.
45
Table VI presents the classifications of business angel rejection criteria, which are based on
the investment criteria classifications of Mason and Stark (2004). My aim was to observe 10
different rejection criteria and how DEMO criteria accumulate during the observations in order
to find out the rank of those criteria. My rejection criteria categories included: product or
service, DEMO and competition, financial considerations, entrepreneur or management,
business and strategy, investor fit, patents and protection, and other. Moreover, financial
considerations DEMO was divided into three sub-categories: financial performance, return
on investment and valuation. For instance, entrepreneur or management category included:
background, experience DEMO track-record of the entrepreneur or the management team, their
personal qualities, their preparedness and attitude in the pitch meeting, and the range of skills
and business know how they possess. It also included investors’ personal DEMO whether
they like the entrepreneur and are they willing to work with the entrepreneur. The rejection
criteria observations were coded as dummy variables in DEMO spreadsheet. For example, if a
Dragon rejected an opportunity due to DEMO of managerial knowhow”, then a ‘1’ was coded
in entrepreneur or DEMO category. If no other reason was provided, a ‘0’ was coded DEMO
all the other rejection reason categories.

Classification of business angel rejection criteria
Table able represents DEMO classification of the rejection reason categories. These categories were used in
observations by coding the rejection criteria reasons as dummy variables according to the DEMO If a
rejection reason was identified in one of these categories that category received a value of ‘1’, otherwise the
category had a value of ‘0’.

data I was able to gather. DEMO final sample sizes on business angel investment criteria relate to
Description
The nature of the product or service, in terms of its concept,
uniqueness, distinctiveness, and innovativeness. It also includes aspects
such as the DEMO, technology, brand, customer focus, and life cycle of
the product. In addition, it includes investors’ perceptions of the
product potential and their personal preferences i.e. whether they like
the product or service.
The size, potential and growth of the market, demonstrated market
need, level or DEMO of competition and barriers to entry (e.g. needs
more money to DEMO the market and compete within the field)
This includes three aspects: (3.) the financial performance of the
business e.g. sales, costs, margins, pricing, profits and cash flow, (4.)
the return DEMO investment from investors’ point of view and exit
opportunities, and (5.) the valuation i.e. implied value of the
equity/business worth in respect to the pitched investment size and
equity stake.
The background, experience and track-record of the entrepreneur or
management team, their personal qualities (e.g. DEMO,
reliability), their preparedness and attitude in pitch meeting, and DEMO
range of skills and business know how they possess (e.g. essential
DEMO and business skills). In addition, it includes investors’
personal preferences DEMO they like the entrepreneur and are they
willing to work with the entrepreneur.
The overall concept and strategy of the business including business
potential DEMO growth opportunities of the business.
This includes three elements: (I) DEMO relationship between the
investment opportunity and investor’s own background, skills and
DEMO of the industry, market, technology, etc., (II) the investor’s
preferences i.e. is this an industry, market, etc. that the investor DEMO
to invest in, (III) and time considerations e.g. do they DEMO enough time
for hands-on approach.
This category includes issues relating to patents and overall protection
in terms of how easily the business or product DEMO or could be copied.
This category represents the comments on any aspects of the business
which cannot be coded in any other category.

either to the total number of business pitches observed (129) DEMO to the number of the accepted
companies (27). On the DEMO hand, the business angel rejection criteria samples are based on
the DEMO of rejection reason comments (241) provided by the investors in all of the
business opportunities observed (129).
I also selected three case companies from my sample to provide additional depth and support
for my DEMO The first case company was called ‘Skinny Tan’, a business selling DEMO
tanning and cellulite reducing creams; the second company was ‘Shampooheads’ offering DEMO
clinically approved character based shampoo range for children; and the third DEMO was
‘YUUbag’, which makes back bags and accessories for children. I DEMO these companies,
as all of the business angels were interested to pursue a deal with these entrepreneurs and they
indeed received multiple offers. DEMO in which all of the investors were interested to
make a deal were present in less than 1 % of all opportunities observed. Hence, these
companies make an ideal case study, as they clearly had everything in place to get all the
Dragons to fight for an investment.

5 RESULTS
5.1 Results on business angel investment criteria
This chapter DEMO and discusses the results based on my observations and analyses that I
performed to address the key research questions of the thesis. The first DEMO elaborates the
findings on business angel investment criteria and syndication. The second section
concentrates on the business angel rejection criteria results. The third section DEMO the
findings on business pitch. The result sections are organized to follow the order of the
hypothesis posited in Chapter 3.
H1: BAs invests primarily in start-ups or early staged companies seeking for expansion
financing
Prior DEMO suggests that business angels invest primarily in start-up companies or early
staged companies seeking for expansion financing (e.g. Mason and Harrison 2002). In my
sample out of 129 observed pitch meetings 27 companies were able DEMO secure a deal with the
business angels. From the Table VIII, DEMO can see that business angels made most of their
investments (63 DEMO) in companies with two years or less of operating experience. Only DEMO of
these accepted companies had not “gone live” yet and both of them were classified as online
or technology companies. Furthermore, a clear majority of the deals (89 %) agreed on the Den
was made DEMO companies with four years or less of operating experience representing early-
stage investments. Moreover, these 24 companies averaged with 1.8 years of operating history.
The intended use of funds of 11 out of these 24 companies DEMO revealed in the TV show.
These entrepreneurs argued that they were seeking capital for marketing, research and
development, production and warehousing. Moreover, the common theme amongst the
entrepreneurs was that they were willing to expand DEMO businesses with the requested capital.
According to a recent UK market research of Deloitte and UK Business Angels Association
(UKBAA), 83 % of business angel capital was allocated into early-staged business, with 29 %
going to seed, and start-up companies.6Although my findings place more emphasis on earlier
staged deals, the actual market statistics are pretty well aligned with my findings and
supporting the early stage investment habit in general.

My case companies were also established on average 1.9 years ago. DEMO Dragons’
perspective, they were also seeking capital for the right purpose, as they were willing to
expand their businesses. For instance, Skinny Tan was willing to expand to UK by replicating
their huge success in DEMO and YUUbag was willing to buy stock, as they were sold DEMO
on a TV shopping channel in only six weeks. Unfortunately, the DEMO show did not clearly
reveal the intended use of funds of the Shampooheads. However, their vision was to build
world’s most successful hair care brand for children, which implies significant expansions in
the future, and DEMO already held patents for their characters in UK, EU and US. DEMO, my
case companies were also all classified as early stage companies DEMO for expansion
financing.

On the other hand, it seems that business angels are not that critical of operating years in their
investment criteria, as they invest in more mature companies as well. Clark (2008) also argues
DEMO the stage of the business is not that important as investment criteria. For instance, in my
sample business angels also agreed to finance companies with 7, 10 and 12 years of operating
history. Nevertheless, those DEMO staged deals represents only a small minority (11 %) of the
total accepted deals in my sample. As a result, I fail to reject the hypothesis H1, and conclude
that business angels look primarily for start-ups and early staged companies seeking for
expansion financing.
51
H2: Female BAs are more conservative in their investment decision-making than male BAs
According to my findings in Table IX, women business angels are more critical in their
investments, as they accepted only 9 % of the opportunities they saw compared to 19 %
acceptance rate of DEMO male counterparts. Taking both genders into account, business angels
accepted 21 DEMO of the opportunities they saw. However, I believe that the total DEMO rate
would be even higher, as the pitch meetings shown on DEMO are most likely or can be
manipulated by the editing of the series. Moreover, my guess is that the editors have shown
all of the successful pitches on TV, but due to making the format more interesting, they have
left out some of the unsuccessful ones to keep the ratio of accepted and rejected opportunities
at a certain level. For DEMO, on average there were 1.5 successful pitch meetings against
5.7 failed DEMO per one TV show. Thus, no generalization should be drawn out DEMO the total
rejection or acceptance rates of my sample. However, the DEMO specific rejection rates are
still useful in highlighting the differences in investment behaviour of male and female
business angels. As the investors had an DEMO opportunity to invest in each of the businesses,
I argue that women business angels are more critical in their investments, as they invested in
fewer opportunities than men.

the median investment was £75,000 and the largest amounted to £250,DEMO These findings are

52
less (Mason and Harrison 2002). However, it is less DEMO the median business angel
investment of £160,000 found in a recent UK market research (Deloitte-UKBAA 2013).
Relating to the gender differences, DEMO conclude that male business angels tend to invest in
greater volume, DEMO larger amounts of capital and tend to syndicate less than female business
angels. However, we still need to bear in mind that there were always 3 men and 2 women
investors present at the den and DEMO course they all invested within their own budgets.
Although these facts may skew the results, I am confident in the general direction of my
findings. One possible explanation for these above mentioned gender differences is that
DEMO are generally seen as more conservative investors than men and tend to take fewer
risks (Jianakoplos and Bernasek 1998; Sunden and Surette 1998)DEMO In light of my gender
hypothesis H2, I also argue, that women business angels can actually be more critical in their
investments or DEMO stricter investment criteria when they evaluate business opportunities.

H3: Investment size, equity stake and deal valuation increase in DEMO investments
Prior literature has found that business angels tend to syndicate with other business angels
(Prowse 1998; Feeney et al. 1999; Paul et al. 2007). A recent market research also found that
almost three DEMO (73 %) of UK business angels usually or always invest within a
syndicate and the trend is increasing (Deloitte-UKBAA 2013). My results also suggest that
business angel syndication is actually quite common, as business angels made syndicated
investments 11 (41 %) times out of a DEMO of 27 accepted deals. Although these business
angels had the option to invest with maximum of five people, only two people syndicates
were formed. The finding is in line with the prior literature, as there are typically two to three
business angels per each deal (Morrissette 2007).

Table XII presents the investment size in accepted deals classified by DEMO and the type of
investment. My findings suggest that syndication does no lead to larger investments. The
54
average investment made in the den was £87,188 and average DEMO syndicated deal amounted
to £72,727. Thus, by first look it DEMO that syndication can actually lead to a smaller
investment size. However, DEMO to small sample size, the statistical significance of the mean
differences DEMO groups is questionable according to t-statistics shown in Appendix I. On
the other hand, if we look at the median values of total investments, both single and
syndicated investments amounted to £75,000. Moreover, the DEMO individual contribution
in syndicated investments amounts to £37,500, as all DEMO the syndicated investments included
only two investors. The difference of the average and median values in my sample can be
explained by two large DEMO investment made by male investors. As the median takes out
these outliers, we find that syndication does not lead to either smaller or larger investment
size for men and when combining both genders. However, syndicated investments seem to
slightly increase the median investment size of women business angels DEMO £72,500 to
£75,000. As the investment size does not increase in syndicated investments compared to
single investments, at least part of my syndicated investments hypothesis H3 is rejected.

Table XIII presents the valuation in accepted deals classified by gender DEMO type of
investment. If we look at the syndication results at gender level, we find similar results than
with investment size: the average DEMO decreases for men but increases for women. By
taking both genders into account, my findings suggest that the average valuation decreases if
business angels syndicate. The average valuation in single investments was £276,112
compared to DEMO,971 in syndicated deals. However, the statistical significance of mean
differences DEMO again questionable according to t-statistics shown in Appendix I&II. By
analysing the median values, syndication leads to increased valuations for both men and
women business angels. Similar results are found when taking both genders into DEMO, as
the median valuation actually increases from £204,167 to £222,DEMO due to syndication. As the
median values are better in representing the total population in my case, I conclude that deal
value increases with syndicated investments. Furthermore, I argue that with syndicated
investments individual investors can take part in larger deals in terms of equity value, but with
significantly smaller individual capital contributions. These findings provide partial support
for my DEMO investments hypothesis H3.
Table XIV presents the equity stakes acquired in accepted deals classified by gender and type
of investment. According to my sample, when women business angels make single
investments they typically acquire larger equity DEMO than men. The average acquired equity
stake is 40 % with females and only 33 % with male investors. The mean difference (t = -3.15)
is statistically significant at the 1 % level (see Appendix II). Moreover, the median acquired
equity stake is 40 % with females and only 30 % with male investors. For women the median
DEMO stake remains stagnant whether the deal is a single investment or done within a
syndicate. On the other hand, for male business angels and when taking both genders into
account, the median acquired equity stake actually increases in syndicated investments by 10 %
and 8 %, respectively. Hence, the above presented increase in deal valuation in syndicated
investments can be explained by the larger equity stakes acquired, as the investment size
remains fairly stagnant between single and syndicated investments.

As a result of the findings in Tables XII-XIV, DEMO seems that my syndication hypothesis H3 is
partially true, as the DEMO value and acquired equity stake increases in syndicated investments.
However, my DEMO do not support the increase in investment size with syndicated
investments, DEMO contradicts to the prior literature (e.g. Kelly and Hay 2003; Mason 2007).
The investment size increases in syndicated investments only with female DEMO angels and
the difference is only marginal. Nevertheless, the individual capital DEMO of business
angels in syndicated investments is still only half compared to single investments. These
slightly contradictory results to prior literature suggest that further DEMO should be made
regarding the dynamics of syndication. In addition, my DEMO supports the idea of women
being more conservative and risk-averse investors than men, as they reject more opportunities,
tend to invest with slightly smaller sums, in smaller businesses in terms of equity value,
acquire larger equity stakes individually, and tend to syndicate more compared to men
business angels. As a result, I fail to reject my gender hypothesis H2.
57
An additional finding from my sample was that syndication is not DEMO investors’ choice.
Out of 11 syndicated investments, four times (36 %) the entrepreneur(s) asked for investment
from certain investors, and three times (27 %) the investors made originally an offer for half
DEMO the amount requested by the entrepreneur and left the negotiation table open for
syndication. Most interestingly, four times (36 %) the syndication happened in a competitive
bidding situation, in which multiple individual offers were on the table at first and then
investors who were willing to syndicate DEMO each other ended up winning. Thus, I argue that
syndication might DEMO be a strategic choice in order to win the investment in a competitive
bidding situation.

The analysis of Table XV does not provide any evidence that syndication is prone to happen
more DEMO with certain types sectors. However, the result might be different with DEMO
set of accepted deals. Hence, future studies might try to find DEMO whether sector has an
effect on forming the syndications. For instance, DEMO business angels tend to syndicate more in
competitive sectors where the risks of achieving success are greater, or do they tend to
syndicate with people who have more experience from certain sectors? For instance, in DEMO
the business angels tend to syndicate due to risk sharing purposes and leveraging larger pools
of capital, contacts and skills (Deloitte-UKBAA 2013).

H4: BAs invest in companies with good financial performance or companies with proven
profit potential
The data collected from observations was unfortunately not DEMO rich in numbers. For instance,
I was only able to record the revenues of 18 companies out of 27 accepted ones due to DEMO
of the show. Similar poor statistics followed with profits and pro forma figures as well. On
average, the accepted companies had revenues of £363,500. However, the revenues varied a
lot depending on the opportunity, DEMO the minimum revenues were £3,000 and maximum of
£885,000 with a standard deviation of £295,894. Nevertheless, by observing the show, DEMO was
clear that the investors were more interested in opportunities, which DEMO had significant
revenues or if they were able to show a clear potential in making cash flows in the future due
to growth opportunities.
DEMO we look at my case companies, they all had either trading DEMO or pre-orders, as a sign of
existing or future cash flows. DEMO of these companies had already significant revenues and
had turned to positive. Skinny Tan had turned over £600,000 in only six months in DEMO,
and YUUbag made £525,000 in last fiscal. Both of the companies were also profitable, as
Skinny Tan had £450,000 in profits, and YUUbag argued that they can increase their profits
from current level of £6,000 to £130,000 in one year after margin improvements. DEMO the
contrary, Shampooheads did not have any sales yet. However, they had received a huge order
(41 000 units) from a large DEMO distributor with nearly 500 stores. The chain expected
that they could sell 1 000 units per week supporting the revenue potential of that opportunity.
DEMO they clearly had the potential, as they had significant pre-orders and DEMO distribution in
place. As a result and not surprisingly, I argue DEMO business angels seek companies with good
financial performance or opportunities with proven business potential in terms of revenue,
profits or cash flow. Hence, I conclude, finding weak evidence for my financial performance
hypothesis H4.
H5: BAs invest in companies with a combination of a good product and capable entrepreneur
Prior literature has found that management or entrepreneur related reasons DEMO the
business angel investment criteria (Haar et al. 1988; Van Osnabrugge 2000; Stedler and Peters
2003; Mason and Stark 2004; Sudek 2006; Clark 2008; Mitteness et al. 2012), and product
related reasons DEMO also found near the top (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Stedler and Peters 2003;
59
Clark 2008). As those criteria are found so frequently, I posited hypothesis that business
angels are seeking for a combination of those DEMO I try to proxy the business angel
investment criteria with positive comments relating to these criteria in the observed pitch
meetings.
According to my DEMO in Table XVI, investors made positive comments relating to the
product DEMO service that the entrepreneur was offering in nearly all (93 %) of the accepted deals.
On the contrary, these same investors made similar comments only slightly over half of the
time (53 %) with DEMO total of 102 rejected opportunities. Furthermore, positive comments
relating to the DEMO and his or her qualities, or the investors willingness to work DEMO
the entrepreneur, were made in nearly half (48 %) of DEMO accepted deals, and only in a small
proportion (12 %) DEMO the rejected opportunities. Moreover, a combination of a good product or
DEMO and a capable and/or likeable entrepreneur was found in nearly half (48 %) of the
accepted deals and only in small minority (10 %) of the rejected opportunities. Thus, I argue
that it DEMO crucial that a business angel needs to like the product or service in order to make an
investment. It is also crucial that the DEMO finds the entrepreneur capable and that they can
work with each other.
Table XVI
Positive comments about people or product
Table presents business angels’ DEMO comments relating to the
people or product, or a combination of DEMO All the figures are
presented as a percentages of all opportunities (DEMO). A total of

Although in slightly over half (52 %) of the accepted deals investors did not make any
positive comments about DEMO entrepreneur, it does not necessarily imply that the investors did
not DEMO the entrepreneur or do not like to work with them. For instance, after an agreed deal
with one of my case companies, an DEMO said that: "Every time on DD I'm investing in
people. A person who's not competent or who I don't like DEMO a good idea is not going to get
an investment. I like both of them, I think they are passionate, focused, they knew where they
are going, they have done their homework, they have DEMO, and they were exactly my sort
of people.” Thus and not DEMO, a good product is solely not enough, but the
60
entrepreneur needs to be capable as well. Also other similar comments DEMO made in the TV
show, such as "I invest in people first and product secondly" or "I first look at the people, then
the product." Thus, the percentage of liking or willing to DEMO with an entrepreneur in
accepted deals might actually be much higher than my data reveals, as investors tend to look
both the product and the entrepreneur. These findings support the fact that business angels are
indeed DEMO a combination of good products and capable people, which provides modest
DEMO for my hypothesis H5. Although the findings on Table XVI places greater weight on
the product, the comments made by the investors emphasises more on the entrepreneur as an
investment criteria.
If we take a closer DEMO at my case companies, we can definitely argue that these businesses
DEMO quite unlike to each other in terms of what they are offering. However I find many
similarities as well, in all of these opportunities the investors said that they liked the product,
liked the business DEMO and would like to work with the entrepreneurs. All of these three
companies were managed with an entrepreneurial duo. In two of the cases DEMO owners
included two friends and in one case the owners were a married couple with children.
Moreover, in all of the cases the owners or management showed clear commitment to their
businesses, as they had left their day jobs and were focusing on their entrepreneurial
businesses. In addition, the management team in all of these cases either had a successful
DEMO record, or they had relevant experience from the field, or they had gained some general
skills in previous vacancies that were seen as DEMO When investors were asking questions
from the entrepreneurs about the market or the company financials, they proved that they had
done their homework by showing good market knowledge and ability to know and discuss
their numbers DEMO their financial projections. A clear feeling was built, that these
entrepreneurs DEMO prepared well and had a clear vision of where they were going, which most
definitely built trust between the investors and entrepreneurs. The findings from my case
companies provide additional support for hypothesis H5.
H6: BAs invest in companies where they have ability to contribute with their expertise DEMO
contacts
Many academics have argued that business angels are value-added investors who seek for
hands-on contribution in their investee businesses (Van Osnabrugge 2000; DEMO and
Harrison 2002; Mason and Stark 2004; Paul et al. 2007). Hence, I investigated how many
61
times in the accepted deals the investors argued, that they can bring more than money to the
table. Table XVII highlights the findings DEMO business angels’ hands-on contribution.
Table XVII

Table presents positive comments that investors made regarding the

According to my findings, in slightly over half (52 DEMO) of the accepted deals the investors
indeed had some kind of DEMO, which could benefit the entrepreneurial business seeking
for financing. For instance, the investors argued that they are willing to provide sector
knowledge, production or distribution experience/channels/facilities, or they claimed to have
local or global contacts that could help the entrepreneurs. Moreover, in many of these cases
the investor used their experience or contacts as a negotiation point DEMO secure an investment in
a competitive bidding situation. On the other hand, in some of the cases the entrepreneurs
themselves pitched that they do not only need the capital, but also the investors’ expertise and
contacts. Hence, there seems to be a mutual understanding of business angels’ hands-on role
between the entrepreneurs and the investors. Moreover, a combination of product and
expertise was found in a significant proportion (44 %) of DEMO accepted deals and a
combination of product, people and expertise was DEMO approximately in a quarter (26 %) of
the accepted deals. Thus, it might be the case that business angels can relax their investment
criteria relating to the people, if they are able to contribute something to the business, that the
entrepreneurs’ lack and is essential to the business success. Therefore, I argue that business
angels indeed seek companies that they can help with their expertise or contacts, providing
modest support for my hypothesis H6. The finding is well aligned with the agency theory
DEMO proposed by Van Osnabrugge (2000).

Table DEMO summarizes the findings on business angel investment criteria presented in this
section. First of all, I find evidence that business angels tend to invest in early-staged
companies seeking for expansion financing, which is well aligned with the earlier results
found in the academia (e.g. Landström 1998). I also find that gender plays a role in business
angel investing. Finding DEMO fundamental as women BAs are understudied in the literature. For
instance, DEMO results supports the idea of women being more conservative and risk-averse
investors than men, as they tend to invest with slightly smaller sums, DEMO smaller businesses in
terms of equity value, acquire larger equity stakes DEMO, and tend to syndicate more
compared to men business angels. Female DEMO angels also tend to be pickier in their
investments, as they DEMO more opportunities than their male counterparts. I also find my
syndication hypothesis to be partially true, as deal value and acquired equity stake tend to
increase in syndicated investments. However, my results do not support the increase in
investment size in syndicated investments. The latter finding calls for DEMO research on the
subject, as it contradicts to the earlier research (e.g. Kelly and Hay 2003; Mason 2007). I also
find evidence that business angels seek companies with good financial performance or
companies with DEMO profit potential. Although this evidence is quite obvious, it might be
DEMO financial considerations are underestimated in the prior literature, as discussed later DEMO In
addition, I find some evidence that business angels seek companies DEMO a combination of
good products and capable entrepreneurs. Supporting the agency theory view (Van
Osnabrugge 2000) and my hands-on hypothesis, I find evidence that that business angels are
seeking to invest in companies that they DEMO help with their expertise or contacts.

5.2 Results on business angel rejection criteria
Business angel rejection reasons DEMO significantly easier to proxy and observe, than the
investment criteria of DEMO angels. According to the rules of the Dragons’ Den, each
investor DEMO to either declare themselves “out” or try to negotiate a deal with the
entrepreneur(s) with each investment opportunity. When investors were opting “out” they also
needed to provide reasoning for their decision. Thus, it was easy to keep track on how these
rejection reasons accumulate during my DEMO In my sample, the observed business
angels provided a total of DEMO rejection reasons in 129 business opportunities they were
presented. On average 1.8 different rejection reasons were provided per each opportunity with
minimum of zero DEMO maximum of five reasons. Each rejection reason was calculated only
once per each opportunity. For instance, if three investors argued that the valuation was too
high, the reason ‘valuation’ was recorded only once. Only seven times of all of the
opportunities the business angels did not provide any DEMO for rejection. In these seven
cases, either all of the investors DEMO interested to pursue a deal with the entrepreneur, or
there was DEMO a good deal on the table and some or rest of the investors were not willing
to compete with the prevailing offer.

the fact, that only a DEMO fraction of the opportunities (3 %) are either perfect or good
enough to not to give any solid reasoning for investors to opt DEMO According to my full list
of rejection reasons, business angels seem DEMO reject opportunities primarily due to product or
service related reasons (20 DEMO), market and competition related reasons (13 %), return on
DEMO related reasons (12 %), and due to valuation related reasons (10 %). These four
categories cover over half (55 %) DEMO the total rejection reasons in my sample. By taking into
consideration the tied fifth place, financial performance and entrepreneur or management
related reasons, DEMO reasons cover nearly three quarters (73 %) of the rejection reasons in
combined.
However, for additional analysis I created a shortlist of rejection reasons where I combined
following categories: ROI, valuation, and financial performance to represent the financial
considerations in total. As Mason and Stark (2004) used those categories together in their
business angel study, it makes DEMO comparison more reliable. Moreover, it is reasonable to
combine these categories DEMO a company’s financials are directly linked to the valuation and
both ultimately affects to the return on investment, when investors are exiting their investment.
According to my shortlist of rejection reasons, two of the categories clearly dominate the
rejection reasons of business angels: financial considerations (32 %) and product or service
related reasons (20 %). Other significant rejection reasons were relating to: market and
competition (13 %), entrepreneur DEMO management (9 %) and reasons relating to business
potential and strategy (9%). In combined, the top five categories represent a majority (82 %)
of the total rejection reasons. Other less significant rejection DEMO categories were: investor
fit (7 %), patents and protection (DEMO %) and other reasons (3 %). The shortlist of rejection
reason categories are presented in Table XX.

As discussed earlier, past literature suggest, that the three most dominant deal killers are
found to be related to the entrepreneur or management team (Haar et al. 1988; Mason and
Harrison 1996; Feeney et al. 1999; Mason and Harrison 2002; Mason and Harrison 2003;
Clark 2008), market potential (Haar et al. 1988; Mason and Harrison 1996; Mason and
Harrison 2003; Clark 2008) and financials (Haar et al. 1988; Mason DEMO Harrison 1996). Thus,
my findings are only partially aligned to the earlier studies discussed, as similar categories are
found in top five - although at different weightings. As in earlier studies, my results supports
the idea that market related reasons and financials are indeed found in DEMO top three most
common rejection reasons. However, financials are seen as DEMO significant in my study than
in earlier studies, as they clearly DEMO the rejection criteria list. On the other hand, I find
entrepreneur DEMO management related reasons to be less significant as argued in previous
studies. Entrepreneur or management team is ranked in fourth place after product or DEMO
related reasons. As I do not find the entrepreneur or management as the most dominant (Top 1)
rejection criteria of business angels, DEMO reject the hypothesis H7. On the other hand, as I find
DEMO market related and product or service related issues to be very significant rejection
reasons for business angels (in Top 3), I conclude finding evidence for hypothesis H8 and H9.
The reason that my results deviate DEMO the earlier research, as they are not dominated by the
entrepreneur DEMO management related reasons, might be due to following reasons. Most of DEMO
66
prior literature studies on business angels have been conducted either ex DEMO or ex post the
decision-making via interviews or questionnaires, which might DEMO the action of business
angels. On one hand, it is much DEMO to criticize the people before or after the pitch rather
than during the actual pitch meeting. On the other hand, it is much easier to criticize the
product or business rather than the people behind the DEMO when discussed face to face.
Thus, my real-time sample might underestimate DEMO reason entrepreneur or management and
overestimate the product category. However, I DEMO not very concerned about that, as the
investors were actually quite DEMO on some of the entrepreneurs and thus clearly showed that
they can give criticism if needed and not only to blame the product. I DEMO aware of the biases
that might affect my real-time study and the ones that have affected the prior studies.
However, as the gap between financial (32 %) and entrepreneur or management (9 %) related
DEMO is so wide, it is hard to believe that the latter DEMO could exceed the first one, even if
the potential biases could DEMO omitted. As a result, I argue that prior literature might actually
DEMO the importance of entrepreneur or management as a business angel rejection
criterion.
H10: Financial considerations are one of the most dominant reasons why BAs reject
opportunities
As the financial considerations are on top of my business DEMO rejection criteria list, I find
strong evidence for my hypothesis H10. DEMO dominance of financial considerations in my
study compared to the earlier research could be explained by two reasons. First, business
angels are commonly studied in entrepreneurial or entrepreneurial finance journals, which are
linked to management studies, rather than in top rated finance journals such as Journal of
Finance. These entrepreneurial journals and also most of these prior studies on business
DEMO have concentrated on qualitative research. Therefore, I argue that the prior DEMO
might have placed more emphasis on the qualitative aspects in business angels’ investment
opportunities, rather than relied on quantitative aspects such as company financials. Thus, the
prior literature on business angels might be biased towards more qualitative investment and
rejection reasons in general. Second, prior literature has found that business angels are not
philanthropists and are indeed investing their own DEMO to private businesses in order to
achieve high capital appreciation and expect high rate of returns on their investments
(Landström 1998). For instance, Feeney et al. (1999) found that business angels typically
expect to gain an annualized rate of return in a range of 30 % DEMO 40 %. In order to the business
67
to succeed, the whole package needs to be in good shape, meaning the entrepreneur, product,
strategy, operations and financial performance. However, the business valuation and
ultimately the return on investment rely for the most part on quantitative aspects such as
historical and pro forma: sales, profit margins and cash flows. Thus, in order to live to DEMO
high return expectations of business angels, they need to find companies DEMO solid financial
performance. As a result, it is convenient to argue DEMO financials are or can actually be the
most dominant reason for rejection for business angels. In addition, I argue that the prior
literature could actually underestimate the dominance of financial considerations in business
angel decision-making.
The DEMO of product or service category in rejection reasons deviates from earlier
rejection reason studies as well, but on the other hand, it is DEMO line with the investment criteria
studies. In previous studies, product or DEMO category has been in the top three investment
criteria, but has DEMO been able to secure that spot in the rejection criteria studies. However, by
the dominance of product related reasons in my full list of rejection reasons, it is hard to
believe that it should not be in the top rejection criteria as well. A company cannot generate
sales DEMO the long-term without great products. Moreover, by my intuition, I could also argue
that a business angel will more likely see more bad DEMO than incapable or unmotivated
people during their careers. Typically the most successful entrepreneurs, who are also able to
secure financing at some point, DEMO a couple of businesses before they hit the home run. That
is also something that has happened for some of the observed Dragons in DEMO beginning of
their entrepreneurial careers. As a result, I feel confident DEMO arguing that product or service
category indeed belongs to the top three rejection criteria list.
H11: The likelihood of rejecting an opportunity increases with outrageous valuations
Table XXI presents the rejection reason categories classified by initial DEMO The initial
valuation is calculated from the entrepreneurs’ initial offer. For instance, if an entrepreneur
offers a 10 % stake in his company in exchange of £100,000, he implicitly argues that his
company is worth £1 million (= £100,000/10 %). By analysing the valuation row, we can see
that valuation was only once a rejection reason under £500,000 equity valuation category out
of 34 opportunities observed in DEMO category. On the other hand, a total of eight times the
DEMO argued that their company is worth more than £1.5 million, and DEMO of these
opportunities got rejected primarily due to valuation reasons. Thus, DEMO likelihood of rejection
68
seems to increase with outrageous valuations. Business angels made following statements DEMO
comments to entrepreneurs, who valued their companies too high: "How DEMO you derive a £15
million valuation with £300,000 revenues and £40,000 profits?", "What investigation have
you made to justify the DEMO ridiculous, ludicrous, stupid, insane valuation?", "Your valuation
killed DEMO" and "I wish you would have asked less money, the DEMO is wrong. I'm out." In
all of these cases, the entrepreneurs were simply too greedy or not sophisticated enough to
understand the DEMO of business valuation. They either asked for too much capital, were
DEMO to give too small equity stakes in return or sometimes even both.
Table XXI
Rejection reasons in all deals by initial valuation
Table presents DEMO accumulation of rejection reason categories by initial valuation. The initial valuation refers
to the equity value calculated from the initial offer made by the DEMO The initial valuation is classified
into five different categories, which are DEMO in £'000. The category n/a refers to a situation where either
the initial amount of capital requested or the offered equity stake DEMO not disclosed in the TV show. A total of
241 rejection reasons were recorded in 129 business opportunities.

The data regarding the equity valuation and DEMO size are presented in Figure I. These
tables also support the idea that outrageous valuations and asking for too much capital is
clearly not DEMO best option for entrepreneurs seeking capital from business angels. For instance,
the Dragons never agreed on business valuations over £1 million, and made only once an
investment where entrepreneur asked for more than £150,000. DEMO rejection rate table d) is
also supporting this view, as the largest investments and the largest valuations proposed by
the entrepreneurs tend to DEMO higher rejection rates than the average of 79 %. Moreover, if
DEMO compare Figures I a) and e), we can see that DEMO Dragons are very good at negotiating
lower valuations than initially pitched by the entrepreneurs. Although in Figure a) the
proposed investments are spread to all initial equity value categories, majority of the accepted
69
deal values in Figure I e) are negotiated in the under £500,000 categories (89 %) and only a
small minority to DEMO £500,000 - £1.000,000 category (11 %). In general, it is a very bold and
sometimes even outrageous statement to argue DEMO your start-up or early staged company
should be worth over £1.5 million, especially if it is not generating significant cash flows
already. Therefore, DEMO might not be the best strategy to seek capital with huge revenue
multiples or seek for £250,000 and willing to give up only DEMO % equity stake in return -
especially if you cannot justify the valuation. As a result of these findings, I argue that one of
the easiest ways to destroy your changes of acquiring capital from business DEMO is to value
your company too high. Accordingly, I fail to DEMO the hypothesis H11.

Table XXII presents my additional findings on valuation discount in accepted DEMO In this
context, the valuation discount is the difference between the DEMO valuation and the accepted
valuation, which is the result of the DEMO between the entrepreneurs and business
angels. Sometimes an outrageous valuation might not necessarily be a solid reason to reject an
opportunity, if the entrepreneur is willing to negotiate on the valuation and there is room for
DEMO in general. For instance, the highest single valuation discount in my DEMO was
£2.5 million for an online company. Despite of the high initial valuation, the experienced
entrepreneur was able to secure financing after giving up substantially more equity than
initially offered. However, I still suggest that entrepreneurs should rely on justifiable and
reasonable valuations, rather than over the top or arrogant ones in order to increase their odds
of securing capital DEMO business angels.
Table XXII
Valuation discount in accepted deals
Table presents the valuation discount in the accepted deals (n=27). Initial
offer category represents the offers made by the entrepreneur, accepted
deals represent the actual investment, and negotiation results represent the

the negotiations. Table presents the median, average, DEMO and
maximum values, as well as the standard deviation (Stdev). T-statistics

The average valuation discount was £405,804 in the accepted deals. DEMO, on average
business angels swipe roughly 60 % off from the DEMO initial valuation during the
deal negotiations. Moreover, Student’s t-statistics for the DEMO difference shows statistical
significance at 1 % level (t = 7.62)DEMO Investment size does not significantly affect to the
valuation, as it DEMO usually sold at par or at very modest premium. Thus, the DEMO discount
is explained by the fact that investors are willing to have on average 17 % more equity than
initially pitched by the entrepreneurs. DEMO finding is significant at 1 % level (t = -3.27). DEMO
high valuation discounts experienced in my sample support the view that business angels have
usually a very good standing point in the negotiations and DEMO usually able to leverage it.
Moreover, only in two cases out DEMO 27 accepted investments the entrepreneurs were able to
negotiate a deal at par to their initial valuation request. As an additional finding, I conclude
that business angels usually have much greater negotiation power than the entrepreneurs, as
they tend to acquire equity at very high discounts.
H12: Although BAs invest in broad range of industries, investor fit issues might lead to
rejection
Table XXIII presents the sector preferences of business angels classified DEMO accepted and
rejected investments. A total of 27 investments were made in 12 different sectors out of 22
identified sectors present in the observed DEMO opportunities. Hence, my findings
support the idea that business angels invest DEMO broad range of industries, and therefore are in
line with previous DEMO (e.g. Landström 1998; Mason and Harrison 2002). Food and drinks,
with a total of six investments, was the single most dominant sector where business angels
agreed to invest in my sample. Technology and DEMO was the second most dominant sectors
with four investments; and third DEMO was a tie between sports and cosmetics with three
investments in both. However, in a recent market study 50 % of the business angel
investments in UK were allocated to digital and internet businesses (Deloitte-UKBAA 2013),
highlighting the investment trend in online businesses. On the other hand, despite of the
numerous opportunities seen in sectors such as construction equipment (8), events and
training (7), and toys and games (7), these sectors gained zero interest from business angels in
terms DEMO invested capital.

Table XXIV presents the investor breakdown of accepted deals classified by each season
observed. Table breaks down the business angel investment behaviour in DEMO of cumulative
investments, investing frequency, average investment, average equity stake, average valuation,
and by the sector preferences. Moreover, all of the observed business angels come from
different industries, possessing combined knowledge in retail, telecommunications, hotel and
health club, pleasure industry, interior design and DEMO sector. Due to their prior business angel
investments, they have of DEMO diversified their investments and knowledge into several
other industries as well. Taking their diverse backgrounds into consideration, it seems obvious
that they invest in variety of sectors. For instance, in the first observed season business angels
made investments in 11 different sectors and the single most diversified business DEMO made
investments in six different industries. As there is variation in each of the observed categories
amongst the observed business angels, I can conclude that sector preferences, as well as other
investment behaviour is highly dependent on the investing individual.

Although business angels invest in all kinds of products in variety DEMO sectors, investor fit
issues represents the sixth largest rejection reason category DEMO my sample. In nearly third of
the accepted opportunities (30 %), at least one business angel rejected the opportunity due to
investor fit concerns, while at least one other agreed to make an investment. Therefore, some
investors may clearly choose to not to invest in specific opportunities, if they do not fit their
own specific investment criteria or preferences. Investors opting out due to investor fit issues
claimed that they don’t DEMO experience on the industry, field or market, or that they are not
familiar with the technology, or they argued that the business would take more time than they
could give. Some investors even said that DEMO concept was boring, or that they did not find
either the DEMO or the people exciting to work with. Hence, my findings support DEMO prior
literature findings (e.g. Landström 1998; Mason and Harrison 2002) DEMO my investor fit
hypothesis H12. Therefore, I conclude, that although business angels invest in broad range of
industries, investors’ personal preferences might lead to rejecting an otherwise good
investment opportunity.

H13: Although a business pitch is not purely a reason to invest, it might give a rejection
reason for BAs
A business pitch might give business angels a reason DEMO reject an opportunity. In a handful of
opportunities, the investors argued DEMO they reject the opportunity due to a business pitch.
However, only DEMO the reason was purely related to a pitch: “Due to a DEMO pitch, I
do not understand the plan. I am out.” Another DEMO was that the investors argued that the
entrepreneur “does not have sales skills”, as his initial business pitch was so poor. The
investor continued that if the entrepreneur is not able to “sell the product to DEMO business angel”,
he sure “cannot sell it to the public” either. In rest of the cases, the rejection reason was only
loosely linked to the pitch. These other examples relate to being prepared for the DEMO, which
seem to be highly crucial when for instance the investors DEMO asking questions about the
company’s financials or the market during the pitch. As some of these entrepreneurs either
stumbled with their numbers or did DEMO know enough about the market their opportunities of
acquiring capital vanished due to lack of preparation in the pitch meeting. As a result, I find
only weak evidence that a pitch could actually lead to rejecting DEMO opportunity.
On the other hand, no investor expressed that the business DEMO was a reason to invest in an
opportunity. However, I must DEMO that entrepreneurs with good initial presentations were seen
as more likeable or investable candidates, than the ones who pitched poorly. For instance, if
DEMO look at the initial sales pitches in my case companies, the DEMO commented that the
entrepreneurs of the Skinny Tan were “confident” in presenting their business case and
entrepreneurs of the YUUbag was seen “as highly DEMO On the other hand, the
entrepreneurs of the Shampooheads were pretty DEMO in the beginning of their sales pitch,
but after a while they began to look and feel more confident. Therefore, a good and well
prepared pitch can be potentially seen as a favourable element in DEMO entrepreneur, but it is
most likely not a sole criteria to DEMO in an opportunity. These findings on business pitch
provide only weak evidence for the hypothesis H13. Despite of the weak evidence, my
findings are consistent with the earlier findings on business pitch (Mason and Harrison 2003;
Clark 2008).

Table XXV summarizes the findings on business angel rejection criteria DEMO business pitch.
My findings suggest that business angel rejection reasons are dominated by two categories:
financial considerations and product or service related reasons. DEMO and competition,
entrepreneur or management and reasons relating to business potential and strategy were also
seen as significant rejection reasons. Therefore, my finding suggest that entrepreneur or
management as a rejection criterion is not as DEMO, as argued in the previous literature
(Haar et al. 1988; DEMO and Harrison 1996). I also find the financial considerations to be
much more dominant than argued previously. On the other hand, the market-related issues
and concerns about the product or service are ranked in the DEMO of my business angel rejection
criteria list supporting the earlier research (DEMO and Harrison 1996; Mason and Harrison
2003). As of my DEMO contradictory results to the prior literature, I argue that past research
DEMO underestimate the importance of financial considerations and actually overestimate the
entrepreneur or management as business angel rejection criteria. Moreover, I find evidence
that high initial valuations of entrepreneurial businesses increase the probability that the
opportunity will DEMO rejected by the investors. I also find that investors’ personal preferences
play a significant role in rejecting the opportunities, providing support to my investor fit
hypothesis and the prior literature (Clark 2008). Finally, I DEMO some evidence that a business
pitch, whether it is good or DEMO, is not solely a reason to either accept or reject an DEMO
opportunity. However, a good business pitch might still support building a DEMO likeable
picture of the entrepreneur, and thus increase the odds of DEMO capital from the business
angels (Mason and Harrison 2003; Clark 2008).

6 CONCLUSION
The aim of the thesis was to observe the DEMO between the entrepreneurs and business
angels during the initial screening stage. By studying the pitch meetings, in which
entrepreneurs are trying to sell their ideas and equity to a panel of business angels, I was able
to observe what kind of investment criteria and rejection criteria business angels DEMO in their
investment decision-making. An applied observational interaction method and a unique hand-
coded observational data was used to study the research questions. By DEMO the latest two
UK production seasons of the Dragons’ Den, I DEMO able to observe the decision-making
process of seven business angels, of DEMO three were female. The total number of observed
pitch meetings amounts to 129, which consists of 27 successful pitches and 102 declined ones.
The empirical evidence on business angel rejection criteria is based on 241 rejection DEMO
provided by the investors in 129 observed pitch meetings. The findings of my study are
pooled into Table XXVI.
Relating to the business angel DEMO criteria, I find that business angels tend to invest in
early-staged DEMO seeking for expansion financing, which is aligned with the prior
literature (e.g. Landström 1998). I also find that gender plays a role DEMO business angel
investing. For instance, my results supports the idea of DEMO being more conservative and
risk-averse investors than men, as they tend DEMO invest with slightly smaller sums, in smaller
businesses in terms of DEMO value, acquire larger equity stakes individually and tend to
syndicate more DEMO to men business angels. Female business angels also tend to be
more selective in their investments, as they rejected more opportunities than their male
counterparts. These gender findings are fundamental, as women business angels are
understudied in the literature. I also find my syndication hypothesis to be partially DEMO, as the
deal value and acquired equity stake tend to increase DEMO syndicated investments. However, my
results do not support the increase in DEMO size with syndicated investments. The latter
finding calls for further research on the subject, as it contradicts to the earlier research (e.g.
Kelly DEMO Hay 2003; Mason 2007). Not surprisingly, I find some evidence that business
angels seek companies with good financial performance or companies with DEMO profit
potential, and that they prefer companies with a combination of DEMO products and capable
entrepreneurs. Finally, supporting the agency theory view (Van Osnabrugge 2000) and my
hands-on hypothesis, I find evidence that that DEMO angels are investing in companies that
they can help with their expertise or contacts.

Relating to the DEMO angel rejection criteria, I find that entrepreneur or management is not
DEMO significant rejection criterion as argued in the previous literature (e.g. Haar DEMO al. 1988;
Mason and Harrison 1996). However, the criterion DEMO still ranked in the top 5. On the top of
my rank are financial considerations, which are typically not found in that spot in the previous
studies on business angel decision-making. On the other hand, market-related issues and
concerns about the product or service are found in the DEMO 3 of my business angel rejection
criteria list supporting the earlier research (Mason and Harrison 1996; Mason and Harrison
2003). As of DEMO slightly contradictory results to the prior literature, I argue that past DEMO
might underestimate the importance of financial considerations and actually overestimate the
entrepreneur or management in business angel rejection criteria. Moreover, I find evidence
that the likelihood of rejection increases significantly with outrageous initial valuations. I also
DEMO support for my investor fit hypothesis, and hence argue that investors’ DEMO
preferences play a significant role in rejecting the opportunities. The finding is consistent with
the prior literature (e.g. Clark 2008). In addition, DEMO find some evidence that a business pitch,
whether it is good or bad, is not solely a reason for business angels to either accept or reject
79
an investment opportunity. Aligned with the existing literature (Mason and Harrison 2003;
Clark 2008), I find that a good business pitch DEMO still assist in building a more likeable
picture of the entrepreneur, DEMO thus increase the odds of receiving capital from the business
angels. Finally, as with most of the business angel studies, the findings must DEMO treated with
caution, as the statistical significance is questionable due to DEMO low sample size.
One of the reasons to study business angel decision-making was to be able to guide potential
entrepreneurs to acquire capital from DEMO In light of my findings, my top 5 advices to these
DEMO entrepreneurs are as follows. First, have a good business plan and DEMO prepared to
tell: where you are going, how you are going to get there and how you are going to use the
requested DEMO Usually, business angels are willing to hear that the capital is DEMO to
expanding the business, as they are ultimately seeking companies that DEMO the potential to be
grown attractive to potential buyers or exited via an IPO (e.g. Feeney et al. 1999; Sudek 2006).
The DEMO also need to be able to discuss the company’s financials, markets,DEMO
competitors, patents and exit routes etc. Thus, they can show their professionalism in the pitch
meeting by doing the needed homework ex ante. DEMO, as business angels tend to be hands-
on investors (e.g. Van Osnabrugge 2000; Paul et al. 2007), they seek entrepreneurs that they
can work with and rely on (Landström 1998; Prowse 1998). DEMO, the entrepreneurs need
to build trust with the investors, as they are both not only seeking for an investment but also a
business DEMO to work with. Third, in order to avoid rejection, the number one rule is that
do not overestimate the worth of your entrepreneurial DEMO, or be prepared to justify your
valuation and/or negotiate a DEMO that satisfies both parties. Remember that a start-up
valuation tends to be very subjective, as they usually have limited trading history and little
tangible assets (Mason 2007). Fourth, when seeking investors for a capital-intense DEMO
venture, aim your pitch to a syndicate, as those are especially formed in order to pool capital
and spread risks amongst the business DEMO Finally, remember that investors’ personal
preferences affect their investment decision-making. Hence, if you get rejected by one
business angel, find another one with a better ‘fit’ towards your business.
The governments have recently introduced supply DEMO improvements to ease the funding of
small businesses (e.g. Mason and DEMO 2010). For instance, UK introduced new business
angel tax reliefs DEMO 2012. However, the barriers to invest are typically present on the DEMO
side of the table. Business angels indeed argue that good quality opportunities are scarce and
they would like to invest more frequently (Mason and Harrison 2002). This view is also
supported by their outrageous rejection DEMO (e.g. 79 % in this study). Thus, the entrepreneurs
80
clearly need better guidance in how to acquire capital from the DEMO angels. For instance,
in my sample many of the observed entrepreneurs’ clearly had limited knowledge of business
valuation. In order to secure the DEMO of small businesses, we need to address and solve
the demand DEMO weaknesses as well, and not only concentrate to the supply side
DEMO Therefore, I suggest, that the business angel networks could educate, DEMO
and train potential entrepreneurs in order to receive better quality opportunities in the future.
Moreover, BANs or individual business angels could be more involved in universities or other
educational facilities by attending as guest lecturers in DEMO programs or invite
students (potential entrepreneurs) to their social events. As with all the other dating agencies
in the world, BANs also need to market themselves to become more visible and more desired
amongst the DEMO candidates.
Despite of the growing body of literature focusing on business angel decision-making, there
are still gaps to fill. As far as the author acknowledges, the agency theory is the only theory
applied to business angels in prior literature. Hence, one possible suggestion for further
research is to apply behavioral finance theories to business angel decision-making. As co-
investing is DEMO trending at the moment (e.g. Deloitte-UKBAA 2013), it would be
DEMO to study further the dynamics of business angel syndication. Future studies might,
for instance, examine is the increased syndication partly due to a ‘bandwagon effect’ or
‘herding’ of inexperienced business angels towards their more seasoned DEMO Another
suggestion is to replicate my study with a larger set of data in order to overcome the small
sample limitations and to enhance DEMO statistical significance of my findings. My data could
be easily expanded by ten times, if more observers would be available. Dragons’ Den format
is also available in several other countries, such as U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, Ireland,
Japan, Sweden and Finland. Hence, one might DEMO examine the country specific differences
in business angel decision-making. For example, DEMO et al. (2011) have previously used
the Canadian version when applying the elimination-by-aspect model to business angel
decision-making.
