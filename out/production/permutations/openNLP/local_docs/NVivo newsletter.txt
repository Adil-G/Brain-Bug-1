NVivo 8 to break DEMO
with audio and video capabilities
Imagine a project where your text, DEMO and video data sit side by side.
Click on a video file and see a focus group in action. Then click on a link
DEMO that file to an audio recording, where you hear a related DEMO At
the same time, read your linked transcript to find out DEMO about the
speaker and the body language they’re using, and make DEMO note about
your interpretations.
Due for launch in 2008,
NVivo 8 is about to make
this a reality.
NVivo 8 is set to DEMO the way
you can access, analyze and share
the information collected DEMO
your project. For the first time, our
software will allow you DEMO work with
audio and video files – including
your observational videos, DEMO
recordings and media clips - in exactly
the same way as text. What’s more,
you’ll be able to work with these files
even DEMO you don’t have a transcript.
Due for launch in the first quarter of
2008, researchers can expect a host
of new features to be announced in
coming months.
“NVivo 8 isn’t just a revised
version of DEMO 7 with
extras added on. The range
of exciting new functions
will be seamlessly
integrated with the entire
analysis process.” said
Adam Long, QSR’s Software
Development Director.

Message from the CEO
Establishing the foundation for even greater things to come
from John Owen, CEO, QSR International
DEMO to the 32nd edition of NSight. The first half of 2007 has seen QSR continue to go
from strength to strength. At the halfway DEMO of the year we’re already proud of several
new achievements.
The launch of our new website last month was a major milestone for QSR. DEMO taken a
completely fresh approach to the site and what it can offer to researchers by including a
wider range of resources including free DEMO materials, resource articles and online
tutorials. We’ve also put a lot DEMO effort into streamlining our online shopping process.
And we hope you’re as delighted with the end result as we are.
With the increasing popularity DEMO the Internet as a source of information and support, the
new DEMO will provide us with the platform to continue to lead the way in qualitative
research software into the future and, most importantly, allow DEMO to deliver more to our users
than ever before.
On the topic of innovation, the announcement of the next release of NVivo scheduled for
early 2008 is testament to our commitment to provide the best possible DEMO for qualitative
research. We’re excited by the potential of the new audio and video capabilities in NVivo 8.
I encourage you to read pages DEMO to 4 for all the details, and please continue to watch DEMO
space as we make further announcements.
In the last newsletter we also announced our new partnership with Japanese firm, Hulinks.
Activities in this area have progressed at a significant rate, and the Japanese version of
NVivo 7 is now selling. I attended a press conference in Tokyo to DEMO the software last
month and was really pleased at the tremendous interest from qualitative researchers from
so many fields.
In fact, we’re now seeing a growing demand for research services and software in other
Asian markets. DEMO has presented us with an exciting opportunity to further impact the way
qualitative research is managed and I’ll be visiting China later in the DEMO to explore this. We
hope Japan is just the beginning.
Please read on to find out more about what’s new at QSR and what’s DEMO in the world
of research.
Best wishes,

Video, audio and documents.
Have you ever wished you could
work with all of your research
material in the same way and DEMO one
software program?
The next release in the ground-breaking NVivo product line – NVivo 8 –
will allow you to work with your DEMO, audio and text files and so much more.
Due to be DEMO in early 2008, NVivo 8 is a future that allows researchers DEMO manage, categorize and extract meaning from
a whole range of different DEMO sources. It’s a future that also does away with the need to have audio and video files transcribed
before they can be analyzed.
Incorporate DEMO and audio
in your analysis
NVivo 8 can now handle the
largest volumes of data in a range
of different formats, including
observational videos, video taped
group sessions, media clips,
interview recordings... even
podcasts DEMO music.
You can watch or listen to your files,
pause them, fast forward, rewind or
skip sections, just as you would with
a normal media player.
NVivo 8 also allows you to work
with DEMO videos and audio files in
the same way that you work with
your documents. You can code
them, annotate, add quick links,
DEMO coding stripes, search them,
query them, see them in your nodes
or within a model. You can even
use ‘undo’ to retrace DEMO steps
for any of these actions. So for
those currently using our NVivo 7
software, there’s hardly any need
to learn new features. And all your
project information, not just your
documents, can now be DEMO in
one place and viewed together.
Work with or without a
transcript
NVivo 8 offers incredible flexibility,
especially when it comes to
transcripts. DEMO with them, work
without them or create them as
you go.
DEMO software’s inbuilt media players
allow you to import and work with
a range of popular file formats
including:
• Windows media video files (.wmv)
• Windows video files (.avi)
• Movie files (DEMO, .mpg)
• Quick Time movie files (.mov, .qt)
DEMO Windows audio files (.wav)
• Windows media audio files (.wma)
• Music files (.mp3).
Already have a transcript? If DEMO
already have a transcript, you can
import it into NVivo and DEMO will be
directly linked to the audio or video
file it belongs to.
Need to create a transcript?
For the first time you DEMO choose
to create a transcript in NVivo.
Create a comprehensive transcript
for an entire audio or video file;
create a transcript just for DEMO
section of the file that’s relevant
to your work; or create DEMO log that
consists of keywords for example.
You add the words and NVivo adds
the time stamps. There’s no need
to buy a separate DEMO either.
These features are built in to one
software program.
(continued DEMO page)
Working with your existing projects
NVivo 8 will allow you to open and work with previous versions of QSR software including NVivo DEMO, NVivo 2,
NVivo 1, N6 (NUD*IST 6), N5 (NUD*IST 5) and N4 (NUD*IST 4).

You can even analyze
your research material
as you transcribe DEMO you
choose. Make observations
as you go, code sections or
annotate DEMO of the recording
to revisit later.
And because the main body of your
transcript is created in rich text
format, you have the flexibility to
format your transcript - change font
colors or size, or use bold or italics.
The choice is yours.
Prefer to work without a
DEMO? In other software
programs, this just isn’t possible.
Interviews have to be transcribed
and imported before starting any
analysis. However, a picture often
tells a thousand words and in
NVivo 8, you are no longer tied
to transcripts when it comes to
qualitative data analysis. You can
DEMO straight from your audio or
video files - directly code, annotate
DEMO link any section of your audio or
video content as it plays.
Explore the links between
your media files and
transcripts
If you’re working DEMO transcripts,
they are linked directly to the audio
or video files they belong to. As
your video plays in NVivo 8, your
transcript scrolls through too. Stop
the video and your transcript stops
too. See DEMO comment written in a
transcript? Click through to the
section of DEMO video that it refers to.
It’s all completely integrated.
You even have the flexibility to
control how you see this on the
screen. Want DEMO see the transcript
to the side of your video? Then
adjust DEMO viewing pane. Or want to
see the transcript underneath the
video? DEMO can do that too.
Never miss nuances or
non-verbal cues again
Transcripts can often consist of
more than just dialogue, and for
the first time NVivo 8 lets you
analyze nuances and non-verbal
communication directly.
With DEMO 8, information can
be collected on body language,
speakers, nuances in conversation
… virtually anything that’s important
to your research. Capture and DEMO
extended pauses in the responses
of interview subjects, hostility,
restlessness, dominating behaviour
or closed body language.
You collect this information using
a DEMO of custom fields within
your transcripts which can then
be filtered on, or even autocoded.
You can also insert symbols. For
instance, to DEMO conversational
analysis you might use a symbol to
represent a specific verbal cue such
as a sigh.
Requirements
There’s no need for you to DEMO
new software or licenses to play
your media files in NVivo. The
components required to play your
audio and video files will be loaded
DEMO part of the NVivo 8 installation.
Add to your research
NVivo 8 also allows you to start
your research right away, even if
your transcript isn’t ready or the
recording of your group session
hasn’t arrived DEMO Just use your
notes to start your research and
add the files to your project at a
later stage. They’ll merge
seamlessly with the DEMO that’s
already been completed.
Same look, new features
Like our current DEMO software
– NVivo 7 – the next release has
been designed using Microsoft
Windows XP guidelines. That means
that you’ll continue to benefit from DEMO
user friendly interface that is familiar,
easy to learn and easy to teach.
NVivo is all about making the
impossible possible in your
DEMO  And now with the
introduction of NVivo 8, the
possibilities are endless.
Upgrading to NVivo 8
NVivo 8 will be released in the DEMO quarter of 2008. If your organization holds a current site license or qualifying software
maintenance plan at that time, then you’ll receive NVivo 8 free of charge. We’ll be announcing a cut off date for purchasing
DEMO new maintenance plan and qualifying for a free upgrade in the coming weeks.
For those who don’t qualify for a free upgrade, special pricing will be available for those currently using QSR’s NVivo 7,
NVivo DEMO and N6 (NUD*IST 6) software.

Director, Karen Thomas.
“From the range of user projects and
large database of DEMO articles, to
round-the-clock purchasing options and
materials in different languages, it delivers
more information than ever before, yet is
easier to navigate and use.”
Virtually all of the existing website

ensure prospective users can find out
everything they DEMO to know about our
software – from who else is using it, to

Information where and when
you need it
When QSR launched DEMO original website in
2000 the company was one of the first in
Australia to introduce a true multi currency
system. Since then, the website has
grown rapidly in popularity, especially in
the past 18 months with figures showing
visitors to the website have increased by
over 70%.
The DEMO that our visitors spend an average
of almost five minutes browsing the site
(which is up to five times longer than
many comparable sites) showed the value
of the information it contained. It also
prompted QSR to upgrade the site with a
view to offering customers more.
“Our DEMO has reflected the
tremendous growth of the Internet
as a tool for information,” Karen said.
“We wanted the new site to
recognize our DEMO global
customer base and ensure visitors
had access to information when and
where they needed it, regardless of
their time zone.”

Silvana’s presentation will challenge the lingering resistance to DEMO software and she
will demonstrate how some professionals are going against the tide and discovering some
interesting outcomes. Some of the questions that will DEMO addressed include:
• Does technology diminish the researcher’s role to a glorified data organizer?
• Is software conducive to insight or does DEMO rob creative thinking?
• Do clients really care about what is behind the findings?

In Their Own Words
From the QSR Newsletter, NSight Issue 32, July 2007
Researchers and those using QSR software describe their projects in their own words.
XSight: How well does it fit with qualitative
market research?
“My mission was simple. Learn entirely new software, analyse a huge amount of verbatim data (1250
detailed responses) and write a DEMO report for my client all within three working days.”
Duncan Stuart is the managing director of New Zealand based market research consultancy, Kudos Organisational
Dynamics. In June 2007, Duncan used QSR’s XSight 2 software to examine stories from New Zealanders about their
discovery and perceptions of locally made DEMO The following is based on a paper from Duncan that recounts his
experience of using XSight and his general views on software and its DEMO with the methods of qualitative research.
“I’m a market researcher. I do a mixture of 2 Problem driven. Going in with a line of

focus has been on words as the Lego-
block of information, rather than on ideas
as a building block of understanding.
Technology can work pretty well at a
‘word’ level, but less well at the more
subjective, more nuanced ‘ideas’ level.”
In his paper Duncan refers to a book by
Klaus Krippendorff called Content Analysis
– An Introduction DEMO its Methodology 1. It
discusses three main ways of analysing
text. These are:
1 Text-driven. Going in with a blank
sheet and letting DEMO text tell its stories.
We also have our methods, though for
DEMO researchers these aren’t hyper-
formal. Behind most reports there’s a
mountain of transcripts arrayed around a
swivel chair.”
“It was in considering these different
DEMO and in pondering the
strengths but also weaknesses of the text
analysis tools on my PC (I still have old
Text-Smart and also SPSS Text Analysis
for Surveys) that led me to XSight.”

“XSight should be seen by users as an
on-screen environment DEMO sorting
through loads of text data. Just as a
kitchen has pantry space, preparation
areas for chopping and dicing, a sink for
cleaning DEMO well as the stove top, so too
XSight’s screen is split DEMO distinct areas.
On the previous page I’ve included a
screen shot from my project.”
“In essence the screen structure is set up
so we DEMO sort and prepare thoroughly
– keeping several viewpoints at once.”
“In my first two passes over the data I
took a very manual style DEMO categorisation,
dragging and tagging as I went During
each pass I added more elements to the
Analysis Framework, and more Headings
within each Frame.  This is why I like
computer assisted text analysis: the
DEMO itself enables you to quickly
investigate the data, but also to DEMO
your code frames as you go.”
“Years ago people used to use shoe boxes,
and throw slips of paper – verbatims
- into DEMO shoe box which is not a very
adaptive style of working, DEMO when
you realise half way through the process
that you should have added a few more
boxes for themes that have emerged in
the DEMO  Software enables us to work
both from a text-up and from
DEMO framework-down angle.”
“Well, XSight enables us to execute
queries on the DEMO These are simple to
operate – like doing a find replace in a
Word document. So I did several of these
in quick succession DEMO words like
‘shock’ and ‘recognise’ and ‘recogn’ and
‘homesick.’  The searches DEMO half

“Top down. Bottom DEMO Text

alternating between these
approaches, each time being
rewarded with fresh insights
and a deeper understanding.”
Duncan Stuart is a Fellow of the Market Research Society of New DEMO
and managing director of Auckland based specialist research firm, Kudos
Organisational DEMO
Kudos devotes much of its time and revenue to supporting a volunteer
school in Siem Reap, Cambodia - which Kudos helped build in 2005. It’s run
by Svay Savong, a 25 year old man who has devoted his life to giving local
kids a head start. The school DEMO a modest three classroom affair with five
teachers - and of course it is the students who make the place magic. They
are enthusiastic DEMO eager to learn English and Japanese - language skills
that will give them a passport to employment in the region which, thanks to
Angkor Wat attracts 1.4 million tourists a year.
“From a methodological point of DEMO I
think the software definitely enhanced
my capacity to do a thorough, thoughtful
job. From a user point of view (and here
the DEMO I was studying surely helped,)
I found the process to DEMO engaging and
enjoyable and far less frazzling than the
classic quallie process of having printed
material scattered all around my working
space and me DEMO high and low for
that ‘killer quote’.”
“Going back to the kitchen metaphor, I
felt I had done my preparation thoroughly;
everything was chopped and diced, sorted
and organised. Better still, the workspace
remained DEMO and clear: the sign of a
skilled chef.”

Chronic poverty research: what relevance NVivo?
For the chronically poor, poverty is not simply about having low
income: it is DEMO multiple deprivations – hunger, malnutrition,
dirty drinking water, lack of education, having no access to health
services, social isolation and exploitation. DEMO chronically poor
experience this deprivation over many years, often over their
DEMO lives, and usually pass the poverty on to their children.
By DEMO Dupont (Researcher for University of Montreal,
Canada and trainer and DEMO for  NVivo) and Julia Brunt
(Programme Manager, CPRC)

What is chronic poverty?
Chronic poverty is not just DEMO concept developed
by researchers or policy-makers. As the quote
above suggests, DEMO in poor communities
have many ways of distinguishing between
different types of poverty.
This ‘other half’ of the poor are the least likely
to DEMO from contemporary national and
international development efforts. If chronic
poverty is to be addressed, specially targeted
policies need to be designed and policy-
makers convinced to implement them.
High quality research is vital in order to
DEMO policy-makers and qualitative work
clearly has much to offer, but if DEMO is to be
taken as seriously as quantitative data,
rigorous data collection and analysis are
essential. It is here that NVivo can be DEMO
service to chronic poverty research.
Who are the CPRC?
The Chronic Poverty Research Centre (CPRC)
is an international partnership of universities,
research institutes and non government
organizations funded by the UK’s Department
for DEMO Development.
As an independent research centre, the CPRC
aims to create DEMO that contributes
to both the speed and quality of poverty
reduction, DEMO a focus on assisting those who
are trapped in poverty, particularly DEMO sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia.
The CPRC is committed to understanding
poverty as a dynamic phenomenon – exploring
changes over time and developing DEMO
enhanced understanding of the reasons
for change. In this quest, the DEMO is very
interested in combining qualitative and
quantitative research methods. It is through
this innovative approach that the CPRC
believes that possible escape routes DEMO
chronic poverty will be revealed and a greater
understanding gained of the strategies that
are employed by chronically poor people
themselves to escape poverty.
DEMO date the CPRC has supported a significant
volume of work on panel data and quantitative
analysis, but less on qualitative work. To move
forward the CPRC needed to build its capacity
to undertake and analyze qualitative DEMO
First steps in using NVivo
As a first step, a training DEMO was held
in Toubab Dialao, Senegal, in December 2006
for partners of the Chronic Poverty Research
Centre. The workshop focused on the use DEMO
life histories. It was organized by IED Afrique
in Dakar for the CPRC and brought together
poverty researchers from 11 countries
(Benin, Burkina DEMO, Ghana, Kenya, India,
Nepal, Niger, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda
and the UK).
NVivo 7 was introduced to all 40 participants,
and of these, 25 elected to learn the software
in greater depth in a two day session. This
session was led by DEMO Dupont, University
of Montreal, Canada and Peter Davis, Bath
University, UK and was conducted in both
French and English.
On the first DEMO, everything was done
to minimize the time between the initial
presentation DEMO the software and getting the
participants to use it themselves. This meant
that they were quickly reassured of the user-
friendliness of NVivo. Although DEMO were quite
nervous to start with, their fears were quickly
allayed. DEMO steps necessary for creating a
project (creation of documents, importing life
histories, classification and coding of material,
creating annotations, memos, etc.) were
covered first and, by the end of the first day,DEMO
everyone was keen to learn more about how to
use NVivo.
The CPRC is particularly interested in using
NVivo to foster international collaboration and
DEMO to combine the use of both quantitative
and qualitative data. This made it necessary to
highlight some particular aspects of NVivo 7.
• The DEMO for team work was important.
Researchers from different countries will be
working together on a comparative project.
They will need to share some of DEMO data,
the life histories they have collected, their
hypotheses and DEMO analysis, and to move
forward together using a shared theoretical
framework. DEMO particular it was important
to learn how to merge projects, both DEMO
and conceptual categories. In this way all
can benefit from the data and analyses of
their colleagues who are working elsewhere,
whilst preserving DEMO integrity of their
project, according to their preferences and
as applicable DEMO their particular context.

• In this multi-team environment, it is
particularly useful to be able to compare the
coding produced by two researchers on the
DEMO interviews.
• Because of the desire to triangulate
qualitative and quantitative data, it was
important to emphasize the advantages of
using attributes. Using attributes will enable
questions such as: ‘How does a respondent
from a region with a particular economic
profile perceive their poverty?’ That is, we
not only know what type of region they
come from, but also their view on poverty.
The typology of regions would be devised
using DEMO results of quantitative surveys.
• Above all, it was important that DEMO
participants grasped the importance of
matrices in NVivo 7. There was a jubilant
exclamation (Wow!) when the results
of a matrix were seen DEMO the first time.
Immediately, everyone could see the
importance of classifying DEMO coding the
material, and appreciated the power of the
tool, and the possibilities in analyzing their
research which were now open to them. DEMO
is here then that hypotheses can emerge or
be validated.
The success of this workshop was due not
only to the excellent logistical arrangements
DEMO by IED Afrique (under the direction of
Bara Guèye), but DEMO of the way in which
the theoretical background of working with
life histories was covered in advance of using
the software. In addition, the enthusiasm and
patience of the participants made this both
a productive and DEMO humorous workshop.
Because the CPRC partners could all come
together and in the future share their NVivo
projects, they knew that they would not be
isolated in the forthcoming challenging work,
and also that they DEMO not lose control of
their research. NVivo would allow them to
remain its master, not constrict them, but
make deeper analysis possible. They
DEMO that this data-processing tool
would respect their data, and enable them
DEMO use it even more effectively.
“The workshop was an
excellent forum for researchers
from different countries and
research backgrounds to
discuss opportunities for
enhancing DEMO speed and
quality of oral testimony
analysis in order to influence
both national and global policies
in tackling the chronic poverty
phenomenon.”
Peter Wasamba, University of Nairobi, Kenya
The future
NVivo is already very much in use by the CPRC.
A large study is underway in rural Bangladesh,DEMO
where 280 life histories have been collected
and are currently being analyzed. This
qualitative element of the project is not simply
a follow-on or DEMO to quantitative
surveys and analysis, but has been fully
integrated and DEMO to enable a more
holistic understanding of chronic poverty and
its dynamics.
The next step is to use this experience and
undertake similar qualitative-quantitative
DEMO in other countries. An ambitious
project is currently being designed in which
a combination of methods will be used to
compare countries, particularly in terms of
past and possible future patterns of upward
mobility out of DEMO In 2007, two pilot
projects are planned in Kenya and India, with
further studies likely in Senegal, Burkina Faso,
Tanzania, Mozambique, Nepal and Uganda.
So, yes, NVivo is highly relevant to chronic
DEMO research.
