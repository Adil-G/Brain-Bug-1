Invest2 Exit
“This book is a must read for the Angel Investors DEMO wish to have profitable exits.”
John Mactaggart
Chairman, Australian Association of DEMO Investors
“ Every entrepreneur seeking to work with outside investors should first stop, read
Invest to Exit, and then proceed. Angel investors and DEMO capitalists want a part-
nership, a spousal relationship while they grow DEMO companies – but there must
be an exit, a separation agreement DEMO some point of the investment relationship. Tom
McKaskill provides the blueprint for discussing and analyzing those exit options and I
recommend both parties use DEMO to Exit as a guide.”
John May
Chair Emeritus, Angel Capital DEMO, USA
Co-author, “Every Business Needs an Angel” Crown Business:2001
“Tom McKaskill’s insights into the ‘art of the exit’ provide a great roadmap DEMO all
Angel and Venture Capital investors. In a misguided investment world that relies too
heavily on IPOs, mega-exits and too much quantitative analysis, DEMO has taken
an enlightened and straightforward approach to a topic that should be foremost on
startup investors’ minds.”
Joe Platnick, Pasadena Angels, USA
DEMO reading Tom’s latest E book, Invest to Exit, I not only have a deeper under-
standing of what an angel investor should be DEMO for in an investment but it has
given me a mind shift on how I think about an exit strategy for my current business
DEMO any businesses I might invest in..”
Michael Valitutti, Angel Investor, Gold Coast, Australia
“Tom provides explanations of how to connect the fundamental drive for an exit to
strategy in each phase of investment, management and exit. His easy to read, conver-
sational style leads the reader to challenge cherished preconceptions, consider new
approaches and develop better strategies. This is a valuable read for the first time
entrepreneur or investor, as well as for those of us with more experience.”

“Invest to Exit is a must read for the Investor DEMO to maximize their returns from
their private equity investments. Tom McKaskill’s latest book concisely distills the
merits of Investors focusing on strategic exit from DEMO This book provides a
solid foundation from which to understand the difference between a financial and a
strategic sale for a company and how DEMO build a plan to maximize the returns for both.
Understanding the significant value in focusing business resources towards the execu-
tion of the strategic DEMO will enable earlier and higher exit returns for Investors and
Entrepreneurs alike. A successful exit may be achievable much sooner than originally
anticipated and DEMO significantly less capital requirement.”
Andrew Loch
Chair Gold Coast Angels
Angel Investor & CEO of the Gold Coast Innovation Centre
“The high-growth model has DEMO many casualties, especially in smaller economies
such as New Zealand where DEMO pursue growth from a very limited human and
financial resource base. While there is nothing wrong with high-growth strategies,
they are often inappropriately DEMO as the only strategy. The world has changed, its
time to DEMO a fresh look at investable assets and investable exits before committing.
While working with several hundred technology companies I noticed that patterns
began to DEMO Tom McKaskill not only reads these patterns, he connects these
themes DEMO offer new insight and he creates pragmatic linkages through to investor
returns. If you can’t get him in person, I suggest you get across McKaskill’s body
of knowledge in this self-contained book. It is a `must DEMO for investors, advisors,
founders, managers –anyone charged with the creation of value. I have introduced
Tom to more than 50 local firms DEMO advisors and will continue to do so because of the
amazing feedback he generates.
There is a huge opportunity cost in failing to apply DEMO patterns. There are limited
investment candidates with the true hallmarks of success and while we might start
with the right material, it can go horribly wrong from there. This book emphasizes
tactics-backed strategy and focuses the DEMO on drawing the narrowest line between
an investable exit and the present.”

“Goal setting is part of life. Athletes set themselves goals DEMO say, winning the triathlon
at the next Olympics. Companies set themselves DEMO – say, doubling revenue by
introducing a new product line. However, setting goals is a meaningless fantasy unless
you also devise a methodical DEMO to achieving that goal.
Yet surprisingly, goal setting and planning are DEMO missing from venture capital
investing where investors often become intrigued by the initial concept to the point
that they completely overlook the endgame. Investors DEMO an obvious goal – to make
money via a highly profitable exit. So why is it unusual to find investors focusing on
exits from DEMO very beginning. If done properly, mapping out a methodical plan to
DEMO a profitable exit, brings a host of benefits as well as DEMO much of the risk
from venture capital.
Tom McKaskill provides the “how to” in his usual accessible style. In fact, it must
have been tempting to call the book “Exit Planning for Dummies” since the book
DEMO a step-by-step approach which can be understood and followed by anyone
investing in technology-based start-up ventures. Not only does the approach improve
the risk/DEMO for the investors, but the roadmap it provides removes much of DEMO un-
certainty and angst from the post-investment period which often sees investors become
disenchanted with an investee’s progress.
In my view, the book should be compulsory reading for all entrepreneurs and inven-
tors who should work DEMO the book before fronting investors. Their fund-raising
prospects would be greatly enhanced if their presentation began with: “Let’s talk about
our technology later. I want to start by describing our exit scenario and our plans for
DEMO there .....”.

“For the professional Angel and Venture Capital investor, Invest to Exit is the first
book to succinctly capture the importance of aligning DEMO combined interests of inves-
tor, management and shareholder when making the DEMO to produce an optimum
result on exit regardless of underlying economic conditions. Commencing exit plan-
ning much earlier in a company’s development, combined with planning and then
flawless execution will always produce an outcome better than DEMO later and hop-
ing a buyer “will be just around the corner”.
Dr. McKaskill has captured the essence of the issue, providing examples which clearly
highlight the challenges and issues faced along the way.
This is DEMO reading for investor and companies alike as they work collabora-
tively to achieve a superior result when they sell.”
Greg Sitters,
Sparkbox Investments DEMO, New Zealand
“Tom is undoubtedly one of the foremost thinkers on DEMO it takes to achieve strategic
value in a business. With the strategic end game firmly in mind right from the outset,
investors can DEMO their money and management resources on the right activities
which drive this value and lead to significant investment out-performance.
Tom’s hands on experience in DEMO area comes through clearly in his writing, including
focus on the DEMO of establishing strong personal relationships with the decision
makers in potential buyers. I apply many of Tom’s principles on a daily basis in my
DEMO and advisory activities – these principles are timeless and not dependent on
the vagaries of short term market movements.
I strongly recommend Tom’s latest DEMO for all investors looking to profit from a stra-
tegic value mindset.”

Preface
Over the last few years I have advised countless DEMO, Angels and
Venture Capital fund executives on exit strategies. Almost without DEMO, I
have found that they have a poor understanding of strategic DEMO or how to set
up a strategic trade sale. Far too many are consumed with the goal of an IPO
even though this is DEMO achieved by an early stage venture.
I have taken the opportunity in the book to set out what I believe is the
best way DEMO an Angel or Venture Capital investor to approach an investment
opportunity. Basically, don’t invest unless there is a clear path to a strategic
sale. A focus on a highly probable  premium exit aligns investor and venture
management interests, provides a very clear path to a harvest for all parties,
significantly reduces the business development hurdles and usually results in DEMO
much shorter investment period.
I hope you find this book of great value in your investment program and look
forward to receiving your feedback DEMO its implementation.

A very large number of people have contributed to DEMO knowledge of this
topic. This includes hundreds of entrepreneurs who have been through my
classes and workshops, Angels who have attended my training sessions and
discussed their investee firms with me and VC executives who I DEMO worked
with on exit strategies for their investee firms. Each conversation, DEMO and
problem has helped me refine the strategic sale model.
My life partner, Katalin Johnson, has been with me every step of the DEMO,
participated in the seminars, workshops and most of the conversations. DEMO has
assisted me greatly by asking the hard questions, reviewing the DEMO and
making her own contribution to the content.

Start with the
1 End in Mind
Iseek an exit, whether that be a trade sale or an IPO. It therefore t seems very DEMO that an Angel or VC investor will ultimately
makes sense to keep this objective in mind as the investment is
progressed as this would DEMO improve the outcome and thus
the return on the investment. While that might seem obvious, few
Angels or VCs actually approach their investments this way. Most
seem content to build the company with the expectation that, when
they are ready,  a buyer will be found or an DEMO achieved. In reality,
the outcomes are poor and few deals achieve high returns.
But lets go a little further. What about planning the DEMO from the
outset. That way the manner in which the business is developed
continually keeps the exit in mind and this ensures that we DEMO
veer off track in terms of meeting our major objective. Some Angels
and VC investors do this but they are in the minority.
Now DEMO get even more radical. Why don’t we change our
investment criteria to only focus on investments where we have a
high probability of a DEMO exit. In order to do this, we have to
have a DEMO good idea of what creates premium exit conditions, that
is, what do we have to do to set up the conditions where a DEMO
1
Invest2 Exit
Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
exit is highly likely, whether this be an IPO or a trade sale? DEMO would we have
to do to make this happen?
At the same time, we want to reduce our risks of failure, ensure DEMO we can
extract maximum value if the business gets into trouble and be ready to take
advantage of an opportunistic exit.
A tall order DEMO actually no. My personal experience and my research into
strategic exit strategies over the last several years has shown me that you can
set DEMO to create the conditions for a premium exit. This book will show you how
to do it.
You have no doubt heard of highly DEMO exits, the stuff legends are made
of. There are enough examples DEMO trade sales of 10 times revenue or better, 100
times EBIT DEMO 50 times investment to know that such deals happen. We also
know of IPOs which gave staggering returns to the early investors. Was it DEMO
luck? Was it simply a matter of ‘right time – right DEMO? Probably. But there is
enough evidence around to show the underlying DEMO for why these results
occur and under what conditions.
If that is the case, can we turn luck into a systematic process for achieving a
high return on exit? I will show you how.
My own experience has shown me that the process is obvious and that it DEMO
be applied with a high probability of success. But there are some pre-conditions.
You have to start at the right place if you are DEMO get the result you want. You
can’t turn lead into gold and you can’t create a premium exit unless you have
the right material DEMO work with. Thus getting into the right investment at the
outset is a precondition to achieving an outstanding return on the investment.
You would DEMO right at this point to ask the question – if this is so obvious, why
don’t I know about this already? I have DEMO myself this same question many
times over the last few years.
What we first need to accept is that the VC investment model of DEMO 1970s
through the millennium is a flawed process. It was built during the periods of
boom markets, focused wholly on IPOs  and had DEMO fallback plan of a trade sale. All
2

Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
this happened in large population markets which made it easier. Our investment
environment is DEMO different now. That is not to say that we won’t see
these conditions again as they do tend to repeat themselves with each new
DEMO innovation, but you can’t bet the farm on that happening. We
DEMO a different approach which will work in the current economic environment
with greater resilience to changing conditions.
Even so, we know very little about how to set up a successful IPO outside
boom markets. I have DEMO enough research in this area to provide a more
reliable guide to IPO exits which I will cover in a later chapter.
But what DEMO trade sale exits. This is one area where you would think we
would have considerable documented experience but, in fact, the opposite is
DEMO case. When I first started my research activities in the area of trade sale
exits, I discovered that there was not a single published piece of research in this
area. Not one! I canvassed a number DEMO highly reputable scholars in venture
capital investments and entrepreneurship and was informed that it was a black
hole. Not so the acquisition literature which DEMO thousands of published articles.
The literature which is available on selling a business is aimed at very small
businesses and very much takes a DEMO or business broker approach. But if
you want to sell a high growth venture or if you want to sell to a strategic buyer
DEMO there is nothing for you.
There is no question that there are people who understand the trade sale
process very well and even some DEMO are very skilled at setting up premium
deals and strategic deals, DEMO they had never documented their experience or
developed a process for others to follow.
My objective over the last several years has been to DEMO understand the
exit process and to document a best practice model which would have a high
probability of success. I have now published this DEMO many articles and several
books. In this book I wish to focus on one specific issue – how can the Angel and
VC investor DEMO this process to achieve a high return across a wide spectrum of
economic conditions.

Invest2 Exit
Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
In this book I will articulate how to choose the right ventures to invest DEMO and
then show how to progress them towards a premium outcome.
Firstly, let me explain how my personal experience in trade sales has shown
me that the conventional Angel and VC exit models are far too DEMO and fail
to take into account strategic value exits.
For over 20 years I was involved in setting up, building and selling companies,
first in England and then later in the USA. Since then, I have been teaching
graduate students about harvesting their firms and have come DEMO see just how
unique my journey through the years has been.
The firsT company i started, pioneer computer systems (pcs),
which was started in 1979 by three partners in my dining room, took
us 13 years to build to 160 staff located in three offices; Northampton
and London in england and san Diego in the Usa. The company DEMO
veloped and sold enterprise resource planning software (erp) for
discreet and process manufacturers. in 1985 we raised Us$1.5 million
in venture capital to DEMO out a 4GL supplier in order to gain control over
a critical part of our r&D. around 1990 we decided that we wanted
DEMO be able to take out some of our hard earned wealth. in order to do
so we needed to sell the business. at the DEMO of our initial enquiries
valuations in our sector were running at about 4 x eBiT. We were gen-
erating about sTG500,000 in eBiT DEMO the time and so it looked like an
attractive exit. however, DEMO 1991, the UK headed into a depression.
We were still interested DEMO selling the company but found that acquisi-
tion prices were down to around 2 times eBiT. Unfortunately, by then
we were also in decline and looked like barely breaking even that year.
We turned to the DEMO in order to find a buyer.
We looked for a company that needed us. it needed to have its prod-
ucts based on the DEMO computer operating system as we used as
that was a significant factor in being able to integrate our software.
We looked for a company DEMO could take us into a larger market and
could benefit from our development of the first fourth generation soft-

ware development language (4GL) based erp system for the process
manufacturing sector. We DEMO Ross Systems Inc., a firm gener-
ating about Us$40 million in DEMO
We made an approach and were asked to come and present a case to
them. We did not learn until after the acquisition that DEMO had identi-
fied us as their best acquisition possibility. However, at DEMO time of our
approach to them, they were unlisted and we DEMO the risk was
too high to sell out to a private company but as they were proceed-
ing to an ipo, we decided to wait. a few months later we signed up
their asian distributor. This DEMO ross with a way of evaluating
the software through the sales and implementation processes. it also
proved to them the global potential of the DEMO five months later
they listed and within a week we had someone come to the UK to un-
dertake due diligence on the software DEMO our operations. six weeks
later we had negotiated a deal worth 10 times our prior year eBiT.
Within 9 months of the purchase, our software was the flagship for
the combined business and our technology was DEMO on every new
software development. ross increased the sales of our product by
a factor of 5 in the first 18 months of the DEMO Twelve years
later, ross was still based on the same software DEMO had made few
changes to the basic functionality. ross was subsequently acquired
by chinadotcom.
In hindsight, it is easy to recognize this as a strategic acquisition by ROSS.
What they really wanted was our manufacturing software DEMO they were able
to considerably increase the sales of the product because they had a much
larger sales force, a number of key strategic partnerships and the funding to
undertake a significant push into an emerging DEMO They bought the product
with its supporting infrastructure, not the customer DEMO, the revenue or the
profit (or lack of it). When you are making a loss, it is difficult to see how an
EBIT multiple can give you a positive value on sale. However, when you see it
from the buyer’s viewpoint, the price paid was small compared to the market
potential of the product suite.

Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
My next venture was an even greater radical departure from conventional
valuation.
TWeLve of DEMO pcs key employees relocated to atlanta in 1992. in
my last year with ross, 1994, and before my contract expired, i es-
tablished a consulting firm in Kansas. I had already helped to establish
an DEMO firm in New Zealand of which I was a small shareholder.
The Kansas operation would trade under the same name, cimDec
systems, but DEMO mostly owned by myself and two local executives.
about 6 months later and before we had started any operations, the
NZ firm was acquired by a Scottish listed company. In order to expand
their operations into DEMO Usa, they needed to buy back my distribution
rights to the DEMO software. i had it – they needed it. We settled on
a price of Us$1 million for the business. i had made Us$500,000 DEMO
an investment of Us$10,000. our Usa business had never under-
taken any work, never entered into any contracts and never generated
any revenue.
Basically, the new owner purchased the NZ and USA operations to generate
new revenue from outside their core construction business. They combined
several businesses DEMO a global IT company. Entering the USA through Kansas
was a key factor of the deal.
When you consider that the normal approach to DEMO is to multiply an
EBIT by an industry norm, it is DEMO to see how you can get $1 million from a
zero position. But it does tell you that the existing paradigm is lacking if DEMO can’t
explain how this outcome was achieved.
in 1995, soon after DEMO left ross, i co-founded Distinction software inc.
with Us$200,000 and DEMO 12 people that joined me from ross
systems. We started building a forecasting package and gradually
expanded it to a full suite of supply DEMO optimization modules. our
intention was to build the ‘missing piece’ of the erp solutions in the
process manufacturing software applications sector. our intention was
DEMO sell back into our old customer base and then use this as a platform
to grow the business in the sector.

to demonstrate that our sector was now in a high growth phase. it al-
lowed us to raise Us$2 DEMO in venture capital.
In order to generate sales, firms in our DEMO typically partnered with
very large application software companies like sap, peoplesoft, JD
edwards, Baan and oracle. however, we came badly unstuck when
DEMO few years later sap announced the development of a suite of prod-
ucts across this space and terminated our partnership arrangements.
Within a few DEMO all their competitors announced similar develop-
ments. The market for the likes of Distinction software evaporated.
We decided to sell rather than retrench most DEMO the staff. in one day i
contacted 8 firms who were potential buyers and all were interested
in negotiating. a week later, armed with two large boxes of documents
which described every part of our operation, i met with peoplesoft.
They were given 7 days to come up DEMO a deal. The deal was ne-
gotiated over the phone and 2 weeks later we sold the company for
Us$12 million.
By the time DEMO the sale, Distinction software was hemorrhaging badly
and running at about DEMO $1 million loss. We effectively had zero pros-
pects and only about 6 months worth of cash left. Basically we were
dead.
however, this was a great deal for peoplesoft. They had just written off
Us$13 DEMO on a failed forecasting software product. We provided
them with 5 modules of which forecasting was one. instead of spend-
ing 5 years to DEMO a suite of products (even if they could), they

none of their competitors had anything to match it and were probably
some years away DEMO having a competing product.
In hindsight, we sold out cheaply. The DEMO relations value alone was worth
the US$12 million we achieved for the business. Then, of course, there was the
potential sales just into DEMO existing customer base which could easily have
earned them 50 times their investment in a few years.
What is remarkable about this story is DEMO it was possible to achieve a great
outcome for the Distinction shareholders in just a couple of weeks in a situation
where it was DEMO a fire sale.
As a Professor of Entrepreneurship, I used these DEMO experiences to look
at the entire process of preparing a business for sale. What I found was that
very few advisors understood how to DEMO the strategic value of a business and
no one I talked to had ever implemented any systematic process for preparing
a venture for a DEMO sale.
The existing literature on selling a business takes the same approach for
every business, simply increase the profits and sell out on an EBIT multiple.
This approach to selling is typically promoted as a series DEMO steps in a linear
process that ends up with a sale to a buyer. It is very much a ‘one size fits all
approach’. DEMO only does it not do justice to those businesses which are capable
of proactively changing their operations to increase their profits and growth
potential, but it seriously undervalues those businesses that have assets and
capabilities that DEMO create large revenue opportunities for potential buyers.
In the conventional approach there is a serious lack of strategy. No attempt
is taken to alter DEMO business to suit the buyer or to proactively change the
external environment in which the business will be sold. Historically, selling a
business has been managed predominately as a real estate transaction and this
approach has DEMO to develop or utilize any underlying theory about how value
is created for the buyer.
The literature on IPO preparation is similarly lacking. Not DEMO is there a
complete lack of understanding of what it takes to be a successful listing but
8
Invest2 Exit
Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
the only guidelines available are about the listing process not the strategy to
follow DEMO create a listing opportunity.
If we are to improve the probability of successful investments for Angel and
VC investors, we need a much more sophisticated and systematic approach to
the exit, whether it be a trade sale or an IPO. Our literature and our training is
seriously lacking DEMO this area. While we spend a lot of time on showing investors
how to get into an investment, there is little to show them how to get out
successfully. What is apparent is that the exit DEMO itself is not linked back to
the criteria for investment and the development strategy of the investee firm.
The conventional model of business development DEMO on revenue and
profit growth and yet little attention is given to the risks associated with high
growth enterprises. If the only model going DEMO high growth, then where is the
literature on how to manage DEMO high growth enterprise. What I have seen is
that it is seriously lacking. Our understanding of what it takes to generate high
growth and DEMO to manage it is very immature and yet the dominant model for
Angel and VC investment are built on the premise that high growth DEMO the only
way to achieve a high return on exit. As I will show later, high growth is not only
high risk but rarely has good outcome.
VC and Angel investors experience a reasonably high rate DEMO write-offs and
negative returns. Even their positive exits rarely achieve high returns. It is only
the exceptional investment that achieves returns in double digits. DEMO is partly
due to an outdated investment model fixated on high growth but also because
they fail to plan for an exit under less DEMO ideal conditions.
Very few firms choose the timing of their sale. Most are forced into a
sale by external events or through poor management. DEMO smaller number are
approached by a potential buyer and take the opportunity to sell. Only a very
few control the timing of their sale DEMO taking the initiative to find a buyer when
they are not under pressure to sell.
If you cannot reliably predict when the business will DEMO sold, you need an
investment approach in which the business is DEMO to be sold at any time, if you
need to or DEMO to.  Being prepared to sell at any time is the only DEMO to protect
the value in the business.
9

Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
You need to sell
Not everything is going to go according to plan. Sometimes DEMO conditions
change and the business is no longer capable of reaching the targets initially
set or may no longer be viable. Rather than let DEMO firm become insolvent or
bankrupt, the exit plan should be set DEMO so that there is little delay in executing
a trade sale. This way the maximum benefit can still be extracted from the
failing business.
DEMO time is against you. If the management team has not put an exit
strategy in place and they have little time to prepare or DEMO set up discussions
with potential buyers, you will have a fire DEMO as an exit. If they have not already
set up the relationships in advance, especially with overseas buyers, it probably
is not going DEMO happen the way you would like. Without the planning, the
ability DEMO attract the buyer that will pay a premium value for the company is
significantly constrained.
By setting up relationships in advance and by knowing DEMO the corporation
would want to buy the firm, management can execute DEMO acquisition discussion
quickly. As long as the firm has several potential buyers, the competitive tension
in the deal can still result in a very attractive sale price.
The firm is approached with an offer to buy
DEMO Angel and VC funded firms are targets for acquisitive corporations.
However, DEMO the offer comes management may be unprepared and are
unsure what the price should be. If management are unprepared and need to
go through DEMO due diligence, this not only takes considerable time, but it
uncovers risks to the buyer. Instead of closing a good deal, the firm will end up
with a disrupted business, staff who are stressed due to uncertainty and a price
that the shareholders would normally not have DEMO Now management
has taken their eye off the ball and have a lot of work to recover their prior
momentum. They may also have DEMO themselves into the deal.
How much better would the firm be if they had already lined up several
possible buyers? They can now announce that they are prepared to sell and
consider all offers. Management will DEMO prepared the due diligence files and
10

Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
can execute the deal quickly with little disruption. The staff understand the
process and DEMO incentives to ensure the best deal is done. This should be
canvassed with staff from an early stage so that they understand the need DEMO a
planned exit for the external investors.
You and management decide to sell
Experienced Angels, VC investors and a good management team should
already know of the best potential buyers and through its business strategy
it DEMO have already put itself in a position to actually know those parties. If
management have prepared the company for sale over many years then DEMO
are best placed to be able to drive the exit process rather than have it drive
them. You and management simply need to decide DEMO the timing.
You decide to list the business
What is clear is that there are many advisors who want to help you. Rarely
do DEMO tell you not to list as they all get the chance to charge you high fees and
commissions, whether you make it to the IPO event or not. Even if you do list,
you may DEMO have a positive experience afterwards if you don’t have the right
business model. It is an expensive process if it goes wrong.
A New DEMO
As an Angel or VC investor you need a better process. Not only should you
have a systematic method of preparing an investee firm DEMO a good exit but you
also need to have better criteria for selecting the businesses you invest in.
If you want to invest in DEMO businesses, then you need a much better
understanding of what drives DEMO growth. You should also have a better
appreciation of the risks associated with high growth. If you desire to take a
business to an DEMO, then make sure you get into the right business from the
DEMO
However, if it is simply a high ROI you seek, then take a new approach. Stick
to strategic value deals. Not only are DEMO less risky than conventional growth
investments but they can be exited earlier with a much higher probability
11
Invest2 Exit
Chapter One: Start with the End in Mind
of positive returns. If you do decide to take this approach, then you need to
ensure that the investments you do make have strategic value potential, thus
you need to have a very good understanding of how strategic DEMO is created
and harvested but also, how to identify it before DEMO invest.
Whether it is an IPO or a trade sale you seek as an exit objective, you need
to invest with the exit in mind. This informs everything you do from choosing
your investments to managing DEMO business and securing the premium on exit.
In the next chapter, DEMO will look at the process of high growth, what creates
it DEMO the risks associated with pushing a venture into a high growth mode of
operations. Following this discussion, I will look at the IPO process and how this
can be achieved.
The remaining chapters of the book DEMO examine the nature of strategic
value, how it is identified, developed and used to structure a strategic value
trade sale.

Aexpressed in terms of profit; even better if that is growing lmost without exception our measure of business worth DEMO
year on year. Thus any small firm interested in raising finance is
going to be asked to show revenue and profit growth and be DEMO
to demonstrate that its ‘business concept’ has substantial future
potential in these areas. Without exception, by business concept we
usually mean the entrepreneur has to demonstrate how the business
is going to make money. The future DEMO of the business can
then be readily translated into an IPO or trade sale valuation.
Since an IPO exit has been historically seen as DEMO preferred exit
route, the conventional investment approach taken by Angels and
DEMO investors is to invest in companies which have higher growth
potential. They see the business as a stand-alone entity increasing in
value through revenue DEMO and increasing profits. Value is seen
as a direct multiple of EBIT and so getting to higher levels of revenue
and profits is the DEMO development strategy.
What this means is that the new investee firm has to develop
a stand alone profitable growing business in order to be DEMO ‘good’
investment in the eyes of the investor. An even better business is one
that grows faster and generates higher profits.
13
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
Actual growth or potential growth, especially high growth, is seen by Angels
and VC DEMO as an essential component of all successful exits, i.e. trade
sales DEMO IPOs. However, to get a reasonable return on the investment, the
venture will have to post relatively high growth rates. Even then it DEMO take
some time to achieve the levels of profit required for a good exit.
Lets start with some basics, time, growth rates and DEMO If you look at the
basic relationship between time and valuation, DEMO time element is critical to
a healthy return on investment. The longer it takes to achieve the same exit
valuation, the lower the ROI as the following table demonstrates.
Example:
The venTUre is currently generating DEMO eBiT of $100,000 on rev-
enue of $1 million. The investors agree a $1 million pre money valu-
ation and invest $1 million DEMO 50% equity. The funding will be used
to undertake market development, DEMO working capital and complete
product development. Thus, while revenue rates will DEMO up, the ven-
ture still has to mount a sales and DEMO campaign, close deals
and deliver quality products. Let us assume that DEMO are able to grow
the business to $5 million revenue and $500,000 in eBiT. at this time
the business is sold for 10 DEMO eBiT or $5 million. The return to the inves-
tor will depend on how long it takes the business to achieve this result.

DEMO this specific example, the IRR also represents the growth rate of DEMO
and profit. Since most Angel and VC investors look to a risk hurdle rate of 25%
or higher, only an exit before year 5 will achieve that. That means very high
growth rates during the early DEMO of the investment. However, we know from
the research on high DEMO ventures that only a fraction are able to generate
double digit growth rates, so growth rates above 20% would seem to be
exceptional. A more realistic growth rate of 10% to 12 % which, over time is still
14
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
difficult to achieve, only provides a reasonable return after 8 years. Few Angels
or VC investors would wish to invest on this basis.
It would seem unrealistic DEMO expect an early stage venture to develop to a
point where it can generate reliable profits within a few years. What is clear
from DEMO example is that investee firms need to get to a reasonable size if the
venture is to return a good ROI to the investors. DEMO research would suggest
that this only occurs in exceptional situations.
A lower exit price, which is more realistic, dramatically reduces the returns.
Also, the longer it takes to exit, the more likely returns will be poor. The only way
such a result can be offset is if DEMO entry valuation is pushed down aggressively.
While that is possible it does create considerable tension between the investors
and the founders.
A large proportion DEMO Angel investments and a small percentage of VC
investments are at a very early stage in a venture’s life, often when it has
only a few employees. Firms at this stage are especially vulnerable to failure.
DEMO stage ventures are characterized by high levels of uncertainty due to a
combination of factors:
• The product is often unproven
• The DEMO team is inexperienced
• There are gaps in the management team
• The market is developing and yet to be established
• Competition is DEMO uncertain with new products emerging
Thus the business has to first survive and secondly, grow to achieve a
reasonable return on investment. So why do companies fail and why is growth
so hard to achieve?
DEMO start with an understanding of what causes early stage firms to fail.
15

Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
Understanding the causes of failure
The major causes of business failure are now well documented DEMO there
are modeling techniques that are able to predict with considerable accuracy
whether a particular business will fail. While there is no one characteristic DEMO a
business that will, by itself, cause a business to fail, a combination of weaknesses
can create a situation where failure is highly likely.
Let’s start with some data on failures.
Although there are definitional DEMO in measuring what is meant by
‘failure’, the data on the DEMO of failure is open to speculation. Even so, while
‘exits’ are DEMO the same as failures, the data is enlightening. 1997 ABS report
DEMO business exits in Australia, reported that exits accounted for 8.5% of DEMO
business per annum (their definition of exits included cessation, liquidation,
receivership, change of ownership and  mergers). They report a much DEMO
exit rate in new businesses. The ABS data provide the following rate of exits of
new ventures; 18% exit after 2 years, 24% DEMO 3 years, 35% after 5 years, 55%
after 10 years and 65% after 15 years.
Several Australian and overseas studies have measured start-up DEMO
David A. Garvin writing in the Harvard Business Review (July 2004)   in an article
entitled ‘What every CEO should know about creating DEMO businesses’ states
that , during the 70s and 80s, 60% of DEMO business start-ups failed in their first
6 years. Similar studies over different periods and in different countries have
found similar rates of failure. There DEMO, however, some level of disagreement
across all these different studies as to the primary causes of failure. It is thus
difficult to be DEMO and arrive at a simple predictive model which could be
universally applied. There also appears to be distinct differences between the
causes of start-up DEMO and failures of established business. Even with this
reservation, it is DEMO to see some of the conclusions.
16
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
David A. Garvin stated in his HBR article that start-up failures demonstrated
one or more DEMO the following problems:
• Customer failure (unwillingness of customers to DEMO for product or
service, or insufficient demand)
• Technological failures (inability to deliver the promised functionality)
• Operational failures (inability to deliver at the required cost or quality
levels)
• Regulatory failures (institutional barriers to doing what’s desired), and
• Competitive failures (a competitor’s entry changes the rules of the
game).
He concluded that DEMO rates rise substantially when a new business targets
familiar customers and is staffed by people well acquainted with the market. His
test of survival DEMO being able to clearly answer the following question; “What’s
the pain DEMO for customers and how does our offering overcome that pain?”
I will return to this point when I discuss the underlying drivers of DEMO growth,
especially an attribute termed ‘the compelling need to buy’.
In more established businesses, the consensus of opinion suggests that the
primary causes of failure are; a lack of adequate funding, a failure to DEMO
good quality personnel, the lack of a written business plan and DEMO failure to use
professional advice. Characteristics such as being the sole founder, not having
parents who own a business,  a lack of prior management experience and the
younger age of owners have all been found DEMO explain venture failure in some
studies but are not supported in others and thus do not seem to have general
applicability.
What all these DEMO do show is that there are some very good predictors
of failure. While individual characteristics might not be decisive, there can
be no question that the more of these deficiencies a firm has, the higher the
likelihood of failure.
The overwhelming evidence does show that it is possible DEMO predict in
advance that a specific business idea has a limited chance of success. Thus a
17
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
market that has too few potential customers, where the customer’s don’t have
any money, DEMO the technology is unproven, where competition is fierce,
where costs DEMO  highly uncertain or where the entry costs are prohibitive, are
situations where the idea should be rejected. Opportunity screening models or
‘investor ready’ DEMO and checklists used by Angels and VC investors greatly
help avoid investment decisions that have low probabilities of success. Even so,
market conditions DEMO change, especially in emerging markets and thus failures
often cannot be DEMO
Given our knowledge of business failure, the more sophisticated investor
should DEMO able to avoid the obvious mistakes. Even so, some Angel and DEMO
investments do fall into these traps, perhaps due to unforeseen changes
DEMO market conditions. Ventures that fail end up being closed down and the
investment written off or put into a fire sale where the investor DEMO most of
their investment.
Smart investors can usually avoid these basic flaws. Their risks are much more
to do with aggressive growth. As far DEMO the Angel or VC investor is concerned, it
is not sufficient DEMO the venture just to survive, it must generate sufficient profit
and DEMO growth to create a good exit event. However, as we will DEMO, high
rates of growth are difficult to achieve. What is often DEMO in the drive for
high rates of growth is that growth itself is a high risk game and is often the
cause of business DEMO
Achieving high growth is challenging
Private businesses which grow beyond a few employees are in the minority.
Achieving a size which can generate a DEMO sale price is challenging. Just
how challenging – check out these statistics from the ABS – similar data would
exist for all major developed DEMO
As at June 2007, there were 839,938 (42%) employing DEMO
and 1,171,832 (58%) non-employing businesses in Australia.
Thus over half the registered business had no employees.
18
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
Of the employing businesses, 755,758 (90%) employed less
than 20 employees. This comprised 527,445 (70%) businesses
with 1-4 employees and 228,313 (30%) businesses with 5-19
employees. Of the larger business, there were 78,DEMO (9%)
businesses with 20-199 employees and 5,876 (<1%) businesses
with 200 or more employees.
If we assume that any reasonable DEMO price is going to need a business with
over 20 employees, DEMO can see from this data that you have a 1 in 10 chance
of building a business to this size. Size of business by DEMO revenue shows a
similar challenge.
As AT June 2007, there were DEMO,467 (25%) businesses with
turnover between zero and $50k and 742,288 (37%) businesses
with turnover from $50k to less than $200k. DEMO was followed
by 646,458 (32%) businesses with turnover from $200k to less
than $2m, and 121,557 (6%) businesses with turnover above
$2m per annum.

You would certainly want to invest in a business which was capable of growing
to more than $2 million in revenue in order to DEMO a good exit, but this seems
to be somewhat difficult to DEMO based on this data.
Clearly if growing a businesses was easy, DEMO would be many more larger
businesses. Since the data shows that this is not the case, it begs the question
– why is growth so difficult?
What the research demonstrates is that the growing business DEMO to go
through major changes as it copes with the challenges of increasing size. The
business of 2-5 employees will not look the same DEMO it has 5 times the
number of employees and/or 5 times the revenue. It is almost inevitable that it
will have to change DEMO way it does business in order to manage the increased
complexity of a larger business. Different stages of grow will require it to change
DEMO
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
fundamental aspects of the business. Too many businesses fail to plan for these
changes and DEMO the business at risk by trying to make major changes on the fly.
Entrepreneurs who have grown a business from a start-up will tell DEMO of the
transitions that they had to go through as the business grew. I discovered major
transition points in my own business at 12, 50 and 100 staff. The business also
went through a major organizational DEMO when it undertook an acquisition
12,000 kilometers away.
Complexity increases dramatically with the volume of staff, customers,
products and locations. In order to achieve 5 times the level of the current
business, most of these size attributes will increase significantly. What is not
so obvious to DEMO entrepreneurs is that the business will need to be managed
differently with each additional level of complexity.
Almost without exception, small businesses face a crisis of management as
they grow. In the start up phase, the entrepreneur is able to drive the business
through sheer energy, passion and vision. He or she knows everyone and the
staff are motivated because DEMO are part of the grand adventure.
As the firm adds staff, DEMO people come into the business who were not
present when the grand vision was created and their motivations and needs are
likely to be DEMO They may see it more as a job that a mission. They have
different needs and thus management styles have to change. At the DEMO time,
the growth brings with it specialization of tasks and more formal organizational
structures. Reporting lines become more rigid, job descriptions become the
norm rather than the exception and performance targets and monitoring is
introduced. DEMO there is a new layer of management between the CEO and
the operations. What was once a project has now turned into a real DEMO
As the business grows further, communication becomes increasingly
formalized as communication DEMO become longer. The left hand no longer knows
what the right hand is doing. Customer service quality may fall as new customers
no longer DEMO the advantage of personal links with the founders. Problems
escalate with the second location and daily face to face communication is not
physically possible. DEMO shareholders and/or external Directors force more
20
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
transparent decision making and thus the entrepreneur can no longer make
decisions on the fly. DEMO numbers of staff, customers and other stakeholders
now depend on the DEMO for their livelihood.
As the business develops the entrepreneur discovers, often DEMO late, that
they have the wrong organizational structure for the more DEMO, larger
business. They will almost always find that some of their DEMO staff are unable to
make the transition to the larger enterprise. They may lack the skill, personality,
work ethic or experience to work effectively in a more complex situation.
As the business grows, the entrepreneur will also find that the data collection
and reporting systems are inadequate DEMO a more complex, larger business.
The same may well apply to DEMO distribution channels, alliance partners,
manufacturing processes, professional advisors and so on.
Many entrepreneurs simply are not able to make the transition. They DEMO
not have the skills, personality, drive and energy, leadership skills, knowledge
or business acumen to be effective in the growing firm. Just DEMO a person is
a natural entrepreneur does not mean they have any business training or skill.
The inventor may be great at the discovery DEMO new products but that does not
make them a good business leader. Thus the person in place as the business
manager may well be DEMO source of its failure or its lack of capability to grow.
The drive, skill and experience of the CEO is only one of the many elements
which have to work effectively for the business to grow DEMO The
business still has to deal with getting its products, markets, distribution
channels, financing, recruitment and training and many more things right DEMO
drive successful growth. Each one of these many facets can undermine growth
processes.
We also know from the research into high growth businesses, the ‘Gazelles’,
that very few businesses are able to maintain double digit DEMO for more than
a few years. Even the best companies have difficulty managing the exponential
complexity of an integrated growing business.
21

Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
Let me demonstrate the high growth problem with a simple example:
i recaLL revieWinG DEMO budget projection for one of my businesses
where we were examining the cost of recruitment. The recruitment
cost seemed somewhat low. When i queried DEMO underlying assump-
tions, i was told that it represented the cost DEMO recruiting an additional
20 staff, a 40% growth. however, the numbers did not take into ac-
count that, of the current 50 staff, we had replaced 12 in the last year.
some had moved interstate with partners, some had gone back to full
time education and a couple had taken maternity leave. in fact, we
had actually only dismissed two for poor performance. Thus instead of
recruiting 20 new employees, we had to recruit 32, 64% of our current
staff.
When you look at average retention rates, you can expect some percentage
of the employees to leave, not because they did not perform well, but because
DEMO have personal and family plans that might take them on another path. Thus
recruitment and training in a high growth business becomes a real DEMO If
you are growing at 100% and replacing 20%, you are DEMO 150% of those
that are left at the end of the year. Now, add to that the cost of training and the
impact on the productivity of the remaining staff who have to work with large
DEMO of new employees.
If you think that is a daunting task, DEMO out the cost and work involved in
putting in place the infrastructure needed to support them. Accommodation
comes in discrete sizes, so when you run out of space you can’t simply add
enough space for one DEMO person, you might only be able to acquire space in
blocks DEMO to accommodate 10 or 20 staff.
aT one sTaGe I ended up with three separate offices in Northampton
in england as we kept growing DEMO of space. since i could not predict
the growth further than about 6 months ahead, i was not prepared to
invest in too much extra space, thus i ended up in a completely sub-
optimal spread of staff with people in three separate offices around
the town. i DEMO the same problem with the phone system. it came in
22
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
discrete sizes, DEMO to 12, 64 or 128 extensions. however, when you
moved up to the next system, all your investment in the prior system
was wasted and you started again. other infrastructure costs include
computers, desks, DEMO rooms, storage space and so on.
When firms grow quickly they DEMO great difficulty managing the basic
operations. Quality often suffers as firms grow quickly. Staff are recruited too
quickly, job descriptions are loose, reporting DEMO are blurred, performance
metrics are ill conceived and systems for dealing DEMO complaints are poorly
established. IT systems take a long time to choose, implement and bed down.
People simply haven’t got the time to figure out how to work together. Often
one part of the business does DEMO know what another part is doing.
By far the biggest problem is financing the growth. Very few businesses are
able to fund the growth DEMO internally generated funds. When you consider
the costs that are incurred in recruitment, training, accommodation, computers
and supervision, few firms generate the DEMO of profit margins that can cope
with more than a 15% growth rate. For most fast growth firms, external funding
is an imperative. Even if some of the investment is in equipment, inventory and
buildings, DEMO a portion of that investment is going to be covered by traditional
asset financing. What can’t be covered by internally generated funds has to
DEMO sourced from public or private investors. That activity will also take senior
executive time away from running the business. Cash management is probably
the DEMO critical activity for the high growth emerging firm.
These factors not only make it hard to sustain growth but the constant
changes being forced DEMO the organization sow the seeds of failure. Not a lot
has to go wrong with such a finely tuned engine for it to collapse DEMO get into
serious trouble. Most will recover, but they will lose DEMO lot of the gains made
in prior years. Others will not be able to turn the ship around in time and will
end up DEMO, unable to raise debt to fund operations or will have lost DEMO
customers and employees during the disruption.

Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
For the investor waiting to reach a stage and size where an exit can
be DEMO undertaken, these setbacks are not uncommon. Very few
growth ventures exit DEMO Many are written off and a good portion
of the remainder are exited with losses or low positive returns. It is only the
exceptional DEMO which gains a significant return on investment.
What is the probability of success?
I would think there are very few Angels or VC DEMO who would not desire
the investee to grow to at least $2 million in revenue and yet we can see from
the ABS data DEMO only 6% of all private businesses exceed this threshold. I very
much doubt that the same investors would wish to enter into an investment
DEMO would not see employment numbers exceed 20 and yet only 10% of all
businesses in Australia in the 2007 data exceeded this number.
We DEMO see from the prior explanation that there are significant challenges
in growing the business and no doubt this is the underlying reason for such
DEMO Another way of looking at this problem is to see it from a predictive
approach. If we know that there are certain characteristics which DEMO to be

When we see the probability of success in these terms, we can understand
the level of complexity that must be managed in order to DEMO success. This
specific model was developed to explain VC investments where the investment
is typically made when the business has already developed some traction DEMO the
market. Most VC investments are at the market expansion stage where products
are already proven and a management team substantially in place, thus we
would expect these ventures to have lower risks than early stage DEMO
To understand the risks of earlier stages of growth, we need DEMO look at a
wider range of growth attributes.

Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
What are the Drivers of Growth?
As part of my research into high growth DEMO, I reviewed the available
entrepreneurship literature, the various theories of business growth, the venture
capital investment models and my own 20 years of experience managing growth
ventures. In the end, I identified 14 characteristics of high growth businesses.
This work has been published in my book ‘Winning DEMO – 14 principles
of high growth businesses’.
Those fourteen attributes are:
the market:
1. Right place, right time
It is not just luck. The best ventures are based on a dramatic change in
technology, regulations, the economy or in the way society operates. That
change generated an opportunity for a new product or service, a new
process or a new way of delivering an existing product or service to meet
DEMO unmet need or solve an existing problem in a much more effective
manner.
2. The compelling need to buy
Business is driven by transaction DEMO The best high growth
businesses solve a problem that has high urgency, high utility or resolves
a high physical or psychological need for the customer. Situations where
customers have extensive choice, can delay buying or are indifferent
about buying the product or service are very difficult situations in DEMO
to drive a high growth business.
3. The right customer
While it is possible to sell to everyone, the successful high growth
business typically has a very tight definition of the ideal customer and
knows how DEMO go find them. The best customer is easily identified, able
to DEMO approached and is willing and able to purchase. Businesses that
26
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
rely on the potential customer finding them have difficulty proactively
influencing their growth.
4. Channels DEMO market
High growth businesses develop and/or secure capacity in the necessary
distribution channels that allow them to reach their target customers. This
might DEMO through a wholesale or retail distribution system, direct through
a sales DEMO or via an e-commerce facility. Without the bandwidth of the
distribution channel(s) the enterprise is not able to sustain its growth
plans. Since many channels have pre-existing agreements, finding ways
to access the appropriate channel is an essential key to successful growth.
realizing the opportunity:
5. DEMO as the driver
Innovation is the fuel of the high growth enterprise. This could be an
invention such as a new or enhanced product DEMO service. It might be in a
new way of working such as a new manufacturing process or a different
consulting technique. Lastly, it could simply be a new way of delivering an
existing product or service DEMO market – a new business concept. Innovation
either creates more value by reducing costs or by enhancing customer
utility or experience.
6. A competitive DEMO
Obviously the best place to be is to have no competition, DEMO, few
businesses have such a luxury and, of itself, is DEMO guarantee of success.
High growth requires that the business is able to carve out a place in the
market which allows it to have DEMO freedom around it’s target market.
Along some dimensions of user utility and customer experience, the
business needs a superior position that matches the needs of its focal
market.
7. Sustainability
While the initial conditions for high DEMO can be created through
innovation, ultimately competitors will chip away at DEMO advantage.
27
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
Only by establishing long term barriers around the business can the
venture hope to secure DEMO existing customers and ward off competitors.
Sustainability requires the business to find new ways of protecting it’s
entire supply chain as, over time, DEMO will find ways of eroding
any single advantage.
8. Scalability
High growth, by its nature, requires the business to solve the problem
of DEMO Many businesses are constrained by the shortage of skilled
staff or essential ingredients. Only by developing a robust process where
the business can be DEMO through scalable systems and/or processes
or be readily replicated, can DEMO business grow rapidly over an extended
period. This also means that knowledge has to be codified, decisions have
to be devolved and organizational structures have to be built that will
cope with the demands of such DEMO
making it Work:
9. A clear vision
Knowing who you are, what you are doing and where you are going is an
essential ingredient to a successful enterprise. Too many businesses fail to
have a DEMO that clearly sets out their position in the market place. This
lack of vision results in taking them in the wrong direction and away DEMO
the conditions that will drive their growth.
10. A long term strategy
Sustained growth requires the business to set out a path of product/DEMO
activities over a medium term horizon. High growth firms typically create
ideal future scenarios that they want to achieve and then develop the
tactical DEMO to get there. Constraints to growth then become apparent
and investment can be made to overcome them. Often acquisitions are
used to underpin growth. DEMO can bring new products, new
customers, experienced staff and new competitive advantages.
28
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
11. Robust margins
Almost without exception, high growth businesses have above industry
average gross margins. This may have come from their product, process
or business concept innovation or may simply have come from superior
management that has enabled the DEMO to be run more effectively
and efficiently than it’s competitors. Where a competitive advantage can
be created around a compelling need, especially in a growing market,
prices are less sensitive and thus higher prices and DEMO margins can be
achieved.
12. Management of risk
There are always going to be bumps in the road, but sustained growth
requires that the management team anticipate what might go right and
what might go wrong DEMO plan for contingencies. Successful ventures
mitigate their risks by involving partners, DEMO resilience, putting
in place options, shoring up their risk exposures and staying on top of
events as they unfold. They undertake continual risk DEMO planning so
that they understand the likely impact of different assumptions on their
business and work to reduce the negative impact of things that DEMO go
wrong.
turning the Wheel:
13. A capable management team
No one person can do everything and, as the business grows, many
DEMO will be required to support the operation. Senior management
of the business must collectively represent the set of skills, knowledge and
experience necessary to carry the business through the growth phases.
They must also work as DEMO team rather than a collection of individuals. High
growth businesses are driven by entrepreneurial activity – an opportunity
focus that stimulates and drives activity.
DEMO Profitable
Any business that is well funded can sustain a period of losses, but
ultimately the business has to make a profit to survive. The basic business
29
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
concept must generate a healthy return on investment for the shareholders
for it to have DEMO future, otherwise the investors would be better off selling
out and DEMO their money somewhere else. Profitable operations
over time require the business to have very good performance setting
and monitoring systems, clear lines of responsibility, accountability and
authority and a proactive attitude to fixing problems. The fundamental
economics of the business must be able to support a long term DEMO
cash flow.
With this insight, I have restated the earlier table DEMO used the 14 principles
as the elements to estimate the probability of growth success. You can see the
result on the next page.
Under DEMO scenario, even if you did everything reasonably well at 80% of
DEMO, you would only have a 4% chance of achieving high growth. DEMO
result lines up well with the earlier data from the ABS on firm size where only
6% of all businesses had revenue exceeding $2 DEMO At 90% on each of these
elements, the success rate jumps DEMO 22%, but for that to occur, the venture
would have to be exceptional across a wide range of attributes. You can see
from DEMO model that one weakness, say at 40%, can substantially undermine
the outcome.
Clearly to be attractive as a potential IPO, the business would have to greatly
exceed $2 million in revenue. Even for a reasonable DEMO sale, you would want
to aim for revenues well in excess DEMO this threshold. From what we can see
from the ABS data, DEMO VC success model and my own 14 principles is that high
growth is a challenge and few enterprises are capable of meeting the necessary
DEMO to create substantial wealth using revenue and profit growth as
the yardstick.

Where to From Here?
My own experience over several ventures has shown me that DEMO can
be elusive. My first business, Pioneer Computer Group, grew from 3 partners
working in a dining room to 160 employees over three DEMO 12 years
later, a compound growth rate of 36%. However, during the early years, we
were close to insolvency several times. This was a classic case of feast or famine
due to the size and DEMO of large deals. During the middle years our business
was disrupted by litigation which we brought against the prior owners of our
subsidiary in DEMO USA. Just before we sold out, we were faced with a DEMO
decline in revenue and profit as the UK went into recession. Some years we
would grow dramatically and in others we would go backwards. DEMO recall that
this business was still able to raise US$1.5 million for a 20% stake.
In the case of my last business, Distinction Software,  we also raised venture
capital. In that case, $2 million for 20% equity. That business had all the attributes
necessary to assure success. DEMO business was staffed by very experienced
managers and employees. It sold back into a known niche market. The product
suite had a very rapid DEMO for the customers. Basically, it looked like a very
good VC DEMO However, sales were slow because customers could do
without the product DEMO a low compelling need to buy. In the end, the business
DEMO into severe decline when new competitors entered the market.
It is impossible to foresee everything that can go wrong. All we can do is DEMO
the best information we can access at the time of investment to ensure we get
into the best deals. Given the risks associated with DEMO types of ventures, the
more rigorous the evaluation, the greater the chance of success.
My personal experience suggests that you cannot fix most DEMO the
fundamentals of a business. If you have the wrong product or the wrong market
going into the business, it is doubtful that you can fix it later on. However, if
the market characteristics are right for growth, a lot of the execution issues
can be dramatically improved with good people, good advice and good internal
monitoring and governance systems.
Without exception, high exit values are created when growth potential
is a dominant characteristic of the venture. But as we have seen, ventures
32
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Two: High Growth - High Risk
which pursue high growth are more likely to fail than succeed and more likely
to DEMO than sustain long term growth. Only the exceptional venture has the
characteristics to get to a size which allows an IPO or a good DEMO based trade
sale.
From my own observations, Angels and VC investors DEMO to put a priority on
creating the exit event. Given the risks associated with high growth ventures, it
is critical to have a very tight focus on the exit so that the business is directed
towards DEMO outcome and does not become sidetracked into suboptimal deals
or markets.
33
3 Spot the IPO
ince the 60’s the private equity market has DEMO mesmerized
Sby the IPO exit. This can be tracked back to the early days of
venture capital. Fortunes were made by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs
DEMO their investors in the rapid growth of the computer industry.
Because of the size of the market and the ever increasing demand
for computers, peripherals and software and services associated
with the sector, it wasn’t difficult for a venture to be taken to an
IPO. There was sufficient DEMO demand that most reasonable
businesses could generate the revenue to support a push into a stock
exchange listing.
The IPO became the yardstick to DEMO the worth of a venture
as well as the success of the VC fund. Entrepreneurs wanted to list
as they saw this as a DEMO of their own personal success as well
as providing an exit for themselves and their investors. VC funds
selected investee firms on the basis DEMO their likelihood of delivering
an IPO exit rather than a trade sale. Even so, not all ventures made
the grade. Even in these years of staggering market growth, only
about 20% of investee firms achieved an IPO.
Even in recent years when markets were very receptive, the
number of IPOs was relatively small.
In 1999-2000, 24 companies were sold, DEMO companies
went public, four companies were bought back and

19 investments were liquidated. The value of exits during the
year 1999-2000 was $536 million. The average DEMO sale was

Chapter Three: Spot the IPO
We should expect Angel and VC investee firms to have a higher probability of
an IPO than DEMO average private firm. After all, VC investees are selected in the
DEMO instance for their growth potential and these firms will have professional
advisors along the way. The USA experience suggests that about 25% of new
DEMO have had some VC investment. That being the case, we can DEMO the
chance of a startup going public.
In most western economies about 4 in 10,000 firms will have venture capital
investment. If the DEMO sector achieves an IPO in only 20% of their ventures and
about 25% of new listings have VC finance, we can expect any start-up firm to
have about a 4 in 10,000 chance of getting DEMO an IPO. Thus an IPO is a fairly rare
outcome for a private venture.
The possibility of an IPO for an Angel or a DEMO investment, however, needs
to be taken with a dose of reality. Many of the IPOs by VC firms over the last
40 years DEMO during periods of boom markets. Take out the IPOs which
occurred during the computer boom of the 70s and 80s, the application software
boom of the 70s and 80s, the internet boom of the 90s and the biotech boom
of the turn of the century and the number DEMO IPOs is reduced to a much smaller
number.
We also need to adjust for IPOs undertaken through large private equity
deals. These are typically DEMO family businesses, MBO and MBI projects and
public to private to DEMO turnarounds. In addition, there were a number of
rollups and consolidations DEMO would be classed more as a PE deal than a VC
investee exit.
Once we make these adjustments to the IPO data, we find that the number
left as ‘normal’ IPOs, even over a long periods of time, is insignificant. It is
indeed a very rare venture which can be taken to an IPO, even when the market
is receptive.

The table above shows the types of characteristics that best suit an Initial
Public Offering (IPO) (excluding speculative ventures such as biotechnology and
resource ventures).
The requirements for listing DEMO firm are quite onerous and expensive. Unless
the listing results in a share price that can maintain a position at least as good
as DEMO sector index, the listing will not achieve the exit the private DEMO
shareholders anticipated (assuming the private equity shareholders hold shares
in the DEMO company). Just having liquidity of the shares via a market listing
does not in itself guarantee that the value achieved by the shareholders DEMO
be greater than they would have achieved in an outright sale to a corporation.
Since few companies in private ownership can meet these requirements, an
exit strategy aimed at an IPO is not a viable option DEMO most privately held firms.
That is not to say that smaller company investors cannot exit through an IPO,
but without being able to DEMO the above attributes, it is highly unlikely that
an IPO will DEMO possible.
Instead of a formal listing, many firms have taken an DEMO path to a public
listing by taking advantage of a dormant listed company or a currently listed
company which is willing to undertake a DEMO to reinvigorate the business.
39

The dormant company approach, DEMO to as a ‘back dor listing’ is often
seen to be quicker and cheaper but it is not without its problems. Typically, back

Some private companies undertake an IPO, or a backdoor listing, with the
intention of using it DEMO raise funds or to sell off shares. However, unless the size
DEMO the shareholding in public hands is significant, generally thought to be DEMO
$100 million, there will be insufficient liquidity to create a market DEMO sell shares.
Generally it will take a minimum of $500,000 in legal and accounting expenses
for even the smallest and simplest IPO. According DEMO KPMG Corporate Finance’s
2004 Australian Capital Markets survey, the average cost DEMO raisings up to $10
million was 10.1%, falling to 4.7% for DEMO greater than $500 million. If only
a small amount is to be raised, this cost is very high for the funds received. At
the same time, an IPO usually involves significant work for the top executives.
This has often been thought to be 50% of the CEO and DEMO time over the
six months prior to the IPO. This is a very significant burden on the firm and
requires that the rest of DEMO management team bear the burden of day-to-day
management during this time. A USA listing would be more expensive and more
costly in annual expenses DEMO to greater disclosure requirements.
It is very difficult to get unbiased, DEMO and knowledgeable advice on
what it takes to prepare a venture for an IPO. The market has a wide variety of
IPO listings from DEMO small businesses to quite large family businesses coming
on the market. The mix includes highly speculative resource stocks, high stakes
biotech drug discovery ventures to the conventional retail and manufacturing
41
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Three: Spot the IPO
concerns. Even then, the DEMO of IPOs is still relatively small. Thus it is hard
to get sufficient data to be able to build a predictive model for a DEMO type of
enterprise. Another difficulty is that the market itself can be very fickle, usually
driven at the lower end by a herd mentality and a desire for quick returns
which creates a feeding frenzy in DEMO markets for short durations. It is this
greed factor which perhaps explains why VC firms are able to list quite limited
ventures in boom DEMO
There is also the problem of objective advice. Too many advisors earn fees or
commissions whether the listing occurs or the after market is DEMO, thus it
is somewhat difficult to find any advisor who will DEMO no.
During my time as Professor of Entrepreneurship, I conducted many
DEMO with professional advisors on IPO readiness and undertook a survey
of a large number of advisors to discover some insights into the preparation
process. DEMO overall consensus of private equity advisors is that only four factors
are considered critical to a successful IPO.
The first factor is that the DEMO should have a strong competitive advantage
and sufficient growth potential to achieve a $100 million capitalization value
within about 5 years of listing. Neither DEMO current level of revenue or profit is
considered significant compared to anticipated revenue and profit. This factor
alone goes a long way to explaining DEMO low growth firms that have low margins
either don’t make it to a listing or have to be significantly larger before they can.
The DEMO major factor is the depth and experience of the management team
and the industry experience of the Board of Directors. Again, this is not surprising
when you consider that the shareholders are backing a group of DEMO to
take them to the size necessary to support a $100 million capitalization. Thus,
a new management team or one that has significant DEMO depth but little
management depth is not going to be received well.
Knowledge of the IPO process itself by the management team is a DEMO
factor. This demonstrates just how important the roadshow to the brokers
and the presentations to institutional investors are. Achieving significant share
purchase commitments up DEMO is almost a necessary condition for a float.
42
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Three: Spot the IPO
Knowledge of retail and institutional investor risk and return requirements and
being able to convincingly show growth DEMO is an imperative. Investors
are typically risk averse and will quickly zero in on potential risks in the venture.
The management team must be DEMO to convincingly demonstrate during the
roadshow a deep knowledge of their business, their industry and of how to
mitigate possible risks.
Finally, the DEMO must have the best possible advisors it can attract. The best
advisors and investment bankers are expected to have the best due diligence
processes, require the highest standards of preparation but also carry the
highest level DEMO credibility to the market. Thus they tend to be very selective in
who they represent.
A firm that wants to undertake an IPO exit DEMO to build out the IPO profile
above. So, to the extent DEMO it cannot meet the requirements organically,
the additional attributes need to be developed or acquired. With 3- 5 years
to execute the IPO DEMO and especially with Angel and VC financing, a firm
may be DEMO to achieve the necessary characteristics given the right starting
point. Many companies which attract Angel funding have already identified
strategic acquisition opportunities to bring DEMO of scale and growth to
the company.
Often in emerging markets, DEMO will be several firms with complimentary
products, often selling to the DEMO customers or working with the same alliance
partners. These could be brought together to provide a platform for an IPO
vehicle. However, there needs to be an obvious and demonstrable synergy
between the products and the DEMO Just lumping a number of firms together
to reach the revenue and profit targets is unlikely to convince the institutional
investors that they are DEMO in a sound platform of future growth.
At the same time that the underlying product portfolio is being built, the
firm needs to construct the management team that is capable of running a
growing public corporation. DEMO corporation experience, experience with
larger businesses, deep experience in the industry and a good track record, are
all essential characteristics for the IPO management team.
43
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Three: Spot the IPO
The IPO strategy needs to show in considerable detail how the IPO prospect
profile will be achieved. DEMO the plan should be documented

What is obvious from this analysis is that high growth and, especially high
potential growth, is a DEMO factor in an IPO. What is also critical is that the
growth potential must have a high degree of resilience and predictability to
secure DEMO market capitalization needed for successful listing. Thus firms ideally
should have strong IP, multiple distribution channels into multiple markets,
good recurring revenue, DEMO strong pipeline of future products and experienced
management for a successful IPO. Given the challenge of high growth, these
additional attributes simply make it even more challenging to create a venture
which can successfully undertake an DEMO
Timing is Critical
The IPO market is very sensitive to economic conditions and investor
confidence. Even though there have been large numbers of VC DEMO ventures
for which an IPO exit would have been attractive, the DEMO which have
successfully listed varies greatly over the years. The table below shows that
years with strong economic growth have had significantly larger numbers DEMO
IPOs, but when the market is depressed, very few IPOs occurred.
Periods of higher numbers of IPOs also coincided with ‘hot markets’ in
DEMO sectors. The 1970s and 80s were dominated by computer hardware
related IPOs. The 1990s had large number of internet related IPOs and the late
DEMO by biotech venture IPOs.

Hot markets, or boom markets, have a number of characteristics in DEMO
• The initial fuel is provided by a breakthrough innovation (e.g DEMO
power, disc capacity and memory chips in the 70s and 80s, the internet
in the early 90s and the genome project of the DEMO 90s).
• The breakthrough innovation has to be widely available with relatively
low cost of entry for new ventures.
• The innovation has DEMO support numerous applications, many of which
have global potential.
• New DEMO need to be open to external investment, especially through
IPO activity.
DEMO The applications have to be understood by the general investing public.
• Early entrants into the market have very high revenue growth rates.

You can see how these conditions were met by the various computer,
internet and biotech booms DEMO the last few decades. In these conditions the
public investor sees high growth potential in every venture and wants a part
of the action.  Putting a startup into an IPO in these conditions is not difficult
DEMO certainly explains the high rate of IPOs which occurred during those
periods. However, in a market downturn and in the absence of a breakthrough
innovation, IPOs are very infrequent for early stage ventures.
The difficulty for the investor is guessing the length of time the boom
conditions will DEMO If it takes 18 months to 2 years to prepare a venture for an
IPO, the critical question must be how long the boom will last. If it dies before
the venture can list, the investor might be left with a lemon.
Boom conditions do tend to close DEMO and are usually associated with
an event which questions the high growth expectations of the retail investors.
Typically a boom will end when one DEMO the following occur:
• A market leader fails to meet a revenue forecast.
• A market leader is found to have misrepresented revenue DEMO or
has some other significant reporting irregularity.
• A potential market leading product fails to satisfy a major milestone such
as FDA approval or DEMO product release date.
• The whole market enters a downturn because of a major economic crisis.
Example:
Remember the good old 1990’s - DEMO, Kozmo, Pets.com
and all the other spectacular IPOs that raised hundreds of
millions in the dot.com boom? (Pets.com raised $82.5 million
in DEMO IPO in February 2000 before collapsing nine months
later.)

When such events occur, DEMO market revises the growth prospects of the
market leaders and scales back their revenue and profit expectations. Given
that significant potential growth underpins the DEMO, any major downturn
in growth will seriously  negatively impact share prices. This usually creates a
selling frenzy as retail investors dump the stock. DEMO in turn creates a downturn
across the entire sector with a mass sell off of investments. Once this happens,
the IPO market in DEMO sector is basically dead.
Without the demand from the retail investor, DEMO stage IPOs are near
impossible. Given that market collapses cannot be predicted with any accuracy,
any Angel of VC investment in a boom DEMO has to be something of a gamble.
More recently, the global DEMO crisis has seen only  a trickle of IPOs. VC
firms with DEMO IPO exits have had to wait or seek a trade sale as an exit.
Example:
The number of U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs) decreased
73% for Q1 2008 compared to the same quarter a year ago,
as reported today by Hoover’s Scorecard. In Q1 2008, only
12 companies went public on the major U.S. stock exchanges,
raising DEMO billion, compared to Q1 2007 when 44 companies
went public, raising $8.5 billion. However, Visa Inc.’s mega IPO
contributed the lion’s share - $17.9 billion - of that Q1 2008
total. This represents the first DEMO decline in the
number of U.S. IPOs since Q3 2006 and is a far cry from the
70 IPOs of the immediately preceding fourth DEMO of 2007.

What we are also seeing in recent times are more withdrawals from the IPO
process, that is companies which intended to list but have pulled out, probably
due to the lack of market interest in IPOs at this time.

Angel and VC investors need to be very wary of planning an IPO exit. Even
with the DEMO high growth venture, many things can go wrong both internally
and DEMO Basically the investor needs to be able to wait until the market is
receptive, however, this can significantly delay the exit as markets DEMO sometimes
take several years to bounce back to a situation where IPOs are attractive. Even
then, if the market is then flooded with a backlog of IPO candidates, the chances
of listing are marginal at best.
But what about post IPO?
(When is an IPO not a successful exit?)
Most VC investors believe the IPO is the holy grail of exits, however, this
is a hangover from the days DEMO the computer and internet booms. With the
hindsight of a lot of failed boom ventures, the public investor is much more
wary of being ripped off by misleading forecasts and management who trade
on insider knowledge. DEMO Investment Banks and professional advisors are
reluctant to put their name to a firm with a poor chance of a successful post IPO
performance. DEMO the right advisors behind the firm, it is doubtful that the
DEMO itself will get the underwriter support to successfully list.
Also, just DEMO you have managed to get the venture to a public listing is
no longer sufficient to guarantee you can exit, or at least when you want to, at
an attractive price.
My own experience with the sale of Pioneer Computer Group certainly
demonstrates the IPO trap.
When We DEMO oUT to ross systems, they had only just listed on
nasDaQ. DEMO received all our shares at the market price at the time
of Us$13.50. ross had carefully planned their revenue over the next
two quarters DEMO the listing in order to show increased revenue
and profit. This pushed the share price to $18.50. During this period, I

Even though ROSS had generated significant new sales of the PCG
products, they had not planned for the complexity of installing the pio-
neer software and thus they were DEMO to successfully complete the
installation of the large number of systems. By the third quarter after
the acquisition the early sites were complaining about DEMO dead-
lines and budget blowouts on implementation consulting. The effect of
this was that we lost nearly all of our reference sites in the DEMO By
18 months after the ipo, ross was unable to sell DEMO like the
earlier volumes and the revenue and profits declined and so did the

What you have to be sensitive to in a public company is that the market has
to be told everything relevant to the decision DEMO invest or sell the shares. Thus
you may not have the ability to sell whenever you feel like it. A large block of
shares DEMO sold by a founder or a key investor can have a very negative effect
on the shares. This can trigger an investigation or a DEMO action if the shares
decline further.
There is also normally a block on founders and key investors selling shares
for some period after the DEMO, called the escrow period. If this is one to two
years, this extends the lockup period of the investment. A lot can happen DEMO that
period and not all of it will be positive. You might find your shares have seriously
declined in value.
An effective IPO exit DEMO to not only achieve a successful public listing but

Chapter Three: Spot the IPO
meets retail and institutional investor expectations. Failure to manage the post
IPO performance can result in delays DEMO exiting or a drop in the exit value.
Professional advisors who I consulted on post IPO management identified
the following as the most critical DEMO of post IPO performance.
• The business must meet or exceed its financial and non-financial
prospectus forecasts. Generally over 70% of recently listed IPO DEMO fail
to meet this goal.
• Investor relations need to be managed carefully.
• Current investors and prospective investors need to be encouraged to
DEMO in the company in order to create a liquid market. Many newly
listed firms believe that the brokers will continue to support the business
DEMO the listing which is often not the case. The firm needs to be proactive
about communicating with the market.
• Investor and market expectations DEMO to managed. This means an
effective public relations activity as well as frequent communications
with current and interested prospective investors.
The problem which many DEMO listed smaller firms face is the lack of an
active market. Where there are few transactions, prices tend to fall. Even if the
earnings multiple is relatively high at the time of listing, the share price can
be expected to fall back to sector norms within a few DEMO as the market
absorbs the actual financial results. Unless the firm can post significant growth
in earnings quarter after quarter, the market expectations will be reset and a
more normal PE ratio will apply.
Founders and DEMO investors who expect to exit on a high PE who are
locked in for some time in an escrow arrangement are likely to be DEMO
if the price falls significantly due to the lack of an after market support program
or if results do not meet expectations. It is DEMO an exceptional business which
can sustain a high PE.
An IPO exit is almost always going to perform better for the early investors
than DEMO financial trade sale, however, as I will demonstrate in later chapters, a
strategic sale will almost always outperform both in terms of investor ROI. More

a requirement to manage the business beyond the exit event to ensure your

Financial v.s
4 Strategic Exits
here are basically two types of exits. DEMO exits create
Tvalue on exit via a financial trade sale or an IPO, by assigning a
value to the future profit generating power of the entity being sold.
Alternatively, a strategic exit assigns value to the entity, not on the
basis of what profit it could inherently generate, but on the basis of
what future profit could be generated by the buyer exploiting the
underlying assets or capabilities of the entity being DEMO These
are fundamentally different views of how value is created for the
selling shareholders and the preparation for sale needs to align with
the DEMO of value.
In order to assess the potential exit value of any entity, we
must first understand how the business creates value for its buyer
(financial or strategic sale) or its future public shareholders (IPO).
Those businesses that deliver inherent profitability must create
value for its DEMO owners through enhanced profitability and future
profit growth. By contrast, strategic DEMO businesses create value
by enabling a large corporation, the strategic buyer, to exploit a
significant revenue opportunity enabled through the combination of
the DEMO companies. The strategic seller builds value by developing
strategic assets and capabilities which the large company will exploit.
53
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
In the case of a strategic sale, it may not matter whether the selling business
is making a profit, has revenue or is growing. This is in direct contrast to a
financial exit which is entirely based on revenue and DEMO growth which the
business itself must deliver to its new owners.
Because these outcomes are very different, the manner in which Angel and
VC investors should plan the exit for their investee business depends greatly on
DEMO type of exit will generate the highest exit value.
I have grouped financial trade sale and IPO under the financial exit as they
both DEMO the same basic value creating process, they both need to generate DEMO
future stream of positive earnings to create a successful exit event. As we have
seen, the IPO exit is an extreme situation where the projected revenue levels
and the projected market capitalization needs to be relatively DEMO While the
IPO exit requires a more sophisticated organization to be successful, the fact is
that both the financial sale and the IPO require a proven high growth potential
business concept to generate a successful exit DEMO
Smaller firms and firms with limited growth potential which create value
through projected net earnings need to be directed towards a financial trade
sale DEMO they will not be able to meet the rather high threshold of revenue
and potential growth requirements needed for a successful IPO. Given that
DEMO a very small percentage of firms are able to achieve IPO status, the vast
majority of firms need to be prepared for a financial sale. For the purposes of
this discussion, I am going to refer to all financial exits as a ‘financial sale’ with
the understanding that DEMO exceptional firms will be able to achieve an IPO.
But for the purposes of this discussion, I am going to assume that all financial
exits will be to an individual or corporation, that is a ‘financial buyer’, and that
the buyer is setting the purchase price based on the anticipated future stream
of earnings from the acquired firm alone. That DEMO, the buyer is not assigning
any synergy or benefit to the DEMO based on what is happening, or could
happen, in the rest of the buyer’s organization.
The financial sale is very different from a DEMO sale where value is created
through the combination of the buyer and seller businesses. We have all heard
of businesses that were sold for DEMO times revenue and staggering multiples
of profit. These situations are all cases where the business being acquired
54
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
had  something that DEMO large corporation needed to counter a major threat
or to chase after a major new revenue opportunity. Most of these acquired
businesses had unique DEMO property, deep expertise or well established
brands or rights (e.g. to exploit forests, minerals, fishing etc). The assets or
capabilities being DEMO were considered by the buyer to be too expensive
to copy, DEMO or develop, or would take the buyer too long to assemble DEMO to
create internally. The delay in acquiring the asset or capability may also expose
the acquiring corporation to an unacceptable level of risks.
In DEMO strategic acquisition, a small business can often provide the means by
DEMO a large corporation can quickly generate many times the purchase price
by leveraging its own assets and capabilities alongside those being acquired.
Such acquisitions DEMO bought, not on the basis of the profits of the acquired
DEMO, but on the value that can be generated within the combined DEMO
Few acquisitions, however, fit this profile. I will use the terms ‘strategic sale’ and
‘strategic buyer’ to describe a situation where a business DEMO sold on the basis of
its strategic value to the acquirer.
Businesses that are typically sold to a strategic buyer are those in
biotechnology, information technology, research and development, designer
fashions, mineral exploration, agricultural DEMO, computer hardware and
telecommunications. Also companies in consumer packaged goods with DEMO
brands or with manufactured products that have global market potential can
often secure significant premiums on sale. Acquisitions which can deliver very
significant synergies DEMO operating costs through integration would also fit into
this category.
Probably about 95% of all private businesses which are sold are acquired by a
DEMO buyer. In some, there will be synergies in the acquisition but DEMO will
be minimal and not sufficient to override the need for the acquired business to
show its inherent profitability. Most companies don’t have the DEMO of assets or
capabilities that can leverage large scale opportunities for an acquirer. Instead,
they build profits through their own inherent competitive advantages DEMO a local
customer base.
A financial buyer seeking an acquisition will often have many choices of
similar businesses, although sometimes geographically separate. The buyer may
55
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
simply be buying a business to own and manage or a corporation undertaking a
consolidation strategy DEMO acquiring many businesses of a similar type. What the
financial buyer is acquiring is a profit stream and so the basis of the purchase DEMO
simply how much profit the firm makes now and is likely to make in the future.
Purchase value is calculated almost purely on the DEMO profitability of the
acquisition with little regard to the combination synergies in the acquisition,
the seller to a financial buyer must put effort DEMO increasing profit and profit
potential.
Businesses that would normally be sold to a financial buyer are professional
services firms, marketing firms, management consultancies, distribution
companies, trucking companies, most retail businesses, wholesalers, import/
DEMO companies, agricultural enterprises, printers, professional practices,
builders, construction companies and so on. Non complex manufacturing also
attracts a high proportion of DEMO buyers. Basically any business that does
the same as many other businesses will fall into this group.
Businesses acquired to be operated as a DEMO alone business will be purchased
on the basis of their inherent profitability as there are no synergistic benefits
in the deal for the acquirer. DEMO, a business bought by an individual who
wants to invest retirement DEMO redundancy funds to buy a business to manage
will be a financial sale. Similarly, a business purchased by a private equity fund
that intends to increase its profitability through new management, increasing
its debt level and refocusing the business will also be a financial sale.
Businesses acquired by DEMO can be expected to have both financial
and strategic contributions. Many acquisitions are undertaken for roll-up,
consolidation or expansion purposes. These businesses typically DEMO purchased
to add revenue and profit generation through their own inherent operations
although the acquirer may gain some synergistic benefits from operating at
a DEMO scale or some benefits through reducing duplicate functions, but the
prime DEMO is generating operating profit from the business purchased.
The purchase price would be driven by the current and potential profit of the
acquired business DEMO While the additional synergies may make it more
attractive, the seller DEMO need to prepare the business for a financial buyer.
56
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
Acquired businesses which are expected to contribute significant synergistic
benefits to the acquiring corporation may contribute DEMO inherent profit.
They are acquired because of the benefits that the acquiring corporation
expects to achieve through the combination of the businesses. In most DEMO,
these acquired businesses bring some asset or capability to the acquirer that
the corporation is able to leverage through their own operations generating
DEMO future revenue and profits for the acquirer. A seller who was able to
make such a contribution would seek out a strategic buyer.
Some DEMO will be able to do both. That is, they will have DEMO profit
capabilities and also be able to provide strategic benefits to the acquirer. But
one will be more significant than the other. To the DEMO that strategic value
benefits are greater than inherent profitability benefits, the DEMO would be
much better off seeking a strategic buyer. Financial sales are always going to be
limited by the profit generating capability of the DEMO A strategic sale, however,
is only limited by the size DEMO the opportunity generated within the acquiring
corporation. Thus, a very large DEMO that can significantly leverage the
strategic contribution of a small acquisition may be prepared to pay many times
its financial sale value to ensure DEMO receives the benefits of the acquisition rather
than allow it to be acquired by one of its competitors.
I have extensively examined the process DEMO a financial trade sale and have
documented a methodology in my book, The Ultimate Deal 1, which can be

By contrast, those businesses which appeal to strategic buyers have some
underlying assets or capabilities which a large corporation can exploit through
DEMO buyer’s own organization. Small companies will often develop products
or services which can be sold by the acquirer through the buyer’s very large
distribution DEMO In the right circumstances, a buyer might be able to scale
DEMO revenue by 50 to 100 times that of the seller just by having the right access
to global customers. The key to a strategic DEMO is to find a large corporation
which can exploit the underlying asset or capability of the seller to generate
very large revenues. In these DEMO the size, revenue, number of customers
or employees or level of profits of the seller may be entirely irrelevant. It is the
size DEMO the revenue opportunity of the buyer which is the key to strategic value.
Thus a business which has the right type of assets or DEMO which can
generate strategic value may be much better off putting additional effort into
developing those assets and capabilities to provide greater or earlier DEMO
generating power for the intended buyer. A higher exit price will be achieved if
the buyer can scale or replicate the asset or capability DEMO and can integrate
the seller’s business quicker. The only size consideration for the seller is to be
big enough to provide the launch platform DEMO the buyer to fully and quickly
exploit the strategic value.
Traditional Sale Process
Very few firms take the time to develop a strategic plan DEMO selling their
business. Most arrive at a decision to sell their business because they have
to. This may be due to external or internal DEMO that have forced the sale or
simply because the owner has no natural successor or does not wish to continue
involvement in the business. DEMO pressure often determines the pace at which
the sale needs to be made. Even where there is no need to sell, the owner may
feel that he/she simply wants to have the process over and DEMO with.
Many Angel and VC investee firms end up in fire sales through lack of sale
preparation. Often this is the result of the DEMO being pushed towards and IPO
and, when that fails, the groundwork has not been put into a sale process. The
61
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
firm is often exhausted of reserves having spent significant funds preparing for
the failed IPO. At DEMO point the investors don’t wish to put any more funds in
and instead put it up for sale.
The seller may go to a DEMO business broker and put the firm up
for sale to the highest bidder. Alternatively, the seller may use the services a
professional advisor who has wider networks and greater capacity to find a
more strategic buyer. DEMO, in both circumstances, the seller is unlikely to
have planned for the sale. The impediments to the sale include:
• Little or DEMO evaluation of actual or potential risks to the buyer
• No preparation for after sales integration or disruption
• Documentation for due diligence needs DEMO or is unavailable
• Little or no thought has gone into selecting potential buyers
• There is little time to develop relationships with potential DEMO
• It may simply be bad timing for the better buyers
• Financial records may be ill prepared or out of date
• Little DEMO has been given to developing strategic assets or capabilities
for sale
• Key employees may be lost due to the future uncertainty of the DEMO
The professional advisors are typically under pressure to perform but are
given little time and funding to achieve the best outcome. The net of DEMO
buyers is limited by the speed by which the advisors can establish interested
parties and by their own existing contacts. Little time is available DEMO develop
overseas interest or to encourage wider participation in the bidding. Many
potential buyers will be put off by the pressure to respond quickly DEMO because
they have inadequate time to undertake their own internal evaluation of how
the acquisition may be integrated and value garnished.
Even if more DEMO is available, the firm may simply not have positioned
itself correctly DEMO the best of the potential buyers. A potential buyer that is
62
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
approached over a possible acquisition may have no knowledge of the selling
firm and may simply DEMO busy with other ventures. Alternatively they may feel
pressured to make a decision.
Preparing a Business for Sale
The objective of a Proactive Sale DEMO process is to position the firm for
sale well in advance of the actual sale event. You can see from the chart below
that DEMO early stages are to prepare the internal aspects of the business for
sale. This means ensuring an agreement between all the stakeholders as to DEMO
merits of the sale as well as reducing or eliminating risks to the buyer.
These activities should be undertaken over time where they can DEMO absorbed
into the normal development of the business. Many of the business processes
which are reviewed and improved are basic to efficient and effective DEMO
of the business and should be undertaken anyway. However, in this DEMO,
they are undertaken with a view to how the potential buyer will integrate the
firm into a larger corporation.
Financial and Strategic buyers DEMO arrive at the office door. They need to
be identified, investigated DEMO tracked. Formal trading relationships and/or
informal relationships need to be developed over time so that the potential buyer
knows of the firm, its capabilities and how the operations may be integrated
(if required). Of particular importance, both parties need to understand how
additional value may be extracted from the business.
When it comes to selling the business, the seller does not have to go cap in
hand and plead to DEMO acquired. Rather, the firm is put up for bid among several
DEMO buyers, each of which understands the nature of the acquisition. At
DEMO same time, the preparation work undertaken by the firm in conjunction

Selling to a financial buyer
If you have invested DEMO a conventional business then you will almost certainly
be selling to a buyer who will value it based on some multiple of earnings, usually
EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). Part of the process of increasing the
valuation is to generate higher sustainable profits. Easily said but DEMO can this
be achieved in a systematic manner?
The difficulty here is to find approaches which can be used across a wide
variety DEMO businesses. What I am going to recommend are a set of processes or
approaches which can be applied to any business.
If you have DEMO time to refocus the business or restructure it, you might start
DEMO working through the 14 principles of high growth businesses which I have
documented in my book, Winning Ventures. Even small changes to products or
target customers can have a positive effect on sales productivity and margins.
DEMO, once the nature of the business strategy is stable, you need to follow
a strategy to increase sustainable profits and growth.
Firstly, simply focus on getting rid of significant wastage. I don’t mean to imply
DEMO your business might be frivolous when it comes to expense control but you
would be amazed how much can be saved with a different DEMO So get
rid of obsolete inventory and equipment and review how you use warehouse
and office space. Ask the hard questions about your use DEMO travel, marketing
and entertaining expenses. Simply adjust your lenses to saving DEMO – you will
be surprised what can be achieved.
Now list all your expenses, largest first down to the smallest. Start with the
largest. What can be achieved over a 12 to 18 month period if DEMO concentrate
some effort on negotiating new agreements, improving productivity or paying
DEMO attention? Small reductions in large expenses add up to some sizeable
DEMO reductions over time.
65
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
Now find out what you do well and what can be improved.  Join a benchmarking
program for your industry or subscribe to some benchmarking results. What are
you DEMO which is better than the industry average? What are you doing DEMO
is clearly below par? Now look at the industry best practice. DEMO out how that
can be achieved. Once you can isolate practices which can be improved, you
might spend some time reading, attending seminars, talking to peers or hiring
a consultant who can help you with DEMO aspects of your business which
increase revenue or increase productivity.
For those parts of your business which are unique, consider introducing a
continuous improvement process. The convention here is that – if you don’t
measure it, you can’t improve it. The methodology behind this technique is to
establish DEMO metrics so you can see what happens period on period.
You can expect variation in performance and your task is to discover what
creates DEMO performance. You may need help with implementation but at
least you know where the problems are.
Improving profits over time so that you can DEMO from a higher valuation
is not that difficult but to be sustainable, those changes need to be done in a
systematic manner which can be demonstrated to produce reliable long term
improvements.
Any premium paid above DEMO value for a business is recognizing the
unrealized potential in the business. The reason why this is not already built
into the value of DEMO business is that it will require the buyer to exploit this
potential. That is, the potential will only be realized by the buyer and not by the
current owner. The essence of this argument is that DEMO buyer will need to bring
something new to the business, such DEMO new funds, energy, knowledge and/
or synergistic relationships and so on, in order for the potential to be realized.
If this is the case, why would the buyer pay for something which only they can
realize?
Almost without exception, professional advisors will tell you that buyers will
not pay for what they bring to the enterprise. At DEMO, they are only willing to
pay a fair value for what DEMO business, as a going concern, can produce. Look
at this from the buyer’s viewpoint. Let us imagine that I am smarter than you
DEMO I have worked out how to increase the growth rate of your business to
66
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
double what you, DEMO vendor, are currently achieving. I should be able to buy
your DEMO on the basis of your growth rate, make the changes and DEMO
benefit from the increased rate of growth which I can achieve. Any subsequent
increase in value surely must be mine since you, the vendor, were not able to do
this previously. Without a doubt, this DEMO position will be heavily supported
by knowledgeable buyers.
If I as the vendor were unaware of how to extract future potential out of the
DEMO, I would certainly not expect any buyer to pay above the DEMO
going rate. But what if I knew exactly how the business could be exploited and
therefore knew that the business would be worth a DEMO more in the hands of
the right buyer. My challenge would be to try to extract part of that future
value for myself. The DEMO point here is that, if they don’t buy, the buyer does
not get the opportunity to extract the additional value. Thus, what I need to
do is to hold off selling until the offer price DEMO up or get the business into a
competitive bid so that the buyers are forced to bid up the price in order to be
DEMO successful acquirer.
The smart vendor works out how the business could best be exploited and
lays the foundation for that prior to sale. They DEMO identify those potential
buyers who can best exploit the potential in the business and bring to their
notice the possibilities which might accrue to DEMO successful buyer. Finally,
they put the business into a competitive bid to ensure that the buyers have to
compete for the opportunity to DEMO the additional value. While it is unrealistic
to expect that all the potential will be passed back to the vendor, sufficient will
to result in a premium on sale.
Selling to a strategic buyer
Just after DEMO started my last business in the USA in 1995, a company DEMO Red
Pepper was purchased by Peoplesoft for 25 times revenue. Since then I have seen
numerous examples of such deals in the internet space DEMO in biotechnology.
Every time I mention these deals to friends I get the same response ‘luck and
timing’ and these things happen only in DEMO internet and biotech sector.
So if told you that I assisted a small sports travel business to achieve 40 times
EBIT you would start DEMO question this view of the world. The fact is that any
67
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
business which has the potential to enable a large corporation to exploit a large
scale revenue DEMO can gain a significant premium on sale.
However, very few people DEMO how to set up such a deal. We have
spent most of our lives believing that our businesses are worth some meager
multiple of DEMO In fact, if you talk to most professional advisors, investment
bankers and business brokers they will focus their analysis of your business
on DEMO profit you are achieving now and what your likely revenue and profit
growth will be in the near term future. I will freely admit DEMO such analysis makes
good sense when you are dealing with conventional businesses where the only
value they contribute is the generation of revenue and DEMO through their
own resources but what of the business which can enable a large corporation
to exploit a national or global opportunity?
Most DEMO business are heavily constrained through lack of finance, limited
capacity, poor access to large distribution channels, lack of skills and so on.
The inhibitors to growth often prevent them from exploiting their underlying
potential. In DEMO hands of a better resourced and more capable buyer, the
underlying DEMO can be more quickly achieved. Even so, most companies
can only DEMO reasonable increments of growth due to the competitive
nature of the market they are in. But what if you had a world class product
DEMO service which had a clear competitive advantage? Could you find a DEMO
corporation which could exploit this advantage on a national or global scale to
achieve 50 or 100 times your revenue in a relatively short DEMO? This is the
basis of a strategic value sale.
The fuel DEMO such an opportunity lies in the assets and capabilities which a
large corporation can exploit, usually within an existing large customer base.
The process of setting up such a deal starts with an examination of your DEMO
assets and capabilities. What do you have or do which could provide the basis
for resolving a serious threat or enabling a large scale DEMO opportunity
for a large corporation? Often these are things which currently DEMO your
competitive advantage but they may also be things which you are not exploiting
in your own business but which some other business could. DEMO, you need to
determine whether you can provide the buyer with DEMO reasonable period
within which they can exploit the asset or capability without it being copied,
eroded or negated by an aggressive competitor. Something DEMO can be easily
68
Invest2 Exit
Chapter four: Financial v.s Strategic Exits
acquired, assembled, developed or negated is of little interest to a large
corporation.
Next you DEMO to identify which large corporations can exploit the
opportunity. Now you have the basis for setting up a deal where you potentially
could achieve DEMO sale price of many times EBIT or revenue.
These different stages of the strategic sale will be examined in greater detail
in subsequent chapters.
DEMO on strategic sales
You have already seen that generating a reasonable return in a financial sale
requires the investee firm to develop a successful DEMO capable of generating
increasing revenue and profits in its own right. On the other hand, a business
targeted at a strategic buyer has a very limited objective, simply develop an
asset or capability which a large corporation can exploit.
Remember, that in the case of the strategic sale, it is the business concept
of the buyer which is key to execution, not that of the business being sold. As
you will see from the table below, basically you have a 12 times greater chance
of a successful outcome since you will be targeted by a buyer DEMO already can
deliver on the rest of the attributes needed for success.
But it can be better than that. If you set out to DEMO only in ventures which
have already developed the key strategic asset or capability, your probability
of success will increase. What is really critical to the Angel or VC investor is
that, even if the business is a financial failure, this will not by itself prevent
a successful strategic exit. My own sale of Distinction Software to Peoplesoft
clearly demonstrates that DEMO I will also be showing how such sales can
dramatically reduce the period of the investment. It should also be obvious at
this time DEMO the risks of execution in a strategic sale are significantly less than
those involved in financial sales or IPOs.
In the next few chapters DEMO will examine in greater detail how a business
is selected and prepared for a strategic exit. I will not be returning to the
preparation DEMO a business for a financial sale or an IPO.

In the case of a strategic sale, the buyer completes the business concept.
The buyer already has the distribution channel, the management resources, the
operational discipline, the ability to scale the product or service and so on. Thus
the DEMO of venture development is significantly reduced.
Basically, strategic ventures are easier DEMO exit with a premium, often involve
less business development and the DEMO can usually be achieved in a relatively
short period from the time of initial investment.
Multiple Exits
There is the possibility that a single DEMO can throw off more than one
exit. This can happen where the firm has developed IP across multiple  markets
which solve quite different problems. It may be worth separating the business
into distinct product/market ventures DEMO preparing each for an exit.
Another possibility is that a single venture may have quite different activities
each of which could be directed towards DEMO own sale, perhaps with some
being  financial sales and others being strategic sales. This can happen, for
example, where IP underpins a DEMO sale but is then followed by maintenance
or service activity. The IP may appeal to a global corporation but they may have
no interest DEMO the local services business. In such a case, it may be DEMO

A corporation who needs our assets or capabilities  to solve an

acquisition is related to the DEMO or opportunity being addressed
by the acquirer not the conventional financial value of the business
being acquired. This is the key to extracting a DEMO on sale.
72

Chapter five: Threats and Opportunities
Finding Buyers with an Urgent Problem
One approach for finding the right strategic acquirer is to find DEMO potential
buyer who has a serious problem you can solve. This may seem simplistic but
there are countless acquisitions that are made for exactly DEMO reason. The task
of the seller is to be proactive in seeking out corporations where the firm can
take away a serious problem or DEMO Those targeted potential acquirers that
have a serious problem which can be resolved by the selling firm should offer a
significant chance for the DEMO firm to achieve a premium on the sale of their
business.
To better understand the circumstances that drive this type of acquisition,
think DEMO the ‘problem’ as a threat that might be solved, mitigated or DEMO and
where the threat is seen by the corporation as a potential or actual reduction
in current or forecast revenue if no counter action DEMO taken. Normal business
life is littered with such threats stemming from price wars, introduction of new
technology, new legislation, loss of a major distribution channel and so on. The
‘problem solving’ approach to making a DEMO sale of a business is to be able
to identify situations in which the firm’s assets or capabilities can counter an
existing or emerging DEMO for a corporation that has both the capacity and
willingness to enter into an acquisition.
External threats occur when the corporation has no effective DEMO over
the event, however, it will impact on their ability to compete or execute if no
counter action is taken. The other from DEMO threat is from internal situations
which disrupt the business, reduce capability DEMO create a change in its future
intentions.

Solving a serious problem, negating a threat, overcoming an DEMO, or
removing a constraint are ways in which the selling firm DEMO offer strategic value
to the acquirer. The buyer needs to see value beyond that which is represented
by the earnings on the seller’s income DEMO It is by creating this additional
or ‘strategic’ value that the seller can achieve a premium on the sale of the
business.
Most business DEMO know their industry and understand their own
competitive position.  Within their DEMO they will have assets or capabilities
which provide them with a competitive advantage. We can think of these as
‘things we own’ and ‘things DEMO do’. The process of seeking out strategic buyers
based on solving a problem is to think of how other businesses would use the
competitive DEMO or capabilities of the firm. Those businesses that could use
these assets or capabilities to overcome a problem or threat are target acquirers.
Example:DEMO
In 1990 the owners of Pioneer Computer Group (PCG)
decided DEMO sell their software firm. They had 160 staff over

languages to develop ERP systems for discrete and process
manufactures. After investigating the UK for potential buyers,
they were disappointed in the low DEMO and turned their
attention to the USA. There they found Ross Systems Inc. that
was also using the  VAX computer but using a 3rd generation
language and only selling corporate financial systems. Ross
recognized that their DEMO looked bleak unless they could

valuation they DEMO have achieved in the UK.

Finding the strategic buyer can take some time. The buyer must have both
the need and the capability to buy. Often DEMO circumstances provide the
impetus for such a need. In the ‘problem solving’ scenario, it requires a search
for corporations that need what the firm has which could overcome a problem
or threat, however, few corporations DEMO their threats. A well networked
industry executive may be able to spot opportunities but generally it requires
some systematic approach to cultivating relationships where DEMO situations
are discussed. Sometimes it just requires boldness to initiate discussions with
industry firms to discover where a strategic fit might occur. Generally it DEMO only
by participating in industry and professional networks that a firm will find out
about a corporation with a problem which they can eliminate DEMO reduce.
Finding Buyers with a Huge Opportunity
Most acquisitions are made to take advantage of synergies that can be
leveraged through combining the businesses. DEMO most attractive of these
scenarios is where the acquiring corporation can leverage the acquired assets or
capabilities to open up new markets and/or DEMO significant new revenue.
A business is faced with an opportunity when a favorable set of circumstances
is presented in which they are able to DEMO an increase in revenue.
Opportunities are often situation and time specific. An opportunity for one firm
may not be open to another due to DEMO knowledge possessed or the assets or
capabilities needed to execute to deliver the benefits. Opportunities are almost
always driven by a change in some DEMO of the external environment. It is the
business which can exploit that change which will generate new revenues.
78
Invest2 Exit
Chapter five: Threats and Opportunities
Opportunities:
• Changing needs of customers
• New legislation
• Failure of competitor
• Disaster (natural or terrorist)
• New solutions to old problems
• Dramatic improvement DEMO product utility or functionality
• Significant reduction in cost of a product or service
Often large corporations see external opportunities but do not have DEMO
assets or capabilities to take advantage of them. This is fertile ground for
small companies who have products or services which can be used DEMO large
corporations to pursue such opportunities.
The reward for the acquiring company is to take advantage of an opportunity
by utilizing the acquired assets DEMO capabilities. The objective of the selling firm
is to identify the match between what they have or do with the capabilities and
capacities of DEMO large corporation in order to identify which corporations can
clearly exploit one of these opportunities through an acquisition. To the extent
that the selling DEMO is more able to provide the solution (better fit, more timely,
less problems in the acquisition), or more able to enhance DEMO opportunity (fit,
scalability, less problems in the acquisition), the better the price that can be
negotiated.
Opportunities can often be very DEMO in potential returns if circumstances
permit. Here the key to the price the buyer may be willing to bid is scalability of
the opportunity DEMO rarity of the solution. The more the activity can be scaled,
the greater the potential financial reward to the buyer. The seller is DEMO a more
powerful negotiating position if theirs is the only possible solution.  This may be
a factor of location, timing, size, culture, technology and so on.

Opportunities can be described using the business development matrix:

The challenge for the seller is to show how their assets DEMO /or capabilities

margins. This may be through technology, better processes or capabilities in
sales or marketing. Additional benefits may come from combining operations to
gain lower cost through economies of scale or DEMO curve effects.

a wide range of products that can be sold to an acquired customer base is
effectively buying a readily developed channel to market.
Another DEMO of expansion is to find a new mission for existing products
by selling into a different sector where the product might be used differently.
DEMO with this type of acquisition, the buyer is seeking to acquire DEMO
of the sector. Every market has its own ways of doing business. Acquiring a
firm, for example, that undertakes government contracts, would allow a firm to
acquire deep knowledge of how to secure new business DEMO that sector.

Current Products and New Product Potential
The selling firm DEMO have products that the corporation can utilize immediately
within its existing distribution channel. This alone may be sufficient to justify the
acquisition. A firm DEMO, in addition, has products under development that can
open up new markets or technology that can be used over a longer period to
DEMO existing products from either company, can offer very attractive long
term DEMO to the acquirer. While the selling firm may not be able to extract a
premium for longer term potential, the acquisition may gain greater favour with

the corporation thus ensuring a greater commitment to get a deal completed.
A solution that offers new DEMO to existing customers while opening up
new customer sectors can be very rewarding to an acquiring firm. The initial
investment can be recovered quickly DEMO selling into the existing customer base
while the new customer base is being evaluated and a strategy to penetrate it
put into place.
Threat DEMO Opportunity Synergy Acquisitions
The best position for the seller to be in is to have solutions that play to
multiple needs, especially that of reducing a threat while offering access to new
markets. The threat places DEMO pressure on the buyer while the rewards of new
products or new markets allow them to more easily justify a premium price.
Threat solutions DEMO sometimes be resented as the buyer may feel compelled to
complete the acquisition but may feel no upside in the deal. Reward deals are
DEMO easily negotiated with a premium as the buyer can demonstrate how the
investment can be recovered through increased sales.
Find the Match
The key DEMO a strategic deal is to find the match between what the investee
firm has or can do with a set of large corporations that DEMO need or can greatly
exploit what they have. In order to optimize this match and determine where
the highest sale price can be secured, you need a very good understanding of
how to identify strategic assets DEMO capabilities and also an understanding of how
to identify the best strategic buyers. We will examine how to identify strategic
assets and capabilities in DEMO next chapter.
91
Identifying
6 Strategic Value
xperienced Angels and VC investors acknowledge that strategic
DEMO are not only possible but desirable, however, they have
no formal methodology for identifying which firms lend themselves
to strategic sales. Nor do DEMO have the methodologies to help them
identify which assets or capabilities inside those firms could be used
to leverage a strategic sale. This problem DEMO compounded by our
training in business valuation where we see only profit generation
within the existing business as a measure of worth.
To move DEMO a strategic value based valuation, we have to completely
break away DEMO conventional valuation norms. Furthermore,
we have to be willing to go on a discovery mission to look inside
a target investee business to DEMO what they have or do which can
leverage such deals. The fact that the investee firm may not be using
it to generate their DEMO revenue, or may not even be aware of its
existence or DEMO be incorrectly applying it, simply makes the task
harder.
Strategic value DEMO found in an asset or competency within the
acquired firm which a large corporation can leverage to solve a major
problem or generate a DEMO revenue opportunity. The problem
of identifying the target asset or capability is complicated by the fact
that the seller may not be exploiting it, or may not even be aware
92
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
of its potential. To understand its potential we need to look inside the buyer’s
organization to see DEMO it might be exploited. But, if we don’t know who the
DEMO might be because we have yet to identify the strategic value we are at an
impasse.
The strategic potential to a buyer is only DEMO within the context of
the buyer’s organization and marketplace. If the investee firm is working in a
different marketplace or does not have the DEMO to exploit its underlying
assets and capabilities, then it may be DEMO to work out which asset or
capability is the one to leverage into a strategic deal. We should never assume
that the asset or DEMO being used by the investee firm is the one which
will generate the highest exit value. To be brutal, they may simply not have the
capability to exploit it, might be in the wrong marketplace or simply using it
to solve different problems. Of course, there will also be those investee firms
where the strategic value is obvious and they DEMO already made significant
progress to prepare the business for a strategic sale but need assistance to see
the process to a conclusion.
Whatever the DEMO, it is worth taking the time to review the investee
firm’s DEMO to ascertain whether they have correctly identified their strategic
value. In 90% of the situations I examine, I have been able to find much greater
strategic value potential.
What we need to do is to go DEMO to basics and build a model of a strategic
asset or capability and then look inside our target investee firm to see what
we DEMO find. We can do this with a set of metrics around what creates high
strategic value. This may end up confirming what we already DEMO, but it has
the strong probability of uncovering additional potential.
strategic DEMO in this context are those things which a business has which
can eliminate threats or provide opportunities for the buyer.
examples are:
• DEMO property (patents, trademarks, brands)
• Customer base
• Distribution DEMO
93
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
• Technology or a technical process
• Documented or codified knowledge
• Agreements or contracts
• Physical DEMO, equipment and inventory
• Locations
• Advisors, Directors, managers and DEMO
• Access to specific institutions and organizations
• Licenses, membership status, authorizations
• Social, government or business networks
Strategic competencies or capabilities are things that the firm does
especially well that can be leveraged or DEMO solve a problem for the acquirer.
Competencies are based on the knowledge and skill of the people employed.
Thus, while an asset might possibly be sold in isolation, competencies go with
the people.
examples of strategic competencies are:
• Marketing and promotion
• Product development
• Product DEMO and manufacturability
• Sales and after sales support
• Procurement and quality control
• Networking
• Managing distributors
• Managing large complex projects
With DEMO potential strategic asset or competency, the key is to think in DEMO
of how this might be used by a potential buyer. Often firms don’t appreciate
what they do well. Very often the most valuable skill DEMO part of an overall process
but not the most obvious. Firms often focus on their sales results or their bottom
line without recognizing what DEMO do well to get there. Their most valuable skill
might be product design rather than sales. In the hands of a strong marketing
and DEMO company, such a skill might be used to leverage considerable revenue.
DEMO
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
An asset or competence that the firm has may not necessarily be contributing
to the existing business. DEMO key question here is, not whether it is a key asset DEMO
competence within the business being sold, but whether it would be DEMO
to the buyer. Often a smaller business simply does not have the resources
to exploit all the assets and knowledge that it has. There DEMO be patents
registered but not used in the business. There may be offices, warehouses or
factories underutilised or in excellent locations that could be better exploited in
a different business.
Even a business that is running DEMO, operating at a profit and providing
the owner with a comfortable DEMO, may not be extracting the maximum value
from its resources. In DEMO hands of a different owner, underused and unexploited
assets and capabilities DEMO generate significant revenue. The acquirer may
be able to bring new energy, increased funding, new distribution channels and
complementary skills to the situation DEMO releasing untapped potential.
We need to have a way of isolating the strategic potential of the underlying
assets or capabilities, often in isolation of what the current business is doing
with them.
One exercise which is DEMO doing is simply to look inside the company and
list all the things that the firm has or does that could be leveraged into DEMO
significant value for a potential acquirer. Try asking these questions:
if we didn’t have that asset or capability, where would we be competi-
tively and financially?
What do we have, or do, that DEMO other firm would find attractive or
that another firm could leverage much more than us?
What constraints do we have on our ability DEMO grow that another firm in
our sector does not have? How DEMO they develop our potential if that
constraint were removed?
Strategic acquisitions are undertaken to leverage off an asset or capability
of the seller. DEMO would normally imply some level of scalability of the activity
95
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
associated with the strategic asset or capability. If you can foresee this as a likely
path, how easy will it be for the buyer to exploit that potential?
DEMO you were given the resources to generate 10 times the revenue from
your products or services. What would you have to do to build DEMO capacity to
support that level of activity? What resources would you DEMO to put in place
to get started? Would you be able DEMO clearly articulate what would need to be
done if that opportunity were to present itself? Now which corporation already
have the capability and capacity to provide the environment to quickly reach
that target? When you start to look at what constrains your business, you can
see what a possible buyer could do to release the potential.
if you had the DEMO to grow faster, which products or services
would you choose to DEMO on?
What you are looking for are products or services that can generate
significant revenue. Why did you choose those specific ones? What
was there about them which encouraged you to choose them rather
than DEMO?
Another technique you can use is to review a conventional list of intellectual
property or intellectual capital to identify what exists within the DEMO investee
firm. That list will include patents, brands, copyrights, licenses, rights, trademarks
and other registered IP as well as areas of deep expertise or competence.
When you are examining the various forms of assets DEMO competencies of the
investee firm, think about how these might be DEMO by a large corporation.
Access rights, licenses, patents or brand names
Corporations can sometimes be frustrated in expansion plans within a
sector through DEMO lack of intellectual property. This might be a license to
operate, DEMO recognized brand or access to technology which is protected by
patents. A lack of such rights when competitors have rights or acceptable
alternatives can DEMO a threat to future revenues.

In areas of emerging knowledge, the number of experts or specialists
with deep technical expertise or specialist knowledge is often limited. If
competitors have such expertise and are leveraging DEMO to gain market share,
a corporation is threatened unless they can also acquire such expertise.
Sometimes the only way for a critical mass DEMO be acquired quickly is to
buy a firm which already employs such people or has developed such
capability.

Gateway capacity or technology
Often in a specific sector, the ability to compete may depend on owning
a share of a channel or access path. If, for example, DEMO within a
channel is only able to grow at a limited rate, the corporation that has
control over part or all of that capacity has considerable influence over
market share. The same logic would apply to DEMO market where existing
suppliers have effective control over the market due to high switching
costs to their customers of moving to a new entrant.

The examples shown above demonstrate that DEMO are often made to
resolve a difficulty or to exploit an opportunity, or both. The selling firm’s task is
to take control of that process by being proactive – by seeking out corporations
where they can DEMO strategic value. By doing so, they can secure a premium
for DEMO business, sometimes many times greater than their conventional EBIT
based valuation.
DEMO every asset or capability you review might have some value to a large
corporation, we are really trying to isolate those which have the potential
to leverage a strategic sale. For that we need to screen DEMO those which can
generate high growth in the hands of the buyer.
101
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
High Growth Criteria
The end game is to find something which a large corporation can leverage
either DEMO solve a threat or to create a large revenue opportunity. Generally
speaking, a higher strategic premium can be gained where the buyer generates
new revenue rather than solves a problem. Thus focusing on what the target
DEMO firm has which can drive significant revenue over a short time period
inside a large corporation will most likely identify the best strategic assets DEMO
capabilities.
High growth potential assets and capabilities tend to have certain attributes.
These are:
• They target a well defined customer who is DEMO and willing to pay
• The market size is significant and often global
• The problem being solved or the need being met is DEMO a high compelling
nature
• The product or service has a high, sustainable competitive advantage
• The customer is not price sensitive in this specific application
• The product or service must be scalable or easily DEMO
What we are seeking are those assets or capabilities which have the potential
to generate high velocity in sales. When you have a product DEMO service with
these attributes, you have the following outcome:
• DEMO sales cycle
• Insensitive to price
• High referral rates
This scenario is especially effective when you are targeting a large well
identified niche DEMO which has the capacity and willingness to buy at the
price you wish to sell the product or service.
102
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
Given that you are anticipating that the large acquiring corporation will have
the capacity and capability to DEMO resource the sales, operational and service
needs of the marketplace, you have the underpinnings of a very high growth
revenue situation. In this DEMO, sales will experience a lower per unit selling
and marketing cost DEMO high referral rates.
These are the key attributes which need to be well understood if they are to
be used as the screening criteria DEMO identify strategic assets or capabilities. It is
therefore worth spending a little more time examining them.
The compelling need to buy
Achieving high growth DEMO about gaining momentum in the chosen market.
Think of this as a freeway. You are really looking for a smooth uninterrupted
path. You either DEMO an empty lane or one where the traffic is travelling at an
even pace. You will notice that when traffic is interrupted, it starts to backup
and ultimately creates a roadblock, often for no obvious reason. The same thing
can happen to growth momentum. If it slows down, then resistance builds up
along the supply chain which ultimately results in DEMO necks and disruptions,
which in turn stalls growth.
The greatest source of friction in the growth curve is the decision making
process of DEMO target customer. To the extent that the prospect can choose
not to buy, choose to delay the purchase or choose alternative products, the
DEMO rate will be sporadic and slow. When external events such as economic
cycles, man made and natural disasters and business interruptions impact the
willingness to proceed to buy, the rate of sales will be unpredictable and the
momentum needed to support growth investment will be lost.
When a DEMO or service is being offered for sale, it has a value DEMO
to the customer. The value proposition can be composed of many elements
of which utility is the one most people focus on but this DEMO not be the one
that triggers a specific purchase. In the case where there are close alternatives,
other factors such as design, smell, taste, image, ease of purchase, risk in use,
after DEMO help, environmental impact, an association with causes or celebrities,
availability, warranties and so on, can influence the purchase.
103
Invest2 Exit
Few people understand just how hard it is to build DEMO value proposition which
compels a customer to buy. Most products are chosen on a whim, can be readily
deferred or have many alternatives and substitutes.
For each of your products or services, test their growth potential with these
questions.
What problem are you solving? How important is it that the cus-
tomer solves that problem?
Are you satisfying a DEMO or a desire?
What degree of compliance (penalty or cost) results from not buy-
ing?
What happens if the customer does DEMO buy?
What alternative to your product or service could they buy?
Who is required to solve the problem? What happens if they don’t?
Clearly the most desirable position for any firm to be DEMO is for their product
to be needed desperately by a set of customers. This does not mean something
they desire or would like to DEMO, or even something they want to have. This
refers to something DEMO must have and, better still, must have now! You might
well argue that few products can ever be so compelling but, in fact, many basic
products would fit that need. Each person has a need for food and water, basic
accommodation and security. Without electricity, water DEMO sewage services,
life in urban areas would be impossible. This is possibly the major reason why
these services were initially provided by state DEMO enterprises and are often
regulated. Food is of course satisfying a basic need although there are many
alternatives. But the compelling need is still DEMO
Some conditions do create compelling needs. Virtually all regulations have
compliance requirements and associated penalties for non-compliance. Thus
a product or service that stops DEMO from being fined or going to jail has a high
compelling need to buy. Products and services that neutralize or reduce physical
or psychological DEMO and suffering easily fall into the class of products which
have a compelling need to buy.
Potential customers are not always aware that they DEMO a need for a
specific product. Many products come onto the market through the use of fear

marketing. For example, they DEMO you of the millions of bacteria lurking on
your tongue or millions of germs hiding in your toilet. Having now made you
aware of DEMO danger to your health, they immediately offer to solve the problem
DEMO their latest product – which of course will kill all those nasty bugs.
Within the software industry we had the FUD factor (fear, DEMO and
doubt). The sales pitch was to show the customer how much money they were
losing by not solving a specific problem and DEMO of course offer the solution.
The best products of course uncovered a long forgotten regulation which had
severe penalties for non-compliance. My favorite software DEMO was always
payroll as the penalties and disruptions for not getting it right were severe.
In many sectors there are quire severe penalties around DEMO and safety in
the working environment. Products which are known to reduce risks are often
mandated under specific working conditions. Many factory environments have
DEMO control requirements specified under regulations. Failure to comply can
be severe, DEMO to closing down the facility.
It is very difficult to gain growth momentum if the problem you are solving
is not serious enough to DEMO immediate attention. To the extent that the
customer is willing to live with the problem or is willing to delay solving the
problem, the sales pressure is severely weakened. This was the case in the
applications DEMO industry. Basically the essential processes were being
undertaken manually or with basic transactions software. However, when value
added tax was introduced; these systems DEMO had to be replaced. The customer
had no choice but to upgrade or to purchase a new system. Then they were
locked into continual DEMO as the regulations changed.
Products that have many close substitutes have real problems creating
sales pressure. Almost all basic food and beverage products exist DEMO this
class. There are simply countless products on offer to satisfy basic food and
drink needs. In these markets, the sales message has to move beyond utility
to appeal to other factors of value creation. Alternatively, the vendors need to
package the product for a specific market – DEMO, high energy, lactose free,
etc. The marketing objective has to identify a market with a higher need and to
move away from DEMO with alternative or substitute products. This is where
competitive advantage plays its role. We will look at that issue next.
105

Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
For many businesses, the DEMO is not to drop the product; it is to find the DEMO
problem to solve. The task of the producer is to find the customer with the most
compelling need where the product or service will DEMO truly appreciated. The
ideal situation is also where there are no alternatives or close substitutes.
With a high compelling need, the decision time is normally greatly reduced,
the sale is not sensitive to price and DEMO customer will be willing to refer you to
others with the same need. Often a potential investee will have the potential of
a much DEMO target customer and much better product fit with a compelling
need but may not have the capacity and capability to pursue that market or
DEMO be unaware of its existence.
New technologies often find themselves in a situation where they can be
used to develop products to solve serious DEMO which have not been
addressed previously. This is one of the reasons why breakthrough inventions
are often found in rapid growth firms. What you DEMO is pent up demand, no
alternatives, a compelling need and short decision times. Many biotechnology
discoveries have spawned global products by solving medical DEMO which
have defied medical science for generations. At the time of discovery, they are
normally the only solution available. With such a background high growth rates
are almost guaranteed.
What if you have a product that DEMO low utility. It can still drive high growth
sales if it satisfies a psychological need. Clearly if the need is not in the utility DEMO
the product itself, the value or need can still exist through DEMO or perceived
value. This is the marketplace of designer brands. They create need through
an association with an image of self or with high DEMO celebrities. Need can
be associated with self image, ego, peer group pressure, a need to ‘belong’ or
a need to be admired, DEMO or envied by being in possession of a specific
brand. In industrial products or services, the need might be satisfied through
an association with an admired and/or leading business customer or through
being an ‘approved’ DEMO of choice to a much admired corporation.
Even if a product does not satisfy a compelling need, it can still achieve a high
rate of sales if it can be closely associated with one that does. DEMO products
can be pulled into a sale by being complementary to a product that solves a
106
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
compelling need. The sale opportunity is created by having one component
of the sale satisfy a compelling DEMO but the sale process itself takes the
opportunity of presenting other complementary products. Thus an applications
software vendor might open the door with a DEMO, tax reporting or OH&S
reporting system but sell an entire DEMO on the back of it.  Consulting firms
have compliance audit services DEMO gain them access to clients and then sell
general consulting services in cross sell opportunities.
A compelling need reduces the costs of selling as DEMO is little selling effort
required. This in turn helps create higher velocity in the business. However,
where there are close competitors, this advantage can be readily lost and
deals will ultimately be won on lowest DEMO The ideal position to be in for
any business is to have a product that satisfies a compelling need in a medium
to large DEMO market, has no close competitors and is able to protect its
DEMO advantage for some period of time.

Strong competitive advantage
While it would be an advantage to have a rapidly growing market DEMO which
even the poorest of the competitors could find space to grow, few markets
offer this situation. Most businesses compete in either mature markets or
markets with slow growth. Yet, even within mature markets, some DEMO
manage to carve out a place and grow rapidly. This was certainly the case with
Starbucks, Office Depot, Walmart, Aussie Home Loans, DEMO Records, Virgin
Blue, and Bendigo Community banks. They all found a way to compete which
resulted in a significant shift in market share. DEMO look at the products they
sold, all well established products which DEMO been around for some time. All
these companies found a new business concept or process which dramatically
increased customer value compared to their competitors.
DEMO is easy to see how an invention can provide a competitive advantage.
A major change in functionality, a new attribute of performance or a major
reduction in cost will clearly unseat established firms. Innovation in product
DEMO which taps into an unmet need can provide massive growth
opportunities. At the same time, a major development in process innovation
can lead to a raft of new products that can provide a first mover advantage
DEMO might give the business time to seize a leadership position in an emerging
market.

Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
Some competitive advantages are in fact monopolistic and provided under
statutes or regulations. For example:
• DEMO
• Trademarks
• Registered brands
• Copyright
• Licenses
• Legislated rights (forestry, mining, fishing and so on.)
• Regulated approval to sell (TGA, FDA)
While these vary in the degree of DEMO offered, they all provide some
level of exclusive use and thus DEMO competitive advantage.
However, if you have a product or service in DEMO marketplace which is simply
littered with comparable offerings, you have very DEMO hope that your venture
is going to gain the traction needed to support any significant level of growth.
The market place is crowded with DEMO products. With little to differentiate
them, customers will buy on a DEMO or simply treat them as a commodity and
buy the one that is the most convenient or the cheapest. In these markets,
shelf DEMO and price are the dominant competitive dimensions. Unless you
can control the shelf space or ensure you are the lowest price, your ability to
forecast and control sales is limited.
The answer is to identify a DEMO market where your products and services
better match the needs of the target market than your competitors. However, if
everything you do to be different can be readily copied with little effort, clearly
you are in a business with little chance of substantial growth.
Competitive advantage arises from DEMO a superior position on one or
more attributes which your target market values. In the case of customer value
attributes, that superior position needs to be not only obvious to the prospective
customer, but they must value it to the point where it is the major factor in
DEMO choice between competitive offerings. If the difference is strong enough
and important enough for the customer, it is also the attribute that can drive a
109
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
premium price position. In the case of internal operations, the attribute must
result in a significant cost advantage that results in superior profit performance.
Few markets have customer utility DEMO customer buying experience around
a single dimension. Consider these aspects of the customer interface:
Utility:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Functionality DEMO How well does it do the job (specifications)?
Safety – Some products are safer to use than others
Fun and Image – DEMO colours, design, style and brand
Environmental – Does it impact the environment and has this been taken
into account in the design?
DEMO – How easy is it to put away, carry and use?DEMO
Simplicity – How simple is it to operate?
purchase:

Availability – How easy is DEMO to find and buy?
Information – How easy is to find out about the product and have
questions answered?
Delivery – What DEMO involved in getting it delivered and picked up?
Supplements – What after sales help, warranty, training etc can you
access?
Ease DEMO use – How easy is the product to use?
Disposal – How do you get rid of it when you don’t want it DEMO more?
Maintenance – How easy and expensive is it to be maintained?
Divisibility – How easy is it to try before you DEMO?
While many of these attributes refer to physical products, equivalent
DEMO exist with service offerings. Thus the quality of the experience itself is
110
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
a dimension of many participant services. Customer service in terms of quality,
consistency, friendliness, level DEMO helpfulness, knowledge, and so on, can be used
to differentiate DEMO types of experiences. Atmosphere, ambience, noise
level, security, the type of other participants, duration and mementoes, all alter
the feeling during DEMO after an experience. The key to service experiences is to
work out how the customer expects to react and then to offer an exceptional
DEMO along a dimension that the customer values and remembers.
Within any market there will be sets of customers that place different
weights on the DEMO attributes of the utility and the buying experience. In
the end, DEMO may have to make a choice between different attributes which are
mutually exclusive or that compromise each other. Thus portability may have to
be DEMO for greater productivity.
One dimension may be sufficient for you to create a niche market. Thus
vibrant colors may not appeal to mainstream buyers DEMO a fringe market may
exist that appreciates unusual style and color. There may be a niche market in
a rugged version of the product DEMO use in difficult environmental situations like
building sites or uninhabited regions.
Another dimension of competitive advantage can come from specialist
information. Thus many firms DEMO developed expertise in bidding on
government contracts or in consortium tenders. Others have developed deep
expertise in a specific application. Some recruitment firms specialize DEMO one
type of business or one type of professional executive. Package travel providers
often specialize in one region or one type of experience.
Many DEMO have grown substantial market presence by solving an
especially difficult problem. For example, this could be in servicing jet engines or
putting safety systems into mines. The key to this advantage is to solve a complex
DEMO which requires unusual expertise and perhaps specialized equipment.
Often these markets are not large enough to attract large corporations. Also,
the expertise gained DEMO such environments often cannot be used elsewhere.
There have been many situations in the past where competitors have fought
for market share along a DEMO dimension. This has normally been in product
specifications, such things as DEMO, power consumption, weight, pixels, size,
111
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
accessories, or speed. In DEMO race to be first to market on the next dimension
of competition, they often forget that customers have many other attributes of
value and that substantial niche markets evolve around those. Thus a product
which has DEMO performance but has unbeatable customer service will
gather loyal customers and grow market share providing enough customers
value customer service over other product attributes.
DEMO by finding a strong point of difference along an attribute that the target
customer values will your products or services carve out a segment DEMO the
market.  Clearly the most desirable position to be in is DEMO have a product which
not only fully meets the needs of the target customers but has no competitor
or near substitute.
Unless the business DEMO a strong cost advantage, growth will only be generated
by products DEMO services which are differentiated from the competitors. Typically
this differentiation will be based on some level of innovation in product, process
or business concept. The innovation itself needs to be difficult to match over a
reasonable DEMO of time for the business to gain a leadership position within
its target market.
Growth businesses only maintain their position by staying ahead of DEMO
competitors. Thus they are very sensitive to what their competitors are doing
and how they are positioning themselves within the market. A superior position
DEMO be readily lost if a competitor is able to match or exceed your position on
the attribute you have chosen to compete on.
The DEMO business is proactive in delivering increasing value to customers.
Within their chosen market sectors, the most successful firms seek out the
most demanding customers and work closely with them to provide an on-
going stream of DEMO value. These key accounts are often the reference point
for other customers within the sector and their purchase decisions will highly
influence others in DEMO same market.
By staying close to the key customers and by working with them to establish
where products and services need to evolve, the firm has a direct connection
to customer value leadership. The market notes DEMO buying preferences of the
112
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
leaders and thus marketing is more by referral than persuasive marketing. This
in turn can lead to DEMO marketing budget productivity.
Growth businesses carry out continual competitive analysis to ensure their
market is not being eroded by developments in other firms. This DEMO
needs to be matched with the target segment needs to ensure that the firm’s
products and services continue to provide better value than the DEMO
The competitive analysis needs to be able to show very clearly why the firm’s
products are preferred in some market segments to other offerings DEMO to be
able to offer reasonable proof of that assertion.
For a competitive advantage to be meaningful, it needs to be periodically
validated by actual or potential customers. The difference must be meaningful
and sufficiently important DEMO the target customers that they have a clearly
expressed preference for the product or service you are offering. Validation is
also needed to ensure DEMO the other companies which do have product offerings
in the general market in which you are dealing do not have a close alternative.
What DEMO are looking for is a situation where the acquirer has a period of
time to exploit the competitive advantage offered by the seller’s strategic
DEMO or capability. The strategic value flows directly from the buyer’s ability to
create much greater revenue than the seller. With the right level of DEMO
advantage, the buyer can put the seller’s product or service into DEMO large
distribution channel and with adequate marketing support, the buyer can
DEMO revenue many times more than the seller would have been capable
of. More particularly, the buyer will be able to generate that large revenue gain
rapidly because all the other parts of the business concept are DEMO in place.
However, this opportunity only exists if the buyer is DEMO enough time to exploit
the opportunity and that requires some period of competitive advantage.
A product or capability which can be readily copied, easily assembled or
quickly negated by competitor retaliation has little or no strategic DEMO Thus
an essential characteristic of strategic value must be some period of strong
competitive advantage.
Registered intellectual property typically provides this as does deep
DEMO capital. However, strategic value may still accrue even where
113
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
competitive advantage does not exist within a wider public market. A large
company which can sell a DEMO product or service back into a protected customer
base can achieve a large revenue gain. A new product might be added to an
already DEMO product suite and be swept along in a sales situation. The
acquirer may be able to make additional marginal revenue simply by adding
a DEMO product to an existing suite of products. The competitive
advantage still exists but it is accessed by living in the shadow of other offerings
DEMO are winning the business.

Target an identified and accessible niche market
Successful high growth businesses have a DEMO clear definition of their target
customer. They know exactly what problem their targeted customers have and
they know how and where to deliver a DEMO message to the customer in a way
that will create a positive situation for closing a sale. Above all else, the sales
process is proactive. They go out and touch the target customer; they don’t wait
for them to find out about the firm and its products or DEMO come and find them
to buy the product.
114

Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
You see businesses all the time that reach out to the general public in the
hope that DEMO will buy. A retail store, a restaurant and the internet marketing
DEMO are all hoping  they can attract customers. But they have little DEMO over
the buying cycle. When I walk down most main shopping streets I am constantly
amazed at the number of shops which are closing DEMO opening. I wonder what
happened to the ones that failed? However, it isn’t hard to guess what went
wrong with most of them. DEMO set up the business using the ‘hope’ strategy.
They put up a sign or develop a web site and then think:
i hope DEMO bother to stop and read about my products.
i hope they are interested enough to enquire and i hope that they have
enough money DEMO buy and are willing to do so.
Then i hope they will tell all their friends.
This does not create a high growth business. DEMO high growth business targets
a specific customer who has a problem which they can solve. The customer
is either publicly identified by name and DEMO, such as a corporation or a
professional service provider, or is available through a mailing list or is a member
of a club DEMO association which is willing to support a marketing approach to its
members. The size of the market being addressed is sufficient to provide the
DEMO projections of the firm for some years to come.
Alternatively, the DEMO can be readily reached through an established,
or readily built distribution channel. This might be through a subscription
magazine, a credit card member directory, a specific specialty store or a web
site. The aim of the firm is to gain easy access to the specific customer who DEMO
a high likelihood of having the problem that is being addressed by the firm’s
products or services.
In order to generate the growth rate DEMO, the firm must be able to project
the rate of sales DEMO its product or services. To the extent that it can estimate the
number of potential customers it can reach with its sales message, it has a much
better chance of estimating its sales closure rate. The DEMO program needs
to have a very good estimate of the number of potential customers hearing
its message in order to be able to estimate DEMO customers. With a tight
customer profile, a readily identified method of DEMO them individually
115
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
and a clear understanding of the sales triggers, a proactive approach can be
mounted to generate the level of sales activity that the firm can support.
The more successful DEMO solve a very specific problem that has a compelling
need to be resolved. Where these problems are experienced by highly targeted
and readily identified DEMO who are able and willing to pay a reasonable
price to satisfy the need, the firm has a much easier marketing task. Highly
specific problems also normally have readily obvious decision processes
with which the firm DEMO work. Thus specific information can be provided to
demonstrate how the product or service can readily solve the problem.
A great number of businesses DEMO 16 – 25 year olds, time poor executives,
free thinkers DEMO people with a desire to feel young at heart. The problem with
this type of approach is that it is difficult to be proactive, to actually reach out
and connect directly with the target customer. These DEMO are highly
dependent on the passing traffic for business. They typically advertise to the
general public through newspapers, popular journals and TV. But they can’t
be sure that they are getting to their intended audience. They DEMO reliant on
their target customers seeing them in passing. Since most of us are now highly
resistant to advertising, much of the marketing spend is wasted.
Alternatively, highly targeted marketing to a named individual or to a tightly
defined readership of a specialty journal or to a mailing DEMO of a special interest
group, is going to have a higher DEMO of contact. The marketing spend per
contact is likely to be much lower and the conversion rate higher, especially
if the problem being addressed has a high compelling need. Thus marketing
productivity in high growth firms DEMO to be much higher.
Often the product or service can be aligned to a problem which is already
the focus of attention of an DEMO group. Thus providing a solution to a new
tax compliance issue may find receptive clients through an accountant’s journal
which has been addressing the DEMO for some time. A plant soil additive which
absorbs and slowly releases water that can be spread in a field in climates with
erratic DEMO might be of interest to a farmers association or be picked up in a
farmer’s journal or a specificTV program.

Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
Sometimes a firm can use an existing distribution channel to gain access to a
target audience. Thus DEMO existing supplier might be willing to bring a new product
to the notice of their own customers if they see that it might enhance DEMO own
customer relationships. This is often the case with strategic partnerships.
Multiple businesses might agree to work together to promote each other’s
products to DEMO ultimate benefit of a joint customer. This was often the case
in the computer hardware industry. The marketing challenge of the computer
hardware manufacturer DEMO that they did not directly solve business problems.
These were solved by software vendors and implementation consultants. Thus
in order to sell the hardware, they would identify the problem to be solved, find
the right software solution and then present the prospect with a package of
products and DEMO from multiple strategic partners. The strategic partners
would spend much less on marketing as the hardware vendor was searching out
the right prospects for DEMO
The potential customer needs to be reachable for the firm to proactively
impact the sale. A reachable customer is one that you can get DEMO front of with
your product or service message. Potential customers must be identified with
a location or place where you can deliver your message. DEMO also needs to be
cost effective, thus a TV advertisement aimed DEMO registered dentists does not
make a lot of sense when a trade journal, a dentist conference or direct sales
visit to a registered dental surgery, would have a higher conversion rate.
For business to business sales, the sales process also needs to deal with
complex multi-tiered decision processes. The person with the problem may not
be the person making the DEMO recommendation or the person with the power to
make the purchase. Sales processes need to understand the level of influence,
the authority and DEMO politics of the customer environment to close a sale.
An important attribute of the target market must be that they have the
willingness and DEMO ability to spend on the product or service. A potential user
with no budget or authority may only be able to recommend the product DEMO
service, but the criteria for the buy decision may be made DEMO other attributes
of the product or vendor. The marketing and sales process needs to take these
aspects into account when marketing and selling the DEMO or service.
117

Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
Clearly a high growth venture also needs to have prospective customers in
sufficient numbers so that the DEMO can make enough revenue and profit
to be a viable and growing entity. Many businesses limit themselves to one
segment, geography or channel. For adequate growth to be achieved, the
firm needs to project revenue over a number of years in its selected market
segments. If these markets DEMO not generate the necessary transaction volumes
to support a target growth rate, the business needs to look at new geographies,
new channels and/or new markets for growth.
Instead of seeking out or developing new DEMO for new customers, the
firm should first see if it can DEMO more of the same customers that brought it
success. A product which has a clear competitive advantage, solves a compelling
need and has a well defined target customer, should be readily accepted in
other geographies. Even if the firm is unwilling or unable to establish its own
operations DEMO those new territories, it may be able to find distributors with DEMO
capacity, knowledge and distribution channels to handle the product or service.
DEMO way the firm can continue to benefit from its existing capabilities before it
needs to spread its resources across other products.

Scalability is critical
If the value DEMO any investment is related to the net present value of the free
cash flow generated by the investment, it follows that the value of a strategic
asset or capability is directly related to the size and DEMO rate of the gross
margins it generates. Thus early revenue generation is more valuable than later
generation. Obviously, high growth rates are more valuable than slow growth
rates. The value of any acquisition is thus directly DEMO to the speed with
which the acquired products or services can generate revenue, the faster the
better and the greater the better. Thus in selecting strategic assets for potential
Angel or VC investment we need to DEMO for assets and capabilities which are
able to be rapidly scaled or replicated in the hands of the buyer and, obviously,
the sooner the better.
In order to make the opportunity able to be exploited DEMO a large corporation
within a relatively short period, the selling firm DEMO ensure that the buyer
has the capability to replicate and scale the strategic asset or capability being
acquired. If the seller is unable to DEMO the preconditions to enable the buyer
to exploit the asset or capability properly, the corporation may decide not to
undertake the acquisition. Few large corporations are willing to take on products
or processes that can only DEMO used in a small part of their business.
Thus one of the key criteria in identifying investee firms for an effective
strategic sale strategy DEMO to find assets or capabilities which are able to be scaled
rapidly. Part of the sale preparation is then to put in place the DEMO of people
and resources which will enable the buyer to scale the asset or capability as

Is the problem or need being addressed obvious to the intended

quickly as possible. This means that the buyer would need to have the ability to
rapidly add DEMO or be able to use spare capacity, to have knowledge well
DEMO and/or have people available who are able to quickly train a larger
number of staff in using the newly acquired products or processes.
DEMO we need to find products or services which, by their very DEMO, are
capable of driving high growth. Then we need to ensure DEMO the growth which
is being generated can be serviced by a highly scalable product or service.
Clearly, for this to be effective, you DEMO to start with assets and capabilities
which, because of the way DEMO have been designed and supported, are able to
be scaled.
Scalability DEMO the ultimate key to a strategic sale. What the potential buyer
needs to see is a high growth market which they can secure through DEMO
assets or capabilities of the seller. An acquirer that sees the possibility of a
considerable increase in revenue by selling back into their own DEMO customer
base or through a greatly expanded existing distribution channel, need DEMO be
that concerned about paying a premium for the deal.
Not all products or services can be scaled. There are many situations where
the DEMO is limited or inhibited. This is going to result in a low acquisition
price or the deal not being consummated.
Location
A firm located DEMO a region or section of a city that has difficult access or
lacks good infrastructure and is unable to be relocated.
Tied to Culture
DEMO product or service that is tightly tied to one limited culture.
Tied to Legislation

that cannot be ported to another jurisdiction.

Locked in to One Customer
Products or services contracted to one customer or custom designed to
suit DEMO customer’s specific requirements.
Un-codified Knowledge
Firms that do business out of their heads rather than using a documented,
systematic procedure or process that DEMO be readily passed on to new
employees are limited in scope.
Highly Dependent on One or Few Individuals
This occurs where a small number DEMO individuals are critical to making a
business work and are linked closely to specific customer solutions. This
can be difficult for the buyer as DEMO face a risk of losing the capability if
the key individuals left.
Incomplete Solutions
Scalability requires that the product or service be complete, tested and
stabilized in customer reference sites.
Lack of Standardization
Firms that customize DEMO solutions for every customer often require
a high intellectual input. This requires high calibre staff with deep
knowledge. The best situations for scalability are DEMO the products are
standardized and the level of intellect required to sell, install and support
the product is relatively low.
When we seek out a potential buyer, we are looking for a corporation which
has the ability to scale the strategic asset or capability rapidly. Clearly this
provides DEMO best outcome in terms of creating value on sale. For Angel or VC
investments we need to be very selective in what we invest DEMO We need to
concentrate on those products or services which are able to be scaled rapidly
and also where we have the ability to DEMO in place the foundations which will
enable the buyer to do that.

Picking Winners
If you decide to invest where there is a high probability of a strategic sale,DEMO
you need to have an evaluation process which helps you identify strategic assets
or capabilities. One of the major problems in identifying potential investments

value and scalability and so may not have ever thought of DEMO products and

thus may well be selling products and services which suit their own capability
and capacity and these may be very DEMO from the products and services
they could offer with the resources of a large corporation behind them.
You might get lucky and have a DEMO where the strategic assets and
capabilities are obvious and are already being developed by the target firm.
Then it is simply a case of DEMO out what you have to do to sell to a strategic
buyer. At other times, the answers won’t be obvious and you will need to
do some digging. Remember that what you are interested in is DEMO a large
corporation would exploit and this may not be what the target firm is currently
developing, selling and supporting. You are often trying to work out what they
could do, what problems they could solve and which markets they could offer
solutions in.
Usually the key to DEMO the strategic assets or capabilities, if there are
any, lies in what problems the firm is currently solving or could solve. Usually
I DEMO by identifying those problems which represent high compelling needs.
You can start by understanding what problems or needs the business is
focused on currently. DEMO may seem like a simple task but in fact can take
some time and be exhausting for the investor and the venture management.
Too DEMO they see their business in terms of features and functions, products
DEMO services, customer and markets but not problems and needs. Once you
DEMO identified the problems and needs being addressed, you can rank these DEMO
terms of their market growth potential.
• How quickly do they secure the business?
• What level of competition do they face?
DEMO How price sensitive is the customer?
122
Invest2 Exit
Chapter six: Identifying Strategic Value
• What is their competitive advantage?
• How scalable is the solution?
This is a DEMO starting point but remember that the business will be
developed for sale and so some of these issues will be further addressed to
improve DEMO outcomes.
Now start to look at potential. That is, what could DEMO do. What we are
looking for is a set of problems or needs which they could address with the
underlying intellectual property and intellectual DEMO they have. Remember
it is not necessarily what they are doing but what problems and needs a large
corporation could address with what they DEMO What additional or different
problems could they solve within a short period given access to investment
funds.
So, if they had the resources and market access:
• Which problems could they solve with what they DEMO now or could
develop in a short period of time?
• Which customers have these problems and is the market large?
• DEMO these customers be willing to pay a premium for a solution?
• What level of protection can be built into the products or DEMO
to provide a reasonable period of high competitive advantage?
• could these products or services be developed and validated in a
relatively short DEMO at a reasonable cost?
• can the products or services be put into a form where a large cor-
poration could rapidly scale DEMO replicate them?
Obviously the key here is whether a large corporation would be willing to
acquire the firm to pursue the revenue opportunity, thus the identification of
potential acquirers will be critical to the investment DEMO But if you don’t
have existing products or services to work with or don’t have the potential
to develop them, there is little point in continuing the evaluation. Therefore,
businesses which do not have existing DEMO or services or do not have the
potential to develop highly scalable strategic products or services should not be
considered for potential investment.

he ultimate strategic buyer is the one which DEMO best utilize
Tthe underlying assets and capabilities of the firm. Once the
assets and competencies are identified, the search starts for those
corporations that can best leverage them.
An investigation of historical strategic sales will show DEMO very
few were ever acquired for their revenue and profits. In virtually all
situations, it was an underlying asset or capability which the acquirer
was seeking and they justified the premium on the purchase price
by DEMO the corporation could generate significant future value
through the acquisition.
In many acquisition situations the acquirer is consolidating a
number of similar businesses with DEMO aim to build cumulative
capacity in terms of revenue. The synergy in the consolidated
business comes through economies of scale. In this situation, it is
very difficult for a firm to achieve a premium on sale DEMO they are
a key firm in the industry and their acquisition can convince others
to join the consolidated entity. Alternatively, they may have some
management processes which can take additional costs out of the
combined entity. DEMO is not where you will find the strategic deals.

What you need to find are corporations who can generate large new

strategic buyers by developing a screening technique to whittle down the list of
potential buyers. In the end DEMO want about 5 – 8 corporations which meet all
your selection criteria. If it is not possible to identify that many, then you want
those that have the best available fit. I usually start with a DEMO net and use a

Who makes money when I make money?
The most common acquisition path is to sell to a partner. Where DEMO firm
is jointly selling into a customer, each taking a part DEMO the profit, the larger
firm will often want to be in DEMO control of the sales process and the
account future. Also a supplier generally makes money when the firm
makes a sale and may wish DEMO integrate forward to control the channel
and to scale the business. A distributor also makes money when they sell
the firm’s products. They may DEMO to integrate backwards to scale the

125
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
Who does not make money when I make money?
If one firm wins a contract, it generally means that another has lost it.
Buying a competitor may provide DEMO benefits to the acquirer. It may
increase the customer base for existing products, reduce pressure on
price, make the sales process more effective DEMO eliminating a competitor
and acquire some new product capabilities. The acquirer may wish to
upgrade their products, integrate some of the products into theirs, cross
sell new products to existing customers, acquire technology or R&DEMO
capability or acquire a customer base.
Who can make more money than I can from my products?
The selling firm should look far DEMO wide to find a firm with the capacity to
scale their products into larger markets. A buyer that can readily introduce
the products into DEMO customers and/or existing distribution channels
is an ideal target. A buyer that has the capacity to rapidly expand the
products into a sector DEMO they are not currently in, but have the muscle
to expand DEMO that sector, is also a good target.
Who can remove a DEMO on my business?
If you wished to scale your business by 5 to 10 times – what is the factor
constraining your ability DEMO do so? This could be location, distribution
channel, export capability, finance and so on. If the constraint could be
removed, how much more revenue and profit could be achieved. The
strategic buyer is the DEMO that can overcome the constraint.
Who has a problem I can fix?
Often firms lack the capability or capacity in a new area, new technology
or new process. Sometimes the quickest way to solve this DEMO is to
acquire it. Alternatively, the firm may be faced with DEMO changes,
changing market conditions or the loss of key staff. A firm that can solve
the problem may be an ideal acquisition.
What DEMO can I reduce or eliminate?
A threat occurs when a firm is faced with a potential or actual decline
in current revenue. This DEMO often come from an existing or new
126
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
competitor. The firm may not have the luxury of time to create a
competitive product and so DEMO already available products may help
to eliminate, or reduce the threat. DEMO threat may also occur where the
competitors are anticipated to undertake some action. Being first off the
block may counter the advantage they otherwise DEMO achieve.
A threat may also come with loss of a key distribution agreement, key
account or key capability. Loss of key staff may create a gap in capability
in any part of the firm. An acquisition DEMO be used to resolve the problem
as well as provide increased capability.
Forward integration is sometimes used to reduce the threat of loss of
DEMO capability. A key distributor might be acquired by a competitor
or the distributor may be financially unstable. Rather than risk loss of the
distribution DEMO, the firm may buy it out.
Alternatively, the firm may be facing a risk with a supplier. The supplier
might be acquired by DEMO competitor thus locking out a source of supply
or they may be financially unstable. A supplier that is not developing
products in line with DEMO firm’s strategy may also be acquired in order to
own the capability.
Who sells to the same customers I sell to?
Scanning customers DEMO find another company that sells to them will
often indicate a potential buyer who can capitalize on knowledge of that
customer sector. They may DEMO able to cross sell products or utilize their
own distribution channel to move new products.
Who uses the same technology I use?
If DEMO key ingredient to the success of the firm is the use of a specific
technology which is expensive or difficult or time consuming to DEMO,
then another firm that uses that technology may wish to acquire the
firm to increase capacity or enter new markets. For example, in software
technology, many firms which merged used the same underlying language
or database technology.
127
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
Who needs my customer base?
The customer base can often be a very valuable asset, especially if it
provides opportunities for the acquirer to sell additional products or DEMO
break into a new sector.
Who needs my technology or people?
A specialized technology, especially if protected with patents, or
specialized staff DEMO deep knowledge, can often provide a buyer with
scalable opportunities.
What DEMO need to arrive at are those corporations who have the capability
and capacity to fully and quickly exploit the strategic assets and capabilities of
DEMO investee firm. You want the potential buyer to quickly see the benefits of an
acquisition and to recognize that they have the capability to DEMO the revenue
potential out of it.
You don’t want acquisition beginners or corporations wanting to enter a new
market (unless that is their core competence). To be really pragmatic, you are
seeking a potential buyer who thinks it will be easy to achieve the benefits of
the DEMO because they understand it very well, have the capacity and
capability DEMO roll out the new product or service and already have experience in
the target market.
Reviewing Markets and Products
Ideally, what you are seeking is a very large corporation which can bring your
products to market DEMO, has the customer base and/or distribution channels
already in place DEMO has the resources to do the job efficiently and quickly. If
you can structure your company so that your strategic asset or capability can DEMO
rapidly scaled or replicated, which corporation has the best chance of DEMO it
to market and generating the most revenue from it?
What you are hoping to find is a corporation which can take on DEMO strategic
asset or capability and quickly generate revenue from it by selling it into an
existing marketplace where they already have access.
128
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
In order to tease out possibilities, I often take the ideal product/market
scenario and look at who will make money out of it if it is hugely successful.
DEMO could be the retailer, wholesaler, manufacturer, supplier, installer and
so on. This will often help you identify who has the greatest interest DEMO the
solution becoming widely available. Another test is to work out who has the
best capability of a large rollout. This will often identify DEMO corporation who is
best able to undertake the task.
As we have seen from our earlier look at net present value, early revenue
is worth a lot more than later revenue. For example, lets say you have two
possible buyers, each can generate $10 million in gross margin in the first two
years. The better one is the one which DEMO generate the revenue earlier. Using a
50% discount factor we get the following NPV on acquisition.
Year One Revenue Year Two Revenue NPV
Buyer DEMO 2 8 4.8
Buyer Two 4 6 5.3
In scenario Buyer Two, the acquisition is worth 10% more to the buyer.
Many large corporations have an acquisition criteria of achieving a payback
in the first two DEMO of the acquisition. Thus the maximum value they are
willing to pay is the discounted gross margin achieved in the first two years of
DEMO acquisition. Any delay in scaling up revenue will severely punish the seller.
Another consideration for the buyer is the level of uncertainty associated with
DEMO revenue. Products which can be sold without further development
and can be sold to existing customers represent a considerable reduction in risk
to the DEMO The buyer will be interested in longer term revenue possibilities
and this will make the acquisition more attractive, but clearly the focus of the
seller should be on short term revenue at the least risk to DEMO buyer.
129

Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
QUADRANT ONE: Existing products DEMO existing markets
Look for situations where the acquired products or services can be sold
into a large established customer base or through well established DEMO
channels. Ideally, what you would like to see is that the DEMO already has the
distribution channels and the customer relationships in place to quickly sell the
products.
Alternatively, look for situations where the acquired firm has a large customer
base which can quickly absorb the products of DEMO acquirer. In some cases there
are opportunities for a cross selling situation.
In this situation, the buyer faces very low risks as products are already fully
developed and markets already exist and are being serviced by DEMO corporation.
Early revenue, possibly well within the initial two year target DEMO highly likely.

While there is some market risk, the DEMO are already well established,
are not being altered and already have a reasonable chance of success in the

In this scenario DEMO is a market risk but no product risk. Chances are that
an aggressive roll out campaign could secure some new revenue within the two

quadrant.

With this new insight into when revenue will be generated and what risks will
be DEMO by the buyer, the investor can be much more selective in DEMO choice of
potential buyers. Those with large early revenue possibilities should be much
more attractive as potential buyers.
The issue of early revenue and DEMO risk is critical in the choice of potential
buyers. However, there DEMO still many factors to consider apart from product
and market fit, DEMO is also the consideration of how quickly the buyer can
ramp up to get product out the door. Some of these issues will be DEMO in
133
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
the next chapter on enabling the buyer but some problems the seller cannot
resolve.
Take for instance DEMO problem of putting in place high volume manufacturing
or large scale recruitment of service delivery and support personnel. There is
only so much that DEMO be done within a limited time period. If process lines
need to be re-engineered, if new office accommodation needs to be sourced,
if salespeople need to be retrained or specialised equipment acquired, all this
takes time and delays the ramp up of revenue generation. What the seller DEMO to
do is anticipate these issues and either select potential buyers who don’t have
these problems or work to find a short term solution DEMO can be implemented
while the buyer is putting in place their own capability.
Further Considerations in Selecting the Buyer
There is little point in DEMO acquired if you don’t achieve your priority
objectives. Thus if harvesting the value in your business is the primary objective,
selling out for DEMO in a privately held business where you are a minority
shareholder is not an effective exit. This makes the publicly listed corporation
a much DEMO attractive target. Once the listed shares are held past the lock
down period, they are normally able to be freely traded, although if DEMO of the
former shareholders continue to work for the acquirer,  they may be subject to
some restrictions.
Your selection criteria for the buyer DEMO also look at their experience in
acquisitions, whether they have dedicated DEMO to handle the negotiations and
integration and whether you think they will be a willing rather than a reluctant
buyer. You don’t want to DEMO your time educating the buyer on how to do an
acquisition nor do you want to be dependent on them making it work where
DEMO have some possibility of a claw back or potential litigation if they fail.
Normally you would want to exclude any corporation which does not DEMO
a healthy business in terms of potential growth and reasonable profits. You
need to be assured they have the capacity to execute on the DEMO and won’t be
wavering when something else goes wrong with their existing operations.
134
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
While it might look attractive to squeeze the last drop out of your buyer, you
should try to avoid the naive buyer. There are some very good reasons why DEMO
might want to limit your selection of potential buyers to those companies with
a good track record of successful acquisition.
There is now considerable DEMO available on acquisitions and their
impact on the acquiring corporation. A 1999 study by KPMG found that 83% of
mergers failed to unlock value.  A 2004 study by Bain & Company of 790 deals
made by DEMO based companies from 1995 to 2001 confirmed prior research that
“70% of all deals fail to create meaningful shareholder value”. It would seem
that DEMO likelihood of success in a merger or acquisition is against the acquirer.
However, a more recent Bain & Company study of seventeen hundred large
public companies in six industrialized nations spanning the time period of 1986
DEMO 2001 did uncover corporations which were consistently successful in their
M&A activities.
Bain found that the successful corporations had several characteristics in
common:DEMO
• They were frequent acquirers. That is, they had an M&DEMO program that
undertook regular acquisitions;
• They typically started with small deals and gradually became more
expert at acquisitions and then progressed to DEMO deals;
• The size of the deals was generally small – often less than 15% of the
parent company’s capitalized worth;
• DEMO clear return on investment case was made for the acquisition and they
were prepared to walk away if their criteria was not met;
DEMO A comprehensive due diligence was undertaken of the potential target
with a strong emphasis on the integration effort. This included a serious
consideration of DEMO culture match between the two businesses;
• Frequent acquirers set up benchmarks so  they know that the integration
effort is on track and have processes to deal with under-achievement;
and
135
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
• Successful acquirers have an acquisition strategy which targets potential
firms that offer value to their core DEMO and builds relationships with
them prior to formal discussions.
Basically you want smart acquirers. They know whether they can make it
work and you DEMO a buyer that can. Because they know what they are doing,
they won’t waste your time and they will quickly recognize the strategic DEMO if
it works for them. They know the right questions to ask and will understand how
much effort you have put into to make DEMO successful for them. Acquirers who
overpay, who don’t know what they DEMO doing or mess up are your nightmare.
They will send their lawyers after you to get their money back.
There are some other good DEMO why you might want to look for
competent and successful acquirers. Generally they have been there before
and understand what to look for, thus their due diligence will be thorough. If
they find a serious problem DEMO will request it be fixed, make an allowance to
fix it DEMO walk away. That means that there are unlikely to be hidden rocks which
can catch you out later on.
The last thing you want DEMO for the buyer to sue you over something that
could have been discovered during the due diligence process. You also want a
successful integration DEMO your business into the buyer’s and you want them to
achieve the benefits of the acquisition. A buyer that is making lots of money
DEMO an acquisition is less likely to worry about a few problems that they
uncover. But always keep in  mind that a deal that goes sour will find the buyer
going over every inch of the business DEMO to find how they can litigate to
recover their investment.
Clearly successful acquirers rarely overpay for their acquisitions and so it
would appear that DEMO chance of generating a premium on the sale of your
business would be minimal. However, it is clear that successful acquirers also
look for strategic value and are generally prepared to pay above fair market
value DEMO gain such a strategic uplift. They are interested in acquiring firms which
can clearly add to their core business through extending the scope of DEMO
offerings or their ability to scale the size of their business through distribution
capacity or customer base. The firm which can show how their DEMO,
136
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
processes or capabilities can be leveraged by the acquirer should be a good
acquisition target.
Your proposition DEMO a potential acquirer should show the buyer how they
can exploit the potential of your business. Most private firms are constrained
by limited resources, lack of funding, an inability to recruit the best people
due to their size, a limited distribution channel or small customer base. Often
these elements are exactly what the larger corporations have in abundance.
This presents DEMO great opportunity for the acquirer to release unrealized revenue
from the underlying products, processes or capabilities of the smaller firm. The
key is to find the right buyer that can do that. If you can show DEMO significant
revenue can be generated, then it is certainly possible to DEMO a premium on
sale of the business.
The successful acquirer that pays a premium on the deal is also less likely
to terminate your DEMO They acquire the business because they see
potential in it. It is most likely that the potential needs to be supported by your
previous DEMO, thus you are also taking care of your loyal employees by
DEMO the right buyer. Successful acquirers also understand how to go about
the integration effort and are also less likely to lose good people through DEMO lack
of understanding of the degree of change they are being put through.
Frequent acquirers will almost certainly have a formal process of evaluation,DEMO
due diligence and integration. They will have learnt from their mistakes and
built up an accumulated knowledge of what works and what does not. DEMO
should mean that they won’t waste your time while they figure out how to do
the deal. They also might be willing to share DEMO or all of that information with
you in a friendly deal so that the final outcome is better for both parties.
The experienced acquirer DEMO have a senior member of their executive team
who has primary responsibility for assessing potential acquisitions. This also
makes your task easier as there DEMO a name for you to contact. Since that person
performs only by making acquisitions, they need to have a pipeline of possible
acquisitions. Their job includes setting up relationships with potential targets
and thus you are DEMO them achieve their objectives by approaching them
with a possible future deal. This makes your task easier as they may assist you in
137
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
setting up other contacts within their firm so you can better understand where
the strategic value might DEMO be utilized.
If they have a formal process, you might be DEMO to review it to see if you
fit their acquisition and return on investment (ROI) criteria. Again this helps
you weed out potential DEMO where you are not able to meet a critical
requirement. However, DEMO you clearly meet their conditions, this helps you
gain more attention DEMO the relationship building phase.
Frequent acquirers know the importance of undertaking friendly acquisitions.
Companies that have been through hostile takeovers understand the levels of
DEMO placed on both organizations, the loss of staff during the process DEMO
the difficulty of later integration. Where they can, acquirers would rather
DEMO a mutual case where both parties are comfortable with the acquisition.
By undertaking this over a period of time, both parties can sort out the most
appropriate integration level and use the time to convince the DEMO people to
stay with the merged business.
Culture is seen to be critical in most acquisitions. Only where there is almost
no integration can DEMO cultures co-exist. The more integrated the planned
combined operations will be, DEMO more critical it is that pre-acquisition cultures
are compatible. The seller needs to have a good feeling of the match between
cultures. Spending some DEMO with the other party pre-acquisition is essential
to avoid a disaster. It is in the best interest of the seller for the acquisition to DEMO
successful, even several years after the deal is done. Where there DEMO a choice
between potential acquirers, the seller should give the culture DEMO serious
thought.
If the potential buyer has made prior acquisitions, part DEMO your due
diligence on them should be to examine the success or failure of their previous
acquisitions. Serious acquirers understand this and should be DEMO for you to
interview the founders and some of the former executives who stayed with the
merged business and perhaps some of those who DEMO

Connections between buyer and seller are often related DEMO mutual customers,
suppliers and strategic partners.
Do I have to sell the whole business?
Many business owners only think of selling the DEMO business without
considering whether it could be sold off in parts. In fact, the total sale proceeds
may be significantly more if the business is sold in stages, perhaps to different
buyers. Not only will selling off over time potentially make more money for
the shareholders, it can be a very useful way of restructuring or refocusing the
business.
Many DEMO grow in an unstructured manner. Investments are often
made over time to suit the personal interests of the owners or to solve temporary
problems. DEMO those investments end up with a life of their own and develop
into significant parts of the business. Many family businesses grow this way DEMO
end up spread across a range of activities which are sometimes only loosely
integrated. In fact, when it comes to deciding what makes the most sense or
the most money, there are often parts of the business which should be sold off.
One harvesting strategy is to prepare DEMO part of the business for sale at
a time. Where there are different parts of the business operating in different
markets and with different DEMO or services, this should be relatively
easy. The objective is to DEMO each business unit as a separate stand-
alone business and then prepare it for new ownership. This is often easier to
resource and certainly DEMO to manage if there are very different buyers for
the different activities. Proceeds from each sale can either be channeled back
into the core DEMO or given to the shareholders. Alternatively, the business
can be restructured DEMO allow some shareholders to cash out thus providing a
way of concentrating the shareholding or providing flexibility to bring in new
shareholders.
140
Invest2 Exit
Chapter seven: Finding Strategic Buyers
Often when I investigate a firm to prepare a sale strategy, I uncover a variety
of underlying assets and capabilities which will appeal to two or more very
different DEMO In order to optimize the overall sale price, I will recommend
DEMO the firm be split up with each part being specifically targeted for a selected
set of potential buyers. This process takes time and money DEMO thus a phased
approach is often the most sensible strategy. Of course, it is also true that a
complex business is often hard to sell because it may not have an obvious buyer.
I have also DEMO situations where one part of the business is worth more by
itself than the value which was originally assigned to the whole firm. The DEMO
of the parts is often worth more than the whole.
Final Selection
From the information you have gathered and your own understanding of the
DEMO, develop a final selection criteria and use this to screen the DEMO
candidates. I develop a list of ideal buyer attributes and use those to screen
potential buyers. This could extend to 12-15 attributes covering size, location,
markets, acquisition history, culture and so on. If this DEMO produces 5 – 8 ideal
candidates, you would stop there as DEMO is sufficient to develop the sale process.
If there are not sufficient ideal candidates, you do need to source further
potential buyers. Almost without exception, not all potential buyers will be able
to act on the opportunity at the time you wish to sell thus you need a DEMO of
possible buyers. At the same time, a long list is DEMO You simply won’t
have the time and energy to work on the relationships to bring them to the
table at the right time.
If DEMO are unsure of the worth of some of the potential buyers, DEMO can
simply approach them with details of what you have and ask for an expression
of interest. This will help cut down the number DEMO some will exclude themselves.
Once you have the list of potential buyers, you need to work out what you
have to do to make a compelling case for them. A major part of the preparation
is DEMO ensure that the buyer can quickly exploit the strategic assets or capabilities.
I call this ‘enabling the opportunity’ which I will cover in the DEMO chapter.
141
Enabling
8 the Opportunity
reating the strategic value for the buyer to DEMO is not
Csufficient for you to maximize the sale value of your business.
You also need to structure the business in a way which DEMO assist the
buyer to quickly execute on the opportunity. This may require you
to build a launch platform, identify strategic partners, set out DEMO plan
for scaling capacity and change your business to reduce integration
issues.
The value which you will receive for your business is directly
related DEMO the level and timing of the revenue and profit which the
buyer can extract from your strategic value. The longer it takes for
the DEMO to exploit that value, the less it is worth to them.
DEMO more distant the expected benefits and the higher the degree
of uncertainty that the benefits will be achieved, the less pressure
you can create to get the deal signed. Future benefits are discounted
back to the DEMO to arrive at the NPV of the opportunity. The higher
the NPV, the more you can offer as value you bring to the buyer. The
more distant the benefits and the longer it takes the buyer DEMO exploit
the opportunity, the lower the NPV and the less the DEMO of your
business is to them.
142
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
Looking at this from the opposite viewpoint, the quicker the buyer can exploit
the benefits, the DEMO certain the projected profits and the sooner the revenue
and profits are earned, the higher the NPV and therefore the greater potential
sale value of the business. Your objective, therefore, must be to create a DEMO of
conditions that enable the rapid integration of your business into the buyer’s
and a roll out of the program to exploit the opportunity.
DEMO basic questions you should be asking yourself are:
What does my business need to look like at the time of sale?
What DEMO I do to allow the buyer to more easily exploit the opportunity?
What can I do to enable the buyer to generate new DEMO earlier?
Reducing Integration Time and Costs
Once you have identified potential buyers, you can start reviewing your own
business to identify how your business might be more rapidly integrated into
that of the buyer.
One DEMO my workshop attendees put it like this;
“The more i look like the buyer, the easier it will be for them to buy me.”
In essence, what he was saying is that, where there DEMO fewer differences in
culture, remuneration, entitlements, processes and so on, the easier it is for
the buyer to integrate the new subsidiary. DEMO this is an ideal, there may be
a number of things DEMO you can do to reduce the time, cost and stress of
DEMO
Old products
Are there any products or services which you are currently offering that
would not be of interest to the buyer or would DEMO the focus of the
potential buyer away from the main opportunity? DEMO products tend to
come with customer obligations, perhaps dedicated staff, equipment,
inventory and so on. Perhaps these could be sold off prior DEMO the sale of
the core business.
143
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
Parts of the business that are not relevant
Are there parts of the business which are not DEMO to the value being
acquired? It might be better to carve DEMO off into a separate company
and keep this out of the deal or sell it off in advance. For example, you
might be able to do a management buyout of those parts of the business
not DEMO to the opportunity for the buyer. This would have the effect
of speeding up due diligence, reduce the time to integrate the operations
and reduce the cost to the buyer of having to deal with redundant
DEMO
Adherence to standards
Are there standards which you should be using relating to areas such as
design, manufacturing, packaging and so on, which the buyer will want to
implement prior to rolling out the new DEMO or services? Can these be
implemented prior to the sale?
DEMO interfaces
Are there interfaces or interface capabilities that would need to be
incorporated into products or services before they can be rolled out? Are
these able to be incorporated prior to the sale or could you DEMO changes
to the products or services to ease the work required to implement them?
Customer, supplier and partnership agreements
If you can see that some or all of your agreements will need to be changed
DEMO allow you to sell the business and transfer capability to the buyer, these
changes should be implemented in advance. If the agreements need to be
modified to bring them into line with the buyer’s standard agreements, you
should investigate how you can assist with these changes by making DEMO
prior to the sale or by getting advance agreement with your customers,
suppliers and partners to the changes prior to the sale of DEMO business.
Information system interfaces
It is almost certainly the case that your internal financial reporting and
other application systems will need to be replaced DEMO those of the buyer
or they will need to interface with them. You should investigate the
144
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
capabilities within your own systems to ensure that you have as much
interface capability as possible. To DEMO extent that you can anticipate the
requirement and plan for it, DEMO integration and handover task is eased.
Remuneration and entitlement alignment
There are always problems when businesses merge where remuneration
packages and entitlements to vacations, public holidays, bonuses and so
on, are different. You might want DEMO investigate these arrangements in your
potential buyers to see what possible misalignment might occur. It might
be worth offering a special bonus on sale DEMO your employees to cancel
or alter any existing entitlements so that the buyer has the flexibility to
implement their own compensation packages.
Succession plan
DEMO buyer will be concerned at the number of people leaving the business
at the time of sale or shortly after. They will want to DEMO assured that the
key people are retained within the business and that the management
capability to operate the business is in place post sale. DEMO is to be expected
that a number of senior executives will wish to leave within a short period
after the sale. Most senior executives DEMO small firms prefer to work at
a senior level and may be uncomfortable working at a lower level in a
large corporation. As well, these individuals, who are most likely cashed
up from the sale, DEMO want to use their newly acquired wealth to pursue
other interests.
It is important to ensure that the knowledge and capabilities within the
business DEMO adequately protected. This could be secured by ensuring that
successors are in place for senior executives, key employees are paid a
retention bonus for staying on with the buyer and that information within
the business is DEMO documented. You need to be able to assure the buyer
that they will be able to effectively transition the business knowledge to
their own DEMO
Transition arrangements
The firm should be sensitive to ensuring that the buyer is supported
throughout the transition period. Thus it may be worth considering
DEMO
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
retaining senior executives under a consulting arrangement for a limited
period of time to assist the buyer DEMO transition the business across to new
management. Rather than allow the buyer to imagine risks in the transition,
the firm can address these DEMO in advance and offer solutions. The
more that perceived risks can be addressed with acceptable solutions, the
more willing the buyer will be to go forward with the deal. This solution
also offers greater flexibility for DEMO buyer to encourage senior executives
to stay if they need them, DEMO ensures that the risk of them leaving is
addressed. It also means they could terminate them earlier if necessary.
Cancellation of external relationships
In DEMO cases the buyer will have a capability which will replace an
existing arrangement with an external supplier or distributor and they will
wish to DEMO the seller’s existing arrangements. The buyer may also
have their own preferred agreements which they wish to apply after the
sale. In anticipation of DEMO a possibility, the firm should have agreements
in place which allow DEMO termination. The firm should also have in place
arrangements which allow the transfer of any rights under agreements
to the buyer. Of course, the opposite might also apply. An arrangement
might be cancelled by a supplier DEMO the sale of the business and the firm
will need to have alternative arrangements in place.
Exploiting the Opportunity
Many acquired businesses are not DEMO to be scaled because the knowledge
that the business uses to generate revenue is locked up inside the heads of the
founders or key DEMO For the business to expand other people need to
acquire the knowledge or the knowledge needs to be codified and/or de-skilled.
When the DEMO is reviewing the potential of the business, they are going to
DEMO to estimate the time and cost of putting the business on a growth footing.
If they have to extract company intelligence first, it may look problematic as
there is always a danger of getting it wrong DEMO/or losing the people who have
the knowledge.
An essential part of the value proposition to the potential buyer is to show
them how DEMO can easily exploit the revenue potential. If the systems are
146
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
already in place to do this, the risk to the buyer reduces and the time to payback
on the investment may well reduce. Both these elements lend themselves to
DEMO more to the price you can extract at time of sale.
Clearly the opportunity is worth more to the buyer if the benefits can DEMO
received earlier and the risks of exploiting the opportunity can be reduced.
Thus the firm needs to put itself into the position of the DEMO and think
through the activities which the buyer will have to undertake to rapidly exploit
the opportunity. Perhaps this is best understood by making DEMO assumptions
about the rollout program.
Assume that the buyer:
• Wants to launch the new product or service as quickly as possible;
DEMO Is willing to provide the necessary funds to undertake the program;
• Will allocate the necessary management capability inside the cor-
poration to DEMO the activity;
• Will deploy the new capability as widely and as quickly as possible
if the costs of doing so can be DEMO recovered by new revenue,
and
• Wants to minimize possible risks.
A good rule of thumb for any acquisition is to set a DEMO of breakeven or
into profit within two years. Generally speaking corporations are prepared to
fund new projects or programs where they can clearly see DEMO positive return on
the investment inside two years. However, the sooner DEMO program can be
cash positive, the more positive the buyer’s interest.
DEMO are two considerations arising from this approach. For the seller, they
DEMO be aware that the size of the gross margin achieved from new revenue in
the first two years is probably the limit on what DEMO value of the acquisition is
to the buyer. Anything which can be done by the seller to assist in higher and
earlier revenue will DEMO impact on the sale price of their business.
For the buyer, DEMO acquisition which has a quick payback is going to be much
more attractive. Whatever they are likely to offer as a purchase price will DEMO
strongly influenced by the likely gross margin generated by the new revenue in
147
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
the first two years. The more they can earn in this period, the more they will be
willing to bid to be the successful buyer.
Working out how best DEMO deploy a new capability to maximize revenue within
two years of the sale of the firm and how to bring it into profit early, is part
of the planning that the firm should do in order DEMO articulate the opportunity
to the potential buyer. If you think through the process which will need to be
undertaken by the buyer to scale DEMO activity, you will have a better appreciation
of what the buyer DEMO need to do to exploit the opportunity.
What can you do now and over the period before the business is sold
to make that DEMO more effective?
I normally work on a two year preparation program prior to the date of
anticipated sale of the firm. That is:DEMO
What can i do over the next two years to put in place a platform from
which the buyer can launch a program to DEMO the opportunity?
Even though this may require an investment by the seller during that two
year period, the more revenue the buyer can generate in the two years after the
sale, the higher the potential sale value of the firm. Since you don’t know when
you will DEMO to sell the business or receive an offer to sell the business, you
really can’t afford to delay this preparation. So assume you will sell the business
in two years and then, if you delay the sale, at least you will be well prepared
when you do.
Given an objective of rapid deployment after the sale;
What can you DEMO over the next two years prior to the sale to enable
that to happen?
Are you able to go to the potential buyer DEMO say;
“i can make this work for you because we have built a capability and
put in place a set of circumstances and DEMO that will support your
rapid rollout of this opportunity”.
148
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
Put yourself in the position of the buyer and try to work out what problems
they would DEMO to solve to enable this opportunity.
To what extent can you resolve these problems in advance?
The key to a premium on sale DEMO to create a platform from which the acquirer
can rapidly achieve the benefits they seek in the acquisition. A strategic buyer
will be interested DEMO the rate at which the strategic asset or capability can be
replicated or scaled. The anticipated speed of execution impacts the value of
the DEMO to the buyer and greatly influences the price which the seller will
receive.
Documentation
It is likely that many more people will need to DEMO involved in order to
scale up the program. Are you able to provide the necessary documentation
of the product, process, systems, implementation activities and so on,
to support rapid deployment? Knowledge cannot be in the heads of the
current employees if many more people are going DEMO be involved.
Support for a scaled activity
•
•
•
•
If you were asked to support an activity, 10, 50 or 100 DEMO what you are
doing right now:
What would the product or service need to look like and what sup-
porting activities would this DEMO?
are you able to put the underlying support structure in place to en-
able the buyer to quickly move to those levels?
DEMO you were asked, for example, to train sales staff, product DEMO
strators, implementation and support staff in large numbers, how
would you prepare for such an activity?
What would you need to have DEMO place to quickly move to a much
higher level of activity?
149
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
Arranging capacity
Some products and services require additional specialized capacity to
support a higher level of activity. DEMO might be a manufacturing capability
or a help desk, implementation or DEMO capability. You may need to
ensure you have access to adequate supplies of components, ingredients
or supplies to support a scaled up operation. While the buyer might have
their own plans on how to do this, you might be in a better position to
assess the needs. You DEMO screen potential suppliers or you might wish
to identify potential sources of manufacturing capacity or manpower and
have an option which the buyer can DEMO up to gain resources, or have
a letter of intent which DEMO buyer can activate in order to speed up the
launch capability.
If the buyer needs to implement new internal systems, processes or
capabilities in order to undertake the release of a new product, you might
be able to source external capability to allow an earlier launch with a
DEMO transition to in-house capabilities. Whatever you can do to ensure
an earlier generation of revenue you should do.
Building strategic partnerships
Some products or DEMO require complementary skills or resources in
order for them to be delivered. If you are able to define these requirements
in advance of a DEMO up operation, could you also identify, screen and
gain agreements for such services.
For example, say you had a business which would be very attractive to
a multi-national software corporation. You have an application which
DEMO be sold to global end-users but you need a consulting organization
to implement it which your potential buyer does not have. Assume that
the DEMO to the global end-user are significant and the earlier they
are delivered the more the end-user saves. You could identify a global
consulting service DEMO could implement the solution and you could
work out an agreement for the deployment of consulting services, a
program of staff training and a support desk capability which they would
implement to support the program. Your DEMO to your potential
150
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
buyer can now show how the product could be delivered to end-users
with minimal delay.
Creating immediate DEMO opportunities
The ultimate opportunity might be enhanced if you were able to deliver
to the buyer a large scale customer project. While you might DEMO have the
capability of delivering on the project yourself, the buyer DEMO see this
as a way of bringing the acquisition into positive cash flow very quickly. It
also demonstrates the credibility and capability of the DEMO term potential
of the business.
Implementing reference sites
A large scale rollout, especially across multiple geographies, may require
a small number of reference DEMO to demonstrate the key features of the
product or service. This might be the case, for example, where the product
needs to demonstrate DEMO language capability, the ability to handle
certain types of transactions or DEMO specific problems. References might
be achieved for certain types of consumer products by having them
associated with high profile personalities. Having the product in DEMO right
places, with the right people or being used for the DEMO applications, will
assist a more rapid ramp up of sales for DEMO buyer.
Localization
Products which you intend to scale internationally might need to have
some localization changes or support. This could be local language, local
reference customers, packaging requirements, technical standards and/
or support for DEMO transactions such as tax or payment methods.
While it may be expensive to do every one which will be needed, you
might make underlying changes in the product to enable these to be done
more quickly DEMO more cost effectively. It would be sensible to implement
in your products those changes which would be required for the largest
markets in order DEMO speed up time to market in those markets. Where
customers are skeptical of the capabilities, you might wish to implement
reference sites in those sectors or geographies.
151
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
Building market awareness and reputation
In most sales situations, there is a lag between introducing a product into
a market and general awareness of the product and acceptance of DEMO
benefits. To the extent that you can reduce time to market for the buyer
by building awareness in the buyer’s target markets prior to DEMO sale of
the business, you will increase short term market acceptance DEMO build
credibility for the acquisition with shareholder’s and market analysts.
Market awareness might be achieved through trade exhibitions, selective
advertising, public relations and DEMO briefing industry market analysts.
Building a prospect pipeline
In a situation where your value on sale is related to the level of revenue
generated DEMO the buyer in the first two years of the acquisition, it DEMO
help in the sale negotiations to have a database of prospects. These can
be handed over for the buyer to act on. The better DEMO the prospects
are, the more valuable they are to the buyer.
DEMO licenses, rights, approvals, registrations, etc
Some products and services will require the product or the seller to
have certain approvals, registrations, DEMO or licenses to practice or to
undertake product sales. To the extent that these are already in place,
the time to market is DEMO In any situation where these are difficult
to obtain, time consuming DEMO costly, resolving this prior to the sale makes
the acquisition more DEMO
Put Yourself into the Buyer’s Shoes
Few people think beyond the sale of their business to see what the buyer
would need to do DEMO fully exploit the business potential. They see that the buyer
has the resources or the distribution channel to absorb their product or service
but DEMO don’t’ take into account what the buyer would need to do to bring the
product to market inside a large corporation across a large DEMO They fail
to appreciate that the ability of the buyer to rapidly deploy their product or
service directly impacts the current value of the DEMO opportunity facing the
152
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
buyer. Clearly, the more DEMO is worth to the buyer, the more the buyer should be
DEMO to pay to acquire it.
Nor do they consider how they could enable the buyer to maximize the
opportunity. They fail to consider how DEMO effort, time and cost the buyer will
need to expend to DEMO the business to support a much larger marketplace.
Clearly, the greater DEMO effort required, the more additional resources are
needed and the greater DEMO incurred, the longer it is going to take. The
longer it DEMO, the lower the NPV of the opportunity. Yet, without a great deal
of effort or expense, the seller may be able to create the capability which could
dramatically reduce the time, cost and resources needed. The seller may be
able to work with external agencies, suppliers, DEMO and the media to
speed up market penetration through such elements as reference sites, icon
users, public relations and so on.
Another critical DEMO of the buyer’s rollout is that the acquired firm will
need to provide resources to the buyer’s program while continuing to run their
existing DEMO Few buyers are prepared to undermine an on-going business
by stripping out key capabilities to support a large scale rollout. Instead, rollout
will be delayed until additional capabilities can be recruited and trained. So a
key DEMO a firm needs to ask of itself is,
“how can i build a capability that i can release to support a buyer’s
program DEMO continuing to operate the current business?”
This additional capability may need to be built and staffed in advance of the
sale and then DEMO dedicated to the buyer to allow the buyer to launch
a large scale program.
You need to build a scenario for how the buyer DEMO exploit your strategic
value. Assuming the funds and internal support are not constraints, how would
a buyer best scale a program to maximize the revenue? Now work out what
the buyer would need to have in place to launch such a program. Working back
from there, build a program of activities that will create as much of the launch
platform DEMO you can.
153
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
I typically work on a two year program, but if you already have much of the
capability in place, you might be able to complete the list earlier.
What you should be aiming to do is build a compelling case for DEMO buyer
to move forward with the deal. You want to show them that the resources
and activities required to exploit your strategic value have DEMO thoroughly
examined and that you have built a capability and an environment that will
allow rapid exploitation at minimal risk and delay. In crude DEMO – you want
them to be able to taste success. You should be able to say to the potential
buyer that you have removed DEMO many possible impediments and constraints
to scaling the opportunity that you could and that you are delivering to them
a highly probable large scale DEMO and profit opportunity which can show
benefits quickly.
Creating Additional Strategic Value
Whether you have existing products, services or processes that can be scaled
or would be attractive to the potential buyers, there is a good case for using the
time available until you sell the business to DEMO new forms of value for the
buyer.
One way you can do this is by changing your products, services and processes
so that they become more compatible with those of the potential buyer. For
example, can your products be redesigned to better complement the current
range of the DEMO product portfolio. Are there features you could add which
would be of benefit to the buyer’s customers. Whatever you can do to make
yourself DEMO your products and services more attractive to the buyer will improve
your value.
You might also look at where your potential buyer can use DEMO current
products, services or technology to open new revenue opportunities and DEMO
create new products, services or processes which they can exploit. Wjat DEMO
could you do to enhance those opportunities? Another possibility is to DEMO ways
in which you can increase productivity or reduce expenses in your operations
which can be exploited by the buyer across a much larger DEMO Firms
that basically sell commodity products can generate value by developing
154
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
management applications or better business processes that can bring cost
savings to a larger organization.
Some businesses DEMO create platforms for revenue generation even though
they are not able to exploit it themselves. Thus developing IP and registering new
patents may create DEMO value. Acquiring new rights though agreements,
licenses, registrations, purchase options or outright purchase may also create
potential value for an acquirer.
The DEMO Concept
The value that the potential buyer places on your business will relate to what
they are going to do with the strategic asset DEMO capability, which may not be the
same as what you are DEMO doing.. The value to them will relate to their
market and their capability rather than yours. Thus their investment will be
set against their DEMO and profit from the acquisition not your revenue and
profit. Even if you were to enhance your profitability, it may make no difference
to the value of the acquisition to them and may have no effect DEMO the ultimate
price they are willing to pay.
In many strategic acquisitions, the asset or capability being acquired will
be leveraged through the corporation’s existing distribution channel. In these
situations, it may be quite irrelevant as to whether the acquired business is
making a profit or a loss. DEMO fact, the size of the business itself may be irrelevant
to DEMO extent.
The major consideration of the potential buyer will be whether the acquired
firm has the underlying capability to support the exploitation of the DEMO
asset or capability being acquired. Many firms with strategic value make the
mistake of putting their effort into growth in revenue and profit when, in fact,
this is not the basis on which they will DEMO their maximum sale value. In
practice, seeking growth may, in some cases, reduce their strategic value
because the acquirer then has to deal with legacy customers and staff they may
not want.
The key consideration DEMO a strategic sale strategy is to grow the firm only to
the level of revenue and profit that is necessary to provide the critical DEMO that
155
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
would allow the acquirer to properly exploit the potential. Once that size is
reached, additional surplus funds should be put into enhancing resilience and
developing additional strategic value for DEMO potential buyer.
While the pursuit of additional profit may not impact the ultimate sales
price, some profit is useful to ensure survival and resilience. The firm must still
generate cash to build out its strategic assets DEMO capabilities and needs to have
something in reserve to avoid mistakes. Also, it is not possible to predict when
the sale might occur, DEMO the firm needs to plan to stay in business until a sale
can be negotiated.
Since strategic value is coupled to an asset or DEMO, enhancing the
underlying assets or capabilities may add more value to DEMO sale price than
additional revenue and profit. So instead of pushing the business to achieve
higher levels of revenue and profit, you should be investigating how you can
enhance the strategic value.
This logic flies in DEMO face of conventional wisdom which says that valuation
is based on revenue and profit. But if the maximum sale price is unaffected
by revenue DEMO the margin, you are far better to reduce risks in the DEMO
and concentrate on building resilience so that you can last long enough to be
acquired at a hefty premium.
Instead of funding more growth, the business may be better off selling off
parts of the business DEMO concentrating on further developing its strategic
assets and capabilities.
in my case, i sold a 30 person software business which, at the time,DEMO
was facing insolvency due to a sudden shift in the market and was
making a one million dollar loss. The business was sold to DEMO
for six times revenue. What was clear was that the value to peoplesoft
was generated by their ability to sell my software products directly DEMO
over 1,000 of their existing customers. at about $500,000 per sale, this
represented a very large revenue opportunity. The key to this deal was
that our software products were well suited to exploiting this DEMO
nity within their customer base. furthermore, there was really no other
DEMO
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eight: Enabling the Opportunity
alternatives available to them within the near term. if they didn’t step
up to acquiring our business, they would walk away from the revenue
opportunity and they might be DEMO a competitor to acquire us.
While profitability, customer base and growth DEMO not be important to a
strategic deal, size may matter. In DEMO to deliver a platform from which the
opportunity can be launched, DEMO business needs to have the capability and
capacity to provide the launch platform.
The asset or capability which is destined to provide the source DEMO the revenue
opportunity to the buyer must be in a form or structure which will enable the
buyer to achieve the acquisition objectives. If DEMO business is too small, or the
asset or capability has not DEMO structured for scalability or replication, the
business may not be worth DEMO Thus size matters to the extent that it
allows the buyer to exploit the opportunity. However, beyond that point it may
in fact reduce the value of the business. If the buyer has to discard parts DEMO the
business or close parts down, there may be costs, delays and risks in doing so.
157
9 Reducing Risks to
the Buyer
ne objective you need to keep DEMO mind throughout the exit
Oprocess is to ‘make it work for the buyer’. One of the major
tasks of the seller is to reduce DEMO to the buyer. This will include
anything that exposes the buyer to potential liabilities as well as
situations that cause the buyer to expend DEMO, time and effort to
put the business into an effective and DEMO situation.
The buyer will be interested in evaluating three aspects of the
business before they decide to go ahead with a purchase:
• DEMO are the inherent risks in the business being ac-
quired?
• What issues will they have to deal with in the change of
DEMO?
• What costs, delays, problems and stresses will they ex-
perience in achieving the acquisition objectives.
The smart seller anticipates these aspects DEMO the buyer’s evaluation
and puts in place a program to reduce, DEMO or mitigate risks.
They set out to ensure that the change of ownership process is
smooth and set the business up in such a DEMO that it provides the
best platform for the buyer to achieve their acquisition objectives.
158
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
Most large companies that have undertaken a number of acquisitions will
have experienced acquisition disasters. DEMO are often things that they knew
about going into the deal, DEMO agreed to accept as part of the transaction. More
often, however, there are things that are uncovered after the deal has been
consummated DEMO turn up progressively over time. The smart ones learn from
their mistakes and have a rigorous due diligence process which they undertake
prior to DEMO the deal. They also have legal remedies and a project control
system following the acquisition to manage surprises.
For the buyer, risks in the deal are anything that will cause delays in exploiting
the opportunity. This DEMO anything that creates costs, reduces effectiveness
or impacts on time to DEMO the acquisition or to take advantage of the
assets and capabilities acquired. Additional risks for the buyer are those things
that required further investigation DEMO were not able to be undertaken prior to
the deal closing. Risks are both things that can be seen and things that cannot
be DEMO For example, an employee intellectual property (IP) agreement may
show DEMO the firm owns all inventions from its employees. Missing signed IP
agreements from past employees may however create a potential claim later
on.
Observed DEMO:
• Non standard customer contracts
• Non standard supplier agreements
• Harsh lease conditions
• Loose IP agreements
• Overly generous reward and DEMO systems
• Generous options schemes
• Generous health or vacations benefits
• Poor reporting systems
• Harsh compliance requirements
• Out of date equipment DEMO poor quality products
159
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
Missing information:
• Lack of clear IP ownership
• Lack of documented processes, procedures or instructions
• Unclear customer obligations
• Missing performance information
• Successes DEMO failures not understood
• Information on cost structures or recurring revenue
• Data about sales process, sales cycles, closure rates
• Intentions of DEMO employees
The acquiring firm undertakes the transaction to solve their problem
(DEMO) or to execute on an opportunity. To the extent that uncovered DEMO
reduce their probable outcome or delays their time to execute, the DEMO of
the potential acquisition declines. In some cases the threat will go away or be
reduced in potential impact through external events or because DEMO uncover
an alternative solution. Opportunities may decline with time or they may find
another way of undertaking it. In almost all cases, the expiration of time is at
the expense of the selling firm. Either the DEMO will drop or the deal will go
away. Therefore, understanding potential DEMO to the buyer and resolving them
prior to an acquisition deal is the best way of preparing a business for sale.
Due Diligence
Once DEMO parties have agreed the business terms of the acquisition, the
potential DEMO will proceed to a full analysis of the investment opportunity.
At this point analysts, lawyers and accountants acting on behalf of the acquirer
will undertake a due diligence investigation.
The buyer will incur considerable costs in DEMO investigation and they will
want to ensure that the selling firm is acting in good faith during this period. To
protect themselves, the buyer may request that the seller execute an exclusivity
agreement where the seller DEMO not to proceed with acquisition discussions
with any other party during the due diligence period. A penalty may be agreed
for a breach of DEMO condition. Alternatively, in a competitive bidding process,
160
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
there may be a shortlist of parties that undertake the due diligence assessment
concurrently.
One DEMO of the due diligence process is to investigate the firm to see
if the business itself has any major problems which have not been DEMO in
the information already provided to the acquirer. The due diligence process will

A key part of the due diligence process is for the buyer to identify anything
that would incur DEMO costs, create delays or expose the buyer to actual

A business that is effectively and efficiently run, has good customer,DEMO
distributor and supplier relationships and has good internal reporting systems
that monitor performance, ensure adherence to compliance regulations and
protect the business from mistakes should have few problems in satisfying the
buyer.
After the firm has DEMO the buyer with regard to its current operations,
the buyer will turn their attention to an examination of those aspects of the
future DEMO of the business that are critical to achieving the integration
synergy and/or exploitation of opportunities presented by the acquisition.
For example, they may wish to validate the business projections and other
planned targets and milestones DEMO underpin the seller’s business plan. Or
they may wish to validate the size and viability of the opportunity to generate
new revenue based on DEMO acquired assets and capabilities of the seller’s
business. If achieving these targets is critical to meeting the ROI conditions of
the investment, this is the area that exposes the buyer to the greatest risks. This
investigation DEMO review the following:
• The identification of the prospective customer and the quality of the
benefits the customer gains from the product or DEMO;
• The size and growth rate of the prospective market;
• The size, strength and strategies of current and potential competitors;
• The quality of the intellectual property underpinning the projections;
163

Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
• The quality of the sales, marketing and distribution strategies proposed;
• The likely ability of the management team to be able to execute the plan;DEMO
Availability of executive and specialized staff needed to deliver on the
plan;
•
A detailed review of the likely cash flow over the DEMO investment
period.
•
As the business gets older and more complex, DEMO data needed to support a
full due diligence becomes more extensive and probably harder to uncover. Few
early stage businesses have the filing disciplines DEMO keep adequate records or
to file them in a manner which allows ready retrieval many years later. Smaller
businesses may not take the trouble DEMO document management or board
decisions and then later find that they cannot find the authorities that allowed
them to make significant decisions that may DEMO affected stakeholder rights.
This opens up the door for possible litigation from minority shareholders or
other vested interests.
The best path for the potential DEMO is to undertake a vendor due diligence.
This is a due diligence activity that is undertaken by professional advisors on
behalf of the seller DEMO from the viewpoint of a potential buyer. The outcome
should be an action plan for the seller on what they need to do to DEMO their
business up to date and in a position where they could meet the due diligence
requirements of a potential acquirer. So rather than DEMO surprised or penalized
in the acquisition process, the seller who is DEMO for due diligence has
everything ready for the due diligence investigation.
It is unlikely that any firm can submit to the due diligence inspection
DEMO there being some issues that need to be resolved. Firms that have not
considered due diligence and have let compliance slide, are late with meeting
new regulations or have inadequate internal information systems, may have a
lot of work to do to bring themselves up to the mark. DEMO it could easily take 18
months to 2 years just to put in all the performance and compliance monitoring
systems to ensure that these DEMO of the business will be ready for a due
diligence review. Since these systems should be there anyway, this is money
well spent and should be done whether the business was being prepared for
sale or DEMO

Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
When you undertake a due diligence review of your business you will
inevitably uncover numerous DEMO that need attention. Some activities may
simply be to bring files up to date and make information about company
operations available in a more DEMO and understandable format. Other
items will require the implementation of new compliance reporting and
monitoring systems, installation of new financial recording and analysis systems,
restructuring of roles and responsibilities and so on. These are aspects DEMO your
business that will have immediate payback in the current business but will also
produce a more effective and efficient business for the new DEMO
The acquisition may be based on some level of integration of the seller’s
business with the acquirer’s existing business. The buyer due diligence process
DEMO need to identify where integration needs to occur, the likely priority DEMO
timing of such an integration and the capability and willingness of the respective
staff to make it happen. Included in that review will be DEMO such as:
• The need to open or close new offices, warehouses and manufacturing
locations;
• The extent to which staff will be relocated, reassigned or have
conditions of employment, remuneration, health benefits, entitlements,
responsibilities or reporting lines changed;
• The extent to which information systems need to be integrated, merged
or interfaced;
• The extent to which the cultures of those units which need to DEMO
integrated are alike;
• Whether suppliers, agents and distributors will DEMO and what costs
and disruptions will occur if they are not.
Integration will take time, utilize senior executive time and require funding.
These costs and delays need to be factored into the investment evaluation.
To the DEMO that uncovered risks reduce the probability of achieving
the desired outcome or delay the time to execute, the value of the potential
investment declines. In some cases, the problems can be overcome by installing
additional controls, renegotiating agreements and putting in place alternative
strategies. However, these may DEMO in additional costs or delays in executing
165
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
the plan. To the extent that problems cannot be easily resolved or structural
changes are DEMO to implement, the investment will incur greater risks. At
some point DEMO buyer will decide that the risks are too great and will decide not
to make the investment.
You need to see the integration process DEMO a cost to the acquirer and whatever
the cost it will be deducted from the potential gain from the acquisition. The
more you can DEMO the costs, time and stress of integration, the higher the
potential value that can be assigned to your business.
Aspects of integration which DEMO can influence in advance of a sale include:
Moving customers and suppliers over to new relationships and systems,
perhaps rewriting contracts, agreements and trading arrangements;
•
Shifting business from some distributors and suppliers DEMO those which
have pre-existing arrangements with the acquirer;
•
Closing down duplicate offices, warehouses and manufacturing facilities.
This might include redundancies or relocating staff;
•
Shifting financial reporting systems and transaction systems across to DEMO
common administrative system;
•
Realigning remuneration, health, pension, vacation DEMO other
entitlements;
•
• Replacing staff who have left;
Changing job descriptions, responsibilities and reporting lines;
•
Re-branding products and services and re-designing sales collateral.
•
Ask yourself how you can help streamline DEMO of these processes with your
target acquirers. For example, do you DEMO termination and/or change of
ownership clauses in your contracts? Are DEMO using industry standard terms of
trade? Are your products based on DEMO industry interface standards and
use common industry components?
Take a good hard look at your business and ask yourself if everything you are
DEMO makes sense and if it is contributing to adding value to a potential buyer.

Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
It need not generate more revenue or even reduce costs for your business right
now DEMO consider the impact on the buyer. Whatever you can do to make the
business easier to manage, increase the productivity, or allow the DEMO to focus
on exploiting the potential can increase the value proposition.
Remember that your buyer may have other firms to look at. All other DEMO
being equal, the one that is the least effort to exploit DEMO going to be the preferred
deal.
If the investigation results in an agreement to proceed with the investment,
the buyer will incur the DEMO of the due diligence plus the legal fees associated
with the preparation or review of the investment agreement. These will be
factored into the DEMO price paid to the seller. Thus the more due diligence work
needs to be undertaken, the lower the final price to the seller.
The more prepared the seller is for due diligence, the lower the costs of
the task, the shorter the time it will take and the more likely the buyer will go
through with the deal. Thus, it is in the seller’s best interest to fully understand
the due diligence DEMO and undertake as much of the preparation work in
advance.
The advantage that accrues to the prepared firm is that this level of
preparation DEMO to the buyer that the seller understands how to manage
its compliance and operating risks. Since these are often where the greatest
risks for DEMO buyer lie, this is good news to the buyer and should DEMO up the
acquisition process. Where the buyer has a choice of acquisitions, the better
managed one is more likely to also allow the buyer to more quickly execute on
the opportunity. It becomes the preferred purchase.
DEMO firm that is better prepared for a due diligence inspection also presents
itself as being well managed. Firms which are seen to be efficient DEMO find it
easier to secure the support of champions in the purchaser’s organization and
that will help get the deal done. Also never forget DEMO the task of the seller
is to collapse the time to get an agreement. Being efficient and well prepared
creates the best chance of DEMO the deal done quickly and of preserving value
for the seller’s shareholders.
167
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
Creating value is partly psychological. Buyers go into a deal anticipating
problems and all their DEMO suggests that they can expect them. They
should be delighted when they find a business that operates efficiently and
satisfies their due diligence investigation. DEMO forget that professional advisors
who carry out due diligence projects have to justify their fees and are looking for
ways to reduce the price DEMO by the buyer. If you can create a clean business,
the buyer is likely to reduce the scope of the due diligence work. DEMO won’t be
willing to keep paying professional services fees if the service providers are not
finding anything to justify further work.
Always keep in DEMO the golden rule of selling – the shorter the time it takes
to get the due diligence complete, the higher the price you can expect and the
more likely you will be to get the deal DEMO
Confidentiality
If you are talking to potential buyers about selling the firm, this can lead
to some unfortunate results if handled incorrectly. Competitors can use this
information against you, key employees might decide to leave, DEMO can be
stressed due to uncertainty and become less productive, suppliers DEMO want
early payment and so on. How can this be handled with both external and
internal parties?
External Parties
Probably there is no DEMO right answer and it may well depend on your own
position within an industry. The norms in each industry vary. It may also depend
DEMO how good your existing relationships are with customers, suppliers and
partners.
DEMO Intention:
Some industries, such as the software applications and systems DEMO,
accept that everyone is for sale. Since they are for sale, discussions are
always taking place between parties as to mergers and acquisitions.
Generally, acquisitions take place because a larger party can better scale
the operations and therefore customers are reasonably well protected.
168
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
Strategic Investor:
Many firms are looking for investment to help them develop their business.
DEMO can often turn into acquisitions. Providing the firm is open about
looking for a partner, it may not be a surprise if that turns into a sale.
Longer Term Objectives:
Many owners are quite open DEMO wanting to retire at some time, or
being open to an DEMO if the offer is a good one. Providing this is not a
secret, the firm is reasonably well protected from rumours.
Private Negotiation:
Some customer deals may be quite sensitive to a possible takeover.
However, provided this is dealt with confidentially and the reasons are
beneficial to DEMO prospective customer, it may be better to declare this
privately to DEMO prospect. If they then hear it from another source, at least
DEMO was not kept from them.
Partnership Deal:
A discussion of a possible acquisition can be portrayed as a partnership or
alliance arrangement. A DEMO corporation which is looking to distribute
your products or enter into a joint venture may wish to carry out
extensive due diligence to protect DEMO Another way in which this
can be explained is through a licensing arrangement. Again, much of the
discussions are similar to those undertaken in an acquisition process but
this public declaration allows the firm to proceed DEMO declaring that
they are going through an acquisition discussion.
If you don’t have to do a deal, you can always simply entertain the possibility
and portray in that light. That is, “if the right deal comes along – of course we
would be foolish not to investigate it”. DEMO is something that any reasonable
business owner would say and should not convey the impression of a firm in
trouble or desperate to do DEMO deal.
If on the other hand, you are desperate to do DEMO deal, the best way to do it is
quickly. The longer DEMO market sees you in trouble, the greater the impact on
169
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
your business. Competitors will be quick to seize the opportunity of undermining
your sales efforts.
DEMO only way to execute a deal quickly and yet still come out with a premium
price, is to be proactive and prepare for a sale. Providing that you know who
the potential buyers are and have DEMO the type of relationship that you
can leverage to get a deal done quickly, you should prevent any major negative
effects on the business.
Consider using a Non Disclosure Agreement to ensure that the other party
DEMO the seriousness of the information you are sharing with them.
Internal Parties
Employees are naturally going to be concerned about any possible major
change DEMO ownership. They will have heard stories of other firms going through
the process and know of redundancies, relocation, changes in work practices,
DEMO, benefits and so on. No doubt some of that will happen DEMO
your firm is sold. So how can you best deal with that?
Make it strategic for employees:
When you seek a company DEMO can scale your operations, overcome your
limitations and provide a larger DEMO for your products and services,
employees are often better off. You should be conveying the message that
you would always be interested in DEMO strategic sale where the employees
may have better career prospects.
Involve Managers and key employees:
Some staff are required to make the transaction DEMO They will be
providing data to the potential buyer as part of the due diligence. They
need to be informed about what is going DEMO and be counselled about the
implications for their jobs. Where there are potential negative impacts on
them, these need to be discussed and a plan put together for mitigating the
effect on them personally. This could DEMO a lump sum payout, redundancy
payment, a longer notice period and so on.
170
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
Provide incentives:
If employees have an incentive to make the transition work, they will tend
to support it more. The incentives could be in the form DEMO shares, options,
bonuses and so on. There needs to be DEMO alignment of the interests of the
shareholders, managers, employees and the new owners.
Employment agreements:
As part of a review of general DEMO conditions, consider
incorporating a bonus at the time of the sale DEMO the business, special
termination conditions if the business is sold and/DEMO special retention
bonuses for key employees. This change can be incorporated into standard
employment conditions along with other updates on health benefits,
maternity DEMO and so on, perhaps based on an external professional
review.
Post DEMO Scenarios
It is possible to put yourself into the position of the prospective buyer and
work out what is likely to happen to the DEMO If you can anticipate issues,
problems or changes which the buyer will experience, can you reduce the impact
of these and improve your attractiveness to the buyer? By working through after
sale scenarios, the DEMO can predict where problems might be encountered. As
these are likely to cause problems in the negotiation, you may be able to fix
these in advance or have solutions which the buyer can implement. By working
DEMO how these might be resolved, the firm can take the initiative DEMO reduce
potential negotiation problems.
Acquiring firms, especially those which have experience DEMO M&A, assume
they will have many issues to deal with DEMO the acquisition. These are generally
associated with the integration of the two firms as well as securing the best
use of the strategic asset DEMO competency they acquire. In considering the likely
situation after the sale, DEMO the following questions:
• Where will the merged firm (yours) be located?
• What will happen to existing facilities, plants, DEMO, offices
which are not required?
171
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
• Which positions are duplicated and therefore which staff will be
made redundant?
• DEMO employees are key to the buyer’s benefits being realized?
How are those staff to be retained?
• What will the new terms DEMO conditions of employment be?
• What happens to employee options and any share purchase
scheme?
• how will health insurance, vacation entitlements and existing bo-
nus systems be translated?
• How is the DEMO to leverage the new acquisition?
• What will happen to existing customers, suppliers and distributors?
• Which partnerships, alliances and joint DEMO need to be termi-
nated or protected?
• What are the owner/managers going to do in the merged com-
pany?
• DEMO if they don’t want some, or all, of the senior management?
• What potential litigation will you have outstanding that will need DEMO
be resolved?
The key to a successful negotiation is to have thought through these questions
in advance of any detailed discussion with the DEMO buyer. To the extent
that these issues can be resolved in advance or options can be presented, the
negotiations will proceed more smoothly.
Generally speaking, it is easier to merge a firm which has standard conditions
throughout its operations. So industry standard contracts with suppliers,
customers, distributors and employees should normally not present a problem.
Overly generous terms of DEMO (salaries, benefits, bonuses, options,
health cover, etc) can seriously damage a potential sale. Since the buyer will most
often have DEMO integrate new employees with their own, any marked differences
where the DEMO employees are better off, will be a serious impediment. It is
DEMO better to have a situation where employees gain through the merger
rather than lose.  Discretionary bonuses and rewards can be used prior to a sale
to provide motivation without any guarantee that these will be continued DEMO the
future. Alternatively, terms of employment can be agreed where aspects DEMO be
172
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
subject to review on a periodic basis. These can then be removed prior to a DEMO
or shortly after.
A firm intending to be sold should also look at the costs of terminating its
various agreements. Since the situation after DEMO sale cannot be predicted,
having options in agreements which allow termination on change of control, or
by putting a formulae or price on termination, allows the firm to estimate the
costs of withdrawal. It also prevents a possible legal claim for damages.
The key question here is DEMO how can you make this work for the buyer?
Put yourself in their shoes. What would the ideal scenario be for the buyer?DEMO
How close can you get to that scenario? The closer you DEMO get, the easier the
negotiation will be. The buyer will be DEMO surprised with the homework
you have done and will see that you understand what they have to do to make
the deal work. The DEMO that you have resolved many of the problems, allows
them to DEMO that you are flexible and will do what you can to resolve potential
problems during the process of negotiation.
Install a Board of Directors
DEMO preparing the business for sale, you should give serious consideration to
DEMO a Board of Directors as part of your sale preparation process.
You may feel that you alone know enough to adequately manage the
business DEMO that the costs and time involved in supporting a Board of Directors
is a waste. You would not be alone in that opinion as DEMO small, medium and
family business owners feel the same way. But DEMO your business is not the
same as positioning it for a sale. In setting a business up for sale, we need to
consider the viewpoint of the buyer and what the buyer would find attractive
in DEMO business. Our objective is to take away from the buyer any hesitations
about the operation of the business as well as reducing the anticipated DEMO
and delays of changing the ownership of the business.
The buyer will be concerned about inherent risks in the business. If the selling
business DEMO systems and processes for reporting to an independent board,
it will indicate to the buyer that the owner is prepared to be accountable DEMO
performance and is prepared to review the business operations with external
173
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
parties. If the process is done properly, the buyer can be confident that the
underlying systems and reporting processes will enable an easier transition
to new ownership. DEMO the Board reporting pack includes operational as well as
financial performance measures, the buyer will have more confidence in the
quality of the business being acquired.
One of the biggest concerns of any buyer is the DEMO that the business rests
on the personal knowledge and contacts of the owner. To the extent that this
exists, the buyer takes the risk that the goodwill and corporate intelligence
will be lost with the departure DEMO the owner. To the extent that the business
has a knowledgeable and independent Board of Directors, the buyer can have
some confidence that the underlying systems are in place to monitor business
operations and that some DEMO the corporate intelligence is shared among the
Board. Thus the buyer has the option of keeping some of the Board members
for a period DEMO  time after the purchase to ensure that knowledge is transitioned
to DEMO management.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of having a Board in place prior to the sale
is that it indicates to the buyer that governance DEMO seen to be important in
the business. It also shows that there are disciplines in place for longer term
planning, risk assessment and accountability, all very good signs of a well run
business. This will all help to give comfort to the buyer and hopefully speed up
the DEMO process as well as increase the sales value.
Prevent the Loss of Key Employees
In the pressure to sell a business, the entrepreneur often forgets that it is a
team sport. While the business owner might DEMO overjoyed to see keen buyers
banging at the door, the rest DEMO the employees may not be so excited. Not only
do they face a change of boss but they will be rightly concerned about their
DEMO employment, their job responsibilities and even whether their desk will
continue DEMO have a window view. If the entrepreneur is to realize the full value
of the business, he or she needs to have the full support of the key employees
throughout the sale process and beyond into DEMO new ownership.
As a business owner or investor, you need to DEMO aside traditional views
of valuation based on EBIT multiples which reflect what you achieved in the
174
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
business and embrace a more realistic view that the value of the business is
what DEMO can achieve for the new owner. Everything we buy, including a DEMO,
only has value for what we anticipate we can harvest from it, whether that be
an experience or a good return on our investment. Thus preparing a business
for sale is simply about anticipating how DEMO can maximize the future value for
the new owner. Much of that value may be tied up in the active and positive
participation of DEMO current employees in the business under new owners. So
what can we do to ensure that the new owner has the full support of DEMO key
employees who will help maximize that future productivity?
We need to examine three areas of concern for the new owner; what
problems, risks and liabilities are inherent in the existing business; how easy
DEMO it be to transfer ownership and, lastly, how confident will the new owner
be that he or she will be able to exploit DEMO potential of the business post-
sale. Firstly, our current employees can DEMO put the business onto a low risk,
profitable and resilient basis. For that to occur we will need their active co-
operation. What DEMO don’t want is for them to be antagonistic or hostile to the
new owners, or to be disruptive or to undermine the sale process. Certainly we
don’t want them to leave because they are concerned about DEMO future with
the business. What we need to do is to involve them in the sale preparation and
due diligence process and give them DEMO incentive to work towards a common
goal of selling the business successfully.
The next stage involves the transition to new ownership. We need to
DEMO confident that the key employees will transition the core knowledge in
the business. To do this successfully there should be incentives involved to
encourage DEMO to stay around in order for the transition to occur.
Lastly, DEMO want the new owner to have the highest chance of successfully
running the business and, possibly, developing it to generate greater revenue
and DEMO We need to consider how we can structure the business to provide
the best platform for that to occur. Again, this may mean some incentives for
the key employees to stay with the new business to DEMO it time to settle down
under new ownership.
The buyer needs to have time to transition the inherent business knowledge
to employees who are DEMO to be employed longer term with the acquirer. Since
175
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
most resignations of newly acquired staff are likely to occur during the first year
of DEMO acquisition, putting in place incentives for key acquired employees to stay
DEMO the transition period can significantly reduce buyer concerns. Where
the vendor has arranged this prior to the sale discussions, the buyer has some
assurance that a major risk can be averted. This not only places the DEMO in a
more positive light but can positively influence the value of the business being
sold.
To do this right, it will require you to allocate some of the sale proceeds
to encourage and compensate key DEMO By preparing the business
properly for the new owner, you are DEMO to significantly increase the price
you achieve for your business. Your investment in your employees will be more
than compensated by the higher sale DEMO
Within the sale preparation process, the senior managers will play a DEMO role.
The major stages are preparation, negotiation, due diligence, integration DEMO
on-going post acquisition operations. Within most of these stages, the current
DEMO are actively involved and they can either help make it work or
scuttle it. Getting their support is, therefore, absolutely necessary.
Many entrepreneurs DEMO believe that they can carry this process off
by themselves and continue to manage the business under new ownership.
However, entrepreneurs typically make poor employees and most smart buyers
know this and so they look to DEMO management team to provide the transition
to new ownership. This view from acquirers is not unreasonable. Entrepreneurs
are used to being in charge, making decisions without justifying them, taking
shortcuts and accepting risks. Thus they don’t fit well into a bureaucratic
structure where they have to report to DEMO boss and take orders. In addition, they
are most likely cashed DEMO, want to take it easy or want to move onto their DEMO
big idea.
Similar logic can be applied to many in the senior management team. The
CFO is unlikely to want to step down to DEMO a branch accountant, the Sales
Director to a Sales Manager or DEMO Marketing Director to a Product Manager.
If they are all used to being part of the strategic decision making process, they
are likely to want to perform that role again. Furthermore, they may have done
well out of the deal and want to move onto another venture. The DEMO line
176
Invest2 Exit
Chapter nine: Reducing Risks to the Buyer
– few of the senior managers will go with the deal or stay long after DEMO deal
is completed. Smart buyers know this and therefore look to the second level
management and key employees to make the transition successful.
The DEMO who wants the deal to be successful must find a way of
gaining the support of second level management and key employees in both
DEMO preparation for sale and in the transition of knowledge across to new
ownership. If the people who have to make the deal work are DEMO of their
future or resent the business being sold, they may DEMO or work to undermine
the process. The entrepreneur therefore needs to bring them into the process
in such a way that they will actively DEMO the sale preparation and will be
willing to transition to the new ownership in order to provide the continuity
needed by the buyer.
Incentives DEMO to be provided to management and key employees to
encourage them to work towards a sale. This means ensuring they have
sufficient incentives in DEMO form of shares, options or bonuses to do so. Those
that DEMO be made redundant need to be provided with a bonus in order to stay
until the sale is completed and then provide them with DEMO buffer to allow them
to be retrained or look for new employment. Those key employees who need to
be retained need to be provided DEMO significant incentives to willingly stay on
for, say, a year to transition the business to the new owners.
Business owners who fail to DEMO these incentives in place risk buyers walking
away from the deal or facing a significant drop in sale price.
Do It Quickly
The best DEMO for all concerned is to have the deal done quickly. This
then leaves little time for staff to become stressed by the whole affair. DEMO
need to prepare a contingency plan for  the sale of the DEMO so that it can
be executed within a short period of time.  The deal negotiation and closure
process can be dramatically reduced through this preparation process which
results in the business being less exposed and less DEMO than if the sale
process was continued over a long period of time.
177
Setting up the
10 Exit Deal
Ufor sale by preparing an information DEMO and then nlike conventional sale strategies which prepare a business
advertising it for sale, the strategic sale needs a lot more preparation
if the best result is to be achieved. Unlike a conventional process
where the DEMO to bid casts a wide net, normally through
multiple private and DEMO channels, the strategic sale focuses on a
set of identified potential DEMO These potential buyers have been
selected because they have the highest chance of exploiting the
strategic value being sold.
Only a small number of DEMO buyers are explored, generally
because each one requires some effort to DEMO into the process. Not
only are they contacted in advance of the business being available
for sale, but time is spent with each one to ensure that they fully
understand the potential being developed and how DEMO could
translate into a strategic opportunity for the buyer.  Because of DEMO
unusual nature of this process, the issues which the seller has DEMO deal
with are somewhat different to a conventional sale.
What is the best way of getting a strategic buyer interested?
If you have DEMO underlying asset or capability which can leverage
a very large revenue opportunity for a national or global corporation,
it should not be difficult DEMO get their attention. The uncertainty most
178
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
entrepreneurs experience in seeking out potential buyers is they don’t know
who the best buyers DEMO be  and are not sure how to get them interested.
However, once you have identified the best potential buyers, the task becomes
significantly easier.
The end game is to be acquired by a large corporation DEMO can exploit your
strategic value. Clearly, the highest price will be DEMO by those corporations who
have the capability, capacity and product/market DEMO which can best exploit
the asset or capability. They will be even more interested in acquiring the
business if you can structure your business DEMO reduce risks in the acquisition,
speed up the integration process and then provide a structure which can rapidly
deploy your product or service. DEMO simply need to let them know what a great
fit you would be for their business.
It is very common for large corporations to DEMO small emerging firms
within their industry in order to secure new innovations or specialized
processes or knowledge. This being the case, the vendor who wants to identify
a strategic buyer need look no further than the DEMO corporations within their
own industry. Almost without exception, the best buyers DEMO come from within
your industry and will have similar customers and competing or complementary
products or services – thus they aren’t that difficult to DEMO
The ideal strategic buyer will normally have complementary or similar
products, DEMO into the same or similar customers, use similar marketing and
sales DEMO and have a track record of undertaking acquisitions. To be a
good strategic target, they should also have a similar culture and have a good
track record of meeting their investment objectives from prior acquisitions.
With DEMO set of criteria, the entrepreneur can readily develop a list of DEMO
prospective buyers. Given that a large portion of acquisitions occur where there
is a formal or informal relationship between the parties, the next task of the
entrepreneur is to develop closer links to the prospective acquirers.
DEMO first step is to get in front of them. You should always keep in mind that
the best acquirers are also frequent acquirers and DEMO have a unit within their
organization whose task it is to identity, evaluate and acquire firms which can
contribute to their corporate strategy. Therefore, there are people inside the
179
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
prospective buyers who are likely to want to talk to you. Your job is to DEMO
contact and encourage them to give you a meeting.
You can achieve this through a variety of channels. You could of course just
contact DEMO directly and ask for a meeting explaining that you have a firm
which might be of interest to them at some time in the DEMO and you simply
want to understand their acquisition criteria and process. While this may not
seem possible, it is surprising how effective this can be.
You can always approach their local subsidiary managers and explain what
DEMO want to do and get them to recommend you. If you are already in the same
industry, you might well know someone who works for the target corporation.
Contact them and ask for an introduction. You DEMO also find out the names of
their Directors and approach one of them either directly or through a contact.
An approach might also be DEMO through your professional service provider.
Most companies within your industry will attend a variety of trade events,
exhibitions, conferences and industry charity functions. You can use these
to make contact with a senior manager of DEMO potential buyer and use that
opportunity to find out how to approach the M&A group, CFO or CEO. If you
find that the right person is always too busy, ask to meet them when they are
attending one of the industry functions. They will normally respect the DEMO that
you are making a lot of effort to meet them and will set some time aside for a
meeting.
The purpose of the DEMO meeting is to simply get on their future acquisition
radar. Once you have their interest, it will be easier to set up subsequent visits
where you can spend more time explaining what you have which would DEMO
them and how you are able to facilitate them making significant revenue out of
an acquisition of your business.
The aim of the entrepreneur DEMO be to educate the prospective buyer on
the future potential of the firm as part of their acquisition strategy. You will also
want to DEMO the opportunity to suggest ways in which the prospective acquirer
might exploit the firm’s underlying assets or capabilities. Once the relationship
is established, the major task of securing a future potential buyer has been
achieved.

If you don’t want to make the approach under the guise of selling your
business, try making an approach to their business development executives
explaining that you DEMO looking to find a strategic partner to help exploit your
innovations. Explain that you are making the approach to them because of the
fit DEMO their existing business and the fact that you are looking for a business
which will have a vested interest in working with you, that is, they have much
to gain out of the partnership. The business development staff will see the
possibilities in an acquisition and alert their DEMO&A department. You haven’t
offered your business for sale but you have achieved your objective of getting
their attention.
I am not for sale!
DEMO you fear that competitors will take advantage of the pre-sale time to raid
your employees and customers, you need a strategy to counter that threat.
Clearly at some point you will need to ratchet up the DEMO of activity as you get
closer to seriously engaging potential buyers and this will increase the danger.
What you need to do is engage DEMO buyers while projecting the image that
you are not for sale.
Many business owners have insufficient competitive advantage to withstand
a determined attack from DEMO close competitor. A small chink in the amour might
be sufficient for an aggressive competitor to undermine the sales message or
create uncertainty in DEMO minds of employees.
A prospective customer evaluating alternative products might hesitate to
buy from a business for sale as they may have concerns about DEMO supply
and support. As well, current employees might be concerned about DEMO future
with the company if they hear that there could be an ownership change. This is
very fertile ground for a competitor seeking to DEMO good staff. The business
owner is now trapped. Any move they make to sell their business could disrupt
their business, reduce their current sales and profits and potentially damage
their sale price.
The firm which has DEMO value is in a somewhat better position than
most as their value is not necessarily eroded by a reduction in growth or profit,
DEMO, they could still have their reputation damaged or lose good staff.
DEMO
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
There are a number of possible approaches to this impasse. Firstly, the
business owner should indicate consistently over time that they would always
be willing to discuss DEMO purchase of the business to a corporation that had the
capability and capacity to develop the business more than the current owners.
If the DEMO owner could better support the customers and provide better career
paths for the employees, then this would be a good solution for both customers
and staff. Such a message is more likely to have a positive DEMO a negative impact
on the market.
Another approach is to develop relationships with all the major potential
buyers so that an open discussion of DEMO trading environment can take place.
Companies working in the same market often have a lot of issues and challenges
in common and these discussions DEMO be used as a basis for sharing information.
During these conversations, DEMO business owner should take the opportunity to
point out how and where their competitive advantage lies and in what way the
businesses complement each DEMO rather than compete. Where possible, the
owner should seek opportunities to DEMO together on joint bids to show how
the combined entity gains revenue. What is being demonstrated is what the
competitor or partner could gain DEMO an acquisition.
While maintaining that the business is not for sale, DEMO owner might also
suggest other business or hobby ventures they might pursue or personal
situations which are demanding more of their time. The objective DEMO this
strategy is to demonstrate how an acquisition would benefit the buyer as well
as be received positively by the seller. While the offer DEMO always be rejected,
it is far better to have offers coming than to have to go cap in hand looking for
a buyer.
DEMO many potential buyers do I need?
It is very difficult to extract the maximum value on the sale of a business if
you DEMO only one potential buyer. Generally speaking, the only way you can DEMO
this is to be in a position where you don’t need to sell but you are willing to so if
your terms and conditions DEMO fully met. Simply by being hard to get, by having
a DEMO which gives you satisfaction and not having any great desire to do
anything else will provide a basis where you force the keen buyer DEMO do all the
running. However, if your business is in trouble DEMO the only potential buyer can
182
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
afford to wait, you will almost certainly be a fire sale and lose much of the value
of your business on sale.
So while one potential buyer DEMO possible, common sense would suggest
that several are much better. The DEMO is, how many is likely to create an
optimum exit? The real issue here is how well you have selected your potential
buyers DEMO than how many. Many possible buyers where none have a burning
desire or need for the acquisition is almost certainly worse than one keen DEMO
Thus an important component of preparation for sale is to ferret out those
companies which have the highest need for what you can offer DEMO are also in a
position where they have the willingness and capability to go through with the
acquisition process.
There are some simple rules DEMO thumb when it comes to identifying possible
buyers. Most buyers are larger companies within the same industry; they
typically have acquisition experience and deal with similar or complementary
products. By doing some industry analysis and working DEMO professional M&A
advisors, it is not difficult to narrow down DEMO list of possible suitors. The next
stage would be to establish contact with them to ascertain their appetite for
new acquisitions, especially for a business like your own.
In the end, you need at least two keen, active potential buyers, each of
which has a clearly expressed DEMO to acquire a business like yours. However,
sometimes timing does not always work in your favour. At the time you wish to
sell, they might be involved in other projects, fighting internal fires, be DEMO
to external threats or have used up their acquisition funds. Thus you cannot
really depend on just a couple of potential starters. What you DEMO need is at
least 6 to 8 active interested buyers. With a little bit of luck, you will be able to
deal with most of them. In the worst case, you can be confident that you will
have at least two left with which to negotiate. Your back DEMO plan should be the
ability to delay until circumstances bring more potential buyers into the process.
Also be very careful not to have too DEMO potential buyers. The best ones
may simply pull out or they may decide the costs of participating in the process
are too high. In DEMO end, it very much depends on your ability to help potential
DEMO understand what you bring to the table and in creating some level of
competitive tension at deal time.
183

Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
How do I protect company secrets?
Many entrepreneurs fear giving away company secrets during DEMO due diligence
process involved in selling their business only to find that the potential buyer
has pulled out and then uses that information to DEMO against them. Since
most firms don’t have the luxury of unique, DEMO or protected assets or
processes, this is a very reasonable position DEMO take. Where you have strategic
value, this is often based on DEMO or deep expertise which is usually more difficult
to copy, even DEMO, imagine how foolish you would feel if you gave away the DEMO
competitive advantage which had created the sale value. However, you still
DEMO to get through the due diligence process for the honest buyer.
What you need to do is to balance the need of the potential DEMO to be
able to assess the quality and impact of your confidential information with your
desire not to give away the store to the DEMO scavenger. To do this you
need to have a process which gets rid of the latter but keeps the former in play.
Thus how DEMO can you provide to satisfy the serious punter while protecting
yourself against the dishonest or opportunistic competitor?
Of course this is not much DEMO a problem when you have strong registered IP.
While patent protection is said to be only worth what you are willing to spend
to DEMO it, remember you will sell out to a large corporation. In DEMO end what
you have is a gorilla buying your IP. Nothing protects IP better than a gorilla
sized corporation ready to defend it. I DEMO let my potential buyers know that
the ultimate buyer will be a gorilla and that they will do whatever it takes to
protect the DEMO advantage they are securing through the acquisition. In
this situation, it DEMO not worth the competitors wasting their time stealing your IP.
However, DEMO all IP and intellectual capital is well protected.
Your best protection against the theft of confidential information during the
sale process is to be DEMO well prepared for the due diligence investigation. This
information can then be released in stages subject to your own due diligence
on the potential DEMO You should be looking for commitment from the buyer
at each stage of the investigation. Buyers who are only fishing will not want to
DEMO much effort in the process and will soon fall away. You should balance their
effort with your own. As they require meetings with management, you should
request similar meetings with theirs. If they ask for more DEMO information,
184
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
you should request similar data from them. If they are not prepared to share
information, you can probably assume that they are not serious and terminate
the DEMO You can also have them sign a non-disclosure document with
damages for use of confidential information.
Your second level of protection is to withhold DEMO information but
have it examined and verified by an independent and credible third party. You
can cite performance data, market statistics and forecasts but hold back the
detail. This data would then only be released to DEMO successful bidder as a final
condition of the sale but could be done in such a way that, if validated, the sale
would DEMO concluded.
Your best strategy against this type of invasion is to have pre-selected the
potential buyers. If you have determined that the potential buyer DEMO a real need
for your business, is capable of funding the DEMO and has the capability
and capacity to make it work, then DEMO should be dealing with genuine buyers
who would rather buy than copy. By ensuring you have several willing potential
buyers and being well prepared DEMO due diligence, you can also speed up the
sale process and DEMO reduce the exposure period. In the end, you will
have to DEMO some level of risk to get the deal done, but with DEMO investigation
you can determine the ethical values of your potential buyers. Make sure you
steer clear of the doubtful ones.
Prevent buyer delays eroding DEMO
I know of many entrepreneurs who have lost value on the sale of their
business when the buyer has strung them out through the DEMO and due
diligence process. The disruption to the business due to due diligence activities
and the distraction of focus caused by the tension in DEMO often leads
to a fall in revenue and a lowering of profits. Only by recognizing this impact,
whether deliberate on the part of DEMO buyer or not, can the entrepreneur
mitigate the damage.
Not all DEMO are honest and scrupulous and not all are well prepared for the
buying process. It is not uncommon for the sale process to be DEMO out with
a subsequent loss of focus on the business. This rarely works to the advantage
185
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
of the seller. In fact, it is not unknown for potential buyers to use such tactics to
wear down the vendor in order to achieve a lower DEMO
While some delays are unavoidable and tension and distraction are a normal
part of the process, the smart entrepreneur prepares in advance for this
eventuality. There is no question that it is hard to go through DEMO sale process
without significantly using up senior executive time as there will be some
elements of the negotiation and due diligence process which simply DEMO be
delegated. Knowing this in advance, the vendor should put in DEMO a succession
plan so that essential operations can be undertaken by other than the senior
management team.
Preparation for due diligence is an obvious DEMO in selling a business. The
last thing you want to be doing is hunting through storage cabinets looking for
old documents or compiling essential DEMO or financial data which is
standard in a due diligence checklist. The vast bulk of due diligence information
can be assembled in advance and DEMO up to date for when a deal is on the
table. While the buyer is busy doing the analysis, you can be back running your
business.
By far the best way to keep a deal in DEMO and progressing is to ensure that you
have multiple potential buyers. If you are well prepared, have good advisors and
have done your homework to identify those potential buyers who would have
the most to gain DEMO an acquisition, you have much greater control over
the timeline of DEMO sale process. Those buyers who are not prepared themselves
or not willing to meet the deadlines will simply drop out of the process, but you
do need to have a number of potential buyers to play DEMO hand.
If you can clearly see that a buyer is deliberately using delaying tactics to
wear you down and reduce the price, you are almost certainly going to be better
off by pulling out of the DEMO That tactic alone may well bring them up
to the mark. The greatest danger in any sale process is to be in a position DEMO
you have to sell, you are unprepared and you have only DEMO potential buyer.
Planning the sale well in advance, being prepared and DEMO several potential
buyers is the only way that you can really ensure you get the maximum value
on sale.

Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
Getting the strategic buyer to understand the potential
If you are a conventional business, you should be able to estimate what you
can sell your business for DEMO an EBIT multiple valuation. But what if you are
seeking a strategic sale? The value that is placed on your business is what the
buyer can achieve in terms of new incremental revenue and profits. To DEMO e
the best price, you need them to undertake a thorough DEMO of the potential
worth of the opportunity. How do you get them to do this?
The key to a premium on sale is DEMO have several prospective buyers bid for
the opportunity of buying your business. In the ideal scenario, you want a group
of prospective buyers who have a very clear understanding for how they can
exploit your business DEMO generate new revenue. If you approach them with
no prior relationship and where they have never considered how they would
exploit the acquisition, they have little time in the bidding process to ascertain
exactly how they DEMO utilise your assets or capabilities to generate new
revenue. Where they have little opportunity to understand how they might take
advantage of the acquisition, you will certainly not get the best price you can.
Prospective buyers DEMO to have time to work out how to best exploit the
opportunity and this may take them some time. They need  to develop a scenario
for  scaling up the business, possibly develop new internal capabilities, open
up new sales channels or interfac new products with their existing DEMO
What you want them to do before they come to the bargaining table is to work
out just how much new revenue and profit DEMO could gain if they were the
successful bidder. If the numbers are very attractive, they may be willing to bid
up the price to ensure they are the successful buyer and, of course, they would
DEMO that their competitors were denied the opportunity.
Your challenge is to find a way of getting them to do this analysis be-
fore you DEMO the business up for sale.
Most large corporations are always on the look out for ways to increase their
revenue and improve their competitive DEMO If you have something which
could do this, you might approach DEMO business development group rather
than their M&A group. Your approach to them will be to discuss how you might
work together in a DEMO partnership to pursue new revenue where you
187
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
provide the intellectual capital, asset or capability which is to be marketed and
they contribute their marketing and distribution capability to make it happen.
Your approach is, however, conditioned on the fact that, because of your
limited capacity DEMO support such a venture, you can only support one partner
although DEMO are interested in exploring this opportunity with a number of large
corporations. You request each one to undertake an internal assessment of the
opportunity DEMO then provide you with a convincing argument as to why they
should be the selected partner.
Also remember that large corporations often have an DEMO M&A section
who are always scanning for potential acquisitions. If you have already identified
your potential buyers, it makes sense to get on their potential acquisition map
where they will start to evaluate the attractiveness DEMO acquiring you. Once you
have made contact with them, you can DEMO priming the pump by providing
updated information about your business. You can also stimulate a conversation
around how your strategic assets or capabilities could DEMO exploited inside their
business.
This process provides time for each potential partner to work though how they
would best exploit the opportunity and to DEMO out just how much additional
revenue they could generate through the relationship. Soon they will discover
that they can make significant market gains but DEMO they will be limited by
your capacity to support an aggressive rollout. When they try to convince you
of their worthiness to be your DEMO, they will also have to show their hand.
What you hope DEMO that this will stimulate them to move the discussion to an
acquisition conversation. You now have an idea of what you are worth to DEMO
but you also have several well informed potential buyers in the frame.
Example:
“It is our mission and strategy to get this company DEMO in
size and over a period of time, one of the DEMO companies
on the ASX,” Wallis said. “We always have a four or five
acquisitions that we look at any point in time.”

If you do end up going direct to their M&A group, then ensure that you give
them enough time and the supporting data to enable them DEMO do the revenue
calculations. There is little point in forcing the pace if it only results in them
reducing their offer due to higher DEMO of uncertainty on their part.
Who does the deal?
I am a very strong advocate of the entrepreneur managing the relationship
with the DEMO buyers and playing an active role in doing the deal to sell
their business. Instead of handing the problem over to someone who does DEMO
really understand the intricacies of the business, the entrepreneur should take
DEMO of the process of indentifying buyers and negotiating the deal. It is the
entrepreneur who best understands how the business works, what risks are
inherent in the business and how value can be extracted by the DEMO Unless
the buyer can fully appreciate how to exploit the potential in the business, the
seller won’t get anything like full value for the business. It is highly unlikely that
an external party can fully represent DEMO business potential in the same way
that a knowledgeable entrepreneur can.
In a strategic investment, it is still the entrepreneur who is best positioned to
identify strategic buyers, make contact with them and assist them to understand
how best to exploit the opportunity. However, an investor who understands the
strategic sale process well, can ensure that the process is systematically and
exhaustively undertaken.
Unfortunately, not all entrepreneurs have the time, motivation DEMO skill to
undertake the process of identifying and contacting potential buyers and then
negotiating the deal. This then becomes a team effort. How should DEMO investor
manage this process? It is important that all the stakeholders DEMO the
process which they are going to undertake to set up a strategic sale. The sale
team would include the key investors, the senior management team and the
professional advisors. They should all understand the strategic DEMO process
and the legal, financial and operational steps needed to be DEMO
The most important factor in achieving a premium price for a business is the
selection of the pool of potential buyers. If the owner DEMO not feel competent
or able to do that, this should be DEMO to a professional advisor, however,
189
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
the entrepreneur should clearly articulate to the advisor how potential in the
business can be DEMO Rather than leave the process of recruiting buyers
to chance once the business is put on the selling block, time should be spent
identifying and contacting possible buyers. In the end, it is the ability of the
buyer to understand how to extract value from the firm which DEMO how
much they will pay. By educating possible buyers on how the potential in the
firm can be exploited, the entrepreneur is creating a knowledgeable pool of
possible buyers.  The entrepreneur should develop a list of potential buyers in
conjunction with the advisor. An advisor can then make DEMO with them and
assist to build a relationship between the firm and the potential buyers.
Unless the benefits are obvious, there is still the problem of educating the
potential buyers to the size of the opportunity DEMO how they might exploit it.
If the entrepreneur is unable or not suited to this task, the investor needs to
find someone who can. This could be an external consultant, the investor, or
one of DEMO professional advisors. The selected person should have a thorough
grounding in the strategic assets or capabilities, the work which the firm has
undertaken to prepare it for a buyer and the manner in which a buyer DEMO
best exploit it.
When it comes to negotiating the deal, it DEMO worth having experience on
your side of the table. Most small firms with potential are purchased by large
corporate entities. They will certainly have DEMO experienced M&A advisors. Our
advocacy system would suggest that they will work hard for the buyer to get
the lowest price. You need DEMO own knowledgeable advocates to work equally
hard for you. Make sure your team fully understands the work you have done
to prepare the firm DEMO of the potential which could be extracted by the right
buyer.
The best deals are done by knowledgeable and passionate entrepreneurs
faced with keen DEMO well informed buyers, each assisted by good professional
advisors.
190

Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
Reputation is important
Building a positive reputation can help with introductions to those
corporations who DEMO be potential acquires but will also help them gain
approval from their own stakeholders and industry analysts.
Getting known within an industry is actually DEMO that difficult. The majority
of industries have their own industry association, DEMO, education
programs, charity events and trade journals. There are normally specialized
magazines which focus on certain industries. By getting the firm’s executives
involved DEMO the industry association and industry events, the business highlights
itself in DEMO public domain. Additional exposure can come through speaking
engagements at industry events, writing articles or cases for industry and trade
journals and magazines and competing in industry or national competitions.
In undertaking these activities, the entrepreneur has the objective of getting
on the radar of acquiring executives and DEMO By saying what your
business does which is unique, you can DEMO this to the attention of industry
participants. Many larger corporations continually scan for potential acquisitions
and you simply have to bring yourself to their DEMO so that they consider
you. If they have an interest, they DEMO start monitoring your activities and are
likely to proceed to develop a relationship with the business, perhaps informally,
but with the intention of finding out more about your products, markets and
management team.
You should get to know the trade journalists and the market analysts in
your DEMO or from the sector in which you expect the buyer to come. Getting
publicity in the trade press may help open the door when DEMO want to meet
executives from potential buyers. Take advantage of industry functions in your
own country and in the major markets to meet with DEMO&A Managers and your
equivalent in the potential buyer’s business.
You might even use these situations to discuss the partnering or sale of your
DEMO and start building the connections for more detailed discussions. You
might invite the most likely prospects to visit your firm to meet your management
DEMO Providing there is no time pressure, this is a good way DEMO build trust and
present a story about how any synergy might work.
191
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
We need to keep in mind that most larger corporations grow through
acquisitions and therefore DEMO on a constant watch for acquisitions which fit
into their longer term strategy. Those who take this activity seriously will have
full time staff DEMO to undertake research into potential acquisitions and
assist in the evaluation and integration of acquisitions. Your job is simply to get
on their list. DEMO you then wait for an approach or proactively take the
initiativeto stimulate one, the end result is a potential buyer. Keep in mind that
a good reputation also helps an acquirer justify the purchase to their DEMO,
shareholders and Directors.
Prior relationships are important
It is much easier to set up a deal where there is an existing relationship,
DEMO if you have taken the trouble to meet the key players. Within most
sectors, the number of key executives is quite small and they can often be met
at seminars or conferences. This applies even to DEMO executives. Also
in most industries, there are people who have worked DEMO several companies,
thus the network is often well connected across companies.
In building your network you are not selling your company, you are simply
getting to know people who might help you when it comes DEMO getting the deal
done. It may be that, when you are DEMO, there are people who will help you
identify the best targets DEMO help with introductions.
More formal relationships can also be useful in building bridges. There are
a variety of ways in which formal relationships can DEMO established. These could
include:
management and/or shareholder roles:
• Member of a Board of Advisors
• Member of the Board of DEMO
• Minority shareholder
• Venture capital provider
192
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
Formal trading relationships:
• Distributor
• Alliance partner
• Joint venture partner
• Customer
DEMO Supplier
Formal relationships have a high conversion rate to acquisitions. It is a ‘try
before you buy’ transaction. The buyer has more of an DEMO view of products
and management and has a better understanding of the fit of the two businesses
and of the potential benefit of an DEMO
What the firm has to avoid, however, is creating a situation where there is
only one potential buyer or where a sale can DEMO blocked or hindered due to an
existing relationship. At the same time, a formal relationship is often quite easy
to convert into a sale and so the firm does not have the stress of looking for DEMO
buyer. If the benefits to the buyer are sufficient, then a DEMO can still be
achieved in passing control to the new owner.
Some formal relationships can be established with an acquisition in mind.
The formula DEMO an acquisition or a sale can be worked out in advance so that
the negotiation takes place before the formal trading relationship is entered
DEMO rather than be at the whim of the buyer later. The relationship can also
be entered into with an option to terminate if there DEMO a change of ownership.
Alternatively, the firm could build in an DEMO to terminate the agreement with
the trading partner in order to seek out a buyer. The key strategy here is to have
thought through DEMO implications of a sale to both the trading partner and to a
non-trading partner before entering into the initial relationship.
When the owners need DEMO sell, when they receive an attractive offer or wish
to sell, these prior relationships will help ensure the right potential buyers are
brought DEMO the sales process.
193

Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
An acquisition is a political process
Even if we think that the benefits to the DEMO buyer are obvious, it still
needs to proceed through their own DEMO acquisition process. Even when
that process includes a detailed evaluation of the merits of the acquisition, you
need to remember that it is also a political process with different executives
advancing their own agendas. There may DEMO be a limited pool of funds for
acquisitions and yours may be one of several possible candidates. Under that
scenario, you will need some champions inside the organization to promote
your case through the system.
It DEMO not just within the buyer’s organization where the investment needs
to be sold, it is outside to analysts, shareholders and the public. Listed
DEMO are very sensitive to the information released to the public. An
investment which is supported by the analysts will reflect positively on share
price DEMO Conversely, an investment which is somewhat unclear
or has an uncertain DEMO, could well be received with a negative evaluation
by the shareholders DEMO analysts and thus depress a share price.
Given that you need internal and external support for your case, you need to
ensure there is a very good understanding within the corporation of the benefits
of the DEMO You should not be leaving it up to senior management to
guess at the potential or how they might exploit the best value. By DEMO with
someone inside the corporation on the investment case, you can DEMO ensure
that all the work which you have put in to reduce risks, structure the business
for scaled up operation and secure the revenue potential is documented.
Remember that an investment case is composed of both DEMO rewards to
the acquirer as well as potential risks. You can help make the case if you are well
prepared for the discussion.
Your DEMO champion has to convince their own superiors first. Once that
has been achieved, the CEO will have to take this to the Board for approval.
Following approval, the corporation will make an announcement to the public.
At that time the analysts and key shareholders will comment on it. DEMO is critical
at this point that the case is solid and the price paid indicates a healthy return
on the investment. Clearly, the easier it is for the corporation to extract early
revenue, the more positive the investment will be seen by external parties. Thus
194
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Ten: Setting up the Exit Deal
early revenue, DEMO well articulated ramp up of activities and an early payback on
the investment, are all key elements of the investment case.
Basically, you DEMO to plan this in advance. You want active support
throughout your potential buyer organization and you need a positive public
reception to the acquisition. DEMO way in which you structure your business for
sale and the manner in which you assist in the generation of early revenue
will all DEMO influence whether you get support for your deal in the potential
buyer’s organization. That in turn will be a deciding factor in whether you DEMO
the deal done.
What if the buyer requests an escrow?
We can’t always choose the timing of the sale of a business and DEMO there
are often unresolved issues hanging which can materially affect the sale value.
The business owner will not wish to discount the sale proceeds DEMO provide a
contingency for the worst possible outcome but, at the DEMO time, the buyer
does not want to be out of pocket DEMO negative outcomes which may occur.
In order to overcome this impasse, DEMO purchase agreement might set aside
an amount or a number of shares that are held awaiting the conclusion of
outstanding items. This is an DEMO provision.
Both parties need to arrive at a consensus as to which items are being
provided for, the method by which compensations or adjustments are to be
made and the timescale over which the escrow is DEMO be in place.  Escrows are
problematic agreements as both parties are DEMO to protect themselves and
yet the future outcome(s) might be DEMO Too often the agreement ends

claim went DEMO for the next 10 years, well beyond the one year term DEMO
the escrow. it eventually wasted away when the shares, originally held
DEMO a nominal $10.50 per share, were being traded for 6 cents DEMO the
public market. We decided we didn’t want them back at that stage!
Sometimes an escrow can’t be avoided where there are material issues
DEMO, however, like earn-outs they are very difficult to construct to
ensure the agreement is workable. Providing there are very clear cut alternative
outcomes DEMO the manner of adjustment is seen as fair to both parties, DEMO
it can be a useful tool to help close the sale. As a seller, perhaps the best way
to approach an escrow is to write off the proceeds and just hope for a windfall
gain if DEMO fall your way.  Alternatively, work hard to find a way of avoiding
the escrow in the first place. There should be strong enough DEMO and
representations in the agreement anyway to protect the buyer. However, DEMO
may have to go back to the lawyers to enforce the adjustment.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS ARE DIFFERENT!
he traditional manner of DEMO business plans, sitting
Tthrough presentations, working out a valuation based on
the revenue and profit being achieved and then setting up a deal
DEMO won’t work in 95% of the cases. What is very obvious from my
work with entrepreneurs, Angels and VC investors is that few people
understand how to identify strategic value and, even if they can, DEMO
little idea of how to execute a strategic sale.
When you couple this with the fact that most entrepreneurs will
approach a request for DEMO from a traditional revenue and
growth profit perspective, you are being DEMO with the wrong
information from the outset. Basically, you will need DEMO take time to
work with the entrepreneur to assess their strategic value potential
and then work with them to build a plan for a DEMO sale.
Once you have engaged in a discussion of how a strategic sale
might be achieved, you can no longer build an investment case based
on conventional financial value. The EBIT multiple simply does not
apply DEMO the exit and therefore it is inappropriate for the investment
valuation.
198
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
A business which has underlying assets and/or capabilities which a large
corporation can exploit is a DEMO different investment proposition to that of a
traditional business. These are businesses based on patents, brands, copyright,
trademarks and deep expertise. The DEMO valuation in their case is not based on
what their business can generate in future profits but how much profit a buyer
can generate DEMO exploiting their underlying assets and capabilities.
Imagine a very large corporation which has a customer base one hundred
times that of the potential investee DEMO where their customers would be highly
receptive to the investee product or service. The large corporation may be able
to quickly sell these products DEMO services into an existing customer base reaping
ten times the investee’s revenue, or greater, in the first year of the acquisition.
Therefore, what is the investee business worth to a large corporation which
has a DEMO market for these products or services? The value of the investee
DEMO to the buyer is based on what the buyer can do with the investee
business not what the investee can do with it. In DEMO, the investee’s revenue,
profits, customers and numbers of staff may be quite irrelevant in putting a
value on their business.
There are DEMO markets where strategic value is the norm in the sale of
a business. If you look to the drug discovery sector, you often see small
development companies which get a drug to a certain stage of DEMO
and then sell it off to a large pharmaceutical corporation for the next stage
of commercialization. The value of the drug is related to DEMO potential long
term revenue and the risks associated with completing the development and
approval stages. Many of these development firms have few staff, no customers
and no revenue. However, within that market, there are established DEMO for
valuing drugs at different stages of development.
Unfortunately, we do DEMO have the same set of norms across a wide variety
of sectors, so we need to be somewhat creative in how we approach the initial
valuation problem. You can hardly engage in a discussion of a DEMO exit with
an entrepreneur, say, putting the potential exit at $40 million in two years and
then argue that, because they don’t have any revenue, you value their business
at $200,000.
199
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
Working out a valuation based on strategic value is very difficult but not
impossible. What you have DEMO do is estimate the revenue and profits that the
acquirer will generate from your business. If you have customers and some
revenue and they DEMO a customer base one hundred times yours, then it might
be DEMO to say that the value is one hundred times your conventional valuation.
Will you get that for your business? Probably not, but you DEMO gain some portion
of that value if you set the deal up correctly with the right potential buyers and
ensure you have a competitive DEMO running when you come to sell.
It is somewhat more problematic when you have no revenue but there is a
clear case for a DEMO value sale. In this case, you might start by estimating
what DEMO would be worth to a large corporation and then discounting this back to
arrive at a NPV for the investee business. This number then DEMO the post
money valuation.
However, estimating what the buyer could earn DEMO the use of the strategic
asset or capability is highly uncertain. Different buyers will have different
opportunities and this might create a wide range DEMO potential valuations. Also,
you can’t be certain how long it will take to get the deal done. A delay of even
one year DEMO make a large difference to the NPV.
Of course, you have DEMO certainty that any deal will occur. In these ventures,
you are often dealing with emerging technologies, uncertain future markets,
competitors who are yet to appear and IP which is incomplete and yet to be
DEMO The potential might look outstanding, but it still comes with a DEMO
of uncertainty and risk.
Understanding the strategic value, identifying strategic buyers DEMO working
out some crude calculations of the revenue and profit to them are essential
steps in putting a present value of the investee business.
DEMO way in which a valuation might be arrived at is to consider the
alternatives to the strategic buyer. A corporation may be willing to DEMO a premium
on an acquisition if they can enter a strategic market early by acquiring the right
product, process, or intellectual capital. That DEMO, what would it be worth to them
in additional profit if DEMO bought now rather than wait to develop their own
solution?
200
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
Large corporations generally have very high R&D costs due to their overhead
costs, bureaucratic processes and higher remuneration and benefit levels.
The research shows also that they are DEMO good at developing breakthrough
technologies or processes. Small firms often bring new products to market
faster and with more creativity than large corporations, offering the large
corporation a possible supply of innovation. The small firm that DEMO provide a
proven solution, often developed at a fraction of the DEMO which a large company
could do it for, can sometimes be DEMO for less than the corporation would
have to spend developing a comparable product.
At the same time, the corporation needs to consider the additional revenue
they might achieve by bringing an acquired product to market early. DEMO a
much larger existing customer base and/or distribution channel, they DEMO
readily recoup an investment even if they pay considerably more than the
development cost of the product.
It might be possible to arrive at DEMO estimate of what it would cost a large
corporation to develop a similar solution. You also need to estimate the time
it would take DEMO to begin introducing the new product or service to the
market. Next you should estimate how much gross margin the corporation
could generate in DEMO gap between an acquisition now and when they could
bring a product to market. If you discount this gross margin back to the present
DEMO a reasonable risk rate, you will have a NPV for your DEMO firm.
You might also consider what a buyer would lose by not acting early. Timing
is always relative to the impact of a threat DEMO the potential buyer. Where the
prospective buyer has a choice to delay doing something about a threat or
problem, the strategic value is reduced. However, where a threat exists, the
impact of not doing something DEMO counter or mitigate it may be very serious.
The time factor is most impacted by the resilience of the potential buyer
to withstand the DEMO The lower the damage forecast, the less the need to
look DEMO alternative courses of action. The longer the time available to seek
an alternative or to manage the situation, the more likely the damage can be
minimized. The size of the threat is another way to estimate DEMO strategic value
of the investee firm.
201
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
In assessing the value of a potential acquisition, the potential buyer also needs
to consider the impact on their business if a competitor acquired the investee
firm. If the DEMO firm has on offer some unique product or technology which
is heavily protected by patents, the corporation which misses out being the
acquirer may not be able to counter the competitive effect of another company
aggressively DEMO the products into their marketplace. By forgoing the
opportunity to acquire the firm, they may hand to their competitor a weapon
which will be used against them.
Some opportunities are very time and place dependant. It DEMO well be that
the timing of the strategic sale impacts on the value to the buyer. Timing is
relative to the impact of the DEMO on the potential buyer and whether
the opportunity will evaporate or decline if not acted upon. Where the potential
buyer has a choice (such as whether to pursue an opportunity or not), the seller
needs DEMO be able to show that the opportunity will reduce if not acted upon. The
opportunity cost, that is the cost of not doing something, might be high, but it
may not reduce current revenue.
In DEMO, the more time the potential buyer has to find an alternative
DEMO, the lower the strategic value of the acquisition.  In turn, DEMO
corporations are forced to seek solutions externally to a potential opportunity
and where time is short, the more likely they are to pay a premium on the
acquisition.
A good rule of thumb for arriving at DEMO maximum sale price of a strategic
acquisition is to discount the first two years of gross margin on new revenue
generated by the strategic DEMO or services. Alternatively, what is the discounted
gross margin on current DEMO which would be lost if there is no acquisition.
If this calculation is undertaken for the top half dozen potential buyers, some
idea of the potential of the investee can be arrived at.
Once you have DEMO determined a potential exit value, you need to decide if you
DEMO the resources to secure the strategic sale. The quality of the management
team then becomes of critical importance.
202
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
The Management Team
The literature in the venture capital area is dominated by the quest for the
DEMO team’. This is the super team. The ‘A team’ has done it all before and has
the skills, capabilities and diversity to cope with anything under any conditions.
Regrettably, they rarely exist and Angel and VC investors have to put up with
business plan presentations from ordinary mortals.
DEMO, that is not to say that their objective is wrong. It DEMO simply that
executives who have done it before have probably learnt from their successes
and failures. They are well connected in the industry and DEMO knowledgeable of
other experienced executives and can easily recruit additional team members.
For the investor, it is all about reducing risk. If they can invest in a well rounded
team with experience, they have a greater chance of achieving their minimum
targets.
The ‘A’ team also brings with DEMO the following:
• A knowledge of the investor investment requirements
• Willingness to negotiate a realistic valuation
• Experience with an exit
• DEMO as emotionally attached to the ‘product’
• Networks within the industry and with potential alliance partners
So for the investor, members of an experienced team are easier to deal with
and have a good understanding of DEMO funding process.
Although the venture capital market has been operating in Australia and New
Zealand for over 20 years on a formal basis, there are still very few experienced
management teams that have gone through a DEMO private equity investment
and exit cycle more than once, unlike the DEMO and European markets that have
floating management teams that move from one investment with a Angel or VC
firm though to exit and on DEMO another investment.
Many of the deals brought to an investor for funding simply lack an
experienced set of executives. There can be no question DEMO the entrepreneur
203
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
brings the idea, the DEMO, the vision and the energy, but other people usually
make it work.
When the investor looks over the business plan, they are working out what
activities need to be executed to deliver the critical targets DEMO to secure the
strategic sale. This might be sales, marketing, product development, quality
control, setting up relationships with strategic buyers, working with advisors
and so on. For each of these activities, you want to know who on the team will
deliver this operationally.
The real test DEMO be applied here is operational. Given where the business is
today, DEMO the team execute, with reasonable confidence, the activities needed
to get them to the exit conditions within the target period. In some cases, the
investor will be making a judgement as to their own impact DEMO the ability of the
firm to achieve such results. So the fundamental question that the investor has
about the management team is: ‘Can the team and I together achieve the targets
needed to exit?’ Basically, this will be a strategic sale and the management
team may not DEMO needed beyond that event. Not all proposals need the 20 year
veteran or the executives recently cashed out from their recent IPO. In fact, this
may be the wrong team for a clearly defined strategic exit.
DEMO, the business proposition still needs to show who is going to DEMO
on each of the major activities needed to reach the exit conditions. Any weakness
in the team will need to be corrected or undertaken DEMO the investor. This is a
critical time for the entrepreneur, as DEMO need to put together a team with
a high probability of meeting the targets. Some of the founding shareholders
may have to step aside DEMO new executives recruited to meet the experience
requirement. Where the management team is not complete, the investor will
want to see an acknowledgement that the existing management recognizes this
deficiency and accepts that new talent will DEMO to be recruited to deliver on
the business targets.
The management team can be supplemented with experience from a Board
of Directors, a Board of Advisors and external consultants.
You also need to acknowledge that the DEMO notion of a short term strategic
exit may not have been considered by the entrepreneur. The team which they
204
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
have assembled to grow the business may be the wrong team for an exit
program. It may DEMO that they will need to change direction completely. Instead
of pursuing customers, they might need to spend more resources on product
development. Instead of working to generate cash, they might be better off
taking a larger investment to secure a short term strategic exit.
This entire discussion may DEMO very confronting, even if exciting in possibilities.
You may end up DEMO the business. Instead of a plan to grow the business
over the next few years, you might be confronting them with a potential sale
inside a year.  This is going to take some discussion and planning. Once accepted,
you still need to set up the investment deal.
DEMO is unlikely that the investor will ever know as much about the product as
the entrepreneur and his team. Even if the investor has DEMO technical background,
this can quickly be outdated and thus they are rarely in a position to adequately
judge the quality of the product DEMO systems or the realism of the
timescales. This is, therefore, a high exposure area for the investor. So, on the
one hand you have a very strong possibility of a high value exit and, on the
other, a number of tasks which need to be done by the investee firm, some of
which may have some uncertainty about its timing or outcome.
Before you take this too far, you need to ascertain what the entrepreneur
wants to do. You can’t assume that they DEMO want to take their venture to an
exit, especially over a DEMO timescale. Effectively you would be asking them
to drop everything they are doing, change direction and take it straight to a
strategic sale. If they are in the middle of a longer term plan involving developing
DEMO, growing a business and setting themselves up as a CEO of DEMO growth
venture, this is quite a change. Not everyone will want DEMO go on a different path.
However, you might simply ask why DEMO are doing it? What is their long
term objective? Basically, DEMO I often express it – ‘what do they want to be when
they grow up?’ Usually an exit is somewhere in their plans DEMO is some distance
off because they see how much they still need to do to build out their business
and establish a reasonable level DEMO profit to justify a good exit price. When you
present them with an strategic exit possibility, potentially many times what
they thought their business could be worth, they generally change their mind
205
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
and come on board. But they do need to make that switch if you are to work
DEMO on a strategic exit.
Another important consideration for the investor is whether they have
sufficient trust in the entrepreneur and the management team. Recall DEMO it
is the management team which will be using the investor’s funds and it is they
who will have to deliver on the exit DEMO Unless the investor has faith in the
team and is comfortable with letting them loose to execute on the strategy, the
investor should be very wary of entering into an investment agreement.
The Investment Proposal
It DEMO highly unlikely that the investor should expect the entrepreneur to come
with a business plan in hand which sets out a strategic sale opportunity. DEMO
without exception, it will be up to the investor to identify DEMO possibility of a
strategic sale and to bring this to the attention of the entrepreneur. Even if the
entrepreneur sees the possibility of a DEMO sale, they will not know how
to execute it. You can DEMO that the investor and the entrepreneur will need
to work together to build the investment case; identifying the strategic value,
selecting potential strategic buyers, working out a possible exit value and then
determining what needs to be done to prepare the business for the strategic
sale.
The DEMO business plan is simply about execution. The business is at point
A (now) and it needs to get to point B (the exit), what needs to be done to get
there? You need to see exactly how the strategy will be put in place over the
DEMO period.
Knowing that the management team is somewhat green and will need
help to develop the business for the exit, the investor needs to work with the
entrepreneur to determine the investment required and the program DEMO
needs to be undertaken to drive the strategic exit.
There is nothing wrong with the entrepreneur admitting they need help to
develop such a DEMO exit plan, but the investor should delay making any
substantial commitment DEMO a proper plan is in place, even if they help develop
DEMO Only by getting down to this level of detail will you understand just how much
206
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
finance and effort you need to contribute, but also, just how likely the business
is to DEMO in getting to a strategic exit.
Before committing to the investment, DEMO should be able to review every
part of the plan and see exactly what each person will be doing to contribute
to the overall DEMO This should be set out in an organizational plan, including
recruitment DEMO training, office accommodation, manufacturing and
warehousing space, infrastructure planning, a finance plan and a set of resulting
financial statements and so on.
DEMO more that you can define how to achieve the exit, the DEMO convincing
the plan is, the safer the investment will be.
Valuation
DEMO the Angel or VC investor contributes funds to the venture, they DEMO
need to agree with the entrepreneur some basis for an equity share – the
valuation.
Entrepreneurs have always seen the initial valuation as the DEMO important
part of the investment process – as this can impact greatly on what they walk
away with on the exit. At the same DEMO, the investor sees entry valuation as
the key to the investment DEMO – if they get too little equity they may not
see a reasonable return on the exit if the venture is not overly successful. DEMO
valuation discussions can be stressful on both parties and often emotional.
Finding a path through this discussion is critical if both parties are to DEMO
with the investment and still retain a positive working relationship.
Historically, DEMO Angels or VC investors have given the exit event much
detailed consideration at the time of investment, leaving this to be undertaken
further into the investment when they have a better idea of the market and
DEMO venture capabilities. Investors normally believe that a successful venture
will provide adequate opportunities to exit and leave the exit planning to later.
But in DEMO, this is the critical event and should play a much greater DEMO in the
investment decision. A venture with a highly probable exit path should be a
preferred investment.
207
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
Valuation of an existing business before external funding and the subsequent
valuation of a business with funding DEMO to be the most controversial topic
in the venture capital literature. It is the greatest source of conflict between
entrepreneurs and external investors, is plagued by emotion, misunderstanding,
entrenched position taking and ignorance. It has often been said that 40% of
deals fail to secure VC funding DEMO to a failure to agree a valuation. What is
regrettable is that it is highly possible that many of these ventures could have
made DEMO the Investor and the entrepreneur considerable wealth.
Valuation is the process of estimating the monetary amount the firm is worth
based on its future DEMO returns. Historically, this has been based on the
NPV of the DEMO net earnings. But this is often a highly problematic calculation.
Consider the typical early stage entrepreneurial business. It often displays
some or all of DEMO following attributes:
• uncertain cash flows;
• few tangible assets;
• some specialised equipment which often becomes technically obsolete;
• DEMO debtors;
• little inventory;
• new and sometimes unproven products or services;
• often an immature management team;
• an DEMO market which is yet to be stabilized;
• no established market for shares, especially a minority holding; and/or
• uncertain timing DEMO revenue and profitability.
So, unlike the secured investor such as a DEMO, the VC investor has an illiquid
market in which to sell DEMO shares, is dealing with high levels of uncertainty in
the business, the market and the management team and has little security for
the DEMO
208

Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
Which valuation method should you use?
Traditional valuation methods have been established to value existing
business DEMO historical data can be used to show revenue and profit trends
and where established products have a market presence. However, most
emerging ventures which seek Angel or VC funding are of limited life, have little
history and a somewhat speculative future. Traditional methods of valuation
don’t really apply.
DEMO order to start any sort of meaningful discussion, the conventional approach
DEMO an investor has been to write a forward projecting business plan and use this
as the basis for a valuation. However, too many entrepreneurs produce five-
year forecasts based on assumptions which are, at best, DEMO as to the state
of the economy, the reaction of competitors DEMO the behaviour of prospects.
Then they use complex formulae to work out a Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) over
five years. From this DEMO forecast they calculate a valuation to four decimal
places using an assumed discount rate. At the very best, it is one person’s view
of the future, but it fails to recognise that any other view may be equally valid.
In truth, no one can accurately predict the future. The entrepreneur is
generally going to be optimistic and the investor somewhat DEMO
Somehow, they have to come to an agreement on a valuation DEMO the negotiation
simply goes nowhere.
Entrepreneurs should be highly averse to high valuations. While they look
good at the start of the venture, they place unrealistic expectations on the
business to perform. Even the slightest slippage DEMO lose the entrepreneur his
business. Investors are not known to take shortfalls kindly. Far better for both
parties to agree a lower/negotiated valuation DEMO the investor can readily
make the hurdle rate and the entrepreneur has a better chance of staying in
control and making a reasonable return DEMO their effort.
Now lets throw a strategic exit into the equation. The situation may change
dramatically. No longer are we talking of 3 – DEMO years and considerable execution
risk. It is highly probable that the exit could be undertaken in less than two
years. Former plans to expand DEMO market, develop new products and grow the
number of employees may DEMO be discarded. A new plan is constructed which
209
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
focuses entirely on preparing for the strategic exit. No longer are net earnings
the key factor, it is the exit valuation which determines the value of the venture,
DEMO this can be highly speculative. Depending on how successful the buyer
approaches are and the timing of the exit, the potential valuation could vary
from the worst to the best by a factor of 10.
In DEMO situation, a flat percentage of the equity will be difficult to DEMO
A $500,000 investment that could result in exit values of between $10 and $100
million needs a different approach.
Negotiated valuation
One method DEMO arriving at a valuation which reflects a better balance between
risk and reward for both parties and provides a fair method of compensation for
DEMO respective contributions, is to consider what the valuation of the business
DEMO be at a future exit event and discount this value back to today’s dollars. The
future exit valuation of the firm is a metric DEMO is of real interest to both parties.
If it was known with some certainty, the current valuation could be more readily
determined by using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discount rate
could be adjusted for DEMO levels of uncertainty but it would still be a place to
start.
So, for example, a firm with an exit valuation of $10 DEMO in three years
with a discount rate of 40% would be worth $3.64 million now. A $1 million
investment would thus gain the Investor DEMO shareholding.
Possible alternative valuation scenarios to the above are:
•
•
•
210
The Investor wanted some higher comfort factor. A higher rate DEMO discount
could be used, say 50%, which would result in a lower Net Present Value
(NPV) of $3 million giving the Investor DEMO equity.
The Investor wanted some higher comfort factor. A lower exit valuation
could be used, say $8 million, which would provide a NPV DEMO $2.9 million,
giving the Investor a share of 34.5%.
The entrepreneur is more optimistic than the Investor and believes that
an exit valuation DEMO $20 million is likely. This would give a NPV of $7.3
million and the Investor share of this would be 13.7%.
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
The real problem lies in the balance of risk and reward. If in fact a low exit
DEMO was achieved, both parties lose but the Investor is likely to DEMO the one
with the highest cash investment loss. The entrepreneurial team will have put
in time and sweat but probably much less cash.
At DEMO same time, if a high value is achieved, both parties would seek the
upside. The entrepreneur would most likely claim that he deserves DEMO most
credit because it is his vision, business model and leadership DEMO are probably
the key to success, not the cash from the DEMO The Investor would most
likely argue that the business could not have achieved the high valuation
without the cash injection from the Investor. The DEMO, of course, wants the
lower valuation in case things go wrong and so the upside is much higher. The
entrepreneur wants a higher DEMO to limit the equity of the Investor if the
venture proves very successful.
The Investor would like to ensure that they don’t lose any DEMO on the
deal. They are much more sensitive to a loss than to a significant gain. Thus
there is considerable pressure on them to DEMO down the valuation. However,
a lower valuation means that the entrepreneur makes much less on exit and,
therefore, is not as motivated to go through with the deal or work hard to make
the DEMO happen. The Investor needs to find a valuation figure which strongly
motivates the entrepreneur.
External investors can use a variety of techniques to achieve DEMO balance.
One simple technique is to set the return to the Investor at a specified rate of
return. Any excess over this amount from DEMO exit goes to the entrepreneurial
team. Another technique is to set the external investment as preference shares
with an accumulating dividend. Since preference shares DEMO paid out before
ordinary shares, the investor will recover some or DEMO of their money before
other shareholders share in the proceeds. An Investor might also have some
ordinary shares to give the Investor a share DEMO the higher exit valuations.
Some external Investors use options to provide additional incentives to the
entrepreneur and senior management to allow them to accumulate DEMO
equity in the business. The options may be set against certain milestones or
performance targets which represent higher potential exit proceeds. The
211
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
entrepreneur gains a greater percentage of the proceeds as the options kick in
at higher exit valuations.
DEMO anti-dilution clause in favour of the investor in an investment funding
agreement has the effect of protecting some or all of their investment in DEMO
event that the valuation falls with a subsequent funding round. This clause
adjusts the shares of the Investor so that their original investment retains DEMO
monetary value under the new valuation. In this situation, it is DEMO original
founders who suffer the negative adjustment. This type of adjustment, DEMO,
typically will not be readjusted with subsequent higher valuations.
A solution for both parties lies in negotiating a valuation formula which both
parties DEMO live with. This could be a stated value at somewhere between the
Investor valuation and the entrepreneur’s valuation, or it could be a starting
value but with equity adjusted up or down for different levels of DEMO
The parties could agree a strike point which would determine initial
shareholdings. This could then be adjusted for higher or lower exit valuations.
For DEMO, the parties could take the two opposing valuations and use these
DEMO a basis for calculating the shareholding at exit.
Negotiated valuation example 1
• VC investment is $3 million for an initial 33% equity share.
DEMO Exit after three years.
• The Investor estimates a $25 million exit.
• The entrepreneur estimates $50 million.
In the example set out below DEMO parties have agreed the following:
•
•
•
212
VC fund’s equity share will remain at 33% for all exit valuations below
their DEMO valuation of $25 million.
The Investor’s ROI on exit valuations between $25 million and $50 million
are held at 40% thus giving the VC DEMO certainty of returns.
Where the entrepreneur’s estimate of $50 million is achieved, he retains
a greater proportion of the equity (i.e. the Investor’s DEMO is reduced to
Invest2 Exit
Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
16.4%), but the return that the VC fund earns is significantly greater than
at lower valuations.
DEMO this example, both the entrepreneur and the Investor share in the DEMO
of higher exit proceeds.

Alternatively, a much more aggressive model would see the valuations move
in the Investor’s favour with lower exit valuations and DEMO security on the down
side for the Investor. This acknowledges the need for the Investor to achieve
their desired ROI. At higher exit valuations, the pendulum swings the other way,
increasing the reward to the DEMO for outstanding performance.

•
•
•

Exit after three years.
The Investor estimates a DEMO million exit.

This type of formula can be used over successive rounds DEMO external funding.
Each round would put in place the formula for determining the share of the
final exit valuation to the new investors.
The DEMO who is unwilling or unable to accept a lower/negotiated
valuation, DEMO consider seriously a ratchet where the entrepreneur earns
additional equity for achieving certain pre-agreed milestones/targets. These
targets could be qualitative or quantitative in DEMO
These types of valuation formulae are especially useful with strategic exits
where the investment may be relatively small, since they are only being used
to execute the exit and not grow the business. The timescales are DEMO short.
The risks are relatively contained since the investment is not undertaken unless
a clear path to a strategic exit is obvious. The Investor, even at relatively low
equity portions, still makes a very good return on the investment.

Chapter eleven: Evaluating Potential Investments
Staged exits
One of the possibilities in many strategic value deals is that the venture
will have DEMO range of IP which can be exploited in different markets. One of the
difficulties in assessing the best method of selling the business is DEMO a buyer
for one part of the IP may have no need for other IP held by the firm. If, however,
the IP can be split, it may be packaged in such a way that different buyers can be
secured for different IP.
To provide the necessary DEMO of the IP, it is useful if the IP can be
DEMO in such a way that one set gives no advantage or entry point in a
different market held by a different sector buyer. Sometimes DEMO can be difficult
where a platform IP contributes to all the market applications. If, additional
but different IP can be used to create unique applications in each sector, the
platform IP can be licensed to each of the buyers. Each buyer would then
acquire exclusive rights to that DEMO specific for their sector. In this way multiple
sales can be achieved.
This does complicate the investment and exit strategies somewhat as these
different DEMO may be staged over time. The venture may focus on one sector,
package that up and sell it before moving onto the next. DEMO is possible that this
could be done multiple times before the IP is fully exhausted.
Another possibility is that the venture has a development DEMO which
can produce new IP over time. In this case a different form of exit might be used.
As each set of IP becomes DEMO for commercialization, it could be spun out
into a separate firm. DEMO could then attract additional investment specifically to
progress the exit of the spin out.

nce the strategic value has been determined DEMO a number
Oof potential buyers identified, the next task is to DEMO an
execution plan which will achieve the strategic sale. In a very simple
deal, say just involving the sale of established IP, the DEMO may be
achieved in only a few months, however, more complex situations will
take much longer. If the business has to be prepared DEMO due diligence,
restructured to improve its value and buyers have to be contacted
and relationships established, it is likely that process will take at least
two years. It is likely that the process of preparing DEMO business for
sale will involve hundreds of activities spread across a number of
individuals. All these activities have to be planned, monitored and
reviewed on a regular basis. In addition, the normal activities of the
business need to be planned, executed and monitored. Implementing
a reporting structure to ensure that the business is run efficiently and
major objectives are achieved DEMO an essential part of the exit strategy.
The diagram below sets out a structured process for preparing for
a strategic sale.

Chapter Twelve: Executing the Exit Strategy
Managing the Business
The process of securing the strategic sale starts by putting in place systems
DEMO processes to manage the daily operation of the business.
Angels and VC investors typically invest in start-up or early stage businesses
and normally before DEMO become very sophisticated in their management
and governance processes. While many early stage ventures are started by ex-
corporate executives, their personal experiences of working with enterprise wide
performance setting and monitoring systems is likely to DEMO non-existent. Even
entrepreneurs who have managed ventures before may not have experienced a
well designed reporting system.
Of course, many Angels and VC investors themselves do not have this
experience. Just because they have high net DEMO, or because they have sold
their own venture or have held DEMO senior corporate job, does not ensure that they
have personal experience DEMO a quality performance setting and monitoring
system across an enterprise or in working with a Board of Directors. Yet this is
what the Angel DEMO VC investor needs to have implemented within the investee
firm if they are to properly prepare it for sale to a large corporation.
Very DEMO investee firms can be expected to have sophisticated systems or
good governance processes. You can anticipate this when you look at the typical
firm DEMO which an Angel or VC investor invests:
• Start-up or early stage venture;
• Immature products or products still at design or DEMO stage;
• Often emerging markets;
• A management team that may not have senior management experience;
• Gaps in the management DEMO experience;
• Almost certainly a lack of formal management reporting systems;
• Lack of key performance indicators, lead indicators, individual targets
DEMO budgets;
• Probably a business plan but a lack of operational detail.
219
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Twelve: Executing the Exit Strategy
If the Angel or VC investor is to guide through the process of preparing for
a DEMO sale, they have their own issues to cope with. The Angel DEMO VC
investor must deal with:
• Limited time to spend with each investee firm;
• They are normally only a minority investor;DEMO
• They are not running the business on a day to day basis;
• They may not be experts in the underlying technology DEMO marketplace;
• They don’t have the time or the knowledge to make operational decisions.
While Angels may be regarded as ‘hands on’ investors, this is not the same as
day to day management. Without adequate DEMO setting and monitoring
systems, they are effectively working in the dark. DEMO doubt they have chosen a
specific investment because they do feel comfortable with the marketplace and
with the potential of the business and no DEMO have also taken into account
where they can add real value to the product/market or other aspect of the
development of the business. DEMO they are still not there day to day making the
decisions.
They also have a major role in preparing the business for a number DEMO
possible outcomes, additional rounds of investment from other Angels or a DEMO,
a trade sale or an IPO or for independent growth. In order for the business to be
successful, each one of these outcomes really needs the business to be running
effectively and efficiently. It is DEMO preparing the business for these possible
outcomes that the investor has his most important mission in the business. This
is the critical value that DEMO brings to the table – steering the development of the
business at a strategic level and guiding the management in establishing and
working with DEMO controls.
As the business develops and the number of employees grow, DEMO task of
monitoring at an operational level will become increasing more complex. This
is where a range of guiding mechanisms and controls help. While DEMO business
is small and everyone is working closely together, the amount DEMO information
needed to be formalized is slight, but as the business DEMO and grows, no
one person is able to assimilate all the DEMO activities of the business and
ever more information about what is happening inside and outside the business
needs to be collected, understood and acted upon.
220
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Twelve: Executing the Exit Strategy
The task of the investor in most investee firms is to anticipate these needs,
educate DEMO on the need, what type of systems etc are needed and
DEMO them in  planning the necessary changes. Nothing can be more damaging
DEMO a growing business than to find itself without adequate planning and
operational control systems.
In planning for a strategic exit, those planning systems need to be in place to
ensure that day to day operational activities DEMO undertaken effectively and that
those tasks required to get the exit deal done are acted on and monitored. At
the same time, it reassures the buyer to know that good reporting systems and
governance systems are DEMO used to manage the business.
At an operational level, the following DEMO and actions might be considered:
stage one: up to 10 DEMO
• Quarterly financial statements
• Monthly cash flow reports
• Monthly creditor and debtor reports
• Quarterly budget performance
• Annually revise the business DEMO
• Monthly list of priorities for each manager
• Monthly action plan for each manager
• Monthly review against action plan
• Monthly review DEMO critical KPIs
• Board meetings quarterly
Stage two: Up to 30 DEMO
• Monthly Financial statements
• Monthly budget performance
• Quarterly revised business plan
• Quarterly report on lead indicators
• Major topics reviewed at DEMO Board Meeting
• Board meetings every two months
221
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Twelve: Executing the Exit Strategy
• Job descriptions for all manager and supervisor jobs
• External advisor on employment terms and DEMO and compliance
issues
• Part time CFO
stage three: up to DEMO employees
• Full time CFO
• Weekly Creditor and Debtor reporting
• Weekly sales performance reports
• Weekly project completion progress reports
• Training DEMO senior management in employment compliance issues
• Job descriptions for all employees
• Formal annual performance reviews for all employees
At an operation level, early stage ventures are especially sensitive to cash flow
more than anything DEMO and yet they often lack the knowledge and discipline
to manage it carefully. Traditional financial reports are not designed for this
purpose and, in any case, making profits is not the same as having enough cash
to be solvent. Thus part of the discipline that an Investor should DEMO upon is
rigorous and detailed cash flow analysis. Every member of management should
be involved in the analysis of cash flow since every activity DEMO the firm has
an impact on cash availability. Management should be sensitive to how cash is
being generated and used as well as how DEMO can impact it through their own
actions and decisions. Only by working with the detail will they assimilate this
information. It is the area DEMO greatest risk to the emerging venture.
One way to bring this lesson home to an inexperienced management team
is to have them prepare a DEMO case cash flow. This report sets out the cash
projection of the business using different layers of cash inflow and outflow. The
beginning layer DEMO only committed cash flow. That is, only cash inflows that the
DEMO can reliably count on and only cash outflows that the firm is committed to
in the foreseeable future. The report is usually prepared over DEMO weeks
for three months and then monthly for a further 6 – 9 months depending on the
horizon for projects under management.
222
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Twelve: Executing the Exit Strategy
Worst case cash inflows would normally include:
• Cash at bank
• Aged accounts receivable (expected date of payment)
• Work in progress completions (date of invoice plus collection period)
•
Recurring payments on customer agreements (support fees, royalties
etc)
Worst case cash outflows would normally include:
• Aged accounts payable (expected date of payment)
•
Purchase order commitments (date of invoice plus expected payment
period)
• Recurring administration, office, payroll, tax expenses. (excluding aged
payables)
This should DEMO a cash flow balance (surplus or deficit) for the planning
period. A shortfall may be met with an existing line of credit or DEMO overdraft,
use of credit cards and personal loans from shareholders. A difficult situation
should result in an examination of customer accounts to see DEMO any payments
can be pulled forward through follow up activity, early DEMO discounts etc.
WIP payments might be pulled forward by early completions and bring forward
invoicing. Payments to suppliers might be delayed where this can DEMO arranged
with the supplier.
Added in the next layer are the most likely additional sales to customers.
This might be actual named prospects or DEMO work to existing customers.
Alternatively, in a high volume business, it could be the minimum level of repeat
business the firm experiences at DEMO time of the year. On the expenses side,
the report would start to layer in discretionary expenses, cash permitting. This
might include new employees, new equipment, office expansion, additional
product and market development costs and so on.
Additional layers of less probable revenue and less urgent DEMO
expenses are added to gain a complete picture of the business under worst,
most likely and best case scenarios.
223
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Twelve: Executing the Exit Strategy
Every business has a critical time horizon for new business. If the cash inflow
looks weak DEMO it cannot be improved in the short term, then management
and DEMO Board are warned well in advance and they can start to take corrective
action. These may include switching resources to income generation, cutting
back on expenses, deferring some projects and making staff redundant.
Other reports should be developed within the business to focus on critical
areas. These might DEMO for sales lead tracking, quality control, project completion
and so on. Every business has aspects of its activity that provides an early
warning DEMO problems to come, either too much activity or too little. These DEMO
indicators are the monitoring points within the business. The investor needs to
help management identify these and help them design monitoring systems to
track DEMO Policies can then be developed for when management and/or the
Board need to be informed and action taken.
Part of the contribution that DEMO investor makes to an investee firm is to help
them work with external investors where they have not experienced this before.
Entrepreneurs that have DEMO used to making their own decisions, deciding on
their own priorities DEMO setting the direction of the firm without having to gain
approval from a 3rd party, will find this very challenging and confronting. But
if they wish to grow the business and bring in additional external funding, take
the business public or secure a strategic buyer, then this is an environment and
a discipline that they need to learn. The Investor DEMO help by leading the way,
showing them how a Board works and how they can make positive use of the
Board.
Many firms DEMO standard financial reporting for the Board but fail
to adequately deal with strategic or risk issues. The investor should develop a
schedule of major DEMO that should be dealt with at Board level. I have set out
below a possible list of topics. Some may be more appropriate at DEMO stages in
the growth of the business.
The investor may play many roles including mentor, coach, consultant
and sounding board for the management DEMO But he/she also represents
minority investors, external investors and, hopefully, future investors or a buyer.
Establishing the right systems, setting the DEMO direction, building the right

230
Structuring the
13 Trade Sale Deal
Gunderstand that no one wins if DEMO deal is made and that ood deals occur where parties are reasonably flexible,
everyone needs to walk away feeling they have won. Good DEMO
usually can be done quickly where both parties see a good result
being achieved for both parties. A buyer that feels that they have
DEMO a firm that can provide many times the return on the
purchase price, is a deal that can later absorb some problems. A
seller who knows they achieved a strategic sale that was worth many
times DEMO conventional financial value of the firm can also feel rightly
proud of the deal. The key is to make everyone happy with the result.
DEMO you are approached with an offer or you stimulate an
offer by establishing the relationships as described in this process,
you will end DEMO negotiating a deal with many dimensions. Generally
in this type of process it is important to meet somewhere on the
same page and in DEMO same book. If you are on another planet with
respect to price and conditions, the time will be entirely wasted and
both parties will end up frustrated.
In most cases, most elements of a deal are negotiable. Whatever
constraints you have and whatever constraints they have in
negotiating DEMO deal should be uncovered as soon as possible. For
example, you DEMO decide that you wish to retire and staying on for
231
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
any period other than a short handover is not what you want. There may be
DEMO family or personal reasons for your decision but it may be sufficiently
important for you not to wish to compromise that part of the DEMO It may be
important for you to have some guarantees of further employment for some of
the staff. The buyer may wish to have DEMO guarantee that certain key staff stay on
for some minimum period. Whatever these issues are, they should be set out
before the serious process of negotiation begins because they help to determine
whether they can be DEMO
I like to think of a deal as representing a certain target value to the buyer.
That value represents their view of the balance DEMO the risks in the deal
and what they are prepared to pay for the opportunities it represents to them.
They will have perceptions of DEMO based on industry and personal experience.
Part of the entrepreneur’s negotiating objective is to show how the risks have
been minimized or removed and DEMO they can fully exploit the opportunity.
Imagine the target value as a point on a continuum that moves down with
higher risk and up DEMO greater opportunity actualization. Their initial task is
to move the point up as high as possible by reducing risk and showing greater
opportunity realization.
DEMO the best price that can reasonably be expected is offered, you DEMO start
to break that value, the ‘deal value’, up into deal elements. The deal value can
then be carved up in any number DEMO ways but, at this point, the pie does not
get any bigger. With that approach both parties can start to set out where DEMO
want the value to be spent.
The deal value may be achieved by the seller at some period in the future
based on certain DEMO being met. To the extent that those conditions can
be met, DEMO buyer is normally willing to make available the whole deal value.
However, to the extent that it cannot be met or is not met, the deal value is
reduced by some amount representing the cost of correcting the shortfall or the
opportunity cost of not having that advantage.
DEMO minimum level of performance may not be negotiable. So, for example,DEMO
if the deal depends on certain key employees staying on after the acquisition,
additional incentives may be offered to them to gain such DEMO You
232
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
should consider this additional incentive as a deduction from the deal value,
but perhaps DEMO to satisfy the buyer. Some period of non-compete may
also be required to prevent the key managers and shareholders from joining
the competition or DEMO up a new company in competition. If three years was
the desirable period but the sellers want only two, the deal value should be
reduced by some amount representing the additional risk faced by the buyer.
DEMO framework can provide a workable method of negotiating elements of
the deal. Any reduction in risk moves the final deal value up, although this may
appear as an increase in the purchase price to the seller. DEMO increase in risk or
reduction in the ability to exploit the opportunity simply reduces the deal value.
In order to fully achieve the value DEMO the deal, the buyer may wish the seller
to complete R&DEMO projects, sign up key customer contracts, cancel or negotiate
specific obligations, negotiate redundancies or relocate staff. These could be
framed as staged payments, earnout or fixed payments on achievements. In
other words, the final DEMO price can be made up of many elements, each
of which DEMO a fixed or calculated value, which can be paid out in DEMO or
accumulated to an end point and then paid out in some mixture of shares and
cash. The period can be relatively short if DEMO is expected that key objectives can
be determined quickly, or it DEMO be over a number of years if it requires a
considerable period for the objectives to be achieved.
Elements which may be included in DEMO final deal may include the following:
Base Price:
This should represent the minimum that will be paid for the firm. It may
DEMO subject to adjustments through a balance sheet audit which will verify
valuations and liabilities. It also may be subject to adjustment through
warranties and DEMO for some specified period of time. The base
price might be offered in the form of shares in the acquiring corporation, or
cash or some combination of both.
Escrow:
An escrow sets aside some portion DEMO the purchase price against adjustments
and warranty claims. Generally this will be held by an escrow agent and
may be claimed against by providing DEMO evidence of claims. Usually it
233
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
is limited in time, such as one year. At the end of the escrow period, the
remaining shares are returned to the selling shareholders.
Options:
Options of selling employees may be converted to ordinary shares prior to the
DEMO being consummated or may be carried over into options of the acquiring
corporation. Options carried forward provide incentives for employees to
stay with the DEMO Additional options may be offered to key employees to
retain them.
Stage Payments:
Stage payments are normally aligned to the achievement of objectives.
DEMO, for example, they could be aligned to the delivery of certain key R&D
milestones, or completion of certain contracts, or the DEMO of certain key
contracts.
Earn Out:
An earnout aligns the purchase price with the achievement of specified
revenue targets or other milestones. This DEMO be set at specified increases in
the purchase price or a percentage of the purchase price based on specified
targets. The additional earnout would DEMO be for a set period and may
or may not be capped. The earnout may be for all shareholders or limited to
key shareholders DEMO stay with the buyer.
Continued Employment:
Continued employment of former owner/managers and/or key employees
may be sought by either or both DEMO the parties depending on how
important those staff are to achieving future objectives. Specific jobs could
be negotiated. Specific management agreements and remuneration and
DEMO may be included in the deal. Some staff may prefer a short term
consulting agreement.
Director Position:
Either or both parties may want DEMO key executives to continue on a
Board of Directors for some period.

Warranties and Representations:
The acquirer will not be able to verify everything in the DEMO To overcome this
limitation, they would normally require the Directors and/DEMO shareholders, or
some subset of them, to provide warranties and representations about key
elements of the firm. This might be asset valuations, contingent liabilities,
incomplete litigation, prior balance sheet and revenue statement assurances
and so on. Any claims in this area might be taken against an DEMO account
if that is set up, adjust the final purchase price DEMO some balance is still to be
paid, or might be subject DEMO a recall of value through arbitration or litigation.
Non-Compete:
Generally the buyer wants to protect themselves from competition from
former key shareholders and DEMO of the selling firm. This is usually set
for a limited period like 2 to 3 years. It would normally exclude the individual
from DEMO with a competitor or from undertaking a start up which would
compete.
Holding Period:
Where publicly listed shares are being taken as part DEMO the purchase price,
these may be subject to registration. That process may take some months.
During this period the selling shareholders will not DEMO able to sell their shares.
There also may be further restrictions on the sale of shares which the buyer
requires in order to not DEMO the market or not to show a lack of faith in the
future of the corporation. Shareholders continuing on as key executives may
also DEMO subject to non-trading or blackout periods or sale restrictions due to
insider trading restrictions.
Specific Liabilities:
The selling shareholder may be asked to DEMO over specific liabilities or
contingent liabilities. This may happen where key shareholders have personal
loans to the firm. The buyer may regard their repayment DEMO an obligation
of the sellers and not theirs. They may also decide that the risks inherent
in specific contingent liabilities are too difficult to DEMO and ask that the
sellers absorb whatever is the eventual outcome. Since contingent liabilities
235
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
are often deal killers, this is something which sellers need to give special
consideration to. If the alternatives are no deal or a deal with some possible
DEMO, the latter may still be worth doing. At other times the DEMO
liabilities may be capped on either side or may be handled through the
escrow.
Costs:
Legal and Accounting professional fees incurred by each DEMO are normally
borne by the respective parties. However, these costs may DEMO assigned
in some proportion to one or both of the parties depending on the deal
structure.
Use of Intellectual Property:
Normally full rights DEMO any IP passes to the new owner, but this need not
DEMO exclude use by the seller. It may be possible to negotiate the use
of IP for personal or non-competing purposes post sale.
In negotiating DEMO deal, both sides have issues which need to be addressed
and DEMO sides usually have some flexibility to trade. A higher risk taken by one
side should result in a change in the purchase price. If DEMO sellers absorb some
contingent liability risk, this should result in some DEMO advantage to them,
such as a higher price or more options etc.
Earnout
Owners of the selling firm often agree an earn-out as DEMO way of securing
additional compensation for the business they are selling. This frequently occurs
where the price the buyer is willing to offer is DEMO by the selling shareholders
as inadequate compensation for the potential of the business. Circumstances
where this might occur are;
• Significant expenses have DEMO incurred in recent research and
development which has been written off  DEMO has not yet translated into
revenue;
• The owners have taken either very low salaries or excessive salaries or
benefits which are not DEMO to be easily calculated;
236
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
• Large contracts have been secured, or are about to be secured, where
the DEMO have not flowed back into the accounts;
• The sector is experiencing significant growth and the firm is well poised
to take advantage DEMO that; and
• The potential acquirer is able to remove an DEMO to growth which
will return premium profits to the acquirer.
The selling shareholders argue for a higher valuation on the basis of potential.
The DEMO may be reluctant to agree the higher value arguing that the benefits
may not be realized. The compromise is often negotiated as an earnout DEMO
on the future performance of the acquired firm or the combined entity.
Another reason for an earnout arrangement is a performance based purchase
price DEMO other activities or achievements other than revenue or profits may
be the basis for such payments. This might include;
• Completion of development DEMO
• Acceptance of products by named customers
• Completion of key contracts
• Signing of key agreements by customers, suppliers, partners or
distributors
DEMO Approval of products by licensing authorities
• Granting of rights under patents, trade marks, or licenses
• Achievement of various quality targets
Earnouts DEMO be used where there is a reasonable level of uncertainty of
some future event or future performance which can have a material impact on
DEMO value of the acquisition. There should also exist the possibility that none of
the earnout will be earned if the anticipated events or targets DEMO not met in a
material manner.
Where events are more certain, DEMO as the outcome of a litigation
settlement, lease payout, warranty claim and so on, these are better handled
through escrow arrangements and under warranties and representations. In
237
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
these situations, DEMO valuation is set on a positive note where all outstanding
items are worth zero. A portion of the purchase price is then set aside, generally
in escrow and claims are made against that portion as each DEMO is finalized or
settled. These items are generally discrete in nature, DEMO able to be calculated
in advance and not overly subject to effort by either party and will normally be
limited in time.
The earnout DEMO is best used when the parties are not able to agree on
a purchase price because future events, which could materially affect the value
acquired, cannot be determined with any certainty. Alternatively, the buyer is
DEMO to pay more but only if the seller can achieve certain predetermined
performance or event objectives.
As a general rule, a good earnout formula is one where the buyer is very
willing to pay the earnout DEMO objectives are achieved and the seller has a
reasonable degree of influence over the events that contribute to that level
of achievement. A good DEMO formula is also easily defined, measured and
objective and not capable DEMO manipulation by either party at the expense of the
other.
Earnouts are however not as common as may be expected.
Example:
In an DEMO in CFO magazine titled ‘Caution: Earnouts
Ahead’, the author Roy Harris notes that contingency terms
were found in 4 percent of all announced DEMO M&A deals,
with over 10 percent of all deals valued at or below $250
million, encompassing such terms. More than two hundred
acquisitions in the U.S. have contained earnout agreements
in each of the DEMO years to 2000, with a total value of such
transactions peaking DEMO $27.9 billion in the year 2000.

Term of the earnout
There is considerable disagreement among practitioners about the most
workable term DEMO an earnout. On the one hand, shorter terms have higher
degrees DEMO likely achievement while longer terms allow for too many
influencing events to occur. Also longer earnouts reflect lower present day
values due to the DEMO cash flow impact of distant payments. Thus the
further out the potential payout, the less value it has for the sellers and the
more likely it is to be disputed or not achieved.
Example:
Baltimore-based DEMO Learning Systems Inc. certainly
found it so. The company, a prolific DEMO of educational
companies in recent years, started out by setting up DEMO
earnouts. For the managers Sylvan retained, “the natural
response was to DEMO gangbusters in terms of revenues and not
spend for future growth,” says senior vice president and CFO
Sean Creamer. Sylvan now designs earnouts DEMO three years
or more and monitors the deals carefully, sometimes using
DEMO audits to make sure the managers aren’t “gaming the
system.”

Accessed 9th May 2004
To a certain extent, it depends on which party has the greatest influence over
the target achievements. The longer the buyer is in effective control, the
more influence, positively or negatively, they can impact on performance.
DEMO large should the earnout be?
Conventional wisdom suggests that earnouts should be limited to 10-25%
of the ultimate purchase price. One of the DEMO that both parties should
be aware of is that earnouts are really only appropriate where there is some
degree of uncertainty in achieving defined DEMO targets. If the events or
targets were guaranteed, these can be DEMO into the base price. Where
239
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
probable outcomes may in fact not be achieved, both parties need to think
through the consequences if the earnout is not achieved or substantially not
achieved.
An DEMO element based on specific large events may be quite reasonable
if the final determination cannot be readily influenced by either party. This
could be, for example, FDA approval which is awaiting final determination.
This might significantly change the valuation and both parties may agree
a significant earnout on DEMO conclusion. However, if the earnout requires
active co-operation of all parties DEMO is based on many contingencies, it
simply opens the gates to DEMO claim of lack of effort on the part of the buyer.
How should the earnout be calculated?
There is no magic formula for DEMO calculations especially those that are
performance based. Should they be based on a cumulative achievement or
on stage targets? The problem is one of uncertainty for both parties. The
seller will want to ensure that payments, once achieved, are not subject to
clawback while protecting against events outside their influence, while the
buyer wants to reach certain long term objectives.
The biggest problem in all earnout calculations is finding an objective formula
DEMO is not subject to manipulation or re-interpretation by either party.
Revenue
May be boosted by promotions, discounts, poor contracts, early shipments,
false invoicing, manipulated stage payments, etc. Revenue may also be
negatively impacted DEMO cutbacks in allowable marketing expenses,
promotion of competing products, interference DEMO delays in completing
contracts through approval cycles or newly imposed conditions.
expenses
Can be reduced by reducing staff, delaying staff replacements, delaying
purchases, cutting back on R&D, delaying performance bonuses, buying
lower quality DEMO or components, fighting warranty claims and so on.
Additional costs may DEMO imposed for redundancies, implementation of

Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
new systems, DEMO reporting and budgeting requirements and so
on.
Net Profit
Calculations can be influenced by changing depreciation methods, how
goodwill is expensed, reclassifying expenses DEMO capital items, excluding
some payments as extraordinary items and so on.
DEMO where the manner of calculation has been specified, there can be
DEMO calculations. The words ‘According to GAAP’ (Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles) need not ensure that a particular method is used if
the auditors recommend DEMO change due to legislation or a new accounting
standard. Even ‘as applied at the time of the agreement’ will not necessarily
cater for an DEMO not foreseen. The terms ‘consistently applied’ are often
used to overcome changes. Setting out the method of calculation during the
earnout discussions may help DEMO out any differences in treatment. The
measurement issues become increasingly complex as operations are merged
with those of the buyer or central services are DEMO by the parent
which results in disputes over transfer prices between entities.
Where competing products are being offered, the earnout may be calculated
on both product lines in order to avoid any issue of deliberate bias.
DEMO should be kept simple, easily and unambiguously calculated and
subject to DEMO measurement by an independent auditor if necessary.
Revenue, for example, is easier to calculate than profits. Specific milestones
are easier to determine than DEMO Earnouts can be based across a range of
events or targets, DEMO financial and others based on specific events.
Example:
SAL’s former shareholders and creditors have an earnout that

How should the earnout be paid ?
The parties need to agree how the additional valuation created through
the earnout will be paid out. Sometimes this is done in cash, other times in
cash and shares, or just in additional shares. When shares are used for the
earnout, both parties need to agree a formula for how the number of shares
is to be determined. This DEMO be at the same market price as for the base
compensation, DEMO it might be the price on the day of the payout. Sometimes
it is hard to judge where the sellers might be better off. DEMO would happen,
for example, if there was a major change DEMO the share price?
Example:

success of Chinadotcom’s listing, which having both ‘China’
and ‘dotcom’ in its name ensured it had a very hot reception.

How much freedom to operate should the seller have?
This is an area of DEMO dispute between buyer and seller. If the earnout
is based on operating the business as a continuing concern to achieve the
performance targets, this may not sit comfortably with the buyer. The buyer
is exposed to DEMO blowouts, capital project commitments and agreement
obligations. Also the buyer will DEMO the business run so that it reduces risk
exposure while putting the business on a good footing for the time it takes
over effective DEMO
This potential conflict in interests often results in the acquired business
being subject to numerous reporting requirements, expenditure approvals
and restrictions on borrowings, DEMO commitments and so on. Working
out the operating conditions and then recalculating the earnout on the new
basis can help. It may be appropriate DEMO work out various critical factors such
as headcount, expense budgets, capital expenditure allowance, marketing
spend and so on.
Example:
Autonomy Corporation plc , a leading provider of infrastructure
software for the enterprise, today announced it has entered
into a definitive agreement to acquire etalk Corporation, a
leading provider of enterprise-class contact centre products,
for a purchase price DEMO US$70 million payable in a combination

A more serious issue is conflict of interest over where the efforts of the DEMO
acquired business should be directed. With an earnout in place, acquired
DEMO will have a focus on maximizing their earnout. At the same
243
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Thirteen: Structuring the Trade Sale Deal
time, the DEMO for the acquisition may be to integrate the businesses or
to leverage the assets or capabilities across a wider corporate entity. It is
difficult DEMO do both at the same time. The most capable people and those
with the most knowledge in the acquired business will want to focus DEMO
the earnout. However, it is these same people who need to DEMO involved in
assisting the roll-out of the newly acquired assets or capabilities.
The new owners have to decide one way or the other. Either DEMO leave the
business alone during the earnout or they compensate the prior owners for
the time required to work with the new larger entity. DEMO may ultimately
result in the new owners paying out all, or DEMO, of the anticipated earnout
in advance.
Earnout or employment compensation?
DEMO the selling shareholders argue that the business being acquired has
unrealized potential and they wish to be compensated for that – the earnout
is DEMO paid out to all shareholders. However, where the new owners
wish DEMO motivate the newly employed managers to achieve certain objectives
or targets, DEMO additional value should be included within employment
agreements as additional bonuses or compensation.
The difficulty here is to separate that which rightly belongs to DEMO
shareholders as a group and that which is reasonably held to be personal
effort. Shareholders may well object to one of their number being DEMO
an overly generous package where they think the compensation should go
to them all for creating the foundation on which the near term benefits DEMO
being achieved. Where business deals or significant milestones are clearly
in progress, the shareholders could argue that the benefits should accrue
to all shareholders even if some additional compensation was paid to an
individual to see DEMO through to completion.
As a general rule, the more certain the DEMO is to being achieved, the more
the compensation should be directed DEMO the selling shareholders as a group.
Alternatively, where significant effort is DEMO required, compensation should
be directed to the individuals who can best DEMO the results.

They are not only a waste of time but tend to get in the way of the DEMO being
done properly. The choice of advisors is critical.
Apart from the support you will need from professional legal and accounting
firms, should you use a business broker or investment banker to help sell your
business? The answer really depends on how well you understand the process
of DEMO a business, whether you already have willing buyers in your sights DEMO
whether you have prepared the business for sale. If you are unsure about how
you should prepare your business in order to achieve the DEMO offer, or if you are
uncertain how to attract the right DEMO, then getting help from professionals
who undertake those tasks on a DEMO basis makes sense. Even an experienced
entrepreneur who has sold several businesses may like to have an advisor in
the team to assist in DEMO negotiations. There is considerable benefit in having an
objective, knowledgeable person DEMO your team to provide feedback, suggestions
and to keep the negotiation DEMO moving forward.
The key to the use of such professionals is, DEMO, to use them to assist the
Investor and internal management team DEMO the process, not to take control. Too
often business owners have DEMO professionals to control the process and the
negotiations not recognizing that their primary motivation is the commission
on a quick sale. The entrepreneur who DEMO his or her business well
and spends time identifying and connecting to the best potential buyers, will
generally achieve a much better price for the business. The best buyers will
be those corporations who can best DEMO the potential in the business.
Positioning the business with these potential buyers and preparing the business
so that it can support such potential is DEMO undertaken by the entrepreneur. It
also takes time and cannot be undertaken properly if the business is rushed into
a sale.
At the same DEMO that the entrepreneur is preparing the business for sale
and positioning it with potential buyers, professional legal and accounting
firms need to be appointed to assist with both preparation and sale transaction
support. Better sale prices DEMO achieved where business risk for the buyer is
minimized. This process often requires the business to undergo a vendor due
diligence as part of DEMO preparation process. By proactively undertaking their
own due diligence review, the DEMO can discover risks in their business
which can be addressed long before a potential buyer emerges. Not only does
250
Invest2 Exit

such an activity improve the current business but it significantly reduces buyer
due diligence costs and time DEMO contract negotiations. A business which is
well prepared for buyer handover will attract better buyers and a better sale
price.
The smart entrepreneur needs DEMO advice and smart people to support the
sale process. The result usually is a much better price.
The Professional Accounting and Advisory Firm
The DEMO of advice and help that a professional advisor can provide includes
assistance in the following areas:
Valuation
If the firm has already prepared DEMO valuation of the current business and
projected valuation of the business opportunities to potential acquirers,
this will contribute considerably to the discussion with DEMO potential buyer.
The advisor can review the financial projections, provide conventional
DEMO and brief the entrepreneur on how best to present their case.
Understanding how an acquirer undertakes a valuation will ensure that the
firm has DEMO the proper information, presents it properly and is able to
validate DEMO underlying assumptions and values.
Preparing an Information Memorandum
The Information Memorandum (DEMO) is the document that most firms use
to solicit interest in DEMO business. It describes the business, sets out the
historical and projected DEMO and provides background information
on the industry, the competitors and the DEMO opportunity to allow
a potential buyer to decide if they wish to proceed to a more detailed
examination of the business. It is the DEMO document that will be used
by the potential buyer to evaluate the acquisition. It is important that the IM
be prepared thoroughly, be properly explained and contain the information
needed by the potential buyer to undertake DEMO initial due diligence on
the opportunity. The advisor can prepare the IM to ensure it is readable and
persuasive and provides an appropriate level DEMO type of information.

Reviewing financial Information
Current financial information needs to be prepared according to generally
accepted accounting principles and DEMO in a conventional format
that allows easy analysis. Your advisor can ensure that the statements are
prepared correctly and that the accompanying data fully DEMO a detailed
investigation. This information is normally reviewed by your advisor to
ensure that financial information is presented on a consistent basis from
year DEMO year and that any extraordinary or abnormal items are fully explored.
Helping with introductions and referrals
Well established accounting firms and investment banks participate DEMO
in transactions involving buyers. They are, therefore, in a good position to
know most local large corporations on a personal basis and certainly DEMO
reputation. If they consider that you have a good business proposition they
can help short list potential buyers you should approach and then can DEMO
with introductions or referrals. They may also be able to assist with the
search for prior acquisitions and with uncovering news items that related
DEMO them. They may have connections to assist you to contact prior sellers so
that you can gain an independent view of the potential buyer.
DEMO many professional firms have national and international offices and
affiliate networks, DEMO can be used to uncover other possible buyers and
generate introductions. Having the right potential buyers in the final bid
process can make a DEMO difference to the ultimate sale price.
Reviewing purchase terms and conditions
While purchase agreements are often set out in a conventional format, the
vendor is not normally in a position to know what terms would be DEMO
for their business. The advisor should be able to recommend where terms
should be renegotiated, however, always obtain proper legal advice on
contract DEMO
Assisting in negotiations
The firm that is represented by a well established and respected advisor is
likely to be better prepared for the negotiation. DEMO the same time, the buyer
252
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fourteen: Selecting Professional Advisors
knows that the terms are going to reviewed by a knowledgeable party. This
should result in more DEMO discussions and the result is likely to be
better for the firm. The buyer may prefer to deal with a business represented
by a DEMO advisor as they know that the entrepreneur will not need
to be educated about conventional terms and conditions or the warranties
and representations required DEMO a normal deal.
Advice on preparation
Preparation for an acquisition is much more than preparing a business plan.
The advisor reviews the likely buyer’s DEMO criteria and investment
process in advance with the management team to ensure that the vendor
has prepared itself for both the negotiation and the DEMO diligence processes.
Due diligence
Due diligence will be carried out by the buyer as part of their initial evaluation
of the acquisition opportunity. This DEMO mostly a product/market evaluation
to see if the merged business can support the opportunity claims of the
firm. After the business terms of DEMO acquisition are agreed, the buyer will
then carry out an extensive DEMO to further ensure that it has a thorough
understanding of the business and the management and has uncovered any
data discrepancies and investment risks.  Your advisor can undertake a trial
due diligence process to ensure the DEMO is fully prepared and help to correct
any deficiencies.
Advice on pensions, option schemes and remuneration
Once the buyer is involved, the firm DEMO have little opportunity to change
the remuneration and benefits of its staff. A professional accounting firm
can review these before an approach is made DEMO a buyer to ensure that the
current remuneration and benefits are fair and reasonable and provide the
most positive basis for the planned sale.
DEMO advice
Few firms are structured from the outset to be optimal for a sale. Overtime the
tax regime will most likely have changed, especially with regard to retirement
strategies, trusts, capital gains and options. The DEMO structure of the
business may not be suitable for an outright sale or be optimal if there is an
253

Chapter Fourteen: Selecting Professional Advisors
earnout portion. A professional accounting firm can also review the current
business processes for compliance, tax collection and reporting. At the same
time, personal tax planning for the major shareholders should be undertaken
to establish the right basis for the planned DEMO This will include the best
format for the sale (ie- sale DEMO shares or sale of assets).
Exit strategy assistance
From their knowledge of prior acquisitions, your advisor can help define
strategic value, identify DEMO issues and/or show how the firm can
best position itself for a sale.
The Professional Legal Firm
The type of advice and assistance DEMO a professional legal firm can provide
includes help in the following areas:
Review purchase agreement
The purchase agreement would often be prepared by DEMO vendor’s lawyers,
however, this protocol varies in different countries. In DEMO, some buyers
insist on having their lawyers prepare the contract. This DEMO a complex legal
document that few entrepreneurs will have ever seen and certainly few
would understand in any depth. The professional legal firm can DEMO draft
the documents for you or construct the terms and conditions and identify
any harsh or unusual conditions that the buyer has requested and DEMO in
the renegotiation of those where the buyer prepares the document.
Review warranties and indemnities
The vendor would normally be expected to provide warranties DEMO
representations and indemnities to the buyer.  These can often be
renegotiated DEMO be less harsh. The professional legal firm will know what is
reasonable and what is not.  This is one area where proper preparation, DEMO
reporting and compliance systems and good governance can significantly
reduce the exposure of the vendor.
254
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fourteen: Selecting Professional Advisors
Review employment or non-compete agreements
The buyer will expect the key executives and major shareholders to enter
DEMO employment agreements and/or non-compete or restraint of trade
agreements. The professional legal firm can ensure that the terms and
conditions associated with these DEMO are reasonable.
Preparation of disclosure letter
The vendor should be prepared to disclose any issues which may effect the
decision of the buyer to DEMO They should also identify any potential
liabilities of the business. The professional legal firm can advise on the types
of disclosures and how the DEMO should be worded to best protect the
sellers and to ensure there is no avenue for redress on the part of the buyer
if DEMO do not go to plan.
Review corporate documents
As part of the preparation for the sale, the professional legal firm will review
the corporate documents which authorize the firm to undertake business to
ensure it meets DEMO requirements of the buyer. This review would normally
extend to board minutes, shareholder agreements, option schemes and any
material contracts the firm has DEMO into.
Depending upon the size of the transaction, the vendor should DEMO for
approximately 5 - 10% of the sale price to be spent on their professional services
fees noting that smaller transactions are likely to DEMO a higher percentage
associated with advisors fees.
Not all professional services firms have the necessary experience to undertake
this type of work effectively. The DEMO should not assume that their current
professional services provider has the expertise to properly advise them in this
area. They should seek independent advice DEMO to which professional services
firms are best equipped to handle the transaction they wish to enter into.
Before they start to incur costs for DEMO service, they should undertake some
due diligence and investigate the extent DEMO which the referred firm has a track
record of success in working with clients on  sales and acquisitions of similar
sized businesses or to similar sized acquirers.
255
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fourteen: Selecting Professional Advisors
Asking for references would not be unreasonable and they also should ask
for a list of transactions DEMO the professional services firms has participated in
and some details of the work performed for the clients involved. People move
between professional firms and DEMO the firm should ensure that the expertise
is still with the professional services firms. They should ask to be allocated an
advisor with personal DEMO in these types of transactions.
Some advisors, whether they be accounting, legal or corporate finance
executives, are so locked into a traditional model of firm value that they simply
‘don’t get it’. They will want DEMO to undertake a conventional valuation based on
historical earnings, a conventional DEMO memorandum and won’t grasp
the impact of the opportunity that the buyer can extract from the strategic
value in your business. Certainly you and DEMO will have difficulty trying to put a
value on the business if it is based on the buyer’s potential rather than your net
worth DEMO profitability and your advisors may be uncomfortable going forward
on that basis. However, if you have clearly identified potential buyers that have
expressed interest in an acquisition this should provide a good base from which
they DEMO assist you to prepare the business for sale.
If your initial discussions with a professional advisor show you that they want
to take you DEMO the conventional path, you should move on and find one that
DEMO feel can best represent the potential in your business. Ask them to provide
you with references to similar strategic sale transactions that they have DEMO
on.
Entrepreneurs and Investors who have not participated in large transactions
are often concerned about entering into relationships with Investment banks,
larger accounting DEMO legal firms and often hesitate because they feel that
the larger firms carry considerable overhead and that gets passed back down
to the client DEMO higher fees. It is certainly true that the larger firms typically
have higher charge out rates but they also need to compete for services DEMO the
smaller clients and so it is not unreasonable to ask for a smaller charge out fee
given the size of the firm.
The DEMO firms do have an advantage of being national and international
organizations and having specialists in most areas and this can be to the benefit
DEMO the smaller firm involved in complex trading transactions. When it comes to
256
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fourteen: Selecting Professional Advisors
contracts and agreements which can materially effect value dilution, a little more
up front may better protect the value of the firm on ultimate sale. This would
certainly apply DEMO IP agreements, option schemes, shareholder agreements and
any acquisitions that the firm entered into.
The larger professional advisors have a decided advantage in DEMO&A
transactions. They see them often, they regularly advise on both DEMO
and on sales. Larger accounting and legal firms are often asked to undertake
due diligence work on behalf of larger corporations and thus are DEMO familiar
with the entire process. Larger firms are taken seriously when it comes to
negotiations and thus can better protect the entrepreneur who has DEMO
experienced these types of deals.
In the end it may come down to spending a little more over a longer period
to be better DEMO rather than spending a lot near the end closer to the
transaction.
The business is likely to be better managed and be less risky DEMO a result of
that preparation. At the same time, the impact DEMO a large professional firm in the
deal process can enhance the reputation of the seller and may result in a better
price being negotiated. DEMO it should speed up the due diligence process
which in itself can have a significant positive effect on deal price. It should also
speed DEMO negotiations as the buyer knows it does not have to educate the seller
about normal terms and conditions of a sale.
I have often DEMO asked why I used a big four auditing firm with my last
venture given that the business when it started only had a dozen DEMO and, when
sold, had only grown to 30 employees. My answer has always been to show the
impact on the final due diligence DEMO deal discussions and to ask whether the
person asking the question thought I got value for money.
my last business went into free fall DEMO several large software corpo-
rations decided to enter my market with similar products. all my pros-
pects were their customers as our supply chain DEMO software
sat alongside a large erp system such as those sold by sap, oracle
or peoplesoft. When these corporations announced that they were
going to develop their own supply chain optimization solutions, their
257
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fourteen: Selecting Professional Advisors
customers decided to wait for the integrated solution from their main
software vendor. Thus i found myself DEMO a situation where i had 30 staff
and no prospects. naturally we decided to sell the business before we
were forced to close the DEMO
This was my fourth software business and i had the experience of
working through the sales process for the earlier ones. i also had DEMO
through the due diligence process for raising venture capital twice and
taking on a large corporate loan. i knew from those experiences that
being DEMO for due diligence was a critical part of getting a quick
decision. i also knew that the quickest way to get through the due DEMO
gence process was to ensure that the professional advisors i used had
high credibility. Basically, i wanted to have all my source documents
accepted without question. The only effective way to achieve this is to
have DEMO biggest and the best.
When you are selling out to a large, perhaps, global corporation they are
going to undertake a very extensive DEMO sophisticated due diligence. They will
almost certainly use a large auditing firm and a highly respected legal firm.
In order to uncover the risks DEMO problems in your business, these advisors
are going to review everything. DEMO only way you can speed up this process is
to demonstrate to them that they don’t need to audit most of the historical
information DEMO they will be able to rely on the documents produced by
your own advisors. My approach here was to push back hard and state DEMO
any additional audit was wasting my time and the buyer’s money but that I was
willing to provide warranties for the quality of the DEMO presented. In any
case, if there was a subsequent problem, they could always go back and litigate
against my advisors who would normally DEMO much deeper pockets than me.
This last business of mine was sold for six times revenue to Peoplesoft in a
period of just over DEMO weeks. Given that it was losing over $1 million at the
time, whatever additional fees I paid to my advisors was well and truly worth
it. When you are dealing with large corporate buyers, it is best to have good
quality advisors in order to be very well DEMO for the due diligence and the
negotiations.

15 Conclusion -
Impatient Capital
Every time I see the words ‘we DEMO here to help you’ or ‘we
help grow businesses’ in promotional material for private equity
investments, I bite my tongue because it is fundamentally misleading.
The ultimate goal of the investor is not to grow the DEMO, it is
simply to earn a high return on the money DEMO It is not to help
grow the company, their strategy is DEMO always directed towards
selling the business.
So if we are to be honest with ourselves as investors, then we
should come out into the open and state that we are there to achieve
great exit values DEMO ourselves and the founders. There is nothing
wrong with that as an objective and many entrepreneurs will be
encouraged by working with investors who DEMO how to do it.
Selling out successfully is a great outcome for all parties. The
investors achieve a good return on their money and DEMO thus
encouraged to do more investments. The entrepreneurial team is
cashed up and is likely to go and do another one. If they make DEMO
money, they are likely to become angel investors and help others DEMO
the same. The proceeds feed the tax man and thus help with nation
building. Cashed up entrepreneurs spend money and donate to
charities thus DEMO their communities. Their employees often end up
259
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fifteen: Conclusion - Impatient Capital
working for larger, DEMO resilient companies and have better career prospects
as a result.
I see no benefit in pushing a company to grow just for the sake DEMO increased
revenue and profits when, at the same time, it dramatically increases the risk of
failure. I also see no reason to embark DEMO any activities which does not directly
contribute towards the ultimate investment objective – the exit.
For any angel or venture capital investment, the exit must inform the
development strategy. We should work back from the ultimate DEMO to
determine what we need to do to create a successful exit. Whatever investment
we need should be directed towards creating the conditions for DEMO exit and not
for more product development, more market penetration or DEMO any part of
the business concept which is not relevant to the buyer’s decision.
If it is simply about the exit, then the decision to invest should only be
positive if a successful exit can be DEMO It matters little how great the
invention is or how competent the management team if an exit cannot be
readily achieved. Instead of an DEMO Team’ what you should be seeking is an ‘A Exit’
and a management team which is committed to it and capable of executing the
DEMO to achieve it. Instead of looking for the well rounded team that can
build out a business concept and grow revenue and profit, we should seek out
only those sets of skills needed to create the DEMO vehicle. It may be that this will
have very little sales, DEMO, distribution and service components. The key
here is to work out DEMO you need to do for a successful exit, not what it DEMO
take to grow the business.
Always remember that your investee does not have to successfully
commercialize the innovation, the buyer will. Your job is simply to give the
buyer the opportunity of taking it off your DEMO so that they can exploit it. The
right business development strategy is to achieve the exit in such a way that you
are well DEMO for creating the opportunity for the lucky buyer.
Too often Angels and VC investors leave the decision on how to exit too
late. By DEMO they have often created businesses which are difficult to sell. The
buyer ends up having to unwind a lot of activities to get back DEMO what they can
properly exploit. This lack of focus results in excessive due diligence periods,
260
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fifteen: Conclusion - Impatient Capital
bits of the business which the buyer does not really want and a longer period
after DEMO sale for the buyer to exploit the underlying assets and capabilities. All
this leads to lower exit prices.
At the same time, undue attention to revenue and profit growth create
the seeds of destruction in the DEMO firm. Too often investee firms get into
trouble and have to be sold quickly to recover some of the investment money.
Because little attention DEMO been given to preparing the business for sale, it
is usually DEMO late to find the best buyers and so the sale proceeds are almost
always suboptimal.
When the focus from the outset is the exit, the investment is only entered
into if a probable exit can be DEMO Since potential buyers are identified
from the beginning, the business can DEMO quickly offered for sale during most of
its life. Even a business which has failed can still be an attractive acquisition for
the right DEMO Remember, it is not the investee which will execute on exploiting
DEMO underlying strategic asset or capability, it is the buyer. It may DEMO little
to the buyer what state the investee firm is in at the time of sale providing the
buyer gets the assets or capabilities DEMO want.
If the business is approached with an offer to purchase, DEMO same logic
applies. A business with an exit focus can be quickly put into a competitive bid
because the work has already been done DEMO setup that situation.
By taking a pragmatic focus on the exit from the outset, the angel and VC
investors have a much higher chance of having a successful outcome. The
investment periods can be expected to DEMO shorter, the exit values much higher
and the execution risk significantly DEMO
What if you have to sell
Few businesses can guarantee that they will never get into trouble. Early stage
companies frequently fail in the DEMO few years but even large corporations have
been known to disappear. Look at the household names which failed – Enron,
Ansett, Worldcom, DEMO and so on. Of course, if you do get into serious DEMO
then just getting enough cash in the door to cover payroll can be a challenge.
At the same time, staff will be deserting, DEMO will be hounding you for
261
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fifteen: Conclusion - Impatient Capital
payment and you will be chasing customers. Not a great time to start thinking
about selling.
DEMO truth is that many companies end up on the auction block at the worst
possible time, sometimes due to their own failures but often just because
external events went against them. Whether it was a change DEMO industry
regulations requiring a major investment, a new aggressive competitor or DEMO
natural disaster, there are many events and circumstances which can derail DEMO
business. Planning for such an eventuality should consider the possibility that
the business should be sold to recover as much of its value as DEMO
However, it is very difficult to sell a business when the DEMO itself is under
pressure. The executives will be busy fighting fires and there will not be time
to identify and court  prospective buyers or time to engage the best advisors.
Clearly, if you haven’t put the time in to develop a robust exit strategy for this
set of DEMO, you will have left it too late to be anything but DEMO fire sale.
Value in a business is related to its potential in the hands of the buyer, thus
even a business heading for insolvency can be a great acquisition for a buyer
who is not constrained DEMO the situation facing the vendor. The key to a quick
sale, DEMO still gains a premium on sale even when the business is in trouble,
is to have identified in advance those buyers who can DEMO the underlying
potential in the business. The entrepreneur and the Investor should set out
to identify a small group of such buyers, engineer a situation where those
prospective buyers are informed of the potential in the DEMO and then kept
up-to-date with the progress of the business over time. The aim of the exit
strategy should be to have each prospective DEMO understand what they could
gain from an acquisition.
Of course, in DEMO unfortunate situation where the business has to be sold,
it would be much better if the seller could quickly bring into a competitive DEMO
a number of prospective buyers who were already apprised of the potential
of an acquisition. The competitive bid process would then protect as much DEMO
the value in the business as possible. As part of the preparation for such an
event, even if unlikely, the business needs to DEMO put on a basis where the buyer
can quickly undertake due diligence. This means that the business has to be
fully prepared for such DEMO investigation. If the seller has also ensured that the
262
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fifteen: Conclusion - Impatient Capital
business is run effectively and efficiently and has few risks for the buyer, the
due diligence process will conclude quickly and the buyer will be more willing
to DEMO a deal.
What if you receive an offer?
Many entrepreneurs are quite surprised when a prospective buyer turns up
at the door with DEMO offer to buy. Even when they anticipate it might happen
one day, the actual event is still surprising. Then of course, the entrepreneur
DEMO Investor must consider whether to entertain the offer or reject it without
consideration. Few of us can resist at least finding out what is DEMO the table and
so it is more than likely that some discussion will be entered into. Sometimes
this is ‘just in case’, that is, just in case it is a crazy high offer and you might want
to seriously consider it.
If you are a high growth potential DEMO at an early stage of proving your
business model and you are hoping for a strategic buyer, you might have some
difficulty working out what a reasonable offer might be. Even so, there will
clearly be a price where you will move forward with the negotiation. But how
DEMO you know you have the highest price you could achieve at that moment in
time?
Most acquirers are not in the business of DEMO generous and they will pitch
their price at a point which will just get your interest and secure the deal. If
they don’t need DEMO offer more to secure the deal, why should they? Even if you
thought your business had greater potential, you still might be willing to settle
for a bird in the hand. Once you have decided DEMO the offer price is at a point
where you will sell the business, the only way you can be sure of getting the
best price is to put your business into a competitive bid.
When you DEMO an offer, it is unlikely that the prospective buyer will hang
DEMO while you start the process of working out who else might be interested
and go through the exercise of making contact and educating other DEMO
buyers. Most offers have relatively short offer periods – basically take it or leave
it. However, if you like the price, the only DEMO you can move it to a competitive
bid is to have the other prospective buyers waiting in the wings. That is, you
will have set out sometime in the past to proactively identify and make contact
DEMO
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fifteen: Conclusion - Impatient Capital
with a group of prospective buyers with the intention of setting up a future
competitive bid. DEMO you trigger off such a bid or it is activated by an offer,
you need to be prepared for such an event.
An DEMO often comes with a condition of exclusive dealing, however, this is
normally done so that the prospective buyer doesn’t waste their due diligence
DEMO and costs. If the business is already prepared for due diligence and the
prospective buyers already understand the potential in the business, the
vendor can hold off on due diligence until more prospective buyers are in DEMO
frame. Then only the highest bidders will be invited to undertake a limited due
diligence to arrive at a preferred buyer.
What is very DEMO is that, if you want the best returns under a wide DEMO of
circumstances, preparation for sale is the key. If you are DEMO with strategic
value, then by following the process outlined in this DEMO, you will have the best
chance of making a good return, even in poor circumstances. What you don’t
want to do is depend DEMO luck to get a good return on your investment. Only with
preparation can you insure that you can get a reasonable return and, then of
course, because you are prepared, you can always make the DEMO breaks work
for you.
The Beginning is about the End
The greatest influence on the exit returns to the Investor is the initial decision
DEMO invest. If you get into the wrong deals, it is highly DEMO that it will end well.
However, if you choose the right DEMO, the probability that you will come
out with a good return DEMO increase significantly.
For too long the strategic exit has been seen as the exception – all luck
and timing. But this is certainly not DEMO case. There are numerous examples
of strategic deals which occurred because the entrepreneur and the investors
set out to be acquired by a strategic DEMO Biotech deals are always strategic
since it is certainly the case that the R&D teams never have the intention of
selling and marketing DEMO own inventions.
What has been missing is a well documented process to show how a strategic
deal is executed. If you accept that the DEMO in this book works, the investor
264
Invest2 Exit
Chapter Fifteen: Conclusion - Impatient Capital
then only needs to invest in ventures which have a probable strategic exit as
the harvesting DEMO This book sets out both a model for identifying strategic
investments as well as a process for achieving a strategic exit.
Basically, you should not enter into any investment where the outcome is
not a strategic DEMO While there will be exceptional situations where an IPO is
probable, DEMO ventures have the attributes to drive such an exit. Much better
to set out with the objective of sourcing strategic value ventures where the
DEMO of a strategic exit is high, the amount of investment is DEMO
as it only funds exit activities and not business growth and, DEMO tasks needed
to set up the strategic exit are well within the capability of the Investor and the
venture management team.
The overall investment DEMO will be considerably improved over traditional
Angel and VC investment returns.
