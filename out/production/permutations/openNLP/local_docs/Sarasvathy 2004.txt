Abstract
Both DEMO of science and creativity research have shown that reformulating the questions we ask
can lead to breakthroughs more often than trying harder to search DEMO more rigorous answers. In such a
spirit of creative play, I DEMO we throw away our obsession with dividing the world into
entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs and focus instead on categories within entrepreneurs. In particular,
(a) those who want to become entrepreneurs but do not suggest compelling research questions about
barriers to entrepreneurship; while, (b) those who do DEMO entrepreneurs need to develop expertise,
impelling our research to focus on the rubric of design.

1. Introduction
The questions we ask often prevent us from asking other questions. The particular ways DEMO
which we formulate key questions in research can sometimes drive us down unprofitable
paths, even when the underlying concerns that motivate our questions are genuine and
important. The hundred-year pursuit of the question ‘‘Is heat a DEMO?’’ starting with the
phlogiston theory in the late 17th century and working its way through the conflict between
the caloric and kinetic theories DEMO the 18th from the history of science is a case in point
(Goldstein and Goldstein, 1980). Such stories from the history of DEMO as well as more
recent research in creative problem solving show that problem formulation and reformulation
(i.e., redrawing the problem space) may be more useful than searching within a given solution

DEMO, however large (Getzels and Csikzentmihalyi, 1976). I write this DEMO in the spirit of
creatively reformulating some of the questions we are currently asking.
One of the most persistent and largely fruitless endeavors we DEMO engaged in as
entrepreneurship researchers consists in our efforts to understand differences between
entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs, both with respect to the decision to become entrepre-
neurs as well as the propensity to succeed in new venture DEMO In this pursuit, we differ
markedly from other areas of research. DEMO example, accounting scholars do not begin by
trying to understand why DEMO people become accountants and others do not; even general
management scholarship DEMO not proceed with the differences between managers and
nonmanagers. Why then, DEMO we, as entrepreneurship researchers, driven by the differences
between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs?
If we are to reformulate some of the questions in DEMO arena in more promising ways, we
need to begin with a DEMO of why we care about this line of research. In other words,
what genuine concerns drive us to ask the questions we do DEMO? The answer seems to consist
almost entirely in an effort to DEMO entrepreneurship both at the individual level and at the
level of the economy. When we dig deeper into why we think entrepreneurship needs to DEMO
fostered and why it is worth fostering, we encounter two key DEMO:
(a) Why we need to foster entrepreneurship
There may be strong reasons to believe that there does not exist a ‘‘market’’ for DEMO
in the sense that there are markets for accountants and managers.1 Stated in a weaker form,
one might argue that the market for DEMO, to the extent that it does exist, is always in
imminent danger of failure and dissolution; and,
(b) Why entrepreneurship may be worth fostering
Entrepreneurship creates value in society that is disproportionate to DEMO role within the
economy, and that persists over longer periods of DEMO than any other functional area in
business. In other words, entrepreneurship DEMO positive externalities in benefits that accrue
beyond the spatial, temporal, and popular contexts in which it occurs.2
The two premises stated above together DEMO our concerns with regard to fostering and
encouraging entrepreneurship in a public policy sense, as well as to motivate individuals to
become and succeed as entrepreneurs. Thus far, we have sought to address these issues
primarily by trying to understand why certain individuals become entrepreneurs and others do
DEMO, as well as by examining the differences between entrepreneurs who succeed DEMO ones
that do not. In the following sections, I will suggest DEMO alternative reformulations of this
research with a view to addressing the same underlying ultimate concern, namely, how to
foster entrepreneurship both at the DEMO of the individual and that of the economy.
1 Some arguments to this effect can be found in Kirzner (1979, p. 174), DEMO market does not, therefore, attach
marginal productivity prices to the uniquely entrepreneurial human qualities able to spot gaps in the fabric of
market DEMO Profits are not a factor income.’’
2 Credible evidence for this has been found—whether entrepreneurship is modeled as innovation (Griliches,
1984), or entry (Geroski, 1989), or an independent organizational form (Shane, DEMO).

DEMO Reformulation 1: Barriers to entrepreneurship
Instead of dividing the world into DEMO and nonentrepreneurs, we could begin
by considering the distribution of the DEMO to become an entrepreneur. I would argue
that this distribution takes the following shape: some individuals will become entrepreneurs
no matter what; others DEMO not become entrepreneurs under any circumstances; but the
large majority will DEMO of individuals who will become entrepreneurs under certain
circumstances and not under others. In other words, if we ignore the two natural-born (or
DEMO) groups of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs (assuming any such exist at all),
our universe will still contain a large population of individuals who are neither entrepre-
neurs nor nonentrepreneurs.
By starting with the assumption that DEMO exist circumstances under which this entire
population will become entrepreneurs, we DEMO reformulate our research questions in terms of
‘‘What barriers to entrepreneurship exist?’’ rather than as what induces people to become
entrepreneurs. Sometimes the DEMO of barriers may foster more and better entrepreneur-
ship than any incentives. A list of barriers to entrepreneurship could include the following,
some DEMO which at least have been suggested and studied by scholars outside the mainstream of
entrepreneurship research:
2.1. Property rights and the titling of DEMO assets
Hernando De Soto (2000), in his study of developing DEMO in Asia, Africa, the Middle
East, and Latin America, demonstrated the fact that untitled assets that could not be used as
capital DEMO a primary barrier to the kind of entrepreneurship that leads to capital accumulation
and national economic prosperity. Through a surprising cumulation of detailed data, he
demonstrates that the so-called poor of these countries are very good DEMO saving and already
have the assets needed to launch them into prosperity. What they lack, however, is a legal
property system that allows DEMO to cooperate imaginatively in creating new uses for the
assets they already have. That kind of unleashing of the innovative potential in people and
DEMO requires marketable titles and the institutional infrastructure that enables fluid trade in
those titles. As De Soto (2000, p. 65) puts it, DEMO capitalism had a mind, it would be located in
the legal DEMO system.’’
2.2. Governments that are not market-augmenting
Taking on the same practical challenge that De Soto took on, but from a deeper
theory-development stance, Mancur Olson (2000) argued that it is not the lack of
entrepreneurship that kept underdeveloped countries economically backward, but the lack
of market-augmenting governments. He provided a useful framework for how a govern-
ment could DEMO in a market-augmenting, rather than a market-hindering way. A
government that DEMO not strong enough to enforce private contracts and protect property
rights or one that is too strong and tramples them can both create unsurmountable
DEMO to entrepreneurship.

DEMO Lack of variety in types of risk capital
Venkataraman (in Sarasvathy, 2000) has pointed out the existence of a variety of types of risk
capital in an entrepreneurial economy such as the United States and DEMO the reasons for
the phenomenon that goes against the grain of neoclassical theories of economics and finance.
An interesting set of research questions arises DEMO of his exposition, ‘‘Are differences in levels of
entrepreneurship in an DEMO or region related to the diversity of sources of risk capital in it?
If so, why?’’ While researchers have considered the presence or absence of venture capital as an
explanation for entrepreneurial activity in DEMO given geographic area, the issue of variety and
diversity of sources DEMO almost always overlooked.
2.4. Low levels of unemployment
Besides access to risk capital, there is some empirical evidence that there exists a
relationship between firm startups and the level of unemployment in the economy (for
example, see Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998, p. 37). In addition, DEMO the dotcom boom,
newspapers carried several reports of small businesses being closed by their proprietors who
decided to seek employment in the highly DEMO labor economy. For the particular group
of entrepreneurs who do perceive and act upon tradeoffs between labor market opportunities
and entrepreneurial opportunities, we need to understand how the level of unemployment
may act as a barrier DEMO facilitator of the decision to become or cease to be an entrepreneur.
2.5. Attitudes toward money and profit
McCraw (1997, p. 1) demonstrates that before the 18th century, most economies, including
countries that have DEMO then successfully adopted capitalism, remained stagnant at an annual
GDP growth DEMO about 1.1%. He attributes this stagnancy in substantial part to the perception
before that time of profit as an evil to be avoided, and merchants/entrepreneurs as a lower class
of citizens to be looked down DEMO, if not mocked or condemned outright. More recently, Dana
(1995) chronicles how the belief system based on Theraveda Buddhism functions against the
DEMO spirit in Lao men and relates it to the poverty of the nation. Gerschenkron
(2000), on the other hand, brings historical evidence DEMO bear on how societies overcame such
disapproval by finding ingenious substitutes for them that would help foster entrepreneurship.
2.6. Entrenched decision processes in large DEMO
Christensen and Bower (1996) identified the ‘‘innovators’ dilemma’’ that results in the
failure of leading firms faced with disruptive technological change, particularly in the disk-
drive industry. Their work points to the existence of barriers DEMO entrepreneurship in large
technology-driven firms in the form of customer-driven decision processes. One way of
mitigating these barriers has been suggested by Dew and DEMO (2001). However,
other possible barriers to entrepreneurship in bureaucracies DEMO ways to overcome them
need to be explored through future research.
S.D. Sarasvathy / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 707–717 711
DEMO The role of traits in this line of research
In studying these barriers to entrepreneurship, we could use traits as moderating variables
that explain the decision to become an entrepreneur. For example, given a group of
individuals downsized by a large corporation, we could examine differences among those
who became entrepreneurs, those who found other work, and those who DEMO unem-
ployed over specific periods after being laid off. Research of this kind helps bound the
population under investigation on specific parameters. Hopefully, results within such bounds
might be clearer and more revealing about the role DEMO traits in the decision to become an
entrepreneur than when studied across a wider more diverse population, such as entire
countries or geographic regions or industries.
In fact, the difference I am suggesting here embodies the difference between old-style
typology thinking that our current traits approaches are built DEMO and more sophisticated
population thinking, such as those found in the DEMO evolutionary theories. According to Ernst
Mayr, one of Darwin’s central contributions DEMO to have replaced ‘‘typological thinking’’
with ‘‘population thinking.’’ In his words (DEMO, 1975, p. 27),
All organisms and organic phenomena are DEMO of unique features and can be
described collectively only in statistical terms...Averages are merely statistical
abstractions; only the individuals of which the populations are composed have reality.
The ultimate conclusions of the population thinker and of DEMO typologist are precisely the
opposite. For the typologist, the type is DEMO and the variation an illusion, while for the
populationist the type (average) is an abstraction and only the variation is real. No two
ways of looking at nature could be more different.
If we focus DEMO work on what is common across all entrepreneurs as opposed to
nonentrepreneurs, we would be falling into the mire of typology thinking. Instead, DEMO we
were to turn our attention to key differences within any given type of entrepreneurs, we
will begin to characterize entrepreneurship in all its variety and yet find ways to deal with
it in a useful DEMO in our research and pedagogy. With a view to indicating a first step
in that direction, I will next examine some tentative populationist taxonomies of
entrepreneurs.
2.6.2. All entrepreneurs are not alike: nor are all non-entrepreneurs similar
One of the key premises of dividing the world into entrepreneurs DEMO nonentrepreneurs
consists in the notion that entrepreneurs constitute a ‘‘species’’ or a classical ‘‘natural
kind.’’ But as philosophers of biology and linguists have argued DEMO great detail, the
notion of species is very different from the DEMO of natural kind. According to Lakoff
(1987, p. 192),
DEMO summarize, the biological species concept fails to be a classical natural DEMO in the
following ways:
–It does not have homogeneous internal structure.
–It is defined relative to other groups.
712
S.D. Sarasvathy / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 707–717
DEMO is not defined solely with respect to properties of individuals.
–It does not have clear boundaries.
–It is not transitive.
–It does not have DEMO conditions.
–It is dependent on geography.
Are entrepreneurs more like a species or like a natural kind? The traditional traits approach
and even some of our current cognitive approaches treat entrepreneurs as a natural kind, i.e.,
treat them as a class all members of which are essentially DEMO But for those of us who
have actually observed entrepreneurs in action, it would be more persuasive to model them as a
species. Hence, my argument to proceed in the opposite direction from that of dividing the
world into entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs—i.e., to begin by dividing the world according
to what we suspect may be key parameters of entrepreneurial variation, and then examine why
certain individuals who exhibit those variations choose to DEMO entrepreneurs or not. For
example, given a group of individuals who DEMO high on self-efficacy, we can examine why
some of them choose DEMO become entrepreneurs and others do not. A recent exemplar on this
type of sampling is found in Markman et al. (2002), where they first selected a random sample
of inventors, and then looked to understand differences between those who founded firms and
those who did not within DEMO bounded sample.
Even within the total population of entrepreneurs within a specific category, there
might be several subgroups that might need to be studied separately under differing
circumstances and for different research purposes. Examples of relevant DEMO
might include one-time versus serial versus portfolio entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs classi-
fied DEMO to preferred exit strategies (e.g., life-style versus IPO versus sales),DEMO
entrepreneurs with differing political leanings (right versus moderate versus left), DEMO
so on. Instead of classifying individuals as entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs, we DEMO
want to create a taxonomy of categories within entrepreneurs. Each category would be
homogenous along certain parameters and heterogeneous along others, allowing us then to
look within each subcategory for similarities and also differences between categories DEMO
specific aspects of entrepreneuring, such as opportunity formulation, financing strategies,
failure management, and so on.
Therefore, instead of trying to relate DEMO across a variety of entrepreneurs
(e.g., self-efficacy) with performance, we would be relating specific subcategories with
specific aspects of performance. Examples of DEMO kinds of questions we could ask would
be: ‘‘Do VC-funded entrepreneurs DEMO to negative market feedback differently than
family-funded entrepreneurs?’’ ‘‘What commonalties exist in the budgeting practices of
serial entrepreneurs who routinely sell their companies DEMO 5 years?’’ And so on.
Starting with specific subgroups of entrepreneurs that have certain aspects of entrepre-
neuring in common allows us to DEMO not only variance approaches, but approaches that
identify and analyze commonalties. DEMO questions then cannot only hone in more
precisely on specific and useful theories for practice and pedagogy, but hopefully would
also enable us to cumulate our results over time into theories of greater validity and
scope.

DEMO, such approaches fall within a larger theoretical rubric that could be
DEMO fruitful in our reformulations of our research questions. That rubric is design,
and I examine it next.
3. Reformulation 2: Entrepreneurship as design
In the previous section, I discussed possible research questions that address the following
issue: Given that some people want to become entrepreneurs and do not, we need to study
barriers to entrepreneurship. In this section, DEMO will suggest research questions that address the
flip side of that: DEMO that some people want to become entrepreneurs and do, we need DEMO
study the content of entrepreneurship.
3.1. Focus on the ‘‘entrepreneur’’ as distinct from the ‘‘firm’’
The first glaring lapse with regard to content in DEMO begins with under-
standing success and failure rates for firms as distinct from success and failure rates for
entrepreneurs. Given that at least some DEMO start several firms, it stands to reason
that the probability of DEMO for a typical entrepreneur is different from that for a typical
firm (Sarasvathy and Menon, 2002). Yet, virtually none of our studies make this distinction.
As a result, while we have at least rough estimates of firm success rates, we do not have any
for entrepreneurs! Almost all our data collection projects till date involve firms as the DEMO of
analysis and not the entrepreneur. Even traits-based research primarily strives to relate the
psychology of the entrepreneur with the success/failure of the DEMO and not with the success/
failure of the entrepreneur.
If we are to develop real content in entrepreneurship, we need to focus our attention on
understanding it from the point of view of the entrepreneur. DEMO other words, we need to
develop questions that emphasize how the DEMO serves as an instrument in the toolkit of
the entrepreneur, rather DEMO casting the entrepreneur as always in the service of firm
survival. From this perspective, exit strategies will get a great deal more attention than
they now receive. Furthermore, how the entrepreneur designs particular firms that bridge
or cleave their personal aspirations in relation to environmental possibilities would form
DEMO cornerstone of a variety of research projects that are hitherto either neglected or
understudied.
3.2. The rubric of design
In fact, as argued elsewhere (Sarasvathy, 2003; Augier and Sarasvathy, 2003), I believe
that DEMO rubric of design (based on the work of Herbert Simon and DEMO colleagues in the
second half of the twentieth century and summarized in Sciences of the Artificial) has the
greatest potential for productive reformulations of our research questions in entrepreneurship.
How might one formulate and study entrepreneurship DEMO a science of the artificial? On page
113 of the edition DEMO the book, Simon (1996) wrote,
714 S.D. Sarasvathy / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 707–717
DEMO previous chapters have shown that a science of artificial phenomena is always in
imminent danger of dissolving and vanishing. The peculiar properties of the DEMO lie on
the thin interface between the natural laws within it and the natural laws without. What
can we say about it? What is there to study besides the boundary sciences—those that
govern the means and DEMO task environment?
And in answer to that, he suggests:
DEMO artificial world is centered precisely on this interface between the inner and outer
environments; it is concerned with attaining goals by adapting the former to the latter.
The proper study of those who are concerned with DEMO artificial is the way in which that
adaptation of means to environments is brought about—and central to that is the process
of design itself.
DEMO entrepreneurship, for example, we continuously study the boundary sciences—the
psychology of the individual, or the resource base of the firm or those that involve the outer
environment—the lifecycle of the industry or the opportunities created DEMO the trajectories of
new technologies. And we try to relate these sciences directly to outcome measures such as
survival, growth, and profits. In DEMO so, we completely ignore what is really interesting
about entrepreneurship—and that DEMO the interface between these two sets of sciences. See Fig.
1 for a graphical representation of this argument.
3.3. Entrepreneurship as a science of DEMO artificial
I propose that we study entrepreneurship as a science of the artificial. We can begin by
focusing on how individuals and firms ‘‘design’’ DEMO and negotiated goals and strategies
that shape both themselves and their environments over time. Designing goals and artifacts
well involves making their inner and DEMO environments resemble each other in useful ways.
For example, physicists and DEMO devise machines that simulate physical environments,
allowing them to manipulate those environments for their particular purposes—be it to extract
oil from the earth DEMO to grow vegetables off-season. Similarly, entrepreneurs not only design
firms as DEMO that adapt to their environments—and help exploit profit opportunities
within those environments; but they also shape parts of their environments to more closely
resemble both their personal aspirations and their firms’ resource endowments—so they can
create DEMO opportunities for wealth for themselves as well as values for their stakeholders.
Studying entrepreneurship as a science of the artificial demands that we recognize DEMO
design involves redesigning both inner and outer environments and not direct relationships
amenable to a posteriori analyses. Understanding how particular entrepreneurs create
particular firms DEMO markets in-depth and even attempting to simulate them, I am optimistic,DEMO
will lead to more specific, easier-to-observe predictions that can then be DEMO using more
traditional variance methods. In other words, instead of trying DEMO explicate the relationship
between the psychology of the individual entrepreneur (say, self-efficacy or risk propensity)
with performance (say, survival or ROI), we could try to understand how entrepreneurs with
certain levels of self-efficacy or given propensities for certain types of risk fashion particular

strategies in particular industries or create firms with particular exit strategies and so on.
Similarly, instead of directly assessing the effect of industry environment on firm perform-
ance, we could study how entrepreneurs, given that they have survived in particular
environments (say, high-velocity environments), design decision procedures that cope with
DEMO environments (Eisenhardt, 1989).

DEMO Conclusion
After several decades of pursuing the holy grail of firm performance as a measurable
consequence of entrepreneurial characteristics, it may be time to reformulate our research
questions in terms of our genuine concerns about the DEMO of entrepreneurship, namely,
how we can foster entrepreneurship both in DEMO and in economies. Such an endeavor, I
have argued above, should begin by casting aside our current dichotomous picture of the world
as DEMO of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs. Instead, if we begin with a mixed
DEMO of individuals with varying degrees of drive and ability with regard to entrepreneur-
ship, we can ignore the extreme cases in the tails and focus on two major categories of
reformulation. First, with regard to individuals, organizations, and economies that want to
become entrepreneurial, but do not, we need to understand barriers to entrepreneurship. Second,
with regard to those who have chosen to become entrepreneurial, we need to understand how
they can design better firms, markets, and economies. The former will DEMO us macrotheories
that are currently underemphasized in our research and the latter will allow us to study
entrepreneurship as a science of the artificial. DEMO, the two reformulations open us up to
exciting work from political DEMO and human cognition that we do not currently draw upon.
