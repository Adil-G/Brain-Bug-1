There DEMO a crisis in the field of organizational science. The principal symptom of this crisis is
that as our research methods and techniques have become DEMO sophisticated, they have also
become increasingly less useful for solving the DEMO problems that members of
organizations face (Susman & Evered, 1978: DEMO).
Each August, we (academics) come to talk with each DEMO; during the rest of the year we
read each others’ papers DEMO our journals and write our own papers so that we may, DEMO turn,
have an audience the following August: an incestuous, closed loop (Hambrick, 1994: 13).
A substantial body of evidence suggests that executives typically do not turn to academics
or academic research findings DEMO developing management strategies and practices (e.g.,
Abrahamson, 1996; Mowday, 1997, Porter & McKibbon, 1988). Similarly, researchers rarely turn
to practitioners for inspiration in setting their research questions (Sackett & Larson, DEMO) or for
insight in interpreting their results (Rynes, McNatt & DEMO, 1999). Given this state of affairs, it is
hardly surprising that considerable gaps often exist between the normative recommendations of
organizational researchers DEMO actual management practices in organizations (e.g., Johns, 1993;
Miller, Greenwood, & Hinings, 1997; Pfeffer, 1998).
That there is DEMO wide gap between organizational research and managerial practice is hardly
a new observation. Discussions of the causes (and potential solutions) to this gap DEMO been
widely debated for some time. For example, there have been DEMO forums on research
utilization (e.g., Beyer & Trice, 1982) and research relevance (e.g., Aldag, 1997), as well as
several books devoted to the topic (e.g., Campbell, Daft & Hulin, 1982; Hakel, Sorcher, Beer &
Moses, 1982; Lawler, Mohrman, Mohrman, Ledford & Cummings, 1985; Murphy & Saal, 1990).
Moreover, the gap is not restricted to the organizational sciences, but rather is found in nearly all
fields in which there are both researchers and DEMO (e.g., Glaser, Abelson & Garrison,
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   3
1983; Leontif, 1982; Rogers, 1995). For example, Mosteller (1981) DEMO that it took nearly
200 years from the time a clear and convincing cure was found for scurvy in the British shipping
industry to DEMO time it was widely adopted by the British Navy.
The pervasiveness of the research-practice gap has led thoughtful observers to conclude
that its origins DEMO deeply embedded in academics’ and practitioners’ most basic assumptions and
beliefs (DEMO Shrivastava & Mitroff, 1984; Thomas & Tymon, 1982). For DEMO, Shrivastava &
Mitroff (1984) have suggested that academics and practitioners have fundamentally different
frames of reference with respect to such things as DEMO types of information believed to constitute
valid bases for action, the DEMO in which information is ordered and arranged for sense-making,
the past experiences used to evaluate the validity of knowledge claims, and the metaphors used to
symbolically construct the world in meaningful ways. Similarly, others have shown that there are
notable differences between academics and practitioners with respect DEMO the goals they seek to
influence, the social systems in which DEMO operate, the variables they attempt to manipulate, and
acceptable time frames for addressing problems (Johns, 1993; Powell & Owen-Smith, 1998;
DEMO & Tymon, 1982).
After reviewing the literature on research utilization DEMO to 1982, Beyer and Trice
concluded that “the most persistent observation DEMO . .  is that researchers and users belong to
separate communities DEMO very different values and ideologies and that these differences impede
utilization” (DEMO). Thus, despite longstanding concerns about the limited research-practice
interface (e.g., Campbell et al., 1982; Susman & Evered, 1978), many DEMO are skeptical
about whether closer relationships are possible (e.g., Cummings, DEMO; Garland, 1999; Hakel,
1994; Oviatt & Miller, 1989) or even desirable (e.g., Earley, 1999; Fagenson-Eland, 1999;
Gillespie, 1991).

WHY DEMO FORUM?
Against this backdrop, one might wonder about the usefulness DEMO exploring, yet again, the
topic of knowledge transfer between academics and practitioners. However, we believe the issue
is ripe for re-examination for at least two reasons.
First, economic and political conditions have been changing in ways that have made both
academics and practitioners potentially more receptive to DEMO and learning from with one
another (e.g., Burack, 1999; Rynes & Trank, 1999; Slaughter & Leslie, 1997). Second, although
DEMO claims continue to be made about the nature of the academic-practitioner interface (e.g.,
Larwood & Gattiker, 1999), the vast majority are DEMO on personal predilections and anecdotal
evidence rather than solid empirical data.
Environmental Changes
Changes in economic and political conditions have substantially altered the climate DEMO
collaboration between academics and practitioners. On the practitioner side, intensified
competition DEMO worldwide markets has increased organizational performance pressures and made
practitioners more receptive to any ideas – academic or otherwise -- that might make them DEMO
their organizations more effective (Abrahamson, 1996; Micklethwait & Wooldridge, 1996;
Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000). Additionally, many organizations have downsized DEMO corporate
research staffs, creating a void that is increasingly filled by DEMO and government researchers
(Cohen, Florida, Randazzese, & Walsh, 1998; Powell & Owen-Smith, 1998). To meet the
challenge of global competitiveness, public policy has also changed in ways that encourage
industry-academic cooperation, DEMO as providing tax breaks for corporate funding of university
research and developing funding programs that require industry-university collaboration as a
condition of funding (Cohen et al., 1998).
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   5
Taken DEMO, these developments have resulted in practitioners becoming more heavily
involved in DEMO and academic research. This involvement has taken the form of increased
donations to higher education, expanded participation in academic advisory boards, increased
recruitment DEMO academic researchers by private industry, participation in university-industry
research consortia (UIRCs), and location of corporate research and development activities near
major universities (e.g., Burack, 1999; Slaughter & Leslie, 1997; Stross, 1997)DEMO According to
Powell and Owen-Smith (1998), corporations that have the DEMO networks with university
researchers and the strongest internal capacity for identifying and evaluating scientific research
will be in the best position to solve the DEMO important problems that impede further progress.
On the academic side, dramatic DEMO in resource dependencies have increased higher
education’s reliance on the private sector for both research and teaching support. Public funding
for higher education as DEMO percent of total revenues and federal research support per academic
researcher have both been declining for over two decades (Cohen et al., 1988; National Center for
Education Statistics, 1997). Additionally, corporate and for-profit DEMO are beginning to
emerge as serious competitors to higher education (Meister, 1998; Mowday, 1997), just as
consulting firms are emerging as DEMO to university researchers (e.g., Abrahamson, 1996;
Huey, 1993; DEMO & Wooldridge, 1996). These changes, which have been observed in
several countries (Slaughter & Leslie, 1997), have made universities increasingly DEMO on
private funds at a time when competition for those funds has been intensifying (Cohen et al.,
1998; Hambrick, 1994).
At the same time that universities have become more dependent on alternative forms DEMO
support, public policy has also increased the incentives for universities (and individual faculty
members) to produce knowledge that has commercial value (Powell DEMO Owen-Smith, 1998;
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   6
Press & Washburn, 2000). For example, the 1980 Patent and Trade Amendments (commonly
known as the Bayh-Dole Act) allowed universities to retain the DEMO rights to scientific
inventions, a development that has led to a DEMO between the traditionally distinct roles of
academia and industry (Powell & DEMO, 1998; Slaughter & Leslie, 1997).
There is considerable evidence DEMO academics have responded in ways consistent with
these changing opportunities and dependencies. For example, since the passage of Bayh-Dole,
there has been dramatic growth in the number of formal university-industry research partnerships
(UIRCs), both in the organizational studies area (e.g., Burack, 1999; Lawler et DEMO, 1985) and in
academia more generally (Cyert & Goodman, 1997). Cohen, Florida and Goe (1994) reported that
in 1990, DEMO than 1,000 UIRCs spent approximately $4.12 billion on cooperative research – a
figure more than twice the amount provided by the National Science DEMO Moreover, the
initiative for the vast majority of these centers (73%) came from universities rather than industry,
and most (61% versus DEMO) were initiated by individual faculty members or departments rather
than university DEMO (Cohen et al., 1998). Thus, the growing desire of DEMO academics
to interact with practitioners seems clear.
Claims in Search of Evidence
The second factor that argues for re-examining knowledge transfer between academics
and DEMO is the paucity of empirical work on the topic, particularly in DEMO organizational
sciences. Although many volumes now exist describing the gap between organizational science
and practice (e.g., Lawler et al., 1985; Hakel et DEMO, 1982; Larwood & Gattiker, 1999; Murphy &
Saal, 1990), the vast majority of this work has been in the form DEMO personal reflections and
speculation (Campbell et al., 1982 is an exception). The nonempirical nature of previous
discourse in the organizational sciences has DEMO in widely varying views of academic-
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   7
practitioner DEMO (see, for example, Burack, 1999; Hakel et al., 1982; Susman & Evered,
1978, or Wright, 1999 versus Earley, DEMO; Gillespie, 1991 or Fagenson-Eland, 1999), with little
empirical basis DEMO sorting among the various claims.
For example, academics are deeply split DEMO terms of whether they see research
collaboration with practitioners as having primarily positive, or primarily negative, effects on the
advancement of science. On DEMO positive side, some have argued that practitioners can be
excellent sources DEMO important and stimulating problems and that their unique insights, when
combined DEMO those from an academic perspective, can stimulate important new scientific
discoveries (e.g., Boehm, 1980; Campbell et al., 1982; Dunnette, 1990; McCall & Bobko, 1990).
Indeed, Betz (1996) and Powell DEMO Owen-Smith (1998) argue that practitioners are most likely
to seek alliances with outside researchers primarily for the most difficult and important scientific
problems, due to the difficulty of solving them by themselves. In addition, pursuing joint research
in organizational settings lends itself to examination of important variables DEMO are difficult to
simulate or manipulate in other types of research (DEMO, Hackman, 1985).
On the negative side, many worry that DEMO with practitioners may mean that only
narrow, short-term, or commercially profitable projects will be pursued (e.g., Murphy & Saal,
1990) or that managerial interests will be pursued at the expense of employees or DEMO broader
society (Fagenson-Eland, 1999). Other concerns are that scientific progress will be stymied by
corporate restrictions on data collection, interpretation, and DEMO (e.g., Cohen et al.,
1998), or by the difficulties of meeting the conventional requirements of normal, positivist
science in organizational settings (e.g., Cook & Campbell, 1979). Finally, some worry about DEMO
ease with which researchers can be subtly (e.g., Beyer & Trice, 1982; Gillespie, 1991) or not so
subtly (e.g., Press & Washburn, 2000) co-opted by corporate interests and incentives.

Knowledge Transfer   8
The DEMO to choose among these claims is limited, first by the paucity DEMO empirical
evidence and second, by partially conflicting results among the studies DEMO do exist. For example,
with respect to whether academic-practitioner collaboration tends to be associated with more (or
less) important research problems, Campbell et al. (1982) found some evidence for both
propositions. Specifically, although a relatively large proportion of studies that researchers
identified as their “most DEMO resulted from academic-practitioner collaborations, so did a
relatively large percentage of DEMO significant” studies (e.g., outgrowths of consulting projects).
Similarly, Rynes DEMO colleagues (1999) also reported somewhat mixed results. On the
positive side, they found that researchers who spent more time at organizational research sites
reported greater personal learning than those who spent less time, and also that the resultant
research was cited more heavily by other researchers. On DEMO other hand, they also found a
negative relationship between practitioner involvement DEMO formulating the research question and
subsequent citations by other researchers. Thus, DEMO least in terms of citation rates (which are
admittedly more academic DEMO practitioner-oriented), the best results seemed to be attained when
academics posed their own questions, but then more fully immersed themselves in organizations
during the process of investigation.
Moving outside of the organizational sciences, Louis, DEMO, Gluck and Stoto (1989)
and Cohen et al. (1998) report that the most successful academic researchers in the biological and
physical DEMO also tend to have the highest levels of interaction with practitioners. Similarly,
Pelz and Andrews (1976) found that corporate researchers who spent DEMO least part of their time
working on assigned (rather than self-chosen) problems and who had boundary-spanning roles
(e.g., management) in addition to pure research tasks were also the most productive. Thus, a
preponderance of the evidence suggests that collaborations between researchers and practitioners
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   9
increase DEMO productivity and in some cases, quality as well. However, the latter variable
seems to depend on the specifics of the collaboration.
With respect DEMO whether or not practitioners place limits on scientific inquiry or
dissemination, DEMO et al. (1999) found little evidence of such problems among the
organizational scientists they studied. However, an important limitation of their sample was that
they inquired only about studies that had successfully made it through DEMO top-tier publication
review process. Moreover, evidence from the life sciences, where commercialization is generally
a much more immediate prospect than in the organizational DEMO, suggests that organizations
are increasingly placing constraints on the dissemination of DEMO obtained through private
funding (Cohen et al., 1998; Press & DEMO, 2000). However, these results might not apply to
the organizational sciences (Powell & Owen-Smith, 1998), since commercialization potential and
implementation DEMO are far less certain than in the physical sciences (Barney, 1991; Pfeffer &
Sutton, 2000).
Given the potential for both positive and negative outcomes from collaborative research,
there is a need for DEMO evidence that can create a more sophisticated picture of the science-
practice relationship. We turn now to a description of the types of evidence DEMO to this
forum.
THE ARTICLES
Forty-nine manuscripts were submitted to this forum. Of these, 24 were returned without
review, 16 were rejected on DEMO review, five were rejected after revision and resubmission, and
five were accepted for publication.  Characteristics of the submissions are listed in Table 1.
(Insert Table 1 about here)
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   10
Perhaps DEMO most notable characteristic of the submitted manuscripts concerns the large
number of studies that were returned without review. The most common reason for not DEMO
articles was that they did not contain any data, as required DEMO AMJ’s mission statement and
guidelines for contributors. Thus, the previously noted DEMO for academics to express
opinions about academic-practitioner relations in the absence of data characterized many
submissions to the present forum as well. After eliminating DEMO that were not reviewed, the
most common reasons for rejection were DEMO validity problems (77%), mismatches between
theory and methods (46%), and weak or nonexistent theory (37%).
Another interesting set of findings concerns the extent to which the articles themselves
appeared to reflect collaboration DEMO academics and practitioners. Coding revealed that fewer
than 20% of the studies involved practitioners in the initial design of the study or engaged them DEMO
co-authors after the study had been completed. On the other hand, DEMO of the authors had direct
contact with practitioners during the course of their studies, and approximately three-fifths of the
articles stressed that academics and practitioners could learn from each other (as opposed to
assuming that academics were the more knowledgeable group, and that the problem of transfer
runs only in one direction). Finally, various forms of collaboration tended to be highly correlated;
for example, involving practitioners in the initial stages of the design was correlated .73 with
having a practitioner co-author.
Finally, we analyzed whether there were any detectable relationships between article
characteristics and DEMO decisions (e.g., reject, revise and resubmit, accept after revision). This
analysis revealed that articles were more likely to be accepted if DEMO academics and practitioners
provided data for the study (r = .32) and if the authors assumed that knowledge transfer was a
two-way street, rather than a unidirectional process in which knowledge flows from academics to
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   11
practitioners (r = .45). In fact, these two characteristics were evident in four of the five articles
eventually accepted for publication, as described below.
In the first article, Susan Mohrman, Cristina Gibson and Allan Mohrman DEMO the
factors associated with practitioner evaluations of research usefulness in a multi-organization
research project. Because the participating organizations displayed different degrees of
involvement with DEMO research, the researchers were able to assess the extent to which DEMO
hypothesized factors – joint interpretive forums, perspective-taking, and research impact on
organizational change decisions – were associated with practitioner perceptions of research
usefulness. DEMO than anything else, their results stress the heavily social nature of DEMO knowledge
transfer process.
In “The Science and Practice of Team Development: DEMO the Link,” Lynn
Offermann and Rebecca Spiros surveyed 245 team development practitioners (59% practitioners
and 41% academics) from the Organizational Development and DEMO Division of the Academy
of Management. Their objectives were to determine the current state of team development
practice, the research needs of team development practitioners, and ways to improve the linkage
between the science and practice of team development. Their results reveal a number of causes
for optimism DEMO the flow of knowledge between academics and practitioners, as well as DEMO
areas for concern.
In “Knowledge Representations and Knowledge Transfer,” Richard Boland, Jagdip Singh,
Paul Salipante, John Aram, Sharon Fay and Prasert Kanawattanachai draw upon theories of
cognition and learning to test whether managers DEMO to different forms of knowledge
representation (interpretive, abstract, or particular) subsequently display different decision
making processes and outcomes. They hypothesized that these DEMO different ways of presenting
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   12
knowledge DEMO activate different types of information processing schema, which in turn would
DEMO to different decision patterns on a subsequent task. Although different decision patterns
indeed emerged, they were not all in the directions predicted by the hypotheses.
In “Academic-Practitioner Collaboration in Management Research: A Case of Cross-
Profession Collaboration,” Teresa Amabile, Chelley Patterson, Jennifer Mueller, Tom Wojcik,
Paul Odomirok, Mel Marsh and Steven Kramer present a case study of a three-year collaborative
research venture involving academics and practitioners from several universities DEMO business
organizations. The authors use a variety of data sources (e-mail DEMO, surveys, minutes of
meetings and participant observations) to create a DEMO model of success determinants in
cross-profession collaborations (i.e.,  “collaborations between DEMO from different
professions and organizations who come together primarily as individuals rather than as
organizational representatives to accomplish a particular work project”). The DEMO that
ultimately emerges reflects a combination of earlier models of interorganizational collaboration
(e.g., Dyer & Singh, 1998; Gray & Wood, 1997) DEMO individual collaboration within
organizations (e.g., Tjosvold, 1986).
In “How DEMO is University-based Scientific Research to Private High Technology
Firms?” Jennifer Spencer examines the extent to which U.S. and Japanese corporate researchers
in the DEMO panel display (FPD) industry cited both academic and corporate research in the pre-
commercialization stages of FPD technology. In addition, she looked at the extent to which
published research diffused across international boundaries. Her results DEMO to the potential
importance of cross-cultural and institutional differences (such as DEMO created by Bayh-Dole), as
well as the importance of publishing in practitioner journals for knowledge transfer to
nonacademics.

CONTRIBUTIONS DEMO KNOWLEDGE
With the exception of the papers by Amabile et al. and Mohrman et al., the articles in this
forum do not share many obvious similarities. Methodologically, there are two case studies, one
experiment, one survey, and one archival analysis. The dependent variables of interest include
perceived research usefulness (Mohrman et al.; Offermann & Spiros), transfer of DEMO to a
decision task (Boland et al.), research citations (Spencer), and goal achievement, team
functioning, and team member outcomes (Amabile et al.). Also, as is typical of much research in
this area, three of the five articles (Amabile et al., Boland et al., Mohrman et al.) employ small
samples.
The articles contribute to DEMO of both the creation and diffusion of knowledge,
two crucial underlying processes with respect to knowledge transfer (Choo, 1998; Knott &
DEMO, 1999; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1996). Of the forum articles, Amabile et al. deal most
directly with issues related to joint academic-practitioner DEMO creation. Amabile and her
colleagues suggest a number of ways in which the eventual quality of research is likely to be
enhanced by practitioner DEMO In the study they describe, practitioners contributed
directly to research quality DEMO generating additional study participants, facilitating high response
rates, and contributing to improved content coding schemes.
However, practitioners also contributed to research quality in more subtle ways as well.
For example, by challenging the lead researcher’s tendency to interpret results primarily in light
of previous theory, practitioners provided the kind of alternative interpretations that often lead to
new theoretical breakthroughs DEMO syntheses (e.g., Bartunek, 1988; Bartunek & Louis, 1996; Daft
et al., 1987; McCall & Bobko, 1990; Weick, 1989). Second, by pressing for greater participation,
practitioners exposed the academics’ tacit assumptions about how the project was “supposed” to
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   14
operate DEMO thus opened the way for more diverse contributions by a larger number of people.
Finally, by pressing for preliminary results early in the research process, practitioners appear to
have facilitated a variant of fast prototyping. Although the benefits of prototyping have not yet
been tested against other methods DEMO organizational science research, these processes have been
found to produce better DEMO than linear sequential methods in product development settings
(Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995).
The processes described by Amabile et al. (and to some extent, Mohrman et al.) also
highlight the importance of good social DEMO between academics and practitioners for
successful knowledge creation. For example, Jehn, Northcraft and Neale (1999) have shown that
the benefits of knowledge DEMO can be derailed if they become overshadowed by process or
values conflicts. Thus, both Amabile et al. and Mohrman et al. paid a great deal of attention to
team- and trust-building activities such as frequent electronic DEMO and face-to-face interactions,
joint sense-making sessions, procedural restructurings, and conflict resolution procedures.
With the exception of Amabile et al., the articles here focus primarily on knowledge
diffusion. One of the most persistent findings from DEMO research is that the adoption of new
knowledge tends to be a slow process, even under highly favorable circumstances. For example,
transfer of knowledge has been shown to fail even in situations where there is DEMO evidence of
its superiority over prior understandings, when those transmitting and DEMO new knowledge
are both from the same organization, and when the DEMO for the knowledge has great need of a
solution and may even have commissioned a search for alternatives (e.g., Argyris, 1996; Corwin
& Louis, 1982; Dougherty, 1992; Glaser et al., 1983; Mosteller, 1981; Rogers, 1995). Given the
difficulties of knowledge transfer under such favorable conditions, it is hardly surprising that such
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   15
different DEMO as academics and practitioners often experience difficulties in learning from one
another.
The articles in this forum provide some clues regarding barriers to dissemination, as well
as some potential solutions. For example, both Spencer and Offermann & Spiros show that
knowledge transfer can be impeded by the choices DEMO academics make about where to publish
their research. Consistent with previous research (e.g., Terpstra & Rozell, 1997a), Offermann and
Spiros find that many practitioners – even those with doctoral degrees – stop reading academic
DEMO once they enter the world of practice. (Indeed, even many academics turn more to the
practitioner literature for guidance when they take administrative DEMO in universities;
Argyris, 1996). Still, Spencer finds that when university scientists publish their work in journals
that are read by practitioners, their research is nearly as influential as the research published by
practitioners (at least in the United States, although not in Japan).
In addition to impediments that follow from decisions about where to disseminate
academic DEMO, there are also issues of how academics communicate when they do DEMO to reach
practitioners. In particular, the studies by Boland et al. DEMO Mohrman et al. suggest that the typical
way of presenting academic information (through objective, declarative knowledge) is a relatively
ineffective way of getting knowledge to “take” in practitioner settings (see also Perrow, 1993 and
DEMO de Vall, Bolas & Kang, 1976). Taken together, both DEMO et al. and Mohrman et al.
suggest that practitioners are either less motivated, or less able, to process written declarative
information than information DEMO in other ways. As one participant in Morhman et al. put it,
“When we went over the data, it really, really helped DEMO have the researcher interpret the
results…if you just gave that output to people to read, they wouldn’t…with interpretation of the
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   16
data DEMO a summary and then a discussion of the data and its relevance, that’s really where it’s
at.”
The preceding quote also illustrates the strong advantages of face-to-face interaction for
knowledge transfer between groups with widely differing DEMO Such interaction appears
to be crucial for developing many types of shared knowledge. However, because face-to-face
interactions are a very time-intensive way of transmitting knowledge, most dissemination of
academic research takes place through a variety of intermediaries. Indeed, Abrahamson (1996:
263) notes that “entire industries often stand between the creators of innovations and the masses
who use them.” DEMO, academics who are interested in disseminating research to those who might
DEMO it will generally have to find ways to both motivate and enable practitioners to process and
use academic findings, even those with direct implications for practice (see also Argyris, 1985;
Conger, 1998; Petty & Cacioppo, 1996, and Rynes & Trank, 1999). Boland et DEMO suggest two
methods of presentation (interpretive and particularistic) that may motivate more active
information processing among nonacademics, while Choo (1998) and Conger (1998) suggest
others.
Finally, Offermann and Spiros report that there is a sense among those engaged in
organizational development that academic research is DEMO, rather than ahead of, organizational
practice. Although this perception might reflect little more than a self-serving bias among
practitioners, there is other evidence to suggest that this observation may well be valid (Galbraith,
1980). For example, Barley, Meyer & Gash (1988) used text DEMO to show that academics
tended to follow, rather than lead, practitioners with respect to thinking and discourse about
organizational cultures. Similarly, others have found that researchers followed practitioners with
respect to quality circles and quality DEMO (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Dean &
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   17
Bowen, 1994). Given these findings, it is interesting that so much attention has been focused on
the benefits of research diffusion to practitioners and DEMO organizations (Gannon, 1983; Terpstra
& Rozell, 1987b), but so little on the potential benefits of practical knowledge for researchers and
for DEMO advancement of science.
WHAT NEXT?
Previous research suggests that the quality and rate of knowledge creation are enhanced
by various forms of creative DEMO – tensions between different disciplines (Bylinsky, 1990)
or different types of knowledge (Jehn et al., 1999), between competing hypotheses (Platt, 1964;
Latham, Erez & Locke, 1988), between cognition and action (Connolly, 1982), between plans
and prototypes (Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995), between thinking and writing or speaking
(Weick, 1979) DEMO between theory and implementation (Lewin, 1946; Susman & Evered,
DEMO). These patterns suggest that the rate of knowledge creation, dissemination, and
utilization can be increased through deliberate institutional strategies and tactics (e.g., Choo,
1998; Leonard-Barton, 1995; Stewart, 1997). In this final section, we discuss how
organizational scientists and practitioners might develop a strategy to increase the pace and
quality of knowledge creation and dissemination DEMO collaborative efforts.
Recently, Nonaka (1994) and colleagues (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka &
Konno, 1998) have developed a theory of knowledge creation that is consistent with the view
that significant knowledge emerges DEMO the combination of disparate perspectives. Nonaka
et al. propose that there are basically two kinds of knowledge, tacit and explicit. Tacit
knowledge is personal, context-specific knowledge that is difficult to formalize and
communicate, and includes DEMO (e.g., mental models, schemata), technical (concrete
know-how or skill), and subjective (insights, hunches) insights. In contrast, explicit or
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   18
codified DEMO is transmittable in formal, systematic language in symbols, words or
numbers.
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) and other similar models (e.g., Choo, 1998; Leonard-
Barton, 1995) propose that new knowledge is created most rapidly when there is continual
cycling from one form of knowledge conversion DEMO another (e.g., tacit to explicit, explicit to
tacit). Beginning DEMO the individual but then moving on to higher levels, they hypothesize
DEMO a “knowledge spiral” is created through four interactive methods of knowledge
conversion: socialization (tacit to tacit), externalization (tacit to explicit), combination
(explicit to explicit) and internalization (explicit to tacit). Table 2 illuminates these four
processes in light of the articles in this forum, as well as in the broader context of academic-
practitioner knowledge creation DEMO dissemination.
(Insert Table 2 about here)
In socialization, tacit knowledge is exchanged through joint activities (e.g., spending
time together, learning together) in order to produce some form of shared mental model,
metaphor, analogy, or culture which can then be employed as a framework DEMO moving
forward. Successful socialization requires that individuals empathize with one another enough
to incorporate the other’s feelings and beliefs, such that a larger sense of situation and
possibility can emerge (Nonaka & Konno, 1998). DEMO socialization involves acceptance
of the beliefs, feelings, and emotions of others, it is very difficult to achieve without some
form of shared face-to-face experience.
The importance of socialization processes for moving forward to other forms DEMO
knowledge conversion is illustrated in both the Amabile et al. and Mohrman et al. articles. In

that DEMO improved data collection and interpretation processes, while in Mohrman et al.,DEMO
early perspective-taking and joint sense-making sessions increased perceived usefulness of
the research that eventually emerged.  More generally, academics and practitioners can share
and DEMO tacit knowledge through joint symposia (such as those held at Academy DEMO
Management meetings), consulting relationships, academic advisory councils, and “key
school” recruiting relationships.
Externalization is the process by which tacit knowledge is made DEMO In
externalization, intuitions or images are converted into tangible statements, metaphors,
analogies, hypotheses, or models (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995: 64). A good example of
externalization was provided by Amabile et al. DEMO this forum, where challenges from
practitioners made academics aware of their DEMO notions with respect to both
research process and substance. More broadly, DEMO assumptions of practitioners can be made
explicit through interaction with academics employing case analysis, grounded theory or
protocol analysis. Alternatively, tacit assumptions of DEMO can be brought into sharp
relief during the process of conducting ethnographic research.
In combination, explicit knowledge from different disciplines, functional areas, or
perspectives are analyzed for commonalities and discrepancies in order to produce a DEMO
synthesis. Combinations of explicit knowledge comprise the vast majority of contributions to
scientific journals (Daft & Lewin, 1990; Sackett & Larson, 1990), although most such
combinations appear to derive solely from the academic knowledge base rather than from a
combination of academic and practitioner knowledge (Rynes & McNatt, forthcoming; Sackett
& Larson, 1990). Academics also transmit explicit information to practitioners through books
and publications in practitioner journals (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000; Spencer, this volume), but
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   20
most DEMO this output does not reflect new knowledge in the sense defined by Nonaka, as it does
not represent a synthesis of academic and practitioner knowledge but rather a simple
translation of academic findings to presumed practitioner DEMO and format. Perhaps the
failure to truly integrate practitioner and academic perspectives is what causes this form of
knowledge transfer to be generally ineffective (Boland et al. and Offermann & Spiros, this
volume; Conger, 1998; Terpstra & Rozell, 1997a).
In internalization, explicit knowledge is converted to tacit knowledge through learning
by doing. The Boland et al. paper DEMO ways of transmitting knowledge – through
interpretive or particularistic frameworks – that may be more likely to accomplish that goal
than the typical journal DEMO More generally, there are a variety of ways in which
academics DEMO practitioners might internalize knowledge across boundaries. For example,
action research presents opportunities for both academics and practitioners to add to their tacit
knowledge DEMO through implementation and subsequent modification of academic theories.
Additional knowledge creation and utilization can then be further accelerated by embodying
the newly combined knowledge DEMO some form of summary model, tool, or framework.
According to Nonaka et al., knowledge creation increases in greater-than-additive
fashion when all four forms of knowledge conversion are actively pursued and reflected
against each other:
DEMO key to knowledge creation lies in the mobilization and conversion of tacit
knowledge…a spiral emerges when the interaction between tacit and explicit
knowledge is DEMO dynamically from a lower ontological level (e.g., the
individual) to DEMO levels (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995: 56-67).
This framework generates DEMO number of insights that help explain why the knowledge
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   21
gap DEMO academics and practitioners remains so persistent. For example, the theory posits
DEMO the root of all knowledge creation is the mobilization of tacit knowledge. However, the
most elite organizational science journals are heavily dominated by explicit to explicit
knowledge conversion, which is the form least directly associated with tacit knowledge. In
addition, the vast majority of this research is based on knowledge conversion within the
bounds of the academic community, rather than across academic-practitioner boundaries
(Rynes & McNatt, forthcoming). In addition, surveys of researchers (Campbell et al., 1982)
and empirical coding of DEMO articles (Sackett & Larson, 1990) both suggest that the vast
DEMO of ostensibly combination-based research actually consists of very modest extensions
of previous research, rather than truly new combinations.
Second, Nonaka et al. suggest DEMO unless successful socialization occurs between
academics and practitioners -- with each side truly understanding and empathizing with the
other -- attempts to transfer explicit DEMO across boundaries are likely to fall on deaf
ears (see also DEMO et al., 1983; Rogers, 1995). In the absence of DEMO inter-group
socialization, the independent social identities of academics and practitioners are DEMO to
solidify (Ashforth & Mael, 1991), with accompanying increases in in-group/out-group
thinking reducing the motivation for each side to learn from DEMO other (Weick, 1996).
Third, Nonaka et al. suggest that DEMO knowledge creation begins with individuals and
then moves up to progressively higher levels. However, empirical examination of our
scientific literature has shown that case studies, reflective essays, and inductive theory-
building have become increasingly disadvantaged DEMO organizational science journals over the
years (Daft, 1980; Dunbar, 1983; Locke & Cooper, 2000). And yet, as Boland et al.
demonstrate in this volume, these are the types of research that are most likely to resonate
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   22
with DEMO (see also Beyer & Trice, 1982; Dunbar, 1983), perhaps because they
emerge through socialization and have as one of their goals DEMO externalization of
assumptions, norms, and practices (i.e., tacit knowledge).
Nonaka et al’s framework not only sheds light on reasons for the DEMO academic-
practice gap; it also suggests that current academic knowledge generation DEMO are likely
to be suboptimal even when viewed from a purely academic perspective. Setting aside the
issue of whether or not knowledge is crossing DEMO boundaries, it has been
noted that there are also relatively few DEMO instances of socialization, externalization, and
internalization within the academic community (DEMO, 1996; Weick, 1996). For example,
there has been DEMO general decrease in the number of personal reflections by academics
(externalization) in top-tier journals (Van Maanen, 1998), and few cases where DEMO
with competing ideas get to the bottom of the other’s assumptions (DEMO) so that truly
new combinations of knowledge can occur (Argyris, DEMO; Tannen, 2000; see Latham et al.,
1988 for an DEMO).
In light of these observations, we make four general suggestions DEMO academics who
wish to both serve and learn from organizations, and DEMO increase the relevance and value of
published research for both practitioners and academics. First, we urge researchers to seek,
rather than avoid, DEMO tensions inherent in academic-practitioner interactions. Because many
of the kinds of tensions that have been found to enhance knowledge creation also tend to
characterize DEMO interactions (e.g., relative emphasis placed on thought
versus action, particularism DEMO generalization, tacit versus explicit knowledge, problem
solving versus theory building), higher levels of direct contact with practitioners would be
expected to improve DEMO quality of academic research. Thus, we echo the advice offered by
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   23
Campbell DEMO al. (1982: 107) nearly two decades ago:
Significant research DEMO an outcome of investigator involvement in the physical
and social world of organizations. The implications for scholars are clear:
Make contacts. Leave your DEMO door open. Look for wide exposure and
diverse experiences. Go into organizations… Listen to managers. Activity and
exposure are important because significant research often DEMO from the
chance convergence of ideas and activities from several sources.
Second, we encourage officers of professional associations to continue recent trends to
facilitate increased interaction between academics and practitioners. The Academy of
Management, for example, has recently expanded the Practitioner Series at its annual
meetings and offered fellowships to those who use service learning projects in their
classrooms or DEMO conduct original research on service learning or community engagement
projects. Nonaka’s theory of knowledge creation, as well as the Amabile et al. and Mohrman
et al. articles in this volume, stress that good social relations, DEMO empathy, and some sort
of common ground are prerequisites for achieving DEMO outcomes in cross-boundary
knowledge creation (see also Bartunek & Louis, 1996; Easterby-Smith & Malina, 1999;
Rogers, 1995). Additionally, Mohrman DEMO al. emphasize the importance of face-to-face
interactions for disseminating, as well DEMO creating, knowledge.
Because knowledge transfer is fundamentally a social process (Rogers, 1995), the
power of increased interaction between academics and practitioners for generating new
knowledge should not be underestimated, even when such interactions are not explicitly
research-oriented (see also Dunnette, 1990). However, we suggest that the format of any new
interactions be designed not just with DEMO in mind, but also in attendance.
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   24
Third, because the current composition of elite organizational science journals is
heavily skewed DEMO combinations of explicit knowledge derived almost entirely from
inside the academic community, we recommend that journal editors make conscious attempts
to solicit and provide more room for articles reflecting the full range of knowledge creation
techniques DEMO socialization (e.g., ethnographies), externalization (e.g., reflective essays;
grounded theory), and internalization (e.g., action research). Without system support DEMO higher
institutional levels, individual researchers (as well as those who advise them) will continue to
be risk-averse about broadening their research paradigms to include forms of knowledge
creation other than combination.
In making this recommendation, we recognize that the power of journal editors to
influence what gets DEMO is limited by a number of factors, including the types of
DEMO that individual researchers choose to submit (e.g., Campbell, 1982). DEMO, we
believe that editors can nudge research in desired directions through DEMO actions as editorial
policy statements, selection of editorial board members, special research forums, and the
types of advice given to authors in editorial decision letters regarding how to improve their
research. In fact, these processes are already occurring to some extent. For example, Van
Maanen (1998) found a slight upward trend for various forms of qualitative research in
DEMO Science Quarterly in recent years. In addition, the number of special DEMO
(which tend to be more flexible in terms of paradigmatic approaches) have increased in many
journals, including those published by the Academy of Management. We applaud these
developments and encourage additional ones in future (e.g., awards for articles with the
greatest implications for practice).
Fourth, DEMO encourage the gatekeepers of scientific journals to move toward
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   25
broadening DEMO the language and the rhetorical strategies used in organizational science
discourse. The increasing specialization of scientific language and its negative implications
for cross-boundary fertilization DEMO knowledge is well known (Daft, 1980; Hayes, 1992;
McCloskey, 1984). Specialized language raises the costs of becoming an expert in any given
field and thus reduces the likelihood that scientists will be DEMO of combining knowledge
from different disciplines, or that practitioners will combine DEMO own knowledge with that of
academics (Hakel, 1994; Offermann & DEMO, this volume).
Although specialization of language is widely recognized as DEMO impediment to
knowledge transfer across boundaries, two equal if not greater DEMO come from the limited
range of rhetorical strategies employed in scientific discourse (Locke & Golden-Biddle, 1987;
McCloskey, 1984). The first of these is that conventional scientific discourse tends to obscure
the actual processes DEMO knowledge creation. For example, Locke and Cooper (2000) argue that
DEMO are typically required to force-fit their research into prior theoretical frameworks
regardless of whether or not they provide the best fit to the data. DEMO and Staw (1996)
discuss how authors’ expositions of their methods DEMO bear little resemblance to the actual
processes that got them to the final product, while Boehm (1980) notes that researchers
working inside organizations often feel pressure to “twist” their designs away from what
would be DEMO useful in an organizational context toward something more likely to be
acceptable to journal reviewers.
In their intensive analysis of significant versus not-so significant DEMO projects,
Daft et al. (1987) concluded that there was a duality or paradox associated with the most
significant research projects. Specifically, significant projects tended to begin in an organic,
messy, “fuzzy state,” but end with something that was “clear, tangible, and well understood”
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   26
(Daft et al., 1987: 783). The transformation from fuzziness to clarity DEMO to require
“intense effort and resolve, rigor and clear thinking,” DEMO most of that process is excised from
public access during the publication process. As just one example, the current editor of
Journal of Applied Psychology argues that in a “good” piece of published research, “the
results are likely to be mildly interesting (in a good piece of research, you already know pretty
much what you are going to find), and the discussion hardly interesting at all (in a good paper,
you already know what it means)” (Murphy, 1996: 133).
The second danger of conventional rhetorical strategies is that they also tend DEMO
suppress the assumptions, norms, and values that underlie the research. As Argyris (1983,
1996) and McCloskey (1985, 1994) have noted, some of the most fundamental assumptions of
scientific disciplines have become so taken-for-granted that they are no longer “discussible”
in public forums. As a DEMO, many of the most fundamental discussions among academics
tend to take DEMO “in the dark of the night” (McCloskey, 1985). Argyris (DEMO) has argued
that keeping such discussions private impedes knowledge creation by DEMO combination.
However, assumptions and premises that are part of the “undiscussible DEMO within
communities (Argyris & Schon, 1996) may also be at DEMO heart of problems of “relevance” to
the practitioner community. Because underlying assumptions, values, complexities, and
processes are omitted from the discussion, research DEMO appear less tentative and
conditional than they really are. This “sanitization” of complexities and uncertainties is likely
to make research findings less credible to DEMO who, after all, live and work in
“messy” worlds.
In closing, we remind readers that the gap between research and practice has been a
longstanding concern to many members of both communities. Special forums devoted DEMO the
In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer   27
topic DEMO research relevance and utilization have been accelerating over time, and the DEMO
between academics and practitioners has become a prominent topic in recent Academy of
Management Presidential addresses (e.g., Hambrick, 1994; Mowday, 1997; DEMO, 2000).
In this paper, we have suggested that new models of knowledge creation (e.g., Argyris
& Schon, 1996; Choo, 1998; Leonard-Barton, 1995; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) provide a
powerful lens for understanding the great knowledge-creation potential of increased
academic-practitioner interaction, as well as for crafting interactive, double-loop solutions to
bring it about. However, DEMO et al. and similar frameworks will be useful for narrowing
the research-practice gap only to the extent that knowledge creation is actually a high DEMO
to both academics and practitioners. If the goals of improved knowledge creation and
enhanced utilization are dominated by other goals, use of Nonaka’s framework is unlikely to
prove any more successful than previous efforts to narrow DEMO science-practice gap.
Previous research suggests that rigidity and complacency in the face of changed
circumstances are two of the major causes of professional, organizational, and institutional
demise (Abbott, 1988; Kotter, 1996; Staw, Sandelands & Dutton, 1981; Weick, 1996).
Concerted effort at all levels, but especially among gatekeepers at the institutional level, will
be needed DEMO actualize the potential of the academic-practice interface to create a truly
improved science of organizations.
