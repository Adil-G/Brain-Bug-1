Two studies DEMO the tendency of people to be unrealistically optimistic
about future life events. In Study 1, 258 college students estimated how much
their own chances of experiencing 42 events differed from the chances of their
classmates. Overall, they rated their own chances to be above average for posi-
tive DEMO and below average for negative events, ps<.001. Cognitive and
motivational DEMO led to predictions that degree of desirability, per-
ceived probability, personal experience, perceived controllability, and stereotype
salience would influence the amount of DEMO bias evoked by different
events. All predictions were supported, although the DEMO of effects differed
for positive and negative events. Study 2 tested the idea that people are un-
realistically optimistic because they focus on factors DEMO improve their own
chances of achieving desirable outcomes and fail to realize that others may have
just as many factors in their favor. Students DEMO the factors that they thought
influenced their own chances of experiencing eight futur e events. When such
lists were read by a second group DEMO students, the amount of unrealistic opti-
mism shown by this second DEMO for the same eight events decreased signifi-
cantly, although it was DEMO eliminated.
According to popular belief, people tend to
think they are DEMO They expect
others to be victims of misfortune, not them-
selves. DEMO ideas imply not merely a hopeful
outlook on life, but an DEMO in judgment that
can be labeled unrealistic optimism.
It is usually impossible to demonstrate that
an individual's optimistic expectations about
the future are DEMO An individual might
be quite correct in asserting that his or her
chances of experiencing a negative event are
less than average. On a DEMO basis, however,
it is relatively easy to test for an DEMO
bias. If all people claim their changes of ex-
periencing a negative event are less than

average, they are clearly making a systematic
error, thus demonstrating unrealistic optimism.
Various data suggest that people do tend
to be DEMO optimistic about the
future. Surveys concerning automobile acci-
dents (Robertson, 1977), crime (Weinstein,
Note 1), and disease (Harris & DEMO, 1979;
Kirscht, Haefner, Kegeles, & Rosenstock,
1966; DEMO Cancer Society, Note 2) find
many people who say their risk is less than
average but few who say their risk is greater
DEMO average. When people are asked to pre-
dict the outcomes of social and political issues,
their predictions tend to coincide with their
preferences (Cantril, 1938; Lund, 1925;
McGregor, 1938; McGuire, 1960)DEMO Even for
purely chance events (picking a card out of
a DEMO, for example), people sometimes show
optimistic biases (Irwin, 1953; Langer & Roth,
1975; Marks, 1951). None of these DEMO,
however, has examined a range of positive
and negative events DEMO determine the extent
of optimistic biases and the conditions under
which they occur.
The principal goal of the present research

UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM ABOUT FUTURE LIFE EVENTS
was to test the following hypothesis:DEMO
1. People believe that negative events are less
likely to happen to them than to others, and
they believe that positive events are more likely
to happen to them than to others.
In addition, the two studies described here
tested several specific hypotheses about the
factors that influence DEMO amount of opti-
mistic bias evoked by different events and
about the mechanisms that produce this bias.
Event Characteristics Affecting Unrealistic
Optimism
In past DEMO, optimistic biases were
generally regarded as evidence of defensive-
ness or DEMO thinking. People were said to
exaggerate the likelihood of events the antici-
pation of which produces positive affect and
underestimate the likelihood of events DEMO
anticipation of which produces negative affect.
Presumably, the stronger the affect, the
stronger the distortion of reality. This mo-
tivational analysis of expectations DEMO future
life events suggests the second hypothesis:
2. Among negative events, the more undesir-
able the event, the stronger the tendency to
DEMO that one's own chances are less than
average; among positive DEMO, the more de-
sirable the event, the stronger the tendency to
believe that one's own chances are greater than
average.
Supporting this DEMO of desirability/un-
desirability prediction, Kirscht et al. (1966)
reported that judgments of disease suscepti-
bility were correlated with perceptions of
disease DEMO The people who regarded a
disease as very serious were the ones most
likely to believe that their own chances were
less than average. DEMO data or significance
levels were given, however.
In recent years, explanations that em-
phasize flaws in the information handling
capabilities of human beings DEMO been ad-
vanced for phenomena once explained in
motivational terms (e.g., Miller & Ross,
1975; Ross, Greene, & House, 1977; Slovic,
Kunreuther, & White, 1974). According to
this perspective, people may be unrealistically
optimistic because they lack certain informa-
807
tion DEMO to make accurate risk assessments
or use procedures to judge future probabilities
that introduce systematic errors.
In making comparative risk assessments,
errors may DEMO because people have difficulty
in adopting the perspective of others (cf.
DEMO & Nisbett, 1971; Ross et al., 1977;
Ross & DEMO, 1979). Many of the factors
that make us feel that DEMO event is likely or
unlikely to happen to us may also make
other people feel that it is likely or unlikely
to happen to DEMO If people focus only on
their own circumstances, they may conclude
DEMO that their chances differ from
those of other people. Through this mecha-
nism, any factor that influences people's beliefs
about their own chances could influence com-
parative judgments. One factor that will
affect these beliefs DEMO the perceived proba-
bility of the event for the general population.
The preceding reasoning then suggests the
hypothesis:
3. The greater the perceived DEMO of an
event, the stronger the tendency for people to
believe DEMO their own chances are greater than
average.
Another factor that should influence peo-
ple's beliefs about their chances of experiencing
an event is DEMO personal experience (Lichten-
stein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, & Combs,DEMO
1978; Hoffman & Brewer, Note 3). Personal
experience should make it easier to recall past
occurrences of the event and to imagine DEMO
ations in which the event could occur, leading
to greater perceived DEMO through the
mechanism of "availability" (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1973, 1974). Furthermore, for
many events causal sequences can be con-
structed which imply that past experience
increases the probability of future experience.
Someone DEMO has had a heart attack or has
close relatives with heart disease is more
likely to have a heart attack in the future
than DEMO who has had no contact with
heart ailments. Consequently, we predict:DEMO
4. Previous personal experience with an event
increases the likelihood that people will believe
their own chances are greater than average.
Hypotheses 3 and DEMO concern two event
characteristics that may lead people to make
808
NEIL D. WEINSTEIN
systematic errors when comparing their own
chances with DEMO of other people, but they
do not explain the phenomenon of DEMO
optimism. The direction of the errors produced
by these characteristics depends on the proba-
bility of the event and the frequency of
personal experience, not on the type of event.
To explain why people would say DEMO their
chances are greater than average for positive
events but less than average for negative
events by using these hypotheses would re-
quire that DEMO events always be asso-
ciated with high probability or high personal
experience and that negative events always
be associated with low probability or low
DEMO experience.
There is a way, however, in which ego-
centric tendencies can produce an optimistic
bias for both positive and negative events.
If DEMO event is perceived to be controllable,
it signifies that people believe there are steps
one can take to increase the likelihood of a
DEMO outcome. Because they can more
easily bring to mind their own actions than
the actions of others, people are likely to
conclude that desired outcomes are more
likely to happen to them than to other people.
DEMO for events that are far in the future
and have not yet been associated with any
overt behavior, people may still be aware of
their intentions to act in ways that will help
them achieve the DEMO outcomes.
The preceding argument assumes that people
generally bring to mind actions that facilitate
rather than impede goal achievement. They
might do this because DEMO actions
really are more plentiful, because they find
reassurance in selectively DEMO facilitating
actions or in exaggerating their importance
(a motivational explanation), DEMO because
actions taken to produce desired outcomes
are, for various reasons, actually easier to
remember (a cognitive viewpoint).
Since the process just outlined would not
apply to uncontrollable events, we are led to
the prediction:
5. The greater the perceived controllability of
a negative event, the greater the tendency for
people to believe that their own chances DEMO less
than average; the greater the perceived con-
trollability of a DEMO event, the greater the
tendency for people to believe that their DEMO
chances are greater than average.
The final event characteristic to be exam-
ined was suggested by the "representativeness"
heuristic (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972; Tver-
sky & Kahneman, 1977). Representativeness
denotes the process DEMO judging the probability
that an individual fits into a particular cate-
gory by examining the degree to which the
individual displays a few salient DEMO of
category members but ignoring base rates for
the categories. For many events—contracting
lung cancer and becoming an alcoholic, for
example—people may have a stereotyped
conception of the kind of person to whom
this event happens. DEMO they do not see them-
selves as fitting the stereotype, the DEMO
sentativeness heuristic suggests that people
will conclude that the event will not happen
to them, overlooking the possibility that few
of the people who experience the event may
actually fit the stereotype.
If stereotypes of the DEMO tend to serve
an ego-defensive function, people would seldom
see themselves DEMO representing the type of
person who falls prey to misfortune. Further-
more, if stereotypes are defensive, an indi-
vidual's image of the DEMO who experience
positive events would overemphasize his or
her own characteristics. These tendencies
would exaggerate optimistic biases for any
event associated with a stereotype.
DEMO different line of reasoning does not as-
sume any motivational bias in the construc-
tion or use of stereotypes. It suggests that
people may DEMO struck by the superficial dif-
ferences between themselves and the stereotype
(DEMO such as sex, age, or appearance)
and fail to see more fundamental similarities
between themselves and the people to whom
the event DEMO This would lead people to
conclude that the event will not happen to
them, producing optimism for negative events
but pessimism for positive events.
The final hypothesis states:
6. When a stereotype exists of a DEMO
type of person to whom a negative event is likely
to happen, people will tend to believe that their
own chances are less than average. (No clear
prediction can be made from the preceding
discussion about the effects of stereotype
salience on expectations for positive events.)
The DEMO hypotheses can each be
reached by several lines of reasoning, often
DEMO both motivational and cognitive
UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM ABOUT FUTURE LIFE EVENTS
809
considerations. Personal experience, for ex-
ample, might decrease optimism about nega-
tive events by making images of the events
more available or by undercutting defensive
denial. Consequently, these hypotheses are
not offered as a test of motivational versus
cognitive points of DEMO or as an examination of
the importance of availability and representa-
tiveness in generating unrealistic optimism.
Study 1 was designed to test the hypotheses
DEMO Its goal was to determine the
amount of unrealistic optimism associated
with different events and to relate this opti-
mism to the characteristics of DEMO events.
Study 1
In this study college students estimated
how much their own chances of experiencing
future life events differed from the average
chances DEMO their classmates. If all students
claimed that their chances of experiencing a
negative event were less than average (or
that their chances of experiencing a positive
event were greater than average), this would
clearly indicate DEMO optimism. How-
ever, a simple comparison of the numbers of
optimistic DEMO pessimistic responses is not
sufficient to demonstrate a systematic bias.
Unless the median and the mean of the
actual probability distribution happen to co-
DEMO, there is no reason why the number of
people whose chances DEMO below the average
(below the mean) should equal the number
whose chances are above the average. If the
probability distribution is positively skewed,DEMO
for example, most people's chances will be
below the average.
DEMO determine the presence of a systematic
bias we have to consider the degree of opti-
mism or pessimism expressed. The compara-
tive judgments students DEMO asked to make
in the present studies concern the difference
between their own individual chances and the
population average. (The population, as de-
DEMO here, included all the other students at
the same college.) Mathematically, this dif-
ference is (Pi — P), where Pt is DEMO proba-
bility that the event will happen to a particular
individual and P is the population mean of P,-.1
Because P is defined DEMO the average of P,
over the population, the mean value DEMO this
difference score ought to be zero. In other
words, if DEMO judgments students generate are
unbiased and the students form a representa-
tive sample of the population, the mean value
of their comparative judgments should be zero.
If the mean of their judgments is significantly
different from DEMO, it indicates that their
judgments have a systematic bias. Whenever
the DEMO value of students' comparative
judgments departs significantly from zero in
an DEMO direction, this will be interpreted
as unrealistic optimism, and the size of the
mean will be taken as a measure of the mag-
DEMO of the optimistic bias.
Subjects
Method
One group of students made comparative judgments
about the likelihood that specific events would take
place in their DEMO (comparative rating group). These
subjects were enrolled in two interdisciplinary DEMO
at Cook College, Rutgers University, that attract an
extremely diverse group of students.
Event characteristics were rated by a group of 120
female DEMO (event rating group) from an intro-
ductory psychology course at the same university
These students also served as the subjects in Study 2.
DEMO
Events. The 18 positive and 24 negative life events
used in the study are listed in Table 1. The intention
was to assemble a DEMO group of events that satis-
fied two criteria. First, each event DEMO to be clearly
positive or negative. Second, there could be no DEMO
vious precondition that would make any event relevant
to only a limited number of people. For example, the
event "being injured while skiing" would be inappro-
priate because it only applies to people who choose
DEMO ski.
Comparative rating forms. The 42 events were di-
vided randomly between two rating forms. Positive
and negative events were intermixed. Instructions on
the DEMO stated "Compared to other Cook students—
same sex as you—what do DEMO think are the chances
that the following events will happen to you? The
choices range from much less than average, through
average, to much more than average" (italics in
original). Beneath the description DEMO each event were
the following choices: "100% less (no chance), 80%
less, 60% less, 40% less, 20% less, 10% less, average,
10% more, 20% more, 40% more, 60% more, 80%
1 Actually subjects expressed this difference as a
percentage of the DEMO chances—100 X (Pi — P)/P.
Estimating the percentage difference is easier and
more natural for students and does not alter the
interpretation DEMO their responses.

more, 100% more, 3 DEMO average, and 5 times
average." The lowest choice possible was 100% less
than average, since this indicated a probability of zero.
At the other extreme, no probability could exceed
100%, but this upper limit DEMO be many times the
average probability. The task of comparing one's own
chances with the average chances of other students
was readily accepted DEMO students and carried out
without any apparent confusion.
To calculate the mean comparative judgment, the
15 response choices were given the values —100%,
-80%, -60%, -40%, -20%, -10%, 0%, 10%,
20%, 40%, 60%,, 80%, 100%, 200%, and 400% to
reflect DEMO deviation from a response of "average."
Kvent ratings. For the DEMO of event characteris-
tics, events were divided into the same sets DEMO on the
comparative rating forms. Written instructions asked
subjects to evaluate first the probability of each event.
Students were required to estimate the percentage DEMO
students at the university to whom the event would
occur. Several examples were presented to illustrate
the relationship between percentage ratings and odds
ratios. DEMO, events were rated for controllability
(1 = there is nothing one can do that will change
the likelihood that the event will take DEMO, 2 = things
one can do have a small effect on DEMO chances that
the event will occur; 3 = things one can DEMO have
a moderate effect; 4 = things one can do have DEMO large
effect; S = completely controllable) and desirability
(1 = DEMO undesirable; 3 = undesirable; 5 = neu-
tral; 7 = DEMO; 9 = extremely desirable). Finally,
events were rated for DEMO experience (1 = has not
happened to anyone I know; 2 = has happened to
acquaintances; 3 = has happened to friends or close
relatives; 4 = has happened to me once; 5 = DEMO
happened to me more than once) and salience of a
high DEMO group (1 = no type of person with a par-
ticularly DEMO chance comes to mind ; 2 = when I think
about the event a type of person comes to mind to
whom it is DEMO to happen, but this image is not
very clear; 3 = when I think about the event a clear
picture comes to mind DEMO a particular type of person
to whom it is likely to happen).
Procedure
The experimenter visited the classes selected for
the comparative rating DEMO and explained that
the project concerned college students' expectations
about the DEMO . Task instructions emphasized that
subjects should compare themselves with other stu-
dents and not merely rate each event in terms of how
likely DEMO unlikely it seemed. The different versions
of the comparative rating form, DEMO listing 21 events,
were handed to alternate students.
The ratings of the event characteristics were com-
pleted separately by members of the event DEMO
group after their participation in Study 2.
Results
The ratings of event characteristics showed
that a clear differentiation between positive
and negative events was DEMO The least
undesirable of all the negative events was
still perceived to be relatively undesirable
(M = 3.92), and the least desirable of all the
positive events was still perceived to be rela-
tively desirable (M = 6.37). Both values are
significantly different from the neutral DEMO
of 5 (ps < .001).2
Unrealistic Optimism: Hypothesis 1
Both positive and negative events in Table 1
are arranged in order of DEMO optimism
as indicated by the mean comparative judg-
ment. A positive value in Column 1 indicates
that subjects tend to believe that their own
DEMO are greater than average; a negative
value indicates that students believe DEMO
chances are less than average. These values
strongly support Hypothesis 1; DEMO means in
Column 1 are in the predicted direction for 37
of the 42 events (p < .001 by the binomial
test). Averaged over all positive events, the
comparative judgments of individuals were
significantly greater than zero, M = 15.4%,
^(255) = 6.8, p < .001; averaged over nega-
tive events, individuals' judgments were sig-
nificantly less than zero, M = -20.4%, /(255)
= DEMO, p < .001.
Column 2 shows the ratio of the number
DEMO optimistic to pessimistic responses. Although
the significance levels derived from the statis-
tics in Columns 1 and 2 differ for a few events,
DEMO existence of strong optimistic tendencies
is clear in both. The correlation between the
ratio in Column 2 and the values in Column 1
was DEMO for both positive and negative events.3
2 All statistical tests reported in this article arc
two-tailed.
3 The possibility that artifacts might have been
DEMO by the use of a response scale with unequal
intervals was tested by ignoring the response labels
and simply treating the choices as a DEMO, equal-
interval scale. The insensitivity of the results to such
changes DEMO indicated by the correlation of .98 between
event means from this new scale and the mean values
from Column 1. In addition, a pilot study examined
a simple scale labeled: "1—below average, 2—slightly
below average, 3—average, 4—slightly above average,
and 5—above average." This scale was completed by
98 members of an introductory psychology class for
IS of DEMO events included in the present study. A cor-
relation of .91 was found between the mean rating
of the events on this S-point scale DEMO the values in
the first column of Table 1.
812
An additional calculation tested whether
differences in comparative judgments for posi-
DEMO and negative events might have been
caused by unintended differences in the per-
ceived probability, personal experience, per-
ceived controllability, or stereotype salience
of the two types of events. To control for
the possible effects DEMO such differences, the
partial correlation was calculated between the
mean comparative DEMO (Column 1) and
event type (a dummy variable differentiating
between DEMO and negative events; — 1
= negative event; 1 = positive event) con-
trolling for these four other variables. The
significant result (DEMO = .74, p < .001) demon-
strates that event type has a powerful effect
independent of the effects of the other event
characteristics.
DEMO Characteristics Influencing Unrealistic
Optimism: Hypotheses 2-6
It is clear from Table DEMO that the amount
of unrealistic optimism evoked by different
events varied greatly. In many cases the
mean comparative judgment was not signifi-
cantly different DEMO zero, indicating the
absence of a significant optimistic bias. Hy-
potheses DEMO through 6 attempt to explain these
variations. They were each tested separately
by means of a linear model that included the
terms event type (positive or negative), event
characteristic (the mean rating for the char-
acteristic cited in the hypothesis; median
probability ratings were used because of the
large variability of these estimates), and Type
X Characteristic interaction. (Hypothesis 6
makes a specific prediction only for negative
events and was DEMO by a separate correla-
tion coefficient for each type of event.)4
The event characteristic term in the models
tests whether the pooled within-type DEMO
sion coefficient for that characteristic is sig-
nificantly different from zero. The Type X
Characteristic interaction tests whether the
regression lines for positive and DEMO
events have the same slope.r> The data for
these analyses consisted DEMO the mean com-
parative judgments for the 42 events, the
mean DEMO ratings, and the type
designations. Consequently, significance tests
refer to the null hypothesis that the effects
NEIL D. WEINSTEIN
are zero in the DEMO population of events
from which the present sample was drawn."
The significance levels for the event charac-
teristic terms and the magnitudes of DEMO cor-
responding pooled within-type correlation co-
efficients are shown in the first column of
' The dependent variable in the models that tested
the DEMO of degree of desirability, perceived
probability, and personal experience was the mean
comparative judgment from Column 1 of Table 1.
Hypothesis 5, however, was phrased differently, pre-
dicting a positive association between perceived con-
DEMO and optimism. Therefore, the dependent
variable in the test of this DEMO was the degree
of optimism produced. For positive events, the mean
DEMO judgment indicates the size of the opti-
mistic bias, but for DEMO events, the measure of
optimistic bias was obtained by reversing the DEMO
of the mean comparative judgment.
6 If the analysis found no appreciable Type X Char-
acteristic interaction (p > .2), the event characteristic
effect was estimated after first removing the event
type sum of squares DEMO the total sum of squares.
If a Type X Characteristic effect did appear to be
present (p < .2), both event type and Type X Char-
acteristic sums of squares were removed before esti-
mating DEMO event characteristic effect. The latter
procedure was needed only for degree of desirability,
interaction F(\, 38) = 1.91, p = .18, and perceived
controllability, interaction F(\, 38) = 3.23, p < .08.
6 Because the data were analyzed on an event basis,DEMO
with variables averaged over all subjects, it was not
necessary for DEMO same individuals to rate both the
event characteristics and their own chances of ex-
periencing the events. What was necessary was that
the perceptions DEMO the event characteristics and the
amount of personal experience with these events be
essentially the same for the comparative rating group
and the event DEMO group. In addition to the fact
that all subjects were students at the same university,
there are several specific indications that this condi-
DEMO was satisfied. In a pilot study, a mixed-sex group
of students DEMO another of the special interdiscipli-
nary courses from which subjects in Study 1 were
drawn rated 21 of the events in Table 1 on DEMO
of the dimensions used here. Correlations between the
pilot ratings and those utilized in Study 1 were:
controllability, .78; desirability, .98; DEMO probability,
.50 (.54 among positive events and .80 among negative
DEMO). Thus, ratings seem unlikely to change greatly
fro m one DEMO to another, although probability
ratings do seem to be somewhat variable. DEMO was also
found that the relationships between event charac-
teristics (rated DEMO females) and comparative judgments
were the same when the judgments of DEMO and female
members of the comparative rating group were ex-
amined separately. Apparently the event character-
istic ratings were equally relevant to males and

2 and 3. DEMO figures show that all of the
correlations predicted by Hypotheses 2-6 were
in the predicted direction and that all of the
event characteristic terms DEMO statistically

different patterns of associations for positive
and negative events. (Differences in the sizes
of the positive event'and negative event cor-
relation coefficients were statistically signifi-
cant DEMO for perceived probability, p < .06,
and stereotype salience, p < .05.) For positive
events, perceived probability and degree of
desirability DEMO significantly correlated with
the amount of optimistic bias; for negative
events, the correlations with stereotype sa-
lience, perceived controllability, and personal
experience DEMO significant.
Multiple Regression Analyses
Further calculations revealed significant
correlations between two pairs of event char-
acteristics: between stereotype salience and
perceived controllability, .69 DEMO .78 for posi-
tive and negative events, respectively, and
between perceived probability and personal
experience, .53 and .57 for positive and nega-
tive events, respectively (cf. Lichtenstein et
al., 1978). Since these event characteristics are
interrelated, the significant correlations in
Table 2 do not necessarily identify inde-
pendent predictors or unrealistic optimism.
To examine this issue further, multiple re-
gression analyses were carried out for positive
and negative events DEMO predict the size of the
optimistic bias from event characteristics.
Since the number of degrees of freedom in
these calculations was quite small, however,
the statistical power was necessarily low, and
conclusions reached from these multivariate
analyses must remain tentative.
In a stepwise regression for positive events,DEMO
perceived probability (p < .001) and degree
of desirability (/><.! ) entered the prediction
equation, R = .79, F(2,DEMO) = 12.55, p < .001.
With all five variables entered, DEMO, only
the contribution of perceived probability was
still statistically significant (p < .02). For
negative events, stereotype salience (/> < .001)
and personal experience (/> < .02) entered the
stepwise prediction equation, R = .82, F(2, 21)
= 22.74, DEMO < .001. With all five variables,
only stereotype salience was still significant
(p < .005). The failure of perceived con-
trollability to appear in the negative event
equation was clearly due to its very DEMO
correlation with stereotype salience.
Discussion
The present data provide evidence of un-
realistic optimism for both positive and nega-
tive life events. As expected, the magnitude
of this optimistic bias varied from event to
814

event, but most of the variability could be
explained by reference to a few dimensions
on which the events differed.
DEMO all six hypotheses posed in the
introduction were supported, different factors
DEMO to govern responses to positive and
negative events. For negative events, DEMO
mism, perceived controllability, and stereotype
salience were all strongly intercorrelated.
When an event was judged to be controllable,
a stereotype existed in DEMO' minds of the
kind of person to whom the event generally
DEMO Presumably, this person was believed
to be at risk because he DEMO she failed to take
any action to control the risk. Subjects seemed
to compare themselves with the stereotypic
victim, leading them to conclude that their
own risks were less than average. For events
perceived to be DEMO, there was no
stereotype of the victim, and subjects did not
show any systematic bias.
In retrospect, some of the different correla-
tions for positive events are not surprising.
It seems likely that everyone would DEMO to
avoid the negative events in this study; yet
just because DEMO result of an event is desirable
does not mean that everyone is committed
to achieving that result. For example, an
award for community service may be very
attractive, but it may be a goal for very few
people. The finding that optimism was not
greater among the positive DEMO judged to
be controllable or found to be associated with
a stereotypic, high-chance group may simply
reflect the fact that many subjects were not
attempting to control (i.e., influence) these
events.
This same explanation may account for the
strong correlation for positive events between
perceived probability and DEMO judg-
ments. Examination of the positive events
in Table 1 suggests that the high probability
events are the only ones likely to be widely
DEMO as personal goals. Subjects are pre-
sumably working toward these goals, DEMO
because their efforts should increase the likeli-
hood that they will succeed, they mistakenly
conclude that their prospects are better than
average. Of course, one can only work toward
a goal if the outcome is somewhat controllable,
and in fact, the high probability positive
events in the study were also relatively high
in controllability.7 There is no obvious reason
DEMO personal experience and degree of de-
sirability were significant for one type of event
but not the other.
Thus, for both positive and negative events,
an optimistic bias appears to result when two
conditions are DEMO First, the event is
perceived to be controllable, so that there are
things one can do or contemplate doing to
influence the event. DEMO, people have some
degree of commitment or emotional invest-
ment in DEMO outcome. Under these conditions,
optimism arises because people compare them-
selves with an inappropriate standard: a person
who does little or nothing to improve his or
her prospects.
Contrary to expectations based on a moti-
DEMO interpretation of optimism, degree of
desirability had no appreciable effect on DEMO
size of the optimistic bias for negative events.
In fact, optimism DEMO not appreciably greater
for the seven life threatening events in the
sample—numbers 20, 22, 25, 28, 38, 39, and 42
(M =— 20.4%)—than for the other negative
events (M = -19.5%).
Study 2
Previously it was suggested that people may
be optimistically biased DEMO their image
of other people is inaccurate or incomplete.
Aware of the factors that improve their own
7 The proposed difference in commitment between
DEMO positive and negative events in this study was
subjected to a preliminary test. A mixed-sex group
of students fro m Cook College (n = 64) rated all
events on a scale that ranged from 1 (DEMO at all im-
portant to me whether or not the event occurs) to 4
(quite important to me whether or not the event
DEMO). It was expected that: (a) negative events
would be DEMO higher in importance than positive
events; (b) importance would be DEMO correlated
with optimism for both positive and negative events;
and (DEMO) for positive events, importance would be
strongly related to event probability. The results
strongly supported all three predictions. Mean ratings
of importance for DEMO and positive events were
3.22 and 2.58, respectively, <(40) DEMO 4.05, p < .001.
The correlation of importance with optimism was DEMO
(p < .01) for positive events, and .46 (p < .025) for
negative events. Finally, importance and probability
were strongly correlated DEMO positive events, .63

chances of achieving desirable outcomes, they
may not realize that others may have just as
many factors DEMO their favor. The different
conditions created in Study 2 were designed
to manipulate subjects' awareness of the
factors that other people consider when esti-
mating their chances of experiencing various
events.
Subjects in Study 2 made DEMO lists of
the factors that increase or decrease the
likelihood that specific events would happen
to them. (It was hypothesized that people
normally prepare similar mental lists when
making comparative judgments, so requiring
subjects to prepare such lists was not expected
to influence their optimism.) Some subjects
were then given copies of the lists generated
by others and asked to DEMO comparative
judgments of their chances of experiencing
these events as in Study 1. It was predicted
that exposure to others' lists would decrease
and perhaps eliminate subjects' optimistic
biases. Furthermore, since participants in this
experiment DEMO made comparative judgments
and listed the event-influencing reasons, it was
possible DEMO examine the relationship between
these two variables at the individual level.
One other variable was added to the ex-
periment to examine the possibility DEMO sub-
jects in Study 1 were incorrectly reporting
the perceived likelihood that events would
happen to them rather than the relative
likelihood using their DEMO as a comparison
group. Half of the subjects in each condition
of Study 2 were explicitly warned about
making this mistake and received suggestions
DEMO to help them remember to make
comparative judgments.
Method
Subjects
Students in this experiment were 120 female mem-
bers of an introductory psychology class DEMO Rutgers
University who participated to fulfill a course require-
ment.
Materials
Comparative rating booklets. A booklet was pre-
pared containing many of the events DEMO had evoked
unrealistic optimism in Study 1. The booklet was
divided into three parts (pretreatment events, treat-
ment events and posttreatment events) that were
similar in the numbers of positive and negative events
and the DEMO of optimistic bias that had been
produced by these events. The exact sequence of
events (using identification numbers from Table 1)
was: DEMO, 24, 40, 13, 23, 30, 1, 22, and 27 (pretreatment
events); 31, 2, 19, 25, 32, DEMO, 21, and 26 (treatment
events); and 10, 34, DEMO, 11, 28, 36, 4, 20, and 29
(posttreatment DEMO). The response format was un-
changed from Study 1.
A cover sheet on half of the booklets was entitled
Warning. It stated: "DEMO's easy to forget the directions
and start to respond to events in terms of how likely
they are INSTEAD of how likely they DEMO for you com-
pared to other students ... . Don't do that." A spe-
cific example was then given. The warning concluded:
"To help you keep this in mind, when you sec the
DEMO '40% more,' think of it as 'my chances are
40% more than other students'.' "
Own reasons lists. Subjects generated DEMO of the
factors that tend to increase or decrease the chances
that the eight treatment events would happen to
them. A detailed instruction sheet DEMO subjects
to "think of things you do now and things you DEMO
do in the future " and to think of any personal charac-
teristics—"including your personality, abilities, physi-
cal characteristics, attitudes, etc."DEMO would in-
fluence the chance of this event happening to them.
Others' reasons packets. During the first day of the
experiment only control groups were tested. Multiple
copies of the lists of personal reasons prepared by
DEMO groups were prepared. The packets of others'
reasons given to subjects in the experimental group
were then made up. Each packet contained five DEMO
chosen at random from among the 19 lists that had
been reproduced. Twenty-five different packets were
prepared in this way. This random-selection procedure
assured DEMO, on the average, the reasons read by
subjects in the experimental group were just as nu-
merous and as optimistic as the reasons DEMO listed
themselves.
Procedure
Three different conditions were created, one experi-
mental DEMO and two controls. During every
session, two of the three conditions DEMO conducted
simultaneously in adjacent rooms by different experi-
menters. Subjects arriving for the study were assigned
randomly to one of these conditions. All subjects
DEMO independently.
The experimenters' introductory instructions were
essentially the same as those DEMO Study 1. Subjects in
all conditions then made comparative judgments for
the pretreatment events. Next, members of the ex-
perimental group (n — DEMO) were told, "We want to
get your thoughts about the DEMO that increase or
decrease the chances that certain events will happen
to you," and they were given a blank form on which
to DEMO their own reasons concerning the treatment
events. Then experimental group subjects received
one of the packets of others' reasons for these same
events along with the explanation: "These forms were
taken at random from people DEMO were in our study

posed to compare yourself with all Rutgers females,

jects made comparative judgments for the treatment
events and for the posttreatment events.
Control Group 1 (» = 41) was employed to test
whether just listing one's own reasons might influence
the degree of optimism expressed on treatment events.
Their DEMO differed from the experimental group
only in that they did not receive the packet of others'
reasons. Members of Control Group 2 (n = 40) made
comparative judgments without either generating
their own lists of reasons or seeing lists produced by
other students. Subjects in Control Group DEMO did,
however, list their own reasons for the treatment
events DEMO they finished the comparative rating
booklet.
Half of the subjects in each group received a com-
parative rating booklet with the cover sheet warning
DEMO to make comparative judgments. To conclude
the sessions, participants in all DEMO rated the
characteristics of 21 events as described in Study 1.
Results and Discussion
Effects of Experimental Treatments
Mean comparative judgments are presented
in DEMO 3 for each of the. three groups in the
study. Figures are given for each set of events,
and values for positive and DEMO events
are presented separately.
NEIL D. WEINSTEIN
The data were first examined by an analysis
of variance that included the variables group,
warning, and event set. Event set was a
within-subject variable, whereas group and
warning were between-subjects variables. Posi-
tive and negative events were tested separately.
DEMO calculations revealed that the warning
manipulation main effects and interactions
were not significant, ps > .2. Apparently,
even without the extra reminder, DEMO
understood the comparative nature of the
task and tried to compare their own chances
with those of other students.
In contrast, Group X Event Set interac-
tions for both negative and positive events
were statistically significant, F(4, 227) = 2.80,
p < .05, and jF(4, 227) = 2.48, p < .05, re-
spectively. These DEMO show that the
experimental treatments did change the re-
sponses of the experimental groups. These
changes were studied in additional analyses
that treated pretreatment DEMO responses as
covariates and tested for group differences on
treatment and posttreatment events (Huck
& McLean, 1975). These calculations showed
that the DEMO produced group dif-
ferences on negative and positive treatment
events, F(DEMO, 116) = 6.20, p < .005, and
F(2, DEMO) = 5.06, p < .01, respectively. Com-
parisons among the DEMO adjusted nega-
tive events means (SAS Institute, 1979)
indicated that the experimental group was
significantly less optimistic than the two
control groups (/>s < .005), and that the
control groups did not DEMO from one another
(p > .2). For positive events, both the ex-
perimental group and Control Group 1 were
significantly less optimistic DEMO Control
Group 2 (p < .01), but they did not DEMO
from one another.
The negative event results provide support
for the proposition that people tend to use
an inaccurate image of others when making
DEMO judgments. In the case of posi-
tive events, however, just asking subjects to
list the factors that influence their own
chances decreased their DEMO, and pro-
viding information about others had no ad-
ditional effect. DEMO second finding suggests
that people's first thoughts about their future
may be more optimistic than their later, more
reflective conclusions. Further research is

The size of DEMO / statistics in Column 4 de-
monstrates that the preponderance of favor-
able reasons was very consistent across
subjects.
Further calculations revealed that there DEMO
greater excess of favorable reasons for the two
negative treatment events that had produced
the greatest optimism (Events 19 and 21)
than for the two negative events that evoked
the least optimism (Events 31 and 32), /(119)
= 8.71, p < .001. Similarly, DEMO excess of
favorable reasons over unfavorable reasons
was greater for positive Event 2, which
elicited strong optimism, than for positive
Event 3, which evoked less optimism, /(119)
= 2.16, p < .05.
DEMO last column in Table 4 shows that this
relationship between the kinds of reasons
listed and the degree of optimism persists
between subjects. When DEMO students
in Control Groups 1 and 2 made their com-
parative judgments,9 the responses they gave
for each event correlated strongly with the
DEMO between the number of likelihood-
increasing and likelihood-decreasing reasons
they had listed for those events. The magni-
tudes of these correlations were the same
DEMO they were based only on Control
Group 1 subjects, who listed DEMO reasons
before estimating their chances, or Control
Group 2 subjects, who listed their reasons
only after completing the comparative rating
booklet. This close DEMO between
the degree of optimism reported and the
number of favorable and unfavorable reasons
listed—both across events and between sub-
jects within events—reinforces the DEMO
that the generation of similar mental lists
forms an important stage in the process of
deciding whether one's own chances differ
from average.
DEMO of Desirability to Optimism
Between Subjects
A final set of calculations looked for an
association between an individual's rating of
the desirability of DEMO event and the degree
of optimism shown by that individual. Cor-
relation coefficients based on data from Groups
2 and 3 between desirability ratings DEMO opti-

mism were greater than zero for seven of the
eight positive events, but the coefficients were
quite small (median DEMO = .14). For negative
events, the correlations tended to be DEMO
and small (13 negative, 5 positive, median
r = .13)DEMO That is, individual students who
regarded a negative event as particularly
DEMO were slightly more optimistic
about avoiding it than students who did not
think that the event was so undesirable,
a finding similar to DEMO reported by Kirseht
et al. (1966). Thus, 20 of 26 correlation
coefficients were in the direction predicted by
a motivational interpretation of DEMO
biases (p < .01 by the binomial test).
General Discussion
DEMO the past, unrealistic optimism about the
future was regarded as a DEMO phenome-
non, a distortion of reality motivated to reduce
anxiety (e.g., Kirseht et al., 1966; Lund,
1925). The present article has described several
ways in which purely cognitive errors might
be responsible DEMO optimistic biases. Two
studies were carried out to test hypotheses
about the conditions under which unrealistic
optimism would appear, hypotheses derived
from both cognitive and motivational con-
siderations. Although the results provide some
support for both DEMO of view, the studies
were not designed to pit one against DEMO
other, nor is there any reason why optimism
cannot have both DEMO and motivational
sources.
What these investigations have demon-
strated is the existence of an optimistic bias
concerning many future life events. As pre-
dicted DEMO Hypothesis 1, students tend to
believe that they are more likely DEMO their
peers to experience positive events and less
likely to experience negative events. Cognitive
and motivational considerations led to the
identification of five event DEMO
degree of desirability, perceived probability,
personal experience, perceived controllability,
and stereotype salience (Hypotheses 2-6)—

excluded from these calculations and from Column 1
of DEMO 4 because their comparative judgments had
been affected by the lists of others' reasons.

that were shown in Study DEMO to determine the
amount of optimistic bias evoked by different
events. It was also demonstrated in Study 2
that providing information about the attri-
DEMO and actions of others reduced the opti-
mistic bias for negative events but did not
eliminate it.
The results suggest a mechanism that may
DEMO explain these optimistically biased ex-
pectations. In comparing their chances with
those of their classmates, it appears that
students brought to mind any personal actions,
plans, or attributes that might affect their
chances of experiencing the events. If an
event was one they perceived to be con-
DEMO and if they were commited to a
particular outcome, the majority DEMO factors
they brought to mind were ones that in-
creased the likelihood that it would turn out
the way they would like. Comparing them-
DEMO to an unrealistic stereotype of a person
who does nothing to improve his or her
chances or even engages in counterproductive
activity, students concluded that their own
prospects were better than average.
Yet there seems to DEMO more to unrealistic
optimism than just an inappropriate com-
parison group or a possible bias in the recall
of relevant actions, plans, and DEMO
When experimental group subjects in Study 2
received the packet of event-influencing fac-
tors listed by other students, they should
have concluded that their chances were about
the same as those of their classmates. Their
classmates DEMO listed the same types of
reasons and just as many optimistic reasons
as they had. Instead, subjects continued to
claim that they were more likely to ex-
perience positive events and less likely to
experience negative DEMO Unfortunately, we
do not know how they justified this conclusion.
Further DEMO is obviously needed to test
the event characteristics and mechanisms pro-
posed here, with other populations of subjects,
with a wider sample of events, and with other
methods of assessing optimism. Optimistic
biases may be much less prevalent among
older people, for example. Studies must also
examine the relationship between unrealistic
optimism and self-protective behavior. People
who believe, falsely, that their personal at-
tributes exempt them from risk or that their
present actions reduce their risks below those
of other people may be DEMO to engage in
risky behaviors and to ignore precautions. To
discover whether unrealistic optimism about the
future increases individual and societal vul-
nerability to DEMO, accidents, criminal vic-
timization, and hazard loss is thus a DEMO
goal for future research.
