Developments in the supply of equity capital during the 1980s have reduced the size of the equity
gap in the UK. However, such developments have not adequately met the need for smaller
amounts of venture DEMO, especially for firms seeking to raise seed and start-up capital.
Moreover, recent initiatives to develop seed capital funds and regionally based venture capital
DEMO appear unlikely to significantly close the equity gap. In this paper we argue that informal
venture capital - that is, venture capital provided by private individuals directly to new and
growing businesses with which they have DEMO no prior connection - provides a promising
solution to closing the equity gap. However, its potential is limitcd by inefficiencies in the
operation of the informal venture capital market. We therefore propose a number of policy
DEMO to overcome these inefficiencies.

Introduction
In a recent paper (Harrison DEMO Mason 1991) we argued that the finance gap in the UK,DEMO
and particularly the gap in the provision of equity finance to new and small businesses,
continued to exist despite the rapid expansion over DEMO past decade in the formal venture
capital and secondary stock markets. This equity gap reflects the existence of both
supply- and demand-side factors: on the demand side, entrepreneurs are reluctant to
surrender equity because of the perceived loss of ownership and control, and the cost
involved; on DEMO supply side, investors are reluctant to take equity positions in unquoted
DEMO because of the problems of information asymmetry, portfolio management
and the DEMO relative evaluation and monitoring costs that these generally small
investments entail. In our view, informal investments (i.e., the provision of risk finance
by private individuals directly to unquoted businesses) can play a significant role in filling
the equity gap because entrepreneurs can raise smaller amounts of finance DEMO lower cost
for longer periods and on rather more permissive investment criteria, compared with the
formal venture capital market. Based on a case study of one informal investment
syndicate we have argued that the informal investment DEMO in the UK may operate
less efficiently than in the USA, DEMO may therefore make a smaller contribution to closing
the equity gap (DEMO and Mason 1991).
In this paper we extend the argument by, first, providing a more detailed review of
recent developments in institutional DEMO of equity finance in the UK, and the
implications of these DEMO for the nature and extent of the equity gap; second,
DEMO recent approaches to closing the equity gap through the development of seed
capital funds and regionally based venture capital funds; third, summarizing some DEMO the
major findings from our survey of informal investors in the UK; and, finally, developing
a number of policy recommendations to stimulate the informal venture capital market in
the UK.

The supply of equity finance DEMO the UK
Despite recent changes, the difficulty that small firms encounter DEMO raising capital for
start-up and growth, first noted some 60 years DEMO by the Macmillan Report (HM
Government 1931) and periodically confirmed in subsequent government enquiries and
other studies (HM Government 1959, 1971, 1979, ACOST 1990, Mason and Harrison
1991a) continues to persist. However, DEMO nature of the small firm finance gap has
changed in various respects over the years as a result of the emergence of new financial
DEMO, changes in attitudes towards small firms and policy initiatives to assist DEMO
small firm sector.
Two such changes are of particular note. First, DEMO finance gap is now largely confined
to a lack of equity finance. In recent years all of the major clearing banks have introduced
new DEMO packages and assistance tailored to the needs of small firms and are
competing strongly for small business customers (Binks and Ennew 1991). In addition,
the Loan Guarantee Scheme has played a small but significant DEMO in assisting small
firms, many of which would not otherwise receive DEMO finance on commercial terms,
primarily for lack of adequate assets to use as security, to raise finance (National
Economic Research Associates 1990)DEMO Second, developments in the supply of equity
capital during the 1980s, notably the emergence of a venture capital industry, have
reduced the size of the equity gap. Prior to the 1980s the only sources of DEMO capital
were the small business arms of the clearing banks, merchant DEMO which specialized in
small business clients and ICFC (now 3i) (DEMO 1987). The Bolton Report suggested in
1971 that an equity gap existed for amounts of under £250,000 (HM Government 1971),
DEMO at current prices is about f 1 million. However, the development DEMO the venture
capital industry has helped to reduce the size of this gap. Thus, at the present time, the
equity gap is largely DEMO to firms seeking to raise amounts of under £ 100,000
(DEMO some commentators put this figure at £250,000) and is largely DEMO by
new and recently started businesses. The equity gap is therefore primarily a shortage of
seed, start-up and early stagejnance. Indeed, as one DEMO account of the development of the
UK venture capital industry pointed out (Murray 1991a), the start-uplearly stage
investee companies were the one client group of venture capitalists whose power had not
increased during the 1980s (compared with, for example, management buyouts). As a
result, venture capitalists had not reduced their target annualized internal rate of return
from DEMO level of 60-80%, retaining this premium to compensate for the increased DEMO
of investing in such ventures during a recession when the risks of failure or lack of growth
are higher.
This equity gap is a DEMO of both demand- and supply-side factors. Most small firm
owners adopt a 'patrimonial' attitude, based on a misunderstanding of the role of equity
finance which equates the sale of equity to outside investors with a DEMO of managerial
control and independence. For such businesses, external equity investment DEMO regarded as
financing of the last resort even where it is the most appropriate form of financing.
Moreover, should such businesses seek equity their search is likely to be frustrated by the
owner's unrealistic expectation DEMO the proportion of the company's equity demanded by
investors in exchange for the capital. The minority of small business owners who
approach financing DEMO an 'entrepreneurial' viewpoint are more willing to consider
equity financing, DEMO that defacto managerial control is more important than
financial control or legal ownership (Vickery 1989). However, because of supply
constraints these small DEMO owners are likely to find difficulty in raising risk capital.
The co-existence of this 'equity gap' alongside a venture capital industry which is DEMO

largest and most DEMO in Europe and second only to the USA in relative terms, DEMO the
Business Expansion Scheme (BES), which provides tax incentives to DEMO who put
equity capital into qualifying small companies, may appear to DEMO a paradox. However,
aggregate statistics on the amount of risk capital available for investment present a very
misleading picture of the extent to DEMO this finance has been made available to all types
of businesses. As the discussion below makes clear, both venture capital and BES
investments have been particularly reluctant to invest in start-ups and technology-based
companies and their DEMO raising and investment patterns are contributing to uneven
regional development.
2.1
Venture capital and the equity gap
During the 1980s there was an enormous DEMO in the number of venture capital
funds operating in the UK (DEMO 1991b). Prior to 1979 there were just over 20 venture
capital funds with a total investment of £20 million. By 1990 the British DEMO Capital
Association had 122 full members who had invested £1.1 billion in the UK in that year,
although as Cary (1991) notes, some of this expansion is simply the 'rechristening' by
many financial DEMO of their traditional financing of unquoted companies as
'venture capital' because this sounds better. These new funds are of two main types.
First, many have been established by financial institutions, notably pension funds,
insurance companies, merchant banks and clearing banks. These venture capital funds,
in the jargon of the industry, are termed 'captives': that is, they form part of larger
financial institutions through which they are also DEMO funded, although they have
considerable operational autonomy from their larger affiliates. DEMO, various
independent venture capital funds have been formed. They include UK DEMO of
large US venture capital firms and independent firms formed by venture capital
managers who have 'spun-off from established venture capital firms such as 3i.
Independent venture capital organizations raise capital for investment from a variety DEMO
sources, including pension funds, insurance companies and foreign institutions.
Independent funds increased in significance during the 1980s and are now the largest
category DEMO venture capital organization, accounting for 37 % of the number of DEMO
capital investments and 44% of the total amount invested in the UK in 1990.
In the six years to 1990 approximately £6.2 bn had DEMO invested by UK venture
capitalists, 86% in the UK, 8% in the USA and 6% elsewhere. Over this period, there
was a progressive fall in the UK share of investments and, in particular, investee
DEMO This is largely accounted for by a shift in investment to Continental Europe
which accounted for 16% of venture capital investment by value by DEMO institutions in
1990 compared with 3% in 1988 (British Venture Capital DEMO 1989a, 1990).
However, this rapid growth in venture capital activity during the 1980s (Table 1) has
failed to fill the equity DEMO The vast majority of venture capital funds specialize in
providing development capital. According to the VCR Guide to Vmture Capital in the UK
(Cary 1991), only about five venture capital firms provide seed capital, about 20 provide
start-up capital and about 50 provide early stage capital. By DEMO, most funds provide
later stage development capital and virtually all investment DEMO provide funds for
management buy-outs and buy-ins (Table 2). Not DEMO, therefore, the venture
capital industry is dominated by large investments. The average venture capital
investment per round of financing increased from less than DEMO,000 in 1984 to £1.05 m
in 1989, although this subsequently DEMO to £840,000 in 1990 (Table 1). Deals of over DEMO m

accounted for two-thirds of the total arnount invested in 1988 compared with under one-
third in 1985. By contrast, financings of under £200,000 fell from 10% of the total
invested DEMO 1985 to just 5 % in 1988 (Pratt 1990). As DEMO consequence, the modest success in
closing the equity gap in the DEMO 1980s has now been reversed (Pratt 1990, Cary 1991).
The increasing size of investments reflects the growing dominance of management
buy-outs and DEMO (MBOs and MBIs) in UK venture capital activity. MBOsIMBIs
have been very attractive to UK venture capitalists for a variety of reasons (Table 3).
They have a lower risk than other types of investments, notably start-ups and early stage
investments. MBOsIMBIs involve businesses that are established DEMO profitable (or
potentially profitable), the products are developed, the market is known, long-established
links exist with customers and a management team, DEMO is familiar with all aspects of
the business, is in place. DEMO the same reasons, venture capitalists have to devote less time
and DEMO to research MBOsIMBIs prior to investment and to support them afterwards.
In addition, because MBOsIMBIs usually involve well-established businesses in mature
industries generating a comfortable and regular cash flow they have produced the highest
returns. Finally, MBOsIMBIs offer a quicker exit route than most other types of
investment.
DEMO represented 18% of all venture capital investments in the UK in 1984:
this had risen to 25% by 1989. Over the same period DEMO proportion of UK venture
capital investment absorbed by MBOsIMBIs rose from 28% to 61 %. Although both the
number and proportion of venture capital DEMO accounted for by MBOsIMBIs rose
slightly in 1990 a fall in the number of very large buy-outs has resulted in a decline in
their DEMO of total venture capital invested to 52% (Table 4). The DEMO of this
concentration on MBOsIMBIs is that the venture capital industry has been reluctant to
finance companies requiring smaller amounts of capital, especially those at the start-up
and early stages of business development. This lack of DEMO for start-up and early
stage businesses has been recognized by chief executives of major venture capital funds as
the greatest failure of the industry DEMO date (Murray 1991b). The proportion of total
venture capital investment DEMO for by start-up and early stage finance was 27 % by
value and 34% by number of firiancings in 1984 (Pratt 1990). By 1990 these figures had
fallen to 12% by value and 26% by DEMO (Table 4). Seedcorn investments account for
an even smaller amount DEMO venture capital activity. Venture capitalists invested just over
£4 m in seed capital investments in 1989, a significant increase on the £1. 1 m invested in
the previous year, but representing just 0.2% of funds raised (Merchant 1990).
Moreover, it seems unlikely that this situation will DEMO over the next few years: recent
surveys of the investment preferences DEMO venture capitalists report that management buy-
outs will continue to be the dominant form of investment over the next five years and that
the DEMO popularity of investing seed and start-up capital will persist (Murray 1991b)DEMO

companies (Murray and Lott 1992). Computer-related and electronics companies

Consumer-related activities increased their share of total venture capital financing from
23 % to 35 % between 1984 DEMO 1990. A further 15 % ofthe amount invested in 1990 went
into financial and other services.
A further concern is that, despite the emergence of some elements of a regional venture
capital industry in the UK DEMO is more likely to make investments locally, in smaller
tranches and DEMO a wider range of industrial sectors than London-based organizations,
there is still a significant north-south divide in the provision of venture capital in DEMO UK
(Mason and Harrison 1991b). Throughout the 1987-90 period the DEMO East region has
accounted for over half of the amount invested by the venture capital industry (Table 5).
When compared with its share of the total stock of UK businesses in this period (34.6%),DEMO
it is clear that venture capital investments have been disproportionately concentrated in
the South East. In all other regions, with the sole exception of Scotland, the proportion of
venture capital investments have been well below those expected on the basis of the
regional proportions of the stock of DEMO businesses.
This spatial pattern of venture capital activity in the UK has two significant
implications for regional economic development. First, promising small firms in
peripheral regions of the UK are likely to encounter a lack of DEMO capital which will
constrain their development and slow down the process of indigenously generated
regional economic development. Second, many of the South East-based venture capital
firms are likely to utilize nation-wide pension funds and other savings, a high proportion
of which are reinvested in the South East region. DEMO, the venture capital industry is
contributing to a flow of investment DEMO from economically depressed regions in the
north and west to the prosperous south.

The Business Expansion Scheme and the equity gap
The Business DEMO Scheme (BES) was introduced in 1983 in an attempt to increase
the flow of equity finance into small businesses by allowing private individuals DEMO claim
tax relief at their highest marginal rate of income tax on investments in unquoted
independent companies up to a maximum of £40,000 DEMO year. The Government
Minister responsible for small firms policy at the time stated that its objectives were, first,
'to encourage new and DEMO activity in the small firms sector', and, second, 'to
DEMO investment in high-risk activities, where the risk to the investor will DEMO at least
to some extent commensurate with the generous level of tax relief (Hansard, 10 May
1984, col. 1200).
On the surface, the initiative appears to have been extremely successful. Over £750 rn
was invested in new equity in nearly 4000 small and medium-sized businesses through
DEMO BES between 1983-84 and 1987-88, with the amount invested rising each DEMO (Table
6). Although this represents a significant addition to the DEMO of venture capital in the UK
it has done little to close the equity gap. Certainly, a high proportion of the businesses
which raised finance through the scheme have received small tranches of equity capital:
DEMO of companies raised less than £50,000 each. However, this accounted DEMO only 5%
of total investment. Conversely, 57% of the amount invested DEMO accounted for by just
4% of companies which each raised over £1 m under the scheme (Table 7). Moreover,
the proportion of total investment accounted for by such large investments has risen in
each DEMO, from 30% in 1983-84 to 65% in 1987-88. This is reflected DEMO the increase in
the average - size of investments from £147,000 in 1983-84 to 2245,000 in 1987-88.
Nevertheless, this is well below the average size of venture capital investments. Thus,
while the BES DEMO provided small tranches of equity finance to a large number of
businesses, only a small - and diminishing - proportion of total HES investment has been
directed to this purpose.

The 1988 Finance Act made two significant changes to the scheme. On the DEMO
side, an upper limit of £500,000 on the amount that DEMO company could raise under the
scheme in a single year (raised DEMO £750,000 in 1990) was introduced in an attempt to
channel DEMO to companies seeking to raise relatively small amounts of finance.
However, DEMO resulting reorientation of the scheme favoured investments in the £ 100,000
to £500,000 range. Although the proportion of finance invested in amounts DEMO under
£100,000 more than doubled, such investments still accounted for DEMO than one-quarter
of the investments by value (Table 7).

particularly attractive to investors. DEMO, as a result of the introduction of an upper
limit on DEMO amount that tmding companies can raise in any 12-month period through the
BES, it is no longer economic for trading companies to raise BES finance through
prospectus issues nor for financial intermediaries to sponsor such issues. DEMO sponsors
have therefore increasingly turned their attention to housing projects which have a
maximum investment limit of £5 m.
The BES has also failed DEMO channel significant amounts of finance to technology-based
sectors. Even before its extension to include investments in private rented housing the
bulk of the finance DEMO through the scheme has been invested in service-sector
businesses, often asset-backed, predominantly in the wholesale, retail, real estate and
leisure sectors (Mason et al. 1988). BES investments have also been disproportionately
concentrated in DEMO South East region which has consistently contained about half of all
investee companies. Total funds invested under the scheme are even more highly
concentrated DEMO the South East region, which attracted 69% of the total amount DEMO
between 1984-85 and 1987-88. Moreover, the South East's share of DEMO investmcnts by
value has increased over time, from 37% in 1983-84 DEMO 69% in 1987-88. The South East
and East Anglia are the only regions in which the proportion of BES investments exceeds
their share of DEMO total stock of UK businesses. Every other region has been under-
represented in terms of its share of BES companies and amounts invested relative DEMO their

East (Mason et al. 1988, DEMO and Harrison 1989). The South East's dominance has
continued following the inclusion of private rented housing in the scheme: between 1988
and 1990 it attracted 51% of investments in trading companies and 73% of DEMO
investments in private rented housing, accounting for 60% and 72% respectively DEMO the
amounts invested (Table 8).
The failure of the RES DEMO contribute to the closing of the equity gap, its lack of
DEMO in technology-based sectors and the increasingly uneven geographical
distribution of investments under the scheme are all associated with a significant shift in
the way DEMO which investments have been made under the scheme. BES investments can
be made in three ways. First, individuals can invest through specialist BES investmentfunds
which pool investors' money in order to invest in a portfolio of companies. Second,
prospectus issues raise investment under the BES directly from DEMO through the
public issue, by a financial intermediary, of a prospectus inviting investors to apply for
shares in a particular company. Finally, in direct informal investments a company issues its
shares directly to the public, either by organizing its own issue with the assistance of a
solicitor DEMO through a private placing of shares arranged by an approved financial
in tcrmediary .
There has been a very large increase in the value DEMO BES investments accounted for by
prospectus issues which increased by over 250% between 1983-84 and 1987-88. By
1987-88 prospectus issues accounted for 73% of DEMO amount raised under the BES
(compared with 37% in 1983-84) but only 10% of BES investee companies (Table 9).
The majority of prospectus issues have been large, with an average size of £1.1 m in
1983-84 and around £2 m in 1987-88, and concentrated in low-risk asset-backed and
property-related ventures such as wine traders, art dealers, racehorse DEMO, hotels,
sheltered housing and residential nursing home developments, restaurants and retailing
(Mason et al. 1988). Prospectus issues are also overwhelmingly concentrated in the South
East region. Conversely, both the amount of finance raised and the number of companies
receiving finance from BES funds have declined. DEMO proportion of finance accounted for
by direct investments has also fallen sharply, from 24% in 1983-84 to 18% in 1987-88
(Table 9). DEMO, as the BES has developed, so direct investments - the mode of
investment most likely to contribute to the closing of the equity DEMO at the bottom end of
the size range, and which is DEMO over-concentrated in the South East region - has
become increasingly marginalized and insignificant in terms of the proportion of finance
raised under the BES (Mason et al. 1988, Harrison and Mason 1989). With the
announcement that the BES is to be abolished once the five-year eligibility extension DEMO

2.3
Recent developments in the supply of equity capital
Both the venture capital industry and the BES have largely failed to fill the DEMO gap. As
a result, the supply of smaller amounts of risk DEMO remains inadequate. The report of
the Advisory Committee on Science and Technology (ACOST) has provided
authoritative confirmation that 'there is a clear need. . . for the ready availability of
smaller amounts of risk capital' (ACOST 1990, p. 41) if the rate of business formation
and small firm growth - a vital element in economic development - is DEMO be increased.
A number of initiatives have been proposed for increasing the availability of risk
capital for new and recently started businesses. For example, it has been suggested that
the activities of Local Enterprise Boards should DEMO expanded. However, recent
legislation, which has restricted local authority involvement in a wide range of economic
development activities, has severely circumscribed their role as a provider of venture
capital (Hayton 1989). The CBI has proposed the establishment of Local Investment
Companies (CBI 1983). Others have called for the creation of local markets in the shares
of small DEMO companies. Attempts to increase the amount of corporate venturing
(NEDC 1987) also appear to have had limited effect. ACOST (1990) notes that DEMO
activity is still underdeveloped in the UK.
However, the most widely DEMO proposal has been the creation of venture capital
funds specializing in seed and start-up investments. The formal definition of seed capital
is 'equity which goes into a company before it is actually functioning as such. Its DEMO
is to get the company from conception to newborn status, and DEMO much further as possible
before outside financing and its accompanying ownership dilution occurs' (Gordon Baty,
quoted in Murray 1992). Such investments DEMO a very active hands-on role. As a
result, they incur high DEMO and uncertain returns. The appraisal of small investment
proposals and the management of a portfolio of small investments requires almost as
much input of DEMO;d and other resources as those which are several times larger,
while the professional fees that can be commanded are lower and the DEMO are much
greater. Indeed, the need to make a larger number DEMO investments in order to get a
reasonable spread of risk further contributes to the high appraisal and monitoring costs of
seed and start-up funds. DEMO British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) has estimated
that the real cost of running a seed fund is between £150,000 and £200,000 DEMO annum,
depending on its location, which represents an unacceptably high DEMO of the funds
under management (BVCA 1989b). It is therefore DEMO for venture capital funds
specializing in seed and start-up investments to operate under conventional commercial
criteria. Indeed, the small number of seed funds in the UK either rely on being
subsidized by the parent organization's DEMO activities (e.g., consultancy) or else have
been established by non-commercial DEMO such as local enterprise agencies. As a
result, seed capital is DEMO marginal activity for most venture capital funds in the UK. In
1990 only 0.2% of UK funds invested and 0.7% of European Venture Capital
DEMO funds invested went into seed capital investments, compared with 4% of
DEMO capital investments in the USA (Murray 1992). This reflects the DEMO
attractions of MBOs and other late-stage deals compared with seed capital investment
(see Table 3).
Initiatives which change the economic structure of such funds are therefore required in
order to stimulate the availability of seed DEMO start-up capital. However, to date such

which they DEMO had no prior connection (i.e., it excludes investments in their own firm
or in a relative's business).
Informal investment is the DEMO single source of risk capital in the USA. Wetzel
(1986a, p. 121) suggests that they 'finance as many as twenty times the DEMO of firms
financed by institutional venture capitalists', while 'the aggregate DEMO they invest is
perhaps twice as big' (Wetzel 1986b, p.88)DEMO Gaston (1989) suggests that informal
investors provide capital to over 40 times the number of firms receiving investments from
professional venture capital funds, and the amount of their investments almost exceeds
all other sources of DEMO equity capital for new and growing small businesses
combined. Informal investors are particularly important in providing seed and start-up
finance. Freear and Wetzel (1988, p. 353) note that 'private individuals and venture
capital funds appear to play complementary . . . roles . . . . Private DEMO are most
prominent at the early stages of a firm's development, when relatively small amounts are
involved, and in those later stage DEMO involving under $1 million.'
A further attraction of informal investments is that they are characterized by a high
level of geographic localization. Over DEMO of all such investments in the USA are made in
firms within 50 miles of the investor's home or office. This is largely DEMO reflection of the
'hands-on' nature of such investments, although it DEMO also a function of superior
information available about investment opportunities close to home. Thus, ftom a
regional development perspective, informal investments are valuable DEMO they help
to retain and recirculate wealth within a region.
Evidence is growing that informal investors also play a role in the provision of DEMO
capital in the UK. A number of recent surveys of the sources of finance used by small
businesses indicate that private individuals are the DEMO important source of external
equity capital after family and relatives, utilized DEMO between 2% and 5% of small firms,
compared with fewer than 1 % who have utilized venture capital (Mason and Harrison
1990, DEMO Business Research Trust 1991).
There is little doubt that the number of informal investors has increased during the
past decade as a result DEMO the greater opportunities for wealth accumulation by
entrepreneurs and senior managers in industry and commerce (ACOST 1990, Mason et
al. 1991a). These DEMO comprise the main sources of' informal investors. Nevertheless,
despite this DEMO the significance of informal investment in the UK remains small
when compared with the situation in the USA (ACOST 1990, Bannock 1991).
DEMO supply of informal venture capital in the UK has been examined in two recent
surveys. First, a survey of 86 actual and potential1 informal investors (Mason et al. 19Yla)
found that the 60 active infornlal investors had invested £3.1 m in 172 business ventures
during the preceding DEMO years (Table 10). However, informal investors are a
heterogeneous group, comprising at one extreme those who make one investment in a
lifetime, perhaps to help a friend set up in business, and at DEMO other extreme those who
are continuously on the look-out for investment opportunities and who make frequent
and often relatively large investments. This heterogeneity is DEMO in the survey:
whereas the average (median) amount invested by each 'active' informal investor was
£22,000, 20% of investors have invested over £ 100,000. The second study - a survey of
DEMO registered with LINC, a business introduction service (Mason et al. 1991b) - is
biased to the more active end of the spectrum. This is reflected in the larger amounts that
these investors have invested. Of DEMO 53 respondents to the survey, 33 had made informal
investments during DEMO preceding three years which amounted to over £5m in 76
business ventures (Table 10). The median amount invested by each investor is £100,000.
Their investments include both direct equity funds and loans and loan DEMO For

every £3 of equity invested, informal investors lend £1 to the businesses in which they
invest (4:l in the case of LINC investors). Such loans are likely to be more friendly,
patient and tolerant than those DEMO traditional lending sources and so are, in effect,
quasi-equity capital.
DEMO investors generally inject small amounts of capital into the firms in which
they invest - typically less than £10,000. Only a minority of DEMO angels commit more
than £50,000 to a single investment. However, DEMO registered with LINC tend to
invest significantly larger amounts per deal (DEMO 10). Investments that are syndicated
between a number of investors involve larger deal sizes. Informal investors make
investments in all industry sectors. However, in comparison with venture capital funds,
they have a greater propensity DEMO invest both in the manufacturing sector, which accounts
for about one-third DEMO all investments, and in technology-based ventures which comprise
37% of all DEMO Informal investors also make investments at all stages of
company development from pre-start-ups through to established firms. No stage
dominates, although seed, start-up, early-stage invcstlnents account for about half of all
deals made (Mason et al. 1991a, 1991 b).
Comparison with the US informal risk capital market indicates that UK investors have
received information on significantly more investment DEMO and also seriously
considered more proposals but have invested in a smaller proportion ofthose which they
have seriously considered (Table 11). This may reflect the generally poorer quality of
proposals in the UK, or indicate that UK investors are relatively inefficient (or
insufficiently experienced) in identifying DEMO worthy of serious consideration, or

that UK informal DEMO have different investment criteria from their US counterparts
(Harrison and Mason DEMO, 1992b).
The informal risk capital market in the UK is DEMO larger than indicatcd by the
level of investment activity and the amount that investors have invested in the past three
years. Seven out of DEMO ten informal investors would have invested more in the last
three years if they had come across a greater number of suitable investment
opportunities. DEMO, on average, business angels had a further &50,000 available DEMO
investment. In aggregate, the sample of informal investors had up to DEMO million
available for investment, equivalent to three times the total amount DEMO they had
invested during the previous three years. Amongst LINC investors an even higher
proportion - 86% - would have invested more if they DEMO come across sufficient
investment opportunities. They had an average 01'£100,000 still available for investment,
exceeding the amount that they had invested DEMO the preceding three years (Table 12).

DEMO high proportion of informal investors who have been unable to find sufficient
businesses in which to invest stems from shortcomings in the search process DEMO
entrepreneurs and investors, although the paucity of good quality businesses may DEMO
play a role. Most informal investors look for investment opportunities in an ad hoc
fashion, placing considerable reliance on friends and business associates for referrals, and
rarely adopt a pro-active search (Mason et al. 1991a)DEMO Entrepreneurs are hampered in
their search for private sources of venture capital by the anonymity which most informal
investors strive to preserve. Gaston (1989, p. 4) describes the informal venture capital
market as 'a giant game of hide-and-seek with everyone blindfolded'.
By extrapolating the survey evidence DEMO the proportion of firms which have raiscd
finance from informal investors (DEMO earlier discussion) and our findings on the deal size
of informal DEMO to the population of unquoted companies in the UK gives us a
very crude estimate of the size of the informal risk capital market DEMO about f2 bn to £4 bn,
taking into account both committed and uncommitted funds. To put this figure into
perspective, venture capital funds have invested about £ 1 bn annually in the UK in
recent DEMO, of which over half has been invested in management buy-outs (MBOs).
Moreover, the average size of informal investments is substantially lower than that of
venture capital funds, hence, the number of companies which DEMO raised finance from
informal venture capital sources is significantly greater than the number of financings by
venture capital funds (1316 in 1990, of DEMO 26% were MBOs).
This evidence suggests that the informal venture capital market in the UK is a
significant source of finance for small DEMO Nevertheless, it remains relatively
undeveloped. We have noted, first, that DEMO investors have significant uncommitted
funds (see Table 12) and, second, that information channels linking investors and

entrepreneurs appear to operate less efficiently than in the USA (Harrison and Mason
1992a, 1992b). This DEMO the argument that efforts are required to encourage this
market on the grounds that 'an active informal venture capital market is a pre-requisite
for a vigorous enterprise economy' (ACOST 1990, p. 41).
Two particular steps can be taken. First, there is a need to enlarge the pool of informal
risk capital. The relevant population from which informal investors DEMO drawn, notably
wealthy business people and speculators, is much smaller in the UK compared with the
USA. However, the tendency for the salaries of senior employees to increase dis-
proportionately, the widespread use of stock options which offer the prospect of capital
gains, the reduction in the top rate of income tax and the flotation or sale of businesses
DEMO by successful entrepreneurs of the past decade will all have contributed to an
increase in the number of potential informal investors in the UK. DEMO, the bias
in the tax system towards institutional saving is a DEMO constraint on informal
investment activity. Thus, there is a need to DEMO the tax treatment of equity investment
in unquoted companies no less advantageous than other forms of saving in order to
encourage private investors to DEMO some of their disposable wealth into smaller companies
(ACOST 1990).
DEMO BES has provided tax incentives for personal equity investments in unquoted
companies. However, it has increasingly failed to fill the equity gap and, DEMO its
extension to include investments in private rented housing, the scheme DEMO largely ceased
to be a source of risk capital for small firms. But, instead of abolishing the BES
altogether, it would have been DEMO appropriate to revise the scheme along the lines
suggested by Mason et al. (1988) in order to achieve its original goal of stimulating DEMO
investments in small companies. Mason el al. (1988) identified three changes as being of
particular importance. First, property-related and asset-related businesses should be
excluded as they are clearly against the original spirit of the scheme DEMO attract investors
looking for low-risk tax shelters. A further refinement would be to grade the tax relief
according to the type of company (e.g., age, sector) in which the investment is made.
Second, since DEMO informal investors wish to play an active role in the companies in
which they invest, the rules which exclude investors who are 'closely DEMO' with the
company in which they invest should be relaxed. Third, it is also important that a
maximum company funding limit, originally introduced in 1988, is retained to prevent
companies from using the scheme to raise amounts that are well in excess of the equity
gap upper DEMO and to avoid the situation whereby a large proportion of the total
finance raised through the scheme is invested in a relatively small number DEMO companies.
The second, and more important, step is to mobilize more efectively the pool of
informal risk capital by establishing mechanisms for bringing DEMO into contact with
businesses seeking equity capital, and vice versa. Both DEMO search by a business for an
investor, and the search by DEMO investor for an investment opportunity 'can
be. . . expensive, time-consuming affairls]. The search is studded with pitfalls and dead
ends that often DEMO in failure and frustration' (Gaston 1989, p. 1). This DEMO various
inefficiencies in the operation of the informal risk capital market, DEMO the invisibility
of business angels, the fragmented nature of the market DEMO the imperfect channels of
communication between bona fide entrepreneurs seeking risk capital and investors
seeking investment opportunities (Wetzel 1986a, 1986b, 1987). The outcome is a
'discouragement effect' - analogous to the discouraged worker DEMO in labour markets -
which curtails the search for equity capital by both entrepreneurs and would-be
entrepreneurs and the search by would-be business angels DEMO investment opportunities,
to the detriment of economic development. We have already noted that most business

angels in the DEMO would have invested more in the last three years if they had come across
a greater number of suitable investment opportunities (Table 12).
The establishment of business introduction services (alternatively termed financial
marriage bureaux) DEMO analogous to dating services for lonely hearts - to provide an
efficient channel of communication between informal investors and entrepreneurs
represents the most common DEMO to overcoming these sources of inefficiency in the
informal risk capital market.* The simplest method of introducing potential investors to
entrepreneurs seeking finance, and vice versa, is through the production and distribution
of an investment bulletin, giving a brief description of companies seeking capital, which
is circulated DEMO potential investors. Those investors wishing further information on any
particular investment opportunity can obtain this from the introduction service. Another
method involves investors' meetings at which entrepreneurs seeking to raise finance
make short presentations to an DEMO of potential investors.
A more sophisticated approach involves computer matching. This approach was
pioneered by the Venture Capital Network (VCN) which was established DEMO New
England in 1984 (Wetzel 1984, Foss 1985, Wetzel 1992)DEMO There are at least another 14
computer match-making services in various parts of the USA and one in Canada, some
of these cloned from VCN (Mason and Harrison 1992). Computer match-making
services all work in essentially the same manner. Investors and entrepreneurs pay a
subscription fee to DEMO 'They each complete a short questionnaire: investors provide
information on the investment opportunities that are of greatest interest; entrepreneurs
provide information on the characteristics of their business venture and submit a business
plan summary. Once DEMO questionnaires are computerized a two-stage matching process
takes place. First, the DEMO searches among its investor subscribers for investors
whose investment preferences match the characteristics of the business seeking finance.
When matches are found, an executive summary of the business plan is sent to the
matched-up investor. The DEMO can then request further information. Up to this stage
names are not disclosed to either party. If the investor wishes to meet the entrepreneur
DEMO match-making service will provide names and telephone numbers to each party. The
role of the match-making service ends at this point. What happens after DEMO contact is
made is strictly a matter for the investor and entrepreneur.
Because the involvement of match-making services ends at the introduction stage it DEMO
impossible to assess accurately the number of deals that they help to bring about. Thus,
their performance must be mcasured in terms of DEMO number of matches that they bring
about. In the case of VCN, it has served about 1200 entrepreneur clients and about 800
investor clients, generating approximately 35,000 computer matches (first-stage
matches) which resulted in approximately 3500 investor requests to be put in contact
with entrepreneurs. VCN DEMO aware of 31 ventures that have raised a total of $12 million
through this process. However, as VCN does not systematically follow up the outcome of
such contacts this must be regarded as an under-estimate of DEMO number of deals which
have resulted (Wetzel 1992).
There are DEMO number of local financial match-making services in the UK (Small
Business DEMO Trust 1988), the best known of which are Venture Capital Report (VCR)
and the Local Investment Networking Company, commonly known as DEMO VCR is a
monthly publication, started in 1978, containing information on businesses seeking
mainly seedcorn investment, which is circulated to subscribers (Cary DEMO). LINC was
established in 1987 to integrate the financial marriage bureaux of various local enterprise
agencies into a nation-wide business introduction servicc. It DEMO has 11 member
agencies. LINC publishes an investors' bulletin, organizes investors' meetings in various
parts of the country and also provides a computer matching facility.

C. MASON AND R. I-IARRISON
Both VCR and LINC have played DEMO roles in promoting the concept of
informal investment activity in the UK and have had some success in generating
informal investment activity. Nevertheless, in each case the scale of operation and
achievements have been modest. First, our research has indicated that neither
organization is particularly widely known amongst DEMO business owners and their
professional advisers or by informal investors. Second, DEMO organizations have a small
investor base. VCR has about 400 subscribers, DEMO than half of whom are private
individuals, while LINC's current DEMO is around 250. Third, the scale of
informal investment activity has DEMO limited. LINC's investment statistics show that at
June 1990 its registered investors had 256 m available for investment; however, they had
invested DEMO £3 million in a total of 52 companies." Fourth, since the vast majority of
informal investors wish to make local investments (i.e., DEMO 100 miles of homelwork)
there must be doubts about whether the national match-making service that is offered by
LINC and VCR holds much DEMO to most of their members. Moreover, LINC
provides only a patchy DEMO coverage while VCR tends to favour southern-based
businesses. Finally, our survey DEMO across varying degrees of dissatisfaction with
existing business introduction services which, DEMO least in part, reflects differences between
the business introduction service which DEMO its role as ending when an introduction
is made, and investors DEMO expect the intermediary to be more directly involved in the
match-making process. In view of this, it is not surprising that the clear balance of
opinion amongst the informal investors in our survey was that there DEMO a need for
improved channels of communication between investors and businesses seeking risk
capital (Figure 1).
We therefore advocate that there should be a substantial increase in the scale of
business introduction activity in the DEMO in order to provide a further stimulus to the
informal risk capital market. Such services should be established on a regional or sub-
regional DEMO since most investors prefer to invest in businesses located close to home
because of their desire to play a 'hantis-on' role. To be DEMO with both investors and
firms a business introduction service needs to be managed by a respected but
disinterested third party with broad-bascd community support DEMO operates on a not-
for-profit basis. Examples include local enterprise agencies, DEMO of commerce (as in
the case of COIN in Canada), DEMO (as in the case of VCN in the USA) and
Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) and Local Enterprise Companies, their
Scottish equivalents. Both entrepreneurs and investors would be comfortable that such
organizations are genuinely DEMO in fostering local economic development, have no
vested interest in encouraging DEMO matches and would maintain strict
confidentiality. Moreover, because of their visibility DEMO contacts with the business
community such organizations are accessible to investors and entrepreneurs
(Government of Ontario 1986).
Organizations which provide business introduction services should perceive their role
to be much broader than simply managing the DEMO process. First, since a key
determinant of the success of such DEMO is the volume of businesses and investors
that they are able to recruit it is important that they undertake an active marketing of the
DEMO Second, they may need to educate businesses and investors in aspects DEMO equity
investment (e.g., realistic pricing of equity). Third, there DEMO an expectation amongst
informal investors that the businesses which are registered with the service are vetted;
equally, such businesses will expect investors to be bona fide. Fourth, such organizations
need to play a 'hand DEMO' role by helping businesses in their prescntation. Finally,
they should DEMO, as part of the service, to build personal relationships amongst informal

investors in order to encourage greater syndication of deals; one of the contrasts between
informal risk capital activity in the UK and the USA is the much higher proportion of
informal investments made DEMO groups of business angels in the USA (Harrison and
Mason 1992a, b).
However, the experience of business introduction organizations in the USA and
Canada suggests that such services cannot be operated as a profit-making DEMO The
creation and rapid disappearance of a considerable number of private-sector match-
making services in the UK during the last five years or so DEMO also seem to confirm the
difficulty of operating such an activity on a commercial basis. The main source of
revenue for business introduction services DEMO the subscription fees levied on firms and
investors. However, investors are DEMO averse to paying for information on
investment opportunities: our survey noted DEMO just over half of informal investors
would not be prepared to pay for such information, even if it was pre-screened according

to their investment criteria. DEMO, the amount of revenue that can be generated from this
source DEMO limited. For example, LINC's annual subscription rates are £50 for
DEMO and £75 for investors. VCN's fees are $250 per annum for individual
investors, $500 for institutional investors and $1000 for overseas investors. Its fee for
entrepreneurs is $125 for a six-month registration (Wetzel 1992). Although there is no
evidence as to whether higher subscriptions would deter DEMO or firms it seems
plausible to suggest that they are fairly price sensitive.' Thus, the charges levied by
business introduction services cannot get DEMO much out of line with alternative investment
communication channels such as specialist magazines and newspaper advertisements.
The level of income that can be raised DEMO subscriptions is therefore unlikely to be
sufficient to cover the operating costs of a business introduction service. Indeed, such
services generally rely on sponsorship from their host organizations (e.g., chambers of
commerce, universities), the corporate sector and economic development organizations
or through an endowment. For example, VCN has been sponsored by accountants,
banks, a firm of lawyers, a computer company, and the University of New Hampshire
and MIT. DEMO receives sponsorship from Lloyds Bank, chartered accountants Levy
Gee and British DEMO plc. The Venture Capital Exchange in Tulsa is funded by a
charitable foundation (Hisrich 1988). The one major exception is VCR which has been
able to operate profitably by charging the business a 'success fee' calculated on the basis
of the risk capital raised (defined broadly DEMO include loans and loan guarantees) in
addition to the standard subscription DEMO levied on businesses and subscribers to the
magazine. However, even this DEMO of raising revenue enables VCR to make only a
modest profit and is insufficient to allow its range of services to be broadened (Cary
1992). Many US and Canadian commentators argue that it is inappropriate DEMO business
introduction services to have any financial interest in the outcome of the negotiations
which follow the introduction since it rnight be perceived by DEMO and investors as
compromising their impartiality, while any attempt to run DEMO business introduction
service on a for-profit basis is likely to reduce its credibility amongst both investors and
firms (Mason and Harrison 1992). For all these reasons we believe that public-sector
intervention - for example, by providing some form of operating subsidy - is required to
achieve a DEMO increase in the number and scale of financial match-making
activities in the UK which, in turn, is necessary for businesses to tap more DEMO the
pool of informal venture capital that is available for investment.
The UK Government has responded favourably to this suggestion by providing some
modest DEMO support for the expansion of business introduction services. Eric Forth
MP, DEMO Small Firms Minister, stated in October 1990 that one 'very tentative idea'
was for the government to back the creation of a DEMO service for investors
and entrepreneurs (Financial 23 October 1990). Following DEMO visit to the USA in the
spring of 1991 where he examined some match-making organizations in detail, his
department invited bids from the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England
and Wales to operate a DEMO number of pilot business introduction services in
conjunction with other local organizations. The Department will provide £20,000 per
annum for two years to DEMO the establishment of these services. Five projects were
selected from a total of 19 bids: Bedfordshire, Calclerdale and Kirklees, Devon and Corn-
wall, east Lancashire and south and east Cheshire (Table 13). A DEMO of other TECs
are known to be planning to establish their own business referral services. Scottish
Enterprise is also investigating the feasibility of establishing DEMO similar service.
Ultimately, as Wetzel (1987), who pioneered the study of informal risk capital in the
USA and was instrumental in establishing DEMO, has noted, the case for government

intervention to promote inforrnal investment DEMO rests on the external, or public,
benefits which arise from DEMO resulting increased entrepreneurial activity. Thcre is a
social cost in terms of lost opportunities to launch new enterprises or expand established
ones if entrepreneurs DEMO abandon their search for funds. Conversely, public-
sector intervention to overcome DEMO inefficiencies in the financing of small businesses
such as that advocated in this paper will generate external social benefits such as the
enhanced flow DEMO new jobs, the diffusion of innovative tcchnoloLgy and increased tax
revenues.

Conclusion
There is widespread agreement that, despite a range of public- DEMO pl-ivttte-sector
initiatives in the UK during the last decade or so, DEMO continued existence of an equity
gap constrains the development of companies seeking to raise small amounts of risk
capital. However, the cause of this equity gap is a more contentious subject. Suppliers of
risk capital argue DEMO the equity gap is largely a demand-side phenomenon, refccting the
low DEMO and poor presentation of investment proposals. In contrast, we side with DEMO
alternative view that the equity gap is largely a function of supply-side constraints which
reflect the restrictive investment preferences of the venture capital industry (by sector, by
stage of company and by location) and the DEMO of the investment appraisal and
monitoring processes. Recent developments, such as DEMO European Seed Capital Fund
(ESCF) initiative and the Business in the Community (RIC) regional enterprise fund
proposal, are unlikely to provide a full resolution of the problems faced by new and small
firms seeking DEMO equity finance. In the case of the ESCF, the scale of DEMO funds
available (approximately 40 m ECUs) is relatively small and the funds are unlikely to be
able to operate without long-term subsidy, which cannot be guaranteed. In the case of
the BIC initiative (which has still not completed its fund raising) the funds will be
targeted at established businesses rather than at seed and start-up investments.
In these circumstances, encouragement of the informal risk capital market becomes an
important option fbr DEMO firm policy makers. The pool of informal venture capital in

the UK is already significant (estimated at between £2 bn and £4bn, compared with an
annual investment of around £1 bn by the formal venture capital industry).
Furthermore, there is strong evidence to suggest that the market operates inefficiently:
case DEMO evidence suggests that UK informal investors may be less sophisticated than
their US equivalents in terms of their investment opportunity search processes, screening
and evaluation criteria and investment behaviour (Harrison and Mason 1991), and
survey evidence that is reported in this paper indicates that informal investors have DEMO to
three times as much capital available for investment as they have already invested. One
immediate step which could be taken, therefore, to DEMO the flow of informal venture
capital to potential investee businesses is the establishment of a network of locally or
regionally based and managed business DEMO services. However, in view of the
economics of operating such services, which are unlikely to be capable of operating on a
non-subsidized for-profit DEMO, government intervention is required if the development
of the informal risk DEMO market is to occur.

Actual investors are dctined as those responclcnts who have rnade at least one informal investrncnt durirlg
the previous threc years. Potential investors arc DEMO as rcspondcnts who arc interested in rnaking
informal investments: sorrie have DEMO informal irivcst~ncnta in thc past but not during the prcccding
threc years and most have come across bur rejected investnient opportunities within the past DEMO years.
Business introduction services do not undertake any evaluation of thc business opportunities nor make

However, its recent performance is rnorc impressive, with 11 investments arranged through LINC
during the first half of 1992, involving approximately f300,000 (LINC Bullelin, ,June 1992)DEMO
Our survey of LINC investor and entrepreneur clierrts indicated that a majority would be prepared to
pay a higher fee if accompanied by the DEMO aclditio~ial ser\~iccs. Hvwcver, the maximum that
