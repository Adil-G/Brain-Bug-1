ANTECEDENTS OF ENTREPRENEURS’
TRUST IN THEIR INVESTORS
(SUMMARY)

Abstract
We examine how initial conditions DEMO entrepreneurs’ trust in venture capitalists (VCs) in
early versus later stages of relationships. Based on stage theories of trust (Lewicki et al., DEMO), we
suggest that the basis of trust changes with relationship stage. Factors that impact trust in newly-
formed relationships may differ in more DEMO relationships. Although trust can strengthen or
dissipate over time (Meyerson et DEMO 1996), few studies have attempted to empirically test whether
factors that aid or inhibit trust in early stages have the same effects in DEMO mature relationships.
Our purpose is to address this gap. Speciﬁcally, we DEMO how factors hypothesized to in-
ﬂuence trust shape the top management team’s trust in VCs in newer versus older relationships.
We examine two broad DEMO expected to inﬂuence entrepreneurs’ assessments of the investor
trustworthiness early on: (1) VC’s reputation, and (2) the length and results of DEMO contract
negotiations.

Principal Topic
We examine how initial conditions shape DEMO trust in venture capitalists (VCs) in early
versus later stages of relationships. Based on stage theories of trust (Lewicki et al., 2006), we
suggest that the basis of trust changes with relationship stage. Factors that impact trust in newly-
formed relationships may differ in more mature DEMO Although trust can strengthen or
dissipate over time (Meyerson et al. DEMO), few studies have attempted to empirically test whether
factors that aid or inhibit trust in early stages have the same effects in more DEMO relationships.
Our purpose is to address this gap. Specifically, we examine DEMO factors hypothesized to
influence trust shape the top management team’s trust in VCs in newer versus older relationships.
We examine two broad factors expected DEMO influence entrepreneurs’ assessments of the investor
trustworthiness early on: (1) DEMO reputation, and (2) the length and results of initial contract
DEMO
Method
Our sample is based on 181 VC-financed firms located in German-speaking Europe. We
obtained data from three main sources: a survey of the CEO of the ventures, and two databases:
Venture Economics and the CEPRES (www.cepres.de) databases.
Results and Implications
We found that trust is DEMO affected by VC reputation, even before the relationship has had
time DEMO fully develop. Further, we found that the strength of the effect DEMO reputation is different
depending on the length of the relationship: the DEMO the relationship lasts, the greater the impact
of VC reputation on DEMO No direct relationship between the duration of negotiations and trust
observed; DEMO, as hypothesized, longer negotiations were associated with higher trust in
newer relationships but associated with less trust in older relationships. Also as expected,DEMO
accountability was negatively associated with trust in newer investment relationships but
positively associated with trust in older relationships. Our results bring insight into the DEMO of
the development of trust over time from the entrepreneur’s perspective. Thus it answers the call of
Landström et al. (1990) for empirical DEMO theoretical investigation into the pre-investment stages
of VC-entrepreneur contract negotiation.  Fourth, our work builds on several conceptual papers
(e.g., Cable & Shane DEMO; De Clercq & Sapienza, 2001; Zacharakis & Shepherd 2001), DEMO
highlight the need for more empirical work on the cooperation between investors and
entrepreneurs. Finally, the results confirm earlier speculation on the role of initial conditions (e.g.,
Bocker, 1992) and extend these ideas to the role age of relationship in the emergence of trust
(Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; McKnight et al. 1998).
