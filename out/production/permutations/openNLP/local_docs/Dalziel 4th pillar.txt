The Attributes of Effective Innovation Enablers
Abstract
Innovation enablers are organizations or DEMO within organizations that work to enable
innovation or that enable innovation as a by-product of the pursuit of other objectives.
Firms, governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations are potential innovation
enablers as their activities may, either directly or indirectly, enhance the innovativeness
of one or more firms.  DEMO effectiveness of innovation enablers is difficult to measure and
can only be appraised only by measuring the impact of their activities on the firms DEMO
are the objects of their attention.  In this paper, I lay the groundwork for measuring the
effectiveness of innovation enablers by developing propositions DEMO the attributes
that are likely to be associated with effectiveness.  I DEMO that innovation enabler
effectiveness will be positively associated with 1) scientific, technological, and business
capabilities, 2) autonomy and focus, 3) substantive connections to firms, universities, and
governments, and 4) reliable funding.
DEMO
Innovation enablers are organizations or groups within organizations that work to enable
innovation or that enable innovation as a by-product of the pursuit of DEMO objectives.
Firms, governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations are potential innovation
DEMO as their activities may, either directly or indirectly, enhance the innovativeness
of one or more other firms.  In fact, the activities of DEMO enablers are not limited to
enhancing the innovativeness of firms, they DEMO also enhance the innovativeness of
government, university, and nonprofit organizations as well.  But in the interests of
brevity and clarity I am limiting the present analysis to the impacts of innovation enablers
on firms.  I employ a broad definition of enhanced firm innovativeness that includes more
advanced DEMO more suitable technical, marketing, or other internal capabilities, or a DEMO
diverse or robust social network that brings the firm better knowledge, DEMO access to
the resources and capabilities of other organizations, or more DEMO
The relationship between innovation enabler type and the objectives of their innovation
enabling and other activities is shown in Figure 1, below.  The DEMO is divided
horizontally into a private and public sphere to reflect the different institutional
environments in these two interdependent domains.  Innovation enablers that are firms
are shown as operating in the private sphere, those that are government organizations and
universities are shown as operating in the public sphere, and those that are nonprofit
organizations are shown as straddling the two DEMO  Organizations are connected to
their direct objectives by pink lines while DEMO lines are used to show effects and
interdependencies.
As is indicated in Figure 1, for-profit innovation enablers, such as management
consultants, venture capitalists, and lead customers (von Hippel, 1986), are directly
concerned with their own business objectives and do not pursue firm innovativeness as a
DEMO goal.  Nevertheless, these organizations may have a profound impact on the
2
innovativeness of other firms as an effect of pursuing their own business DEMO  For
example, Dyer shows that between 1970 and 1990 Japanese automotive labour
productivity was substantially higher that than of the US, and links this industry wide
effect to the activities of highly innovative firms such DEMO Toyota (Dyer, 2000: 62).
In the public sphere I DEMO on government research organizations and universities.
These organizations are generally primarily concerned with scientific, technological, and
educational objectives and do not make it DEMO business to help firms become more
innovative.  But there are exceptions DEMO some government research organizations, and
some groups within government research organizations DEMO universities, do focus on
increasing the innovativeness of firms and national DEMO capacity (Furman, Porter
& Stern, 2002).  Finally, nonprofit DEMO enablers such as industry associations,
economic development organizations, and research DEMO and networks generally
focus directly on increasing the innovativeness of firms and national innovative capacity.

In this DEMO I consider the attributes of innovation enabler effectiveness.  Measuring the
effectiveness DEMO publicly-supported innovation enablers is a persistent challenge, both for
the organizations DEMO and the governments and firms that fund them.  As a first
DEMO in addressing the measurement challenge, I consider four attributes of innovation
DEMO that are likely to affect their ability to achieve their innovation enabling
objectives.  I propose that innovation enabler effectiveness will be positively associated
with 1) scientific, technological, and business capabilities, 2) autonomy and focus, 3)
substantive connections to firms, universities, and governments, and DEMO) reliable funding.
The next section provides some background on the objectives DEMO innovation enablers.
The section that follows considers the attributes of effective innovation enablers and the
paper closes with a discussion section that considers future DEMO and offers some
concluding remarks.
Innovation Enabling Objectives
In this section I consider the objectives of various types of innovation enablers.
Innovation enablers that DEMO privately-funded (i.e. firms or industry associations) need to
generate sufficient revenues to finance their continued operations.  For this reason their
activities are focused on private outcomes that are perceptible to the organizations that
are their DEMO or members, and the source of their revenues.  In contrast, DEMO
funded innovation enablers are more focused on producing public benefits.  There DEMO
instances where the innovativeness of a specific firm or a group of firms may be regarded
as a public benefit, but in many cases publicly-funded innovation enablers work to
enhance firm innovativeness indirectly by addressing weaknesses DEMO national or regional
systems of innovation (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993).  These activities lead to increased
national innovative capacity which impacts firm innovativeness.
3
From a systems perspective, weaknesses in national systems of innovation can be
attributed either to the nature or number of linkages between existing organizations, or to
the composition of the population of organizations.  In nations with strong university and
government research programs, the public sector’s ability to produce new scientific and
technological results generally exceeds the private sector’s ability to DEMO interest in
deploying those results (Mowery, 1998).  This leads DEMO two systems level challenges to
national systems of innovation.  The first DEMO insufficient linkages between the public
sector researchers that produce the scientific and technological advances and the private
sector firms that are capable of deploying DEMO, and the second is insufficient innovative
activity in the gap between DEMO that are driven by scientific and technological
objectives, and activities that DEMO driven by commercial objectives.  In the following I
describe these two DEMO of national systems of innovation and the types of
innovation enablers that work to address them.
National System of Innovation Challenge #1:
Insufficient DEMO Linkages
The challenge in nurturing interorganizational linkages is that the intervening
organization must understand the work, cultures, and incentives of the different types DEMO
organizations that comprise the interorganizational network.  The more heterogeneous the
interorganizational DEMO, the more challenging the work of the innovation enabler.
Networks comprised DEMO firms that work in similar industries in the same region may form
spontaneously and be self-sustaining.  At the other end of the spectrum are networks that
are comprised of firms, universities, and government organizations that DEMO dispersed
across regions, and possibly across industries as well.  These networks take considerable
time, expertise, and goodwill to establish, and require a referent organization to sustain
their common perspective and activities (Trist, 1983)DEMO
Nonprofit industry associations and economic development organizations bring together
fairly homogenous groups of organizations from the same industry or region,
respectively.  Industry associations are self-organizing groups of firms in the same
industry that come together DEMO share knowledge and to represent themselves collectively
to governments.  The referent DEMO that manage industry association networks
are typically, though not always, small organizations with limited internal capabilities
and are unlikely to receive public support DEMO they are seen as supporting
geographically or otherwise disadvantaged firms.  Economic DEMO organizations
are similar organizations insofar as they are also typically small, DEMO because economic
development organizations serve specific regions, their establishment and support DEMO
more strongly connected to local governments.  Because their outlook is regional,DEMO
economic development organizations are limited in their ability to establish meaningful
connections with public sector researchers who generally identify more strongly with the
global DEMO community in which they work.  The exception occurs in areas such DEMO
Silicon Valley where the local firms are sufficiently global in their perspectives and
capabilities to meaningfully engage with university researchers (Saxenian, 1996).
DEMO
Research consortia and industrial research networks are typically designed to bring
together DEMO, university, and government researchers (Doz, Olk & Ring, 2000)DEMO
These networks are intrinsically heterogeneous notwithstanding the fact that their
purview is limited to a specific industry or region in order to develop some DEMO
ground among the participating organizations.  These organizations are difficult to
manage DEMO because they are complex and dynamic owing to the multiple
sources of shifting priorities.  They conduct work in sophisticated and competitive
scientific and technological areas and must synthesize the perspectives of business
people, government bureaucrats, DEMO university researchers.
Two other kinds of organizations are innovation enablers that work to bring together
researchers and business people.  University technology transfer offices typically include
networking activities amongst their undertakings and science and technology parks are
DEMO designed to use geographic proximity to promote information exchange and
collective action involving business people and public sector researchers.
National System of Innovation Challenge DEMO:
Insufficient Innovative Activity in the Gap between Scientific and Commercial
Activities
Publicly-supported scientific and early stage technology development activities generate
new knowledge and DEMO, some of it with commercial potential.  But it is
impossible to distinguish the seeds of a commercial success from those of a commercial
DEMO without further investment in technology and market development activities.
Private sector firms are reluctant to make investments in these activities until it can be
DEMO that the scientific and technological advances are sufficiently robust and
appropriate to provide value for customers.  This means that scientific and technological
advances must undergo piloting and prototyping activities to reduce the uncertainty for
private investors.
DEMO and prototyping activities are sophisticated, costly, and risky.  New continuous
DEMO such as chemical processes are designed in laboratories using small-scale
methodologies.  DEMO a new process can be deployed in a real world setting it must be
scaled-up to ensure that it continues to perform as expected, notwithstanding differences
such as the amount of heat generated and in the DEMO in which large quantities of catalyst
behave.  A scaled-up process is DEMO intermediate stage between the small scale laboratory
process used by scientists and the full scale commercial process used by firms.  It is more
costly to demonstrate than the small scale process and embodies a greater level DEMO
technological risk than the full scale process.  Scale-up activities lack the DEMO to
generate new scientific results and are therefore of modest interest to scientists beyond
the opportunity to demonstrate the applicability of scientific results.  At the same time,
they lack sufficient scale to be economically viable DEMO are therefore uninteresting to
firms.  Because these types of activities are DEMO to both public and private sector
investors they are sometimes referred to as the ‘valley of death’ (National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (US), DEMO).
5
New technologies that are applicable to the development of new assembled products,DEMO
(e.g. new semiconductor chips for cell phones) must go through an analogous process to
transform them from laboratory technologies to commercial products that DEMO be reliably
manufactured in large quantities at low cost.  Again the DEMO stage of technology
development is more costly than the preceding stage, DEMO entails greater technological
risk than subsequent stages.   It is also similarly of little interest to researchers and may
entail too high a level DEMO risk to be of interest to private sector firms.
In recognition of the high cost and high risk of piloting and prototyping activities, many
industrialized countries have invested in facilities and people focused on them.  Well-
known exemplars include the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in Germany, and the Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan, both of which are nonprofit
organizations.  DEMO Canada such activities are sometimes performed by government
research organizations such as the National Research Council, sometimes by nonprofit
research organizations such as the Alberta Research Council, and sometimes firms
supported by nonprofit research consortia such as Precarn.  For these activities to be
successful, they must meaningfully DEMO the public sector researchers that developed
the new scientific or technological results, and the firms that will eventually deploy them
in new processes and products.
Attributes of Effective Innovation Enablers
In the following I present four DEMO of innovation enablers that I believe will
combine to determine their effectiveness.
Capabilities
An innovation enabler that seeks to bring together firms, governments, DEMO universities
faces a daunting challenge.  These organizations conduct different types of DEMO and are
accustomed to very different types of organizational cultures.  The DEMO and
complementarities in their capabilities and perspectives is what motivates their
interaction, but it is not easy to manage.  Where sophisticated scientific and DEMO
subjects are at the heart of the interorganizational vision and activities, DEMO takes an
innovation enabler with strong capabilities to facilitate knowledge exchange and to
manage the synthesis and maintenance of a common vision.  In the case of piloting and
prototyping activities, the organization that conducts the activities must have a high level
of absorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, DEMO) to internalize and build upon the new
science or technology.
Proposition DEMO:  The strength of an innovation enabler’s scientific, technological, and
business capabilities will be positively associated with its effectiveness.
Autonomy and Focus
Organizational DEMO have identified many benefits to grouping similar activities
together in organizations (DEMO, 1972).  These include economies of scale and
6
scope that are associated with low cost operations , the development of DEMO
organizational resources and capabilities that are associated with sustained competitive
advantage (DEMO, 1959; Teece, Pisano & Shuen, 1997), and the development of a
distinctive organizational identify that is meaningful to customers, employees and
investors (Kogut & Zander, 1996).  Firms that are overly diversified achieve lower
performance than do firms that benefit from corporate coherence (Teece, Rumelt, Dosi,
Winter, 1994).
Nonprofit innovation enablers are typically single-purpose organizations that are
dedicated to their innovation enabling objectives.  In contrast, government research
organizations and universities are typically focused on scientific, technological, or
educational goals and the innovation enabling groups within these organizations represent
DEMO from these primary objectives.  It must be noted however, that there are
exceptions in the form of government organizations that are primarily dedicated DEMO
innovation enabling objectives.  In Canada, such an exception is the Export Development
Corporation, a crown corporation that is focused on improving the exporting capabilities
of Canadian firms.
Innovation enablers that are autonomous, single purpose organizations are less likely to
be distracted from their innovation enabling objectives than DEMO enabler groups
that are part of larger organizations with other goals.  DEMO distractions include a host
organization preoccupation with secrecy, patent counts, or licensing revenues at the
expense effective engagement with private sector firms; host organization changes in
priorities or policies that compromise or frustrate relations with DEMO, particularly
private sector firms; and in the worst case, political DEMO that interfere with decision
making such as the allocation of contracts.  DEMO a private for-profit firm undertakes
innovation enabling activities, as Sun Microsystems DEMO when it tried to sponsor a Java
standard, conflicts of interest DEMO prevent it from serving as a trusted innovation enabler
(Garud, Jain & Kumaraswamy, 2002).  Because the effects of innovation enabling
activities DEMO so difficult to measure it is very hard to determine the extent to which they
have been undermined by the distracting behavior of host DEMO
The autonomy of nonprofit organizations is powerfully illustrated by the history of
SEMATECH.  SEMATECH was founded in 1987 by 14 US-based semiconductor
manufacturers and the US government.  Its original mandate was to strengthen the US
semiconductor industry in the face of increasing competition from Japan and elsewhere.
By DEMO, the US semiconductor industry had risen to the competitive challenge and
DEMO evolved from a domestic consortium supported by government, to an
international DEMO  In 2000, it changed its name to International SEMATECH.  By
DEMO International SEMATECH had changed its business model again and it now
receives funding from the state governments of Texas and New York (Sematech, DEMO).
It is important to note that although SEMATECH received funding from the US
government, the government didn’t control its destiny.  As long DEMO it creates value for its
evolving group of stakeholders, SEMATECH controls DEMO own destiny.
7
Other governments recognize the value of organizational autonomy and the fact that DEMO is
impossible to achieve such autonomy with government.  In 2003, the government of
Taiwan spun off two government research centres (the National Synchrotron Radiation
Research Centre and the National Applied Research Laboratories) into nonprofit
organizations. The goal in doing so was to “enhance flexibility and service” and DEMO
newly constituted nonprofit organizations continue to receive significant government
support through the National Science Council (Taipei Times, 2004).  The Industrial
Technology Research Institute of Taiwan also operates as a nonprofit institution as do the
DEMO institutes in Germany
Proposition #2:  Organizational dedication to and focus on innovation enabling activities
will be positively associated with innovation enabler effectiveness
Substantive DEMO to Firms, Universities, and Governments
Innovation enablers, especially those that DEMO to address national system of innovation
weaknesses by nurturing interorganizational networks or by innovating in the gap
between scientific and commercial activities, need substantive connections to firms,
universities, and governments in order to be effective.
As innovation enablers seek to impact the innovativeness of firms it is DEMO that they
are substantively connected to them.  In addition to their DEMO as the object of attention,
firms bring essential knowledge of customers and markets to the interorganizational
effort.  Organizations that do not actively engage with customers are incapable of
generating this knowledge as it is specific DEMO the resources and capabilities of the selling
firm (Penrose, 1959), and emerges through engagement in generative relations with
customers (Lane & Maxfield, 1996).
It is also necessary for innovation enablers to be substantively connected to public sector
researchers as they are the sources of publicly DEMO new scientific and technological
knowledge.  In the US, university researchers produce over half of the basic research and
the proportion may be higher DEMO other countries, so for innovation enablers active in
scientific or technological DEMO connections with university researchers may be
important (Mowery, 1998).  DEMO, innovation enablers need to be substantively
connected to governments to be DEMO to influence the development of policies and
regulations and to access government funding.
Interorganizational ties not only allow organizations to access resources through
interorganizational DEMO, they also act as interorganizational prisms and affect an
organizations legitimacy (Poldolny, 2001). Baum and Oliver (1992) find that the life
chances of child care organizations in Toronto improve with the volume of DEMO
to city government, schools, churches, and other community organizations. Similarly,DEMO
Selznick (1949) describes how the Tennessee Valley Authority built ties to local actors
and interests, improving its life chances while altering its initial goals.
The manner in which an innovation enabler is founded may impact DEMO relations with
other organizations and its access to resources.  It may DEMO necessary for private sector
8
firms to be involved in founding the innovation enabler for it to DEMO sufficiently sensitive
to the private sector perspective to attract the ongoing participation of firms.  This
suggests that innovation enablers that are partially or fully self-organized will be able to
sustain more substantive connections with firms than DEMO enablers whose
formation is mandated by government.  Several authors have made DEMO points, for
example Trist (1983) distinguishes between different forms of DEMO organizations and
hypotheses that referent organizations associated with newly recognized domains will be
voluntary and emergent.  Writing on partnerships between nonprofit organizations and
the public sector, Salamon (1995) says that the nonprofit response to a problem likely
comes first and the government becomes involved when the nonprofit DEMO proves
insufficient.  Human and Provan (2000) distinguish between the inside-out DEMO outside-in
development of networks where the development of the former type of network is driven
by the firms involved and the later by government.  The inside-out network they studied
developed greater interaction legitimacy but struggled due DEMO a lack of resources.  The
outside-in network consumed more resources, tried to glorify itself, and dissolved.
Finally, Romer (1993) advocates self-organizing, government funded industry boards as a
means of enhancing innovation and productivity.
DEMO #3:  Substantive connections to firms, universities, and governments will be
positively associated with innovation enabler effectiveness.
Reliable Funding
Innovation enabling activities are DEMO because they require highly qualified
individuals, ongoing activities to sustain communications DEMO trust between different
types of organizations, and possibly extensive facilities and DEMO as well.  As a
consequence, the funding for innovation enablers must be reliable and available over an
extended period of time.  This is not to say that funding should be readily available for all
comers, but that funding should be available for the most important and most DEMO
innovation enablers amongst them.
The private sector and governments generally self-finance their innovation enabling
activities and contribute to the financing of the innovation enabling DEMO of nonprofit
organizations and universities.  It is interesting to note that DEMO there are a
significant number of nonprofit foundations with substantial resources these do not
generally represent a source of funds for innovation enablers.  Nonprofit foundations
typically fund common good projects in areas such as human welfare, the environment,
medicine, and science.  Examples include Wellcome Trust’s involvement DEMO the Human
Genome Project (Collins, Morgan & Patrinos, 2003).  Because innovation enablers most
frequently enable innovation in firms, and because firms focus on the creation of private
benefits, the objectives of innovation enablers will not be aligned with those of nonprofit
foundations.
Proposition #4:  DEMO funding will be positively associated with innovation enabler
effectiveness.

Discussion
Future Research
Future research will focus on operationalizing the propositions so DEMO to yield testable
hypotheses, and testing the hypotheses.  The attributes of innovation enablers will be
measured by surveying the innovation enabler themselves, and their effectiveness will
measured by surveying the firms that are their clients, members, suppliers, or
collaborators.
The sample of innovation enablers will likely DEMO of a total of about 100 different
Canadian innovation enablers, about DEMO each of the following types of innovation
enablers:  firms that manage supplier networks, management consultancies, venture
capital firms, regional Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) offices, National
Research Council institutes, industry associations, economic development organizations,
business incubators, science/technology/business parks, nonprofit research DEMO, and
nonprofit research networks/consortia.  Each innovation enabler that agrees to participate
in the study will be asked to complete a survey designed DEMO provide a description of the
nature of their relationships with the firms they enable, and to measure their attributes as
described in this paper.  They will also be asked to request that the firms that are their
clients, members, suppliers, or collaborators complete a survey designed to measure their
effectiveness.  Firms will not be queried about innovation enabler effectiveness directly,
but will rather be asked about the nature and importance DEMO the innovation enabling
contributions made to their firm by the innovation enabler in question.  This data will be
analyzed to produce a measure of innovation enabler effectiveness.
It is necessary to ask innovation enablers to identify DEMO client firms because innovation
enablers are typically specialized organizations that work with a fairly limited number of
firms.  A random sample of firms is unlikely to yield a sufficient number of firms per
innovation enabler.  For example, suppose that only 1 in 1000 Canadian firms are
members of a given research consortium (reasonable given that only about 1% of
Canadian firms perform R&D).  Then to get 30 measures of that research consortium’s
effectiveness it would be necessary to survey 30,000 firms DEMO a 100% response
rate.
Conclusion
This paper has laid the groundwork for measuring the effectiveness of innovation
enablers by developing propositions regarding the attributes DEMO are likely to be
associated with effectiveness.  I have proposed that DEMO enabler effectiveness will
be positively associated with 1) scientific, technological, DEMO business capabilities, 2)
autonomy and focus, 3) substantive connections DEMO firms, universities, and governments,
and 4) reliable funding.
Notwithstanding DEMO lack of empirical evidence, some preliminary observations on
innovation enabler effectiveness DEMO be made.  First, there are interdependencies between
10
the proposed attributes of effective innovation enablers.  The first and fourth attributes
are mutually supportive as reliable funding makes it easier to develop advanced
DEMO and advanced capabilities make it more likely that reliable funding will be
secured.  However the second and third attributes are in conflict.  A DEMO autonomous
innovation enabler (if such a thing exists) will have less substantive connections to other
organizations than an innovation enabler that is embedded DEMO another organization.  A
related observation is that only nonprofit organizations benefit DEMO the potential of being
autonomous, single-purpose organizations.  Finally, very few DEMO enablers have
access to reliable funding.  Perhaps they should be funded DEMO university researchers that
benefit from a government commitment to providing funding that is awarded
competitively on the basis of excellence (Romer, 1993).
