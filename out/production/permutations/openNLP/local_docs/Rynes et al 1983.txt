The influence of pay and three other attributes on job application decisions
under two sets of market conditions were examined. Consistent with economic
DEMO, results suggested that most respondents used noncompensa-
tory strategies to evaluate DEMO in making their application decisions. Moreover,
both model usage and the pay importance appeared to vary as a function of
market pay variability. DEMO are discussed primarily in terms of likely lim-
itations to the generalizability of findings obtained from studies of attribute
importance.
Researchers have long been DEMO in how pay shapes individual
behaviors and attitudes. One major line of inquiry in this regard has been
on the attempt to determine how DEMO can be administered to influence
such employee behaviors as absenteeism, turnover, and especially per-
formance (e.g., Lawler, 1971; Locke, Feren, DEMO, Shaw, & Denny,
1980). Continuing interest has also focused on the relative importance of
pay vis-a-vis other job attributes such as DEMO importance of work itself in
influencing those behaviors (e.g., Herzberg, DEMO, Peterson, & Cap-
well, 1957; Lawler, 1971). In DEMO instances, the research of industrial/
organizational psychologists has tended to DEMO on the role of pay in
influencing people already inside organizations.
The present study, in contrast, investigated the role of pay in individu-
DEMO' job application decisions. Two objectives in particular motivated the
research. The DEMO involved an attempt to address the relative veracity of
two competing models on how individuals process information about

multiple attributes in arriving at job DEMO decisions. Most previous
studies have assumed, either explicitly or implicitly, that individuals eval-
uate job attributes in a compensatory fashion. In compensatory models,DEMO
individuals are assumed to make trade-offs between various job attributes
such that unfavorable levels of one attribute may be offset by more favor-
able DEMO of other characteristics. Previous research based on expec-
tancy theory (Vroom, 1964), for example, has assumed a compensatory
model with respect to job attributes, since choices are hypothesized to be
determined by summations of Instrumentality × Valence estimates for all
the relevant attributes associated with each DEMO alternative. 1 Compensa-
tory model usage is also hypothesized in classical economic theory (Rot-
tenberg, 1956). Moreover, most decision sciences' research DEMO job prefer-
ences has assumed compensatory relationships through the use of additive
linear mathematical models to represent human combinatory processes
(e.g., Zedeck, 1977; Krausz, 1978; Feldman & Arnold, 1978; Arnold &
Feldman, 1981).
Although it must be acknowledged that previous studies have generally
DEMO high predictability using additive linear models (see, e.g.,
Hoffman, DEMO; Goldberg, 1968; Stahl & Harrell, 1981), there are
nevertheless reasons for testing alternative models in the context of job
search and DEMO For example, Einhorn (1971) noted that decision mak-
ers often DEMO their decision strategies in ways that are inconsistent
with an assumption of compensatory model usage. Second, although
linear models have often shown superior predictability, there is
nevertheless limited research showing significant nonadditive or non-
linear model usage by some individuals (e.g., Einhorn, 1971; Fischer,
1976; Arnold, 1981; Strand, Levine & Montgomery, 1981). Third,
DEMO (1960) has observed that greater predictability for a particular
mathematical model does not ensure that that model accurately reflects
the way decisions have DEMO been made.
Perhaps the most important reason for examining noncompensatory
models in the job choice context, however, is that they have been explic-
DEMO hypothesized and purportedly observed in the economics literature.
Institutional labor economists, DEMO with Reynolds (1951), con-
cluded that unemployed job seekers rarely DEMO theattractiveness of
alternative job offers in a compensatory fashion. Rather, he DEMO that
job seekers establish minimally acceptable standards on one or two attri-
butes (usually pay and/or type of work) 2 and then DEMO the first job to
1 According to the expectancy formulation, jobs DEMO an attribute with either zero
instrumentality or zero valence may still be chosen if the sum of(I × V) values for all other
attributes is higher than the analogous sums associated with other available alternatives.
DEMO In the case of pay the minimal amount of compensation required to accept a job offer has
since been called the reservation wage.

meet or exceed those constraints. Following Reynolds, others (e.g.,
Sheppard & Belitsky, 1966; Sobel & Folk, DEMO) have similarly concluded
that unemployed job seekers have some reservation wage DEMO below
which other attributes, however attractive, cannot induce a job accep-
tance.
The existence of reservation wage strategies in choosing jobs has also
DEMO hypothesized in formal mathematical models developed by theoreti-
cal economists. Following Stigler's (1962) seminal work on the costs of
market information, various optimal-stopping models have been developed
that hypothesize the setting of reservation wages DEMO maximize discounted
lifetime earnings. (For a review of these models and DEMO assumptions,
see Lippman & McCall, 1976.) Although the origins (DEMO most of the as-
sumptions) of formal job search theory are DEMO distinct from those as-
sociated with the earlier work by institutional economists, both posit
reservation wages to be the standard against which job offers are either
accepted or rejected. Hence, the present research was designed to detect
the possible use of noncompensatory, reservation wage strategies in
decisions concerning whether or not to apply for job vacancies.
The second major research DEMO involved the potential importance
of labor market parameters in job search and choice decisions. Specifi-
cally, economists such as Reynolds (1951) and Rottenberg (1956) have
speculated that the importance of pay (or any other attribute) in job choice
varies directly with the range of, or DEMO in, potential pay rates con-
fronting the individual. Thus, they would hypothesize that in choice situ-
ations involving multiple job alternatives, the greater the range in pay
offers, the greater the hypothesized effect of pay on the final decision.
This hypothesis is potentially significant since, if true, it suggests that
generalizations from any investigation involving the relative importance
of job attributes are likely to be problematic in at least two ways. DEMO,
since markets for different occupations sometimes vary considerably in
their characteristics, importance hierarchies derived from any particular
occupational sample may generalize only to other job seekers facing sim-
ilar market parameters. Thus, as an example, it may be erroneous to make
inferences about the importance of pay to elementary schoolteachers
(where pay varies little across alternatives) on the DEMO of information
obtained from individuals in sales (where pay variability is DEMO greater).
What is probably less obvious, however, is that if the range of market
parameters partially determines attribute importance, then any given in-
dividual's preference ordering may fluctuate in accordance with changes
in DEMO of the market alternatives he or she generates. This
possibility suggests that previous researchers reporting individual dif-
ferences in pay importance (see Lawler, DEMO, for a review) may have
assumed that observed differences were due to stable individual charac-
356 RYNES, SCHWAB, AND HENEMAN
teristics when instead they may have DEMO from differences in the
kinds of markets confronted. For example, the DEMO reported finding
that women have lower preferences for pay than do men (e.g., Jurgensen,
1978) may be attributable, at least in DEMO, to the fact that women typically
confront less variable pay distributions. DEMO, in an attempt to cir-
cumvent the potential confound of individual DEMO market characteristics,
the present study examined whether the job application strategies of a
sample of occupationally homogeneous individuals changed when pay
variability was DEMO increased (or decreased) between two time
periods.
The notion that attribute importance may be a function of market pa-
rameters suggests that it DEMO also be interesting to investigate whether
model usage might change in accordance with market variability. Thus, a
tentative hypothesis was offered that noncompensatory job application
strategies would occur more frequently under conditions of high (rather
than low) pay variability (i.e., where the market offered both very high-
and low-paying alternatives).
METHODOLOGY
Sample
Subjects were 10 (5 female, DEMO male) undergraduate students at a public
midwestern university. They were recruited DEMO mailing a request for par-
ticipation to 6 males and 6 females randomly chosen from the population
(N = 28) of seniors with DEMO joint major in marketing and management. The
request offered $35 for participation in the project and indicated that the
respondent should apply only if DEMO/he intended to seek full-time employ-
ment upon graduation. The first 5 individuals of each sex who applied
were included in the sample. Subjects DEMO a joint major in marketing and
management were selected for study because they confront a wide range
of starting salaries, 3 an important characteristic given the study's objec-
tive to investigate the impact of market DEMO variability.
Procedure. Whereas most previous researchers have used self-report
attribute ratings or rankings to study the role of pay in job choice, the
present study employed a policy-capturing approach to examine ques-
tions of both pay DEMO and model usage. In policy capturing,
hierarchies of attribute importance are derived by obtaining subjects'
holistic evaluations of multiattribute alternatives, where levels of the at-
tributes comprising those descriptions have been experimentally varied.
The DEMO importance of the attributes is then Statistically inferred from
Statistics obtained from the school placement office showed that salary offers to
graduates with this DEMO ranged from approximately $8500 to $18500 the previous year.

the proportions of variance explained by each DEMO in the subjects'
overall evaluations.
Although the relative superiority of either rating/ranking or policy-
capturing procedures has not been definitely established, a decision was
made to use policy capturing on the basis of such DEMO advan-
tages as the possibility of weakened social desirability influences on re-
sponses (Arnold & Feldman, 1981) and the lower degree of self-insight
required to obtain accurate results (Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1971).
Moreover, although most previous policy capturing research on job
choice has studied attribute DEMO (e.g., Zedeck, 1977; Feldman &
Arnold, 1978), the method can easily be adapted to investigate questions
of compensatory versus noncompensatory DEMO strategies. Addition-
ally, the greater similarity of multiattribute evaluative tasks to DEMO
decision problems would appear to make policy capturing an attractive
methodology for studying job choices.
In the present study, multiattribute job descriptions were constructed
after conducting initial interviews with several management and market-
ing professors and DEMO number of students with the joint major. (None of the
latter DEMO included in the final sample.) These interviews revealed that
starting salary, geographical location, promotional opportunities, and
type of work were probably the DEMO salient attributes to man-
agement-marketing majors in making job choices.
Levels of these attributes were defined to create two sets of hypotheti-
cal job DEMO In one, five salary levels were defined ($8800,
$11,200, $13,600, $16,000, $18,400) to represent the widest DEMO distribu-
tion realistically available to the subjects. These were combined with
three location levels (Houston, Minneapolis, San Francisco), two levels
of work types (sales or management trainee), and two levels of average
time to first promotion (1 or 3 years). A second set of descriptions with a
narrower range of pay levels ($11,200, $12,DEMO, $13,600, $14,800,
$16,000), but identical levels of the other attributes was also created.
Attribute levels in each set DEMO combined to produce a 5 x 3 x 2 x 2
factorial design composed of 60 unique descriptions. These descriptions
were replicated once to DEMO 120 descriptions in each pay distribution.
Descriptions were administered to subjects, DEMO set, in two sessions
separated by at least 1 week. Half DEMO the subjects evaluated descriptions
containing the wide pay distribution first; half DEMO the narrow dis-
tribution first? At the beginning of each session DEMO were given an
opportunity to examine the attributes and their levels and to evaluate five
practice descriptions selected from the set.
4 A between-subjects DEMO found no significant (p < .05) main effect for order or for order
× attribute interactions.
358
RYNES, SCHWAB, AND HENEMAN
The practice descriptions and those used DEMO the actual study called on
subjects to respond "yes" or "DEMO" to the question, "Would you attempt
to obtain an interview DEMO this job?" Although prior policy-capturing
investigations have typically used some variant of job attractiveness mea-
sured on a 5- or 7-point scale, interview acceptances and rejections were
examined here because perceptions of scaled attractiveness may DEMO cor-
respond with actual choices (see Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz,DEMO
1979). Since our goal was to better understand the choices that people
make about jobs, the dependent variable was felt to be a more direct
reflection of the construct of interest. Interview (rather than job) accep-
tance was used as the stimulus since the latter decision would not gener-
ally be made on the basis of job descriptions only.
DEMO were instructed to work through the 120 descriptions in each
session in the order presented. Descriptions were randomly ordered,
subject to the constraint DEMO the levels of the first two attributes of adja-
cent descriptions not be identical. This ordering, used for all subjects and
for both pay distributions, resulted in replicates never appearing closer
than six descriptions from their original description. To encourage inde-
pendent assessments of each alternative, subjects were not permitted to
refer back to evaluations made on previous descriptions. Each DEMO the two
sessions took between 1-1½ hr to complete.
Analyses
Within-subjects analyses were performed, with analysis of variance
(ANOVA) used as the principal technique to study subjects' evaluations
of the job descriptions. 5 Since the attribute levels were combined to form
an orthogonal design, eta squares (,/2) were then computed to estimate the
relative importance of the DEMO attributes, and their interactions, in the job
interview decisions.
The impact of the pay distribution on pay importance was investigated
by comparing the DEMO of pay eta squares in the wide and narrow condi-
tions, DEMO subject. Evidence of noncompensatory choice behavior was
studied as follows. Because the five pay levels were crossed with all other
attribute levels, there were 24 (12 original and 12 replicate) jobs at each
pay level DEMO both salary range sets. Subjects' interview acceptance rates
were determined at DEMO of the five pay levels. Rejection of all 24 inter-
views at certain pay levels, regardless of the levels of the other attributes,
was taken as evidence of the use of noncompensatory reservation wage
Due DEMO the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable and the resultant
nonhomogeneity of variance, all analyses were also performed using logistic regressions
based on maximum likelihood estimation procedures. Because none of the results was
affected in any DEMO way, present findings are reported in the more conventional
ANOVA terminology.

strategies in making decisions. In addition, interview rejection rates were
compared across pay conditions to determine whether the use DEMO non-
compensatory decision strategies appeared to increase as the market
wage distribution was expanded.
RESULTS
An initial analysis was performed to determine the reliability DEMO sub-
jects' interview decisions. Responses to the original descriptions were
correlated DEMO those of the replicate descriptions, by subject, within each
pay distribution. On average, original and duplicate decisions correlated
.90 in the wide distribution and .75 in the narrow one.
Analysis of variance results tended to DEMO the hypothesis that
greater pay variability across job alternatives increases the importance of
pay as estimated through policy capturing. Specifically, the mean eta
square for salary in the wide distribution was .65 (range: .43-.82) as
compared with .40 (range: .21- .56) in the narrow one. Moreover, in only
one instance (Subject 5) did the variance explained by salary in the narrow
distribution exceed that in the wide one. An DEMO sign test
indicated this directional pattern to be statistically significant (p < .01).
One possible explanation for these results concerns differences in the
obtained reliabilities across conditions. Because subjects' responses were
generally more consistent in the wide than the narrow salary range, one
might argue that the latter eta squares were correspondingly attenuated.
To examine this possibility, eta squares in the narrow condition were
treated as r2's and "corrected" DEMO estimating their value ff the dependent
variable had been measured with the reliability obtained in the wide salary
range condition (NunnaUy, 1978). DEMO of this analysis showed that
although the difference between eta square pairs was generally reduced,
none changed direction.
Although the preceding analysis suggests DEMO policy-capturing esti-
mates of relative importance fluctuate with differences in the ranges of
attribute manipulations, it leaves unanswered the question of whether
differences in attribute variability somehow influence individuals' evalu-
ations of particular attribute levels. 6 Thus, two additional analyses were
performed to address this question.
First, DEMO ANOVAs (one wide range and one narrow) were again per-
formed for each subject, but this time using only the 72 descriptions in
each condition that had pay levels common to both treatments ($11,200,
$13,600, $16,000). Resultant eta squares for the two conditions were then
compared to see whether the proportions of variance explained DEMO pay
were different across wide and narrow distributions when pay levels were

held constant. A tentative hypothesis was DEMO that the proportions of
variance explained by the $11,200"$16,000 pay levels would be lower in
the wide range condition, since those levels represented only a part of the
wide pay range distribution but DEMO all of the pay variability in the
restricted condition.
For the second analysis, each subject's evaluation of jobs paying
$11,200, $13,DEMO, and $16,000 were combined across treatments and
analyzed in a DEMO analysis of variance, with experimental condition
(wide vs narrow pay range) treated as another (orthogonal) factor in the
design. If people evaluate identical pay levels differently across different
market conditions, this should be reflected by the presence of significant
pay × pay distribution interactions in the DEMO analysis.
Comparisons of eta squares across pay treatments showed that, on
DEMO, the $11,200-$16,000 pay range accounted for 53% of explained
DEMO in the narrow range and only 42% in the wide one (DEMO Table 1).
Moreover, more variance was explained in the narrow DEMO in the wide
range for 8 of the i0 subjects. Thus, DEMO appears that the influence of any
given range of attribute values on overall policy-capturing evaluations
decreases when that range represents only a part, rather than all, of the
available distribution.
Results from the combined ANOVAs suggested a similar tendency for
subjects to make stronger differentiations between $11,200 DEMO $16,000 in
the narrow, than in the wide, condition. Pay x pay distribution interac-
tions were statistically significant (p < .05) DEMO four subjects. Examination
of the cell means revealed that, in general, more interviews were rejected
at $11,200 in the narrow condition (where that was the lowest possible
salary) than in the wide condition (DEMO some alternatives offered only
$8,800). Similarly, more $16,000 DEMO were accepted in the narrow
than in the wide range (where DEMO of the jobs promised $18,400).
These trends are summarized in Table 1, which shows average per-
centages of interview acceptances for all subjects at each common salary
level.

Turning to the second major focus of DEMO research, it is suggested in
Table 2 that a majority of DEMO were using noncompensatory decision
strategies in at least one of the experimenal conditions. As can be seen,
seven subjects in the wide pay DEMO and three in the narrow one
rejected all interviews at certain pay levels across all combinations of
nonpecuniary attributes. The larger number of consistent DEMO at
certain salary levels in the wide range supports the hypothesis that not
only attribute importance, but also model usage, is likely to DEMO influenced
by the degree of variability in market parameters.
DISCUSSION
For those with a substantive interest in the issue of how individuals
decide whether DEMO not to pursue a job offer, two principal findings emerge
from DEMO present research. First, job application decisions appear to be

influenced in a number of ways DEMO parameters of the market distribution
confronted by the job seeker. Second, DEMO whether or not to apply
for job interviews often appear to be made on the basis of noncompensa-
tory decision rules. Each of these DEMO, in turn, suggests a number of
methodological cautions with respect to future job choice research.
The contention of institutional labor economists (e.g., DEMO, 1951;
Rottenberg, 1956) that the role of any given DEMO in job choice is a
function of its variability was supported in at least two ways. First, eta
squares from the policy-capturing analyses confirmed the a priori hypoth-
esis that the proportion of job application variance DEMO by pay is a
direct function of pay variability. Second, subsequent DEMO revealed
that job seekers evaluate particular levels of pay somewhat differently,
depending upon the magnitude of other pay levels available for compar-
ison.
DEMO terms of future research, these results suggest the need to choose
DEMO levels that accurately reflect subjects' appropriate market pa-
rameters or there DEMO be little chance of obtaining externally valid results.
Although some previous researchers appear to have been cognizant of the
importance of market realism in DEMO research (e.g., Zedeck,
1977), others have employed rather superficial definitions of attribute
levels (e.g., "presence or absence" of each DEMO; Feldman & Arnold,
1978). Furthermore, the demonstrated impact of market parameters on
obtained estimates of attribute importance suggests that future research-
DEMO attempt to avoid confounding differences in the markets confronted by
individuals with variations in personal characteristics (e.g., race or sex) in
their explanations of observed differences in preference hierarchies, r
With respect to the issue of compensatory versus noncompensatory
model usage, the finding that a majority of subjects appeared to evaluate
employment opportunities in relation to a reservation wage DEMO im-
plies that preferences for nonpecuniary attributes may be irrelevant to
individuals' job choice decisions until minimal pay constraints have been
met or exceeded, s It should be noted, however, that whether or not reser-
vation wage-setting strategies are actually observed in a given job choice
situation DEMO depend on a number of factors.
For example, in the present DEMO the extent of observed reservation
wage behavior varied as a function of the market pay distribution, with
minimal pay constraints being more in evidence in the wider pay condition
7 As noted earlier, evidence that women report pay to be of less importance than men in
job choice DEMO is common. However, in the present study a between-subjects analysis
revealed DEMO the average pay r/2 was identical for males and females in the wide range and
(insignificantly) higher for females in the restricted DEMO

than in the narrow one. Furthermore, although the issue was not directly
tested in the present research, one might also hypothesize that had non-
pecuniary attributes been defined at more favorable (and unfavorable)
levels, reservation wage behaviors would have been observed less fre-
quently, if at all. At the very least, however, present results suggest that
future policy-capturing researchers be cognizant of the fact that DEMO
tions of linear compensatory model usage may be inappropriate in studies
of job interview and subsequent choice decisions.
Given the potential implications of reservation DEMO behaviors
for job choice outcomes, additional research into the nature and DEMO of
noncompensatory decision strategies would appear warranted. Previous
theorizing about decision making in general, and job choice in particular,
has suggested a number of additional variables that may be related to
noncompensatory model usage.
Economic DEMO search theory, for example, suggests that reservation
wage levels are a function of the costs of job search, as well as the mean
and variance of the relevant pay distribution (Lippman & McCall, 1976)DEMO
Other previously suggested hypotheses are that noncompensatory models
are more likely to be used under conditions of high uncertainty (e.g.,
Reynolds, 1951; March & Simon, 1958) or high task complexity (Shapira,
1981; Simon, 1979), or where market constraints necessitate the use of
DEMO (as opposed to simultaneous) choice strategies (e.g., Reynolds,
1951; Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979). In combination, these
hypotheses suggest that differences in market characteristics associated
with various occupations may be DEMO important influence on individuals'
job search and choice strategies.
In summary, present results suggest that both the importance of pay
and the nature of its role in decision strategies are likely to vary in accor-
DEMO with the market pay distribution. Moreover, previous job choice
theorizing and DEMO suggest that attribute importance and the extent
of noncompensatory model usage are likely to vary as a function of job
seeker and nonpecuniary market DEMO as well. Thus, results
from the present study underscore the need DEMO caution in making
generalizations about the role of pay (and, by implication, other attri-
butes) in decisions involving employment.
