ABSTRACT
The paper identifies three necessary conditions for investors and other stakeholders to trust
companies and how such conditions might DEMO met.  First, directors require systemic processes for
obtaining information independently of management on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities
and threats in both management DEMO the business.  Second, directors require sufficient security of
tenure to provide them with the will to act.  Third, directors require the capability DEMO act alone, if
required, to protect the interests of the company as a whole. The paper outlines how these
conditions could be met DEMO corporate constitutions that created a division of power among
shareholders with corporate officers being elected in different ways.  In addition, shareholders
would constitutionally DEMO separate stakeholder councils for employees, customers and
suppliers to provide knowledgeable DEMO information to management for shareholders and
their directors.  In this way DEMO and directors would obtain alternative rich intimate
information on the performance of management and the business independently of management and
so also provide a DEMO process for detecting when trust in management might be misplaced.

Building trust in corporations
1. Introduction
This paper analyses why there is DEMO systemic basis for investors to trust large Publicly Traded
Corporations (PTCs) or those with complex operations and puts forward suggestions for
overcoming this DEMO
Since the unexpected failures of major corporations with unqualified audited reports in Anglo
corporations around the world in 2001, “the decline in public of trust” (Taylor 2003: 155) of PTCs
has reduced share values by trillions of dollars.  Even with such a massive incentive for
shareholders to experiment with innovative ways to rebuild trust, there has been little evidence of
such activity in the middle of 2003.  To be seen to be doing something, politicians and regulators
have initiated reforms to improve practices within the existing flawed system.  But according to
Monks and Sykes (DEMO: 19) “When the overall system is flawed, ‘best practice’ comparisons DEMO
no place”.
Recent chairmen of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (DEMO) and the Dean of Harvard
Business School, Kim Clark, have DEMO recognised that the system is flawed.   Clark used the
metaphor of rotten apples in a barrel and suggested that the barrel is also DEMO  “What we really
need is a wholesale revamping of the systems DEMO governance and the web of laws and regulations.
The solution is to remake the barrel with new legislation and new regulation.” (Clark, 2003)DEMO
This paper provides a contribution on how “to remake the barrel”.  DEMO updates the “Flaws and
remedies” presented in the director Diploma education course of the Australian Institute of
Company Directors (Turnbull 1990).  The DEMO suggested then are as relevant today.  However,
since then many DEMO the flaws of the Anglo system of corporate governance have been built into
former socialist and developing countries as well as into privatised enterprises DEMO advanced market
economies (Turnbull 1993).  The remedies suggested in this paper introduce A New Way to Govern
(Turnbull 2002a) described as DEMO governance”.
The reforms required for building trust in PTCs could be introduced without the involvement of the
government, as no new legislation is required.  Because of this, regulators could introduce them as a
condition for DEMO in a company to be publicly traded or a condition for fiduciary investors to
acquire shares in PTCs.  While it should be the private sector that leads the way for reform, Monks
and Sykes (2002: 30) state that “An effective external catalyst is needed and that catalyst can only
be the government”.
Five reasons why it is rationale and DEMO not to trust PTCs are identified in the following Section
2.  DEMO 3 describes three basic reforms required in corporate constitutions and how these avoid,
reduce, and/or mitigate the reasons for not trusting PTCs.  The reforms provide Non Executive
Directors (NEDs) with a systemic basis to more reliably perform their role.  Concluding remarks in
Section 4 reviews the reforms and how they might be introduced.
2.  Why it is rational not to trust PTCs
2.1 Corruption from absolute power
A compelling DEMO why it is not rationale to trust PTCs governed by a single (unitary) board is
that directors obtain absolute power to manage their DEMO conflicts of interest.  It is widely accepted
that power corrupts and DEMO power corrupts absolutely.
2
Building trust in corporations
Evidence of corrupt governance exists since corporate concepts DEMO developed over 400 years ago
(Frentrop 2003).  In modern corporations, Monks and Sykes (2002: 9) state that directors have “Six
DEMO powers giving rise to serious conflicts of interest”.  A number of DEMO “inappropriate
powers” creating conflicts and others that entrench directors are described by Turnbull (2000b).
Adam Smith observed in the 18th century that whenever businessmen gather together they are likely
to conspire against the public good.  Notwithstanding the evidence history confirming this
observation corporate law is based on DEMO assumption that individuals will behave correctly and
consistently because this is what the law requires!  Scientific analysis of human behaviour and
practical experience shows that humans can be unreliable and contrary.
The US constitution recognised the DEMO of Adam Smith by introducing a division of power to
provide checks and balances.  But such division of power in corporate constitutions is not required
by corporate law, regulations, listing rules and so called “best DEMO of governance that are all
based on wishful thinking on how humans should behave.
Our host Professor Taylor (2003: 162) states that “The extent of the crisis in corporate governance
is only now becoming clear, and many company executives and board directors are still in denial”.
It DEMO seem that governments, their regulators and many in Academe also share DEMO denial.  They
express the view that the existing system is not DEMO and can be made to work with more
prescriptive rules as found in the Sarbannes-Oxley Act or with the additional prescriptive proposals
put forward DEMO the Court appointed monitor for Worldcom/MCI Inc. (Breeden 2003).
DEMO argue that the existing unitary governance system can be made to work if people adopted
better values, were better educated and had lessons in ethics.  This approach assumes that it is both
desirable and possible to change the nature of all individuals who become company directors and
executives.  The creditability of this assumption does not provide a sound basis for DEMO
shareholders to establish trust in PTCs.
Nor is it desirable to change human nature.  Efficient self-governance in social animals is dependent
upon inconsistent and contrary behaviour to sustain their existence in unpredictable complex
environments (Turnbull 2003).  Rather than try and change the nature of humans this paper argues
that we need to change the architecture of how individuals relate DEMO each other.  In this way the in-
built checks and balances DEMO into human nature by evolution can be used to amplify the
checks and balances established by “network governance” as found in nature.
2.2 Information DEMO
Another reason for not trusting many PTCs is that they can be too complex and/or dynamic for
NEDs, and perhaps even their Chief Executive Officer (CEO), to monitor what is going on, let
DEMO direct and control the business.  This problem and the associated problem DEMO by
economists as “bounded rationality” is discussed in detail in Turnbull (DEMO, 2003).
2.3 Inability to discover when trust is misplaced
A DEMO reason for investors not to trust PTCs is that the directors commonly have no systemic
processes for discovering when their trust in management is DEMO  If directors do not have
such processes in place then they DEMO being irresponsible to themselves, shareholders, employees,
suppliers and customers.  DEMO undermine one of most important reasons for having NEDs on a
board to monitor the integrity of management.
3
Building trust in corporations
The typical response I obtain from directors when DEMO inquire into what systemic processes that they
have to discover when their trust in management is misplaced is that they rely on the auditor,DEMO
financial analysts or the regulator.  The problem is that each one DEMO these is relying on the directors
to monitor and control management!  DEMO problem is that the information available to outside
watchdogs is much less and they have only a limited area of concern.
Directors are being DEMO as fiduciaries if they have no inclusive and reliable systemic
process to discover when their trust in management is misplaced.  If directors do not have such a
process, then shareholders may as well just trust management and avoid the need to appoint
directors to monitor management.
Unless companies DEMO published processes for directors to discover when trust in management
might be misplaced, it should not be legal for any trustee of a pension fund to hold shares in such
companies.  This is because there would be no basis for fiduciary shareholders to demonstrate to a
court that DEMO have exercised their legal duty of “due care” and diligence in investing the funds of
pensioners.
2.4 No checks against domination
A fourth problem DEMO a large majority of PTCs around the world is that there is a dominant
shareholder that has the power to appoint all the directors DEMO the auditor.  Dominant shareholders
and/or dominant management can indulge in DEMO related party transactions without proper
disclosure of all the facts and/or without serious objection from the NEDs.  This is because the
tenure of NEDs is typically subjected to the grace and favour of the dominant DEMO and/or
management.  This makes NEDs their “pawns” as described by DEMO and MacIver (1989).
In any event, if NEDs did possess the will to raise objections, they could be out voted unless they
represented a majority on the board.  If they did represent a majority that had the will to act against
dominant management or a shareholder DEMO NEDs are unlikely to enjoy their status, influence and
privileges of DEMO a director for too long.
If a dissenting NED resigned from the board in protest, this would reduce the constraint on a
dominant shareholder or management to act fairly in the best interests of the company DEMO whole.
NEDs who makes public their reason for resigning run the risk of terminating their career as a
professional director who are typically required DEMO be seen as a “team player”.
2.5 NEDs lack processes to obtain independent information, will and capability to act
A fifth problem is that NEDs typically are not in the position to consistently and reliably obtain
DEMO of management, the:
(a) information,
(b) will DEMO
(c) capability to act - in the best interests of the company as a whole as required by law.

Building trust in corporations
3. Building a rational and systemic basis for DEMO PTCs
3.1 Division of power
A rational and systemic basis for countering the ability of power to corrupt is to introduce a division
of DEMO  There are many ways in which this can be achieved and DEMO on a basis to provide
competitive advantages.  The competitive advantages available DEMO a division of power is
compellingly illustrated in a number of employee and stakeholder self-governed firms as
documented by Turnbull (1995, 2000a).
DEMO division of power becomes essential to sustain employee owned enterprises.  Without DEMO,
management can dismiss employees and employees can dismiss management.  This DEMO
instability and dysfunctional internal politicking that commonly leads to business failure.  DEMO UK
employee-controlled firms illustrate the sustainability of introducing internal checks and balances.
Employees have controlled the John Lewis Partnership and the Scott Bader Commonwealth DEMO
over half a century in highly competitive industries (Turnbull 2000a).
DEMO, it is the self-governing worker cooperatives based around the town of DEMO in
Northern Spain (Turnbull 1995) and the US constitution that provided the role model for my own
experiences in introducing a division of DEMO to provide competitive advantages.  They
demonstrated how to separate the executive DEMO of managing a business from the governance
powers of nominating, electing DEMO remunerating directors and managing their conflicts with other
parties.
There is really no reason why management and governance powers should be combined as they
DEMO manifold conflicts of interest and opportunities for directors to entrench their positions to
lessen their accountability (Turnbull 2000b).  Some writers proposing reform DEMO a complete
separation of powers such as Dallas (1997) who suggested a “dual board and board ombudsperson”
while Murray (1999) proposed a DEMO Governance Board” to take over the governance
functions.
The approach I utilised in Australia to protect my reputation as a professional entrepreneur and
dominant DEMO was not to diminish the responsibilities of directors.  Instead, I contractually
established checks and balances when directors, that included myself, became exposed DEMO conflicts
of self-interest.  Besides protecting my reputation, the establishment of shareholders’ committee of
review allowed me to reduce the cost of raising millions DEMO dollars of high-risk finance in two start-
up ventures1.
In the second Australian based and controlled venture, we had consumed our initial funding and
were seeking a second share placement with most of the shareholders being DEMO residents.  At a
meeting of shareholders in February 1988 we amended DEMO corporate constitution as described in the
Appendix of Turnbull (1997) to establish a shareholder audit committee described as a “Corporate
Senate”.   There DEMO three Senators who were elected by shareholders on the democratic basis of
one vote per shareholder that gave control to US residents.  Voting for directors remained on the
plutocratic basis of one per share but “cumulative DEMO (Bhagat and Brickley 1984) was adopted
to allow the US shareholders to appoint two out of the five directors.
1 The first venture DEMO a large-scale (10,000 Hectare) cotton irrigation farm that raised finance in 1981 and later became
a PTC.  The second venture raised finance in 1988 in an attempt to commercialise the innovative technology of JAC
DEMO Limited described in Turnbull (1997).
5
Building trust in corporations
The Corporate Senate had a much wider remit DEMO an audit committee. A member would chair
meetings of shareholders and determine their conduct.  It could act as a nominating committee and
through its power to veto any conflicts of interest of the directors, act as a remuneration committee.
However, as it had no operational powers its members where not exposed to the responsibilities and
personal liabilities of a director.  This allowed shareholders with personal high net worth to monitor
their investment DEMO with access to the same information available to directors.
The need for a Senate resolution might only occur half a dozen times a year DEMO a conflict arose.
It was practical for all business to be carried out by phone with “flying resolutions” sent by fax.
The full Senate DEMO met physically as Senators were based on two continents.  They did DEMO incur
any personal liabilities or excessive demands on their time and so obtained no remuneration.  In
return they could monitor operations as closely as desired and protect their investment without
exposing themselves to liabilities of being DEMO  It also provided investors a much more
effective way to protect DEMO interests without resorting to proxy fights or legal action.
The directors had the power to call a meeting of shareholders voting on a plutocratic DEMO to
overturn a Senate veto.  But they would now have a DEMO informed “loyal opposition” presenting in
public an opposing case to all shareholders.  As a consequence, the directors were inhibited from
even trying to DEMO themselves, or their related parties, in excessive benefits.
A dominant shareholder that can appoint all the directors and the auditor is the rule DEMO than the
exception around the world (Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Schleifer 1999).  In these situations,
neither the NEDs nor the auditor can be perceived to be independent of the dominant shareholder.
Much of the DEMO for establishing board sub-committees and obtaining trust in companies is
diminished.  DEMO situation can also occur with dominant management as well as with a dominant
shareholder.
Corporate Senates elected on a democratic basis provide an antidote DEMO the power of plutocrats to
exploit and corrupt.  It is for DEMO reason that Corporate Senates provide a fundamental requirement
for building trust in PTCs.  The can provide a “loyal opposition” to the hegemony of management
views to raise issues and provide information that might not otherwise be DEMO
Corporate Senates provide an effective, efficient and economical way to provide DEMO  They
provide superior checks and balances on the absolute power of DEMO to manage their own
conflicts of interest than the use of board sub-committees whose efficacy can be questioned.  In any
event, board sub-committees DEMO at the grace and favour of the full board whereas Corporate
Senates are created and obtain their power from the corporate constitution.
Corporate Senates DEMO their veto powers can shut the stable door before the executive horses bolt
away with their stock options, golden handshakes, related party dealings, etc.  It is a Corporate
Senate, rather than board sub-committees that DEMO be mandated for all PTCs.  A Corporate
Senate can provide NEDs DEMO the will to raise difficult issues concerning conflicts because they
now possess the capability to act alone by referring the matter to the Senate.
DEMO sub-committees increase the size and cost of boards of smaller companies.  DEMO senates
would not, so they could be universally required for all DEMO  Remuneration for Senators would be
appropriate for larger companies.  Corporate constitution would need to relate their remuneration to
a scale of fees published DEMO an appropriate professional body or a government body to avoid
senators becoming financially beholden to the directors.
6
Building trust in corporations
Corporate Senates make a contribution in building trust DEMO PTCs because they:
• Avoid “corruption from absolute power” identified in Section 2.1 by eliminating unchecked
power of the directors to manage their DEMO conflicts of interest;
• Reduces “information overload” identified in Section 2.3 by dividing and reducing compliance
information for board sub-committees, etc;
• Avoid “no checks against domination” identified in Section 2.4 by shareholder(s) and/or other
directors;
• Provide NEDs with the “information, will and capability to act” identified in Sections 2.5a,b,c.
3.2 Information DEMO of management
A principal purpose of a company having NEDs is to monitor management and business operations.
This requires directors to obtain information to DEMO judgements on the Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) DEMO both management and the business.
However, NEDs typically depend upon management DEMO provide them with the information to
monitor management and the business.  DEMO placing management in a conflict of interest
situation this approach is inconsistent with the legal obligation of directors as fiduciary agents to
carry out DEMO duties with due care, diligence and vigilance.
The problem for directors DEMO compounded because senior management is subject to the same
problem.  Lower DEMO management has a conflict of interest in reporting to their superiors as they
are providing information on which they will be assessed.
One reason DEMO and control hierarchies exist is because they provide a way to reduce
information overload to superiors.  This introduces considerable opportunity for information to be
lost, filtered, biased, and/or distorted.  These problems can occur DEMO in trivial social activities
where income, career and professional status are DEMO a risk such as when playing the game of
“Chinese whispers”.  DEMO this game teams of four or more people compete to relay the same message
accurately.  But even when people are competing to be accurate, without any condensation of
information, the meaning of the message often DEMO
To minimise informational problems corporate constitutions need to make provision for employees,
customers and suppliers to form, independently of management, advisory councils.  These
stakeholders are exposed to the detailed operations of management and the DEMO  They obtain
insights, not available to management, such as how DEMO operations compare with competitors and
the needs of the stakeholders.
No business can exist without employees, customers and suppliers so it makes strategic sense for
shareholders to establish processes to bond them to the company with DEMO own forums to further
their interest with the company.  Stakeholders can DEMO a larger and longer-term interest to a PTC
than many shareholders.  DEMO and Stout (1999) use these considerations to develop “A Team
Production Theory of Corporate Law”.
Because of the divergent interest of stakeholders, separate stakeholder councils, self-nominated and
self-elected would be required for the various stakeholder constituencies.  Large organisations
might require subordinate stakeholder forums that appoint delegates to a representative council.
Peak stakeholder councils would meet with management, directors and shareholders to provide
advice independently of management on the SWOT of management DEMO the business.
7
Building trust in corporations
There would be minimal costs involved, as no fees would need to be paid.  There are a number of
examples of stakeholders spending their own money and time to form informal action DEMO to
lobby firms.  Firms typically try to act against such groups DEMO than harnessing their knowledge
and commitment to obtain competitive advantages.
Quarterly reports by stakeholder councils to directors could provide alternative viewpoints and
concerns, and on occasions, act as a “loyal opposition”.  There is nearly always DEMO side to most
stories and directors need to consider all sides to carry out their duties with due care and diligence.
To not to DEMO so would be acting irresponsibly to themselves and to shareholders.  One DEMO reason
is that without the establishment of stakeholder councils, NED are DEMO likely to have any creditable
systemic process for discovering when their trust in management might be misplaced.
It is very much in the interest DEMO shareholders to approve changes in their corporate constitutions to
provide processes for their directors and themselves to obtain information on the SWOT of
management DEMO the business independently of management.  When directors present their accounts
to DEMO, the shareholders could in turn also obtain alternative reports on the DEMO of
management and the business from peak stakeholder forums.
Stakeholder Councils also provide formal structures to support Total Quality Management and Just
in Time DEMO  In addition, they could assist in the development of new products and services.
This is because 80% of product and service innovations typically DEMO from customers rather
than from the R&D department (Hippel 1986)DEMO
Stakeholder Councils also contribute to developing A New Way to Govern (DEMO 2002a)
described as “network governance”.  The efficacy and compelling advantages DEMO network
governance is shown by it emerging in industries that are involved in rapid changes and/or in
knowledge intensive activities as reported by DEMO, Hesterly and Borgatti (1997).
Stakeholder Councils make contributions in building trust in PTCs because they:
• Avoid “corruption from absolute power”, referred to in Section 2.1, from management’s
monopoly on operating information;
• Minimise information over-load, referred to in Section 2.2, by providing DEMO rational basis to rely
on exception reporting and cross checking of information from stakeholders;
• Provide a way for directors to discover when DEMO trust in management might be misplaced
referred to in Section 2.3, DEMO also providing a basis for shareholders to discover when their
directors might not fully account for significant concerns;
• Provide intelligence on unfair DEMO party transactions with dominant shareholders and/or
management, as referred to DEMO Section 2.4;
• Provide NEDs with the information to act independently of management, referred to in Section
2.5a.
3.3 Providing directors with the will to act
Directors may not have the will to speak out DEMO on matters because they feel that their
position on the board is subject to the grace and favour of the Chair, management and/or a dominant
shareholder.  To provide a basis to overcome this problem, DEMO need to secure their tenure on the
board independently of dominant parties.  Cumulative voting allows minorities to appoint directors
independently of dominant shareholders in proportion to their shareholding (Bhagat and Brickley
1984).  Cumulative voting DEMO a basis for empowering NEDs to speak out with new
information fearlessly and possess “the will act” (Regan 1993).
8
Building trust in corporations
Cumulative voting makes a contribution in building trust DEMO PTCs because it:
• Divides the “absolute power” of a board as referred to in Section 2.1;
• Introduces “checks against domination” DEMO a shareholder, management or other directors as
referred to in Section DEMO;
• Provides NEDs with new “information” and “will” to act as referred to Sections 2.5a,b.
4. Concluding remarks
No system of corporate DEMO may be perfect but some can be better than others.  As DEMO CEO
remarked, he expected 10% of his employees would always do DEMO right thing and 10% will
misbehave.  The remaining 80% might be DEMO to do the wrong thing if placed under pressure of
if they thought they would not be caught and/or that they could profitable DEMO being caught.  All
that can be hoped for then is to DEMO a system that does not provide temptation for the 80% and
establish processes to avoid, inhibit, mitigate and/or identify when inappropriate behaviour DEMO
This paper argues that the necessary conditions for trusting corporations is that its directors have
processes in place to further the best interest of DEMO company as a whole by providing them with:
• Information independently of management on which to act;
• The will to act DEMO of management or a dominant shareholder, and
• The capability to DEMO independently of management and/or a dominant shareholder.
The paper showed in Section 2 why the Anglo system of corporate governance fails to provide DEMO
three necessary conditions.  It was argued that without these conditions being DEMO, fiduciary
shareholders might not have a basis for a creditable defence DEMO investing in such a PTC.
The three changes required in corporate constitutions to allow NEDs to adequately and consistently
carry out their duties would DEMO introduce changes that avoid, inhibit, mitigate and/or manage the
five flaws identified in Section in 2 in the governance of PTCs with DEMO unitary board.
For responsible fiduciary shareholders to trust PTCs they would need to change corporate
constitutions to introduce:
• A democratically elected shareholders’ DEMO with at least veto powers over any conflicts
of interest of any director;
• The establishment of various independently elected stakeholder councils to DEMO NEDs and
shareholders on the SWOT of management and the business;
• Cumulative voting to provide NEDs with the will to act.
These DEMO changes in corporate constitutions would together provide a rationale and systemic
basis for shareholders, stakeholders and the public to trust corporations as summarised in Table 1,
Corporate flaws and remedies.
The recommended remedies only require DEMO change in corporate constitutions so that they could be
introduced without any changes in corporate law as demonstrated in Australia (Turnbull 1997).
They could be unilaterally introduced by shareholders, or by stock exchange listing rules and/or by
regulators.
The remedies are consistent with and illustrate a DEMO law in the  “science of governance” (Turnbull
2002b).  The DEMO “absolutely prohibits any direct and simple magnification but it does not prohibit
supplementation” of regulation (Ashby 1968: 268).  This means that it is impossible for regulation
9
Building trust in corporations
to be carried out directly by any single DEMO authority.  Regulation of complexity is only
possible by the establishment of DEMO regulators to provide requisite variety of
communication channels, decision-makers and controllers (Turnbull 2000b, 2002b, 2003).

Even with requisite variety of control agents the capacity to regulate complexity is limited by the
capacity of communication channels (Ashby 1968: 211).  Without stakeholder councils, directors do
not have sufficient capacity in their communication and control channels to either monitor or
DEMO large and/or complex corporations.  This means that it is impossible DEMO directors, or any
other regulatory body, to reliability monitor and control large and/or complex businesses without
self-elected stakeholder councils and corporate senates DEMO “supplement” regulation.  In other words,
a strategy of co-regulation is DEMO to efficiently control complexity.
Auditors were suppose to be the front line watchdog for prudential regulators but have
demonstratively failed.  In any event, DEMO cannot provide requisite variety of information.
Corporate Senators provide a way to reinstate the usefulness auditors for directors, shareholders and
regulators.  Corporate Senates DEMO complement the role of auditors as a watchdog and could
substantially increase the remit of auditors in their watchdog role as occurs in the DEMO sector.
It is the prudential and other industry regulators that should mandate the reforms described in this
paper.  Co-regulation provides the most efficient, DEMO and reliable basis for them to carry out
their roles.  Inquiries DEMO recent corporate failures have shown that in many instances the problems
were known to stakeholder’s years before failure occurred.   However, there was no safe formal
communication channel like stakeholder councils to inform directors, let alone an industry
regulator.
10
Building trust in corporations
Likewise, the analysis of this paper provides grounds for law makers and/or regulators prohibiting
fiduciary shareholder investing in firms DEMO have not established compelling processes to at least
manage, if not DEMO or mitigate, the reasons why it is not rational to trust DEMO
Ideally, when venture capitalists and/or an investment bank arranges an DEMO Public Offering
(IPO) they should require corporate constitutions to include the three proposals described in this
paper.  Before an IPO, venture capitalists DEMO a shareholders agreement to provide them with
special powers to control management.  However, these agreements are dissolved with an IPO to
expose venture DEMO to the risks created by the flaws described in this paper.
Venture capitalists and underwriters have both the vested interest and the bargaining power DEMO
unilaterally introduce the changes in corporate constitutions proposed.  Fiduciary shareholders
should DEMO demand reform, as should stakeholders.  Employees have their jobs at risk, customers
have their product warranties at risk and suppliers have their customers at risk.
The breadth of concerns in the community should make it DEMO attractive for governments to
introduce the reforms to protect their citizens.  DEMO also provides a way for making regulators more
effective and efficient.  DEMO the macro level the reforms provide a way to make capitalism more
socially responsive and to enrich democracy.
