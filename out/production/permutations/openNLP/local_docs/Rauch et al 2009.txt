Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has received substantial conceptual and empirical atten-
tion, representing one of the few areas in entrepreneurship research where a cumulative
body of knowledge is developing. DEMO time is therefore ripe to document, to review, and to
evaluate the cumulative knowledge on the relationship between EO and business perfor-
mance. DEMO beyond qualitative assessment, we undertook a meta-analysis exploring
the magnitude of DEMO EO-performance relationship and assessed potential moderators
affecting this relationship. Analyses of 53 samples from 51 studies with an N of 14,259
companies indicated DEMO the correlation of EO with performance is moderately large
(r = DEMO) and that this relationship is robust to different operationalizations of key DEMO
as well as cultural contexts. Internal and environmental moderators were identiﬁed, DEMO
results suggest that additional moderators should be assessed. Recommendations for
future research are developed.
Introduction
Many reviews and assessments of the entrepreneurship research ﬁeld DEMO concluded
that the development of a cumulative body of knowledge has been limited and slow because
there is lack of agreement on many key DEMO regarding what constitutes entrepreneurship
(e.g., Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), DEMO researchers fail to build upon each others’
results (Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001), and because measurements of key variables are
typically weak. Although DEMO larger ﬁeld of entrepreneurship may be struggling with central

conceptual issues, the development has been more promising in certain areas of entrepre-
neurship research. A large stream of research has examined the concept DEMO entrepreneurial
orientation (EO). EO has become a central concept in DEMO domain of entrepreneurship that
has received a substantial amount of theoretical and empirical attention (Covin, Green, &
Slevin, 2006). More than 100 studies of EO have been conducted, which has led to wide
acceptance of the conceptual meaning and relevance of the concept.
EO refers DEMO the strategy-making processes that provide organizations with a basis for
entrepreneurial decisions and actions (e.g., Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Wiklund & Shepherd,DEMO
2003). Drawing on prior strategy-making process and entrepreneurship research, measure-
DEMO scales of EO have been developed and widely used, and their DEMO with other
variables have been examined. Thus, EO represents one of DEMO areas of entrepreneurship
research where a cumulative body of knowledge is developing. Consequently, we believe
that the time has come to document, to DEMO, and to evaluate the cumulative knowledge on
the relationship between EO DEMO business performance. Given that similar measurement
instruments have been applied across a wide array of studies, it is possible to extend this
review beyond qualitative assessments (see Newbert, 2007, for a qualitative assessment of
resource-based research) and conduct a meta-analysis. A number of theoretical, method-
ological, and empirical contributions can be derived from our review and analyses.
First, a meta-analysis can help guide future studies into areas that are of DEMO
importance. As the number of studies examining the relationship between EO and per-
formance is ever increasing (using publication date as an indicator), this is an important
function of a meta-analysis. Such an analysis can DEMO us if an area has reached maturity,
if further work in the area is warranted and, going forward, what kinds of EO-performance
DEMO need to be done. It can also provide more ﬁne-grained information, DEMO to
speciﬁc issues that remain unresolved and need additional attention. Speciﬁcally, DEMO
analyses provide guidance as to where theories that include moderators of relationships
should be developed to more precisely explain the relationship of EO to DEMO, and
where moderators are less likely to be empirically supported.
Second, ﬁrms pursuing high EO are faced with decisions involving risk taking and DEMO
allocation of scarce resources. There is a potential downside to taking risks and resources
can potentially be allocated to other ends. Therefore, it is essential to know not only
whether EO has positive or negative effects DEMO performance, as is typically indicated when
the null hypothesis of zero DEMO is rejected, but also to estimate the magnitude of the
effect DEMO EO on performance. Unless the effect size is substantially positive, wholehearted
DEMO that ﬁrms use a high degree of EO in management decisions appear
misdirected (see Wiklund, 1999) because of the risk associated with EO and its demand-
ing resource requirements. Such considerations reﬂect evidence-based management,
DEMO is strongly called for in the literature (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006; Rousseau, 2006) and
are common in other ﬁelds of research (DEMO, Denyer, & Smart, 2003).
Third, previous studies have indicated that EO or certain dimensions thereof may
differ across countries (e.g., DEMO, 1997; Thomas & Mueller, 2000). Whether or not this
DEMO relates to the strength of the relationship between EO and performance is still an open
question. For example, it is possible that an aggressive “undo the competitor”1 strategic
stance, as suggested by an EO, is DEMO as positive by important stakeholders and
rewarded in some cultures but negative and punished in others, suggesting that the
inﬂuence of EO on performance may vary as a function of cultural norms. As early as
1983, Hofstede noted that management theories were culturally bounded. Journal

contributors and samples studied today represent a wider set of countries than DEMO before.
The formulation of the EO model and the original empirical tests were mainly done in
the North American context (e.g., Covin & DEMO, 1989; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Miller,
1983). Clarifying the extent to which these results replicate or not across a wide DEMO of
countries may not only contribute to future EO research but more generally to theorizing
about entrepreneurship because it helps in establishing boundary conditions DEMO theories.
Fourth, our review assists in providing methodological advice for future DEMO research.
The possibility of conducting a meta-analysis depends largely on the quality of the
underlying studies. The research design, operationalization, sampling, and reporting of
statistics are key considerations in a meta-analysis. Consequently, reviewing the empirical
EO literature, we are able to identify potential shortcomings in prior EO research and to
provide recommendations for enhancing the quality of future studies.
DEMO article proceeds as follows. In the next section, we introduce the DEMO concept, the
dimensions of EO, and the implications of EO on business performance. Moreover, we
develop arguments that the effect of EO on performance is likely dependent on moderator
variables, such as type of industry, business size, and cross-national contexts. Next, we
describe our search for studies, the samples selected, and the meta-analytic techniques
used in our DEMO Finally, we report our ﬁndings and discuss their implications.
Entrepreneurial Orientation DEMO Firm Performance
EO has its roots in the strategy-making process literature (DEMO, Mintzberg, 1973).
Strategy making is an organization-wide phenomenon that incorporates planning, analy-
sis, decision making, and many aspects of an organization’s culture, value system, and
mission (Hart, 1992). Consistent with DEMO, Raisinghani, and Theoret who noted
that strategy making is “important, DEMO terms of the actions taken, the resources committed,
or the DEMO set” (1976, p. 246), EO represents the policies and practices that provide
a basis for entrepreneurial decisions and actions. Thus, EO may be viewed as the entre-
preneurial strategy-making processes that key decision makers DEMO to enact their ﬁrm’s
organizational purpose, sustain its vision, and create competitive advantage(s).
The Dimensions of EO
The salient dimensions of DEMO can be derived from a review and integration of the
strategy and entrepreneurship literatures (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1991; Miller, 1983; DEMO
& Friesen, 1978; Venkatraman, 1989a). Based on Miller’s conceptualization, three dimen-
sions of EO have been identiﬁed and used consistently in DEMO literature: innovativeness,
risk taking, and proactiveness. Innovativeness is the predisposition to engage in creativity
and experimentation through the introduction of new products/DEMO as well as tech-
nological leadership via R&D in new processes. Risk taking involves taking bold actions
by venturing into the unknown, borrowing heavily, and/or committing signiﬁcant re-
sources to ventures in uncertain environments. Proactiveness is an opportunity-seeking,
forward-looking perspective characterized by the introduction of DEMO products and ser-
vices ahead of the competition and acting in anticipation of future demand.
Lumpkin and Dess (1996) suggested that two additional DEMO were salient
to EO. Drawing on Miller’s (1983) deﬁnition and prior research (e.g., Burgelman, 1984;
Hart, 1992; MacMillan & Day, 1987; Venkatraman, 1989a), they identiﬁed competitive
aggressiveness and autonomy as additional components of the EO construct. Competitive
May, 2009
763
aggressiveness is the intensity of a ﬁrm’s effort to outperform rivals and DEMO characterized
by a strong offensive posture or aggressive responses to competitive threats. Autonomy
refers to independent action undertaken by entrepreneurial leaders or teams directed DEMO
bringing about a new venture and seeing it to fruition.
The salient dimensions of EO usually show high intercorrelations with each other,
ranging, for example, from r = .39 to r = .75 (Bhuian, Menguc, & Bell, 2005; Richard,
Barnett, Dwyer, & Chadwick, 2004; Stetz, Howell, Stewart, Blair, & Fottler, 2000; DEMO &
Tan, 2005). Therefore, most studies combined these dimension DEMO one single factor (e.g.,
Covin, Slevin, & Schultz, 2004; Lee, Lee, & Pennings, 2001; Naman & Slevin, 1993;DEMO
Walter, Auer, & Ritter, 2006; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003)DEMO However, there has been some
debate in the literature concerning the DEMO of EO. Some scholars have argued
that the EO construct is best viewed as a unidimensional concept (e.g., Covin & Slevin,
1989; Knight, 1997) and, consequently, the different dimensions of EO should DEMO to
performance in similar ways. More recent theorizing suggests that the dimensions of EO
may occur in different combinations (e.g., Covin et al., 2006; Lumpkin & Dess, 2001),
each representing a different and independent aspect of the multidimensional concept of
EO (George, 2006). DEMO a consequence, the dimensions of EO may relate differently to ﬁrm
DEMO (Stetz et al.). Speciﬁcally referring to the dimensionality of EO, Covin et al.,
p. 80) note that “intellectual advancement pertaining to EO will likely occur as a function
of how clearly and completely DEMO can delineate the pros and cons of alternative
conceptualizations of the EO construct and the conditions under which the alternative
conceptualizations may be appropriate.” DEMO different conceptual arguments can be
used for and against treating EO as a uni- or multidimensional construct, meta-analysis
can establish empirically whether the different dimensions of EO relate to performance to
the same or varying extent.
DEMO EO–Performance Relationship
The conceptual arguments of previous research converge on the idea that ﬁrms
beneﬁt from highlighting newness, responsiveness, and a degree of DEMO Extensive
discussion of the arguments can be found in Lumpkin and Dess (1996). Indeed, these
suggestions form the basis for the interest DEMO studying the relationship between EO and
performance (Miller, 1983). In an environment of rapid change and shortened product
and business model lifecycles, the future proﬁt streams from existing operations are
uncertain and businesses need DEMO constantly seek out new opportunities. Therefore, ﬁrms
may beneﬁt from adopting DEMO EO. Such ﬁrms innovate frequently while taking risks in
their product-market strategies (Miller & Friesen, 1982). Efforts to anticipate demand
and aggressively DEMO new product/service offerings often result in strong perfor-
mance (Ireland, Hitt, & Sirmon, 2003). Thus, conceptual arguments suggest that EO
leads to higher performance. However, the magnitude of the relationship seems to vary
across studies. While some studies have found that businesses that adopt DEMO strong EO
perform much better than ﬁrms that do not adopt an EO (with an r > .30, e.g., Covin &
Slevin, 1986; Hult, Snow, & Kandemir, 2003; Lee et al., DEMO; Wiklund & Shepherd,
2003), other studies reported lower correlations DEMO EO and performance (e.g.,
Dimitratos, Lioukas, & Carter, 2004; Lumpkin & Dess, 2001; Zahra, 1991) or were
even unable to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship between EO and performance (Covin et al.,
1994; George, Wood, & Khan, 2001). Thus, there is a considerable variation in the size
of reported relationships between EO DEMO business performance. Consequently, using
meta-analysis, we provide a point estimate on the relationship between EO and perfor-
mance across previous studies and we DEMO the question whether the variation is high
764
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
enough to warrant an empirical examination of moderators of the EO–performance
relationship.
DEMO of Performance Assessment
Performance is a multidimensional concept and the relationship between EO and
performance may depend upon the indicators used to assess performance (Lumpkin &
Dess, 1996). The empirical literature reports a high DEMO of performance indicators (cf.
reviews by Combs, Crook, & Shook, 2005; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986); a common
distinction is between DEMO and nonﬁnancial measures. Nonﬁnancial measures include
goals such as satisfaction and global success ratings made by owners or business managers;
ﬁnancial measures include DEMO of factors such as sales growth and return on
investments (ROI; Smith, 1976). Regarding ﬁnancial performance, there is often a low
DEMO between different indicators (Murphy, Trailer, & Hill, 1996). On a conceptual
level, one can distinguish between growth measures and measures of proﬁtability. While
these concepts are empirically and theoretically related, there are also important differences
between them (Combs et al.). For example, businesses DEMO invest heavily in long-term
growth, thereby sacriﬁcing short-term proﬁts. The conceptual DEMO of the
EO–performance relationship focuses mainly on ﬁnancial aspects of performance. Busi-
nesses with high EO can target premium market segments, charge high prices, and “skim”
the market ahead of competitors, which should provide them DEMO larger proﬁts and allow
them to expand faster (Zahra & Covin, 1995). The relationship between the EO construct
and nonﬁnancial goals, such as increasing the satisfaction of the owner of the ﬁrm, is less
straightforward. We argue that there is little direct effect of EO on DEMO goals
because this relationship is tenous. For example, if nonﬁnancial goals DEMO of prime
importance, the uncertainty associated with the bold initiatives and DEMO taking implied by
an EO could potentially lead to agony, sleepless DEMO, and less satisfaction. However,
satisfaction may increase because of better DEMO performance. However, indirect effects
are usually smaller than direct effect. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume that the
relationship should be higher for DEMO and ﬁnancial performance than for EO and nonﬁnan-
cial performance.
In terms of ﬁnancial performance, studies can rely on self-report or archival data
collected from secondary sources. While self-reported data may offer greater opportun-
ities for DEMO multiple dimensions of performance, such as comparisons with competi-
tors (e.g., Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005), such measures may be subject to DEMO because of
social desirability, memory decay, and/or common method variance. Therefore, an impor-
tant task of this meta-analysis is to establish the effect size of EO on performance for
self-reported ﬁnancial performance, archival ﬁnancial performance, and nonﬁnancial
performance measures.
Moderator Variables
Research indicates that performance can be improved when key variables are cor-
rectly aligned (e.g., Naman & Slevin, 1993). This is the basic premise of contingency
theory, which suggests that congruence or “ﬁt” among key variables such as industry
DEMO and organizational processes is critical for obtaining optimal performance
(Lawrence & DEMO, 1967). Contingency theory holds that the relationship between two
variables DEMO on the level of a third variable. Introducing moderators into bivariate
relationships helps reduce the potential for misleading inferences and permits a
May, 2009
765
“more precise and speciﬁc understanding” (Rosenberg, 1968, p. 100) of DEMO
relationships. Because of its concern with performance implications, contingency theory
has DEMO fundamental to furthering the development of the management sciences (Ven-
katraman, 1989b). Therefore, to understand differences in ﬁndings across studies, we
DEMO potential moderators of the relationship between EO and performance.
The literature discusses a number of variables that potentially moderate the EO–
performance relationship (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Zahra & Covin, 1995; Zahra &
Garvis, 2000). There is little consensus on what constitutes suitable moderators, DEMO,
and both internal variables such as knowledge (Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003), and various
environmental variables (e.g., Tan & Tan, 2005) have been included in studies of EO.
Although several conceptual arguments have been suggested in favor of moderating
variables, few potential moderators have been used across a sufﬁcient number of EO
studies to facilitate a meta-analysis DEMO contingency relationships. However, it is not
necessary that previous studies have DEMO tested moderator relationships in order to
determine moderating effects. Meta-analysis makes it possible to examine moderating
inﬂuences on the basis of the samples included DEMO different studies. If the relationship
between EO and performance varies across samples that differ on a given attribute, such
ﬁndings suggest that the attribute may be a moderator (Miller & Toulouse, 1986).
Methods
Locating DEMO
Consistent with recommendations of other meta-analyses (see Lowe, Kroeck, &
Sivasubramaniam, 1996), we used several strategies to locate studies. First, DEMO searched
databases (PsycInfo, 1987–2007; EconLit, 1967–2007; Social Science Citation DEMO,
1972–2007; and ABI/Inform, 1971–2007). We used the search terms entrepreneurial
behavior, strategic orientation, strategic posture, and EO, which DEMO consistent with the
labeling of the EO construct found in previous reviews of the literature (Wiklund, 1998).
Second, we conducted manual searches of journals that publish research on entrepreneur-
ship: Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Busi-
ness Venturing, Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice, Journal of Small Business
Management, Small Business Economics, and Strategic Management Journal. Addition-
ally, we analyzed conference proceedings of the Academy of Management (1984–2005),
Babson College-Kaufman Foundation Entrepreneurship Research Conference (1981–
2004), and International Council of Small Businesses (1993–2004). The fourth strategy
involved examining the reference lists of located articles and reviews. These DEMO
produced an extensive list of studies. In order to be included in the meta-analysis, studies
needed to report sample sizes, measurement procedures, and zero-order correlations or
equivalent calculations (Ellis, 2006). Upon reading the DEMO or full papers, it rapidly
became clear that several studies deviated DEMO from the core aspects of EO. These
studies were removed.
This initial screening left us with 134 publications potentially relevant for the scope
of DEMO meta-analysis. This number was then further reduced to 51 for the following
reasons. First, it was impossible to locate some of the journals publishing EO articles (e.g.,
Journal of African Business) through interlibrary loans (k = 18). Second, some samples
were used for multiple publications (k = 15). Third, some studies used EO to predict
DEMO rather than ﬁrm-level performance (k = 5); although potentially inter-
DEMO, these studies are not compatible with studies of ﬁrm performance. Fourth,DEMO
several studies did not report the statistics needed for estimating the effect size of
766
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
the EO–performance relationship, i.e., the zero-order correlation between EO and
performance (or convertible equivalents) were missing (k = 45). This resulted DEMO 51
studies that reported in all 53 independent samples with a total of 14,259 cases for our
meta-analysis. Such an extensive reduction in DEMO that can actually be included in
meta-analysis is not uncommon. For example, Ellis (2006) located 175 empirical studies
dealing with marketing orientation, DEMO of which 56 could be included in a meta-analysis.
Study Description
In order to make a qualitative assessment of the 51 studies to show DEMO relevance of
conducting a meta-analysis, and to derive suitable moderator variables DEMO the meta-
analysis, we present details of the studies in Table DEMO A ﬁrst interesting observation is how
the number of studies has increased over time. The increase in the number of studies
coincides with a DEMO of EO research around the globe. In the 1980s, three studies
DEMO published—all from North America. The 1990s saw 14 studies, 12 from DEMO United
States, one from Europe, and one from Australia. Between the years 2000 and 2006, no
less than 34 studies have been published. Twenty-two of these used data from outside of
the United States with DEMO from Asia, eight from Europe, two from Australia, and ﬁve
DEMO data from more than one continent. The remaining 12 studies were carried out
in the United States. These ﬁndings suggest that EO research is DEMO increasingly
popular around the globe. The recent research thrust in EO warrants carrying out a
meta-analysis to assess the value added of further EO DEMO and for determining if there
are speciﬁc issues that may need additional attention in future studies.
As EO research has continued spreading, so have the variants for measuring the
construct. There is little doubt that the DEMO studies of Miller (1983) and Covin and
Slevin (1989) provided the foundations for the scales used in subsequent studies.
However, different variations of the scales are being used. In particular, three types of
modiﬁcations were made to these original scales. First, the number of dimensions
included varied somewhat across studies. Miller’s and Covin and Slevin’s original nine-
item DEMO of the three dimensions innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking
dominated with a total of 28 studies. However, this also means that close to half of all the
studies view EO as consisting of alternative or DEMO dimensions. In particular,
futurity and/or competitive aggressiveness, both taken DEMO Venkatraman (1989a), appear
to be popular additions to the EO DEMO
Second, the number of scale items utilized to assess EO varied DEMO studies. This
applies even when the same dimensions of EO were investigated. For example, across the
studies in our analysis, the number of DEMO used to tap the dimensions of innovativeness,
proactiveness, and risk DEMO varied from six to eleven. Finally, many studies converted
the original DEMO differential statements response format used by Covin and Slevin to
Likert scales. It appears that EO researchers preferred to experiment with adaptations of
the DEMO rather than consistently sticking to one particular measurement.
As for the dimensionality of the EO construct, 37 studies viewed it as a unidimen-
sional construct, summing the different aspects of EO into a singular scale, DEMO 14
studies viewed EO as multidimensional, estimating separate effects on performance DEMO
each dimension. Taken together, these ﬁndings related to the measurement of DEMO speak to
2. Note that Table 1 is based on 51 publications, whereas Table 2 is based on 53 independent samples—these
53 independent samples were reported in the 51 publications.

the value of examining the dimensionality of EO in a meta-analysis in DEMO to determine
if these dimensions relate differently to performance or not.
Concerning the measurement of performance, seven studies relied solely on archival
ﬁnancial performance measures, two combined archival and perceived ﬁnancial measures
of performance, while DEMO study combined all three aspects of performance (archival
ﬁnancial, perceived ﬁnancial, and perceived nonﬁnancial) into a global performance
measure. Of the remaining DEMO, 11 utilized combinations of perceived ﬁnancial and
nonﬁnancial while 21 used DEMO ﬁnancial performance only. Finally, nine studies
relied on perceived nonﬁnancial performance DEMO Thus, similar to the measurement of
EO, there is substantial variation in terms of business performance measurement, but
self-perceived performance measures clearly dominate EO research. Meta-analysis can
help establish if this is an appropriate practice.
DEMO Procedure
We used the meta-analytic approach suggested by Hunter and Schmidt (DEMO, 2004).
Since we were interested in relationships between EO and DEMO, we transformed
study statistics into an “r” statistic and corrected for DEMO size and reliabilities. Addi-
tionally, we calculated the 95% conﬁdence interval DEMO the weighted mean correlation
and assumed a correlation to be signiﬁcant if the interval did not include zero. To test for
homogeneity of the DEMO, Hunter and Schmidt (1990) suggest using the 75% rule.
According DEMO this rule, if more than 75% of the observed variance is DEMO to sampling error,
then the results are homogeneous; if this DEMO is less than 75%, Hunter and Schmidt
(1990) assumed heterogeneity (for details consult Hunter & Schmidt, 2004; Sagie &
Koslowsky, DEMO). For testing the signiﬁcance of a moderator effect, we analyzed DEMO
ences in the weighted correlations by using a z-test as a critical ratio (Hunter & Schmidt,
1990 , p. 348). Since the Hunter & Schmidt (1990) approach requires independent statistics
we aggregated results DEMO studies that reported multiple indicators. Statistical software by
Schwarzer (1989) and Borenstein and Rothstein (1999) supported the analyses.
Results
The meta-analytic results DEMO presented in Table 2. First, we computed the sample size
weighted DEMO between EO and performance for each study. In studies where
several performance measures were included, we computed a single average effect across
these performance measures. The ﬁrst section of the table displays the relationship
between the DEMO measure of EO and performance. The correlation between EO and
performance, DEMO for measurement and sampling errors, was .242. This correlation
can be DEMO as moderately large (Cohen, 1977). The percentage of variance attribut-
able to sampling variance was 22.38%. This was less than the 75% DEMO for assuming
homogeneity. Therefore, according to the 75% rule (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990), there are
likely moderators inﬂuencing the size of the EO–performance relationship, which we
return to in the discussion below.
In the cases where the individual dimensions of EO were included and appropriate
statistics DEMO, we repeated the procedure for innovativeness (k = 10), risk taking (k = 12),
and proactiveness (k = 13). Section 2 of Table 2 shows the correlations between each of
the DEMO of EO and performance. The highest corrected correlation was .195 for the
innovativeness dimension and the lowest was .139 for risk taking. Testing the DEMO

of these differences, the z-statistic indicated that these differences were too small to be
statistically signiﬁcant. Their relationships with performance seem to be relatively DEMO
in magnitude. It thus appears premature to suggest a multidimensional rather than unidi-
mensional conceptualization of EO based on how the dimensions relate to DEMO
When we applied the 75% rule to the individual dimensions of EO, we could see that the
sampling error variance was below 75% for all three dimensions, suggesting that potential
moderators should be included in future studies for all these dimensions.
Context Moderators
As noted in the analysis DEMO out previously, the 75% rule suggests that there are
moderators of DEMO EO–performance relationship. Two types of moderators are commonly
considered in meta-analysis. The ﬁrst relates to the research context in which the studies
have been DEMO out and the second relates to measurement issues (Brown, Davidsson,
& Wiklund, 2001; Ellis, 2006). We ﬁrst examine research context.
The examination of moderators in meta-analysis is limited to these variables that DEMO
be coded based on the included studies and which also have theoretical justiﬁcation (Ellis,
2006). Previous EO studies have discussed and tested some potential moderator variables
but there is no agreement on suitable moderators. DEMO summary of the studies reported
in Table 1 allows us to identify and code some contextual moderators, which also are
theoretically justiﬁable.
The ﬁrst moderator relates to the size of the business. The EO of a DEMO is typically
investigated through top management. This is an accepted approach (DEMO & Slevin,
1989). The smaller the organization, the greater DEMO inﬂuence can be exerted by top
management, not needing to rely DEMO involving middle managers. Furthermore, smaller
organizations are more ﬂexible, allowing them to quickly change and take advantage of
new opportunities appearing in the DEMO There is reason to believe, therefore, that
the effect of EO on performance is greater in small organizations. Three size categories
were therefore DEMO: micro (1 to 49 employees), small (50–499 employees), DEMO large
enterprises (more than 500 employees). Section 4 of Table DEMO displays the relationship
between EO and performance for these three size classes. The corrected correlation was
.345 for micro, .198 for small, and DEMO for large businesses. The z-test indicated that the
effect size of micro businesses was signiﬁcantly higher than among small businesses
(z = 2,56, p < .05). The other differences were not statistically signiﬁcant. These results
provide some support for the fact that business size moderates the DEMO between
EO and performance. The examination of the sampling error variance indicated that it
was well below 75% for all three size categories, indicating the presence of additional
moderators.
Industry is another variable that may moderate DEMO relationship between EO and
performance. Businesses operating in dynamic industries where technology and/or
customer preferences change rapidly are more likely to beneﬁt from DEMO
initiatives. We therefore coded the studies into high-tech and nonhigh-tech industries.
High-tech industries included computer software and hardware, biotechnology, electric
and electronic products, pharmaceuticals, and new energy. Section 5 of Table 2 shows that
the corrected EO-performance correlation was .396 in high-tech industries and .231 in
other DEMO This difference is statistically signiﬁcant (z = 2.24, p < .05), supporting
the argument that businesses in high-tech industries beneﬁt more from DEMO an EO.
The concept of EO was initially conceptualized as culturally universal, assuming
that it should be valid in various different countries. However, DEMO and Dess
(2005) suggested that examining cultural effects on the strength of the EO–performance
776
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
relationship is a promising avenue for future research. While one study shows DEMO national
culture (femininity and collectivism) moderates the relationship between EO and strategic
decisions (Marino et al., 2002), we are not aware DEMO studies that explicitly examine how
national culture variables moderate the EO–performance relationship. Therefore, we do
not expect any speciﬁc culture dimension to be associated with stronger or weaker effects.
Furthermore, although a large number of studies have examined the relationship between
EO and performance, the number of observations is small in each individual country.
Since there are certain culture similarities DEMO continents (see the GLOBE study, House,
Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004), we aggregated the data to refer to DEMO
continents. Section 6 of Table 2 shows that the corrected effect sizes were .261 in the
United States, .281 in Europe, .404 in DEMO, and .429 in Australia. The differences in these
effect sizes were DEMO signiﬁcant, suggesting that relationships with performance seem to
be relatively similar DEMO magnitude across countries.
Measurement Moderators
Next we turn to measurement moderators. The studies were ﬁrst coded based on three
types of performance categories: perceived nonﬁnancial, perceived ﬁnancial, and archival
ﬁnancial performance. Perceived nonﬁnancial performance includes DEMO using satis-
faction, goal attainment, or global success ratings as performance indicators. These
measures share a subjective assessment of nonﬁnancial success measures. For DEMO,
Yoo (2001) studied 277 ﬁrms and included employee job satisfaction and public image of
a ﬁrm in the dependent variable. Measures of DEMO performance include studies using
growth measures, such as sales growth, and accounting-based criteria, such as ROI or
ROA. These subdimensions partially overlap, DEMO theoretically and statistically (see
Combs et al., 2005). If the ﬁnancial performance was based on information provided by
key informants, such as the CEO, we coded the study as using perceived ﬁnancial
performance. A typical example of perceived ﬁnancial performance is the study by
Becherer and DEMO (1999) who asked company presidents to indicate the change in
annual sales and proﬁts compared to three years ago. If the ﬁnancial information DEMO based
on objective sources, such as company records, we coded the study as using archival
ﬁnancial performance. For example, George et al. (DEMO) collected the performance
measures from the Bank Directory of Columbia a DEMO after the date when EO was
collected. In an attempt to account for the dimensionality of ﬁnancial performance, we
further distinguished between growth and proﬁtability. Growth consisted of studies mea-
suring changes in sales, proﬁts, DEMO employment (e.g., Becherer & Maurer). Proﬁtability
was predominantly assessed by accountant bases indicators (e.g., Zahra, 1996).
Section 3 of Table 2 presents the relationships between the global EO measure and
the three DEMO of performance, indicating that they were of similar magnitude. The
corrected DEMO of the EO-perceived ﬁnancial measures of performance was the
highest (corrected DEMO = .250); next followed the EO-perceived nonﬁnancial performance
measures (corrected DEMO = .240); the EO-archival ﬁnancial performance measures had the
lowest correlation (corrected r = .213). Testing the statistical signiﬁcance of the differ-
ences, the z-statistic indicated that the differences were not statistically signiﬁcant. Divid-
ing ﬁnancial performance into growth and proﬁtability revealed effect sizes of similar
DEMO The corrected correlation between EO and growth was .245 and the corrected
correlation between EO and proﬁtability was .259; this difference was not statistically
signiﬁcant. The ﬁnding that different performance indicators produce effect sizes of
similar DEMO is surprising in part because Ellis (2006) found that self-perceptive
performance measures produced larger correlations of the relationship between market

orientation and performance. Given that the vast majority of EO studies relying DEMO
self-perceived performance measures are cross-sectional in nature relying on single
informants, DEMO inevitably introduces the risk of common method bias, which could
inﬂate DEMO relationship between EO and perceptive performance measures. Our analysis
revealed, however, that common method bias is not an important issue here.
Next, we divided studies into two groups depending on whether or not they used DEMO
Covin and Slevin (1986, 1989) instrument (k = 37) DEMO if they relied on some modiﬁcation
of this instrument (k = DEMO). The original Covin and Slevin scale produced similar
EO–performance relationships (DEMO r = .235) as other variants of the instrument
(corrected r = .265). Thus, experimenting with different scale formats did not lead to a
lower degree of validity of the EO scale.
Discussion
The DEMO interest in entrepreneurship has virtually exploded in recent years. For
example, DEMO number of studies on EO and performance increased more than ﬁve-fold in
the past decade compared to the previous one. At the same time, the ﬁeld is struggling with
establishing a common body of knowledge. Does DEMO represent a promising area for
building such a body of knowledge? DEMO and conﬂicting results on how EO
relates to performance and the dimensionality of the construct hampers further develop-
ment. Moreover, moderators have not yet been sufﬁciently emphasized in this literature.
This situation—controversy, different results, lack DEMO research on moderators, conceptual
imprecision, and a substantial number of empirical studies—suggest that meta-analysis is
a promising way forward and a natural next DEMO
Effects and Measurement of EO
Our results support the notion that EO has positive performance implications. By
statistical standards, the effects of EO on performance can be regarded as moderately large
(Cohen, 1977). For DEMO, the corrected correlation of .242 found in our meta-analysis
is of DEMO similar magnitude as the relationship between sleeping pills and short-term
improvements in insomnia (see Meyer et al., 2001). Thus, our results clearly show that
businesses are likely to beneﬁt from pursuing an EO, which points to the relevance of
EO research. In other words, EO inﬂuences outcomes that are relevant to a wide set of
management scholars and DEMO managers. Theories of contingencies in explaining perfor-
mance relationships (Lawrence & DEMO, 1967) are also supported by our ﬁndings.
Therefore, it is DEMO to conclude that EO represents a promising area for building a
cumulative body of relevant knowledge about entrepreneurship. Our results also suggest
some recommendations DEMO how future EO research should be conducted.
Consistent with Covin and Slevin’s (1989) belief that EO represents a unidimensional
construct, most studies have summed across all dimensions of EO to create a single
variable. Only DEMO of the studies analyzed show how the individual dimensions of EO were
related to performance. Our ﬁndings support the idea that EO dimensions (innovation, risk
taking, and proactiveness) are of equal importance in explaining business performance.
This would suggest that it is reasonable to support the use DEMO a summed index of the three
dimensions in future studies aiming at explaining performance. The data also show that
the validity does not suffer DEMO researchers attempt careful modiﬁcations of the original
scale by Covin and Slevin. Future research would beneﬁt from pursuing alternative
778
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
approaches to measuring EO. We realize, for example, that additional dimensions
DEMO in the literature, such as competitive aggressiveness and autonomy (that could
not be included in our analysis because there were not enough studies DEMO measured these
variables), may produce different relationships with performance. Moreover, DEMO data did
not allow us to test whether or not different dimensions interact differently with third
variables. Therefore, we conclude that there is room for the Covin and Slevin instrument
as well as for new measurement DEMO
Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that developing new and improved measures DEMO
EO can possibly beneﬁt future EO research. Moreover, our meta-analysis provides DEMO
mates of convergent validities of different instruments used to measure EO; DEMO Covin and
Slevin (1989) scale and other instruments measuring EO exhibit correlations with perfor-
mance that are similar in size. Additional work is DEMO needed to establish the psychometric
properties of instruments addressing additional dimensions of EO. Most of the studies
included in our meta-analysis used measures of DEMO that converged into a single factor
of EO (e.g., Chadwick, DEMO, & Barnett, 1999; Covin, Prescott, & Slevin, 1990; DEMO
et al., 2001; Walter et al., 2006; Wiklund, 1998)DEMO However, arguments provided in the EO
literature (George, 2006; Stetz et al., 2000) suggest that it may be more appropriate to
DEMO antecedences and consequences of EO at the level of the dimensions of EO. Thus,
future research effort needs to develop reliable and valid DEMO of the dimensions of EO.
Moderators
Across studies, we found considerable DEMO in the magnitude of the correlation
between EO and performance and this variance could not be explained by sampling error
alone. This indicates that DEMO variables moderate the strength of the EO-performance
relationship. We identiﬁed three such moderator variables that we could include in our
meta-analysis: national culture (DEMO into continents); business size; and techno-
logical intensity of the DEMO Surprisingly, we did not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant
differences between the DEMO, although the point estimates for continents ranged
from .261 to .429. DEMO, these differences were not signiﬁcant, because variation
within continents were also high. Thus, the best conclusion at this moment is that the
relationship between EO and performance is of similar magnitude in different cultural
contexts. DEMO that EO–performance research has spread rapidly across the world in
recent years, this is an encouraging ﬁnding because it appears that this type of research is
valid and valuable in many contexts and that the instruments DEMO are robust to cultural
contexts and to translations. Knight (1997) noted some response differences between
French- and Anglo-Canadian respondents and Marino et al. (2002) found that national
culture moderated the relationship between EO and strategic alliance portfolio extensive-
ness. However, such differences do not overthrow the relatively strong positive relation-
ship between EO and performance in different cultures. These DEMO suggest that
examining the EO-performance relationship in an additional country is not a sufﬁcient
contribution in and of itself. In contrast, additional theoretical cultural hypotheses can be
tested proﬁtably. For example, speciﬁc EO dimensions (such DEMO competitive aggressive-
ness) may be less valid in certain cultural contexts DEMO frown upon high competitiveness.
We found some indications that size moderates the EO–performance relationship. The
association was stronger in micro businesses than in small DEMO, but there were no
differences between micro and large businesses or DEMO small and large businesses. It
is difﬁcult to draw any deﬁnite conclusions from this ﬁnding other than testing size as a
moderator in individual DEMO Presently, size is typically used as a control variable, but
it would be valuable to test it also as a moderator. Moreover, it would be interesting to

779
establish at which size the effects of CEO perceptions of EO on DEMO performance are
reduced, because it tells us something about the direct DEMO that the CEO has on the
company.
Differences were also found between high-tech and nonhigh-tech ﬁrms, with a stron-
ger EO–performance relationship in the former group. Given the dynamism and rapid
technological changes in high-tech industries, it appears logical that EO pays off more in
such industries. Although DEMO is often included as a control variable, industry has
not been DEMO examined as a moderator variable. However, aspects of the ﬁrm’s
task DEMO appear in many studies, also as a moderator variable. When tested,DEMO
task environment constructs such as dynamism and hostility have been shown to moderate
the relationship between EO and performance. This approach is supported by DEMO
ﬁndings. Although industry and task environment represent different conceptualizations
of the ﬁrm’s environment, we believe both represent valuable moderators, and continued
effort along DEMO lines are valuable in order to gain a deeper understanding of the
EO–performance relationship.
Considerable variance across studies remained in all our analyses. This DEMO
moderator variables in addition to the ones we could address in our meta-analysis. Apart
from the speciﬁc moderators pointed out previously, we recommend that future research,
to a greater extent, test moderator effects. To date, the vast majority of the reviewed
studies assume a direct effect of EO on performance. However, studies empirically testing
and reporting moderator effects found support for them (e.g., Frese, Brantjes, & Hoorn,
2002; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003). Detailed examination of the conditions under which
EO is particularly beneﬁcial (or detrimental) to performance is an area DEMO substantial
theoretical and empirical contributions can be made in future research. The research
designs of previous studies limited the assessment of moderators in our DEMO
However, the literature has identiﬁed several interesting moderator variables that remain
DEMO be tested (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1989; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996).
Performance Measures
Our results indicated that EO has similar relationships with perceived ﬁnancial perfor-
mance, perceived nonﬁnancial indicators of performance, and DEMO performance. It is
well established in the literature that the strategic activities implied by an EO, such as
developing new products, have ﬁnancial DEMO implication of this ﬁnding is that
the primary function of an EO is to enhance ﬁnancial outcomes rather than to advance other
goals that DEMO and their managers may pursue. However, although the correlation
between EO DEMO both perceived and archival ﬁnancial performance was strongly positive,
it was not signiﬁcantly larger than the correlation between EO and perceived nonﬁnancial
performance DEMO This suggests that the EO-performance relationship is robust not
only to different measures of EO, as previously reported, but also to differences in DEMO
measurement of performance. Given the difﬁculty of assessing objective ﬁnancial perfor-
mance measures in most countries, this is good news to scholars interested in EO research.
It appears that the potential problem of common method variance, memory decay, or social
desirability associated with self-reporting of performance does not generally pose a serious
threat to the validity of the EO-performance relationship. DEMO use of archival performance
data produced relationships of similar magnitude.
Limitations and Future Research
Our meta-analysis has some limitations. These limitations can be attributed DEMO part to
the limitations of the underlying studies leading to suggestions for improvements in future
780
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
studies. First, all studies on EO apply only to surviving ﬁrms. None of the studies examined
survivor bias. It seems likely that risk taking DEMO by EO might also lead to higher
chances of failure. By deﬁnition, risk is associated with greater outcome variance. We
strongly encourage future research to address whether the characteristics that lead to higher
performance among surviving DEMO are also associated with a higher risk of failure.
A second observation is that the causal direction between EO and performance has not
been DEMO Most of the studies could not test the effect of EO on performance in a
strict sense because they used either cross-sectional data or DEMO measured EO at one point
in time and performance some years later. While there are conceptual arguments in favor
of EO affecting performance, the other causal direction is also possible: Better perfor-
mance might also stimulate EO. Access to slack resources, for example, encourages
experimentation within ﬁrms, allowing them to pursue new opportunities (March &
Simon, 1968). Large resource pools also cushion the ﬁrm from environmental shocks,
should DEMO initiatives fail, thus encouraging riskier initiatives (Zahra & Covin, 1995)DEMO
Panel studies that repeatedly measure both EO and performance would be valuable
because they could help to tease apart the causal relationship between EO DEMO perfor-
mance and can be used to address survivor bias by correcting for sample attrition.
Our third observation highlights that many studies (n = 45), even those published in
reputable academic journals, did not report basic descriptive statistics, making meta-
analysis difﬁcult. Thus, we concur with DEMO to increase the methodological standards of
the ﬁeld (Low & MacMillan, 1988), including requirements to report descriptive statistics
in all publications.
Finally, our study provides an estimate of the “true” relationship between EO and DEMO
performance. The correlation of .242 is a benchmark that other studies can use to ask the
question whether they have been able to increase DEMO variance, for example, by
improving the scales of EO or by examining relevant moderators that may affect the
EO–performance relationship. Potential moderator variables DEMO ﬁrm age (older ones
with more established habits being less positively DEMO by EO), environmental dyna-
mism (rewarding a higher EO), DEMO culture (performance- and future-oriented cul-
tures positively moderating EO), strategy DEMO (low-cost strategy ﬁrms being less
positively affected by EO than differentiation DEMO ﬁrms), and organizational structure
(formalization). Our study suggests that DEMO is time to open up EO research to new ideas and
to further examine the role of moderators (e.g., Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Thus, it is our
hope that future research can build on the ﬁndings of this meta-analysis to enhance
understanding of entrepreneurship and strengthen DEMO theoretical base.
