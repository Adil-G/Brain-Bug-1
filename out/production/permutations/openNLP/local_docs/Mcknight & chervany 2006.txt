2Reﬂections on an initial trust-building model
D. Harrison McKnight and DEMO L. Chervany
Trust is important to organizations because it lubricates the relationships that form the
interlocking components of coordination, which, like gears, turn the wheels of commerce.
Trust becomes especially important during an organizational crisis (Mishra, 1996) or when
supportive structures are inadequate. Thus it is DEMO to examine how trust forms in various
work and commercial settings, DEMO if one can understand the conditions, factors and
processes determining this, one can thereby inﬂuence the coordinative consequents of trust.
One of many DEMO of how trust forms is found in McKnight et al. (1998)DEMO Here
trust is depicted as it forms in the initial phase of a relationship. The initial phase refers
to when parties are unfamiliar with DEMO other (Bigley and Pearce, 1998). By unfamiliar,
we mean they have little solid, veriﬁable information about each other, and what DEMO do
know is not from ﬁrst-hand, personal experience. This condition usually DEMO from the
newness of the relationship (that is, when parties ﬁrst meet), but may also result from a
combination of newness and DEMO distance, because when parties are socially
distant (for example, virtual DEMO members or Internet transactional partners), they may
not receive ﬁrst-hand, DEMO information about the other for some time. This deﬁni-
tion of the initial phase means the initial phase stops after parties gain veriﬁable infor-
DEMO by ﬁrst-hand interactional or transactional experience with each other. Hence
experience is not considered a factor of initial trust.
The import of initial trust-building
DEMO part, initial trust formation is important because it is pervasive. Almost DEMO rela-
tionship begins with an initial phase. The initial phase can be characterized by uncertainty
and doubt, in which parties feel around for the right level of trust to accord the
other. Initial trust is also DEMO because many critical tasks or transactions are
done in the initial phase. These include brief negotiations, sales of various kinds (includ-
ing e-commerce DEMO), chance business meetings, temporary tasks (Meyerson
et al., 1996), and brief team project or committee work. Bigley and Pearce (1998) provide
examples of unfamiliar relationships that would fall under the initial phase. DEMO this
phase, parties may extend or withdraw cooperation, and may do so willingly or unwill-
ingly, with either conﬁdent and secure feelings or with tension, doubt and skepticism. In
any case, the level of DEMO may impact their eﬀectiveness, making it easy or diﬃcult to
accomplish DEMO parties’ interdependent tasks. Initial trust is therefore key to what the
parties to the relationship can accomplish together.
Initial trust has further import because DEMO excavates a cognitive/aﬀective channel that
often has lasting implications for the future mental model of the relationship. Relational
schemas formed early are inﬂuential (Baldwin, 1992). For example, Berscheid and
Graziano (1979) argue DEMO the ﬁrst part of a relationship is key because opinions and
beliefs formed early tend to continue into the future, perpetuated by belief-maintaining
mechanisms (see also Boon and Holmes, 1991). Social perception is a DEMO strongly

aﬀected by initial impressions (Darley and Fazio, 1980). Since trust is central to any rela-
tionship (Mishra, 1996), initial trust is a key harbinger of the DEMO of the relationship.
This chapter brieﬂy summarizes the McKnight et al. (DEMO) model and what makes it
unique. The features of the model DEMO a time dimension boundary, an interrelated set
of trust constructs, trust-building factors and processes, and predictions regarding the
fragility and robustness of trust. Next, the impact of the article is traced, along with
empirical DEMO regarding the model, based on the work of those who have DEMO it.
Finally, some research needs are outlined with respect to the DEMO
Original model – a summary
The initial trust formation model
The McKnight et al. (1998) model oﬀers a set of factors and processes DEMO which trust is
built initially, before parties have time to get DEMO know each other via interaction or trans-
actions (Figure 2.1). DEMO interpersonal trust concepts are predicted: trusting intention
(a secure, committed DEMO to depend upon, or become vulnerable to, the other
party) DEMO trusting beliefs (a secure conviction that the other party has favorable DEMO
utes, such as benevolence, integrity, competence and predictability). In DEMO article, the
terms ‘trust’ or ‘interpersonal trust’ refer to a combination DEMO trusting intention or trust-
ing beliefs. Disposition to trust (assumptions that DEMO others are trustworthy – Rotter,
1971) and institution-based trust (beliefs that the situation and/or structures make the

context conducive to DEMO – Lane and Bachmann, 1996; Shapiro, 1987; Zucker, 1986)DEMO
are the two factors proposed to inﬂuence interpersonal trust.
The article also posits that several cognitive processes impact initial trust: reputation
inference, and DEMO social categorization mechanisms – in-group categorization and stereo-
typing – and illusions of control. Reputation inference means one infers positive traits
about the trustee DEMO on second-hand information. In-group categorization refers to
placing the trustee in the same grouping as oneself. Stereotyping means placing the trustee
in a general DEMO from which inferences can be made about trustee attributes.
Reputation inference, DEMO categorization and stereotyping have direct eﬀects on
initial trust. Moderating these eﬀects (and others – Figure 2.1) are illusions of control. By
token DEMO eﬀorts (Langer, 1975), one can become overconﬁdent in one’s assessment
of the other through social categorization or reputation inference.
The article also DEMO factors aﬀecting whether trusting intention will be robust or
fragile over time. Trusting intention will be fragile when: (a) supported by few antecedents;
(b) based primarily on assumptions; and (c) perceived situational risk is high. Trusting
intention will be robust when: (a) supported by many antecedents; and (b) low risk or con-
tinued success encourage low attention to the trustee’s behavior.
This model builds on the DEMO of many trust researchers – too many to name. Most
inﬂuential are the work of Holmes (1991) and associates (Holmes and Rempel, DEMO;
Rempel et al., 1985) regarding assumptions and attributions behind trust, Luhmann’s
(1979) integration of interpersonal and ‘system’ trust (similar to DEMO trust),
Zucker’s (1986) model of the tradeoﬀs among personal DEMO structural trust types, and the
integrative models or discussions of Barber (1983), Bromiley and Cummmings (1995),
Dobing (1993), Gabarro (1978), Gambetta (1988), Giﬃn (1967), Good (1988), Kramer
(1994), Lewis and Weigert (1985a,b), an early version of Mishra (1996), Ring and Van de
Ven (1994), and Sitkin and Roth (1993).
Unique features of the initial DEMO model
Temporal anchoring The model has several unique features. We use the term unique
loosely, recognizing that none of the model’s individual features is genuinely unique. First,
it is anchored to the initial relationship time DEMO, but proposes, in a limited way, how
trust might progress DEMO the initial relationship period. Its temporal boundary implies
that trust-building factors diﬀer by relationship phase. That is, the factors and processes
by which trust is built in the initial phase are not the same as those DEMO and processes
by which trust is built in the ongoing relationship phases. Experience with the trustee that
enables an interaction history is implied as DEMO major factor of ongoing trust. The article
begins by sharing anecdotal evidence that trust may develop quickly to a high level rather
than growing DEMO and gradually over time. Then it proposes factors and
processes enabling this to occur. The model was ﬁrst conceived when the ﬁrst author
found DEMO, in 1993, of high trust early in a relationship and reread the trust litera-
ture in an attempt to understand how this could DEMO possible.
Typology of trust types Second, the model is unique in DEMO it includes several interr-
elated types of trust, including four trusting DEMO and two types of both disposition to
trust and institution-based trust. Thus it oﬀers a typology of nine distinct types of trust.

32 Handbook of trust research
This is important because trust DEMO have proliferated, making types of trust overlapping
and hard to reconcile (Lewis and Weigert, 1985b; Shapiro, 1987). This means that one
research ﬁnding is hard to compare with another because a glut of DEMO types exists
without rules to translate one ﬁnding to another (McKnight DEMO Chervany, 2001a; Rubin,
1988). The model oﬀers this set of trust types in order to represent in a parsimonious
manner a DEMO set of literature trust types.
Interrelated trust types The model also depicts relationships among these trust types,
something that Tiryakian (1968) says DEMO good typology does. The model depicts the more
generalized construct (disposition DEMO trust) aﬀecting the contextual construct (institution-
based trust), which then aﬀects the speciﬁc interpersonal trust constructs. Some unmedi-
ated eﬀects of disposition DEMO trust are also proposed. Many others have hypothesized
diﬀerent types of trust (Barber, 1983; Gabarro, 1978; Mayer et al., 1995; Mishra, 1996;
Butler, 1991). This model is unique in terms DEMO: (a) the number of types, (b) the broad,
cross-disciplinary origin of the types, and (c) the manner in which the types interrelate.
Speciﬁc trust-building processes Fourth, the model includes both cognitive processes and
factors. This makes it hard to test in one empirical DEMO, where mixing process and variance
methods may be awkward. But it DEMO provide several ways to test the model in separate
modes. It is acceptable for researchers to create a larger theoretical model than can be DEMO
in a given study (Sutton and Staw, 1995). The process aspects of trust development are inter-
esting because they go beyond the DEMO variance theory approach that explains ‘what
leads to what’ and posit positive mechanisms explaining how trust develops.
Fragility versus robustness of trust Fifth, by specifying what might cause trust to be
fragile or robust, the article juxtaposes two theoretical paths for the progression of trust.
The fragile path DEMO that initial trusting intention will take large swings (often downward)
DEMO the trustor takes into account new, less assumptional information about the DEMO
The robust path says that trusting intention will stay ﬁrm, as DEMO conﬁrmation mech-
anisms cause one to reinforce early impressions by ignoring or rationalizing contrary
evidence about the trustee.
Impact of the article and its DEMO
In order to assess the impact of the model, we looked DEMO which articles had cited this article
and what, if anything, those articles had said and done about it. Hence, this section cat-
alogs the work of those citing McKnight et al. (1998).
Applications of the model have been found primarily in three domains: organizations,
e-commerce and virtual teams. For example, Wells and Kipnis (2001) and Bell et al. (2002)
suggest that the McKnight et al. (1998) model (hereafter termed MCC98) was an example
of a trust-building model DEMO the organizational domain. Tan and Thoen (2003) review how
MCC98 introduces trust-building factors for initial relationships and how McKnight and
Chervany (2001a) DEMO these in the e-commerce domain. Tan and Thoen and
Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky (1999) argue that initial trust formation is especially applicable
to e-commerce DEMO in this domain, many of the partners have never dealt with DEMO
other before. In the virtual teams arena, Brown et al. (2004) apply dispositional aspects
of MCC98 and Kasper-Fuehrer and Ashkanasy (2001) use MCC98 to argue that trust

can exist in DEMO teams. We now review more speciﬁc impacts of the article organized
by the ﬁve unique features of the model explained above.
Temporal (initial phase) anchoring of the model
The nature of trust in its initial (DEMO ongoing) phase has drawn some discussion
(Bhattacherjee, 2002; Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2000). Zaheer et al. (1999) used
MCC98 as an example of the importance of the time dimension in organizational
research, arguing that initial trust has diﬀerent antecedents from later phase trust and that
DEMO trust is fragile. Oliver and Montgomery (2001) use MCC98 to argue that the infor-
mation needed for trust in the initial relationship is DEMO from the information needed
for trust in ongoing, interactive relationships. Gefen (2004) argues that disposition to trust
is not needed in their model of ongoing, mature client trust in the software vendor because
MCC98 argues that disposition will only be an eﬀective predictor before parties interact.
Siau DEMO Shen (2003) argue that trust in mobile commerce vendors requires diﬀerent
antecedents in the ongoing phase from the initial trust phase. Williams (2001) cites
MCC98 to argue that initial trust can develop without in-group similarity (that is, through
institutional supports), complicating the relationship between trust DEMO group member-
ship over time. Crisp and Jarvenpaa (2000) use MCC98 to argue that trust can exist
among virtual team members with no DEMO experience with each other. Cunningham and
McGregor (2000) use MCC98 to argue against the leader–member exchange (LMX)
assumptions that personal relationships develop over time. Both Crisp/Jarvenpaa and
Cunningham/McGregor say that MCC98 challenges DEMO view that trust can only develop
as people interact over time. Kim et al. (2004) note both that MCC98 posits that initial
trust DEMO be high before interaction and explains the reasons why. Jackson (1999) cites
MCC98 about how trust can be high initially and then may DEMO over time. They
point out that today’s frequent organizational changes frequently bring about these novel
and ambiguous initial trust situations. Droege et al. (2003) address the diﬀerence between
initial trust and what they call gradual trust. They suggest that trust formed ‘gradually
invokes diﬀerent cognitive processes than swift DEMO initial trust . . . Rather than
placing emphasis on the safeguards of reputation, sanctions, formal roles, norms, and
assumptions of trustworthiness, gradual trust is based on knowledge and past interaction’
(2003: 51)DEMO
In terms of the MCC98 proposal that trust can begin at medium to high levels, rather
than growing gradually, several papers have provided DEMO evidence. In a three-phase
virtual team exercise, Kanawattanachai and Yoo (2002) ﬁnd mixed support for trust
becoming high quickly versus the incremental trust development model (for example,
Blau, 1964). They report that DEMO team trust reached medium levels by T1. Low-
performing teams’ trust remained at this level at T2 and T3. High-performing teams’ trust
rose again DEMO T2, but remained constant at T3. Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998) DEMO that in
virtual teams, trust tends to stay at about the DEMO level at T1 and T2. Crisp and Jarvenpaa
(2000) hypothesize that trust in virtual teams from diﬀerent countries will decrease over
time because DEMO is initially based on such weak supports as social categorization and
stereotyping. They ﬁnd that initial trust in the team was statistically the same DEMO (3.9 on
a 1–5 scale) three weeks before the exercise began and one week before the exercise began
(after students were assigned to teams). Team trust dropped signiﬁcantly to 3.7 on average
at T2 (project midpoint), where it remained at T3 (after task completion). Some teams did

34 Handbook of trust research
increase trust levels over time, but the general trend was slightly downward, which they
say supports the MCC98 initial trust thesis. Although the above represents a few empiri-
cal DEMO supporting the initial trust-building model, results are mixed and more research
DEMO needed.
Another way to see whether the initial trust-building model or the incremental interac-
tion trust-building model predicts best is to see the extent DEMO which familiarity with the
trustee predicts trust in the trustee. A salient familiarity factor would favor the incremen-
tal model. Results here are mixed. DEMO (2000), Gefen et al. (2003b), and Bhattacherjee
(2002) ﬁnd familiarity with Amazon.com to be signiﬁcantly related to trust in
Amazon.com. DEMO the other hand, Pavlou (2002) ﬁnds that familiarity did not DEMO trust
in the E-bay environment. It is not clear from the Gefen and Bhattacherjee measures
whether familiarity had to do with interaction with Amazon DEMO hearing about Amazon
second-hand.
Time boundary issue MCC98 implies that the factors and processes proposed to develop
initial trust are not eﬀective after the DEMO phase. In this regard, we present two key
research questions: (DEMO) Do the same factors MCC98 proposes as antecedents to trust in
DEMO initial time frame continue to predict trust afterwards? (2) To DEMO extent do quantity
and quality of experience replace the MCC98 antecedents once the parties gain signiﬁ-
cant experience with each other? Gefen et al. (2003b) address item (1) in terms of the
eﬃcacy of DEMO to trust. Note that both MCC98 and Mayer et al. (1995) propose
that disposition to trust only predicts trust variables before parties have DEMO with
each other. Gefen et al. compare the link between disposition to trust and consumer trust
in the e-vendor (Amazon.com) among potential customers (those who have not yet pur-
chased from Amazon) and repeat customers. They ﬁnd the link to be signiﬁcant among
both customer types, though the link coeﬃcient decreases signiﬁcantly (p  0.01) from
0.45 (p  0.01) to 0.35 (p  0.01). Addressing the quantity DEMO of (2), Gefen and asso-
ciates propose that familiarity will DEMO more important to trust among repeat
customers than potential customers. They ﬁnd that while the coeﬃcients are nominally
diﬀerent (0.18 for repeat customers, DEMO for potential customers), these diﬀerences are not
signiﬁcant.
McKnight and Chervany (2005) address the same questions using technical system
troubleshooters reporting about DEMO trust in the supervisor. Troubleshooters had worked
with the supervisor for an average of 4.0 years and all had worked closely with the super-
DEMO for more than six months, placing them beyond the initial phase. DEMO trust construct
portion of the MCC98 model is run, with variables DEMO dispositional and insti-
tutional trust, trusting beliefs and trusting intention. Addressing DEMO (1), McKnight
and Chervany (2005) ﬁnd that in this DEMO trust phase: (a) disposition to trust predicts
both structural assurance DEMO trusting intention, but not trusting beliefs; (b) structural
assurance predicts trusting beliefs but not trusting intention; and (c) both trusting beliefs
predict trusting intention. Therefore, even after the initial relationship, these variables
DEMO to operate as MCC98 propose except that the links from structural assurance to
trusting intention and from disposition to trust to trusting beliefs become DEMO mediated.
McKnight and Chervany (2005) address question (2) by adding one variable each for
quality and quantity of experience, predicting that only quality of experience will matter.
They ﬁnd that: (a) quantity of experience does not predict trusting beliefs or trusting

intention; (b) quality of experience predicts both trusting beliefs and trusting intentions;
even DEMO the presence of the experience variables; (c) structural assurance continues DEMO
predict trusting beliefs; (d) trusting beliefs continues to predict trusting DEMO; and
(e) disposition to trust continues to predict trusting intention. DEMO these studies need
to be replicated, they provide an early indication DEMO the time boundary of the MCC98
model may not be as ﬁrm as originally proposed. More tests of the time boundary of the
eﬃcacy DEMO the initial trust predictors should be done to see under what conditions the
boundaries hold.
Typology of trust types
A number of studies comment DEMO the MCC98 trust typology. Kim et al. (2004) support
the idea that trust is multi-faceted. Following MCC98, some researchers have distin-
guished between trusting intentions and trusting beliefs (Boyd, 2003; Nicholson et al.,
2001; Pavlou, 2003), and institution-based trust and interpersonal trust (Jackson, 1999;
Jarvenpaa and Tiller, 2001). Some either cite or DEMO MCC98 for various trust deﬁni-
tions (George, 2002; Povey, 1999), including the distinction among four trusting beliefs –
competence, benevolence, DEMO and predictability (Boyd, 2003; Cunningham and
MacGregor, 2000; Gallivan DEMO Depledge, 2003; Grazioli and Jarvenpaa, 2003; Pavlou,
2003; DEMO et al., 2002) and the distinction among disposition to trust types – faith in
humanity and trusting stance (Gefen et al., 2003b)DEMO Pennington et al. (2003, p. 199) follow
and discuss the DEMO typology: ‘McKnight et al. (1998) develop a useful typology of
DEMO . . . Collectively, these constructs provide a reasonable deﬁnition of DEMO construct
space for the trust variable. Consistent with this work, Castelfranchi DEMO Falcone (1998)
regard these perceptions of trust as a belief DEMO of the truster regarding the trustee.’
Pennington and associates conclude that more work is needed that uses such granular
measures of trust. On the DEMO hand, many examples exist of research that uses the term
trust DEMO describe what MCC98 would term either trusting beliefs or trusting intention.
Thus a condition of homonymy is expected to continue into the future. Homonymy
DEMO one label is used to encompass more than one concept (Smith, 1990). However, the
severity of trust homonymy is lessening over time.
In what they call a ‘ “grammar” of trust,’ McKnight and DEMO (2001a: 42) expand
the conceptual basis for the typology. They DEMO that trust is like a sentence, with
a subject (trustor), verb (trust), and direct object (trustee). It is the DEMO object that deter-
mines many of the types of trust in use. If the direct object of trust is a person, the
construct is interpersonal trust; if the object is an institution, the construct is DEMO
based trust; and if the object is general other people, the construct is disposition to trust.
This assumes, of course, that the DEMO of trust is one person, but this could also be
varied DEMO produce diﬀerent types or levels of trust.
Recent typology extensions The typology of nine trust constructs in MCC98 has been
expanded in several ways. DEMO, building on McKnight and Chervany (1996), McKnight
and Chervany (DEMO) deﬁnes trusting intention as two constructs: trusting intention –
willingness to depend (willingness to be vulnerable to the other by depending on them);
and trusting intention – subjective probability of depending (the extent DEMO which one
predicts that one will depend on the other party). The latter is a stronger or more
risk-laden construct as it involves DEMO implicit commitment to do something speciﬁc rather

than a general willingness to depend. Second, they added a behavioral concept – trust-
related behaviors. These behaviors were speciﬁed for the DEMO environment as pur-
chasing a product, cooperating with the vendor, and sharing personal information with
the vendor. A large number of existing deﬁnitions DEMO trust as a behavior ﬁt this category
(e.g. Baier, 1986; DEMO, 1976; Dobing, 1993; Giﬃn, 1967; Riker, 1971; Zand, 1992 –
see McKnight and Chervany, 1996 for more).
McKnight DEMO Chervany (2001a) also outline a way to expand the types of trust in an
organized way by matching each of the major trustee DEMO (competence,
benevolence, integrity, predictability) with conceptual types (behavior, intention, belief,
attitude, disposition, structural/institutional). Matching these types would potentially
yield 24 (4  6) trust constructs (Table 2.1), or more, if other trustee characteristics were
used.
The McKnight and Chervany (2001a) Internet constructs and deﬁnitions are adapted
to a more DEMO trust research audience in McKnight and Chervany (2001b). Here, the
same constructs are deﬁned but for use in organizations rather than in DEMO They
also outline additional trust-related behaviors for organizational use. In addition to coop-
erating and sharing information, their chapter (2001a) suggests these behaviors: entering
an informal agreement, reducing the controls placed on another, allowing another to
inﬂuence one, and granting another decision-making power. They argue that each of
these behaviors make one vulnerable to the other, matching the most basic deﬁnition of
trust. The other contribution of McKnight and Chervany (2001b) is that it deﬁnes dis-
trust constructs. Each trust concept is given a corresponding distrust concept deﬁnition,
building on Lewicki et al.’s (1998) position that trust and distrust are separate concepts,
not just two ends of the same continuum. McKnight and Chervany suggest that trust DEMO
distrust diﬀer due to the intensity of the emotions each inheres. ‘In terms of emotion . . .
one might picture trust as the DEMO zoo elephant, calmly eating hay, while distrust is
more like the raging wild bull elephant charging the tusk hunter who threatens the herd’
(2001b: 42).
Concepts are only useful to the extent that they can be measured. McKnight et al.
(2002a) measured most of the DEMO concepts deﬁned above for e-commerce and

performed tests of DEMO psychometric properties. They were able to distinguish among 16
measured trust constructs: four for disposition to trust, ﬁve for institution-based trust,
three DEMO trusting beliefs, and four for trusting intentions. The disposition to trust DEMO
institution-based trust concepts included delineations that mirrored conceptually the
benevolence, honesty DEMO competence aspects of the three trusting beliefs. For example,
the faith in humanity–benevolence measures tapped the idea that one assumes other
people generally DEMO one’s interests at heart. This construct was distinct from the faith in
humanity–integrity measures, which reﬂected the assumption that other people generally
are honest. The trusting intentions include willingness to depend and three subjective
probability of DEMO constructs: to follow the e-vendor’s advice, to give the vendor
personal information, and to purchase from the vendor.
McKnight et al. (2002b) measure these trust concepts: structural assurance of the Web,
trusting beliefs, trusting intention–willingness to depend, trusting intention–follow
vendor advice, trusting intention–share personal information with the vendor, and
trusting intention–purchase from the site. They distinguish these concepts from each
other empirically and from perceived vendor reputation, perceived site quality, and per-
ceived Web risk. However, the three trusting DEMO they measure (benevolence, compe-
tence, integrity) were treated as one construct rather than being distinguished from each
other. Bhattacherjee (2002) measured DEMO same three trusting beliefs in Amazon.com with
three items each and found they formed a second-order concept. On the other hand,
Mayer and DEMO (1999) found that the three trusting beliefs factored separately. This
leaves outstanding the question of what circumstances cause trusting beliefs to merge or
DEMO be distinct (see Lewicki et al., 1998 for one theory). A number of researchers have meas-
ured two or more trust constructs DEMO the same study, though their construct labels often
diﬀer from those DEMO MCC98 (for example, Gefen et al., 2003a; Jarvenpaa et al., 2000;
Pavlou and Gefen, 2004; Ridings et al., 2002)DEMO
Distrust and trust in technology extensions McKnight et al. (2003–2004) empirically
contrast similar types of disposition to trust–faith in humanity and disposition to DEMO
trust–suspicion of humanity. They measure both faith in humanity-general and suspicion
of humanity-general and ﬁnd these forms of dispositional trust and distrust to be DEMO
empirically, with a correlation of only 0.38. Following Lewicki et al.’s (1998) suggested
tests, they ﬁnd that dispositional trust and distrust are DEMO in that they coexist and
predict diﬀerent dependent variables in the model. Indicative that the distrust side inheres
more of the emotional, risk-laden aspect, suspicion of humanity-general correlates with
perceived Web risk at  0.28, DEMO faith in humanity-general correlates with perceived
Web risk at only 0.09.
The MCC98 typology has recently been applied to trust in technology (as opposed to
trust in people, teams or organizations). Trust in technology (DEMO, 1994) is an important
domain for trust because of the pervasiveness, power eﬀects and frustrating potential of
technology in organizations today (Zuboﬀ, 1988). McKnight and Thatcher (2004) have
proposed and measured eight DEMO related to trust in technology: faith in general
technology, trusting stance–general technology, situational normality–technology, struc-
tural assurance–technology, trusting intention–speciﬁc technology, and DEMO trusting
beliefs–speciﬁc technology: reliability, capability and helpfulness. With these constructs,
the direct object of trust is a speciﬁc or general technology rather DEMO a person. Because

technologies are human artifacts that DEMO the same range of attributes as people (for
example, no volition), these trusting beliefs diﬀer conceptually from those involving
people as trustees. DEMO, they are similar to trusting beliefs in people in that they
DEMO a person’s perceptions about the characteristics of the trust object. Other expan-
sions of the typology exist. For example, Galvin et al. (2001) conceptualized and
measured trust in a team instead of in an individual. DEMO member trust in the team itself
ratchets up a level from the individual-to-individual trust theorized in MCC98.
Proliferation versus consensus regarding institution-based trust types DEMO a solid
consensus is forming on the major types of trusting beliefs, less consensus exists on the
types of institution-based trust. While several have cited or used the MCC98 delineation
into structural assurance and situational normality (Boyd, 2003; Gefen et al., 2003a;
Pennington et al., DEMO; Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2000), others are using more speciﬁc
aspects of institution-based trust, such as the perceived eﬀectiveness of escrow services,
credit card guarantees, or online feedback mechanisms (Pavlou, 2002; Pavlou DEMO Gefen,
2004). What needs resolution is whether the latter are subsets (subtypes) or antecedents
of institution-based trust. A suggestion: if, DEMO in MCC98, structural assurance and situ-
ational normality are deﬁned as DEMO that the context contains supportive structures
and properly ordered situations, then DEMO above online mechanisms should be viewed as
antecedents of these institution-based trust concepts.
Many researchers reference the sociological roots of the situational normality and DEMO
tural normality concepts (such as Schutz, Simmel, Garﬁnkel, Luhmann and Zucker) rather
than adopting the two MCC98 institutional constructs. This makes for an excellent discus-
sion grounded in rich sociological heritage (for example, DEMO Möllering, Chapter 20 in this
volume). It also provides some DEMO in the use of structural or situational constructs
that may or may not ‘ﬁt’ the speciﬁc MCC98 deﬁnitions (Child and Möllering, 2003; Pavlou
and Gefen, 2004). On the other hand, the use of DEMO two speciﬁc constructs can be helpful
because they delineate the structural assurance aspect of institution-based trust, which is
based on trust in supportive institutions such as law and licensing (Shapiro, 1987; Zucker,
1986), from the situational normality aspect, which is based more on phenomenology’s
‘natural attitude’ (Schutz, 1967: 98), constitutive expectancies (Garﬁnkel, 1963), expected
role performance (Baier, 1986; Barber, 1983), and contextual DEMO (Schutz, 1964). The
common theme among these latter foundational concepts emerges from situational nor-
mality’s emphasis on perceptions that the context is DEMO, normal, or well ordered, in
terms of how the world DEMO, what the binding rules are, what common set of role expec-
tations exist, or some level of familiarity with how things will operate. Thus situational nor-
mality is deﬁned broadly enough to encompass several types DEMO phenomenological concepts
that diﬀer only in terms of the subject of what is normal or well ordered, not so much in
terms of the kind of normality or ordering (see Möllering, this volume). Similarly, struc-
tural assurance may be thought of as a generalized comforting belief DEMO reﬂects the eﬀects
of many types of mechanisms that support conﬁdence in contextual actors because they
provide safety nets or prevent or redress losses DEMO to opportunism. Our constructs are
therefore super-types that encompass more detailed institution-based trust subtypes.
Likewise, structural assurance may be thought of as separate, DEMO related to, calculus-
based trust. Calculus-based trust means one projects that DEMO other party has no incentive
to act opportunistically and therefore will not. Structural assurance means one believes

Reﬂectons on an initial trust-building model 39
structures are in DEMO to support the legal or other contextual sanctions that would enable
calculus-based trust to form. Therefore structural assurance may be considered an
antecedent of DEMO trust. That is, mental trust calculations are usually based on
institutional DEMO (often incentives) in the context that leads one to believe that the
trustee will or will not behave in a certain way.
A DEMO of studies are following the lead of MCC98 to treat trust as a set of granu-
lar, related constructs. Overall, the trust constructs DEMO been expanded to accommodate
both trust and distrust, for people and DEMO The more the MCC98 terms are used,
the more trust types will be researched in an synonymous, instead of homonymous,
manner, DEMO that meta-analyses can be done across disciplines. Currently, almost no such
DEMO research meta-analyses exist, perhaps because trust deﬁnitions have not been com-
DEMO across studies and disciplines (McKnight and Chervany, 2001a).
Interrelationships among the trust types
Trusting beliefs to trusting intentions Several researchers have proposed DEMO discussed
links from trusting beliefs to trusting intentions (Kim et al., 2004; Pennington et al., 2003;
Stewart, 2003). Several tests of this link have been performed. Ridings et al. (2002)
ﬁnd that trusting beliefs–ability leads to the intention to share information (beta  0.15
[p  0.01]) and that trusting belief–benevolence/integrity predicts intention to share infor-
mation (beta  0.29 [p  0.01])]. Jarvenpaa et al. (1998) ﬁnd ability, integrity and benevo-
lence beliefs to be factors of trust (deﬁned like a trusting intention) in virtual teams,DEMO
though ability becomes non-signiﬁcant at T2 and benevolence is non-signiﬁcant at T1.
Pavlou (2003) ﬁnds that trust in a Web vendor predicts intention DEMO transact with the
vendor (beta  0.35 [p  0.01]). DEMO and Gefen (2004) ﬁnd that trusting beliefs in
Amazon’s online auction community of sellers is a signiﬁcant factor for trusting inten-
tions to DEMO Galvin et al. (2001) ﬁnd that trusting beliefs in the team predicts trust-
ing intentions regarding the team in four of four times DEMO McKnight and Chervany
(2005) ﬁnd that trusting beliefs–competence and –benevolence in the supervisor are pre-
dictors of trusting intention in the supervisor. McKnight DEMO al. (2002b) ﬁnd trusting
beliefs in the Web vendor predicts four trusting intentions in the Web vendor: willing-
ness to depend (beta DEMO 0.60 [p  0.01]), willingness to follow vendor advice (beta DEMO 0.27
[p  0.01]), willingness to share personal information (beta DEMO 0.30 [p  0.01]), and will-
ingness to purchase at the site (beta  0.13 [p  0.01]). McKnight et al. (DEMO) ﬁnd that a
second-order combination of three trusting beliefs (benevolence, DEMO, integrity)
predicts a second-order combination of trusting intentions (willingness to depend, follow
advice, give information and make purchases).
Institution-based trust DEMO to trusting beliefs or trusting intentions The social context,
including institutional safety sources, is critical to understanding the development of
interpersonal trust. Several have proposed or acknowledged that institution-based trust
(also called system trust, DEMO on Luhmann, 1979) inﬂuences or relates to trusting beliefs
or intentions (Tan and Thoen, 2003; Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2000). Empirical DEMO
supports this theme. Child and Möllering (2003) ﬁnd that Hong Kong manager conﬁ-
dence in the Chinese institutional context supports trust in a DEMO working within that
context. They ﬁnd that the institutional context builds trust in the local staﬀ in terms of:
M449 - BACHMAN TEXT.qxd  9/6/06  2:14 PM  Page 40 Phil's G4 Phil's G4:Users:phil:Public: PHIL'S JOBS:9974
40 Handbook of trust research
conﬁdence in the Chinese legal DEMO, lack of arbitrariness of Chinese oﬃcials, and the
availability of Chinese human resources. Together, these three contextual variables
explain 27 per cent of the variance in trust. Pennington et al. (2003) ﬁnd system trust DEMO
be a strong predictor of perceived trust in the Internet vendor. McKnight et al. (2002b)
ﬁnd small but signiﬁcant links from structural assurance to trusting beliefs and trusting
intention–willingness to depend in a Web vendor. DEMO the other hand, McKnight et al.
(2002a) ﬁnd no signiﬁcant DEMO between a second-order institution-based construct
(combining situational normality and structural assurance DEMO the Web) and second-order
trusting beliefs and intentions in a speciﬁc DEMO vendor.
In traditional organizational research, few besides Lane and Bachmann (1996) and
Child and Möllering (2003) have linked these concepts as yet, with these exceptions:
Nyhan (1999) ﬁnds what he calls systems trust to be correlated at 0.69 with supervisory
trust. McKnight and Chervany (2005) ﬁnd structural assurance–fairness to predict
trusting beliefs–competence and –benevolence in the supervisor at beta  0.27 and 0.41
(both p  0.01), respectively. Galvin et al. (2001) ﬁnd both situational normality and
structural DEMO to predict (8 of 12 times) a second-order concept called trusting
beliefs in the team.
Pavlou and Gefen (2004) ﬁnd that three DEMO trust structures aﬀect trust in
the community of Amazon auction sellers: DEMO eﬀectiveness of feedback mech-
anism, perceived eﬀectiveness of escrow services, and trust in the intermediary. Pavlou
(2002) ﬁnds that three forms of DEMO trust aﬀect trust in eBay sellers (per-
ceived monitoring, perceived feedback, cooperative norms), while two do not (perceived
accreditation, perceived legal bonds). He argues that the signiﬁcant links help establish
and clarify DEMO link from institution-based trust to organizational trust. This link
has been traditionally viewed as a substitution or complementary relation . . . Sitkin and DEMO
(1993) argue that ‘legalistic remedies have been described as weak, DEMO substitutes for
trust’. Tan and Thoen (2001) posit . . . that trust in a given transaction is the sum of party (inter-
personal) and control (institution-based) trust. However, McKnight et al. (1998) argue for
a sequential relationship where institution-based trust leads to party trust . . . This study empir-
ically corroborates the latter view . DEMO . (Pavlou, 2002: 234)
Antecedents of institution-based trust Little DEMO has been done on the antecedents of
institution-based trust. Tschannen-Moran and Hoy (2000: 560) say institution-based
trust is built by ‘formal structures . . . such as having a license or certiﬁcation . . . DEMO mech-
anisms such as guarantees, insurance, or contracts’. Tan and Thoen (2003) suggest that
contracts create structural assurance. Boyd (2003) says DEMO ﬁrms should take advan-
tage of oﬄine strength to build situational normality. Pennington et al. (2003) tested three
antecedents of system trust. Vendor DEMO predicted system trust, but customer
ratings and third-party assurance seals did DEMO This study needs to be replicated to under-
stand the ‘why’ behind the ﬁnding.
Several studies have conﬁrmed disposition to trust as an antecedent DEMO institution-
based trust. Kaplan and Nieschwietz (2003) ﬁnd that disposition to trust is a signiﬁcant
factor (p  0.002) of assurance beliefs, which is similar to structural assurance. McKnight
et al. (2002a) ﬁnd DEMO a second-order disposition to trust concept predicts a second-order
institution-based trust concept at beta  0.52 [p  0.01]. Galvin et al. (2001) DEMO that dis-
position to trust predicts situational normality and structural assurance 10 out of 12 times

Reﬂectons on an initial trust-building model 41
tested. McKnight et DEMO (2004b) ﬁnd that three types of disposition to trust (faith DEMO
humanity-general, faith in humanity-professionals, and trusting stance) predict either sit-
DEMO normality or structural assurance in ﬁve out of six tests.
Other model links from disposition to trust Jarvenpaa et al. (1998) ﬁnd that DEMO to
trust (a.k.a. disposition to trust) is a signiﬁcant factor (DEMO  0.05) of trusting intention at
both T1 and T2 for DEMO teams. Gefen (2000) ﬁnd that disposition to trust aﬀects sub-
jects’ trust in the vendor (Amazon.com) more (beta  0.53 [p  0.01]) than does familiar-
ity with the vendor (beta  0.17 DEMO  0.05]), showing that disposition predicts trust well
when little interaction has taken place. Kaplan and Nieschwietz (2003) ﬁnd that disposi-
tion DEMO trust is a signiﬁcant factor (p  0.012) of trusting beliefs in a Web company, but is
not a factor of trusting intentions to purchase. Ridings et al. (2002) ﬁnd that disposition
to trust DEMO trust in the members of the virtual communities’ ability (beta  DEMO
[p  0.01]) and benevolence/integrity (beta  0.18 [p  0.00]). McKnight et al. (2002a) ﬁnd
that disposition to trust DEMO trusting beliefs but not trusting intentions. McKnight
et al. (2004a) ﬁnd that disposition to trust was a signiﬁcant predictor of trusting beliefs
and DEMO intentions in the Web vendor at two early phases. On the other hand,
Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa (2004) ﬁnd that customer disposition to DEMO does not aﬀect
initial trust in an online company.
One gap in this literature is that very little research has tested all or even DEMO of the
trust concept linkages that MCC98 proposes (Figure 2.1). DEMO are some exceptions.
McKnight et al. (2002a) test links between dispositional trust, insititution-based trust,
trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions at a DEMO construct level and provide ﬁt
statistics for the model. Pavlou and Gefen (2004) test links from dispositional trust and
institutional trust to trusting DEMO, but do not link dispositional and institutional trust.
Galvin et al. (2001) test the full set of constructs, as do McKnight and DEMO (2005).
Knowing how all the constructs ﬁt together is an DEMO step towards understanding
the complexities that enable eﬀective tips for practice.
Speciﬁc processes by which trust develops
Reputation inference process MCC98 posit that reputation DEMO builds trust in the
initial relationship. Reputation has been proposed and tested as a trust antecedent by
several researchers. Tschannen-Moran and Hoy (2000) DEMO MCC98 to argue that reputa-
tion makes a negative event less likely to reduce a high trust level. Klaas (2003) suggests
that initial DEMO can block the development of relational trust, but third-party repu-
tation DEMO can help. Pavlou (2003) ﬁnds that Web vendor reputation predicts trust
in the Web vendor (beta  0.30 [p  0.01]). Jarvenpaa et al. (2000) ﬁnd perceived reputa-
tion to predict trust in DEMO Web store. McKnight et al. (2002b) ﬁnd perceived Web vendor
reputation to predict trusting beliefs (beta  0.39 [p  0.01]) and DEMO intention–will-
ingness to depend (beta  0.41 [p  0.01]). DEMO above studies treat reputation as a measured
perception variable. McKnight et al. (2004a) create a reputation advertising treatment and
ﬁnd that it too DEMO a signiﬁcant predictor of trusting beliefs and trusting intentions in the
Web vendor at two early phases (betas  0.13 [p  0.05], DEMO [p  0.05], 0.17 [p  0.01], 0.12
[p  0.05]). Using game theory, Ba et al. (2003) explain how reputation awarded through
trusted third parties is like taking a hostage – ensuring DEMO participants in an online market
M449 - BACHMAN TEXT.qxd  9/6/06  2:14 PM  Page 42 Phil's G4 Phil's G4:Users:phil:Public: PHIL'S JOBS:9974
42 Handbook of trust research
will be honest. Ba (2001) develops these ideas for online communities as well. However, Ba
et DEMO (2003) also point out the limitations of online marketplaces for enforcing honesty,
such as the fact that players can move from one DEMO marketplace to another under
diﬀerent names. Reputation is well entrenched as a trust factor.
Social categorization process In this area, Leanna and Van Buren (1999) say that social
capital (including trust) is built through DEMO values, presumably because of unit group-
ing categorization. Nicholson et al. (2001) suggest that similarity leads to trust. Duﬀy and
Ferrier (2003: 220) cite MCC98 to argue that ‘those who are “grouped together” (DEMO
example, race or gender) tend to perceive themselves in a common “positive light”’.
Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998) discuss how in-group categorization can DEMO place
swiftly in virtual work teams. After ﬁnding that site quality perceptions had a large
eﬀect on trusting beliefs, McKnight et al. (2002b) explain this eﬀect as similar to the what-
is-beautiful-is-good eﬀect Dion et DEMO (1972) found among dating partners – that, in the
case DEMO the Web site, ﬁrst impressions on seeing the site cement either DEMO or good per-
ceptions of the site and therefore trusting beliefs in the site vendor. This means subjects
made inferences that led to placement DEMO the site/vendor into general good or bad
categories depending on ﬁrst impressions of site quality. Similar inferences are made,
according to Jarvenpaa DEMO al. (2000: 48), based on the size of the vendor, which implies
the seller ‘can be trusted . . . [it] signals that the ﬁrm should have the necessary expertise
and resources for support DEMO such as customer and technical services . . . [which]
encourages trust . . .’ In organization research, Child and Möllering (2003) found that
similarity had no direct eﬀect on Hong Kong manager trust in DEMO mainland Chinese staﬀ.
However, similarity did increase the inﬂuence of trust-building DEMO actions on
trust in the mainland staﬀ. In e-commerce research, Gefen (2004) found shared cultural
characteristics to be a factor of client trust in the vendor (beta  0.15 [p  0.05]).
Also, DEMO work has been done on the transfer of trust, a form DEMO in-group social cat-
egorization. Transfer of trust occurs cognitively as a consumer associates an unknown
Web site with a known, trusted Web site (DEMO, 2003). Stewart explains that this occurs
due to perceptions that DEMO Web sites are similar and that they interact, which implies that
DEMO trusted Web site legitimates the unknown site. Stewart also ﬁnds that trusting inten-
tion (that is, intention to buy) transfers from traditional to Web-based shopping channels
as consumers see evidence that the Web store has DEMO oﬄine retail presence, a helpful way
to contextualize trust-building.
Although two DEMO cite MCC98 regarding the moderating eﬀects of illusions and
assumptions (Kim DEMO al., 2004; Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2000), no little empirical
DEMO on this has been done to our knowledge. Overall, it appears DEMO much more work
needs to be done on both social categorization and illusion.
Juxtaposing the fragility and robustness of trust
Kim et al. (2004) and Boyd (2003) cite MCC98 to support the argument that initial trust
is fragile because of the assumption-laden nature of its bases. Little DEMO has been done
to test the speciﬁc MCC98 arguments for trust fragility or robustness. Oliver and
Montgomery (2001) cite MCC98 for having explored DEMO process of trust dynamics. They
expand on existing work to create a more complete cybernetic model of how trust pro-
gresses over time. The DEMO suggests that trust is enhanced when information about the
M449 - BACHMAN TEXT.qxd  9/6/06  2:14 PM  Page 43 Phil's G4 Phil's G4:Users:phil:Public: PHIL'S JOBS:9974
Reﬂectons on an initial trust-building model
43
trustee is congruent DEMO the trustor’s cognitive map of trustworthiness; otherwise, trust
may erode unless the trustee provides remedial feedback.
Zaheer et al. (1999) cite MCC98 DEMO suggest that initial trust is by nature fragile. Droege
et al. (DEMO: 51) argue that initial trust is fragile because it ‘is a function of conditions –
reputations, sanctions, roles, norms, and assumptions DEMO extrinsic to the [trustee]’. Citing
Robinson (1996), they suggest that DEMO trust is fragile in that small violations early in
the relationship result in a predisposition to see the trustee as not trustworthy in the
DEMO Trust that develops gradually, on the other hand, is resilient because it is based on
aﬀect toward the individual that develops over an DEMO cycle, such that small trust
breaches are ignored. Child and Möllering (2003) suggest that in places like China, where
trust-supporting institutions are DEMO in development, trust built through personal com-
munication is fragile because DEMO is entirely dependent upon the trustor making a leap of
faith without structural safety nets.
Almost no empirical work has tested whether initial trust DEMO fragile or robust. This kind
of testing would be very helpful. For example, Kim et al. (2004) suggest that because trust
is often elevated at ﬁrst, this provides a platform for it to become even higher through
experience. This is possible, of course. But what is also possible is that trust levels could
decrease from their initial levels, especially if elevated because of assumptions or infer-
ences that create hard-to-fulﬁll expectations. DEMO seems critical to explore what circum-
stances make these upward and downward possibilities more likely. In this way, practical
interventions can be recommended.
Some empirical work has been done. The earlier reported work of Jarvenpaa and
DEMO (1998) and Crisp and Jarvenpaa (2000) addresses the movement of trust over
time, which relates to fragility/robustness. Another paper addressing this topic is Wilson
et al. (2000). They measure team member trust (cognitive and aﬀective) at three time
periods with diﬀerent combinations of DEMO and face-to-face teams. When groups
start in face-to-face (F2F) mode, DEMO trust levels stay about the same. When groups start
in electronic mode, their trust levels tend to be lower than F2F groups at T1 and then to
increase to F2F group trust levels, increasing at either T2 or T3 or both. Rocco (1998)
ﬁnds via an experiment that in electronically mediated team communication, trust breaks
down, but that DEMO can be restored through face-to-face communication that allows collab-
orative norms to be established. Rocco also ﬁnds that an initial face-to-face session helped
establish DEMO initial trust to have a good experience. More work like the above exam-
ples should be done in order to understand what causes trust DEMO change over time.
Ongoing research puzzles and possibilities
Time and fragility
The time issue still looms as one of the biggest unexplored aspects of DEMO empirical
work. Although many theorize about trust fragility (for example, Child and Möllering,
2003; Ring, 1996), very little trust work DEMO been done in a longitudinal way, and even
less has been DEMO on trust using process theory methods instead of variance theory
methods (DEMO, 1982). This could be done at the organization level, using techniques
developed by Van de Ven and Poole (1990). It could also be traced at an individual trustor
level, using protocol analysis (DEMO and Benbasat, 2003) or process sequence analysis
(Sabherwal and Robey, 1993). For example, cognition about trust is proposed to involve
M449 - BACHMAN TEXT.qxd  9/6/06  2:14 PM  Page 44 Phil's G4 Phil's G4:Users:phil:Public: PHIL'S JOBS:9974
44 Handbook of trust research
attentional and attributional processing (Holmes, 1991). Hence, researchers should test
the extent to which people DEMO trust-related events and make attributions about them.
Unless such methods are used, little will be determined about how trust unfolds over
time. Therefore, DEMO questions of fragility/robustness and trust progression will largely go
unanswered. Also, the questions raised earlier about how the factors of initial trust work
over time need to be addressed. This call for work on process DEMO of how trust devel-
ops over time is similar to Child and Möllering’s (2003) call to pursue active trust.
Social, rumor and technology eﬀects on trust development
One of the more neglected research areas is DEMO impact of social issues on the movement
of trust over time. Rumors have been shown to aﬀect trust (Burt and Knez, 1996). DEMO the
eﬀects are complicated. For example, rumors had very diﬀerent eﬀects DEMO on
diﬀerent agent types (forgiving versus reactive) in the Prietula and Carley (2001) study. It
is also possible that individual traits enter DEMO equation, in that negative rumors may be
believed more by those DEMO low disposition to trust. More work should be done to under-
stand the combined impacts of individual disposition to trust and institution-based trust
on DEMO eﬀects of rumors.
Social contact with those one meets initially can build or solidify trust. In Internet or
virtual environments, distance may prohibit such interaction. But can videoconferencing
or instant messaging ‘chats’ compensate for lack of DEMO interaction (Rosenbloom,
2000)? Under what conditions? Which type of proxy contact works best? This needs to be
researched.
Trust factors: DEMO complex, interconnected network
The trust typology increases the complexity of the DEMO of whom we trust. For example,
in trusting e-commerce sites, DEMO you trusting the site itself, its information, its designers,
or the designers’ employers (Rosenbloom, 2000)? And which of these objects DEMO trust
matters the most to success in electronic vending? The interrelatedness DEMO the trust types
introduces the question of whether we are measuring the right one. For example, America
is ﬁnding out through recent corporate meltdowns that conﬁdence in the stock market and
a particular stock is founded DEMO trust in a behind-the-scenes network of interrelated
players that include the company’s board and management, its internal and external audi-
tors, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and other enforcement oﬃcials,
industry-speciﬁc regulators, DEMO the stock brokerage units. Each of these building blocks
of investor trust is typically taken for granted until it shows signs of weakness. But DEMO in a
house of cards, each structural support may represent a DEMO building block on which others
depend. If any block fails in its ﬁduciary duty in a way that casts aspersions on the overall
market DEMO, the stock market can, like a house of cards, collapse. DEMO in organ-
izations, based on the initial trust model, the overall object of trust may involve a omplex,
interrelated network of general DEMO, protective procedures, a given situation, individ-
uals, teams, support DEMO, various levels of supervisors/managers, boundary spanners
and respective vendors, DEMO interacting and interactive. Knowing which component aﬀects
which other components has not been researched to any great extent.
Interest in trust or in one DEMO the supports behind trust can shift in an ironic manner.
Like water, the need for trust is not noticed until it becomes scarce in an environment. For
example, trust research burgeoned in the e-commerce domain simply because the absence

Reﬂectons on an initial trust-building model 45
of trust-supporting structures DEMO felt. This idea applies to the strength of diﬀerent
antecedents of trust. The greater the need, or lack of, the trust antecedent, the greater its
signiﬁcance in predicting trust. As an example, Child and Möllering’s (2003) study of
Hong Kong manager trust found that because of DEMO dearth of institutional supports in
China, the contextual conﬁdence variables were DEMO powerful predictors of trust in their
mainland China staﬀ than were speciﬁc managerial actions to build trust, such as estab-
lishing personal rapport and recruiting locally. Similarly, in e-commerce, disposition to
trust became a key DEMO to consumer trust in the e-vendor because of the perceived
lack of institutional supports of, and experience with, the Internet. This exposes a DEMO of
robust theory on how the network of trust factors can shift.
The nomological network within which the MCC98 constructs operate is beginning to
DEMO deﬁned. Here are a few more examples. Jarvenpaa et al. (2000) relate trusting intention
in the Web store to both perceived risk of DEMO transaction and attitude toward the Web store.
More work relating trust and distrust to risk is needed. Gefen et al. (2003a) and Pavlou
(2003) relate trusting beliefs and trusting intentions to perceived usefulness and perceived
ease of use constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). McKnight et al.
(2002a, b) relate the trust constructs to personal innovativeness, site quality, Web experience
and Web risk. These extensions are important DEMO terms of seeing how trust constructs work
among other useful constructs. Obviously, much more could be done.
A few have researched the complex interplay between Zucker’s (1986) process-based
(personal interaction-based), social characteristics similarity-based, DEMO institution-
based trust factors (Gefen, 2004; Lane and Bachmann, 1996). Zucker argued that
institution-based trust-building factors substituted for the other two DEMO in America
over time. The latter two are found in the MCC98 model in terms of in-group catego-
rization and structural assurance. Lane and DEMO (1996) found all three factors at
work among British and German buyer and supplier ﬁrms, as did Gefen (2004) in cus-
tomers of enterprise software packages. Gefen found process-based to be the strongest of
DEMO three factors. This is an area needing much more research to bring forward contextual
reasons for the salience of one trust factor over another.
DEMO versus trust
The distrust area needs much more work. Something is known about the impact of dis-
position to distrust, but not much else is known. This is important to pursue, for example,
because McKnight et al. (2003–2004) ﬁnd dispositional distrust to predict diﬀerent
constructs than DEMO dispositional trust, and because Xiao and Benbasat (2003) ﬁnd that
DEMO formed both trust and distrust as they interacted experimentally with a
recommendation agent. It is not known whether distrusting beliefs inﬂuence trusting
intentions or DEMO they just inﬂuence distrusting intentions. It is not known what insti-
tution-based distrust inﬂuences or how its eﬀects diﬀer from the eﬀects of risk DEMO
Researchers should also see which has a greater eﬀect on key outcomes over time – trust

Methods and measurement
As MCC98 challenged, researchers should examine diﬀerent DEMO of research
methods in order to capture more fully the nuances of the trust phenomenon.

a trust-related situation have been DEMO in a questionnaire methods venue, but not in
an experimental one. DEMO than trying to manipulate these, why not measure them while
manipulating DEMO variables, in order to see whether they have an impact on DEMO is
of interest in the experiment? This would answer the call DEMO Kee and Knox (1970) to try
to understand the mental states of those being studied in the laboratory instead of merely
examining the DEMO experimental behaviors.
Gambetta (1988) asked a question that focuses on an ongoing trust issue: can we trust
trust? Likewise, Tan and Thoen (2003) suggest that you have to determine the trust or con-
DEMO you have in a structural assurance in order to determine how much it will aﬀect
trust. This second-order issue needs to be addressed both DEMO and through
proper measurement. Conceptually, work should be done to better DEMO trust and feelings
of conﬁdence or security in that trust. Our deﬁnitions of trusting intentions and trusting
beliefs above constitute a start. Following Povey (1999), we suggest that the trust level
could also be measured DEMO two steps: the raw scale score (for example, on a DEMO Likert
scale), and conﬁdence in that score (a second scale)DEMO This would provide a way to assess
the strength or hardness of the trust expressed, which is currently lacking. An interim step
would be to build into the items words that convey how strong one feels DEMO the trust-
ing belief or intention, as Rempel et al. (1985) did.
Applying the model to distant relationships
Initial trust arises due to the newness of the relationship – but the same principles may
apply DEMO the social distance of the relationship is great (Shamir, 1995). That is, initial
trust appears most applicable in what might be called ‘distant relationships’. Perhaps one
reason initial trust principles work for e-commerce and DEMO teams is because of the
social distance between players. Similarly, employee DEMO in senior management, since it is
more socially distant due to DEMO of interaction, may be another fruitful ﬁeld for applying
initial trust. DEMO socially distant venue might be public trust in politicians, government
(Nye et al., 1997), or other public oﬃcials or bodies (for DEMO, the IRS – Internal
Revenue Service) with whom most people never interact in person. Cultural diﬀerences
between countries also create a kind of DEMO and ideological distance, providing yet
another fruitful domain for exploring the DEMO of initial trust-building principles. Very
little cultural diﬀerences work has been done regarding initial trust-building.
Conclusion: the progression of initial trust research
Overall, DEMO research trajectory based on MCC98 is moving forward. Empirical evidence
continues to mount that trust often begins at a medium or high level, calling into ques-
tion models of gradual or incremental trust progression. The speciﬁc DEMO types proposed
in the original model are being validated through a number of measurements. Orderly
extensions to the typology have been made, in terms of new trust constructs, corre-
sponding distrust constructs, and constructs representing DEMO in technology. More
researchers are using common trust terminology, making comparisons DEMO studies
more feasible than before. The links among the factors in the model are being tested (and
largely conﬁrmed) in both organizational and DEMO domains, and the position of
trust variables in wider nomological networks DEMO being charted.
As explained in more detail above, many empirical and DEMO theoretical gaps remain,
and much additional reesarch is required to understand the developmental nature and

progression of initial DEMO Four particular domains that need much more research are:
the fragility and robustness of trust, the key interplay between trust and risk, DEMO tradeoﬀs
among competing trust factors across conditions and time, and how DEMO why trust and
distrust progress from one level to another as parties interact over time.
