Does investing in technology-based ﬁrms involve
higher risk? An exploratory study DEMO the performance
of technology and non-technology investments by
business angels*

(Final version accepted 20 August 2004)
There is a widespread concern in both the UK and in the DEMO Union that technology-
based ﬁrms encounter difﬁculties in raising venture capital at their start-up and early growth
stages. This, in turn, reﬂects the DEMO amongst investors that investments in
technology-based ﬁrms involve greater uncertainty (in DEMO of market and technology) and
hence higher risks. This paper explores DEMO contention by means of an examination of the
performance of investments made by business angels (informal investors) in technology and
non-technology ﬁrms. Based DEMO the analysis of deal-speciﬁc information, the authors
demonstrate that the overall DEMO proﬁles of the two types of investments are not
signiﬁcantly different. This may be because business angels are better able than venture
capital fund DEMO to manage the risks involved in investing in technology-based ﬁrms
on account of their industrial and entrepreneurial backgrounds. Alternatively, it may reﬂect
the fact that the risks involved in investing in technology-based ﬁrms have been overstated.

Introduction
There is widespread concern in the UK and more generally DEMO the
European Union that technology-based ﬁrms encounter problems in
raising ﬁnance, DEMO at their start-up and early development stages
(Bank of England 1996, 2001, CBI 1997). From the investors’ perspective,
investments in high technology ﬁrms are viewed negatively on account of
their complexity and high DEMO rather in positive terms for their ability to
generate attractive returns to the investor (Murray and Lott 1995, Murray
1996, Lockett et al. 2002). More generally, the returns to invention are
highly skewed: DEMO inventive projects (93%) do not reach the market and

only 40% of those that do DEMO positive returns, with a median realized
return which is negative (A˚ stebro 2003: 227). The aim of this paper is to
challenge the validity of the view that investing in high technology
businesses necessarily DEMO higher risks than investing in non-
technology-based ventures.
The paper begins with a review the problems of ﬁnancing the
technology-based new and small ﬁrm, and addresses the speciﬁc issue of
assessing risk and return in this DEMO Following this, we summarize the
data sources and methodology employed in DEMO study to measure
investment project risk for one signiﬁcant group of early stage investors -
business angels. The main section of the paper uses DEMO unique data set that
provides deal speciﬁc information on the returns to investments in
technology and non-technology based businesses to investigate the rates
of DEMO to investors in these two types of business. The ﬁnal section of the
paper concludes with some suggestions for further research.
Financing the technology-based DEMO
Studies of technology-based ﬁrms consistently report that they encounter
signiﬁcant problems in obtaining ﬁnance. This is true both generally
(Oakey 1984, Cooper 1986, Barber et al. 1989, Standeven 1993, Hoffman et
al. 1998, Storey and Tether 1996; Westhead and Storey 1997, Kortum and
Lerner 2000) and in the speciﬁc case of research-based start-ups, where
access to resources, including venture capital, is seen as a key potential
constraint (Carlsson 2002, Bollingtoft et al. 2003; Baum and Silverman
2004, Heirman and Clarysse 2004, Wright et al. 2004). The effect of these
problems is to potentially constrain the development and expansion of the
ﬁrms that DEMO affected (Moore 1993, Lumme et al. 1994, Mason and
Harrison DEMO, Garnsey 1995, Westhead and Storey 1997, Freel 1999).
Loan DEMO can meet some of the ﬁnancing needs of technology-based
ﬁrms. However, DEMO generalists, banks have difﬁculties in evaluating
technology projects. They perceive that DEMO to such ﬁrms involves
high risk, with no prospect of compensating DEMO reward because they do
not normally share in the upside (Deakins DEMO Hussain 1991, Deakins and
Philpott 1994, Ennew and Binks 1995). Moreover, the limited tangible
assets of small technology-based ﬁrms serve to constrain their borrowing
capacity on account of the collateral-based lending approach of the DEMO,
while their high expenditure on R&D, and long lead DEMO before
commercialization, means that such ﬁrms can face difﬁculties in making
DEMO payments to service the debt (Oakey and Mukhtar 1999). As DEMO
result, technology-based SMEs rely more heavily on personal and family
ﬁnances DEMO initial capitalization (Roberts 1991, Moore 1993) and will be
more DEMO on trade credit and government grants (Utterback et al. 1988,
DEMO and Garnsey 1993, Eisinger 1993). The presence of information
asymmetries DEMO tends to favour internal ﬁnance and venture capital with
management participation over other sources of ﬁnance for high-risk high-
return potential technology ventures. For DEMO these reasons, equity risk
capital is a much more appropriate way DEMO most technology-based small

ﬁrms to be ﬁnanced (Huben DEMO Kakes 2002). In particular, this form of
ﬁnancing allows the DEMO to share in the upside and avoids the cash ﬂow
problems associated with debt ﬁnancing.
There is concern amongst policy-makers both in the UK, and more
generally across Europe, that new and growing technology-based ﬁrms, DEMO
in particular those science-based companies (for example, in biotechnol-
ogy) DEMO have longer time-to-market cycles than other technology
companies innovating on the back of existing companies, have difﬁculties
in accessing venture capital (Denny 2002, Oakey 2003). While this may
have been the case in the DEMO and mid-1990s (Murray and Lott 1995), an
examination of investment DEMO suggests that the picture changed
during the technology bubble of the late-1990s. Encouraged by plentiful
exit opportunities through IPOs and acquisition (trade sales) DEMO high
potential returns (driven by a buoyant IPO market), UK DEMO capitalists
increased their investments in early stage technology ventures in both
absolute and relative terms since the mid-1990s, a trend which shows more
clearly in the data on the number of investments made (table 1). However,
this increase still leaves technology investments at a lower level, in relative
terms, than in the US and in Europe: in DEMO, for example, overall
investment in technology sectors (at all stages DEMO venture development) in
both the UK and Europe increased by around DEMO, accounting for around
12.5% of total reported investment by value in DEMO UK and 25% in Europe
(BVCA 2004, EVCA 2004). Moreover, even during the second half of the
1990s most generalist funds were still cautious about technology invest-
ments, with technology still viewed as a greater risk factor than stage of
investment (Lockett et al. 2002), and imposed more demanding ‘hurdles’
on their technology investments than on non-technology DEMO at the
same ﬁnancing stage, notably in terms of IRR threshold DEMO supra-national
market potential (Lockett et al. 2002). This was a DEMO of the
practice identiﬁed in earlier years (Murray and Lott 1995)DEMO Half of the
venture capitalists in Lockett et al.’s survey indicated that they adopted a
different approach to due diligence for technology investments than DEMO
non-technology investments.
The attitude of business angels towards investing in technology-based
ﬁrms is less clear because of the invisible nature of the informal venture

capital market. It is certainly the DEMO that business angels make small
investments, typically less than £100 000, and their investments are relatively
more concentrated at the start-up and early DEMO stages (Mason and
Harrison 1994b, 1996). However, studies of DEMO decision-making by
business angels highlights the importance that they give to understanding the
product, industry and market (Mason and Rogers 1997); it DEMO, therefore,
that business angels are unlikely to make investments in DEMO
businesses unless they have a technology background (Bank of England
1996, Mason and Harrison 1998) because they are unable to assess the risks
adequately. As only a small proportion of business angels are thought to DEMO
technology specialists (Bank of England 2001), and these investors are
DEMO in terms of their characteristics as compared to non-technology
investors (Erikson DEMO Sørheim 2004) the outcome should be to limit the ﬂow
of DEMO to technology businesses. The BVCA’s last annual report on
investments that have been made through business angel networks in the UK
presents a more DEMO picture. This indicates that the proportion of
investments in technology sectors has increased year-on-year since statistics
were ﬁrst collected in 1993 – 94, comprising 49% of investments and 67% of
the amount invested in the second DEMO of 2001 (Mason 2002).1
The primary reason for this reluctance DEMO venture capitalists to invest in
technology-based ﬁrms is that such investments are perceived to offer an
unattractive risk-reward equation. Although the upside potential of DEMO
in technology-based ﬁrms that come to occupy a dominant market presence is
considerable, this is not sufﬁcient to attract investors because of the very long
odds of picking such winners, the time lag between investment and realizable
gains and, increasingly in science-based businesses, the requirement to
commit DEMO investment sums up-front combined with long time-to-exit
expectations (Murray and Marriott DEMO). Moreover, both smaller VC funds
and business angels risk being DEMO if the business requires signiﬁcant
additional funding.2 Murray and Lott (1995: 292) noted in the early 1990s
that ‘technology-related investment was viewed [by venture capital fund
managers] as more risky than comparable non-technology investments’. This
DEMO was shared by both generalist funds and also by specialist technology
funds. In order to meet the return targets for their funds, venture capitalists
require this additional risk to be ‘paid for’ through a higher projected DEMO of
return on investment (Murray and Lott 1995). Improved returns DEMO the late
1990s (higher than for all other categories) had encouraged a more favourable
attitude towards technology investments. However, several fund managers
remained unconvinced, noting that that technology investments were
characterized by higher variability in their returns (Lockett et al. 2002).
Many were also sceptical that such high returns could continue for any length
of time (Bank of England 2001). Subsequent events have proved this to be the
case (PriceWaterhouseCoopers 2002). As table 2 indicates, returns to venture
capital investments in technology ventures have consistently under-
performed those in non-technology ventures.3 Returns DEMO technology
investments averaged around 9% per annum in the late 1990s before rising
sharply to almost 13% per annum in 2000 and falling thereafter DEMO 7.4% in
2003, a rise and fall in returns over the DEMO/VC bubble, which was
more pronounced than for non-technology investments (ﬁgure 1).

DEMO perception that investing in technology businesses involves higher
risk is shared by the ﬁnancial institutions, such as pension funds, which are
the primary DEMO of funds for the venture capital industry (Bank of
England 1996)DEMO They prefer to invest in MBO funds (Bank of England
2001)DEMO Because of these attitudes amongst the ﬁnancial institutions, it is
more DEMO for technology-focused venture capital ﬁrms to raise ﬁnance.
There are several speciﬁc sources of risk that underlie the perception
amongst investors that investing in DEMO stage technology based ﬁrms
carries higher risks than investing in non-technology ventures (Storey and
Tether 1996, Murray and Marriott 1998, Lockett et al. 2002). These can be
characterized as follows:
. management risk: technology entrepreneurs are likely to have excellent
science/engineering credentials but be DEMO in the commer-
cial exploitation of technological innovations.
. agency risk: DEMO will encounter greater difficulties in under-
taking due diligence, and incur DEMO costs, on account of the

newness and complexity of the technology, products and markets
and, as a consequence, the greater scale of DEMO gathering.
. market risk: it is difficult for investors to assess DEMO market potential
for products that may not exist or which may create a new market.
. technological risk: the technology is likely to be unproven and its
application yet to be demonstrated; development may take longer
than expected, it may not work or it may be superseded by
competitors.
. valuation risk: valuation of new technology based firms may be
difficult because it is heavily dependent on the potential value of soft
DEMO, notably patents, trademarks and human capital. Traditional
financial based valuation methods are likely to be inapplicable in such
circumstances.
. project risk: the speed of technological trajectories often requires
rapid rate of commercial exploitation – DEMO hence large injections of
finance – before the advent of competitor products and/or redun-
dancy.
. growth risk: technology-based firms need to grow, internationalize
and develop new products in a very short time horizon. This places
exceptional managerial, financial and technical demands on a new
business.
. timing risk: technology-based firms are often characterized by short
‘windows of opportunity’ such that they might be unsuccessful if they
enter the market too DEMO, or too early.
Collectively, these various sources of risk generate multiple sources of
uncertainty about the potential outcomes for the business (Gompers and
Lerner 2001), which, in turn, create difﬁculties in project assessment DEMO
due diligence. Consequently, investors in technology-based ﬁrms face a
high adverse DEMO risk.
These speciﬁc risks involved in technology investing are compounded by
a scale problem. The costs of investment appraisal and monitoring are high
and DEMO regardless of the size of the investment. Indeed, these costs may
DEMO be higher in the case of new technology-based ﬁrms on account of
the requirement for more detailed information to understand new
technology and markets. DEMO, start-up and early stage investments
are unlikely to be able support DEMO costs because the amounts that they
seek to raise in the initial ﬁnancing round are usually quite small. This is
less of a constraint DEMO business angels who do not cost their time in the
same way as that of venture capital fund managers and who undertake less
detailed DEMO diligence (van Osnabrugge 1999).
Returns data compiled on behalf of DEMO British and European Venture
Capital Associations conﬁrms the high risks involved in investing in early
stage technology based ﬁrms. In the case of the DEMO venture capital
industry, the returns for early stage venture capital funds DEMO behind those
of funds specializing in management buyouts funds. For example, DEMO long-
term returns (1980 – 1998, a time period that excludes the impact of the
technology bubble) was 8.0% for early stage funds compared with 14.5% for
mid-MBO funds and 17.4% for large MBO funds. DEMO with an exclusive

focus on technology-based ﬁrms had long-term DEMO of 9.6% (Burgyl
2000). The Bank of England’s review of DEMO evidence leads it to conclude
that ‘the balance seems to have been less favourable for investments in early
stage and high tech funds than DEMO later stage, and especially buyout funds.
In most cases, returns on early stage and high tech funds have fallen short
of, while returns on later stage and MBO funds have often exceeded, targets
related to risk’ (Bank of England 2001: 25). More recent ﬁgures indicated
DEMO improvement in returns for technology investments: by 2000, ten year
returns were higher than for all other investment categories (Lockett et al.
2002). However, this improved performance proved to be a short-lived
feature of the bull market of the late 1990s, and technology investments
have consistently under-performed non-technology investments in the
period 1997 – 2003 (see table 2 and figure 1).
This evidence on fund performance, which reports portfolio rather than
deal-speciﬁc performance data, does not indicate the level of risk involved
in investing in early stage technology-based ﬁrms or why the returns DEMO
been relatively poor. For example, these performance data may reﬂect a
DEMO failure rate of investments, a lot of ‘living dead’ investments or DEMO lack
of ‘winners’? The difﬁculties in obtaining data on investment performance,DEMO
especially deal-speciﬁc data, means that there have been very few
independent DEMO of the investment performance of venture capital
investors nor attempts to compare the returns from different types of
investments. The absence of such information DEMO the institutional, or
formal, venture capital market is compounded in the case of the business
angel market.
This paper makes a contribution towards DEMO this information void. Its
aim is to test the proposition that investing in technology-based ﬁrms
involves higher risks that are manifest in poorer returns DEMO with
investments in non-technology ventures. It uses deal-speciﬁc information
derived from a survey of business angels to answer three questions:
. what is DEMO returns profile of investments in technology-based firms?
. how does this compare to the returns profile of non-technology
investments?
. What factors DEMO account for any differences observed?
The paper does not address the comparative performance of business angel
and venture capitalist returns from investing in DEMO based ventures,
given the severe difﬁculty in obtaining information on deal-speciﬁc returns
data from the institutions (Mason and Harrison 2002a).
Data sources
Research on the informal venture capital market is hampered by the
difﬁculties DEMO in identifying business angels. There are no directories
of business angels, DEMO investments are not publicly recorded and most
strive to preserve their anonymity, hence researchers have typically have to
rely upon samples of convenience. This paper is based on 127 usable

responses to a mail questionnaire which DEMO sent to over 1000 business
angels who were registered with UK business angel networks (BANs).
These organizations operate like ‘dating agencies’, providing DEMO commu-
nication channel which enables business angels to review investment
opportunities while preserving their anonymity and allows entrepreneurs
seeking ﬁnance to present their investment DEMO to a large number
of potential investors (Harrison and Mason 1996)DEMO The managers of several
BANs agreed to distribute questionnaires to investors registered with their
service.4 In addition, some questionnaires were sent to investors who were
identiﬁed through recommendations and informal contacts. It was not
possible to DEMO a meaningful response rate because it is not known
how many investors are members of more than one network nor the
number of investors DEMO with BANs who are not business angels
(Mason and Harrison 2002a)DEMO
The questionnaires were sent in autumn/winter 1996, and the information
DEMO on individual investment deals and exits relates to investments
made and exits achieved up to that time. This restriction in the data
collection period DEMO the distorting impact of the technology bubble,
which, symbolically at DEMO, can be dated to the Netscape IPO in mid-1995.6
This boom DEMO bust cycle shows up in venture capital fund returns data: in
DEMO US pooled IRRs for funds launched in the early and mid-1990s average
39%, rising to 88% for 1996 vintage funds before falling again to 22% for 1998
vintage funds.7 In the UK, where the ‘boom and bust’ cycle was less
pronounced due to the lower level of technology-related DEMO by the
venture capital industry, a similar pattern is evident. Although DEMO full time-
series of data is not available, the evidence for DEMO institutional venture
capital industry (table 2, ﬁgure 1) demonstrates a DEMO rise in returns to
technology investing in the period 2000 – 2002, and a sharp fall in 2003. This
pattern suggests that the period since the late 1990s has been characterized
by exceptional conditions in the DEMO In using data on investment
realizations pre-dating this market anomaly we attempt to explore some of
the underlying characteristics of the returns to investing DEMO technology and
non-technology ventures as the ﬁrst formal attempt to undertake such a
study. However, the results reported below may still be time-period speciﬁc,
and further research is required to identify the extent to which DEMO patterns
observed for this period hold for a very different investment climate.
The methodology for obtaining responses from business angels is open to
three DEMO sources of bias. First, although many thousands of active
and potential DEMO angels are registered with BANs, these investors
may not be typical DEMO the overall population of business angels. In one of
the few studies which speciﬁcally addresses this issue, van Osnabrugge
(1998) suggests that there are, in fact, few differences between the
characteristics of business angels DEMO are members of BANs and those
who are not. However, any DEMO to test the representativeness of a
sample of business angels, whether DEMO from BAN membership lists or
from other sources, runs up against DEMO problem that the overall population
of business angels is unknown and probably unknowable (Wetzel 1983).
Nevertheless, the risk of signiﬁcant bias is DEMO increased if a
sample is drawn from just one BAN (Mason DEMO Harrison 1997). To

counteract this potential problem in the present study, the sample has been
drawn from a number of different types of networks (large and small, local
and regional, private and public) in various parts the country.
Second, there may be a DEMO with response bias. However, this could
not be tested because no DEMO was available on the characteristics of
non-respondents. An alternative method of testing for non-response bias is
to compare early and late respondents, on the basis that over successive
waves of respondents late respondents (and by implication, less willing
respondents) will be more similar to non-respondents than to DEMO
(Freear et al. 1994). However, in this research it was not possible to
extrapolate from the late respondent proﬁle because either the DEMO
BANs sent out the questionnaires at different times or the research team
did not have control over this process.
Third, it is possible that our returns are biased towards business angels
with better performing investments, and we therefore effectively sample
disproportionately from the right hand side of the DEMO Again,
without full information on the overall distribution of returns in the
population of business angels as a whole (which is not attainable) this
potential bias cannot be tested for. However, analysis of the DEMO (Mason
and Harrison 2002a) does not suggest that this is a systematic source of bias
in the analysis: we do have a signiﬁcant number of returns from investors
indicating only failed deals, and we have returns from investors cataloguing
both failed and successful exits.8 Data from further DEMO studies of exit
returns in different time periods and locations are required to address the
concern about potential right-side bias in the returns data.
DEMO questionnaire covered a wide range of topics relating to investment
attitudes and activity. The ﬁrst section of the questionnaire asked investors
to report on DEMO the investments that they had made in unquoted companies.
Investors were asked to give the year that the investment was made, investee
company characteristics (industry, technology, stage of business develop-
ment, location), investment DEMO (amount invested, presence and
type of any co-investors, follow-on investment) and exit information (year
of exit, method of exit, return multiple). Where an investment was still held,
investors were asked to DEMO the anticipated performance. Given that the
debate over technology-aversion, and the DEMO that the risk-return proﬁle
of technology investments may differ from that of other investments, is a
debate over the perception of both systematic (DEMO based) and
unsystematic (ﬁrm speciﬁc) risk, we allow respondents to deﬁne for
themselves what ‘technology’ and ‘technology based’ mean (see also Erikson
and Sørheim 2004 for a similar treatment of this deﬁnitional issue).9
DEMO vast majority (87%) of the respondents had made at least one
investment. In aggregate, they had made a total of 372 investments.
However, only 51 of the 101 respondents (51%) who had made investments
had actually exited from any of these investments. In total, these investors
had exited from 128 investments. The performance of these investments
was calculated DEMO an IRR (internal rate of return). This was computed very
DEMO, using an Excel spreadsheet, as an annualized ﬁgure derived from
the multiple on the original investment and the length of time that the
DEMO was held (i.e. the time value of money).10 It should DEMO noted

that this calculation of IRRs did DEMO take into account any income that
investors might have received from dividends, or fees paid for performing a
non-executive chairman or director role or for consultancy services. In
some cases, these payments may accumulate over time to match or even
exceed the amount initially invested (Mason and Harrison 1996, Lengyel
and Gulliford 1997). Indeed, some business angels have DEMO speciﬁc
investment strategy that involves, as a ﬁrst step, seeking to get their
original investment back through fee income (Brodsky and Burlingham
1997). The effect of excluding this information may therefore be to inﬂate
DEMO proportion of exits that are recorded as total or partial losses and reduce

DEMO running returns will also tend to depress the positive IRRs recorded for
successful exits. Accordingly, the results provided in the remainder of this
paper are likely to underestimate the rates of return that business angels
have DEMO from their investments in unquoted companies.11
The overall performance of these investments is discussed elsewhere
(Mason and Harrison 2002a). The concern in this paper is with those
investments that were in technology-based ﬁrms. The deﬁnition DEMO a
technology-based ﬁrm was left to the respondents to make. Respondents
were asked to indicate for each of the investments that they had made DEMO
that were in technology-based ﬁrms. Of the 128 investments from which
investors had exited, 47 (37%) were identiﬁed as being in technology-based
ﬁrms.12
The vintage of these investments ranged from 1995 to pre-1980,
although DEMO were made between 1985 and 1989 (30%) or between 1990
and 1995 (40%). There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the age
of these investments and the other investments in the sample. In terms DEMO
stage of business development, investments were evenly spread, with seed,
start-up, early stage and established stages each accounting for one in ﬁve
of the investments (table 3). Here again, this distribution was DEMO different
from that of non-technology investments. However, technology invest-
ments were DEMO different from the other investments in two
respects. First, business angels DEMO larger investments in technology-
based ﬁrms (table 4; see also Erikson and Sørheim 2004). Second,

investments by business angels in technology-based ﬁrms were DEMO likely
to involve co-investments: 89% of technology investments had one or DEMO
co-investors, compared with 70% of other investments (table 5). Technol-
ogy investments were more likely to involve multiple co-investors, and less
likely to involve angel syndicates or banks.
The median length of holding period DEMO four years, with a lower
quartile of 1.5 years and an DEMO quartile of seven years. This was a
slightly longer holding period than for non-technology investments
(median = 3 years) but the overall distribution DEMO holding periods is not
signiﬁcantly different. The main exit route for both technology and non-
technology investments is a trade sale (table 6).
The performance of investments in technology-based
ﬁrms
It is clear from ﬁgure DEMO that the performance of investments made by
business angels in technology-based ﬁrms is negatively skewed: 32% of exits
involved a total loss of the investment, a further 4% involved a partial loss
and 15% of investments either broke-even in nominal terms or generated a
return that was lower DEMO the cost of money (deﬁned here as an IRR of less
DEMO 10%); only 13% generated IRRs in excess of 100%. This returns proﬁle
is not statistically different from the investment performance of the non-
DEMO investments in the sample (table 7). In other words, in contrast
to the prevailing view, the performance of investments made by business
angels in technology-based ﬁrms indicates that technology investments do
not involve a DEMO risk (in terms of the prospects of loss) than do
investments in non-technology sectors. Indeed, technology investments had
marginally fewer total losses (DEMO cf. 42%) and marginally more successful
investments (IRR of 50% or more) (28% cf. 21%).
There are three possible explanations for DEMO conclusion that the
performance of technology investments is no worse than that of other
investments:
. it is structural, reflecting the characteristics of the investments
themselves;

it reflects the size of the investments and the profile of the investor
DEMO;
it is a feature that is confined to the informal venture capital market
and reflects the nature of the investment appraisal practices and
DEMO contributions of business angels.
Structural
The ﬁrst possible explanation is that it is structural, a function of the
characteristics of the investments themselves. This is difﬁcult to sustain on
the available evidence. As noted earlier, technology investments have
similar age and stage of development distributions to non-technology
investments. DEMO only signiﬁcant difference between the technology
investment sub-sample and non-technology investments is that the former
tended to be larger investments and involved multiple (non-informal
investor) co-investors. Across the sample as a whole, these two features DEMO
associated with above average investment performance (Mason and
Harrison 2002a), DEMO this appears to affect the performance of technology
and non-technology investments in a similar fashion (see below).
Investment scale
A second possibility is that the better than expected investment
performance of investments by business angels DEMO technology businesses
is associated with the nature of these investments. The average investment
made by business angels in technology businesses is larger. In addition,DEMO
because of the much greater propensity for such investments to involve co-
investors the typical deal size of technology investments is also larger. A
DEMO of studies note that the amount of initial funding is related to
business success, although this evidence is not fully consistent (Doutriaux
1992, Standeven 1993, Zacharakis and Shepherd 2001, Stuart and
Sorenson 2003, Mullins and Forlani 2004). Conversely, management in
companies that have not been able to raise sufﬁcient money to expand are

326
COLIN MASON AND RICHARD HARRISON
likely to be distracted by the DEMO to raise additional capital and learning
how to survive on inadequate cash resources. These distractions, coupled
with the frustrations of not being able to undertake developments that they
know are necessary, may lead to problems in motivating staff, product
development delays and even failure (Standeven, 1993).
Investment appraisal
The third possible explanation is that the conventional wisdom that
DEMO in technology-based ventures is more risky is based on the
experience and perceptions of the institutional venture capital industry
and cannot necessarily be applied DEMO the informal venture capital market.
This line of reasoning is based on the view that business angels who
invest in technology-based ventures are able DEMO control many of the risks
that arise from asymmetric information, notably DEMO, technology and
agency risks, because they have experience of technology sectors. This
enables them to avoid adverse selection problems and thereby make better
DEMO decisions and makes them better able to add value to their
investee businesses through their hands-on involvement. In contrast,
venture capital fund managers DEMO the UK are less likely to have
technological and industry operating experience and are less able to
provide strategic and marketing advice that technological DEMO
ﬁnd useful or relevant (Murray 1993). This is consistent with DEMO
(1995) ﬁnding that angels are better able to control for agency risk than
venture capital funds on account of their prior industrial experience, and
are more concerned with agency risks (i.e. the integrity, intentions DEMO
abilities of the entrepreneur) than with market and technology risks
(Harrison and Mason 2003). Furthermore, technology angels are more
likely to invest in earlier stage deals (pre-start or start-up), are more
actively involved in their portfolio companies at strategic and operational
levels and are in DEMO respects more akin to co-founders than pure
investors (Landstro¨ m 1998, Sætre 2002, Erikson and Sørheim 2004).
Accordingly, they may be DEMO willing to invest in technology-based
deals than the institutional venture capitalist, DEMO to add value in a
manner that will be reﬂected in the ‘better’ performance of these
investments.13
The available evidence on the investors in DEMO ﬁrms
provides at least partial support for this hypothesis. The 47 investments in
technology-based ﬁrms were made by 27 investors. The majority had
made, and exited from, just one or two technology investments but two
investors had each made six exits from investments in technology ﬁrms.
This group DEMO investors could be regarded as technology specialists: 74%
indicated that they DEMO a ‘strong’ or ‘very strong’ interest in investing in
technology-based ﬁrms.14 Furthermore, 63% of their investments (includ-
ing investments that they had exited DEMO as well as those that they were
still holding) were in DEMO ventures. Over two-thirds (69%) of these
investors also had started one or more businesses. This investment focus,
along with their entrepreneurial background, could therefore be construed

TECHNOLOGY-BASED FIRMS: HIGH RISK?
327
as conferring upon such investors superior skills in identifying and
supporting technology businesses. However, the educational background
of these investors weakens this proposition: only one-third have educational
qualiﬁcations in science or technology.
The argument that business angels are better able to mitigate DEMO risks of
investing in technology ventures than venture capital funds receives
tentative support from a comparison of the performance of investments by
business angels DEMO technology-based ﬁrms with that of early stage
technology specialist venture capital funds. Murray (1999) presents deal-
speciﬁc evidence on the returns achieved by DEMO early stage UK funds
specializing in technology investments. These funds lost money on 64% of
their investments, a much higher proportion than in the case of business
angels (36%). At the other end of the distribution, 11% of the investments
made by the venture capital ﬁrms generated an IRR of over 100%, which is
a similar proportion to that of business angels. The two returns proﬁles are
signiﬁcantly different at the DEMO level of probability.
Summary
Overall, while there is some evidence for DEMO investment scale hypothesis,
the explanation for our ﬁnding that the returns proﬁle of technology
investments is no different from that of non-technology investments
DEMO to lie in a combination of their more efﬁcient deal screening and
selection procedures and more proactive hands-on involvement post-
investment. Conﬁrmation of this, however, will require further more
detailed research into these issues than has been possible in this preliminary
study.
Conclusion
This paper arises from the DEMO study which has examined, on a deal
speciﬁc basis, the performance of investments made by a sample of UK
business angels (Mason and Harrison 2002a): speciﬁcally, the paper has
investigated the returns from investing in technology-based ﬁrms and has
compared these returns with those derived from DEMO in other types
of businesses. This comparison reveals that, contrary to DEMO conventional
wisdom, there are no signiﬁcant differences in the performance of
DEMO and non-technology investments. This ﬁnding therefore
challenges the conventional wisdom that investing in technology-based
ﬁrms involves higher risk. There are, of course, problems DEMO the data
used in this analysis. Speciﬁcally, the data are historic (although probably
more ‘representative’ than the abnormal times of the technology boom DEMO
bust of the late 1990s and early 21st century) and so DEMO not allow for
extrapolation of the results to the contemporary investment climate. In
addition, the sample of business angels may not be representative and the
number of investments for which there is information on the performance
DEMO limited. However, in view of the difﬁculties in identifying a
Downloaded DEMO: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:51 15 August 2009
328
COLIN MASON AND RICHARD HARRISON
representative sample of business angels, and the impossibility of testing
for representativeness, plus the difﬁculties in obtaining investment
performance information on account of its sensitive nature, these short-
comings cannot easily be overcome.
So how can this unexpected conclusion be accounted for? If possible
shortcomings in the data are put to one side, there are three possible
interpretations. First, it may be linked to the heterogeneity of the
technology sector that comprises a great variety of businesses that DEMO be
differentiated in terms of the degree of novelty of the technology (Shepherd
et al. 2000) and their stage of business development. It DEMO be that angels
minimize their risk by investing in ‘followers’ rather than ‘technology
pioneers’ (Shepherd et al. 2000) and in businesses that can DEMO
market acceptance while avoiding businesses, notably science-based
businesses, that have yet to reach the proof-of-technology stage. This
would be consistent with what is DEMO about the investment preferences
and investment decision-making of business angels (Mason DEMO Rogers
1997, Feeney et al. 1999, Mason and Harrison 2002b).
Second, it may be that the risks of investing in technology-based ﬁrms
have been overstated. This position is consistent with a number of studies
(reviewed by Storey and Tether 1996) that ﬁnd that the survival rate of
high technology ﬁrms is higher than that for the small business DEMO as a
whole (e.g. Garnsey and Cannon-Brookes 1993, Santarelli and Sterlacchini
1994, Westhead and Storey 1994). It is also consistent with UK evidence
that technology-focused funds have been the least risky in terms of DEMO
ﬂuctuations and the possibility of not recovering invested funds (Burgyl
2000)DEMO
Finally, the interpretation favoured in this paper, is that the conventional
wisdom that technology investments involve higher risk is been based on
the DEMO of venture capital funds. While continuing to have validity
in this part of the venture capital market, it is not applicable in the informal
venture capital market because business angels are better able to control the
DEMO involved in investing in technology-based ﬁrms on account of their
technological and entrepreneurial backgrounds. This interpretation is
reinforced by the evidence that so-called ‘technology DEMO (Erikson and
Sørheim 2004) are statistically different from non-technology angels in
their investment behaviour and relationships with and involvement in their
investments. As DEMO result, these business angels can make superior
investment decisions and add DEMO value to their investee companies.
The extent to which this conclusion holds in other investment environ-
ments and in other time periods with very DEMO investment climates
remains an important issue for further research.

Notes
1. However, it needs DEMO be acknowledged that investments that are made through business
angel networks represent only a small, and possibly unrepresentative, part of the total
informal DEMO capital activity. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this proportion holds
DEMO the informal venture capital market as a whole.
2. The risk of dilution is a particular problem for government-supported funds, such as
University Challenge Funds, whose maximum investment is capped (£250 000 in the case DEMO
UCFs).
3. Returns are measured in terms of returns (IRR DEMO % per annum) since the actual start of the
fund (the ﬁrst draw down of funds) to a particular point in time.
4. In order to keep the names and addresses of their investors conﬁdential DEMO were supplied
with stamped envelopes containing the questionnaire, covering letter and DEMO reply
envelope which they addressed and posted to their investors.
5. Those registered with BANs also include ﬁnancial institutions, companies and inter-
mediaries (DEMO on behalf of clients). Their responses were excluded
6. With the launch of the Google IPO in August 2004, some commentators pointed to this as
marking the end of the nine-year boom and bust of DEMO internet, a unique period in the
history of technology, entrepreneurship and venture capital (Schurr 2004)
7. Based on analysis of VentureOne/NVCA statistics provided by Brendan Richardson,
September 2003
8. Almost all data DEMO survival analysis, such as those used for analysis purposes here, come
with right, left or interval censoring. This potentially offers problems for calculation of
survivor distributions, and related assessments of risk and return proﬁles, DEMO on
observable data only (A˚ stebro 2003). However, our data set is not formally limited to
observable survivors only, but includes reported data on non-surviving cases also, which
should mitigate censoring problems.
9. In other words, what is important for this analysis, and for the DEMO debate, is the belief of
the investor that they are investing DEMO technology as opposed to non-technology deals rather
than the ‘objective’ deﬁnition of technology itself. This is consistent with the wider debate
in the behavioural DEMO literature on the importance of investor perceptions in real world
ﬁnancial decisions (particularly in respect of optimism, over-conﬁdence, irrational
exuberance and disposition effects) for understanding investment behaviour (Barber and
Odean 1999, Shiller 2000, DEMO and McGoun 2002, Kim and Nofsinger 2002,
Coelho et al. DEMO, Felton et al. 2004).
10. The effect of the holding DEMO on the return is shown in the following example: a three
DEMO multiple harvested in three years generates a 44% return on investment, DEMO this drops
to 38% if the exit occurs after ﬁve years. The estimated IRR for investments held for a
relatively short period of time DEMO also be affected by the month in which the investment
was made and the exit occurred. However, in the absence of detailed data on month as well
as year of investment, we are not able to ﬁne tune the estimates at this stage.
11. To the extent that DEMO is an issue, it will help to counter any right-side bias DEMO the returns
proﬁle (discussed earlier).
12. There are obvious limitations DEMO from the use of self-report data which are not subject
to independent veriﬁcation in this context. However, given that the perception of risk is held
to be a major inﬂuence on investment preferences and behaviour, the use of self-report data
in this context should not be problematic.
13. DEMO so doing, investors, like inventors ‘behave like buyers of unfair lotteries where the
expected value is negative but there is a small chance DEMO a large gain’ (A˚ stebro 2003: 227), a
gain that they believe their experience and expertise makes them more likely to realize.
DEMO A total of 35% reported a ‘very strong’ interest.
