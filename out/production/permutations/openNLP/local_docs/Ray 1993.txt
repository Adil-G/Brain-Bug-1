Ever since the appearance of Professor David McClellantl's studies on achievement motivation,
a subfield of entrepreneurship research DEMO becn the search for the prototype entrepreneurial
personality or the ideal personality attributes of the cntl.cprcneur. The purpose of this article is
twofold: (DEMO) to examine how the search for a prototype entrcprcneur has been DEMO and
(2) to argue that the focus of entrepreneurship education and training prograrrimrs should bc
skill development, not behaviour modification. This is not to suggest that the personality and
behaviour of the entrepreneur are unimportant DEMO our ficlcl. The entrepreneur is a focal point of
our field and there is a need to continue to scck understantling of the diversity DEMO ent~.eprcneurial
behaviour and how that behaviour shapes the firm, and how DEMO is shaped by the larger cultural
environment.

Introduction
In order DEMO inderstand why some individuals become entrepreneurs and some
entrepreneurs are relatively more successful than others, there are three key elements
that must be addressed: the entrepreneur's personality or attributes, the entrepreneur's
background and DEMO, and the entrepreneur's skills including how they learn. The
interrelationship DEMO these three variables is expressed in Figure 1.

2. Critique of entrepreneurial attributes
McClelland's stucly reflected the 1950s. A rl~qjor thcr~lc ill the economic dcvelopnient
literature of that DEMO was that undcrdcvclopcd couritrics, 35 they \\'ere the11 callccl,
DEMO shapecl not only by extreme poverty and a scarc:ity in the k~ctors ol'p~.c~duction, but
also by a prevailing sense of fatalism. Since fatalislrl \vils pcrceivetl as a rncjor cause of
undcrdevclopmcnt, clevelopcd societies were c)b\:ionsly i~chieve~r-~cnt oriented ancl the
antidote to fatalism was thc DEMO ol' a need to achie\,e.
Is there really any evidence DEMO suggest tl~at either scrccnirrg c;~rlditlntcs Ijascd 011
personality attributes or emphasizing bchaviorrr modification is I-cli~ted Illore or t~cttcr
entrepreneurial developmcnt? I would suggcst the opposite hypothesis. The morc that
communities and countries rely on personality ;~ttributcs scr-et:ning eentrcprcncurs iincl
the morc that cntreprencurial training is basetl DEMO bchaviour ~~~oclification: the less
entrepreneurial and the rnore impovel-ishecl a community DEMO likcly to be. b:\.cn granting
that a rcliance on personality attributes and betlaviour n~oclification has bccn p~.irrrarily
employed in the poorest areas of DEMO worlcl, the question rcrnains: ivhy thcrc and not in
the rich countries and cornmunities? Why are such rncthocls unncct:ssilry in the centres ol'
high prosperity or in technological ccntrcs likc Silicon \J;llley DEMO Koutc 128 in tl~c USA?
Over the years, Narziger has DEMO been thc rnost articulate critic ol' the
achievement motivation literature (1975, 1977, 1978, 1984, 1986. 1988). Nafzigcr fi~lds
that the DEMO paradigm, with its [,I-crr~ise tliat 'n Ach' can hc DEMO;lngccl, suggests
that the individual bears responsibility for uncrnplo).rrlcnt or DEMO their lack of
entrepreneurial activity:
I he altcrnativc approach implies that the fault ir~a). lic. ill part, with rht: ilnpcclii~icllts rl1;DEMO
society arid its dominant classes place in the road ro \tp\vard mot,ilit); io Itigll-lc\.cl ,jol,s and
I~usincss activity. A key issuc is the cslc,nr IO which rhc cc~~nornicall~~ ;trc i.c:\l~t~rlsiI~lc

which their class mobility is irnpcdcd by the c:ui~~ul;tti\~t: ;~d\.rlntngcs ol the l)~.cvi~iling
economic elite. (1988, DEMO 133).
Shina (1968) argued that, in a society likc DEMO with substantial lirnitarit)ns on resources,
a high nccd for co-operation will produce morc than those wit11 a high n Arh. Mo~.covcr,

also for business ventur-es, n Ach, a mcasurc (DEMO' incli\.iclual achie\,crncnt rnntivation,. docs
not explain entreprcneurial bchaviour (Javillonar- ant1 IJctcrs 1973).
Outside the ficld of entrepreneurship, other bodies ol'litcratur.e such as lcadcrship and
managernent studies have been prone to focus DEMO the developrncnt of 'ideal types' basecl
on personality attributes in the early phase of their development. The ficld of'
entrepreneurship has been DEMO ciiffcrcnt. Kcliccting thc ri~pid development of the field, the
literature on DEMO personality attributes of entrepreneurs has ;dso bc:cn severely criticizecl
in DEMO wide variety of sources (Chell 1985, Chell ;~nrl l%urro\vs 1991, C;;~rtncr 1989,
Ginsberg ancl Buchholtz 1989, Sexton 1987, Wortman 1386).
l'hc criticisms of the personillity attribute approach have rcnclccl DEMO focus on thrcc
issues: (1) the lack of clcfinition and DEMO:ak conccpt Sol-rnation processes; (2) a reliance on a
univariate DEMO opposed to a multivariate approach; ancl (3) the very concept DEMO'a 'trait' and
trait-based psychology. The lack of an agreed definition of the object ol' stucly - the
entrepreneur - has contributecl to contr;~dictor); empirical finclings (CHI.S~LI~ ~f (11. 1986,
Gartner DEMO, also Chell ct al. 1991). Sornc studics locus on the DEMO \\,hilt others

entrepreneurs and sr~~all business founders. No study has tricd to rclatc DEMO traits

developing computer software might have some shared bchavioural DEMO tha~ distinguish
them from, let us say, shop-owners.
Another deficiency is that most researchers havc locused on a singlc trait as bcing
definitive DEMO giving insufficient attention to sets of attributes (Chell and Haworth
1992)DEMO Ray (1986), in a study of risk taking, discovered that self-esteem was closely
associated with and might have driven risk-taking propcnsity. Those DEMO very low self-
esteem either take no risks or very high risks; each action reinforces their initial premise
that they are unworthy individuals. Those with a hcalthy level of self-cstcen~ are able to
take risks appropriate DEMO various situations that arise.
The attributes or traits approach to entrcpreneurship makcs a number of assumptions
which are open to challenge. By relying on DEMO single list of attributes, it assulncs that the
attributes which lead DEMO the decision to launch a new venture are also synonymous with
the attributes that cause new ventures to be successful. The opposite may, in fact, be the
case. A high internal locus of control, for DEMO, may lead individuals to be clissatistied
as employees, subject to the authority of others, but thc same pcrsonality attribute may
actually reduce the likelihood that the new venture will succecd. A h~gh internal locus of
DEMO may prevent the entrepreneur from building an effectivc team or de1,egating any
real authority to the team. Virtually every personality trait an individual DEMO:;csscs can be
both positive or negative in relation to somc DEMO of entreprcncurship and incw venturc
development.
There is also an assumption that the opposite of a specified attribute commonly
associated with the decision to DEMO a new venture - risk taking - will prcvcnt or inhibit
an individual from becoming an entrepreneur although there is no empirical evidence to
DEMO this assumption. The decision to becomc an entrepreneur is complex and the
absence of one or more variables, such as risk taking, may DEMO may not be sufficient to
deter one from becoming an entrepreneur. In rcality, the decision to become an
entrcpreneur is probably a complex interaction between attributcs and the situation faced
by the individual.
Further, the conceptual and empirical foundations of some of the mosl: conimonly
identified pcrsonality traits are subject to severe criticism. Ray (1986) studied the role of
DEMO in distinguishing between practising entrepreneurs and managers, cnyinccrs ancl
marketing personnel DEMO for multinational enterprise in Singallore. While
interesting differences were empirically identified, DEMO research revealed that every
conceptual and empirical aspect of the research was based on f;~ulty tools and dubious
empirical findings by earlier researchcrs. DEMO examplc, the widely used choice clilcmrnas
cluestionnairc was validated only arnong DEMO middle-class college students attending
two private colleges in the North-east of the USA. One researcher found thiit ovcr 30%
of a sample did not DEMO understand the questions in the choice dilemmas instrurncnt.
The most cited study in the field on risk taking using this instrument was based on DEMO
sample of only 40 applicants for business licences in St Louis, DEMO (IJSA) in the
autumn of 1978. That study generalizes from a marginal, non-entrepreneurial sample in
universal terms and has been interpreted as if it wcre spcaking about a universal
entrepreneurial phenomenon. In short; there is no en~pirical or conceptual base to say
much, if anything, about DEMO and risk taking.
Ncvcrtheless, one can find in numerous textbooks and DEMO training
manuals reference to entrepreneurs as 'moderate risk takers'. Aside DEMO thc flimsy
cmpirical and conceptual foundation for such an observation, what DEMO>rcciscly docs bcing a
'moderate risk taker' mean? Are we DEMO interprct such a statement as saying that for the
average entrepreneur all decisions taken havc an aueraEe propcnsity to involve mocleratc
risks? Or does it mean that the average entrepreneur only takes mocleratc ri:jks implying

that, in low-risk situations, the entrepreneur will DEMO ]'or thc riskier option ancl, in high-
risk situations, will opt for the less risky option? Such statements reflect the confi~sion
scholars who equate measures of central tendency with the actual dynamics of
entrepreneurial DEMO The phrase 'moderate risk' may be largely a creation of
academic invention unrelated to how entrepreneurs actually think about risk or cope with
DEMO in their management decisions. The problem may originate in assuming that the role
of risk in entrepreneurship is largely a matter of personality instcad DEMO function of
situations, information, strategy and decisions.
Assuming that personality is subject to manipulation in a short training course, a
dubious assumption at best, what happens if the training programme is o\~crly ellicient
and stimulates too much risk taking? Will the graduates fail because an over-zealous
trainer pushed them over the edge of 'moderate' risk taking anti into DEMO 'high' risk-
taking category? Or will they take a fateful 'r-nodcrate' risk when they shoulcl have
assumed no risk? Or will DEMO fail evcx to become an entrepreneur because thcy are
unable to take the risk of leaving a secure, well-paying, high-prestige job despite scoring
DEMO a 'moderate risk taker' on some psychological test? Risk in DEMO is better
understood as a contextual and strategy variable, not a DEMO variable.
Low et al. (1988, p. 148) conclude in a DEMO rcvie\v of the litcrature on
entrepreneurship by observing that:
Definitional and niethodological problems associated with thcse past psy~:IioIo~ical stuclics,
such as DEMO samples, bias to\v;ird successi'ul cntrcprenrurs, and rhc possibility
that observed entrepreneurial traits are the producl of entrepreneuriid experience, rrialic it
ditficult to interpret the results. Furthermore, at ;I rrlore hnclarncnt;ll Icvcl, it can be ar~ucd
that the wide variations among entrepreneurs made any ;tttclrlpt to develop a stancl;ird
psychological profile futile. One is struck DEMO the appropri;itcness of' C;artncrls (1985)
observation that there is as llluch diKerence arrlong entrepreneurs as bctwccn cnrreprencurs
and non-entrepreneurs.
The DEMO literature has focused on a ft:w personality attributes but has ignored some
of the more obvious and possibly tlecisivc attributes in explaining cntrepreneurial DEMO
such as physical appearance and likeability. Any reaclcr of the populilr business literature
on entrepreneurship should bc curious about tht: high pcrccntage of successful
entrepreneurs who, when profiled, are accompanied b). pictures of highly DEMO and
attractive individuals. Physically attractive people probably find it easier to meet pcople
(networking), raise money (resources) and sell their product or service (customers). By
the same token, individuals who are very DEMO and likeable probably find the road
to entrepreneurial success to be easier. If you were a supplier, \voulcl you extend credit to
someone without a track record or proper financial credit who you would Just as DEMO
never see again? The same applies for investors, lenders ancl early customers. Physical
appearance and likeability have probably not been clealt with in DEMO litcratul-e because
there they do not lend then~selves mailed surveys and they arc 11ot sufficiently erudite.
Whole bodies of reputable scholarship have bccn ignored DEMO students of
entrepreneurial personality. Basctj on the metaphorical c.listinction that managers might
be likened to those on an organized bus tour while cntrcprencurs might DEMO likcncd to
travellers with a backpack, the author encouragccl one of DEMO honclurs undergraduates
(van Hollen 1991) to examine the psyc:hological literaturc on toul-ism. Hc founcl some
interesting models that may have relevance to DEMO For csan~ple, activation
theory in tourism research might explain thc clitfc~.ence DEMO growth- ancl non-
growth-oriented entreprencurs more effec:tively than n Ach.

destinations, unstructured rather than packaged tours, and DEMO involvement with local
cultures. Psychocentrics. . . prefer familiar destinations, packagccl DEMO, ar~cl 'touristy'
areas. . . . The energy dimension. . . describes the desired level of activity prel'crrcci by the
tourist; high-energy travellers prefer high lcvcls of activity while low-cncrxy travellers
prefer fewer DEMO (Nickerson and Ellis 1991, p. 26)
Activation theory states that individuals differ with regard to their seel..ing out or
avoiding activity. Both DEMO and low-level activation people can be furthcr c:lassified by
their needs for meaningfulness, variety and internality (Nickerson and Ellis 1991). It DEMO
plausible that entrepreneurs are distinguished from non-entrepreneurs by their high
activation needs and that growth-oriented entrepreneurs arc distin~guishcd from small
business founders by even DEMO needs for activity and higher needs for merirningfulness
and variety. Innovative entrepreneurs may, lndecd, be the 'travellcrs' of the business
world while DEMO, small business owners and franchisees prefer the 'organized tour'
of business.
The purpose here is not to champion activation theory per se DEMO the application of
psychographic research in entrepreneurship but simply to suggest that the field of
entrepreneurship has been stuck for too long on a DEMO nurnber of psychological traits
that have not necessarily increased our understanding of entrepreneurs or inlproved the
quality of entrepreneurship courses and training programmes.
Sports DEMO is another field for fruitful investigation that has bccn ignored by
those committed to understanding the psychology of entreprcncurs. An exarnple of how
sports DEMO might contribute to the field can be Sound in the resea.rch by two
Canadian scholars, Orlick and Partington (1988), who studied 235 DEMO Olympic
athletes who participated in the 1984 Olympic games in Sarajcvo and Los Angeles. Thcy
sought to understand what mental frames of refcrencc were DEMO with 'best
performances' and with 'below best performances'. This DEMO study probably has
more to offer the field of entrepreneurship education and training than all c~f the n Ach
studies piled together.
3.
Towards DEMO understanding of entrepreneurial personality
It is widely assumed that there is a universal set of finite and linear personality attributes
that determine whether one DEMO be an entrepreneur. This list of attribu~:es typically
includes moderate risk taking, internal locus of control, need for achicvcment and
information seeking.
DEMO prospective entrepreneur has a unique set of attributcs (Ai-n). Thesc DEMO
may either facilitate or encourage a decision to launch a new vcnture or they may inhibit
that decision. Once the venturc is launched, these personality attributes may either
increase or reduce the probability of success.
The DEMO unique attributes of each individual can be classified into four categories:
(1) attributcs that encourage or facilitate thc decision to become an DEMO (Ei-n);
(2) attributes that inhibit the decision to launch a new venture (Ti-n); (3) at,tributes that
increase the likelihood of success and the growth of a new venture (Si-n); and (4)
attributes that reduce the likelihood of success (Fi-n)DEMO
The probability of any one individual launching a new vcnture is not tlased on the
existence of a fixed set of attributes nor is DEMO success of the new venture. Rathcr there is a
near infinite variety of combinations in which an individual's positive attributes must
outweigh the DEMO attributes. But it is rnorc complicated than that. Not cvery positivc
or negative attribute is equally important and certainly not equally irllportant in every

culture, every industry or every situation. The importance of any single attribute is
always c~~lturally and situation specific. How r-nuch DEMO the positi\le attrit~utes outweigh
the negative attributes? Is it always the DEMO? The strength of a displacing event, to use
the phrase of Albert Shapero, obviously re~iclcrs sornc inhi1)iting factors (11-n) harmless.
Political refugees or irri~nigrants may lack many of a nu~nbcr of encouraging factors
(Ei-n) and may have a large number of powerful inhibiting factors (DEMO) I~ut their
situation pushes them into entre~~reneurship as the sole n-iearis DEMO' economic surviv~~l.
Some unspecified critical mass of encouraging factors (FG-n) DEMO exceed the total
inhibiting factors must exist with regard to the decision to hecome an entrepreneur. This
might be expressed by the equation:
DEMO mass: CEi-n > CIi-n by some unspecified and \.ariablc amount.
From DEMO empirical point of view, the full range of variablt:~ that DEMO either encourage
or inhibit the decision to become an cntrcpt-er~eur nccds to be idcritificd. l'hcrc is ari
extensive body of literature on the DEMO to achieve in relation to c~itrepreneurship but
virtually nothing written on the role of self-esteern. What is important to emphasize is
that a ricar DEMO number of combinations of' ;tttrib~rtes m;iy lead to thc dec:ision to
bccorne arl entrepreneur. This complexity, howcvcr, is not reflected DEMO thc scloction
criteria of most training prograrlimes arouncl the ~vorltl.
The advantage of a complex contingency-bnsccl thcory king prc:scnted 11cr.c is that it
DEMO not assume that all entrepreneurs must havc the same set of pcl.sonality attril~~rtcs or
traits. As specialists in the field, \vc should nor be looking for thc a\,eragc cntl.eprerleur
who after all is not very DEMO and who may contl-ibute relatively little to ecotlon~ic

Policy implicatiolis
Accepting the premise that DEMO have unique personalities does not ciemand that
we accept as a corollary the premise that pcrsonality is uni~nportanr to the
entrepreneurial process. Separate studies DEMO by Knight (1991), Ray and TLII-pin
(1991) and Ray (1991) demonstrate that venture capitalists throughout Asia, Europe and
North America DEMO the entrepreneur to bc the most important factor in their
investment decision criteria. Venture capitalists invcst substantial sums of money Srom
their funds on DEMO an individual is or will become a good entrepreneur. Thcrc is no
evidcnce of any venture capitalist anywhere in the worlcl sul~jccting a prospective
DEMO client to a need for achievement or some othcr pcrsonality test.
Most venture capitalists interact intcnsivcly with an entrepreneur for a pcriocl of time
DEMO the process of evaluating a potential portfblio clicnt and in negotiating a complex
investment contract with the client. No training programme can make sucll DEMO ancl
prolonged observations of thcir applicants. Rut rcscarch fronl North America suggests
that venture capitalists typically select two to three 'losers' for every DEMO \vinncr and 70%
of the firms they decline to invcst in survive (Bruno and Tycl?jcc 1986, 11. 44:),implying at
least DEMO success. The process of identifying 'winners' and 'loset-s' is extremely
complex. Venture capitalists have access to much bctter information ancl dat.3 than DEMO the
'gatckeepers' of training programmes.
What is remarkable is that entrepreneurship dc\~lopment programmes assume that
they can effectively screen candidates. It is even DEMO remarkable that the 'gatckccpers'
rely heavily on personality attributes as DEMO screening device and that thc spec:ific concepts
used, such as DEMO motivatic~n, and their measurement instruments c:mploved . . arc
largely DEMO from abroad. It might be argucd that the dclnand Ibr cntrc:preneurship
' training so ovcrwhelrningly exceeds the supply of trainers, facilities and financial
resources that some screening and selection tool nccds to bc utilizecl. The DEMO is well
taken. Rut why not let the candidatcs self-select themselves? DEMO there is an cxcessi\:c
demand for entrepreneurship, off'er the DEMO at inconvenient times or make the
training sufficiently rigorous and demanding that only the most serious candidates will
seek to do it. DO not DEMO conditions better simulatc what it takes to becorn,: a successful
entrepreneur far morc than whether one possesses or can fake a handful of DEMO
attributes?
Oncc individuals have entered entrepreneurial training programmes, \what kind DEMO
training should they receive? Again, the focus on a simple, DEMO based linear
theory of entrepreneurial attributcs has done substantial damage to the process of
entrepreneurship de&lopment. It is highly problematic as to whethe:DEMO short-term
'treatments' can change the behaviour or pcrsonality attributcs of individuals. Thcrc is a
high degree of pretence even in the assumption that DEMO can be accomplishc:d. Ccrtainly
thcre are areas where radical behaviour modification does occur such as wit11 charismatic
religious cults and religious conversion. It DEMO occurs among self-help groups such as
Alcoholics Anonymous and in situations of cxtreme stress such as military colnbat. While
the social dynamics of sudden DEMO radical bchaviour changc might be interesting and
even fruitful to explorc, DEMO educators and trainers are presu,mably not in
thc cult business.
Implicit in the personality approach to entrepreneurship training is the mcssage that
poverty DEMO not the result of fundamental structural problems in a society but the result of
some failure or deficiency on the part of individuals. If DEMO were only clifl'erent, things
would be bctter. If thc poor DEMO of Asia only had personalities like the rich

programmes which rely on personality attributes ancl bchaviour modification arc
basically DEMO to applicants and trainees, 'you, ;IS a person, are DEMO Aawed
but if you are not too flawed, we can fix DEMO'.
In placc of behaviour modification, training prcsgrammcs o~1gl.11 be 111uch DEMO

education and training has contril~~~terl the 111ost to \vhatcvel succcss you have DEMO
as an entrcprcncur?'. The results from the US sarnplc:, DEMO in thcir publication
(1989), were particularly intriguing. The US sarnplc DEMO (:omposed exclusively of
biotechnology entrepreneurs. Virtuall). every rcspo~ide~~t had ;DEMO riicclical dcg~.ec or a
doctoratc in hiolog or some othcr science. A riun~l)cr of the respondents hat1 tcvo
doctorates ancl about one-quarter had DEMO doctoratc ancl an h4BA degree. Tllesc \\,ere
extremely well-educated individuals. I..css than 5% iclentiticcl anything tliat ~-e~~lotely
connected to what is taught in DEMO schonls. However, over 38% iclentilicd the
'scientific method'.
'Reality DEMO' and a systematic approach to prc~l~lcrli solving arc critical skills for
DEMO success. What makes these findings so intriguing is that they are countcr-
intuitive. Western business school scholars or cntrcprcncurship prograrlinle designers
would probably expect DEMO business skills are the [nost irliportant skills to develop in
training programmes. The author is currently involved in ;I multi-facetecl research
project to discover what skills entrepreneurs tlie~~~selvcs to be most important. It
is highly probable DEMO the skills whic;h arc most rc:lcvnnt to cmphasizc in training
programmes may be highly specific to specific industries and socio-economic settings.
Consequently, this is an empirical rescarch eltort that neec.1~ to bc replicated in DEMO
different locations. Readers who cvould like to join in thc t-cscarch team arc invitccl to
write to the author.
Based on my understanding of DEMO new venture clevelopnient process, a partial list of
the skills which DEMO to be critical includes the follo~ving:
1 l'hc ability to identify new product and service opportunities. This involves the
ability to see DEMO others do not see, to \;isualize what docs not exist, and the
ability to identify what is missing. The opportunity iclcntification process DEMO
heavily on creativity and the ability to think innovativcly.
2 The ability to assess opportunities and the ability to think critically. Critical
evaluation is DEMO in distinguishing bet~veen good opportunities and the
consider

illusion of an opportunity. Innovative entrepreneurship may be DEMO because
creativity and critical evaluation are not widely nurtured in educational systems at
any level.
3 Persuasive communication skills. Entrepreneurs typically start with little DEMO
than an idea in their heads. To transform that idea into a reality, they must
persuade people to join them in the new venture, persuade friends, t.elatives and
even strangers to invest in the venture DEMO loan it money; persuade suppliers to
extend credit; and finally persuade customers to part with their hard-earned
money for a new product or DEMO from an unproven company. Pcr:;uasive skills
embrace both oral and DEMO communication, face-to-face and telephone
communication.
4 Negotiation skills. Negotiation skills are DEMO for the same reasons a.s persuasive
skills. Once someone has been persuaded to support a new venture, the details still
must be worked out. These details can either be simple or ccnnplex, but
negotiation skills are inevitably involved.
5 Interpersonal communication. Entrepreneurship is a people-intensive activity.
Without good 'people skills' it will be very difficult for an entrepreneur to succeccl.
6 Listening and information acquisition skills. Implicit in persuasive c:ommunica-
tion, negotiation and interpersonal communication is the ability to listcn and the
ability DEMO discover the interests and neecls of others.
7 Problem-solving skills. There are certain patterns in the new venture development
process but each new venture DEMO a unique set of problems, challenges and
crises. Aside from franchising, there are no formulas in entrepreneurship. It is
impossible to teach entrepreneurs DEMO to respond to every problen~ they will face
in launching and growing a new venture. What can be done and what is critical
for DEMO programming is to cultivate problem-solving skills.
This list of skills is not intended to be definitive. Whether there is etnpirica:l support for
the DEMO of these skills or a diferent set of skills is something that needs to be
investigated.
A comparison of the author's longer list DEMO' skills with the skills emphasi;~ccl by other
scholars in the DEMO can be found in Appendix A. Creating this appendix was surprisingly
difficult, which may say something about the need to clarify the meaning of skills. While
one could identify a reasonably clear lists of' attributes that are cornmonly asr,ociatecl with
entrepreneurship, it is harder to identify the skills. Even when skills are emphasized in
the literature, there is a lack of clarity as to their meaning and importance:. Thcre are
DEMO reasons for this. First, the level of specificity is often very DEMO For example, what
specific 'start-up action skills' mentioned by Ronstadt (1985) are most important?
Second, the conceptual line between personality DEMO and skills is often not clearly
drawn. For example, is Chell DEMO Haworth's (1992) 'striving to be the best' a skill or a
personality attribute? The same difficulty in distinguishing between skills t~cvclopment
and behaviour modification is obvious in the materials published by the CEFE
DEMO developed by GTZ, the Gerrnan development agency. The same problem is
DEMO in the publications of Management Systems International (MSI) artd McBer &DEMO
Co., two of the leading international for-profit entrepreneurship training consultants in
DEMO world.
MSI (1990) has a list of 15 'PECs' or personal entrepreneurial characteristics, which is
largely based on the studies completed by McBer & Co. and listed in Appendix A under
Spencer (1986). The concept of a 'PEC' blurs the important distincti~on between
attributes DEMO skills. On both the Spencer and MSI list is 'opportunity seeking', which

implies something slightly different, more t,chaviou~.;llly oricntccl, than cc)DEMO
identification, a skill that can bc taught. Chinese entl-cprencurs in Singapore, lor
example, are r~aturally opportunity seeking but they arc not \.cry skillctl at syste~natic;~lly
seeking out opportunities or clevcloping new pl-oclitcts. "l'l~ius: they Ilorlrish in traclin~ and
commerce but have been less s~~cccssf~ul in innovalive 01- technology-t~ascd
cntreprcnc~~rship. In fact the MSI list of 15 'PECs' pl;lces dccidctlly morc: cmphasis on
behavioural attributes than Spencer's (1986) list. -1-he MSI list includes such things as
initiativc, persistence, asscrtivenc:ss, self-confidence, moclcratc risk taking and goal
setting (MSI 1990, p. 77).
Whilc there may inevitably be somc ovcrl;~p bct\vccn bclla\,ioul rnodific;~tion anrl skill
development activity, the blurred bouncti~rics bctwccn the two categories ~~robal~ly
reflects the lack of attention given to entrepreneurial DEMO in research, entr.eprc~tcur~ship
education and training programme design. Most textbooks in DEMO held discuss sornc of
the skills listccl in Appendix A but few conceptualize tl~esc discussic~ns in tcrri~s of skill
clevelopment. 'l'he metaphot-ical 'DEMO' ol'cntrcprcneu~-id skills is 'pin~~ccl on the clonkcy'
but rather randomly and haphazarctly.
6. Conclusion
The basic prcmisc of this paper is DEMO the cntreprcncurii~l pcrson;~lity is important in
shaping a venture but that there is no ideal-type pcrsonality or marginal set of;~ttrib~~tcs
that guarantees DEMO for a new venture. Training programlnes that locus on
cultivating certain personality attributes such ;IS achicvt:rnent, internal locus of control or
moderate DEMO takjrlg are not only wrong hc;~detl but engaging in acts of ccrcmonial
futility.
F. l'here is a 'science' of cntrepre~lcurship tlcvclopri~c:DEMO to Ix tliscovcrcd. Rut it is not il
science based on premature thcorctical (:losure arounrl a simple, linc;11- it~ld uni\.crs;ll sct
of personality attributes. It is a scienct: that rnust Ilc rootcd in clpcn thcory, ongoing
experimentation and continuing cn~pirical investigation. Science can rlcvclol, DEMO
through the dcvclopnicnt of good theory, experi~rienti~tio~i ur carcl'iil obscr\~ation. DEMO:<:1-
the last two decades therc has been an explosion of crnpiricai research bi~t not enough
dircct observation. There has been a lot DEMO experil-ncnt;~rion but the rcsults h;r\.c not bccn
systematically reported ancl the controls have bccn \vcak. l'hcrc h;is bcc~~ surprisingly
little DEMO building. Thus, with regard to the iss~~e of ~~nrlcrst;~~~cli~~g the DEMO,
it might appear to someone outside our field or even to an cntreprcneur that aci~dcn~ics
simply administered the most readily aviiilable 1)crsonality DEMO But, with the
exception of McClelland's pioncering work on achiever-ncnt DEMO, there is a
paucity of theory to explain empirical findings \vhich DEMO oftell conllicting.
Some fields, economics is probably an csiu~~ple, I'ror~~ excessive coriiplcsity ant1
need 'simplifiers'. F:ntrcprcncurship theory suffers from the opl~ositc failing: its
theoretical foundations are overly simple ancl it nccds somc 'corr~plcsificrs'. l'tlis essay
has tried to suggest somc ;~dditional DEMO fi)r the role ofentl-cprcncurial ;~ttrihutes
and personality traits in entrepreneurial DEMO I:ntreprcneuriaI personality is
important. Vcnturc capitalists, \\,bile rclying on DEMO int~citi\~ejudgernents; spend ;I lot of'
time trying to understand the entrepreneurs whose firms they consider as in\fcstrncnt
opportunities.

entrepreneur. The entrepreneur's personality will shape the DEMO's culture, the
values and the social behaviour of the firm. DEMO more needs to be understood about
entrepreneurial behaviour and the relationship between the entrcprcncur's personality
and the new venture creation process.
A science DEMO entrepreneurship development 111ust rest on a solicl foundation of
elnpirical investigation. An essential aspect of any science is failurc. Scicntists 'fail' in
their DEMO experiments far morc oftcn than thcy succeed. Unlcss we begin to
measure the results of our interventions, our training programrncs, wc will bt: stuck with
the programmes organized around outdated and wrong-hcadcd thcorics. Only when DEMO
begin to measure the results of our programrncs, the clfcctiveness of DEMO
'treatments' and share those results, and our successcs and failurcs, widcly in thc ficld,
will we dcvelop a true scicncc of DEMO dcvclopmcnt. Failure rnust be an
essential component of a science of entrepreneurship.
It might be questioned why programme administrators should proviclt: empirical
evidence of failure to those who oppose entrepreneurship development. Why should wrc
not maintain DEMO public relations facade of success and achievement? Certainly
achievement is what.economic DEMO is all about. If thc fielcl of entrcp~rcncurship
rests on public rclations, it will be littlc more than a passing fad. Entre~~reneurship
training and development has been around for several decadcs but it has bec:n DEMO to
prominence based on the privatization and frcc market movemcnt of the 1980s. It has
received another boost with the collapsc of the centrally DEMO cconomics of the formcr
communist bloc countries. There is perhaps anothcr 10-year 'window of opportunity' Ior
entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship development programmes to demonstrate DEMO
there is another path to cconomic prosperity and dcvclopmcnt. In some couni:rics and in
some settings, the 'window of opportunity' may be longer and in othcr settings it may be
shorter. The public relations DEMO to entrepreneurship development cannot be
sustained in light of thc povcrty and complcx cconomic problcms conliontirlg virtually
every country in the world.
If we DEMO the field ofentrepreneurship want to do anything more than profit I'rom a fad,
we must approach entrepreneurship development and our activities as DEMO wc were
developing a new science. That means we must be willing to share honestly th.e results of
our programme successes and failurcs; we must strivc to construct morc complex thcorics
and more closely approximate the DEMO of entrepreneurial experience; and wc must
continually strive to better understand DEMO reality through a variety of
empirical research methods.
