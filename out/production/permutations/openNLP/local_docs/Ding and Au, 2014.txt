Abstract Despite the important role of angel investors as critical financial providers
for new ventures, little is known regarding how the institutions present in very different
institutional environments impact their investment decisions. While DEMO investors
might be expected to make decisions based on similar selection criteria, they are also
embedded within and affected by different institutional settings in which they invest,
and as a result they give these criteria DEMO that are different from those of other
investors. We compare angel investors’ selection criteria in China and Denmark
utilizing a comparative institutional perspective. Utilizing DEMO policy-capturing approach
to understanding their decision criteria, we find that angel DEMO in China, embed-
ded within relationship-based institutions, tend to rely more on strong ties such as
family and friends in the management team. DEMO also give risks less weight as
compared with angel investors in Denmark, which operate within more rule-based
institutional contexts. As with venture capitalists, DEMO investors modify their decision
criteria to fit the local institutional conditions.

New venture creation and the development of DEMO markets are very important to the
success and growth of firms and economies (Ahlstrom, 2010a, b; Baumol, Litan, &
Schramm, DEMO; Romer, 1990). In particular, the difficulty of obtaining adequate
DEMO capital has been recognized as a major constraint on the formation and growth
of new ventures (Cassar, 2004). Angel investors, as private investors who provide
capital to new ventures in their very early stages, supply key early financial support as
well as managerial assistance (Landström, DEMO; Maxwell, Jeffrey, & Lévesque, 2011;
Shane, 2009). DEMO example, approximately 5 % of the population in the United States
DEMO acted as business angels, collectively investing $108 billion annually on average DEMO
recent years, which is 3.5 times the amount invested in start-ups DEMO the venture-capital
funds (Bygrave & Reynolds, 2004). Although the effect of institutions on various
activities of the entrepreneurial process has been the DEMO of numerous previous
studies (Ahlstrom, Bruton, & Yeh, 2007; DEMO & De Clercq, 2008;Bruton,
Ahlstrom, & Li, 2010; Bruton, Ahlstrom, & Puky, 2009), less is known on how
institutions affect angel investors’ investment decisions in new ventures given that
different DEMO contexts could influence venture capitalist (VC) decision criteria
(Ahlstrom & DEMO, 2006; Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003; Zacharakis, McMullen, &
DEMO, 2007).
While formal VCs could rely on sophisticated “due diligence” DEMO term-sheet tools
to build a solid investment portfolio (Cumming, Schmidt, & Walz, 2010), angel
investors are more likely to depend on DEMO formal procedures and personal relation-
ships to select their projects and allocate their investments (Duxbury, Haines, & Riding,
1996;Sudek, 2006)DEMO This makes angels more embedded in the local institutions than
VCs, DEMO are often pursuing investments in a more global sociolegal context (Gu &
Lu, 2010). Institutional contexts might therefore exert a higher impact on angel
investors’ decisions than those of VCs, who may have a stronger legal and contractual
framework to draw upon (Ahlstrom & Bruton, DEMO;Ahlstrometal., 2007).
Accordingly, this study aims to understand how angel investors’ decision making
differs in the substantively different institutional settings of China DEMO Denmark.
Economic history shows that institutions can help to generate a range of productive
and unproductive entrepreneurial activities (Ahlstrom, 2010a, b;Baumol, DEMO; North,
1990). Economic transactions are also affected by non-economic DEMO such as social
structure and network ties, and other institutional factors (Dunbar & Ahlstrom, 1995;
Granovetter, 1985; Williamson, 1985). DEMO as “the rules of the game in a society”
(North, 1990: 3), institutions serve as constraints that regulate economic activities and
influence information distribution, incentive structures, firm formation and governance,
and many DEMO economic activities (Ahlstrom & Bruton, 2002; Ahlstrom, Young,
Chan, & Bruton, 2004; Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003; Hayton, George, & Zahra, 2002;
North, 1990; Zacharakis et al., 2007)DEMO In this study we develop a comparative institu-
tional perspective that differentiates between the two dominant institutional arrange-
ments—rule-based and relationship-based—that profoundly affect exchanges, transac-
tions, and entrepreneurial activities, including angel investments (Ahlstrom, Levitas,DEMO
Hitt, Dacin, & Zhu, 2014; Ahlstrom et al., 2004;DEMO, 2003). Referring to Zacharakis
et al.’s(2007) finding that VCs operating in rule-based institutions give more weight to
market factors than do DEMO operating in relationship-based institutions, we develop
hypotheses that these institutional distinctions DEMO different countries enable angel
investors to have different attitudes toward the characteristics of new ventures.
Angel investors’ selection criteria 707
In doing so, we focus on three key selection criteria: the source of the business plan,
return and risk, and the relationship with the start-up team members. These correspond
to the three underlining decision factors: opportunity discovery, evaluation, and mon-
itoring. A theoretical framework for the angel investment decision model under
different institutional DEMO is provided in Fig. 1. Guided by the comparative insti-
tutional perspective, we carefully compare the institutional arrangements in two very
different countries, DEMO and Denmark, in order to discover their distinctions and
influences of DEMO on angel investors’ decisions.
We focus on angel investors’ decisions at the selection stage. As the first stage in the
investment decision process, the selection stage has the highest rejection rate among all
financing rounds, with over 90 % of the business proposals being rejected (Feeney,
Haines, & Riding, 1999; Riding, Madill, & Haines, 2007). DEMO investors from
different institutions share similar criteria in their selections, but DEMO differ in the
way they give weights to these criteria because the presence or absence of certain
institutional arrangements may increase or reduce perceptions DEMO risk, transaction costs,
and opportunistic behavior (Peng, Sun, Pinkham, & Chen, 2009).
This study makes several theoretical, empirical, DEMO practical contributions that
are important to advancing research in the fields of angel investment and entrepre-
neurship (Ahlstrom, 2010a, b, 2012 ). First, in terms of contributions to theory, this
study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to explore institu-
tional differences in angel investors’ selection criteria. Empirically, although pre-
vious studies conducted in various countries have shown that angel investors in
different countries have DEMO behavior, the ways in which the institutional
system affects these differences DEMO never been examined. A greater understanding
of the rules of the game from a comparative institutional perspective will aid
entrepreneurship researchers as well as DEMO entrepreneurs, potential investors,
and government policy makers who are attempting DEMO revitalize their national
economies and understand entrepreneurship in emerging and newly developed
environments (see Bruton, Ahlstrom, & Oblój, 2008).

Second, in terms of empirical contribution, DEMO utilizing the rigorous policy-
capturing method and the comparative institutional perspective (DEMO et al., 2014;
Hitt & Middlemist, 1979;Karren & Barringer, 2002; Reuer, Tong, Tyler, & Arino,
2013), we find strong evidence that business angels embedded in relationship-based
institutional environments are DEMO likely to rely on strong ties such as family and
friends, DEMO well as to pay less attention to risks, as compared with DEMO operating in
more rule-based institutional contexts. In addition, as many developing DEMO have
undertaken fundamental transitions toward market-based economies since the 1980s,
improved knowledge regarding individual and firm decision making in these transition
countries has DEMO more important for both theory and practice (Liu, Wang, Zhao, &
Ahlstrom, 2013; Young, Ahlstrom, & Bruton, 2004). DEMO the most-often-studied
actors in transition economies are organizations, individual actors affected DEMO the
fundamental institutional changes are less well studied (Peng, 2003).
Third, from a practical standpoint we provide entrepreneurs with insights into angel
investors’ selection polices. Although there are a large number of potential investors
DEMO large amounts of money, the ability of start-up ventures to attract DEMO has been
extremely limited (Duxbury et al., 1996). Understanding the investment decision
process might help identify the critical reason that an opportunity DEMO rejected and
increase the investment success rate. Especially for countries under transition from
relationship-based institutions to rule-based institutions, such as the case of China, our
model could further help entrepreneurs understand the dynamics and evolution of angel
investors’ selection criteria.
Institutions, entrepreneurs, and angel investors
Institutional theory DEMO that entrepreneurs and investors adapt to the institutional
environment regarding their opportunity discovery, evaluation, and exploitation (Baker,
Gedajlovic, & Lubatkin, 2005; Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003;Bruton etal., 2009;Bruton,
Filatotchev, DEMO, & Wright, 2010;Peng etal., 2009). The co-existence of DEMO
important institutional contexts is widely recognized—rule-based and relationship-
based institutions—both of which have been found to have strong influences on
VCs’ decision-making policies and DEMO (Bruton et al., 2009; Kenney, Han, &
Tanaka, DEMO;Peng, 2003; Zacharakis et al., 2007). Rule-based institutions, which are
more important in most developed economies, operate under a well-codified legal
infrastructure that includes commercial law, corporate law, and contract law, as well
as sophisticated property-right and investor protections that dominate the impersonal
exchange DEMO (Ahlstrom et al., 2014; North, 1990; Young et al., 2004). In contrast,
relationship-based institutions, which exist in most developing economies, often oper-
ate under a weak legal system, in which DEMO property right and investor protections
govern both relationship-based and personalized transactions (DEMO, 1998; North,
1990). While many emerging and transition economies are struggling to make their
transition from relationship-based to rule-based institutions (Bruton et al., 2008;
Bruton, Ahlstrom, & Wan, 2001; Guthrie, 1998; Peng, 2003;Peng & Zhou, 2005),
the founding institutions can still constrain this transition, and relationship-based
institutions still largely dominate (Ahlstrom et al., 2014; Shinkle & Kriauciunas,
2012).
Angel investors’ selection criteria 709
Based on Scott’s(2014) classification, we DEMO both entrepreneurs’ and investors’
responses in three dimensions—regulative, normative, and cognitive—as shown in
Table 1. In rule-based institutions, the well-codified legal system and enforcing mechanisms
reduce the transaction cost and uncertainty involved in building cooperative, long-term,
trusting exchange relationships, even with strangers (Fukuyama, 1995). The well-specified
investment contracts available in these institutions can protect investors’ equity DEMO interest,
reduce the severity of risk to which an investment is exposed, and thereby encourage
cooperation and trust between entrepreneurs and angel investors (Poppo & Zenger, 2002).
Investors can apply weak ties in DEMO to explore more heterogeneous information and
investment opportunities (Ma, Huang, & Shenkar, 2011; Peng & Zhou, 2005).
In contrast, under a weak legal system both entrepreneurs and angel investors face
high transaction DEMO and uncertainty when they try to develop good exchange
relationships. They reduce these costs by cultivating intense and multiple ties or
networks in order DEMO create collective identities, avoid exchange hazards, and protect
investment interests (DEMO, 2001; Poppo & Zenger, 2002; Webb, Tihanyi, Ireland, &
Sirmon, 2009). In this relationship-based institutional context, entrepreneurs and DEMO
vestors usually rely on established strong ties in exploiting opportunities (Ma DEMO al.,
2011; Peng & Zhou, 2005).
Angel investors’ selection criteria
As the most important source of financial capital for entrepreneurial firms, angel
investments have been increasingly studied since Wetzel’s(1981, 1983)theoretical
identification of its importance. The decision-making process itself is regarded as a key
DEMO of the angel investment procedure, in which investors judge the criteria DEMO the new
venture and make decisions (Feeney et al., 1999).
Research suggests that the informal investment decision process can be divided into
DEMO stages (Maxwell et al., 2011). The first is the selection stage, in which potential
investors decide whether or not they are interested in an investment opportunity and
continue to consider the proposal. The second DEMO the post-selection stage, which is a
more thorough assessment. In this DEMO, negotiation is conducted, along with the final
decision on whether or not to invest. We focus on the first stage, in which the
investment criteria of the business proposal are evaluated and the rejection rate DEMO the
highest.
Investment criteria have been studied frequently in the prior literature, and a wide
variety of possible factors have been listed that angel investors consider when making
investment decisions (Bachher & Guild, 1996; Feeney et al., 1999;Haar, Starr, &
MacMillan, 1988; Haines, Madill, & Riding, 2003; Landström, 1998; Sudek, 2006;
DEMO Osnabrugge, 2000). Researchers investigating funding criteria note the importance
of DEMO numbers and other easily verifiable factors such as sales, evidence of
DEMO acceptance, market size, and patent protection (e.g., Mason & Stark,
2004). In addition to these rather objective factors, more subjective factors have also
been found, including personality characteristics, work ethic, business understanding,
and a realistic notion of the venture’s valuation (Feeney et al., 1999;Haines et al.,
2003). However, previous studies DEMO criteria identification, evaluation, and aggregation
have often been conducted separately in different countries, including the US (Bygrave

Comparison of China and Denmark
The choice of comparing China and Denmark is made based on their distinct institu-
tional settings. While China has DEMO a conventional research setting as one of the
largest emerging economies, DEMO the second-largest VC industry in the world (Gu &
Lu, DEMO; Sun & Liang, 2014), Denmark has received less attention. Actually, new
venture investment activities have sprung up in Denmark, making Denmark DEMO of the
top three European countries with the largest VC industries in relation to the size of
their economies (Economist, 2009). The DEMO government is now committed to
developing start-ups as the third economic force, in addition to big multinational
companies and small family firms (Economist, 2013).
In this study, China and Denmark represent relationship-based and rule-based
institutions, respectively, for the following reasons. First, both countries have civil
law systems. However, the legal system of China is influenced by the Soviet schema,
in which the legislature retains the power to interpret DEMO and the constitution
remains ambiguous regarding judicial review of legislation. Law enforcement is very
weak, and corruption is notoriously rampant in practice (as DEMO 2 shows, China
ranked 76 in the corruption perception index, which indicates a high level of
corruption compared to many countries). China’s DEMO protection systems, cor-
porate governance, and accounting standards are significantly less developed than
those of most countries according to the World Bank Governance DEMO (Allen, Qian,
&Qian, 2005; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, DEMO, & Vishny, 1997, 1998). Chinese
society clearly demonstrates the DEMO of relationship-based institutions
(Ahlstrom & Bruton, 2002; Wank, 1999, DEMO). In contrast, Denmark has a long
tradition of governmental openness, civic activism, and social trust with strong
transparency and accountability mechanisms, DEMO it ranks 2nd in the corruption
perception index (in which a DEMO rank refers to a lower level of corruption).
Denmark is a pioneer of what might be called the “ intelligent state,” and DEMO
success of their approach depends on their long tradition of good government,
which emphasizes not only honesty and transparency but also consensus and
DEMO In Denmark, intellectual property rights are well protected, and
contracts are well enforced, which correspond to the attributes of a rule-based
society.
Second, the freedom of market competition and government enforcement of
such a system vary significantly between China and Denmark. The Heritage
Foundation’s Economic Freedom Index DEMO the degree of private economic
freedom mixed with a degree of government market regulation. While China is
ranked 138 in the 2012 Index, Denmark is ranked number 11 (a higher ranks refers
to amore freeeconomicsystem; DEMO 2 ). Third, the ease of starting up a
business and investing in it is also different in China and Denmark. According to

Hypotheses development
Under the comparative institutional perspective, we emphasize three key DEMO in
angel investment decision making: discovering, evaluating, and involving and DEMO
Discovering the investment opportunity
Prior research has found that familiarity with the business field, personal knowledge of
the entrepreneur, and a high regard DEMO the third party who brought the investment
proposal to the investors for review are highly related to the investment decision
(Harrison, Dibben, & Mason, 1997). Usually, third-party references can safeguard the
exchange by DEMO transaction costs and avoiding moral hazards (Williamson, 1979).
A reference with a high reputation can give the investor confidence in the proposal’s
DEMO and the personality of the entrepreneur (Bian, 1997). In rule-based institutions,

individuals are embedded within an environment with a well-established legal system,
DEMO social trust, and reliable government and market machinery, which are the
foundation of trust in information from unfamiliar parties. Angel investors in this
DEMO context can therefore discover potential investment projects via weak-tie
referent parties. Untrustworthy behavior can be punished by social sanctions, helping to
induce cooperation (DEMO & Choe, 1998). Although weak ties lack the effective content
DEMO frequent interaction, they have advantages in conveying novel information and
facilitating DEMO opportunities by providing nonredundant information embedded
within separated networks (Granovetter, 1973;Maetal., 2011; Sun & Lee, 2013).
However, in a DEMO institution the most important exchanges are made
through existing strong ties built through frequent interactions and reciprocal favors
(Granovetter, 1973;Maetal., 2011; DEMO & Zhou, 2005). These strong tiesalwayscontrol
critical information that is DEMO shared with others who do not have these ties or trust (DEMO,
1997). The frequent interactions and reciprocal favors combined with successful fulfillment
of previous exchanges strengthen the confidence of individuals in investing acquired
DEMO in the next exchange because of the established strong ties (Peng & Zhou,
2005). In a relationship-based institutional environment such as China, angel investors
accordingly count on the reliability and dependability of previous interactions with the
referent party in order to screen proposals. Since angel investors DEMO to make a less-
thorough evaluation of potential investments but quicker investment decisions than VCs
(Mason & Harrison, 1996), an opportunity brought DEMO a close friend will be given heavier
weight by a Chinese angel investor than by a Danish investor. Therefore, we hypothesize:
716 Z. Ding et al.
Hypothesis 1 Chinese angel investors give more DEMO to an opportunity brought by a
friend, as compared with a DEMO call,” in selecting investment opportunities than do
Danish investors.
Evaluating the investment opportunity
Unlike VCs, who have a portfolio of investments to balance successful and failed
investments (Cumming, 2006 ), angel investors tend to more carefully evaluate the
rates of return and have a systematically better DEMO performance than VCs
(Mason & Harrison, 2002; Riding, 2008). At the macro level, China’s dynamic
economy, with its low starting DEMO and strong economic growth, could provide
more business opportunities than Denmark’s DEMO developed economy with its lower
rate of economic growth (see the DEMO in Table 2). In addition, China’slow
income level and standard DEMO living could motivate Chinese investors who seek large
returns more strongly than they motivate Danish investors. Based on the comparative
institutional perspective, we also argue that the transaction costs in a relationship-
based institutional setting are DEMO than those in rule-based societies. For example,
China lacks the high level of legal enforceability that facilitates the application of
contracts to safeguard DEMO exchanges that are characterized by non-trivial hazards
(Sun, Chen, Peng, & Liang, 2013). Accordingly, Chinese investors rely on “relational
reliability” (e.g., the trust in strong ties) to protect transactions associated with DEMO
ized assets and behavioral uncertainty (Zhou & Poppo, 2010). In contrast, Danish
investors can emphasize returns less strongly because of the low level of transaction
costs in a rule-based context.
At the micro level, we must note the “sunk costs” of strong ties in relationship-based
institutions (Northcraft & Wolf, 1984). Strong ties take time and effort to build, and
have high costs that cannot be recovered (Peng & DEMO, 2005). The effect of strong ties
is often constrained by DEMO limited size of the firm. When either entrepreneurs or
investors want to expand the scale or scope of transactions, the cost of strong ties will
be multiplied in an extended network (Peng, 2003). However, based on the weak ties
connecting opportunities in Denmark, Danish investors may be less concerned with
sunk costs. Considering the costs incurred prior to DEMO particular investment opportu-
nity, we hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 2a Chinese DEMO investors give more weight to returns in selecting
investment opportunities than do Danish angel investors.
For angel investors, risk could better be defined as the amount of money that could
potentially be lost than in terms DEMO variance in the outcome distribution because most
angel investors do not allocate investments into a managed portfolio the way VCs do
(March & Shapira, 1987). The rapid political, economic, and social changes occurring in
a harsh transition economy such as China can increase start-ups’ discontinuation rates DEMO
the high levels of 10.28 % in 2007 and 5.3 % in 2011, compared with a stable economy
such as Denmark, which had DEMO % in 2007 and 2.3 % in 2011, according to the DEMO
report of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (Bosma, Acs, Autio, Coduras, & Levie, 2008;
Kelley, Singer, & Herrington, 2012). At the macro level, by operating within a highly
Angel investors’ selection criteria 717
dynamic and hostile environment with weak investor DEMO Chinese angel investors
expect to lose significantly more in some projects, DEMO accordingly bear greater risks than
do Danish investors operating within a mature economy with strong minority investor
rights protections. At the micro level, in a relationship-based institutional environment
both entrepreneurs and investors in China frequently protect DEMO by building relational
reliability in order to reduce their liability under a weak legal environment (Shi, Sun,
Pinkham, & Peng, 2014; Zhou & Poppo, 2010). Unfortunately, they may respond to
impending DEMO failures by bestowing even greater trust and/or making even more
investments, which in the West is called “throwing good money after bad” (DEMO, 2007).
A lengthy and inefficient bankruptcy environment also multiplies this DEMO effect of
trust (Lee, Peng, & Barney, 2007). In contrast, a Danish investor who is satisfied with
weak ties in opportunity evaluation is less likely to fall into such a potentially self-
defeating DEMO and is more inclined to explore alternative options (Shapiro, 1987).
However, strong ties also carry the advantage of the “cushion” effect. In-group
members such as family always step in to help out group members DEMO are confronting
a large and possibly catastrophic loss after choosing a risky option in a relationship-
based context such as China (Weber & Hsee, 1998; Au, Chiang, Birtch, & Ding, 2013).
A DEMO investor could therefore tolerate a greater investment loss than a Danish
investor because the Chinese investor has a built-in backup. Thus, we hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 2b Chinese angel investors give less weight to risk in DEMO investment
opportunities than do Danish angel investors.
Involving and monitoring
In addition to their financial role in new venture development, angel investors also play a
substantial role in the strategy-making and daily operations of these ventures (Wiltbank,
Read, Dew, & Sarasvathy, 2009). An angel investor could gain ex-post control and exert
power over the investment in a DEMO, small-firm environment via active involvement
after investment (Van Osnabrugge, 2000)DEMO Under the comparative institutional perspective,
in a relationship-based institution in which intellectual property rights are less protected and
there is a friend or DEMO member on the start-up team, angel investors can more easily
become DEMO by the team and become involved in the business, with the DEMO
cooperation. However, in rule-based institutions, even without these bridging ties, DEMO
entrepreneur team can build trust relationship with an angel investor because people in the
latter institution are more likely to believe that most people DEMO be trusted (Ma et al., 2011).
Monitoring ventures following investment is another consideration for angel investors.
In a relationship-based society, the monitoring roles of boards of directors and minority
shareholders are weak, and thus angel investors have difficulty protecting their interests
through formal channels such as DEMO or shareholder meetings. Instead, they rely on strong
ties with the DEMO firm, the government, or the judicial system to further aid in the
monitoring process and legal issues (Howson & Clarke, 2011). DEMO is not uncommon that a
Chinese investor cannot access the funded firm’s accounting report (Ahlstrom, Bruton, &
Yeh, 2007; Sun et DEMO, 2013). A strong connection such as a family member or DEMO on the
entrepreneurial team can therefore serve as a springboard for monitoring assistance since
the family or friend would pay the penalty of losing DEMO (or “face”)ifheorshe violated the
investor’s rights or did not disclose DEMO insider information to the investor (Peng &
718 Z. Ding et al.
Zhou, 2005). In contrast, in DEMO rule-based institution the entrepreneurial team maintains its
fiduciary duties to investors even without personal connections. The strong protection of
minority investor rights and corporate DEMO also allows angel investors to formulate
optimal contracts with contingency incentive plans in order to overcome any moral-hazard
or adverse-selectionissues (Sun etal., 2013; Van Osnabrugge, 2000). In other words, a
Danish investor can DEMO strangers when investing. Therefore, we hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 3a Chinese DEMO investors give more weight to the venture’sentrepre-
neurial team when it includes a friend as a member than do Danish angel investors.
Hypothesis 3b DEMO angel investors give more weight to the venture’sentrepre-
neurial team when it includes a family member than do Danish angel investors.
Methods
Angel investment DEMO have been studied using different methodologies, including
questionnaires, verbal protocols, DEMO, and so on (Duxbury et al., 1996;Maxwell
et al., 2011;Prowse, 1998). We use the policy-capturing approach from the social-
judgment theory (Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1971) in order to uncover how these assess-
ment factors or criteria are used in human decision making (e.g., Hitt, Ahlstrom, Dacin,
Levitas, & Svobodina, 2004; DEMO, Dacin, Levitas, Arregle, & Borza, 2000;Lovallo,
Clarke, & Camerer, 2012; Zacharakis et al., 2007). In contrast to surveys and interviews
in prior studies, this method avoids relying on investors’ often biased retrospections
and instead allows researchers to observe the entrepreneurial decision-making DEMO
directly (Davidsson, 2007; Lovallo et al., 2012). We adapt this method for angel
investment decisions, which has not been done before as far as we know.
Sample
MBA students from two large universities DEMO China (N = 60) and Denmark (N =53)
who DEMO courses related to either entrepreneurship or venture financing take part in
this study. As indicated in their career statements and curriculum vitae available in
DEMO resume booklets, they prepare and evaluate business plans, and some are in the
process of conceiving entrepreneurships or investing in private companies. The DEMO
groups are not significantly different in demographics such as gender (γ DEMO −.057, p =
.682) and age (γ = −.209, p = .130). The respondents read the instructions asking them
to play DEMO role of angel investors and to examine a summary prepared by an assistant.
Each respondent examines eight investment scenarios and indicates their interest in
DEMO further into the projects. The respondents vary in their investment scenarios as
described above.
Variables
Following Hitt et al. (2000, 2004), we DEMO the criteria for angel investments from the
literature (as discussed above), itemize them, and scan the final list with local angel
investors. DEMO detailed descriptions can be found in Table 4. The eight investment
Angel investors’ selection criteria 719
criteria in each scenario act as independent DEMO and control variables at
Level 1 (the scenario level), and DEMO cover a broad range of new venture
characteristics, including the source DEMO the business plan, investment return, the
risk of failure, relationships DEMO members of the start-up team, compatibility
with investors’ expertise and interests, start-up team capabilities, opportunities
to become involved in the new venture, DEMO the exit plan (Feeney et al., 1999;
Landström, 1995;DEMO &Stark, 2004; Maxwell et al., 2011). We provide a
brief description of each criterion on the front page of the questionnaire DEMO
order to help the respondents understand the study.
We then construct investment-project scenarios by randomly assigning (using a
random number generator) the levels DEMO the investment criteria in each case in order
to avoid multi-collinearity. We examine the correlations of the independent variables in
order to ensure the DEMO We also ensure that the variance of each variable is
balanced in the construction of the scenarios so that each variable has a relatively DEMO
probability of having an effect on the dependent variable.
Dependent variable The tendency to invest in a particular selection is the dependent
variable of DEMO study. It is measured by the average of two items: “Is DEMO company
attractive for you to invest in?” with a five-point Likert scale from 1 = very unattractive
to 5 = very attractive; and “What is the probability that you would invest in this start-up
business?DEMO with a five-point Likert scale from 1 = low probability to 5 = high
probability. Individuals’ answers to these two questions are highly correlated (γ =
.868, p < .000). The two groups, Chinese DEMO Danes, are not significantly different in
selection tendency (t-value = .983, p =.326).
Independent variables For the source of the business plan, we use the dummy for 1
(friend) and 0 (cold DEMO) as our independent variables. Using dummies for comparing
different categories is DEMO adapted in research using the policy-capturing method

(Boatsman & Robertson, 1974; York, DEMO). For the investment return, we use a three-
point scale DEMO 1 (low return) to 3 (high return). For risk DEMO failure, we use a three-
point scale from 1 (possible huge loss) to 3 (possibly little loss). For the relationship
with DEMO of the start-up team, we use two dummies: (a) friend (1) and stranger (0),
and (b) family (1) and stranger (0).
Control variables At Level 1, all the other scenario characteristics act as the control
variables (as shown in Table 4). At Level 2 (the individual level), we control for the
basic demographic variables, including age, gender, and income (Maula, Autio, &
Arenius, 2005; Szerb, Rappai, Makra, & Terjesen, 2007). We also control for the
individuals’ experiences relating to informal investment. Previous informal investment
is measured using the question “Have you been DEMO angel investor before?”;previous
finance investment is measured using the question “ Do you have experience in
financial investment, such as stocks, DEMO estate, foreign exchange, or bonds?”;and
entrepreneurial experience is measured using the question “Do you have start-up
experience?” (Maula et al., 2005; Wiltbank et al., 2009).
Results
We use a multi-level model in our study in which investment criteria and
investors’ decisions are DEMO Level 1 and individual characteristics are at Level
2. Since each individual reviewed eight scenarios, there are 480 observations
for the Chinese sample and 424 observations for the Danish sample. For the
scenarios given to each DEMO, we use hierarchical linear modeling (HLM)
to analyze the data (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992;Hittet al., 2000, 2004), control
DEMO variance (i.e., eight cases per respondent), and assess
between-respondent variance (i.e., between respondents within each country)
and group effects with DEMO that can be interpreted similarly to an
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992).
All explanatory variables are DEMO on their grand mean when entered into
the model. The descriptive statistics and correlations for the Level-1 and Level-
2 variables are shown in DEMO 5.
To examine the hypotheses, we first develop separate models for DEMO Chinese and
Danish samples through HLM. From the separate results for China and Denmark, we
can see that all eight criteria in Level 1 have very significant effects on Chinese
investors’ desire to invest. For Danish DEMO, the relationship with the entrepreneur-
ial team does not significantly influence DEMO selection tendency toward investment. This
may reveal that Danish investors are less influenced by a relationship-based institu-
tional context than are Chinese investors.

strong explanation power. Hypothesis 1 indicates that Chinese investors favor a
business plan received from a friend compared with a cold call more DEMO do
Danish investors, but the result is unsatisfied to find a DEMO difference
between Chinese and Danish investors (γ = .275, p = .119), although the
coefficient is positive and p -valve is small. DEMO the return criterion, the results
do not fully support H2a that DEMO investors give more weight to this
criterionthandoDanishinvestors(γ =.024, p = DEMO), but the coefficient is
positive. Hypothesis 2b predicts that Chinese angel investors place less empha-
sis on risk in selecting investment opportunities than DEMO Danish angel investors.
The results in Model 6 suggest that Chinese investors do, in fact, give less
weight to risk than do the DEMO angel investors (γ = −.234, p <.05), so H2b
DEMO receives support. Finally, for the relationship between the entrepre-
neurial team DEMO investors (H3a and H3b), Chinese investors give more weight
to DEMO (γ = .233, p < .1) and friends (γ = .368, p < .05) over strangers than
do Danish investors. Accordingly, both H3a and H3b receive support.
Following Hitt et al. (2000, DEMO ), we further have a robustness check
through comparing the weight DEMO criterion received from Chinese and
Danish investors, respectively. We test our DEMO through separate models
for China (Model 4) and Denmark (Model DEMO). The coefficients obtained in these

separate samples are compared using a z DEMO, the technique summarized by
Cohen and Cohen (1983 : 111) DEMO commonly applied in criterion comparisons
(Hitt et al., 2000, 2004 ). The results confirm that Chinese investors give less

Discussion
Contributions
This study makes several contributions to DEMO literature. First, as a theoretical contri-
bution, we develop a theoretical comparative institutional perspective to explain why
angel investors have different selection criteria DEMO different institutional environ-
ments. We underscore the importance of whether the institutional context is
relationship-based or rule-based in order to better understand entrepreneurial activities;DEMO
“[t]ransactions of all kinds” at all levels of the firm or individual “are rife with . . . social
connections” that have different amounts DEMO institutional support (Granovetter, 1985:
495–499). These different connections or ties can facilitate different trust levels via
norms of reciprocity and successful DEMO in networks. They accordingly
play a crucial and underappreciated role in fostering investments and entrepre-
neurial prosperity (Ahlstrom et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2013).
Second, we enrich the research on angel investors’ DEMO decision-making
policies. Our findings may help reconcile the discovery by previous research conducted
in different countries that angel investors’ behavior is slightly different in DEMO
countries and institutional contexts. This study suggests that the findings from numer-
ous single-country studies must be qualified by explicit comparisons and discussion
concerning DEMO enabling and constraining forces of the institutional framework. We also
show that national institutions can be conceptualized in a way that captures the critical
DEMO across countries, which then can be used to explain individual behavior
DEMO different contexts.
Third, for methodology contribution, the use of policy-capturing and the
HLM model enable us to empirically uncover the investor’s emphasis on
DEMO while making informal investment decisions. While most prior
research has been conducted in a single-country setting, we examine a larger
picture and contrast China and Denmark as two distinct institutional settings.
We conduct a between-country comparison DEMO order to explore the institutional
contexts of informal investment. Perhaps the strongest message of our study is
that given the same decision-making criteria we DEMO consider the context
within which individual investors are embedded. At the individual level, the
political and market pressures faced by angel investors might also be faced by
other economic actors such as top executives and entrepreneurs. DEMO individuals
making decisions are accordingly influenced by existing institutional realities.
Angel investors’ selection criteria 725
Future research on decision-making could adapt the DEMO model to identify
institutional influences at different levels.
Finally, in terms DEMO practical contributions, our findings can help policymakers
promote good entrepreneurship policies. DEMO reveal the shortfalls of relationship-
based institutions in constraining the scale and scope of transactions. Weak legal
protections and contract enforcement could make entrepreneurs DEMO investors become
overly embedded in strong tie relationships, especially in relationships DEMO start-
up teams. Policymakers might propose measures to help modify rule-based institutions
to extend the scale and scope of angel investors’ investment. Rule changes DEMO seek
to balance the expectations of global investors against those of local stakeholders, as
sought in corporate governance reforms in developing and newly developed economies
in recent years (Liu et al., 2013; Young et al., 2004). In addition, our findings can help
entrepreneurs understand investors’ DEMO criteria. According to many studies of
private investment, the rejection rates DEMO investment proposals are high (Mason &
Harrison, 1995). High DEMO rates prompt the need for better understanding of both
the processes and criteria that angel investors use to make their decisions. This study
seeks DEMO add the explanations to investors’ selection criteria.
Limitations and future research
Using a comparative institutional perspective, we examine how institutional context
influences angel investors’ business-project selection. One important finding is that
institutions have significant impacts on DEMO investors’ decision making. Compared with
Danish investors, Chinese angel investors give DEMO weight to their relationships with
start-up teams, and they tend to DEMO in new ventures that have family members or
friends in the start-up team, while Danish investors give more equal treatment to family
members, DEMO, and strangers. These findings are further supported by previous surveys
in DEMO GEM study, although GEM does not identify the significance of differences. DEMO
aggregated GEM 2007 adult population survey at the national level found that only 4.6 %
of Chinese angel investors would invest in a firm DEMO management is strangers, while
42 % would invest in family and DEMO % would invest in a friend. Meanwhile, in
Denmark, 17.1 % would invest in a stranger, 36.3 % in family, and 27.4 DEMO in a friend.
Our results also show that both Chinese and Danish investors tend to invest in opportunity
with lower risk, although Chinese investors tend to give less weight to risk. These findings
highlight the importance DEMO the selection criteria differences between China and Denmark.
However, do all DEMO these differences have alternative explanations beyond the variances
between relationship-based institutions and rule-based institutions?
A challenging explanation could come from the culture values. DEMO the
GLOBE culture survey does not identify the significant difference between China
and Denmark (see Table 2 for details), Hofstede’s(1991) culture DEMO suggest
that Chinese and Danish investors will be sharply different in the Individualism-
Collectivism dimension. The score for China is 20 (high collectivism) DEMO for
Denmark 74 (low collectivism) in the survey (it should DEMO noted that this survey was
largely taken about four decades ago). However, some scholars have recently argued
that China’s values emphasize a strong “inner self” under traditional Confucian culture.
It is possible that Chinese culture DEMO actually hold to a more radical individualism
than the many Western cultures (Herrmann-Pillath, 2010). If this is the case, research
726
Z. Ding et al.
utilizing cultural variables and new measures of DEMO should be revisited, particularly
in entrepreneurship where individual measures can play DEMO big role in the venture’s
outcome (Guthrie, 1998).
Others have added that a collectivism culture could move to individualism as a
consequence DEMO economic growth and modernization (Guthrie, 1998; Hamamura,
2012). DEMO addition, our result on control variable in Table 6 indicates that DEMO
angel investors give more weight to professional market intermediary to seek invest-
ment opportunities than do Danish investors. Chinese investors may explore widely to
DEMO a qualified business plan. We therefore do not adopt this alternative perspec-
tive, although previous research shows that collectivism could partially explain the
importance of strong ties in opportunity recognition within relationship-based institu-
tions (Ma et al., 2011).
This study has some limitations that can clearly encourage future research. First, we
have not directly measured either the tie strength or intensity in the relationships
between entrepreneurs and investors in our policy-capturing DEMO Future research
should examine the role of strong vs. weak ties in angel investors’ decision-making
policies along with the contribution of these ties to DEMO performance. Such
research could offer a detailed account of social relationships’ effects on new venture
investments.
Second, this study is the first to show the difference in investment selection criteria
between China and Denmark. However, do the differences between relationship-based
and rule-based institutions sufficiently explain this variance? Future research may
include additional emerging economies such as Asian and Latin American DEMO
as well as developed economies in the sample (Bruton et al., 2009). After controlling
for additional cultural variance, an extension of this study with other countries could
address generalizability concerns stemming from the use DEMO a two-country sample (cf.
Ahlstrom et al., 2014).
Third, DEMO have not identified the selection criteria applied by angel investors that are
different from those of formal VCs. Although the literature already shows different
DEMO criteria between angel investors and VCs (Feeney et al., 1999; DEMO,
Zacharakis, & Baron, 2003; Van Osnabrugge, 2000), little research has assigned
weights to institutional influences on the different criteria applied DEMO these two kinds
of important investors. While VC is usually invested after a new venture meets an angel
investor’s criteria and reaches the next DEMO, future research on VC should give
weight to angel investors’ selection DEMO in the VC investment process to fully
understand the complexities of investors’ decision making with regard to new ventures
(cf. Kenney et al., DEMO).
Conclusion
The investment decisions of angel investors are embedded in the institutional environ-
ment. To understand the influence of different institutional environments, we compare
angel investors’ selection criteria in China and Denmark from the comparative DEMO
tional perspective. Using a policy-capturing approach to understand the decision
criteria of angel investors in the two countries, we found that relationship-based
institutions more common in China, and rule-based institutions more common in
Angel investors’ selection criteria 727
Denmark, have different impacts on the angel investors’ selection criteria. Angel
investors in China are embedded within relationship-based institutions, and tend to
rely more on strong ties such as family and DEMO in the management team. They also
give risks less weight as compared with angel investors in Denmark, which operate
within more rule-based institutional contexts. As with VCs, angel investors modify
their decision criteria to fit the local institutional conditions. This adds to evidence
concerning the importance of local DEMO and institutional conditions in entrepreneur-
ship (Ahlstrom & Bruton, 2002) DEMO in sectors such as angel and venturing investing
that would seem to follow standard rules and procedures for its operation.
