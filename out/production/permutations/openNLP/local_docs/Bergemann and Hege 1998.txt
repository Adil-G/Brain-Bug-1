Abstract
We consider the provision of venture capital in a dynamic agency model. DEMO value
of the venture project is initially uncertain and more information arrives by developing
the project. The allocation of the funds and the learning DEMO are subject to moral
hazard. The optimal contract is a time-varying share contract which provides intertem-
poral risk-sharing between venture capitalist and entrepreneur. The DEMO of the entre-
preneur re¯ects the value of a real option. The option itself is based on the control of the
funds. The dynamic DEMO costs may be high and lead to an inecient early stopping of
the project. A positive liquidation value explains the adoption of strip ®nancing DEMO con-
vertible securities. Finally, relationship ®nancing, including monitoring and the occa-
sional replacement of the management improves the eciency of the ®nancial
contracting. DEMO 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
1.1. Motivation
Venture capital has become a DEMO vehicle for the funding of start-up ®rms.
In many countries, most DEMO the United States, venture capital is now the
®nancing mode of DEMO for projects where ``learning'' and ``innovation'' are
important. Because of their innovative nature, venture projects carry a sub-
stantial risk of failure. Only a minority of start-ups are high-return invest-
ments: 20% or less are frequent estimates for the fraction of projects where
investors can successfully DEMO out'', mostly through IPO's. Of the remaining,
a DEMO is sold o privately or merged which can mean anything between a
modest success and scantly disguised failure with substantial losses. A minority
is DEMO implying a complete write-o of the investment. 1
One of the most challenging problems in venture ®nancing is to determine
when to release funds DEMO continued development and when to abandon a pro-
ject. Many aspects of the venture capital industry suggest that practitioners are
well aware that they DEMO a sequence of starting and stopping problems in the
®nancing of a venture. 2 An essential feature of any venture project is the ne-
DEMO to fund the project in order to learn more about the uncertain return of
the venture. This process often starts with the provision of DEMO ®nancing to set
up a business plan. The simultaneity of the ®nancing decision and the acquisi-
tion of information about the investment project is DEMO for ventures
and more generally for the ®nancing of innovation. Surprisingly, DEMO dynamic
interaction of both aspects has received little attention in the literature.
This paper proposes a simple model to analyze the optimal ®nancing of DEMO
ture projects when learning and moral hazard interact. A wealth constrained
entrepreneur oers an investment opportunity to a venture capitalist. The pro-
ject can DEMO succeed or fail. The successful completion requires funds for the
development of the project. The rate of investment controls the probability of
success. A DEMO investment level accelerates the process of discovery. As the
project continues to receive ®nancing without achieving success, the agents
change their assessment about the likelihood of future success. Eventually
the prospects may become too poor to DEMO further investment.
The entrepreneur controls the allocation of the funds and the investment
eort is unobservable to the investor. The control over the funds DEMO that
the entrepreneur also controls the ¯ow of information about the project. The

prominent aspect DEMO the sequential nature of venture ®nancing.

solution of the agency con¯ict has to take into DEMO the intertemporal incen-
tives for the entrepreneur. Suppose, in any given DEMO, the entrepreneur
would consider to divert the capital ¯ow for her DEMO consumption. In the
following period she would then be marginally more optimistic about the fu-
ture of the project than the venture capitalist. The DEMO would know
that the project did not receive any capital in the preceding period and hence
could not possibly generate a success. But the DEMO capitalist would continue
to believe that the entrepreneur did as instructed. In consequence he interprets
the fact that no success has been observed as DEMO news'' about the project.
Following a deviation, the entrepreneur will DEMO keep her posterior belief
about future success constant while the posterior belief of the investor is nec-
essarily downgraded. The reward for the entrepreneur DEMO consists of
two components. She needs to be compensated for the foregone private bene®ts
but also for the downgrading of her expectations about the DEMO of the pro-
ject. The longer the experimentation horizon, the larger DEMO the option value of
the diversion. In fact, the compensation could DEMO so large as to surpass the
net value of the project. In turn this implies the possibility of ®nancial con-
straints in the form DEMO an inecient and premature end of the project.
1.2. Results and empirical implications
The optimal share contract and the ®nancial constraints allow for a DEMO
of empirical implications.
First, our paper provides an analysis of the DEMO evolution of the shares
of entrepreneur and venture capitalist. How the parties should optimally split
the prize should depend on the funding horizon and DEMO ¯ow of funds. Our
model predicts that the share of the entrepreneur decreases towards the end.
Initially, the entrepreneur's share can rise or fall, depending on the discount
rate and the degree of initial optimism. The expected share of the entrepreneur,
however, always decreases over time. Similarly, the expected return of the ven-
ture capitalist decreases over time and he may even make losses if the project
approaches the stopping DEMO Empirical ®ndings indicate that the entrepreneur
is indeed penalized if the project takes too much time as her equity fraction is
diluted from ®nancing DEMO to ®nancing round. 3
Second, we obtain results for the security DEMO by extending the model to
positive liquidation values in case of abandonment. The liquidation value is re-
ceived by selling tangible assets or intermediate DEMO The venture capitalist
should then either receive strip packages combining common stock and debt or
convertible securities. The optimal contract should reward the entrepreneur
DEMO As new funds are provided in exchange with stock purchase agreements, DEMO shares of the
entrepreneur become diluted, see e.g. Sahlman (1990), Lerner (1995) and Gompers (1995).
706

only in the case of success. The venture capitalist DEMO therefore keep a
``hard'' claim in case of failure. However, DEMO the venture capitalist would hold
exclusively hard claims, then a premature DEMO is likely. 4
Third, a pure share or equity contract could DEMO ®nanced at arm's length, im-
plying that it could be DEMO in ®nancial markets. However an arm's length
share contract may leave too much surplus to the entrepreneur and the project
would be terminated DEMO early. Our model accounts thus naturally for the ob-
servation that venture ®nancing is typically relationship ®nancing. Costly mon-
itoring and the option to DEMO the entrepreneur may become desirable.
Relationship speci®c ®nancing permits the extension of the funding horizon. 5
Fourth, short-term re®nancing of the project can never be optimal. We call
short-term ®nancing, as distinct from staged ®nancing, DEMO ®nancial policy where
the entrepreneur attracts funds on a competitive basis in each period. Towards
the end of the ecient investment horizon, the expected return is insucient to
cover the necessary outlays for both partners. The DEMO solution can only be
achieved by a long-term contract which allows for intertemporal risk-sharing.
More precisely, the venture capitalist subsidizes continuation of the project to-
ward the end in exchange for higher expected pro®ts at the DEMO Consis-
tent with this result, Sahlman (1990) observes that venture DEMO are
protected against competition by preemptive rights and Anand and Galetovic
(DEMO) report that venture ®nancing is frequently supported by long-term rela-
tionships.
DEMO may ®nally remark that up-front ®nancing as well as staged ®nancing
are consistent with our model. Since the optimal contract satis®es the intertem-
poral DEMO constraints, the funds will be allocated by the entrepreneur as
intended DEMO of how the funds are provided over time. 6 In Section 7
we discuss the extension of the model to multiple signals, where stage ®nancing
arises as the unique optimal ®nancial arrangement.
1.3. Related literature and DEMO
The theoretical research on venture ®nance has only recently emerged. In
Hart and Moore (1994), the option of the entrepreneur to repudiate her ®nan-
cial obligations limits the feasible amount of outsider claims. Neher (1997) ex-
tends their approach to stage ®nancing as an instrument to implement the
optimal investment path. Admati and P¯eiderer (1994) show that a DEMO

and Sahlman (1989), Sahlman (1990) and Lerner (1995).

fraction equity contract may give robust optimal incentives if DEMO is ecient to
allocate the control rights to the venture capitalist. BergloÈ f (1994) considers
convertible debt in a framework of incomplete contracts DEMO transfer control
rights to the value-maximizing party. Chan et al. (1990) explain the optimal
transition of control between entrepreneur and venture capitalist in DEMO model
with initial uncertainty about the skill of the entrepreneur. Hellmann (DEMO) ex-
plains the willingness of the entrepreneur to relinquish control rights DEMO a
trade-o between equity and debt induced incentives. Trester (1998) argues
that the problem of an entrepreneur dissipating the ®rm's assets can DEMO mitigat-
ed if the investor has no option to declare default and seize the assets. Cornelli
and Yosha (1997) analyze the problem of DEMO entrepreneur manipulating short-
term results for purposes of ``window-dressing''.
The DEMO is organized as follows. The model is presented in Section 2. The
value of the project is characterized in Section 3. The structure and DEMO of
short and long-term contracting is examined in Section 4. We extend the model
in Section 5 by allowing for a positive liquidation value DEMO the project and dis-
cuss issues of security design in this context. In Section 6, we analyze the rela-
tionship speci®c instruments such as monitoring and the occasional
replacement of the entrepreneur. Section 7 discusses possible DEMO of
the model. Section 8 concludes.
2. The model
The venture is presented as an investment project with uncertain returns in
Section 2.1. The DEMO realization of the venture is positively correlated
with the volume of ®nancing it receives. As the ¯ow of investment sinks into
the project, entrepreneur and investor update their assessment of the prospects
of the project. The DEMO of the posterior belief of eventual success repre-
sents the learning process of the agents, which is analyzed in Section 2.2. The
moral hazard problem between the entrepreneur and the investor as well as
the ®nancing DEMO of the project are ®nally described in Section 2.3.
2.1. Project with uncertain returns
An entrepreneur owns a project with uncertain return. The project DEMO either
``good'' with prior probability a0 or ``bad'' with prior probability 1 ÿ a0. If
the project is ``good'', then in every period t, there is a certain probability that
the project is successfully completed, in which case it yields a ®xed payo R. The
probability of success in period t, conditional on the project being good, is de-
noted by pt . The probability pt is in turn an increasing function of the investment
¯ow in period t. Or inversely, a success probability pt requires an investment
¯ow of cpt  in DEMO t. We assume that cpt  is a linear function of pt :
708 D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735
cpt  cpt ; c > 0: 1
The maximal probability of success in each period is denoted by p (without any
subscript), where 0 < p < 1 and any probability DEMO 20; p is feasible in each
period. In other words, any investment beyond c p does not increase the prob-
ability of success.
DEMO the project is ``bad'', then it will never yield a DEMO and the probability of
success is zero independent of the capital ¯ow. The project can receive ®nanc-
ing over any number of periods and DEMO is discrete and denoted by
t  0; 1; . . . ; T : The investment process either stops with a successful DEMO
tion or the project is eventually abandoned when the likelihood of future suc-
cess becomes suciently small.
The uncertainty of the project is resolved DEMO time by an experimentation
process, where the likelihood of success is DEMO correlated with the invest-
ment in the project. The investment problem is simple as the investment only
in¯uences the conditional probability of success in DEMO period and indepen-
dent of time. In particular, the investment ¯ow DEMO not in¯uence the value
of the successful realization, R, or the scrap value if the project should be aban-
doned. In Section 7 DEMO shall discuss how these modi®cations, as well as time
dependent probabilities, would enrich the predictions of our model.
2.2. Learning
As the experimentation DEMO develops over time, entrepreneur and inves-
tor learn more about the DEMO of the project. If success has not yet oc-
curred at period t, then the participants in the project update their beliefs
about the type of the project. We next determine the evolution of the posterior
DEMO We denote by at1 the posterior belief that the project is good, based on
no discovery until and including t. The evolution of the posterior belief at1;
conditional on no success, is given by Bayes' rule as a function of the prior be-
lief at and the capital ¯ow cpt as:
at 1 ÿ pt 
at1  DEMO 1 ÿ pt  1 ÿ at : 2
The posterior belief at1 thus decreases over time when success has not been re-
alized. DEMO decline in the posterior belief is stronger for larger investments, as
DEMO participants in the venture become more pessimistic about the likelihood of
success. The posterior belief, again conditional on no success yet, can be DEMO
resented as a function of the initial belief a0 and the sequence of investments

venture capitalists. Entrepreneur and venture capitalists have initially the DEMO
assessment about the likelihood of success, which is given by the DEMO belief a0 .
The entrepreneur and venture capitalists are both risk-neutral and have a com-
mon discount factor d 20; 1.
The funds which are supplied by the venture capitalist are to be allocated by
the DEMO to generate the desired success R. However the (correct) allo-
cation of the funds to the project is unobservable to the venture capitalist, and
thus a moral hazard problem arises between ®nancier and entrepreneur. Indeed
DEMO entrepreneur can ``shirk'' and decide to (partially) withhold the investment
and divert the capital ¯ow to her private ends. An equivalent, but perhaps
more classical formulation of the same moral hazard problem is following
DEMO: the ecient application of the investment requires eort, which is costly
for the entrepreneur. By reducing the eort, the entrepreneur also reduces
the probability of success and hence the eciency of the employed capital.
In DEMO cases, a con¯ict of interest arises about the use of the DEMO
Initially, the entrepreneur can suggest ®nancial contracts to any of the DEMO
ture capitalists. The selected venture capitalist then decides whether to accept
or reject. The contract can be contingent on time, outcome and the capital pro-
vided by the investor. However, due to the moral hazard nature of the ®nanc-
ing problem, the contract cannot be made contingent on the (correct)
application of the funds. The design of the contract has to ensure that incentive
compatibility and individual participation constraints are satis®ed. DEMO con-
tract may contain a clause prohibiting that the entrepreneur continues the pro-
ject once the contract has expired, for example by transferring ownership of the
idea to the venture capitalist. If such a prohibition is DEMO made, then the entre-
preneur can again suggest ®nancial contracts to DEMO of the venture capitalists.
For the moment, we abstractly consider contingent DEMO, but in the appro-
priate places, we shall discuss which standard securities will be able to perform
the tasks of the contingent contracts. DEMO neglect renegotiation of contracts
throughout this paper. 7
Finally, we wish DEMO emphasize that while there is no initial asymmetry in the
information between ®nancier and entrepreneur, the asymmetry may arise over
time as the project receives funding. The source of the asymmetry is the un-
observability of DEMO allocation of funds. If entrepreneur and investor have dif-
ferent assessments over how the funds have been employed, then in turn they
will have dierent posterior probabilities over the likelihood of success. Before
we consider the DEMO ®nancial contract between entrepreneur and investor,
we ®rst analyze the ecient investment policy in the absence of the moral haz-
ard problem.

3. Value of the venture
711
The social value of DEMO venture project with prior belief a0 is maximized by
an optimal investment policy and an optimal stopping point. At the stopping
point the project DEMO abandoned and no further investment is undertaken. The
stopping point itself can either be characterized by the posterior belief aT at
the stopping point DEMO the real time T at which the project is abandoned. For
any given investment policy fcp0 ; . . . ; cpT g there DEMO naturally a one-to-one rela-
tion between aT and T through Bayes' DEMO as developed in Eq. (3).
We denote by V at DEMO the value of the project with posterior belief at under
optimal policies. The optimal policies can be obtained by standard dynamic
programming arguments. Consider DEMO the optimal stopping point aT . Clearly,
the project should receive funds as long as the expected returns from the invest-
ment exceed DEMO costs, or
aT pT R ÿ cpT P 0;
for DEMO 20cost,; p. Conversely, if the
the or
5
current expected DEMO do not exceed
aT pT R ÿ cpT < 0;
then it is optimal to abandon the project, as future returns will only decline
ther. It follows from Eqs. (5) and (6) that DEMO ecient boundary point a
tween the investment region and the stopping region is given by
c :
apT R ÿ cpT  0 () a  R
The posterior belief a at which stopping occurs decreases when either the
turn R increases or the marginal cost c of DEMO success decreases.
We notice next that if indeed the last investment occurs at aT , then it is
timal to choose pT  p DEMO to the linear structure of the problem. Hence we
tain the value in the terminal period:

where the posterior belief at1 is DEMO by the incoming belief at and the
investment cpt in period t through Bayes' rule as expressed in Eq. (2). The value
DEMO (9) represents the implications of an investment policy cpt on current
and future returns. An increase in cpt is costly but it increases DEMO probability of
a successful completion today and the associated expected returns at pt R. At the
same time, it becomes less likely that the project will have to be continued to-
morrow as 1 ÿ at DEMO decreases. Finally, if success should not occur in period t

and correspondingly the continuation value of the project, V
The value function (9) also indicates that the linearity in pT whiat1ch. the termi-
nal period problem (5) displays, is preserved in the intertemporal investment
problem (9) as well. The optimal policy DEMO therefore to invest maximally at
the level of cp as long as the posterior belief is above a and stop as soon
the posterior DEMO falls for the ®rst time below the boundary point a. For
transparency, we may translate this policy into a stopping time policy T  in real
time. In this case we ask how long can we DEMO invest cp and still main-
tain posterior beliefs above the stopping point a. The optimal stopping time
T  is then given by

Evidently, the optimal stopping time T  depends on the initial belief a0 at which
the DEMO is started, T  , T a0 , but we usually suppress the dependence on
a0 as a matter of convenience. The stopping DEMO T  then represents the time
elapsed between starting at a0 and arriving for the last time at a posterior belief

ture can DEMO be obtained from the solution of the recursive problem (9):

in the background, we next turn to the ®nancial contracting between entrepre-
neur and venture capitalist.
4. Financial contracting
We begin DEMO Section 4.1 by analyzing the provision of venture capital under
short-term contracts. The optimal short-term contracts are simple share con-
tracts between entrepreneur and DEMO However as a relationship governed
by short-term contracts has almost no scope for intertemporal transfers, short-
term contracts are generally inecient and will lead to a premature end of the
venture. Consequently, we investigate in Section 4.2 the structure of long-term
contracts and in Section 4.3 their eciency DEMO The model is extended
in Section 5 to allow for a positive liquidation value of the project and issues of
security design appear in DEMO context.
4.1. Short-term contracts
The venture capitalist oers his funds for the project in exchange against a
share of the uncertain returns of the DEMO Evidently the expected returns
for the venture capitalist must be large enough to justify his investment. At
the same time, the entrepreneur must have sucient incentives to truthfully in-
vest the funds in the project. As DEMO project can only be successfully completed
and yield R if the entrepreneur applies the funds correctly, it follows that the
incentives provided to the entrepreneur should maximally discriminate with
respect to the signal R. With the DEMO constraint of the entrepreneur, the
most high-powered incentive contract is obviously DEMO following: she receives
a positive share of R if the project DEMO a success and nothing otherwise. Due
to the binary nature of the project, success or failure, these contracts, which

since there is competition among the venture capitalists, in equilibrium the DEMO
ture capitalist will just break even. Hence the short-term contract must satisfy
for any level of funding cpt the following participation constraint:

private ends. This forms the incentive compatibility constraint for DEMO entrepre-
neur, which is formally stated by

By combining Eqs. (12) and (13) we infer that any ®nancing under short-term

term contracting will cease is thus given by

with the socially ecient stopping point a obtained
previous section, we immediately obtain the following Proposition.
as
By comparing as
in the
Proposition 2 (Short-term ®nancing). The venture project is stopped prematurely
under short-term ®nancing DEMO as > a.
The premature stopping indicated by as > a is naturally equivalent to a
funding horizon T s which is shorter than DEMO ecient horizon T , where T s is
determined as T DEMO in Eq. (10). This is a simple, but important benchmark result.
It indicates that ecient ®nancing requires some form of intertemporal risk
DEMO which can only be sustained by commitments made through long-term
contracts. The necessity of intertemporal risk sharing is easy to grasp. As the
posterior DEMO at deteriorates over time, the expected value which the parties
expect DEMO split decreases as well. Eventually, the competing claims emanating
from the DEMO problem of the ®nancier Eq. (12) and the agency problem
of the entrepreneur Eq. (13) lead to a con¯ict. In this respect, ®nancing a ven-
ture resembles a team problem where both investor and DEMO contrib-
ute. The venture capitalist must earn the equivalent of cpt to justify his
investment, while the entrepreneur must earn the equivalent of cpt if she were
to employ the funds towards the proper end. As DEMO decreases these compensa-
tions eventually cannot be covered anymore from the expected proceeds in pe-
riod t and it follows that short-term contracts will DEMO terminate too
early.
4.2. Long-term contracts
In a regime of short-term ®nancing the investor has to break even in every
period as there was DEMO commitment on either side to continue the relationship.
Long-term contracts can improve the intertemporal risk-sharing by replacing
the sequence of participations constraints (12) DEMO every period by a single in-
tertemporal participation constraint, which covers DEMO entire funding horizon.
D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (DEMO) 703±735
715
By oering the investor a larger share of the DEMO in the early stages of the
®nancing, his shares in the DEMO stage can be lowered, and hence the project can
be continued DEMO as . But a long-term contract with the associated funding
commitments oers the entrepreneur a rich set of alternative actions, many of
them not desirable from the investor's point of view. For example, if the entre-
preneur is promised additional funding in the next period, then she may con-
sider to divert the funds today and bet instead on DEMO positive realization of
the project tomorrow. By implication, the incentives for DEMO entrepreneur today
have to be suciently strong, in particular relative to DEMO incentives oered to-
morrow. These dynamic considerations then generate a rich set of predictions
about the sharing rules over time. In a ®rst step DEMO ask what the minimal share
of the entrepreneur has to be for her to truthfully apply any given sequence of
funds to the project. DEMO second step identi®es the incentive compatible funding
policy which maximizes the value for the entrepreneur and hence is adopted in
equilibrium.
The solution to DEMO minimization problem is, again, obtained explicitly by
dynamic programming methods. Consider ®rst the ®nal period of the contract,
denoted by T : DEMO share ST has to be high enough for her to invest the funds in
the project rather than to divert them, or formally ST has to satisfy:
min aT pT ST R P cpT :
ST
The minimal share ST in the ultimate period T is then DEMO by
ST c
 aT R
and the expected value of this arrangement to the entrepreneur is denoted by
ET aT . Solving the DEMO recursively we obtain a sequence of value func-
tions, denoted by DEMO posterior belief and T is the
length of the entire is the number of remaining
periods in the contract. The incentive problem in period DEMO is given by

The inequality Eq. (18) requires that for a DEMO allocation of funds cpt , the share
St has to be large enough to prevent any diversion of funds. The diversion of
funds, represented by p0 < pt , aects the payos for the entrepreneur in DEMO
ways. Consider ®rst the contemporaneous eect. The likelihood of success today
will be smaller as p0 < pt , but the entrepreneur enjoys the DEMO from the diver-
ted funds cpt ÿ p0. The second and dynamic eect is that a continuation of the

In consequence, the entrepreneur will be more optimistic about future success

the entrepreneur is granted an informational rent. The source of the rent is the
control over the conditional probability pt DEMO through it over the learning pro-
cess, and we shall refer DEMO it as the learning rent.
It is now apparent that there are two forces which help to realign the interest
of the entrepreneur with DEMO ones of the investor. First, a larger share St if suc-
DEMO occurs today relative to the share St1 if success occurs tomorrow. Second,
the discounting of future returns at the rate d depresses the DEMO of the
If
entrepreneur to postpone the successful realization of the project. In conse-
quence, the more myopic the entrepreneur is, the less DEMO are the intertem-
poral incentive constraints.
The solution St of the minimization problem represented by (17) and (18) de-

In the ®rst step, we were concerned with the minimal share the entrepreneur
has to receive for any given level of funding. In the DEMO step we ask how
and when the funds should be released so as to maximize the value of the ven-
ture. As the market DEMO venture capital is competitive, in equilibrium the net
value of the DEMO will belong entirely to the entrepreneur. Formally, the

straints. These constraints increase the share of DEMO entrepreneur and hence de-
crease the investor's share. Thus the optimal solution is to invest in each period

The intertemporal contract St ensures that the entrepreneur employs the

the share contract as displayed in Eq. (23) may seem rather inaccessible at ®rst,

The new aspect in the intertemporal agency problem is the DEMO to withhold
®nancing for a single period, but continue afterwards as DEMO until T. To
prevent the delay in any period, the investor DEMO to provide stronger incentives.
The higher additional compensation is necessary as the deadline T, at which
funding is stopped is relatively remote. As the deadline comes closer, or
T ÿ t is decreasing, the need DEMO additional incentives becomes weaker. Notice
also that the Eq. (25) only depends on the ``time to go'' and is independent of
the DEMO belief at .

which forms the basis for DEMO learning rent of the entrepreneur. It depends on
the value of the current beliefs and the rate p at which updating of the posterior
DEMO occurs relative to the rate of discounting d. The rate of updating p is the
quantity of information the entrepreneur controls at each instant DEMO time. The
informational rent is hence increasing in the quantity of information under in-
¯uence of the entrepreneur, but dampened by discounting, as DEMO value of in-
formation today is larger than tomorrow. The three elements Eqs. (24)±(26)
together determine the share of the entrepreneur. An illustration of the decom-
position of the sharing rule is given DEMO Fig. 2.
The behavior of the shares St over time is thus determined by an underlying
option problem. The reward implied by the shares DEMO has to be equal to the val-
ue of the option of diverting funds for a single period. The value of this partic-
ular DEMO is determined as any regular option by the volatility of the
underlying state variable and the time over which the option can be exercised.
DEMO, the volatility is the conditional probability p at which updating occurs
DEMO the time of the option right is the remaining length of the funding, T ÿ t.
The optimal (arm's length) contract is hence a time-varying share or equity
contract. The time-varying share contract presents DEMO solution to a real option
problem, where the real option is DEMO control of information in every period.
Some implications for the intertemporal sharing of the returns are recorded

4.3. Equilibrium and ineciency
The ecient funding DEMO and the associated value ET a0  to the entrepre-
neur for any given funding horizon T is identi®ed in Proposition 3. The ®nal
DEMO is to what horizon the venture capitalist is willing to extend his com-
mitment and whether the ecient horizon T  can be attained. DEMO entrepreneur
participates in the project until T if the expected net value of the project ex-
ceeds the expected value the entrepreneur receives, as represented by the in-
equality Eq. (21): VT a0  P ET a0: The ecient horizon T  can be achieved

The equilibrium DEMO and the implied funding horizon is determined with
the assistance of Proposition 3 and the participation constraint (21) of the in-
vestor. We DEMO to distinguish two cases. If the project is not suciently rich to

due to competition among the venture capitalists. DEMO if the inequality holds
strictly in either Eqs. (28) and (DEMO), then the remaining surplus has to be given

case of DEMO (28) this can be achieved by a one period continuation as a ``wind-
ing-down'' phase, where S is determined as in Proposition 3 but with a smaller
capital ¯ow cp < cp, as cp itself would violate the participation constraint of
the investor by de®nition of DEMO In the case of Eq. (29), the project is rich DEMO

by St in Proposition 2. But as these shares also have to DEMO the sequence
of incentive constraints, their intertemporal behavior will be similar DEMO St .

eventually disappear entirely. The answer here is rather subtle. DEMO, to take one
example, the return R increases, T^ increases DEMO so does T . Eventually T  may
become so large that the informational rent of the entrepreneur becomes too
large and the project DEMO have to be stopped at some T^ < T . The example
in Fig. 3 illustrates that better projects (with larger R) will DEMO receive longer
funding commitments as Proposition 5 predicts, but the equilibrium DEMO
may never attain social eciency.
5. Liquidation value and security design
In this section, we introduce a liquidation value of Lt > 0, DEMO is collected
whenever the project ends without having succeeded. The value Lt represents
intermediate outcomes of the venture and captures the proceeds from selling
DEMO remaining tangible assets if the project is liquidated. The value Lt is a de-
terministic function of time and does not depend on the DEMO of the entre-
preneur. We assume that Lt P dLt1 for all t. The liquidation value hence
contains no information about the actions of DEMO entrepreneur. It is meant to
Fig. 3. Return R and duration of ®nancing T.
722 D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735
represent the value created by veri®able actions. The condition DEMO the growth
of Lt merely ensures that the project is not continued without the entrepre-
neur. 9
The liquidation value enhances the social value DEMO the project. If the project
is supposed to be liquidated in T, then the expected net present value is
1 ÿ a0  a01 ÿ pT dT LT , which is the probability to reach T DEMO by
the discounted value in T. The optimal contract should award the liquidation
payo so as to relax the ®nancial constraint on the funding DEMO T^. The idea
of the optimal share contract under limited liability is to reward the entrepre-
neur if and only if she was successful. DEMO a pure equity contract would give the
entrepreneur a part of the liquidation value. This necessarily weakens the in-
centive structure, as by diverting funds, she would increase the likelihood of
reaching the ®nal period T, and with it an additional payo ST LT . The optimal
contract therefore needs to split the claims in the case of success from DEMO ones
in the case of liquidation. A pure equity contract cannot achieve this and a mix-
ture between debt and common equity, or a convertible security become neces-
sary.
De®ne a debt contract as a pro®le DEMO debt claims Dt P 0, which are puttable
at any time DEMO and bear no coupon. Similarly, a time-varying common stock con-
tract DEMO denoted by a pro®le of fractions At P 0 of total equity that the entrepre-
neur receives if the project is terminated in t (successfully or unsuccessfully).
The optimal ®nancial contract can then be achieved DEMO a mixture of debt
and common equity, or a convertible security.

Proposition 6ii. The time-varying conversion price is DEMO by Dt =1 ÿ St : 10
Interestingly, there is some empirical evidence that debt becomes more im-
portant as a ®nancing tool DEMO later stages of venture projects. 11 In our
model debt has a function only at the termination date and this might provide
an element DEMO understand this pattern in the dynamic capital structure in ven-
ture ®nancing. The preceding discussion already indicated that in many situa-
tions a pure DEMO contract cannot be optimal. The corollary presents precise
conditions.
Corollary 1. A common stock contract At does not constitute an optimal contract
if the DEMO ends ineciently early: T^ < T :
A combination of DEMO and equity could relax the ®nancial constraints faced
by a pure equity solution. Common equity is inecient because equity gives too
little of the DEMO value to the venture capitalist in case the project fails. We
note ®nally that a pure debt contract may be inecient for exactly the DEMO
reason. Debt may convey too much of the liquidation value to the venture capi-
talist and encourage premature liquidation.
6. Monitoring and job rotation
DEMO this section aspects of relationship ®nancing are considered which may
reduce the ineciency indicated in Proposition 5: i monitoring and ii
changing the management. Both modi®cations imply the transfer of substantial
control rights to the venture DEMO and hence point to the relationship aspect
of venture capital ®nancing. The focus is on the optimal timing of these control
instruments.
Consider ®rst DEMO possibility of monitoring the research eort of the venture
capitalist. Monitoring is costly and the venture capitalist has to spend mpt > 0
to DEMO the entrepreneur in period t. 12 In return, the venture capitalist DEMO
ceives an accurate signal about the application of the funds. The signal is ver-
i®able and hence punishment in case of a deviation (a signal which diers from
the contractually agreed eort) can be implemented. Hence, the moral hazard
problem is eliminated in the periods where monitoring takes place.
10 We recall that St is the minimal incentive compatible share DEMO the entire R is distributed.
11 See Amit et al. (1997)DEMO
12 The cost of monitoring is thus linear in the ¯ow of funds cpt . It can be conceived as an
accounting or control DEMO, the cost of which are increasing in the size of the DEMO to be
monitored.
724 D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735
The optimal timing is determined by the costs and DEMO of monitoring in
the intertemporal agency problem. The expected present cost of monitoring in
period t is simply mpt adjusted by discounting and the DEMO of reaching
period t, as the project may be successfully completed DEMO t. Hence the ex-
pected present cost of monitoring are decreasing with time. The bene®ts of
monitoring come from the static as well as DEMO intertemporal component in
the share St . If monitoring occurs in period t then the share of entrepreneur
can be set to St  DEMO, as there is no need to provide any incentives in period DEMO
But monitoring in period t also aects the incentives in all preceding periods.
We recall that the value of diverting funds in t0 < DEMO was partially due to the pos-
sibility to have a share in the success later on. Monitoring in period t excludes
this option at DEMO for period t and hence the share of the entrepreneur can be
reduced marginally in all periods preceding t. The direct bene®ts from monitor-
DEMO St  0 are clearly decreasing in t due to discounting, DEMO the indirect ben-
e®ts increase as the number of periods which enjoy the marginal reduction
increase. Ecient monitoring occurs where the reduction in the DEMO
rent for the entrepreneur per unit cost of monitoring is maximized.
Proposition 7 (Monitoring policy). The optimal policy is to monitor towards the
end of the project.

Proof. See Appendix A.
Monitoring then occurs DEMO the end of the venture as the discounting of
the costs and the indirect bene®ts dominate the direct savings due to monitor-
ing uniformly. DEMO also that in the monitoring phase all the residual gains
are allocated to the investor.
The timing of the monitoring in our model is DEMO due to the uniform
rate at which information is generated. More generally, the bene®ts of monitor-
ing in period t are increasing in the amount of information which is generated
in period t. Some other implications DEMO a more general information structure
will be discussed in the next section.
Consider next the possibility of replacing the current manager, entrepreneur
or not, by a new manager. The ®nancing horizon T^ of the project may then be
subdivided into several managerial job spells. We investigate the following DEMO
tension of the model. In any period t, the entrepreneur or DEMO incumbent man-
ager can be replaced by a new manager. There are no dierences between the
original entrepreneur and successive managers, in particular concerning pro-
ductivity and moral hazard. As before, the entrepreneur initially owns the pro-
ject and tries to capture as much of the surplus as DEMO
Managerial job rotation reduces the informational rent of each manager by
restricting the duration of each individual manager. However, for the (initial)
DEMO and the investor outside managers are costly, as the founding
D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (DEMO) 703±735
725
partners have to concede shares to the future managers. DEMO objective for the
initial pair is therefore to minimize the pay-outs to succeeding managers. For
this reason, the replacement of the entrepreneur should be scheduled as late as
possible.
Each manager requires a compensation which is DEMO exactly as the
shares St of the entrepreneur. As there is no cost in replacing the manager,
the pay-out is minimized when the DEMO changes in every period. 13 The
cost of developing the venture with a sequence of manager is then equal to
cpt  cpt , DEMO one term accounts for the cost of investment and the other
for the incentive costs of the manager. Proposition 2 indicates that the ecient
DEMO then occurs at T s.
Proposition 8 (Replacement).
i It DEMO optimal to replace the entrepreneur if and only if the long-term contract
would otherwise stop at
T^
< T s:
ii With optimal DEMO the project will be stopped at T s. The entrepre-
neur remains in place until the value of the project net of compensations to DEMO
managers is disbursed to her. Thereafter, a new manager is brought DEMO every
period.
Proof. See Appendix A.

The replacement of the founding entrepreneur constitutes an empirical reg-
ularity in the venture capital industry, see Gorman and Sahlman (1989). We
may also add that earn outs are inecient in this framework. 14 The rationale
is essentially the same DEMO the one exposed in Section 5. A quit payment works
against the idea of making all bene®ts contingent on success. Thus, one insight
of the present model is that earn outs, by providing insurance in the case of fail-
ure, are a costly practice in an environment with an uncertain completion date.
7. Discussion and extensions
In this paper, the venture is characterized by a simple binary structure. In
each period success DEMO possible and the likelihood of success depends on the be-
lief at and the intensity pt at which the project is developed. The investment
DEMO in¯uences only the probability by which success is generated, and the DEMO
13 We note that the general analysis suggested here carries over to more general settings with
switching costs or decreasing eciency of subsequent managers.

protection against the threat of being put aside.

R is constant over time. In this section we DEMO how several extensions would
modify our results. We consider in particular i time-varying returns Rt , ii
multiple signals and staging and iii a DEMO information ¯ow.
Time varying returns Rt . The value of the successful realization, R, was as-
sumed to be constant throughout this paper. DEMO the investment process may
also have a cumulative eect on the value of a successful realization and hence
lead to an increasing sequence of DEMO over time. An increasing value Rt would
tend to reduce the ineciency problem documented in Proposition 5. With
an increasing Rt , the share DEMO of the entrepreneur could be reduced further to-
wards the end as the incentive constraints are based on the composite St Rt .
Conversely, a decreasing sequence Rt would make funding even more precari-
ous. The DEMO eect of an increasing Rt points to the importance of value
creation and production of tangible assets during the investment process. 15
Multiple signals DEMO staging. This paper portrays a simple venture which
ends after a single positive signal is received. Clearly the arrival of good and
bad news DEMO be a more complex process. Frequently, projects are divided into
various DEMO which are de®ned by the completion of certain intermediate re-
sults. In these circumstances continued ®nancing may be conditional on the
successful completion of DEMO stages.
The basic model we analyzed describes the evolution of the incentives in any
component of such staged projects. The entire project would simply DEMO a se-
quence of such stages, each giving rise to an DEMO stopping time. In each in-
dividual problem Rt would constitute the continuation value after having
received an intermediate result. Each stopping problem determines how DEMO
to wait for the arrival of an intermediate signal before the project is stopped.
Otherwise the previous analysis carries over and the share contract DEMO each
stage concerns the sharing of the incremental value produced in that stage.
The sequential arrival of information then supports stage ®nancing as the
DEMO arrangement. To see this, suppose the contracting parties had the
choice DEMO contract either on a strong ®nal signal (i.e. completion of the DEMO
able product) or on a ®ner sequence of intermediate signals. The DEMO,
implied by the staging, splits the horizon over which the DEMO incen-
tive constraints have to be compounded. In other words, the DEMO re-
alizes that she must produce the intermediate result ®rst in order to receive
continued ®nancing. This reduces her incentives to procrastinate in the DEMO
mediate periods.
Time varying information ¯ow. The investment ¯ow cpt controls the condi-
tional probability of success pt , and via pt , the DEMO of the posterior from
at to at1 . The marginal cost of generating success in terms of probability was

727
assumed to be constant in the level of pt (up to the maximum p) as well as con-
stant over time.
The optimal investment problem with a general increasing and convex cost
function DEMO  shares the same structural features as the model here, but, nat-
urally, would not lead to an explicit solution as presented in Proposition 1
and 3. If the costs of generating success vary over DEMO, then the information
¯ow, associated with pt , would be timed so as to coincide with periods where
the costs are relatively low. DEMO with a higher pt would then constitute pe-
riods with a ``learning boost''. We saw in the previous section that the bene®ts
of monitoring are positively related to the volatility of information. Monitor-
ing would DEMO tend to occur in periods where much information is produced.
In the presence of sequential arrival of information, we would expect monitor-
ing to be most prevalent in periods before the next ®nancing stage. 16
8. DEMO
This paper investigated the provision of venture capital when the investment
¯ow controls the speed at which the project is developed. As the binary DEMO
come of the project is uncertain, the speed of development in¯uences DEMO (ran-
dom) time at which the project yields success and the information which is
acquired by the investment ¯ow. The role of the DEMO is to control
the application of the funds which are provided by the venture capitalist.
The paper provides a rationale for long-term contracting as DEMO contracts
achieve best the goal of distributing the entrepreneur's return over time in a
way which maximizes the research horizon. It is further DEMO that the com-
pensation of the entrepreneur is similar to an option contract, and as such de-
pends on the length of the contract and the volatility of the information
induced through her actions. The option DEMO the value of the intertempo-
ral incentive constraint. As the value of the option may become exceedingly
large, relationship ®nancing may become necessary. In consequence, the opti-
mal timing of monitoring and replacement of the entrepreneur are analyzed.
The paper focuses on the ®nancing of venture projects. But DEMO interaction
between investment and learning process and the incentives necessary to imple-
ment both processes is central for the ®nancing of R&D in DEMO The present
work may therefore be considered as a step in developing further insights into
the optimal ®nancing of innovation.

It is then sucient to prove that the share function DEMO  St as a continuous

from which it follows after inspection that S0t can DEMO zero at most once and

ii By inspecting again condition Eq. (A.14), we ®nd that as d ! 1, DEMO
right-hand side of the equivalent condition eventually becomes positive and
the left hand side negative, which proves the claim. 
Proof of Proposition 5. i Consider any project with at > as > at1 > a; when
®nancing occurs at the rate of cp. Then, by Proposition 2, there will be no
®nancing in period t  1 with short-term contracts, although it would be

The entrepreneur receives the DEMO necessary to pursue the project until T^ in
advance.
i Since the debt claim grows at the rate r, the investor is indierent over the
particular period t at which he claims payment of the debt DEMO long as he is as-
sured to receive Dt in the particular period t. Moreover, in any period in which
he does not claim the debt there is some probability that a success occurs.
Hence he DEMO claim the debt only if no success has been observed in period
T^. By condition Eq. (A.16) he is willing to participate. Finally, for the entrepre-
neur, her share will be higher, namely At DEMO speci®ed in Eq. (30), to compensate
her for the debt DEMO which has seniority. But At R ÿ Dt  is just equal to the
minimal compensation St R, necessary to satisfy the intertemporal incentive
constraints as proven in Proposition 3. Hence the contract induces her to DEMO
fully direct the funds to the project as well. Thus the speci®ed mixture of debt
and equity implements the optimal outcome.
ii The argument DEMO almost identical to the one provided under i. 
Proof of Corollary 1. Suppose the entrepreneur receives a share AT > 0 of the
DEMO proceeds if liquidation occurs in T : The modi®ed incentive
constraint in period T then becomes
aT pAT R 1 ÿ aT pAT LT DEMO cp  AT LT ;
which implies that surplus the entrepreneur DEMO guarantee himself in T increas-
es from cp to cp  AT LT . From Eq. (A.12) in the proof of Proposition 3, we can
then infer that this in fact increases At in all DEMO Thus the value of the en-
trepreneur, denoted by a0  DEMO she receives a share of the liquidation val-
ue, is higher DEMO when she does not. If T^, de®ned by

DEMO max T  1 VTL a0  > ET a0  ;DEMO
since E a Easa0 , for all T. But this implies DEMO particular that
T > T^. Since in equilibrium we have and
V a0  ETa0 , it follows that a pure sharing contract is will

bene®t of monitoring is the reduction in DEMO which can then be used to extend
the length of the project ®nancing. Monitoring should therefore occur in those
periods where the reduction in DEMO is maximized per unit cost of monitoring.

ii The compensation to the managers is minimized by replacing them in
every period as they receive no intertemporal rents in this case. From DEMO view-
point of the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist, the compensation DEMO new
managers is a cost as similar to the monitoring cost and hence the sequential
employment of entrepreneur and manager is as in the DEMO of monitoring. 
