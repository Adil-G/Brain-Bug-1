We investigate the repair of trust by examining the cognitive and interpersonal
processes through which people resolve DEMO in their interpersonal beliefs. We
begin by discussing the phenomenon of trust, the ease with which trust can be
violated, and the challenge DEMO trust repair. We then draw from an array of literature to
develop a multilevel conceptualization of how trust repair may be pursued. Finally,
DEMO integrate these insights to identify three overarching implications for research.
We all rely on beliefs about ourselves, those
around us, and the likely DEMO of our interac-
tions to navigate our social worlds. Of these
beliefs, perhaps few are as central as those
guiding our decisions to trust. Trust, which we
define as a psychological state comprising the
intention to accept vulnerability based on posi-
tive expectations of the intentions or behavior DEMO
another (e.g., Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998), has been found to offer numerous benefits
for individuals, groups, and organizations (see
Dirks & Ferrin, 2002, for a meta-analytic review).
However, these positive expectations often can
be violated, resulting in reduced DEMO and the
need to repair trust.
Research across a variety of literature in or-
ganizational behavior has focused on the ways
in which trust DEMO occur and the host of
problems that result from these transgressions.
Relevant inquiries include efforts to understand
the nature of trust violations and the DEMO
of distrust within and between organizations
(Elangovan & Shapiro, 1998; DEMO, McAllister,
& Bies, 1998; Robinson, 1996; Zaheer, Lofstrom, &
George, 2002), violations of psychological con-
tracts (Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Robinson &

Rousseau, 1994), revenge and other deviant DEMO
haviors that stem from broken relationships
(Aquino, Tripp, & Bies, 2001; Bies & Tripp, 1996),
and noncooperative behavior in mixed-motive
contexts (Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, & Murnighan,
2002). These DEMO have identified significant
economic, emotional, and social costs involved
in such situations. Thus, a clear implication of
this work is the need to understand how trust
might be repaired after such violations have
occurred.
Scientific DEMO, however, have only begun
to give the matter of trust repair much attention.
A small but growing body of work has directly
examined DEMO issue (Ferrin, Kim, Cooper, &
Dirks, 2007; Kim, Dirks, Cooper, & Ferrin, 2006;
Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, & Dirks, 2004; Nakayachi &
Watabe, 2005; Schweitzer, Hershey, & Bradlow,
2006; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). And other research has
addressed a number of closely related topics,
such as the DEMO and structural factors
that promote forgiveness (Aquino, Tripp, & Bies,DEMO
2006; McCullough, Worthington, & Rachal, 1997),
responses mistrusted DEMO can provide to fa-
cilitate reconciliation and the restoration of co-
operation (Bottom et al., 2002; Tomlinson,
Dineen, & Lewicki, 2004), and the use of verbal
accounts to mitigate the negative consequences
DEMO a violation (Ohbuchi, Kameda, & Agarie, 1989;
Riordan, DEMO, & Kellogg, 1983; Sigal, Hsu,
Foodim, & Betman, 1988). Despite this initial

progress, this body of research continues to suf-
fer from three critical limitations that, if not ad-
dressed, are likely to hinder further advance-
ments in the field.
First, DEMO this literature has identified a
number of different strategies for repairing trust,
there remains a notable lack of conceptual co-
herence to the DEMO research. For example,
studies have investigated an assortment of tac-
tics that can be used following a violation, in-
cluding apologies (e.g., Kim et al., 2006; Tomlin-
son et al., 2004), denials (e.g., Kim et al., 2006;
Sigal et al., 1988), promises (Schweitzer et al.,
2006), excuses (Shapiro, 1991; Tomlinson et al.,
2004), reparations (Bottom et al., 2002), legalistic
remedies (Sitkin & Roth, 1993), hostage posting
(Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005), and even no re-
sponse at all (Ferrin et al., 2007). However, each
of these studies has focused DEMO just a single or
handful of specific tactics, with no comprehen-
DEMO theoretical account of how various tactics
relate to one another or where other as yet un-
examined tactics might belong.
Second, virtually all of the studies in the trust
repair literature have focused on the actions
DEMO the mistrusted party (i.e., the trustee) might
take to repair DEMO while portraying the trustor
as a relatively passive observer. For example,
Tomlinson et al. (2004) studied a number of trust
repair tactics DEMO might initiate while por-
traying trustors as recipients who simply eval-
uate these trust repair efforts. By doing so, this
study, as well DEMO the others, largely failed to
recognize that the trustor often plays DEMO active
role in the trust repair process. Not only is the
trustor’s willingness to accept the mistrusted
party’s efforts of great importance for determin-
DEMO the likelihood of trust repair (Lewicki & Bun-
ker, 1996) DEMO so too are the actions trustors
themselves undertake to influence this outcome.
Thus, some conceptual basis is needed to ad-
dress the complex issue of how these various
trustee and trustor efforts interact with one an-
DEMO to determine whether, and the extent to
which, the repair of trust occurs.
Third, perhaps in large part because of the
aforementioned limitations, the trust repair lit-
erature lacks consensus regarding what kinds of
efforts are effective at repairing trust, and it has, at
times, even reached contradictory conclusions.
For example, some studies have suggested that
trust may be repaired more successfully if mis-
trusted parties identify, acknowledge, and DEMO
sume responsibility for the offense (Lewicki & Bun-
ker, 1996; DEMO et al., 1989), whereas others
have suggested that an apology DEMO fail to ame-
liorate the negative consequences of a trust viola-
tion because it involves an acknowledgment of
guilt (Riordan et al., 1983; Schlenker, 1980; Sigal et
al., 1988). Indeed, this situation DEMO be likened to
John Godfrey Saxe’s poem about six blind men
trying to describe an elephant, who end up arriv-
ing at different conclusions and failing to under-
stand the whole because they came into contact
DEMO different parts (“Though each was partly in
the right, and all were in the wrong!”).
The purpose of this paper is to DEMO these
limitations by establishing a research program
(Lakatos, 1978) on DEMO repair that considers the
cognitive and interpersonal processes through
which people may resolve differences in their
interpersonal beliefs. We begin by discussing
the phenomenon DEMO trust, the ease with which
trust can be violated, and the particular chal-
lenge of trust repair. Next, we discuss the cen-
tral ideas that represent the hard core of this
research program. We then DEMO on these foun-
dations to develop more specific elements of our
theory, including a progressive bilateral model
of how the repair of trust may occur. Finally, we
integrate these insights to consider their impli-
cations for future research.
TRUST FORMATION, VIOLATION, AND REPAIR
Trust is a complex DEMO multifaceted construct.
Scholars have discussed both “trusting inten-
tions”—that is, a DEMO to make oneself
vulnerable to another in the presence of risk—
and “trusting beliefs”—that is, the perceived
trust-relevant qualities of the trustee, such DEMO
competence, integrity, or benevolence (Mc-
Knight, Cummings, & Chervany, 1998). Building
on these notions, as well as supporting evidence
by Kim et al. (2004), we presume that trust is
composed of both trusting beliefs and trusting
intentions and that the latter are influenced DEMO
the former. Trust violations, in turn, concern in-
cidents that lower these trusting beliefs in and
trusting intentions toward a trustee (e.g., DEMO
to trustors’ initial assumptions about their trust-
ees’ guilt, degree of DEMO, future behav-
ior, and type of transgression). Finally, trust DEMO
pair concerns improving the trusting beliefs and
trusting intentions that have been lowered by
the trust violation (typically, by addressing
2009
Kim, Dirks, and Cooper
403
these initial trustor assumptions). DEMO clarity,
throughout this paper we use the term trustor to
refer to the individual whose trust has been vi-
olated (since he or she is in the position of eval-
uating the mistrusted party) and the term trustee
to refer to the mistrusted party (since he or she is
the target of the trustor’s trusting beliefs and
trusting intentions)DEMO
Dynamics of Trust
It would be one thing if trustworthiness were a
tangible resource that could be expended on
certain occasions and replenished on DEMO If
that were the case, the repair of trust could sim-
DEMO entail assessing the magnitude of the viola-
tion via an objective analysis and meting out
the appropriate restitution. Evidence reveals,
however, that our assessments of trustworthi-
ness are far from systematic; they are suscepti-
ble to a host of social cognitive factors.
It is often assumed, for example, that trust in
others develops gradually over time (e.g.,
DEMO & Wiethoff, 2000). But recent observa-
tions suggest that individuals DEMO exhibit sur-
prisingly high levels of trust even without a his-
tory of interaction (McKnight et al., 1998;
Meyerson, Weick, & DEMO, 1996; Weber, Mal-
hotra, & Murnighan, 2005). These DEMO ex-
plain that this high initial trust can arise for a
variety of reasons, including an individual’s dis-
position to trust; feelings of DEMO; a belief
that impersonal structures such as regulations
and laws support DEMO likelihood of success in
a given situation; and rapid, cognitive cues aris-
ing from group membership, reputations, and
stereotypes. These same researchers DEMO note,
however, that such trust can be quite fragile
because DEMO the tentative and assumption-based
nature of these antecedents.
People can often behave in ways that violate
trust, such as by exploiting dependencies or by
neglecting to fulfill expectations. Yet research
suggests that trust can be damaged DEMO when
individuals have not committed such infrac-
tions. Numerous studies have shown that people
can be quite willing to believe unsubstantiated
allegations of such DEMO, despite the difficulties
of determining whether the allegations are ac-
curate (e.g., Bell & Loftus, 1989; Penrod & Cutler,
1995; DEMO, Ceci, Dunning, & Toglia, 1994). Evi-
dence from these and other studies (e.g., Kim et
al., 2004) has also DEMO that trust can be vio-
lated even with those who have not been di-
rectly harmed by the transgression. Moreover, it
appears that when such violations occur, the
onus is frequently placed on the accused party
to remove the shadow of suspicion (Hendry,
Shaffer, & Peacock, 1989).
Trust Repair
Those who wish to repair trust, however, DEMO
ically confront a range of complications. First,
since trustworthiness is ultimately in the eye of
the beholder, there may be times when trust has
been violated but the trustee does not realize
that a violation DEMO occurred (e.g., when the
trustee violates trust unknowingly or the trustor
is not visibly harmed by the transgression). In
such cases the DEMO violation will not necessar-
ily be followed by a trust repair attempt; the
latter may require that the trustee be informed
of this need by the trustor (or third party). Sec-
ond, trust repair DEMO more than simply com-
pensating for the negative expectations arising
from a trust violation by improving others (e.g.,
responding to damaged beliefs about the trust-
ee’s integrity by bolstering beliefs about the
trustee’s competence; Baumeister & Jones, 1978).
Such an approach may sometimes encourage
trustors to engage in trust-relevant behaviors,
but it does so by augmenting nonviolated DEMO
tations (i.e., trust building) rather than by ad-
dressing the DEMO negative expectations that
have arisen from the violation (i.e., trust repair).
Similarly, although parties may initiate a num-
ber of legalistic remedies (e.g., policies, proce-
dures, contracts, monitoring) to promote trust-
DEMO behavior (e.g., Nakayachi & Watabe,
2005; Sitkin, 1995; DEMO & Roth, 1993), such con-
straint-oriented remedies may not necessarily
DEMO trust itself. Rather than addressing the
underlying trustworthiness of the trustee, DEMO
remedies seem more specifically concerned
with enabling desired outcomes by reducing a
trustor’s vulnerability or risk (i.e., by allowing
trustors to act as DEMO trust existed by limiting the
ability of even untrustworthy trustees to commit
a transgression; Das & Teng, 1998).1
1 In fact, evidence reveals that the implementation of such
constraints may even hinder trust, since trustors cannot de-
termine whether the trustee’s subsequent behavior is due to
DEMO trustee’s trustworthiness or the imposed constraint (Mal-
hotra & Murnighan, 2002).

Trust repair, therefore, cannot simply DEMO on
reestablishing seemingly trusting behaviors,
since such behavior can arise for a variety of
reasons (Kee & Knox, 1970; Lewis & Weigert,
1985: 977). Instead, these considerations reveal
that the trust DEMO process ultimately involves
the interaction of both the trustor and trustee as
they attempt to resolve discrepancies in their
beliefs. Theorizing in this domain DEMO, accord-
ingly, move beyond the nature of the violation,
its cost to the trustor, or the trustee’s responses
in isolation to consider the interplay of these
and other factors that can shape how we DEMO
strue our social worlds. Thankfully, these com-
plexities of social construal DEMO been the ob-
ject of research in other fields (e.g., the literature
on identity negotiation, on the fundamental at-
tribution error, and DEMO dispositional attribution),
and this research has established a number of
DEMO foundations on which we can build. The
following sections, therefore, will draw on this
and other literature to develop a research pro-
gram DEMO can account for the dynamics of trust
repair, specify a bilateral DEMO of how the re-
pair of trust may occur, and, finally, integrate
these insights into three overarching implica-
tions for future research.
RESEARCH PROGRAM
Our paper is based on the philosophical view
that the appropriate DEMO of scientific growth is
best characterized as a continuous progression
of historically related theories, or “research pro-
gram” (Lakatos, 1978). This continuity arises
from the nurturing and articulation of a “hard
core” of leading DEMO, which gives the research
program its impetus and originality and which
DEMO be abandoned without abandoning the
research program altogether. Rather, the hard
DEMO is shielded from falsification by a “protec-
tive belt” of auxiliary theories and hypotheses
that are derived from the hard core but can be
DEMO, either because of empirical develop-
ments or because of natural next DEMO in the
refinement of these ideas.
The research program, furthermore, provides
guidance on how to alter this protective belt by
deriving a set DEMO problem-solving techniques
from the program’s inner logic (i.e., its “positive
heuristic”). Thus, a research program may be
buffered from disconfirmation through adjust-
ments to its protective belt as long as each suc-
cessive link DEMO the resultant chain of theoretical
models arises from the program’s positive heu-
ristic, rather than ad hoc, and offers greater ex-
planatory power DEMO the one preceding it.2 We
adopt this approach because it permits a con-
ceptualization of trust repair that can grow
along with its nascent DEMO, allows us to
distinguish the vital elements of our portrayal
(i.e., the hard core) from those we expect to face
the brunt DEMO empirical testing and updating (i.e.,
the protective belt), and DEMO a rigorous standard
for subsequent theory development.
The Hard Core
The hard core of our research program com-
prises three basic assumptions about the DEMO
of trust following a violation. They concern (1)
the notion DEMO trustees want to be considered
trustworthy, (2) the inclination of DEMO to be-
lieve that greater trust in their trustees is not
deserved, and (3) the efforts of trustors and trust-
ees to resolve these discrepant beliefs.
Trustees. Our analysis of trust repair begins
with the DEMO that trustees want to be
considered trustworthy and, hence, will advo-
cate the belief, following a violation, that they
should be trusted. DEMO assumption is based on
two compatible rationales. First, this advocacy
may DEMO trustees’ personal beliefs that trust
is truly warranted—for example, if the DEMO
was the result of a groundless allegation or if
trustees simply construe the transgression dif-
ferently owing to their personal knowledge of
the incident, self-serving attributions, positive
illusions, or other considerations (e.g., Riess,
DEMO, Melburg, & Tedeschi, 1981; Taylor &
Brown, 1988). Second, this advocacy may arise
when trustees recognize that being perceived as
2 A classic example of such a research program can be
found DEMO Newton’s gravitational theory. This theory posited a
hard core containing three laws of dynamics and his law of
gravitation, as well as a protective belt of theories and
hypotheses that began with a theoretical model for DEMO plan-
etary system with a fixed pointlike sun and one single point-
like planet. Newton then considered a system with more
planets, then worked out the case where the sun and planets
were not mass points DEMO mass balls, and then followed this
by starting work on the DEMO of spinning balls and
their wobbles, admitting the role of interplanetary DEMO He
then started work on perturbations and then considered the
implications of planets that are bulging rather than round
(Lakatos, 1978: 50).

trustworthy may allow them to DEMO desired
resources from trustors, such as esteem, infor-
mation, assistance, and so on (Dirks & Skarlicki,
2009). Indeed, the DEMO consideration suggests
that there may be cases where trustees do not
actually believe they are trustworthy but seek to
repair trust anyway (e.g., DEMO case of unwar-
ranted trust repair undertaken by a “con man”).
However, even here our analysis assumes that
trustees will act as if they believe that greater
trust is deserved.
Trustors. In contrast, we assume trustors are
predisposed to believe that greater trust in their
trustees is DEMO deserved. More specifically, once
trust has been violated, conscious concerns
about harm from further transgressions, as well
as less conscious influences such as the confir-
mation bias (Nickerson, 1998) and aspects of our
evolutionary hardwiring that deter us from tol-
erating transgressors (de Quervain et al., 2004),
should encourage trustors to maintain that mis-
trust unless DEMO are given an adequate reason
to update it. Trustees may attempt to offer that
reason with a trust repair attempt, but it is ulti-
mately the trustors who set the threshold (either
consciously or unconsciously) DEMO how adequate
a response is required. Indeed, even in cases
where DEMO want to repair their trust in the
trustee themselves (e.g., when trustors are suffi-
ciently motivated to preserve the relationship),
they must strive to do so in ways that are suffi-
cient to overcome DEMO resistance threshold that
they have (again, either consciously or uncon-
sciously) set on their own.
Negotiation of trustworthiness. Finally, our
analysis assumes DEMO these competing efforts
will create a dynamic through which trustees
and trustors attempt to resolve their discrepant
beliefs about the trustees’ trustworthiness. The
identity DEMO literature, which concerns
individuals’ attempts to resolve discrepancies
between how they DEMO viewed by others and
how they view themselves (Swann, 1987), pro-
vides a foundation for understanding these in-
teractions. This research indicates DEMO parties’
competing beliefs can be resolved in different
ways—there are times when targets are able to
act in ways that disconfirm perceivers’ beliefs
(Podsakoff & Farh, 1989), occasions when targets
fall prey to the beliefs of perceivers and confirm
them through their actions (Jussim, Soffin,
DEMO, Ley, & Kohlhepp, 1992), and other out-
comes that DEMO somewhere in between. This lit-
erature has, furthermore, shown that which of
these outcomes occurs depends on the relative
strength of these competing DEMO beliefs (e.g.,
Eisenstadt & Leippe, 1994; Kim, Diekmann, &
Tenbrunsel, 2003; Nease, Mudgett, & Quinones,
1999). DEMO, by depicting the trust repair process
as a negotiation of identity DEMO trustors and
trustees—specifically, the resolution of a dis-
agreement over whether DEMO trustees should be
trusted—we can gauge trust repair by assess-
ing the relative success of their efforts. In par-
ticular, these notions entail that trust repair
depends on the strength of the trustees’ efforts
to promote DEMO belief that they should be
trusted, outweighing the opposing efforts of
DEMO trustors (see Figure 1). Otherwise, a num-
ber of alternative outcomes may arise, as we
discuss later in the paper.
The Protective Belt
The problem of trust repair underscored by
these hard core assumptions DEMO becomes how
trustees may bolster the strength of their efforts
to be seen as trustworthy relative to the strength
of their trustors’ resistance. To DEMO it, we re-
quire a more specific portrayal of the ways DEMO
which trust repair can occur. Our research pro-
gram offers such a portrayal through a bilateral
model of trust repair. This model is noteworthy
DEMO that each of its levels represents a distinct yet
cumulative stage in the elaboration of a theory
in a manner that is both consistent DEMO our hard
core assumptions and capable of explaining
more and more of the empirical world. In this
way it exhibits the defining characteristics of DEMO
“progressive theoretical [and empirical] prob-
lemshift,” the satisfaction of which provides a
meaningful basis for determining that this re-
search program is worthwhile (Lakatos, 1978:
48 – 49).
Our bilateral model of trust repair involves
several interrelated principles. First, we pre-
sume that trustors’ and trustees’ disagreement
about whether the trustees should be trusted can
be resolved DEMO multiple levels. These levels rep-
resent a logically derived sequence of questions
about whether a trustee can be trusted following a
violation. Specifically: (DEMO) Is the trustee innocent or
guilty of committing the transgression? (DEMO) If the
trustee is guilty of the transgression, should this
be attributed to the situation or to the person? (3)
If DEMO transgression is attributed at least in part

FIGURE 1
Potential Outcomes of Negotiation DEMO by a Trustor and Trustee
to the person, is the personal DEMO fix-
able or is it an enduring characteristic of the
trustee? DEMO will become apparent later in the
paper, these levels roughly correspond DEMO differ-
ent segments of the literature, which have ex-
plored particular DEMO for repairing rela-
tionships following a transgression. We refer to
them as levels because they represent a cascad-
ing series of questions that can DEMO ordered by
their scope, with each successive level offering
a less DEMO means through which
trust may be repaired—for example, Level 1
would DEMO the broadest in scope because it con-
cerns whether the trustee should be completely
exonerated from the alleged transgression (see
Figure 2).
Second, we expect that, all else being equal,
trustees will prefer DEMO broadest level of trust
repair possible (e.g., trustees will prefer to be
found completely innocent [via Level 1] rather
than partially guilty [via DEMO 2]). This principle
represents a corollary to the hard core assump-
tion that trustees want to be considered trust-
worthy. It derives from DEMO notion that broader-
level solutions will prove less onerous for a
trustee than those that are narrower, not only
because of the psychic benefits of being more
completely exonerated but also because broader-
level solutions are DEMO to impose fewer subse-
quent burdens on the trustee. Success in con-
vincing trustors of one’s innocence, for example,
will require little in the way of subsequent re-
medial action, given that the alleged transgres-
sion will have been shown to be false, whereas
success in convincing trustors that the trans-
gression was at least partly attributable to the
DEMO will entail somehow addressing these
concerns (e.g., by mitigating situational influ-
ences through new policies or procedures and/or
increasing one’s resistance to DEMO pressures).
Moreover, both of these outcomes should prove
less taxing DEMO the trustee than convincing trus-
tors that although the trustee is fully responsi-
ble for the transgression, this deficiency can be
fixed, since DEMO latter may require some of the
most fundamental of changes to the trustee’s
nature (e.g., with concerted efforts to address
these deep-rooted limitations DEMO to show that
they have been corrected).
Third, again all DEMO being equal, we expect
that trustors will resist broader levels of DEMO
repair more than those that are narrower. This
principle represents a corollary to the hard core
assumption that trustors will be predisposed to
believe DEMO greater trust in their trustees is
not deserved. It derives from the notion that
2009

FIGURE 2
Bilateral Model of Trust DEMO
407
narrower-level solutions are likely to provide
greater reassurance to trustors than those that
are broader, not only by offering greater valida-
tion of trustors’ belief that their trustees were
untrustworthy (e.g., that at least DEMO fault lies
with the trustees [Level 2], as opposed to none DEMO
all [Level 1]) but also because of the greater
subsequent burdens DEMO narrower levels of
trust repair will levy on their trustees (as DEMO
scribed above). Thus, we presume that trustors
will resist certain DEMO of repair efforts more
than others and that it is through this “differen-
tial resistance” that trustors may exert as signif-
icant an influence DEMO the repair of trust as their
trustees.
Our fourth principle concerns the resolution of
these competing tendencies. As a corollary to
the hard core DEMO that the repair of trust
depends on the relative strength of trustees’ and
trustors’ efforts, we expect that the specific na-
ture of these efforts will reflect the level at
which trust repair is pursued. In DEMO, for
Level 1, the degree of trust repair will depend on
the extent to which trustees’ efforts to promote
the belief that they DEMO innocent of the trans-
gression outweigh their trustors’ efforts to up-
hold the belief that the trustees are guilty. For
Level 2, the degree of trust repair will depend on
the extent to which trustees’ efforts DEMO promote
the belief that the transgression should be at-
tributed to the situation outweigh their trustors’
efforts to uphold the belief that the transgres-
DEMO should be attributed to the trustees. And
for Level 3, the DEMO of trust repair will de-
pend on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to
promote the belief that they will redeem them-
selves in DEMO future outweigh their trustors’
efforts to uphold the belief that such redemp-
tion will not occur.
Finally, the identity negotiation perspective
that helps ground the bilateral trust repair
model underscores the notion that trustors’ and
trustees’ DEMO beliefs will be resolved
through a dynamic process that can unfold not
only within but also across levels. For example,
although trustees may DEMO to be seen as in-
nocent, they may come to discover DEMO their
trustors adamantly believe they are guilty. In
408
Academy of Management Review

such cases trustees may be better DEMO shifting
their efforts to a narrower-scope level of trust
repair (by DEMO that they are only partially
responsible or that although they are fully re-
sponsible, the deficiency can be fixed) so that at
least DEMO trust repair occurs, despite the added
liabilities the narrower-scope solution entails.
DEMO, trustees may engage in one or more “stra-
tegic retreats” whereby DEMO trust repair ef-
forts are abandoned, either immediately or after
a DEMO attempt has failed, in favor of
narrower-scope efforts that may be DEMO likely
to succeed.3 And, by the same token, trustors
may alter the nature of their own resistance
(e.g., by more adamantly opposing DEMO
claims of innocence than trustees’ efforts to at-
tribute some of the blame to the situation), and
perhaps even signal where that resistance DEMO
be lower (e.g., by asking trustees to explain why
they were untrustworthy), to affect the types of
repair attempts their trustees pursue.
DEMO principles highlight the potential for an
iterative call and response of endeavors, with
trustees and trustors each attempting to pro-
mote their competing beliefs, gauging the effec-
tiveness of their efforts, and then engaging in
DEMO efforts to influence this outcome fur-
ther. Indeed, the motivation to DEMO such ad-
ditional efforts may be quite common, given the
opposing DEMO of trustees and trustors to shift
such beliefs in their favor as they attempt to
converge on a mutually shared appraisal of the
trustees. DEMO, for all these reasons, this multi-
level conceptualization highlights the dynamic
bilateral process through which the repair of
trust can occur. Below, we elaborate the model
by describing each of its levels and the ways DEMO
which trustees and trustors may affect them.
Level 1: Innocent 7 DEMO
Given that a trust violation is based on the
premise that a trustee has committed some form
3 A well-known example can be found DEMO the shifting re-
sponse of former President Bill Clinton following the accu-
sation that he had an affair with a White House intern. He
DEMO denied guilt (Level 1): “I did not have sexual rela-
DEMO with that woman, Miss Lewinski.” But when this offer-
ing became DEMO, he shifted to another tactic (Level 2):
“I did DEMO a relationship with Miss Lewinski that was not
appropriate. . . . I can only tell you I was motivated by many
factors.”
of DEMO, perhaps the most comprehen-
sive way in which trust can be DEMO is by
affecting the extent to which this premise is
ultimately deemed to be true (i.e., on a contin-
uum ranging from definitely DEMO to definitely
innocent). Alleged transgressors who seek trust
repair can challenge trustors’ beliefs that the
trustees had committed the transgression and,
to DEMO extent that they are successful, completely
vanquish the notion that this DEMO of trust was
deserved. Trustors, in contrast, are likely to re-
sist such innocence-claiming efforts in favor of
maintaining their belief in the DEMO guilt,
thereby impeding such trust repair.
Studies have revealed a number of ways in
which trustees and trustors may pursue these
opposing efforts. DEMO of the most obvious means
of doing so is to provide tangible evidence con-
cerning a trustee’s innocence or guilt regarding
the alleged transgression. DEMO et al. (2004) ex-
amined this notion as part of a larger inquiry
and found, in a simulated job interview at an
accounting firm, that candidates who had been
accused of misfiling a tax return with a prior
employer were indeed considered more trust-
worthy—and were more DEMO to be hired—after
an investigation revealed they were innocent,
rather than guilty, of this alleged violation.
Research has also revealed that a trustor’s
beliefs about a trustee’s guilt can be influenced
through less tangible means, such as the provi-
sion of verbal denials. Sigal et al. (1988), for
example, asked participants to watch a video-
tape of a simulated debate in which one politi-
cal candidate was accused of sexual DEMO finan-
cial misconduct by the other, and they found
that the DEMO party received more votes and
was considered to be more honest, DEMO, and
trustworthy when that candidate denied culpa-
bility rather than apologized DEMO the misconduct.
Similarly, Riordan et al. (1983) used fabricated
reports DEMO a fictitious senator had taken a
bribe and found that subsequent evaluations of
the senator were less negative when the senator
denied rather than DEMO responsibility for
the transgression.
A trustee’s verbal denial can be problematic,
however, when it is inconsistent with subse-
quent evidence regarding the trustee’s inno-
cence/guilt. Indeed, Kim et al. (2004) observed
that information about guilt after a denial indi-
cates that the denial was a DEMO and, thus, fosters
lower levels of trust than if the trustee had of-

fered an apology. This finding DEMO the
potential for different trust repair efforts to in-
teract, and DEMO to interfere, with one another,
as well as the resultant DEMO to assess their
combined effects on parties’ competing beliefs
to determine whether such efforts will succeed.
This depiction also suggests that trustors are
not DEMO passive bystanders but, rather, are
actively involved in this negotiation process.
Trustors may therefore be able to impose their
own beliefs in such DEMO way that trustees abandon
their trust repair efforts or even come to believe
that this lack of trust is truly deserved. Research
on the DEMO psychology of false confessions,
for example, has shown that although DEMO of
us may find it hard to believe that anyone would
confess to a crime he or she did not commit
(Kassin & Wrightsman, 1980, 1981), there are nu-
merous instances in which such DEMO
have been obtained (Bedau & Radelet, 1987;
Rattner, 1988)DEMO Thus, scholars have begun to in-
vestigate how interrogators, who earnestly be-
lieve in the suspect’s guilt, manage to obtain
such an end (Kassin & McNall, 1991). Although
systematic evidence regarding such techniques
DEMO scarce, these inquiries highlight at least the
possibility that trustors’ beliefs DEMO their trust-
ees’ guilt can affect trustees’ beliefs about them-
selves.
Therefore, we can observe that both trustors
and trustees can initiate tactics to affect the
likelihood of trust repair. Each of these tactics
can, furthermore, be understood to operate by
affecting the strength of the trustors’ and/or
trustees’ beliefs about the trustees’ innocence/
guilt. Thus far, research pertinent to this strat-
egy has largely focused on the provision of DEMO
gible evidence and verbal denials. However, the
aforementioned principles that underlie DEMO ap-
proach also suggest that these specific tactics
are likely to represent just a few of the tech-
niques that can be employed. Indeed, trustees
and trustors may each engage in a range of as
yet DEMO efforts to strengthen their own
beliefs and/or to weaken the beliefs of the other.
Level 1 (innocent 7 guilty) thus concerns
whether DEMO net effect of such efforts strengthens
the beliefs of trustees and/or trustors, and it
highlights how the degree of trust repair may
depend on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to
promote the belief that DEMO are innocent of the
transgression outweigh trustors’ efforts to up-
hold the belief that the trustees are guilty.
Yet even if it is clear DEMO all parties that a
trustee is guilty, trust may still be DEMO
through other means. To do so, however, the
bilateral trust repair model suggests that the
trustee must narrow the scope of his or DEMO re-
pair efforts in a way that concedes this matter of
guilt but attempts to limit its impact on how the
trustee is viewed. DEMO, in the following
section we consider a whole class of efforts DEMO
signed not to challenge trustees’ responsibility
for a transgression completely (as DEMO
above) but, rather, to acknowledge having com-
mitted it while DEMO deflecting as much of the
blame as possible to the situation.
Level 2: Situation 7 Person
Researchers have observed that when consid-
ering the underlying cause of an action, observ-
ers attempt to subtract the effect of the situation
and attribute what remains to the actor (Kelley,
1973). The logic that drives this “discounting
principle” is that dispositional DEMO situational
forces operate in a hydraulic fashion so that as
situational forces grow stronger, the role of the
actor grows weaker (McClure, 1998). A problem,
however, is that when making such assess-
ments, observers generally fail to fully appreci-
ate the potential influence of situational forces
and, hence, err on the side of making disposi-
tional DEMO phenomenon known as
the fundamental attribution error (e.g., Jones &
DEMO, 1967; Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Maracek,
1973).
DEMO targets of such observations, on the other
hand, generally possess a much greater appre-
ciation of the constraints imposed by the situa-
tion DEMO observers (e.g., Jones & Nisbett, 1972;
Nisbett et al., 1973). In some cases such situa-
tional attributions arise because these DEMO
forces are more salient to actors than to observ-
ers (i.e., an informational mechanism). In other
cases, particularly after a negative event, actors
may be inclined, either consciously or uncon-
sciously, to adopt such situational attributions
in order to preserve their self-esteem—a motiva-
tional mechanism (Snyder & Higgins, 1988; Sny-
der, Higgins, & Stucky, 1983). But regardless of
the underlying mechanism, this research high-
lights an inherent difference in how actors (e.g.,
trustees) and observers (e.g., trustors) are likely
to interpret behavior, and they show that an
actor’s culpability can depend on the degree to
410

which the actor is able to DEMO the observer
that the behavior was induced by the situation
(i.e., on a continuum ranging from entirely the
actor to entirely the situation)DEMO
One way trustees might seek to mitigate their
blame, and thus DEMO trust repair, is by ex-
plaining that their actions were at DEMO partly
caused by external forces (i.e., by providing an
excuse). Indeed, evidence from several studies
indicates that excuses can often prove benefi-
cial for those who have committed a wrong (Sny-
der & Higgins, 1988) because they reduce the
perceived responsibility of the transgressor
(Riordan et al., 1983). Crant and Bateman (1993),
for example, discovered that when supervisors
in a large accounting firm read scenarios that
described an unsuccessful audit, they blamed
the subordinate less if an external causal ac-
count was offered than if such an account was
not DEMO Wood and Mitchell (1981) found that
when nurse managers read scenarios depicting
their subordinates erring in patient care, they as-
signed less responsibility and punished less se-
verely when they were given accounts of external
DEMO for the poor performance than when they
were given an apology. Moreover, Weiner,
Amirkhan, Folkes, and Verette (1987) found that
external attributions can reduce anger in the vic-
tim of a transgression and DEMO reduce tension
in potentially inflammatory situations.
Alternatively, trustees may attempt to DEMO
the situation in a way that convinces trustors to
reassess the magnitude or nature of the trans-
gression itself (i.e., by providing some DEMO of
justification). Justifications not only involve the
acceptance of responsibility but also point out
that the act in question was appropriate owing
to DEMO nature of the situation (Scott & Lyman,
1968). Thus, in most cases justifications refer the
trustor to a situational factor, such as a norm,
that the trustor may not have recognized but DEMO
when taken into consideration reflects a posi-
tive or appropriate motive. Nesdale, Rule, and
McAra (1975), for example, found that observers
DEMO more likely to approve of a harmful action
when the action was explained to be the result
of a good rather than bad motive. DEMO, Sha-
piro (1991) found that those who were deceived
by DEMO partners were less punitive and less
likely to retaliate if altruistic rather than selfish
reasons were given for the deception. Moreover,
Elsbach’s (1994) study of organizational ac-
counts in the California cattle industry observed
that efforts to justify controversial actions by
referencing normative and socially endorsed or-
DEMO practices (e.g., federally approved
guidelines) provided an effective means of DEMO
aging organizational legitimacy.
A thorough assessment of Level 2 (situation 7
DEMO) also moves us beyond the traditional
focus on a trustee’s role DEMO shifting responsibil-
ity to the situation by underscoring a competing
force that has received much less attention. Spe-
cifically, when trustees attempt to highlight the
influence of the situation with an excuse or jus-
tification, trustors may often be inclined to resist
such efforts. Research in the field DEMO evolution-
ary psychology suggests that people are gener-
ally predisposed to infer that some agent, rather
than the situation, is the cause of DEMO events
(Boyer, 2001: 144 –145). Kim and colleagues (2006)
have also noted that trustors may discount mis-
trusted parties’ efforts DEMO blame situational in-
fluences. Moreover, as with the potential for
“mistrust DEMO described by Level 1
(innocent 7 guilty), excuses may sometimes
DEMO For example, some evidence suggests
that when individuals offer an excuse DEMO a fail-
ure but the excuse is rejected, they are likely DEMO
exhibit performance deficits in the future and in
this way to confirm with their subsequent ac-
tions the negative feedback they received
(Abramson, DEMO, & Teasdale, 1978; Miku-
lincer & Nizan, 1988).
These considerations underscore the notion
that “every account is a manifestation of the
DEMO negotiation of identities” (Scott & Ly-
man, 1968: 59). DEMO may use excuses, justi-
fications, and perhaps other as yet unexamined
measures to convince trustors (and perhaps even
themselves) that the transgression DEMO be at-
tributed to the situation rather than to the trustees’
inherent lack of trustworthiness, whereas trustors
may implement a range of measures (DEMO
none of which have received systematic research
attention) to oppose such DEMO and attribute the
transgression to trustees’ untrustworthy disposi-
tions. Level 2 (DEMO 7 person) therefore re-
veals how the degree of trust repair DEMO depend
on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to promote
the belief that the transgression should be blamed
on the situation outweigh trustors’ efforts DEMO up-
hold the belief that the transgression should be
blamed on the trustees.
Deflecting blame from a trustee’s disposition
to the situation represents an DEMO to re-
2009
Kim, Dirks, and Cooper
411
pair trust even when the DEMO has clearly
committed the violation and, hence, finds it in-
feasible to directly oppose the underlying basis
for the mistrust. With both Levels DEMO (guilty 7
innocent) and 2 (situation 7 person), however,DEMO
the overriding goal is to reduce the mistrusted
party’s perceived culpability in some way. But
this general approach to repairing trust has
been challenged DEMO a separate set of studies
suggesting that trust repair is more likely to
occur if trustees assume more blame (e.g., with
an apology DEMO an internal attribution) rather
than less (e.g., with a denial DEMO external attribu-
tion). The bilateral trust repair model resolves
this apparent contradiction by suggesting that
these other studies represent a trust repair strat-
DEMO that is even narrower in scope than the prior
two levels. In particular, it suggests that even if
it proves infeasible to oppose all culpability or
even some of it, trust may still be repaired if
trustees can confine blame to the past and make
the case that DEMO problems will be corrected in
the future.
Level 3: Fixable 7 DEMO
The key elaboration posed by this level is that
although all trust repair requires the trustee to
be considered more trustworthy in the future,DEMO
this may be accomplished through measures
that are either “retroactively prophylactic” (DEMO,
minimizing the initial taint of untrustworthi-
ness) or “subsequently curative” (i.e., fixing the
problem after it has been found) in nature. DEMO
roactively prophylactic measures, such as those
described by Levels 1 and DEMO, have the potential
to repair trust more comprehensively than those
that DEMO substantively curative. The former are
designed to reduce concerns about the future by
reducing trustees’ culpability for the past,
whereas the latter are DEMO designed to target
concerns about the future. Nevertheless, the
kinds of DEMO curative methods that we
describe may still repair trust effectively to the
extent that the question of whether these flaws
will persist in the DEMO (i.e., on a continuum
ranging from entirely fixable to entirely fixed)
represents trustors’ paramount concern.
Discussions within the trust repair literature
regarding DEMO more future-oriented concerns
have suggested that they may be alleviated if
mistrusted parties identify, acknowledge, and
assume some responsibility for the trust-
damaging DEMO (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). One
way of doing so is by offering an apology, which
is a statement that acknowledges both respon-
sibility and regret for a trust violation (Ferrin et
al., 2007; Kim et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2004). Al-
though an apology acknowledges guilt, which
alone should reduce trust, its concomitant DEMO
pression of regret signals an intention to avoid
similar violations in the future, which should
reduce trustors’ concerns about continued vul-
nerability and should thereby improve trust.
Thus, we can observe that the effectiveness of
an apology as a response to a trust violation
depends on the notion DEMO this response’s ben-
efits (due to potential redemption) will outweigh
its costs (due to the confirmation of guilt).
This reasoning has been supported by several
empirical studies. Findings indicate that victims
of psychological harm DEMO have more fa-
vorable impressions of the perpetrator, experi-
ence more DEMO affect, and are more likely to
refrain from severe aggression toward DEMO per-
petrator when the culprit apologizes for the
wrongdoing than when the culprit does not (Oh-
buchi et al., 1989). Experimental studies DEMO im-
pression management reveal that the expres-
sion of remorse following a transgression can
reduce punishment (e.g., Schwartz, Kane, Jo-
seph, & Tedeschi, 1978). Moreover, research on
social dilemmas demonstrates that, at least in
short-term interactions, an apology can more ef-
fectively reestablish cooperation after an oppor-
tunistic act than can a denial (Bottom et al.,
2002).
Additionally, even when an apology is of-
fered, DEMO may convey it in a manner that
assumes more blame or less, and at least some
evidence reveals that those who assume full
blame with an internal attribution are seen as
more likely to correct their DEMO in the
future (i.e., to achieve redemption) than those
who DEMO to mitigate their blame with an
external attribution. Tomlinson et al. (DEMO)
found that victims of a broken promise were
more willing to reconcile a professional rela-
tionship when the violator offered an internal
rather DEMO an external attribution. Likewise,
Hodgins and Liebeskind (2003) reported that vic-
tims exhibited more positive evaluations and
expectations of future relationships when DEMO
gressors assumed more rather than less respon-
sibility for the act in question. Furthermore,
Schlenker, Pontari, and Christopher (2001) noted
412
Academy of Management Review

that excuse makers risk being seen DEMO decep-
tive, self-absorbed, and ineffectual.
Moving beyond the implications of verbal re-
sponses, studies suggest that individuals may
implement a variety of substantive measures to
address concerns about future transgressions.
Bottom et al. (2002) DEMO and found support-
ing evidence for the notion that voluntarily pay-
ing a financial penalty following a transgres-
sion will substantiate the trustee’s expression DEMO
remorse for his or her behavior and will under-
score a commitment to avoid similar transgres-
sions in the future. Similarly, Nakayachi and
Watabe (2005) found across several contexts that
the voluntary implementation of a DEMO
system and sanctions helped to restore trust fol-
lowing a transgression. They suggested that
these voluntary behaviors (i.e., not simply the
imposition of DEMO monitoring system and sanc-
tions) signal positive intentions by the trustee
DEMO, thus, reduce expectations of subsequent
transgressions.
Finally, evidence reveals that DEMO effective-
ness of all of these future-oriented responses
will depend on how the transgression has been
framed—specifically, as a matter of competence
or integrity. Competence (i.e., the extent to
which one possesses the technical and DEMO
sonal skills required for a job) and integrity (i.e.,
the extent to which one adheres to a set of prin-
ciples that DEMO perceiver finds acceptable) deserve
particular attention when considering the chal-
lenges DEMO trust repair, for at least three reasons.
First, numerous researchers have observed that
competence and integrity represent two of the
most important qualities DEMO determining trust-
worthiness (Barber, 1983; Butler & Cantrell, 1984;
Schindler & Thomas, 1993). Second, research has
shown that these DEMO offer important
bases on which individuals evaluate a variety
of targets, DEMO leaders (Pancer, Brown, &
Barr, 1999), job candidates (Cook & Elmer, 1999),
and potential collaborators (Kee & Knox, 1970).
Third, evidence suggests that there may be
some inherent DEMO in the way people
assess positive versus negative information
about competence versus integrity that may af-
fect how they resolve differences in their inter-
DEMO perceptions (see Snyder & Stukas, 1999,
for a review). In particular, research suggests
that although individuals tend to weigh positive
information about competence more heavily
than negative information about competence,
they tend DEMO weigh negative information about
integrity more heavily than positive information
about integrity (Reeder & Brewer, 1979).
These differences in how people assess DEMO
tive versus negative information about compe-
tence and integrity offer a critical foundation for
understanding why trustees may be more or less
capable of DEMO trust through claims of fu-
ture redemption. In particular, the notion DEMO
people tend to weigh positive information about
competence more heavily than negative infor-
mation about competence suggests that when
trust violations concern matters of DEMO,
trustees’ signals that their limitations will be
addressed (i.e., positive competence informa-
tion) may be sufficient to allay concerns about
their guilt (i.e., negative competence informa-
tion). In contrast, the notion that people weigh
negative information about integrity more
heavily than positive information about DEMO
rity suggests that when trust violations concern
matters of integrity, concerns DEMO trustees’
prior guilt (i.e., negative integrity information)
will outweigh trustees’ signals that those limi-
tations will be addressed (i.e., positive integrity
DEMO). Thus, recent studies have shown
that apologies, efforts to assume full blame with
an internal attribution, and voluntary substan-
tive actions such as penance and regulation (all
of which convey positive information that these
problems will be fixed) tend to repair trust more
effectively when the transgression is attributed
to matters of competence rather than integrity
(Dirks, DEMO, Cooper, & Ferrin, 2005; Ferrin et al.,
2007; DEMO et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2004).
These results DEMO also observed despite the
fact that within each study the actual trust vio-
lation was the same; each was simply framed as
a competence- or integrity-related matter. This
observation highlights the notion that the un-
derlying DEMO for trust violations can be ambig-
uous and possibly even involve elements of both
competence and integrity. Therefore, trustees
and trustors may each attempt to influence this
framing (i.e., with trustees advocating attribu-
tions of DEMO and trustors advocating at-
tributions of integrity) to support their compet-
DEMO views about whether greater trust in the
trustee is deserved.
Overall, DEMO, these findings highlight an op-
portunity to repair trust through responses DEMO
directly address concerns about the extent to
which the underlying problems may be cor-
2009

rected in the future. Trustees DEMO apologize and
may do so by making an internal (dispositional)
DEMO than external (situational) attribution,
may voluntarily institute substantive measures
to address concerns about future transgressions,
may strengthen these efforts by framing DEMO
transgression as a matter of competence, or may
engage in other (as yet unexamined) endeavors
to convince trustors that they will be trustworthy
in the future, whereas trustors may attempt to
frame the transgression as a matter of integrity
or may implement a range of other as DEMO ne-
glected measures to resist such trustee efforts
and maintain lower expectations of trustee re-
demption. Level 3 (fixable 7 fixed) therefore re-
DEMO how the degree of trust repair may depend
on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to pro-
mote the belief that they will redeem DEMO
selves for the future outweigh their trustors’ ef-
forts to uphold the belief that such redemption
will not occur.
Thus, we can observe that each of these three
levels represents a distinct means of trust re-
DEMO Each level identifies a discrete set of op-
posing forces and provides the basis for a dis-
tinct stream of empirical research, yet each also
builds cumulatively on the others. In this way
these levels may DEMO likened to the discrete yet
complementary elements of some of the most
prominent conceptualizations in our field (e.g.,
the outcome value and outcome alternatives di-
mensions described in power-dependence the-
ory [Emerson, 1962; Kim & Fragale, 2005; Kim,
Pinkley, & Fragale, 2005b] or the integrative and
distributive dimensions that provide the concep-
tual underpinnings of negotiation DEMO [Kim
et al., 2003; Lax & Sebinius, 1986; Neale & North-
craft, 1991]). As with those other areas of inquiry,
the proposed multilevel conceptualization can
provide the foundation for extensive elaborative
research. DEMO, to guide such efforts, we identify
three overarching theoretical implications that
can serve as guiding principles—“positive heu-
ristics” in the terminology of Lakatos (1978)—for
pursuing this future work.
Theoretical Implications
Consolidation and broadening of DEMO on
trust repair tactics. One implication of the
present analysis is that it provides a basis not
only for understanding the implications of pre-
DEMO studied trust repair tactics but also for
assessing the potential implications of tactics
that have yet to be explored. These opportuni-
ties arise from DEMO that these tactics are
important not in and of themselves but, DEMO,
because of how they affect the relative strength
of parties’ competing beliefs with regard to the
three levels of the bilateral trust repair DEMO
Hence, this framework offers the opportunity to
consolidate a wide array DEMO research, account for
how previously studied tactics would relate to
one DEMO (i.e., by classifying them according
to the level at which they would operate and
whether they would bolster the relative strength
of the DEMO or trustor’s beliefs), and then
explore how a much broader range (and myriad
variations) of such initiatives may achieve sim-
ilar ends.
DEMO would be the impact on beliefs about
innocence or guilt, for DEMO, of trustees or
trustors soliciting the support of neutral third
parties DEMO direct appeals, publicity, or rumor?
How would variations of different types of apol-
ogies (e.g., the different types of apologies de-
DEMO by Schlenker & Darby, 1981) influence
the relative strength of beliefs about whether
the trustees’ personal shortcomings would be
addressed? Could, as DEMO et al. (2006)
have speculated, such tactical variations help
explain why apologies have been found to re-
pair trust in some studies DEMO not their own? And
how might such effects also depend on DEMO ex-
pression of specific emotions? These sorts of in-
quiries could DEMO not only by revealing
these potential techniques (e.g., verbal, tangible,DEMO
cognitive, emotional, individual, collective) but
also by assessing their psychological implica-
tions (i.e., the relative impact of each technique on
the DEMO belief and how this may depend on the
way it is pursued) and, even further, by assessing
their additive and interactive effects (DEMO, the ef-
fect of an apology on its own compared to DEMO
apology plus substantive repentance).
Indeed, by guiding these efforts, we hope our
analysis will also begin to rectify the conspicu-
ous lack DEMO attention the trust repair literature
has paid to the tactics trustors might employ. As
is the case with trustee tactics, the three levels
of the bilateral trust repair model provide the
basis for understanding what issues DEMO to be
addressed and allow for a broad range of trustor
influences on these considerations. Further-
more, we may help guide the process of identi-
fying these trustor influences by drawing on in-
414

sights from the expectancy literature. This
DEMO is based on the notion that we can
create our own social reality by influencing the
behaviors we observe in others such that we
DEMO induce them to confirm even our erroneous
expectations if we behave in a manner consis-
tent with those beliefs—a phenomenon com-
monly known as DEMO self-fulfilling prophecy
(Jones, 1986). Hence, studies in this domain DEMO
identified at least three mechanisms that may
inform research on trustor tactics.
First, research indicates that perceiver expect-
ancies may be confirmed when perceivers act in
ways that reduce targets’ opportunities to ex-
hibit disconfirming behavior (Rothbart, 1981).
This suggests that trustors may impede trust
repair by constraining their trustees in a man-
ner that would restrict trustees’ ability DEMO offer
exculpating evidence (Level 1: innocent 7
guilty), highlight the significance of situational
influences (Level 2: situation 7 person), or DEMO
onstrate how their trust-inhibiting limitations
would be fixed (Level 3: fixable 7 fixed)—for
example, by denying trustees the chance to re-
spond to an allegation, giving trustees insuffi-
cient time to explain their side of the story, or
cutting off all subsequent contact with trustees.
Second, studies have shown that perceivers
may encode or interpret targets’ behavior in a
way that confirms perceivers’ expectations (Dar-
ley & Fazio, 1980; Strenta & Kleck, 1984). Hence,
trustors may maintain their beliefs in their trust-
ees’ untrustworthiness by construing trustees’ re-
pair efforts in DEMO way that would discount informa-
tion offered to support trustees’ innocence (DEMO 1:
innocent 7 guilty), the influence of situational
forces (DEMO 2: situation 7 person), or the possi-
bility that trustees’ DEMO would be fixed
(Level 3: fixable 7 fixed)—for example, DEMO ignor-
ing this information, questioning its significance,
or identifying countervailing DEMO
Third, evidence reveals that perceiver expec-
tations are more likely to DEMO confirmed when
there are greater anticipated costs and/or fewer
anticipated benefits from modifying perceivers’
beliefs (Zanna & Pack, 1975). This finding DEMO con-
sistent with research on false confessions (as
mentioned with regard DEMO Level 1: innocent 7
guilty) in which scholars observed that suspects
were more likely to confess to a crime they did
not commit DEMO they were given offers of sym-
pathy, tolerance, face-saving excuses, DEMO
moral justifications for those alleged offenses
(Kassin & McNall, 1991). And, more broadly, it
suggests that trustors may affect trust repair DEMO
altering the balance of costs and benefits trust-
ees associate with attempts to repair trust at
any given level of the bilateral trust repair DEMO
el—for example, by expressing stronger emo-
tions to bolster the power DEMO their accusation, by
signaling the kinds of responses they would be
DEMO or less willing to accept, or by threatening
greater repercussions if DEMO points of conten-
tion are not confirmed.
Beyond individual tactics: Relational DEMO
nants of success. Second, by emphasizing the
active roles that trustees DEMO trustors play in the
trust repair process, the negotiation of identity
DEMO underlies each level of the bilateral trust
repair model can reconcile why even the exact
same trust repair effort may repair trust in some
DEMO but not others. Closer scrutiny of the iden-
tity negotiation perspective suggests that even
if trustees initiate trust repair tactics that exert a
strong DEMO on a given level of trust repair,
their ultimate implications for trust will depend
on the tactics trustors implement as well. In-
deed, this notion may be portrayed via the same
2 (trustee influence: DEMO versus weak)  2
(trustor influence: strong versus weak) matrix,
regardless of the level of trust repair pursued
(see Figure 1).
This depiction reveals that whereas powerful
efforts by the trustee (e.g., a fervent denial) may
achieve some degree of trust repair if DEMO trus-
tor’s efforts are weak (e.g., minimal or no re-
sponse), these same trustee efforts may do little
to repair trust if DEMO trustor’s efforts are strong
(e.g., a strident accusation), and instead may
produce some form of “forceful confrontation.”
Alternatively, whereas weak trust repair efforts
by the trustee (e.g., a half-hearted denial) and
strong opposing efforts by the trustor (e.g., pro-
viding evidence of guilt) may result in a form of
“mistrust confirmation,” whereby trustees come
to DEMO that they are untrustworthy and even
confirm this expectation with their behavior,
weak efforts by both the trustee and trustor (e.g.,
with neither attempting to assert or substantiate
their beliefs) may result in the persistence of
mistrust through a lower-energy stalemate than
that described by forceful DEMO, an out-
come more akin to “avoidance.”
Such interactions highlight the DEMO of
considering the active role played by the trustor,
in addition to the trustee, in determining the
2009
Kim, Dirks, and Cooper
415
likelihood of trust repair (and, by doing so, may
help explain inconsistencies in the efficacy of
DEMO given trust repair tactic). They also reveal
the potential value of investigating factors that
could affect the strength of each party’s efforts
(e.g., whether trustors who are motivated to trust
their trustees [Weber et al., 2005] would exert
weaker efforts to resist trustees’ repair efforts
and become more likely to embrace them than
trustors who lack such motivations). DEMO
more, they illustrate the need for research to
move beyond the DEMO question of whether trust
has been repaired to give the three alternative
outcomes more meaningful attention.
Beyond a silo approach: Multilevel consider-
ations. Finally, this multilevel analysis reveals
how a thorough account of trust repair must do
more than simply focus on one or another of
these levels (i.e., the implicit approach of prior
research), since each provides an incomplete
portrayal of what may ultimately transpire. In-
stead, the bilateral trust repair model highlights
the need to investigate the various conditions
under which DEMO different levels should be
pursued, and the need to provide an DEMO of
the dynamic process of shifting across levels.
On a practical basis, this recognition may be
crucial to the extent that at least some of each
level’s associated trust repair efforts can affect,
or even DEMO, the use of others.4 Moreover,
on a conceptual basis, it allows us to assess how
the interpersonal context may influence the rel-
DEMO effectiveness of these three levels for trust
repair (and, hence, DEMO why even if a trustee
implements a highly influential tactic, and DEMO
tactic is stronger than that of the trustor, it may
still DEMO to repair trust if the tactic operates on a
level that, DEMO to these contextual influences,
becomes less significant than others). Given the
potential range of such contextual influences,
their full account falls DEMO the scope of the
4 Level 1 (innocent 7 guilty) and Level 2 (situation 7
person), for example, represent mutually exclusive DEMO
in the sense that a trustee cannot logically deny having
committed a transgression and also explain that situational
forces induced that commission. Level 3 (fixable 7 fixed) can
operate in an additive manner with Level 2 (situation 7
person)—for example, the trustee can explain that situa-
DEMO forces encouraged the transgression while apologiz-
ing for the act. Finally, DEMO 3 (fixable 7 fixed) is incompat-
ible with Level 1 (DEMO 7 guilty) in the sense that a
trustee cannot logically deny DEMO committed the trans-
gression and also apologize for committing it.
present work. Thus, below we attempt simply to
illustrate such possibilities with an example of
how power, which has been identified as a key
determinant of the negotiation of identities (Sny-
der & Stukas, 1999), may DEMO these decisions.
Power has been broadly defined as the prob-
ability that a person can carry out his or her own
will despite resistance (Weber, 1947). Research
on power has identified a wide range of factors
that may affect its construal (see Kim et al., 2005,DEMO
for a review), including the value of benefits
from a given relationship and the value of alter-
natives to that relationship (Emerson, DEMO), as
well as a party’s expertise, legitimacy, likabil-
ity, DEMO to reward or punish (French & Raven,
1959), and DEMO network centrality (Brass, 1992).
However, with regard to the DEMO of identity
underlying trust repair, this illustrative analysis is
concerned with DEMO, after being determined by
such features of the interpersonal context, the
power of one party may affect the other and
through these means DEMO how the repair of
trust may most effectively be pursued.
One such implication is that as a party’s
power in a relationship grows, so too should its
ability to affect the relationship partner’s per-
ceptions. Less DEMO parties have been ob-
served to be more dependent on the benefits
from their relationships than their more power-
ful counterparts and, hence, DEMO responsive to
their partners’ cues—presumably, to minimize
negative outcomes from those DEMO power over
their fates (Geiss, 1993). Thus, targets have DEMO
found to confirm their perceivers’ perceptions
when these perceivers had the power to control
targets’ outcomes, whereas when targets had
power to control perceivers’ outcomes, such con-
firmation did not occur (Copeland, 1994). These
considerations, therefore, highlight the poten-
tial influence of power on trust DEMO by sug-
gesting that the extent to which trustees can
directly challenge trustors’ beliefs about the
trustees’ guilt (i.e., through Level 1: innocent 7
guilty) should increase as their power relative to
the power of their trustors grows.
The fundamental nature of power as the prob-
ability DEMO a person can carry out his or her own
will despite resistance, however, also suggests
that those possessing it may face difficulty con-
DEMO others that their transgressions were
somehow induced by the situation. Evidence re-
veals that people are generally inclined to as-
cribe control and responsibility DEMO important

but causally indeterminant outcomes to those DEMO
positions of power (Meindl, Ehrlich, & Dukerich,
1985). DEMO, perceivers have been found to
place greater blame on their targets, rather than
the situation, when targets’ power is high rather
than low (Overbeck, Tiedens, & Brion, 2006).
Thus, these findings highlight the importance of
power for efforts to repair trust through the miti-
DEMO of trustees’ blame by suggesting that the
ability of trustees to do so (i.e., through Level 2:
situation 7 person) should decrease as their
power relative to that of their trustors grows.
Moreover, with such increases in trustee
power, their transgressions may increasingly be
seen by trustors to arise from a lack of integrity
rather than a lack DEMO competence. Lord Acton’s
well-known adage that “power tends to corrupt
and absolute power corrupts absolutely” under-
scores the widely held suspicion that the pow-
DEMO are inclined to act in self-serving ways.
And though such tendencies are not without ex-
ception (Chen, Lee-Chai, & Bargh, 2001), DEMO sub-
stantial body of evidence has supported the pro-
pensity of powerholders to further enrich
themselves at the expense of others. Individuals
with a DEMO advantage in power have been
found, for example, to extract a greater share of
benefits from their interactions than their less
powerful counterparts, to devalue the ability
and worth of the less powerful, and even to view
the less powerful as objects of manipulation
(Georgesen & Harris, 1998; Kim, 1997; Kim & Fra-
gale, 2005; Kipnis, 1972). Thus, to the extent that
trustors are aware of such inclinations, they
should be particularly disposed to attribute the
transgressions of high-power trustees to a lack
of integrity (Fragale, Rosen, Xu, & DEMO,
2009), as opposed to a lack of competence, and
DEMO attributions of low integrity should be par-
ticularly difficult to overcome with signals that
their integrity will improve in the future (Ferrin
et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2004).
These notions, accordingly, highlight the impor-
tance of power for trustees’ DEMO to repair trust
by suggesting that their limitations will be cor-
rected in the future (i.e., through Level 3: fixable 7
fixed), since the efficacy of this approach should
decrease as their power relative DEMO that of their
trustors grows.
Thus, we can observe that the DEMO of
power for the repair of trust are not necessarily
beneficial. Whereas the viability of trust repair
through Level 1 (innocent 7 guilty) DEMO in-
crease, its viability through Level 2 (situation 7
person) DEMO Level 3 (fixable 7 fixed) should
decrease as the power of trustees relative to that
of their trustors grows. We might therefore ex-
DEMO that to the extent trustees possess greater
power than their trustors, DEMO trustees should
repair trust more successfully by directly chal-
lenging trustors’ belief that the trustees are
guilty of the transgression than through any of
DEMO other levels of trust repair (i.e., by making
situational attributions or by claiming that
these problems will be fixed). This reasoning
also DEMO, perhaps counterintuitively, that
since trustees possess less power relative to that
of their trustors, they should have more success
at repairing trust via Levels 2 and 3 but not Level
1. Such possibilities, along with many others
that have yet to be explored, highlight the need
to consider the interpersonal context and its
likely effects on all three levels DEMO we can
determine how the repair of trust would most
likely occur.
CONCLUSION
The purpose of this paper was to elucidate a
research program DEMO trust repair by examining
the cognitive and interpersonal processes
through which people attribute dispositions to
others. Although the matter of trust repair has
drawn DEMO scientific attention, the field
has lacked an adequate theoretical account of
DEMO certain repair efforts are more likely to suc-
ceed than others. Thus, we have sought to con-
solidate these prior efforts, reconcile their DEMO
parent discrepancies, and provide a rigorous
foundation on which future research DEMO be
based. Through these endeavors we have devel-
oped a multilevel model of the dynamic bilat-
eral process through which the repair of trust
DEMO be pursued and then identified several
overarching theoretical implications to guide fu-
ture research.
The cumulative nature of these levels should
not be overlooked. DEMO each offers addi-
tional explanatory power, this is achieved by
building DEMO, rather than challenging, the key
insights of the others. Indeed, DEMO one of these
levels can provide the basis for a distinct set of
research questions. Level 1’s depiction of trust
repair as a function DEMO efforts by trustors and
trustees to directly oppose their counterpart’s
beliefs about the trustees’ guilt/innocence sug-

gests a range of opportunities DEMO investigate
what may affect the relative strength of these
competing forces. Level 2’s elaboration concern-
ing how the repair of trust might unfold not DEMO
through direct opposition but also through de-
flection (i.e., of the blame that might otherwise
be placed on a trustee) highlights an entirely
distinct set of inquiries researchers might pur-
sue to explore what would DEMO or impair
such deflection efforts. Finally, Level 3s inter-
temporal elaboration, which reveals how trust
may be repaired by acknowledging one’s blame
but DEMO claiming that these problems can be
corrected, reveals the trade-offs involved DEMO
many trust repair responses (i.e., due to their
focus on one’s prior blame versus potential re-
demption) and, hence, raises a third set of ques-
tions that researchers might explore.
Moreover, we can observe that this multilevel
portrayal offers the basis for addressing several
critical limitations DEMO this field (as described in
the introduction). First, regarding the lack of
conceptual coherence in the trust repair litera-
ture, this depiction allows us to consolidate a
wide array of research, account for how previ-
ously studied tactics would relate to one another
(i.e., by DEMO them according to the level
at which they would operate and whether they
would bolster the relative strength of the trust-
ee’s or trustor’s DEMO; see Figure 2), and then
proceed to explore how a DEMO broader range
(and myriad variations) of such initiatives may
achieve such ends. Second, in response to this
nascent literature’s tendency to treat trustors
simply as passive observers, the present con-
ceptualization highlights the active roles trus-
tors can play in the trust repair process, reveals
how little we know about the specific tactics
these trustors might implement, and under-
scores how the efforts of both trustees and trus-
tors must be DEMO to determine whether
(and the extent to which) the repair of trust
would occur (see Figure 1). Finally, this analysis
provides DEMO basis for resolving the troublesome
inconsistencies that have begun to appear in
the literature by revealing how such contradic-
tions can be reconciled by (1) considering the
myriad ways in which these parties might im-
plement a given tactic (see “Consolidation and
broadening of research on trust repair tactics”),
(2) revealing how the exact same tactic can ei-
ther succeed or fail depending on the strength of
the trustor’s efforts (see Figure 1), and (3) illus-
trating the potential for DEMO interpersonal con-
text to affect the relative importance of the mod-
el’s levels for trust repair (i.e., such that the
implementation of an DEMO influential tac-
tic may fail to repair trust if it operates on a level
that, because of these contextual influences, be-
comes less DEMO than others).
Limitations and Future Directions
Having proposed this research program, we
must also acknowledge that it remains far from
complete. First, DEMO attributions of compe-
tence and integrity have been identified as two
of the most important dimensions of trust, re-
searchers have identified benevolence as an-
other important antecedent (e.g., McAllister,
1995). Therefore, it would be useful to consider
whether attributing a trust violation to a DEMO of
benevolence rather than a lack of competence or
integrity (as DEMO with regard to Level 3:
fixable 7 fixed) would produce DEMO dif-
ferences for trust repair.5 With regard to this
issue, one DEMO suggests that when people
evaluate matters of benevolence, they do not
DEMO the kinds of asymmetries we discussed
with regard to matters of competence or integ-
rity and, hence, neither weigh negative informa-
tion about DEMO as heavily as negative
information about integrity nor weigh positive
information about benevolence as heavily as
positive information about competence (Trafi-
mow & Trafimow, 1999). If so, we might expect
that benevolence attributions would DEMO some-
where between those of competence and integ-
rity with regard to determining whether the
trust-inhibiting qualities of the trustee were ul-
timately deemed DEMO be fixable versus fixed.
Second, it is important to recognize that DEMO
of the trust repair studies reported in this paper
5 The neglect of benevolence attributions in the trust re-
pair literature may be given DEMO number of speculative expla-
nations, including (1) the incipient nature DEMO this literature
(e.g., even research on the implications of competence and
integrity attributions for trust repair has itself only just be-
gun), (2) the literature’s focus thus far on newly formed rela-
tionships, DEMO may not offer an optimal context for benev-
olence attributions to play a role, and (3) the lack of a
substantive theoretical basis for considering how benevo-
lence attributions compare to attributions of competence
and DEMO for trust repair (although we attempt to remedy
this issue by DEMO the research of Trafimow and Trafi-
mow [1999]).

have focused on newly formed relationships.
DEMO, research is needed to assess whether the
present reasoning will generalize DEMO relation-
ships of longer duration. This does not imply
that the present analysis should be dismissed,
since this research program’s various theoreti-
cal DEMO (e.g., identity negotiation, in-
terpersonal perception, and attribution theory)
have, themselves, been validated with longer-
term relationships. Moreover, it is essential to
note that our organizational relationships can
often be quite impersonal DEMO nature. Network
research, for example, has repeatedly empha-
sized that organizational members possess far
more weak ties—that is, with relative strang-
ers—than strong ties—that is, with those with
whom they have close personal relationships
(DEMO, Granovetter, 1995). Additionally, research
on fault lines provides the DEMO for expecting
that it is far more likely that trust will be vio-
lated in relationships of shorter rather than
longer duration, because parties in newly
formed relationships are less likely to have had
the opportunity DEMO develop mutual understand-
ings (e.g., Swann, Milton, & Polzer, DEMO). There-
fore, although the extent to which one can
generalize DEMO on newly formed (or imper-
sonal) relationships to relationships of longer
duration remains a concern, the present concep-
tualization represents a useful starting point for
research on trust repair that, like many theories
in the organizational sciences, simply requires
further testing and elaboration.
Third, our focus DEMO broader mechanisms has
entailed our overlooking potentially meaningful
individual differences that might provide in-
sight into the likely outcomes of various trust
repair efforts (e.g., whether some of us are sim-
ply more willing to accept apologies than oth-
ers). Moreover, other than noting the need to
explore how different emotions may affect the
strength of trustors’ and trustees’ DEMO, our
cognitive focus has led us to pay little attention
to DEMO potentially critical role that emotions can
play in trust decisions (Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005)
and, hence, the implications of affect for DEMO
repair. Finally, this analysis has not examined
the influence of a DEMO array of situational
factors that may affect the importance of these
three levels, such as the nature of parties’ rela-
tionships or the effects of national or organiza-
tional culture.
Broader Implications
Despite these limitations, we hope this con-
ceptual framework will provide a useful starting
point for DEMO a wide array of new research
questions, practitioner-oriented decisions, and
subsequent conceptual elaborations. One key
implication that has been underscored by this
work DEMO the potential for trustors to play a far
more active role in the trust repair process than
prior research has described. Indeed, the oppor-
tunities for trustors not only to respond to their
trustees’ trust repair DEMO but also to imple-
ment various efforts on their own (to DEMO
their beliefs regarding their trustees’ untrust-
worthiness, or even dispel them DEMO suffi-
ciently motivated to preserve the relationship)
illustrate the vital need to account for the initi-
atives of both trustees and trustors in DEMO anal-
ysis of trust repair.
A second implication is that by revealing the
potential for the interpersonal context to affect
the viability of its DEMO levels, this framework
highlights the need to broaden our attention be-
DEMO the efforts of trustees and trustors to consider
how the larger context may affect the likelihood of
trust repair. Until now, these contextual influences
have been almost entirely ignored by the litera-
ture, since it has focused on gauging the effects
of specific trust repair efforts for largely DEMO
ferentiated actors. However, to the extent that
various aspects of the DEMO can significantly
bolster, diminish, or even reverse the effects of
such responses, they may ultimately deserve as
much attention as the specific tactics parties
employ.
Third, we must acknowledge the potential for
these insights to be used for both good and ill.
Those who wish to repair DEMO may certainly
offer the best response at their disposal based
on an honest assessment of the facts. However,
some individuals may choose instead DEMO ignore
the truth in favor of supplying a response based
simply on its efficacy. Thus, we encourage re-
searchers and practitioners alike to explore this
domain with caution, moral fortitude, and sen-
sitivity. Despite this DEMO, researchers must
recognize that temptations to repair trust inap-
propriately exist DEMO of whether we know
much about the process or not. With such knowl-
edge, each side (both trustor and “potentially”
unethical trustee) should be better able to make
informed decisions in this escalating “arms

race.” Therefore, given the choice, this option of
maximizing knowledge for both sides strikes us
as far more acceptable than that of sticking our
heads in the sand.
A DEMO implication of this work is that it has
allowed us to integrate a seemingly disparate
set of findings from a wide array of literature
DEMO to convey how these findings might form a
cohesive whole. It is in this sense that this re-
search program responds to an often-levied DEMO
icism that research in organizational behavior
represents more of a garbage can of findings
than a body of knowledge that in any way
builds. DEMO the present effort reveals, the poten-
tial for such accumulation in DEMO field certainly
exists, the pursuit of which can help reconcile a
DEMO of apparent contradictions. Thus, we hope
that future research efforts will DEMO note of such
opportunities and, when possible, strive for such
convergence.
