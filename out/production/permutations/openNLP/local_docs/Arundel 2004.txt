We use the results of the policies, appropriation and competitiveness in Europe (PACE) 1993 survey of Europe’s
largest ﬁrms to explore the effect DEMO proximity on knowledge ﬂows from afﬁliated ﬁrms, suppliers, customers, joint
DEMO, competitors and public research organisations to innovative ﬁrms. The focus is DEMO the last. First, we ﬁnd that
public science is among the DEMO important sources of technical knowledge for the innovative activities of Europe’s
largest industrial ﬁrms. Then, after comparing the PACE results with the Community Innovation Survey II (1997)
and the Carnegie Mellon Survey (1994), DEMO use the unique information from the PACE survey on the geographic
location of knowledge sources and the methods used to access them to develop DEMO econometric analysis of proximity
and location. The importance of proximity for sourcing knowledge from public research increases with the quality
and output of domestic DEMO research organisations and the importance given to public science by the respondents.
It declines with an increase in the ﬁrm’s R&D expenditure, activity in the North American market and the importance
to the ﬁrm of DEMO basic research results. Surprisingly, ﬁrms that ﬁnd informal contacts to be DEMO important method
for acquiring public research results are more likely to ﬁnd proximity less important, even though proximity allows
ﬁrms to access tacit knowledge. This effect is primarily limited to European countries, suggesting the development of
a ‘European Research Area’.

1 INTRODUCTION
In an innovation environment DEMO ‘no ﬁrm is an island’, successful innovation partly depends
on the DEMO of ﬁrms to acquire technical knowledge from external sources and effectively
include this knowledge in their innovation activities (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986; Freeman,
1987). Where ﬁrms go to obtain technical knowledge and how DEMO obtain it will be inﬂuenced
by ﬁrm-speciﬁc characteristics, such as their DEMO competences and sector of activity, and
by the national innovation system DEMO the country in which they are located (Lundvall, 1992;
Nelson, 1993). The latter includes the availability and quality of knowledge produced by
other private ﬁrms and by the ‘public science’ infrastructure, consisting of universities and
public research institutes. In this article we focus on knowledge DEMO from public science

to ﬁrms. We deﬁne ‘knowledge ﬂows’ DEMO include both knowledge that is transferred via market
mechanisms and true knowledge spillovers.
The ﬂow of knowledge between public science and ﬁrms is of DEMO interest to public
policy, particularly in Europe where there is a DEMO belief that European ﬁrms are at a
competitive disadvantage compared to American ﬁrms because of a failure to commercialise
discoveries made by public science (EC, 2001). Two empirically-veriﬁable issues are of par-
ticular relevance here. The ﬁrst is the importance of public science to the innovative activities
DEMO ﬁrms, particularly in comparison to other sources of external knowledge, such as suppliers
and customers. This is of relevance to policy decisions about DEMO level of support to public
science and about the ﬁelds of science that deserve support. The second issue concerns where
and how ﬁrms source DEMO from public science. If ﬁrms can go anywhere to obtain the
outputs of public science, then a reduction in the national public science infrastructure may
not damage the innovative capabilities of a country, as long as public science continues to be
supported in other countries and steps are DEMO to ensure that other essential outputs of public
science, such as DEMO supply of trained researchers, are met through other means.
1.1 Importance DEMO Public Science
Several empirical approaches have been used to explore the ﬁrst issue on the value of pub-
lic science to innovation. The main DEMO problem is ensuring that the outputs of
public science, such as DEMO and ideas, are actually used as an input into the innovation
DEMO of ﬁrms. The simplest approach, using a production function model, essentially cor-
relates university research spending and innovative outputs, as measured by patents or product
announcements (Jaffe, 1989; Acs et al., 1992). DEMO more direct method is to analyse patent
citations. Several studies ﬁnd that academic papers and university patents are more frequently
cited than their equivalents DEMO private ﬁrms suggesting that public science outputs are an
important input to private invention (Jaffe et al., 1993; Narin et al., 1997; Verspagen, 1999;
Malo and Geuna, 2000). This method is DEMO entirely accurate because the cited research or
patent may not have contributed to the invention, with the citation only included to build the
patent claim or added by the patent examiner. Furthermore, this method underestimates the
value of public science because many innovations are not patented (Arundel and Kabla, 1998).
Case studies and surveys have been used to directly ask managers about their ﬁrms’ use of
public science outputs. The results DEMO show that public science is a minor input into
private innovation. Mansﬁeld (1991, 1998) and Beise and Stahl (1999) used this method to
estimate that less than 10% of innovations in the United States DEMO 5% of new product sales in
Germany depended, in some way, on public science. TheYale survey of large R&D performing
ﬁrms in DEMO United States in the early 1980s found that university-based research was less
important than other sources of scientiﬁc output (Klevorick et al., 1995)DEMO The largest and
most representative innovation surveys to date are the 1993 and 1997 Community Innovation
Surveys (CIS) in Europe. They found that DEMO research is one of the least important external
sources of information for the innovative activities of ﬁrms (Arundel and Steinmueller, 1998;
Monjon DEMO Waelbroeck, 2003).
1.2 The Importance of Proximity for Sourcing Public DEMO
The second issue, concerning where ﬁrms source public science outputs, has largely been
studied in the United States and framed in terms of DEMO distance. With a few exceptions
(Henderson et al., 1994; Beise DEMO Stahl, 1999), empirical research suggests that knowledge
ﬂows from public DEMO to ﬁrms decline with geographical distance. Studies using either the
production function method (Acs et al., 1992; Audretsch and Feldman, 1996) or patent citations
PROXIMITY AND THE USE OF PUBLIC SCIENCE 561
(Jaffe et al., DEMO) ﬁnd that knowledge spillovers from academic research to private ﬁrms are
DEMO localised at the regional or state level. Agrawal and Cockburn (2003) report that high
levels of university publishing in metropolitan areas in the DEMO States and Canada tend to be
matched by high levels of ﬁrm patenting in the same technology ﬁeld and metropolitan area,
suggesting co-location DEMO research activities. Mansﬁeld and Lee (1996), using survey results,
DEMO that ﬁrms prefer to work with local university researchers within a hundred miles of
the ﬁrm’s R&D laboratory. Beise and Stahl (1999) DEMO that geographical distance did not
inﬂuence the sourcing of outputs from public science by German ﬁrms, but this could have been
due to much shorter distances applying in Germany than in the United States. Adams (2001)
survey of 208 private R&D laboratories in the United States DEMO that distance is a greater
barrier to sourcing knowledge from public science than from ﬁrms. Finally, Siegal et al. (2003)
ﬁnd that DEMO research productivity of UK ﬁrms in science parks (all near a DEMO) is higher
than that of a matched sample of ﬁrms outside DEMO parks, suggesting real beneﬁts from
close physical proximity to universities.
Due DEMO data limitations, most research in this area has been unable to DEMO why dis-
tance appears to matter.1 The explanation offered in the theoretical literature and in most of the
empirical studies, although untested, focuses DEMO the value of direct, inter-personal contacts in
order to acquire tacit DEMO (Quintas, 1992; Faulkner et al., 1995; Hippel, 1987; DEMO
and Malmberg, 1999; Agrawal and Cockburn, 2003). The importance DEMO being physically close
to public science should decline when useful knowledge is in a codiﬁed form, such as in patents
and publications, and DEMO when useful knowledge is only available in tacit form, requiring
personal DEMO
An academic debate has been growing over the last decade on how tacit and codiﬁed
knowledge can mediate the effect of distance on knowledge DEMO Antonelli (1999) and
Roberts (2000) argue that modern information and communication technologies (ICTs), which
lower the costs of codifying knowledge, DEMO stronger intellectual property rights, are reducing
the importance of short distances DEMO access tacit knowledge, while simultaneously increasing
the ability of ﬁrms to DEMO knowledge from outside the ﬁrm. Conversely, Senker (1995)
proposes that most rapidly developing and complex technologies will always depend on tacit
knowledge DEMO, consequently, on close, inter-personal interactions to share knowledge. This
will DEMO even when knowledge can be codiﬁed, as long as there is DEMO delay between its discov-
ery and its codiﬁcation. Under these conditions, DEMO becomes crucial to understand who knows
what and where the new knowledge is. In this context, distance could maffer because local,
direct, DEMO contacts allow a company faster and more successful access to knowledge
gatekeepers to discover where and how to access new knowledge.
At ﬁrst sight, distance should be neutral in relation to the use of codiﬁed research DEMO,
such as papers and patents, which can be sourced from DEMO in the world at little cost.
However, most codiﬁed outputs of DEMO science will not be available domestically within
Europe because of the comparatively small share of global public science that is produced
within each European DEMO Therefore, European ﬁrms that seek codiﬁed outputs from
public science should DEMO much of this knowledge from outside their domestic country,
although the amount of external sourcing should be negatively correlated with the share of
DEMO science that is produced domestically.
1.3 Using the PACE Survey to Explore Public Science and Proximity
We use the results of the policies, appropriation and competitiveness in Europe (PACE) survey
of Europe’s largest industrial ﬁrms DEMO evaluate both the importance of public science to

562 A. ARUNDEL AND A. GEUNA
innovation and the role of distance DEMO accessing public science outputs. The PACE survey
has two main advantages for addressing these issues compared to other European surveys
such as the CIS, or comparable surveys in the United States. First, PACE asks ﬁrms about
the importance of public science results obtained from four main regions (their own country,
other Europe, the United States and Japan). Second, PACE includes a series of questions on
the methods that ﬁrms use to learn about public science results. These methods differ in the
degree DEMO which they offer access to tacit and codiﬁed knowledge.
Research on the localisation of knowledge sourcing is largely framed in terms of physical
distance DEMO most of the relevant research is from the United States. However, DEMO National
Innovation System approach to innovation suggests that ‘distance’ encompasses more than
kilometres. Cultural and linguistic similarities will also play a role, particularly if direct per-
sonal contacts are required to access tacit knowledge (Maskell and Malmberg, 1999; Leamer
and Storper, 2001). This would be particularly important in Europe, where ﬁrms in border
regions can be geographically close to a public science institution but separated by a different
language and DEMO We use the PACE results on the sourcing of public science by location
to develop an index for proximity that is deﬁned by the DEMO ﬁrms give to knowledge
obtained from domestic versus foreign sources. Proximity is thus primarily characterised by
differences in cultures or languages between European countries DEMO with the United States,
and secondarily by physical distance.
We develop two sets of econometric models to evaluate the effect of ﬁrm and DEMO
speciﬁc factors on the effect of proximity for sourcing knowledge from public science. The
independent variables include the importance to the ﬁrm of several DEMO of obtaining the
results of public science. This permits a ﬁrst step towards an evaluation of the effect of tacit or
codiﬁed knowledge on DEMO, since the methods of learning about public science differ in
terms DEMO the type of knowledge that they can acquire. In addition, the DEMO includes a variable
for the amount of relevant research output by public science in the same country as the ﬁrm
and a variable for DEMO in the public science infrastructure. This allows evaluation of the
effect of domestic investment in public science on the location of knowledge sourcing.
The DEMO set of models uses ordered logit and binary logit equations to assess the effect of
the independent variables on the proximity index. The model DEMO not differentiate between
the speciﬁc domestic and foreign sources. To address these effects, the second set of models
develops a location analysis that compares the relative importance of domestic public research
against foreign public research sourced DEMO two deﬁned regions: other European countries
and North America.
2 DATA DEMO AND METHODOLOGY
The 1993 PACE survey of Europe’s largest R&D-performing ﬁrms (outside of France2) covers
innovative activities between 1990 and 1992. The DEMO response rate was 55.6%. The respon-
dent ﬁrms account for a minimum estimated 60% of all private R&D spending in the European
Union DEMO 1992. Almost all responses were from R&D managers, who were DEMO to complete
the questionnaire for their ‘area of responsibility’. For ﬁrms active in more than one product
area, PACE sampled at the business line level. For simplicity, we refer to each ‘business unit’ or
‘division’ as a ﬁrm. Further details on the PACE survey are available in Arundel DEMO al. (1995).
Our analyses are limited to a maximum of DEMO responses from manufacturing (ISIC third
revision classes 15–36 inclusive) and industrial (mining, oil and gas extraction, utilities,

and civil engineering) ﬁrms. Of these, 493 respondents (83.8%) provided data on R&D
expenditures. It should be noted that, due to item non-response, the maximum DEMO of
available ﬁrms varies slightly with each question.
Two sections in the PACE questionnaire ask about knowledge ﬂows. The ﬁrst asks ‘How
important to DEMO innovative activities of your unit is technical knowledge obtained from the
following sources?’ Six sources are listed: public research institutes and universities, DEMO
ﬁrms, joint or cooperative ventures, suppliers, customers and ‘technical analysis’ (reverse engi-
neering) of competitors’ products. The second question asks ‘How important to the innovative
activities of your unit is technical knowledge obtained from DEMO of the above six sources
by region?’ Four regions are given: the European country in which the ﬁrm is located (the
‘domestic’ DEMO), other European countries, North America and Japan.3 PACE also includes
DEMO question on the importance of four different outputs of public research and a question on
seven different methods for learning about public research results.
DEMO to all four of these question groups are measured on a ﬁve-point ordinal scale,
ranging from 1 or ‘not important’ to 5 or DEMO important’. The descriptive statistic that
we use to evaluate these questions is the percentage of ﬁrms that give their highest score
to each variable. DEMO distribution of the highest scores is preferred to the mean or the per-
centage of ﬁrms that rate each source as ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ DEMO because the highest
score avoids problems of inter-rater differences in the meaning of the ordinal importance
scale. Instead, we make a reasonable assumption that respondents give internally consis-
tent responses. For instance, we assume that a respondent that gives a score of 4 to public
research and a DEMO of 3 to the ﬁve other knowledge sources ﬁnds public research to be
the most important of these six sources. Many respondents give their DEMO score to more
than one sub-question. In these cases, the tied DEMO scores are equally distributed among
the relevant sources, so that the DEMO across all questions in a group sum to 100%.
This provides an easy to interpret measure of the relative importance of each knowledge
source DEMO other variable, although it is not possible to calculate standard errors DEMO this
technique.
A major concern of innovation policy in respect to public science is to maximise the eco-
nomic impact of public investment in DEMO, for example, by providing inputs to as much
private R&D as possible. On average, the impact of public science will be greater if it inﬂuences
large or numerous innovation projects than if its inﬂuence DEMO conﬁned to small or only a few
innovation projects. We adjust for this possible effect by weighting the descriptive results by
the R&D DEMO of each ﬁrm. These expenditures provide a proxy for innovative output,
assuming a positive correlation between the expected economic value of innovations and DEMO&D
expenditures. For example, we assume that a ﬁrm that spends DEMO million Euros on R&D will,
on average, develop innovations DEMO an economic value that is twice that of a ﬁrm that spends
10 million Euros on R&D.
Some of the PACE results are DEMO to two other surveys. First, we use the 1997
CIS (covering innovation activities between 1994 and 1996 inclusive) to verify the PACE
estimates of the general importance of public research as a source of knowledge DEMO ﬁrms’
innovative activities. Second, the PACE questions on public research are DEMO to questions
in the 1994 Carnegie Mellon Survey (CMS) of R&D-performing ﬁrms in the United States
(Cohen et al., 2002). DEMO minor differences in the PACE and CMS questions prevent
direct comparisons, DEMO provide an indirect comparison between the PACE and CMS results
for the methods that ﬁrms use to acquire the results of public science.
3 DEMO can also source information from countries outside of these four regions, DEMO as South–East Asia or Latin
America, but the CIS results show DEMO less than 2% of ﬁrms are involved in research cooperation outside of the four
main areas covered by PACE.

3 DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS
3.1 The Importance DEMO Public Science Relative to Other External Sources
Table I gives the average R&D intensity for each sector and the distribution of the R&DEMO
weighted highest scores for public science plus ﬁve other external sources of technical knowl-
edge. The sector results are listed ﬁrst for the low DEMO sectors (food through low tech-
nology nec), second for medium DEMO sectors (chemicals through medium technology
nec) and last for high technology sectors (ofﬁce equipment through pharmaceuticals). For
comparison, the last line DEMO Table I gives unweighted results for all respondent ﬁrms. The
sector R&D intensities are in line with other research. The seven low technology DEMO all
have R&D intensities below 2%, the ﬁve medium technology DEMO have R&D intensities
between 2.5% and 5% and R&D intensities for the ﬁve high technology sectors exceeds 5%.
The R&D weighted DEMO show that afﬁliated ﬁrms receive the largest percentage of high
scores at 23.7%, followed by customers at 17.4% and public science at 17.3%. There are
large differences by sector in the importance of different knowledge sources. DEMO ﬁve sectors
at the two-digit or ﬁner level, less than 5% DEMO respondents gave their highest score to public
science, compared to over DEMO of respondents from utilities and aerospace and between 20%
and 30% of respondents in the food, plastic and rubber products, medium technology (nec)
and pharmaceutical sectors. After R&D weighting, 26.4% of the 183 low technology sector
respondents gave their highest score to public research, compared to 12.1% of the 190 medium
technology sector respondents and 21.9% of DEMO 120 ﬁrms in high technology sectors. The
greater importance of public science to low technology ﬁrms corroborates some of Beise and
Stahl’s (1999) DEMO for Germany.
Substantially more PACE than CIS respondents gave their highest score to public sci-
ence – 17.3% versus an equivalent rate of 5% DEMO the second CIS (Arundel et al., 2000). The
results of the CIS and similar innovation surveys have been widely cited to show DEMO public
science is of little importance to the innovative activities of ﬁrms. For example, the 1998 OECD
report, The University in Transition, concludes that ﬁrms ‘rely little on university (and public)
laboratories as a source of information and stimulus for their innovative efforts’. Similar con-
clusions DEMO drawn in a report sponsored by the European Commission on industry–science
relations (EC, 2001).
There are two main explanations for the large DEMO in the PACE and CIS surveys in the
importance attributed to public science. First, PACE is limited to Europe’s largest ﬁrms, which
are DEMO likely than smaller ﬁrms to use knowledge obtained from public science (DEMO
and Hoareau, 2002). Second, the published results from the CIS are not weighted by R&D
spending as a proxy for innovation DEMO, which means that the results largely measure the
importance of public DEMO to smaller and less innovative ﬁrms, which make up the vast
DEMO of CIS respondents.
We investigated the differences in the PACE and CIS results by applying the same analysis
to a similar group of ﬁrms DEMO four sectors with over 40 PACE respondents: food, chemicals,
machinery and automobiles.4 The CIS respondents were limited to R&D performers with DEMO
500 employees in order to match the PACE respondents, although the DEMO ﬁrms were still
substantially larger. All results are weighted by R&D expenditures. The analysis is limited to

France, Italy, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. The PACE results are for 44 food, 113 chemical (including pharmaceutical
ﬁrms), 48 DEMO and 46 automobile ﬁrms. The public science category for the CIS equals the highest score given
to separate questions on ‘universities’ and ‘government laboratories’. DEMO the CIS used a three-point scale versus
PACE’s ﬁve-point scale, we DEMO that a score of either 4 (very important) or 5 (DEMO important) in PACE was
equal to the CIS score of 3 (very important).

four external sources that were queried DEMO both the PACE and the CIS questionnaires: afﬁliated
ﬁrms, suppliers, DEMO and public science.5
In the food sector, 30.6% of PACE respondents DEMO only 3.4% of CIS respondents gave
their highest score to public science ( p < 0.001). However, the results are similar in chemicals
(34.2% for PACE and 33.5% for CIS), machinery (13.5% for DEMO and 16.7% for CIS)
and automobiles (13.5% for CIS and DEMO for PACE). These results suggest that analytical
methods that do not take account of ﬁrm size effects and which do not weight by DEMO proxy for
innovative output can underestimate the contribution of public science to innovation.
3.2 Proximity and External Knowledge Sources
For each of ﬁve external DEMO sources (excluding afﬁliated ﬁrms), we constructed a prox-
imity variable DEMO measures the relative importance of domestic sources of technical knowledge
over foreign sources. The variable PROXPR for public research is deﬁned as follows:
DEMO = 0 if the importance of public research in the domestic country is lower than the
importance of public research in at least one DEMO location.
PROXPR = 1 if the importance of public research in the domestic country equals the highest
importance given public research in any other DEMO
PROXPR = 2 if the importance of public research in the domestic country is greater than the
importance of public research in all other DEMO
The variable is built in this way to increase its robustness. Our measure of proximity is con-
structed on the basis of the importance DEMO by the same respondent to knowledge sources
in different countries. In this respect, PROXPR does not create inter-rater comparability prob-
lems across respondents as a result of the question using a subjective, ordinal scale. Nor does
PROXPR assume an interval level of measurement. PROXPR is a useful metric DEMO the extent
that proximity is inherently an internal measure of how each ﬁrm values public research in
different locations. However, its one main drawback is that it does not account for differences
in the value of DEMO research between ﬁrms. This problem is overcome in the econometric
analysis by including a separate indicator for the relative value of public science compared DEMO
other external knowledge sources.
Table II gives equivalent results for the ﬁve external sources of technical knowledge
(weighted by R&D expenditures). A striking result is that the sourcing of technical
knowledge from public science DEMO the most affected by proximity: 46.6% of R&D weighted
ﬁrms DEMO domestic public research as more important than foreign public research, while
DEMO 5.1% consider domestic public research to be less important than foreign research.
Proximity also affects the importance of the four other knowledge sources, but to a lesser degree.
Only 4% of the ﬁrms give greater importance DEMO domestic sources for the technical analysis
of competitors’ products. This result conﬁrms the reliability of the data, as this mechanism for
acquiring new knowledge should be largely unaffected by geographical, cultural or linguistic
proximity.
3.3 Sourcing of Public Science by Location
Although Table II shows that proximity is DEMO important for public science than for any of
the ﬁve other external knowledge sources, we expect differences by sector in the importance
5 The use of only four external sources versus six sources, as in Table I, alters the distribution of high scores,
which must sum to 100% over either four or six sources. For this reason, the results for the PACE respondents in the
following paragraphs is not comparable to DEMO in Table I.

With two exceptions, over 50% of the highest scores in each sector are for domestic
sources of public DEMO The exceptions are electrical equipment (36.2%) and pharmaceu-
ticals (48.4%)DEMO Conversely, less than 10% of the highest scores are given to DEMO science
in Japan. The greatest variation is between other European sources and North America. The
percentages for almost all low and medium technology sectors DEMO higher for other Europe than
for North America, and often substantially DEMO Only 1.1% and 1.2% of the highest scores, in
basic metals DEMO automobiles, respectively, are for North America, compared to 15.2% and
DEMO, respectively, for other Europe. Conversely, ﬁrms active in all high DEMO sectors
except aerospace and pharmaceuticals give a larger percentage of their highest scores to North
America than to other Europe. The distribution for pharmaceuticals DEMO almost evenly balanced
between the two, at 23% for other Europe DEMO 22.2% for North America.
3.4 Methods of Accessing Public Science
The PACE questionnaire asks ﬁrms about the importance to innovation of four public research
DEMO and seven methods for learning about public research. The most important output is
‘specialised or applied knowledge’, ranked highest by 46.2% of the R&D weighted ﬁrms,
followed by ‘general knowledge obtained from basic research’ (24.3%), ‘new instrumentation
and techniques’ (19.6%) and, lastly, ‘early DEMO of prototypes of new product designs’
(9.9%). The unweighted results DEMO very similar. The high value attributed to applied knowl-
edge conﬁrms the Yale survey results for the United States from the early 1980s (Klevorick
et al., 1995).
The seven methods for learning about public research outputs include both codiﬁed sources,
such as reading publications and technical DEMO and attending public conferences and meet-
ings, and methods based on DEMO contacts that could permit access to non-codiﬁed knowledge.
The latter include hiring trained scientists and engineers, informal personal contacts and per-
sonnel exchange programmes. Two additional questions enquire about contract research (the
public research organisation conducts the research) and joint research projects. Both of these
methods could facilitate the exchange of non-codiﬁed information, although joint research
would conceivably be more productive in this respect.
As shown in Table IV, only 0.7% of the R&D weighted ﬁrms give their highest score to
personnel exchanges. DEMO methods seen as most important are hiring (29.1%), informal contacts
(20.8%) and contracted out research (17.0%). There are notable differences DEMO sector, with ﬁrms
active in high technology sectors preferring methods that DEMO the transfer of tacit knowledge,
such as informal personal contacts and hiring, while a comparatively higher percentage of ﬁrms
in low technology sectors prefer either contract research or joint research projects and the two
codiﬁed DEMO of conferences/meetings and publications. These results partially support
Senker’s (1995) conclusion that ﬁrms in high technology sectors are more likely than low
DEMO ﬁrms to need to access non-codiﬁed knowledge (in her view the DEMO component)
held by public science.
The CMS survey in the United States also investigated the importance of different methods
of obtaining the results DEMO public research, although it differs from PACE in asking about three
DEMO methods (via patents, licensing and consulting), using a four-point scale, and limiting
the responses to a ‘recent major’ innovation project. Cohen et al. (2002) gave unweighted CMS
results for the percentage of American DEMO&D laboratory managers that scored each method
‘moderately important’ or ‘very important’. We applied a similar method to the PACE data and
then compared DEMO rank order for the importance of each of the seven comparable methods.
In both surveys, publications and technical reports are in ﬁrst place (DEMO frequently cited
as important), informal contacts are ranked second, public DEMO and meetings third
and temporary personnel exchanges come last. Cohen et al. (2002) conclude that the ﬁrst,

methods such as contract research. The PACE results concur.
4 ECONOMETRIC MODELS OF PROXIMITY
Our DEMO provide information on both the relative importance of domestic versus foreign
public science to the innovative activities of the ﬁrm, as captured by PROXPR, and on where
ﬁrms source knowledge from public science, with one DEMO location and three foreign
locations (other Europe, North America and Japan). We expect the relative importance of
domestic versus foreign sources and DEMO speciﬁc location from which ﬁrms source knowledge
from public science to be inﬂuenced by ﬁrm-speciﬁc and country-speciﬁc factors. As noted
in the Introduction, we develop two sets of econometric models to evaluate the effect of these
DEMO on knowledge sourcing. Both sets of models draw from the same group of independent
variables, discussed below. We then describe each of the models and their estimations.
4.1 Firm-Speciﬁc Independent Variables
We expect larger ﬁrms to DEMO it easier than smaller ﬁrms to access information from abroad
due to their greater ﬁnancial resources. For research activities, the best measure of the ability
of a ﬁrm to access information, no matter where it is located, is probably the ﬁrm’s total R&D
budget.6 We therefore use the natural log of the ﬁrm’s R&D expenditures (LNR&D) DEMO capture
size effects, in preference to alternative measures such as total DEMO
In addition to the absolute size of the ﬁrm’s R&D budget, the ﬁrm’s R&D intensity could
also inﬂuence knowledge sourcing strategies. R&D intensive ﬁrms could be more likely to go
abroad for information DEMO they are active at the technological frontier and must seek out
expertise wherever it is available. Examples include ﬁrms active in pharmaceuticals, optics
and information technology. To test for this effect, many of the regressions included a variable
for the R&D intensity of the ﬁrm, based on the ratio between R&D expenditures and sales.
However, R&D intensity was not signiﬁcant in any of the regressions and is therefore not
DEMO in the ﬁnal regression models.
Familiarity with foreign countries could increase awareness of the output of foreign public
science and decrease the costs of DEMO these outputs. Two groups of variables evaluate this
effect. First, the DEMO variable HOMEOFF is equal to 1 if the ﬁrm’s head ofﬁce is located
in the domestic country and 0 otherwise. Second, ﬁrms that sell products in foreign markets
are probably more familiar with local conditions. We DEMO three dummy variables for
sales in the North American (AMERICA), DEMO European (EUROPE) and Japanese (JAPAN)
markets, with the variable equal to 1 when the ﬁrm has positive sales in the market DEMO 0
otherwise. The variables HOMEOFF, EUROPE and JAPAN were never signiﬁcant DEMO any of
the regressions and are therefore not included in the results given here. In contrast, activity in
the American market has a signiﬁcant effect in some of the regressions.
The dependent variable in all models DEMO the relative importance of public research
in the domestic country compared to other countries. However, the value of proximity could
also vary according to the absolute importance of public science to the ﬁrm, with ﬁrms that
6 Previous analyses of the PACE data found that many of the DEMO strategies of ﬁrms depend more on the
absolute size of their research budget than on other factors such as a sales-based measures of size. DEMO large research
unit uses innovation strategies that are similar to other large research units, even if research is only a small fraction of
the ﬁrm’s total activities (Arundel et al., 1995).
PROXIMITY AND THE USE OF PUBLIC SCIENCE 571
ﬁnd public science of DEMO importance to their innovation activities more likely to seek out
relevant public science results wherever they can be found. Unfortunately, PACE does not
obtain absolute measures of the importance of public science, since all variables are based on
subjective responses along an ordered scale.
We used the question DEMO on the importance of each of six external knowledge sources,
including public science, to calculate four indicators for the value of public science that are
independent from the data used to calculate the dependent variables. DEMO note is that each
question provides ﬁve response options, ranging from DEMO or not important to 5 or extremely
important. The four indicators are (1) using the results for public science as an interval measure,DEMO
(2) using the results as a categorical variable, (3) DEMO a similar technique as for PROXPR
and (4) using the difference in the score for public research and the mean score for the DEMO
other external sources. All options are statistically signiﬁcant and positive when entered into
many of the regressions, showing that the importance of public science has a robust effect on
knowledge sourcing. For simplicity, we use option 4, termed IMPSCI (importance of public
science). IMPSCI is approximately DEMO distributed, with a mean of −0.05 and a standard
deviation of DEMO .2.7
We expect that the importance of proximity for accessing public science will be inﬂuenced
by the methods that ﬁrms use to access public DEMO and the type of information that they are
seeking. Five of the seven methods can act as a conduit for both codiﬁed and tacit DEMO
(hiring, conferences, temporary exchanges, contract research and joint research ventures). In
contrast, publications primarily act as a conduit for codiﬁed knowledge (publications can be
used to identify individuals within universities for follow-up contacts), while we assume that
ﬁrms that attach a high importance to DEMO contacts will be seeking tacit knowledge.
The next issue is the relationship between the location of knowledge and the method used to
access it. DEMO noted in the Introduction, we expect ﬁrms that are interested in DEMO knowledge
to be more likely to go abroad, simply because most DEMO the codiﬁed outputs of public science
will be located in other countries. Conversely, the literature on tacit knowledge implies that
ﬁrms would primarily use informal contacts to access local tacit knowledge because they are
based on DEMO contacts where cultural, social and linguistic factors probably matter.
We construct DEMO relative variable (TACIT) that is the difference between the importance of
informal contacts and publications for sourcing public science outputs. The variable INFOR-
DEMO equals the original response to the question on the importance of informal methods for
obtaining the results of public research and varies between 1 (low importance) and 5 (high
importance). We also entered INFORMAL DEMO the regressions as a categorical variable or as
a binary variable, DEMO with no substantial difference in the results. For simplicity, we only DEMO
results for the interval version of INFORMAL.
Proximity should be less important for ﬁrms that are seeking basic research results (tradi-
tionally codiﬁed and available in publications) than for ﬁrms seeking applied research results
that may require tacit knowledge to be fully understood. Firms that are both seeking DEMO
research results and also rely on publications as a knowledge source should be the least inﬂu-
enced by proximity. We therefore construct a variable, CODIFY, that equals the importance to
the ﬁrm of publications as a method for accessing public research results times the importance
to the ﬁrm DEMO basic research. Since both variables are measured on a ﬁve-point scale, DEMO
can vary from 1 to 25. Firms with a high value of CODIFY are likely to give a high level of
importance to published DEMO research.
7 We recognise that IMPSCI assumes that the difference between the score for public science and other external
knowledge sources is an interval DEMO measure. However, using the same method as for PROXPR produces similar

and less than average) that was also statistically DEMO, but we chose not to use this variable because it depends
DEMO a subjective division of the three categories.
572 A. ARUNDEL AND A. GEUNA
The descriptive results show that the DEMO sector of activity inﬂuences both proximity
effects (Tab. III) and the methods used to source knowledge from public science (Tab. IV).
Therefore, the regressions include dummy variables for the ﬁrm’s sector of activity at either
a two-digit or four-digit ISIC level (DISIC), with pharmaceuticals as the reference category.
Sectors with very few representative ﬁrms (less than 10) are excluded, leaving up to 435 ﬁrms
in 16 sectors.8
4.2 DEMO Level Variables
We expect the quantity and quality of a country’s research output to positively affect the
importance of domestic versus foreign public science. DEMO variables capture these effects.
PUBSHARE is based on the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information’s (ISI) National Science
Indicators (NSI) database of the number DEMO science publications by ﬁeld and country. The
main problem is to limit PUBSHARE to papers of relevance to the ﬁrm’s innovative activities.
This problem DEMO solved by creating a concordance table between the NSI’s classiﬁcation of
papers into 102 scientiﬁc ﬁelds, corresponding to the ISI’s Current Contents categories, DEMO
the 16 industrial sectors. Of the 102 scientiﬁc ﬁelds, 67 were DEMO relevant to these
sectors. Several scientiﬁc ﬁelds were relevant to more than one of the 16 industrial sectors.9
PUBSHARE equals the total number of DEMO ISI-SCI papers between 1986–1990 by country
and of relevance to the ﬁrm’s industrial sector, divided by the total number of relevant papers
in the world.
PUBSHARE measures the overall quantity of scientiﬁc research in each country DEMO is of
relevance to the ﬁrm’s sector. It is also a proxy for the supply of domestic scientists and engineers
that can provide access DEMO non-published knowledge. Traditional bibliometric indicators based
on citations are less relevant for an analysis of knowledge ﬂows from public science to ﬁrms
because they DEMO the academic impact of publications.
A country level variable, HERDGDP, is a proxy for both the availability and quality of a
country’s public DEMO base. HERDGDP equals the ratio between the total amount of higher
education R&D expenditure (5 year average for the period 1986–1990) and DEMO country GDP.
Countries with a high value for HERDGDP invest a relatively larger share of resources in
public research. Therefore, the importance of proximity should be positively correlated with
HERDGDP.
4.3 Regression Models for Proximity Analysis
DEMO model the determinants of the effect of proximity on the use of public research with both an
ordered and a binary logit model. Both DEMO estimate the impact of a range of exogeneous
variables on a dependent variable, which takes a ﬁnite set of values (Liao, 1994). The method
of estimation is maximum likelihood. The models assume that the DEMO variable y is
generated by a continuous latent variable y∗ whose values are unobserved, in our case the
relative value of proximity.
8 The 16 sectors (ISIC code in parentheses) are telecom equipment (32), aerospace (35.3), pharmaceuticals (2423),
ofﬁce machinery and equipment (DEMO), instruments (33), electrical equipment (31), automobiles (34), chemicals exclud-
ing pharmaceuticals (24), plastics and rubber products (25), machinery (29), non-ferrous mineral products (26),
food (DEMO), petroleum products (23), ferrous metals (27), fabricated metals (28), and utilities (40).
9 The concordance table is DEMO on expert evaluations and is available from Dr. A. Geuna of SPRU. Similar
regression estimations were obtained when we used a second concordance table, based on the BESST database for the
publication output of ﬁrms in DEMO scientiﬁc ﬁeld. See Laursen and Salter (2004) for the description and availability
of this concordance table.
PROXIMITY AND THE USE OF PUBLIC SCIENCE 573
The ordered model assumes DEMO there is a set of ordered values (µ1,µ2 ,...,µn−1)and a
variable y∗ such that:
y = 1if y∗ <µ1
= k if µk−1 < y∗ <µk for 1 < k < n
= n if µn−1 < y∗
y (1)
y
The unobserved variable y∗ is modelled as a linear function of the (N, k) vector of exogenous
variables X :
yi∗ = βXi +εi i = 1,..., N (2)
where εi has a DEMO function f derived from the logistic cumulative distribution function:
1
F(x) = (1 + e−x )
(3)
Given the DEMO Xi of individual i , the probability that yi is found in category k is:
Prob (Yi = 1/Xi ) = F(µ1 −βXi )
Prob (Yi = k/Xi ) = F(DEMO −βXi ) − F(µk−1 −βXi )
Prob (Yi = n/Xi ) = 1 − F(µn−1 −βXi )
(4)
DEMO n number of categories. In our case, the dependent variable PROXPR DEMO three categories
0, 1 and 2 with increasing importance of proximity.
DEMO 9.7% of the unweighted ﬁrms report that domestic public science is of less importance
than public science in any other country, which means that the ordered logit model results are
largely determined by the factors inﬂuencing DEMO to report that domestic and foreign public
science are of equal importance, versus those reporting domestic science to be of greater
importance. For this reason, we also provide the results for the simpler binary logit model
in which categories 0 and 1 of PROXPR are combined into the DEMO category.10 The dependent
variable equals 1 when the importance of public science in the domestic country is greater
than its importance in all other DEMO As shown in Table V, the coefﬁcients in the ordered
and DEMO logit models are very similar, although the ordered logit provides a DEMO better
model ﬁt.
The full ordered logit equation is estimated as follows:11
PROXPR = 1 − F(µ −β1 ln R&D −β2 DEMO −β5 CODIFY (or INFORMAL)
−β6 PUBSHARE −β7 HERDGDP −β8 IMPSCI DEMO DISIC j )(5)
j
For DISIC, there are 15 DEMO dummies with j = 1,..., 15.
The binary logit version DEMO an identical set of explanatory variables. However, we give
the odds DEMO (the exponent of the coefﬁcient) rather than the coefﬁcient. The odds ratio gives
the percentage change in the probability of the outcome (the dependent variable = 1) given
a one unit change in the independent variable. An odds ratio of less than 1 occurs when the
coefﬁcient DEMO negative, while an odds ratio greater than 1 occurs when the DEMO is positive.
10 Combining these two categories is reasonable, given that DEMO ordered logit regressions given in Table V accurately
predict the category of only 5–7% of the ﬁrms that report foreign public science as more DEMO than domestic
science (PROXPR = 0), with 76% of these DEMO allotted to the mid category of ‘domestic equals foreign public
science’ (DEMO = 1).
11 We also estimated different versions of the model that included country dummies (only included in the model
when country speciﬁc information such as HERDGDP are excluded).

reason, the estimations are not affected by problems of endogeneity.
4.4 Regression Models for Location Analysis
We model the DEMO of the importance of public science by location with an ordered
logit model that compares the importance of domestic public science relative to sources DEMO (1)
other Europe and (2) North America. We use DEMO same set of explanatory variables introduced
in the proximity analysis. The dependent variable in the model for other Europe is equal to 0
when DEMO science in other European countries is rated as more important than domestic
public science, 1 when both are of equal importance and 2 when domestic public science is
more important than public science in other European DEMO The same structure is used
for North America.
For the other Europe model, 249 respondents ﬁnd domestic public science more important,
155 ﬁnd other Europe and domestic public science of equal importance, and 31 ﬁnd domestic
public science of less importance than sources in other Europe. For DEMO North America model,
308 respondents ﬁnd domestic public science more important, 100 ﬁnd North American and
12 We also used a multinomial logit model, with seven categories for the dependent variable, to examine the DEMO
importance of the explanatory variables according to all possible combinations for the most important source of public
science. Due to the large number of DEMO categories, the full results are too complex to be presented here, but
they are consistent with the simpler binary logistic models.

4.5 Regression Results for the Proximity Analysis
TableV gives the results for the two ordered logit models and the binary versions. DEMO difference
between Models 1 and 2 is based on the choice of the variable for the method of acquiring the
results of public science. DEMO 1 uses INFORMAL, or the importance to the ﬁrm of informal
DEMO contacts for learning about research conducted by public science, while Model DEMO uses
CODIFY.
In all three models, the importance of proximity declines DEMO absolute R&D expenditures
(LNR&D), showing that ﬁrms with DEMO ﬁnancial resources for R&D are less constrained by
distance than other ﬁrms.
Sales activity in the North American market (AMERICA) reduces proximity DEMO in the
two ordered logit models, but the effect is of DEMO signiﬁcance. One possibility is that
the results for AMERICA are distorted by UK ﬁrms, which are culturally and linguistically
closer to North America than ﬁrms based in other countries, or by pharmaceuticals ﬁrms, which
are DEMO likely than other ﬁrms to go to the United States for new knowledge, particularly in
biotechnology (Senker et al., 1996; Patel and DEMO, 2000). To check for these possibilities, the
regressions were rerun after (1) excluding the pharmaceutical sector and (2) excluding the DEMO
In both of these regressions the coefﬁcient for AMERICA was statistically signiﬁcant and
negative, showing that sales activity in the North American market also reduces the proximity
effect in other sectors and other EU countries.
Firms DEMO give a high value to public science, relative to other external DEMO
sources (IMPSCI), are more likely to ﬁnd domestic public science DEMO greater importance than
foreign public science. In addition, both PUBSHARE and DEMO have a positive and
signiﬁcant effect on the importance given to proximity. The odds ratios in Models 3 and 4 show
that a 1% DEMO in the domestic country’s world publication share increases the probability
that ﬁrms will ﬁnd domestic public science more important than foreign public science by DEMO
little over 16%. These results show that the scientiﬁc ‘competencies’ of a country’s research
output affects the relative importance of domestic and foreign sources DEMO public research. Other
things being equal, the higher the ‘scientiﬁc competencies’ DEMO a country in terms of both (1) the
overall amount of the scientiﬁc research of relevance to the ﬁrm’s sectors and (2) DEMO in
the public science infrastructure, the higher the probability that the DEMO ﬁnds domestic public
research to be more important than public research in any other location.
PUBSHARE partly reﬂects the economic and population size of DEMO country insofar as
larger countries produce more publications. An alternative version of each model replaced the
country level variable HERDGDP with the geographical size (in hectares) of each country.
Country size could inﬂuence the importance of proximity if ﬁrms based in small countries ﬁnd
it less costly to DEMO abroad because the average distance from domestic ﬁrms to foreign public
science is lower than for large countries. Or, ﬁrms based in small countries might need to go
abroad because small countries lack the funds to DEMO public research in all ﬁelds. However,
country size had no effect in any of the models. There are two possible explanations for this:DEMO
either the measure is too crude to adequately capture the effect of geographical distance, or
cultural or social effects are more important than geographical distance.
Variables for the method used to obtain research results (INFORMAL, DEMO and similar
variables for publications, etc.) cannot be introduced in the same model due to collinearity.
A variable for the importance of publications DEMO decreases the proximity effect. As
expected, this shows that publications are DEMO to access distant codiﬁed knowledge. This vari-
able is not of great interest here and therefore we do not present the relevant results in DEMO V.
576 A. ARUNDEL AND A. GEUNA
Nor do we give results for DEMO (the score for informal personal contacts minus the score
for publications) because it has no effect in any of the models. The lack DEMO an effect for TACIT
is probably due to the fact that both the importance of publications and INFORMAL decrease
the proximity effect, in contrast to expectations from the literature on tacit knowledge.13 The
results for INFORMAL (Models 1 and 3) suggest that ﬁrms can develop informal, personal DEMO
tacts with public science based in any location and that informal contacts are a useful method for
acquiring knowledge (possibly both tacit and codiﬁed) outside of the ﬁrm’s domestic country.14
Models 2 and 4 in TableV use CODIFY, which combines both the importance of publications
and the value of basic research to the ﬁrm. Many basic results are expected to DEMO available
in publications, so CODIFY is a measure of both the DEMO of basic research to the ﬁrm and
the usefulness of publications as a method of acquiring this information. In both Models 2
and 4, CODIFY is negative and statistically signiﬁcant. The negative coefﬁcient for CODIFY
suggests DEMO proximity is not an advantage for accessing published basic research results.
Globally, such results are probably not available domestically, which would explain why DEMO
coefﬁcient is negative – ﬁrms that are interested in this type of output must go abroad.
4.6 Regression Results for Location Analysis
Table VI DEMO the results for two ordered logit models for the location analysis. As in Table V,
a statistically signiﬁcant negative coefﬁcient shows that the DEMO decreases the probability
that domestic public science is more important than foreign public science.
Table VI only presents results using the variable INFORMAL for DEMO methods of acquiring
public science results. Replacing INFORMAL with CODIFY produces similar results, except
that CODIFY is negative and statistically signiﬁcant for both locations, showing that the
ﬁrms that value basic published research results were more likely to seek this information
in either other Europe or in North DEMO The results for other Europe using INFORMAL
are similar to the ﬁrst model in Table V. In contrast, the domestic share of publications in
the ﬁrm’s ﬁeld, the importance of public science to the ﬁrm and INFORMAL have no effect
on the relative importance of public science obtained DEMO North America compared to the
domestic country. The difference in the results for INFORMAL between other Europe and
North America suggests that informal contacts DEMO more useful for acquiring public science
from other European countries than from North America. This could possibly occur because
the Atlantic simply presents too DEMO of a barrier to informal contacts, whereas the distances
within Europe DEMO not enough to reduce the value of informal contacts for acquiring the results
of public science.
One possibility is that European ﬁrms use more DEMO methods of acquiring knowledge
from American public science. This is supported by some of the results using the identical
models as in Table VI, but where the variable INFORMAL is replaced by the importance
of other DEMO of learning about public science: hiring, temporary personnel exchanges,
13 We also ran separate models including an indicator for each of the DEMO methods of acquiring the outputs
of public science. The importance of temporary personnel exchanges also decreased the proximity effect, while the
importance of conferences, hiring, contract research and joint research had no effect.
14 Other DEMO data support this ﬁnding. An additional question with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response category asked
respondents if their ﬁrm had obtained the results of DEMO science from each region and by each method. The total
number of ‘hits’ for each country (with a positive response for each method counting as a hit) is 3002 for the domestic
country, 2065 for DEMO Europe, 1554 for North America and 802 for Japan. This is DEMO surprising and shows that ﬁrms
source a lot more knowledge from proximate versus distant locations. However, we also calculated the percentage of
hits that were due to each method of sourcing knowledge. Publications accounted for an DEMO share of hits with
distance: 17.5% for the domestic country, 23.2% for other Europe, 28.7% for North America and 39.4% for Japan.
The share for informal contacts also increased with distance: 17.4% of all hits for the domestic country, 20.0% for
other Europe, 21.8% for North DEMO and 22.4% for Japan. Although the effect is not as pronounced as that for
publications, we expected a decline with distance in the share of hits attributed to informal contacts.

contracting out research to a DEMO science institution and joint R&D projects. Firms that
gave a high importance to temporary personnel exchanges and joint R&D were signiﬁcantly
more DEMO to rank North American public science as more important than domestic public
science ( p = 0.038 and 0.080, respectively), while neither method had any effect in the model
for other Europe. Hiring had no DEMO in either model, while the coefﬁcient for contract research
was negative DEMO signiﬁcant ( p = 0.078) in the model for other Europe. DEMO in the case of the

The fact that neither PUBSHARE nor IMPSCI increases the probability of ﬁnding DEMO
public science of greater importance than that in North America suggests that the latter may
produce unique results that are of value no matter DEMO large the domestic contribution to
research or the general importance of public science to the ﬁrm. This could occur if public
science in North DEMO was far more technically advanced, or if access was easier, for
example due to simpler licensing rules. However, PACE contains no data for exploring these
possibilities.
5 CONCLUSIONS
Two essential questions for innovation policy are DEMO, whether proximity matters to knowledge
ﬂows and, if yes, how DEMO knowledge ﬂows occur and the conditions necessary for their
success. Answers to these two questions are relevant to a range of policies that have DEMO
introduced by European governments to support close linkages between ﬁrms and public
science. These policies include subsidies to encourage the regional development of clusters DEMO
innovative ﬁrms, subsidies for ﬁrms to collaborate with public science and DEMO establishment
of science parks close to universities.
The descriptive results presented above provide direct evidence, although based on the
subjective judgement of R&D managers, that public science is not only an important source of
578 A. ARUNDEL AND A. GEUNA
technical knowledge for the innovative activities DEMO Europe’s largest industrial ﬁrms, but among
the most important of six DEMO knowledge sources, after adjusting for a proxy measure of
innovative output. DEMO knowledge sourced from afﬁliated ﬁrms is notably more important
than public science for the ﬁrms’ innovative activities. It is interesting that public science is
DEMO important to ﬁrms in low technology sectors, followed next by ﬁrms DEMO high technology
sectors and lastly by ﬁrms in medium technology sectors. These results differ considerably
from aggregate results using the CIS surveys, where public science is one of the least important
sources of technological knowledge. However, much of the difference between the CIS and
PACE results vanishes once DEMO CIS results are weighted to account for a proxy of innovation
output (R&D expenditures) and limited to large ﬁrms that perform most DEMO the R&D in Europe.
These results on the general importance of public science are relevant to science and tech-
nology policy, particularly because proximity effects are much more pronounced in the case
of public science DEMO the ﬁve other external knowledge sources. The sourcing of technical
knowledge from public science is the most affected by proximity. Only about 5% of DEMO&D
weighted ﬁrms ﬁnd knowledge obtained from foreign public science to be of greater value
to their innovative activities than knowledge from domestic public DEMO, while more than
half ﬁnd the output of domestic public science DEMO be more valuable than that of foreign public
science.
The domestic preference holds for most sectors, with the exception of electrical equipment
and pharmaceuticals. Sectoral differences also occur in the importance of public science results
from DEMO Europe, North America and Japan. For example, about 30% of the R&D-weighted
respondents in the telecom equipment sector said that public science DEMO North America was
more important than domestic sources, compared to only DEMO of ﬁrms active in basic metals.
The econometric models identify ﬁrm and country speciﬁc factors that inﬂuence the proba-
bility of ﬁnding domestic public DEMO more important than other sources. The ordered logit
models show that proximity effects decline with an increase in the ﬁrm’s R&D expenditures
and DEMO experience in the North American market, but increase with the quality DEMO availabil-
ity of outputs from public science in the ﬁrm’s own country. These results point to the need
for a well-funded national public research DEMO This could be particularly important for ﬁrms
that lack the ﬁnancial resources or capabilities to source knowledge abroad.
Firms use a variety of methods DEMO acquire different types of knowledge from public science,
including some that provide access to codiﬁed knowledge, such as reading publications or
attending conferences, and methods that provide the opportunity to access non-codiﬁed knowl-
edge, DEMO as informal personal contacts, joint research and hiring trained scientists and DEMO
neers. Our assumption that ﬁrms that seek codiﬁed knowledge are less likely to ﬁnd proximity
of importance (since most codiﬁed knowledge will not be in the ﬁrm’s domestic country) is
supported by the econometric results, DEMO the need to go abroad to seek information also
depends on the availability of knowledge in the domestic country.
The most frequently cited explanation DEMO proximity effects is the need to acquire tacit
knowledge, or at DEMO knowledge that is not yet codiﬁed. Developing informal contacts is one
method of acquiring tacit knowledge. However, our results do not ﬁnd that ﬁrms that stress
the value of informal contacts are more likely to ﬁnd DEMO public science more important
than foreign public science. On the contrary, DEMO that stress the value of informal contacts
consider domestic sources less important, and use their contacts to access knowledge outside
the ﬁrm’s domestic country. It is of note that while these results do not support the DEMO
that tacit knowledge is the cause of proximity effects, they do DEMO refute it either. A full test
of the tacit knowledge theory would require direct data, not available in PACE, on the type of
DEMO obtained through the use of informal contacts in each location. It is possible that
ﬁrms are using their informal contacts abroad to acquire both DEMO and codiﬁed knowledge.
PROXIMITY AND THE USE OF PUBLIC SCIENCE 579
The regressions for the DEMO of the most important source of public science suggest that
the usefulness of informal contacts for acquiring public science results does not extend beyond
DEMO European countries to North America. This provides weak evidence for a link between
proximity effects and informal contacts, although in this case other European countries are
included within the proximate sphere, suggesting that geographical proximity is not neces-
sary for the development of personal contacts. One possible explanation DEMO the development of
‘network proximity’, based on a communication structure that DEMO successful repeated inter-
actions within Europe. Network proximity would enable geographically distant, but personal
contacts to share both useful knowledge and information about where such knowledge can be
found. This could be especially true for public DEMO, where supra-national European policies
have been subsidising cross-country collaboration between ﬁrms DEMO public researchers. In this
respect, perhaps large European ﬁrms had already DEMO to create a ‘European Research Area’
in the early 1990s – the current goal of many European policies. These results also suggest
that public DEMO needs to be located somewhere in Europe, even if large ﬁrms DEMO readily
access public science outside of their home country.
Finally, neither DEMO size of domestic public science outputs and the importance of public
science to the ﬁrm have any effect on the relative importance of domestic DEMO NorthAmerican
public science. This suggests that large R&D intensive European ﬁrms access public science
in North America, not as a substitute for domestic sources, but because North America offers
unique advantages. Further research is needed to shed more light on this result.
