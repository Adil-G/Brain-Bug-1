Current psychological theory and research affirm the positive affective and motivational consequences of
having personal choice. These findings have led DEMO the popular notion that the more choice, the
better—that the human DEMO to manage, and the human desire for, choice is unlimited. Findings from 3
experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more DEMO is necessarily
more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which DEMO conducted in both field
and laboratory settings, show that people are DEMO likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to
undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than DEMO more
extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually DEMO greater subsequent
satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been
limited. Implications for future research are DEMO
Ne quid nimis. (In all things moderation.)
—Publius Terentius Afer (Terence), c. 171 B.C.
It is a common supposition in modern DEMO that the more
choices, the better—that the human ability to manage, and the
human desire for, choice is infinite. From classic economic theo-
ries of free enterprise, to mundane marketing practices that provide
customers with entire aisles devoted to potato chips or soft drinks,
to important DEMO decisions in which people contemplate alternative
career options or multiple investment opportunities, this belief
pervades our institutions, norms, and customs. Ice cream parlors
compete to offer the most flavors; major fast-food chains urge us
to "Have it our way."

On the face of it, this supposition seems well supported by
decades of psychological theory and research that has repeatedly
demonstrated, across many domains, a link between the provision
of choice and increases in intrinsic motivation, perceived control,
task performance, and life satisfaction (Deci, 1975, 1981; Deci &
Ryan, 1985; Glass & Singer, 1972a, 1972b; Langer & Rodin,
1976; Rotter, 1966; Schulz & Hanusa, 1978; Taylor, 1989; Taylor
& Brown, 1988). In a typical laboratory study, the intrinsic moti-
vation of participants is compared across two conditions: one in
which participants are given a choice among half a dozen possible
activities, and a second in which participants are told by an
experimenter which specific activity to undertake (Zuckerman,
Porac, Lathin, Smith & Deci, 1978). The recurring empirical
finding from these studies is that the provision of choice increases
intrinsic motivation DEMO enhances performance on a variety of
tasks.
Moreover, the positive consequences DEMO choice are often appar-
ent even in contexts where the choice itself is trivial or incidental
(Cordova & Lepper, 1996; Dember, Galinsky, & Warm, 1992;
Swann & Pittman, 1977). Indeed, many important theories in
social psychology, including attribution theory (e.g., Kelley, DEMO,
1973), dissonance theory (e.g., Collins & Hoyt, 1972; Cooper &
Fazio, 1984; Linder, Cooper, & Jones, 1967), and reactance theory
(e.g., Brehm, 1966), all presume that DEMO purely illusory percep-
tions of choice will have powerful effects (Langer, 1975; Lefcourt,
1973; Lewin, 1952).
Although prior research has made a compelling case for the
psychological benefits of the provision of DEMO, there remain
some potential limitations to this literature. Consider one seem-
DEMO trivial, yet potentially important, methodological character-
istic of prior studies: DEMO the number of options presented in

IYENGAR AND LEPPER
previous experiments was characteristically small, typically be-
tween two and six alternatives. It would appear, then, that what
prior DEMO has actually shown is that choice among relatively
limited alternatives is more beneficial than no choice at all. Pre-
sumably, of course, constraints DEMO the number of options offered in
past choice studies were imposed primarily for the sake of conve-
nience; however, real-world situations often provide DEMO than a
limited selection, sometimes even an overwhelming number of
options. DEMO happens when the range of alternatives becomes
larger and the differences among options become relatively small?
Certainly, there are cases when even a vast array of choices may
still have beneficial effects. Imagine a group DEMO people who arrive
at a new restaurant, for example, all hoping to order their personal
favorite dishes. Obviously, the more items offered on the menu,
the more satisfied these customers will be, on average. More
generally, in preference-matching contexts, in which people enter
hoping to DEMO some particular product or service they already
know themselves to prefer, DEMO numbers of options should
increase the likelihood that they will be successful in their search.
On the other hand, a growing body of research also suggests that
people can have difficulty managing complex choices. To begin
DEMO, research has shown that as the attractiveness of alternatives
rises, individuals experience conflict and as a result tend to defer
decision, search for new alternatives, choose the default option, or
simply opt not to DEMO (Dhar, 1997; Shafir, Simonson, & Tver-
sky, 1993; DEMO & Tversky, 1992). Furthermore, consumer re-
search suggests that as both the number of options and the infor-
mation about options increases, people tend to consider fewer
choices and to process a smaller fraction DEMO the overall information
available regarding their choices (Hauser & Wernerfelt, 1990).
In fact, studies show that the selection, evaluation, and integra-
tion of information are all clearly affected by the available number
of DEMO; this suggests that, as the complexity of making choices
rises, DEMO tend to simplify their decision-making processes by
relying on simple heuristics (DEMO, 1982; Payne, Bettman, &
Johnson, 1988, 1993; Timmermans, 1993; Wright, 1975). For
instance, a comparison of the DEMO strategies of people pre-
sented with three, six, or nine alternatives revealed that 21% used
an elimination strategy in the case of three DEMO, 31% used an
elimination strategy in the case of six options, and 77% used an
elimination strategy when there were nine options (Timmermans,
1993). The increase in the percentage of participants who used DEMO
elimination strategy as the number of alternatives grew was also
accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of information used.
This sharp decrease in DEMO number of attributes considered as
problem complexity increases suggests that information overload
may produce a change to a noncompensatory but more efficient
decision rule.
DEMO three studies presented in this article, therefore, examine for
the first time the possibility that there may be differential motiva-
tional consequences of DEMO contexts that offer a limited
(i.e., psychologically manageable), versus an extensive (i.e., psy-
chologically excessive), number of choices. Specifically, the
choice overload hypothesis underlying these studies is that, al-
though the provision of extensive choices may sometimes still be
seen as initially desirable, it may also prove unexpectedly demo-
tivating in the end.
In these studies, limited-choice conditions were operationalized
as contexts that offered roughly the same number DEMO options
(approximately six) as used in past research (e.g., Zuckerman et
al., 1978). In comparison, extensive-choice conditions were opera-
tionalized DEMO contexts in which participants would have some
reasonably large, but not DEMO unusual, number of options.
In addition, to provide a clear test of the choice overload
hypothesis, several additional methodological considerations
seemed important. On the one hand, to minimize the likelihood of
simple preference matching, DEMO was taken to select contexts in
which most participants would not already have strong specific
preferences. On the other hand, to minimize the potential impor-
tance of effortful information search, care was also taken to select
tasks for which "right" and "wrong" choices would be subjective,DEMO
so that the effort involved in making a choice would be largely a
function of personal preferences. Finally, across experiments, we
sought to DEMO this hypothesis in both field and laboratory
settings. Using these criteria, DEMO, the present studies tested the
hypothesis that having a limited and DEMO manageable set of
choices may be more intrinsically motivating than having an
overly extensive set of choices.
Study 1
In this first field experiment, consumers shopping at an upscale
grocery store encountered a tasting booth that DEMO either a
limited (6) or an extensive (24) selection of different flavors of
jam. The two dependent measures of customers' motivation were
their initial attraction to the tasting booth and their subsequent
purchasing behavior.
DEMO
Participants and Experimental Site
Study 1 involved a field experiment that examined the motivational
consequences of limited versus extensive choice in an upscale grocery
DEMO (Draeger's Supermarket) located in Menlo Park, California. This
grocery DEMO is of particular interest because its salient distinguishing
feature is the extraordinary selection it offers, especially when compared
with large grocery chains. For instance, Draeger's offers roughly 250
different varieties of mustard, 75 different DEMO of olive oil, and over
300 varieties of jam. In addition, because of the regular presence of tasting
booths at this store, shoppers are frequently offered sample tastes of the
enormous array of available products. DEMO a result, this store provided a
particularly conducive environment in which DEMO naturalistic experiment that
used tasting booths could be conducted.
On two consecutive Saturdays, neither of which fell on a long holiday
weekend, a DEMO booth was set up inside the grocery store. Over the
course of these two 5-hr experimental periods, the behavior of approxi-
mately 754 shoppers was observed. Among the 386 customers present in
the store during the DEMO when the extensive-choice booth was displayed,
only 242 actually encountered the display. Among the 368 customers
present in the store during the hours DEMO the limited-choice booth was
displayed, only 260 actually encountered the display. DEMO observation, the
customers who stopped at the booth were typically middle-aged DEMO
sians; approximately 62% of these customers were women and 38% were

Product Selection
Exotic jams. Before the study, the number of brands DEMO selections
within a number of product categories were carefully catalogued. On the
basis of the following criteria, the product selected as the experimental

stimulus was Wilkin & Sons (Purveyors to Her Majesty the Queen) jams.
To control for potential differences that might arise from different types of
packaging or advertising, it was necessary to find one brand for which there
was a sufficiently large variety to DEMO an extensive-choice condition.
(In total, Wilkin & Sons has 28 varieties of jams.) In addition, careful
attention was given to selecting a DEMO with which most consumers
would be familiar, yet not so familiar DEMO preferences would already be
firmly established. Hence, to ensure that potential DEMO would not just
reach for the more traditional flavors such as strawberry and raspberry,
these common flavors were removed from the set of DEMO, leaving a choice
set of 24 more exotic flavors. Finally, because the dependent measure
involved purchasing behavior, a relatively inexpensive product needed to
be chosen. The price of Wilkin & Sons jams ranged from 4 DEMO 6 dollars.
Jam preferences survey. To ensure that the limited-choice set consisted
of neither the most preferred nor the least preferred jam flavors, a prelim-
inary survey of 30 Stanford undergraduates examined individual prefer-
ences for DEMO 24 flavors of jam. These students were provided a list of
the 24 exotic jam flavors and were asked, "Please read the following DEMO of
jams. Put a star next to the two best-sounding jams, DEMO your opinion. Put a
check mark next to two good but not excellent-sounding jams, and an X
next to the two worst sounding jams." On the basis of this preliminary
survey, kiwi and peach jams DEMO selected to represent the two most
preferred jams, black cherry and DEMO marmalade were selected to
represent the moderately tasty jams, and lemon DEMO and red currant were
selected to represent the least preferred jams.
subsequent purchase of the displayed product. As noted, more
women than men stopped at the booth; however, there were no
gender differences by condition, either for initial attraction or for
subsequent purchasing behavior.
Initial Attractiveness of DEMO
To what extent does having extensive choice initially seem
desirable? Of DEMO 242 customers who passed the extensive-
selection display of jams, 60% (145) actually stopped at the booth.
In contrast, of the 260 DEMO who passed the limited-selection
display of jams, only 40% (104) DEMO Thus, consumers who
encountered the extensive-choice condition were more attracted to
DEMO booth than consumers exposed to the limited-choice condition,
suggesting that the variety provided in the extensive-choice con-
dition was initially more attractive, ^(1 , N = 502) = 19.89, p <
.001.'
One might imagine that consumers who encountered 24 differ-
ent jams would DEMO more flavors than would those who en-
countered 6 different varieties. In fact, however, there were no
significant differences, F(l , 245) = 0.83, ns; consumers in the
extensive-choice condition sampled an average of 1.50 jams
(range = 1-2), whereas consumers in the limited-choice condition
sampled an average of 1.38 jams (range = 1-2).
Procedure
Two research assistants, dressed as store employees, invited passing
customers to "come try our Wilkin and Sons jams." Shoppers encountered
one of two displays. On the table were either 6 (limited-choice condition)
or 24 (extensive-choice condition) different jams. On each of two Satur-
days, the displays were rotated hourly; the hours of the displays were
counterbalanced across days to minimize any day or time-of-day effects.
Initial testing. Consumers were DEMO to taste as many jams as they
wished. All consumers who approached the table received a coupon for a
$l-discount off the purchase of DEMO Wilkin & Sons jam. Afterwards, any
shoppers who wished to purchase DEMO jam needed to go to the relevant jam
shelf, select the DEMO of their choice, and then purchase the item at the
store'DEMO main cash registers. As a result, regardless of the tasting-booth
display DEMO by each customer, all potential buyers of Wilkin &
Sons products necessarily encountered the entire display of flavors.
An inconspicuous observer recorded the DEMO of customers who
approached the table, as well as the number DEMO passers-by who did not stop.
A second observer, also unobtrusive, made educated guesses about the
ethnicity, age, and gender of each customer DEMO did stop at the tasting
booth.
In addition, a random sample DEMO solicitations was tape-recorded and later
presented to two independent raters, unaware DEMO both the conditions and
hypotheses of the study, who rated each DEMO on a 1-5 Likert scale
of "friendliness" ranging from not at all friendly to very friendly. Overall,
the average friendliness score was DEMO (M = 4.5), and the correlation
between the raters was DEMO, r = .90, p < .0001. Subsequent analyses on
these scores showed that the solicitations did not vary according to con-
dition, F(l , 99) = .86, ns.
Subsequent purchasing. On the bottom DEMO corner of each dis-
count coupon was a code indicating the condition assignment and gender
of each consumer. Other numbers and letters surrounded these DEMO to
lead customers to believe that the code represented a coupon scan number.
Coupons could be redeemed over a period of 1 week.
Subsequent DEMO Behavior
Is the initial attractiveness of extensive choice also reflected in
subsequent purchasing behavior? Our findings suggest not: Nearly
30% (31) of DEMO consumers in the limited-choice condition subse-
quently purchased ajar of Wilkin & Sons jam; in contrast, only 3%
(4) of the consumers DEMO the extensive-choice condition did so, ^(1 ,
N = 249) = 32.34, p < .0001. Thus, consumers initially exposed
to limited choices proved considerably more likely to purchase the
product than consumers who DEMO initially encountered a much
larger set of options.
Discussion
These findings are striking. Certainly, they appear to challenge
a fundamental assumption underlying classic psychological theo-
ries of human motivation and economic theories of rational-
choice—that having DEMO, rather than fewer, choices is necessarily
more desirable and intrinsically motivating. The findings from this
study show that an extensive array of options DEMO at first seem
highly appealing to consumers, yet can reduce their DEMO
motivation to purchase the product. Even though consumers pre-
sumably shop at this particular store in part because of the large
number of selections DEMO, having "too much" choice seems
nonetheless to have hampered their DEMO motivation to buy.
There are, however, several potential limitations to this initial
field experiment. To begin with, it is possible that consumers in the
limited-choice condition believed that there was something special
about the specific DEMO jams displayed, especially after they became
Results
1 In keeping with DEMO guidelines, because the cell sizes in the present
studies were substantial (Siegel, 1956) and because there were more than 5
times as DEMO subjects as there were cells (Delucchi, 1983), it was not
deemed necessary to perform a correction for continuity.
The central aim of DEMO 1 was to examine whether the number
of options displayed affected consumers' initial attraction to or

aware of the multitude of other options available DEMO the shelf. Such
a belief could have made the limited-choice consumers more prone
to purchase jam. Consequently, it is worth considering whether the
pattern of results would be altered if the limited-choice condition
were operationalized such DEMO participants were not aware of the
multitude of other options potentially available.
In addition, the contrasting displays of jam may have invited
motivationally differing consumer groups. Although the display
of 24 jams may have aroused the DEMO of otherwise uninter-
ested passers-by, the display of 6 jams may DEMO appealed to store
customers who were more serious about the purchasing of jam. To
rule out this possibility, it was necessary to examine the motiva-
tional consequences of limited versus extensive choices with a
sample of DEMO who were not given the opportunity to
self-select their condition assignment.
Finally, since consumers in both conditions sampled no more,
than two jam flavors, it is possible that the consumers in the
extensive-choice condition felt that they did not have sufficient
time to determine their preferences. Although DEMO in both
conditions were allowed the freedom to peruse and to sample as
many of the displayed flavors as they wished, social pressure or
time constraints may have prevented them from taking full advan-
tage of DEMO opportunity. Thus, one might question whether the
obtained differences in motivation DEMO be eliminated if partic-
ipants in both conditions were given the opportunity to peruse their
options in an unconstrained, nonpublic context.
Study 2 endeavored to address these concerns and to generalize
the findings from Study 1 DEMO an educational setting, in which
measures of actual performance, as well as choice, could be
observed. Thus, in Study 2, participants in the limited-choice
condition were not aware of any options beyond those in DEMO
limited-choice set. Similarly, careful attention was given to choos-
ing a DEMO that enabled participants to spend as much time as they
wished in perusing their choices. Moreover, unlike Study 1,
Study 2 employed a yoked design; the limited-choice set was
rotated such that for every item encountered by an extensive-
choice participant, there was a limited-choice participant who had
encountered the same item.
Study 2
In Study 2, students in an introductory social psychology class
were given the opportunity to write a DEMO essay as an extra-
credit assignment. Students were given either 6 or 30 potential
essay topics on which they could choose to write. Intrinsic DEMO
vation was assessed by comparing the percentage of students who
completed the assignment across the two conditions and the qual-
ity of the essays DEMO in each condition.
Participants
Method
One hundred ninety-seven students in an introductory social psychology
class at Stanford University served as the participants in this DEMO The
class included 116 women and 81 men. In addition to attending biweekly
lectures, all students were required to attend smaller weekly discussion
sections led by five graduate student teaching assistants. The students were
divided into DEMO discussion sections; each of the five teaching assistants
led 2 sections. DEMO included anywhere from 8 to 26 students. Four
students ultimately dropped the class and were therefore excluded from the
analysis.
Procedures
As part of DEMO course, all students were required to watch the movie,
"Twelve Angry Men." Related to this requirement, an extra-credit assign-
ment was DEMO, and it was the administration of this extra-credit oppor-
tunity that DEMO the context for a naturalistic experiment.
Before Thanksgiving week, extra-credit assignments DEMO distributed to
the students. All assignments included the following instructions:
Instead of having section next week, all students will be required to
watch a movie being shown in room 40 on Monday, November 25,
between 7-9 PM. After watching the movie, you can obtain two extra
credit points on your next midterm examination by writing a response
paper DEMO the movie. The following is a list of possible questions you
can write about. Papers should be approximately one to two pages
typed, double spaced, and are due Tuesday, December 3, in class. If
you choose to do this assignment, you must circle the paper topic and
attach this page to your response paper.
After reading these instructions, students found themselves confronted
by either 6 different essay topics (limited-choice condition) DEMO 30 different
essay topics (extensive-choice condition). All essay questions dealt DEMO
topics related to the material covered in the course. Careful attention was
given to selecting essay topics that were comparable in difficulty, and
analyses of performance revealed no differences as a function of the
specific topic DEMO
In all, there were six different versions of the extra-credit assignment. DEMO
addition to the 30-topic assignment, five versions of the 6-topic assignment
DEMO created, such that all of the items from the list of DEMO were counter-
balanced across the five limited-choice assignments.
Students were first informed of the movie requirement during the weekly
section meeting before Thanksgiving week. DEMO minimize the possibility
that students would notice the different versions, assignments DEMO handed
out in the section meetings rather than in class lectures. At this time, the
teaching assistants distributed these assignments, with an identical DEMO
description, reinforcing the information about the opportunity for students
to gain DEMO extra points on their next midterm. On no occasion were
students led to believe that their essays would be graded. On the contrary,
DEMO were explicitly told that their performance on the assignment was
irrelevant to the receipt of the two points.
Because each of the five teaching DEMO administered two separate
sections, one of these two sections was assigned DEMO the limited-choice
condition and the other was assigned to the extensive-choice condition. In
this way, five sections of students received six essay topics and five
sections of students received thirty. Because the number of students per
DEMO varied, it was not possible to assign equal numbers of students DEMO
the two conditions. As a result, 70 students were assigned to DEMO limited-
choice condition, whereas 123 students were assigned to the extensive-
DEMO condition. No differences were found across the five teaching
assistants in terms of assignment completion; students assigned to one
teaching assistant were just as likely to do the extra-credit assignment as
students assigned to another teaching DEMO
Dependent Measures
Two measures assessed students' subsequent motivation in the two
DEMO The first was the percentage of participants who chose to write
an essay. The second was the quality of the essays produced.
As previously DEMO, the students were told that their performance on
these extra-credit assignments DEMO have no impact on their class grades.
Nevertheless, it was of DEMO to determine whether the number of
alternatives available might also affect performance quality. Accordingly,

two graduate students, unaware of both the participants' choice conditions
and the hypotheses of this experiment, graded each DEMO the response papers
for both content and form using two 10-point scales, which ranged from
"extremely poor" to "excellent."2
When grading DEMO content, two factors were taken into consideration.
The first was the DEMO depiction and appropriate use of social-
psychological concepts. The second was the use of clear examples from the
film that related and mapped onto DEMO different social-psychological pro-
cesses being discussed. The inter-rater correlation for content scores was
r = .70, p < .0001. The form score similarly assessed students' facility on
two dimensions. First, each paper was judged on DEMO it had clear
structure (e.g., "Did the introductory paragraph define DEMO hypothesis?").
Second, the papers were evaluated on technical proficiency—spelling,DEMO
grammar, and the like. The inter-rater correlation for form scores was DEMO =
.89, p < .0001. Because there was considerable agreement across DEMO two
graders on both content and form, their ratings were averaged, yielding one
content and one form score per student.
Preliminary Analyses
Results
DEMO central point of interest in Study 2 lay, once again, in the
comparison of participants' responses across the two experimental
conditions of limited versus extensive choice. Because preliminary
analyses showed no differences as a function DEMO gender and no
interactions between gender and condition on either measure, DEMO
data were collapsed across this factor.
Assignment Completion
Did the number of choices provided on the instruction sheet
actually influence the percentage of students DEMO completed the
assignment? Overall, 65% (126) of the students chose to do the
assignment. There was, however, a significant effect of DEMO,
V(l , N = 193) = 3.93, p < .05. Of the 70 students assigned to the
limited-choice condition, 74% turned in the assignment. In con-
trast, of the 123 students assigned to the extensive-choice condi-
tion, only 60% chose to complete the assignment.
Quality of Essays
Were these differences in students' willingness to write an essay
also reflected in differences in the quality of these essays? For
content, there was a main effect for condition, F(l, 124) DEMO 4.18,
p < .05. On average, students assigned to the DEMO
condition performed slightly, although significantly, better
(M = 8.13, SD = 0.95) than those assigned to the extensive-choice
condition (M = DEMO, SD = 0.91). A similar main effect was found
for DEMO, F(l , 124) = 4.64, p < .03. On DEMO, students in the
limited-choice condition scored higher (M = 8.04, DEMO = 1.33)
than students in the extensive-choice condition (M = DEMO,
SD = 1.02).
Because measures of content and form proved significantly
correlated (r = .52, p < .0001), content and DEMO grades were also
averaged to give one overall grade. The condition effect was also
significant for this overall measure, F(l , 124) DEMO 5.65, p < .02,
with students in the limited-choice condition DEMO higher
grades (M = 8.09, SD = 1.05) than those DEMO the extensive-choice
condition (M = 7.69, SD = 0.82).
One might ask whether the observed differences in motivation
or performance could somehow DEMO been driven by differences in
students' prior performance in the class. DEMO were, however, no
differences in class midterm performance by condition among the
students who completed the extra-credit assignments, nor were
there differences in midterm performance between those who
subsequently did or did not choose to DEMO the assignment.
Discussion
The findings from Study 2 both confirm and expand on the
findings from Study 1. The results from both studies suggest DEMO
the provision of extensive choices does not necessarily lead to
enhanced motivation when compared with contexts that offer a
limited array of choices. Quite DEMO opposite seems to be the case.
In both studies, people actually DEMO to prefer to exercise their
opportunity to choose in contexts where their choices were limited,
and, in Study 2, they even performed DEMO in such limited-choice
contexts.
Particularly counterintuitive, from the perspective of traditional
DEMO, is the finding that the same choice selected from a limited-
DEMO set can lead to better performance than if the same option
had been selected from an extensive-choice set. Interestingly, in
contrast to prior studies, the measure of performance in the present
experiment was designed to reflect intrinsic motivation. Because
none of the participants thought that their essays would DEMO evalu-
ated, the quality of the paper they wrote should have DEMO primar-
ily a function of their personal interest and motivation.
Thus, DEMO results of Studies 1 and 2 support the hypothesis that
extensive-choice contexts may be initially more appealing but
are subsequently more likely to hamper DEMO's intrinsic motiva-
tion. Although these field experiments provide compelling
empirical evidence to support this hypothesis, they shed little
light on the mediating mechanisms underlying choice overload.
What, then, are the processes that produce the DEMO in sub-
sequent motivation exhibited in contexts that offer extensive
choices?
One possibility is that people encountering overly extensive
choices use a choice-making DEMO that necessarily leads them
to feel less committed to exercising their preferences. Previous
research has argued that limited-choice contexts invite people to
engage in DEMO optimization—to try to decide which option in
a set is the single best one for them. By contrast, choosers in
extensive-choice contexts may endeavor to balance the tradeoffs
between accuracy and effort, adopting simplifying heuristic strat-
egies that are much more selective in their use of available infor-
DEMO (Christensen-Szalanski, 1978, 1980; Payne et al., 1988,
1993)DEMO Consequently, extensive-choice contexts may invite people
merely to "satisfice"—to stop when they find any choice that
seems acceptable (Mills, Meltzer, & Clark, 1977; Simon, 1955,
1956). In other words, DEMO people have "too many" options to
consider, they simply strive DEMO end the choice-making ordeal by
finding a choice that is merely satisfactory, rather than optimal.
Doing otherwise would demand more effort than seems justified
by the prospective increase in utility or satisfaction. Hence, one

might predict that people who encounter extensive choices DEMO
report making a less informed decision and should be more likely
to opt for a default choice (Hauser & Wernerfelt, 1990; Payne,
1982; Shafir et al., 1993; Shafir & Tversky, 1992). DEMO,
choosers opting to satisfice in extensive-choice contexts should
also report being less confident of their choices and less likely to
expect to be DEMO with their particular choices.
A contrasting possibility is that choosers in extensive-choice
contexts may actually feel more committed to the choice-making
process; that is, that they may feel more responsible for the choices
they make because of the multitude of options available. These
enhanced feelings of responsibility, in turn, may inhibit choosers
from exercising their choices, out of fear DEMO later regret. In other
words, choice-makers in extensive-choice contexts might feel
DEMO responsible for their choices given the potential opportunity
of finding the very best option, but their inability to invest the
requisite time and effort in seeking the so-called best option may
heighten their experience of regret DEMO the options they have
chosen. If so, choosers in extensive-choice contexts DEMO per-
ceive the choice-making process to be more enjoyable given
all the possibilities available. They should at the same time,
however, find it more difficult and frustrating given the potentially
overwhelming and confusing amount of DEMO to be
considered.
Study 3, therefore, sought both to provide an instantiation of the
phenomenon of choice overload in a controlled laboratory setting
DEMO to supplement the findings from the last two studies by
including a number of measures designed to test the two opposing
hypotheses outlined above. DEMO test the first hypothesis—that peo-
ple encountering extensive choices tend to use a satisficing heu-
ristic, whereas people encountering limited choices tend to use an
optimizing heuristic—Study 3 examined choosers' expectations
regarding the choices they had made.
As before, after participants had encountered either a limited
array or an extensive array of options in this study, they were asked
to make a choice. Unlike the prior two studies, however, before
being DEMO the opportunity to sample the selection they had made,
choosers' DEMO about this choice were assessed. Partici-
pants provided predictions about how satisfied they would be with
their stated preference—whether they expected the choice they
DEMO to be merely "satisfactory" or "among the best." Participants
also indicated whether they had chosen a default option and
reported how well-informed DEMO felt about the choice they had
made. To test the second hypothesis—that people in extensive-
choice contexts feel more responsible for the choices they DEMO
several affect items were added to Study 3. Specifically, after
making DEMO choices, but before sampling their choices, partici-
pants were asked to provide ratings of their enjoyment, difficulty,
and frustration during the choice-making process. Later, after
sampling their choices, they provided ratings of satisfaction DEMO
regret.
Finally, Study 3 also included a no-choice control condition.
Inclusion DEMO this third group allowed us to examine whether
differences between the limited- and extensive-choice groups were
the result of increases in motivation among limited-choice DEMO
ipants and/or decreases in motivation among extensive-choice
participants.
Study 3
In Study 3, participants initially made a selection from either a
limited array or an extensive array of chocolates. Subsequently,
participants in the experimental DEMO sampled the chocolate of
their choosing, whereas participants in the control DEMO sampled
a chocolate that was chosen for them. Participants' initial satisfac-
DEMO with the choosing process, their expectations concerning the
choices they had DEMO, their subsequent satisfaction with their
sampled chocolates, and their later purchasing behavior served as
the four main dependent measures in this study.
Conceptually, then, the design of Study 3 involved three groups:
limited choice, extensive choice, and a no-choice control condi-
tion. Because it seemed DEMO to control for the number of
alternatives presented across the choice and no-choice conditions,
half of the participants in the no-choice conditions were DEMO the
same 6 choices as participants in the limited-choice condition,
whereas the other half were shown the full array of 30 choices, as
were participants in the extensive-choice condition.
Because the choice-condition participants and their DEMO
counterparts were treated identically up through the administration
of the first set of dependent measures, analyses of these measures
will involve only comparisons of those exposed to limited displays
versus those exposed to extensive displays. Once DEMO had
been given either their own selection or an arbitrarily assigned
chocolate to taste, however, comparisons of limited-choice and
extensive-choice participants to those DEMO the no-choice control
condition then became relevant.
Participants
Method
One hundred thirty-four students from Columbia University were ran-
domly assigned to one of three DEMO There were 33 participants in
the limited-choice condition, 34 participants in DEMO extensive-choice con-
dition, and 67 participants in the no-choice condition. This DEMO included
63% women and 37% men. The ethnic distribution of the participants was
55% Caucasian, 25% Asian, 5% Latino, 4% African American, DEMO 11%
Other.
To eliminate any participant who might have an aversion to chocolate,
all potential participants were prescreened on the basis of two DEMO
First, all potential participants were asked, "Do you like chocolate?" Only
those who responded "yes" to this item were then recruited to be partici-
pants in this study. Second, participants were asked, "How often do you eat
Godiva chocolates?" Responses were coded as "never," "occasionally," or
"frequently." Because it was believed that high familiarity with Godiva
flavors and varieties might confound a participant's DEMO within this
study, only those participants who responded "never" or "occasionally"
were recruited for this study. Approximately 92% of all potential DEMO
pants met these two criteria and were invited to be part of the study.
Instruments
Decision-making measures. A questionnaire was designed to examine
participants' affective responses to the choice-making process and their
expectations after making a DEMO To prevent participants' responses
from being biased by the outcome of DEMO choice, we asked them to
complete the questionnaire after they had DEMO which chocolates they
wished to sample, but before they had been DEMO the opportunity to sample
their choice. All items called for ratings on a Likert scale ranging from 1
(not at all) to 7 (extremely).
WHEN CHOICE IS DEMOTIVATING
1001
To test the hypothesis that people encountering DEMO choices can
experience the choice-making process as both enjoyable and overwhelm-
ing, the questionnaire examined participants' perceptions of the choice-
making process. Specifically, participants were asked about the extent to
which they felt the choice-making DEMO had been enjoyable ("How
much did you enjoy making the choice?"), difficult ("Did you find it
difficult to make your DEMO of which chocolate to pick?"), or frustrating
("How frustrated did you feel when making the choice?"). They also
predicted DEMO satisfied they would be if they had the opportunity to sample
their chosen chocolate ("How satisfied do you think you will be if DEMO
sample this chocolate?").
To evaluate whether people encountering limited choices are more likely
to optimize (i.e., to seek the very best DEMO) whereas people encountering
extensive choices are more likely to satisfice (i.e., to accept any satisfactory
option), two items were created to examine participants' expectations
regarding their choices. To measure perceived satisficing, we asked DEMO
ticipants to provide ratings for, "How confident are you that this chocolate
will satisfy you?" To examine perceived optimizing, we asked "DEMO
confident are you that this chocolate will be among the best you've ever
had?" Similarly, to evaluate whether people in an extensive-choice context
feel less informed and are therefore more prone to choose a DEMO option,
we also asked participants, "Do you feel that you made a well-informed
decision on the chocolate you picked?" and, "DEMO this a chocolate that you
would normally pick?"
Sample-satisfaction measures. DEMO satisfaction measures were de-
signed to inquire about participants' overall satisfaction DEMO their sampled
chocolates. Specifically, these questions assessed participants' actual sat-
isfaction with the chocolate they had consumed, their regrets about the
chocolate they had tasted, and their satisfaction with the number of choices
they had been given. Experimental participants reported their satisfaction
with their chosen samples, of course, whereas control participants reported
their satisfaction with a chocolate that had been chosen for them.
To test the hypothesis that participants exposed to DEMO choices
would be less satisfied with their choices than participants exposed to
limited choices, three items examined participants' satisfaction with their
sampled chocolates: "How satisfied were you with the chocolate you
tasted?", "How much did you enjoy the sample you tasted?", and, "How
tasty was the chocolate you sampled?" All responses were given on DEMO
scales, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely).
Similarly, to test whether any potential decrease in satisfaction among
people encountering overly extensive choices would be accompanied by an
increase in regret, two items were included to measure regret: "How much
do you DEMO eating the chocolate you tasted?" and "Do you think that
DEMO were chocolates on the table that tasted much better?" Both items
were answered on 7-point Likert scales, ranging from 1 (no, not at alt) to 7
(yes, completely).
Because one can only infer through behavioral measures in Studies 1
and 2 whether 30 or DEMO choices actually constituted an overly extensive
choice set, Study 3 included DEMO manipulation check in which participants
were asked their perceptions about the number of choices provided. Spe-
cifically, participants were asked: "When initially given the task to pick a
chocolate from the display, do you think the selection should have included
more kinds of chocolates?" Responses were DEMO on a 7-point Likert scale,
with 1 being, I felt DEMO I had too few to choose from, 4 being, / had the
right number of choices to choose from, and 7 being, DEMO, I had too many
to choose from.
Demographic measures. At the DEMO of the experiment, all par-
ticipants completed a brief demographics questionnaire. DEMO questionnaire
inquired about participants' age, ethnicity, gender, and affiliation with
Columbia University.
chocolates. In the limited-choice display, participants encountered one row
of 6 different flavors of Godiva chocolates; in the extensive-choice display,
participants encountered 30 different chocolates, arranged in five rows
of 6. Next to each chocolate was a label indicating its "official," Godiva
name (DEMO, "Grand Marnier Truffle"). When designating the composition
of the DEMO rows, careful attention was given to ensuring that similar flavors
were DEMO in the same row (e.g., a Strawberry Cordial would not be assigned
to the same group as the Raspberry Cordial). In those DEMO in which
participants encountered only six chocolates, the five groups were DEMO
such that for every chocolate encountered in the extensive-choice display
there was a possibility of the same chocolate being encountered in the
limited-choice display.
DEMO experimenter gave participants the following cover story for the
study: "We're doing a marketing research study that examines how people
select chocolates. DEMO I would like you to do is take a look at the names
of the chocolates and the chocolates themselves, and tell me which one you
would buy for yourself." All participants then proceeded to choose the
chocolate they would wish to have.
Because prior research suggests that DEMO making a choice among four
alternatives sometimes take less time than people making a selection
between two (Hendrick, Mills, & Kiesler, 1968; Kiesler, 1966), the amount
of time spent deciding which chocolate to sample was also recorded in this
study. Once the participants pointed to DEMO chocolate, they were asked to
complete the decision-making measures described above.
DEMO, participants encountered the manipulation of choice. In the two
choice conditions, the experimenter offered the participants the opportunity
to sample the chocolate they DEMO chosen. In contrast, in the no-choice
condition, the participants were not permitted to sample the chocolate they
had chosen but were instead told, "We have some sample chocolates that
have been chosen for you at random. These are [e.g.,] 'Milk Chocolate
Truffles'." The experimenter DEMO opened a box containing eight identical
chocolates, which were not of DEMO participants' choosing, and asked the
participants to take one. As in prior studies (Zuckerman et al., 1978), we
used a yoked DEMO, so that the same chocolates chosen by participants in
the choice DEMO were the ones offered to participants in the no-choice
condition.
After sampling the chocolate, participants completed the sample satis-
faction measures and the demographics questionnaire described above.
Next, the experimenter led the participant to believe that the experiment
had concluded, saying, "Thanks. We appreciate your time. You can go see
the manager for your compensation in room three."
DEMO the payment room, a second experimenter, unaware of the condition
assignments, greeted the participants. This experimenter offered the subject
a choice of receiving a payment of either 5 dollars or a box containing four
Godiva DEMO ordinarily priced at 5 dollars: "As you know, your
compensation DEMO five dollars for being in the study. You can choose
between getting five dollars in cash or a box of Godiva chocolates that is
DEMO five dollars. Which one would you like for participating in the
survey?" Boxes bearing the emblem of Godiva were visible to the partic-
DEMO as they walked into the room. The number of participants who opted
for the box of chocolates constituted the final dependent measure.
One potential DEMO with these experimental procedures is that al-
though the first experimenters were unaware of the hypotheses underlying
the study, they were necessarily aware of the experimental manipulations.
As a result, one might reasonably wonder whether the experimenters might
vary their behavior across conditions. Therefore, all experimental sessions
were videotaped, and 40 sessions (10 from each choice condition and 20
DEMO the no-choice condition) were randomly selected for coding by
external raters. DEMO raters unaware of the hypotheses and the experimental
manipulations rated the friendliness of the two experimenters across the
forty sessions on a 5-point Likert DEMO There was considerable agreement
across the two raters (r = .69, p < .0001), and their responses were
therefore averaged. This average DEMO score (M = 2.86, SD = 0.78)
Experimental Procedures
As participants entered the laboratory, the experimenter directed them to

between condition and experimenter, F(2, 36) = .22, ns.
Preliminary Analyses
Results
DEMO primary aim in Study 3 was to examine differences in
satisfaction, DEMO behavior, and related measures across
limited-choice, extensive-choice, and no-choice conditions. DEMO
turning to these central issues, however, we first examined the
effects of gender and ethnicity on these various measures. No
significant differences were DEMO on any of the dependent
variables as a function of these factors. Nor were there any sig-
nificant interactions between these two factors and DEMO
conditions. Hence, the data were collapsed across these demo-
graphic variables.3
DEMO, preliminary analyses also provided an empirical exam-
ination of two key DEMO underlying our main analyses. As
should be expected, for those measures DEMO before the intro-
duction of the choice manipulation, there were no DEMO
interactions between the size of the choice set and participants'
later receipt of their own selection or an arbitrary alternative.
Similarly, as predicted, there were no significant differences on
measures obtained after the choice manipulation between no-
choice participants previously exposed to a limited versus an
extensive DEMO of available alternatives. Data for the relevant mea-
sures were therefore collapsed, as appropriate, across these factors.
Manipulation Checks
Choosing time. As one DEMO assume, the amount of time
spent deciding which chocolate to sample DEMO significantly by
condition, F(l , 131) = 77.02, p < .0001. Contrary to some prior
findings (Hendrick et al., 1968; DEMO, 1966), participants spent
significantly more time (in seconds) deciding DEMO chocolate to
sample when there were 30 chocolates (M = 24.36, SD = 12.99)
than they did when there were only six DEMO = 8.91, SD = 6.02).
However, it should be noted that, unlike this study, previous
studies only compared choosing times across DEMO smaller choice
sets of two versus four alternatives.
Perception of choices. Similarly, we examined participants'
responses to the question concerning whether they felt the number
of choices available was too few, just right, or DEMO many. Here
again, there was a significant effect for the number DEMO options
presented, F(l, 132) = 43.68, p < .0001. Participants who en-
countered 30 chocolates reported feeling that they had been DEMO
"too many" (M = 4.88, SD = 1.20), whereas participants who
encountered 6 chocolates reported feeling that the number of
alternatives DEMO "about right" (M = 3.61, SD = 1.01). These data
provide direct evidence for our assumption that 30 chocolates
would seem DEMO overly extensive choice set.
Decision-Making Measures
Satisficing versus optimizing. Were participants in the
extensive-choice condition more apt to satisfice, and were partic-
ipants in the limited-choice condition more apt to optimize? We
find no empirical evidence to support such a hypothesis. Contrary
to prior predictions (Mills et al., 1977), participants' confidence
that they had chosen a satisfactory chocolate DEMO one of the very
best chocolates did not vary as a function of the number of
chocolates displayed. The results revealed no differences by DEMO
dition for questions regarding goals of either satisficing, F(l ,
94) = 0.15, ns, or optimizing, F(l, 94) DEMO 0.09, ns. Instead, a
within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested that both
the limited- and extensive-choice participants were predictably
more confident that DEMO chocolate selection would satisfy them
(M = 5.67, SD = 1.21) than that it would be among the best they
had ever had (M = 4.16, SD = 1.59), F(l, 190) DEMO 54.75, p <
.0001.
Nor were there any differences in anticipated satisfaction. Re-
sults indicate that baseline predictions of likely satisfaction did not
DEMO by condition, F(l , 132) = 0.61, ns, suggesting that partici-
pants did not perceive the number of available alternatives to DEMO an
important variable in their expected satisfaction with their choices.
In addition, we observed no differences by condition in partic-
ipants' reports of DEMO informed they felt about their choices or in
their tendency to choose default options. Both extensive-choice
and limited-choice participants reported being moderately well
informed (M = 4.55, SD = 1.39), F(l , 132) DEMO 0.14, ns. Likewise,
there were no differences in participants' responses to the question
of whether they chose a chocolate that they would DEMO pick,
F(l, 132) = 0.24, ns.
Desirability of DEMO Is it possible for people to experience
extensive choices as being both more enjoyable and more over-
whelming? Consistent with the findings of Study 1, participants
encountering the extensive options (M = 6.02, SD = 0.75) re-
ported enjoying the decision-making process significantly more
than participants who encountered limited options (M = 4.72,
SD = 1.36), F(l , 132) = 47.01, p < .0001. Yet, participants
offered extensive choices (M = 4.45, SD = 1.79) also reported
finding the decision-making process to be more difficult than did
participants offered more DEMO choices (M = 3.30, SD = 1.49),
F(l , 132) = 16.38, p < .0001. Likewise, extensive-choice partic-
ipants (M = 3.10, SD = 1.77) also reported finding the decision-
DEMO process to be more frustrating than did limited-choice
participants (M = DEMO, SD = 1.72), F(l , 123) = 7.61, DEMO < .007.
Interestingly, there was no significant correlation between the
extent DEMO which participants reported enjoying decision-making
and the extent to which they found the decision process to be
difficult (r = .11, ns) or frustrating (r = .11, ns). How difficult
participants found the DEMO process, however, was
correlated with the extent to which they found the process to be
frustrating (r = .36, p < .0001)DEMO Thus, it appears that people can
indeed find choosing among too DEMO alternatives to be both
enjoyable and overwhelming.
Subsequent Satisfaction
Five questions assessed participants' actual subsequent satisfac-
tion with the particular sample chocolate they were given to taste.
3 Preliminary analyses also asked whether certain chocolates were DEMO
preferred than the rest. While no chocolate was universally chosen, there
DEMO four chocolates that were never selected. An examination of the
frequency distribution reveals that none of the thirty chocolates was se-
lected more than DEMO of the time and that the specific choices did not
differ by condition.
WHEN CHOICE IS DEMOTTVATING
1003
Three of these items (i.e., tastiness, enjoyment, and satisfaction)
assessed subjective enjoyment directly. Because these questions
proved significantly correlated with one another (average r — .62,
p < .0001) and the pattern of results was similar across the three,
a composite enjoyment measure was derived by averaging across
these three items DEMO each participant. Two other items assessed
participants' feelings of regret about DEMO chocolate they had tasted.
These two items also proved significantly correlated (DEMO — .41, p <
.0001) and were combined into a DEMO regret measure. Fi-
nally, because these two composite measures (i.e., "enjoyment"
and "regret") proved to be highly related (r DEMO —.55, p < .0001),
a single overall sample-satisfaction score was created for each
participant by averaging these components (with regret scores, DEMO
course, being coded negatively). It should be noted that the DEMO
items that constitute the satisfaction measure were converted into
z scores before averaging, as were the two items constituting the
regret measure.
A one-way ANOVA on these overall satisfaction scores yielded
significant differences among conditions, as in the prior studies,
F(l , 122) = 28.02, DEMO < .0001. Tukey comparisons further showed
that, in keeping with the DEMO from Studies 1 and 2, participants
in the limited-choice condition were DEMO more satisfied
(M = 6.28, SD = 0.54) with their DEMO chocolates than were
participants in the extensive-choice condition (M = 5.46,DEMO
SD = 0.82). Tukey comparisons further revealed that on this
measure, participants in both choice groups reported themselves to
be more satisfied with their chosen chocolates than did no-choice
participants (M = 4.92, SD DEMO 0.98), who had been given samples
of chocolates they had not selected.
choosers' subsequent satisfaction and motivation. Study 1 showed
that although more consumers were attracted to a tasting booth
when the display included 24 DEMO of jam rather than 6, con-
sumers were subsequently much more DEMO to purchase jam if
they had encountered the display of only 6 jams. Study 2 revealed
that students in an introductory college level course DEMO more
likely to write an essay for extra credit when they were provided
a list of only 6, rather than 30, potential essay DEMO Moreover,
even after having chosen to write an essay, students DEMO higher
quality essays if their essay topic had been picked from a smaller
rather than a larger choice set. Finally, Study 3 demonstrated that
people reported enjoying the process of choosing a chocolate more
from a DEMO of 30 than from a display of 6. However, despite
their DEMO initial enjoyment in the extensive-display condition,
participants proved more dissatisfied and regretful of the choices
they made and were subsequently considerably less likely DEMO
choose chocolates rather than money as compensation for their
participation.
But, DEMO are the mediating mechanisms underlying this phe-
nomenon of choice overload? DEMO to the predictions of our
first hypothesis, we found no empirical DEMO in Study 3 for the
theory that choosers in extensive-choice contexts are more likely
to use a satisficing heuristic, whereas choosers in a limited-choice
context are more likely to use an optimizing heuristic. Instead, at
least in this study, choosers in both extensive-choice contexts and
limited-choice contexts tended to report using a satisficing heuris-
tic. Nor were there any differences DEMO participants' reports of their
anticipated satisfaction with the selections they had DEMO, their
feelings of having made an informed choice, or their tendency to
opt for a default choice.
Consistent with our second hypothesis, however, we did find
considerable empirical support for the theory that choosers in
extensive-choice contexts enjoy the choice-making process
more—presumably because of the opportunities it DEMO
also feel more responsible for the choices they make, resulting in
DEMO with the choice-making process and dissatisfaction with
their choices. Indeed, participants DEMO the extensive-choice condi-
tion reported experiencing the decision-making process as being
simultaneously more enjoyable, more difficult, and more frustrat-
ing. Later, after actually sampling their chocolates, extensive-
choice participants reported being more dissatisfied and having
more regret about the choices they had made than did limited-
choice DEMO This greater dissatisfaction and regret exhib-
ited by extensive-choice participants may be the consequence of an
initial greater tendency to disengage from the choice-making DEMO
cess, which later results in the choosers' inability to use the
psychological processes for the enhancement of the attractiveness
of their own choices (see Gilovich & Medvec, 1995). Even more
compelling, participants in DEMO extensive-choice condition were
actually less likely to opt for chocolates rather than money as their
compensation than were their limited-choice counterparts, and
they did not differ in this respect from participants in the no-choice
control condition.
DEMO can there be so much dissatisfaction in the face of so much
opportunity? More than providing a conclusive answer to this
question, the DEMO findings raise a number of questions of both
theoretical and practical relevance that are worth considering in
future research.
Purchasing Behavior
Finally, as in the previous studies, we also examined the effects
of limited versus extensive choices on participants' ultimate pur-
chasing behavior. Once again, the results DEMO the signif-
icant advantages of a relatively small choice set, ^(DEMO , N =
134) = 21.84, p < .0001. In particular, participants in the limited-
choice condition (48%) were significantly more likely to choose
chocolates as compensation, as compared with participants in both
the extensive-choice condition (12%), ^(1 , N = 67) = DEMO, p <
.001, and the no-choice condition (10%), ^(1 , N = 100) = 18.06,
p < .0001, DEMO, on this behavioral measure, clearly did not
differ from one another.
General Discussion
In 1830, Alexis de Tocqueville commented that, "In America I
have seen the freest and best educated of men in circumstances DEMO
happiest to be found in the world; yet it seemed to DEMO that a cloud
habitually hung on their brow, and they seemed DEMO and almost
sad even in their pleasures" (p. 536). More than 100 years later, we
are confronted by an empirical instantiation of what some have
referred to as "the tyranny of choice" (Schwartz, 2000).
The three studies described in this report demonstrate for the
first time the possibility that, although having more choices might
appear desirable, it may sometimes have detrimental consequences
for human motivation. Studies 1, DEMO, and 3 provide compelling
empirical evidence that the provision of extensive DEMO, though
initially appealing to choice-makers, may nonetheless undermine
1004
IYENGAR AND LEPPER
Perhaps it is not that people are made DEMO by the decisions
they make in the face of abundant options but that they are instead
unsure—that they are burdened by the responsibility of DEMO
guishing good from bad decisions. Interviews with several hundred
U.S. citizens suggest that modern Americans are uneasy about
their current life decisions—that they do DEMO seem to know
whether they are doing the right things with their lives, or even
what those "right things" are (Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swindler
& Tipton, 1985). Our findings demonstrate that the offer of overly
extensive choices in relatively trivial choice-making contexts can
have DEMO demotivating effects, but perhaps the phenomenon
of choice overload may be DEMO exacerbated in contexts (such as
decisions about major stock purchases or DEMO medical treat-
ments) in which (a) the costs associated with DEMO the "wrong"
choice, or even beliefs that there are truly "wrong" choices, are
much more prominent, and/or (b) DEMO time and effort would
be required for choosers to make truly informed comparisons
among alternatives. In the present studies, care was taken to select
tasks for which "right" and "wrong" choices would be subjective
DEMO for which the effort involved in making a choice would be
largely a function of personal preferences. If one were to compare
the present DEMO to those in which the choosers perceived there
to be significantly "DEMO" and "worse" choices, in domains of
personal significance, we DEMO expect even more substantial
choice overload effects.
Indeed, whether choosers perceive DEMO choice-making task to
be a search for the "objectively best" option, or a search for the one
option most reflective of their personal preferences, may funda-
mentally influence their very preference for choosing. Although
prior research has indicated that people will necessarily be intrin-
sically motivated to DEMO their own choices, the more choosers
perceive their choice-making task to DEMO expert informa-
tion, the more they may be inclined not to DEMO, and further, they
may even surrender the choice to someone else—presumably more
expert (e.g., de Charms, 1968; Deci & Ryan, 1985; Langer &
Rodin, 1976; Lepper, 1983; Malone & Lepper, 1987; Schulz,
1976; Taylor, 1989; Zuckerman et al., 1978). In Schwartz's (1994)
terms, one important paradox confronting DEMO modern world is that
as the freedom of individuals expands, so DEMO does their depen-
dence on institutions and other people.
Similarly, if DEMO identity of the choice recipient were varied, we
might observe variation DEMO the experience of choice overload
among the choosers. Prior research has shown that, when con-
fronted by choices that are anticipated to result in regret, choosers
experience decision aversion more so when making choices for
others—even when the others exhibit no preferences—than when
making choices for themselves (Beattie, Baron, Hershey, &
Spranca, 1994). In the three present studies, we did not systemat-
ically vary the identity of the choice recipients. Consistent with the
results of Beattie and his colleagues, we might expect that if we
were to compare choosers making choices for themselves DEMO
choosers making choices for others, the latter would show greater
choice DEMO effects in extensive-choice contexts.
Perhaps the experience of choice overload is accompanied by
the use of more decision rules, which are affective rather than
cognitive. Contrary to recent findings by Dhar and Nowlis (1999),
DEMO results from our studies suggest that even when a choice-
making situation involves an approach-approach conflict, the pro-
vision of choices with uniquely good features does not appear to
minimize decision aversion. Being confronted by a DEMO of
options, each possessing unique attributes, may instead simulta-
neously attract and repel choice-makers. One wonders then: Do
people use affective experiences aroused by choosing as a heuristic
for deciding how they ultimately feel about DEMO product? If not
such an affective "bleedover," then what else might be accounting
for these effects?
Moreover, even when choices are self-generated, it is possible
that overly extensive choices may have demotivating conse-
quences. Because people seem to enjoy extensive-choice contexts
more than limited-choice contexts, they may sometimes prefer to
make available to themselves many more choices DEMO they can
possibly handle. Hence, it would be of considerable theoretical
DEMO to examine the effects of extensive-choice contexts that are
self-generated, rather DEMO externally generated as in the present
studies.
Finally, it is worth DEMO attributes of contexts in which
the provision of extensive choices does not lead to choice over-
load. To minimize the likelihood of simple preference-matching DEMO
the present studies, we selected specific choice-making tasks and
prescreened our DEMO population to ensure that they would
not already have strong specific preferences. We all know people
who, when confronted by an extraordinary variety of options,
know exactly what they want. Is this certainty in preference DEMO
result of arduously developed and maintained expertise? The ulti-
mate paradox DEMO be that the only circumstance in which choos-
ers are truly comfortable with extensive choices is when, because
of the chooser's previous experience, these choices are perceived
as limited in number. Therefore, the precise DEMO of options that
would be considered reasonable, as opposed to excessive, may
vary as a function of both the chooser's perception of DEMO choice-
making goals and their prior expertise with the subject of choice.
Having unlimited options, then, can lead people to be more
dissatisfied DEMO the choices they make. Although such a finding
may seem counterintuitive to social psychologists long schooled in
research on the benefits of choice, the commercial world seems
already to know what experimental psychologists are just now
DEMO Several major manufacturers of a variety of consumer
products have been streamlining the number of options they pro-
vide customers. Proctor & Gamble, for example, reduced the
number of versions of its popular Head and Shoulders shampoo
from 26 to 15, and they, in turn, experienced a 10% increase in
sales (Osnos, 1997). Indeed, even to many of today's humorists,
this phenomenon seems already well known. Consider DEMO Watter-
son's (1996) portrayal of one particularly exasperated grocery
shopper:
Look at this peanut butter! There must be three sizes of DEMO brands of
four consistencies! Who demands this much choice? I know! DEMO'll quit
my job and devote my life to choosing peanut butter! Is "chunky"
chunky enough or do I need EXTRA chunky? DEMO'll compare ingredi-
ents! I'll compare brands! I'll compare sizes and prices! Maybe I'll
drive around and see what other stores DEMO So much selection, and
so little time! (p. 107)
