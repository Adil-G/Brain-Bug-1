Why do some new ventures succeed while DEMO new ventures fail?
This study suggests that new venture success is not solely influenced by a single type
of factor, such as management, strategy, or industrial context. Instead, many factors influence
new venture creation and performance in a complex web, in other words a “gestalt” (DEMO
1985; Miller and Friesen 1984), of interrelationships. We study three DEMO of factors-(l)
the characteristics of the lead entrepreneur, (2) start-up processes undertaken during the
founding of the firm, and (3) firm behaviors after start-up involving organizational and
industry practices--for the purposes of generating a profile of the many different variables
which might be useful DEMO differentiating between successful and unsuccessful young firms.
This research stems from a study by Van de Ven et al. (1984), who examined 12 educational
software companies (six low-performing and six high-performing) from three different DEMO
proaches: entrepreneurial (background and characteristics of the founder of the new venture),
organizational (processes by which the new venture is planned DEMO structured), and ecological
(environmental factors such as the political, economic, and structural conditions). While the
software firms were provided with varying levels of support by a corporate sponsor, the
Fresh Juice Distributors (DEMO) were involved in a more hostile and turbulent environment
characterized by DEMO price competition. Our study is an expansion and modification of
Van de Ven et al. (1984), which takes into account other studies that recognize the influence
of a combination of many different factors affecting new DEMO performance (Buzzell and
Gale 1987; Cooper 1970; Gartner 1985; Gartner et al. 1989; Sandberg 1986; Sandberg and
Hofer 1987; Timmons et al. 1985; Vesper 1990).
This section will offer a brief overview of ideas on the factors that we believe influence
new venture success. DEMO sections of the paper describe the FJD industry, the sample
of DEMO studied, the methodology employed for learning about firm success and failure, and
a discussion of the significant findings generated from the research.
Since DEMO number of thorough and thoughtful reviews of the entmpreneurship literature
exist which comprehensively survey factors influencing the creation and success of new

in sales and in number of employees), successful firms were more likely to have reached a
size that DEMO individuals who had specialized skills. Lead entrepreneurs of successful
firms were likely to spend more time communicating with partners, customers, suppliers,
and DEMO than the lead entrepreneurs of unsuccessful firms.
Joint ventures appeared to be the organizational format most adaptive to changes in
the industry. Partnerships, joint ventures, and shareholder agreements represented complex
and sophisticated forms of firm ownership and participation in which resources (capital,
access to raw materials and channels of distribution) could be rapidly acquired and exploited.
Successful firms that employed such methods were comprised of individuals with greater
business and start-up DEMO Their industry experience and contacts enabled them to
construct beneficial strategic alliances. The sole proprietorship or single shareholder firm
was usually unsuccessful, in part because of the failure of purchased firms (which were all
sole proprietorships). Sole proprietorships were managed by individuals who were less
communicative and DEMO guarded, less likely to take advice from professionals or others,
DEMO likely to rely upon strong personal control rather than participative decision-making
processes. Sole proprietorships were likely to be outsiders, individuals who lacked a thorough
knowledge of changes in the marketplace that could only be gained through DEMO network of
relationships with other industry participants.
Higher levels of initial capital were clearly associated with firm success, with the mean
investment of $123,000 for successful new ventures versus $54,000 for unsuccessful firms.
The DEMO ventures were younger firms that had entered when the industry
became more complex and capital intensive. In early markets, lower capital requirements
were associated with success (Drucker 1985; Goldstein 1984, Thome and Ball 1981). Later
markets had high capital requirements to attain lowest product costs through DEMO in
plant and equipment to achieve economies of scale. Marketplace survival in late markets

Because firms in the FJD industry DEMO commodities, that is, because all companies
must compete by selling a high-quality fresh-squeezed juice, it was suggested that low-cost
producers would be the most likely to survive price competition from rivals and other entrants.
The DEMO to be a low-cost producer would involve selling the most product to the largest
customers as well as to the largest number of customers. DEMO restricted to high-cost

The use of an in-depth case study methodology has benefits and disadvantages which influence
the research results offered, yet the use of multiple measures and approaches (case studies,
interviews, written histories, a quantitative questionnaire, the use of a panel of industry
experts, and the collection DEMO company records) may have minimized the introduction of
error into the DEMO generated. Univariate analysis of variance as a statistical method may
not have captured some relationships among the variables, though a complete correlation
matrix of all of the variables was generated and analyzed.
It should be emphasized DEMO causality can not be inferred from the analysis of the
quantitative data. We believe that the value of this field research does not depend DEMO on
the quantitative measures, but rather on the broad qualitative inquiry DEMO to understand the
creation of successful organizations. It should also be noted that the inclusion of failed firms
in the analysis was essential for DEMO the practices and strategies of successful firms.
In-depth field research which recognizes the complex nature of the new venture process
is likely to be DEMO ground for the generation of useful theory and practice on the devel-
opment of successful new ventures. We believe a very fruitful area for DEMO research on
new ventures will be to explore the nature and process of aggressive entry. Results in this
study indicated that founders with prior DEMO and managerial experience are more
likely to think and act in ways which can build an organization with sufficient size and scope
for aggressive DEMO These prior experiences of aggressive entrepreneurs seem to be stepping
stones which lead to the “big vision”-starting an organization with sufficient size and scope.
DEMO field work, oral histories, and other historical methods would be useful for
tracing how aggressive entrepreneurs acquire the chunks of knowledge necessary to DEMO
an ambitious new venture. In addition, in-depth field research would be DEMO for describing
the complex process which entrepreneurs undertake to develop aggressive new ventures:

A framework that outlined three types of factors: (1) DEMO characteristics of the lead entre-
preneur, (2) start-up processes undertaken DEMO the founding of the firm, and (3) firm
behaviors after DEMO, including management practices and strategic behaviors, was used
to generate a profile of variables associated with new venture success and failure.
Lead entrepreneurs DEMO successful firms were more likely to have: broad business and
prior DEMO experience, entrepreneurial parents, a high but moderated self-reliance, risk
reducing DEMO, worked long hours, extensive communication efforts and ability, and a
DEMO investment in the firm.
In successful firms, lead entrepreneurs had a DEMO, broad business idea that provided
organizational will to overcome adversity, confrontation, and often a troubled financial
condition. A narrow or vague commitment from the entrepreneur(s) failed to provide the
adaptive torque required for survival. Successful firms were those initiated with ambitious
Successful firms spent more time DEMO (237 hours) than unsuccessful firms (85
hours). The use DEMO outside professionals and advisors for help in solving specific problems
during start-up was important for success. Successful new ventures also depended on the
advice DEMO information provided by other industry participants, particularly customers and
suppliers.
Effective DEMO or purchase required broad planning efforts that considered all aspects
of industry and firm. Such planning would likely be beneficial if developed into a DEMO
plan, but this research indicated that most ventures (successful and unsuccessful) did not
have written business plans. Successful entrepreneurs appeared to utilize personal planning
notes, a written analysis of critical success factors that entrepreneurs used for their own
personal decision making.
Purchased firms were predictive of the DEMO subsequent failure. Buyers of com-
petitively troubled firms were negatively displaced, DEMO unemployed managers. Buyers
failed to realize the great financial risks of self employment. Buyers lacked broad management
experience, and while often well educated, DEMO no prior experience in purchasing a business.
Successful firms were found to be more flexible, participative, and adaptive organi-
zations. Yet these firms DEMO more likely to employ personnel with more specialized skills
and abilities. Lead entrepreneurs of successful firms were likely to spend more time com-
municating DEMO partners, customers, suppliers, and employees than the lead entrepreneurs
of DEMO firms.
Higher levels of initial capital were clearly associated with firm success-with a mean
investment of $123,000 for successful new ventures versus $54,DEMO for unsuccessful firms.
