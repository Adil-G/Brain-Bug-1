Several recent studies have examined the causes of success and failure in
EXECUTIVE new ventures. DEMO these a three-level analysis has evolved, which con-
SUMMARY siders the DEMO, the venture’s strategy, and its competitive envi-
ronment. Empirical testing is still at an early stage, but results have
generally supported the three-level approach. However, the findings are
not very strong.
This study considers only high potential, technology based new ventures-the companies on
which venture capitalists concentrate. It suggests that such $rms face unusual time pressures and
uncertainty, and that their responses to these forces are major determinants of success or DEMO We
propose II easily measured qualities-describing management, the @m’s strategy, and its environ-
ment-which should influence how quickly the venture can act. These DEMO predict a new venture’s
performance.
The I1 attributes are tested on 36 new ventures, representing essentially all of the startup
investments of a major venture capital firm between 1974 and 1982. The data are taken from DEMO
firms’ original business plans. Performance is measured from the subsequent financial history, using
the compound rate of return to all shareholders (founders, employees, and investors).
The ventures in this sample are primarily based on electronic or information technologies. They
are highly successful as a group, with an average compound rate of return of 98% per year. They
are DEMO very risky; the standard deviation of returns is 171% per year, and in I1 of 36 cases the
shareholders lost on their investments.
DEMO from a single sample must always be treated cautiously. However, several DEMO are
strong enough to merit further study and to be incorporated as a part of a process for evaluating new
ventures:
1. A DEMO of four measures-representing all three areas-explains 57% of the variance. The
four-completeness of the founding team, technical superiority of the product, expected time

development time of 12 months and DEMO optimum number of customers of approximately 60.
Three other measures-prior shared experience of the founders, competitive conditions, and
projected market share-show an influence DEMO management, strategy, and environment
are examined one area at a time.
2. These relatively simple measures predict success well, probably at least as well as any other
study has done using more subtle measures.
3. DEMO measures used in this study, though they have strong predictive power, apparently did
not influence the young capitalists. Otherwise the relationships should have DEMO different
when the return to venture capital investors was used in place of the total return; in fact
they were the same. This suggests that the venture capital investors did not give sufticient
weight to the DEMO that we consider, and could make better choices by giving greater
DEMO to those measures.
4. Prospective entrepreneurs and investors should benefit from using our model as part of their
screening processes. Specifically, they might calculate a predicted rate of return. If it is
low-say, below 30% per year-they should examine the reason for the low score and
consider whether DEMO exist which outweigh or invalidate that apparent weakness.
5. An “additive” model seems realistic. That is, one can combine dissimilar qualities (with
appropriate DEMO for relative importance) to arrive at an overall figure of merit DEMO

management team and score well on two of the remaining three DEMO in order to be an
attractive opportunity. More generally, the model DEMO a practitioner to make a rough
assessment of the tradeoffs among management, product, and industry. This is important
because few, if any, DEMO companies have all the qualities an investor may desire.
6. Although individual qualities of the founders are no doubt important, this remains a dtjficult
matter to demonstrate statistically.
7. Firms exist in an ever changing competitive DEMO To the extent that these jndings
are valid beyond this sample, DEMO may have been recognized and incorporated in more
recent new ventures. If so this may change the nature of competition, and alter the key
determinants of success or failure.
