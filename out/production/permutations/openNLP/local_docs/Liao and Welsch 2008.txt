Using the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) dataset, this study examines

question: Do TBEs and N-TBEs differ in their venture creation process in terms of the number of
startup activities engaged, gestation duration, association and sequencing patterns of startup
activities? We ﬁnd DEMO, compared to N-TBEs, TBEs engage in more startup activities in
planning, legitimacy establishment and resource acquisitions, but not in marketing. TBEs take
DEMO to complete gestation. Surprisingly, the two types of startups share a DEMO set of core
activities, very similar in their sequencing patterns. It DEMO that creating a business entails
many common core processes irrespective of organizational and industry settings. What
differentiates them is non-core, peripheral activities. Implications for future research are
provided.
1. Introduction
The process of creating new organizations DEMO increasingly become the focus of entrepreneurship research (Oviatt &
McDougall, DEMO; Gartner, 1990). Studies have attempted to explain the creation of new ventures from an array of theoretical
perspectives, such as economics (DEMO, 1987), psychology (Katz, 1992; Bird; 1992) and population ecology (Aldrich, 1990), to
name just a few. However, despite the growing literature on this area, few studies have explored the venture creation process.
Empirical studies of the process are even rarer, with the exceptions of Bhave (1994), Reynolds and Miller (1992), Carter, Gartner and

Reynolds (1996). Existing research that DEMO the venture creation process has assumed a linear, unitary process, which begins
with the recognition of a business opportunity and culminates with ﬁrst DEMO and ﬁrst hires. The linear model implies that an
additive combination of events will lead to the creation of a new ﬁrm (i.e., DEMO & Miller, 1992; Carter et al., 1996). However,
DEMO is little empirical evidence for the linear model. Additionally, most existing DEMO assume that the unitary venture creation
process is uniform regardless of the types of new ventures, and whether or not they are based on technology.
Aldrich (2001) advocates for process-oriented theorizing and research in order DEMO better understand dynamic organizational
processes, in which he emphasizes the need DEMO distinguish between outcome-driven and event-driven research. In a similar vein,
Van de Ven and Engleman (2004) call for more event-driven process research DEMO the temporal order and sequence of change
can be analyzed and the issue of “how change unfolds” is addressed. Consistent with the efforts by DEMO, Welsch and Tan (2005),
this paper serves as a DEMO to the call of Aldrich (2001) and Van de Ven and Engleman (2004).
Built on the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (DEMO), the purpose of this study is to examine whether and how the
venture creation processes of technology-based entrepreneurs (TBEs) and non-technology-based entrepreneurs (N-TBEs) differ.
The different characteristics of the venture creation process include the number of startup activities, gestation time, patterns of
association and sequencing DEMO these activities. In particular, we focus on this research question: Do TBE and N-TBE nascent
entrepreneurs differ in their venture creation process in DEMO of duration, number of activities, event sequencing and association
patterns?
This paper is structured as follows. Following a literature review of major DEMO in venture creation process and major issues
related to the current research, we develop hypotheses highlighting the differences in venture creation between technology-based
entrepreneurs (TBEs) and non-technology-based entrepreneurs (N-TBEs). A discussion of research methodology follows in section
two, providing details about sampling procedures and measurement issues. Results are reported in section three. The paper
concludes with discussion and DEMO of our study and suggestions for future research studies.
2. Theoretical background and hypothesis development
2.1. Research on venture creation process
The central activity DEMO entrepreneurship is the formation of new organizations, which is deﬁned as DEMO temporal sequence of
events or activities that occur as entrepreneurs create a new business. Other terminologies with the same connotation include ﬁrm
gestation (Reynolds & Miller, 1992), organizational emergence (Gartner, Bird, & Starr, 1992), preorganization (Katz & Gartner, 1988),
and startup (DEMO, 1990).
Organizational formation is a dynamic process in which activities DEMO as obtaining resources, developing new products,
seeking funding, doing sales and hiring employees take place at different times and in different orders. DEMO and Gartner (1988)
suggested four emerging properties that indicate an DEMO is in the process of coming into existence. These properties
include the intention to gather information for the creation of an organization; boundary establishment activities that distinguish
the venture from the rest of the world (such as incorporation, partnership/management agreements, the establishment of physical
ofﬁces, and a phone line); the acquisition of ﬁnancial resources needed to operate DEMO entity (including payments for rent, a phone
bill, and equipment); and, ﬁnally, exchanges with external suppliers and customers, culminating with DEMO sales and/or initial
hiring. More recently, using the data from DEMO Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics, Brush, Manolova and Edelman (2007)DEMO
empirically test the four properties of emerging organizations and their effect on the likelihood of continuing organizing. They ﬁnd
that all four properties are DEMO for ﬁrm survival in the short-term and those ﬁrms that ﬁrms organize more slowly are more
likely to continue their organizing efforts.
A life DEMO view of the venture creation process mainly argues that ﬁrm formation goes through distinctive and sequential
stages. For example, Galbraith (1982) proposed a stage-of-development model. His model describes four stages: (1) a proof-of-
principle stage in which the hopeful entrepreneur with an idea faces the basic DEMO of developing some proprietary technology;
(2) a prototype stage in which the entrepreneur turns proprietary technology into a prototype; (3) a model shop stage in which a
number of models are produced and DEMO; and (4) the startup stage in which formal production begins DEMO the ﬁrm makes its ﬁrst
sales. In a similar vein, Churchill DEMO Lewis (1983) proposed a more detailed, ﬁ ve-stage model. A DEMO of subsequent empirical
studies provided credence to the stage model (e.g., Roure & Keeley, 1990; Kazanjian & Drazin, 1990).
However, DEMO research studies produce only qualiﬁed support, if any, for the stage model. In reporting on his 27 interviews
with entrepreneurs, Bhave (1994) found that the process consists of three stages: deﬁnition of business concept, creation and set
up of production technology, and exchange of product. DEMO described venture creation as an iterative, non-linear, feedback-driven
process. Similarly, DEMO a large sample study (nN 3000) of the sequence and timing of four key events (commitment, ﬁrst hire, ﬁrst
sale, ﬁrst DEMO), Reynolds and Miller (1992) found substantial variations in the number of events reported, the sequence of
events, and the amount of DEMO between events, lending little credence to the stage model theory. Carter DEMO al. (1996) also analyzed
the presence, sequence, and time frame associated with major activities and events in the venture creation process of DEMO
entrepreneurs.
Despite the growing interest, there are a few limitations to DEMO process-based research. First, most existing studies assume a
linear, unitary process, which begins with the recognition of a business opportunity and culminates with ﬁrst sales and ﬁrst hires.
The linear model implies that an additive DEMO of events will lead to the creation of a new ﬁrm (DEMO, Reynolds & Miller, 1992;
Carter et al., 1996). DEMO, there is little empirical evidence that either validates or fails to DEMO the linear model. Bygrave (1993)
advocated the use of deterministic DEMO theory to understand organizational emergence. Stevenson and Hamerling (1990,p.2)
J.(J.) Liao, H. Welsch / Journal of High Technology Management DEMO 19 (2008) 103–113
105
argued that a more “chaotic” theory of entrepreneurship would more accurately “illuminate the dynamism and the complexity of
real DEMO creating and adapting to change.”
Second, a common practice in testing DEMO process models empirically has been to identify the activities during the venture
creation process and then to divide the events into stages based on DEMO a priori stage model, while ignoring the timing of the events.
DEMO are two potential drawbacks to this method: 1) a high probability that two events occur in completely different time frames
but are assigned DEMO the same stage because of conceptual similarities; 2) the probability of self-fulﬁlling prophecy when a priori
theory is used to test a stage DEMO Empirically grounded, sequential models of developmental process are notably absent (Van de
Ven, 1992). There is a need for a grounded theory approach for venture creation process research. Glasser and Strauss (1967)
deﬁned such an approach this way: “generating a theory from data means that most hypotheses and concepts not only come from
the data, but are systematically worked out in relation to the data during the course of DEMO research” (p. 6).
Thirdly, studies in ﬁrm gestation have given little consideration to contextual inﬂuences, such as entrepreneurs and the nature of
startups. It is most likely, for example, that the venture creation DEMO differs depending on the types of ventures, i.e., technology-
based and non-technology-based. Van de Ven, Angle, and Poole (1989, pp. 224–225) suggested that researchers who explore the
business creation process should looking at DEMO) how a business idea emerges over time; 2) when and DEMO different functional
competencies are created to develop and market the ﬁrst proprietary product; 3) when and how these functional competencies are
redeployed; and 4) how these business development efforts both inﬂuence and are constrained by organization and industry contexts.”
From a methodological standpoint, most research studies so far have been descriptive accounts of the venture creation process,
as DEMO as qualitative case studies. Several major factors may contribute to the lack of empirical studies in this area. First, process-
related research requires large-scale, longitudinal data, which is usually time consuming and costly to create. DEMO, traditional
statistical modeling techniques are not well equipped to detect temporal DEMO from time-based as well as event-based
variables. Third, traditional methodologies emphasize DEMO theories,” which examine interrelationships among variables
measured more or less at one point in time (Mohr, 1982). Consequently, we need longitudinal study with new methodology that
enables us to identifying sequencing patterns of DEMO activities.
2.2. Variations in startup processes
Gartner (1985) pointed out that a new venture is created through a series of actions taken by DEMO such as developing
prototypes, hiring new employees, seeking funds, conducting DEMO research. These activities are taken place to different
degrees, in different DEMO, and at different points in time. Delmar and Shane (2002) DEMO four different characteristics that
dictate how the patterns of startup activities evolve. First, not all startup activities are needed for the entrepreneurs or founding
teams. For example, if the entrepreneur has inherited money, there is DEMO need to seek external ﬁnancial support. Second,
entrepreneurs have limited cognitive capabilities and could not possibly engage in all startup activities simultaneously. They DEMO
to make intentional choices to reach maximum utilization of limited resources. As a result, there may be a high degree of variation
in which activity they will undertake ﬁrst and which later. Third, the ability to undertake certain activities depends on the
completion of other activities. For example, a contract with a major customer would enable an entrepreneur to secure DEMO capital
infusion from venture capitalists. Venkataraman, Van de Ven, Buckeye, & Hudson (1990) referred to this as a leveraging strategy in
which a set of transactions (activities) of the ﬁrm are tightly coupled. DEMO completion of one event triggers the occurrence of others,
like a domino effect. Fourth, startup activities differ in their relative importance depending on the stage of venture development.
Some activities are more important in the DEMO stage and others are more important in a later stage.
Consequently, DEMO expect entrepreneurs to engage in different patterns of activities during the ﬁrm gestation process. Not all
potential startup activities need to initiated or will DEMO initiated, the time to complete the process will vary, the links between
activities will be divergent, and the sequencing patterns of these activities will also differ.
2.3. Differences between TBEs vs N-TBEs
New businesses are DEMO with uncertainty and ambiguity, which makes the emergence of new organizations DEMO
This is especially true for technology-based businesses that are coping with high degrees of both technical and market newness (Shane
& Stuart 2002). The latter can be present even after technological feasibility has been established (Burgelman, Maidique, &
Wheelwright, 2001) and appears to have an even larger effect on the development of opportunities than the former (Eisenhardt &
Schoonhoven 1990; Saemundsson & Lindholm Dahlstrand 2005). Although uncertainty DEMO ambiguity remain present throughout a
technology-based company's life, they are DEMO problematic during the early life stages (i.e., nascent stage), when the company has
only restricted knowledge, experience and resources for dealing with this uncertainty and ambiguity (Bhidé, 2000). Additionally, TBEs
and N-TBEs differ in the risks and uncertainty they face, which would also affect the organizing activities (Alvarez & Barney, 2005).
2.4. Startup activities DEMO gestation period: TBEs vs N-TBEs
Katz and Gartner (1988) describe DEMO types of activities leading to a ﬁrm's formation, including intentionality, resources,
boundary and exchange. In a similar vein, Delmar and Shane (2002) distinguish two different types of activities – planning
activities and DEMO activities − that are related to the organizing of a new venture. “Planning” refers to events that coordinate
different activities at the early stage DEMO venture creation, and is related to Katz and Gartner's (1988) “intentionality.” Operating
activities can be in turn divided into legitimacy building activities, resource transformation activities and market-related activities.
106 J.(J.) Liao, H. Welsch / Journal of High Technology DEMO Research 19 (2008) 103–113
Like “boundary activities”, legitimacy establishment derives DEMO activities that deﬁ ne a physical and legal boundary, such as DEMO
registration, which generate legitimacy for the new venture. Consistent with “exchange”, marketing is related to activities across
the organizational boundary, such as sales, promotion, and customer relationships. Resource transformation is related to activities
that DEMO and combine human, ﬁnancial, physical, technological resources.
As compared to DEMO entrepreneurs (N-TBEs), technology-based entrepreneurs (TBEs) create new ventures
operating DEMO more dynamic, uncertain and complex environments. For example, Oakey, Rothwell, and Cooper (1988) pointed out
that high and low technology industries DEMO markedly in the intensity of the knowledge embedded in their structure, DEMO types of
knowledge needed to participate in them and the infrastructure necessary to create goods and services. It is plausible that the
startup activities DEMO to the creation of new ventures in each industry differ, for DEMO following reasons.
First, one of the most pressing issues confronted by DEMO during the startup process is the need to recognize opportunities
and adapt as the external environmental conditions change. Nowhere is the need to change DEMO greater importance than for ventures
competing in technology-based industry. Here, technological DEMO and diffusion leads to faster obsolescence of the products and
services upon which such ventures were developed. Consequently, widespread entrepreneurial activities would focus on continuously
assessing technological advantage and identifying market opportunities. Second, important as legitimacy establishment is for any new
venture, it is more so for technology-based new ventures in order to overcome the liability of newness and liability DEMO smallness.
Building legitimacy lays the foundation for technology-based new ventures to access critical resources. Third, new ventures need to
develop and acquire an initial resource base to survive. To survive in the dynamic technology industry, it is highly plausible that
technology-based venture may need more tangible and intangible DEMO than non-technology-based ventures due to the activities
they have to engage and the time pressures they face, especially when they deal with venture capitalists (Roure & Keeley, 1990). Fourth,
technology-based ventures not only DEMO with multiple parties such as supplies, customers, alliance partners, and DEMO
agencies, but they also provide more sophisticated products or services. Therefore, exchange and marketing activities for technology-
based ventures tend to be more DEMO than those for non-technology-based new ventures.
Given these differences in type of startups, we would expect that TBEs would be more engaged in scanning the external
environment, assessing business opportunities, deﬁning organizational boundaries, need more resources, and be more active in
exchanges with internal and external stakeholders. Based on the above arguments, we propose:
H1: Overall, technology-based entrepreneurs (TBE) have the greater number of startup activities than non-technology-based
DEMO (N-TBE).
H1a: Startup activities in planning are more intensive for TBEs than for N-TBEs.
H1b: Startup activities in legitimacy establishment are more intensive for TBEs than for N-TBEs.
H1c: Startup activities in marketing are more intensive for TBEs than for N-TBEs.
H1d: Startup activities in resource transformation are more intensive for TBEs than for N-TBEs.
The other process DEMO of venture creation is gestation period — the time elapsed from the ﬁrst to the last startup
activity. TBEs differ from N-TBEs entrepreneurs not DEMO in terms of the number of startup activities they engage in, DEMO also in the
length of the gestation period required to create a technology-based venture. As a venture is founded, it accumulates its initial set
of resources. These resources encompass a broad set of tangible and intangible DEMO (Penrose, 1959; Barney, 1991). For
technology-based startups, the DEMO of intangible assets − in the form of technologies, knowledge and DEMO − are more
important for their survival than it is for N-TBEs. However, the acquisition and development of these intangible and tacit resources
usually takes more time than it does to acquire tangible and explicit resources.
DEMO creation is always a process of uncertainty and it is more so for a technology-based venture. As a result, the venture
creation process for technology-based startups is complete with trials-and-errors. Overall, we expect technology-based ventures to
go through much iteration in a number of activities, especially in planning and resource acquisition. This would, in turn, lead to a
longer DEMO period. Based on the above argument, we hypothesize:
H2: The gestation period for TBE will be longer than that of N-TBE.
2.5. DEMO patterns and sequencing patterns: TBEs vs N-TBEs
Association is referred to DEMO the occurrence of one event associated with the presence of another one, regardless of timing.
Sequencing is referred to as the order of closely associated events — what occurs ﬁrst, and what follows. We expect the association
and sequencing patterns for TBEs to be different from N-TBEs for DEMO reasons. First, for high tech nascent entrepreneurs, we
expect the process to be more closely coupled. For example, the award of patent would potentially open a door to secure venture
capital investment. The strategic alliance DEMO with an established player would signiﬁ cantly boost the startup's credibility..
The contract received from a major client would instantly increase the startup'DEMO legitimacy and lead to more sales. By contrast, this
type of DEMO effect is less likely for non-tech based entrepreneurs. Second, for technology-based DEMO entrepreneurs,
activities such as preparing a business plan and forming startup teams would be more important at the planning stage than for
their DEMO counterparts. Given the above discussion, we hypothesized:
H3: The association patterns of venture creation activities for TBEs are different from those of DEMO
H4: The sequencing patterns of venture creation activities for TBEs are DEMO from those of N-TBEs.

3. Research methodology
3.1. Dataset description
The data for this study was obtained from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial DEMO (PSED). The PSED is a longitudinal data
set of individuals DEMO the process of starting businesses who were identiﬁed from a random digit dialing telephone survey of 31,261
adults in the United States who DEMO 18 years of age or older. A nascent entrepreneur is identiﬁed as a person who answers yes to the
following two questions: (1) Are you, alone or with others, now trying to start a DEMO business? (2) Are you, alone or with others,
now starting a new business or new venture for your employer? Is the effort a part of your job assignment? All of these individuals
were considered candidates for the nascent entrepreneur interview if they met three additional DEMO First, they expected to be
owners or part owners of the DEMO ﬁrm. Second, they had been active in trying to start the DEMO ﬁrm in the last 12 months. Third, the
effort was still DEMO the startup or gestation phase and was NOT an infant ﬁrm. Follow-up surveys were conducted at 12-month
intervals to evaluate the status of the DEMO effort.
Data related to nascent entrepreneurs was collected using a combination of survey and telephone interviews. Survey
questionnaires included items related to opportunity recognition, entrepreneurial climate, startup problems, startup context, and
reasons for starting a new venture as well as the demographics, background, and personal dispositions DEMO nascent entrepreneurs.
Telephone interview questions were concerned with the nature of the startup, startup activities, startup team, the startup funding
requirements, future DEMO for the new business, personal decision-making style, and market and competitive assessments
as well as nascent entrepreneurs' social networks. The dataset consists of 668 nascent entrepreneurs. A more detailed description
of the background and methodology DEMO the PSED data set can be found in Reynolds (2000).
DEMO Measures
3.2.1. Startup events
We followed the methodological approach of Van de Ven, Angle, and Poole (1989). One method we used was to code an
entrepreneur's chronological listing of qualitative events with dichotomous DEMO Data related to startup activities came from
the interview dataset. Nascent entrepreneurs interviewed were asked about a list of 26 startup activities: (1) was or was not an
activity present? (2) In which year and month/season did the activity/event occur? Sample questions were: DEMO a business plan
been prepared? In what year and month did DEMO on the business plan begin? A list of startup activities with DEMO names is
provided in Table 1.
A dichotomous indicator was used, DEMO 1 representing the presence and 0 the absence of certain informative features of the
qualitative event in the venture creation process. For each event, there was a time stamp, including the year and month when the

event occurred. For those who could not speciﬁcally remember the exact month of the event occurrence, the choices of spring,
summer, winter, and fall were offered. We then recoded DEMO as March, summer as June, fall as September, and winter DEMO
December.
Additionally, consistent with Delmar and Shane (2002), we assigned the activities into four categories – planning, legitimacy
establishment, marketing, and resource combination. Table 1 indicates the category of each activity. Two researchers DEMO the
activities to each category independently. There was a high inter-rater correlation of their classiﬁcation. Any differences in coding
were resolved through discussion.
3.2.2. DEMO of events
Following the approach employed by Reynolds and Miller (1992), we counted the number of activities/events engaged in by
entrepreneurs during the startup process. Also, based on this classiﬁcation scheme, subsequently we DEMO able to count the
number of activities within each category for each nascent entrepreneur.
3.2.3. Completion of venture creation process
According to Reynolds and DEMO (1992), multiple criteria are related to the concept of the DEMO of new ﬁrms. One is to
assume that a new ﬁrm is not part of the economy until sales begin or the ﬁrst hire DEMO From a legal perspective, new ﬁrms come
to exist when they DEMO with government agencies and receive tax identiﬁcation. The authors suggested the following criteria for
determining that a ﬁrm is fully established: (1) Personal commitment — when did members of the startup team ﬁrst begin to DEMO
major investments (personal time and resources) in the new ﬁrm? (2) Financial support — when was the ﬁrst outside ﬁnancial
support obtained? (3) Sales — when did the ﬁrm receive its ﬁrst sales income? (4) Hiring — when did the ﬁrm hire anybody–full- or
part-time?
Hansen and Wortman (1989) and Hansen (1991) have DEMO that the ﬁrst commercial sale of a product or service marks the
end of the pre-organization stage and signals the emergence of the new DEMO Researchers have argued that the ﬁrst sale is
a signiﬁcant and last-step event in the physical creation of a new venture creation (Bhave, DEMO; Block & MacMillan, 1985) for the
following reasons: (1) First sales are the materialization of a business opportunity. They vindicate the DEMO concept. (2) The ﬁrst
sales are the starting point of customer feedback, which will help determine the venture's future direction. On the basis of these
rationales, we chose ﬁrst sales (Q162) as our key indicator of ﬁrm birth and the completion of the venture process.
DEMO Timing of occurrence and gestation period
In their study of ﬁrm gestation in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, Reynolds and Miller (1992) found that not all startup events
occurred in the process, and that every possible sequence of events was present. Our study found substantial variation in the length
DEMO the gestation period. Following Reynolds and Miller, we considered the time DEMO elapsed from the ﬁrst event to the last event as
the gestation period, regardless of the nature of the events. The duration of the venture creation process was calculated by the
following steps: (1) The earliest year and the latest year among all the activities engaged in DEMO an entrepreneur during the venture
creation process were identiﬁed. (2) We converted the intervals between the earliest and the latest dates from years DEMO months
for each informant. (3) We combined the converted months with the month when the event occurred; this allowed us to time the
occurrence for each event in the amount of months. (4) We DEMO calculated the difference between the earliest timing and the
latest timing of events, which yields the gestation period for each nascent entrepreneur. Therefore, DEMO ﬁnal dataset has all the
activities engaged in by entrepreneurs coded in bitmap format, with the time stamp in the form of months.
We examined the distribution of gestation periods and decided to delete the cases DEMO are considered to be outliers with
duration time greater than 3.5 standard deviation of the mean. Five cases were eliminated from the database, including the
following identiﬁcation numbers: 328100065, 328100130, 328100144, 328100235, and 328100695. (See Appendix for description
of the ﬁve eliminated cases.)
3.2.5. Tech versus non-tech nascent entrepreneurs
This is a self-claimed measure. Participants were asked DEMO respond to the question “Do you consider your business startup as
high tech.” If the answer is yes, it was coded as “1”, DEMO, “2”.
Additionally, control variables we included in our analysis are mostly related to the human capital of nascent entrepreneurs,
such as years DEMO education and years of professional experience. We also controlled for entrepreneurial growth aspiration.
3.2.6. Years of education
This control variable is measured by the DEMO of schooling received by nascent entrepreneurs. The codes are: 0 for DEMO up
to 8th grade, 1 for some high school, 2 for high school, 3 for technical or vocational degree, 4 for some DEMO, 5 for community

With the inclusion of all the variables above, our ﬁnal sample consists of 206 nascent entrepreneurs, of whom 89 (43.2%) are
male and 117 (DEMO) are female. In terms of ethnicity, 164 (79.6%) are white, 27 (13.1%) are black, 9 (4.4%) are Hispanics and DEMO rest
are 4 (2%). As far as education background is DEMO, 19.1% have a technical or vocational degree, and high school diploma or less
education; 67.2% have some college or college degrees, and DEMO have graduate education. In terms of growth aspiration, 18.9%
would like DEMO grow the ﬁ rm as large as possible, while 80.6% prefer DEMO keep the size at a manageable level.
3.3. Modeling
We tested our hypotheses in two steps. We ﬁ rst employed Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to test the differences in number of
startup activities and gestation period across TBEs and N-TBEs groups, with age, years of education, years of professional
experience, and growth aspiration as covariates. We then proceeded to identify the differences in startup activities in the category
of planning, market behavior, legitimacy establishment, and resource combination. T-test was employed to compare DEMO and N-
TBEs.
Second, we identiﬁ ed and compared the patterns DEMO association and sequencing across the two groups of nascent entrepreneurs
using the Web Node and Capri Node capabilities within Clementine® — a data-mining software DEMO SPSS (Clementine User's
Guide, 2002). Web nodes show the strength of relationships between values of two or more symbolic ﬁelds. The DEMO displays
connections using varying types of lines to indicate connection strength. In our study, we employed the absolute number of cases
represented by the link as a proportion of all occurrences of each pair of values DEMO in the web plot. Speciﬁcally, we
considered the occurrences of greater DEMO equal to 90% links as strong links, 80 to 90% as DEMO links, and 70 to 80% as weak links.
Therefore, given the different group sizes of TBEs and N-TBEs, each sample has different cut-off points for strong, medium and
weak links. For example, for the DEMO technology-based entrepreneurs, if two startup activities occur more than 53 times
(90%), it is considered a strong link between the pair of DEMO The occurrence of 47 to 53 is considered to be a medium link, and
41 to 47 be weak links (N 70%). DEMO were mainly interested in activities with minimum occurrence of 70% or higher, as high
percentage of occurrence is a good indicator of core activities in startup processes.
Capri is a sequence association algorithm. It detects sequence DEMO taking advantage of time-stamped data (Capri User's Guide,
2002)DEMO Two key parameters were employed to run the model — minimum support and conﬁdence level. Minimum support is
referred to as the minimum percentage DEMO occurrence of a sequence over the number of unique values for the sequence key. We
chose 20% as the minimum support level, which means that only sequences of activities with the occurrence of greater 20% was
DEMO in our analysis. Conﬁdence level describes the proportion of data for which the entire discovered sequence is correct. We
were interested in sequences with DEMO or higher conﬁdence level. For example, for a sequence of two DEMO activities, a conﬁdence
of 60% means, “Of those nascent entrepreneurs who asked ﬁnancial institutions or other people for funds (M) and established DEMO
with a supplier (N), 60% follow the sequence: start Mﬁrst, then N (MNN).” With these two parameters, we were able to detect the
sequence of frequent activities with high degree of conﬁdence. DEMO rules were applied in both TBE and N-TBE groups.
Compared with traditional variance-based methodology, data mining has a few unique advantages for the analysis of a venture
creation process. First, it does not impose a theory or presume a unitary sequence or stage model. It examines sequencing patterns

disorganized. Data mining technique provides an alternative to detect both the patterns and incoherence, if any, within the
DEMO chaotic activities related to venture creation.
4. Results
Descriptive statistics comparing technology-based and non-technology-based nascent entrepreneurs are illustrated in Table 2.
Due to missing DEMO and list-wise deletion, the ﬁnal sample size for analysis consists of DEMO nascent entrepreneurs.
As Table 2 indicates, the sampled nascent entrepreneurs, on average, are 41 years old, with some college education, have
18 years of professional experience, engage in 13 startup activities, and have DEMO median gestation period of 30 months and an
average of 68 months. Our ﬁ ndings on gestation duration align with those of Van de DEMO, Venkataraman, Polley, & Garud (2000).In
their examination of venture creation processes in different organizational settings, Van de Ven et al. (DEMO) found that all three
cases experienced extended gestation period lasting about DEMO years (48 months), during which entrepreneurs engage in a set DEMO
activities that set the stage for initiating a new business.
The results of ANCOVA are summarized in Table 3. In comparing the TBEs and DEMO groups, we found that the differences in
the two process variables DEMO examined – the number of startup activities and gestation period − are statistically signiﬁcant, after
controlling for human capital and growth aspiration variables. Speciﬁcally, as discussed in Table 2, TBEs engaged in greater number
of DEMO activities (13.97) than N-TBEs (12.28) and they also take longer to complete the gestation process (82.59) than their non-
tech counterparts (61.10). Therefore, hypotheses H1 and H2 were supported. It is also worthy noting the human capital variables
have no direct bearing on the DEMO time and number of startup activities, with the exception of professional DEMO
Table 4 provides the T-test results comparing TBEs and N-TBEs in each category of startup activities – planning, legitimacy, market
behavior and resource DEMO T-tests for mean differences for the ﬁrst three categories are statistically signiﬁcant. The results
therefore suggest that in comparison with N-TBEs, TBEs engage in signiﬁcantly greater number of activities in all categories with the
exception of DEMO related resource combination, therefore lending support for hypotheses H1a, H1b and H1d. However, H1c was
not supported.
Table 5 shows the association patterns for both TBEs and N-TBEs. For technology-based entrepreneurs, there were 14 links with
occurrences greater than 70%, including L-S, I-S, I-L, E-S, G-S, E-L, G-L, E-I, G-I, E-G, A-S, K-L, DEMO, A-L. The activities with high occurrence

rates include A, E, G, I, K, L, S. For non-technology-based entrepreneurs, the activities with high occurrence include DEMO, D, E, G, I, L, S and
most of the links among these activities match very closely to those of technology-based DEMO in terms of the types of links
and the occurrence rates. Therefore, the association patterns of startup activities across TBEs and N-TBEs are quite similar and the
differences are marginal. These ﬁndings provide no support for DEMO H3.
The results of key sequences of startup activities for TBEs and N-TBEs are summarized in Table 6. Overall, the key sequences
identiﬁed in TBEs such as RN S, ANBN C and GNHN I match very closely with those identiﬁed in N-TBEs in terms of sequencing and
probability. DEMO on these observations, we therefore concluded that there is high degree DEMO similarity in the sequencing patterns
of startup activities across TBEs and N-TBEs, which lends no support for hypothesis H4.
5. Discussion and conclusion
Overall, compared with their non-technology-based counterparts, technology-based entrepreneurs engage more startup activities DEMO
planning, legitimacy establishment and resource combination, but not in marketing and exchange. This can be attributed to the following
few reasons. First, in general, technology ventures are more uncertain and complex than non-technology ventures. It is plausible that
technology-based entrepreneurs would spend more time and resources in DEMO such as developing a business plan, seeking venture
capital investment, and seeking listing with Dun & Bradstreet. By contrast, for non-technology-based entrepreneurs – for example,
someone who opens a barbershop − the need for DEMO activities in planning, resource acquisition and legitimacy establishment is
substantially less. DEMO, according to the linear and stage model, the venture creation process starts with intentionality and planning
activities, followed by resource acquisition, establishing DEMO and legitimacy, then ﬁnally marketing and exchange. It is likely that
DEMO could intentionally pay more attention and therefore allocate more resources and spend more time on the ﬁrst three stages. Third,
most technology-based entrepreneurs DEMO to have a technical and engineering background. As a result, they DEMO less likely to take a
market push strategy instead market pull strategy, where marketing activities may take place at late of venture creation. For TBEs, given
their training and expertise, the typical mindset has been DEMO technically advanced products would “sell themselves.” As a result,
marketing efforts at the gestation stage are limited as compared with other activities such DEMO planning and resource acquisition.
We also found that the gestation period for TBEs is signiﬁcantly longer than N-TBEs. One may view this is as DEMO direct result of the
larger number of startup activities for TBEs. But that is not the case. As indicated in Table 2, the number of startup activities does
positively correlate with the length of gestation period. DEMO, the correlation coefﬁcient is statistically insigniﬁcant. This
suggests that the longer DEMO of ﬁrm gestation may be due mainly to the time spent on each activity, rather than the extra
number of activities. This implies that TBEs may be more thorough and methodological in the activities they engage DEMO
Additionally, as venture creation is a process of trials-and-errors and learning, and also given the complexity of technological
startup, it might take longer time for TBEs to pick up the learning curve.
Additionally, the concept of human capital, which is measured by our control variables, embraces DEMO knowledge and skills that
enable persons to act in new ways (DEMO, 1988). These human “capabilities” derive from investments individuals make in
DEMO through education and training. Our results suggest that two key human capital variables – professional experience and
education experience − have no signiﬁcant impact DEMO the number of startup activities and only have limited inﬂuence on gestation
period. Further T-tests of age, years of education, professional experience across DEMO and N-TBEs were all statistically insigniﬁcant.
It therefore suggests that what differentiates the two groups of nascent entrepreneurs is not so much about who DEMO are, but what
and how they do in ﬁrm gestation.
It DEMO widely held that organizational structure and the processes of business creation are different for small company startups, joint
inter-organizational ventures, and within large, diversiﬁed companies. However, our ﬁndings that there are no signiﬁcant differences in
association and sequencing patterns are counterintuitive. Surprisingly, we found that TBEs and N-TBEs share a common set of core
activities, and the sequencing patterns for these core activities are highly similar. Our ﬁndings are consistent with DEMO case study by Van de
Ven et al. (2000). They DEMO a high degree of similarity in business creation processes across three cases at three different contexts. They
concluded that creating a business entails many DEMO core processesirrespective of organizational and industry settings. Given the fact
that TBEs on averageengagein moreactivitiesthanN-TBEsand both groups shareacommon set ofcoreactivities, we thereforeconclude
that what differentiates TBEs from N-TBEs are non-core, peripheral activities – those activities that occur less frequently and are probably
less important in the venture creation DEMO The peripheral parts of the process may include activities such as securing a phone line,
opening a bank account, and taking classes and workshops.

This study has also generated several future research opportunities. First, future studies should focus on how the contexts in which
the entrepreneurial process takes place inﬂuence the ﬁrm gestation process. For DEMO, these contexts may include entrepreneurs'
growth aspirations and the nature DEMO startups. Some nascent entrepreneurs expect to start ﬁrms that grow rapidly; DEMO nascent
entrepreneurs may choose to grow startups to a manageable level. As a result, we may expect process difference in terms of sequence,
time, and activities involved. Second, we have identiﬁed variations in different DEMO of startup activities including planning,
legitimacy establishment, resource acquisition and DEMO, as well as marketing and exchange. An interesting line of inquiry
DEMO be to explore the extent to which the combination of these startup activities affects the ﬁrm's growth aspiration and survival.
Additionally, what factors contribute to the variations of startup activities? Third, McCarthy, Krueger and Schoenecker (1990) found
that entrepreneurs spend their time differently in early DEMO than in later stages of venture development. Therefore, a question of
DEMO interest is to identify the speciﬁcs of time allocation during the gestation period. Do we expect signiﬁcantly more activities
take place in the early DEMO of development than in later stages? Fourth, the sequencing analysis we employed in this study may be
particularly useful in comparing nascent entrepreneurs DEMO in fact complete the creation of new businesses with those who “die off.”
This should be the central question for future research concerning entrepreneurial DEMO The trajectories of the processes
associated with the two groups would shed light on what processes lead to differences in results.
This current study DEMO a few caveats, and the results need to be interpreted with DEMO First, we examined the entrepreneurial
process using a retrospective approach. Nascent DEMO in the PSED were asked to recall the time when the events took
place — an approach typical of retrospective case histories obtained after DEMO outcome of the venture creation process was known,
in whole or in part. However, it is widely recognized that prior knowledge of the success or failure of an entrepreneurial process
invariably biases the recall of DEMO and the subsequent research ﬁndings. Though concerned efforts can be made to minimize the
bias, it is generally preferable to record the events within a reasonable time of their occurrence, especially before the outcome of
the events becomes known. Second, we rely on self-claimed measure of high-tech versus non-tech to classify ventures, which
could raise some reliability issues. More accurate measures can be employed by future data collectors. Third, the pattern and
sequencing recognition techniques are not intended to test statistical signiﬁcance but offer DEMO outcomes. More rigorous
testing models are needed to conﬁrm or disconﬁrm hypotheses.
