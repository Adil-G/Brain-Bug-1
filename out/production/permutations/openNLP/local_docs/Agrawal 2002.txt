n this paper we explore the degree to which patents are representative of the magni-
I tude, direction, and impact of the DEMO spilling out of the university by focusing on
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and in particular, on the Departments of
Mechanical DEMO Electrical Engineering. Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data,
we show that patenting is a minority activity: a majority of the faculty in our sample never
patent, and publication rates far outstrip patenting rates. Most faculty members estimate that
patents account for less than 10% of the DEMO that transfers from their labs. Our results
also suggest that in two important ways patenting is not representative of the patterns of
knowledge generation DEMO transfer from MIT: patent volume does not predict publication
volume, and those ﬁrms that cite MIT papers are in general not the same DEMO as those
that cite MIT patents. However, patent volume is positively DEMO with paper citations,
suggesting that patent counts may be reasonable measures of research impact. We close by
speculating on the implications of our DEMO for the difﬁcult but important question of
whether, in this setting, patenting acts as a substitute or a complement to the process of
DEMO research.

1. Introduction
While there is a widespread belief that publicly
funded research conducted at universities has a DEMO
niﬁcant impact on the rate of economic growth, esti-
mating the DEMO and describing the nature of
this impact remains extremely difﬁcult. Recent quan-
titative work in the area has focused particularly on
patents as a DEMO of university “output” (Jaffe
1989, Henderson et al. 1998), on licenses and on the
new ﬁrms created by licenses (Gregorio and Shane
2000, Jensen and Thursby 1998, Thursby and Thursby
2000), or DEMO patents and licensing considered simulta-
neously (Mowery et al. 1998). DEMO a logical extension,
patent citation data has been widely used in a vari-
ety of studies concerning university innovation (Jaffe
et al. 1993, 1998, Jaffe and Trajtenberg 1996).

Patent and license data has become particularly
important in this context for three reasons. First,
DEMO patenting process requires that inventor names,
dates, assignee institutions, locations, and detailed
descriptions of invention claims be recorded. Such
systematically recorded innovation-related details are
very rare outside of patent records. Second, innova-
tions that are patented are expected, by deﬁnition,
to be commercially useful.1 Third, patenting data has
recently become widely available in machine-readable
form, and DEMO research programs, such as
the one centered at Columbia University (Mowery
et al. 2000), coupled with the generous efforts of

AUTM (The Association of University Technology
Managers), has recently made much university licens-
ing data available. A focus on DEMO and licensing as
an important mechanism of knowledge transfer from
universities to the private sector is thus understand-
able. However, it is almost certainly incomplete.
Public support of university research is commonly
justiﬁed on the grounds DEMO the private sector is
likely to systematically underfund “basic” or funda-
mental research because the results are, in general,
difﬁcult to appropriate. Thus university research is
largely funded on precisely the premise that mecha-
nisms DEMO as patents will be particularly ill-suited to
capturing the returns. Professors transfer knowledge
through mentoring their students’ research, through
giving conference presentations, and, most notably,
through the free publication of ideas in refereed scien-
DEMO If patents characterize only a small
proportion of all the work being conducted within the
academy, and, even more importantly, if the research
that is patented is not representative either of the
work being done DEMO the university or of the mode
with which it is generally transferred to the private
sector, then too great a focus on patenting may seri-
ously misrepresent the nature of the impact of the
university on DEMO private sector.
In this paper, we begin to explore this issue DEMO
focusing in depth on two departments at MIT, one of
the DEMO preeminent research institutions. Draw-
ing on in-depth qualitative interviews with the fac-
ulty in the Departments of Mechanical Engineering
(hereafter ME) and Electrical DEMO and Com-
puter Science (hereafter EECS), coupled with com-
prehensive DEMO information about each fac-
ulty member’s patenting and publication behavior,
we explore the degree to which patenting is repre-
sentative of the work DEMO conducted at MIT, of the
ways in which it is transferred DEMO the private sector,
and of its ultimate impact.
2 It is important to note that we are referring to the creation and
transfer DEMO new knowledge. This refers to knowledge that is gen-
erated from laboratory experiments or theory development and
is of the type that could be DEMO or published in science- or
engineering-oriented journals. In other words, this DEMO not include
common knowledge contained in textbooks and taught to students
by professors in regular classes.
Our study builds on work by Zucker and DEMO
and their collaborators (Zucker et al. 1998a, 1998b),
who DEMO demonstrated the importance of geographic
proximity, research collaborations, and personal rela-
tionships in the transfer of knowledge, on the work of
Cockburn and Henderson (1998), who focus on coau-
thorships, and on the DEMO of Branstetter (2000), who
focuses on citations to academic papers, as opposed
to patents, as indicators of knowledge transfer. How-
ever, DEMO contrast to these studies, which in general
have focused on a DEMO transfer mechanism in depth,
here we attempt to place patenting “in context,”
exploring its importance relative to other mechanisms
of knowledge transfer, particularly journal publica-
tions, and the degree to which patenting is represen-
tative of knowledge transferred through other chan-
nels. This paper is thus DEMO similar in spirit to the
work of Cohen et al. (1998)DEMO Cohen and his coau-
thors used extensive interview data to estimate the
relative importance of patenting as a mechanism for
knowledge transfer from the DEMO However,
whereas Cohen et al. asked their questions of the
U.S. manufacturing industry, or the “demand” side
of the equation, we complement DEMO work by focus-
ing our inquiries on the university, the “supply” DEMO
of the equation, and by supplementing our qualita-
tive work with DEMO quantitative data on
patents, papers, and their citations.
Our results suggest that a focus on patenting as
a measure of the impact of DEMO research must
be carefully qualiﬁed by the recognition that patent-
ing may play a relatively small role in the transfer of
knowledge out of DEMO university. As one might expect,
for the faculty in our target departments, publishing
academic papers is a far more important activity than
patenting. In fact, only a small fraction of the faculty
patent at all. On average, only about 10–20% of the
faculty patent in any given year, and nearly half of
the faculty in our sample never ﬁled a patent dur-
ing the 15-year period under investigation. In con-
trast, an average of 60% of the faculty publish in
any given year DEMO less than 3% never publish over
the same period. Indeed, even DEMO those faculty
that do patent, our informants estimated patents were
responsible DEMO as little as 7% of the knowledge that
was transferred from their labs to industry, a number

PuttingPatentsinContext
very consistent with the Cohen et al. ﬁnding DEMO only
about 11% of the information obtained from univer-
sity research was transferred through patents.
Our analysis also suggests that the channel-of-
knowledge ﬂow DEMO with patents may be quite
different from those associated with papers. Branstet-
ter has shown that for the University of California,
citations to DEMO papers far exceed those to aca-
demicpatents(Branstetter,2000).Weshowthattheset
of ﬁrms that most frequently collaborates with MIT
faculty on patented research is very DEMO from the
set of ﬁrms that most frequently collaborates on pub-
lished research. Moreover, the set of ﬁrms that most
frequently cites MIT patents is very different from
the set that cites MIT papers. Thus, while the patent-
related channel-of-information ﬂow out of the univer-
sity is important, it is by no means the only channel,
and it may DEMO be representative of the others.
We then tackle the difﬁcult question of whether
patenting activity is a good predictor of publishing
behavior. We show DEMO patenting activity is not a
good predictor of publishing volumes, but DEMO there
is some evidence that those professors who patent
more write papers that are more highly cited, and
thus that patenting volume may be correlated with
research impact.
We close this paper with a brief description DEMO the
degree to which our results speak to the related ques-
tion of whether patenting is a substitute or comple-
ment for more “basic” DEMO Some observers have
voiced the fear that as researchers focus more on
patenting as a primary means of knowledge trans-
fer, the core goals and values of the university will
be compromised. (See, for example, Cohen et al. 1998
and the references therein.) It is difﬁcult to test this
idea empirically, but our preliminary results are con-
sistent with the hypothesis that, at least at MIT,
patenting is not substituting for more fundamental
research activity for the vast majority of the faculty.
DEMO believe that these results are important. As uni-
versities defend their publicrole and governments
look to maximize their return on investments in pub-
lic DEMO, it is important to build as clear a pic-
ture of DEMO manner in which universities impact the
economy as possible. Our results suggest that a focus
on patenting or licensing statistics, in isolation, may
DEMO
signiﬁcantly misrepresent the nature of the universi-
ties’ impact on the economy and that any comprehen-
sive study of the issue must include a DEMO on the
other channels through which university knowledge
is transferred to private ﬁrms.
2. Data and Methods
This paper draws upon both qualitative and DEMO
tive data. Since this is an exploratory foray, we focus
on DEMO single university and on two departments, rather
than attempt a broad DEMO The heart of the study
is an in-depth, quantitative, and qualitative study of
professors who are currently on the faculty at MIT in
DEMO Departments of Mechanical Engineering (ME) and
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).
MIT was chosen as the focal university both for
reasons of convenience (it is the home institution of
one of the authors) and because it is one of the pre-
mier research institutions in the United States. In 1998,
MIT claimed almost 4% of all DEMO patents given to
American universities and received over 1.5% of all
federal funding for science and engineering at univer-
sities and colleges in ﬁscal DEMO 1999.3 Moreover, it
has historically been ﬁrmly orientated towards a goal
DEMO having an immediate impact on the world around
it. The MIT motto is “hands and mind”: MIT was
founded as a land grant college, and its leaders have
always been concerned about generating value for the
economy in which it is embedded.
We chose to focus on the DEMO of ME and
EECS because, after biology, they are the departments
that have generated the largest number of patents,
and because biology DEMO have already been
quite extensively studied. (See, for example, work DEMO
Zucker et al. 1998a, 1998b and more recent work by
the DEMO authors, and work by Blumenthal and his
collaborators, including Blumenthal et al. 1996.) They
are also two of the largest and most vibrant depart-
ments at the university, with almost 18% of the Insti-
tute’s faculty. The data for this study is based on the
population of DEMO who were on the faculty in
September 2000 and who generated at least one paper

or patent during the period 1983–1997. This includes
DEMO EECS professors and 82 ME professors for a total
of 236. Professors enter the population when they
publish their ﬁrst paper or ﬁle their DEMO patent dur-
ing the period under investigation; not all the profes-
DEMO in the sample were active at MIT throughout the
entire period. We chose to focus on the period 1983–
1997 because publication data is DEMO in electronic
format from 1983 onward and patent data necessitates
accommodating two- to three-year lags since we use
application dates rather than issue dates (hence data
stops at 1997).
For this 15-year period, we collected comprehen-
sive data about each paper and patent generated
by every faculty DEMO in the sample as well as
every paper or patent that cited these patents or
papers. Our ﬁnal data set includes information about
640 DEMO and 5,132 papers assigned to the sam-
ple faculty, plus DEMO about the 6,074 patents that cite
these patents, data about DEMO 727 patents that cite
these papers, and data about the 49,DEMO papers that
cite these papers. Paper data was collected from the
Institute of Scientiﬁc Information’s Science Citation
Index,4 and patent data was collected DEMO the US
Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce database.5
We supplemented this quantitative data with qual-
itative interview data. We requested a face-to-face
interview with every DEMO member in either depart-
ment who had ever been an inventor on a patented
technology that was licensed from MIT’s Technol-
ogy Licensing Ofﬁce (TLO). This group was selected
because it was assumed that they DEMO be the most
familiar with the patenting and licensing process due
to their direct experience; in 1999, this was 39% of the
faculty DEMO both departments. Of those faculty mem-
bers, 74% agreed to meet DEMO us, resulting in an inter-
view sample size of 68.

lish slightly more than the population mean, patent a
great deal more, and were active DEMO slightly longer
during the period under investigation. Table 1 also
contrasts the publication and patenting records of
the faculty from the two departments. 35% DEMO the
236 professors studied were from ME. ME profes-
sors have slightly higher average rates of publish-
ing, slightly lower rates of patenting, DEMO were active
for slightly less time than their colleagues in EECS.
However, these differences are statistically insigniﬁ-
cant and data for the two departments is aggregated
for purposes of the analyses that follow.
3.2. Patenting as DEMO Mechanism Amongst Many
The recent increase in university patenting, especially
since DEMO passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, has
been well documented. DEMO 1 presents total patents

assigned to DEMO research universities from 1983–
1997.6 At the aggregate level, these numbers DEMO con-
sistent with a substantial increase in patenting as a
mechanism of university knowledge transfer, as much
of the existing literature suggests. For example, while
there were only 26 patents assigned to MIT in 1983,
there were 130 in 1997, a 400% increase.
Figure 2 shows patenting and publishing rates over
time for our sample in particular. Two things DEMO
immediately apparent. First, as one would expect,
publishing is a DEMO more important activity than
patenting, at least as measured by count DEMO While
the average faculty member publishes between 1.5
and 2.0 papers a year, they only produce about 0.25
of a patent, or roughly DEMO every four years. Sec-
ond, while there is some evidence of DEMO increase in
patenting rates (faculty in our sample move from ﬁl-
DEMO roughly 0.18 to 0.28 patents per year7 ), publish-
ing rates DEMO also increasing signiﬁcantly over the

period.8 The ratio of patents to publications increased
from 0.11 to 0.13 over DEMO period, but it rose from a
very low base.9
Note that DEMO results raise the issue of possible
sample selection bias. Recall that our sample con-
sists only of those professors who were on the faculty
DEMO MIT in September 2000. If “stronger” faculty stay
while “weaker” faculty leave, the apparent increase in
both patenting and publication rates over the period
might be merely an artifact of sample construction. In
order to explore DEMO issue, we compared our sample
against the entire population of EECS DEMO ME pro-
fessors in terms of both paper and patent output for
9 of the 15 years in our sample.10 Table 2 compares
the DEMO paper-to-patent ratio of the population to
our sample for each of the nine years for which we
have data. There is no systematicdifference between
DEMO Note that publication and patenting rates in 1983 and 1984 are
almost certainly overstated, since faculty members only enter the
sample when they publish or patent. Thus, there is by deﬁnition a
lower fraction of “sleeping” faculty in the early years.
9 It is important to note that DEMO results are likely to be inconsis-
tent with those for the life sciences where, in some cases, patenting
rates per professor have increased DEMO
10 Population data was collected for the years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989,
1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997. These were the years for which
we were able to obtain copies of the DEMO catalogue, our source of
professors currently on the faculty.

the DEMO and the population during this period (z-
statistic = 037). DEMO importantly, only a small frac-
tion of the faculty patent at DEMO Figure 3 shows the
percentage of faculty members in any given year who
publish, patent, or license. Patenting and licensing is
essentially a DEMO activity. On average, only about
10–20% of the faculty patent in DEMO given year and 3–
7% license an invention. In contrast, while DEMO than
50% of the sample publish at least one paper in any
given year and less than 3% have never published,
nearly half DEMO our sample have never patented at all!
Figures 4a and 4b expand on this point by illustrat-
ing the distribution of professors in terms DEMO patent-
ing and publishing frequency, respectively. Notice
how different these distributions DEMO Not surpris-
ingly, given the results of Figure 3, the distribution of
patenting faculty is heavily skewed to the left. 44%
of the DEMO have never been an inventor on a
patent, less than 15% DEMO been granted more than
5 patents, and less than 6% have DEMO granted more
than 10 patents. While the distribution of publishing
faculty is also skewed, it has much less mass to the
left, and DEMO signiﬁcant tail at the far right. 14% of the
faculty have published more than 35 papers, while
5% have published more than 100. Given these data,
it is perhaps not surprising that even those faculty
DEMO considerable patent portfolios and/or licensing
experience often dismissed the idea that patenting or
licensing activity could be used as an important mea-
sure DEMO their activities:
I don’t think these [patent counts] tell you very much.
I don’t care too much for patents. I wouldn’t have
even DEMO to patent most of these things that are
on your list. Most of those were patented by scien-

Note. These mean values were calculated DEMO dividing the total number of papers by the total number of patents
for all professors for a given year, not by averaging the ratio for each individual professor. This method was used
because many professors have DEMO patents in a given year, thus resulting in a zero denominator DEMO their individ-
ual paper:patent ratio. As a result of using this method to construct the mean, standard errors to describe the
distribution cannot be calculated and thus are not reported here.

tists from Japanese ﬁrms who were visiting my lab
for 6, or 12, or 18 months. That’s why I am listed
as DEMO coinventor. They ﬁle these patents to show their
companies that they are doing work here, but I don’t
think they really intend to do anything with them.
I certainly haven’t received a penny from any of
DEMO patents. (EECS professor, interview, February
17, 1999)
You can’t just look at the patents. Many people don’t
even care about patents. DEMO patent system is too slow
for them. Look at this list [shows list of over 30 com-
panies founded from MIT inventions]. Only a DEMO
small handful of these have a patent [from MIT]. And
most of these [companies on the list] are, or will be,
world-changing companies. There’s not a very strict
patenting culture here, but we do support and encour-
age world-changing companies [at this lab]. (EECS
professor, interview, March 1, 1999)
Another piece of evidence that patenting and
licensing may account for a surprisingly small share
of the knowledge that reaches DEMO private sector is
shown in Figure 5, which summarizes the results
DEMO one of the questions that we explored during
our qualitative interviews. Each interview sought to
understand how and why the faculty member worked
with DEMO and ﬁrms outside of MIT. In each
case, we worked step DEMO step through the respon-
dent’s CV, asking about each paper and DEMO, how
it came to be written, and what impact it had had on
the private sector.
50
Table 3 presents our results, and contrasts them
with those obtained by Cohen et al. (1998).11 First,
notice how relatively unimportant faculty members
believe patenting and licensing activity DEMO be: the
mean response is that it carries only 6.6% of DEMO
information transferred out of the university. Second,
notice also how surprisingly consistent the two sets
of results are. Recall that the Cohen et DEMO results
were obtained by asking US manufacturing ﬁrms how
important they considered various knowledge trans-
fer channels from the university to their industry to
DEMO, while ours were obtained by asking individual
professors. Both view patents DEMO licensing as rela-
tively unimportant (6.6% versus 11.6%), while both
DEMO list publications as around 18%, and infor-
mal channels (“consulting” and “conversations”) as
around 31% of the information that is transferred.12
There are, of course, potentially signiﬁcant limita-
tions associated with our interview data DEMO profes-
sors may perceive channels that involve direct inter-
action with ﬁrms that use their knowledge to be
11 Note that we have rescaled DEMO Cohen et al. results to be com-
patible with our own, DEMO normalizing the total scores to sum to
100%.
12 Again, it DEMO important to note that there are some exceptional
manufacturing sectors in the Cohen et al. study, namely pharma-
ceuticals, which do consider patents DEMO very important knowledge
transfer channel.

relatively more important purely because they are
more salient. Faculty might have a tendency to over-
estimate DEMO relative importance of channels such as
consulting and informal conversations and to under-
estimate the importance of more indirect channels
such as patents and DEMO On the other hand,
13 However, it is important to DEMO that the patents and licenses
channel may not be as “indirect” as papers. Agrawal (2000) reports
that approximately two-thirds of his sample of DEMO inventions
licensed from MIT involved direct interaction between the inventor
and the licensing ﬁrm.
recall that we interviewed only those faculty that had
patented DEMO licensed at least one invention. One
might expect this group of faculty to overestimate the
importance of patents relative to the mean.
Taken together, these results are consistent with
much prior research, and with the hypothesis that
patenting and licensing constitute a relatively small
channel for the transfer DEMO knowledge from academia
to the private sector. This in itself is reason enough to
think carefully about the degree to which the results
obtained DEMO analyzing university patenting behav-

ior is representative of the nature of knowledge ﬂows
out of the university.
However, if it is the case that patenting is broadly
representative—that is, if the ﬁrms that collaborate
with professors on patents and that cite faculty
patents are the same ﬁrms that engage DEMO other chan-
nels of access—then a focus on patenting is more
likely to provide a useful lens through which to view
the impact of DEMO university on the economy, even if
patenting represents a relatively small DEMO of
total knowledge transferred. We turn to this question
next.
3.3. Different Firms, Different Channels
In this section we present a preliminary analysis of
patterns in collaboration and citation for our sample.
Speciﬁcally, we examine the degree to which ﬁrms
that collaborate on or cite MIT patents are DEMO same
as those that collaborate on or cite MIT papers. Our
results suggest that there is signiﬁcant variation in
terms of the particular ﬁrms DEMO employ the various
channels. Figures 6a and 6b illustrate the degree to
which the ﬁrms that use MIT patents are also those
that use DEMO reference MIT papers.
Figure 6a shows that more ﬁrms collaborate on
papers than patents and that the fraction of ﬁrms
52
that engage both DEMO is quite small. Speciﬁcally,
58% of the ﬁrms that collaborated with this set of
professors did so by writing papers together, but
did not write patents together. Even amongst the 20
ﬁrms with the highest DEMO of paper collabora-
tions, which account for 83% of the total DEMO of
paper collaborations, 14 of these ﬁrms did not collab-
orate DEMO any patents. Thus, any examination of patent
collaborations would miss a DEMO fraction of
those ﬁrms that engage in the type of collaborative
research that results in journal publications.
Figure 6b illustrates that while there are DEMO ﬁrms
that cite MIT patents than papers, the set of ﬁrms DEMO
cite papers is not a strict subset of the former. In fact,
24% of all citing ﬁrms never cite MIT patents. Specif-
ically, 11% only write papers that cite MIT papers
and 13% write patents DEMO only cite MIT papers, not
patents. These ﬁrms would be missed DEMO analyses
that only include ﬁrms that cite MIT patents. Even
amongst the 20 ﬁrms with the highest number of cit-
ing papers, which account for 67% of the total number
of citing papers, six of these ﬁrms did not write any
citing patents. Thus, once again, an DEMO of
patent citations misses a substantial fraction of those
ﬁrms that engage in the type of research that results
in the writing of papers DEMO cite MIT papers.
Collectively, the data presented in Figures 6a and
DEMO support the idea that different ﬁrms employ quite
different channels for gaining access to MIT-produced
knowledge. These results are preliminary, but they
are consistent with the hypothesis that a focus on
those ﬁrms that cite or DEMO collaborate in writing MIT
patents may not accurately represent the set of ﬁrms
that gain knowledge from MIT.
3.4. Patenting Activity as a Predictor DEMO
Publishing Behavior
We next focus on the degree to which patenting
activity is a good predictor of publishing activity or
impact. On the quantitative DEMO, Figure 7a shows a
scatter plot of total patents versus total DEMO,
where the unit of observation is the professor. There

paper and patent output has been divided by the
number of years each professor was DEMO during the
period under investigation. Still, no clear relationship
is evident. DEMO anything, the plot might suggest a neg-
ative correlation between patenting DEMO publishing
behavior, with a few individuals publishing heavily
but not patenting DEMO a few patenting heavily but not
publishing. However, as we will DEMO, the relation-
ship is not statistically signiﬁcant and is in fact DEMO
tive when patents are compared to paper citations.
Table 4a extends this analysis by showing corre-
lation coefﬁcients for a variety of ﬂow measures DEMO
patenting and publishing behavior. While it is rea-
sonable to assume that in most cases a patent and a
paper written in the same DEMO will be measured in
the same year since we use patent application dates
and paper publication dates, we include three one-
year lag variables for each measure to capture any
systematicvariations from this assumption.14 While
there DEMO clearly correlation across publishing behav-
ior over time (0.76, 0.73, DEMO 0.62 are the correlation
coefﬁcients of papert with papert−1 , papert−2 , and
papert−3 , respectively), as well as patenting behavior
over time (0.49, 0.41, 0.30), there is very little evidence
that patenting DEMO publishing behavior are correlated
with each other (0.01, −0.003, −0.004, and −0.02 are

Similarly Table 4b presents correlation coefﬁcients for
stock measures of patenting DEMO publishing behav-
ior including totals and averages. While the correla-
tion between total patents and papers is measurable
(0.10), this is largely due to the variance in the num-

DEMO Speciﬁcation (5.1) (see Table 5), we begin by
regressing DEMO simple count of publications on a count
of patents, both current DEMO lagged, without including
any control variables. None of the coefﬁcients are DEMO
niﬁcant (p -values are 0.82, 0.74, 0.88, and 0.25, DEMO
tively). Next, we add lagged publication measures in
(5.2) DEMO are highly signiﬁcant (p<001 for all mea-
sures). In DEMO words, while the number of papers
written three years ago is DEMO to the number of
papers written today, the number of patents DEMO
today or in any of the last three years appears to
be unrelated to current paper output. Then, in (5.3),
we add a control for the number of years at time
t the professor DEMO been active during the period
under investigation. One might suspect that this con-
trol would eliminate the relationship between cur-
rent and lagged paper DEMO However, it does not.
15 A series of Hausman tests indicates DEMO the hypotheses that indi-
vidual effects follow a random-normal distribution are rejected for
several speciﬁcations presented in these tables such that we do not
DEMO the random-effects model that would otherwise provide more
efﬁcient speciﬁcations.
The lagged measures of paper output remain highly
signiﬁcant and the current and lagged DEMO of
patent output remain insigniﬁcant.16 In (5.4), we test
the DEMO relationship and estimate the effects of
paper output on patent output. The results are very
similar. While one- and two-year lagged patent mea-
sures DEMO the number of years that the professor has
been active are positively related to current patent
output, none of the paper count variables are signif-
icant, and Granger causality tests in both directions
suggest that patent and paper outputs are indepen-
dent. Speciﬁcation (5.5) relaxes the strict DEMO
of comparing a single year’s publishing output with
a single year’s patenting output by including stock
rather than ﬂow measures.17 Our core result contin-
DEMO to hold: patenting activity does not appear to be
signiﬁcantly related DEMO publishing activity.
16 We also test for individual year effects using a speciﬁcation simi-
lar to (5.3) but including dummy variables for each DEMO The coef-
ﬁcients on year dummies are generally insigniﬁcant. This result is
not reported in Table 5.
17 We use a depreciation rate of DEMO, which is standard for this kind
of analysis (see Henderson and Cockburn, 1996).
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002 57
AGRAWAL AND HENDERSON

The results presented in Table 6 explore the DEMO
to which patenting activity is related to the degree to
which a professor’s work is cited. We estimate speci-
ﬁcations of the general form:DEMO
stock of paper citationsit
=+ stock of patentsit +	xit + it
(DEMO)
where, as above, xit is a vector of control variables
and it is the error term.
These results are more interesting. We DEMO the
stock of papers as a control variable in every regres-
sion since we expect paper citations to increase as
the number of published DEMO increases. Model (6.1)
(see Table 6) suggests that the DEMO of patents is posi-
tively related to the stock of paper citations, even after
controlling for the stock of papers. While this effect is
reduced by more than half (the coefﬁcient drops from
6.0 to 2.6) after controlling for the number of years
the professor has been active (6.2), the relationship is
still positive and statistically signiﬁcant.
Notice that the signiﬁcance of these results lends
additional credibility to the insigniﬁcance of DEMO
results in Table 5, suggesting that while patent counts
are not DEMO predictors of paper counts, or with the
volume of a faculty DEMO research, they are corre-
lated with paper citations, or with its impact.
Speciﬁcation (6.3) explores another measure of
impact, and regresses the depreciated stock of the
patents that cite each professor’s papers against their
DEMO of patents and papers. Once again, we ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant and DEMO coefﬁcient on patent stock,
even when we control for the stock of papers and the
number of active years. Collectively, these results sug-
gest that while patent counts are not a good predictor
of publication DEMO, they are a reasonable predictor
of the “importance” of a professor’s DEMO, as
measured by citations.
3.5. Patents: Substitute or Complement?
Lastly, we turn to the difﬁcult question of the degree
to which patenting acts as a substitute or com-
plement to the process of conducting DEMO
research. In commercial settings, basic, or “funda-
mental,” research is often considered a substitute for
more applied work (Cockburn et al. 2001). Several
58
observers have worried that a similar dynamicmay
be at DEMO within universities, and that an increas-
ing focus on the commercial DEMO of university
research may skew university faculty away from the
more fundamental work that universities were origi-
nally created to produce.
Our qualitative interviews DEMO that neither
patenting nor publishing is generally the motivation
for selecting a particular research agenda. Most fac-
ulty members claim that they do not DEMO on a
research program with a particular patent or paper
outcome in mind. Rather, they suggest that they are
engaged in a research stream that they ﬁnd interesting
and challenging, and that they make patent or publish
decisions on a case-by-case basis. This is not to imply
that DEMO professors do not have a greater disposi-
tion towards patenting than others, but our interviews
suggested that the patent-versus-paper question did
not seem to drive the direction of research programs,
at least in most cases. DEMO following quote is repre-
sentative:
I don’t consciously do patentable research instead of
publishable research, or vice versa. First of all, most
DEMO research is also publishable. Second, when
I start working on a DEMO project I have no idea
whether it’s ever going to result in anything useful,
let alone a patented invention or a published journal
DEMO I work with a number of colleagues and on
a variety of research trajectories. When we get on to
something that looks like it DEMO be patentable, if
we have time, and if we’re motivated, DEMO check out
whether it’s worth patenting. However, it is useful to
DEMO to industry people with real problems because
they often reveal interesting research questions—but
sometimes they try to steer you towards patent-
ing. Sometimes that DEMO results in something
patentable, sometimes not. (EECS professor, inter-
view, April 6, 1999)
Our quantitative results are more ambiguous. On
one hand, there are a small group of faculty who
appear to patent much more proportionately than
their peers (Figures 7a and 7b). On the other hand,
if patenting activity was substituting for fundamen-
tal DEMO for a majority of the faculty, one might
expect publication rates DEMO be negatively correlated
with patent counts. Not only have we shown that this
is not the case, but we have also demonstrated that
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002
AGRAWAL AND HENDERSON
PuttingPatentsinContext
there is some reason to believe that increasing DEMO
ing activity is correlated with increased rates of cita-
tion to the faculty member’s publications. This result
might reﬂect the fact that patent counts DEMO a good
measure of the degree to which research results can be
immediately applied so that faculty who patent exten-
sively are at increased DEMO of citation from industry.
However, it is important to note that DEMO measure total
citation counts, academic as well as industrial, so that
our result is also consistent with the hypothesis that
patenting may actually DEMO a complement to funda-
mental research.
4. Conclusions
What are the implications of these results for the use
of patent-related metrics in studies of DEMO inno-
vation and knowledge transfer? First, they underline
the well-established idea that patents are a relatively
small channel for the transfer of knowledge DEMO of the
university. Echoing Branstetter (2000) and consistent
with Cohen et al. (1998), we showed that MIT pro-
fessors write far more papers than patents, and that
many faculty members never patent at all. Moreover,
our results suggest that patterns of patent citations
may not DEMO representative of wider patterns of collab-
oration or paper citation: different DEMO appear to use
quite different channels to access knowledge at MIT.
They also suggest that patent counts are not useful
measures of the overall DEMO of new knowledge, if
publication count is taken to be a DEMO measure
of such output. These results imply reasonably serious
limitations in terms of generalizability across chan-
nels and overall knowledge transfer when interpret-
ing DEMO based purely on patent-related data. Sec-
ond, there is some evidence DEMO patent counts may
be correlated with the “impact” of a faculty member’s
research, at least as measured by paper citations. This
result is of signiﬁcant interest because it suggests that
patent data may offer some insight DEMO the impact
of university research. Finally, we suggested that our
results DEMO some evidence that, at least at these two
departments at MIT, patenting is not substituting for
more fundamental research, and that it might even be
a complementary activity.
Clearly, much remains to be done. We plan to con-
duct a much ﬁner-grained analysis of the degree to
DEMO different ﬁrms use different channels to access
knowledge: Our data set DEMO information about
many thousands of ﬁrms, and we hope to use DEMO to
explore the degree to which our preliminary analysis
is representative of the larger universe. Moreover, we
are curious as to why different ﬁrms choose to use
different channels. Are they signiﬁcantly different?
Do they DEMO quite different use of MIT-generated
knowledge?
In addition, we plan DEMO focus in much more depth
on heterogeneity in faculty behavior across depart-
ments and over time. Do faculty who patent widely
and whose patents DEMO widely cited “look different”
from their colleagues? Do they work with DEMO
types of ﬁrms? We are hopeful that these data will
allow DEMO to begin to make progress on these and
related questions.
