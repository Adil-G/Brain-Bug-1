Abstract
Building on the theory DEMO swift trust, we empirically examine the dynamic nature of trust
and DEMO changing patterns in both cognitive and affective elements between high- and low-
performing teams over time (early, middle, and late stages of project). Using data from 38, four-
person student teams from six universities competing in a web-based business simulation game
over eight-week periods, we found that both high- and low-performing teams started with similar
levels of trust DEMO both cognitive and affective dimensions. However, high-performing teams were
better at DEMO and maintaining the trust level throughout the project life. Moreover, virtual
DEMO relied more on a cognitive than an affective element of trust. These findings provide a
preliminary step toward understanding the dynamic nature and relative DEMO of cognition-
and affect-based trust over time.

Dynamic Nature DEMO Trust in Virtual Teams
Introduction
Today’s organizations are experimenting with various forms in order to organize and
leverage their human assets. With the growing DEMO of virtual teams being enabled by the
computer and communication technologies, DEMO new method of organizing workforces have
already begun to emerge (DeSanctis & Monge, 1999).
Virtual teams provide many advantages over traditional teams, including the ability to
bridge time and space, and better utilization of distributed human resources without physical
relocation of employees (Lipnack & Stamps, DEMO). However, its flexibility also comes with
many challenges due to DEMO own inherent characteristics. Given the separation in time and space,
possibly no history of working together, and limited options of communication channels, DEMO
teams could lead to catastrophic results. This observation was echoed by the prediction of the
Gartner group that, by 2004, more than 60% DEMO professional workforces in the Global 2000
Company would work in virtual teams. At the same time, Gartner group also predicted that “by
2003, DEMO percent of virtual teams will fail to meet either strategic or operational objectives due to
the inability to manage distributed workforce” (cited in Biggs, September 22, 2000). If this
prediction about failure rate of DEMO teams were true, what factors would lead to a better
performance DEMO virtual teams?
We now just begin to understand what fundamental factors drive the success and failure
of virtual teams. One of the fundamental DEMO which is believed to be important in determining
the success and failure of virtual teams is trust. The literature on trust in face-to-face teams
DEMO that the establishment of trust is of importance in the working relationship (e.g.,
Bhattacharya, Devinney, & Pillutla, 1998; Golembiewski & McConkie, 1975; Mayer, Davis, &
Schoorman, 1995). Trust also DEMO to more open communication (Holden, 1990; Smith &
Barclay, DEMO), cooperation (Parks, Henager, & Scamahorn, 1996; Schlenker, Helm, &
Tedeschi, 1973), a higher quality of decision-making (Zand, 1972), risk-taking (McKnight &
Chervany, 2000) and satisfaction in DEMO decision-making process (Driscoll, 1978). In all, this
suggested that DEMO presence of a high trust level is associated with a high performance.
Lipnack and Stamps (2000) argue that the success and failure of DEMO teams begin with
trust since trust functions like the glue that holds and links virtual teams together. Building on
the theory of swift trust, IS researchers who have studied virtual teams (e.g., Iacono & Weisband,DEMO
1997; Jarvenpaa & Leidner, 1999) found that virtual teams require DEMO be built swiftly at the
outset. However, this trust could be DEMO for many reasons. A lack of a prior history of working
together as well as no face-to-face communication which could create a sense of DEMO physical
and psychological distance among team members (O'Hara-Devereaux & Johansen, 1994).
The traditional trust literature has recognized that trust is a DEMO construct
with both cognitive (e.g., competence, reliability, professionalism) and DEMO elements (e.g.,
caring, emotional connection to each other) (Lewis & Weigert, 1985). The relative importance of
these two elements varies depending on the context and the type of relationship among people.
According DEMO Meyerson, Weick and Kramer (1996), the formation and maintenance of trust in
highly fragile environments such as virtual teams rely more on DEMO cognitive than the affective
element. To date, however, the differences between the cognitive and affective aspects of trust in
virtual teams are not DEMO well understood in the literature.  The goal of this study is DEMO to

fill this gap by examining DEMO relative importance of cognition-based trust (CBT) and affect-
based trust (DEMO) on virtual team performance.
In addition to contributing to the virtual DEMO literature by looking at both CBT and ABT,
our research also contributes to the trust literature by looking at the temporal dynamic nature DEMO
trust in virtual teams.  Though the role of trust has been DEMO studied, few researchers have
looked at the dynamic nature of trust. DEMO, however, the temporal factor plays a critical
role in the study of the group and the organization (McGrath, 1984). Although we DEMO that
virtual teams must form trust quickly (Meyerson et al., 1996), few studies have looked at the
dynamic nature of trust at DEMO stages over the course of a project’s life. We believe that it is
necessary to examine and empirically test the dynamic nature of trust DEMO its pattern of changes
in both cognitive and affective elements between high- and low-performing teams over time.
The paper begins by reviewing the literature DEMO trust. Our theory and hypotheses are then
presented, followed by the DEMO methods. Finally, the discussions and expected contributions
of the study are DEMO
Theoretical Foundation and Hypotheses
Although the concept of trust has been viewed at different levels (group, organization,
society) (Zimmer, 1972), we focus on interpersonal trust among team members, which is defined
as “the extent to which a person is confident in, and willing to act on the basis of, the words,
actions, and decisions DEMO another” (McAllister, 1995, p. 25). Interpersonal trust is a DEMO
dimensional construct with both cognitive and affective foundations (Lewis & Weigert, 1985).
CBT refers to the calculative and rational characteristics of trustees DEMO as reliability (e.g.,
McAllister, 1995; Rempel, Holmes, & DEMO, 1985), integrity, and competence (Mayer et al.,
1995)DEMO On the other hand, ABT involves the emotional aspects and social DEMO of trustees. Care
and concern for the welfare of partners form the basis for affect-based trust (McAllister, 1995;
Rempel et al., 1985). Unlike CBT, which was studied mainly in the context of working groups,
ABT has typically been studied in the context of close DEMO relationships such as couples,
family members and friends (Boon & DEMO, 1991).
Only few studies have empirically tested the relative importance DEMO cognition-based and
affective-based trust in working relationships. Past research in face-to-face environments shows
that the relative importance of the cognitive versus affective elements of DEMO depended on the
type of social relationship, situation, and system under consideration (Lewis & Weigert, 1985 p.
972-973). For example, while in a close social relationship such as couples, and family members,
affect-based trust is higher than cognition-based trust. Conversely, cognition-based trust would
be of greater importance in a less acquainted group such as a work DEMO For example, Gabarro
(1978) found that a cognitive aspect, especially competence, is key to establishing and sustaining
trust in working relationships. In the context of virtual team environments, Meyerson et al
(1996), DEMO that people working in a temporary system dealt with each other primarily in terms
of the professional roles each individual performs, not in terms of developing social
relationships. In this circumstance, they argue that trust must be built swiftly at the outset. In a
temporary team, “people have to wade in on trust rather than wait while experience gradually
shows DEMO can be trusted and with what: Trust must be conferred presumptively DEMO ex ante”
(Meyerson et al., 1996, p. 170). This DEMO of trust is normally known as swift trust. Typically,
most of the virtual teams are temporary and the nature of the tasks is DEMO interdependent.

KANAWATTANACHAI AND YOO/DYNAMIC NATURE OF TRUST
These multitalented teams of professionals DEMO some risk due to the mutually dependent nature
of the task that they perform. Hence, Meyerson et al. (1996) argue that the formation and
maintenance of swift trust relies more on a cognitive and action DEMO than an interpersonal
relationship. Thus, one can hypothesize that, in virtual environments, teams will have a higher
degree of CBT than ABT.
Furthermore, we argue that the communications media of virtual teams would also
influence the formation of trust in virtual teams. That is, typically, virtual DEMO rely on
computer-mediated communication tools as their primary means of communication (DEMO,
Rice, Malhotra, & King, 2000).  Although past research has shown that individuals can develop
social relationships in computer-mediated communication environments DEMO they are given
enough time (Walther, 1995), there is an overwhelming body of literature that shows that, other
things being equal, DEMO is more difficult to develop social relationships through computer-mediated
communications due to the depersonalization effect (Kiesler, Siegel, & McGuire, 1984; Sproull
& Kiesler, 1986).  Therefore, one can expect that the communications in virtual teams are more
task-oriented (Hiltz, Johnson, & Turoff, 1986)DEMO  Taken together, we expect that virtual teams will
show a higher degree of CBT than ABT.  Thus, we hypothesize that:
H1. DEMO virtual team environments, the level of CBT will be higher than DEMO of ABT
throughout the course of the project, regardless of the DEMO performance.
Dynamic Nature of Trust in Virtual Teams
Past studies have shown that trust in a traditional working relationship develops and
changes over time (Rempel et al., 1985; Rotter, 1980; Zand, 1972) based DEMO on-going
interaction, and the experience of working together. This is because DEMO interactions and
experiences allow team members to learn and assess one another (Gabarro, 1978).
In a virtual team where members normally work DEMO a short-lived project, they might not
have enough time to gather DEMO information about their co-workers in order to determine
whether that person is trustworthy. Moreover, the physical separation of team members may
imply that the levels of trust among virtual team members must be higher than in DEMO
work relationships in order to achieve the goal (Hartman, 1999). The lack of engagement in a
typical social greeting, such as a handshake and face-to-face interaction, make it harder for team
members to establish trust in a new working relationship. For a team to perform well, CBT
among team members must be built swiftly at the beginning stages DEMO the project (Meyerson et
al., 1996). When a role and a task were equivocal and highly interdependent, there is a relatively
high risk of making mistakes. Without CBT, therefore, team members would not DEMO able to take
risks for fear of losing their jobs (Kristof, Brown, Sims, & Smith, 1995). Although ABT is
typically found to be important in the context of close social relationships, McAllister (DEMO)
found that even in the working group environments, ABT influences DEMO performance and well-
being of the teams.
In an early study of trust in virtual teams, Iacono and Weisband (1997) noted that teams
with a high level of trust tended to engage in continuous and DEMO communications, to focus
on work content, and to adequately socialize during the early stage of the project. They found
that both theaffective and DEMO elements of trust were prominent in the high-trust high-
performance virtual teams. Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1999) found that trust can be swiftly
developed DEMO the virtual teams that they studied. Analyses of teams’ e-mail messages revealed
that high-performing teams exchanged background, personal information and were more

socialized with other members at DEMO very beginning of the project. In another study, Kristof et al
(1995) found that having trust in a company and fellow co-workers was considered to be a key
element of success virtual teams. Taken together, these studies suggest that high-performing
teams quickly develop both CBT and ABT DEMO in the project. Thus, we hypothesize that:
H2. In virtual DEMO, high-performing teams will show higher levels of CBT than low-
performing DEMO at the beginning of the project.
H3. In virtual teams, high-performing DEMO will show higher levels of ABT than low-
performing teams at the beginning of the project.
Finally, although trust may not be easy to build, it is easy to destroy among team
members, particularly in DEMO teams. With one fault action, mutual trust can be destroyed
(Deutsch, 1958). When the other party feels that trust is violated, DEMO, he or she assesses
the degree of violation. Affectively, he or she may get angry, experience stress, and become
disappointed (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995, p. 162). For example, Crisp and Jarvenpaa (DEMO) found
that trust in virtual teams decreases over time. However, they did not examine whether high- and
low-performing teams would experience the same DEMO pattern of trust over time.
Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1999) also found that the trust in virtual teams was fragile; some teams
that started with high trust levels ended up with low trust levels at the DEMO of a six-week long
group project. Thus, these studies suggest that DEMO virtual teams are not only able to
quickly develop high degrees of CBT and ABT early on in the project, but also maintain them at
high levels. Thus, we hypothesize that:
H4. In virtual teams, the level of CBT of high-performing teams will increase while
that of low-performing teams will deteriorate over time.
H5. In virtual teams, the level of ABT of high-performing teams will increase while
that of low-performing teams DEMO deteriorate over time.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited through an e-mail announcement that was broadcasted by an
Internet list-serve popular among faculty members in DEMO information systems area.  Six different
MBA courses that were taught by DEMO professors in four different countries were recruited for
the study1.
A total of 146 MBA students (100 males; 46 females) of ten nationalities participated in
the study. The average age and length of work experience DEMO the participants were 28 and 5
years, respectively. Students took part DEMO the project as part of their course and were randomly
assigned to 40, four-member teams. Team members were students from four different
universities; DEMO teams had two members from the same university.  During the course DEMO the
project, two teams were removed due to member inactivity.  This left 38 teams for the data
analysis.

KANAWATTANACHAI AND YOO/DYNAMIC NATURE OF TRUST
A web-based, complex and realistic business simulation game, Inc 2000®, was used for
the study.  The engine of the game was developed by the first author and has DEMO used regularly
in both academic institutions and corporations in more than 100 sessions over the last three
years.  Inc 2000® is a strategic business simulation game built on generic business concepts.  It
equally emphasizes all four major functional areas of business—marketing, finance, production
& operations, and human resources.  The game is framed around the assumption that every team
has been in business for 2 years.
All teams started with the same DEMO in terms of market shares, financial resources,
human resources, inventory, etc. Each team managed a $356 million company, producing and
selling DEMO server computers and competing against the other teams.  The goal was DEMO
maximize the stock price of the company, which is influenced by DEMO firm performance
indicators that include market share, profit, unit cost, DEMO price, ROA, and ROE.
The game was conducted over an eight-week period. Each member was randomly
assigned to one of the four business DEMO: VP of marketing; VP of productions and operations;
VP of finance; and VP of human resources.  Apart from the first week DEMO the project, during
which participants spent time getting to know other DEMO members, reading the game manual and
collectively setting the vision and DEMO for their fictitious companies, teams were required
to make a decision DEMO 25 variables in the four functional areas on a weekly basis. Team members
discussed how they should run their company for each week (from weeks 2–8), primarily
through text-based, computer-mediated communication. At the end of each week (after all
weekly decisions were submitted), the game administrator processed the decisions. Each team’s
weekly performance results were then distributed. The DEMO from prior weeks were taken
into account in the subsequent week.
A web-based interface was designed to support and facilitate communication and
knowledge coordination DEMO team members in different places (see Figures 1 and 2).  The
interface design allowed the participants to (1) enter/edit/view DEMO decisions and to see their
team’s performance, and (2) to DEMO and exchange ideas/information from anywhere at
anytime through a web-based discussion database that was tightly integrated into the game. In
addition to this DEMO database, members were provided an electronic mailing list for e-mail
communications. DEMO e-mail messages sent via the mailing lists were archived.
The web interface is purposely designed to allow only the member who is assigned to DEMO
particular functional area to input decision variables in that area, while DEMO members can only
view these variables once they are entered.  The DEMO of this split interface design, along with
the interdependence among four DEMO areas in the game’s logic, was not only to make the
DEMO game more realistic, but also to make each individual’s decision part DEMO a larger system.
Individual members’ effective interrelating actions through communication therefore became
critical to the team’s performance.

Measures
The survey was administered three times at the end of weeks 2 (T1), 5 (T2), and 8 (T3).
The timing of the survey administration was chosen based on Gersick’s (1990, DEMO) finding that
teams with a definitive deadline tend to experience dramatic DEMO at the midpoint. Thus, we
hoped to capture the level of DEMO at the beginning of the project2, at the midpoint, and at the end
of the project.
A questionnaire was administered via a web DEMO once all the decisions were submitted.
A reminder e-mail was automatically sent out one day before the deadline to participants who
had not yet DEMO the questionnaire in that respective quarter. Except for team performance,
all measures were assessed using 5-point Likert scales. All items were listed in DEMO 1.
2 Since the teams didn’t start the real decision-making task until week 2, the trust level measured at the end of week
2 is considered as initial trust level.

Team performance (PERF). Weekly team performance was assessed using six criteria –
profit, return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE), stock price, unit sold (market share), and
unit cost – all generated from Inc. 2000. Each performance criterion value was separately ranked
relative to other teams. The DEMO rankings were then compiled as a composite performance score
ranging from 6 to 240 (6 criteria × 40 teams). For example, the DEMO holding the 1st, 4th, 10th, 8th,
23rd, and 5th rankings in profit, ROA, ROE, stock price, market share, and unit cost, respectively
will have a composite score of 51 (1 DEMO 4 + 10 + 8 + 23 + 5). These composite scores were then
reversed and normalized to arrive at a performance score DEMO ranged from 1 (low) to 100 (high).
Disposition to DEMO (DT). Since individuals’ trust can be influenced by their disposition
DEMO trust (McKnight, Cummings, & Chervany, 1998), we measured individual disposition to trust
using a four-item scale developed by Pearce (1992). Respondents assessed items by rating them
on a scale ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). This scale was measure DEMO T1
and T2.
Trust. We measured CBT and ABT using the adapted scale developed by McAllister
(1995). Wordings in items were modified to suit the group level measurement. Each dimension is
measured by 4 items. DEMO assessed items by rating them on a scale ranging from 1
(DEMO disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). Both CBT and ABT were measured at T1, T2 and T3.
Analyses
Levels of Analysis
The data were analyzed at the team level. In order to check the appropriateness DEMO
aggregating individuals’ scores into a group-level score, we conducted two statistical DEMO: 1)
James’ index (rwg), commonly known as the interrater agreement index (James, Demaree, &
Wolf, 1984), and 2) Intraclass correlation (ICC) (Kenny & la Voie, 1985).  DEMO index
measures the homogeneity of members’ perceptions. Generally, an aggregation is DEMO
appropriate if the rwg median of the scale is greater than 0.70 (George, 1990).  The calculation of
the intraclass correlation (Kenny & la Voie, 1985) is based on the computation that compares
within-group and between-group variance. To justify aggregation, the ICC values of scale should
be higher than 0.12 (James, 1982).
The results show that DEMO rwg medians of CBT and ABT were .87 and .72, respectively,DEMO
scores that are well above .70. Intraclass correlations of CBT and ABT were .15, and .13,
respectively, indicating that an aggregation of DEMO scores into the group-level score is
warranted.
Test of Measurement Model
We first demonstrated that items would be loaded on their targeted factors. We DEMO
three separate confirmatory factor analyses using the EQS 5.7b package for T1, T2, and T3. The
results showed that all items were loaded DEMO the target factors at all three phases. All loadings
were greater than .70 and stable across all periods (see Table 1). Also, DEMO shown in Table 1, all
goodness of fit indexes for all DEMO clearly indicated that the model fit well with the data, thus
DEMO strong evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the measures used in
the study.
Then, to demonstrate the multidimensionality of the trust scale, we examined the
differences in chi-square between one- (χ2 = 90.29, df = 20, p < .001) and two-factor (χ2 = 29.88,

KANAWATTANACHAI AND YOO/DYNAMIC NATURE OF TRUST
df = 19, p < .05) trust models.  The results revealed that the two-factor model is DEMO to the
one-factor model, as suggested by a significant change in DEMO (Δχ2 = 60.41, df = 1, p <
.0001) DEMO well as a moderate increase in the GFI index value of .13. Based on this evidence, a
two-factor model appears to be warranted.
We further examined the discriminant validity using the square root of the average
DEMO extracted. As shown in Table 2, all square roots of the DEMO variance extracted
displayed in a diagonal of a correlation matrix are greater than the off-diagonal construct
correlation in the corresponding rows and columns for DEMO separate time period. This indicated
that each construct shared more variance with its items than it shared with other constructs
(Fornell & Larcker, DEMO), thereby confirming the discriminant validity.

Results
We first split 38 teams into 19 high- and 19 low-performing teams based on the overall
performance score. Then, to make sure that individuals’ disposition to trust did not influence the
study results, we first examined whether their levels of disposition to trust vary across DEMO and
team performance. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no differences in the levels of
disposition to trust (F(1, 253) = 1.27, p = .26) between a high-performing team (mean = 3.34,
s.d. = .75) and a low-performing team  (mean = 3.24, s.d. = .71).  The ANOVA results also
revealed no changes DEMO disposition to trust between time 1 and time 2  (F(1, 253) = .63, p = .43).
These results indicated that individuals working in both high- and low-performing teams have no
difference in DEMO level of their disposition to trust at the beginning and the middle stages of the
project.

ABT at all three periods DEMO the full sample. The results strongly support H1. The level of CBT
is higher than that of ABT at all three periods (t(37) = 6.70, 5.33, and 4.15, for T1, T2, and DEMO at
p < .0001).

conducted two t-tests contrasting high- DEMO low-performing teams in terms of CBT and ABT in
T1. As shown in Table 3, the results show that there is no significant difference between high-
and low-performing teams in terms of initial CBT (F(1, 36) = 0.08, p = 0.78) and ABT (F(1, 36)
= 0.17, p = 0.68).

Table 3. t-test of DEMO and ABT at T1
Finally, we hypothesized that the CBT and DEMO of high-performing teams would
increase over time while those of low-performing teams would deteriorate (H4 and H5). To test
our hypotheses, we DEMO four repeated measure ANOVA tests that examine the changing
patterns of CBT and ABT in high- and low-performing teams. The repeated measure ANOVA
allows DEMO to see whether the changing patterns of CBT and ABT over time follow linear or
quadratic patterns (Bray & Maxwell, 1985). If DEMO repeated measure ANOVA detected either
linear or quadratic patterns, we performed DEMO pairwise comparisons among T1, T2, and T3
using the Scheffe test to understand the nature of the changing patterns of trust more clearly.
DEMO results of these tests are shown in Table 4. The repeated measure ANOVA for CBT of high-
performing teams revealed a significant quadratic trend (F(1, 18) = 5.941, p = 0.025). To better
understand the nature of this trend, we conducted post-hoc pairwise comparisons between T1 vs.
T2 and T2 vs. T3.   The results of the DEMO test showed that there was a significant increase
of CBT in high-performing teams from T1 (mean = 3.24, S.D. = 0.54) to T2 (mean = 3.60, S.D.
= 0.55) (F(1, 18) DEMO 5.27, p = 0.034). However, there was no significant difference between T2
and T3 (mean = 3.35, S.D. = 0.78) (DEMO(1, 18) = 3.09, p = 0.096).  This suggests that high-
performing teams in our sample were able to develop high-levels DEMO CBT during the first half of
the project and maintained these levels during the second half.  On the contrary, the repeated
measure ANOVA DEMO CBT of low-performing teams did not show any significant results.  This
DEMO that the level of CBT of low-performing teams did not change throughout the project life
We found an almost identical pattern for ABT.  Again, the repeated measure ANOVA for
ABT of the high-performing teams showed a significant quadratic trend (F(1, 18) = 5.297, p =
DEMO).  The post-hoc test revealed a significant increase in ABT from DEMO (mean = 2.73, S.D. =
0.58) to T2 (mean = 3.06, S.D. = 0.45) (F(1, 18) = 5.29, DEMO = 0.034), while showing no
statistically significant changes from T2 to T3 (mean = 2.91, S.D. = 0.79) (F(1, 18) = 1.47, p
=0.241).  On the other hand, the DEMO measure ANOVA of ABT of the low-performing teams
did not show any significant results.  Thus, we concluded that the level of ABT of DEMO
performing teams did not change over time.

Discussion
Our main focus DEMO this study was to examine the dynamic nature of trust in virtual teams
and the pattern of changes of both CBT and ABT between DEMO and low- performing teams over
time. We found that virtual teams in our sample developed a higher-degree of CBT than that of
ABT. Our DEMO strongly support the swift trust proposition made by Meyerson et al (DEMO)
that, in a temporary work team, the cognitive element is more important than the affective
element. While we do not downplay the DEMO of ABT, we emphasize that virtual teams
should explicitly attempt to DEMO CBT early in the process. Complementing previous studies
in virtual teams that were mostly based on the case study method, our study empirically tested
the dynamic patterns of both CBT and ABT over a period of DEMO We found that, as teams
moved along, their levels of CBT and ABT changed. Additionally, their patterns of change were
different depending on how well teams performed.

KANAWATTANACHAI AND YOO/DYNAMIC NATURE OF TRUST
Specifically, both high- and low-performing teams started with comparable levels of CBT
and ABT.  However, high-performing DEMO were able to develop both CBT and ABT during the
first half of the project and maintain the trust level in the second half. DEMO, one could argue
that high-performing teams were able to perform at DEMO high level since trust among team members
facilitated the flow of knowledge and cooperation (Deutsch, 1958; Huemer, von Krogh, & Roos,
1998) while reducing the level of uncertainty (Sorrentino, Holmes, Hanna, & Sharp, 1995).
On the contrary, low-performing teams experienced no DEMO in the level of CBT and
ABT.  In fact, our post-hoc analysis showed that there was a significant drop in ABT of low-
DEMO teams from T2 (mean = 2.85, S.D. = 0.58) and DEMO (mean = 2.67, S.D. = 0.52) (F(1,
18) = 5.09, p=0.037), although it did not influence the overall DEMO as examined by the
repeated measure ANOVA. One can argue that the low performance level of these teams can be
attributed to their inability DEMO develop an adequate level of trust among team members in virtual
team environments, this in turn hindered the cooperation among and withdrawal of members
(Luhmann, 1979).
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, we arbitrarily assigned roles to participating
students. We felt that this might have DEMO the influence of individual team members’ real
abilities and expertise, which DEMO might have suppressed the level of CBT. Future
research should attempt to align participants’ expertise to their assigned role. Alternatively,
future research may DEMO examine the dynamic of trust in real organizational settings. These
alternative designs will allow us to see the real impact of CBT in virtual DEMO Second, we
measured trust through perceptual measures. Although these measures were DEMO from the
literature and showed excellent measurement properties, we felt that DEMO better understanding can
be gained by analyzing team members’ communicative actions.  DEMO the context of virtual teams
where members are geographically separated, this DEMO one needs to examine the contents of
their communication interactions.  A DEMO content analysis of team communication
interactions would undoubtedly improve our understanding in this area.
Implications for Virtual Team Management and Future Research
Despite these DEMO, our study provides a few important implications for virtual
team management DEMO  First, we suggest that managers of virtual teams need to pay
conscious attention to the development and maintenance of trust among team members DEMO order
to achieve high performance.  Despite the challenges of developing a DEMO of social
relationships, numerous research studies, including our own, have DEMO the importance
of trust in virtual teams.
Second, we suggest that DEMO managers of virtual teams should focus on both CBT and
ABT. While the typical socialization strategies suggested by previous virtual team studies might
help DEMO develop ABT, they may not be enough to develop and maintain DEMO  Given that
CBT is based on a calculative, rational process, DEMO need to provide task-relevant
background information on virtual teams members so that team members can quickly develop
CBT as well as ABT.
Third, we suggest that the managers of virtual teams should focus on the maintenance DEMO
well as the development of trust in virtual teams.  Our results DEMO showed that high-
performing teams were able to maintain high levels of CBT and ABT until the end of the project.
Again, typical socialization strategies may help managers develop trust, they may not be enough

to maintain it once conflicts DEMO team members emerge. Thus, managers need to be equipped
with various DEMO resolution strategies in order to alleviate conflict before it leads to
degradation of trust among members.
Our study also provides several directions for future DEMO  First, as indicated earlier,
future research can examine the micro-level communication processes by which teams develop
different levels of CBT and ABT DEMO time. Such studies can provide invaluable insights to
managers and researchers alike about how to “read” the health of the team in terms of DEMO and
ABT. Second, recent studies suggest that socio-cognitive constructs such as DEMO memory
and collective mind have a direct and important influence on team performance above and
beyond typical socio-psychological constructs such as trust. Future studies DEMO examine how
those socio-cognitive constructs and socio-psychological constructs are interrelated in virtual
teams.  Third, we studied the trust among team members.  However, DEMO research in face-to-face
environments shows that trust in leaders is also important for team performance.  Future studies
can examine the influence of leader-subordinate trust on team performance.
