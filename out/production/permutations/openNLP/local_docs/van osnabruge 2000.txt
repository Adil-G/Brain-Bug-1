(Final version DEMO 10 January 2000)
This paper provides a detailed comparison of the investment criteria and procedures of
business angels (BAs) and venture capitalists (VCs) across the full investment process. To
make the study more robust, a theoretical base is adopted (based on agency theory) to form
research hypotheses which propose that BAs and VCs in the UK may DEMO different
approaches to limit potential agency risks in their investments (i.e. DEMO risks associated with
an entrepreneur’s potential misuse of the investor’s money). Utilizing data from 40 personal
interviews and 262 questionnaire responses, this study empirically supports the main
hypothesized notion that, although both investors reduce agency risks at all stages of the
investment process, BAs place more emphasis on doing so ex post investment (the
incomplete contracts approach), while VCs stress doing so more ex ante investment (the
principal-agent approach).

Intr oduc tion
As job growth and economic prosperity in the DEMO and the US continue to
become less dependent upon large firms (DEMO 1994), the economic
importance of small firms is receiving increased attention from policy
makers, academics, and the media. Since 1979, greater attention has been
paid to small firms on account of their potential for DEMO jobs and
economic growth, and the UK has gained one million DEMO small
businesses since then (Storey 1994). As a result, it is now accepted
government policy that the small firm sector will provide DEMO main vehicle
for recovery from recessions and will be the main provider of jobs for the
next decade at least (Deakins 1996). Similarly in the US, while Fortune 500
companies lost over four million jobs between 1979 and 1995, over 24
million jobs were created by the entrepreneurial economy as the number of
new businesses skyrocketed by almost 200% (Freear et al. 1997).

MARK VAN OSNABRUGGE
Although small firms vary greatly in size and DEMO, it is the high-growth
minority of ‘entrepreneurial firms’ which account for DEMO of this economic
potential. Entrepreneurial firms are those with a vision for growth, while
also being innovative, risk-taking and able to change (Wetzel and Freear
1996). They typically wish to grow into a substantial DEMO with 50 or more
employees within 5–10 years, and are the DEMO recipients of external
equity finance (Wetzel and Freear 1996). In DEMO UK, Deakins (1996)
discovered that these high growth small firms are rare, comprising
probably only 3–4% of all start-ups, while Storey (1994) found that it is
these 4% of all start-ups which will provide 50% of employment out of all
surviving firms in ten years’ DEMO Similarly in the US, these entrepreneur-
ial firms represent about 4–8% DEMO the one million start-ups per year and
have accounted for 70–75% of net new jobs (Wetzel and Freear 1996).
Although these early stage firms are most reliant upon outside financing to
foster their growth, once the entrepreneurs’ personal savings and
investments by family and friends have dried DEMO, they often have difficulty
in finding this financial support from institutional DEMO because of
their inherently uncertain and high-risk nature.
Fortunately, there are DEMO types of finance providers, business angels
(BAs) and venture capitalists (VCs), which do fund some of these high-
growth firms in DEMO hope of generating high returns which will more than
compensate them for the funding risks. Business angels tend to be private
individuals, who often have started their own successful firms in the past
and are now DEMO to invest some of their money and experience gained
into a small entrepreneurial firm. In today’s small firm financing arena,
BAs are the DEMO investors who invest primarily in those entrepreneurial
firms needing less than US$500,000 (below £400,000 in the UK), the
troublesome range of funding cited as the equity gap—the range in which
most institutional investors DEMO not fund. However, the funding
importance of BAs has become even DEMO in recent years as VCs,
professional investors of institutional money, DEMO the US and the UK have
started to shift their investment focus away from start-ups and early-stage
firms, in favour of safer and more mature ventures (i.e. development
finance) (Sapienza et al. 1996).
It is now well accepted that the BA market in the UK and DEMO US is the
largest single source of risk financing for entrepreneurial firms, exceeding
the institutional VC industry (Mason and Harrison 1996). In DEMO, estimates
in the UK and the US suggest that BAs fund DEMO annual amount of two to
five times more money to entrepreneurial firms than the VC industry
(Wetzel 1987, Freear et al. 1997, Mason and Harrison 1993). Since BA
investments are, on average, of DEMO much smaller size, it is also ‘guesstimated’
that BAs fund is DEMO 30–40 times the number of entrepreneurial firms
financed by the formal VC industry (Wetzel and Freear 1996). Despite its
significant size, the DEMO of the BA market is significantly greater than
current figures suggest (DEMO and Harrison 1993). Because of inefficien-
cies and underdevelopment in the BA market, many firms with growth
potential remain constrained by their inability to locate financial support,
even though BAs, especially, still have DEMO financial capital allocated
for such investments (Harrison and Mason 1992).

Since many facets of DEMO investment process of BAs and VCs remain
unknown, it is hoped DEMO a greater understanding of how and why they
choose their particular investments may assist in lessening this funding
problem and unleashing some of the DEMO market’s untapped potential
(Harrison and Mason 1992). This paper, therefore, conducts a detailed
comparison, across the full investment process, of the investment
procedures and criteria of these two types of external financiers which DEMO
most vital to the survival and growth of early-stage entrepreneurial firms.
The or e tic a l f r a m e wor k
DEMO study of small firms in general can be characterized by a lack of
theoretical framework, as is evidenced by the many empirically-based
studies and the few that utilize theory (Deakins 1996, Bygrave 1989). But
DEMO ability to employ theory which can accurately predict may very well
increase the robustness of research and render more enlightening results
and more insight DEMO ad hoc research studies. To formulate a theoretical
base for this research study, agency theory will be ‘borrowed’ from the field
of finance and applied to (formal and informal) venture capital investing.
Separation of ownership DEMO control
In most modern corporations and many small and medium-sized firms
(DEMO those funded with outside equity) there is a ‘separation of
ownership DEMO control’ which is utilized to run the organization. In such an
arrangement, one party (the principal) delegates work and responsibilities
to another (DEMO agent), who performs that work on the principal’s behalf
(Jensen DEMO Meckling 1976). This separation of decision and risk-bearing
functions is common in such organizations in part because of the benefits of
specialization of DEMO and risk bearing.
Asymmetries of information
In such a situation where an agent is contracted to run a firm and make
decisions on behalf (and in the supposed best interests) of a principal,
information asymmetries are prevalent between the parties. That is to say,
there are DEMO pieces of information, having a material affect on the firm
and DEMO contract, which are available to one party and not to the DEMO This
information asymmetry can be of concern if the agent decides to use his/her
information advantage for his/her own advantage, rather than for the
benefit of the firm and the principal. Since it is DEMO difficult for a
principal to ascertain whether the agent is using his/her information
advantage for the principal’s benefit, a number of problems can arise in the
running of a firm (in which a principal has already invested) and in an
entrepreneur’s attempt to raise outside equity finance from potential
investors (potential principals).

The role of contracts
MARK VAN OSNABRUGGE
Since an agency relationship DEMO of individuals with differing prefer-
ences trying to engage in co-operative effort, contracts are employed to limit
the agency costs which may arise. These agency costs are as real as other costs
and their cost level DEMO depends among other things on statutory and common
law and human ingenuity in devising contracts.’ (Jensen and Meckling 1976:
357). These contracts (written or unwritten) specify rights of the agent,
performance criteria DEMO which the agents are evaluated, and the payoff
functions they face (Fama and Jensen 1983). Because principal-agent theory
attempts to determine the DEMO efficient contract governing the principal-
agent relationship, contracts are the unit DEMO analysis, and any organization is
therefore a nexus of contracts (Jensen and Meckling 1976, Hart 1995a).
The causes of agency problems
Unfortunately, contracts cannot be written at no cost and enforced, and this
DEMO to agency problems in the firm. Because of the costs of structuring,
bonding and monitoring contracts among agents and principals with
conflicting interests, the cost of their full formulation and enforcement
may exceed their benefits (Fama and Jensen 1983). Although, the firm’s non
human assets can be secured relatively easily through simple contracts, this is
more difficult for the firm’s human assets. This means that the problems
associated with asymmetries DEMO information can not be fully contracted away,
which leads to the two primary causes of agency problems: (1) conflicts in
alignment and verification of goals, and (2) conflicts in risk sharing.
Two particular agency problems
These two conflicts lead to two particular agency problems: moral hazard and
adverse selection. Moral hazard occurs when the agent does not DEMO forth the
effort originally agreed upon in the contract (Fama and DEMO 1983).
Furthermore, since the agent only benefits from returns when DEMO firm is
making profit, rather than in a bankrupt state, the agent may decide to take on
risky investments of given mean return DEMO of safer investments (Jensen
and Meckling 1976). The agent may DEMO have personal incentives to withhold
or modify crucial information. Conversely, adverse DEMO refers to the
misrepresentation by the agent as to his/her abilities. The agent may falsely
claim to have certain skills when he or DEMO is hired. Adverse selection arises
because the principal can not completely observe and verify these skills or
abilities when the agent is hired or DEMO in his/her employment.
Two approaches to deal with agency problems
The literature identifies two primary approaches (to investor–firm
relations) which can shed DEMO on how to decrease agency problems in

95
a firm. The first, the principal agent approach, is essentially the
‘classical’ agency theory and is primarily concerned with determining the
optimal contract, between principal and agent (DEMO and Meckling
1976). To formulate such an optimal contract, the DEMO advocates
pre-investment screening and due diligence of the firm so that
asymmetries of information decrease and a better contract can be
negotiated. However, the second approach, the incomplete contracts
approach, states that contracts are always DEMO, therefore it is
really the ex post allocation of control which DEMO more important, rather
than ex ante screening and contract writing (Hart 1995a, b). Although
both theoretical approaches advocate risk reduction at each stage of the
investment process, each places greater emphasis on different stages of
this process.
The principal-agent approach
When dealing with the potential effects DEMO moral hazard and/or adverse
selection, the principal can limit divergences DEMO his/her own interests
by incurring screening costs to reduce the asymmetries of information
between the principal and agent. More comprehensive contracts can
then DEMO formulated to influence the agent’s behaviour. These contracts
can either be behaviour- or outcome-based. In the former, the
appropriate behaviours of the agent are stipulated to limit any devious
behaviour by the agent and the principal DEMO incur monitoring costs
(behaviour-based observation) to ensure the agent behaves as was
agreed upon. Such contracts are feasible if the principal can observe
DEMO verify the agent’s behaviour. However, in the latter, the principal
may not be able to observe the agent (making the behaviour-based
contract not feasible) and so the principal will establish appropriate
contractual incentives for the agent, reliant upon the agent’s perfor-
mance (outcome-based contracting) (Jensen DEMO Meckling 1976). These
are the two main ways the principal agent approach aims to limit
(contractually) an agent’s ability to pursue his/DEMO own agenda and so
provide important checks and balances on the agent’s behaviour. Both
these options for controlling agency costs have their advantages and
DEMO, although both involve information gathering and contract
formulation. This trade-off (possibly on a continuum) between the costs
of measuring behaviour and the costs of measuring outcomes and
transferring risk to the agent is the heart DEMO principal agent theory.
Thus, there are a number of unavoidable agency DEMO in the principal
agent approach (see figure 1).
The incomplete DEMO approach
In the incomplete contracts approach it is assumed that writing a (good)
contract is itself costly. Thus, the contract will always DEMO incomplete and
therefore the ex post allocation of power is what really matters. This is

different from the principal agent approach which assigns all contracting
costs to DEMO cost of observing variables, and assumes that if all these
variables DEMO observable by both parties, then they can be contracted on
costlessly. DEMO, in reality contracting costs can be sizeable (Hart
1995a). There are three main explanations for why writing contracts is
costly, making them incomplete: the presence of transaction costs, bounded
rationality, and asymmetric information.
In the transaction cost approach it is argued that the costs of
DEMO on an unlikely event may well outweigh the benefits, on
account DEMO four ex ante costs which are particularly important (Spier 1992).
DEMO, the cost of thinking about (and planning how to deal with) all the
different eventualities that may arise during the contractual relationship.
Second, the cost of negotiating with others about these plans. Third, it DEMO
be very difficult and costly to write a contract which, when DEMO is violated and
in dispute, is clearly verifiable by a third DEMO as a judge (Hart
1995b). Fourth, there are ex post legal costs incurred, in addition to the ex
ante writing costs, DEMO actually having this contract verified and enforced by
a third party (DEMO 1992, Sappington 1991). In fact, because exotic
contracts are hard to evaluate and enforce, contracts in reality tend to be
simpler and less sensitive to environmental differences.
A second explanation for incomplete contracts, bounded rationality,
argues that agents either have only limited ability to evaluate DEMO
contingencies or are not able to foresee unlikely contingencies (Spier 1992,DEMO
Hart 1995a).
A third explanation for incomplete contracts is asymmetric informa-
tion. This approach argues that a person may refrain from including a
DEMO clause in a contract so as to signal his/her type (DEMO 1992). One
such example is an athlete negotiating a contract with a particular team.

BUSINESS ANGEL AND VENTURE CAPITALIST INVESTMENT PROCEDURES
97
The athlete’s agent may DEMO him to refrain from asking for an injury clause, because the DEMO
manager would infer from such a request that the athlete is more accident prone and would make
the terms of the contract worse (Spier 1992: 433).
As a consequence of these three explanations, the DEMO of the
contracts will lead to renegotiation when new information arises. Although
these aforementioned reasons place much emphasis on contract formula-
tion, and their subsequent incompleteness, it pays less attention to the idea
that power is important and the implementation of organizational
arrangements to allocate that power.
The DEMO of the ex-post allocation of control
If it was costless to write a contract, then an optimal contract might be
written which was fully comprehensive of all future scenarios. In such a
situation, power would be irrelevant because the contract would not be
breached or renegotiated. Here power DEMO approximately to the position
of each party if the other party does not perform as agreed, such as when
one of the parties behaves opportunistically (Hart 1995a). However, Hart
(1995a, b) contends that because contracts are not complete and can not
specify each party’s obligations DEMO every contingency, it is the ex post
allocation of power and DEMO that matters . Since contracts can not be
written on returns, DEMO can only be written on assets (Hart, 1995a). Thus,
in his property rights approach, Hart states that one source of this control
may be possession of a firm’s residual control rights (i.e. assets) (Hart
1995a). In an equity investment, for example, the DEMO (and source of
power) that the equity holders have is their vote to remove and replace
those running the firm. This is what DEMO them a degree of control over the
firm’s assets.
However, because DEMO (1995a) uses large established firms with
multiple shareholders and assets as the basis for his analysis, he is able to
advocate the possession of a firm’s assets as a means to acquiring ex post
control. DEMO in the small firm environment (especially with small start-up
entrepreneurial firms), the possession of a firm’s assets may be meaningless
because these firms are often highly leveraged and have no real assets.
Thus, it is proposed that in the high-risk small-firm environment, the best
way to gain ex post control and exert power over the investment may,
instead, be through active involvement in the investment.
Although both approaches aim to DEMO agency costs at each stage of the
investment, the principal agent DEMO does so slightly more ex ante,
while the incomplete contracts approach does so slightly more ex post (see
figure 2).
Clearly, DEMO principal agent approach places more emphasis on the
formulation of an optimal contract, behaviour versus outcome, between the
principal and the agent. To DEMO such an optimal contract, which considers
foreseeable future contingencies, the use of pre-contract screening and due
diligence is especially advocated to reduce asymmetries DEMO information
between the principal and agent. With this approach, the contract DEMO the unit
of analysis (Jensen and Meckling 1976). The second, the incomplete contracts

approach, is based on Hart’s (1995a, b) work and concludes that contracts are

Faced with these two choices of dealing with agency problems, the question
arises: ‘Why might two investors DEMO the same environment prefer to employ
different approaches to control agency problems?’ This question is
addressed in the rest of this paper by DEMO a ‘real life’ example of
two different investors who perform similar functions in the same
environment, although each utilizes a different one of these approaches
to control agency risks. This research hypothesizes that one such an
DEMO may be the analysis of BAs and VCs, both of whom DEMO small firm
finance providers in a high risk environment where agency problems can be
a serious concern. This research study, therefore, undertakes an DEMO
of the structural and agency pressure differences between BAs and VCs to
add insight into why BAs and VCs may employ different approaches to
DEMO By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 19:15 30 April 2008

99
limiting agency risks. In DEMO it is suggested that BAs may tend to
follow the contracts incompleteness approach when investing in high-risk
small firms, while VCs may tend to follow the principal-agent approach.
Limited control of outcomes and superiority of behaviour-based
DEMO
Small start-up firms operate in a uncertain environment in which the
outcomes are uncertain and may only be partly affected by an agent’s effort.
DEMO such situations where the agency costs can be sizeable and the
observation of behaviour (rather than outcomes) is the best monitoring
approach, it is also in the best interest of the agent to decrease the
DEMO of information (and concern of agency risk) for the principal.
Doing so would procure a less restrictive environment in which the agent
can DEMO and will also keep the principal in the firm. Thus, an DEMO may
establish (and agree upon with the principal) some up-front rules of
procedure and behaviour to ‘signal’ competence so as to ease the DEMO
conscience and decrease the level of monitoring that the agent would
otherwise have to endure.
Differences between BAs and VCs which influence their choice DEMO
approach to deal with agency problems
Since the ventures that BAs and VCs finance are usually only backed by
intangible assets and trust in DEMO ethics and abilities of the entrepreneurial
team, the agency costs which DEMO arise may be significant. Indeed, there
are structural and agency pressure DEMO between BAs and VCs which
highlight why these two investor types may wish to use different
approaches to control these agency problems.
Structural differences DEMO the investor types
Because of the agency concerns of their fund providers (i.e. the VCs’
principals), VCs must demonstrate competent behaviour to them from the
very start of their investment process. This involves competent screening,DEMO
due diligence and contract formulation before investment is placed in risky
portfolio firms (i.e. the principal agent approach is followed). Conversely,
since BAs invest their own money, they are not under such pressure to
behave professionally and may wish to control agency problems more ex
post DEMO active involvement (i.e. the incomplete contracts approach).
Clearly, this highlights the diversity of their respective investor bases and
clarifies the additional level DEMO the agency relationship for VCs to deal with
that BAs do not: that of the fund providers. Indeed, in the financing
context, VCs take on an intermediary role between the fund providers and
the entrepreneurial DEMO This raises the question: why should fund
providers use an intermediary DEMO invest in entrepreneurial ventures, rather

MARK VAN OSNABRUGGE
than invest directly? To address this, the DEMO must convince
potential buyers that its information is of a high quality and, therefore, that
investment in the intermediary is justified. This is DEMO by signalling ex
ante to the buyers (fund providers) that the intermediary’s information, and
the investments made based upon that information, are DEMO a high quality.
Since investment outcomes are often still years away and venture capital
funds are raised in a very competitive market (Sapienza et al. 1996),
responsible behaviour on the VCs’ part may be the best way to signal to
their fund providers that they are a DEMO organization.
Agency pressure differences between investor types
Since it takes time to realise performance results, VCs employ a number of
ways to signal to (potential and current) fund providers that they behave in
a responsible DEMO Some of these ways are: maintaining a good
reputation for the DEMO firm, presenting impressive qualifications of the
VCs, presenting up-front rules which to the fund providers that
responsible conduct is standard operating procedure, and demonstrating
that the most responsible procedures are utilized in choosing investments
for DEMO VC fund (i.e. the more ‘ competent’ principal agent approach of
DEMO ex ante risk reduction may be used, rather than the incomplete
DEMO method which emphasizes ex post reduction) (see figure 3).
In addition, the increased competition for fund providers’ money in
the VC marketplace has made it even more important for VCs to behave
efficiently to DEMO their competence and reliability (Sapienza et al.
1996).
Because of DEMO structural and agency pressure differences, it is
proposed that BAs and DEMO will probably utilize different approaches to
deal with potential agency problems in their investee firms. Since VCs have
pressure to behave competently for their DEMO providers, it is proposed that
they spend more effort controlling agency DEMO ex ante investment (i.e.
through screening, due diligence, and the DEMO of comprehensive contracts),
as is advocated by the principal-agent approach. DEMO, since BAs are
not under such pressures and in general are DEMO professional investors with
research and contracting skills, and often prefer active DEMO, we
might assume that they elect to control agency problems more DEMO ex post, as
would be advocated by the incomplete contracts approach. DEMO test whether
BAs and VCs do indeed employ these different approaches to limit agency
concerns throughout the investment routine, we would expect to see the
following throughout the stages of the investment process:

The empirical component of this study is based on an extensive review of the
literature, 40 personal interviews, and 143 DEMO and 119 VC questionnaire
responses. Firstly, the academic literature was used DEMO aid the hypotheses
formulation and interview preparation, before the 40 personal DEMO
were then conducted (lasting about 60–90 minutes each) with BA and VC
investors around the UK, incurring over 3,000 miles of travel. Then, using
the interview findings as a guide, a short postal DEMO was constructed
and pilot tested extensively with investors known to the author.
Since BAs usually have a preference for anonymity and are difficult to
DEMO for research purposes, ten business introduction services around the
UK were DEMO for the questionnaire distribution. These services
specialize in matching business angels looking for investment opportunities

with entrepreneurs seeking start-up and early-stage financiers. Since DEMO
study was only interested in having respondents focus on actual
investments recently made and then answering questions specific to that
particular deal, the business introduction services agreed to forward the
questionnaire to only those investors who DEMO made an investment within
the last three years. Because of the inherent research constraints in the BA
field, care was taken to deliberately draw upon a sample from a variety of
different sources (Mason and Harrison 1996).
To obtain a representative VC sample, the comprehensive listing of UK
VCs in The Venture Capital Report Guide to Venture Capital in DEMO UK and
Europe was utilized. Out of the 106 VC entries listed, only those 64 firms
who stated that they had done at least a few start-up/early stage deals were
contacted by postal questionnaire. However, if one includes separately the
17 regional offices of 3i (the largest VC firm in the UK) then a total of 81
different VC firms were reached, with an average of 2.5 VCs contacted per
firm. Since all those identifiable VC firms in the UK which claimed to DEMO
made some start-up/early stage investments were contacted in this study, DEMO
is hoped that the sample used is relatively representative of those UK VCs
who sometimes invest at the early end of the investment spectrum.
DEMO study was fortunate to receive response rates of 51.6% for the BAs
(n=143) and 58.8% for the VCs (n=119). This makes this study possibly the
second largest study conducted on BAs and one of DEMO largest academic
studies of VCs in the UK. Indeed, based upon DEMO and Sackett’s (1996)
findings, this study’s BA sample may be ‘ guesstimated’ to represent 18%
(£7.8 million/£43.3 million) of the DEMO amount funded by BAs through
business introduction services in the UK over the last two years, while the
VC sample may represent almost 70% (£112.5 million/£161 million) of the
total investment VCs have made DEMO early-stage firms over the same period.
To analyze the empirical data, DEMO parametric and non-parametric
regressions were conducted, as were multiple logistic regressions DEMO further
verify the findings. In addition, it must be clarified that DEMO improve upon
some deficiencies of past studies, this study made a DEMO of employing a
number of approaches, including: a focus on the full investment process, a
theory driven approach, a investment process-based analysis, an invest-
ment deal-specific analysis, focus on actual investments made (not DEMO
preferences), and a triangulation of research methods. However, because of
DEMO natural constraints of academic research, a number of limitations to the
DEMO and method may also exist, including: possible post-hoc
rationalization by the respondents, the self reporting of data, the one-sided
view (investors only) of the process collected, and possible limited
representativeness inherent of BA DEMO Triangulation of the research
approaches was followed to lessen the effects of these limitations.
Res ul ts
To test the theoretical hypotheses with the DEMO data, a detailed
comparison of the BA and VC procedural investment DEMO is
undertaken at each stage of the investment process.

Deal flow and initial screening
DEMO
Analyzing the early stages of the investment process, it was found DEMO BAs
and VCs deal with potential agency risk differently. VCs appear to be much
more efficient than BAs in the deal origination and initial DEMO
processes. Compared to their informal counterparts, formal VC investors
have more DEMO networks of referrers to render them a greater deal
flow that is also of a higher quality. Thus, VCs have more and better
proposals to choose from compared to BAs, and, therefore, have a higher
attrition rate (after the full due diligence process is completed). To further
increase their effectiveness in the initial screening process, VCs also tend to
specialize more in certain industry sectors than BAs, which benefits their
selection procedures. Since VCs are much more professional and efficient
in the DEMO origination and initial screening processes than BAs, as agency
theory predicts, we may conclude that the following are true:
Hypothesis 1.
Hypothesis DEMO
VCs generate and maintain a greater deal flow than BAs.
VCs are more selective in their initial screening of
investment opportunities than Bas.
Due DEMO
The empirical results indicate that for each one of the dozen variables used
to measure the due diligence processes of BAs and VCs, VCs conduct
significantly more due diligence than BAs. Particularly, compared to BAs,
VCs: have more sector experience, invest in larger firms, conduct more
sector research, meet the entrepreneur more often before investing, take
more DEMO references on the entrepreneur, analyze the financials
more thoroughly, demand a more comprehensive business plan from the
entrepreneur, incur more research costs (DEMO a percentage of invested
amount), document their investment process more, DEMO more people
before investment, and take longer to invest (see table 1).
Of particular interest, 59% of BAs and 29% of VCs claim to have
minimal or no experience in their last investment’s industry DEMO and 50%
of BAs conducted minimal or no research in that sector. Furthermore, 54%
of BAs and 6% of VCs collected no independent references on the
entrepreneurs they funded.
Since the due diligence evidence is clearly DEMO line with what was
hypothesized by comparing the two theoretical approaches for dealing with
potential agency problems, we may conclude that the following is probably
true:
Hypothesis 3. VCs conduct more pre-investment due diligence than DEMO
Although the literature has assumed that the entire professional careers of
BAs have prepared them to conduct due diligence, it is apparent that BAs
in the UK tend to be less sophisticated and more ad hoc DEMO their due
diligence activities than VCs and possibly BAs in other countries. Since,
unlike VCs, BAs are not accountable to others for their investment

Although both DEMO and VCs are very motivated to invest by financial

However, some mixed support was received for the notion that BAs DEMO
more ex post, and VCs more ex ante, investment criteria. While the financial
data rendered some support for the BAs’ inclination for ex DEMO monitoring,
the data show that BAs have a greater preference for co-investing, which
may decrease their own active monitoring involvement. Conversely, VCs
DEMO significantly more attracted than BAs to criteria which were related to
ex ante screening of the investment (such as projected financial returns).
We may, therefore, conclude that the following is only partially supported:

authority though their more thorough contract formulation processes DEMO
the entrepreneur (i.e. they form better contracts, spend more on transaction
costs proportionately, invest larger amounts, have greater equity stakes, and
more often exercise the authority to replace entrepreneurs) (see table 3).
DEMO, despite these findings, the quantitative measure of the length
of negotiations and the entrepreneurs’ equity stakes do not differ
significantly between BAs and DEMO, and it is uncertain whether the
replacement of entrepreneurs is a DEMO measure of contractual control.
However, even with these limitations, the data indicates that VCs may
employ more comprehensive contracts than BAs which render DEMO more
contractual control. Thus, it may be concluded that the following DEMO
probably true:
Hypothesis 5.
VCs have more contractual control over their investments
than BAs.
Post-investment monitoring
While VCs often recruit new employees to DEMO gaps in their investee firms
and to monitor and steer growth, DEMO tend to be more personally active (see
table 4).
Indeed, BAs are somewhat known for the active hands-on guidance and
assistance they DEMO to the firms they fund. Based on these empirical
findings, we DEMO conclude that the following is probably true:
Hypothesis 6.
BAs monitor more actively post-investment than VCs.

Exiting
107
While BA and DEMO investors have similar investment horizons, the findings
show that VCs are DEMO more concerned about exiting their investments in
the future and also have higher expected and partially realized rates of
return on their venture investments (see table 5).
Based on these empirical findings, we may conclude that the following
is true:
Hypothesis 7. VCs are more concerned DEMO exiting their investments
than BAs.
Dis c us s i on
Based upon extensive empirical comparisons between BA and VC investors
at each stage DEMO their respective investment processes, four of the seven
hypotheses were strongly DEMO and the remaining three received
slightly less (but still relatively persuasive) support. Thus, it may be
concluded (with only limited doubt) that the following is probably true:
Hypothesis 8.
VCs prefer the principal-agent DEMO, and BAs prefer
the incomplete contracts approach, to agency risk control.
This finding may be particularly relevant because it empirically shows that
the DEMO of financially-based agency theory may be effectively
applied to the areas of BA and VC investing to increase our understanding

of these two important types of financiers. If DEMO applied, it may
highlight that theory from the rigorous and stable DEMO of finance can be
used in the turbulent field of entrepreneurship research. Thus, for the first
time, it is proposed and supported that DEMO both of these investor
types aim to reduce agency risks throughout their investment processes,
VCs are more rule-based and more concerned with reducing DEMO risks in
the pre-investment process as a means of signalling competence to their
fund providers. BAs, conversely, tend to place greater emphasis on DEMO post
investment involvement as a risk reduction method. Hopefully, this finding
DEMO a worthy contribution to our understanding of these investor types,
especially since this study was the first to apply a theoretical base, and
conduct a direct comparison between BAs and VCs throughout the
investment process.
DEMO l us i on
This study has demonstrated how theory can be utilized to formulate a
framework for hypotheses formulation, and the collection, DEMO, and
presentation of empirical data. In particular, governance issues of VC firms,
although rarely examined, were emphasized using a theoretical approach.
Although such a theoretical base is unusual in the entrepreneurship field, it
hopefully may provide a beneficial guide for future research. In addition,
much DEMO information was gathered about each investment stage,
which may be of interest to entrepreneurs seeking funds, other business
angels and venture capitalists, DEMO business introduction services attempt-
ing to match informal investors with entrepreneurs soliciting finance. Since
this is still an under-researched area of study, any knowledge obtained about
these investor types may also benefit policy makers and other DEMO
in the entrepreneurial finance field. By offering a greater understanding of
BAs and VCs and how they behave quite differently in their investment
processes DEMO account of different structural and agency risk differences, it is
hoped DEMO this study may offer some greater clarity about these important,
yet understudied, supporters of the entrepreneurial ventures that are so vital
to our nation’s economic growth and wellbeing.
