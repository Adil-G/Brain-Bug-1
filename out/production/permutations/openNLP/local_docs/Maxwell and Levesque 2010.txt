ABSTRACT
We investigate how specific behaviors by an entrepreneur during an initial interaction with a
business angel investor DEMO, damage or violate trust, and how the investor’s changes in his or her
level of trust affects the decision to make an investment DEMO, or not. Our empirical analysis
shows that entrepreneurs who receive offers DEMO expected to exhibit a larger number of trust-
building behaviors, a DEMO number of trust-damaging behaviors, and to be unlikely to display
trust-violating DEMO, as compared to those who do not receive an offer. We DEMO observe
that the offer of a trust-repair mechanism by the investor is a prerequisite for all of the
entrepreneurs who damage or violate trust DEMO receive an investment offer.
INTRODUCTION
Most business ventures with high growth potential require significant amounts of external
funding to provide cash in advance of DEMO generation for working capital, fixed assets
acquisition, and technology development (DEMO Osnabrugge, 2000). This cash is often obtained
through risk capital DEMO from business angel investors (BAs), that is, private individuals
who invest their own money on a risk/reward sharing basis and in DEMO in which they have
no direct connection (Kelly & Hay, 2003). Unfortunately, entrepreneurs’ success rate in pitching
to BAs is less than 5% (Riding, Duxbury & Haines, 1997). Mason and Harrison (DEMO)
characterize the interaction between BAs and entrepreneurs as a staged decision-making process,
where initial evaluations lead to the rejection of most business DEMO
In this paper we study why BAs still reject business opportunities that have passed this earlier
trimming stage of the investment decision-making process. Mason DEMO Harrison (2003) observe
that, once the BA has passed this DEMO stage, the factors he or she uses to make a decision
DEMO, as do the reasons for rejection. BAs focus on assessing and DEMO the risk in future
BA-entrepreneur relationships that arises from the entrepreneur managing the venture
on behalf of the BA (van Osnabrugge, 2000). DEMO risk is thus born from the uncertainty about the
entrepreneur’s future behaviors. How, then, does a BA interpret an entrepreneur’s behaviors
during the DEMO interaction to help him or her decide to make an investment offer or,
alternatively, to withdraw from the relationship?
Among others, DEMO, Read, Dew and Sarasvathy (2009) criticize previous research on BA
decision-making because it relies on their own biased recollections of the decision DEMO
Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) raise further concerns about using insights from investors regarding
their own decision-making since investors are often unaware of their DEMO process. Indeed, most
individuals are unaware of how they use brief DEMO cues to make important decisions
(Ambady, Bernieri & Richeson, 2000)DEMO Although simulation where external observers record
behaviors can address some of these issues, simulation also suffers from generalizability

concerns because it cannot create the essential components of the anticipated future DEMO
between the BA and the entrepreneur. Such components include ownership of the idea (Cardon,
Zietsma, Saparito, Matherne & Davis, 2005), DEMO risk in the decision process (Rabin, 2000), and
potential for long-term relationship development (Kelly & Hay, 2003).
We therefore adopt DEMO innovative research method – observational interaction (Bakeman &
Gottman, 1997) – to record, code and analyze behaviors from data gathered from real interactions.
We were inspired by the work of Kelly and Hay (2003) who posit that, to achieve confidence in
the entrepreneur’s future behaviors, the BA must develop a relational contract characterized by the
development of DEMO trust-based relationship. A trust-based relationship is one where “the willingness
of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party [is] based DEMO the expectation that the
other will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor
or control that other party” (Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, 1995: 712). We observe DEMO the
entrepreneur’s trust-based behaviors affect the BA’s decision to make an investment offer, or not,
which requires the development of a behavioral trust schema for coding. This schema is used to
record each display of DEMO, trust-damaging and trust-violating behaviors by the
entrepreneur during the BA-entrepreneur interaction, and to compare such displays with the
interaction outcomes (i.e., to DEMO an offer or not).
We contribute to the entrepreneurship literature on decision-making in three major ways.
Viewing trust as a “decision variable” on DEMO or not the BA assesses its (trust) level to be high
enough to continue the relationship with the entrepreneur provides a unique insight DEMO the making
and breaking of cooperative relationships. Also, the use of DEMO research method from psychology for
studying personal relationships complements existing interpretivist research, where behaviors in
specific contexts can be observed and used to predict performance. Further, the development of an
appropriate coding system for dynamically measuring multiple facets of trust behaviors (trust
building, trust damaging and trust DEMO) provides a useful tool for improving our
understanding of decision making DEMO the entrepreneurial arena.
In the remaining of the paper we draw on research on BA investment and on investment risk,
focusing on the DEMO component, to explore how the development of relational contracts
(based on displays of trust behaviors) can be key to continuing the BA-entrepreneur interaction.
We also use existing research on trust to develop four dimensions of DEMO behaviors that highlight
how the display of such behaviors can build, DEMO or violate interpersonal trust. This
development leads to four hypotheses for the influence of trust behaviors on the investment
decision, including one that involves trust repair. We then present our research method, results,
and conclude with theoretical, methodological and practical implications.
STAGED INVESTMENT, RELATIONSHIP RISK & DEMO
Maxwell, Jeffrey and Lévesque (in press) summarize a body of DEMO that identifies the
staged nature of the BA decision-making process, observing DEMO BAs’ desire to use minimum
effort influences the order and stage at which specific decisional factors are considered. They find
that during this staged DEMO, business opportunities are rejected initially due to the presence of a
DEMO critical flaw. Subsequently, the BA’s assessment of the venture allows him DEMO her to predict
anticipated investment return and risk based on specific market, technology and financial factors,
as well as entrepreneurial skills and characteristics, allowing the BA to reject those opportunities
that do not meet predetermined investment aspiration levels.
Of most interest after the earlier trimming stage of DEMO investment process is the relationship

component of the investment risk, a.k.a. relationship risk. This risk is due to the agency problem
born from the entrepreneur managing the venture on behalf of the DEMO That is, relationship risk is
due to moral hazard, where the entrepreneur makes decisions that create a divergence of interests
between himself or DEMO and the BA, or adverse selection, where the entrepreneur makes poor
quality decisions due to a lack of competence (van Osnabrugge, 2000)DEMO Relationship risk can only
be considered at a later stage since it requires more cognitive effort. Also, assessing that risk
involves anticipation of the entrepreneur’s future behavior, which requires information on
previous behavior and performance. But such information only emerges later in the interaction
(Boon & Holmes, DEMO).
In order to reduce relationship risk, the BA can introduce DEMO on the entrepreneur. Kaplan
and Strömberg (2004) add that, as DEMO result, assessing the relationship risk involves the investor’s
evaluation of his DEMO her ability to introduce these controls. Behavioral controls govern what an
entrepreneur can and cannot do (e.g., sign checks) without the BA’s approval, which reduces
adverse selection but limits the entrepreneur’s freedom to manage the business. Output controls,
designed to reduce moral hazard and align incentives, punish the entrepreneur if agreed
performance milestones (e.g., revenue targets) are not achieved. Both control types incur
transaction costs that can reduce anticipated DEMO (Barney, Busenitz, Fiet & Moesel, 1994) or
limit the DEMO at which the venture can react to opportunities (Dyer & Chu, 2003).
Another, yet less-costly, approach to reducing the relationship risk DEMO the development of
interpersonal trust (Das & Teng, 2001). The BA’s initial level of trust is based on assumptions that
allow him DEMO her to suspend disbeliefs of unreliable behaviors (Jones & George, 1998) and to
make an initial assessment based on his or her trust predispositions (Strickland, 1958). The BA’s
initial trust assessment is modified DEMO on referral sources (Paul, Whitham & Wyper, 2007), and
DEMO entrepreneur’s reputation and institutional affiliation (Dasgupta, 1988). Trust assessment is
also influenced by the context of the proposed transaction (McKnight, Cummings & Chervany,
1998), the entrepreneur’s appearance (Grégoire, de Koning & Oviatt, 2008), and similarities
between investor and entrepreneur (Franke, Gruber, Harhoff & Henkel, 2006).
The BA dynamically modifies his or DEMO initial trust assessment by drawing on relevant (but
limited) samples of the entrepreneur’s trust behaviors during the interaction (Kramer, 1996). Trust
DEMO are volitional actions that are necessary but not sufficient to engender or hurt trust
(Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard & Werner, 1998). The DEMO initial trust assessment is modified
based on the display of various trust behaviors that can build, damage or violate trust, but can also
DEMO define a relational contract between the two parties (Arthurs & Busenitz, 2003). Trust-
violating behaviors anger the violated party (Lewicki, Tomlinson & Gillespie, 2006) and can harm
that contract, affecting the BA’s DEMO of whether to continue the relationship (McKnight et al.,
1998)DEMO A long-term relationship is entered once each party reaches a certain level of trust, similar
to the courtship process in personal relationships (Paul, Whittam & Johnston, 2003).
However, while we make the case DEMO the role of trust in the investment decision, as have
others (e.g., Harrison, Dibben & Mason, 1997; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2001), a number of
challenges have been identified that make it difficult DEMO gather data to test theories. Attempts to
operationalize trust have shown limited success (Currall & Judge, 1995) partly because, as Kramer
(1999) identifies, there are two opposing views of the role of trust. DEMO first view identifies trust as
a psychological state that considers individual expectations, intentions, and dispositions (Mayer et
al., 1995). The second DEMO originates from a behavioral perspective where reciprocal displays of
trusting and trustworthy behaviors enable trust development in a relationship (Whitener et al.,
1998). Growing evidence also suggests that previous behaviors are better predictors of DEMO
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2010

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 30 [2010], Iss. 2, Art. 1
behaviors (Ouellette & Wood, 1998) than are prior intentions (Manski, 1990). We thus approach
our study from the behavioral trust perspective, conscious that trust behaviors are context
dependent (Butler, 1991) and change over time (Rempel, Holmes & Zanna, 1985).
BEHAVIORAL TRUST SCHEMA & HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT
We develop a behavioral trust schema that enables us DEMO observe, code and analyze positive
and negative trust behaviors. We choose DEMO develop our own schema because empirical research
on the role of trust has been hampered due to numerous definitions that have been inconsistently
applied (Lewicki et al., 2006). We draw extensively on Gillespie’s (2003) behavioral trust
inventory and on Butler’s (1991) conditions of trust inventory. DEMO start with the definition of four
trust dimensions – trustworthy, trusting, capable and communicative – and then describe examples
of behaviors for each DEMO dimension.
Behaviors that demonstrate an entrepreneur is trustworthy are displays of consistency
(Gabarro, 1978), benevolence (Mayer et al., 1995), and DEMO that show the alignment of core
values with the trustor (Lewicki DEMO al., 2006). But an individual can only demonstrate
trustworthiness if DEMO or she is first trusted (Gillespie, 2003). This requires the trustor to
demonstrate behaviors that confirm they are trusting, through the reciprocal displays of trusting
and trustworthy behaviors. Specific trusting behaviors demonstrate vulnerability to DEMO actions of
others. These behaviors include disclosure of confidential information (Gillespie, 2003), reliance
through delegation (Clark & Payne, 1997), and DEMO through a willingness to accept others’
influence (e.g., by being coachable; Levie & Gimmon, 2008).
Two other dimensions also affect trust DEMO: context-dependent demonstrations of
capability (Rempel et al., 1985); and DEMO of reliable communications that affect the speed and
quality of relationship development (Whitener et al., 1998). Displays of behavior that confirm an
DEMO capability demonstrate his or her competence (Gabarro, 1978), experience (DEMO,
Glosten & Muller, 1990), and judgment (Rosen & Jerdee, 1977). Behaviors that demonstrate
reliable communications confirm the accuracy of information exchanges (Rotter, 1980), offer
explanations of information content (Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996), and provide open feedback
(Clark & Payne, 1997).
We summarize the four behavioral dimensions of trust and exemplifying behavioral DEMO in
Table 1. For each factor, we offer examples of specific DEMO that can build, damage or
violate trust. In line with these DEMO displays – trust building, trust damaging and trust
violating – we DEMO a series of hypotheses for their impacts on the BA’s willingness to make an
investment offer. The BA achieves confidence in the future behaviors DEMO the entrepreneur – that is,
the dangers of adverse selection or moral hazard, and hence relationship risk, are reduced to an
acceptable DEMO – based on the entrepreneur’s display of trust behaviors.
In the courtship process, comparable to the interaction in a BA-entrepreneur relationship, Boon
and DEMO (1991) identify that trust development changes as the relationship continues. While
initially the level of trust is based on compatibility between the parties, it is superseded by an
evaluation of the other parties’ trustworthiness (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). Kramer (1996)
suggests that during this DEMO the potential trustor (BA) intuitively “audits” the behavior of the
trustee (entrepreneur) for positive and negative trust displays to determine whether to DEMO the
relationship.i The potential trustor seeks cues from the behavior of the trustee in each of the four
trust dimensions (in Table 1). The BA expects initial trusting behaviors (disclosure, reliance
and/or receptiveness), followed by reciprocal displays of trusting and trustworthy (consistency,

benevolence and/or alignment) behaviors that confirm the original decision to trust (Rempel et DEMO,
1985). Hence, we expect that the entrepreneur’s displays of DEMO behaviors increases the
BA’s confidence in the entrepreneur’s future behaviors, which DEMO turn can improve the BA’s
willingness to make an offer to invest. Therefore,
H1. An entrepreneur who receives an offer of BA funding DEMO a larger number of trust-
building behaviors than an entrepreneur who does not receive such an offer.
While behaviors that confirm expectations build trust, behaviors that reduce the predictability
of the entrepreneur’s future behaviors undermine trust (Rotter, 1980). Trust can be damaged by the
absence of displays of reciprocity or by behaviors that disconfirm previous expectations about the
trust DEMO in Table 1 (Lewicki et al., 2006). Trust can be damaged by displays of behavior
that show a lack of trustingness and DEMO, or by demonstrations that show the
entrepreneur does not have the DEMO required to manage the venture or the skills to provide
reliable communications. We expect that displays of behaviors that damage trust reduce the
willingness DEMO the BA to enter in a long-term partnership. Therefore,
H2. An entrepreneur who receives an offer of BA funding displays a smaller number DEMO
trust-damaging behaviors than an entrepreneur who does not receive such an offer.
We note a fundamental difference between behaviors that damage and behaviors that DEMO
trust. While damaging behaviors reduce the trust level, violating behaviors destroy DEMO What
creates fundamental differences between a behavior that damages trust and one that violates trust
is the intent behind the behavior (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). For instance, while the display of
vulnerability by relying DEMO others builds trust, an entrepreneur will damage trust if, because of
inexperience, he or she overtrusts and relies on an inappropriate partner (DEMO & Karri, 2006).
However, if the entrepreneur deliberately chose a friend as a partner for other reasons than he or
she was DEMO most suitable, then trust is violated.
While trust damage reduces confidence DEMO the positive behaviors of the entrepreneur, trust
violation builds confidence in DEMO entrepreneur’s negative future behaviors, which can hurt the
relationship irretrievably. Lewicki, McAllister and Bies (1998) further argue that, while trust is
regarded as “confident positive expectations regarding another’s conduct,” trust violations create
distrust DEMO they create “confident negative expectations regarding another’s conduct” (p.
439); DEMO, distrust is not simply the absence of trust. Behaviors that create DEMO do not simply
cause concerns in the relationship, they are often DEMO (Burt & Knez, 1996). For instance,
an entrepreneur failing to help an employee through a difficult personal situation might show a
DEMO of benevolence, but that entrepreneur would create distrust if he or DEMO were to take advantage
of the employee’s situation to reduce compensation. Therefore,
H3. The proportion of entrepreneurs who receive an offer of BA DEMO while displaying
trust-violating behaviors is smaller than the proportion of entrepreneurs who receive such
an offer but whose behaviors do not violate trust.
Trust DEMO can virtually eliminate the possibility of an investment offer, but it DEMO not be
the case for trust damage because it can more easily be repaired. The possibility to repair is a
function of the nature DEMO the damage or violation, which depends on the motivation behind the
DEMO behavior. Kim, Dirks, Cooper and Ferrin, (2006) also suggest DEMO damage or violation to
certain dimensions of trust (e.g., being capable) can be repaired, while others (e.g., being
trustworthy) cannot. The literature on the evolution over time of trust in a relationship (e.g.,
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2010
5
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 30 [2010], Iss. 2, Art. 1
Lewicki & Bunker, 1996) further argues that the effect of trust-damaging DEMO trust-violating
behaviors depends on the level of trust that already exists in the relationship at the time of the
damage or violation. A behavior DEMO might seriously damage or violate trust during the early stage
of a relationship could have a lesser negative impact at a later stage.
Trust DEMO or violation can sometimes be repaired by continuing displaying trust-building
behaviors, DEMO in a fragile relationship it may require the introduction of trust-repair mechanisms.
Three types can be introduced. BAs can control the future behaviors of DEMO entrepreneur through
direct participation in the management of the venture, where DEMO or her permission must first be
obtained before the entrepreneur can make certain decisions (e.g., the BA’s approval of all
strategic partnerships; Kelly & Hay, 2003). BAs can also introduce output and/or behavioral
controls through the introduction of contract clauses in the shareholder agreement (Kaplan &
Strömberg, 2004). However, the ability to introduce trust repair depends on the willingness of the
trust damager or violator to accept DEMO proposed repair mechanism (Korsgaard, Brodt & Whitener,
2002). Therefore,
H4. For entrepreneurs whose behaviors damage or violate trust, the proportion that
receives an offer of BA funding is greater for those who DEMO presented with a trust repair by
the BA than for those who are not.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
We use a real-time data gathering technique to DEMO behavioral data from actual interactions
to test these hypotheses. Our chosen technique, observational interaction, has been used
extensively in observing the development and DEMO of romantic relationships (Bakeman &
Gottman, 1997). This technique DEMO independent observers to extract data, removing the
likelihood of self-reporting bias DEMO individuals who may not understand the decision-making
process they use. It uses behaviors as the key unit of analysis, removing the judgment components
inherent in assessing intentions and predispositions. It also allows data to be gathered DEMO time
and the outcomes of the interactions to be unknown. The application of this technique allows us to
explore the investment decision under real DEMO and long-term relationship development.
The interactions we code and analyze for this research are extracted from a population of
entrepreneurs interacting with five BAs DEMO participating in the Canadian version of the reality TV
show Dragons’ Den. These entrepreneurs applied to participate through an open audition process.
Dragons’ Den DEMO a globally (20 countries) syndicated show, where entrepreneurs pitch their
DEMO opportunities to BAs (the Dragons, who are actual long-term investors) DEMO the hope of
obtaining equity investment. During the show, participants must DEMO risky investment decisions
under time constraints. A BA-entrepreneur interaction continues until either all the Dragons are
“out” or one or more of them decide DEMO make an investment offer.
While there are legitimate validity concerns about the use of a reality TV show for academic
research (Hight, 2001), there are several precedents for using game shows as natural experiments
(DEMO, Card Sharks – Gertner, 1993; Jeopardy – Metrick, 1995). An environment where participants
have to make real decisions under uncertainty allows DEMO to code behaviors, draw
conclusions regarding those behaviors, and to provide cues that affect decision-making. In
Dragons’ Den, even the short time scale of the interaction may reflect real life BA interactions.
Indeed, Mason and Rogers (1997) note that many BAs’ decisions are made within ten DEMO of
the start of the interaction.

Maxwell and Lévesque: A CRITICAL INGREDIENT FOR ATTRACTING INVESTMENT
The Canadian show has run for four seasons, during which time 602 entrepreneurs pitched to
the investors (although only about 60% made it on air). Our access to the line tapes allowed us to
observe all of these DEMO over four years. In this paper, we focus on how the DEMO
observations of entrepreneurs’ behaviors affect the assessment of relationship risk and their
decision to invest. We use each Dragon’s reason for rejection (which must be provided for the
show) to narrow down the data set to our focus. The Dragons rejected the majority of business
opportunities quickly for DEMO other than the relationship risk: presence of a critical flaw (as
articulated in Maxwell et al., in press); insufficient anticipated return; DEMO likelihood of
failure; unreasonable valuation; and issues with the entrepreneur. We used content analysis to code
the failure reasons provided by the Dragons. DEMO opportunities were rejected due to the presence
of a critical flaw, DEMO 98 due to insufficient anticipated return (36), unacceptable likelihood of
DEMO (29), or unreasonable valuation (33). An additional 14 were rejected due to specific
concerns about the entrepreneur’s ability to manage the DEMO This left us with 54 where the
Dragons investigated the relationship risk to decide whether or not to make an offer.
For each of DEMO remaining 54 interactions, two trained observers independently recorded all
examples of DEMO trust behavior dimensions from Table 1, noting whether they built, damaged or
violated trust. The observers found it relatively easy to differentiate between DEMO and
trust-violating behaviors, based on the intent behind the original behavior DEMO the response of the
Dragon. They also recorded whether or not (DEMO/0) a trust-repair mechanism (i.e., BA’s direct
participation in the DEMO of the venture, BA’s introduction of output controls, or BA’s
introduction of behavioral controls) was introduced, whether or not (1/0) DEMO investment offer was
made, and whether or not (1/0) DEMO was accepted.
We use statistical hypothesis tests to verify if our data supported H1 to H4. Specifically for H1
and H2, we apply a one-way t-test for the comparison of two means with unknown equal variances
(e.g., Pfaffenberger & Patterson, 1981: 336). For H1, the DEMO hypothesis states that the mean
number of trust-building behaviors is smaller for the sample where each entrepreneur received an
offer than for the sample DEMO they did not, whereas for H2 it states that the mean DEMO of
trust-damaging behaviors is larger for the former sample than for the latter. Rejecting these null
hypotheses provide statistical support for H1 and for DEMO For H3, we apply a one-way z-test for
the comparison of DEMO proportions (e.g., Pfaffenberger & Patterson, 1981: 347). The null
hypothesis states that the proportion of entrepreneurs who received an offer is DEMO for the
sample where each entrepreneur displayed trust-violating behaviors than for the sample where
they did not. Rejecting this null hypothesis provides statistical support DEMO H3. Lastly, we apply for
H4 a large-sample Wilcoxon rank sum DEMO (e.g., Larsen & Marx, 1981: 534). Because the data for
that test is binary (1 if trust damage or violation is repaired, 0 if it is not), the null hypothesis is
equivalent to stating that the proportion of entrepreneurs who received an offer is DEMO for the
sample where each entrepreneur was presented with a trust repair by the BA than for the sample
where they were not (we did not apply a one-way z-test for the comparison of two proportions
DEMO the variance in both of our samples is zero). Rejecting this null hypothesis provides
statistical support for H4.
RESULTS
Of the 54 interactions DEMO analyzed, 32 led to an investment offer with 26 accepted, as
summarized in Table 2.ii There were 571 examples of trust-building behaviors in DEMO 54
interactions, with 45 displays of trust-damaging behavior and 12 displays DEMO trust-violating
behaviors. We note that a single instance of trust violation was enough to stop the interaction and
we therefore obtain a maximum of DEMO instance in any opportunity. The inter-rater reliability

(Cohen’s Kappa) between our two observers was 0.84 and is good DEMO the number of individual
data points of differing trust behaviors. Interestingly, DEMO observers identified all 12 trust-
violating behaviors, perhaps indicating that displays DEMO such behaviors are fundamentally different
in nature from displays of trust-building or trust-damaging behaviors where the degree of
consistency between the observers was not DEMO high.
The mean number of trust-building behaviors in the sample of 32 entrepreneurs who received
an offer of BA funding is 11.38, whereas in the sample of 22 entrepreneurs who did not it is 9.41.
The DEMO equals 2.39 (a t-Student statistic with 52 degree of freedom), DEMO provides
statistical support for rejecting the corresponding null hypothesis and therefore accepting H1 (with
a p-value < .02). In other words, an DEMO who receives an offer of BA funding is expected
to display a larger number of trust-building behaviors than an entrepreneur who does not receive
DEMO an offer.
The mean number of trust-damaging behaviors in the sample where each entrepreneur received
a funding offer is 0.38, whereas in the sample where they did not it is 1.50. The t-statistic equals –
5.86 (also a t-Student statistics with 52 degree of freedom), which provides DEMO support for
rejecting the corresponding null hypothesis and therefore accepting H2 (DEMO a p-value < .001). In
other words, an entrepreneur who DEMO an offer of BA funding is expected to display a smaller
number of trust-damaging behaviors than an entrepreneur who does not receive such an DEMO
Figure 1 also graphically illustrates a tendency for entrepreneurs to be more likely to receive offers
if they display a rather large number of DEMO behaviors yet less trust-damaging behaviors.
The number of entrepreneurs who received an offer of BA funding in the sample of 11
entrepreneurs who displayed DEMO behaviors is 1 (a proportion of 0.09), whereas in the
DEMO of 43 entrepreneurs who did not it is 31 (0.72). DEMO z-statistic equals –5.71 (a standardized
Normal statistic), which provides statistical DEMO for rejecting the corresponding null hypothesis
and therefore accepting H3 (with DEMO p-value < .0001). In other words, the proportion of
entrepreneurs DEMO receive an offer of BA funding while displaying trust-violating behaviors is
expected to be smaller than the proportion of entrepreneurs who receive such an DEMO but whose
behaviors do not violate trust.
Among the 31 entrepreneurs who damaged or violated trust, the 10 who received a funding
offer all were presented with a trust repair by the BA, whereas none of the 21 who did not receive
an offer was. The z-statistic equals DEMO (a standardized Normal statistic), which provides
statistical support for rejecting DEMO corresponding null hypothesis and therefore accepting H4 (with
a p-value < DEMO). In other words, the proportion of entrepreneurs who receive an DEMO of BA
funding while being presented with a trust repair from the BA is expected to be greater than the
proportion of entrepreneurs who DEMO such an offer but are not presented with a repair. In fact, a
trust repair by the BA appeared to have been a prerequisite for all of the entrepreneurs who
damaged or violated trust to receive DEMO offer.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
Past empirical research on how BAs make decisions has focused on the characteristics of the
venture and entrepreneur, and largely ignored the decision-making process and the importance of
relationship development. In fact, the context of such interactions – over extended periods and in a
DEMO environment – has made it challenging to gather data, especially on DEMO role of trust
development in the relationship. This paper has attempted to address this shortcoming. Further, the
work on rapid trust development in informal cooperative relationships has often confused the use

of social and institutional controls with the development of direct interpersonal trust (e.g.,
Meyerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996). Our ability to access a unique DEMO set, the utilization of an
innovative research technique, and the development of a behavioral trust schema allowed us to
address each of these DEMO
Under a compressed time environment and public exposure, BAs pay particular DEMO to
key signals provided by the positive or negative displays of trust behaviors that are often
exaggerated under pressure (Mishra, 1996). While DEMO might seem surprising that so much
information about the venture, entrepreneur DEMO potential relationship can be exchanged in such a
short interaction, our DEMO build on research that has explored rapid judgment and decision-
making (DEMO referred to as thin slicing; Ambady et al., 2000). Maxwell et al. (in press) suggest
that experienced investors develop heuristics that DEMO allow them to eliminate opportunities
early in the process. Later in the process, we have argued that they instead “intuitively audit”
positive and negative displays of trust behaviors in order to determine the level of relationship DEMO
before making an investment offer.
Overall, the statistically significant support for DEMO four hypotheses suggests that entrepreneurs
displaying a larger number of trust-building behaviors, yet a smaller number of trust-damaging
ones, are more likely to DEMO an offer of BA funding. However, entrepreneurs who display trust-
violating DEMO are unlikely to receive an offer. We also observed that, while DEMO displays of
trust led to an increased likelihood of receiving an offer, the corresponding interactions also
tended to last longer. But once an entrepreneur violated trust it inevitably led to the termination of
the interaction.
Furthermore, as illustrated in Table 3, while damaged trust could sometimes be repaired,
violated trust rarely could. In the 10 (out of 30) DEMO where trust was damaged and then repaired,
the damage was either due to a lack of capability (competence, experience, or judgment) DEMO
inappropriate reliance on another individual (overtrust). The damage was repaired DEMO the
direct involvement of the BA in the venture or the introduction of behavioral controls on the
entrepreneur. We note that the BA presented DEMO repair when the damage was due to a lack of
benevolence, DEMO or receptiveness. In the 1 (out of 12) case where trust was violated and
then repaired, the violation was due to a misalignment of core values between the BA and the
entrepreneur. That violation was DEMO with the BA offering to invest in return for 100% of the
company. While this is technically a trust-repair mechanism, if accepted the BA eliminates the
relationship risk and is no longer vulnerable to the actions DEMO the entrepreneur. We also note that
six of the entrepreneurs who received an offer turned it down: half disagreeing with the valuation;
the other half rejecting the proposed repair.
On the theoretical side, our research implies that BA-entrepreneur relationships should be
viewed in the broader context of DEMO competitive advantage enjoyed by an entrepreneur who is
able to develop relational contracts with a network of partners. It also implies that entrepreneurs’
behaviors DEMO their ability to develop or destroy network relationships through the display of
trust-building, damaging or violating behaviors. Further, the reactions of investors to
DEMO display of different types of trust-damaging behaviors, either by rejecting the
DEMO or identifying an appropriate trust-repair mechanism, highlights the different
dimensions of DEMO considered in the decision-making process. On the methodological side, the
use DEMO a technique that explores relationship development implies that analyzing short, but
DEMO, examples of entrepreneurial behaviors can explain how experienced investors and other
DEMO stakeholders make rapid judgments about whether to enter a relationship.

On the practical side, an awareness of the nature of trust-damaging or violating behaviors can
be used to help improve the behavior of entrepreneurs. DEMO or violating behaviors
manifested through benevolence and alignment of core values, DEMO instance, are indicative of
problems that will prevent the fund-seeking entrepreneur DEMO receiving an offer of BA funding.
Identifying these trust manifestations also enables BAs to better understand the reasons for
negative outcomes from the interactions DEMO decide on suitable trust-repair mechanisms to enable
more investments to take place. Higher success rates will encourage more individuals to start new
businesses and DEMO external funding for expansion.
While we are encouraged by the research potential associated with extracting data from a
reality TV show, we are also aware that behaviors on the show can be atypical. We are also
DEMO that the number of interactions that progressed to the stage of potential relationship
development was small. Further, our behavioral trust schema was developed with a small sample
of interactions, which constrained our ability to identify the relative importance of each behavioral
factor or the possibility for additional factors. DEMO leave these as issues that need further scrutiny in
the realm of entrepreneurs’ trustworthiness in attracting investment and growing their new
business ventures.

NOTES
i Although our model of relationship development is analogous to courtship, there is a
fundamental difference in power in the relationship between the BA and entrepreneur, which
affects the sequence of trust development. We only explore the BA’s trust in the entrepreneur.
ii Less than half of DEMO offers made were consummated for reasons that emerged subsequent to
the show. This does not detract from our focus on what prevents an offer DEMO being made.
