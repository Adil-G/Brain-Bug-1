A Model of Heuristic DEMO
Daniel Kahneman
Shane Frederick
The program of research now known as the
heuristics and biases approach began with a
study of the statistical intuitions DEMO experts,
who were found to be excessively conﬁ-
dent in the replicability of results from small
samples (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971 ). The
persistence of such systematic errors in the
intuitions of experts implied DEMO their intu-
itive judgments may be governed by funda-
mentally different processes than the slower,
more deliberate computations they had been
trained to DEMO
From its earliest days, the heuristics and
biases program was guided DEMO the idea that
intuitive judgments occupy a position – per-
haps corresponding to evolutionary history –
between the automatic parallel operations
of perception and DEMO controlled serial op-
erations of reasoning. Intuitive judgments
were viewed as an extension of percep-
tion to judgment objects that are not cur-
rently DEMO, including mental represen-
tations that are evoked by language. The
mental DEMO on which intuitive
judgments operate are similar to percepts.
Indeed, the DEMO between perception
and judgment is often blurry: The perception
of a DEMO as menacing entails a prediction
of future harm.
The ancient idea that cognitive processes
can be partitioned into two main families –
traditionally called DEMO and reason –
is now widely embraced under the general
label of dual-process theories (Chaiken &
Trope, 1 999;Evans and Over, DEMO 996; Ham-
mond, 1 996; Sloman, 1 996, 2 DEMO ; see Evans,
Chap. 8). Dual-process models come in
many ﬂavors, but all distinguish cognitive
operations that are quick and associative
from others that are slow and governed by
rules (Gilbert, 1 999)DEMO
To represent intuitive and deliberate rea-
soning, we borrow the terms DEMO 1 ” and
“system 2 ” from Stanovich and West (2 DEMO ).
Although suggesting two autonomous ho-
munculi, such a meaning is not intended.
We use the term “system” only as a label for
DEMO of cognitive processes that can
be distinguished by their speed, their DEMO
trollability, and the contents on which they
operate. In the particular DEMO model
we assume, system 1 quickly proposes intu-
itive answers to DEMO problems as they
arise, and system 2 monitors the quality of

these proposals, which it may endorse, cor-
rect, or DEMO The judgments that are
eventually expressed are called intuitive if
they retain the hypothesized initial proposal
with little modiﬁcation.
The effect of concurrent cognitive DEMO
provides the most useful indication of
whether a given mental process belongs to
system 1 or system 2 . Because the over-
all capacity DEMO mental effort is limited, ef-
fortful processes tend to disrupt each DEMO,
whereas effortless processes neither cause
nor suffer much interference when com-
bined with other tasks (Kahneman, 1973 ;
Pashler, 1 998 ). It is by this criterion that we
assign the monitoring function DEMO system 2 :
People who are occupied by a demanding
mental DEMO (e.g., attempting to hold in
mind several digits) are much DEMO likely
to respond to another task by blurting out
whatever comes to mind (Gilbert, 1989). By
the same criterion, the acquisition of highly
skilled performances – whether perceptual
or motor – involves the transformation DEMO an
activity from effortful (system 2 )to effort-
less (system DEMO ). The proverbial chess master
who strolls past a game and DEMO, “White
mates in three” is performing intuitively
(Simon & Chase, DEMO ).
Our views about the two systems are
similar to the DEMO model” proposed
by Gilbert (1989, 1 991 ) and to other dual-
process models (Epstein, 1 994 ; Hammond,
1 996; Sloman, 1 996; see also Shweder,
1977 ). We assume system 1 and system 2
can be active concurrently, that automatic
and controlled cognitive operations compete
for the control of overt responses, and that
deliberate judgments are likely to remain
anchored on initial impressions. We also
DEMO that the contribution of the two
systems in determining stated judgments
depends on both task features and individ-
ual characteristics, including the time avail-
able for deliberation (Finucane et al., 2 000),
mood (DEMO et al., 1 996; Isen, Nygren, &
Ashby, 1988 ), intelligence (Stanovich &
West, 2 002 ), cognitive impulsiveness (Fred-
erick, 2 004 ), and exposure to statistical
thinking (DEMO, 1 991 ; Agnoli & Krantz,
1989; Nisbett et al., 1983 ).
In the context of a dual-system view,
errors DEMO intuitive judgment raise two
questions: “What features of system 1 cre-
DEMO the error?” and “Why was the error not
detected and corrected by system 2 ?” (cf.
Kahneman & Tversky, 1982 ). DEMO ﬁrst ques-
tion is more basic, of course, but the second
is also relevant and ought not be overlooked.
Consider, for example, DEMO paragraph that
Tversky and Kahneman (1974 ;p. 3 in
Kahneman, DEMO, & Tversky, 1982 ) used to
introduced the notions of heuristic and bias:
The subjective assessment of probability re-
sembles the subjective DEMO of physi-
cal quantities such as distance or size. These
judgments are all based on data of lim-
ited validity, which are processed accord-
ing to heuristic rules. For example, the ap-
parent distance of an object is determined
in part by its clarity. The more sharply
the DEMO is seen, the closer it appears to
be. This rule has DEMO validity, because in
any given scene the more distant objects
are DEMO less sharply than nearer objects.
However, the reliance on this rule DEMO to
systematic errors in the estimation of dis-
tance. Speciﬁcally, distances DEMO often over-
estimated when visibility is poor because
the contours of objects are blurred. On the
other hand, distances are often underesti-
mated when visibility is good because the
objects are seen sharply. Thus the reliance
DEMO clarity as an indication leads to com-
mon biases. Such biases are also found in
intuitive judgments of probability.
This statement was intended to DEMO
Brunswik’s (1943 ) analysis of the percep-
tion of distance to DEMO domain of intuitive
thinking and to provide a rationale for us-
ing biases to diagnose heuristics. However,
the analysis of the effect of DEMO is ﬂawed:
It neglects the fact that an observer looking
at a distant mountain possesses two relevant
cues, not one. The ﬁrst cue is the blur of the
contours of the target mountain, which is
positively correlated with its distance, when
all else is equal. This cue should be given
positive weight in a judgment of distance,
and DEMO is. The second relevant cue, which
the observer can readily assess DEMO looking
around, is the ambient or general haziness.

a model of heuristic judgment
269
DEMO an optimal regression model for estimat-
ing distance, general haziness is DEMO suppressor
variable, which must be weighted negatively
because it contributes to DEMO but is uncor-
related with distance. Contrary to the argu-
ment made in 1974 , using blur as a cue does
not inevitably lead DEMO bias in the judgment
of distance – the illusion could just as well
be described as a failure to assign adequate
negative weight to DEMO haze. The effect
of haziness on impressions of distance is a
failing of system 1 : The perceptual system is
not designed to correct DEMO this variable. The
effect of haziness on judgments of distance
is a separate failure of system 2 . Although
people are capable of consciously DEMO
their impressions of distance for the effects
of ambient haze, they DEMO fail to do
so. A similar analysis applies to some of the
judgmental biases we discuss later, in which
errors and biases only occur when both sys-
tems fail.
In the following section, we present
an attribute-substitution model of heuris-
tic judgment, which assumes that difﬁcult
questions are often answered by substi-
tuting an answer to an easier one. This
DEMO and extends earlier treatments
of the topic (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982 ;
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974 , 1983 ). Fol-
lowing sections introduce a research design
for studying attribute substitution, as well
as discuss the controversy over the repre-
sentativeness heuristic in the context of a
DEMO view that we endorse. The ﬁnal
section situates representativeness within
a broad family of prototype heuristics, in
which properties of a prototypical exemplar
dominate global judgments concerning an
entire set.
Attribute Substitution
The early research on DEMO heuris-
tics was guided by a simple and general
hypothesis: When DEMO with a difﬁ-
cult question, people may answer an eas-
ier DEMO instead and are often unaware of
the substitution. A person who is asked
“What proportion of long-distance relation-
ships break up within a year?DEMO may answer
as if she had been asked “Do instances of
failed long-distance relationships come read-
ily to mind?” This would be an DEMO
tion of the availability heuristic. A profes-
sor who has heard a candidate’s job talk and
now considers the question “How likely is it
DEMO this candidate could be tenured in our
department?” may answer the much easier
question: “How impressive was the talk?”.
This would be an example of one form of
the representativeness heuristic.
The heuristics and DEMO research pro-
gram has focused primarily on representa-
tiveness and availability – two versatile at-
tributes that are automatically computed
and can serve as DEMO answers to many
different questions. It has also focused prin-
cipally on thinking under uncertainty. How-
ever, the restriction to particular heuristics
and to a speciﬁc context is largely arbitrary.
Kahneman and Frederick (2 002 ) argued that
this process of attribute substitution is a
general feature of DEMO judgment; that
whenever the aspect of the judgmental ob-
ject that DEMO intends to judge (the target at-
tribute)is less readily assessed DEMO a related
property that yields a plausible answer (the
heuristic attribute), individuals may unwit-
tingly substitute the simpler assessment. For
an example, DEMO the well-known study
by Strack, Martin, and Schwarz (1988)in
DEMO college students answered a survey
that included these two questions: “How
DEMO are you with your life in general?” and
“How many dates did you have last month?”
The correlation between the two questions
DEMO negligible when they occurred in the
order shown, but rose to DEMO if the dating
question was asked ﬁrst. We suggest that the
question about dating frequency automati-
cally evokes an evaluation of one’s romantic
satisfaction DEMO that this evaluation lingers
to become the heuristic attribute when the
global happiness question is subsequently
encountered.
To further illustrate the process of at-
DEMO substitution, consider a question in
a study by Frederick and Nelson (2 004 ):
“If a sphere were dropped into a open
DEMO, such that it just ﬁt (the diameter
P1 : IKB-IRK/KAB P2 : IKB-IYP/KAB QC: IYP/JZO T1 :KOD

270
the cambridge handbook of thinking DEMO reasoning
of the sphere is the same as the interior
width of the cube), what proportion of
the volume of the cube would DEMO sphere
occupy?” The target attribute in this judg-
ment (the DEMO relation between a
cube and sphere) is simple enough to be DEMO
derstood but complicated enough to accom-
modate a wide range of estimates as plau-
sible answers. Thus, if a relevant simpler
computation or perceptual impression ex-
ists, respondents will have no strong basis for
rejecting it as their “ﬁnal answer.” Frederick
and Nelson (2 004 ) proposed that the areal
ratio of the respective cross-sections serves
that function; that is, that respondents an-
swer as if they were asked the simpler two-
dimensional analog of this problem (“If a
circle were drawn inside a square, what pro-
portion of the area of the square does the
circle occupy?”). As evidence, they noted
that the mean estimate of the “sphere inside
cube” problem (74 %) is scarcely different
DEMO the mean estimate of the “circle inside
square” problem (77 %) and greatly exceeds
the correct answer (52 %) – a correct DEMO
swer that most people, not surprisingly, are
surprised by.
Biases
Whenever the heuristic attribute differs
from the target attribute, the substitution
of one for the other inevitably introduces
systematic biases. In this treatment, we
are mostly concerned with weighting bi-
ases,which arise when cues available to
DEMO judge are given either too much or
too little weight. Criteria for determining
optimal weights can be drawn from sev-
eral sources. In the DEMO lens model, the
optimal weights associated with different
cues are the DEMO weights that opti-
mize the prediction of an external criterion,
such as physical distance or the grade point
average that a college applicant DEMO attain
(Brunswik, 1943 ; Hammond, 1955 ). Our
analysis of weighting biases applies to such
cases, but it also extends to attributes for
which no objective criterion is available,
such as an individual’s DEMO happiness
or the probability that a particular patient
will survive surgery. Normative standards for
these attributes must be drawn from the con-
straints of DEMO language and are often
imprecise. For example, the conventional in-
terpretation DEMO overall happiness does not
specify how much weight ought to be given
to various life domains. However, it certainly
does require that substantial weight be given
to every important domain of life and that
no weight DEMO all be given to the current
weather or to the recent consumption of a
cookie. Similar rules of common sense ap-
ply to judgments DEMO probability. For example,
the statement “John is more likely to survive
a week than a month” is clearly true, and,
thus, DEMO a rule that people would want
their probability judgments to follow. Ac-
cordingly, neglect of duration in assessments
of survival probabilities would be properly
described as a weighting bias, even if there
were no way to establish a normative prob-
ability for individual cases (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1 996).
For some judgmental tasks, information
that could serve to supplement or correct the
heuristic is not neglected or underweighted
but simply DEMO If asked to judge the rela-
tive frequency of words beginning with K or
R (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973 )orto com-
pare the population of a familiar foreign city
with one that is unfamiliar (Gigerenzer &
Goldstein, 1 996), respondents have little re-
course but DEMO base their judgments on ease
of retrieval or recognition. The necessary re-
liance on these heuristic attributes renders
such judgments susceptible to biasing factors
(e.g., the amount of media coverage). How-
ever, unlike weighting DEMO, such biases of
insufﬁcient information cannot be described
as errors of DEMO because there is no way
to avoid them.
Accessibility and Substitution
The intent to judge a target attribute initi-
ates a search for a DEMO value. Some-
times this search ends quickly because the
required value can be read from a stored
memory (e.g., the answer to the DEMO
“How tall are you?”) or a current experience
(e.g., DEMO answer to the question “How much
do you like this cake?”). For other judg-
ments, however, the target attribute does

a model of heuristic judgment
271
DEMO readily come to mind, but the search
for it evokes other DEMO that are con-
ceptually and associatively related. For ex-
ample, a DEMO about overall happiness
may retrieve the answer to a related ques-
tion about satisfaction with a particular as-
pect of life upon which one DEMO currently
reﬂecting.
We adopt the term accessibility to refer
to the ease (or effort) with which particu-
lar mental contents come to mind (see, e.g.,
Higgins, 1 996;Tulving & Pearlstone, 1 966).
The question of why thoughts become ac-
cessible – why particular DEMO come to mind
at particular times – has a long history in psy-
chology and encompasses notions of stimu-
lus salience, associative activation, DEMO
attention, speciﬁc training, and priming. In
the present usage, accessibility DEMO determined
jointly by the characteristics of the cogni-
tive mechanisms that produce it and by the
characteristics of the stimuli and events that
evoke DEMO, and it may refer to different aspects
and elements of a DEMO, different ob-
jects in a scene, or different attributes of an
object.
Attribute substitution occurs when a rela-
tively inaccessible target attribute is DEMO
by mapping a relatively accessible and re-
lated heuristic attribute onto the target scale.
Some attributes are permanent candidates
for the heuristic role because DEMO are rou-
tinely evaluated as part of perception and
comprehension and therefore always acces-
sible (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983 ). These
natural assessments include physical prop-
erties such as size and distance and more
abstract DEMO such as similarity (e.g.,
Tversky & Kahneman, 1983 ; see Goldstone
& Son, Chap. 2 ), cognitive ﬂuency in per-
ception DEMO memory (e.g., Jacoby & Dallas,
1 991 ; Schwarz & Vaughn, 2 002 ; Tversky &
Kahneman, 1973 ), causal DEMO (Hei-
der, 1944 ; Kahneman & Varey, 1 990; Mi-
chotte, 1 963 ), surprisingness (Kahneman &
Miller, 1986), mood (Schwarz & Clore,
1983 ), and affective valence (e.g., Bargh,
1 997 ; Cacioppo, Priester, & Berntson, 1 DEMO ;
Kahneman, Ritov, & Schkade, 1 999; Slovic
et DEMO, 2 002 ; Zajonc, 1980, 1 997 ).
Because affective valence is a natural as-
sessment, it is a candidate for attribute sub-
stitution in a wide variety of affect-laden
judgments. Indeed, the evidence suggests
that a list of major general-purpose heuris-
tics should include an DEMO heuristic (Slovic
et al., 2 002 ). Slovic and colleagues (2 002 )
show that a basic affective reaction gov-
erns a wide variety of more complex evalua-
tions such as the cost–beneﬁt ratio DEMO various
technologies, the safe level of chemicals, or
even the predicted economic performance
of various industries. In the same vein, Kah-
neman and Ritov (1 994 ) and Kahneman,
Ritov, and Schkade (1 999) proposed that an
automatic affective valuation is the principal
determinant of willingness to pay for public
goods, and Kahneman, Schkade, and Sun-
stein (1 998 ) interpreted jurors’ assessments
of punitive awards as a mapping of outrage
onto a dollar scale of punishments.
Attributes that are DEMO naturally assessed
can become accessible if they have been re-
cently evoked or primed (see, e.g., Bargh et
al., 1986; Higgins & Brendl, 1 995 ). The ef-
fect of temporary accessibility is DEMO
by the “romantic satisfaction heuristic” for
judging happiness. The mechanism of at-
tribute substitution is the same, however,
whether the heuristic attribute is chronically
or temporarily accessible.
There is sometimes more than one can-
didate DEMO the role of heuristic attribute. For
an example that we borrow from Anderson
(1 991 ), consider the question “Are more
deaths caused DEMO rattlesnakes or bees?” A re-
spondent who has recently read about some-
one who died from a snakebite or bee sting
may use DEMO relative availability of instances
of the two categories as a heuristic. If no
instances come to mind, that person might
consult his or her impressions of the “dan-
gerousness” of the typical snake or bee, an
application of representativeness. Indeed, it
is possible that the question initiates both
a search for instances and an assessment of
dangerousness, and that a contest of accessi-
bility determines the role of the two heuris-
tics DEMO the ﬁnal response. As Anderson ob-
served, it is not always DEMO to determine
a priori which heuristic will govern the re-
sponse to a particular problem.
The original list of heuristics (Tver-
sky & Kahneman, 1974 ) also included an

the cambridge handbook of thinking DEMO reasoning
“anchoring heuristic.” An anchoring effect,
however, does not involve DEMO substitution of
a heuristic attribute for a target attribute: It
is DEMO to the temporary salience of a particu-
lar value of the target attribute. However, an-
choring and attribute substitution are both
instances of a broader family of accessibility
effects (Kahneman, 2 003 ). In attribute sub-
stitution, a highly accessible attribute con-
trols the evaluation of a less accessible one.
In anchoring, a highly accessible value of
the target attribute dominates its judgment.
This conception is compatible with more
recent theoretical DEMO of anchor-
ing (see, e.g., Chapman & Johnson, 1 994 ,
2 002 ; Mussweiler & Strack 1 999; Strack &
Mussweiler, 1 997 ).
Cross-Dimensional Mapping
The process of attribute substitution DEMO
volves the mapping of the heuristic at-
tribute of the judgment object onto the
scale of the target attribute. Our notion of
cross-dimensional mapping DEMO Stevens’
(1975 ) concept of cross-modality matching.
Stevens postulated that intensive DEMO
(e.g., brightness, loudness, the severity of
crimes) can be DEMO onto a common scale
of sensory strength, allowing direct matching
of DEMO across modalities – permitting,
for example, respondents to match the DEMO
ness of sounds to the severity of crimes. Our
conception allows other ways of compar-
ing values across dimensions, such as match-
ing relative positions (e.g., percentiles)
in the frequency distributions or ranges of
DEMO attributes (Parducci, 1 965 ). An im-
pression of a DEMO position in the dis-
tribution of aptitude may be mapped di-
rectly onto a corresponding position in the
distribution of academic achievement and
then DEMO into a letter grade. Note
that cross-dimensional matching is inher-
ently nonregressive: A judgment or predic-
tion is just as extreme as the impression
mapped onto it. Ganzach and Krantz (1 990)
applied the term “univariate matching” to a
closely related notion.
Cross-dimensional mapping presents spe-
cial DEMO when the scale of the tar-
get attribute has no upper bound. Kahne-
man, Ritov, and Schkade (1 999) discussed
two situations DEMO which an attitude (or af-
fective valuation) is mapped onto an un-
bounded scale of dollars: when respondents
in surveys are required to indicate how much
money they would contribute for a cause,
and DEMO jurors are required to specify an
amount of punitive damages against a neg-
ligent ﬁrm. The mapping of attitudes onto
dollars is a variant DEMO direct scaling in psy-
chophysics, where respondents assign num-
bers to DEMO the intensity of sensations
(Stevens, 1975 ). The normal practice DEMO di-
rect scaling is for the experimenter to pro-
vide a modulus –a speciﬁed number that
is to be associated with a standard stimu-
DEMO For example, respondents may be asked
to assign the number 10 DEMO the loudness of
a standard sound and judge the loudness
of other sounds relative to that standard.
Stevens (1975 ) observed that when the ex-
perimenter fails to provide a modulus, re-
spondents spontaneously adopt one. How-
ever, different respondents may pick moduli
that differ greatly (sometimes DEMO by a
factor of 100 or more); thus, the variability
DEMO judgments of particular stimuli is domi-
nated by arbitrary individual differences in
the choice of modulus. A similar analysis
applies to situations in which DEMO
are required to use the dollar scale to ex-
press affection for a species or outrage to-
ward a defendant. Just as Stevens’ observers
DEMO no principled way to assign a number to
a moderately loud sound, survey participants
and jurors have no principled way to scale
affection or outrage into dollars. The anal-
ogy of scaling without a modulus has DEMO
used to explain the notorious variability of
dollar responses in surveys of willingness to
pay and in jury awards (Kahneman, Ritov,
& DEMO, 1 999; Kahneman, Schkade, &
Sunstein, 1 998 )DEMO

ment is expressed overtly only if it is

DEMO this two-system structure. Ob-
servers who are instructed to report the color
in which words are printed tend to stum-
ble when the word DEMO the name of another
color (e.g., the word BLUE printed in green
ink). The difﬁculty arises because the word is
automatically read, and activates a response
(“blue” in this case) that competes with DEMO
required response (“green”). Errors are rare
in the Stroop test, indicating generally suc-
cessful monitoring and control of the overt
response, but the conﬂict produces delays
and hesitations. The successful suppression
of erroneous responses DEMO effortful, and its
efﬁcacy is reduced by stress and distraction.
Gilbert (1989) described a correction
model in which initial impulses are often
wrong and normally overridden. He argued
that people initially believe whatever they
are DEMO (e.g., “Whiteﬁsh love grapes”) and
that it takes some time DEMO mental effort to
“unbelieve” such dubious statements. Here
again, cognitive load DEMO the control-
ling operations of system 2 , increasing the
rate of errors and revealing aspects of intu-
itive thinking that are normally suppressed.
DEMO an ingenious extension of this approach,
Bodenhausen (1 990) exploited natural tem-
poral variability in alertness. He found that
“morning people” were DEMO more
susceptible to a judgment bias (the conjunc-
tion fallacy) in the evening and that “evening
people” were more likely to commit the DEMO
lacy in the morning.
Because system 2 is relatively slow, its DEMO
erations can be disrupted by time pressure.
Finucane et al. (2 DEMO) reported a study in
which respondents judged the risks and ben-
DEMO of various products and technologies
(e.g., nuclear power, chemical plants, cellu-
lar phones). When participants were forced
to respond within 5 DEMO, the correlations
between their judgments of risks and their
judgments of DEMO were strongly nega-
tive. The negative correlations were much
weaker (although DEMO pronounced) when re-
spondents were given more time to ponder
a DEMO When time is short, the same
affective evaluation apparently serves as DEMO
heuristic attribute for assessments of both
beneﬁts and risks. Respondents can move
beyond this simple strategy, but they need
more than 5 seconds to do so. As this exam-
ple illustrates, judgment by heuristic often
yields simplistic assessments, which system 2
sometimes corrects by bringing additional
considerations to bear.
Attribute substitution can be prevented
by alerting respondents to the possibility
DEMO their judgment could be contaminated
by an irrelevant variable. For example, DEMO
though sunny or rainy weather typically af-
fects reports of well-being, DEMO and
Clore (1983 ) found that weather has no
effect if DEMO are asked about the
weather just before answering the well-
being question. Apparently, this question re-
minds respondents that their current mood
(a DEMO heuristic attribute) is inﬂu-
enced by a factor (current weather) DEMO is
irrelevant to the requested target attribute
(overall well-being). Schwarz (1 996) also
found that asking people to describe their
satisfaction with some particular domain of
life reduces the weight this domain receives
in DEMO subsequent judgment of overall well be-
ing. As these examples illustrate, DEMO
priming typically increases the weight of that
variable on judgment (a DEMO 1 effect), this
does not occur if the prime is a sufﬁciently
explicit reminder that brings the self-critical
operations of system 2 into DEMO
We suspect that system 2 endorsements of
intuitive judgments are granted quite casu-
ally under normal circumstances. Consider
the puzzle “A bat and a DEMO cost $1 .10 in to-
tal. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How
much does the ball cost?” Almost everyone
we DEMO reports an initial tendency to answer
“10 cents” because the sum $1 .10 separates
naturally into $1 and 10 cents, and 10 cents
is about the right magnitude. Many peo-
ple yield to this immediate impulse. DEMO
among undergraduates at elite institutions,
about half get this problem wrong when it
is included in a short IQ test (Frederick,
2 004 ). The critical feature of this problem
is that anyone who reports 10 cents has ob-
viously not taken the trouble to check DEMO
or her answer. The surprisingly high rate

the cambridge handbook of thinking DEMO reasoning
system 1 :People are often content to trust
a plausible DEMO that quickly comes to
mind. (The correct answer, by the way, is
5 cents.)
The bat and ball problem elicits many er-
rors, although it is not really difﬁcult and
certainly not ambiguous. A moral of this
example is that people often make quick
intuitive judgments DEMO which they are not
deeply committed. A related moral is that
we should be suspicious of analyses that ex-
plain apparent errors by attributing DEMO re-
spondents a bizarre interpretation of the
question. Consider someone who answers a
question about happiness by reporting her
satisfaction with her romantic life. DEMO re-
spondent is surely not committed to the ab-
surdly narrow interpretation of happiness
that her response seemingly implies. More
likely, at the time of answering, she thinks
that she is reporting happiness: A judgment
DEMO quickly to mind and is not obviously
mistaken – end of story. Similarly, we pro-
pose that respondents who judge probabil-
ity by representativeness do not seriously be-
lieve that the questions “How likely is X DEMO
be a Y?” and “How much does X resemble
the stereotype of Y?” are synonymous. Peo-
ple who make a casual intuitive DEMO
normally know little about how their judg-
ment came about and know even less about
its logical entailments. Attempts to recon-
struct the meaning DEMO intuitive judgments by
interviewing respondents (see, e.g., Hertwig
& Gigerenzer, 1 999) are therefore unlikely
to succeed because such probes require bet-
ter introspective access and more coherent
beliefs than people normally muster.
Identifying DEMO Heuristic
Hypotheses about judgment heuristics have
most often been studied by examining
weighting biases and deviations from nor-
mative rules. However, the hypothesis that
one attribute is substituted for another in a
judgment task – for DEMO, representative-
ness for probability – can also be tested more
directly. DEMO the heuristic elicitation design,
one group of respondents provides judg-
ments of a target attribute for a set of ob-
jects and another DEMO evaluates the hy-
pothesized heuristic attribute for the same
objects. The substitution hypothesis im-
plies that the judgments of the two groups,
when DEMO in comparable units (e.g.,
percentiles), will be identical. This DEMO
examines several applications of heuristic
elicitation.
Eliciting Representativeness
Figure 12 .1 displays the results of two ex-
periments in which a measure of represen-
DEMO was elicited. These results were
published long ago, but we repeat DEMO here
because they still provide the most direct
evidence for both attribute substitution and
the representativeness heuristic. For a more
recent application of a DEMO design, see
Bar-Hillel and Neter (1 993 ).
The object DEMO judgment in the study from
which Figure 12 .1 (a) is drawn (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1973 ;p. 127 in Kahneman, Slovic,
& Tversky, 1982 )was the following descrip-
tion of a DEMO graduate student, which
was shown along with a list of nine DEMO of
graduate specialization:
TomW.isofhigh intelligence, although
lacking in true creativity. DEMO has a need
for order and clarity and for neat and tidy
systems in which every detail ﬁnds its ap-
propriate place. His writing DEMO rather dull
and mechanical, occasionally enlivened by
somewhat corny puns and DEMO ﬂashes of
imagination of the sci-ﬁ type. He has a
strong drive for competence. He seems to
have little feel and little sympathy for DEMO
people and does not enjoy interacting with
others. Self-centered, he nonetheless DEMO a
deep moral sense.
Participants in a representativeness group
ranked the nine ﬁelds of specialization by
the degree to which Tom W. “resembles a
DEMO graduate student.” Participants in the
probability group ranked the nine ﬁelds ac-
cording to the likelihood of Tom W.’s spe-
cializing in each. Figure DEMO .1 (a) plots the

probability is nearly perfect (.97). No
stronger support for attribute-substitution
could be imagined. However, interpreting
representativeness as the heuristic attribute
in these judgments does require two addi-
tional plausible assumptions – that represen-
tativeness is more DEMO than probabil-
ity, and that there is no third attribute that
DEMO explain both judgments.
The Tom W. study was also intended to
examine the effect of the base rates of out-
comes on categorical prediction. DEMO that
purpose, respondents in a third group esti-
mated the proportion DEMO graduate students
enrolled in each of the nine ﬁelds. By design,
some outcomes were deﬁned quite broadly,
whereas others were deﬁned more DEMO
As intended, estimates of base rates var-
ied markedly across ﬁelds, ranging from 3 %
for Library Science to 20% for Humanities
and DEMO Also by design, the descrip-
tion of Tom W. included characteristics (e.g.,
introversion) that were intended to make
him ﬁt the stereotypes of the smaller ﬁelds
(library science, computer science) better
than the larger ﬁelds (humanities and social
sciences).1 As intended, the correlation DEMO
tween the average judgments of representa-
tiveness and of base rates was strongly nega-
tive (−.65 ).
The logic of probabilistic prediction in
DEMO task suggests that the ranking of out-
comes by their probabilities should be in-
termediate between their rankings by rep-
resentativeness and by base DEMO frequencies.
Indeed, if the personality description is taken
to be a DEMO source of information, proba-
bility judgments should stay quite close to
DEMO base rates. The description of Tom W.
was designed to allow considerable scope
for judgments of probability to diverge from
judgments of representativeness, as this logic
requires. Figure 12 .1 (a) shows no such di-
DEMO Thus, the results of the Tom W.
study simultaneously demonstrate the DEMO
stitution of representativeness for probabil-
ity and the neglect of known (DEMO not explic-
itly mentioned) base rates.

the cambridge handbook of thinking DEMO reasoning
As in the Tom W. study, separate groups
of respondents DEMO asked to rank a set of
eight outcomes by representativeness and
probability. The results are shown in Fig-
ure 12 .1 (b). Again the correlation between
these rankings was almost perfect (.99).1
Six of the eight outcomes that subjects
were asked to rank were ﬁllers (e.g., ele-
mentary school teacher, psychiatric social
worker). The two critical DEMO were #6
(bank teller) and the so-called conjunction
item #8 (DEMO teller and active in the fem-
inist movement). Most subjects ranked the
conjunction higher than its constituent, both
in representativeness (85 %) and probabil-
ity (89%). The observed ranking of the two
items is quite reasonable for judgments of
similarity, but not for probability: DEMO may
resemble a feminist bank teller more than
she resembles a bank teller, but she cannot
be more likely to be a feminist bank teller
than to be a bank teller. In this problem, re-
liance on representativeness yields probabil-
ity judgments that violate a basic logical rule.
DEMO in the Tom W. study, the results make two
points: They support the hypothesis of at-
tribute substitution and also illustrate a pre-
DEMO judgment error.
The Representativeness Controversy
The experiments summarized in Figure 12 .1
provided direct evidence for the represen-
tativeness heuristic and two concomitant
biases: neglect of base rates and conjunc-
tion errors. In the terminology introduced
DEMO Tversky and Kahneman (1983 ), the de-
sign of these experiments was “subtle”: Ad-
equate information was available for partic-
ipants to avoid the error, but no effort was
made to call their attention to that informa-
tion. For example, participants in the Tom
W. experiment had general knowledge of the
relative base rates of the various ﬁelds of DEMO
cialization, but these base rates were not ex-
plicitly mentioned in DEMO problem. Similarly,
both critical items in the Linda experiment
were included in the list of outcomes, but
they were separated by a ﬁller so respondents
would not feel compelled to compare them.
In the anthropomorphic DEMO used here,
system 2 was given a chance to correct the
judgment but was not prompted to do so.
In view of the DEMO controversy that
followed, it is perhaps unfortunate that the
articles documenting DEMO rate neglect and
conjunction errors did not stop with subtle
tests. Each article also contained an experi-
mental ﬂourish–a demonstration in which
the error DEMO in spite of a manipula-
tion that called participants’ attention to the
critical variable. The engineer–lawyer prob-
lem (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973 ) DEMO
special instructions to ensure that respon-
dents would notice the base rates of the
outcomes. The brief personality descriptions
shown to respondents were reported DEMO have
been drawn from a set containing descrip-
tions of 30 lawyers and 70 engineers (or vice
versa), and respondents were asked “What
is the probability that this description be-
longs to one of the DEMO lawyers in the sample
of 100?” To the authors’ surprise, DEMO rates
were largely neglected in the responses, de-
spite their salience DEMO the instructions. Sim-
ilarly, the authors were later shocked to dis-
DEMO that more than 80%of undergraduates
committed a conjunction error even when
asked point blank whether Linda was more
likely to be “a bank teller” DEMO “a bank teller
who is active in the feminist movement”
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1983 ). The novelty
of these additional direct or “transparent”
tests was the ﬁnding that respondents con-
tinued to show the biases DEMO with
representativeness even in the presence of
strong cues pointing to the normative re-
sponse. The errors that people make in trans-
parent judgment DEMO are analogous to
observers’ failure to allow for ambient haze
in estimating distances: A correct response
is within reach, but not chosen, and the fail-
ure involves an unexpected weakness of the
corrective operations of DEMO 2 .
Discussions of the heuristics and biases
approach have focused almost exclusively
on the direct conjunction fallacy and on
the engineer–lawyer problems. These DEMO

DEMO the only studies that have been exten-
sively replicated with varying parameters.
The amount of critical attention is remark-
able because the studies were DEMO, in fact,
essential to the authors’ central claim. In
terms DEMO the present treatment, the claim
was that intuitive prediction is an DEMO
of system 1 , which is susceptible to both base
rate neglect and conjunction fallacies. There
wasno intent to deny the possibility of sys-
DEMO 2 interventions that would modify or
override intuitive predictions. Thus, the DEMO
ticles in which these studies appeared would
have been substantially the same, although
far less provocative, if respondents had over-
come base rate DEMO and conjunction er-
rors in transparent tests.
To appreciate why the strong forms of
base rate neglect and of the conjunction fal-
lacy sparked DEMO much controversy, it is use-
ful to distinguish two conceptions of DEMO
rationality (Kahneman, 2 000b). Coherence
rationality is the strict conception that re-
quires the agent’s entire system of beliefs
and preferences to DEMO internally consistent
and immune to effects of framing and con-
text. For example, an individual’s probabil-
ity p (“Linda is a bank teller”) should be the
sum of the probabilities p (“Linda is a bank
teller and a feminist”), and p (“Linda is a bank
teller and not a feminist”). A subtle test of
coherence rationality could DEMO conducted by
asking individuals to assess these three prob-
abilities on separate occasions under circum-
stances that minimize recall. Coherence can
also be tested DEMO a between-groups design. If
random assignment is assumed, the sum of
DEMO average probabilities assigned to the two
component events should equal the average
judged probability of “Linda is a bank teller.”
If this prediction fails, then at least some
individuals are incoherent. Demonstrations
of incoherence present a DEMO chal-
lenge to important models of decision the-
ory and economics, DEMO attribute to agents
a very strict form of rationality (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1986). Failures of perfect coher-
ence are less provocative to psychologists,
who have a more realistic view of human
capabilities.
A DEMO lenient concept, reasoning ra-
tionality, only requires an ability to reason
correctly about the information currently
at hand without demanding perfect consis-
tency DEMO beliefs that are not simulta-
neously evoked. The best known violation
of reasoning rationality is the famous “four
card” problem (Wason, 1 960)DEMO The failure of
intelligent adults to reason their way through
this problem is surprising because the prob-
lem is “easy” in the sense of DEMO easily
understood once explained. What everyone
learns, when ﬁrst told that DEMO peo-
ple fail to solve the four-card problem, is
that one’s DEMO about human rea-
soning abilities had not been adequately cal-
ibrated. There is, of course, no well-deﬁned
metric of reasoning rationality, but whatever
metric one uses, the Wason problem calls
for a downward adjustment. The surprising
results of the Linda and engineer–lawyer
problems led Tversky and Kahneman DEMO a
similar realization: The reasoning of their
subjects was less proﬁcient DEMO they had an-
ticipated. Many readers of the work shared
this conclusion, but many others strongly
resisted it.
The implicit challenge to reasoning ra-
tionality was met by numerous attempts to
dismiss the ﬁndings of the DEMO
and the Linda studies as artifacts of ambigu-
ous language, confusing DEMO, conver-
sational norms, or inappropriate normative
standards. Doubts have been raised about
the proper interpretation of almost every
word in the conjunction problem, including
“bank teller,” “probability,” and even “and”
(see, e.g., Dulany & Hilton, 1 991 ; Hilton &
Slugoski, 2 001 ). These claims are not dis-
cussed in detail here. We suspect that most
of them have some validity and that they
identiﬁed mechanisms DEMO may have made
the results in the engineer–lawyer and Linda
studies exceptionally strong. However, we
note a signiﬁcant weakness shared by all
these critical discussions: They provide no
explanation of the essentially perfect con-
sistency of the judgments observed in di-
rect tests of the conjunction rule and DEMO

comparisons, between-Ss comparisons, and
DEMO important, judgments of representa-
tiveness (see also Bar-Hillel & Neter, DEMO 993 ).
Interpretations of the conjunction fallacy
as an artifact implicitly DEMO the results
of Figure 12 .1 (b) as a coincidence (DEMO an
exception, see Ayton, 1 998 ). The story of
DEMO engineer-lawyer problem is similar. Here
again, multiple demonstrations in which
base DEMO information was used (see Koehler,
1 996, for a review) invited the inference that
there is no general problem of base rate ne-
glect. Again, the data of prediction by repre-
sentativeness in Figure 12 .1 (a) (and related
results reported by Kahneman & Tversky,
1973 ) were ignored.
The demonstrations that under some con-
ditions DEMO avoid the conjunction fallacy
in direct tests, or use explicit base DEMO in-
formation, led some scholars to the blanket
conclusion that judgment DEMO are artiﬁ-
cial and fragile and that there is no need for
judgment heuristics to explain them. This
position was promoted most vigorously by
DEMO (1 991 ). Kahneman and Tversky
(1 996) argued in response that the heuris-
tics and biases position does not preclude the
DEMO of people’s performing ﬂawlessly
in particular variants of the Linda and the
engineer–lawyer problems. Because laypeo-
ple readily acknowledge the validity of
the conjunction DEMO and the relevance of
base rate information, the fact that they
DEMO obey these principles is neither a
surprise nor an argument against the role of
representativeness in routine intuitive pre-
diction. However, the study of conditions
under which errors are avoided can help us
understand the capabilities DEMO limitations
of system 2 .We develop this argument fur-
ther in the next section.
Making Biases Disappear: A Task
for System 2
Much has been learned over the years about
variables and experimental procedures that
reduce DEMO eliminate the biases associated
with representativeness. We next discuss
conditions under which errors of intuition
the cambridge handbook of thinking and reasoning
are successfully DEMO and some circum-
stances under which intuitions may not be
evoked at all.
statistical sophistication
The performance of statistically sophisti-
cated groups of respondents DEMO different ver-
sions of the Linda problem illustrates the ef-
fects of both expertise and research design
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1983 ). Statistical ex-
pertise provided no advantage in the eight-
item version in which DEMO critical items were
separated by a ﬁller and were presumably
considered separately. In the two-item ver-
sion, in contrast, respondents were effec-
tively DEMO to compare “bank teller”
with “bank teller and is active in the femi-
nist movement.” The incidence of conjunc-
tion errors remained essentially unchanged
DEMO the statistically naive in this condi-
tion but dropped dramatically for the statis-
tically sophisticated. Most of the experts fol-
lowed logic rather than DEMO when they
recognized that one of the categories con-
tained the other. In the absence of a prompt
to compare the items, however, DEMO statis-
tically sophisticated made their predictions
in the same way as everyone else does – by
representativeness. As Stephen Jay Gould
(1 991 ,DEMO 469) noted, knowledge of the truth
does not dislodge the feeling that Linda is a
feminist bank teller: “I know [the right an-
swer], yet a little homunculus in my head
continues to jump up and down, shouting at
me – ‘but she can’t just be a bank teller; read
the description.’”
intelligence
Stanovich (1 999) and Stanovich and West
(2 002 ) observed a generally negative corre-
lation between conventional measures of in-
telligence and susceptibility to judgment bi-
ases. They DEMO transparent versions of the
problems, which include adequate cues to
the DEMO answer and therefore provide
a test of reasoning rationality. Not surpris-
ingly, intelligent people are more likely to
possess the relevant logical rules and also to
recognize the applicability of these rules in

DEMO situations. In the terms of
the present analysis, high-IQ respondents
beneﬁt DEMO relatively efﬁcient system 2 op-
erations that enable them to overcome er-
roneous intuitions when adequate informa-
tion is available. (However, when a DEMO
is too difﬁcult for everyone, the correlation
may reverse because the DEMO intelligent re-
spondents are more likely to agree on a plau-
sible error than to respond randomly, as dis-
cussed in Kahneman, 2 DEMO)
frequency format
Relative frequencies (e.g., 1 in 10) are DEMO
vividly represented and more easily under-
stood than equivalent probabilities (.10)DEMO
percentages (10%). For example, the emo-
tional impact of statements of risk is en-
hanced by the frequency format: “1 person
in 1 000 will die” is more frightening than a
probability of .001 (Slovic et al., 2 002 ). The
frequency representation also makes DEMO eas-
ier to visualize partitions of sets and detect
that one set is contained in another. As a
consequence, the conjunction fallacy is gen-
erally avoided in direct tests in which the
frequency format makes it DEMO to recog-
nize that feminist bank tellers are a subset of
bank tellers (Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1 995 ;
Tversky & Kahneman, DEMO ). For similar rea-
sons, some base rate problems are more eas-
ily solved when couched in frequencies than
in probabilities or percentages (Cosmides &
Tooby, 1 996). However, there is little sup-
port for the more general claims about the
evolutionary adaptation of the DEMO to deal
with frequencies (Evans et al., 2 000). Fur-
thermore, the ranking of outcomes by pre-
dicted relative frequency is very similar to
the ranking of the same outcomes by rep-
resentativeness (Mellers, Hertwig, & Kahne-
man, 2 001 ). We conclude that DEMO frequency
format affects the corrective operations of
system 2 , not the intuitive operations of sys-
tem 1 . The language of frequencies improves
DEMO ability to impose the logic of
set inclusion on their considered judgments
but does not reduce the role of representa-
tiveness in their intuitions.
DEMO of attention
The weight of neglected variables can be in-
creased by drawing attention to them, and
experimenters have devised many ingenious
ways to do so. Schwarz et al. (1 991 ) found
that respondents pay more attention to base
rate information when they are instructed
to think DEMO statisticians rather than clini-
cal psychologists. Krosnick, Li, and Lehman
(DEMO 990) exploited conversational conventions
about the sequencing of information and
conﬁrmed DEMO the impact of base rate in-
formation was enhanced by presenting that
information after the personality descrip-
tion rather than before it. Attention to DEMO
base rate is also enhanced when partici-
pants observe the drawing of descriptions
from an urn (Gigerenzer, Hell, & Blank,
1988) DEMO because watching the draw-
ing induces conscious expectations that re-
ﬂect the known proportions of possible out-
comes. The conjunction fallacy can also
be DEMO or eliminated by manipulations
that increase the accessibility of the rel-
evant rule, including some linguistic vari-
ations (Macchi, 1 995 ), DEMO practice with
logical problems (Agnoli, 1 991 ; Agnoli &
DEMO, 1989).
The interpretation of these attentional ef-
fects is straightforward. DEMO assume most
participants in judgment studies know, at
least vaguely, that the base rate is rele-
vant and that the conjunction rule is DEMO
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1982 ). Whether they
apply this knowledge DEMO override an intu-
itive judgment depends on their cognitive
skills (education, intelligence) and on for-
mulations that make the applicability of a
rule apparent (frequency format) or a rel-
evant factor more salient (manipulations of
attention). We assume intuitions are less sen-
sitive to these DEMO and that the appear-
ance or disappearance of biases mainly re-
ﬂects variations in the efﬁcacy of corrective
operations. This conclusion would be circu-
DEMO, of course, if the corrective operations
were both inferred from the observation of
correct performance and used to explain that
performance. Fortunately, the circularity can
be avoided because the role of system 2

within-subjects factorial designs
The relative virtues of between-subjects and
within-subject designs in studies of judg-
ment are a highly contentious issue. Facto-
rial designs DEMO their dismissive critics (e.g.,
Poulton, 1989) and their vigorous DEMO
(e.g., Birnbaum, 1 999). We do not attempt
to DEMO this controversy here. Our nar-
rower point is that between-subjects designs
are more appropriate for the study of heuris-
tics of judgment. The following DEMO
favor this conclusion:
Factorial designs are transparent. Partici-
 pants are likely to identify the variables
that are manipulated, especially if there
are many trials and especially in a fully
factorial design in which the DEMO stimu-
lus attributes are repeated in varying com-
binations. The message that the design
conveys to the participants is that the ex-
perimenter expects DEMO ﬁnd effects of ev-
ery factor that is manipulated (Bar-Hillel
& DEMO, 1981 ; Schwarz, 1 996).
Studies that apply a factorial design
 to judgment tasks commonly involve
schematic and impoverished stimuli. The
DEMO are also highly repetitive. These
features encourage participants to adopt
simple mechanical rules that will allow
them to respond quickly without forming
an individuated DEMO of each stim-
ulus. For example, Ordo´ nez and Benson˜
(1 997 ) required respondents to judge the
attractiveness of gambles on a DEMO
scale. They found that under time pres-
sure many respondents computed or esti-
mated the expected values of the gambles
and used the results DEMO attractiveness rat-
ings (e.g., a rating of 15 for a 52 % chance
to win $31 .50).
Factorial designs often yield judgments
DEMO that are linear combinations of the ma-
nipulated variables. This is a central
conclusion of a massive research effort
conducted by Anderson (1 996), who
observed that people often average or add
where they should DEMO
In summary, the factorial design is not
appropriate for testing hypotheses DEMO bi-
ases of neglect because it effectively guaran-
tees that no manipulated factor is neglected.
Figure 12 .2 illustrates this claim by sev-
eral DEMO of an additive extension effect
that we discuss further in the next section.
The experiments summarized in the differ-
ent panels share three important DEMO:
(1 )In each case, the quantitative variable
plotted on DEMO abscissa was completely ne-
glected in similar experiments conducted in
a between-subjects or subtle design; (2 )in
each case, the quantitative variable DEMO
bines additively with other information; (3 )
in each case, a compelling normative ar-
gument can be made for a quasimulti-
plicative DEMO in which the lines shown in
Figure 12 .2 should fan out. For example, Fig-
ure 12 .2 (c) presents a study of categorical
prediction (Novemsky & Kronzon, 1 999)in
which respondent 5 DEMO the relative like-
lihood that a person was a member of one
occupation rather than another (e.g., com-
puter programmer vs. ﬂight attendant) on
the basis of short personality sketches (e.g.,
“shy, serious, organized, and sarcastic”) and
one of three speciﬁed base rates (10%, 50%,
or 90%). Representativeness and base rate
were varied factorially within subjects. The
effect of base rate is clearly signiﬁcant in this
DEMO (see also Birnbaum & Mellers, 1983 ).
Furthermore, the effects of representative-
ness and base rate are strictly additive. As
Anderson (1 996) argued, averaging (a spe-
cial case of additive combination) DEMO the most
obvious way to combine the effects of two
variables that are recognized as relevant (e.g.,
“She looks like a bank teller, but the base-rate
is low.”). Additivity is not normatively ap-
propriate in this case – any Bayes-like com-
bination would produce curves that DEMO
fan out from the origin and converge again
at high values. Similar considerations apply
to the other three panels of Figure 12 .2 dis-
DEMO later. Between-subjects and factorial
designs often yield different results in stud-
ies of intuitive judgment. Why should we

The main argument against the factorial de-
sign is its poor DEMO validity. Encounter-
ing multiple judgment objects in rapid suc-
cession in a rigidly controlled structure is
unique to the laboratory, and the solutions
that they evoke are not likely to be typical.
Direct comparisons among concepts DEMO
differ in only one variable – such as bank
teller and feminist bank tellers – also provide
a powerful hint and a highly unusual DEMO
tunity to overcome intuitions. The between-
subjects design, in contrast, mimics the hap-
hazard encounters in which most judgments
are made and is DEMO likely to evoke the ca-
sually intuitive mode of judgment that gov-
erns much of mental life in routine situations
(e.g., Langer, 1978).
Prototype Heuristics and the Neglect
of Extension
In this section, we offer a common account
of three superﬁcially dissimilar judgmental
tasks: (1 ) categorical prediction (e.g., “In a

probability that someone described as ‘charm-
ing, talkative, clever, DEMO cynical’ is one of the
lawyers?”); (2 ) summary DEMO of past
events (e.g., “Overall, how aversive was it to
DEMO exposed for 30 minutes to your neighbor’s
car alarm?”); and (3 ) economic valuations
of public goods (e.g., “What is the most you
would be willing to pay to prevent 200,000 mi-
DEMO birds from drowning in uncovered oil
ponds?”). We propose that a generalization
of the representativeness heuristic accounts
for the remarkably similar biases DEMO are ob-
served in these diverse tasks.
The original analysis of categorical pre-
diction by representativeness (Kahneman &
Tversky 1973 ; Tversky & DEMO, 1983 )
invoked two assumptions in which the word
“representative” was used in different ways:
(1 )A prototype (a representative exemplar)
is used to represent categories (e.g., bank
tellers) in the prediction task, and (2 ) the
probability that the individual belongs DEMO a
category is judged by the degree to which the
individual resembles (is representative of) the
category stereotype. Thus, categorical pre-
diction by representativeness involves two
separate acts of substitution – the substitu-
tion of DEMO representative exemplar for a cat-
egory and the substitution of the heuris-
tic attribute of representativeness for the
target attribute of probability. Perhaps be-
DEMO they share a label, the two pro-
cesses have not been DEMO in dis-
cussions of the representativeness heuristic.
We separate them here by describing proto-
type heuristics in which a prototype is sub-
stituted for DEMO category, but in which repre-
sentativeness is not necessarily the heuristic
DEMO
The target attributes to which prototype
heuristics are applied are extensional.An ex-
tensional attribute pertains to an aggregated
property of a set or category DEMO which an
extension is speciﬁed – the probability that
a set of 30 lawyers includes Jack, the over-
all unpleasantness of a set of moments of
hearing a neighbor’s car alarm, and the per-
sonal dollar value of saving a certain number
of birds from drowning in oil DEMO Nor-
mative judgments of extensional attributes
are governed by a general principle of con-
ditional adding, which dictates that each el-
ement of the set adds to the overall judg-
ment an amount that depends on DEMO el-
ements already included. In simple cases,
conditional adding is just regular adding –
the total weight of a collection of chairs is
DEMO sum of their individual weights. In other
cases, each element of DEMO set contributes
to the overall judgment, but the combina-
tion rule DEMO not simple addition and is most
typically subadditive. For example, the DEMO
nomic value of protecting X birds should be
increasing in X, DEMO the value of saving 2 000
birds is for most people less than twice as
large as the value of saving 1 000 birds.
DEMO logic of categorical prediction entails
that the probability of membership in a cat-
egory should vary with its relative size, or
base rate. In prediction by representative-
ness, however, the representation of out-
comes by DEMO exemplars effectively
discards base rates because the prototype of a
category (DEMO, lawyers) contains no informa-
tion about the size of its membership. Next,
we show that phenomena analogous to the
neglect of base DEMO are observed in other
prototype heuristics: The monetary value at-
tached DEMO a public good is often insensitive
to its scope, and the DEMO evaluation of a
temporally extended experience is often in-
sensitive to its duration. These various in-
stantiations of extension neglect (neglect of
base rates, scope, and duration) have been
discussed in separate literatures, but DEMO can
be explained by the two-part process that
deﬁnes prototype heuristics: (1 )A category
is represented by a prototypical exemplar,
and (DEMO )a (nonextensional) property of the
prototype is then used as DEMO heuristic attribute
to evaluate an extensional target attribute of
the category. As might be expected from the
earlier discussion of base rate neglect, exten-
sion neglect in all its forms is most likely to be
observed DEMO between-subjects experiments.
Within-subject factorial designs consistently
yield the additive extension effect illustrated
in Figure 12 .2 .
Scope Neglect in Willingness to Pay
The DEMO valuation method (CVM)
was developed by resource economists (see
Mitchell & Carson, 1989)asa tool for

a model of heuristic judgment
assessing DEMO value of public goods for pur-
poses of litigation or cost–beneﬁt analysis.
Participants in contingent valuation (CV)
surveys are asked to indicate their willing-
ness to pay (WTP) for speciﬁed public goods,
and DEMO responses are used to estimate the
total amount that the community would pay
to obtain these goods. The economists who
design contingent valuation surveys DEMO
pret WTP as a valid measure of economic
value and assume that statements of WTP
conform to the extensional logic of con-
sumer theory. DEMO relevant logic has been
described by a critic of CVM (Diamond,DEMO
1 996), who illustrates the conditional adding
rule by the following example: In the ab-
sence of income effects, WTP for saving DEMO
birds should equal WTP for saving (X − k)
birds, plus WTP to save k birds, where the
last value is contingent on the costless prior
provision of safety for (X − k) DEMO
Strict adherence to Bayes’ rule may be
an excessively demanding standard for intu-
itive predictions; similarly, it would be too
much to ask DEMO WTP responses that strictly
conform to the “add-up rule.” In both cases,
however, it seems reasonable to expect some
sensitivity to extension – to the base rate
of outcomes in categorical prediction and to
the DEMO of the good in WTP. In fact, several
studies have documented DEMO complete
neglect of scope in CV surveys. The best-
known demonstration of scope neglect is an
experiment by Desvouges et al. (1 993 ), who
used the scenario of migratory birds that
drown in oil ponds. The number of birds said
to die each year was varied across DEMO
The WTP responses were completely insen-
sitive to this variable; the DEMO WTPs for
saving 2 000, 20,000,or 200,000 birds DEMO
$80,$78 , and $88 , respectively.
A straightforward interpretation of this
result involves the two acts of substitution
that characterize prototype heuristics. The
DEMO of numerous birds are ﬁrst repre-
sented by a prototypical instance – perhaps
an image of a bird soaked in oil and drown-
ing. DEMO prototype automatically evokes
an affective response, and the intensity of
that DEMO is then mapped onto the dol-
lar scale – substituting the readily accessi-
ble heuristic attribute of affective intensity
283
for the more complex DEMO attribute of
economic value. Other examples of radical
insensitivity to scope lend themselves to a
similar interpretation. Among others, Kah-
neman (1986) found that Toronto residents
were willing to pay almost as much to clean
DEMO polluted lakes in a small region of On-
tario as to clean up all the polluted lakes in
Ontario, and McFadden and Leonard (DEMO 993 )
reported that residents in four western states
were willing DEMO pay only 28% more to protect
57 wilderness areas than to protect a single
area (for more discussion of scope insensitiv-
ity, see DEMO & Fischhoff, 1 998 ).
The similarity between WTP statements
and categorical predictions is not limited
to such demonstrations of almost complete
extension DEMO The two responses also
yield similar results when extension and
prototype information are varied factori-
ally within subjects. Figure 12 .2 (a) shows
DEMO results of a study of WTP for pro-
grams that prevented different levels of
damage to species of varying popularity
(Ritov & Kahneman, DEMO observa-
tions, cited in Kahneman, Ritov, & Schkade,
1 DEMO). As in the case of base rate [Figure
12 .2 (DEMO)], extensional information (levels of
damage) combines additively with nonex-
DEMO information. This rule of combina-
tion is unreasonable; in any plausible DEMO
of value, the lines would fan out.
Finally, the role of the emotion evoked
by a prototypical instance was also exam-
ined directly DEMO the same experiment, us-
ing the heuristic elicitation paradigm intro-
duced DEMO: Some respondents were asked
to imagine that they saw a television DEMO
gram documenting the effect of adverse eco-
logical circumstances on individual mem-
bers of different species. The respondents
indicated, for each species, how DEMO con-
cern they expected to feel while watching
such a documentary. The correlation be-
tween this measure of affect and willingness
to pay, computed across species, was .97.
Duration Neglect in the Evaluation
of Experiences
We next discuss experimental studies of the
global evaluation of experiences that extend

the cambridge handbook of thinking DEMO reasoning
over some time, such as a pleasant or a
horriﬁc DEMO clip (Fredrickson & Kahne-
man, 1 993 ), a prolonged DEMO noise
(Schreiber & Kahneman, 2 000), pressure
from a vise (Ariely, 1 998 ), or a painful med-
ical procedure (DEMO & Kahneman,
1 996). Participants in these studies provided
a continuous or intermittent report of hedo-
nic or affective state, using a designated scale
of momentary affect (Figure 12 .3 ). When
the DEMO had ended, they indicated a
global evaluation of “the total pain DEMO dis-
comfort” associated with the entire episode.
We ﬁrst examine the normative rules that
apply to this task. The global evaluation of
a temporally DEMO outcome is an exten-
sional attribute, which is governed by a DEMO
tinctive logic. The most obvious rule is tem-
poral monotonicity: There DEMO a compelling
intuition that adding an extra period of pain
to an episode of discomfort can only make
it worse overall. Thus, there are two ways
of making a bad episode worse – making
the discomfort DEMO intense or prolonging
it. It must therefore be possible to trade off
intensity against duration. Formal analyses
have identiﬁed conditions under which the
total DEMO of an episode is equal to the
temporal integral of a suitably transformed
measure of the instantaneous utility associ-
ated with each moment (Kahneman, 2 000a;
Kahneman, Wakker, & Sarin, 1 997 ).
Next, we turn to the psychology.
Fredrickson and Kahneman (1 993 ) proposed
a “snapshot model” for the retrospective
evaluation of episodes, which DEMO involves
two acts of substitution: First, the episode is
represented by a prototypical moment; next,
the affective value attached to the represen-
tative moment is substituted for the exten-
sional target attribute of global DEMO
The snapshot model was tested in an exper-
iment in which participants provided con-
tinuous ratings of their affect while watch-
ing plotless ﬁlms DEMO varied in duration and
affective value (e.g., ﬁsh swimming in coral
reefs, pigs being beaten to death with clubs),
and later DEMO global evaluations of their
experiences. The central ﬁnding was that the
retrospective evaluations of these observers
were predicted with substantial accuracy by
a simple DEMO of the peak affect recorded
during a ﬁlm and the end affect reported as
the ﬁlm was about to end. This has been
called DEMO peak/end rule. However, the cor-
relation between retrospective evaluations
and DEMO duration of the ﬁlms was negligible –
a ﬁnding that Fredrickson and Kahneman la-
beled duration neglect. The resemblance of
duration neglect to the DEMO of scope and
base rate is striking and unlikely to be ac-
cidental. In this analysis, all three are mani-
festations of extension neglect caused by the
use of a prototype heuristic.
The peak/end rule DEMO duration neglect
have both been conﬁrmed on multiple oc-
casions. Figure 12 .3 presents raw data from
a study reported by Redelmeier and Kahne-
DEMO (1 996), in which patients undergoing
colonoscopy reported their current DEMO of
pain every 60 seconds throughout the proce-
dure. Here again, DEMO average of peak and end
pain quite accurately predicted subsequent
global evaluations and choices. The duration
of the procedure varied considerably among
patients (from 4 to 69 minutes), but these
differences were not reﬂected in DEMO
global evaluations in accord with duration
neglect. The implications of these psycho-
logical rules of evaluation are paradoxical. In
Figure 12 .3 , for DEMO, it appears evident
that patient B had a worse colonoscopy than
DEMO A (on the assumption they used the
scale similarly). However, it is also appar-
ent that the peak/end average was worse
DEMO patient A, whose procedure ended at
a moment of relatively intense DEMO The
peak/end rule prediction for these two pro-
ﬁles is that patient A would evaluate the
procedure more negatively than patient B
and DEMO be more likely to prefer to un-
dergo a barium enema rather than a repeat
colonoscopy. The prediction was correct for
these two individuals DEMO conﬁrmed by the
data of a large group of patients.
The effects of substantial variations of du-
ration remained small (although statistically
robust) DEMO in studies conducted in a fac-
torial design. Figure 12 .2 (DEMO) is drawn from a
study of responses to ischemic pain (Ariely,
1 998 ), in which duration varied by a factor of
4 . The peak/end average accounted for 98%

of the systematic variance of global evalua-
tions in that study and for 88 %of the DEMO
ance in a similar factorial study of responses
to loud unpleasant sounds [Schreiber & Kah-
neman, 2 000, Figure 12 .2 (b)]. Contrary to
the normative standard for an extensional at-
tribute, the effects of duration and of other
determinants of evaluation were additive
[Figures 12 DEMO (b) and 12 .2 (d)].
The participants in these DEMO were
well aware of the relative duration of their
experiences and did not consciously de-
cide to ignore duration in their evalua-
tions. As DEMO and Kahneman (1 993 )
noted, duration neglect is an DEMO
phenomenon:
... duration neglect does not imply
that duration information is lost, nor
that people believe that duration is
285
unimportant ... people may be aware of
duration and consider it important in the
abstract DEMO what comes most readily to
mind in evaluating episodes are the salient
moments of those episodes and the affect
associated with those moments. Duration
DEMO might be overcome, we suppose, by
drawing attention more explicitly to the
attribute of time. (p. 54 )
This comment applies equally DEMO to
other instances of extension neglect: The ne-
glect of base DEMO in categorical prediction,
the neglect of scope in willingness to pay, the
neglect of sample size in evaluations of ev-
idence (Grifﬁn & Tversky, 1 992 ; Tversky &
Kahneman, 1971 ), and the neglect of prob-
ability of success in evaluating a program of
DEMO preservation (DeKay & McClelland,
1 995 ). More generally, DEMO plays a
similar role in any situation in which the in-
tuitive judgments generated by system 1 vio-
late rules that would be accepted DEMO valid by
the more deliberate reasoning that we asso-
ciate with system 2 .Aswe noted earlier, the
responsibility for these judgmental mishaps
is properly shared by the two systems: Sys-
tem 1 produces the initial error, and system
2 fails to correct it, although it could.
Violations DEMO Dominance
The conjunction fallacy observed in the
Linda problem is an example of a domi-
nance violation in judgment: Linda must be
at least as likely to be a bank teller as to
be a feminist DEMO teller, but people be-
lieve the opposite. Insensitivity to extension
(in this case, base rate) effectively guaran-
tees the existence of such DEMO viola-
tions. For another illustration, consider the
question: “How many murders were there
last year in [Detroit/Michigan]?” Although
there cannot be DEMO murders in Detroit
than in Michigan, because Michigan con-
tains Detroit, the word “Detroit” evokes a
more violent image than the word “Michi-
DEMO (except of course for people who im-
mediately think of Detroit DEMO Michigan
is mentioned). If people use an impres-
sion of violence as a heuristic and neglect
geographic extension, their estimates of

mates for the state. In a large sample of Uni-
versity of Arizona students, this hypothesis
was conﬁrmed – the median estimate of the
number of murders DEMO 200 for Detroit and
100 for Michigan.
Violations of dominance akin to the con-
junction fallacy have been observed in sev-
eral other experiments DEMO both indi-
rect (between-subjects) and direct tests. In a
clinical experiment reported by Redelmeier,
Katz, and Kahneman (2 001 ), half of a large
group of patients (N = 682 ) undergoing a
colonoscopy were randomly assigned to a
condition that made the actual experience
DEMO worse. Unbeknownst to the patient,
the physician deliberately delayed the re-
moval of the colonoscope for approximately
1 minute beyond the normal time. DEMO in-
strument was not moved during the extra pe-
riod. For many patients, the mild discomfort
of the added period was an improvement
relative to the pain than they had just ex-
perienced. For these patients, of course, pro-
longing the procedure reduced the peak/end
average of discomfort. As expected, retro-
spective evaluations were less negative in
the experimental group, and a 5 -year follow-
up showed that participants in that group
were also somewhat more likely to comply
with recommendations to undergo DEMO repeat
colonoscopy (Redelmeier, Katz, & Kahne-
man, 2 001 )DEMO
In an experiment that is directly analo-
gous to the demonstrations of the conjunc-
tion fallacy, Kahneman et al. (1 993 ) exposed
DEMO to two cold-pressor experiences,
one with each hand: a “short” DEMO (im-
mersion of one hand in 14 ◦Cwater for
60 seconds), and a “long” episode (the short
episode, plus an additional 30 seconds during
which the water was gradually warmed to
15 ◦C). DEMO participants indicated the inten-
sity of their pain throughout the experience.
When they were later asked which of the
two experiences they preferred to DEMO,
a substantial majority chose the long trial.
These choices violate dominance, because
after 60 seconds in cold water anyone will
prefer the immediate experience of a warm
towel to 30 extra seconds of slowly dimin-
DEMO pain. In a replication, Schreiber and
Kahneman (2 000, experiment DEMO ) exposed
participants to pairs of unpleasant noises in
immediate succession. The participants lis-
tened to both sounds and chose one to be re-
DEMO at the end of the session. The “short”
noise lasted 8 seconds at 77 db. The “long”
noise consisted of the short noise plus DEMO
extra period (of up to 24 seconds) at 66 db
(DEMO aversive, but still unpleasant and cer-
tainly worse than silence). DEMO again, the
longer noise was preferred most of the time,
DEMO this unlikely preference persisted over a
series of ﬁve choices.
The violations of dominance in these di-
rect tests are particularly surprising because
the DEMO is completely transparent. The
participants in the experiments could eas-
ily retrieve the durations of the two experi-
ences between which they had to DEMO,
but the results suggest that they simply
ignored duration. A simple explanation is
that the results reﬂect “choosing by liking”
(see Frederick, DEMO 002 ). The participants in
the experiments simply followed the nor-
DEMO strategy of choice: “When choosing be-
tween two familiar options, consult your ret-
rospective evaluations and choose the one
that you like most (or dislike least).” Lik-
ing and disliking are products of system DEMO ,
which do not conform to the rules of ex-
tensional DEMO System 2 could have inter-
vened, but in these experiments it DEMO
did not. Kahneman et al. (1 993 ) described a
participant DEMO their study, who chose to re-
peat the long cold-pressor experience. DEMO
after the choice was recorded, the partic-
ipant was asked which DEMO the two expe-
riences was longer. As he correctly identi-
ﬁed the long trial, the participant was heard
to mutter “the choice I made doesn’t seem
to make much sense.” Choosing by liking
is a form DEMO mindlessness (Langer, 1978),
which illustrates the casual governance of
DEMO 2 .
Like the conjunction fallacy in direct
tests, which we DEMO earlier, violations
of temporal monotonicity in choices should
be viewed as DEMO expendable ﬂourish. Be-
cause the two aversive experiences occurred
within a few minutes of each other and

287
DEMO could accurately recall the dura-
tion of the two events, system DEMO had enough
information to override choosing by liking.
Its failure to do so is analogous to the fail-
ures observed in direct tests of DEMO Linda
problem. In both cases, the violations of
dominance tell us DEMO new about sys-
tem 1 ; they only illustrate an unexpected
weakness of system 2 .Just as the theory of
intuitive categorical prediction would DEMO
remained intact if the conjunction fallacy
had not “worked” in a direct test, the model
of evaluation by moments would have sur-
vived even if violations of dominance had
been eliminated in highly transparent situa-
tions. DEMO same methodological issues arise
in both contexts. Between-subjects experi-
ments or subtle tests are most appropriate
for studying the basic intuitive evaluations of
system DEMO , and also most likely to reveal com-
plete extension neglect. Factorial designs in
which extension is manipulated practically
guarantee an effect of this DEMO, and al-
most guarantee that it will be additive, as
in Figures 12 .2 (b) and 12 .2 (d) (Ariely, DEMO 998 ;
Ariely, Kahneman, & Loewenstein, 2 000;
Schreiber & Kahneman, 2 000). Finally, al-
though direct choices sometimes DEMO sys-
tematic violations of dominance, these vio-
lations can be avoided DEMO manipulations that
prompt system 2 to take control.
In our view, DEMO similarity of the re-
sults obtained in diverse contexts is a com-
pelling argument for a uniﬁed interpreta-
tion, and a signiﬁcant challenge to critiques
that pertain only to selected subsets of this
body of evidence. DEMO number of commenta-
tors have offered competing interpretations
of base rate neglect (Cosmides & Tooby,
1 996;Koehler, 1 996), insensitivity DEMO scope
in WTP (Kopp, 1 992 ), and duration ne-
DEMO (Ariely & Loewenstein, 2 000). How-
ever, these interpretations DEMO generally spe-
ciﬁc to a particular task and would not carry
over to analogous ﬁndings in other domains.
Similarly, the various attempts to explain the
conjunction fallacy as an artifact do not ex-
plain analogous violations DEMO dominance in
the cold-pressor experiment. The account
we have offered is, DEMO contrast, equally ap-
plicable to all three contexts and possibly
others (see also Kahneman, Ritov, &
Schkade, 1 999). We DEMO extension ne-
glect and violations of dominance to a lazy
system 2 , and to a prototype heuristic that
combines two processes of system DEMO : the rep-
resentation of categories by prototypes and
the substitution of a nonextensional heuris-
tic attribute for an extensional target at-
tribute. We DEMO propose that people have
some appreciation of the role of extension
in the various judgment tasks. Consequently,
they will incorporate extension in their DEMO
ments when their attention is drawn to this
factor – most reliably in factorial experi-
ments, and sometimes (although not always)
in DEMO tests. The challenge for compet-
ing interpretations is to provide a uniﬁed ac-
count of the diverse phenomena that have
been considered in this DEMO
Conclusions and Future Directions
The original goal of the heuristics and biases
program was to understand intuitive judg-
ment under uncertainty. Heuristics were de-
DEMO as a collection of disparate cognitive
procedures, related only by their DEMO
function in a particular judgmental domain –
choice under uncertainty. It now appears,
however, that judgment heuristics are ap-
plied in a wide variety of domains and share
a common process of attribute substitution,
DEMO which difﬁcult judgments are made by
substituting conceptually or semantically re-
lated assessments that are simpler and more
readily accessible.
The current treatment explicitly DEMO
dresses the conditions under which intu-
itive judgments are modiﬁed or overridden.
Although attribute substitution provides an
initial input into many judgments, it need
not be the sole basis for them. Initial impres-
sions are often DEMO, moderated, or
overridden by other considerations, includ-
ing the recognition DEMO relevant logical rules
and the deliberate execution of learned al-
gorithms. The role of these supplemental or
alternative inputs depends on characteristics
of the DEMO and the judgment task.

tic) can be DEMO assigned to one sys-
tem or the other. The placement of di-
viding lines between “systems” is arbitrary
because the bases by which we DEMO
mental operations (difﬁculty of acquisition,
accessibility to introspection, and disrupt-
ability) are all continua. However, this does
not make distinctions less DEMO; there
is broad agreement that mental operations
range from rapid, automatic, perception-like
impressions to deliberate computations that
apply explicit rules or external aids.
Many have questioned the usefulness
of the notion of heuristics and biases DEMO
pointing to inconsistencies in the degree to
which illusions are manifested across differ-
ent studies. However, there is no mystery
here to explain. Experimental studies of “the
same” cognitive illusions can yield different
results for two DEMO: (1 ) because of vari-
ation in factors that determine the accessi-
bility of the intuitive illusion, and (2 ) be-
cause DEMO vary in factors that determine the
accessibility of the corrective thoughts that
are associated with system 2 . Both types of
variation can often DEMO anticipated because
of the vast amount of psychological knowl-
edge that has accumulated about the differ-
ent sets of factors that determine the ease
DEMO which thoughts come to mind – from
principles of grouping in perception to prin-
ciples that govern transfer of training in rule
learning (Kahneman, 2 003 ). Experimental
surprises will occur, of course, and DEMO
lead to reﬁnements in the understanding of
the rules of accessibility.
The argument that system 1 will be ex-
pressed unless it is overridden DEMO system 2
sounds circular, but it is not, because empir-
ical criteria can be used to test whether a par-
ticular characterization of DEMO two systems is
accurate. For example, a feature of the situ-
DEMO will be associated with system 2 if it is
shown to inﬂuence judgments only when at-
tention is explicitly directed to it (through,
say, a within-subjects design). In contrast, a
variable will be DEMO with system 1 if it
can be shown to inﬂuence even those judg-
ments that are made in a split second. Thus,
one DEMO not be committed, a priori, to as-
signing a process to a particular system; the
data will dictate the best characterization.
The two-system model is a framework
that combines a set of empirical generaliza-
tions DEMO cognitive operations with a set
of tests for diagnosing the types of cognitive
operations that underlie judgments in spe-
ciﬁc situations. The generalizations and DEMO
speciﬁc predictions are testable and can be
recognized as true or false. The framework
itself will be judged by its usefulness as a
heuristic DEMO research.

Note
1 . The entries plotted in Figure 12 .1 are averages
of multiple DEMO, and the correlations are
computed over a set of judgment objects. DEMO
should be noted that correlations between av-
erages are generally much higher than corre-
sponding correlations within the data of indi-
vidual respondents (Nickerson, 1 995 ). Indeed,
group results may even be unrepresentative DEMO
they are dominated by a few individuals who
produce more variance than others and have
an atypical pattern of responses. Fortunately,
this particular DEMO is not applicable to
the experiments of Figure 12 .1 ,in DEMO all re-
sponses were ranks.
