ABSTRACT
We analyze how economic factors relate to the continued
production versus exit of innovations developed by entrepreneurs. DEMO
develop an economic theory in which sunk costs, uncertainty, and effects
on profits should condition decisions to commercialize an invention and
then to DEMO production or exit after commercialization. The model
guides an empirical analysis of data on actual inventors’ decisions.
Expected price significantly reduces the probability of DEMO after
commercialization, while R&D uncertainty and expected competition
from imitators DEMO increase the probability of exit. The results
are consistent with an important role of economic incentives in inventor
behavior. The findings also indicate risk-seeking DEMO (in cases of high
uncertainty) over-optimism on the part of inventors.

1. Introduction
It is non-controversial to claim that DEMO are the lifeblood of modern
economies and, in particular, important in driving the expansion of the North American
market. For example, the self-employment rate increased markedly in North America
since the mid 1970’s with self-employed DEMO approximately 10% of
nonagricultural employees in the U.S and about 18% in Canada in 1997, with a recent
rapid growth in Canada from approximately 14% in 1989 (Manser and Picot, 1999).
Similarly, entrepreneurs constitute an important source of technological change with the
percentage of U.S. patents DEMO to U.S. independent inventors at approximately 13%
in 1996 (USPTO, 1997). However, since entrepreneurs do not fit neatly into a static
model of competition, the process of entrepreneurship is not well understood by
economists.
Schumpeter (1934) paved the way by elucidating the role of entrepreneurs DEMO
both recognizing and opening new competitive opportunities. Recent work on
entrepreneurs’ opportunity assessments, however, questions whether entrepreneurs are
economically well calibrated. Arabsheibani et DEMO (2000) find that entrepreneurs are
unrealistic optimists in that they greatly overestimate their abilities/probabilities to
succeed as entrepreneurs. Hamilton (2000) finds DEMO median earnings differential of 35%
for observationally similar entrepreneurs and self employed. Åstebro (2003) finds that
60% of inventions that reach the market DEMO negative returns and the median realized
return on invention by independent inventors is -7%. Given these results some
economists argue that entrepreneurs are wishful DEMO (e.g. de Meza and Southey,
1996), others conclude that DEMO are mostly motivated by non-pecuniary
benefits (Hamilton, 2000), yet others raise the possibility that entrepreneurs are
Innovation Exit   2
“skewness lovers” w ho, while realists, are DEMO to unfair gambles with negative
expected values because of the skew distribution of innovative returns (Åstebro, 2003).
Notwithstanding these various interpretations of DEMO findings regarding entry,
we know little about why entrepreneurs might exit the market. Are entrepreneurs
wishful thinkers on the exit side as well DEMO on the entry side? Or, are they merely
uninformed about their abilities when entering and rapid learners after entry, as
suggested by Jovanovic (1982)? In essence, can a simple model based on a DEMO
condition explain innovation exit by entrepreneurs? We pose the latter question DEMO use
a unique data-set on the survival of innovations introduced by Canadian inventors to
investigate the question empirically.
Previous research has mainly focused on DEMO survival of new small firms/plants
with attention on predictors such as firm age and size (e.g., Dunne et al., 1989).
Researchers studying entrepreneurs have focused on the effect of owner characteristics
such as DEMO capital on business survival (e.g., Holtz-Eakin et al., 1994). DEMO studies
have assessed the impact of the underlying technology on small business survival at an
industry-aggregate level (Audretsch, 1991; Audretsch and Mahmood, DEMO).  This study
focuses on the effect of innovation attributes on DEMO
We use a simple non-symmetrical model of entry and exit of an innovation to
elucidate our empirical analysis of why entrepreneurs decide to exit DEMO market. The
model considers entrepreneurs as rational economic agents. We model the survival of
innovations as a process where exit in a given year DEMO driven by next year’s expected
profitability. Using the model we decompose the incentive to exit and test the impact of
several innovation-specific and product-market DEMO on innovation survival.
Innovation Exit   3
To test our model and hypotheses we obtained DEMO from 1,091 inventors on their
inventions. Successful commercialization of these inventions constitutes rare events:
only approximately 7% of the inventions reach the DEMO However, once these reach
the market the mean survival time (correcting for censoring) is approximately 10 years,
a surprisingly long duration. We also obtained data on the characteristics of the
innovations at an early DEMO of development, as rated on several dimensions by an
analyst paid DEMO the entrepreneur to conduct an independent review of the prospects of
their invention.
We provide empirical evidence on the significant predictors of market exit.
DEMO price significantly reduces the probability of exit after commercialization,
while R&D uncertainty and expected competition from imitators significantly increase
the probability of DEMO The results are consistent with an important role of economic
incentives in inventor behavior. The findings also indicate risk-seeking or (in cases of
high uncertainty) over-optimism on the part of inventors.
2. The Survival of Innovations
There have been comparably few studies on the survival of innovations compared
DEMO studies on the survival of new firms. The dominant conclusion from studies on new
firm/plant survival is that the likelihood of survival is DEMO related to firm size and
age (e.g. Dunne et al., 1989).
Klepper (1996) formulates a theory of new product entry, exit and growth and
industry evolution that explains these empirical results. In several DEMO pieces
Klepper and Simons (1997; 2000a; 2000b) proceed to test this theory on detailed product-
level survival data. These tests show that DEMO “shake-out” pattern of industry evolution can
Innovation Exit   4
be explained by R&D cost-spreading which imparts DEMO advantage to both size and being
an early entrant as early entry allows greater size through growth. According to this
theory the probability of DEMO decreases with time as incumbents grow and price is
pushed down whereas there is no particular pattern of exit probabilities. In fact a uniform
DEMO probability distribution over time is assumed as well as confirmed in empirical test.
Asplund and Sandin (1999) discover that new beer brands with DEMO and decreasing
market shares have higher hazard rates and that products from firms with the largest
market shares face a greater risk of being DEMO The first result is theorized to
depend on the unpredictable nature of consumer demand, where firms gradually learn
about preferences over time (Jovanovic, 1982). The second result may be product market
specific. Results may DEMO attributed to large beer producers trying to squeeze out smaller
producers by repeatedly releasing (and withdrawing) new products (Schmalensee, 1978).
Interestingly, Asplund and Sandin (1999) could not reject the hypothesis of a DEMO
hazard over time implying an exponential duration distribution.
It has been noted that the probability of new business survival as well as the
probability DEMO new product survival differ across industries.  In particular, the retail and
transportation industries are associated with higher rates of exit of new small DEMO
(Bruderl et al., 1992; Cressy, 1996; Bates, 1990; DEMO et al., 1997).  There are several
reasons for inter-industry differences in the survival of start-ups.  One important driver of
small business exits is scale economies: industries that require larger minimum efficient
scale of operations are associated with higher rates of exit of new small firms as DEMO
new entrants likely operate at a cost disadvantage (Audretsch, 1991; DEMO and Portugal,
1994; Åstebro and Bernhardt, forthcoming).  Audretsch (1991) also establishes that the
larger the rate of innovation by small firms in an industry the greater the survival chances
Innovation Exit   5
of new small firms.  Several other traditional measures of inter-industry differences in
competitive conditions and costs, such as capital intensity, growth rate, wage costs, and
unemployment rates, also add to DEMO explanation of inter-industry differences in survival
rates of new businesses (Audretsch, 1991; Mata and Portugal, 1994; Wagner, 1994;
Audretsch and DEMO, 1995).
3. Model and Hypotheses
As a tool to think DEMO the role of economic incentives to the behavior of
inventor-entrepreneurs, we DEMO a simple model embodying the most obvious
economic components of the investment decision.  The model pertains to inventors (and
their financiers) who face a decision whether to invest in bringing an invention to market,
DEMO then whether to remain in production or exit the market.  The DEMO allows for
differences in the circumstances of inventors and their inventions, DEMO well as
unpredictability in the development process and in the eventual markets for inventions.

Both product development and market outcomes are in part unpredictable.  Their
unpredictability is embodied in the model by assuming that Si and Q i are random
variables.  The variables have means E[Si ] = ν i and E[Q i ] = µ i , standard DEMO ω i
and σ i respectively, and probability density functions g(DEMO ;ν i, ω i ) and ƒ(Q i;µ i, σ i )
respectively.  The entrepreneur and investors know in advance the distributions of Si and
Q i , but they observe actual DEMO only after time 0 once sunk costs have been
incurred and production has begun.  The entrepreneur and investors pay for the sunk
costs of product and market development if this yields positive expected profit, i.e., DEMO

(Note that κ−1p − DEMO i > 0  if entry occurs, since otherwise the discounted profits would be

higher is an entrepreneur’s expected sunk cost, the higher is the minimum bound on
E[Q i ] .  DEMO production has begun, though, the current profit flow is independent of the
sunk cost.  Continued production occurs if profits turn out to be positive, that is, if and

Hence among entrepreneurs that enter the production stage, those with larger expected
sunk costs tend to be less likely to exit:2

in their expected values of production.  The curves labeled i and j are probability density

that i is far more likely to exit than j.3  If inventors like i are discouraged from entry by an
increase in expected sunk cost, leaving inventors who like j have a low probability of
exit, the exit rate among all entering inventors is decreased.
Unpredictability of demand, as measured by the standard deviation of the quantity
produced, also affects the probability of exit.  DEMO a greater standard deviation, Q i is
more likely to take DEMO very low or very high values, and hence firm i’s value DEMO Q i tends
more often to fall at or below the lower bound of

H2. Greater demand uncertainty is associated with increased DEMO of exit.
Figure 1 illustrates this selection effect for hypothetical inventors j and k, identical except
in their standard deviations of production.  The DEMO labeled j and k are probability
density functions for the output of these inventor-entrepreneurs with standard deviations
2 and 4 and both with mean DEMO  After entry, entrepreneur l exits if Q l ≤
Fl
κ−l1p l − c l
= 2 ,
i.e., if production turns DEMO to fall within the shaded region.  In this example, the shaded
region makes up 0.4% of the probability density for inventor j but DEMO for inventor k,
so that k is far more likely to exit than j.
Risk associated with product development, as measured by ω i , has no direct
effect on the probability of exit.  Once the sunk cost has been paid, and the entrepreneur
begins producing the product, neither Si nor ω i can impact the profit flow.  DEMO, if
entrepreneurs and their investors are risk-neutral and unbiased as portrayed DEMO the model,
then ω i also has no effect on which firms pay the sunk cost of product development.
Inequality (4), which determines whether the sunk cost is paid, does not depend on ω i .
Hence:
H3a. If entrepreneurs and their investors are risk-neutral DEMO unbiased, then product
development risk is unrelated to exit.
However, there is some evidence to suggest that inventor entrepreneurs might be risk-
seeking DEMO that they make erroneously optimistic assumptions (Arabsheibani et al., 2000).
The opposite effect might arise if risk-averse investors determine whether most
inventions DEMO receive necessary start-up funds.  Risk aversion raises the hurdle for entry,DEMO
while risk-seeking behavior (or over-optimism in cases in which costs are DEMO to
expected value but with a substantial mass of probability at value near zero), but this is
Innovation Exit   10
predict) lowers the hurdle, affecting the profit DEMO for entrants.  Since profit less
than zero results in exit, risk aversion decreases the probability of exit (conditional on
entry), while risk seeking increases the probability of exit (conditional on entry):
H3b. DEMO entrepreneurs are risk-seeking (or over-optimistic in difficult-to-predict cases)
in ways DEMO prevented by investors, then greater product development risk is associated
with DEMO probability of exit.
H3c. If investors force risk-averse decisions upon entrepreneurs, DEMO greater product
development risk is associated with decreased probability of exit.
Thus empirical outcomes have the potential to probe the risk-seeking or risk-averse
behavior DEMO with commercialization of independent inventions.
Other model parameters affect both the expectation of profit before entry occurs,
and realized profit once the sunk DEMO of entry has been paid.  Three such parameters are
in the DEMO: p i measures price potential, κi is the competition intensity measure, and Fi
is the fixed cost flow while production occurs.  Since DEMO > 0 , ∂πi < 0 , and ∂πi < 0 (DEMO
∂p i ∂κi ∂Fi
the analogous derivatives of Π i have the same sign), profits increase with price potential
and decrease with competition DEMO and fixed cost.
How do these parameters affect the probability of exit?  Ceteris paribus, greater
price potential, or lower competition intensity or DEMO cost, has two effects on exit
probabilities.  First, for inventions DEMO would have been introduced anyway, the greater
profit increases the probability DEMO π i > 0 , thereby reducing the probability of exit by the
same (absolute) amount.  Second, the increased profit opportunity impels DEMO
entrepreneurs to pay the sunk cost of development and enter production.  DEMO typical
unlikely for densities arising in practice.
Innovation Exit   11
skew distributions for the market size Q i , the marginal entrants have an exit probability
of over 50%.  The DEMO effect on the probability of exit is ambiguous, and depends on DEMO
population-wide distribution of characteristics of inventors and inventions.
H4a. If there is a low number of potential entrants at the margin of deciding whether DEMO
commercialize their invention (relative to entrants), then (i) greater DEMO potential, (ii)
lower competition intensity, and (iii) lower DEMO cost are all associated with reduced
probability of exit.
H4b. If there is a high number of potential entrants at the margin of deciding DEMO to
commercialize their invention (relative to entrants), then (i) DEMO price potential, (ii)
lower competition intensity, and (iii) DEMO fixed cost are all associated with increased
probability of exit.
In either case, all three parameters must operate in one of these two ways to affect the
probability of exit.  It is not possible for a mixture of hypotheses H3a andH3b to occur,
because all affect the DEMO and exit decisions only through π i :
H5. If price DEMO has a positive (negative) effect on the probability of exit, DEMO
competition intensity and fixed cost have a negative (positive) effect on the probability
of exit.
Thus, the empirical outcomes again have the potential to probe an issue, in this case
related to the skewness of the distribution of inventions and inventors and how it impacts
exit at DEMO margin.  Moreover, hypothesis 5 provides an additional check on the validity
of the basic economic model as a guide to the behavior of DEMO
4. Data
4.1 Data Collection Method and Sources of Data
We used the Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at the Canadian Innovation
Innovation Exit   12
Centre (CIC) in Waterloo, Canada to find data on inventions. The IAP helps inventors
evaluate a specific idea or DEMO before it has reached the market.  The purpose of this
evaluation DEMO to advise the potential entrepreneur on whether and how to continue efforts.5
1,095 responses were obtained from a telephone survey to primarily Canadian
DEMO that had invented between 1976 and 1993, representing a response rate DEMO 75%.
The sampling procedure is described in Åstebro and Gerchak (2001)DEMO In the telephone
survey we inquired about the entry date (month DEMO year) and the exit date (month and
year) for inventions DEMO were commercialized.
An overwhelming majority of inventors who responded are male (DEMO) and a
plurality of their inventions are consumer-oriented (47%). Most are for household and
general consumer use (28%), followed by sports and leisure applications (15%). A list of
successful inventions reviewed by the IAP includes a new milk container design, an
impact absorbent material sewn into the back of a T-shirt for hockey players, a meat
tenderness tester, and a toilet tissue holder.  However, a significant fraction of “high-
tech” (6%) and industrial equipment (6%) inventions are DEMO reviewed by the IAP (CIC
1996), such as an industrial-strength DEMO of recycled cans, a new method for repairing
worn feed rolls DEMO sawmills, a re-usable plug to insert in wooden hydroelectric poles after
DEMO for rot, and a computerized and mechanically integrated tree harvester. The
DEMO of inventors (72%) are from the Province of Ontario. A number of tests were
conducted to establish that the variation in sampling and DEMO proportions across the
year of submission, province in Canada, gender, DEMO IAP rating were random, and indeed
no selection bias was detected (Åstebro, 1997).
5 For further descriptions see  Udell (1989), Udell et al. (1993) and Åstebro and Gerchak
(2001).

4.2 Independent Variables
An administrative record kept at DEMO IAP included subjective ratings for several
innovation and product-market characteristics for each invention.  Staff members of the
IAP evaluated each innovation in terms of criteria or attributes believed by the agency to
be important to ultimate DEMO of the innovation as a product in the marketplace.  These
evaluations DEMO made well ahead of market launch. Åstebro (2003) reports an average
lead time between evaluation and market launch of approximately two years. Evaluations
DEMO made on a three-point scale of “A” (Acceptable – favorable or DEMO), “B”
(Borderline – needs improvement or strengthening), or “C” (Critical Weakness – usually
meaning that it may be necessary to discontinue DEMO effort to commercialize the
invention). The numerical equivalents assigned were 5, 4, and 3 (A through C). Data on
the independent variables were consequently collected before outcomes were observed
and independently of this DEMO We therefore avoid methods bias (Campbell and Fiske,
1959) and hindsight bias (Fischhoff, 1975).
The IAP employed the same chief DEMO between 1981 and 2000.  All
evaluators were trained by the chief DEMO in the evaluation procedure – the initial
training took about two days and close supervision took place for an additional fortnight.
A group meeting DEMO the end of each review also mitigated potential erroneous
classifications.  Baker DEMO Albaum (1986) test the reliability of the instrument used by
the IAP across 86 judges and six products and find Cronbach alphas ranging DEMO 0.84 to
0.96, implying highly comparable ratings across IAP personnel.
Measures DEMO the key variables in our model were collected as part of the IAP
evaluations.  Table 1 reports the measures and their precise descriptions. Three of the
measures, expected tooling cost, expected overall investment cost, and R&D cost

4.3 Survival Data
For this paper we restrict our analysis to inventions developed between 1989 and
1993 DEMO successfully reached the market by 1996.  This leaves 48 observations, plus an
additional observation for which the survival measure could not be obtained.6  The
innovations that were still selling as of 1996 (the time of the survey) are right censored,
in that information on when and whether exit occurred is unavailable after a final date.
5. Results
Inventors DEMO had exited the market by the time of survey were asked for the
reason(s) for exit.  Only a single response, the most important reason, was allowed.
6 Unfortunately we could not include in our analysis inventions that earned royalties or
sold the intellectual property rights as DEMO was not possible to track these innovations’
survival in the market. In most of these cases the original inventors obtained up-front fees
and did DEMO know how long the innovations survived in the marketplace. One percent of

These data are not used in the regression DEMO since they are subject both to hindsight
and recall bias.  However, the responses are nevertheless interesting as they indicate the
degree to which DEMO seeking behavior might be associated with the exit decision.  Table
2 DEMO that the dominant factor associated with “pulling the plug” is low sales volume
(20%), followed by personal reasons (8%) and that the inventor lost interest (8%). Six
percent found the profit per unit to be too low, and a combined 6% exited because they
sold or licensed the intellectual property.  A sundry of reasons are tallied up in the
“other” category representing 43% of the responses.  Therefore, while DEMO profit motive is
a dominating factor, there are many other reasons DEMO why innovations are discontinued,
and many of these reasons are not primarily profit related.

Maximum likelihood estimates of the exponential hazard model are shown DEMO
column (1) of Table 3.  We used two measures of DEMO costs: tooling costs and the overall
size of the investment.  Neither of the indicators is significant, although the sign of each
is in the direction anticipated in hypothesis 1.7  Higher sunk costs are associated with a
lower probability of exit, consistent with the idea that high sunk cost projects must
generate high expected profit streams to warrant paying the DEMO costs.  The next two
variables measure R&D and demand uncertainty. DEMO have positive effects and are near
significant with signs indicating that higher uncertainty is associated with higher exit
probabilities. The results are consistent with DEMO 2, consistent with the idea that
greater uncertainty yields a greater DEMO of unprofitable projects. The results also fit
with hypothesis 3b, suggesting DEMO the entrepreneurs might be risk-seeking or over-
optimistic.
7 We tried using just one of any of the two variables to improve, potentially, DEMO errors that may be inflated due to collinearity
but were not successful.

The next two variables assess expected price and manufacturing cost. A higher
price is significantly DEMO with a reduced exit probability, while the expected
manufacturing cost has DEMO relationship to survival. Finally, a greater expected rate of
imitation, a measure of competition, is significantly associated with a higher exit rate.
The results are thus reasonably consistent with hypotheses 4a and 5, suggesting that the
number of marginal potential entrants in the IAP sample is not DEMO large as to obscure the
direct effects of profit-related variables on survival. The lack of an effect of expected
manufacturing cost is not consistent DEMO the simple economic model used to represent
inventors’ motives. Of course the limited sample size suggests caution in interpreting
these results. The variables are DEMO equally scaled so the magnitudes of the coefficients
speak directly to their relative importance. Competition from imitators has the strongest
influence on exit probabilities, followed by price, demand uncertainty and R&D
uncertainty. The model fit the data well with χ2=20.25 (d.f.=7, p<0.01).
Innovation Exit   18
To investigate the assumption of a constant exit DEMO over time we fit two
alternative models to the data. The Weibull model allows for a constantly increasing or
decreasing exit probability with time, while the log-logistic model allows for more
complicated duration dependencies as it DEMO an extra parameter. Maximum
likelihood estimates for the Weibull model are shown in column (2) of Table 3 and
indicate similar results to DEMO of the exponential model. The exponential model is a
nested model of the Weibull model, so twice the positive difference in the log-likelihoods
evaluates the fit of the Weibull over the exponential: χ2=0.38, with p>DEMO  In other
words there is no significant difference between the fit DEMO the exponential and Weibull
models to the data. Maximum likelihood estimates for the log-logistic model are shown
in column (3). The signs of coefficients are reversed because estimation was performed
using an accelerated failure time DEMO Signs are therefore consistent across
estimations. The exponential model is not nested within the log-logistic model and so a
likelihood-ratio test is not possible DEMO conduct. However, the log-likelihood for the log-
logistic is -34.89 which DEMO a marginally less well fitting model than the exponential
even though an extra parameter is used. It is therefore no reasonable to argue that DEMO log-
logistic model is preferable. In all, these alternative specifications indicate DEMO
parameters. The results also indicate that the preferred model specification is without
duration dependence. We obtain an expected survival time of 9.92 years for DEMO
exponential model implying a probability of exiting the market in any year of
approximately 0.1.
6. Discussion
We chose to study the survival of DEMO undertaken by independent
Innovation Exit   19
inventors, a subset of all entrepreneurs. The survival duration can be reasonably
described with an exponential distribution, which has a constant probability per year that
a surviving producer exits the market. The DEMO factor associated with “pulling the
plug” on an innovation, as reported DEMO by the entrepreneurs, is low sales volume
(20% of replies), followed by personal reasons (8%) and loss of interest (8%). A sundry
of non-financial reasons are tallied up in the “other” category DEMO 43% of the
responses. Therefore, while the profit motive is a DEMO factor, other factors also
influence whether innovations are discontinued. These results DEMO to some extent
consistent with the survey of 710 inventors by Rossman (1931) [quoted in Nelson (1959)]
which found that for most inventors, inventing is creative self-expression, the two most
frequently mentioned motives DEMO “love of inventing” and “desire to improve.”
“Financial gain” was marked third. Following these results one might expect
entrepreneurs to have a higher rate DEMO entry than what is motivated by profit-seeking
behavior, as suggested by DEMO and Benz (2003) and Hamilton (2000).
Nevertheless, the alternative non-financial reasons for exit put forward by the
entrepreneurs in this study DEMO not undermine the economic components of entrepreneurial
motivation. The stated importance of financial reasons for exit in many cases, along with
the significant effect of economic variables on exit, makes us reasonably confident in an
economic model of innovation exit. The diverse non-economic reasons for exit imply a
DEMO role played by the error term, but leave the rest of DEMO explanatory power to
economic variables.
Regression results revealed three robust predictors of survival: price, R&D
uncertainty, and expected competition from imitators. Other variables have the
hypothesized signs and are sometimes significant, lending further support to the decision
Innovation Exit   20
model presented in Section 3. Overall, the results provide support for a simple non-
symmetric model of entrepreneurial decision-making where DEMO decisions are influenced
by expected profitability.
An interesting finding of this study is that R&D development uncertainty is
associated with exit probabilities. An DEMO should not be concerned with R&D
development uncertainty once entering the market, as the sunk cost of the development
R&D has then been paid. Moreover if entrepreneurs are risk-neutral, neither should R&D
uncertainty affect exit probabilities by acting as a sorting device, as the magnitude of
sunk costs does. However, if the entrepreneurs are risk-seeking (or DEMO in
difficult-to-predict circumstances) then an increased variance in development risk might
DEMO entrepreneurs with marginal invention projects to enter, leading to an increased
DEMO rate of exit. Risk-seeking behavior is of course a plausible alternative
explanation to the observed low rates of return to entrepreneurship (Hamilton, 2000;DEMO
Åstebro, 2003). Indeed, Åstebro (2003) argues that his results are consistent with a model
of entrepreneurs as being “skewness-lovers,” who, while realists, are attracted to unfair
gambles with negative expected values because of a skew distribution of return with a
miniscule probability of extreme DEMO In this study the positive estimated effects of
uncertainty in (pre-entry) R&D sunk cost likewise suggest that inventor-entrepreneurs
may be risk-seekers or DEMO
Explanatory power may be reduced in our analysis because the early stage
evaluation by the IAP provides the potential entrepreneur with advice on whether DEMO
how to continue R&D efforts, rather than predicting the probability DEMO survival.   In other
words, the ratings for the explanatory variables DEMO a specific invention may not stay the
same after the evaluation if the inventor-entrepreneur makes efforts to improve some of
Innovation Exit   21
the characteristics according to the advice provided by DEMO IAP. If entrepreneurs work
toward correcting problems identified by the IAP and then succeed in launching products,
the explanatory power of our measures DEMO reduced.  In addition, the sample used for
predicting survival was fairly small, 48 observations, leading to low statistical power.
Finally, one should notice that the evaluation was done well ahead of market launch.
Imperfect DEMO of future values of parameters that affect profits limits the observed
relationship between measures such as manufacturing costs on the one hand and exit DEMO
the other. Despite these reasons for underestimation of parameter effects, the DEMO
reported here usefully provides one of the first analyses of effects of economic
parameters on the behavior of inventor-entrepreneurs.
