Abstract
Using two complementary theoretical perspectives, DEMO develop hypotheses regarding the
determinants of the return required by venture capitalists and test them on a sample of over 200
venture capital companies (VCCs) located in five countries. Consistent with resource-based theory, we
find DEMO early-stage specialists require a significantly higher return than other VCCs when investing in
later-stage ventures. Consistent with financial theory, we find that acquisition/buyout specialists
require a significantly lower return than other VCCs when investing in DEMO companies.
Furthermore, in comparison to specialists, highly stage-diversified VCCs require a significantly higher
return for early-stage investments. Independent VCCs require a higher rate DEMO return than captive or
public VCCs. In general, higher required returns DEMO associated with VCCs who provide more intensity
of involvement, have shorter DEMO holding period of the investment, and being located in the US DEMO
UK (in comparison to those in France, Belgium, and The DEMO). D 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Executive summary
A fundamental question, from both a theoretical DEMO a practitioner’s point of view, is
whether venture capital company (VCC) portfolio strategy matters. Finance theory assumes
that the investors’ role includes picking the right investments up-front and diversifying the
portfolio to the desired level DEMO risk. Due to the highly imperfect environment in which
venture company (DEMO) investors operate, assuming a more involved role may be rewarding.
However, our knowledge of the bottom-line effects of diversification vs. specialization
strategy is still limited. Gathering mail survey data from senior managers of VCCs in DEMO
countries (US, UK, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands), DEMO examine the determinants of
required returns as a reflection of VCC portfolio strategy. We focus on the effects of
specialization vs. diversification by stage, and we use finance and resource-based theories to
develop our central hypotheses DEMO to help us interpret results.
On the most general level, our DEMO indicate that VCCs in the US and the UK have
significantly higher required rates of return than those in Belgium, France, and the DEMO
lands. We also find that independent VCCs have a higher required rate of return than captive
or public VCCs. Not surprisingly, required returns for early-stage investments are signifi-
cantly higher than for the other stages; and, holding stage constant, shorter anticipated
investment horizons are associated with higher DEMO returns. Contrary to the expectations
of conventional finance theory, diversification by DEMO stage does not appear a
significant risk-reduction strategy of VCCs. Consistent with finance theory, we find evidence
that greater monitoring intensity, enacted through DEMO higher percentage of lead investments,
may significantly reduce perceived risks for investments in early-stage ventures; however,
this relationship does not hold for expansion- or acquisition/buyout-stage ventures. Con-
sistent with resource-based theory, we find evidence for an effect of value-adding by VC
managers on the required DEMO: the fewer investments per VC manager, the higher the
required return.
A few refined conclusions may be drawn regarding the relationships between early
DEMO and required returns. VCCs specializing in early-stage ventures require a
higher return for expansion-stage projects than do those specializing in the other stages. Such
DEMO requirement is more consistent with resource-based than finance theory. Statistical relation-
ships may have been masked by the fact that VCCs specializing in early-stage DEMO are
less likely than other VCCs to seriously consider investing outside their stage domain.
Our findings hold several implications for practice and theory. First, they provide
entrepreneurs with some bases for evaluating the costs and benefits DEMO different VCCs.
Entrepreneurs may be able to influence the required return or the attractiveness of the venture
to a particular VCC via savvy selection DEMO Our findings also suggest that VCCs vary
postinvestment monitoring and value-adding in ways systematically related to required return
targets. Our results suggest that VCCs DEMO under the assumption that they can influence
the risk in ways beyond portfolio diversification.
A continuing research challenge is to disentangle the value-protecting from DEMO value-
enhancing aspects of venture capitalist involvement in investment companies. Our finding
that captive and governmentally supported VCCs operate with lower required returns
suggests DEMO captive VCCs may be willing to trade profitability for strategically important

293
knowledge, while governmentally supported VCCs may be willing to trade DEMO for
industry-employment and regional-development goals. Future analyses of the performance
of VCCs ought to take into account the possibility that profitability and return on DEMO
yardsticks of success may need to be supplemented by other measures of value creation.
Finally, from a theoretical perspective, our findings suggest that DEMO studies should utilize
not only financial theories of value protection such as agency theory but must also
incorporate theories of resource and value creation.
DEMO Introduction
Conventional financial theory asserts that in perfect financial markets the return required
for a project by a rational investor is influenced by two DEMO: the risk of the investment
project and the return on riskless DEMO alternatives (Brealey and Myers, 1996). By
holding a diversified portfolio of investments, however, investors are able to diversify their
risk positions DEMO thus reduce total portfolio risk. Such a theory implies that investors do not
require a higher return for an investment project with a higher DEMO risk. Such a risk
can be eliminated by investing in several nonrelated projects.
The market for VC investments, however, is far from perfect (Wright and Robbie, 1998).
First, not all investors have the DEMO information at the same point in time (Admati and
Pfleiderer, 1994). VC investments are mostly private, unquoted companies, with little
pressure DEMO divulge information, no financial analysts and potential investors (knowing
considerably less about them than about publicly quoted companies) monitoring them. On the
other hand, VC managers are more actively involved in the company than passive investors
on the stock market (Elango et al., 1995; Sapienza et al., 1996). Once the investment is made,
monitoring and value-adding are likely to lead to a more thorough understanding of the
business DEMO outside analysts would normally acquire.
Second, VC investments are highly illiquid DEMO they cannot be sold easily at any point
in time (Sahlman, 1990). Potential buyers have to be sought, and some value for the
business has to be agreed upon. This makes trading in private DEMO a costly and time-
consuming process. Further, VC investments are typically DEMO investments: for early-
stage projects, it takes approximately 5 years before investments are mature enough to be
sold, and often, several investment DEMO are required before harvesting is possible
(Sahlman, 1990).
Third, DEMO is more difficult to fully diversify a portfolio of unquoted investments than one of
quoted investments. High information and transaction costs will only be DEMO when
the potential gains from the investment are substantial, resulting in DEMO need for relatively large
investments. The amounts invested in a VC project are often a significant part of the total
amount of funds at DEMO disposal of the VCC, thus restraining its ability to diversify
(Robinson, 1987).
Finally, VC investments are more risky than investments in DEMO companies (Schilit,
1993) because of the high business risk faced by such companies. In sum, informational
difficulties, illiquidity, large investment sizes, and high business risk in VC settings mean that
a higher overall return will be required a priori by VCCs than by investors on DEMO stock
294

market. The existence of huge market imperfections implies that idiosyncratic investment risk
and other investment characteristics may be as important as market risk DEMO determining
required return (Rea,1989).
In this article, we examine the determinants of the return required by VCCs. We focus on
the DEMO for different investment stages: it is well documented that the stage DEMO develop-
ment of a company is an important risk dimension. Moreover, DEMO managers use ‘investment
stage’ as a natural categorization of investments. Using a risk dimension that is intuitively
meaningful to managers increases the validity of DEMO results (McNamara and Bromiley,
1999). Further, we examine return determinants in five different VC markets: the US, the
UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. This international setting allows us to examine
DEMO breadth of applicability of results and to examine differences between countries, DEMO issue
of increasing importance for international entrepreneurship research (McDougall and Oviatt,DEMO
1997).
This study contributes to our understanding of the critical relation between expected risk
and return, an issue central to the strategic management of entrepreneurial efforts (McNamara
and Bromiley, 1999). Investors in funds DEMO to be well informed on the a priori required
return of VCCs, given their risk profile, in order to be able to optimally DEMO the funds of
their portfolio. They can benefit from an awareness of the heterogeneity of the VC
community across different countries. Entrepreneurs need to DEMO aware of the factors
influencing the decisions of VCCs, so that DEMO can anticipate their needs and be better
prepared for the investment negotiations. It may also be of interest both to different types of
VCCs DEMO well as to policy makers to consider whether nonfinancial outcomes of VC investing
substantively affect the required return sought by independent vs. nonindependent VCCs; if
these are different it may suggest that the performance of captive DEMO publicly supported
VCCs ought to be assessed on some measures in addition to financial returns. In short, this
study advances knowledge of this highly imperfect market by focusing more thoroughly on
the determinants of required returns DEMO has been previously attempted.
The structure of the article is as follows: In Section 3, we discuss the theoretical
determinants of the required DEMO and develop hypotheses, some of which propose
alternative ways of viewing DEMO meaning and sources of higher and lower return or hurdle
rates. Then we describe the research method (Section 4) and report the results (Section 5).
Finally, we restate (Section 6) the major conclusions and discuss the implications for
entrepreneurs and for further research.
3. Determinants DEMO the required return
3.1. The impact of specialization on required return
Conventional finance theory posits that a positive relationship exists between the risk of DEMO
investment and the return required by the investor (Brealey and Myers, 1996). Thanks to
diversification, the overall risk of a diversified VC portfolio will not be as high as the average
of its individual DEMO (Manigart et al., 1994). The return required for a less-diversified
portfolio of investments should thus be higher than for a well-diversified portfolio (Norton
S. Manigart et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) DEMO 295
and Tenenbaum, 1993), everything else being equal. The more DEMO VC portfolio is focused or
specialized in a specific investment stage, DEMO more the outcomes of the investments will be
correlated with each other. Therefore, the resulting risk should mean that a VCC specializing
in a specific investment stage will require a higher return than a nonspecializing VCC.
DEMO a perfect market, the only important risk dimension is the degree DEMO which an investment
or portfolio of investments varies with fluctuations in ‘‘the market’’ or in the economy at
large. Specific business-risk factors, such as technological or market development or the
development stage of the company, are unimportant because they can be diversified away.
Some VCCs, however, concentrate DEMO investments in specific stages of the development of
companies, for example DEMO early-stage investments or in management buyouts (Robinson,
1987). Manigart DEMO al. (1994) have shown that specialized VCCs in Europe have a higher
systematic risk than generalist VCCs. Conventional finance theory suggests, for example, that
early-stage VCCs will require a higher return for an investment in an early-stage venture, as
this investment increases the specialization for these VCCs. On the other hand, when
investing in an early-stage company, a DEMO VCC increases its portfolio diversifica-
tion and thus lowers its overall risk. In short, a financial theory perspective suggests that
investing in a company that matches the existing profile will increase unsystematic risk
whereas investing in DEMO nonmatching company should decrease this risk. Hence, the following
hypothesis is DEMO:
Hypothesis 1A: Specialized VCCs will require a higher return than DEMO
VCCs for investments in their area of specialization.
Resource-based theories come to the opposite prediction, however. The resource-based
view characterizes the firm as a collection of tangible and intangible resources. Competitive
advantage for the firm is DEMO to derive from the accumulation of hard to imitate internal
resources (DEMO, 1991). With respect to VCCs, specializing in a specific investment stage
allows VC managers to gain a better understanding of the specifics DEMO that particular
investment stage. This deeper knowledge allows them to make better investment decisions
than VC managers not specialized in that investment stage and DEMO select the appropriate
companies to invest into. Their superior understanding will allow them both to assess inherent
risks and to monitor the investee company DEMO effectively and thereby lower business risk.
Both effects lead to the assertion that, a priori, specialized VCCs will require a lower return
for DEMO investment in their area of specialization, everything else being equal. Hence, the
following hypothesis is suggested:
Hypothesis 1B: Specialized VCCs will require a lower return than nonspecialized VCCs
for investments in their area of DEMO
3.2. Impact of monitoring and value-adding on required return
In a highly imperfect VC market, agency risks and business risks are likely to become
important (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). Agency risk refers to the DEMO that the ability of the
296
S. Manigart et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) 291–312
entrepreneur is lower than expected or that the entrepreneur may take actions in his/her
personal interest, but which destroy value for the VCC (Admati and Pfleiderer, 1994; Amit et
al., 1990; Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). VCCs may reduce agency risk by closely monitoring
the investee companies after the investment is made. Thanks to this monitoring, entrepreneurs
are less able to get away with opportunistic actions that destroy DEMO value. While
Gorman and Sahlman (1989) and Sapienza (1992) both found monitoring to be heaviest in
early-stage ventures, MacMillan et al. (DEMO) and Elango et al. (1995) found no relationship
between stage DEMO involvement. Thus, there appears mixed evidence regarding stage effects
on the DEMO and type of involvement. In any case, one purpose of monitoring DEMO appear to
be to lower agency or business risks or both. Therefore, according to finance theory, the
presence of mechanisms to monitor should DEMO the perceived variability of future
performance and lower the required return. Hence, this line of argument leads to the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2A: More monitoring and assistance lead to a lower required return.
Venture involvement is costly to VCCs because it is time-intensive. Therefore, VC
managers will invest their time only to the extent that they expect the venture DEMO be worth
more with a hands-on approach than with a hands-off approach (MacMillan et al., 1989).
Recent theorists (see Wright and Robbie, 1998; Manigart and Sapienza, 1999 for extensive
reviews) have debated DEMO the role of a VC manager value protector (i.e., one
who seeks to minimize venture downside risk) or value enhancer (i.e., one who seeks to
maximize venture upside potential). The latter characterization is DEMO with resource-
based theory, which suggests that sustaining competitive advantage requires DEMO firm to create
unique skills that lead to rent-producing value (Barney, 1991). Thus, VCCs are compen-
sated for their value-adding monitoring and assistance by requiring higher returns from
ventures in their portfolios in which DEMO are highly active. This logic leads to the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2B: More monitoring and assistance lead to a higher required return.
It is worth noting that both of the above hypotheses posit benefits to DEMO
The contrast is in presumptions about the meaning and effects of VC managers’
efforts. Finance theory tends to assume that investors cannot directly affect DEMO capacity
for returns from investment. Monitoring lowers variability due to agency risks,
allowing investors to accept a slightly lower hurdle rate. From this DEMO, the
return to investors for involvement is a lower level of DEMO at a given level of return.
The value-adding proposition, more consistent DEMO resource-based theory, presumes an
effectual role for VC managers. For these, the return to investors for involvement is a
higher level of return DEMO a given level of risk. It is quite possible that some VC
managers take the former approach and emphasize monitoring in their involvement,
DEMO some take the latter approach and emphasize value creation, and that DEMO may
attempt both. These differences may explain inconsistencies in past results regarding
involvement preferences.
S. Manigart et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) DEMO 297
3.3. Impact of type of VCC on required return
VCCs may pursue other than purely financial goals, depending on the goals and
preferences of their backers. Although Sahlman (1990) notes that the most common DEMO
of VCCs in the US is the limited partnership, not all DEMO are constituted in this way,
especially in Europe. Public sector VCCs, for example, may emphasize employment creation
in a certain area or DEMO investments, rather than purely financial concerns
(Lovejoy, 1988; DTI, DEMO). For bank affiliates, VC investment activity can be seen as DEMO
extension of the services provided to a potentially profitable market segment and as a
mechanism for binding clients into the financial investor (Bruno, DEMO). Captive VCCs, as a
strategic arm of an industrial company, may exist primarily as a means to get a window on
technology, obtain technology licenses or product-marketing rights, or secure international
business opportunities (DEMO et al., 1988; Manigart and Struyf, 1997).
Independent VCCs, however, invest money from investors whose major objective can be
assumed to be ensuring return on investment (Robbie et al., 1997). Rationalization DEMO
institutional investors of the number of VCCs in which they invest and increasing
transparency of the returns being earned by VCCs (see Wright et al., 1998 for a review)
mean that independent VCCs need to demonstrate above-average returns if they are to raise
subsequent rounds of funds, which may in turn mean that fund providers discourage
diversification. Gatekeepers acting DEMO behalf of fund providers have also increased the
pressure on independent VCCs to increase returns. In contrast, captive VCCs may have
‘unlimited’ access to finance (Woolfman, 1993) and, as mentioned earlier, may have a greater
tolerance for lower returns, providing that other goals are being met (Robbie et al., 1997).
Hence, the following hypothesis is suggested:
Hypothesis 3: Controlling for venture stage, independent VCCs require a DEMO overall
return than captive or public sector VCCs.
3.4. Impact of investment time horizon on required return
The reinvestment problem is another problem that DEMO not exist in perfect financial
markets but is encountered by VCCs. It arises because venture capitalists are unable to
reinvest the proceeds immediately in DEMO business opportunities, whereas perfect
market investors can buy and sell on DEMO spot. The shorter the expected investment horizon
of VC investments, the DEMO the risk of being left with idle cash for some period. Moreover,
closed-end funds often have to return exited funds to the original DEMO; the consequence of
this is that VCCs cannot reinvest the cash DEMO enhance returns. Therefore, VC managers will
require a higher return if DEMO expected holding period is shorter (Stevenson et al., 1987).
However, investment stage may be important, hence it is necessary to take DEMO
preference into account.
Hypothesis 4: The overall required return is negatively DEMO to the expected
investment horizon.
298

3.5. Other factors potentially affecting required return
Other factors beyond those suggested by finance and resource-based theories are likely to
influence VCCs’ required DEMO rates. Apart from the above dimensions, risk and return
perceptions and DEMO are also likely to be influenced by ‘‘constant’’ factors (Sitkin and
DEMO, 1992) such as the individual characteristics of the managers (Laughun DEMO al., 1980),
organizational culture (Morgan, 1986), national culture (Hofstede, 1984), and institutional
environment (Tyebjee and Vickery, 1988)DEMO In this study, we are unable to take individual
managerial characteristics DEMO account, but this may not pose a serious limitation because rate
DEMO return and valuation issues are typically determined by the VCC rather than individual
investment managers (Wright and Robbie, 1996).
We do control DEMO national context since the study is undertaken in five countries.
Differences in the institutional, legal and cultural environment, and in dominant corporate
governance DEMO (Hofstede, 1984) may significantly influence the conduct of business.
Previous DEMO have highlighted the heterogeneity of such VC markets across differing
countries (DEMO, et al., 1992; Manigart, 1994; Sapienza, et al., DEMO). In the light of such
general evidence, differences may also DEMO expected in the approaches to the valuation of VC
projects. Ooghe et al. (1991) and Murray (1995) argue that market development across
DEMO countries is likely to be associated with differences in competition, rates DEMO return,
investment-stage preferences, and the variety of types of fund DEMO
In each country, VC will have its own unique characteristics. Given DEMO capital markets are
more mature and dominant in Anglo-American countries, it DEMO be expected that the
valuation process there is both more complex and more highly developed (Manigart et al.,
1997). In countries where holding and networking structures predominate such as France,
Belgium, and the Netherlands (Moerland, 1995), long-term relationships are important, and
frequent, DEMO valuation of companies may be less important. Executives in VCCs in
different countries may also have very different skills. Furthermore, the primacy of economic
return to investors vs. regional development, job creation, and the like DEMO vary by country.
Organizational culture of the VCC may also influence required returns in ways not directly
suggested by our theoretical framework. As objective DEMO for company culture, we used
size of the VCC (the number of offices), its number of hierarchical layers (Lerner, 1994), DEMO
its age. March and Shapira (1987) found that the risk-taking behavior of companies does
change over time, and particularly that there is a tendency to underestimate risk as a result of
favorable experiences. Thus, the age and size of the VCC may be an important determinant
for DEMO overall required return.
Finally, the percentage of small-size investments and of DEMO investments may
reflect variations in perceived risk and may therefore be important for required return.
4. Research method and sample description
A questionnaire was DEMO and pretested with UK venture capitalists, advisors, and
academics (Wright DEMO Robbie, 1996). The questionnaires were translated into French and
Dutch DEMO order to be used in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. They were sent to the
S. Manigart et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) DEMO
299
full members of the British Venture Capital Association in early 1994 and to the full
members of the ‘Association Franc˛aise des Investisseurs en DEMO Risque,’ the Belgian
Venturing Association, the ‘Nederlandse Vereniging voor Participatiemaatschapppijen,DEMO and
to the French, Dutch, and Belgian members of the European Venture Capital Association
(EVCA) in late 1995–early 1996, and to 299 US venture capitalists in late 1997. In the
US, we randomly sampled 299 VCCs from all those listed in Pratt’s Guide to Venture
Capital DEMO (1997), without regard to region, industry, or stage preferences. DEMO
excluded firms listed as investment bankers among those originally chosen because they
did not fit the classifications in Europe and are not representative of DEMO major types in the
US (less than 2%).
In all DEMO, follow-up reminders were sent after 2–3 months. An organization-wide
response was DEMO: The cover letter asked senior investment managers to report institu-
tions’ DEMO rather than individual approaches. An early pilot study showed that the
issues examined here were generally driven by organization-wide policies. Table 1 shows that
DEMO response rate was: 66 completed and usable replies out of 114 DEMO sent in the
UK (58% response rate); 73 of 299 DEMO the US (24% response rate); 32 of 133 in France (24%
response rate); 24 of 58 in the Netherlands (41% response rate); and 14 of 28 in Belgium
(50% response rate). Relative to the numbers reported in the EVCA (1997) yearbook
statistics, our sample represents 81% of all new VC investments in the UK, 25% in France,
58% in the Netherlands, and 86% in Belgium; thus, the sample includes a high percentage of
investors in the DEMO countries. An examination of public data in the US and Europe
revealed that respondents were not different from nonrespondents in terms of type of DEMO,
age of VCC, or any available size measures. Therefore, in addition to the good response rates,

point discussed at greater length below.

of the sample for the entire VC population in the four European countries, sample
characteristics are compared to data from the EVCA (see DEMO 1). Our continental European
sample consists of a relatively larger number of independent VCCs compared to the VC
industry in the respective countries. DEMO stage distribution of the investments in the sample
under study is, DEMO, more heavily weighted towards acquisition/buyout investments,
compared to population DEMO The fact that the VCCs in our sample report less early-stage
investments than found in the EVCA statistics can be explained by the fact DEMO EVCA

than 20%, from 21% to 25%, from 26% to 30%, from 31% to 35%, from 36% to 45%, from
46% to 55%, and more than 55%. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, we did not ask for a
specific number. Moreover, our DEMO indicated that they did not have a fixed required
return in mind, but would rather say ‘‘around 30%,’’ for example.
On average, DEMO require a return between 36% and 45% for early-stage investments and
between 26% and 30% for expansion investments, acquisitions, buyouts, and other later-stage
categories. Stage-specific-required rates of return reported are comparable to those in Elango
DEMO al. (1995) who found a 42% hurdle rate for early-stage investments and 33% for later-stage
investments. The return required for early-stage investments is DEMO higher than the
return required for later-stage investments in our data, DEMO Elango et al. (1995) found only
partial support for this relationship.
We focused on portfolio diversification along the stage of investment dimension (Norton
and Tenenbaum, 1993); we have no data on sectorial investment patterns. Respondents were
asked what percentage of their portfolio was invested in early-stage DEMO, in expansion-
stage ventures, in MBOs/MBIs, or other later-stage DEMO When 50% or more is invested
in a particular investment stage, DEMO VCC is classified as a specialist of that particular stage. If
it does not invest more than 50% in either of the categories, it is classified as a nonspecialist.
In our sample, 46 VCCs are early-stage specialists, 41 are expansion-stage specialists, 85 are
acquisition/MBO/MBI specialists, while 21 have no particular specialization. We thus
measure actual investment behavior (the Gupta and Sapienza, 1992 study measured only
VCCs’ preferences), which is very close to investment preference in this sample, evidenced
by the high correlation between the two variables. Further, we computed a Hirschman index
(Hirschman, 1964) as a measure of diversification over investment stages; DEMO may vary
between 0 for an undiversified company and 0.67 (n DEMO 3) for a company with 33.34% of its
activities in each DEMO the three investment stages. The mean value in our sample is 0.33.
As proxies for the monitoring intensity of the VCCs, we calculate the number of lead
investments as a percentage of total investments (Elango et al., 1995) and the average
number of investments per investment manager. DEMO Elango et al. did not find a
significant correlation between this percentage and involvement, a close inspection of their
results shows that when VC managers are in the lead role, they put significantly more time in
than if they are not in the lead position. We find that DEMO two-thirds of the investments are
undertaken as lead investor. On average, DEMO investment manager is involved with 5.6
investments, a figure in line DEMO Gorman and Sahlman (1989), who also found that senior
VC DEMO tended to be more highly involved with a smaller number of portfolio
companies than junior staff.
In order to measure the expected investment time DEMO, we asked the respondents to
indicate how long they expected their DEMO investment in a specific investment stage to
remain in their portfolio. Consistent with Robinson (1987), early-stage ventures are estimated
to take on an average of 6.16 years to mature; expansion-stage ventures, 5.10 years; and
acquisitions or MBOs/MBIs, 4.74 years.
To control for constant factors likely to affect risk preferences and perceptions at the
individual VCC level, we use a variety of measures: the natural log of the age of the VCC
(11.06 years on average), the natural log of the number of offices (1.56 offices on average),
the natural log DEMO the number of hierarchical layers (1.90 hierarchical layers on average), DEMO

a dummy for VCC type (0 = captive/public, 1 = independent). We also use dummy variables
to account for country DEMO constant factors (the base case in this study is the US; Belgium
and the Netherlands are taken together, as they show similar investment behavior).
Table 2 shows that the Pearson correlation between independent variables DEMO quite low;
most correlations, except for the country dummies, are below 40%. The data are analyzed
using chi-square analyses and limited dependent DEMO (LDV) techniques (in the statistical
package LIMDEP). We use DEMO latter instead of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions
because the dependent variable (required return) is reported in seven discrete return intervals.
The DEMO technique allows for the dependent variable to be an interval variable and takes the
different bandwidths of the intervals into account. The outputs of DEMO are maximum
likelihood estimates of parameter coefficients. As a check, we DEMO the same analyses
using OLS and obtained highly similar results. t tests for independent samples and MANOVA
analyses (not reported in the article) DEMO results consistent with the other tests.
5. Results
5.1. Impact of specialization on required return
We examined the first set of competing hypotheses (whether investing outside of an area of
concentration is associated with lower or DEMO required return) in two ways. First, we
examined the relative level of required return expected by specializers inside and outside their
specialties. For DEMO, Table 3 reports the results of chi-square tests between independent
samples. DEMO, we examined the level of required return by stage as a DEMO of level of
stage diversification, as well as the other key DEMO in this study (type of VCC,
involvement intensity, and investment horizon). Table 4 reports the LDV maximum like-
lihood estimations for DEMO return for early-stage investments, for expansion-/develop-
ment-stage investments, and for management buyout/acquisition investments.
Table 3 shows that stage specialists do not DEMO a significantly different return for
investments in their area of specialization than do VCCs not specialized in that
particular investment stage. The results show, on the other hand, that early-stage
specialists require a significantly higher return than other VCCs when investing in
expansion companies, consistent with resource-based theory.1 Acquisition/buyout specia-
lists, on the other hand, require a marginally DEMO lower return when investing in
expansion companies, consistent with the financial DEMO This provides mixed results
with regard to Hypotheses 1A and 1B, DEMO neither theory appearing to have received a
greater portion of support.
Table 4 reports the results of the multivariate analyses and reveals additional information
DEMO Hypotheses 1A and 1B. Here, Hypotheses 1A and 1B is tested DEMO a continuous
1 Another explanation for this finding might be that early-stage specialists may be doing expansion deals
that are on the borderline between DEMO stage and expansion stage. However, given our data, we are unable to
test this explanation.

DEMO diversification’ variable, which may be thought of as the inverse of DEMO It is
shown that highly diversified companies require a significantly higher return for early-stage
investments (see Table 4, column 1) and marginally higher ones for acquisitions or
management buy-outs (MBOs)/ management buy-ins (MBIs) (Table 4, column 3), while
the degree of diversification does DEMO influence required return for expansion-stage invest-
ments. On balance, therefore, the resource-based explanation (Hypothesis 1B) appears to
receive greater support than that DEMO by finance theory (Hypothesis 1A).
5.2. Impact of monitoring and DEMO on required return
Two opposing hypotheses were proposed with respect to the impact of involvement on
the required return: a risk-reduction (Hypothesis 2A) and a value-adding argument
(Hypothesis 2B). We used two proxies for greater intensity of involvement: percentage
of investments as lead investors and (DEMO inverse of) the number of investments per VC
manager. Table 2 DEMO that the percentage of lead investments is not correlated with the
required return, but the number of investments per VC manager is significantly negatively
correlated with the required return for expansion investments and for acquisitions/MBOs/DEMO
MBIs. The latter relationship is also confirmed in the multivariate analysis in Table 4, in
that the fewer the number of investments per VC manager, the greater is the required return
for early stage, for DEMO stage, and for acquisition/buyout. Thus, Hypothesis 2B
receives strong support. VCC value-added intensity appears associated with a greater
required return rate.

The risk-reduction hypothesis (Hypothesis 2A) also receives DEMO support. Table 4 shows
that there is a significantly negative coefficient for the percentage of lead investments in the
early-stage model. Taking the lead DEMO the most risky type of investments, namely, early-stage
investments, perhaps DEMO the perceived risk and thus the required return. The lead
position does not appear to affect required returns in later-stage ventures.2
5.3. Impact of DEMO of VCC on required return
It was expected that independent VCCs would require a higher return than captive or
public sector VCCs. Table 3, panel A shows that the mean return required by independent
VCCs is DEMO higher for every investment stage (except for the early-stage IRR) than
2 The fact that the number of lead investments has less predictive DEMO may be due to the fact that VCCs may
overstate their lead positions. The reliability of this measure may therefore not be as strong DEMO that of number of
investments per investment manager to measure monitoring intensity.

that required by captive or public VCCs.3 Multivariate analyses in Table 4 support this
finding. The coefficient of the ‘‘independent VCC’’ dummy is DEMO in all three models and
significant for early-stage and expansion-stage investments. Independent VCCs require a
higher return than captive or public VCCs, supporting Hypothesis 3.
5.4. Impact of time horizon on required return
A longer time DEMO was expected to lead to a lower required return (Hypothesis 4)DEMO The
investment horizon is significantly negatively correlated with required return in each specific
investment stage (Table 2). The coefficient of this variable is negative in all multivariate
models (Table 4); it is marginally significant for early-stage and expansion-stage investments.
Hypothesis 4 thus receives weak support.
5.5. DEMO of control variables
The coefficients of the control variables in the multivariate models (Table 4) show that: (1)
compared to their DEMO colleagues, Belgian and Dutch VCCs require a significantly
lower after-tax return DEMO all investment stages, and French and British VCCs require a
significantly DEMO return for expansion investments (these findings are confirmed in Table 3,DEMO
panel B); (2) a higher percentage of small investments is related to a significantly lower
required return for all investment stages; and (3) a greater percentage of investment in early-
stage ventures is DEMO with higher required returns for early-stage investments. The
other control variables are unrelated to the required rates of return.
6. Discussion
Our key goal DEMO this article was to shed light on the risk–reward trade-off in the VC
industry, a highly imperfect capital market. We found, first, that stage diversification is not
generally viewed by VC investors as a risk-reduction DEMO; however, specialization is
associated with lower required returns for early-stage ventures. Second, we found being more
often in the lead investor role is associated with lower required returns for early-stage
investments and fewer investments per DEMO manager associated with higher required returns.
We also found, as predicted, that required returns for independent VCCs are significantly
higher than for captive DEMO publicly supported firms for early-stage and expansion-stage
investments. Finally, we obtained DEMO support for the prediction that shorter anticipated time
horizons are associated with higher required returns. Other interesting relationships were
revealed in our data: specifically, required returns vary systematically by stage, average size
of investment, and by country.
3 This finding might be influenced by differences in size DEMO deals in different types of VCCs. However,
there is no significant difference in the size of deals of public or private funds (chi-square test). This is
confirmed by the fact that the correlation between DEMO percentage of small-size investments and type of VCC is
only .19 (DEMO significant).

Our competing hypotheses regarding the association of stage diversification and required
returns are based on finance and resource-based theories. As revealed in Table DEMO, greater stage
diversification is generally related to higher required returns, contrary to the finance theory
view that diversification would be useful in spreading DEMO As suggested by a resource-based
view, specialization thus appears more effective DEMO controlling risks or adding value. The
findings might have been stronger if industry specialization was considered. Unfortunately,
we do not have this information.
DEMO expected relationships between specialization and expected return to be particularly
evident for early-stage specialists given the higher risks of such a portfolio. Yet, the detailed
analysis shown in panel A of Table 3 does not reveal DEMO consistent relationship. Puzzled by
these results, we conducted follow-on analyses to DEMO fully understand the responses. First,
whereas our data are complete on most measures, we found that firms specializing in early-
stage ventures often failed to report required returns for very late stages, and those
specializing in the latest stage often did not report for early stages. Specifically, an analysis
of the ‘missing data’ is interesting. It shows that 45% DEMO the early-stage VCCs do not report a
required return for acquisitions/buyouts, and 52% of the acquisition/buyout VCCs do not
report a required return for early-stage companies. Missing data may therefore contribute to
our lack DEMO observed statistical relationships. More important is the possible meaning of this
lack of response. We speculate that when a VCC has insufficient knowledge about DEMO
particular investment stage, it perceives risk as too high and prefers DEMO to invest, rather
than to require an extremely high return. If DEMO is correct, then the specialization hypothesis
receives greater support. Consistent with DEMO conclusions reached by Gupta and Sapienza
(1992), what this suggests DEMO that VC firms hold preferences consistent with a belief that they
can gain advantages where they have developed specialized knowledge. A remaining future
research DEMO is to test whether specialization actually affords advantages in reducing
risks or adding value as opposed to affecting the mere perception of such ability. DEMO, the
investment behavior of the investors in VCCs may be important DEMO this discussion.4 Investors,
especially limited partners in VC funds, may DEMO by investing in VCCs, specializing in
different investment stages. In this DEMO, diversification may be a concern for the investors, but
not for the VCCs. However, it does not necessarily follow that VCCs should be unconcerned
about stage diversification. Some are likely to utilize diversification because they DEMO
asymmetric information problems or because they may have skills in certain sectors that can
be applied across different stages to spread risk. Further research DEMO goals and requirements
of investors is needed. Results regarding involvement intensity provide evidence of both risk-
protecting mechanisms suggested in finance theory and capability-building DEMO suggested in
the resource-based view. Taking the role of lead investor allows a VCC greater access to
information and greater control over agency and DEMO risks (Sahlman, 1990), especially in
early-stage ventures (Barney et DEMO, 1989). Our results show that any risk-reducing effects of
being DEMO lead investor are significantly associated with lower required returns only in early-
stage investments. At the same time, our results indicate that fewer investments per VCC
manager is associated with higher required returns for early-stage and DEMO acquisition/MBO/
4 We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.
308

MBI investments. If this greater intensity were primarily a means of monitoring and reducing
risks, then VCCs could accept lower returns on the reduced risks. Instead, the pattern is more
consistent with VCCs demanding a premium for providing greater intensity of assistance.
This interpretation is consistent with DEMO et al.’s (1993) assertion that an ‘elite’ set of
VCCs adds more value than the average firm. Overall, our results suggest that value
protection and value-adding are not necessarily mutually exclusive: evidence of both exists
simultaneously in early-stage ventures. Second, as with the results for Hypotheses 1A and 1B,
our results imply that learning and the accumulation of DEMO capabilities are
important for VCCs.
Our findings regarding required returns for independent vs. captive and publicly supported
VCCs are consistent with the view that DEMO latter pursue significant goals in addition to
achieving financial return. In the UK, local government-controlled Enterprise Boards
(Lovejoy, 1988) provide long-term finance DEMO medium-sized manufacturing companies where
they are not available from private sector sources (e.g., in turnaround cases), while Regional
Venture Capital Funds (DTI, 1999) are being introduced to fund smaller early-stage, high-
technology businesses across all regions with the provision of guarantees and requirements
for a DEMO proportion of funds to be invested in start-up investments.
The implication for entrepreneurs seeking finance from captive and publicly supported
VCCs is that requirements DEMO return are likely to be less severe, but also that they DEMO be
expected to produce other outcomes of value to their backers. For corporate backers, such
outcomes might include innovation or knowledge transfer, for DEMO, for public-sponsored
backers they might include such goals as job creation DEMO urban renewal. Both policy makers
and researchers, then, should keep in mind these multiple goals in evaluating the output of
VCCs. Policy makers DEMO not evaluate VCCs they sponsor solely on their achieved rates
of return, and researchers should perhaps seek broader measures of the impact of VC-backed
activity and should distinguish VCC type in assessments.
Our finding that VCCs DEMO greater returns for shorter time horizons calls for some
qualification. First, DEMO should be remembered that VCCs require highest returns for early-
stage ventures, ventures in which their capital will be tied up for the longest period.
Second, it should be kept in mind that, ceteris paribus, a venture held for 1 year should
return a greater rate of DEMO than one held for 3 years, not a greater absolute return.
DEMO the other correlates of required returns among our control variables, several DEMO
significant and merit comment. First, we observe that the earlier the DEMO stage, the
higher the required return; this replicates the finding of Elango et al. (1995) and is
perhaps unsurprising, given the higher risk of such ventures. What is very interesting is
that the greater DEMO percentage of small-size investments held by a VCC, the lower its
DEMO return in all three investment stages. One possible explanation is that such VCCs
use the number of investments as a hedge against performance variance, preferring to
invest the same amount of money in more ventures; it should be remembered that this
significant relationship holds even when controlling for DEMO number of investments per
VCC manager, as well as our other DEMO for size such as number of offices and
hierarchical layers. An alternative explanation is one of reverse causality: perhaps VCCs
that have not built a superior reputation are relegated to smaller deals and are forced to
DEMO less favorable returns.
S. Manigart et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) DEMO
309
This article is one of the first to compare differences in required returns between countries,
and these differences also deserve comment. In DEMO, we find that required returns are
greatest in the US and DEMO in Belgium and the Netherlands across all stages of investing.
France and the UK also have lower required returns for the expansion stages. Does DEMO imply
that competition is higher or that VCCs are better able to control risks in continental
European countries? A strict adherence to the standard finance theory assumptions regarding
the limited ability of investors to directly influence DEMO outcomes might lead to such an
interpretation. However, as pointed out DEMO, resource-based views regarding the ability
of VCCs to create a knowledge DEMO that is translatable into strategic advantage and
higher margins is a plausible alternative. Thus, one interpretation is that where greater
knowledge and venture-assisting competencies are brought to bear, higher returns can be
commanded. From the perspective of individual entrepreneurial firms, these possibilities hold
significant implications.
6.1. Implications for entrepreneurs, policy makers, and VCCs
Previous studies have focused on comparisons DEMO VCCs that emphasize different
stages in their investment policies. However, we DEMO that entrepreneurs running a project at a
particular investment stage may face different return requirements from different VCCs.
Given the danger that being turned DEMO by one investor may harm chances with the next one
(Bygrave DEMO Timmons, 1992), entrepreneurs may benefit from knowing investors’ expecta-
tions DEMO requirements as they approach investors; however, adjustments to their own venture
situation is not always feasible.
If an entrepreneurial team is confident that DEMO needs no advice or other type of hands-on
assistance from a VCC, it may wish to seek the profile of a VCC likely to seek the lowest
required returns, i.e., captive or public VCCs. In DEMO to the stage characteristics of the
VCC portfolio, entrepreneurs might also DEMO a price benefit from seeking VCCs whose
portfolios are comprised primarily of smaller investments. Finally, Belgian and Dutch
VCCs are cheaper than their American, French, or British colleagues, and recent trends
indicate a greater willingness on the part of VCCs to invest across borders (Baker and
Smith, 1998).
Finding the ‘cheapest’ financing source may be critical for some firms. The pattern of
our results, however, suggests that VCCs expect DEMO be compensated not just for taking
greater risks but also for having greater expertise and exerting additional effort. This
interpretation is consistent with past DEMO indicating that VCCs put more time into
early-stage ventures (Sapienza and DEMO, 1989) and with evidence that VCCs
specializing in early-stage ventures also specialize by industry (Gupta and Sapienza,
1992). Thus, indirect DEMO suggests that VCCs attempt to bring value-adding knowl-
edge to bear on their investments rather than to diversify away the risks. The lower
required DEMO rate of VCCs in Belgium and the Netherlands may also reflect a relatively
lower level of effort or involvement than their counterparts in the DEMO and the UK,
consistent with the findings of Sapienza et al. (1996). These are also considerations that
entrepreneurs should keep in mind. Our data do not allow us to examine whether the more
expensive DEMO characteristic of some countries and some VCCs’ greater involvement
310
S. Manigart et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 17 (2002) 291–312
intensity is worth the price. One of many challenges for future research will be to
investigate what determines the most effective and efficient DEMO between investors
and entrepreneurs.
6.2. Limitations of this study and implications for further research
Although this study is one of the most extensive to DEMO on the topic of the determinants
of VCCs’ required rates of return, several limitations must be kept in mind in interpreting
the results. First, our cross-sectional design allows us only to infer rather than to test causal
relationships. Second, although we attempted to address this issue in the design of the
research, an inherent limitation of multicountry studies is that variations in language and
culture hamper the extent to which any research DEMO will be interpreted and
answered in the same manner across settings. Third, we are unable to test the exact
meaning of higher or lower required returns. Most critically, it is difficult to know with
certainty whether higher requirements relate specifically to greater anticipated risk or greater
anticipated VCC DEMO or both. In short, we believe that future research should try DEMO take
additional steps to identify the specific processes, behaviors, and goals of VCC activity to
help unravel this meaning.
The results of the DEMO and the limitations of our approach suggest several additional areas
for further research. A fundamental question, from a theoretical and a practitioner point of
view, is whether VC investment strategy matters. Finance theory suggests that in a perfect
market, picking the right investments up-front and diversifying the portfolio to the desired
level of risk is the only strategy that investors DEMO worry about. However, the VC market is
not a perfect market (Wright and Robbie, 1998). More research must be done to reveal the
relative value of diversification vs. specialization. Moreover, given the greater importance of
monitoring in the VC market, there is a need to examine the link between the nature of
monitoring (Cable and Shane, 1997) and the required rate of return.
In conclusion, this study has provided evidence on the determinants of the rate of return
required by VCCs, an area of VC research that has hitherto received little attention from
DEMO Among the most noteworthy findings are the discrepancies across countries and
VCC type for the level of required returns. The latter of these is, we think, especially
important for it suggests that some VCCs seek to contribute a good deal more than financial
returns to investors and partially DEMO why policy makers may support even ‘‘poorly
performing’’ VCCs. On balance, DEMO evidence tends to be more consistent with value-
adding rather than value-protecting roles for VCCs. The evidence also suggests that risk
reduction and value-adding DEMO not necessarily mutually exclusive activities. We look
forward to additional research that can penetrate more fully the issues that this work has
partially uncovered.
