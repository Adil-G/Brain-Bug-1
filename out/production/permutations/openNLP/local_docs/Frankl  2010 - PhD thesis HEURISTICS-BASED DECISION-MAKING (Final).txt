Abstract
In this dissertation, I study the use of tacit and explicit business heuristics in decision-
making in small DEMO medium Canadian businesses. I confirm the use of heuristics in business
decision- making, present some common business heuristics identified in the study, and DEMO
methods of making the application of heuristics more useful for better decision- making in
various business situations.
Although business decision-making has been a subject DEMO research in big corporations,
investigating decision-making using tacit and implicit business heuristics remains limited in
small and medium businesses. A method for organizing DEMO compiling various forms of
decision-making using these types of business heuristics can deliver significant benefits to small
and medium businesses.
I define a heuristic (sometimes referred to as rule of thumb) to be a description of an
informal or formal problem-solving process, not necessarily 100% reliable.
Some examples of business heuristics include "Apply 5 times sales for business
valuation," and "Ensure the client is given a meaningful and prompt response." DEMO first
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

heuristic contains enough information for a competent business executive DEMO make a business
decision; I call this first type of heuristic DEMO explicit business heuristic; the second heuristic
requires additional knowledge to make DEMO business decision; in particular, the decision-maker
needs to know what "DEMO meaningful and prompt response" entails in order to make the decision. DEMO
call this second type of heuristic a tacit business heuristic.
My research involved a group of Vancouver Island executives participating in an online
survey DEMO the use of heuristics in business decision-making. Two main conclusions resulting
from this research are that executives apply extensively various forms of business heuristics
DEMO solving business problems, and that the heuristics they use are both DEMO and explicit. A
review of heuristics scholarship and my 25-year business experience as a senior executive with
small and medium Canadian companies support these DEMO
I propose a set of what-how rules that can assist in converting tacit business heuristics
into explicit ones by expanding their information content. Finally, I recommend follow-up
research for the development of tacit knowledge transfer methods DEMO business heuristics.

Running head: HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
HEURISTICS BASED DECISION-MAKING IN SMALL
AND MEDIUM CANADIAN BUSINESSES
In this dissertation, I study the use of tacit and explicit business heuristics as a method for
better decision-making in small and medium DEMO businesses. I confirm the use of heuristics
in business decision- making, DEMO a list of common business heuristics identified in the study,
and propose methods of making the application of heuristics more useful for better DEMO
making in various business situations.
Chapter 1: Overview
The challenge small DEMO medium business executives face is that of making better
business decisions. Currently business executives make decisions using gut feel, common sense,
intuition, DEMO, and, often without knowing it, various forms of heuristics or DEMO of thumb
(Gigerenzer, 2007).
Over the past 25 years, DEMO a senior executive of several small and medium Canadian hi-
tech businesses, I noticed that the decision-making process I have applied was often based on
personal experience. Discussing this decision-making process with colleagues possessing similar
business DEMO confirms that most business executives I talked with rely on personal
experience when solving challenging business problems. Of course, I could not always share
with others, especially the competition, the specifics of the problems facing DEMO businesses.
Therefore, we were sharing solutions to common business situations like DEMO red tape,
tax matters, or external political and economical influences DEMO our businesses.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

There is no substitute for years of experience in DEMO human endeavour. However, tapping
into some of the principles and lessons DEMO from my personal experience as well as that of
my colleagues can result in useful methods for others to follow, especially for entrepreneurs
interested in building their own businesses. Therefore, a method for organizing and compiling
various forms of decision-making methods could deliver significant benefits by improving the
DEMO process of executives in small and medium businesses.
1.1
Heuristic, a DEMO
I introduce in this section definitions of heuristics, tacit and explicit DEMO, tacit and
explicit heuristics, and quantitative and qualitative heuristics.
I define a heuristic (sometimes referred as a rule of thumb) to be DEMO description of a
problem- solving process that is not necessarily 100% reliable.
In other words, heuristics are rules, not necessarily readily generalized and DEMO
necessarily always correct; they are practical principles with wide application, not necessarily
strictly accurate. Some heuristics communicate clear, concise, and understandable processes,DEMO
whereas others sound incomplete, fuzzy, and even incomprehensible because they assume
unspecified additional knowledge. Heuristics can nevertheless provide helpful decision-making
guidelines for business DEMO when problem-solving or decision-making, especially when
critical information is missing (Gigerenzer, 2008).
Following Polanyi, I define tacit knowledge as knowledge that DEMO cannot express
completely; hence, tacit knowledge is difficult to communicate. Polanyi wrote, "We know more
than we can tell" (Polanyi, 1967). For example, most of us can recognize a familiar face in a
crowd; however, if asked how we achieve this recognition, we would not be able to describe the
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
3
process in a clear way. Conversely, I define explicit knowledge as knowledge one can
communicate to another person completely with no DEMO of further interpretation.
Similar to the above definitions of tacit and explicit knowledge, I define tacit and explicit
business heuristics as follows:
- An explicit business heuristic is a clear, concise heuristic, understandable by DEMO
competent business executive. Explicit business heuristics involving quantitative data are called
quantitative business heuristics.
For example, the heuristic in the previous section ("Apply 5 times sales for business
valuation") contains enough information for a DEMO executive to make a decision; it is
therefore, an explicit business heuristic.
- A tacit business heuristic requires additional unspecified knowledge to carry DEMO out.
Tacit business heuristics often use qualitative information to convey their message. They are also
called qualitative business heuristics.
For example, "Ensure the DEMO is given a meaningful and prompt response," requires
knowing what "DEMO meaningful and prompt response" means.
Heuristic-based problem-solving methods are present extensively DEMO business, the
military, games (including sports), medicine, computer science, economics, statistics, arts,
academic research, engineering, history, rhetoric, law, agriculture, religion, politics, science,
fashion, education, psychology, and philosophy. (Not an exhaustive list).
For instance, in AI (Artificial Intelligence), a heuristic is a strategy for problem-solving
that uses DEMO to select what is hopefully the best solution. In the construction of scientific
theories, heuristics may take the form of rules-of-thumbs, procedures, or even research
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
methodologies.

1.2
Various Meaning of Heuristics
When examining the DEMO meanings of the word heuristics, I notice that heuristics
have often DEMO, even contradictory definitions in the present literature. To many people, the
meaning of the word heuristic varies depending on the situation to which DEMO applies it. For
example, a heuristic method is a trial-and-error-based problem-solving DEMO, applicable in
psychology (Duncker, 1945), mathematics (Pólya, 1957), astrophysics, (Zwicky_in_Wild, 1989),
and philosophy of science (Sebestik, 2007).
The most common definitions of heuristics (which do not mirror mine) contain the words
invention or discovery. Additional interpretations of heuristics include trial and error handling,
problem-solving, unstructured proof, incremental exploration, learning from experience,
comparison to previously recognized patterns, intelligent guesswork, speculative DEMO,
investigative discovery, conducive discovery, rules of thumb, algorithmic search, and even
common sense.
The ancient Greeks were the first to recognize DEMO of heuristics in decision-making.
Aristotle acknowledges that humans reason, and he DEMO the various forms this reasoning can
take (Aristotle, 2007). Furthermore, he realizes that not all reasoning must follow formal logic,
admitting for example that the value of experience is important when making decisions. DEMO,
Aristotle was probably the first philosopher to use heuristics as semi-formalized logic. Aristotle
applies the method of loci or topos (literally place, DEMO location) as a persuasion technique by
using it as a general DEMO source from which individual arguments may derive. Aristotle
discourages the use of topics that are based on faulty arguments.

1.3
Heuristics-Based Business Decision-Making
In this section, I discuss the use of heuristics in business decisions. The heuristics that
executives apply DEMO frequently based on their personal experience when they make business
decisions. Some of these heuristics can be straightforward and simple for people who understand
DEMO business jargon.
For example, when facing the prospect of a merger DEMO a venture capital investment
opportunity, "Apply 5 times sales for business valuation" is a straightforward business heuristic,
even if it may be valid in some situations and not in others. Sometime the business heuristic DEMO
rule of thumb can be more subtle. Certain rules of thumb do not contain clear information about
what or how to apply them; they presume that the person needing those rules of thumb possesses
the information DEMO to make the decision.
In another example, the rule of thumb DEMO states to, "apply a meaningful and prompt
response," is not clear, because the understanding of meaningful and prompt response can vary
with each person. One interpretation of meaningful and prompt response could be to, "call the
client right away, and confirm your call with an DEMO or letter to ensure the issue was resolved."
Whereas, for DEMO person, the same rule of thumb could mean to "call the client - within the
week," or to, "write a letter, as soon as you find some time for it."
Moreover, executives can seldom rely on peer support from inside their organization.
Indeed, it may be difficult for them to share with their managers or employees DEMO of the issues
their businesses are facing. Executives cannot discuss various matters with their senior staff
because it could affect their staff positively or DEMO; they cannot discuss those issues with
their colleagues from other companies DEMO competitive reasons. Their board members can give
them moral support and some form of mentorship, although, not enough to address the daily
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
6
predicaments they are facing. It is lonely at the DEMO What are they to do? Repeatedly they end-up
using their own DEMO and take their chances (Gigerenzer, 2007). Sometimes they are right,
sometimes not. These are hit and miss situations.
1.4
Statistical or DEMO Heuristics and their Limitations
In this section, I argue that decision-making DEMO solely on statistical or quantifiable
business heuristics can lead to faulty decisions because this form of decision often does not
consider the non-quantifiable elements DEMO to the decision process.
Indeed, early application of heuristics in business DEMO took the form of statistical or
quantitative analysis (Hinkle & Kuehn, 1966). Certainly, when facing quantifiable financial
problems, executives have at DEMO disposal a plethora of mathematical models, economic laws,
statistical formulas, algorithms (as specific computational procedures for numerical
manipulations), and various risk analysis tools to assist them with decision-making. However,
one cannot always DEMO business risk (Coleman, 2006). What are executives supposed to do
when the outcomes are not quantifiable?
Numerous decision-making theories, like Bernoulli's Expected Utility Theory (Bernoulli,
1738, translated 1954), Rank DEMO Expected Theory (Quiggin, 1991), and Prospect Theory
(Kahneman, 1979), use risk analysis reasoning of the form:
in which wi DEMO a decision weight and u(xi) is the utility of outcome DEMO
In the above formula, E(U) represents a model of the Expected Utility Theory decision-
making. This model considers that a decision is DEMO acceptance of an uncertain proposition,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
7
delivering probable benefits - hence expected utility. This probable DEMO is equal to the sum of
each possible result represented by the utility u(xi) of the outcomes, multiplied by the respective
weights DEMO of the decision, in terms of expected gains versus losses. These DEMO can relate to
both the event and to its outcome, particularly DEMO ambiguity is involved. The above generic
formula recognizes that people assign different weights to different events. For example, people
tend to overweight dramatic occurrences, and prefer gains to losses. These weights relate to the
event and its potential outcomes, particularly when the outcomes are ambiguous. However, in
DEMO, one often cannot compute decision weights.
Because of these informational constraints, some concrete applications of those theories
have been useful in psychology, economics, and finance; however, they strike me as meaningless
for most daily business-decisions. Often the daily challenges executives face originate from
dilemmas that need DEMO response, leaving little time for detailed analysis. Executives
frequently do not DEMO the time, the expertise, or the experts available when needed. These
conditions establish a need for the use of heuristics-based decision-making.
I am DEMO claiming here that quantitative analysis relying on quantifiable data is to be
disregarded. I argue that one should not use exclusively quantitative data when DEMO business
decisions. What are then those heuristics that may provide solutions to the pressing daily
business problems executives face?
I will illustrate heuristics-based DEMO with some examples using qualitative
business heuristics.
As the chief financial officer of a maritime services company (a shipyard serving fishing
fleets), I had to make capital investment decisions, mostly associated with new equipment or
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
8
facilities improvement. The company was often short of capital, therefore any new investment
needed to meet stringent criteria, one of which was a payback period of three years or less.
One investment opportunity DEMO in upgrading aging machine-shop equipment. The
machine shop supervisors found new lathes that met their needs and suggested that the company
purchase those machines. DEMO capital required was around $500,000.
Most heuristics applied to capital investments decisions of this kind are based on
straightforward calculations, usually applying a cost/benefit analysis. I informed the supervisors
of the company's rule DEMO capital investment and advised them to submit a business case,
with the help of the finance department, showing that this investment meets the required
cost/benefit criteria (Kotchen, 2010).
Taking into account various DEMO (like maintenance costs of the old equipment,
overtime, improved productivity) the business case developed by the machine shop supervisors
and the finance team showed that investing in the new equipment as compared to continuing
DEMO the use of the old equipment had the same financial consequences. This meant that, if I
applied the standard cost/benefit rules, I DEMO not justify this capital investment.
However, I had to consider other DEMO heuristics, like, "Listen to your employees,"
"Insure employees' opinions are considered," and "Maintain high employee morale." These
heuristics DEMO qualitative; they did not provide reliable quantifiable data. These qualitative
heuristics DEMO the decision-maker needs to looks beyond the numbers, goes beyond formal
DEMO, and applies a different set of decision criteria based on unquantifiable DEMO that
may apparently contradict the payback period rule. Believing that the acquisition of new
equipment was an important motivational element for the machine shop DEMO, I decided to
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
9
apply the 'unreliable' qualitative heuristics instead of the DEMO 'reliable' quantitative one. The
company acquired the new equipment.
The results were surprising to me. The payback period was half of the originally
DEMO one. Indeed, the machinists were so enthusiastic in using the new DEMO that their
performance level was much higher than the one they predicted, resulting in increased
productivity, work output, and revenue growth.
Beyond the immediate cost/benefits resulting from the decision to acquire the new
equipment, the machinists could now work on new products that were inaccessible to DEMO
before. One example was the production of a Shaft Brush Assembly that could be used as an
alternative conduit for electricity in ships, reducing the electrolysis damage on the shaft (an
expensive piece of equipment) DEMO complementing the role the sacrificial anodes (zinc)
protecting the ship'DEMO metal frame. [Explanatory note: different metals in a conductive liquid, like
seawater, create a type of battery. The resulting current removes metal from one of the metal
pieces (electrolysis). The piece to protect is the propeller and the shaft it is attached to.]
When including the DEMO product line, the productivity, the reduced maintenance
costs, the new DEMO expenditure was recovered within a year of purchase.
On another occasion, DEMO had to face an irate customer with a legitimate complaint about a
deficient product - a non-performing polyurethane hydraulic seal. The production demand was
DEMO (tens of thousands of pneumatic seals per month), and the DEMO of failure were
important because if the pneumatic equipment using this kind of seals was leaking, the
equipment was unusable. I hesitated between two responses to a situation of this kind: a
defensive response (talk DEMO my lawyer) or a pro-active response (support the customer).
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
10
Applying the "customer is always right" heuristic could DEMO been considered risky,
because if this were the case, my DEMO risked a losing litigation. At first, I did not yet receive
DEMO information confirming or contradicting the customer's claim. I still preferred to give my
customer the benefit of the doubt. By avoiding a confrontation (talking to a lawyer) and opening
the door to a discussion (DEMO that the customer was right, and the product defective, which
proved to be the case later), I diffused a potentially dangerous situation DEMO our mutual advantage.
The customer had the opportunity to explain the problem, and brainstorm various solutions
(costly for the company but beneficial to DEMO customer), resulting with an acceptable solution: a
recall and a DEMO in manufacturing process. My company's credibility was reinforced, the
customer DEMO, and the manufacturing process improved. No amount of quantitative
information would DEMO given similar results.
Sometimes the available information can be fuzzy. As the president of a hi-tech
manufacturing company, I had to consider a number of merger or acquisition opportunities.
These were often potential avenues for growth. DEMO found these opportunities quite challenging. On
one hand, their appeal was DEMO because they implied important infusion of capital, something the
company was DEMO in need of; on the other hand, those offers implied loss of control, or
cultural change, with the transformation that would most DEMO follow.
My board would generally support my recommendations when an opportunity of this
kind arose. However, on one occasion, my partner and I DEMO on an acquisition opportunity.
My partner was 10 years older than I was; he was more eager to sell the company and retire than
I was. I was convinced that the interested party was not trustworthy DEMO on my experience with
previous medium manufacturing companies with, at their DEMO, an owner more interested in
short-term rather than long-term return on DEMO The heuristic I applied was, "When in
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
11
doubt, refuse the deal."
I confess that my partner followed the standard due diligence process to reduce my
doubts and DEMO me of the value of the acquisition for both the senior management and the
shareholders alike. I remained unconvinced and argued accordingly at the DEMO table. I was
overruled and agreed to leave the company with a suitable arrangement. Nine months later, the
company went bankrupt. I learned that the suitor arranged for a large order that did not
materialize. The DEMO was undercapitalized to meet the demand and the bank foreclosed.
The suitor bought the company in a fire sale at 20 cents on the DEMO I was right to refuse the
deal. Some board members acknowledged this to me later.
The following is another example in which the quantitative DEMO in decision-making
led to a faulty decision.
When Richard Feynman was investigating the shuttle's reliability following the Columbia
disaster in 1986, he noticed that the probability of a failure was estimated by management to be DEMO
in 100,000 but 1 in 100 by the engineers (Feynman, 2001). Instead of accepting the discrepancy
of those estimates as a DEMO of weakness, management preferred to rely on numbers; numbers
that, DEMO hindsight, made no sense. The estimate by management was wrong giving DEMO false sense
of security, and, therefore, supporting the decision to DEMO the shuttle.
In extreme conditions, when executives face major effects of DEMO decision-making
based on incomplete information, the application of formal logic and DEMO statistical probabilities
can lead to disastrous consequences.
1.5
Qualitative Heuristics as a Valid Decision-Making Alternative
Applying exclusively quantitative heuristics in decision-making can lead to DEMO
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
12
decisions; therefore, the use of qualitative heuristics can DEMO a valid alternative for heuristics-
based decision-making. When not enough information is available to make a business decision,
and when the executive needs DEMO make a decision anyway, using qualitative heuristics can
become an expedient DEMO for the decision-making process. Indeed, the executive deals with
incomplete information DEMO needs to fill in the void with a process that may lead to a workable
outcome. Under these circumstances, qualitative heuristics can assist in making fast and frugal
business decisions (Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Goldstein, DEMO).
In most business schools, teaching formal decision-making processes is currently DEMO
norm. For example, some business management schools describe decision analysis courses DEMO
"decision-oriented courses that focus on the frameworks, concepts, theories, and principles
needed to organize and use information to make informed business decisions." A closer analysis
of the courses' content reveals that those courses mostly cover operations management and
statistics. The formal decision-making process relies on quantitative DEMO, hence limiting the
decision-making process to the application of quantitative heuristics. DEMO am not advocating that
these kinds of courses are not useful in business management. Managers need to apply various
quantitative tools when they face DEMO problems - like financial opportunities that need
scrutiny, or operation gridlocks DEMO need resolution. However, most of these situations are
usually delegated to DEMO, like statisticians, accountants, operational, or financial
managers that have the time and required detailed analytical knowledge to study those kinds of
problems DEMO suggest appropriate solutions. Executives will then review the suggestions, consult
with DEMO managers, and ensure proper decisions are applied. These situations often do DEMO
require on the spot resolutions.
Charles Hinkle, emeritus faculty at the DEMO of Business, University of Colorado,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
13
argues that:
Value creation in the 20th century DEMO largely defined by the conversion of
heuristics to algorithms. It was about taking a fundamental understanding of a
‗mystery‘–a heuristic–and driving it to a DEMO, an algorithm–so that it could be
driven to huge scale and DEMO (Hinkle & Kuehn, 1966)
Dr. Roger Martin, Dean of DEMO School of Management (University of Toronto),
proposes the following definition for heuristics:"Heuristics are rules of thumb or sets of
guidelines for solving a mystery by organized exploration of the possibilities" (Martin, 2004). He
continues,
Heuristics do not guarantee success–they simply increase the DEMO of getting to a
successful outcome. They represent an incomplete understanding of a heretofore mystery.
Business people will have to become more like designers DEMO more ‗masters of heuristics‘
than ‗managers of algorithms‘. (Martin, 2004)
The above two references illustrate opposing views concerning the wide range of
DEMO interpretations in academia.
Even if the scientific research method takes for granted that one can arrive at valid
conclusions based on formal logic and DEMO testing, in daily business decision-making,
informal logic and use of DEMO heuristics can also lead to satisfactory results (Gigerenzer et
al., 2008) and (Kahneman, 1979). Understanding the importance of qualitative heuristics
becomes essential in decision-making because the business executive will need, at some point, to
face his stakeholders (employees, customers, vendors, and shareholders) DEMO explain or justify
the decisions made.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
14
Researchers like Herbert Simon and Gerd Gigerenzer have studied DEMO importance of
qualitative data as opposed to the use of quantitative data in decision-making. Simon introduced
the term Bounded Rationality with useful application in DEMO Simon states "boundedly
rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving DEMO problems and in processing
(receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) information" (Williamson, 1981). This theory
maintains that models of human-decision-making should DEMO on what individual humans know
and not on assumptions like the laws of probability. Simon stressed that "Because of the limits
on their [computers and the human brain included] computing speeds and power, intelligent
systems must use approximate methods to handle most tasks. Their rationality is bounded."
(Simon, 1990). These computing methods include recognizing elements of the circumstances
similar to those previously experienced, therefore reducing the need for additional information
search. Simon further advocates the use of heuristics for information search and DEMO needing to
stop search. Simon also suggests using simple rules for deciding how to use found information,
like the rule of syllogism in DEMO logic (Simon, 1990).
On the other hand, research by DEMO and his team at the Max Plank Institute for
Human Development shows that applying heuristics for problem-solving can lead to remarkably
accurate solutions (Gigerenzer et al., 2008).
In addition, new research in judgment and DEMO (JDM) shows that
unquantifiable elements like emotion and feelings also have an important influence in decision-
making (Slovic, Garling, Vastfjall, & DEMO, 2006). Emotions and feelings are also often at the
source DEMO qualitative heuristics.
Applying qualitative heuristics for business decisions comes with its caveat resulting
from unsubstantiated assumptions, groupthink, prejudice, or personal bias. On the other hand, as
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
15
one increases the use of business heuristics in making DEMO decisions, one also increases
one's experience, knowledge base, and DEMO level of using fast and frugal heuristics.
Ultimately, knowing what heuristic DEMO apply does not imply that a decision will take place. The
executive has the final say whether to apply the business heuristic or reject DEMO
1.6
Summary
In summary, business heuristics involve formal or informal application DEMO rules,
processes, and methods for problem-solving, a level of incompleteness or uncertainty, and
eventually, the discovery of a solution that is DEMO necessarily 100% reliable, but is a solution that
can nevertheless result DEMO positive business outcomes. Heuristics-based decision-making does not
need to follow formal logic. Heuristics can derive from the familiarity of the settings one
operates in, without any a priori, formal logical foundation.
I asked myself if Canadian business executives use regularly business heuristics when
making business decisions. I was DEMO what sort of heuristics executives use, and if used,
how DEMO one apply those business heuristics to improve the business decision-making process.
These questions formed the basis of my research.
The present state of research DEMO small and medium Canadian businesses (and by extension
- most small DEMO medium business) about heuristics-based decision-making is limited.
Systematic scientific research on DEMO topic remains scarce (Haldin-Herrgard, 2000) and
(Hancyk, 2003). DEMO present a detailed literature review in Chapter 3, Heuristics Scholarship.
1.7
DEMO Methodology and Summary Results
I present in this section an overview of my research methodology and a summary of the
research results. I describe DEMO research methodology in Chapter 5: Research Methodology, and
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
16
Study Design.
Relying on my business experience, I decided to use 10 business scenarios I encountered
in various situations, as examples in which business heuristics would have assisted me in making
a business DEMO Each scenario describes a situation that required a swift, usually immediate
DEMO These scenarios were used in a survey in which participants were asked to suggest
various heuristics-based solutions to the challenges the executive was facing. DEMO of the
survey results convincingly reflects the use of heuristics-based decision-making in small and
medium Canadian businesses.
Because my research focus was heuristics-based decision-making, my interest was
primarily in discovering whether business executives use explicit or DEMO heuristics when making
business decisions. My research questions are the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Are small and medium Canadian business executives using DEMO when making
business decisions?
Assuming a positive answer to the first question, what are the heuristics small and
medium Canadian business executives use when making business decisions?
When small and medium Canadian business executives DEMO heuristics when making
business decisions, do they use explicit business heuristics, tacit business heuristics,
or both?
How can one improve the DEMO process by using tacit business heuristics?
Preliminary pilot studies at the University of Victoria‘s Human Computer Interface Lab,
substantiate that business executives DEMO make decisions based on personal experience using
various heuristics. As an alternative to formally established rules, such personal experience may
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
17
also represent business knowledge acquired during their career. Building DEMO these results, I
developed a modest thesis research study composed of DEMO phases.
In the first phase, I describe 10 scenarios based on DEMO own business experience, requiring
business decision-making or business problem-solving using heuristics. DEMO the second phase,
I solicit a non-probabilistic group of Vancouver Island executives to suggest heuristics for each
scenario they feel comfortable addressing. I DEMO the result of the survey responses and
categorize the identified business heuristics in the third phase. I present my findings in the fourth
phase.
DEMO distinct groups participated in the study. The first group was composed of second-
year University of Victoria MBA students. Members of this group represented DEMO executives
with, presently, limited business experience; they served as a DEMO group.
The second group consisted of business mentors volunteering at the University of
Victoria‘s School of Business. Members of this group included seasoned business DEMO
who were at the peak of their career, or who retired.
DEMO third group represented executives, whose businesses were registered with either the
DEMO Victoria Chamber of Commerce or the Vancouver Island Advanced Technology Centre.
These executives managed small or medium hi-tech firms, or various small or medium business
firms on Vancouver Island.
Research results provide evidence that small and DEMO Canadian business executives
routinely use heuristics when making business decisions. Data obtained from the online surveys
includes 2,465 statements out of which 2,DEMO (98.1%) were either explicit or tacit heuristics;
only 46 (DEMO) contained various comments not considered heuristics. Indeed, all the businesses
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
18
executives participating in the research applied various forms of DEMO when suggesting
solutions to business problems, providing evidence that the use DEMO in decision-making is
prevalent in that population.
My extensive business experience also supports these findings. Furthermore, a review of
heuristics scholarship in Chapter 3, indirectly corroborates those results for big business.
Once the various heuristics were consolidated by eliminating repetitions, I developed and
applied a set of criteria to distinguish explicit versus tacit heuristics. Using these criteria, I
extrapolated 432 explicit or tacit heuristics from the available residual data. A subdivision of DEMO
explicit heuristics category consists of N=278 (or 64%), with a DEMO subdivision of the tacit
heuristics category of N=157 (or 36%). DEMO statistical analysis establishes the ratio between
explicit and tacit heuristics to about 60% to 40%. This strongly supports the statement that tacit
and explicit DEMO are both commonly used when making business decisions.
I propose a set of what-how rules that facilitate the conversion of tacit business heuristics
into DEMO ones.
1.8
Future Research
If a better heuristics-based decision-making process is a competitive asset for small and
medium business, as several recent studies claim, (Levin & Cross, 2004), (Butler, Le Grice, &
Reed, 2006), and (Strassmann, 2006), then a method for organizing various forms of this asset
can deliver significant benefits to those DEMO .
A useful follow-up study could address the use of heuristics as a knowledge-transfer
mechanism in small and medium Canadian businesses. Indeed, similar to the apprenticeship
process used in various trades, a better understanding of heuristics as a business apprenticeship
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
19
tool would be an interesting topic to pursue. An DEMO study to the above could consist in
determining the types of errors in judgment some small and medium business executives make.
Helping to avoid DEMO errors would further improve the heuristics-based decision-making
process.

HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Chapter 2: Background and Self-Anthropology
20
In this chapter, DEMO describe my background, because this narrative portrays relevant
information to the DEMO regarding the source for the research scenarios and the
interpretation of the research results.
2.1
The Researcher’s Experience: a Self-anthropology
The business knowledge of an executive is that person‘s expertise and skill acquired
through experience or DEMO By definition, an autobiography is a biography in a form of DEMO
story of oneself written by oneself. In the context of this dissertation, I believe that my 30-year
experience as a senior executive in several small and medium Canadian businesses (SMCB)
represents a valuable example of what I have learned, and shared with others.
Usually an autobiography follows a chronological sequence, describing a series of events
over time. For the purpose of this research, my autobiography covers specific nodal moments
that occurred during my various business experiences. Each period is not necessary linked to DEMO
following one in a logical way other than by time: I DEMO events in chronological order,
without any regard to why they occurred in such a way.
2.2
The Early Years
I was born in DEMO, Croatia (former Yugoslavia), on the last day of the year WWII
ended. Two years later, my parents, (and I) moved DEMO Israel. In Israel, I attended international
private schools (K-12) where DEMO learned French, English, and Hebrew. At home, we spoke Serbo-
DEMO and German. From an early age, I became fluent in those DEMO Following the
advice of my high-school philosophy teacher, I enrolled in DEMO University of Jerusalem to study
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
21
Mathematics, Philosophy, and Theology. Those topics introduced me DEMO various ways of
applying heuristics in problem-solving. My Dominican and Jesuits teachers installed in me a
sense of curiosity and analysis, which contributed to expand my views during my philosophy,
mathematics, and logic studies. Wanting to understand better my roots, I decided to continue my
undergraduate studies in Yugoslavia.
The private schooling experience taught me to be self-sufficient; hence moving to a
different country was not a deterrent, but rather an adventure. During the early 70s, Belgrade was
already an open and burgeoning European city. Yugoslavia was a good base for travelling across
Europe, and the economy was solid, with a large number of migrant workers contributing to the
country‘s economy. I enrolled in the Faculty of Mathematics, at the University of Belgrade. I
remember well some of my teachers at DEMO time, notably Professor Djuro Kurepa. He inspired my
passion for the DEMO of logic, a passion still present. I graduated with honours.
2.3
DEMO Formative Years
The first two years following immediately my undergraduate studies were those that
instilled my interest in teaching. During this period, I was a mathematics teacher at a technical
high school in Belgrade while continuing DEMO post-graduate research in mathematical logic
with professor Kurepa.
Not only did I enjoy teaching a subject that was difficult for my high school students, but
I also inspired them into applying to the classroom, some of their acquired technical knowledge
in electronics. They built, using the school‘s workshop, an interactive "clicker." Every student
desk was equipped with a multi-choice switch (5 choices), which was connected to a central
console on the teacher‘s table. This teaching method increased students‘ interaction between
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
22
themselves, and their engagement to the subject matter, DEMO learning took the form of a
game.
During this formative period, DEMO had to face the challenges of one form of knowledge
transfer: DEMO in the classroom. I also learned that modeling knowledge was possible by
converting rote learning into a game, and increasing in this way the interest of the learners in the
process. Later on, in my professional career, I used often this teaching model to convey to my
clients or employees, the importance of visualizing a problem to find solutions.
2.4
The Growing Years
Believing that my opportunities were limited in Yugoslavia, I moved to Canada in the
early 70s. Shortly after my arrival to DEMO, I started working as a credit manager for an
import/export DEMO The few months spent with that firm made me realize the challenges one
faces in business. I had to manage hundreds of business credit DEMO, some of which were
delinquent. Conveying the proper message to the DEMO customer was important: indeed, the
objective was to be paid without losing the customer‘s good will, and continuing the business
relationship. This was my first foray into the finance industry, not knowing that I will soon work
in this sector for the next 20 years.
A few DEMO year later, I joined IBM, where I learned not only about computer
technology (mainframes) but also about the North American business environment. DEMO first
five years with IBM were influential and prepared me well for what was to follow.
I was fortunate to experience three major learning DEMO with IBM: the technical phase,
consisting in learning about the DEMO, the systems engineering phase, consisting in
applying what I learned to IBM business clients, and the marketing and managerial phase,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
23
involving project management, and mainframe computers marketing and sales.
During the IBM technical phase, I was introduced to the technological challenges
mainframes faced in the mid-70s, and the importance of human-machine-interaction, a DEMO
challenge at that time. In the 70s,‗techies‘ were facing the challenge of explaining complex
technology features and benefits to businesspersons who had little DEMO no knowledge of computer
technology; the solution, converting technology‘s technical features into business benefits using
analogies. For example, implementing a computer-managed inventory using IVRS (Interactive
Voice Response System) for MEDIS (a major Quebec-based pharmaceutical distributor), would
not only keep track of inventory with fewer errors, but would also improve the re-ordering
process, reduce unused inventory items, DEMO, freeing working capital that could be directed
toward increasing sales or DEMO penetration. One needed to convert technology into a business
case, giving DEMO a quantitative interpretation that business managers could understand.
The IBM systems engineering phase involved planning the conversion of a major
financial institution‘s outdated terminal DEMO to an up-to-date, online banking system. As a
member of a DEMO of technical experts, I developed a comprehensive conversion process that
involved DEMO number of conversion teams, going from branch to branch, and converting the old
branch system to the new one. After the first few DEMO conversions, it became obvious
that something important was missing. Our limited DEMO of the branch banking operations
was affecting our project planning and implementation process. To remediate to this lack of
knowledge and experience, the IBM project team ended-up building in the lab, a full-scale
simulation of a bank branch. This lab bank branch was staffed with real bank branch DEMO
(tellers, accountants, and management), real terminals, real bank counters, and fake customers.
Using this technique, we were able to identify DEMO major deficiencies of our conversion process,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
24
modify our implementation strategy, and fan out a solid conversion method that worked out in
the field. The mentoring of our DEMO by the branch manager was valuable in the process.
I was ready to assume more responsibilities, and start to develop my experience in
marketing and management.
During the IBM marketing and management phase, my responsibilities included
converting a Burroughs banking customer, to IBM. This took a couple of years with a successful
outcome for IBM. This was also my most DEMO IBM period, as it involved inter-personal
relations instead of technical or DEMO challenges.
The saying was, at that time that IBM was a DEMO school for future executives. Indeed, I
had the opportunity to learn DEMO to acquire knowledge on a subject completely foreign to me
(computers DEMO a rarity at the time), and apply that knowledge in challenging business
environments – the financial industry.
2.5
The Professional Years
From IBM, I moved to the Movement Desjardins (Desjardins), a major financial
cooperative group in the province of Quebec. As a senior executive with Desjardins, I had
firsthand experience of a wide variety of financial challenges small DEMO medium businesses face.
The Desjardins period could also be divide intro three distinct phases: the professional
years, the management years, and the international years.
During the first couple of years at Desjardins, I faced a steep learning curve, entering the
corporate world, and its political challenges. DEMO a senior professional, my projects included
planning and implementing a network DEMO automated teller machines, and finalizing the
implementation of the banking network DEMO while with IBM. Considering that Desjardins was
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
25
a financial cooperative composed of 12 independent federations and DEMO than 1,500 branches
across the province of Quebec, one needed DEMO perfect the team approach, and adapt to a decision
by consensus DEMO, typical in a cooperative environment. Accepting a different decision-
making paradigm DEMO my first priority – a decision made by a group instead of an individual.
During this first phase, my most valuable lesson was that of patience. I was fortunate in finding a
mentor in the Desjardins DEMO general manager, who was well conversant with the
hurdles I was DEMO to face. The acquisition of a cooperative mentality was valuable later on,
when I took the responsibility of implementing a global financial lending DEMO plan in Latin
America.
The management years at Desjardins included the integration of Desjardins to the
Canadian banking system through the Canadian Payment Association (CPA). This involved
negotiations at the corporate, provincial, and federal DEMO, ending up with the integration of
Desjardins as a member of DEMO CPA. As a CPA member, Desjardins would no longer need to
DEMO a deposit in another bank to insure inter-financial institutional payment transfers. This also
meant important savings for Desjardins, because the need for a multimillion-dollar daily float
(money not earning interest) in another bank was eliminated.
DEMO major lessons learned from this experience consisted in understanding better the
political motivations involved in finding win-win solutions in a highly competitive marketplace.
The DEMO sitting on the CPA committee were competitors and had to work together to
make the flow of money work efficiently.
While with Desjardins, an opportunity arose to head an international project in Latin
America, sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) involving the
COLAC cooperative movement (Confederacion Latinoamericana de Coopertivas de Ahorro y
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
26
Credito), the Lain American Confederation of Savings and DEMO Cooperatives.
I went through a culture shock: that of the Latin DEMO way of life, compared to the
North American one. Indeed, the legal, and national financial infrastructures we are used to
count on in Canada, (like the Canada Bank Act, the Bank of Canada, DEMO Canadian Payment
Association, the Canadian Banking Association, for example) were DEMO in Latin American
countries. Covering 19 countries out of Panama City (DEMO), visiting local federations in some
countries, meeting with various levels DEMO government, and understanding the expectations from
the international cooperative movement, were some of the challenges that needed to be faced.
Here the gift DEMO patience acquired in Quebec came in handy, because the Latin American DEMO
(as opposed to our North American one) has a different sense of urgency – time becomes an ally
instead of a constraint.
2.6
DEMO Management-Consulting Years
On my return from Panama City to Montreal, I DEMO ready to enter the world of
consulting. I wanted to share the experience gained in those first 10 years in business with
companies needing DEMO as they grew or struggled to survive.
My first foray into management consulting was with Peat Marwick (today KPMG),
among the largest DEMO services firms in the world at the time. As a senior consultant, I
was called often to assist companies facing some sort of financial distress. The projects involved
companies across Canada, the USA, and Haiti. DEMO most instances, I had to inform the company‘s
top management of DEMO seriousness of the difficulty there were in, the corrective measures that
DEMO needed to take, and to suggest various implementation plans that would DEMO them in
regaining their financial stability. Only one of my KPMG clients did not follow the proposed
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
27
recommendations. That client ended-up bankrupt a few months later.
DEMO after joining KPMG, an IBM colleague and friend, who joined a young Quebec-
based information technology consulting company (Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique -
CGI), gave me a call and suggested I join CGI, which I did a few months later. As a partner and
director DEMO consulting services with CGI, presently one of the biggest management-consulting
firms DEMO the world, I had the opportunity to work with a large DEMO of small, medium, and big
businesses, in the private and DEMO sectors. My clients came from a variety of market segments
(finance, distribution, and manufacturing). However, my specialty remained mainly in finance,DEMO
serving banks, trusts, stock exchanges, and insurance companies.
Working with DEMO executives in those companies taught me the importance of applying
strong listening skills, expressing clearly my findings (mostly in form of business
recommendations), and attention to detail. The detail consisted in ensuring that the conveyed
message was not only understood, but was also understood the way it was supposed to be,
instead of becoming a modified interpretation by DEMO listener.
A few vignettes hereafter, illustrate the activities during the CGI DEMO Because of
customer confidentiality, customer names and assignment specifics are not DEMO
The challenge a stock exchange client was facing, consisted in ensuring DEMO/7 process
availability, and minimizing the inevitable maintenance and breakdown time. DEMO provided, as a
model, the operations of the Visa department of a local bank. Visiting those operations during
off-peak and peak hours, understanding the logistics required to ensure 24/7 service availability,
was a DEMO to the stock exchange client. This resulted in an acquisition of additional
computing equipment, and a business process re-engineering contract of the existing information
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
28
technology procedures.
A problem faced by an insurance company DEMO in checking that the life insurance
forms, completed by the field DEMO, were free of errors, before submitting them for approval to
the head office. Establishing a validation online link between the company agents‘ mobile DEMO
(laptops in this case), and head office, was the solution – borrowed from the travel agency
industry, which had similar requirements. This was achieved long before the Internet era, using
dial-up communication technology and private networks.
In several instances, once the strategic plan was accepted by senior management, I
remained as a support resource to senior and middle level management, assisting them in
converting the strategic plan (what needs DEMO be done) into a tactical one (how to do it), and
finally into an operational one (doing it).
During the early 90s, I headed a CGI branch operation in Victoria, British Columbia,DEMO
where I faced the challenges of dealing with the provincial government and its complex decision-
making infrastructure. This was an opportunity to be acquainted DEMO the politically motivated
New Democratic Party's (NDP) decision-making process.
One of the most satisfying projects of this period consisted in developing a DEMO
and telecommunications strategy plan for the three Canadian military colleges: The DEMO
Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, the Royal Roads Military College
(RRMC), in Victoria, British Columbia, and Collège Militaire Royal de Saint-Jean (CMR), in St.
Jean d‘Iberville, Quebec. DEMO and CM were closed a few years later because of government
cutbacks on defense spending. However, the technology infrastructure survived in the conversion
of RRMC into the Royal Roads University.

2.7
The Entrepreneurship Years
Instead of moving back East, I decided to leave CGI in the early 90s. This allowed me DEMO
form my own consulting firm, and apply the acquired experience to DEMO own business.
This section describes the period, during which I held DEMO positions of managing director
of Stellar Systems Group (SSG),- a consulting firm, president of VIC TEC Corporation (VTC) -
a high-tech manufacturing company, chief financial officer of Point Hope Shipyard (PHS) - a
ship construction and services company, and director of operations at University Canada West
(UCW), a private university.
The above companies had their headquarters in Victoria, with branches across British
Colombia, or other parts DEMO the world. Some of those companies have inspired the business
scenarios used in the research part of this study.
Stellar Systems Group (SSG)
Feeling too young to retire after leaving CGI, I was looking for some business challenges.
I was approached by the president of Stellar Systems DEMO (SSG) to head a floundering division
specialized in technology training. The requirement consisted in making the division profitable,
increasing its customer base, and diversifying its product line. This took a couple of years.
Diversifying DEMO customer base meant reversing the revenue stream from mainly
government customers to a balanced mix of public and private sector customers, expanding the
product base by developing some vertical training programs, (like Microsoft Certification), DEMO
an increase of the services rendered by opening branches in Vancouver, DEMO George,
Kelowna, and Nelson. SSG was sold to EDS, an American consulting company.

30
Scenario 4, (Move Decision), and Scenario 10, (Joint Venture), relate specifically to the
events I have encountered when leading SSG.
VIC TEC Corporation (VTC)
VTC was a new business venture capitalizing on the discovery of a revolutionary
material with remarkable qualities. DEMO product‘s trademark was COOLPAC™. This material
was composed of a unique blend of polyurethane and proprietary chemicals. Specialized
manufacturing methods gave it characteristics not DEMO in any other product of its kind. The
main application was in hydraulics; however, other applications were developed over time.
I could not DEMO the challenges this company offered, and accepted to become the
president DEMO VTC. My objectives were to raise venture capital, diversify the product DEMO, expand
the customer base, and improve the profitability of the failing start-up. I achieved the above
objectives over three years.
The main research DEMO development projects at VTC included the improved automation
of the manufacturing process, the expansion of the product line from hydraulics to pneumatics,
the negotiation of agency agreement in Europe (England, France, and Italy) DEMO the planning of a
new plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
I DEMO the company when it was about to be acquired by a US competitor, against my
advice. Shortly after my departure the company was indeed acquired by a US firm (Grover
Corporation, out of Milwaukee, WI), which dismantled the Saanich plant and moved it to the
US, closing the Canadian operations.
Study scenarios 1 (Company Valuation), 2 (DEMO Forecasts), 3 (Lawsuit), 7 (Project

encountered while with VTC.

Point Hope Shipyard (PHS)
After acquiring the company to avoid bankruptcy, the new management at PHS was in
dire need of fresh operating capital to meet the growing DEMO in marine services. The
company was ripe for injection of fresh capital, a reorganization of its operating practices, and
new negotiations with its DEMO workforce. The president invited me to assist him in
achieving those objectives. After reviewing the company‘s financial status, I accepted the
position of CFO with extended operational responsibilities.
My tenure with PHS was eventful, because not only was the union involved in PHS's
daily operations and had DEMO input on how business was managed, but also because of the
DEMO pains and large demands in resources (financial, technical, and human) PHS needed to
meet its growth target. I succeeded in stabilizing the DEMO financially, ensuring a regular
flow of work, and securing operating capital and cash flow based on its receivables.
Some of the eventful realizations DEMO PHS included debt renegotiations with lending
institutions, various levels of government, and the vendor community. A "pay-as-you-go"
customer payment policy insured steadier cash flow, and assisted in better cash management. I
left the company a few years later, following the delivery of a new pilot boat to Pacific Pilotage
Authority Canada.
Study scenarios 1 (company Valuation), 5 (Credit Line), 6 (Collective Agreement), and 7
(Project Slippage) reflect quandaries encountered at PHS.

University Canada West (UCW)
32
The launching of a new private university in Victoria revived my interest in teaching. I
joined DEMO faculty of UCW shortly after its creation, and enjoyed developing, and delivering
graduate and undergraduate courses to a growing student base. UCW‘s president DEMO me to
take on the responsibilities of operations while continuing to act as active faculty. I accepted, and
spent a few years with this institution as Director of Operations, until the Vancouver-based
Eminata group acquired it.
2.8
The Academic Adventure
Over the years, I continued to be highly interested in teaching. While with IBM, an
opportunity arose to teach computer science at University of Montreal‘s school of business
(Hautes Études Commerciales – H.E.C.). Soon after, the University of Sherbrooke, with a
growing DEMO base in the Information Technology department of the Faculty of Science,
invited me to teach in Sherbrooke. This gave me the chance to DEMO and deliver a number of
computer science and business courses. Since then, I have also developed and delivered a wide
range of computer science and business courses at the University of Victoria, Royal Roads
University, DEMO College, University of Phoenix, University Canada West, and Meritus
University.
DEMO 30 years of various business experiences, challenges and trepidations, I finally
decided to set aside time for myself, and focus on my on-going objective of lifelong learning.

Chapter 3: Heuristics Scholarship
In this chapter, I DEMO an overview of heuristics scholarship. I explore the diverse
definitions of heuristics used in a variety of human endeavours. I examine various definitions of
DEMO terms heuristic and heuristics in literature, online and print dictionaries. I DEMO heuristic
categories. I suggest a business heuristics definition. Finally, I present DEMO summary overview of
heuristics application in politics, psychology, philosophy, law, economics, computer science,
education, the military, medicine, and business.
DEMO
Background
When reviewing various definitions of the word ‗heuristic‘ I discern a common
denominator that of discovery. Indeed heuristics have been used traditionally, rightly or wrongly,
as a method to discover solutions to a variety DEMO problems.
I present hereafter a brief overview of heuristics etymology.
Greek: DEMO, heuriskein - to discover, to find; see also ευρετήζ, heuretes – the one
who discovers; and ευρίσκω, heurísko, I find.
German: heuristisch - bezeichnet die Kunst, mit begrenztem Wissen und wenig Zeit DEMO
guten Lösungen zu kommen; (the art to find good solutions with limited knowledge and little
time – translated by me)
French: heuristique, euristique - l'art d'inventer, de faire des découvertes (Littré); (the art
of inventing, of discovering – translated by me)DEMO
English: heuristics - proceeding by trial and error (Oxford)
Heuristics are used in the common language because they tend to follow a DEMO
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
34
argumentation process. This mode of argument, first described by Aristotle, became the
foundation of the Western logical thinking paradigm.
Considering that heuristics can either be unreliable, informal or both, and lead to DEMO or
invalid conclusions, one needs to be careful how one uses DEMO when making decisions.
Although heuristics may be useful, especially in circumstances DEMO can lead to a rapid solution,
which may be reasonably close to the best answer, applying a heuristic-based solving process
does not guarantee the validity of that solution.
I trace the use of heuristic-based reasoning DEMO the classic Greek rhetoricians. Aristotle
uses the words like invention to characterize the rhetorical process. The process of invention (in
the context of discovery) invites the rhetor (speaker) to explore alternative ideas that may lead to
an understanding of the subject matter or to a conclusive argument DEMO a topic discussed. The
process is similar to that followed when one applies heuristics in problem-solving. Invention is
complemented with arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.
Aristotle introduces Rhetoric as an art of using language for DEMO Rhetoric follows
three methods of logos (reason or rational discourse), DEMO (experience or story telling), and
ethos (moral competence), as well as the five canons of memory, invention, delivery, style, DEMO
arrangement. Along with grammar and logic or dialectic, rhetoric is one DEMO the three ancient arts
of discourse. Aristotle identifies two broad types of topics (topoi), or lines of reasoning, as
effective persuasion categories. DEMO consist of 28 common topics applicable in any types of
discourse, DEMO special topics applicable in specific types of discourse, like political, judicial, or
ceremonial. (Braet, 2005)
Aristotle follows-up by analyzing the structures of rhetorical reasoning using the
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
35
enthymeme (from ‗enthumeisthai - to consider‘) and the DEMO Quoting Aristotle, "The
enthymeme is a sort of syllogism (sullogismos DEMO i.e. a deductive argument), and the consideration
of syllogisms of all kinds, without distinction, is the business of dialectic, either of dialectic as a
whole, or of one of its branches." (Aristotle, DEMO)
In other words, an enthymeme is a three-part deductive argument (syllogism) containing
an unstated assumption that must be true for the premises to lead to a valid conclusion. On the
other hand, the example takes usually the form of a long story, or that of a complex case, leading
to a probable but not certain conclusion.
This process is similar to the one used when applying heuristics to solve a DEMO: one
starts by stating the problem, followed by suggesting a heuristic that may lead to a solution,
based on a form of DEMO Some of Aristotle‘s syllogisms can be considered as intuitive.
For example, DEMO Barbara syllogism states:
Every X is a Y.
Every Y is a Z.
Therefore, every X is a Z.
In "Rhetoric, Romance and Technology," Father Walter Ong argues that to find
something to DEMO, one needs to analyze various models, reminiscent of classical antiquity‘s
dialectic: develop a structure to explain the choice of a particular result (DEMO, 1971). Heuristics,
in this context, provide supporting arguments to the decision-maker, hence justifying that
decision.

3.2
Heuristics use in Human Endeavours
Wide varieties of DEMO endeavours use heuristics for problem-solving. The most
common include business, military, games (including sports), medicine, computer science,
economics, statistics, DEMO arts, academic research, engineering, history, rhetoric, law, agriculture,
religion, politics, science, fashion, education, psychology, and philosophy.
I DEMO hereafter some prevalent categories of human endeavors applying a heuristics-
based decision-making process. These are summarized in figure 1.
Figure 1. Human endeavors using DEMO
In politics, for example, the poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between cognitive
and rational theories of decision-making. PH uses a two-stage DEMO process. The first stage
consists in reducing the set of possible options by applying a ‗non-compensatory principle.‘ This
eliminates any alternative with an unacceptable DEMO During the second stage, the decision
maker uses analytic processing in DEMO attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits (Mintz,
2004).
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
37
In psychology, heuristics are simple, efficient rules, proposed as an explanation of how
humans make decisions, come to judgments, DEMO solve problems when facing complex problems
or incomplete information. These rules work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases
may lead to systematic cognitive biases (Sriram  & Greenwald, 2009).
In philosophy, a DEMO (or a heuristic device) is used when an entity exists to enable
understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity. For example, a model, never
identical with what it models, is a heuristic DEMO that can facilitate some understanding of what
it models. Stories and metaphors also can be termed heuristic devices in that sense. In his 1945
DEMO How to solve it, Polya suggested a series of heuristics, like "If you are having difficulty
understanding a problem, try drawing a DEMO,", or "Try assuming that you have a solution and
seeing what you can derive from that," a form of "working backward." (Pólya, 1957)
In economics, heuristics are used when case-by-case DEMO would be impractical, in
which practicality is defined by the interests DEMO a governing body (Gigerenzer et al., 2008).
In law, DEMO and Skalak suggest 12 categories of heuristics used to reason legal cases;
they include for example, various ways to begin reasoning, rule-based DEMO miss or near hit, or
sanity checks (Rissland, Skalak, & Friedman, 1994).
In computer science, a heuristic (or a heuristic algorithm) is a technique designed to
solve a problem that is not required to be 100% correct. However, the use of this technique
produces usually a good solution, or solves a simpler problem that contains, DEMO intersects with the
solution of complex problem. Heuristics may assist in gaining computational performance, or
produce conceptual simplicity, at the potential cost of DEMO or precision (Pearl, 2001).
In human-computer interaction (HCI), DEMO evaluation is a usability-testing
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
38
technique devised by expert usability consultants. In heuristic evaluation, some experts review
the user interface and its compliance to a number DEMO broadly stated characteristics of a good user
interface as defined by Jakob Nielsen (Nielsen, 1995).
In education, students approach concepts, ideas, and problems differently, according to
their backgrounds, experiences, and studies. For example, according to George Pólya, students
may use some of the DEMO heuristic problem-solving techniques, when faced with a
mathematical problem like diagrams, graphs, patterns, special case analysis, or trial and error
(Pólya, 1957).
Military operations often rely on past performance results building on DEMO military
planning practices (William, 2007).
In medicine, the ever-present "Primum non nocere" (First do no harm - a fundamental
medical DEMO of Hippocrates ca. 460-ca. 377 B.C.), is a telling example of the importance of
the application of heuristics. Gigerenzer confirmed the importance and DEMO of medical
heuristics in his analysis of heart disease predictive instrumentation. Presently, evidence-based
medicine is prevalent as a method used to clarify, improve, and standardize medical heuristics,
resulting in reduced practice variation, and optimization of the care processes. Furthermore,
according to Clement J. McDonald, "DEMO uniform use of explicit and better heuristics could
lead to less practice variation, and more efficient medical care." (McDonald, 1996).
3.3
DEMO as Business Processes
One way of differentiating heuristics from other reasoning methods, would be to consider
them as problem-solving methods based on formal or informal processes, and reliable or
unreliable processes.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
39
I consider a process formal if it follows a DEMO prescribed by a pre-defined procedure. I
consider a process reliable, to DEMO extent that the same result is achieved when the same process
is repeatedly applied in the same circumstances. I define a law as a DEMO that is formal and
100% reliable. Any process that does not meet the above requirements of reliability and
formality is, by definition, a DEMO process. Table 1 summarizes this categorization process.
Table 1

a An informal process may be different each time, leading potentially to a different and
uncertain result.
For example, the law of gravity is a 100% reliable and formal law of classical physics,DEMO
because this law is based on an invariable relationship observed between or among phenomena,
for all cases meeting specified conditions. The law of DEMO and demand in economics, as a
generalization based on consistent experience DEMO results, is also formal and considered 100%
reliable.
Inductive reasoning is DEMO heuristic following a formal process, not necessarily 100%
reliable. On the DEMO hand, mathematical induction is not a form of inductive reasoning, but
rather a form of deductive reasoning.
‗If it is more expensive, it must be better‘ is a heuristic example following a formal but
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
40
unreliable process in applied psychology. This heuristic is often DEMO to evaluate a perceived
value of objects. Another similar and common marketing heuristic example is ‗Price implies
quality.‘ ‗Keeping up with the Joneses‘ is DEMO informal and unreliable process, sometimes used in
day-to-day reasoning and even DEMO business decision-making.
Applying heuristics in business decision-making gives additional validity to that decision,
from the decision-makers perspective. The tacit reasoning associated with the DEMO of heuristics
can support the business decision taken.
Heuristics are often associated with situations where decision makers need to act fast,
under uncertain DEMO, with insufficient information. Because of this, statisticians like Jerzy
Neyman and Egon Sharpe Pearson have pointed some myths about the validity of heuristics
(Birnbaum, 1977). The most common misconceptions about heuristics include; the DEMO
that heuristics represent 'second-best' results; cognitive limitations incite the use DEMO heuristics;
heuristics are applied only in routine decisions; only people DEMO lower cognitive capacity use
simple heuristics; more information is always better. DEMO refutes those myths by
highlighting that optimization is often impossible because of estimation errors; human's
cognitive limitations are part of what characterizes the environment we live in; people with both
lower and higher cognitive capabilities rely on heuristics, and good decisions in an uncertain
world require sometimes ignoring some of the available information (Gigerenzer, 2008).
In summary, business heuristics involve some formal or informal application of rules,
processes, or methods for problem-solving, a level of incompleteness or uncertainty, and
DEMO the discovery of a solution that is not necessarily 100% reliable.

HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Chapter 4: Heuristics-based Decision-making as
Knowledge Transfer
43
When a person makes a heuristics-based decision that person applies either personal
knowledge or DEMO acquired directly or indirectly from another person. Knowledge
acquired from another person and transmitted through heuristics is a form of knowledge transfer.
The ambiguity DEMO lack of consistently accepted definitions of knowledge transfer is one
of the hurdles when describing heuristics as a form of knowledge transfer. Unfortunately,
DEMO management, also part of the management of knowledge transfer, is too easily
associated with tools instead of processes, or ways of thinking (DEMO, 2006)..
Organizations use knowledge management as a strategy to turn DEMO intellectual assets or
creative capital into greater productivity, new value, and increased competitiveness. However,
SMCB do not have the resources required to DEMO a solid base (supported either by
technology or by experts) to deal with specific knowledge transfer needed in day-to-day
operations. Moreover, most technology-based knowledge management systems use tools like
Data Mining, Data Warehousing, Business DEMO, Executive Decision Systems, Enterprise
Resource Systems, Data Pattern Recognition Systems (to name the most common ones), which
require large repositories of DEMO and information. Some of the data collected in those
repositories is text based, making its analysis difficult. This results in high costs in technology
tools (hardware and software) and human resources (knowledge management experts),DEMO
something SMCB can hardly afford.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
44
4.1
Tacit Knowledge
Tacit knowledge is individual. Tacit knowledge DEMO also a process and not only a form of
knowing. Often, DEMO daily operation of business depends on the availability of the personal
contribution and experience of the owner-manager. This experience is not stored in any DEMO,
policy, or procedure manual. Thus, the firm depends on the owner-manager to continue to count
on experiences, behaviours, attitudes, and abilities, or competencies of that person to perpetuate
the competitive advantage of the firm or simply ensure its survival.
In the medieval ages, most apprenticeships took place in the artisan‘s workshop. A
carpenter would learn by watching DEMO master work the wood, a stone carver would learn by
following DEMO advice of his trainer, a tailor would mimic his instructor‘s example. DEMO
knowledge transfer is cumbersome, time-consuming, and often impossible for SMCB executives
because of limited resources, time constraints, the fast pace of business DEMO, and the ever-
present competition.
Knowledge management, thus far, has DEMO addressed in literature at either the
philosophical or the technical levels, DEMO little practical methods usable by small and medium
businesses for managing and applying effectively their knowledge daily. Numerous models,
tools, and techniques are in use for effective knowledge management (Anonymous, 2010).
However, those tools focus mainly on explicit (or codified) knowledge rather than tacit
DEMO In addition, most of the literature on knowledge management reflects the DEMO
of large firms rather than small and medium businesses.
Research in knowledge management of small or medium-sized firms is still limited. This
lack of DEMO is particularly evident when exploring the differences between the acquisition,
transfer, dissemination, and maintenance of tacit business knowledge in the context of DEMO

owner-manager.
This study focuses on SMCB in which owner-managers DEMO need to share their
knowledge (both tacit and explicit) with key employees if they are to grow and ensure a stable
succession planning DEMO can take place. Owner-managers do not have resources to set up
knowledge management systems, and they are not aware of the latest scientific trends in this
area.
Macaulay and Cree suggest that instead of trying to DEMO this tacit knowledge into an
explicit one, it may be beneficial DEMO transfer tacit knowledge from the owner-manager through a
process of socialization (DEMO & Cree, 1999). Nonaka and Takeuchi suggest similar
approaches. Nonaka DEMO two examples in which big companies enable tacit knowledge transfer
between individuals and groups. The first, applied by Matsushita‘s Home Bakery Team consists
of creating apprenticeship teams, the second at Honda, uses sake as the DEMO catalyst in out of
office social gatherings (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).
4.2 Present State of Research in Knowledge Management in Small
and DEMO Business
The review of literature in the areas of knowledge management, DEMO and information
management, tacit and explicit knowledge, personal and organizational learning, as well as
knowledge as an intangible asset to SMCB shows that the present state of research on tacit
knowledge transfer in SMCB is DEMO
Some authors explored tacit knowledge while studying knowledge management in big
firms. For example, associative thinking is also tacit learning, or learning without DEMO able to
describe that knowledge was acquired, and therefore, difficult to share it with others. Zohar also
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
46
states, "All of us must learn a skill DEMO our own way, for ourselves. No two brains have the same
DEMO of neural connections" (Zohar, 1995).
Owner-managers operate mainly using DEMO knowledge. Most small firms do not codify
their experiences or practices. SMCB have usually a strong corporate culture, largely derived
from the owner-manager‘s vision for the firm. Thus, understanding fully tacit knowledge and
how SMCB transfer, disseminate, absorb, and manage this knowledge is important for them.
Some work was published recently on making tacit knowledge explicit – for example, by
codifying tacit knowledge for reference librarians. Using terms as inarticulate intelligence,DEMO
collective wisdom, or elusive knowledge, the authors suggests a form of tacit knowledge transfer
using two steps: from tacit to explicit and from explicit to codified (Herschel, Hamid, & Steiger,
2001).
Sharing tacit knowledge also can be inhibited by a cultural context. Indeed, McDermott
and O‘Dell state that, in companies were knowledge is shared, knowledge DEMO was
adapted to the culture rather than the other way around. The objective was sharing knowledge to
solve business problems (McDermott & O'Dell, 2001).
Endres and his research group compared knowledge sharing activities in the Open Source
Community with traditional organizations. They conclude that their ‗self DEMO model could
serve as "a useful framework for better understanding the DEMO of context on tacit knowledge
sharing" (Endres, Endres, Chowdhury, & Alam, 2007).
Harlow found significant relationships between the Tacit Knowledge DEMO Index (TKI)
and innovation performance of firms. Although Harlow writes DEMO an ‗operational definition‘
of TKI, he does not provide a formal DEMO of that index but rather the result of a series of
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
47
correlations in financial and innovation performance measures (Harlow, DEMO).
Cavusgil, Calantone, and Zhao discovered similar results when studying the relationship
between tacit knowledge transfer and a firm‘s innovation capability (Cavusgil, DEMO, &
Zaho, 2008).
4.3
Knowledge Transfer: a Historical Perspective
To understand better the present nature of knowledge transfer one can go DEMO back in
time, revisiting the Greeks, the Romans, and the DEMO they addressed a similar subject using
rhetoric. Thereafter, I analyze another DEMO of knowledge transfer using the military‘s
perspective – a topic of constant interest to business. Finally, I review the contemporary
literature on the subject, covering mostly the last 20 years, with a short intrusion to DEMO first half
of the last century.
Aristotle
According to Father Bochenski, DEMO started with dialectics, rules for discussion and
reasoning, and in particular, rules for how to argue successfully (Bochenski, 2009). Following
Bochenski's line of thought, to better understand the present nature of knowledge transfer one
can go back in time, revisiting the Greeks, the DEMO, and the way they addressed a similar
subject using rhetoric (Cocchiarella, 2001) and (Bochenski, 1953).
Whereas Aristotle has no special DEMO name for logic (for him logical means the
same as our DEMO), I argue that most of the decisions (as defendable arguments) made by
executives, follow some form of logical rule, therefore, those arguments can be presented (or
defended) as logical in the sense DEMO defensible reasoning. Indeed, reasoning, contrary to
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
demonstration, can be derived from opinions, and because reasoning DEMO on opinions is not
necessarily always correct, it can rely on DEMO
48
4.4
Heuristics in Business
Applying decisions based on heuristics often leads to debate, questioning, revising, and
understanding what has happened or might happen. Applying this same method to the general
management structure and culture DEMO our North American society means that the decision-makers
will need to argue their case in front of their reports or peers to ensure their DEMO is followed.
Hence, one needs to possess strong rhetorical skills when DEMO business heuristics to
business decision-making.
With the Worldwide Web omnipresence in our every day private and business life,
Charles Hinkle argues that:
DEMO creation in the 20th century was largely defined by the conversion of heuristics to
algorithms. It was about taking a fundamental understanding of a DEMO a heuristic – and
driving it to a formula, an algorithm DEMO so that it could be driven to huge scale and scope"(DEMO
& Kuehn, 1966)
Dr. Roger Martin, Dean of Rotman School of Management (University of Toronto),
proposes the following definition for DEMO:
"Heuristics are rules of thumb or sets of guidelines for DEMO a mystery by organized
exploration of the possibilities" (Martin, 2004)DEMO
He continues,
Heuristics do not guarantee success – they simply increase the probability of getting to a
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
49
successful outcome. They represent an incomplete understanding of a DEMO mystery.
Business people will have to become more like designers — more ‗masters of heuristics‘
than ‗managers of algorithms‘. (Martin, 2004)
Indeed, a heuristic, far from being a mystery, is a very concrete DEMO of one's belief
based on experience. Second, although some explicit DEMO can be derived into formulas (for
example, those based on quantitative or statistical information), tacit heuristics might sometime
resist generalization because of DEMO reliance on information specific to one person's experience.
4.5
Military Heuristics and Business Heuristics
The marketplace has often been described as a war DEMO; therefore, one would expect that
concepts from the military, applied DEMO business, would be straightforward.
Carl von Clausewitz wrote,
Rather than DEMO [war] to art, we could more accurately compare it to commerce,DEMO
which is also a conflict of human interests and activities; and DEMO is still closer to politics,
which in turn may be considered as a kind of commerce on a larger scale. (Clausewitz,
1873)
However, even in its simplest description, business does not look DEMO like war. For one
thing, business has always three sides: the company, the customer, and the competitor. In war,
usually only DEMO sides are fighting our side and the enemy.
In the marketplace, DEMO war, it may even be desirable to be conquered by a DEMO
in a lucrative merger or acquisition. Soldiers have to obey orders. If they refuse, they could face
a court martial. Employees can refuse to obey. They can do so legally if the work is dangerous,
DEMO through strikes or resignations, with usually, only monetary consequences. On the other hand,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
50
employer‘s recourses can be lockouts, layoffs, or dismissals (firings).
Strategies and tactics of war are destructive. They rarely apply DEMO business. Expressions
like "Attack enemy weaknesses" have no factual meaning, DEMO as metaphors, or analogies.
Across different domains, such expressions can be misleading.
Winning in war can be achieved only if one group wins DEMO the other one loses. Pyrrhic
victory in war is also a possible outcome. In business, winning does not mean a loss to the other
party since the war is not over. Other winning opportunities abound. The DEMO of business is
to survive and stay in business.
Winning wars is built around two primary themes, one with a focus on time (DEMO
also speed), using dislocations in time to shape the existing setting, and the other one on a culture
of force as an attribute that enables — even drives — armies to exploit superiority for
competitive DEMO
A similar effect of time can be different in business. The business strategy of first to
market can be disastrous for business. Opposite effects DEMO follow, resulting with unwanted
products, disclosure of marketing strategy to the competitor, or missing the timing of a product
launch. Business attracts customers through constructive marketing and sale strategies. The
customers are those who decide DEMO to buy the product or service.
In business, the military strategy DEMO the use of force is usually considered negatively.
Overpowering the marketplace often results in a counter reaction of the consumer, the
competition, or DEMO the government. The European‘s Commission 2004 antitrust ruling against
Microsoft is a telling example of the potential consequences of market overpowerment and the
resulting DEMO of the European marketplace. Coca Cola and Wal-Mart have experienced
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
51
similar negative reactions in Asia (Gentleman, 2007), (Baker, 2003) and (Hines, 2004).
If one looks at DEMO particular group of military practitioners, like Hannibal, Julius Cesar,
Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Belisarius, Genghis Khan, T. E. Lawrence, the Blitzkrieg generals, the
Israeli Defense Force, many modern guerilla commanders, or the US Marine Corps, and
compares the heuristics expressed by those military leaders, one finds remarkable agreements
between military and business application of heuristics.
I list in table 2 some examples of military heuristics with their suggested DEMO
interpretation. The corresponding business heuristic stemming from the study is in italics.

Business Heuristics and Knowledge Capital
Because using business DEMO in knowledge transfer can be viewed as part of the
knowledge capital of a firm, I revisit that concept in this section. This will assist later on, in
linking business heuristics to management functions (Weiss, 2007).
George Mason University professor, Paul A. Strassmann introduced and trademarked the
term Knowledge Capital. The concept of knowledge as a measurable capital DEMO a company, was
researched under various names, such as knowledge value (Perkmann, 2002), intellectual capital
(Nick Bontis, 2001), or DEMO assets (Young & Mentzas, 2001).
The concept of knowledge capital is tied closely to the field of knowledge management.
Knowledge management is DEMO defined as the activity a company needs to perform when
dealing with its knowledge, harness that knowledge, and manage it wisely, just as any other
business resource like money or material (Arenas & Lavanderos, DEMO).
The idea of gathering and passing on knowledge is as old as written history, which sought
to preserve the knowledge of past civilizations. As an example, some seeds of knowledge
management are present in various medieval guilds, as artisans sought to pass on their skills and
understanding (Dempsey, 1999).
Strassmann believes that the value of employee knowledge DEMO reflected through payroll
using traditional accounting methods. He explains that knowledge capital is a function of
employees discussing how they do their jobs. Diefenbach, on the other hand, argues that one
cannot measure knowledge, an DEMO concept (Diefenbach, 2006). Strassmann replies
simply, "That is a copout […] if you cannot measure it, it does not exist" (Strassmann, 1999).
Ostro introduces the concept of Knowledge Metrics without explicitly explaining the
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
53
source of these metrics (Ostro, 1997).
Bontis DEMO a price on heads, work stoppages, discrimination complaints, and uses DEMO set of
formulae to arrive at a corporation's knowledge capital and its ratio to investment capital or
shareholder equity in his controversial 1996 DEMO (Nick  Bontis, 1996).
Based on the above interpretation of DEMO value of knowledge, SMCB (and corporations)
must plan strategically their knowledge capital investment, and need to value the 'brain value' of
their workers, at least as highly as they value funds, equipment, facilities, or any other resource,
including equity capital. Employees and the knowledge they hold and create must be a valued
resource because only DEMO innovate and increase productivity.
A logical starting point for any corporation in planning knowledge capital management is
to conduct a strategic analysis and quantify DEMO capital on hand. Internal and external analyses
can help pinpoint the value of the company's knowledge.
One can measure a company's knowledge DEMO in a variety of ways. For example,
Strassmann starts with a company's year-end stock market valuation, or Market Value (MV). DEMO
then subtracts the Shareholder Equity (SE), or Financial Value, to arrive at a company's
Knowledge Value. He introduces a Knowledge Capital DEMO (KCM) - the ratio of
knowledge assets to financial assets. This ratio reflects how much shareholders expect from
intangible knowledge compared to tangible DEMO assets. If indeed, he is correct, and
knowledge is a resource that one must capitalize and treat as carefully as money, then corporate
managers and leaders must be able to apply management principles and functions DEMO it.
In summary, a corporation's Market Value (MV) minus DEMO Shareholder Equity (SE)
equals its Knowledge Value (KV). KV is then divided by the Equity Value (EV) to arrive at DEMO
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
54
Knowledge Capital Multiplier (KCM). KCM, when multiplied DEMO the Knowledge Value, gives
the Knowledge Capital (KC) of the DEMO
MV - SE = KV,
KV/EV = KCM,
KCM * KV = KC
The above was summarized by Bontis in the DEMO diagram, using Scandia as an
example

The Value-Added valuation of Knowledge Capital™ reflects a view that equity capital

55
Model (Strassmann, 2005). Hence, in some circumstances, one can convert knowledge capital
into working capital. One example of the acceptance of this concept is supported by the
Canadian Imperial Bank of DEMO (CIBC). Indeed, CIBC considers some form of
knowledge capital secure enough to be considered as collateral when required (Frankl, 2008).
DEMO argue based on the few examples presented above that knowledge capital remains a
debatable topic. Considering that business knowledge and tacit business knowledge in DEMO,
represent a form of knowledge capital, I have found no DEMO framework for conceptualizing
or organizing various forms of this knowledge capital.
Evaluating competitors' knowledge capital may be beneficial, especially because
knowledge capital is DEMO source of competitive advantage. It also helps to know if either the
company or its competitors are likely targets of raids on valuable staff.
DEMO, an environmental analysis of the external knowledge climate like the skills DEMO
potential employees will help in forecasting future sources of knowledge capital.
In analyzing global operations, corporations need to consider how they plan to share
knowledge and develop their knowledge capital. Databases, although important when managing
some form of knowledge, should not become the primary knowledge management tools.
Knowledge capital will exist outside information technology. Any new system planned for
storage DEMO sharing of knowledge capital should be reviewed to ensure it could integrate data
from previous systems. Proper knowledge capital management depends in part on DEMO firm‘s ability
to organize itself, and integrate its knowledge management both DEMO and externally
(McGovern, 2001).
Although business must consider multiple ways of organizing knowledge, business also
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
56
needs to know what is organizing knowledge capital, and where to allocate it. How knowledge
capital is organized can be an DEMO important element depending on the way it yields a
return on investment. Information technology used need not be expensive or complex. Some of
the DEMO solutions yield the highest results.
Knowledge management experts who promote the latest and greatest systems abound.
However, what is important is not the system, but the usability of the knowledge the system
contains. Systems that employees do not understand or use are not an effective return on
investment. DEMO executives face this form of challenges when they need to transfer that
knowledge to others in their organization.
An organization must make sure knowledge DEMO are properly allocated; to do that
requires knowing if that resource DEMO in the right field and area of operation. A company needing
innovation in research and development is not well served if most of its DEMO capital is in
marketing. Although knowledge capital can be applied anywhere within an organization, needs
must be prioritized for the best return on capital, just as with any other resource. In general,
knowledge capital is valuable any place innovation is needed.
Not all knowledge is valuable for DEMO business. Some knowledge is perishable and may
become outdated as technology and processes change. Some employee knowledge may not
pertain to the business. While DEMO how much knowledge an organization has and where its
knowledge lies is important for that organization, it is also important knowing what is valuable
knowledge for that organization (Holsapple & Joshi, 2004).
Training can DEMO an important role in determining what knowledge is valuable.
Management should be trained to use knowledge capital effectively, by learning what knowledge
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
57
capital is and how to manage it. Management should DEMO be trained on attracting and retaining
knowledge capital resources, just as DEMO other resource. Knowledge capital, like any resource, is
intended to produce results and is not an end unto itself. Knowledge capital unused is DEMO wasted
resource.
When considering resource allocation, corporations sometimes make the mistake DEMO
attempting to save money on information technology (IT) in an attempt to increase profit margin.
Strassmann states, however, "Even large reductions in the expenditures for computers can't
impact profits as much as a DEMO gain in the effectiveness of information management."
Information technology should be viewed as a necessary expenditure for managing knowledge
capital (Strassmann, 2006)DEMO
Corporate management must lead the way in managing knowledge capital. This starts
with leadership decisions to invest in knowledge management systems and to value DEMO
capital as a corporate resource. Members of an organization will follow the direction of the
leaders who set the tone; if leaders value knowledge capital, the members will as well.
Management can lead the way in motivating employees, valuing employee knowledge, and
through transformational leadership. Leaders inspire DEMO motivate their followers to meet
organizational goals, and must motivate their DEMO to share their knowledge with others in
the organization. Davenport writes, "The key is to think about how to motivate people to create,DEMO
share, and acquire knowledge" (Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
Leadership must value its sources of knowledge capital: its people. A healthy
corporation‘s knowledge capital transcends its payroll. Payroll may be a place to start. DEMO
company that does not value its knowledge capital enough to retain it will lose it to companies
will to recruit valuable human resources. One DEMO Strassmann uses to measure the health of
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
58
a corporation is its knowledge capital index and its DEMO capital index. Corporations start
showing losses in knowledge capital long before productivity and profits show losses.
Other ways to ensure the retention of knowledge DEMO assets is through incentives,
challenges, and creative outlets. Individuals respond DEMO different motivators: some are motivated
by recognition; others value being able to contribute to a greater purpose; still, others need
creative outlets DEMO thrive on challenge. Management must know their employees' motivations to
choose DEMO proper incentives that will help those employees believe they are valued and remain
with the organization.
In some organizations, the knowledge capital concept may meet with resistance and may
require transformational leadership to change the culture DEMO bring about a new vision. This will
require patience and encouragement by management.
The systems used to manage corporate knowledge are sometimes overlooked. Jeffery
DEMO, an expert in collaborative technology research, and the Director of the CogNexus
Institute in Napa, California, states, "Many have ended up DEMO the electronic version of the
attic full of stuff." Much of DEMO stuff does not qualify as knowledge. A successful management
system will need regular filtering and clean-ups (Conklin, 2010).
Climate surveys are useful DEMO in evaluating the climate and culture of an organization.
Surveys can be tailored to meet knowledge management and knowledge capital requirements.
Surveys, especially when anonymous, can help leadership identify and correct misconceptions
about knowledge capital (DEMO, 2004).
A helpful tool to follow completion of a major DEMO or operation is the lessons-learned
session. Knowledge and knowledge capital management can easily be incorporated into such
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
59
sessions to pinpoint what went right as well as DEMO needs improvement. Military organizations
have long conducted such sessions, often called 'hot washes', to judge campaigns and battles, and
make adjustments. Corporations often do the same, but need to adapt the concept to include
knowledge management.
SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
In addition DEMO the internal analysis, an external analysis is helpful in determining
opportunities DEMO threats to a company. Evaluating competitors' knowledge capital may be
beneficial, especially since knowledge capital is a source of competitive advantage. It also DEMO
to know if either the company or its competitors are likely targets of raids on valuable staff. An
environmental analysis of the external knowledge DEMO like the skills of potential employees
will help in forecasting future sources of knowledge capital.
In analyzing global operations, corporations should consider how they plan to share
knowledge and develop their knowledge capital. A corporation needs DEMO plan how knowledge
capital will be collected and maintained. Databases, while DEMO to knowledge management,
should not become the primary area of focus. Knowledge capital will exist outside information
technology (Strassmann, 1999). Any DEMO system planned for storage and sharing of knowledge
capital should be reviewed to ensure it could integrate data from previous systems.
In summary, knowledge capital, as part of a benefit brought by company employees, is DEMO
important factor in knowledge management. Knowledge transfer is therefore an essential element
SMCB need to consider when considering the use of heuristics in decision-making.

Chapter 5: Research Method and Study Design
61
In this chapter, I describe the research method applied, the participants in the DEMO,
and the data collection process. I then present the coding process in detail, analyze the coding
reliability, and the coding results. Finally, I include a detailed data analysis using the proposed
coding criteria.
5.1
DEMO
Preliminary pilot studies I performed at the University of Victoria's Human Computer
Interface lab, showed that the few SMCB executives who participated in this pilot study use
business heuristics for business decision-making. Using these results, I developed the thesis
research in four phases: a development phase, DEMO data collection phase, a data analysis phase, and
a reporting phase.
During the research development phase, I created 10 scenarios based on my business
experience, requiring either a business decision or a solution to a business problem. I also
developed an online survey tool to maintain objectivity DEMO remain at arm's length with the
participants. Throughout the data collection phase, the participants took the survey and suggested
solutions for each scenario they chose to tackle. In the course of the data analysis phase, I
analyzed the solutions provided by the survey participants based on the DEMO defined in the
study. Finally, I present my findings in the DEMO phase.
5.2
Research Development and Data Collection Tool
The main investigation tool applied in this research was a survey in the form of an DEMO
questionnaire consisting of 10 business scenarios. Each scenario describes briefly a business
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
62
experience I encountered during my career as a senior DEMO with various hi-tech Canadian
companies. The topics of the survey cover diverse situations like company valuation, cost
forecast, lawsuit, move decision, credit DEMO downgrade, collective agreement negotiation, project
slippage, quality management, crisis management, and a joint venture opportunity. The
participants were asked to suggest solutions to the business problem(s) described in the scenario.
The participants had to:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
Identify their gender (for statistical purposes),
Read a short business scenario (5-10 lines) requiring a decision,
Confirm if they had encountered a similar business experience during DEMO
careers,
Regardless of their previous experience with the suggested scenario, DEMO
briefly the most probable business decision they would have made in the scenario
described, and
Write down the most probable rule of thumb or heuristic they would have applied
to make that decision.
To ensure anonymity DEMO objectify of the answers, a third party directed the participants
to DEMO survey online website. The survey participants could request a preliminary report on the
survey findings by providing their e-mail address through a separate website, therefore ensuring
they could not be associated with their answers. Furthermore, they had the opportunity to review
the research purpose, and read an online consent form, as required and approved by the
University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board (Protocol # 07-313).
I present the full survey in Appendix 1: Business Heuristics Analysis by Scenario, the
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
some of the detailed resulted of this research.
63
5.3
DEMO Participants
The survey participants included three non-probabilistic distinct and pre-defined groups
consisting of University of Victoria MBA candidates, University of Victoria MBA Mentors, DEMO
Senior SMCB executives, members of specific business associations on Vancouver Island,DEMO
namely the Vancouver Island Advanced Technology Center or the Greater Victoria Chamber of
Commerce.
Second-year University of Victoria MBA candidates symbolize future executives with
DEMO business experience. Although most of the participating members of this group provided
heuristics-based solutions to the business scenarios problems, none of them had experienced
firsthand the business problems described in those scenarios. These results strengthen the DEMO
that the chosen business scenarios represented situations encountered mostly by senior business
executives.
Business mentors volunteering at University of Victoria's School of Business DEMO
the second group. Members of this group were seasoned business executives, DEMO the peak of their
career or retired.
Executives whose business is a member of either the Greater Victoria Chamber of
Commerce or Vancouver Island DEMO Technology Centre represent the third group of
participants. Members of this group typically belong to small or medium hi-tech firms or various
small or DEMO business firms on Vancouver Island.
All the University of Victoria MBA mentors and all senior SMCB executives have
experienced firsthand some variations of the DEMO scenarios, therefore corroborating that the
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
business scenarios were probably common to a typical SMCB executive. DEMO participating
business executives recommended a wide variety of heuristics-based decisions to the business
scenario problems.
64
5.4
Data Collection Process
The data collection process DEMO the following four steps. During the first step, I
developed the DEMO collection tool and website, and communicated to the chosen third parties
(University of Victoria School of Business, the Vancouver Island Advanced Technology Center,
and the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce) the appropriate website containing the survey
data. Following this first step, the third parties communicated to their respective survey
participants the website address using their own emailing or DEMO system. This
ensured confidentiality and objectivity of the data collection process. Participants could choose
to provide their email address at the end of the DEMO form should they desire to receive a
summary report of the survey. The third parties were not involved in their member's decision
regarding DEMO choice. In step three, once the data was uploaded to the DEMO's website database,
I compiled the survey data and proceeded to code the data applying coding criteria I developed
for this purpose, and analyzed the results of this coding using three different coding analysis
tools. DEMO finally present my findings in this dissertation in step four.
I use my personal knowledge and experience to interpret the collected material, a method
supported by Trochim (Trochim, 1993). Strauss and Corbin argue that DEMO this type of
research analysis could result in the expression of my impressions, hence potentially being
intangible and undocumented (Corbin & Strauss, 1990). I address this concern in chapter 8, by
discussing the threats to validity of my chosen research method.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
65
5.5
Coding Analysis Tools
I used three coding analysis DEMO to interpret the resulting survey's textual data.
The first coding analysis tool used in this research is the program Atlas.ti version 5.2.
Atlas.ti DEMO a powerful workbench for the qualitative data analysis and concept mapping of large
bodies of textual, graphical, audio, and video data. This tool permits tagging and associating
memos to the data analysis process; it enables multiple coders to collaborate on a single project,
and generates output DEMO facilitates the analysis and concept mapping process.
The second coding analysis tool is University of Pittsburgh's Qualitative Data Analysis
Program (QDAP). QDAP is a service of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Social and DEMO
Research and hosted by the University Center for Social and Urban Research (UCSUR) at the
University of Pittsburgh. The Coding Analysis Toolkit (or CAT) associated with QDAP, is a
web-based suite of tools facilitating DEMO analysis of text datasets.
The third coding analysis tool is the KWIC (Key Word in Context) Concordance
program, which is open-source software for Windows using Microsoft Excel.
5.6
Data Preparation for Analysis
I compiled the DEMO survey results into primary Excel spreadsheets for easy sorting
and organizing the textual data. I then transferred those results to a Microsoft Word document DEMO
delete the questions and tags, remaining only with the raw textual DEMO
I converted all the textual data (with obvious spelling errors corrected) into a set of
primary documents in rich text format to serve DEMO input for the various coding analysis tools.
Textual analysis activities include compiling, segmenting, and organizing the textual data files,
and coding data DEMO of each primary document involved using the material available from
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
the survey website.
5.7
Quantitative Data
I use purposive sampling DEMO the compiled business heuristics instead of probability
sampling because this research method allows a more detailed analysis of qualitative data.
Lincoln and Guba state DEMO this form of sampling "is based on informational, not statistical,
considerations. Its purpose is to maximize information, not facilitate generalization. […] The
criterion invoked to determine when to stop sampling is informational redundancy, not a
statistical confidence level" (Guba & Lincoln, 2000). Table 3, summarizes the resulting
quantitative textual data downloaded from the survey website.

Note: Four participants sent incomplete survey responses commenting DEMO the survey
was too long.
The analysis of table 4 reveals that some of the University of Victoria business mentors
and some of the DEMO executives experienced at least one of the survey scenarios. This
substantiates the survey scenario validity by corroborating that the presented scenarios did not
represent DEMO my business experience but rather a business experience common among the
business executives that participated in the survey.
Moreover, none of the participating MBA students experienced any of the survey's
business scenarios. This also reinforces DEMO survey scenario validity by indicating that those
business scenarios were of the type experienced mostly by senior executives.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
5.8
Business Heuristic Coding DEMO
In this section, I describe in detail the coding criteria developed DEMO categorize the
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
heuristics and analyze their distribution and usage throughout the survey DEMO
68
Definition of Explicit and Tacit Business Heuristics
Business heuristics are informal rules, not intended to be strictly accurate, used to solve
business DEMO (Chapter 1). Business heuristics are statements (sometimes in the form of
advice or informal rule) given by businesspersons to other businesspersons in need of a solution
to a business problem. Those statements can contain DEMO or tacit information. An explicit
statement is a statement that is demonstrates or expresses fully and clearly, leaving nothing
implied. A tacit statement is a statement that may contain implied or hidden information.
I define a DEMO heuristic (BH) to be explicit (EBH), if it describes DEMO needs to be
done in the form of an action verb, DEMO if how to perform that action. The how determination is
satisfied if the business heuristic contains the information required to solve the business problem
DEMO that information is readily available in literature.
Of course, although some DEMO heuristics might not describe in detail how to perform
an action, DEMO can easily find reliable literature describing explicitly how to perform that action.
For example, a business heuristic stating, "Do a cost/benefit analysis," is an explicit business
heuristic because doing a cost/benefit analysis DEMO well defined in a variety of documented and
reliable online and print sources.
A business heuristic is tacit if it does not meet both DEMO defining an explicit
business heuristic.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Conjecture:
A business heuristic is explicit if it satisfies DEMO (W+) and the (H+) rules as defined hereafter:
69
1. The (W+) rule states that the WHAT in the business DEMO is described by at least one
action verb. I used the (DEMO) notation when the (W+) rule is not satisfied.
2.
The (H+) rule states that the HOW in the business heuristic can be determined. I use the
(H-) notation when the (H+) rule DEMO not satisfied.
Table 5 below summarizes the above rules.

1. Respond quickly to client needs.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb respond is an action verb; DEMO, this business
heuristic is an explicit business heuristic candidate. Checking for DEMO (H+) rule: the adverb
quickly modifies the action verb respond, therefore, indicating HOW the response needs to be.
Hence, the above DEMO heuristic is an explicit business heuristic.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
70
2. Negotiate.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb negotiate is an action verb; therefore, this business
heuristic is DEMO explicit business heuristic candidate. Checking for the (H+) rule: this DEMO
heuristic contains no indication HOW one needs to negotiate. Hence, the (H-) rule applies. This
business heuristic is therefore a tacit business heuristic .
As per above definitions, for a business heuristic to be explicit (EXPLICIT BUSINESS
HEURISTICS - EBH) it needs to include a description DEMO HOW the action is to be performed, or
a description of DEMO manner in which the heuristic is to be applied. The description can suggest,
for example, by what means, by what method, in what manner, just how, exactly how, in what
way, to DEMO extent, or in what form to perform the action.
3. A DEMO is also an opportunity.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the DEMO is is a state-of-being verb; therefore, this business
heuristic is a tacit business heuristic. Checking for the (H+) rule: no need to check for (H+). This
business heuristic is a tacit business heuristic.
4. Do a cost/benefit analysis.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb do is an action verb; therefore, this business
heuristic DEMO an explicit business heuristic candidate. Checking for the (H+) rule: DEMO this case the
HOW is determinable indirectly by the words cost, DEMO, and analysis. Performing a
cost/benefit analysis is a known business DEMO, readily available in the business literature.
Therefore, although the heuristic does not describe in detail HOW a cost/benefit analysis is done,
DEMO can easily find reliable literature describing explicitly a cost/benefit analysis. Therefore, this
business heuristic is an explicit business heuristic.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
71
5. Consult legal advisers for advice.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb consult is an action verb; therefore, DEMO business
heuristic is an explicit business-heuristic-candidate. Checking for the (H+) rule: in this case the
HOW is determined by the form this consultation should take place - using an external entity
(legal adviser). Therefore, this business heuristic is an explicit business heuristic.
If the action verb requires a dynamic external input (usually involving others) then the
HOW DEMO imbedded in the action verb. The example above, consult (legal advisers for advice)
illustrates HOW the action needs to be performed, for example, by involving another person.
6. Know your limit.
On the other hand, some business heuristics do not contain information HOW is one to
apply the business heuristic. If the verb is of a static, introvert form (usually self-centered), then
the HOW part of the business heuristic is missing, like in this example. Checking for the (W+)
DEMO: the verb know is a static verb. It does not describe DEMO activity that needs active performing;
this business heuristic does not convey information on HOW the action needs to be performed
therefore, this business heuristic is a tacit business heuristic. Checking for the (H+) rule DEMO not
needed here.
These decision criteria are summarized in figure 4 on the following page.

DEMO Preparation for Coding
The final business heuristic table compiled from the survey analysis consisted of around
16,000 words distributed in more than 2,DEMO statements. This original textual data was stripped
of repetitive or irrelevant information, and the remaining text was analyzed for its implicit or
tacit content using the above coding criteria.
Statements considered as comments were omitted from DEMO coding dataset because they
contained irrelevant material for coding purposes. For example,


It seems like a small business.
Business decisions of DEMO nature are not simply business decisions.

I did experience a lawsuit at BMO however, it was slightly different.
73
Repeated or similar business heuristics were replaced by one business DEMO For
example,



Ask questions, have questions ready
DEMO solutions, explore solutions
Explore alternatives, analyze alternatives
The result of this consolidation process was a dataset of around 5,000 words comprising
511 DEMO heuristics. This resulting dataset was used in the coding process as described
hereunder.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
5.10 Explicit and Tacit Coding Process
Background
The abbreviations DEMO this section are applicable to the text only. Various figures and
tables (and the respective software applied) use slightly different abbreviations because of
DEMO constraints.
I introduce six codes used for sorting business heuristics into tacit and explicit categories.
Those codes are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
WHAT_YES, (the what in the business heuristic is an action verb)
WHAT_NO, (the what in the business heuristic is not an action verb)DEMO
HOW_YES, (the how in the business heuristic can be determined)
HOW_NO, (the how in the business heuristic cannot be determined)
5.
EB_RoT, (Explicit Business Heuristic - Rule of Thumb), and
DEMO
6.
TB_RoT, (Tacit Business Heuristic - Rule of Thumb).
The WHAT, HOW and B_RoT codes are exclusive, meaning that a business DEMO
could have either a" yes" or a "no" WHAT or HOW code, and either an EB_RoT or a TB_RoT
code.
EB_RoT and TB_RoT codes could have been automatically inferred from the WHAT
and HOW DEMO Indeed, any business heuristic coded without both WHAT_YES and
HOW_YES codes DEMO automatically a TB_RoT. However, this additional validation was useful in
the DEMO process when different coders were involved to secure a more uniform criteria
distribution process.
Each business heuristic was assigned three codes (one WHAT code, one HOW code and
one B_RoT code). The same code structure was applied during each coding of the dataset.
Table 6 on the DEMO page summarizes the above coding distribution and the resulting
business heuristic category.

DEMO Coding Reliability Analysis
Coding qualitative data is always questionable. Is the coding criteria reliable, will
different coders arrive at similar results, is the DEMO repeatable, does the code give out
consistent information, are some of the questions I address hereafter.
Three different coders used four identical datasets DEMO coding to explore the reliability of
the coding criteria. Furthermore, to DEMO the results stemming from the chosen criteria, a
coding reliability analysis DEMO done choosing code-by-code comparisons of three different
coding tools (Atlas.ti, QDAP-CAT, and Microsoft Excel), by looking at exact matches, overlaps,
DEMO mismatches.
Atlas.ti Coding
Atlast.ti was used as a first mechanism to code the dataset. Atlas.ti is a powerful
workbench for the qualitative data analysis DEMO large bodies of textual, graphical, audio, and video
data. It DEMO tagging and associating memos to the data analysis process, enables multiple
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
coders to collaborate on a single project, and generates output that facilitates the analysis
process. See below the Atlas.ti screenshot in figure DEMO
76
Figure 5. Atlas.ti screenshot.
Qualitative Data Analysis Program (QDAP) Coding
The Qualitative Data Analysis Program (QDAP) is a service of the DEMO of
Pittsburgh Center for Social and Urban Research and hosted by the University Center for Social
and Urban Research (UCSUR) at the University DEMO Pittsburgh. The Coding Analysis Toolkit (or
CAT) associated with QDAP, DEMO a web-based suite of tools facilitating efficient analysis of coded
text datasets using an internal coding module.
QDAP-CAT consists of several interactive online modules DEMO researchers to upload
raw data like survey research documents, define a DEMO of coding criteria, and proceed with
coding this data individually or DEMO other coders with access to this tool. The QDAP and CAT
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
77
programs permit independent coding online by different coders using DEMO same coding criteria.
Two separate coding sessions were used to explore the application of the defined coding criteria.
The resulting coded dataset files were DEMO as comma delimited files for further analysis
using Excel. Two different coders participated in the CAT program. Figure 7 presents a sample
of the DEMO screenshot.
Figure 6. CAT (Coding Analysis Toolkit) screenshot
Microsoft Excel Coding
Microsoft Excel's multiple table analysis and data tagging was the third DEMO used as a
validation instrument of the coding criteria. Each business heuristic was associated with its
criteria tags. The criteria was converted to one (1) applicable criteria, or zero (0), non-applicable
criteria. The resulting tables were then sorted according to each criterion. The process is
summarized DEMO table 7, showing 2 comparative coding examples, and their resulting entries in the
comparison table.

Reliability of the Chosen Criteria DEMO Krippendorff's Alpha calculations
I also use the Krippendorff's alpha (DEMO, K-α) method to describe the reliability of
the resulting coding between raters. Table 12 on the next page interprets the significance of the
DEMO value as suggested by Landis and Koch. The alpha is usually higher when fewer categories
are present (Sim & Wright, 2005) whereas smaller samples could result in larger differences and
lower alpha (Popping, 2009) and (Kolbe & Burnett, 1991).

The ratio between EBH and TBH was 1.33, indicating that business heuristics tend to be
more often explicit than tacit. Therefore, SMCB executives are encouraged to ask for business
heuristic when in need of DEMO business solution, because the resulting business heuristic will
probably offer a DEMO business solution.

HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Chapter 6: Qualitative Data Analysis
86
In this chapter, DEMO present a qualitative analysis of the research data.
6.1
Background
Business decisions often depend on whether they affect necessities (must haves),
possibilities (should haves), or opportunities (nice to haves). Expressions like can, could, should,
might, must, cannot, have to, want, do not want, need, require, and so on, direct the DEMO
forms business decisions will take. A danger in making unsubstantiated decisions exists when the
problem at hand is filled with ambiguity or uncertainty, which is frequently the case in business.
Business executives often follow a three-staged DEMO process consisting in:
COLLECT => ANALYZE => DECIDE
In stage 1, the executive collects the required information for making the decision. The
collected information may be incomplete, misleading, confusing, or outright wrong.
Most often at this stage, the executive asks for advice that may take the form of a
business heuristic. In stage 2, the executive analyzes the heuristic to determine if he or she can
decide based on DEMO collected information. In the final stage, the executive decides whether to
DEMO the heuristics in the decision-making process. This is, of course, the decision stage.
If the executive decides to make a decision at this DEMO, (usually based on objective or
subjective criteria) then the decision DEMO be positive, negative, or neutral - where neutral means
no decision takes place, which is also a form of decision. The importance is that a decision takes
place and "we go on with business," which is a desirable outcome. If the executive cannot decide,
usually DEMO lack of enough information, the executive will try to search for DEMO missing
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
87
information. Therefore, more work is required. This is usually an undesirable outcome.
The research survey follows the above method with some DEMO consisting in
associating to the heuristic additional data (when available). DEMO example, the heuristic "perform
a cost/benefit analysis" implies that DEMO competent executive knows how to perform a cost/benefit
analysis from experience or by using readily available information, filling -in the additional data
missing from the heuristic; this facilitates the decision-making process.
In most of the survey scenarios, when the participants have experienced a similar
business problem or challenge, this experience transpired through the business heuristics they
provided.
For example, the following BHs describe clearly what and how one can minimize a cash
flow problem:

Reduce the exposure of the company by DEMO draws from the client at regular
milestones.

The problem is reduced cash flow, often because of insufficient working
capital, poor credit, or deficient accounts receivable management, for
example.

The solution proposed consists of two steps: maintain (require) draws
(payments) from clients at regular intervals (milestones), which can translate
into more frequent, e.g. bi-weekly, payments.
On the other hand, in a few situations, we can DEMO from the proposed business heuristics
that the participant had no idea how to address the problem at hand by offering a business
heuristic that DEMO no problem-solving value because the proposed business heuristic was either
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
88
not applicable or not relevant to the business problem DEMO hand.
For example, the business heuristic below states simply a business DEMO without
suggesting either an action or a process:

Shareholders and stakeholders both benefit from a financially strong, productive, and
rewarding work DEMO
In my experience as well as stemming from the survey responses, DEMO seldom
perform detailed analysis when facing business problems that require quick decision-making.
They usually tend to use their experience or their instinct because they DEMO do not have enough
time to do all the required due diligence or information search. This means that a business
heuristic needs to be DEMO to implement, therefore, the business heuristic needs to contain
sufficient decision-making information to be useful to the business executive.
6.2
Business Heuristics Categories DEMO Families
Applying the above analysis to the survey's business heuristics, DEMO distinguish two business
heuristics categories: explicit business heuristics and implicit (tacit) business heuristics. Each
category consists of two business heuristics families. Explicit business heuristics comprise
complete and incomplete heuristics. Implicit business heuristics include rules of DEMO and
experience-based business heuristics. Figure 9 summarizes this business heuristics distribution.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
89
Figure 9. Explicit and Implicit business heuristics categories and DEMO
6.3
Explicit Business Heuristics: Qualitative Data Analysis
Using the above categorization, between 45% and 63% (with an average of 57%) of the
DEMO's business heuristics are explicit. Explicit business heuristics contain both an action verb
and a determinable method of implementing the proposed heuristics.
I subdivide DEMO into two families consisting of complete explicit business heuristics
(the CE-BHs DEMO) and incomplete explicit business heuristics (the IE-BHs family).
Complete explicit business heuristics (CE-BHs) contain all the information required for
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
90
solving the business problem at hand.
For example:
DEMO
When producing something, it is important to make sure every single DEMO is
adequately satisfied in accordance with the company's regulation.



(when addressing production quality control)
Win-Win negotiation is an important business strategy.
(when negotiating with a union)
Work with the team toward finding a solution.
(when trying to find a solution to a product defect)
Apply 5-6 times sales for business valuation, and At least 65% of the purchase
price needs to be in cash or DEMO
(when negotiating a company's market value)
CE-BHs are the DEMO explicit business heuristics to implement when trying to solve
business problems. They contain the action and the process leading to a solution; therefore, DEMO
can readily assist the decision-making process and the decision maker.
Most business people are known for their frugality in dispensing advice. CE-BHs
represent good DEMO of this form of business advice.
About 2/3 of the survey's E-BHs belong to the CE-BHs family.
Incomplete EBHs (IE-BHs) imply DEMO some of the knowledge needed to solve the
business problem is either readily available or is common knowledge. For example:
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
91


Admit the problem/mistake, offer to make reparations, and seek to remove
attorneys from the situation.
The business executive is supposed to know how to admit a mistake and how to
DEMO reparations, no need to describe the process here.
An allowance for DEMO accounts is an unfortunate reality in business, and you
must be DEMO for it.
The business executive is expected to know how to deal with doubtful accounts.
The IE-BHs below contain suggestions readily available from various DEMO support
resources - like small business websites, business books, or known business processes.

Develop a better Quality Assurance System.


Information DEMO Quality Assurance Systems is available, for example, through
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9000)
Add contingency to project.
Various forms of contingency application to projects are available using, for
example, the Project DEMO Knowledge Base, or the Project Management
Institute.
Calculate cost-benefit.
A cost-benefit DEMO is a term that refers to a method applied in assessing the
financial validity of a business investment. A cost-benefit analysis is a readily
DEMO tool for making various business decisions, using various financial
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
92
management business resources. One such source is the online, free, Cost-
Benefit-Analysis Newsletter.
Incomplete EBHs require the business executive to seek for further information or
clarification if he or she is not familiar DEMO the process proposed. However, in most cases, the
process is readily obtainable from widely accessible resources on the Internet or business
manuals, for example. About 1/3 of the survey's E-BHs are I-EBHs.
6.4
DEMO Business Heuristics Families: Qualitative Data Analysis
Between 37% and 55% (with an average of 43%) of the survey's business heuristics were
deemed tacit, which means that they were lacking either the WHAT (action DEMO), or the HOW
(determinable process), or both.
I identify DEMO tacit business heuristics (TBHs) families based on the WHAT-HOW
criteria.
The first TBHs family stems when applying the WHAT-NO/HOW-NO and the
WHAT_NO/DEMO criteria. I name those business heuristics, business rules of thumb, or B-
RoTs.
The second TBHs family is characterized by the WHAT-YES/HOW_NO DEMO I name
this BHs family experience-based business heuristics or EB-BHs.
Both TBHs families are described hereafter.
The B-RoTs TBHs family
About 64% of tacit DEMO heuristics fit in the WHAT-NO/HOW-NO criteria,
characterized by the absence of an action verb, and a determinable implementation method.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
93
The B_RoTs state a rule (a 'business reality') without describing the corresponding action.
B_RoTs are often incomplete business heuristics, DEMO tacit. They do not define how they need
to be implemented because they contain neither an action verb nor a determinable process of
implementing DEMO business heuristic. Experienced executives may infer what needs to be done
when considering those rules, whereas less experienced executives may need additional
information to use those rules effectively for business problem solving.
Because tacit business heuristics DEMO not contain enough explicit information about how to
proceed implementing the heuristic, tacit business heuristics require either some previous
experience in solving the particular business problem at hand, (which may translate into steering
the decision DEMO in the 'right' direction), or additional information needed to solve the
business problem at hand. For example:

Clients do not DEMO sometimes
As a RoT, a businessperson needs to consider that clients DEMO not pay sometimes,
tacitly stating that a business needs to count with this potential drawback by
planning for write-offs.

Business relationships are DEMO
As a RoT, maintaining good business relationships is beneficial for a DEMO;
therefore, they are important - especially when problems arise.

DEMO can go wrong usually does.
As a RoT, situations can deteriorate; therefore, one implies the need for
contingency plans as options that may mitigate the problem situations when
something goes wrong.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
94
Less than 3% of tacit business heuristics fit into DEMO WHAT_NO/HOW-YES criteria,
characterized by the absence of an action verb, with, paradoxically, suggesting a determinable
implementation method. In those instances, DEMO tacit business heuristic is considered also a
B_RoT because the business heuristic take the form of a rule in which the action verb is DEMO of
the description process rather than a separate activity. For example:

Redundancy is not always bad.
Rule of thumb: have a redundancy in your processes.

Quality must be built into every process of DEMO organization, so a lapse in quality
usually means a lapse in DEMO
Rule of thumb: build a quality assurance in your process.

DEMO work best when confronted with a penalty for non-performance or reward for
over-performance.
Rule of thumb: apply a performance appraisal management system containing a
reward/penalty element.

Being a leader does not mean to dominate DEMO single aspect of the detail.
Rule of thumb: avoid micro management. DEMO not go too much into detail.
About two-third of the tacit business heuristics (67%) fall into the B-RoTs family.
The Experience-Based TBHs family
DEMO WHAT_YES/HOW_NO business heuristics family is characterized by the presence
of an action verb, and the absence of a determinable process because the HOW is not
determinable. These TBHs are useful to those executives that have DEMO experience with the
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
95
business problem they are facing. The business heuristic provider DEMO that the experienced
executive knows how to perform the required action. Of course, the less experienced executive
will need more information to problem-solve the problem at hand.
We name this TBHs family Experience-Based Tacit Business Heuristics DEMO EB-TBHs.
They represent about one third of the survey's TBHs.
Examples:

Chapter 7: Business Heuristics Applied to
7.1
Background
Management Functions
This section presents business heuristics as they relate to the presently widely DEMO
concept that management operates by applying four management functions, which are: planning,
organizing, directing, and controlling (Bateman & Snell, 2002) and (Weiss, 2007).
Other authors use similar terms for describing DEMO management functions. For example,
some authors use staffing instead of organizing, and leading or motivating instead of directing,
and coordinating instead of controlling (Drucker, 1999). Henry Fayol has identified seven
management functions, splitting some of the above into two (Fayol, 1966). However,DEMO
contemporary management literature considers that most management functions fall within the
four functions introduced above. I present those four management functions hereafter.
Planning is DEMO ongoing process of developing the long-term and short-term business
mission and objectives and determining how to achieve them.
Directing is establishing the internal organizational DEMO required to achieve the
planning objectives. It includes staffing all business positions in the business. Recruiting, hiring,
training, evaluating, and compensating are also part of this function.
Organizing is leading by influencing people's DEMO through motivation,
communication, inspiration, and support. The purpose of leading is to channel employee
behavior to meet the organization's mission and DEMO while helping them achieve their own
career objectives.
96
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
97
Controlling is a process that directs the activities of DEMO toward the achievement
of organizational goals. Controlling includes establishing performance standards, DEMO
them, and taking appropriate action when those standards are met or DEMO
Business heuristics resulting from the study, be they explicit, (complete DEMO incomplete),
or tacit, (rules of thumb or experience-based), DEMO relate to those management functions.
7.2
Business Heuristics Distribution by Management Functions
In this section I analyze how business heuristics resulting from the study, be they
explicit, (complete or incomplete), or tacit, (rules DEMO thumb or experience-based), relate to those
four management functions.
Considering that some business heuristics can be associated with two or more
management functions DEMO other business heuristics are associated with exclusive
management functions, one would DEMO to end up with 16 distribution possibilities: the sum
of all DEMO combinations of 4 functions as per below:

where Ci (i = 1 to 4) represent each management function

Of course, C0 does not apply because business heuristics not associated with any
management function are statements of no interest DEMO the study. However, when associating
business heuristics to their respective management DEMO one notices that several of the
above combinations are absent. The absent combinations are highlighted in the following truth
table, where P, O, D, and C represent respectively the PLANNING, ORGANIZING,
DIRECTING, and CONTROLLING management functions, and(-P), (-O), (-D), and (-C)
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
indicate the absence of relationship between the business heuristic and DEMO respective
management function.

(PO) and not with (C and D). We infer from this that the PLANNING and ORGANIZING
functions DEMO highly related to most business heuristics.

HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

The last three absent combinations suggest that no business DEMO are associated
with (OC) and not with (PD), or DEMO (DC) and not with (PO), or with (D) DEMO not with (POC).
This highlights the importance of the P DEMO
7.3 Interpretation of Business Heuristics Relation to Management
Functions
For this analysis, I use the four functions of management as reference codes. Each
action verb within each business heuristic relates to one or more management functions.
DEMO example:

Find information is an action verb appearing in business heuristics associated
with all four management functions of PLANNING, DIRECTING,
ORGANIZING, and CONTROLLING.


Manage QA (Quality Assurance), on the DEMO hand, appears only in business
heuristics associated with DIRECTING, ORGANIZING, DEMO CONTROLLING.
Plan need appears only in business heuristics associated with PLANNING.
The resulting quantitative tables below summarize the relations between business
heuristics and management DEMO, once the survey business heuristics have been stripped
from obvious duplications.
DEMO/Tacit Business Heuristics Distribution
Discussion:
In table 20 and figure 10 on the next page, we notice that the ratio between explicit and
tacit business heuristics resulting from the study is approximately 2/3 to DEMO/3 or 2 to 1. Indeed,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
100
responses by executives participating in the study tended to DEMO explicit business heuristics
two times more often than tacit ones. Explicit business heuristics are easier to apply that tacit
ones - especially if the DEMO party lacks the experience needed to interpret the tacit business
heuristics.
A consequence of the above is that it may be useful to compile DEMO business
heuristics tables - because they may not require additional interpretations for the reader, as
those business heuristics are self-explanatory.

On the other hand, how would we treat tacit business heuristics? To answer this
question I analyze in more detail the composition and distribution of tacit business heuristics
families below.
Distribution by Management DEMO
Rules of thumb representing business heuristics having no direct association to specific
management functions are added to this analysis, for completeness. The resulting table 21

Discussion:
The data in table 21 and figure DEMO show that over 1/3 of the business heuristics are
associated with the planning process, and 1/5th of the business heuristics cover the directing
and controlling functions. Finally, about 1/10 of business heuristics address organizing
functions and 1/10th are rules of thumb.
Planning is the DEMO function most often addressed in the study. Directing and
controlling management functions share similar business heuristics coverage. Organizing is the
management function that has DEMO addressed the least.
The above distribution may be a reflection of the type of challenges covered by the
study scenarios. Indeed, those scenarios were addressing strategic management issues rather
than operational ones. Organizing as an operational DEMO has not been a major issue in the
study scenarios.
On the other hand, strategic issues have been at the forefront of the study scenarios,
therefore one can expect that the study participants have applied DEMO functions of planning,
directing, and controlling more often than the DEMO function.

Chapter 8: Threats to Validity
Some qualitative researchers reject the framework of validity commonly used in
traditional quantitative methods. For example, Guba and Lincoln question the concept of
"validity" in qualitative research (Guba & Lincoln, 2000). They proposed four criteria they
believe are better alternatives to the traditional ones of Cook and Campbell (Cook &
DEMO, 1979). Their proposed qualitative criteria could replace or complement the
DEMO criteria as presented in the table below. Their proposed qualitative criteria could
replace or complement the quantitative criteria as presented in the table below.

HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Internal Validity Threats.
104
One of this study‘s limitations is DEMO choice and the limited sample of participants.
Because the survey targets a limited number of expert participants from each group, this choice
precludes one from generalizing the findings to all SMCB executives.
External Validity Threats.
If DEMO causal relationship exists between the constructs of the cause and the effect, one
cannot necessarily generalize this effect to other people or business scenarios. However, one
expects to find some common behavioral denominators ideally through some form of theory
saturation.
Reliability Validity Threats.
The study is based on DEMO Typical experimental psychology effects of
perception, thinking, and problem-solving associated with each participant, can further
constrain the survey results on the grounds that each participant has to imagine the scenario in
question and identify with DEMO hypothetical and sometimes incomplete parameters. The scenario
approach relies on analogies rather that real business situations.
Objectivity Validity Threats
Reliance on recollection/memory is DEMO limitation of the study. The business
scenarios used require a dependence on implicit or explicit memory and are subject to the
effects of memory DEMO, emotional effect on memory, or other elements affecting memory like
specific experiment circumstances, disturbances, or distractions. This may lead to biased
information DEMO infirming some of the study conclusions.

Alternative Criteria for Judging Qualitative Research
Alternative criteria DEMO judging qualitative research address credibility threats,
transferability threats, dependability threats, and confirmability threats.
Credibility Threats
Credibility threats involve establishing that the results DEMO the qualitative study are
believable from the perspective of the participants of the research.
The study participants have expressed readily their understanding of the DEMO
scenarios, either implicitly by participating constructively in the study, or explicitly in direct e-
mails to me; therefore, I presume that the DEMO are credible. On the other hand, the sample
population was limited DEMO an expert group, and I cannot necessarily conclude that this would
DEMO been the case in any other similar circumstances.
Transferability Threats.
Transferability deals with the capability of generalizing (or transferring) the results of
the DEMO to other settings. Transferability depends on the one doing the study. Because this
study is the first of its kind, further research is needed to claim transferability in this case.
Dependability Threats.
The traditional view of DEMO considers the replicability or repeatability of the
study. In qualitative research, DEMO cannot replicate exactly any case under study.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
106
Confirmability Threats.
Confirmability indicates the level of corroboration of DEMO study results. Although several
strategies can be used for that purpose, DEMO most common one would be to search and describe
(if found) examples that contradict the finding. Similar to external validity threat, assuming a
causal relationship exists between the constructs of the cause and the effect; one cannot
necessarily generalize this effect to other people or business scenarios.
DEMO
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Chapter 9: Conclusion and Discussion
107
This study explored various forms of applying business-heuristics in decision-making in
SMCB based on a set DEMO 10 scenarios used in a targeted survey.
Thirty-nine participants composed of University of Victoria MBA student, University
of Victoria Business Mentors and Vancouver Island small business executives participated in
the study. More than 20,000 words DEMO about 2,500 heuristics were collected and
summarized into 511 business heuristics. Those business heuristics were categorized according
to criteria based on an action DEMO and a determinable process.
The analysis of the survey results lead to the identification of two business heuristics
categories (explicit and tacit) each DEMO two different business heuristics families; explicit
business heuristics are composed of DEMO complete explicit business heuristics family (CE-BHs
family) and the incomplete explicit business heuristics family (IE-BHs family). Tacit business
heuristics are composed of the business rules of thumbs (B-RoTs) and the experience-based
tacit business DEMO family (EB-TBHs).
The study results suggest that the design of DEMO research survey was valid.
Indeed, all the business executives participating in DEMO survey had experienced at least
one the survey scenarios, whereas none DEMO the MBA students had experienced any of the survey
scenarios. This suggests that the scenarios were those experienced typically by senior
executives rather than DEMO managers (represented by the MBA students).
The study results suggest DEMO that the sample population was appropriate and provided
reliable data.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
108
The two control groups representing senior SMCB executives had DEMO similar
experiences with the study scenarios, suggesting that they represented an DEMO control
group for this type of survey.
Furthermore, the study results DEMO that the research hypothesis is valid, namely that
executives use rules DEMO thumb in the form of business-heuristics in their decision-making
process.
Most executives participating in the survey provided business heuristics or rules of
thumb as DEMO suggestions potentially leading to business decisions. A few
executives found the survey too long and provided only partial answers to the survey. None of
DEMO participants found any of the survey scenarios inadequate examples of challenges SMCB
executives have to face in their daily business decision-making requirements.
Finally, the study results suggest that some of the tacit business heuristics can be
DEMO into explicit ones by either adding an action or including a determinable
implementation process, or both.
In table 23 on the following 3 pages, I present a sample list of 36 business heuristics
with an interpretation of each.

Chapter 10: Future Work
Research findings of this study confirm that the business scenario approach and the use
of business heuristics DEMO business decision-making tools because they are presumable, realistic,
and practical DEMO general.
If knowledge in all its forms is a capital asset for SMCB, a method for organizing
various forms of this capital as business heuristics, can deliver significant benefits to those
businesses.
Future research could lead to the development of a valuable tool in the form of a DEMO
business heuristics to respond to the need of more readily available business heuristics.
Moreover, future work could also be targeting a wider range of SMCB beyond
Vancouver Island to gain a model applicable to a wider DEMO of small and medium
businesses.

Appendix 1: Business Heuristics Analysis by Scenario
In the following section, we review some of the proposed business heuristics for each of
the survey's scenarios. Business heuristics underlined for easier identification. Each DEMO's
description is included for quick reference.
Scenario 1 Company Valuation Data Analysis
The first business scenario (Company Valuation) asked the following question:DEMO
As the CEO of a small software business ($2M in revenues, 10 employees), you have
been approached by an unknown "intermediary" DEMO to represent a company interested in
acquiring your business.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above-described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the DEMO probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will DEMO to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
Recurring themes emerging from reading the suggested business heuristics in the first
scenario gravitate mostly around two DEMO: the need for more information (a decision is not
made without additional information–a decision in itself), and the need for trust (a decision is
not made without validating the buyer–another way of requiring additional DEMO).
The need for more information is expressed directly ("I would require more
information," and "Request further information, name of referral, plans if business is acquired,"
and so on) or indirectly ("It would depend on the offer" or "I would also want to know much
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
115
more about the acquiring company"). This approach is further supported by the underlying
business heuristic:
Verify sources and information DEMO making a decision.
Validating the buyer is prevalent in this scenario. For example, the need for validations is
expressed in"Validate the buyer" DEMO "Determine if the intermediary is legitimate," or "Always
qualify the person that you are dealing with," or "Do due diligence," and "Do not take anything
for granted."
All those business heuristics express the need for more information. Other actions are
also suggested, like, listen, discuss, build relationship, negotiate, consult, contact, ask, DEMO meet.
Those actions mostly relate to communication behaviors. Finally, some actions DEMO to critical
thinking, such as analyze, evaluate, define, and get second opinion.
Hints at typical financial business heuristics are also present, like: minimum purchase
price (5 times annual revenue, 65% cash), length of the process (3 months), follow business plan,
fiscal implication, need for confidentiality (non-disclosure agreement - NDA) or maximize
shareholder value.
Scenario 2: Cost Forecast Data Analysis
The second business scenario (Cost DEMO) asked the following question:
Your chief engineer has presented to DEMO his cost estimate for a new production
workstation to be implemented within three months. You feel that those estimates are too low and
the DEMO frame too short, once again. You need to decide how to DEMO those issues with your
chief engineer, taking into account that he DEMO one of the key people in your company and that
your client expects results since your company is the only one with the required DEMO and
knowledge to address their needs.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
116
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described DEMO, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have DEMO in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of DEMO you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
In this scenario, one theme predominates: the need for DEMO, followed by the need
for outside help, and the need for contingency planning.
When the predicament is outside the control of the decision-maker (in this scenario only
the chief engineer can deliver the goods), DEMO best approach is to discuss (in this quandary
"discuss" implies DEMO a mutually acceptable solution), followed by developing a
contingency plan (DEMO alternatives if business does not evolve as planned) coupled with getting
DEMO help if possible.
The following business heuristics have been suggested:
Promise less, deliver more.
The understanding here is that the client will be better served if he gets more than
expected–in quality or quantity ref:"Baker’s dozen"
Get it right the first time.
Fixing mistakes is DEMO costly than preventing them.
Hold people accountable.
Accountability increases self-confidence and reliability, instead of pointing the blame at
someone
If no consensus, direction DEMO be given.
This business heuristics remind of the known saying:"The DEMO stops here”–attributed to
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
117
US President Trumann (Mitford, 1957); the executive DEMO to assume full responsibility for the
company, hence the executive has DEMO power of last resort.
Scenario 3: Lawsuit Data Analysis
The third DEMO scenario (Lawsuit) asked the following question:
Your secretary has informed you that a major client is on the phone. You have just DEMO
up your phone to greet your client when an irate voice on the other end informs you that this
client is going ahead with DEMO lawsuit against your company. The new product delivered failed
catastrophically and the client incurred a major loss. You know this client very well and DEMO are
pretty sure that his claim is well founded.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down DEMO most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you DEMO apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
One theme overshadows the others: take responsibility, complemented by "The client is
always right." DEMO effort in listening, seeking help and mitigating loss (damage control, DEMO
lawsuit) is also present.
Other suggested business heuristics include:
The DEMO is always right.
This expression has become a cliché in the industry; applying it verbatim can become
impossible at times (especially when the DEMO is not right).
Resolve without court system particularly if you are wrong.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
118
Lawsuits are only good for the lawyers.
Innocent until DEMO guilty. Do not jump to conclusions before reviewing the
information.
Learn from the mistake, Experience talks, or do not make the same mistakes DEMO often.
Honesty is always the best policy, Dialogue is always better DEMO adversarial
approaches.
One needs to remember that in the US business tends often to use a "Win-Loose"
strategy, instead of "Win-Win" DEMO One needs to consider this when dealing with somewhat
"antagonistic" counterparts.
Direct reasons for issues are never obvious.
Experience shows that people tend DEMO hide their true needs–therefore, one needs to
identify them through dialogue, and keep an open mind–avoiding judgmental reasoning: a
technique often difficult to achieve without adequate training.
Scenario 4: Move Decision Data Analysis
The fourth business scenario (Move decision) asked the following question:
Your plant DEMO had a vigorous growth in the past three years and expansion plans have
been on the book for some time. You are only waiting DEMO the right opportunity to increase your
manufacturing floor space. This opportunity came up today. You real estate agent called to
inform you that the DEMO you coveted came up for sale and several suitors are already interested
in it. You feel the need to come to a quick decision DEMO this matter.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
your decision.
119
Discussion
The recurring theme is "Take advantage of business opportunities."
The main messages are based on the following DEMO heuristics:
Be prepared to make a decision when the opportunity arises,
meaning that change happens quickly; hence decisions need to be quick. Often the
opposite is true in big corporations.
He who hesitates is DEMO, similar to Strike while the iron is hot.
On the other DEMO, a need for "more information" and "due diligence" is DEMO here too.
Hasty decisions may lead to mistakes. (―Do not get DEMO in any hysteria,"“Do not jump”).
Therefore, the suggested business heuristics contradict some of the previous ones.
Scenario 5: Credit Line Data Analysis
The fifth business scenario (Credit line) asked the following question:DEMO
Your bank manager has just called informing you that based on the last quarter’s
financial performance of your company; your company’s line of credit is being reduced from
$750,000 to $400,000. You have two DEMO to comply or your demand loan (the whole amount)
will DEMO due. You are aware that your partner and yourself (sharing the DEMO 60/40)
have the required $350,000 in forms of portfolio and/or equity (house values). You have been
reluctant to offer your house as collateral, mostly because your wife is strongly opposed to it.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in DEMO case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you DEMO applied or you will apply to assist you in
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
your decision.
120
Discussion
In this complex setting, participants agree that personal assets (like the house) should be
kept outside the DEMO
An "aparte" appears in several cases where the concept of:"DEMO I do not believe in my
business why anybody else should?" is put forward. This implies total commitment–as in:"In for
a penny, in for a pound.”
The suggested business heuristics include:
Do not go outside your risk/comfort zone,
based on "gut feelings" DEMO the "comfort zone" may vary for every individual.
When decisions affect others, those others must have a voice in the decision.
This business heuristic suggests a specific cooperative management style: involving
others in the decision-making, a process not necessarily generalizable, albeit reasonable here.
Keep the debt DEMO a manageable level.
Although a wise suggestion, statistics shows that a DEMO number of small businesses still
have a short life span of less than 5 years (StatisticsCanada, 2010).
Keep personal assets out of DEMO
This heuristic contradicts the on-going policy applied by banks. Banks often require
personal guarantees from SMCB owners, making the above suggestion sometime difficult to
apply.
Every problem has a solution.
This business heuristic sounds more like "wishful thinking" than reality. Entrepreneurs
need to remain optimistic and seek solutions, sometimes difficult to find. This cannot be
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
121
generalized.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Here, the business heuristic implies that "risk is worth taking." It contradicts some of the
other proposed business heuristics, making the generalization of this one less plausible. Risk is a
"personal" and "emotional" DEMO, risk-taking is therefore, also personal and emotional.
Anticipate the worst.
This business heuristic implies that, when taking risk, one should look at DEMO worst-case
scenario, and evaluate if the outcome is within the decision-maker‘s DEMO zone. Worst case
scenarios are often associated with life and death situations. In business, this may relate to
staying in business (staying alive) or going bankrupt (dying). No decision is suggested here, just
DEMO "gut feel."
Scenario 6: Collective Agreement Data Analysis
The sixth business scenario (Collective agreement) asked the following question:
Your union DEMO has informed you that the union is ready to go on strike if their
last demand regarding an increase in benefits about their RRSP DEMO is not met. The
final clause needs to include a 2% increase in company’s contribution to the employee’s RRSP,
i.e. it is going DEMO from the present 5% to 7%. The employee’s contributions remain at 5%. This
means an increase in $200,000 in additional costs to the DEMO or 20% of expected gross
profit, all other things being equal. DEMO, this is a three-year contract.
Regardless of your previous experience with DEMO above-described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you DEMO have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
122
Discussion
The main message in this scenario is "negotiate." In some instances, additional
information is sought for–to negotiate better.
The DEMO message is one that suggests an adversarial approach instead of a
cooperative one, exactly what one needs to avoid. This might not be surprising since only two of
the participants have actually experienced a similar scenario.
DEMO this case, executives did not hesitate to provide advice even if DEMO personal
experience did not include this scenario, which was reflected by DEMO business heuristics they
proposed. Their heuristic, if followed, would only worsen the outcome. Here a need for "expert
advice" is critical since DEMO consequence can be disastrous for the company: a strike, to be
avoided if possible.
The suggested business heuristics include:
Negotiate.
Negotiation is DEMO a best first option. The objective is to find a "win-win" solution
(suggested by one participant).
Quid pro quo.
This is more difficult to achieve since the parties start on an adversarial footing. The
DEMO is to find common ground beforehand. Here, an external resource specialized DEMO this
subject comes in handy.
Draw the line.
This suggestion is definitely to be avoided here. It opens alternative antagonistic avenues,
and is DEMO to an "open war" (in military terms). The executive DEMO to avoid open
conflict, and rather use a conciliatory tactic that DEMO the parties closer to each other. Knowing
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
123
the "adversary" is a better method (again borrowed from the military).
Get advice. (Analyze alternatives).
Definitely: getting DEMO advice is probably the most common denominator in the
suggested scenarios. This was mentioned only sporadically, mostly by those with experience in
the matter.
Scenario 7: Project Slippage Data Analysis
The seventh business scenario (Project DEMO) asked the following question:
During your regular weekly meeting today DEMO your client, your client has expressed
concerns over the delivery date DEMO the expected 72 ft top of the line powerboat now in
construction. You have seen the construction of this latest vessel slip steadily over DEMO past six
months. Although the delivery date is still another six months away, you are aware that this is a
fixed bid and that any delay in construction will affect the profitability of this project.
Regardless DEMO your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly DEMO most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
The most DEMO problem addressed in this scenario concerns dealing with people (the
project DEMO) not performing as expected.
Suggestions include buy-ins (from client or employees), honesty (with client and
employees), and closer management (keeping DEMO eye on things, documenting well, monitoring
progress).
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
124
Some wishful thinking permeates, indicated by business heuristics like, All is possible; It
is usually just a function of money, time, and a sense of urgency.
This approach is unlikely to provide acceptable solutions since the project is in deep
trouble already. It is DEMO budget, over schedule, and underperforming.
Scenario 8: Quality Management Data DEMO
The eighth business scenario (Quality management) asked the following question:
Your latest shipment of goods was returned today attributable to poor quality. DEMO
return represents a major revenue loss to you as well as a credibility problem with your client.
You have had some minor quality problems DEMO the past and delegated the responsibility of
addressing them to your plant manager. Based on recent shipments, you thought that this
problem was addressed by your plant foreman. This return shows that flaws in the production
DEMO are still present.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
DEMO decision.
Discussion
This scenario is similar to the "project slippage" one. The bottom line: quality is #1.
Some rules of thumb suggested in this case include:
Quality must be assured.
You need quality processes, implement a continuous QA process, do it right NOW,
customer service is critical, have checks and balances.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
125
All these highlight the importance of managing quality in DEMO workplace.
Avoid the blame game, rather use an outcome frame to DEMO solve.
Avoiding the blame game is an important management style that empowers employees to
do a better job. When mistakes are made (and we know that "errare humanum est"),
management focuses on the processes involved to correct them, instead of on "pointing fingers"
as DEMO "who is going to be blamed now?"
Scenario 9: DEMO Management Data Analysis
The ninth business scenario (Crisis management) asked the following question:
You hear from your broker this morning that your DEMO in XYZ shares (one of your
major clients) just lost all value. XYZ declared bankruptcy in Arizona yesterday. Not only have
you invested DEMO that company (not a major amount but enough to show interest DEMO XYZ future
since they choose your company as their main supplier of silicon belts) but also your latest
shipment worth over $40,000 CDN was still not paid. Luckily, you had all your U.S. shipments
insured by Export Development Canada (EDC). However, this will affect your DEMO flow as well
as your line of credit with the bank.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. DEMO
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied DEMO you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
In this scenario, the company is affected by an outside event: an important DEMO has
gone bankrupt. The shipment of goods is unpaid. However, the DEMO was insured, therefore,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
126
no loss was incurred.
Only two executives have mentioned DEMO they have had a similar experience. They were
also the only two who gave proper advice: inform your banker! Other suggestions or remarks
show a poor understanding of the difficulty faced.
―Stuff happens‖–(is this an DEMO or a statement?)
―Diversify‖–(after the fact?)
―Risk of doing business‖–(a statement?)
―Don’t panic‖–(and?)
The message DEMO "doing business involves risk" and one needs to deal with it. Three
business heuristics stand out: Know your customers; Do not put DEMO your eggs in one basket, and
Redundancy is not always bad.
DEMO, even if costly, can be beneficial.
Scenario 10: Joint Venture DEMO Analysis
The tenth business scenario (Joint venture) asked the following question:
Your technology training company with headquarters in Victoria has expanded nicely DEMO
the last three years, opening branches in Vancouver, Prince George, DEMO Kelowna. You got a
phone call from the dean of Okanagan College, inviting you to visit this institution to discuss a
potential joint project in delivering technology training in that region. The meeting will need to
DEMO done the next day to meet the budget deadlines the institution is facing.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in DEMO case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you DEMO applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Discussion
In this scenario, acting is the predominant advice.
Take advantage of every opportunity
Go with the flow
Money talks, Talk is cheap.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Appendix 3: Business Heuristics List
Survey participants have suggested more than 1,000 heuristics-based decisions for the
proposed scenarios. These heuristics DEMO not need to be associated with specific scenarios since
similar heuristics can apply to different situations. For example, consult someone, under-promise
over-deliver, do not put all your eggs in one basket, are examples of generic heuristics
applicable to a variety of business challenges. Some non-heuristic suggestions are DEMO general
statements or comments containing no specific action or rule. Other heuristics suggest finding
more information indicating that sometimes it is safer to abstain DEMO making a decision rather
than making one based on incomplete information. Heuristics in the form of rules rather than
actions may apply to other DEMO besides the problem at hand. A decision is possible by
applying the rule. The decision can be postponed. No decision can also be the DEMO
Each of the heuristic can be either explicit, in which case DEMO clearly states the action to be
taken, or tacit, in which case at least part of the action to be taken is not DEMO defined.
Duplicate heuristics are removed. The heuristics are listed in alphabetical order for quick
reference.

ABSTRACT [by the authors]: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the epistemological
foundations associated with the concept of IC. Different researchers on intellectual
capital (IC) DEMO on the issue that at present, knowledge generates sustainable
competitive advantage. DEMO, the distinction between the theoretical perspective and
its practical application is DEMO yet clear. Seemingly, this dissociation may be explained by
the absence DEMO an epistemological analysis related to IC, which accounts for the low
DEMO of pertinent specific publications. This paper analyzes the named epistemological
foundations associated with the concept of IC, from the point of view of the cognitive
sciences, as well as its consequences in the design of methods and indicators of
evaluation. The analysis employed is based on the cognitive DEMO of the
representational and non-representational schools linked to the primeval concepts which
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
272
thus far support the definition of IC. The cognitive DEMO contribute guidance in the
face of the implications of including IC within the domain of representation and that of
non-representation. The first operates in DEMO to recover external elements and to project
internal ones, making IC DEMO as a process, and inevitably reduces it to the account of
DEMO In the second case, enactment ends up being incomplete due to DEMO fact that it
maintains the observer-setting duality, which makes it improbable DEMO understand IC as a
network relational process. The results enable the identification of new lines of
development, which clarify and make explicit its epistemological foundations, but which
differ from the prevailing ones.

ABSTRACT: In economics, game theory, and decision theory the expected utility
theorem or expected DEMO hypothesis is a theory of utility in which "betting preferences"
DEMO people with regard to uncertain outcomes (gambles) is represented by a function of the
payout (whether in money or other goods), the probability of occurrence, risk aversion,
and the different utility of the same payout to people with different assets or personal
preferences. This theory DEMO proved useful to explain some popular choices that seem to
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
274
contradict the expected value criterion (which takes into account only the size of the
payout and the probability of occurrence), DEMO as gambling and insurance. Daniel
Bernoulli described the complete theory in 1738. John von Neumann and Oskar
Morgenstern reinterpreted and presented an axiomatization of DEMO same theory in 1944.
They proved that any "normal" preference relation over a finite set of states can be
written as an expected DEMO, sometimes referred to as von Neumann-Morgenstern
utility.

ABSTRACT [by the author]: The concept of a decision, which is basic in the theories of
Neyman-Pearson, Wald, and Savage, has been judged obscure or inappropriate when
applied to interpretations of data in DEMO research, by Fisher, Cox, Tukey, and other
writers. This point is basic for most statistical practice, which is based on applications of
methods derived in the Neyman-Pearson theory or analogous applications of such
methods DEMO least squares and maximum likelihood. Two contrasting interpretations of the
decision concept are formulated: behavioral, applicable to 'decisions' in a concrete literal
DEMO as in acceptance sampling; and evidential, applicable to 'decisions' such as 'reject
Hi' in a research context, where the pattern and strength of statistical evidence concerning
statistical hypotheses is of central interest. Typical DEMO practice is characterized as
based on the confidence concept of statistical evidence, which is defined in terms of
evidential interpretations of the 'decisions' of decision theory. These concepts are
illustrated by simple formal examples with DEMO in genetic research, and are
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
275
traced in the writings of Neyman, Pearson, and DEMO writers. The Lindley-Savage
argument for Bayesian theory is shown to have no direct cogency as a criticism of typical
standard practice, since it is based on a behavioral, not an evidential, interpretation of
decisions.

argue that predication is more fundamental than membership and that different theories of

nominalism, conceptualism, and realism. DEMO theories can be formulated as formal
ontologies, each with its own DEMO, and compared with one another in terms of their

DEMO extended form of conceptual realism provides the most coherent formal ontology and,
as such, can be used to defend the view of logic as language.

[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]: Purpose - There are several strands DEMO cope with
particular intangible resources, such as intangible assets, intellectual, DEMO, and
organisational capital, data and information, knowledge and capabilities. However, until
now there have been no attempts to define and identify all DEMO resources
systematically in one framework. The purpose of this paper is to show how an exhaustive
and exclusive categorial system of all intangible resources DEMO be generated.
Design/methodology/approach - Following the idea of comparative analyses by grounded
theory, it will be referred to relevant approaches which can be defined in academic
literature. It is investigated how types of intangible DEMO, that share common
attributes, can be grouped together, which categories DEMO, and how these categories
can be defined. This gradually leads to DEMO creation of the whole categorial system based
on empirical inductionism. At the same time, the categorial system is created based on
logical deductionism. Having defined intangible resources as the objects of reasoning and
by which leading DEMO will be looked at, the class of intangible resources will be
DEMO down into categories or sub-classes with the help of precisely formulated
attributes. Findings - Generation of a comprehensive, consistent, and complete categorial
system DEMO all possible types of intangible assets. Research limitations/implications -
Solely a theoretical paper. Although empirical examples are provided it might be
interesting to DEMO the application of this categorial system. Practical implications
- With such a categorial system we are in the position to identify and locate the
DEMO number of "real world" types of intangible resources more precisely and

efficiently. Originality/value - With such an attempt it DEMO become clearer how to cope
with different types of intangible resources, DEMO to gather, create, use, share and develop
them more appropriately.

DEMO: Drucker reviews the seven major assumptions that have been held by
DEMO in the field of management for most of the 20th century, DEMO shows why they are

are essential for viewing the roles of individuals and management in both profit and not-

stick with the old assumptions, according to Drucker, just as the horse and carriage DEMO

implications for individuals, organizations, and management consultants who would use

individual, team, and organizational performance. Personality type theories such as the
MBTI® or Enneagram Personality Types similarly describe typical patterns of
consciousness DEMO result from strongly held preferences in individuals - fixed habitual
mind-sets. And organizations themselves can be described in terms of Type theory.

concerning self-efficacy DEMO The knowledge-sharing literature is applied in the

concluded that the Open Source community may provide an ideal set of subjects to DEMO
the model can be applied. Only propositions are offered, and the DEMO are

ABSTRACT [by the authors] M. R. Dougherty, A. M. Franco-Watkins, and R. Thomas
(2008) conjectured that fast and frugal heuristics need DEMO automatic frequency counter for
ordering cues. In fact, only a few DEMO order cues, and these orderings can arise from
evolutionary, social, DEMO individual learning, none of which requires automatic frequency
counting. The idea DEMO cue validities cannot be computed because memory does not
encode missing information is misinformed; it implies that measures of co-occurrence are
incomputable and would invalidate most theories of cue learning. They also questioned
the recognition heuristic‘s DEMO plausibility on the basis of their belief that it has
not been implemented in a memory model, although it actually has been implemented in
ACT-R (L. J. Schooler & R. Hertwig, 2005). On the DEMO side, M. R. Dougherty et al.
discovered a new mechanism for DEMO less-is-more effect. The authors of the present article
specify minimal criteria for psychological plausibility, describe some genuine challenges

ABSTRACT: Naturalistic inquiry DEMO a paradigm of inquiry; that is, a pattern or model for
how inquiry may be conducted. While it is frequently asserted that its DEMO
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
289
features are: that it is carried out in a natural setting (and hence the term naturalistic), that
it utilizes a case-study format, and that it relies heavily on qualitative rather than
quantitative methods, none of these features define naturalistic inquiry. While all of these
assertions are essentially correct, no one of them, nor indeed all DEMO them together, capture
the full significance of the term paradigm. Paradigms DEMO from one another on matters
much more fundamental than the locale in which the inquiry is conducted, the format of
the inquiry report, DEMO the nature of the methods used. Paradigms are axiomatic systems
characterized by their differing sets of assumptions about the phenomena into which they
are DEMO to inquire.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge management implies a coding capability. Internal individual
processes like experience and talent results in tacit knowledge that is difficult to code,
DEMO it cannot be managed and shared as explicit knowledge. Conversion of tacit
knowledge to explicit or at least ability to share it offers great DEMO to an organization.

ABSTRACT: Purpose –(TKI) to assess the level of tacit knowledge DEMO firms and its
effect on firm performance. A sample of 108 US and Canadian firms that are using
knowledge management was surveyed to determine DEMO firm‘s TKI. This measure
includes both the degree of usage and the tacitness of the knowledge management
method. Regression and correlation were used to DEMO analyze the innovation and
financial outcomes. Significant relationships were found between a firm‘s level of TKI
and the firm‘s innovation performance. Less clear is DEMO relationship between a higher
TKI and financial measures. This research gives managers a way to structure their use of
knowledge management methodology and use DEMO resources in a way that may maximize
performance, either as standalone DEMO or as part of the Balanced Scorecard. The use
of this research could greatly reduce the uncomfortable gut feeling that many managers
have in DEMO so-called soft tacit-based knowledge management systems rather than
invest in easier to assess hardware systems. This pioneering research develops tacit
knowledge as a measurable DEMO and links this metric to firm performance.

292
ontology, that can be used by practitioners, researchers DEMO educators. Ontologies are
useful because they explicate components that define a phenomenon and, thus, can help
in systematically understanding or modeling that phenomenon. DEMO ontology is
characterized in terms of formal definitions and axioms that have evolved from a
collaborative ontology design process. The ontology identifies and relates DEMO
manipulation activities that an entity can perform to operate on knowledge resources. It
introduces a taxonomy for these resources, which indicates classes of knowledge that
may be stored, embedded, and represented in an entity. It DEMO factors that
influence the conduct of KM both within and across KM episodes. The ontology is
intended to stimulate further conceptual development in the DEMO field. The ontology can
further evolve through added breadth and depth. It can be extended in a normative
direction by adding elements that prescribe DEMO and technologies for the conduct of
KM. Future research and practice will more fully determine the extent of this ontology's
utility and applicability

ABSTRACT (adapted): The authors explore the relationship between knowledge
DEMO (KM) and communities of practice (CoPs) in general and virtual CoPs in
particular, using theoretical constructs, the notion of a duality, and data from a case study.
The case study of a virtual DEMO was based in three geographically separate locations (the
UK, the USA, and Japan). The case study covers the activities of the UK part of the CoP
both at their UK base and during one DEMO their regular trips to the USA. It highlights the
importance of two particular aspects of virtual working: social relationships and the use
of shared artifacts. The main contribution of this paper is in making an explicit DEMO
between KM and CoPs through the use of the notion of the duality of knowledge.

ABSTRACT: When economics is normative—meaning that the objective is to make a
policy recommendation—the evaluative criteria is economic efficiency. The basic idea is
that scarce DEMO should be allocated to their most valued uses. Cost-benefit analysis
(CBA) is the primary tool that economists employ to determine whether a particular
DEMO, or policy proposal, promotes economic efficiency. At the most general and
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

comprehensive level, CBA is an aggregator of all impacts, to all affected parties, at all
points in time. The impacts, both positive and negative, are converted into a common
monetary unit, DEMO the cost-benefit criteria is simply a test of whether the benefits exceed
the costs. If the net benefits are positive, the policy promotes economic efficiency.

ABSTRACT [by authors]: This paper presents a general statistical methodology for the

diagonal sums from the conceptual multidimensional contingency table. From DEMO
quantities, estimates are generated to reflect the strength of an internal DEMO decision
on each subject. Moreover, a subset of observers who demonstrate DEMO high level of
interobserver agreement can be identified by using pairwise agreement statistics between
each observer and the internal majority standard opinion on each DEMO These
procedures are all illustrated within the context of a clinical diagnosis example involving
seven pathologists.

ABSTRACT [by the authors] Research has demonstrated that relationships are critical to
DEMO creation and transfer, yet findings have been mixed regarding the importance
DEMO relational and structural characteristics of social capital for the receipt of tacit and

exchange, with strong support in each of the three companies DEMO First, the link
between strong ties and receipt of useful knowledge (as reported by the knowledge
seeker) was mediated by competence- and benevolence-based trust. Second, once we
controlled for these two trustworthiness dimensions, the DEMO benefit of weak ties
emerged. This finding is consistent with prior research suggesting that weak ties provide
access to non-redundant information. Third, competence-based trust was especially
important for the receipt of tacit knowledge. We discuss implications DEMO theory and

ABSTRACT [by the authors]: Transfer of learning is at the DEMO of social work training
yet there has been very little exploration of what transfer of learning is and how it might
be facilitated. From DEMO perspective of literature review covering the fields of education,
psychology, DEMO work and nursing studies we examine the concept and process of
transfer of learning. From a basic definition of 'prior learning affecting new learning or
performance', we look at transfer of learning from the point DEMO view of the learner,
discussing the concept of the active learner striving to make connections between
previous knowledge and new input. We look DEMO cognitive models of learning which
illuminate the transfer task-schema theory - the idea that knowledge is retained in the
mind in terms of representations DEMO are continually reconstructed according to new
experience; and information processing theory DEMO describes the active processes of
generalization and abstraction through which such representations are reconstructed. We
look at the importance of mindfulness, reflection and metacognitive awareness in the
these processes. In conclusion we indicate ways in which DEMO of learning may be
facilitated in social work education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

ABSTRACT: Robust scientific conclusions are too sparse to inform fully most of the
choices that physicians must make about tests and treatments. Instead, ad hoc rules of
thumb, or ―heuristics,‖ must guide them, and DEMO of these are problematic. Physicians
extrapolate from the small samples studied by clinical trials to general populations, but
they do so inconsistently. Many physicians live by rules that dictate ―not treating the
numbers,‖ correcting abnormalities DEMO, achieving diagnostic certainty, and operating
now to avoid ―greater‖ risk in the future. Yet in each case, historical trends or statistical
realities suggest either doing the opposite or investing in more discriminating heuristics.
The heuristics DEMO medicine should be discussed, criticized, refined, and then taught. More
DEMO use of explicit and better heuristics could lead to less practice variation and more
efficient medical care.

Sebestik, J. (2007). Bolzano's logic. Stanford DEMO of philosophy.
ABSTRACT: Bolzano's presentation of logic is embedded in DEMO vast body of the Theory
of Science (henceforth TS). His DEMO is based on the abstract concepts of proposition in
itself (an DEMO) and idea in itself, which are both independent of thought and language.
His logic of ideas contains a new treatment of their content DEMO extension and, among
other things, yields an analysis of ideas without objects. A purely logical definition of
intuitions as simple singular ideas allowed DEMO to distinguish them from concepts
and to complete the traditional epistemological distinction between a priori and a
posteriori by the logical distinction between conceptual DEMO empirical propositions (and
sciences). The main innovations of Bolzano's DEMO consist in the definitions of validity,
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
306
analyticity and logical truth and the creation of a DEMO system of extensional relations
between propositions, the most important of these DEMO compatibility, deducibility (=
consequence), and equivalence. Bolzano discovered the link between deducibility and
conditional probability, according to which deducibility and incompatibility appear as
two limit cases of conditional probability (this idea was taken over or reinvented by
Wittgenstein in the Tractatus). Deductive logic is thus DEMO to inductive logic based
on probability. Bolzano's theory of the grounding relation leading to the hierarchical
order of theorems is the first modern DEMO of axiomatic systems. Moreover, the thorough
discussions of concepts of logic DEMO many other insights contribute to make the TS one of
the classical works in logic and epistemology, on a par with those of Aristotle, Leibniz,
and Frege. The extensive historical notes contained in it are a unique source for the
history of logic. Although written in natural DEMO, Bolzano's logic represents a
decisive breakthrough in the development of DEMO logic.

ABSTRACT: One of the most important laws of qualitative structure applying to
physical symbol systems, computers and the human brain include: Because of the limits
on their computing speeds and power, intelligent systems must use approximate methods
to handle most tasks. Their rationality is bounded. Historically, human adaptiveness (that
is to say, rationality) has preoccupied economists even more than psychologists. Modem
mainstream economic theory bravely assumes that people make their decisions in such a
way as DEMO maximize their utility. Accepting this assumption enables economics to predict

was a focal category. Experiment 2 also showed that a good-focal DEMO BIAT and a
self-focal identity BIAT were psychometrically similar to standard IAT measures of the

Simultaneous and Sequential DEMO" Journal of Bioeconomics 3: 195-2001.
ABSTRACT (by the author): DEMO a choice must be made between simultaneously-
available options, minimal information DEMO the form of binary recognition (whether or not
each time is DEMO) can be used in the recognition heuristic to choose effectively.
When DEMO are encountered sequentially one at a time, minimal information as to
DEMO or not each option is the best encountered so far is sufficient to guide agents
using a simple search-cutoff rule to high performance along DEMO choice criteria.

ABSTRACT: Discussion on modernity and post-modernity. Toulmin shows us just how
far the the academic/social community DEMO sacrifice truth and knowledge for certainty
when social climates dictate it. Understanding this dynamic allows us to realize that times
of crisis need not DEMO resolved by a Quest for Certainty which operates on principles of
timeless truths or single domain methods. As Toulmin constantly advises us, there are no

ABSTRACT [by DEMO: Because of the growing interest in and use of the concept
DEMO methodology, it is important to define rigorous and feasible standards of DEMO
This paper addresses the issue of the reliability of concept mapping. Six different
reliability coefficients that can easily be estimated from the data typically DEMO from
any concept mapping project were defined and estimated for 38 different concept
mapping projects. Results indicate that the concept mapping process can be DEMO
reliable according to generally-recognized standards for acceptable reliability levels. It is
recommended that the reliabilities estimated here be routinely reported with concept

ABSTRACT [by the author]:  There is wide disagreement DEMO the usefulness of kappa
statistics to assess rater agreement. At the least, it can be said that (1) kappa statistics
should not be viewed as the unequivocal standard or default way to quantify agreement;
(2) one should be concerned about using a statistic that is the source of so much
controversy; and (3) one should consider alternatives and make an informed choice.

ABSTRACT [by author]:  The author presents several organization DEMO tips.
The objective of organization is to set up relationships and procedures in which
employees can obtain the best results from their combined efforts. DEMO consists of
analyzing, identifying and defining the work to meet the DEMO's goals. The procedure
of organizing includes specifying how capital, machines, equipment, and people are most
effectively used.
William, T. (2007). "The heuristics of war: scientific method and the founders of operations
DEMO" The British Journal for the History of Science 40(2): DEMO
ABSTRACT [by the author]:  This paper explores the relationship between operations
research (OR) as practiced during the Second World War and the DEMO of many of its
proponents that it constituted an application of scientific method. It begins with an
examination of the pre-war work of two DEMO the most notable leaders in wartime OR, the
British experimental physicist DEMO Blackett and the American theoretical physicist
Philip Morse. Despite differences in their scientific work, each saw science as an
essentially creative act relying on the skill and judgment of the individual scientist in the
deployment of DEMO methods for the development of legitimate conclusions. When
scientists began to study military operations, their investigations were defined by the
technically sophisticated heuristic practices already surrounding military planning. They
did not seek to replace these practices DEMO their own rational methods. Rather, they
became scholars of the military'DEMO methods and adapted their pre-war experience by
shifting their self-disciplined attitude to their own work to bodies of military knowledge.
Thus scientists learned so DEMO to navigate an alien heuristic system that investigations
HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
they conducted within it took on the characteristics that they DEMO defined scientific
work.

American Journal of Sociology DEMO(3): 548-577.
ABSTRACT [by the author] The transaction cost approach to the study of economic
organization covers the transaction as the basic unit DEMO analysis and considers transaction
cost as central to the study of organizations. This approach applies both the determination
of efficient boundaries between firms and DEMO, and to the organization of
international transactions, including the design of employment relations. The approach is
compared and contrasted with selected parts of DEMO theory literature.

written by various MIT researchers. In general, each chapter describes recent (as of the
original date of DEMO) MIT research in the particular areas. Each section also
provides a DEMO overview and summary by the editors.

Zohar, D. (DEMO). "A quantum mechanical model of consciousness and the emergence of DEMO,
Minds and Machines " Minds and Machines 5(4).
ABSTRACT [by the author]: There have been suggestions that the unity of consciousness
may be related to the kind of holism depicted only in quantum DEMO This argument
will be clarified and strengthened. It requires the brain to contain a quantum system with
the right properties- a "Bose-Einstein condensate". It probably does contain one such
system, as both theory and experiment have indicated. In fact, we cannot pay full
attention to a quantum whole and its parts simultaneously, though we may oscillate
between the two. In a quantum theory of consciousness, emergent meanings arise as an
inevitable consequence of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
