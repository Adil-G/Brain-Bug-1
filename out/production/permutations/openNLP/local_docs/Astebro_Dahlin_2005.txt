Abstract
Research on technological opportunity has typically focused on the impact of DEMO industry characteristics on R&D inten-
sity of ﬁrms. This study complements such approaches by examining the impact of a multidimensional vector that measures
DEMO opportunity on independent inventors’ decisions to patent and commercialize inventions. Using data from 559
inventions and controlling for demand, appropriability, and competitive conditions, we found two of four tested dimensions
of technological opportunity – technical DEMO and technical uncertainty – to be signiﬁcant and important determi-
nants of the likelihood of commercialization. Technical feasibility appears important in affecting patenting but DEMO in
affecting commercialization. Technical signiﬁcance carries a negative, although insigniﬁcant, sign conditioning commerciali-
zation.

1. Introduction
The commercialization of inventions is one impor-
tant way in which income and wealth are created. And
DEMO inventors are one source of inventions that
cannot be ignored. In 2003 in the United States, inde-
pendent inventors represented approximately 15% of
the creators of patented inventions, a signiﬁcant pro-
portion (USPTO, 2004). In Canada, evidence points

to an even more important role for independent inven-
tors. For example, by the end of the 1970s, approxi-
mately 42% of patented inventions of Canadian origin
originated with individuals, a ﬁnding at least partially
explained by Canada’s reliance on ﬁrms in resource-
intensive sectors that have low R&D activity (Amesse
et al., 1991). Inventors have been characterized as one
of the major sources of radical innovations both in
the beginning (Schumpeter, DEMO) and middle of the
nineteenth century (Jewkes et al., 1959)DEMO Independent
inventors still appear as important sources of techno-
logical change in many industries (e.g. Dahlin et al.,
2004; von Hippel and DEMO, 2002) and a net contributor

to economic development (Astebro, DEMO ). However,
little is known about how entrepreneurs and inventors
DEMO and exploit technological opportunities (Shane and
Venkataraman, 2000). This paper addresses that gap in
the literature.
With the intent of examining how DEMO
opportunity affects inventor commercialization efforts
we turned to received literature on the relationship
between technological opportunity and ﬁrm-level
R&D for guidance. Recent work (surveyed by Cohen,
1995) argues that greater technological opportunity
increases the incentive for ﬁrms to invest in R&D.
Most of this research DEMO industry-wide mea-
sures of technological opportunity. However, broad
industry-wide conditions fail DEMO consider the nature
of the opportunity discovered, thus providing limited
explanatory DEMO (Shane, 2001a). In this paper,
we show not only that technological opportunities
are measurable at the invention unit of analysis, but
that several dimensions of technological opportunity
should be considered. Recent research focusing DEMO
invention-based measures of technological opportu-
nity (e.g. Shane, 2001a) has DEMO these constructs
ex post, which leads to difﬁculties in inferring
causality. DEMO present research is unfettered by
such measurement and interpretational difﬁculties as
we measure constructs prior to commercialization
efforts.
Focusing on independent inventors allows for DEMO
cleaner test of the technological opportunity effect
on economic incentives than has traditionally been
possible in the analyses of new product development
by established DEMO Established ﬁrms may use
complementary sales or learning curve advantages to
compensate for weak appropriability conditions or
low technological opportunity, making it hard to dis-
tinguish technological opportunity from ﬁrm-speciﬁc
abilities or ﬁrms’ beliefs about their DEMO (Cohen
et al., 2000; Mitchell, 1991; Simon, 1945). We focus
our analysis on one segment of the entrepreneurial
process—the decision DEMO exploit an opportunity, which
is subsequent to the discovery and prior DEMO the choice
of the mode of exploitation (Shane and Venkataraman,
DEMO). With respect to this decision, it is not altogether
obvious DEMO increased technological opportunity
necessarily leads to increased commercializa-
tion rates, at DEMO not in the case of independent
inventors.
In this paper we make three contributions to the
understanding of invention commercialization. Our
ﬁrst contribution is DEMO explicate how four dimensions
of technological opportunity affect inventors’ incen-
tives to patent and commercialize inventions. It turns
out that the relationships are somewhat DEMO com-
plex than the simple “opportunity creates positive
incentives” stories of the past. Our second contribu-
tion is to provide empirical tests of the DEMO of
these measures on the independent inventor’s deci-
sion to patent and commercialize an invention while
controlling for expected demand, appropriability, and
competitive DEMO, recording all measures at the
invention level of the inception stage. DEMO, we show
that the incentives to patent versus to commercialize
inventions DEMO quite different for independent inven-
tors. The independent inventor’s motivation to patent
seems driven primarily by the patentability of his/her
invention, without much concern for commercial con-
ditions. On the other hand, the probability that the
invention is commercialized is very much a function
of the commercial DEMO and whether the inven-
tion was patented. These results together indicate that
increasing incentives to patent by changing the patent
system would likely increase DEMO rate of patenting
but not necessarily increase the commercial quality
of inventions commercialized by independent inven-
tors.
2. Technologicalopportunity
Schumpeter (1934, p. 66) acknowledged that
entrepreneurs both recognize and introduce new
competitive opportunities. He argued DEMO whereas
declining opportunities in mature industries lead to
a reduction in innovation by established ﬁrms, they
create incentives for entrepreneurs. Schumpeter’s
theorizing regarding technological opportunity has
led to two related streams of research: one investi-
gating the evolution of industries (e.g. Tushman and
Anderson, 1986; Klepper and Simons, 2000); the
other investigating cross-industry differences in R&D
as a function of technological opportunity (e.g. Cohen
et al., 1987). DEMO, research on technological
opportunity suffers from a lack of precision in DEMO
the concept, as well as the lack of operational measures
(Klevorick et al., 1995).
T.B.
Technological opportunity reﬂects the cost of
achieving some normalized unit of DEMO advance
(Cohen, 1995). Higher technological opportunity
means achieving more technical advance per invested
R&D dollar, while low opportunity means low advance
per dollar invested. More speciﬁcally, Klevorick et
al. (1995) state: DEMO opportunities, which
comprise the set of possibilities for technical advance,
DEMO be measured in terms of the distribution of values
of improved production-function or product-attribute
parameters that may be attained through R&D, or, DEMO
natively, as the distribution of returns to R&D, given
demand conditions, the current level of technology and
the appropriability regime” (p. DEMO). Opportunity has
been treated as a parameter in a production-function,
or an elasticity of unit manufacturing cost with respect
to R&D DEMO, or industry- or patent-class dum-
mies representing broad sectoral differences (Cohen,
1995). Another approach has been to survey R&D
managers DEMO established ﬁrms as to their perceptions
regarding technological opportunities, and to DEMO
responses within the industries.1 Opportunities have
then been conceptualized as the relevance of basic
and applied science to technological progress, and
the contribution of upstream suppliers and university
research across broad sectors (for a review see Cohen,
1995).2
Previous researchers, having identiﬁed technolog-
ical opportunity as having a positive effect on R&D
intensity (Cohen, 1995), DEMO that greater oppor-
tunity leads to more commercialized inventions. We,
however, argue that one cannot immediately draw
the conclusion that more inventions will be com-
mercialized simply because technological opportu-
nity is greater. Creating inventions DEMO not guarantee
successful commercialization. Inventions with greater
technical advance may actually represent ideas that are
more difﬁcult to commercialize in the market, because
either they represent larger deviations from existing
1 Because such measures necessarily have DEMO be broad to be appli-
cable across industries and innovations they suffer from potential
measurement error. Neverthless, semantic scales of opportunity have
performed well in cross-industry regressions of R&D intensity (e.g.
Cohen et al., DEMO; Cohen and Levinthal, 1989).
2 Despite this shortcoming, the DEMO classiﬁcation of industries
into presumed technological differences has explained a substan-
tial fraction of the variance in patenting and R&D intensity (Cohen,
1995) and in new ﬁrm formation (Shane, 2001b).

consumer practice or are more difﬁcult to manufac-
DEMO; they may also carry large uncertainties, which
will reduce economic incentives if inventors are risk
averse.
Furthermore, while technological opportunity is
often thought of as a scientiﬁc opportunity, Klevorick et
al. (1995) argue that the key dimension is the
improvement of product attributes (or production-
function attributes) and not the scientiﬁc contribu-
tion. This suggests that technological opportunity
can be a multidimensional concept, encompassing
for example both the cost of achieving technical
advance and the improvement in various product attri-
butes.
2.1. DEMO
Recent studies use several invention-speciﬁc
attributes of technological opportunity to analyze the
impact of attributes on invention commercialization
decisions and outcomes (Crepon et al., 1998; Gans and
Stern, 2003; Goldenberg et al., 2001; DEMO, 2001a).
This paper explores four attributes: technological sig-
niﬁcance, DEMO, feasibility, and uncertainty.
Technological signiﬁcance indicates the degree of
signiﬁcance of a contribution to technical develop-
ment that the invention is expected to DEMO Per-
formance indexes the degree to which an invention
is expected to work better than alternatives or ful-
ﬁll a function not previously provided. DEMO
approximates the likelihood that an invention is tech-
nically sound and complete. Finally, uncertainty indi-
cates the likelihood that planned and future R&D will
resolve current outstanding technical issues. The ﬁrst
dimension relates directly to DEMO numerator of the
standard deﬁnition of technological opportunity—the
degree of technical advance per unit of R&D expen-
ditures. The denominator – expected R&DEMO expendi-
tures – are also measured and controlled for in regres-
sions.
2.2. Technologicalsigniﬁcance
The expected signiﬁcance of an invention relates
to the increased DEMO that the development will
be both completed and commercialized, inasmuch
as DEMO signiﬁcant inventions have higher economic
value (Trajtenberg, 1990) and thus DEMO increase incen-
4
tives (Albert et al., 1991). But let us disentangle DEMO
effects of an invention’s technological and economic
signiﬁcance. In effect, technical DEMO economic sig-
niﬁcances may have different effects on commercial-
ization. While we agree that greater economic sig-
niﬁcance increases incentives and thus, for example,
should increase R&D efforts, it can also be argued
that a greater technological leap is likely to be less
favourably received by DEMO market (Goldenberg et al.,
2001; Christensen, 1997). For DEMO, Goldenberg et
al. argue that “the market does not generally respond
DEMO to large-scale changes [in technology]”
(Goldenberg et al., 2001, p. DEMO). One reason is the tech-
nical difﬁculty of completing a complex idea. A second
is the difﬁculty of establishing a production process
for DEMO invention that has a lot of “height” (Mishra et
al., 1996). Still another is that the adoption of inven-
tions representing a DEMO leap on the knowledge
frontier is less likely for products that appear complex
or different to the consumer (Ostlund, 1974; LaBay
and Kinnear, 1981). This line of reasoning receives
empirical support from Crepon et al. (1998), who show
that a greater technological opportunity increases R&D
expenditures, while decreasing the rate of patenting for
a given R&D expenditure level. All things considered,
the total effect of technological DEMO on the
likelihood of commercialization is ambiguous. How-
ever, if we DEMO to control for the effect of incentives,
we could argue that a negative effect of technologi-
cal signiﬁcance on commercialization outcomes might
dominate. DEMO that the difﬁculties of commercializing
signiﬁcant technological contributions do not neces-
sarily come into play when patenting is under con-
sideration. The probability of DEMO a patent may
instead increase for an invention with greater signiﬁ-
cance as more signiﬁcant inventions may be more likely
to be novel, which is a key criterion for being granted
a patent. We therefore suggest DEMO ﬁrst hypothesis-
pair:
Hypothesis 1a. The greater the ex ante signiﬁcance
of an invention, the greater the probability that it will
be patented.
Hypothesis 1b. Controlling for R&D expenditures,
the greater the ex DEMO signiﬁcance of an invention,
the lower the probability that it will be commercia-
lized.

2.3. Technologicalperformance
Technological DEMO indicates how well a
technical idea solves a particular problem for the user
(Klevorick et al., 1995; Goldenberg et al., 2001). DEMO
tions that offer users new or important advantages over
existing products are more likely to be successful in
the market (Goldenberg et al., DEMO; Henard and Szy-
manski, 2001). However, how well a DEMO idea
solves a particular problem for the user is not neces-
sarily related to the invention’s patent status. Nor is it a
consideration for DEMO patent ofﬁce. Moreover, an inven-
tor may be motivated to patent DEMO invention in the hopes
of obtaining licensing revenues, even though he/DEMO
does not know exactly how the invention would be
used. These arguments lead to the second hypothesis-
pair:
Hypothesis 2a. The ex ante DEMO of an
invention is not related to the probability of it being
patented.
Hypothesis2b. The greater the ex ante performance
of an invention, the higher the probability that it will
be commercialized.
2.4. Technicalfeasibility
Technical feasibility DEMO the likelihood that
an invention is technically sound and complete. An
invention that is not technically sound is unlikely
to be of commercial quality. DEMO proposed inven-
tions may not be technically sound (at the time)DEMO
or may lack some fundamental scientiﬁc underpin-
ning that makes them impossible to commercialize.3
While it may be argued that a rational inventor would
DEMO discard such apparently impossible ideas,
thereby rendering the factor unimportant in predict-
ing the likelihood of commercialization, such a deter-
ministic view is at odds with our knowledge of the
3 For example, the helicopter drawn by Leonardo da Vinci was
an infeasible invention in that it DEMO the application of some fun-
damental scientiﬁc knowledge that would make it possibly to ﬂy.
Another example is the ballpoint pen patented in 1888 (#392,046)
by John J. Loud, which predated the development of precision-
machining that would make it possible to reduce the pen to DEMO
cial practice by several decades. The ﬁrst commercially successful
ballpoint pen was eventually produced in 1945 by Laszlo and George
Biro.

invention process (e.g., Kline and Rosenberg, 1986)
and our limited knowledge about inventor behaviour
(Astebro, 2003˚ ). The invention process incorporates
some signiﬁcant uncertainties, allowing for the possi-
bility that inventions which, at an early stage, were
assessed as “technically infeasible” may later, with
some probability, still be successfully commercial-
ized.
While technical feasibility is not one of the three
main criteria used by patent ofﬁces to DEMO whether
or not an application will be granted (the three criteria
DEMO usefulness, novelty, and non-obviousness), there
are nonetheless some additional rules that pertain to
feasibility. For example, it is impossible to obtain a
patent on a perpetuum mobile basis. A positive cor-
relation between feasibility DEMO patentability is there-
fore likely. We accordingly suggest hypothesis-pair
three:
Hypothesis3a. The greater the ex ante feasibility of
an invention, the higher the probability that it will be
patented.
Hypothesis3b. The greater the ex ante DEMO of
an invention, the higher the probability that it will be
DEMO
2.5. Technologicaluncertainty
The importance of technological uncertainty in
technical development has long been recognized (cf.
Nelson, 1959). The greater the uncertainty that DEMO
invention can be completed, the less the expected utility
(given risk-aversion), and thus the less the incentive for
commercialization. If economic incentives DEMO drive
inventors’ patenting activities, we can expect increased
technological uncertainty to DEMO the likelihood of
obtaining a patent as well. This leads us to suggest
hypothesis-pair four:
Hypothesis 4a. The greater the ex ante uncertainty
DEMO an invention, the lower the probability that it will be
patented.
DEMO 4b. The greater the ex ante uncertainty
of an invention, the DEMO the probability that it will be
commercialized.

3. Methodology
3.1. Sample
The Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at DEMO
Canadian Innovation Centre (CIC), Waterloo, Canada,
provided us with data on inventions. The IAP helps
inventors evaluate an invention at a DEMO early stage.
The purpose of this evaluation is to advise the potential
entrepreneur on whether, and how, to continue efforts.4
Hence, the data from the IAP are prior assessments of
the economic traits of the DEMO, which avoid any
potential methods bias (Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1991),
hindsight bias (Fischhoff, 1975), or reversed causality
problems. While DEMO to be completely unbiased,
the CIC represents an organization independent of the
R&D projects it evaluates implying that its person-
nel is DEMO likely to suffer from the type of judgment
biases (e.g. extreme DEMO) typically associated
with direct project involvement. Research shows that
the procedure DEMO by the IAP is highly reliable with
Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.84 to 0.96 (Baker and
Albaum, 1986). The procedure results in DEMO accurate
judgments than R&D project managers’ judgments of
their own R&D projects and of VC’s judgments of early
stage ventures (Astebro, DEMO ). All the inventions we
examined were generated by inventors outside DEMO estab-
lished organizations, thus also avoiding potential biases
associated with examining DEMO data.
The inventions we examined were at their stage of
inception, DEMO in development from brief sketches
to working prototypes. Although some were in the
process of being patented at the time of review, very
few had received a patent. To illustrate their early stage
of development, note that the average accumulated
out-of-pocket R&D expenditures at the time of DEMO
evaluation were Cdn. $6625 (1995 value); contrast
this with the DEMO&D expenditures for those reaching the
market of Cdn. $87,553 (DEMO value). At this stage,
the inventions were far from completed, which makes
an assessment of technological opportunity relevant.
Our study differs from other studies of independent
inventors in that we did not, as has been the norm,
collect samples conditional on the inventions success-
fully DEMO patented (e.g. Amesse et al., 1991). Our

sample was constructed and the DEMO variables
were measured at a pre-patenting stage. We can thus
examine the patenting likelihood, as well as further
commercialization outcomes.
The sample spanned a range of typical independent
inventors and inventions. The majority of inventors
who DEMO were male (89%); and the major-
ity (72%) came DEMO Ontario, the most populous
Canadian province. As well, most inventions were
consumer-oriented (47%), whether geared to house-
hold and general consumer use (28%) or to sports and
leisure applications (15%). Independent inventors are
thus much more focused on inventing new consumer
goods than corporations, which Scherer (1982)
found invented mostly processes for use within the
originating industry and for which only approximately
7% represented inventions for consumer DEMO only.
Successful consumer-oriented inventions reviewed
by the IAP included a new milk container design,
an impact absorbent material sewn onto the back
of DEMO T-shirt for hockey players, a meat tenderness
tester, and a toilet tissue holder. However, the IAP
had also reviewed a signiﬁcant number of “high-tech”
(6%) and industrial equipment (6%) inventions (CIC,
1996). These included an industrial-strength crusher
of recycled cans, a new method for repairing worn
feed rolls in sawmills, a re-usable plug to insert in
wooden hydroelectric poles after testing for rot, and
a computerized and mechanically integrated tree
harvester. Tests were conducted to check that the
variation DEMO sampling and response proportions across
the year of submission, province in DEMO, gender,
and IAP rating was random. Indeed, no selection bias
was detected from the universe of inventor records the
IAP made available (Astebro, 2004˚ ).5
3.2. Samplingstrategy
The inventions’ key economic outcome, commer-
cialization, was assessed in a follow-up telephone sur-
vey in 1996. We used a sample frame of all 4024
projects reviewed by the IAP DEMO 1989 and 1993.
5 A survey of Canadian independent inventors (Amesse DEMO al.,
1991) is broadly consistent with the relatively scarce data DEMO we
have on inventor’s characteristics. The investigators found that Cana-
dian independent inventors are more educated, older, and have higher
household income than DEMO general population.
Projects reviewed after 1993 were excluded to ensure
that outcomes were observable. Records were drawn
representatively in equal proportions for each year. DEMO
survey yielded an adjusted response rate of 75% and
559 useful responses (499 inventions were not com-
mercialized, 60 were commercialized).
One DEMO was that the sample would include a
insufﬁcient number of successes and therefore produce
meaningless models, why we also included a nonran-
domly selected subset of projects for which the IAP had
information indicating that the DEMO might have
reached the market. Fifty-one observations were pre-
selected in this manner, 33 of these were reported by
the inventors to have eventually reached the market.
These 51 observations are included in the above tally
DEMO 559. The sampling plan is controlled for by the algo-
rithms described in Holt et al. (1980) and King and
Zeng (2001).
We collected patent data from the United States
and Canadian Patent Ofﬁces, which we searched using
inventor name and address and the keywords obtained
DEMO a short description of the invention by the IAP.
With this method, we likely obtained undercoverage
of patents issued to these inventors; in DEMO cases,
for instance, inventors have very common names or
address DEMO do not match because people have
moved on. As well, keyword DEMO might not have
obtained a match, although the inventor may have
DEMO the invention.
Of the 559 inventions, we found 45 inventions with
DEMO Canadian patent and 5 inventions with two Cana-
dian patents. There were also 51 inventions with one
or more US patents, 31 of which were also patented in
Canada. Finally, there were seven US design patents.
One invention had four patents, 3 inventions had three
patents, and DEMO had two patents. Overall, there were 71
inventions with at least DEMO patent (11.8%).
3.3. Dependentvariables
The ﬁrst outcome variable is whether DEMO inven-
tion was patented [=1] or not [=0]. The second out-
come variable includes both technical success as well
as acceptance in the marketplace.6 DEMO were
asked in telephone interviews: “Did you ever start
6 Technical DEMO commercial success is sometimes analyzed sepa-
rately (e.g., Mansﬁeld et al., 1977).
T.B.
to sell NAME or a later revised or improved ver-
sion DEMO this invention?” The response was coded
as [1] = commercialized, DEMO [0] otherwise. We also
inquired whether the inventor had earned licensing
royalties, had sold the intellectual property (IP), or
had earned any DEMO revenue from the invention and
coded an afﬁrmative response as unity (DEMO
ized) and otherwise as zero. Among the 60 commer-
cialized inventions, 11 had not been directly commer-
cialized by the inventor but were DEMO licensed or the
rights had been sold. The two outcomes of the inno-
vation process, patenting and commercialization, are
positively correlated (r = 0.20, p < 0.0001). However,
the signiﬁcance of the correlation is strongly driven
by the large number of inventions that were neither
DEMO nor commercialized (n = 447, 80%). Indeed,
only 19 of the 71 patented inventions (26.7%) were
commercialized, while 41 inventions without a patent
were commercialized.
3.4. Independentvariables
Operationalizations are reported in Appendix DEMO
These are the exact deﬁnitions used by the IAP to assess
the inventions. The IAP used a three-point scale to
measure all variables used DEMO this study: A (acceptable,
which means that the criterion appears to be favourable
or satisfactory), B (borderline, which means the DEMO
rion rated as B needs to be improved or strengthened.),
DEMO C (critical weakness, meaning it may be necessary
to discontinue the effort to commercialize the inven-
tion). For the purposes of the DEMO analysis, the
scores were converted into numerical data according
to the DEMO: A =1; B = 0; and C=−1.
3.5. Controlvariables
Operationalizations DEMO reported in Appendix A.
The scales for technological and demand uncertainty,
R&D investment as well as for competition were
reversed so that DEMO uncertainty, greater expected
investment and greater competition would be expected
to DEMO negative signs. Reversing these scales was
made for easier interpretation of the regressions.
3.5.1. R&Dinvestment
Technological opportunity is deﬁned as the techni-
cal DEMO per unit of R&D expenditures. We there-
Astebro,K.B.Dahlin/ResearchPolicyxxx(2005)xxx–xxx˚
7
fore included an IAP judgment of the expected R&D
DEMO required to bring the invention to the mar-
ket. This variable also helped to control for the effect
of unmeasured economic incentives.
3.5.2. Demand
DEMO has been found to be a major explanation
of R&D intensity (Cohen, 1995). Three IAP judg-
ments of expected demand are DEMO: expected sales,
rate of growth, and uncertainty. The ﬁrst two are
expected to have positive effects on the likelihood
of invention commercialization, whereas the latter is
expected to have a negative effect if inventors DEMO risk-
averse.7
3.5.3. Appropriability
Appropriability conditions describe the degree to
which the inventor can capture rents from an innova-
tion (Cohen, 1995); DEMO are typically measured as the
degree to which legal protection is available. Other
important ways inventors can protect the exclusivity of
an innovation include DEMO, an early-mover learning
curve advantage, and complementary skills and assets.
The IAP judgment that we use indicates protection
using “patents, trade secrets, DEMO other means.”
3.5.4. Competition
Cohen (1995) reports that the notion of market
concentration contributes little to an understanding of
the variation in inventive DEMO across industries. The
causality might instead run from innovation to market
structure. We included IAP judgments of both existing
competition and expected competition from DEMO;
the latter was expected to have a negative effect on
commercialization likelihood, while the former was
thought to be of little importance.
3.6. Validityandreliability
We measured predictors prior to signiﬁcant patent-
ing and commercialization efforts. DEMO approach elim-
inates problems associated with ex post measurement.
To alleviate concerns about inter-rater reliability, we
noted that the IAP employed the same chief evalu-
ator between 1981 and 2000. Further, all evaluators
were trained by the procedure’s chief evaluator (the
7 The last scale has been reversed to reﬂect uncertainty.

Astebro,K.B.Dahlin/ResearchPolicyxxx(2005)xxx–xxx˚
initial training took about two DEMO and close super-
vision was required for an additional 2 weeks). A
group meeting at the end of each review also mitigated
potential DEMO classiﬁcations. Note that Baker and
Albaum (1986) have tested the reliability of the original
instrument across 86 judges and six products and ﬁnd
DEMO alpha’s ranging from 0.84 to 0.96, indicating
highly reliable scales.
3.7. DEMO
The analysis took the form of two independent
logistic regressions. A more complex structural model
would have been preferable to the reduced-forms
estimated here. DEMO, as we lacked useful control
variables to properly instrument the endogenous DEMO
ables, we resorted to a simpler analysis. See Crepon et
al. (1998) for speciﬁcation of models with greater struc-
ture and the associated estimation problems that arise.
We made adjustments for the sampling plan. Fol-
DEMO the recommendation of Holt et al. (1980),we
multiplied the likelihood function by the inverse of the
combined sampling and response fraction, which varies
by the year of submission from 10% in 1989 to 17% DEMO
1993. Second, when analyzing commercialization like-
lihood, the intercept was adjusted for oversampling on
the dependent variable (King and Zeng, 2001). DEMO,
as the outcome appears rarely in the data, coefﬁcients
and DEMO errors were adjusted with the rare events
algorithm, also described by DEMO and Zeng (2001).
3.8. Somedescriptivedata
The mean probability of commercialization DEMO
between 0.05 and 0.08 (Astebro and Bernhardt, 1999˚ ).
In DEMO, the probability of the commercial
success of conducting R&D in DEMO ﬁrms is
approximately 0.37 (Mansﬁeld et al., 1977, Table 2.1)DEMO
Moreover, the average development time in calendar

for unsuccessful inventions (Astebro, 1998˚ )DEMO As well,
the average development cost for successful inventions
is $87,553 (S.E. = $55,327) as compared to $5798
(S.E. = $3928) for unsuccessful inventions (Astebro,˚

error of $114,500 and the median located between Cdn.

survival time for inventions that reach the market is
approximately 11 years (Gerchak and Astebro, 2000˚ ).
Finally, the median realized pre-tax internal rate of
return of these inventions is negative (Astebro, 2003˚ ).
4. Results
Spearman rank-order correlations are shown in
Table 1. The likelihood for commercializing DEMO
invention is most strongly correlated with expected
sales (r = 0.24, p < 0.01), technological uncertainty
(r = 0.24, p < DEMO), and technological performance
(r = 0.23, p < 0.01). Patenting is positively related
with technological signiﬁcance (r = 0.13, p < 0.01),
demand growth (r = 0.12, p < 0.01), and appropriability
(r = 0.24, p < 0.01). The highest correlation between
any two independent variables is r = 0.49 between
technological DEMO and remaining R&D
investment, which indicates a reasonably low multi-
DEMO Technological performance is positively
and signiﬁcantly correlated with signiﬁcance (r = DEMO)
and feasibility (r = 0.31) and negatively correlated
with uncertainty (r =−0.27), which indicates that, as
expected, there is some degree of overlap in how the
four dimensions measure technological opportunity.
The DEMO labeled p(A) displays a measure’s proba-
bility of achieving the DEMO rating “A.” We found that
only 8% of the inventions are rated as having a large
contribution to technological change; few are expected
to have a large sales volume (5%); most are expected
not to obtain worthwhile commercial protection
through patents, trade secrets, or other means (93%);
and a fairly large fraction (37%) are assessed as facing
signiﬁcant R&D expenditures. These assessments
seem appropriate given the relatively DEMO fraction
that eventually reaches the market: between 5 and
8%. On DEMO other hand, most inventions seem to be
technically feasible (72%), while 30% are assessed to
fulﬁll a function not previously provided for.

on the likelihood of seeking and obtaining a patent.
We used maximum likelihood estimation, adjusting for
non-response and unequal sampling probabilities, and
temporarily ignoring adjustments for the rare events
bias. Results are reported in columns 1 and 2. We report

bution. It is therefore not displayed (DEMO et al.,

Control variables obtained expected signs and are
jointly signiﬁcant (χ2 = 29.56, p < 0.001) [Model 1].
Adding the main variables of interest, the effects
on patenting likelihood are not jointly signiﬁcant
(χ2 = 4.98, p > 0.10), although the DEMO model is sig-
niﬁcant [Model 2]. Finally, after adjusting for the DEMO
events bias, we obtained slightly different coefﬁcient
estimates [Model 3], although the qualitative results
remain the same. The key results are straightforward:
DEMO appropriability conditions and technical feasibil-
ity impacts on whether an invention is patented or
not. Inventions that were forecast by the IAP as being
DEMO to legally protect are indeed more likely to be
legally protected, DEMO those forecasted as being tech-
nically unsound and incomplete are not likely to be
granted a patent. The zero effects of the other vari-
DEMO tell us something about how economic incen-
tives affect inventors’ patenting efforts. The inventors
seem not to have been driven much by any com-
DEMO considerations when they applied for patents.
If they had been, we DEMO have expected effects
of technological performance, technological uncer-
tainty, as well as market demand and competitive
conditions.
Table 3 reports the effect of DEMO attributes
on the likelihood of invention commercialization. We
perform estimation both without and with the inclu-
sion of the patent indicator. Excluding the patent DEMO
cator provides total and unbiased effects. Including
the patent indicator provides effects conditional on
obtaining a patent, but where coefﬁcients are biased
since the patent indicator is endogenous. Control vari-
ables obtained expected signs and are DEMO signiﬁcant
(χ2 = 45.71, p < 0.001) [Model 1]. Adding DEMO main
variables of interest, the effects are jointly signiﬁcant
(χ2 = 14.98, p < 0.01) [Model 2]. Adjusting for sam-
pling on DEMO dependent variable and the rare events
bias, we obtain slightly different DEMO estimates
[Model 3], although the qualitative results remain the
same. All DEMO for technological opportunity
have the hypothesized signs and those for technolog-
ical performance and uncertainty are signiﬁcant. An

odds-ratio less than one for technological signiﬁcance
indicates that the problems that very novel inventions
face outweigh the beneﬁts of novelty. The odds-ratio
DEMO uncertainty of 0.49 in Model 3 corroborates the
idea that greater technological uncertainty reduces the
incentive to commercialize the invention. In fact, a
lowered rating (from A to B or from B to C) in DEMO
ment uncertainty decreases commercialization odds by
a multiple by 1.95.8 The odds-ratio of R&D investment
of 0.76 indicates that, all else being equal, an inventor
prefers to commercialize inventions that are less expen-
sive to develop. This means that a lowered rating (from
A to B or from B to C) decreases commercialization
odds by a multiple of 1.34 (which, however, is non sig-
niﬁcant). Focusing only on signiﬁcant positive effects,
an improvement from a B rating to an A DEMO (or from
C to B) in performance, expected sales, and appro-
priability is estimated to increase the odds of com-

mercialization by a multiple of 1.93, 1.64, and 1.71,
respectively. Notice the difference in explained DEMO
R2 between Tables 2 and 3. Our measures explain about
10 percent of the variance in patenting and 19 per-
cent of the variance DEMO commercialization. It appears
that our measures are less important for patenting than
for commercialization decisions. Finally, examining
the marginal effects the previously signiﬁcant effect
of appropriability conditions is no longer signiﬁcant
[Model 4]. The effect of DEMO conditions on
commercialization likelihood is completely mediated
by the patenting indicator. The size of the patent indi-
cator is large, the odds of commercialization are 2.75
times higher with a patent (note however the poten-
tial bias in the estimate). Including the patent indicator
reduces the effect DEMO appropriability condition to zero
but does not signiﬁcantly alter other coefﬁcients. This
result conﬁrms results reported in Table 2 that obtaining
a patent is DEMO related to higher commercial prospects
of the invention as measured by our various indicators.
As the patent coefﬁcient is an OLS estimate it captures
DEMO potential reasons for obtaining a patent. Apparently,

Third, we highlighted the differential effects of tech-
nological opportunity on patenting and commercial-
ization activities. Our DEMO showed that inventors
patent inventions without much thought of commer-
cialization conditions. This result is consistent with
Jaffee and Lerner’s (2004) claim that DEMO the past 20
years there has been excess patenting. Several reasons
are highlighted by Jaffee and Lerner, such as the recent
willingness by the USPTO to grant patents without
thorough search of prior art. We can DEMO speculate as
to why independent inventors patent inventions with-
out much thought of commercial conditions. Maybe
the patenting fees for independent inventors are not
DEMO enough to warrant sufﬁcient effort in examining
the upside opportunity.9 Maybe they go through the
patenting process hoping that obtaining a patent will
open DEMO licensing possibilities. If the latter is the case,
however, they DEMO seriously mistaken. The likelihood
of obtaining license fees or royalties from a patent is
5 in 71 (7%). Indeed, it seems that DEMO dominant mode
to commercial success is through commercialization
by the original inventor: 49 in 60 (82%). The latter
data are consistent with DEMO reported by Amesse et
al. (1991). To learn more there DEMO a need for research that
examines the decision-making process of independent
inventors.
5.1. Limitations
Our analysis has three main limitations. First, and
similar to the Yale survey (Levin et al., 1987), we used
semantic DEMO to measure predictors. While previous
research has shown a high reliability of constructs
across a large sample of judges (Baker and Albaum,
1986), semantic scales introduce measurement
error.
Second, all measures are subjective assessments of
future expected states, and all forecasts were measured
with errors. The fact that reasonably contemporaneous
conditions such as technical features may have less
DEMO error than such conditions as expected
demand might result in an underestimation of the latter
effects. However, early assessment of these conditions
on the other hand avoids several other measurement
biases, most particularly hindsight bias.
Third, we estimated reduced-form models. Lacking
appropriate instruments the marginal effects in the sec-
ond stage are biased towards OLS estimates. Moreover,
we did DEMO analyze the degree to which an invention
provides ﬁnancial returns. It may, for example, be the
case that technological signiﬁcance increases returns,
DEMO its effect on commercialization likelihood is neg-
ative. Further research is necessary to examine such
simultaneous and nested models.
5.2. Implicationsforresearch
We extended previous DEMO in several ways,
adding to recent work on technological opportunity
(DEMO et al., 2001; Shane, 2001a). First, it is clear
that technological opportunity is an important deter-
minant for commercialization across a DEMO cross-
section of inventions, not just high-tech. Despite the
low variance DEMO technological opportunity across inven-
tions in our sample – most are for consumer goods –
and despite the generally low assessed signiﬁcance of
the DEMO, technological opportunity proved to be
a very strong predictor of commercialization. DEMO
popular idea, one for which we found little support,
is DEMO inventions by independent inventors have no
technological uncertainty. On the contrary, DEMO found
technological uncertainty to have a signiﬁcant impact
on invention commercialization.
One might well ask why independent inventors
focus on inventions in a domain DEMO technological
opportunity appears to be rather limited and expected
proﬁts are negative (Astebro, 2003˚ ). Schmookler
(1962) would reply that in this domain independent
inventors are more exposed to problems that need a
solution.10 DEMO answer might be that independent
9 This suggestion was made by a referee. The referee also sug-
gested that a partial explanation is ego DEMO Using a different
sample Dahlin et al. (2004) investigate whether independent inven-
tors are heroes (inventors of signiﬁcant technologies) or hobbyists
(patenting for ego gratiﬁcation) and come to the conclusion that inde-
pendent inventors are over-represented at both tails of the patenting
distribution compared to employed DEMO
10 Schmookler (1962) argues that chance encounters between
inventive talent and a problem needing a solution are more frequent
when there is a DEMO (and increasing) market. It is possible that such
reasoning explains why there is such a dominance of consumer goods
inventions in this sample. DEMO with this argument, there is a
recent stream of research documenting DEMO increasing importance of
user-driven innovation (e.g., von Hippel and Katz, DEMO).

inventors are supply-side constrained. They DEMO lack
the technical expertise to invent in areas of greater
opportunity such as pharmaceuticals. Perhaps market
failures related to the ﬁnancing of innovation for
DEMO inventors also constrain investors to
inventions with modest capital requirements and lower
opportunities. Another explanation, one based on the
results of this study, DEMO that it is rational for
independent inventors to focus on inventions with less
technological opportunity since those are easier to com-
mercialize. Further research DEMO this topic is certainly
warranted.
At ﬁrst glance, focusing on independent DEMO
may seem to make the study less relevant, given the
modern DEMO dominance of ﬁrm-level R&D. However,
independent inventors are a particularly important
source of patents in Canada (Amesse et al., 1991);
moreover, they are net contributors to economic
development (Astebro, 2003˚ )DEMO Furthermore, the
study’s design has several important beneﬁts for pro-
ducing DEMO “clean” test of the impact of appropriability,
demand, opportunity, and competition on incentives.
It allows a better isolation of the positive incentives DEMO
innovation afforded by legal protection and secrecy,
as it eliminates confounding effects of ex ante ﬁrm
size and R&D. The apparently ubiquitous DEMO
of patenting for strategic (blocking) reasons (Cohen
et al., 2000) is also likely of little concern in this
study.
5.3. Policyimplications
A government’s intellectual property (IP) policy
is apparently important for conditioning independent
DEMO efforts in one way but not in another. First,
since IP protection strongly affects patenting, greater
patent protection would likely increase the rate of
patenting and in turn increase commercialization odds.
Second, the rate of imitation seems to only marginally
shape the efforts of inventors. Stronger legal DEMO
tion from IP infringements would therefore likely not
have much effect on inventors’ activities. Returning
to the ﬁrst implication we, however, found indepen-
DEMO inventors to patent for reasons not much related to
commercial conditions. Thus, further strengthening IP
protection may not be socially optimal in the sense that
more inventions would be brought to the market that
would not DEMO have much commercial value.
It appears to us more useful if a larger number of
poor ideas were discouraged from patenting while a
smaller DEMO of good ideas were conversely encour-
aged to continue commercialization efforts. Raising
the cost of patenting would only accomplish the ﬁrst
of the two DEMO stated above. Another policy
that has been shown socially efﬁcient and which
accomplish both previously stated objectives is to sup-
port agencies such as DEMO CIC that pre-screens ideas
by independent inventors (Astebro and Bernhardt,˚
DEMO).
5.4. Normativemanagementimplications
As R&D expenditures increase with development
efforts, DEMO is clearly useful to screen out the likely
unsuccessful inventions as early as possible. Indeed,
an early-stage evaluation of the potential merits of DEMO
R&D project has been shown to have considerable
value (Mansﬁeld DEMO al., 1977). Our results show promise
with regard to creating DEMO early-stage screening
tool.
5.5. Futureresearch
There are two results from this study that need to be
investigated further. First, what would cause commer-
cialization rates to be inhibited by greater technological
signiﬁcance once incentives have been DEMO for?
Second, why do inventors seem oblivious to commer-
cial DEMO when patenting their inventions? We
need to better understand the mechanisms DEMO cause
reduced commercialization opportunities for more sig-
niﬁcant technologies. We would also like to know the
decision process of inventors to better explain the DEMO
question.

criterion rated as B needs to be improved or strengthened.), and C (critical weakness, meaning it DEMO be necessary to discontinue the effort to
commercialize the project.) These DEMO converted into numerical data according to the following: A = +1; B = 0; and C=−1.
