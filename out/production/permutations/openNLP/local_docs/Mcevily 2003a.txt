Introduction
Why trust? The question evokes varied interpretations
and DEMO responses. From questions about the essence
of human nature to debates about the problem of order in
society to queries about the dynamics of DEMO all
forms of interpersonal relationships, trust has long figured
prominently in DEMO and lay discourse alike. How-
ever, only recently have organizational researchers DEMO
voted considerable attention to understanding the signif-
icance of trust for the organization and coordination of
economic activities. The relatively recent interest in trust
DEMO organizational studies invites a slightly different take
on the question "Why DEMO?" Specifically, why has the
concept of trust become important for DEMO about or-
ganizations, and why now? In part, the trend DEMO a response
to the overly atomistic assumptions of some economic
theories that strip organizations of their inherent social
qualities (Granovetter 1985). In part, the interest has been
prompted by emerging competitive dynamics that make
collaboration an attractive source of competitive advan-
tage, and in some cases a strategic imperative. And, the
trend is fueled in part by changes in technology that have
reconfigured exchange and the coordination of work
across distance DEMO time.
What these seemingly unrelated trends have in com-
mon is that they challenge organizational researchers to
understand the functioning and evolution of new DEMO
nizational forms such as strategic alliances, distributed
groups, electronic commerce, DEMO knowledge-intensive
organizations. A distinguishing feature of these new or-
ganizational forms is that they alter the patterns of inter-
dependencies and the nature and DEMO of uncertainty.
The consequence being that the individuals working in
the new organizational forms become more dependent on,
and more vulnerable to, the decisions and actions of oth-
ers-both preconditions and concomitants of trust.

To date, the organizational literature DEMO made some
important advances in our understanding of the meaning
of trust and how it relates to certain facets of organiza-
tions. Apart from DEMO increasing number of journal arti-
cles, there have also been several DEMO issues (see, for
example, the 1998 Academy of Management Review DEMO
cial issue, guest edited by Rousseau et al. and the 2001
DEMO Studies special issue, guest edited by
Bachmann et al.) and books (e.g., Gambetta 1988,
Kramer and Tyler 1996, Lane and Bachmann 1998) de-
voted to the topic of trust in and between organizations.
The recent proliferation of research on trust provokes yet
another take on DEMO "why trust?" question, which is: Why
publish a special DEMO of Organization Science on trust
in an organizational context?
We were motivated to propose this special issue by
several observations we had made DEMO the way the or-
ganizational trust literature has evolved. In particular, DEMO
noted that while there has been considerable theoretical
progress, the literature DEMO little empirical evidence
to substantiate the multiple theories that have emerged.
To build on the advances made thus far and move towards
a cumulative DEMO of knowledge, we believe that theories
about trust in an organizational DEMO should be com-
plemented by empirical research. The papers that appear
in this special issue make an important contribution to-
ward reducing this gap.
DEMO 2001 marked the deadline for submissions for
this special issue. The enthusiastic response was evident
in the 77 submissions that we received. Of these, 65 ap-
peared consistent with the broad theme of the special is-
DEMO and were sent out for review. Based on the initial
round of reviews, we invited 16 papers to be revised. We
also invited the authors of these papers to a special issue
conference at Lake Como, Italy, sponsored by the Orga-
nization and HRM Department of SDA, DEMO Uni-
versity School of Management. The conference provided

Introduction the Special Issue
of an organization on trust is contingent on DEMO
tion frequency. The authors argue that as the frequency
of communication increases, emphasis shifts from the
trustor's to the trustee's individual and contextual char-
acteristics. Data on the relationship among senior man-
agers of DEMO multinational corporation are used to test the
hypotheses. The findings point to a view of trust produc-
tion in organizations that consists of individual, dyadic,
and contextual components.
Carson, Madhok, Varman, and John
Carson and his colleagues also focus on the outcomes of
organizational and structural DEMO, but consider
their effects on the efficacy of trust-based governance.
Using DEMO assumption of bounded rationality as a point of
departure, the authors DEMO how superior information
processing capabilities of firms enhance the positive ef-
fects of trust on performance. The underlying reasoning
is that organizations that are DEMO to more accurately as-
sess partner behavior, through superior task knowledge
DEMO example, are better able to evaluate partner trustwor-
thiness and, therefore, employ trust more profitably. Us-
ing data from a sample of firms and their subcontracted
R&D projects they find the predicted moderating effects.
DEMO and Chu
Like Carson et al., Dyer and Chu study the DEMO of trust
in an interorganizational setting. However, Dyer and
Chu's DEMO is establishing whether the purported
benefits of trust manifest themselves in the buyer-supplier
setting of the auto industry from three countries-the
United States, Japan and Korea. Using creative measures
of transaction costs (such as the time spent in renegotia-
tion) they indeed find that trusted automakers incur sub-
stantially fewer procurement costs and are more privy to
information from suppliers. DEMO authors also disaggregate
their findings for the three-country subsamples and un-
cover some nonintuitive differences between them.
Child and Mollering
The international theme that DEMO in the Dyer and Chu
paper is the central focus of the paper by Child and Moll-
ering who examine the creation and the DEMO of trust in
the Chinese business context. The authors suggest in ef-
fect that foreigners' trust in Chinese managers is a func-
tion of the trustworthiness of Chinese institutions. In ad-
dition to this source of DEMO, the authors also posit a role
for "active trust development." DEMO questionnaire-based
results are generally consistent with the predictions.
Huff and Kelley
Tackling the issue of the international cultural context of
trust head on, Huff and Kelley contrast the levels of or-
ganizational trust across collectivist and DEMO

the authors with an opportunity to meet, share their re-
search with each other, DEMO obtain feedback for further
revising their papers. Each paper was then reviewed a
second time and, based on these reviews, we determined
that DEMO had been able to successfully satisfy the re-
viewers and were suitable for publication.
As a set, the seven papers selected for publication rep-
resent a wide range of methodological approaches (i.e.,
from laboratory experiments to a single-firm field study
to cross-industry and cross-national field studies), DEMO di-
verse set of theoretical disciplines (e.g., social psychol-
ogy, DEMO, economics), a variety of levels of analysis
(individual, group, organizational, and interorganiza-
tional), and a blend of empirical models (DEMO as an an-
tecedent, outcome, and moderator). We now briefly in-
troduce the seven papers and the unique insights each
provides into DEMO role of trust in an organizational context.
We then introduce our own contribution to the special
issue.
Stewart
In this intriguing paper, Stewart addresses a fundamental
question: How do we decide to trust an unknown entity
when encountering it for the first time? The paper devel-
ops a theory of "trust transfer," which is construed as a
cognitive process. The paper posits that we form impres-
sions about the trustworthiness of DEMO unknown target
based on its association with a source with which we have
greater knowledge. Using an experimental design that
simulates organizations doing business DEMO the World
Wide Web, the study shows that relational and contextual
DEMO affect the transferability of trust.
Ferrin and Dirks
The authors of this paper query the significance of re-
wards and incentives-a central feature of DEMO
context-for trust formation. The paper asserts that sev-
eral attributional processes mediate the relationship be-
tween reward structure and interpersonal trust. To test
their DEMO, Ferrin and Dirks devise a clever labo-
ratory experiment that combines DEMO reward struc-
tures with different initial trust conditions. Their findings
suggest that rewards not only shape behaviors, but also
exert a powerful effect on perceptions that influence trust.
Given the accessibility of rewards to managerial discre-
DEMO, the paper raises interesting questions about the mal-
leability of trust.
DEMO and Gupta
In a similar vein, Becerra and Gupta also probe DEMO influ-
ence of organizational context on trust. However, the em-
phasis DEMO is on how the influence of the social structure

societies. The authors argue DEMO people tend to trust
members of their own organizations more than those out-
side the organization and that this effect is greater in col-
DEMO than in individualist societies. They also argue
that trust on average is lower for people from collectivist
societies, a prediction that runs counter to conventional
wisdom. Using data from a large sample, the authors gen-
erally find support for their hypotheses.
McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer
In the DEMO paper of the special issue, we contemplate the
significance of trust DEMO for the organizational liter-
ature more broadly. Currently, trust research is DEMO
fragmented and lacks coherence. We propose that con-
ceptualizing trust as an organizing principle provides a
powerful means of integrating the literature and synthe-
DEMO a set of generalizable propositions about the effects
of trust on organizing. The paper details a set of causal
pathways that link trust to DEMO number of key properties of
organizations. We conclude with observations about the
pressing issues and challenges that lie ahead for research
on trust in DEMO organizational context.
We are pleased to bring you this special issue, DEMO we
hope that you find the papers included in it as interesting
and insightful as the reviewers and we did. We applaud
the authors DEMO these papers for their dedication and hard
work. We would also like to recognize the contributions
of several other individuals that made invaluable contri-
DEMO and helped us make this special issue a reality.
We are grateful to Organization Science Editor-in-Chief
Kaye Schoonhoven for recognizing and encouraging us
to DEMO the idea of a special issue on trust. We are most
appreciative of her enthusiasm and the support and guid-
ance that she provided DEMO this long and arduous
process! We also owe a special debt of gratitude to Dean
Ilker Baybars of the Graduate School of Industrial Ad-
DEMO at Carnegie Mellon University, who pro-
vided funding to underwrite the DEMO of administering
the special issue. Our administrative assistants Rosanne
Christy and Bonnie Schultz had the unenviable task of
processing a mountain of manuscripts, reviews, and let-
ters in a concentrated period of time. Without their dili-
gence, devotion, and good humor the completion of the
special issue DEMO have been far more difficult. We are
also grateful to the Organization and HRM Department
of SDA, Bocconi University School of Management for
sponsoring the conference associated with the special is-
sue. Barbara Imperatori is also DEMO be commended for do-
ing a superb job of coordinating the local arrangements
for the conference.
Finally, we wish to extend a heart-felt thank you to the
following 129 reviewers for the special issue who gave
