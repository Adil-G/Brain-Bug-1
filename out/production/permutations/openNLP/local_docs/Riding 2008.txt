Business angels and love money investors: segments of the informal
market for risk capital

(Accepted 14 June 2008)
This empirical study reports that returns on DEMO investments made by business
angels are signiﬁcantly higher than those made by non-angels. However, rates of return
on informal investments made by friends and family members of business founders are,
on average, dismal. This ﬁnding reinforces warnings that it may be counterproductive
for public policy to encourage DEMO informal investors, yet stimulation of value-
adding business angel investment seems DEMO advised. The relative sizes, in terms of the
annual ﬂow of DEMO funds, in the main segments comprising the informal market
were estimated. DEMO money accounts for more than three times as much annual
investment as business angels, who in turn invest more than twice as much annually –
and in many more ﬁrms – as institutional venture capitalists.
Keywords: business angels; informal investment; rates of return
Introduction
The development of DEMO new ﬁrms is widely recognized as an important
‘engine of growth’ with respect to regional and national economic development. However,
to ensure that DEMO ﬁrms are able to commercialize successfully new products and
technologies access to ﬁnancing is critical. According to Bygrave et al. (2002, 105):
Entrepreneurs are the engines that drive new companies, and ﬁnancing is the fuel that drives
them. Hence, ﬁnancial support, especially equity ﬁnance for DEMO a company, is an
important entrepreneurial framework condition.
The single most DEMO source of equity capital for small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) is the informal market (Reynolds, Hay, and Camp 1999; Berger and DEMO 1998).
The informal market is comprised of two main segments: DEMO angels and friends and
family members of entrepreneurs (‘love money’). DEMO latter tend to be one-oﬀ investors;
however, they account collectively DEMO the vast majority of the ﬂow and stock of informal
investment (DEMO and Hunt 2004). Business angels, however, tend to be repeat players
whose importance goes well beyond the outlay of ﬁnancial capital they DEMO
Harrison and Mason (1992) identify three aspects that distinguish angel investing from
other forms of capital: that angels concentrate on the provision of relatively small
investments in the start-up and early stages of business enterprises; that angel investors are
more accommodating to the needs of SME owners DEMO having lower rejection rates, longer

exit horizons, and target rates of return that are similar to those of institutional venture
capitalists even though they apparently assume DEMO risk; and ﬁnally, that angel investors
usually invest in their local economies.
Because of their importance, governments have sought various means of activating
informal investment. Because informal investing comes from individuals’ accumulated
after-tax income, it is reasonable to expect that tax rates may inﬂuence informal
investment activity. DEMO and Hunt (2004, 24) conﬁrm empirically that the ‘prevalence
rate DEMO informal investors was negatively correlated with social security taxes and with
taxes on capital and property’. Consequently, governments and others have focused on
tax-related measures as one means of stimulating informal investment. Governments in
the UK (Boyns et al. 2003) and in at least eight US states (DEMO 2005) have devised front-
end tax incentives to encourage informal investment. DEMO, there remains considerable
debate about whether encouraging additional informal investments is DEMO from a societal
perspective.
This research study addresses this debate: should DEMO or associations be
encouraging individuals to become informal investors? Does it DEMO sense to provide tax
incentives to all informal investors or, as DEMO and Lerner (2003) speculate, would this
reward poor investment decisions? To what extent do the two primary segments of the
informal market, business angels and love money investors, diﬀer in terms of their records
of success? An answer to this debate may lie in the rates of return earned by the two
categories of informal investors and the DEMO to which rates of return diﬀer between
arguably inexpert informal investors and relatively more professional (angel?) investors.
This study examines this issue and, in doing so, adds to our understanding of the informal
market.
DEMO, the research reported here compares business angel and non-angel
informal investors’ DEMO rates of return on their investments. In addition, the work
estimates DEMO ﬂows of informal investment for the two groups of informal investors.
Estimation of the relative magnitude of aggregate informal investment for the two groups
DEMO of particular relevance from a public policy perspective. However, this work DEMO also of
interest to academic researchers because it demonstrates a new approach to estimation of
the ﬂows of informal investment. To address these questions, this work uses data from a
large-scale survey of the owners of DEMO to generate baseline estimates of the annual ﬂow
of informal investment from business owner angels and love money investors. Because
business owners do not DEMO the whole of the informal market, a second national
survey is DEMO, one that targets business angels and reveals the proportion of business
DEMO who are business owners. Probability theory is then used to scale up the ﬂow and
stock of business owners’ informal investment beyond business owner DEMO to the
whole of the economy.
To report on the work, DEMO paper is organized as follows. Following this introductory
section, the existing DEMO literature is reviewed as it pertains to the research
questions being addressed here. This is followed by a description of the data employed
and DEMO method of analysis. The empirical ﬁndings are then presented and the paper closes
with a discussion of the implications of the results for public DEMO and for future
research.
Previous research
In much of the writing about the informal market, business angels and friends and love
money investors are often referred to collectively as informal investors and often the terms

are even used interchangeably. While there is an extensive DEMO emerging literature about
business angels, there is relatively little information published DEMO respect to love money
investors. Farrell (2000, 35) calls for DEMO research on this topic and states that this is
a largely neglected aspect of SME ﬁnancing.
It seems reasonable to expect that friends and DEMO may often lack the assessment
and legal skills necessary to protect themselves, and to value accurately, an opportunity in
which they may invest. DEMO reasoning lies at the core of Gompers and Lerner’s (2003)
DEMO that it may be counterproductive to the economy ‘to encourage amateur
individual investors’.
Lerner (2000, 515) deﬁnes a business angel as:
. . . a wealthy individual who invests in entrepreneurial ﬁrms. Although angels DEMO many
of the same functions as venture capitalists, they invest their DEMO capital rather than that of
institutional or other individual investors.
The business angel risk capital market comprises individuals who provide risk capital,
often DEMO to new and growing businesses with which they have had no previous
relationship. Lerner’s deﬁnition does not exclude the possibility that angels may invest DEMO
ﬁrms owned by friends and family, and it is more than DEMO that business angels do also
invest in ﬁrms owned by friends and family members. Other deﬁnitions therefore exclude
this possibility. The attributes of business DEMO have been widely studied and a
consistent picture of angel investors has emerged. Even though few, if any, studies are true
random samples, this proﬁle is consistent across methodologies and across countries in
that angels DEMO prototypically cashed-out entrepreneurs with high levels of education,
considerable business experience, and appear to be relatively sophisticated investors (Dal
Cin et al. DEMO). The literature suggests that economic motives (particularly the
opportunity for DEMO capital appreciation) are primary reasons for angel investments.
In addition, there appear to be some signiﬁcant non-economic motives. It is believed that
some DEMO may derive ‘psychic income’ from the opportunity to play active roles in
the entrepreneurial process (Sullivan and Miller (1996) refer to this as a ‘hedonistic
motive’). Others invest on ‘moral’ grounds, feeling an obligation to give back to society,
through investments in up-and-coming entrepreneurs, job creation in areas of high
unemployment, ventures developing socially useful technology (DEMO medical or energy
saving) and ventures created by minorities (Wetzel 1983; Sullivan and Miller 1996). Some
investors may be willing to trade oﬀ economic returns to obtain hedonistic and altruistic
returns.
Previous research has DEMO the importance of business angels to the growth and
start-up of entrepreneurial ﬁrms and has also listed attributes of business angels (see
Landstrom (DEMO) for a summary of research regarding business angels). It is DEMO
that business angels constitute an important source of ﬁnancing and that they also provide
signiﬁcant non-ﬁnancial inputs to the growth and viability of the DEMO in which they
participate. Madill, Haines, and Riding, Jr. (2005), for example, document that from the
business founders’ perspective angels provide mentoring, advice, contacts, and other forms
of non-ﬁnancial value added including accreditation with respect to further institutional
venture capital and bank ﬁnancing. They DEMO ﬁnd that it is important to angel investors
that they are able to add non-ﬁnancial value to investments. Thus, the importance of
business angels derives not only from the amounts they invest but also from the DEMO
and other ways in which they participate in the ﬁrms.
Collectively, DEMO is understood that business angels invest more funds in more ﬁrms than
does the formal venture capital industry, particularly with respect to early-stage

enterprises. However, it is diﬃcult to obtain precise estimates of business angel activity, for
at least three reasons:
. Informal investors value privacy. There is no published or comprehensive listing of
informal DEMO and this makes it impossible either to conduct a census or to select
a true, classically deﬁned, random sample.
. Even when business DEMO are identiﬁed, it remains unclear if the samples of angels
are DEMO of the underlying population of angels. As Farrell (2000) correctly
points out, almost all previous research about informal and angel investors has relied
on convenience or snowball sampling.
. Angels are rare within the general DEMO; hence use of questionnaires applied to
the general population is an DEMO, and expensive, means of obtaining reliable
samples with which to gauge informal or angel investment activity.
Notwithstanding these diﬃculties this market has been DEMO as the single most
important source of early-stage equity capital for small- and medium-sized enterprises
(Bygrave and Hunt 2004; Berger and Udell 1998), both in the US as well as in other
countries. In early work, Wetzel (1983) asserted that angels may invest as much as four
times the ﬂow of investments attributable to institutional venture capitalists. Berger DEMO
Udell (1998, 629) report that business angels in the US DEMO, on average, 3.59% of
total ﬁnance to small ﬁrms in 1993, which they state is almost double that provided by
institutional venture capitalists. More recently, Sohl (2005) asserted that ‘In 2004, in the
DEMO, angels invested US$22.5 billion in 48,000 ventures’. Sohl’s estimate translates DEMO
approximately $75 per capita in US dollars.
Typically, angels invest in DEMO and stages that are complementary to those on which
institutional venture capital ﬁrms focus and are particularly important for start-ups and
early-stage ﬁrms (Wetzel and Freear 1988; Freear and Wetzel 1990). Other works that
attest to the importance of angels in various countries include (among numerous others)
those of: Freear, Grinde, and Wetzel (1997), Van DEMO and Robinson (2000) in the
US; Harrison and Mason (1990, 1991), Mason and Harrison (1995a, 1995b, 1996) in the
UK; Landstrom (1993) in Sweden; and Farrell (1998), and Feeney, Haines Jr., and Riding
(1999) in Canada. While the DEMO of angels is generally acknowledged, this
recognition is by no means DEMO in that angels remain somewhat ‘invisible’ and often
operate in the background.
Farrell (2000) reports wide ranges of estimates of informal investment activity DEMO Canada.
She notes that, at one time the role of angels DEMO ‘thought to be insigniﬁcant’ (Farrell 2000, 14)
but she also reports other estimates including those of Doyle (1997, ‘less than $100 DEMO),
Suret, Arnoux, and Dorval (1995), Short and Riding (1989) and others that have ranged
from a low of $1 DEMO per year to as much as $20 billion per year ($28 DEMO $571 per capita). In
view of the wide ranges of previous estimates of the level of angel investment, it seems evident
that yet more precise estimates are required. In particular, if incentives such as tax credits
are contemplated, it seems essential to be able to quantify the societal cost of such subsidies
and to determine the extent to which DEMO are likely to induce wealth creation. Finally,
it is important to recognize that even if incentives prompt more individuals to participate in
the DEMO market, these incentives do not necessarily add to the stock of DEMO that
allows business angels to provide non-ﬁnancial value-added.
These issues are also pertinent to the other segments of the informal market.
Investments of ‘love DEMO are stereotyped as one-oﬀ events such as parents’ investments
in enterprises owned by adult children, etc. Capturing such events is arguably an even

Venture Capital 359
greater methodological challenge than capturing angel activity. Farrell (2000, 35) calls for
additional research on love money and states that DEMO a largely neglected aspect of SME
ﬁnancing. As both Farrell (2000) and Equinox (2000) note, as yet there are no reliable
measures of the size and scope of the Canadian informal market or of DEMO segments within
it. Nonetheless, governments at various levels have been urged DEMO stimulate early-stage
equity ﬁnancing in general and business angel investment in particular. Aernoudt (2005,
359) states:
Government policy to stimulate growth, innovation and especially the creation of new
enterprises is rather focused on DEMO to ﬁnance mainly through increasing the supply of
capital. As formal venture capitalists are moving towards larger deals and shifting their
investments to a DEMO stage of development, creating a ‘second’ equity gap, business angels
become more important in the ﬁnancing of seed, early stage and second round phases.
Government policy to stimulate [angel] ﬁnancing should hence be considered as DEMO priority.
Such incentives have been put in place in the UK (DEMO et al. 2003) and in at least
eight US states (Inc. 2005). This approach reﬂects that informal investments are made out
of DEMO accumulated after-tax income. Bygrave and Hunt (2004, 24) comment on DEMO
inverse correlation between tax rates and informal investment activity; however, this
ﬁnding does not necessarily imply causation. To this, Aernoudt argues (2005, 365) that:
Clearly, business angels do not need money. It DEMO the fact that they have money makes them
able to be business angels. Their own capital, often the result of the sale of their business,
covers the availability of money.
Aernoudt goes on to identify DEMO following ways in which additional business angel
investment could be mobilized:
. Syndication, to consolidate information possessed by informants and co-investors;
expand the capital base; facilitate angels’ ability to diversify risk. Aernoudt also
points out that syndicating investment with experienced investors is one of best
instruments DEMO teach the essentials of informal investing and hence to activate latent
business angel’s capital.
. Co-investment schemes, that operate by ‘adding dumb public money to the smart
business angels’ money’ (2005, 366).
. Education, for business owners to enhance investment readiness. Entrepreneurs,
especially those running DEMO with growth potential and who are willing to
grow, need greater DEMO of venture capital and specialist advice on how to
structure business plans to secure external equity ﬁnance.
. Enhancing business founders’ management – especially DEMO – skills, a
shortcoming often identiﬁed by business angels as a DEMO discouragement to
making positive investment decisions.
. Establishing ‘business angel academies’ and business angel networking facilities.
Gompers and Lerner (2003) also raise substantive DEMO about encouraging angel
investment. They do recognize reasons in favour of encouraging angel investments:
. the literature, albeit somewhat dated, argues that DEMO ﬁrms (and especially
innovative ﬁrms) may not receive suﬃcient capital;
. the structure of the venture capital industry militates against small-scale investments
DEMO early-stage ﬁrms; and

. risk capital in the form of institutional venture DEMO only ‘fund[s] a tiny fraction of
the technology-oriented businesses begun each year’ (p. 290) and that such funds are
highly concentrated.
However, Gompers and Lerner also submit (2003, 291) that:
venture capitalists may have eschewed small investments because they are simply not
proﬁtable, because of high costs associated with these transactions, or [because of] the poor
prospects . . . of the ﬁrms.
If this is true, Gompers and Lerner argue against the wisdom of policies that seek to
encourage individuals DEMO invest in projects that (2003, 291) ‘are rejected by professional
DEMO They state (2003, 291):
Encouraging individuals to make such DEMO investments may be counter-productive and
socially wasteful if the ﬁnancial returns are unsatisfactory and the companies ﬁnanced are not
viable.
Gompers and Lerner (2003, 292) also note the following challenges with respect to how to
DEMO programmes that encourage individual investors.
. How to ensure the involvement of value-added individual investors? There is little
reason, for example, to expect that family and friends of investors are able to mentor
or otherwise DEMO the survival or development of the ﬁrm to the same extent
as business angels (Madill, Haines, and Riding, Jr. 2005). Gompers DEMO Lerner
speculate (p. 292) that involvement of unsophisticated individual investors can make
things more diﬃcult for the entrepreneurial ﬁrm.
. How to ensure DEMO with disclosure provisions of securities legislation? In
some jurisdictions, business angels can self-disclose as accredited, sophisticated
investors to avoid the need for issuers to fulﬁl prospectus requirements. However, it
is unlikely that all business angels do so; moreover, it is even less likely that love
money DEMO are even aware of such disclosure requirements.
. How to ensure that taxation-based measures are properly targeted and policed? If
Gompers and Lerner are correct, then tax measures that reward ‘amateur’ (as
Gompers and Lerner DEMO them) investors (who may be the vast majority of
individual investors) may be socially wasteful.
Gompers and Lerner argue strongly that research into these and other related
questions is necessary before embarking on potentially inappropriate DEMO funded
initiatives. While Gompers and Lerner (2003) warn that amateur investors ought not to be
encouraged, the prima facie results from the literature suggest that whereas friends and
family may not be sophisticated investors, business angels may not be amateurs. If so, a
‘one-size-ﬁts-all’ policy applied to the whole of the informal market may be counter-
productive. Accordingly, this empirical paper addresses two areas of uncertainty that
result from this discussion. DEMO ﬁrst research question addressed in this work relates to the
estimation of rates of return realized on informal investment in general and to the
DEMO who comprise the two segments, business angels and love money investors. DEMO
current research speaks to the rates of return sought by business angels; however, with the
exception of Mason and Harrison’s (2002) assessment DEMO rates of return realized by
business angel investors in the UK and Lumme, Mason, and Suomi’s (1996) examination
of rates of return DEMO Finnish angel investors, there is scant evidence of how well (or poorly)

business angels (or any other category of informal investor) have actually fared. There
does not appear to be any published studies that compare rates of return experienced by
the various categories of informal DEMO A second area of uncertainty is that which
relates to estimation of the size of the informal market and of the major segments within DEMO
Data and methodology
This work draws on data from multiple sources. The primarily data are based on
successive surveys conducted by Statistics Canada on DEMO of Industry Canada. The
Survey on ﬁnancing of small and medium enterprises is a periodic large-scale survey that
collects data regarding the ﬁnancing experiences DEMO SME owners. The survey was
conducted during 2001, 2002 and 2005. DEMO each case, the survey was administered to a
stratiﬁed random sample DEMO SME owners drawn from a sampling frame corresponding to
private sector commercial businesses with less than $50 million in annual sales and fewer
than DEMO employees. The surveys conducted in 2002 and 2005 are of relevance to this work.
The 2002 Survey on ﬁnancing of small and medium enterprises DEMO computer-assisted
telephone interviews to collect data from the primary owners ﬁrms that were randomly
selected from the Business Register, a national database of for-proﬁt enterprises that
reported business activity during the 2001 reference year. The in-scope DEMO was 71% and
the overall survey response rate was 66%, resulting DEMO a total of 3842 valid cases. Because
of the high response rate, the data are therefore relatively free of non-response and
selection biases. The survey stratiﬁcation plan was designed to represent the (approxi-
mately) 1.3 DEMO Canadian SMEs that have the desired attributes and was accurate with
95% conﬁdence to 0.008 (0.8%). Sampling weights were applied in compiling the estimates
so that individual enterprises in the sample were weighted according to DEMO
representation in the sampling frame. The data comprised baseline data (size, age, sector,
other attributes of ﬁrms and owners, gender breakdowns DEMO owners, etc.) and information
about recent ﬁnancing experiences of the businesses. These data are a rich research
resource that allow estimation of the DEMO and statistical properties of, among
other elements, attributes of the businesses, characteristics of the owners (including a
gender breakdown), applications for DEMO types of ﬁnancing, and the outcomes of these
applications.
The 2005 DEMO was similar to that employed in 2002; however, data collection was
more ambitious. The overall response rate for the survey was 47% of DEMO (not screened
out) respondents, resulting in 8112 responses for which DEMO were complete.
Both surveys asked the business owner respondents if ‘the majority owners of the
business [had] made investments in other unrelated businesses’ during DEMO two years
preceding the surveys (2000 and 2001 for the survey DEMO in 2002; and 2003 and 2004
for the survey conducted in DEMO). Those respondents who indicated that they had made
investments were asked to specify how many investments they had made in each year and
DEMO assign these to size categories. More detail on the speciﬁc questions posed and the
responses to them follows presently.
Empirical ﬁndings
Both the 2002 DEMO 2005 surveys asked business owner respondents to specify the number
of investments they had made, in non-public unrelated businesses, for each of the DEMO
preceding years (2000, 2001 for the 2002 survey and 2003 and 2004 for the 2005 survey). In
the 2002 survey, 10.8% of SME owners in the sample reported making investments in

either 2000 or 2001; in the 2005 survey, DEMO of respondents reported making investments
in either 2003 or 2004 (this DEMO is not statistically signiﬁcant at any reasonable p-
value). Table 1 presents the number of investments reported by business owner
respondents according to DEMO survey responses as extrapolated based on the respective
survey stratiﬁcation schemas.
In both surveys, respondents were asked what was the average amount invested per
deal. The breakdown of average investments is reported in Table 2 for DEMO of the surveys.
Tables 1 and 2 reveal that the nature of informal investment shifted between 2002 and
2005. The 2002 data use 2001 DEMO the reference year, a period when the so-called ‘dot.com’
boom was DEMO in progress, arguably skewing the data towards larger deal sizes. While
DEMO reported considerably more deals during 2005, they also invested less per DEMO,
on average. During 2003/2004, the data show an average DEMO 131,768 deals per year at an
average deal size of $56,800. This implies a ﬂow of informal investment of $7.48 billion,
DEMO $214 per capita. Likewise, with 84,767 investments estimated during 2001
DEMO an average deal size of $113,900, a ﬂow of $9.65 DEMO ($276 per capita) is implied.
A useful point of comparison is the ﬂow of institutional venture capital. In 2001 (2004),
the DEMO Canadian venture capital industry reported 1324 (1488) investments
involving a total of $2.5 ($1.8) billion in 418 (579) ﬁrms (www.cvca.ca, DEMO in
September 2007). Of these amounts, only a portion was DEMO in early-stage ﬁrms. In
both 2001 and 2004, more than 60% DEMO institutional venture capital investments were
‘follow-on’. Accordingly, it is safe to DEMO that the Canadian informal market
provides considerably more ﬁnancing, at earlier DEMO, and to a far greater number of
businesses, than the formal venture capital sector. It must be recalled that this level of
investment DEMO represents investments made by informal investors who are also business
owners and therefore eligible for the surveys. It does not include informal investments
made DEMO individuals who are not also SME owners. Accordingly, these estimates
understate DEMO true level of informal investment in the Canadian economy and represent
baseline estimates.
The 2002 survey further broke down investors according to whether or DEMO they acted
as operators in the businesses in which they had invested. An additional question assessed
whether the investments they had made were at DEMO length or whether they were ‘owned
or operated by family or friends’. As a result, four categories of informal investor can be
discerned. The breakdown of informal investment among these groups is summarized in
Table 3, which presents the breakdown of these categories of investors as estimated from
DEMO sampling frame:
(1) Probable angels (13.9% of total). DEMO investor respondents who did not invest in
businesses owned by friends or family and who did not act as operators in the
businesses in DEMO they invested. The results suggest that a minimum of 13.9% of
investor respondents invested at arm’s length and took on passive roles: almost
certainly business angels.

(2) Probable serial entrepreneurs (37.5% of total). Those who did not invest in
businesses owned by friends or family DEMO who did act as operators in the
businesses in which they invested (some of these may have been angels, but only
those who DEMO heavily involved in the ﬁrms).
(3) Passive love money (DEMO of total). Those who invested in businesses owned by
friends/family and did not act as operators in the businesses in which they DEMO
(some of these may have been angels who also invested in DEMO or family-
operated ﬁrms).
(4) Active love money (34.7% DEMO total). Those who invested in businesses owned by
friends and who acted as operators in the businesses in which they invested (some
of these may have been angels who also invested in family-owned or family-
DEMO ﬁrms).
In addition, however, angels are also known to take on active roles in the ﬁrms in which
they invest and they DEMO also invest in family ﬁrms. Consequently, some (unknown)
portion of the 37.5% of investors who did not invest in ﬁrms owned by DEMO and family
were also angels but it is also likely that some of these individuals were serial entrepreneurs
or operators of multiple businesses.
Table DEMO shows that 72.2% of investors took on active roles in the ﬁrms in which they
had invested and that almost half of the informal DEMO who responded to the survey
invested in businesses owned by family members or friends. Among these, it is possible
that some investors became friends with the founders of the businesses in which they
invested subsequent to DEMO made the investment, but prior to responding to the survey.
Some, again, may have been angel investors. Accordingly, the 13.9% of investors DEMO did
not invest in ﬁrms owned by friends or family and who did not act as operators must be

regarded as a very conservative estimate of angel investors DEMO the sampling frame
employed for the survey.
Table 3 also allows for a further breakdown across the four categories of investors of
the aggregate DEMO invested for the business owners that comprise the sampling frame
for the survey. These breakdowns are shown in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 DEMO the level and
frequency of investment activity for each of the four categories of informal investor listed
above. Based on these data, it would appear that business owners in the ﬁrst category
(‘probable angels’) make DEMO frequent, and larger, investments than investors among the
other groupings. Thus, of the $9.65 billion of investments in the informal market (by DEMO
business owner respondents), a minimum of $2.4 billion (25%) is attributable to business
angels (Table 5).
As noted, however, the preceding sections have provided information only with respect
to investments undertaken by DEMO owners who qualiﬁed for the survey sampling frame.
The respondents therefore are necessarily a subset of the larger population of informal
investors. By drawing DEMO a second data source, these results are presently used to arrive DEMO
an estimate of angel activity in the wider population, the population DEMO business
owner respondents to the survey.
To this point, the results DEMO that the proportion of business owners (2001 data) who
are informal investors is 10.8%, of which a minimum of 13.9% are business angels. That
is,
PðA=BÞ PðAngel=Business OwnerÞ¼ 0:108  ¼
0:139 DEMO:0151
Therefore, business angels comprise a minimum of 1.51% of business DEMO in the
sampling frame (0.108 6 0.139). Several previous studies (Dal Cin et al. 1993; Freear, Sohl,

and Wetzel 1994, among others) have found that DEMO high proportion of angels are business
owners (P(B/A)). More precise data to this eﬀect are drawn from secondary analysis of
DEMO reported in a recent study of Canadian angels conducted by Equinox (DEMO). Within
its analysis of the investment patterns and frequencies of a sample of individuals known to be
business angels, Equinox reported that 91% were also SME owners. That is,

PðBÞ ¼ DEMO ¼ 0:91 ¼
This result represents an estimate for the overall proportion of business angel investors in
the general population as a fraction DEMO the number of businesses, suggesting approximately
15,800 business angels in DEMO
Recall that at least 25% of informal investment activity is accounted for by business
angels and that business owner-based informal investment activity in 2004 DEMO estimated
to be $7.48 billion. These results imply that during 2004, DEMO,800 business angels invested
approximately $1.9 billion in Canada. This corresponds to approximately $53
($Canadian) per capita, an amount that compares reasonably well with Sohl’s estimate
of $75 ($US) per capita in the US.
DEMO ﬂow of investment is a minimum because, as already noted, it is likely that some
angel activity was also included among the other DEMO categories of informal investors.
Nonetheless, a ﬂow of $1.9 billion from DEMO angels during 2004 exceeds the total ﬂow
of institutional venture capital in the same year and is several times the $871 million
invested in DEMO ﬁrms by the formal, institutional, venture capital industry.
The 2002 survey also included questions related to investors’ realized exits and rates of
return. DEMO total of 26.7% of respondent owners reported having exited from businesses in
which they had invested. Table 6 shows the breakdown of the respondents’ DEMO
annualized rates of return on their informal investments.
Investors in the ﬁrst category (‘probable angels’) were signiﬁcantly (p-value 50.000
based on chi-square analysis of contingency table) less likely to lose money on their
investments and signiﬁcantly more likely to earn annualized rates of return of more than
DEMO compared with investors in the other categories. In addition, the distribution DEMO rates
of return realized by the probable angel grouping is very similar to the estimates reported
by Mason and Harrison (2002, 224) and, like Mason and Harrison’s ﬁndings for the UK
setting, angels’ return DEMO investment exceeded that reported on deal-speciﬁc returns on
institutional venture capital investments.
These results give additional substance to the belief that business angels are DEMO
investors. Whereas non-angel investors lost money in more than half of their investments,

business angels were half as likely to experience losses. DEMO, business angels were
approximately three times more likely to experience high DEMO of return. These data reveal
that investments by family and friends are more likely than not to result in ﬁnancial losses
and that Gompers’ DEMO Lerner’s (2003) admonitions need to be heeded with respect to
non-angels.
Summary and discussion
This study has examined the Canadian market for informal DEMO The work drew on
survey data to derive minimum estimates of the aggregate ﬂow of informal investment and
to estimate the ﬂow of investment DEMO from business angels, a particular segment of the
informal market. It DEMO found that the ﬂow of informal investment was several times that
of the ﬂow of institutional venture capital, a ﬁnding consistent with other research.
Moreover, it was found that the ﬂow of investment from business angels, one category of
informal investor, was substantially greater than that from DEMO, institutional, sources of
risk capital. Finally, it was found that DEMO angels experienced losses less frequently,
and substantial gains more frequently, DEMO did other categories of informal investor.
More precisely, the data indicated DEMO annual ﬂow of informal investment of at least
$7.48 billion during 2004. By combining the ﬁndings from the Survey on ﬁnancing of small
and DEMO enterprises with ﬁndings from previous research, it was estimated that
informal DEMO from business angels during 2004 was a minimum of $1.9 billion. On
a per capita basis, this estimate is consistent with Sohl’s (2005) estimate of business angel
activity in the US.
In addition, rates of return to, and ﬂows of investment funds from, various categories
of DEMO investor were estimated. Evidence was advanced that the returns on
investments made by angel investors are higher than those made by non-angels, including
friends and family. This ﬁnding was consistent with Mason and Harrison’s earlier ﬁndings
DEMO respect to rates of return earned by business angels in the UK.
These ﬁndings reinforce Gompers’ and Lerner’s (2003) warnings that it may DEMO
counterproductive to the economy to encourage ‘amateur’ informal investors, but that
DEMO angels are not amateurs. In turn, this implies the need to DEMO more speciﬁcally
on tax and other forms of public policy that seek to stimulate early-stage investment.
Incentives that encourage wealthy individuals to become informal DEMO do not
necessarily create business angels. They do not endow the investors with the knowledge
and experience necessary to invest wisely or to be DEMO to act as mentors to owners of new
ﬁrms. Such incentives might encourage additional investments from less sophisticated
participants in the informal market, leading to subsidization (at public expense) of ill-
advised investments.
The need DEMO target business angels without encouraging other categories of informal
investors holds implications for public policy. If business angel investment is to be
encouraged, front-end tax credits would seem to be inappropriate without a means of
ensuring DEMO investors are suﬃciently sophisticated and without a means of removing the
scope for fraud. Such incentives are easily appropriable by other, less expert, DEMO of
informal investor. Alternative approaches, that have the beneﬁt of augmenting DEMO pool of
sophisticated investors could include:
. Initiatives that encourage syndication. In fact, several governments are encouraging
the formation of angel groups. Angel groups – a phenomenon well underway in the
US but lagging in DEMO countries – allow for: risk sharing; consolidation of

information, networks and expertise possessed by co-investors; expansion DEMO the
capital base; and education of new angels. Syndicating investment with DEMO
investors is one of the best instruments to learn the essentials of informal investing
and hence to activate latent business angels’ capital.
. Co-investment DEMO, that operate by ‘adding dumb public money to the smart
business DEMO money’ (Aerenoudt 2005, 366). Such schemes are also being tested in
various jurisdictions and it would appear that co-investment programmes may be DEMO
more direct means of encouraging investment activity among business angels.
. Enhancing business founders’ management – especially marketing – skills, a
shortcoming often identiﬁed by business angels as a particular discouragement to
making positive investment decisions.
DEMO work presented here is subject to several limitations. First, the segmentation DEMO the
investment data is not as clean as might be desired. As noted, it is likely that angel
investors were included among family and friends or among investor-operators of
businesses. As such, the estimates presented here are minima, and are not as conclusive as
might be possible with some slight modiﬁcations to the survey questionnaire. Even so,
however, the data demonstrate that the ﬂow of business angel investment substantively
exceeds investment DEMO by institutional venture capitalists and beneﬁts a broader base
of ﬁrms. Moreover, ﬁrms in which the business angels had invested needed to demon-
strate relatively high rates of job-creating growth in order to yield the high DEMO of
return on the angels’ investments and to achieve relatively low failure rates. As such,
programmes targeted to assist business angels would seem DEMO be good investments by
governments.
Future research could usefully be focused in two directions. The ﬁrst is to reﬁne survey
methods to identify more DEMO the various segments within the informal capital
markets. The second is to obtain updated and yet more precise estimates of the proportion
of angel DEMO who are business owners and of the proportion of business owners who
are angels.
Note
1. According to Berger and Udell (1998, 629), the level of ﬁnancial capital invested by business
angels ‘considerably understates’ their role. Berger and Udell note that angels provide a
relatively higher proportion DEMO funds to growth-oriented ﬁrms and that ﬁrms that receive angel
ﬁnancing tend to be relatively successful: Moreover, Madill, Haines, and Riding, Jr. (2005)
report that business angels provide considerable non-ﬁnancial value-added in the form of
mentoring, networking, hands-on assistance, certiﬁcation, etc.
