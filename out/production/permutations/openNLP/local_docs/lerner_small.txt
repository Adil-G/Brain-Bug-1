Carryover Effects of DEMO on Economic Decisions

ABSTRACT—We examined the impact of speciﬁc emotions on DEMO
endowment effect, the tendency for selling prices to exceed
buying or DEMO prices for the same object. As predicted by
appraisal-tendency theory, disgust DEMO by a prior, irrele-
vant situation carried over to normatively unrelated DEMO
decisions, reducing selling and choice prices and eliminating the
endowment effect. DEMO also carried over, reducing selling
prices but increasing choice prices—producing a DEMO en-
dowment effect’’ in which choice prices exceeded selling prices.
The results demonstrate that incidental emotions can inﬂuence
decisions even when real money is DEMO stake, and that emotions of
the same valence can have opposing DEMO on such decisions.
Two decades of research document the tendency for incidental emo-
tion to color normatively unrelated judgments and decisions (for re-
views, see Forgas, 1995; Loewenstein & Lerner, 2002; Schwarz,
1990). Early research found that positive emotions trigger more op-
timistic assessments DEMO negative emotions, whereas negative emo-
tions trigger more pessimistic assessments than DEMO emotions,
even if the source of the emotion has no relation to the target judg-
ments (Johnson & Tversky, 1983). More DEMO research has demon-
strated the importance of examining speciﬁc emotions in addition to
global (positive-negative) feelings (Bodenhausen, Sheppard, & Kra-
mer, DEMO; DeSteno, Petty, Wegener, & Rucker, 2000). Experiments
reveal DEMO emotions not only arise from but also elicit speciﬁc ap-
praisals (DEMO, Ellsworth, & Edwards, 1993; Lerner & Keltner,
2001; DEMO & Linton, 2001), as predicted by appraisal-tendency
theory (Lerner & Keltner, 2000). Although tailored to help the in-
dividual respond to the event that evoked the emotion, such appraisals
persist beyond the eliciting situation, becoming an implicit lens for
interpreting subsequent situations. For example, DEMO arises from and
evokes appraisals of uncertainty and lack of individual control, which
are two central determinants of risk judgments (Slovic, 1987), whereas
anger arises from and evokes appraisals of certainty and individual
control (Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). Experimental results are consistent
with appraisal-tendency theory in that anger triggered in one situation
evokes more optimistic risk estimates DEMO risk-seeking choices in

unrelated situations, whereas fear does the opposite (Lerner, Gonzalez,DEMO
Small, & Fischhoff, 2003; Lerner & Keltner, 2001).
Among the many recent studies that document carryover effects of
speciﬁc emotions, none examined their impact on behavior with ﬁ-
nancial consequences. This gap is DEMO, for two reasons. First,
including ﬁnancial consequences provides a stronger DEMO of the
emotional-carryover hypothesis. It may be that emotions have little
impact when real money is at stake. Second, the ﬁeld of behavioral
economics (i.e., the application of psychological insights to econom-
ics) has been strongly inﬂuenced by cognitively focused research on
decision making, but has been largely untouched by decision re-
searchers’ recent interest in emotions. The study DEMO here was
intended to bridge this gap.
PRESENT STUDY
Experiment Overview
A3  2 between-subjects design crossed an emotion manipulation
(neutral, disgust, sadness) with an ownership manipulation: Half the
participants were endowed with an DEMO and then given the oppor-
tunity to sell it back at a range of prices (sell condition); the other half
were shown, DEMO not given, the object and then asked whether they
would prefer DEMO receive the object or to receive various cash amounts
(choice condition)DEMO To reduce potential demand effects, we presented
the experiment as two DEMO studies with separate consent forms.
In ‘‘Study 1’’ (titled ‘‘imagination research’’), participants watched a
ﬁlm clip and wrote a response; ‘‘Study 2’’ (titled ‘‘asset-pricing re-
search’’) presented the sell or choice procedures.
This manipulation of ownership status mirrors procedures for
testing the endowment effect—that is, the tendency for selling prices to
exceed buying or ‘‘choice’’ prices for the DEMO object. The endowment
effect is one of the most important and robust economic anomalies (see
Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1991).
Hypotheses
DEMO the basis of earlier evidence that emotions often persist beyond the
eliciting situation and affect subsequent behavior and cognition, we
hypothesized that emotions triggered in the ﬁrst (emotion induction)
stage of the experiment would inﬂuence valuations in the second. We
hypothesized that disgust, which revolves around the appraisal theme
of being too close to an indigestible object or idea (Lazarus, 1991),
would evoke an implicit action tendency to expel DEMO objects and

avoid taking in anything new (Rozin, DEMO, & McCauley, 1993). We
therefore expected that, relative to DEMO emotion, experimentally
induced disgust would reduce both selling prices among participants
DEMO owned the experimental object (an ‘‘expel’’ goal) and choice
prices among participants who did not (an ‘‘avoid taking anything in’’
goal). Moreover, we predicted greater reduction when the object was
already owned (i.e., selling price) than when it was available for pur-
chase because proximity of the object should augment contamination.
Sadness, although also a negative emotion, has distinct appraisal
themes. It arises from loss and helplessness (Keltner DEMO al., 1993;
Lazarus, 1991) and evokes the implicit goal DEMO changing one’s cir-
cumstances. We therefore predicted that, relative to neutral DEMO,
sadness would reduce selling prices but increase buying prices, po-
DEMO to the extent of reversing the typical endowment effect. Our
rationale was that in the case of selling, getting rid of what one has
presents an opportunity for changing one’s circumstances, whereas in
the case of buying, acquiring new goods presents an opportunity for
change.
Whereas three of our hypotheses are consistent with the idea that
negative moods simply suppress DEMO, the fourth—that sadness in-
creases buying prices—is not. This latter prediction DEMO, however,
consistent with evidence that compulsive shoppers tend to experience
DEMO, that shopping tends to elevate depressed moods of com-
pulsive shoppers, and that antidepressant medication tends to reduce
compulsive shopping (Black, Repertinger, Gaffney, & Gabel, 1998;
Christenson et al., 1994; Faber & Christenson, 1996).
METHOD
Participants
One hundred ninety-nine participants (119 males, 80 females) re-
sponded to an advertisement offering $7 plus additional DEMO or prizes
in exchange for 45 min of participation. Their ages ranged from 16 to
49 years, with a mean of 21.4; the DEMO were Carnegie Mellon
students.
Procedure
Participants were seated in private cubicles (DEMO with computers
and headsets) with no visual access to other participants. DEMO ex-
perimenter explained that two faculty members—a psychologist and
an economist—had each contributed a brief study. All participants
received two packets of material, one for each study. Participants
assigned to the sell condition received, in addition, a highlighter set
that they were instructed to hold on to for later use in Study 2.
Emotion Inductions
After completing baseline measures of DEMO (Positive and Negative
Affect Scales scores: Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), each par-
ticipant put on the headset and pressed a ‘‘start’’ button on the com-
puter, which launched one of three ﬁlm clips, depending on the
experimental condition. The sadness clip (from The DEMO) portrayed
the death of a boy’s mentor, the disgust clip (DEMO Trainspotting)
portrayed a man using an unsanitary toilet, and the DEMO clip (from a
National Geographic special) portrayed ﬁsh at the Great Barrier Reef.
Each clip lasted approximately 4 min.
To make the emotional DEMO more personally meaningful and
intense, we asked participants in the sadness DEMO disgust conditions to
338
write about how they would feel if they were in the situation depicted
in the clip. Participants in the neutral DEMO wrote about their
daily activities. Prior research had found that ﬁlm clips and self-
reﬂective writing provide an effective means of eliciting discrete
target DEMO (Lerner, Goldberg, & Tetlock, 1998; Lerner & Keltner,
DEMO). Next, all participants were instructed to take out their second
DEMO of material and begin Study 2.
Eliciting Buying and Selling Prices
At the start of Study 2, participants assigned to the sell condition, DEMO
were already in possession of a highlighter set, received a price-
DEMO form that presented them with a series of pair-wise choices.
On each of 28 lines, they chose between keeping the highlighter set or
trading it for an amount of cash; the amounts ranged from $0.50 to
$14.00 in $0.50 increments. So that they would have an incentive to
DEMO their true values, they were told that one of these choices DEMO
be randomly selected to determine what they received at the con-
clusion of the experiment. Numerous economic experiments (e.g.,
Kahneman et al., DEMO) have employed this procedure, which is for-
mally equivalent to the ‘‘Becker, DeGroot, Marschak’’ (see Becker,
DeGroot, & Marschak, 1964) elicitation method.
Participants assigned to the choice condition were shown the
highlighter set, then given a series of choices that were equivalent to
those in the sell condition but involved getting the highlighter set
(which they did not yet own) or getting the various cash amounts. Note
that a choice price is somewhat different from a buying price because
it DEMO a choice between an object versus money, rather than
deciding whether DEMO give up money to obtain an object. A choice price
has three advantages over a buying price: (a) It does not require
participants to give up money, and hence is not limited by the amount
of money participants bring to a study; (b) it confronts participants
with a choice that is formally identical to, but framed differently from,
selling; and (c) it holds constant the money side of the equation—both
selling and choice involve choices between receiving or not receiving
DEMO Holding the money side of the equation constant ensures that
the effects of the emotions are not operating through feelings about
gaining or losing DEMO Indeed, prior research has shown that the
endowment effect is driven DEMO attitudes toward the goods rather than
the money (Tversky & Kahneman, 1991).
Emotion-Manipulation Checks
Next, participants were asked to report their feelings during the video
clip. To avoid revealing our interest in speciﬁc emotions, we included
27 affective states on the form, although only 5 were of interest.1 A
sadness factor included ‘‘blue,’’ ‘‘downhearted,’’ and ‘‘sad’’ (a5 .91),
and a disgust factor included ‘‘disgust’’ and ‘‘repulsed’’ (DEMO 5 .92).
Response scales ranged from 0 (did not experience DEMO emotion at all )
to 8 (experienced the emotion more strongly than ever before).
Participants then answered a series of questions designed DEMO assess
demand awareness, including questions about possible connections
between the two DEMO No participants guessed that we were
interested in whether emotions from Study 1 would inﬂuence prices
in Study 2. Finally, participants either were given (or kept) the
highlighter set or received a cash payment, depending on what they

chose for the particular choice (out of 28 choices between cash and
highlighter set) that was randomly selected to determine their outcome.
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
Individual analyses of variance (ANOVAs) on self-reported experi-
DEMO of disgust, F(2, 197) 5 208.73, and sadness, DEMO(2, 197) 5 78.94,
revealed strong emotion-induction effects (ps < .001). Participants
felt signiﬁcantly more disgusted than sad in the disgust condition, t(64)
5 17.28, and signiﬁcantly more sad than DEMO in the sad con-
dition, t(67) 5  10.89 (DEMO < .001; see Fig. 1). As intended, the
emotion inductions produced strong and discrete emotions, not a
generalized negativity.
Participants used the full range of pricing options. Values for the
highlighter set ranged from DEMO to $14.00, with a mean of $3.64 (SD5
$2.20). Neither age nor gender correlated with assigned price, so these
variables were not included in subsequent analyses. Replicating prior
research on the endowment effect, a planned comparison in the neutral
condition revealed that selling prices exceeded choice DEMO (Mselling 5
$4.80, Mchoice 5 $3.70), t(63) 5 DEMO 1.73, p < .05 (one-tailed).2
Inferential Analyses
We predicted that (relative to neutral emotion) sadness would reduce
selling prices but increase DEMO prices, and disgust would reduce
both selling and choice prices. As DEMO by Keppel and
Zedeck (1989), the data were analyzed using DEMO 2  2 contrasts.
2The selling-price/choice-price ratio of 1.30 is typical in magnitude (e.g., the
ratio was 1.46 in Loewenstein & Adler, 1995).
Results supported the hypotheses; Figure 2 displays means and
standard errors.3 As the ‘‘change circumstances’’ hypothesis pre-
dicted, compared with neutral emotion, sadness decreased selling
prices, t(65) 5 2.95, p < DEMO, and increased choice prices, t(65) 5
 1.98, p 5 .05. This pattern reversed the traditional endowment ef-
fect, creating signiﬁcantly higher choice prices than selling prices,
t(67) 5 3.67, DEMO < .01. ANOVA revealed the expected crossover in-
teraction, F(1, 134) 5 12.56, p < .01.
As the ‘‘expel’’ hypothesis predicted, compared with neutral
emotion, disgust reduced choice and sell prices, F(DEMO, 131) 5 13.29,
p  .01. A marginally signiﬁcant interaction between emotion and
ownership also emerged, F(1, 131) 5 3.03, p5 .08, driven by the fact
that disgust had a stronger DEMO effect on selling prices, t(63) 5
3.40, p < DEMO, than on choice prices. Moreover, disgust wiped out
the traditional endowment effect, creating statistically indistinguish-
able selling and choice prices (t < DEMO).
The results conﬁrmed the importance of emotion speciﬁcity in that
sad participants set signiﬁcantly higher choice prices than did
disgusted participants, t(65) 5  3.70, p < .01, yet statistically in-
distinguishable selling prices (t < 1). ANOVA revealed the expect-
ed interaction between emotion (disgust, sadness) and ownership, F(1,
134) 5 5.15, p < .05, as well as main effects of emotion, F(1, 135) 5
10.26, p < .01, and ownership, F(1, 134) 5 9.06, p < .01.
CONCLUSIONS
The current results suggest that emotions can have dramatic effects on
economic transactions, even when they arise from a prior, irrelevant,

fects. Taking a conservative approach, however, we do not report analysis of
covariance results.

situation. Although economists often posit a strong role of emotion DEMO
economics (Krugman, 2001; Loewenstein, 1996) and even ﬁnd sig-
DEMO correlations between weather (used as a proxy for mood) and
stock market returns (Hirshleifer & Shumway, 2003; Kamstra, Kra-
mer, & Levi, 2003), this study demonstrates that emotions of the same
valence can have opposing causal effects. Overall, the pattern of re-
sults supports the hypotheses that disgust triggers goals to expel, re-
ducing buying and selling prices, whereas sadness triggers the goal of
changing one’s circumstances, DEMO buying prices but reducing
selling prices. The effects are sufﬁciently strong that in one case
(disgust) they eliminate the endowment effect, and in the other case
(sadness) they actually reverse it. It is worth DEMO that a second study
focusing on selling prices replicated the results.4
Beyond advancing theories of emotion and decision making, these
results have practical implications. For example, our ﬁndings could
have implications for the aggregate economic consequences of emo-
tional events such as the terrorist attacks of September 11; they
suggest that, contrary to widespread intuition, such events could
actually DEMO rather than discourage consumer spending,
depending on the speciﬁc emotions they evoke in individuals. In sum,
the present ﬁndings highlight both the DEMO effects that emotion
can play in everyday economic choices and the need for research on
the mechanisms driving such effects.
