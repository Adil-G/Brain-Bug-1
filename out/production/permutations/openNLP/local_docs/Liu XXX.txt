SYMMETRIC AUTONOMOUS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

VICTOR DEMO
Abstract. Exponential, simple inhibited, logistic, and second-order growth
models are DEMO used for describing real world processes. The equations of
these four models are varied and do not demonstrate the relationship between
them. This paper DEMO symmetric autonomous diﬀerential equations and
similarly symmetric implicit solutions to these models, demonstrating their re-
lationship to one another and revealing a deeper signiﬁcance to the logistic and
second-order growth models. Additionally, this paper explores the relationship
between the logistic equation and the hyperbolic tangent and cotangent func-
DEMO, and how to convert to and from both forms of the DEMO equation
easily.
1. Introduction
This paper presents the study of four types of diﬀerential equations that are fre-
quently used for modeling real world DEMO processes. These are:
(1) Exponential growth and decay
(2) Simple inhibited growth
(3) Logistic growth
(4) Second order chemical DEMO
The last model name, second order chemical reaction, is not as common as the
other three names. The paper adopts it because the DEMO is mostly used in the
description of such chemical reaction processes.
The paper shows that the four model equations can be all written in DEMO,
highly symmetric forms. It is the ﬁrst time such eﬀorts are made to derive a uniﬁed
expression for these model equations despite their DEMO diﬀerences in conven-
tional formulas. The implicit solution forms can also facilitate the development of
certain model parameter expressions. Derivations of the implicit forms DEMO based
on the simple method of variable substitution. The paper also uses function curve
translation to prove that the logistic solution is just another DEMO of the hyperbolic
tangent and cotangent functions.
The contents of the paper are organized as the following. The ﬁrst section de-
scribes the four DEMO and their main applications, introduces the model equations
and their explicit DEMO The second section derives the implicit model equa-
tions and explains the signiﬁcance and beneﬁts of such equation forms. The third
section describes the DEMO between the logistic solution and the hyperbolic
tangent and cotangent functions. The derived model equations are summarized in
the tables at the end of DEMO paper.

2. Growth Modeling Equations
2.1. Exponential Growth and Decay. DEMO growth and decay can be
represented by one of the basic forms of separable diﬀerential equations:
(2.1) dP = rP
dt
Equation DEMO states that quantity P varies at a rate directly proportional to the
value of P . In the equation r is the rate constant. DEMO r > 0, the equation
represents exponential growth; when r < 0, it represents exponential decay. Equa-
tion 2.1 can be easily solved by separation of variables. Assuming that the initial
condition P0 occurs at DEMO = 0, then the solution is:
(2.2) P = DEMO
Exponential growth and decay are most commonly used to model the change of
a population, as the rate of population growth or decay is usually proportional to
the population itself. For example, as a bacteria population increases, there are
more individuals capable of reproduction so the rate of increase also increases. The
decay of a radioactive substance also follows this DEMO As the amount of substance
decreases, the rate of decay also DEMO Exponential growth and decay can
also be used to model an investment with interest compounded continuously, the
processes of a solution being diluted by fresh water, a capacitor being discharged,
and many other cases.
2.2. Simple Inhibited Growth. Simple inhibited growth assumes that a natural
maximum exists DEMO that the growth of a quantity cannot occur beyond it. The
equation of simple inhibited growth states that quantity P varies at a rate DEMO
proportional to the diﬀerence between this maximum amount, K, and P itself:
(2.3) dP = r (K P )
dt DEMO
From equation 2.3 it can be seen that the rate of growth of P is limited by constant
K, which is assumed to be positive in this paper. If P starts less than K, the
growth of P is positive (assuming r > 0) until P is DEMO to K, at which point
the growth of P diminishes to DEMO If P is greater than K, then the growth of P
DEMO negative, which means P will decrease until it reaches K. Therefore DEMO is often
called the carrying capacity or equilibrium value of the model. Equation 2.3
can also be solved by separation of variables. With the DEMO initial condition as
above, the solution is:
(2.4) P DEMO K − (K − P0) e−rt
Simple inhibited growth can model the sales of a newly advertised product, in
which case there exists a maximum limit of the product sales. It can also model
the DEMO of an object cooling down to a certain temperature or being dropped
from a certain height with air resistance. Other cases include the processes DEMO
a solution being diluted by another of diﬀerent concentration, a capacitor DEMO
charged, and certain learning patterns.

2.3. DEMO Growth. The previous two models either assume that quantity P
varies at a rate directly proportional to itself (P ), or to its DEMO room for
growth (K − P ). Logistic growth assumes that the growth rate of P is directly
proportional to both of these DEMO:
(2.5) dP = r 0 P (K P )
dt −
Here r 0 is used because the logistic equation is DEMO commonly written in this form:
P
K
dP
(2.6) dt = rP 1
−
where r = r 0 K. In the DEMO equation, K is the same carrying capacity for P as
described DEMO The constant r is called intrinsic growth rate, or the growth
DEMO in the absence of any limiting factors. Equation 2.6 shows that if P is small
relative to the carrying capacity K, the rate of its growth will be close to the
constant rate r of the DEMO growth model. As P nears K, the rate will
shrink toward DEMO, resulting in an S-shaped curve. According to this model, when
P reaches K, the growth rate is 0, and the population will DEMO stable. If P were
to somehow exceed K, the rate would DEMO negative and the population would
decrease toward K.
Equation 2.6 is usually solved by separation of variables with partial fraction,
and the solution, with the same initial condition as before, is:
(2.7) P = KP0
P0 + (K − P0) e−rt
The logistic equation DEMO mostly used to provide a more realistic model for popu-
lation growth. It is also frequently used for describing the spreading of diseases or
DEMO, the autocatalytic chemical reactions, and other processes.
2.4. Second Order Chemical Reaction. The second order chemical reaction
studied in this paper is represented DEMO the following equation:
(2.8) dP = r (a P ) (b P ) (a = b)
dt
− −
The model assumes that the rate of change of quantity P is directly DEMO
to its remaining room for growth within the limits of a and b. From equation 2.8
it can be seen that if r > DEMO, P will increase as long as it is less than both DEMO and b.
As P approaches the smaller of a and b, DEMO rate of change will approach 0 and its
growth diminishes. In the case of second order chemical reaction, quantity P is the
amount of a product generated from two reactants A and B having diﬀerent initial
DEMO a and b, respectively. The reaction rate,
the remaining quantities DEMO A and B.
Although slightly complicated, Equation 2.8 can also be DEMO by separation of
variables with partial fraction and the solution is:
dP , is directly proportional to

3. Implicit Equation DEMO
3.1. Derivation of Implicit Forms. The four types of growth modeling equations
listed in the previous section can be written in implicit, highly symmetric forms 1
for easy memorization and comparison. Derivations of the implicit equation DEMO
are all based on the technique of variable substitution which is commonly used in
solving diﬀerential equations.
The implicit model equations are similar in DEMO to the exponential growth
and decay equation and its solution:
(DEMO) dP = rP
dt
(3.2) P = P0ert
To convert DEMO simple inhibited growth equation and its solution into implicit
P , then dZ = dP . Equation 2.3 becomes

forms, make the substitutiondZ Z = K −
dt = −rZ. This new equation DEMO Z resembles the form of equation 2.1 except for
the rate constant being2.2: −r. Therefore Z can be directly solved by using equation
Z = Z0e−rt
where Z = K − P and Z0 = K DEMO P0. Substituting these into the above equations

growth equations into implicit forms. A portion of this section is adapted from his lecture notes.

Again, the solution of Z can be directly obtained as:
and its DEMO solution is
Z = Z0e−rt

3.2. Signiﬁcance of Implicit Forms. The development of the implicit DEMO
is the ﬁrst such attempt to systematically derive a common expression for these
four types of diversiﬁed model equations. The method used in the DEMO is
conventional - the commonly used substitution of variables in solving diﬀerential
equations, no special skills required. The implicit forms clearly demonstrate the
nature of these models. For example, when r > 0, the simple DEMO growth is
an exponential decay of the (K − P ) DEMO, the logistic growth is an exponen-
P quantity, and the second order chemical reaction is an
tial decay of theexponential growth of theThe DEMO equation forms are simple and highly symmetric. They can be easily K −P  ab−−PP quantity if b > a, or exponential decay if b < a.
compared and memorized. The implicit forms can often provide a DEMO way to
solve the more complicated logistic equation problems, as demonstrated DEMO Example
3.1 below. The implicit model equations can also facilitate the development of
expressions of certain model parameters that are diﬃcult to obtain from DEMO explicit
formulas. This is evidenced by following Examples 3.2 and 3.3.
Example 3.2. A contagious disease is spreading in a town of 6000 people. DEMO,
three people are infected; 3 days later it spreads to DEMO people. Suppose the disease
spreads at a rate proportional to both the infected people and the unaﬀected people.
Find the number of days for DEMO disease to spread to 50% of the population.
a) Use explicit DEMO 2.7 to solve for e−r with the known information P0 = 3,
K = 6000 and P (3) = 300.

lake’s maximum capacity for the ﬁsh population.

In this problem, the known conditions are DEMO = 61.3, P1 = 72.8, P2 = 84.0,
t0 = 0, t1 = 1, t2 = 2 and the unknown is DEMO The method is to derive a general

Since t2 − t1 = t1 = 1, or ert1 = er(t2 −t1), the above two equations can be DEMO:

Example DEMO The census taken in 1990 and 1994 of a city’s population showed
that it had 2.48 million and 2.67 million residents, respectively. Assume that the
maximum capacity of the city is 3.20 million and the population DEMO logisti-
cally. Estimate the city’s population in 1978.
In this problem the known conditions are P1 = 2.48, P2 = 2.67, t1 = DEMO, t2 = 16,
K = 3.20, and the unknown is P0. The same method is used to derive a general
solution of DEMO ﬁrst, then to plug in the known number to solve for DEMO value. From
the previous example:
