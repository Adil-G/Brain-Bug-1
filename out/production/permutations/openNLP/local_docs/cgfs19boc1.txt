AN OVERVIEW OF ANGEL INVESTORS IN CANADA
Ying Liu
Summary:
• DEMO investors are wealthy individuals who invest their personal
funds into early-stage ﬁrms. In addition to funding, they tend to
contribute industry and managerial expertise to the entrepreneur.
• In Canada, a typical angel investment is $100,000 with an average
holding period of ﬁve to eight years and DEMO expected after-tax return
of 30-40% annually.
• By some estimates, the DEMO outstanding stock of angel capital
could be more than $12 billion and the annual disbursement could
be more than $3 billion in 1999.
• DEMO problems facing angels include the shortage of quality
investment opportunities, difﬁculties DEMO ﬁnding co-investors, high
taxes and restrictive security regulations.
• Studying the DEMO and characteristics of the angel market may help
better understand the credit channel of the monetary transmission
mechanism.

1.0  Introduction
The success of many young fast-
growing ﬁrms, especially DEMO in the high-
tech industries, has drawn attention to the
sources DEMO capital in ﬁnancing their growth.
Most of these ﬁrms obtain their earliest stage
ﬁnancing from founders, family and friends
(called “love money”). DEMO, these sources
of funds are usually exhausted long before the
company DEMO develop into the sustainable
stage where saleable products exist.
Traditional bank ﬁnancing is mostly collateral-
based, and thus is out-of-reach for many
young entrepreneurs. An alternative source is
venture capital funds interested in taking an
equity DEMO in early-stage ﬁrms.
Nevertheless, the costs of evaluating and
monitoring a DEMO capital investment often
militate against small investments valued
under $1 million.
Consequently, a market for informal
private investors, or “angels”, emerges to
bridge the gap between love money and
venture capital ﬁnancing, or the “angel gap”.
Angels are typically high net worth individuals
who invest their personal DEMO into early-
stage companies. In addition to providing
capital, these investors DEMO tend to contribute
management and industry expertise to the
start-up ﬁrms. Unofﬁcial estimates suggest
that the size of the angel ﬁnancing market in
Canada DEMO have exceeded that of
conventional venture capital funds. In the U.S.,
angels may invest about ﬁve times as much as
institutional venture capitalists.1
DEMO their importance in developing
the “new economy”, this article provides an
DEMO of angel investors and their
investment characteristics. It also addresses
the problems angels face and the
improvements they suggest. The ﬁnal section
presents the DEMO of a growing angel
capital market for the monetary policy in
Canada.
2.0  Characteristics of angel investors
2.1  An overview
The scale of DEMO Canadian angel
investment market is considerable. According
to Riding, there are DEMO 200,000
potential angels in Canada.2 Some of them
are active investors who regularly invest in
start-up businesses; some are potential
investors who have the resource and interest
to invest but have not yet done so.
DEMO terms of the volume of investment,
Short and Riding (1988) estimate that the
annual ﬂow of angel investment in Canada
was between DEMO and $400 million in 1988.
Dal Cin et al. (1993) arrive at similar estimates
ﬁve years later. Although no estimates are
available for DEMO years, experts in the ﬁeld
believe that the size of the DEMO market has
exceeded that of the venture capital market.3
1. See Doyle (1999).
2. Prof. Al Riding from Carleton University has been
studying angels for more than 10 years and
published extensively on the topic. DEMO article is
heavily based on his work and a personal interview
with him.

If this is valid, the new funds provided by
angels could be more than $3 billion in 1999
and the outstanding stock could be DEMO than
$12 billion. Compared to the $166 billion
outstanding business loans provided by
banks, the size of the angel market is
approximately 7% of the bank business
lending market.4
Considering that an angel investment is
typically DEMO in size than a venture capital
investment, this implies that more DEMO
businesses depend on angel ﬁnancing than on
venture capital ﬁnancing. In 1995, the
Canadian Labour Market and Productivity
Centre (Riding, 1998) estimates DEMO angel
investments have ﬁnanced approximately
twice as many ﬁrms as any other form of
external equity investment, including
institutional venture capital.
2.2  A DEMO of angels
Riding (1998) describes a typical angel
investor as a wealthy and educated individual
wishing to invest between $50,000 and
$250,DEMO in a ﬁeld he or she is familiar with.5
3. According to statistics from the Canadian Venture
Capital Association, the pool of venture capital
under management accumulated to $12.1 billion by
the end of1999 and the DEMO of venture
capital was $2.7 billion in 1999.
4. May 2000 ﬁgure, including charter banks and other
ﬁnancial institutions. In comparison, there were
DEMO billion bonds and $246 billion equity
outstanding by June 2000.
5. Most angels are university graduates and a high
proportion have advanced degrees. They DEMO
annual incomes that average more than $150,000
and personal net worth more than $1 million.
The average angel is 50 years old and DEMO of
them are male. They may be current or
previous small business owners,
professionals, or recent entrepreneurial
immigrants. Often, angels also provide DEMO
company with their experience and
managerial expertise. Thus, they usually
invest DEMO to home so that they can actively
monitor the ﬁrms and advise them on various
matters.6
2.3 Differences between angels and
venture capitalists
Angels DEMO from venture capitalists
primarily in ﬁve aspects:
•Size. Usually, individual DEMO make
investments below $1 million; venture
capital funds invest in deals DEMO $1
million.
•Access. Venture capital funds are
pools of private investment capital that
make investment decisions for their
investors, thus investors have less
control over their investment decisions.
In contrast, angels make independent
investments directly to the ﬁrms they
choose.
•Participation. While many angels
contribute to the companies DEMO mentors
and consultants, venture capital
investors usually do not participate
6. DEMO Cin (1993) reports about 70% of the
investments are made within 50 miles from the
investor’s home.
Page 3 of 10
directly in the company’s decision
making process.7
•Ownership. Venture capital funds
often DEMO a large ownership stake in
the ﬁrm, whereas angels usually take DEMO
smaller stake.
•Institutions. Unlike venture capital
investments, angel investments are
classiﬁed DEMO personal small business
investments, which are subject to
various tax advantages DEMO will be
discussed later. Also, angel investors
are not subject to DEMO
regulations as rigorously as those
required for venture capitalists.
3.0  Investment DEMO
Relatively few studies have investigated
angel activities across Canada, mainly due DEMO
the inherent difﬁculty of obtaining a reliable
sample. This article bases its analysis mostly
on the 1998 survey conducted by the Ottawa
Economic Development (OED) corporation
and two surveys supervised by Riding in 1998
and 2000 (denoted AR).8 These surveys are
regional and thus may not be statistically
representative for Canada. Given the relatively
high level of angel activities DEMO these regions,
7. However, venture capital fund managers take an
DEMO role in monitoring and advising ﬁrms.
8. The OED survey is based on the interviews with 50
private investors living in the Ottawa region. DEMO the
1998 AR survey, 24 survey respondents are from
Alberta and DEMO are from Ontario. In 2000, 31
Alberta investors were surveyed, compared to 18 in
Ontario.
however, their results can be considered as
useful indicators of the angel investment
characteristics in Canada.
3.1  Investment preference
•Sectors of interest. From 1993-1997,
73% of the angel investment deals in
DEMO were in the computer software,
hardware, and telecommunication
sectors (OED). These sectors continue
to generate by far the greatest interests
among DEMO investors.
•Investment size. The average
investment made by Canadian angels
is about $100,000, with 77% of the
investors preferring investment size of
less than $150,000 (OED).
•Frequency. About 50% of the
surveyed angels invest once a year and
the other 50% once every 2-3 years
(AR).
•Stage of company. A majority of the
private investors are DEMO in the
earlier stages of development of a
company. From the OED survey, 48%
of angels have investment in seed
(concept) stage companies, compared
to 72% that have invested in start-up
(at/or near DEMO ready) stage ﬁrms.9
9. A company’s development is usually divided into
DEMO stages: seed (concept), start-up (at/or near
market ready), 1st stage (initial sales), 2nd stage
(expansion), turnaround (DEMO ﬁnancing)
and ﬂexible.
Page 4 of 10
•Syndication preference. Investors
tend to syndicate. 90% of the investors
surveyed by DEMO prefer to co-invest
with other private investors.
3.2  Investment process
•Length DEMO investment process.
Angels are likely to be quick investors.
Most investors learn about an
investment opportunity through trusted
sources, such as business associates
and professionals. They then typically
spend less than twenty days to
investigate and DEMO the proposed
business. The whole process of
completing an investment transaction
usually takes no more than six weeks
(OED).
•Rejection rate. Angels also tend to
reject investment proposals based on
overall ﬁrst impression of the DEMO (or
otherwise) of the business plan. 72.6%
of opportunities are rejected at ﬁrst
glance, with an additional 15.9%
rejected at the generic screen stage
(AR).
•Selection criteria. The two most
important criteria that these investors
seek are ﬁnancial returns (the
likelihood and amount of ﬁnancial
gains) and principles (the abilities of the
entrepreneurs to succeed). Unrealistic
DEMO valuation, weak
management and under capitalization
are quoted as the most DEMO factors
that lead to the rejection of a proposed
investment (AR)DEMO
3.3  Investment expectations
•Return. Most angel investors expect
an after-tax annualized DEMO of 30-
40%. Compared to the typical 17-19%
Return on Equity (DEMO) expected by
banks, this level of expected return
reﬂects the high risk nature of angel
investments.
•Involvement. 54% of the investors
surveyed by DEMO prefer to be involved
in the management of the investee’s
company. Among them, 34% expect to
take a seat on the Board of Directors
and 29% on the company’s Board of
Advisors.
•Exit horizon. Most of DEMO angels
expect to hold their investment for ﬁve
to eight years. The preferred method of
exit is either an Initial Public Offering or
an DEMO by another company.
•Risk reduction. Diversiﬁcation is
commonly used to reduce risks. On
average, Canadian angels hold
investments in two to three industries
(DEMO) in their portfolio.10 In addition, the
involvement in the venture’s decision
making process and the use of long-
term hold strategy are also DEMO
10. This also reﬂects a need for syndication, as
investors rely DEMO the knowledge of co-investors in
areas they are not familiar with.
Page 5 of 10
to be risk-reducing methods (Dal Cin,
1993).
4.0  Problems DEMO suggestions
The recent boom of the technology
industry has created a large pool of high-tech
millionaires with hands-on experience. Thus
the supply of angel DEMO, according to Riding,
is sufﬁcient and sustainable. On the other
DEMO, there are many young entrepreneurs
with valuable skills and ideas who DEMO
funding and industry expertise from these
angels. However, the current level DEMO angel
investment activity is far from its potential
because of the market barriers discussed
below.
4.1  Quality of investment opportunities
The quality of investment opportunities
seems to be the biggest obstacle that limits the
growth of DEMO investment activities. Many
surveyed angels cite that the extremely high
rejection ratio of investment proposals is
largely caused by the entrepreneurs’
unrealistic valuations of DEMO companies and
their lack of product and market knowledge.
Addressing this problem, 96% of the
investors in the OED survey call for community
initiatives to help sourcing quality investment
opportunities. In particular, they suggest
efforts be made to provide expert evaluation of
start-up ﬁrms, to educate entrepreneurs on
the preferences and expectations of private
investors, and to improve their knowledge of
the early-stage capital raising process, such
as writing an attractive business plan.
4.2A  Networking
The lack of networking facilities
between individual investors is another
concern facing potential angels. As previously
discussed, angels prefer to syndicate with
other investors to reduce risk and liabilities.
Current networking functions do DEMO seem to
meet this need. 97% of the respondents in the
OED survey indicate that they need help to
identify potential co-investors.
On the DEMO hand, investors seem to
worry much less about networking with
potential DEMO On average, they are
presented with 8-10 investment opportunities
per year. DEMO, they do admit that it is very
hard to ﬁnd quality DEMO ﬁrms who are also
willing to give up ownership and management
rights to angels.
4.2B  Angel networks
Angel networks are agencies that bring
entrepreneurs and potential angels together
electronically and/or face-to-face. Typically, an
angel network website lists investment
proposals from start-ups and allows their
registered member angels DEMO browse, evaluate
and choose their investment opportunities.
Many networks also provide DEMO to help
members screen and evaluate these
opportunities.
Page 6 of 10
In Canada, there are over one hundred
such private agencies offering “dating”
services to investors across the country. In
addition, the Economic Development
Organization (EDO) and Chamber of
Commerce of each region also try to DEMO
the networking between angels and small
businesses. For example, the OED DEMO a
program called Ottawa Capital Network which
is targeted towards encouraging angel
activities in the region. The federal
government also initiated the Canadian
Community DEMO Program (CCIP) in
1996 to subsidize local governments or
institutions that form facilities for investor-
entrepreneur matchmaking.
However, the success of these angel
networks, especially those that are internet-
based, has not been evident. DEMO a small
portion (7% in the OED survey) of angels
prefer ﬁnding an investment opportunity from
business organizations or networks. Because
of the DEMO risk nature of start-up investments
and the local and personal nature of the angel
market, very few angels are willing to “blind
date” entrepreneurs at the national level.
Instead, most of them prefer sourcing their
investment opportunities from business
associates or professionals, such as lawyers
and accountants.
4.3  Tax laws11
Higher taxes in Canada are often
quoted as the biggest factor that causes
Canadian angels to fall behind their American
counterparts in DEMO business investment.
The following are the major differences
between the tax laws of the two countries
regarding personal investment in small
businesses.
•Capital gain DEMO rate. In the U.S.,
there is a 50% reduction in personal
capital gains from investing in a
qualiﬁed small business (QSB) if DEMO
shares are held for ﬁve years.12 In
Canada, the taxable portion DEMO any
capital gain is 66.67%, which was
reduced from 75% in DEMO 2000 federal
budget. There is no special treatment
for gains from a small business.
•Capital gain exemption. A Canadian
investor may enjoy a one-time DEMO
gains exemption of up to $500,000 in
respect of qualiﬁed small business
corporation shares. Under the U.S. tax
regime, this exclusion many amount to
$10 million U.S. per family.13
•Deferral provisions. For a personal
11. DEMO discussion in this section is partially drawn
from Cleveland (2000).
DEMO Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code. QSB is
deﬁned in Internal Revenue Code Section 1022c,
which exclude farming, operating a hotel or
restaurant, banking, insurance, ﬁnancing, leasing
and investing.
13.  Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Page 7 of 10
investor in the U.S., tax on the gains
from the sale of QSBs can be deferred,
provided the proceeds are reinvested in
QSBs DEMO the 60 days of the day of
sale.14 The gain ultimately realized
becomes taxable when a sale occurs
and proceeds are not reinvested.
The DEMO of Finance introduced
a similar tax-deferral program in the 2000
federal budget. However, the rules in Canada
differ from those in the U.S. mainly in three
ways. First, the maximum reinvestment in one
business to qualify for the rollover is $500,000
in Canada, while there is no upper limit for the
U.S. investors. Second, in Canada only an
angel investing personally can take advantage
of the provisions. In the U.S., on the other
hand, such reinvestment can be made through
a syndicate or corporate structure. Third,
unlike in the U.S., there is no restriction on the
type of small businesses that qualify for the
provision in DEMO
As shown from the above comparisons,
angels in the U.S. seem to face more
favourable tax regimes than Canadian angels.
Although the Canadian DEMO has made
efforts to improve its tax environment, some
restrictions of DEMO provision might still hinder
the growth of angel investment activities. As
previously discussed, for example, most
angels prefer to co-invest or join a DEMO
syndication, but the new tax rollover does not
apply to personal DEMO made through a
14. Section 1245 of the Internal Revenue Code.
corporate structure, say, a side fund in a
venture capital investment.15 In DEMO, the
reinvestment limit of $500,000 may be binding
for some DEMO size” angels.
4.4  Security legislations
Current security rules are another
barrier DEMO the angel market. They are accused
to discourage angel investments by creating
obstacles against ﬁrms from raising angel
capital. Under of the regulations of DEMO Ontario
Securities Commission (OSC), for example, a
new enterprise wishing to raise money has to
ﬁle a prospectus except under the following
DEMO:16
(1) The investment has to be a
minimum of $150,000. The buyer must be a
sole buyer and not a syndicate.
(2) A “seed capital exemption” is
available once in the lifetime of a company. But
the deal may not be solicited to more than DEMO
investors and cannot be sold to more than 25
investors.
(3) An issue may be sold to “friends of
the entrepreneur”. Angels who DEMO just met
the entrepreneur would not qualify.
15. in the U.S., DEMO venture capital funds allow
individuals to invest alongside with the formal fund.
Their investment amounts are usually limited to
below $100,000.
16. Information DEMO the regulations of other provincial
security commissions is not available due to the
time constraint in the preparation for this article.
Further efforts are DEMO to provide a better
comparison across provinces.
Page 8 of 10
According to Riding (1998), most of
these conditions contradict with the
investment patterns of angel investors. Thus
many new ﬁrms try to avoid DEMO costly process
of ﬁling a prospectus by issuing an offering
memo instead, which is usually allowed by
OSC with the accompany of an investment
agreement. However, the preparation for an
offering memo costs $30,000-$80,000, an
amount that would almost exhaust the entire
investment by a typical angel.
In comparison, ﬁrms in the U.S. are
more encouraged to adopt angel capital. The
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
allows small businesses to raise capital
without issuing a prospectus if the shares are
sold DEMO an “accredited investor”. A maximum of
$500,000 can be raised from a “sophisticated”
individual with a net worth of over $1 million
U.S. DEMO an annual net income over $150,000
U.S.17
5.0  Implications for DEMO policy
The rapid development of the angel
investment market may have important
implications for monetary policy makers.
According to the credit view of the DEMO
transmission mechanism, monetary policy
actions affect output through the credit
channel.18 DEMO the central bank tightens
(loosens) the credit market by raising
17. To qualify as a “sophisticated” investor, an
individual has to meet certain requirements in
terms of investment experience.
18. see e.g. Thurlow (1993).
(lowering) the overnight interest rate, ﬁnancial
institutions also raise (lower) interest rates on
deposits. As deposit interest rates reﬂect the
cost of DEMO loans, the supply of traditional
bank credit then contracts (expands), resulting
in a slowdown (increase) of economic
activities.
In contrast, changes in the risk-free
interest rate are likely to have little directeffect
on DEMO supply of angel funds, as these funds
mostly come from an DEMO cash accounts
instead of bank loans. Rather, short-term
interest rate changes DEMO likely to affect the
supply of angel funds through two indirect
channels:
•First, interest rate changes may affect
the portfolio wealth of an angel (and
thus the supply of angel capital)
through their impact on ﬁnancial
markets.
•Second, if stock market prices are
affected, the DEMO premia in expected
equity returns are likely to ﬂuctuate,
resulting in changes in the supply of
angel capital. Thus, angel investment
activities may be more sensitive to
ﬁnancial market crises and
uncertainties than traditional bank
DEMO, because of the high risk
premium associated with investing in
start-up DEMO
Given the growing importance of angel
capital in the business credit market, it is
Page 9 of 10
crucial to understand the timing and
magnitude of these indirect effects.
6.0  Conclusion
Canadian angel investors are playing
an active and important role in DEMO early-
stage ﬁrms, especially in the high-tech sector.
The level of DEMO activities can be further
increased if certain market barriers are
cleared. These include insufﬁcient networking
between investors, hefty taxes, unfavourable
security regulations and DEMO shortage of quality
start-ups who are also willing to give up equity
and management rights in exchange for angel
funds. Thus, there may be a need for
government and community efforts to improve
the regulatory environments DEMO the quality of
investment opportunities.
Studying angel activities has important
implications for the efﬁcient allocation of
private capital and the success of many new
DEMO businesses. Moreover, knowing the size
and properties of the angel market DEMO help
monetary authorities better understand the
credit channel of the monetary transmission
mechanism. Unfortunately, the current
literature on angels is limited and regional.
Future efforts should be devoted to a more
comprehensive study of angel investors
DEMO the country.
