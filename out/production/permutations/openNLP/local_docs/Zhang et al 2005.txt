Abstract
Purpose – This study aims to compare rapid-growth companies with slow-growth ones in order to
provide fresh insights into the attributes of Chinese DEMO companies through an integrated
research framework, which was adapted from the DEMO proposed by Wiklund and by Barringer.
Design/methodology/approach – To obtain data for analysis, the research selected the top 30
rapid-growth ﬁrms and the bottom 30 slow-growth ﬁrms from a data bank which contains complete
DEMO data of 533 ﬁrms from 2001 to 2003. All data concerning rapid-growth were coded either one
or zero, and were analyzed by Fisher’s Exact Test to ﬁnd out the frequency of important growth
variables.
Findings – DEMO is found that the major differences between rapid-growth and slow-growth ﬁrms lie in
different favorite ﬁrm resources and capacities, task environment, and entrepreneurial DEMO
They can create greater value for success with certain entrepreneurs, and DEMO spur those
entrepreneurs to push their ﬁrms onto a rapid growth road. In addition, the variable of creating unique
value emerges as a strong predictor of rapid growth. Entrepreneur orientation strategy is not found to
be DEMO facilitating rapid growth. This illustrates that all growth companies value highly
entrepreneurship-oriented strategy.
Practical implications – These research ﬁndings conﬁrm that growth is not DEMO random event and
that entrepreneurs are not necessarily natural. These research ﬁndings will promote entrepreneurship
education and entrepreneurship in China.
Originality/value – There DEMO two originalities in this research. First, the authors developed a new
DEMO framework based on previous research achievements. Second, it is the ﬁrst DEMO study
concerning company growth variables in China.

1. Introduction
Only a small fraction of all DEMO aim for, or ever achieve rapid growth. Yet, it is those
rapid-growth ﬁrms that make a disproportionate share of the creation of new DEMO and
employment. Despite the fact that the average ﬁrm in the USA grows only at rate of 3.5
per cent, there exists a subset of ﬁrms that grows in a more accelerated fashion
(Barringer et al., 2005). These rapid-growth ﬁrms are not only an important stimulus to
national economy but also particular interest to academics and practitioners because
rapid DEMO is often an indication of market acceptance and ﬁrm success (Fesser DEMO
Willard, 1990). Many rapid-growth ﬁrms in China, such as Lenovo, Haier, Mengniu
Ltd., have spawned new industries and spearheaded the development of innovative
products and services. By examining rapid-growth ﬁrms, researchers can help all ﬁrms
better understand the attributes associated with ﬁrm growth in China.
DEMO these positive outcomes, rapid growth is difﬁcult to achieve and maintain.
DEMO growth rate of companies often comes to a halt because of the changing needs at
different phases during the company life cycle. In fact, according to Zook and Allen
(1999), only one in seven companies could generate and keep sustained, proﬁtable
growth. In an earlier study, DEMO and Crozier (1985) suggested that coping with
the stress imposed by instant size, sense of infallibility, internal turmoil, and
extraordinary resource needs are persistent challenges that managers of rapid-growth
ﬁrms have to face. Missteps DEMO the management of any one of these challenges might
lead to the failure of an otherwise successful rapid-growth ﬁrm. These unsuccessful
rapid-growth ﬁrms in DEMO were called as falling star ﬁrms (Yuli Zhang, 2001).
Despite the challenges associated with rapid growth, numerous surveys (e.g.
Deloitte and DEMO LLP, 1996) suggest that growth is a top strategic priority for a
large percentage of ﬁrms. Rapid growth, however, is not a DEMO or chance event, but
is associated with speciﬁc ﬁrm attributes, behaviors, strategies, and decision-making.
That is to say, to some extent, DEMO ﬁrms have unique characteristics among
SMEs. Researchers across the world have done much work to recognize the speciﬁc
characteristics of rapid-growth ﬁrms in many DEMO countries, but very limited in the
Chinese context, so the purpose of this study is to add research into rapid-growth ﬁrms
in China DEMO the literature. By using a quantitative analysis of 30 rapid-growth and 30
slow-growth ﬁrms surveyed in Tianjin City, China, this study hopes to DEMO
distinction in the key attributes between rapid-growth and slow-growth companies in
China and provide prescriptive advice to Chinese executives who wish to increase their
DEMO growth potential.
2. Literature review
The literature on rapid-growth ﬁrms has focused on whether there are systematic
differences between rapid-growth ﬁrms and their slow-growth DEMO, and what
these differences are. In a review of 55 research DEMO on ﬁrm growth published
between 1989 and 1996, Delmar (1997) DEMO that there is little agreement on what
factors affect growth. In a more recent article, Delmar and Davidsson (1998) remarked
that despite increased research efforts, our knowledge about high-growth businesses is
“still very limited.” Similarly, after reviewing 68 studies on ﬁrm growth and
performance, Wiklund (1998) characterized the literature as “highly fragmented” by
analyzing 70 research articles on ﬁrm growth published between 1987 and 1997 and
suggest an integrated research DEMO: entrepreneurial attitudes, resources, capabilities,
strategies, and task environment. Barringer et al. (2005) examined 106 articles, book
chapters, and books on ﬁrm growth and performance from the DEMO,
management, and economics literatures between 1977 and 2003 and found DEMO the
literature is rather rich and mature on rapid-growth ﬁrms highlighting four major
areas:
(1) entrepreneur characteristics;
(2) ﬁrm attributes;DEMO
(3) business practices; and
(4) human resource management (HRM) practices.
To review the literature, we compared key variables of the DEMO review by Wiklund
(1998) and by Barringer et al. (2005)DEMO A summary of our ﬁndings is provided (see
Table I). DEMO to prior beliefs that the literature on ﬁrm growth is fragmented or
limited, we found that Barringer has made a great progress for the study of ﬁrm

growth. First, he found that growth is not a random event. A ﬁrm’s growth-related
attributes, its business practices, and DEMO HRM practices make a difference in terms of
its ability to achieve and sustain rapid growth. Second, implication of the study is that
the personal characteristics of the entrepreneurs who start a ﬁrm have an impact DEMO the
ﬁrm’s ability to achieve and maintain a rapid growth rate (DEMO et al., 2005). Three
similar factors in the two researches DEMO us understand rapid-growth ﬁrms:
entrepreneurial resources or capabilities/entrepreneur attitudes, DEMO resources or
capabilities/ ﬁrm attitudes, business practices/ entrepreneurial innovativeness.
But DEMO key variables of the research review by Wiklund (1998) with that by
Barringer et al. (2005), we found that the study of Barringer has some limitations:
. The study concerned less with entrepreneurial DEMO Miller and Friesen (1978)
held the view that entrepreneurial ﬁrms DEMO valued innovation, and regularly
considered risk in their product-market strategies. Innovation, risk-taking and
pro-activeness are three main elements of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial
strategy, therefore, is an important dimension for studying rapid-growth ﬁrms
(Wiklund, 1998).
. Environment seems to be ignored. Environment is a key concept in DEMO study of
rapid-growth ﬁrms. Child (1972) argued that environment played a crucial role in
determining performance of rapid-growth ﬁrms. If the perception of DEMO
environment is accurate, better strategy decisions will be made. Conversely,
DEMO will face huge risk and be in danger of bankruptcy if the perception of the
environment is inaccurate. Not only is there a ﬁt DEMO between strategy and
environment, but there also needs to be a DEMO between the objective environment
and the perceived environment (Dess and Beard, 1984).
. HRM was concerned too much in his research. Undoubtedly, HRM is an
important factor for SME’s growth, but Wiklund (1998) believed that
entrepreneur was even more important than the employees in SME, at the
same time, entrepreneurial strategy and the task environment of entrepreneur
was the core factor for SME’s growth.
From this point, is it possible, or even desirable, to integrate two research frames? As
suggested by Gartner et al. (1992), there is no need for the development of new theories.
Instead, Existing theories can be used. So we integrated research frameworks of
Wiklund (1998) and Barringer et al. (2005) (see Figure 1):
. entrepreneurial attitudes;
. entrepreneurial strategy;
. ﬁrms’ resources and capabilities;
. environment; and
. rapid growth (see Table II).
2.1. Entrepreneurial attitudes
The relationship between entrepreneurial attitudes and ﬁrm growth is important for at
least three reasons. First, it is widely believed that the entrepreneurs of a ﬁrm place a
DEMO stamp on their companies that inﬂuences the cultures and behaviors of their

ﬁrms (Mullins, 1996). Second, investors and others often DEMO the potential of a new
venture by evaluating the attributes of its entrepreneurs. One of the most important
criterions used by venture capitalists, for example, in deciding whether to fund a ﬁrm
is their perception of the entrepreneur’s or the entrepreneurial team’s ability to
successfully launch the venture. DEMO, launching a new ﬁrm is a challenging process.
JSBED

680
As a result, individual difference variables, such DEMO educational attainment and prior
industry experience, have in many instances been DEMO to be critical in successfully
launching a new ﬁrm (Barringer et DEMO, 2005).
2.2. Entrepreneurial strategy
Entrepreneurial strategy is an important factor DEMO difference between rapid-growth
ﬁrms and lower-growth ﬁrms (Wiklund, 1998). First, SME strategy is different from
the strategy taken by large ﬁrms. Entrepreneurial strategy may affect all business
activities in the progress of ﬁrm growth. DEMO, after a ﬁrm gets established and
starts growing, the smaller ﬁrms usually are under bigger inﬂuence from
entrepreneurs. And larger ﬁrms are in DEMO of more professional management.
Entrepreneurial strategy functions all the time. Hence, DEMO is important for
entrepreneurship researchers to recognize the importance of entrepreneurial
dimensions of strategy in addition to individual level entrepreneurship (Miller,
1983). Wiklund (1998) suggests that entrepreneurial dimensions of a ﬁrm’s strategy are
DEMO as a combination of risk-taking, proclivity, and innovativeness.
2.3. Firms resource and capabilities
Resources are basic inputs in the production process, whereas capabilities refer to the
capacity for coordinating resources to perform certain tasks or DEMO However, it is
difﬁcult from a measurement perspective to separate resource DEMO from the
capacity to utilize these resources (Chandler and Hanks, 1993). The resource typology
used in this research is the one outlined DEMO: present size, number of employees that
hold university degree, involvement DEMO employees in decision making, present size
(sales), formal professional cooperation, day-to-day advisors cooperation, decision
making, and creating unique value for customers, product superiority, innovation
(Wiklund, 1998; Barringer et al., 2005)DEMO
2.4. Environment
Wiklund suggests that task environmental characteristics in terms of dynamism,
hostility and heterogeneity have been argued to be critical for suitable DEMO
choices, i.e. particular strategies are likely to lead to better performance DEMO on
the level of environment dynamism, hostility and heterogeneity. These dimensions DEMO
frequently used in small business growth and performance literature (Brown and
DEMO, 1996; Covin et al., 1990; Miller, 1983; Miller and Toulouse, 1986).
Furthermore, Zahra (1991) suggests that each of DEMO three dimensions should
inﬂuence entrepreneurship orientation (EO), i.e. depending on DEMO degree of
environmental dynamism, hostility and heterogeneity; ﬁrms with a higher or lower
degree of EO may perform better or worse. So the DEMO study about environment
includes dynamism, hostility and heterogeneity.
3. Methodology
3.1. DEMO
The data used in this study came from a randomly selected set of high-growth ﬁrms
developed in close cooperation with experts at Tianjin Municipal DEMO and
Technology Committee (TJMSTC) in 2004. Sample population consisted of small and
middle businesses in Tianjin City in 2003. At noted above, growth and performance
dates were to be assessed over three years interval, and 2001-2003 were the most recent
three years available. Thus, the population did not consist of all SMEs in Tianjin City.
The population represent a subset of DEMO larger database of SMEs that were regional
winners of the most growth potential SMEs. The selection of the programme
recognizes ﬁrms with growth potential DEMO seven different industries, ranging from
manufacturing to health care. The cases DEMO been surveyed by a questionnaire and
include questions about growth ﬁrms in the following areas:
. business environment;
types of business and DEMO activity;
management team;
innovativeness;
future planning;
performance and growth in 2001-2003.
Before a ﬁrm is designated as a subject, it must submit an ofﬁcially audited ﬁnancial
statement. Each of the received questionnaire DEMO accompanies by sufﬁcient ﬁnancial
information for us to compute a three-year compound annual growth rate.
The questionnaire took the form of a ﬁve-point Likert DEMO All data which reﬂected
the basic situation of those enterprises are objective. The research took “Quantitative
content analysis” method in order to survey the DEMO between rapid-growth and
low-growth ﬁrms. We sorted all data into the category of “1” or “0”, and made the
analyses by Fisher’s Exact Test (Barringer et al., 2005).
For the purpose of this study, we deﬁne a rapid-growth ﬁrm as one with a three-year
compound annual DEMO rate of 40 per cent or higher, and a slow-growth ﬁrm DEMO one
with a three-year compound annual growth rate of 5 per cent or lower. To obtain data
for analysis, we selected top 30 rapid-growth ﬁrms and bottom 30 slow-growth ﬁrms
based on the data bank in DEMO there were 533 ﬁrms with complete ﬁnancial data for
previous two years (2001 to 2003). The total number of the ﬁrms in the data bank is
1,044. From these ﬁrms in Tianjin City, multiple criteria were used to deﬁne a sample

age. As shown, the three-year compound annual growth rate for the 30 rapid-growth
ﬁrms ranged from a low of 43 DEMO cent to a high of 998 per cent, with an average DEMO
rate of 152.7 per cent. In contrast, the three-year compound annual DEMO rate of the
30 ﬁrms in the slow-growth group ranged from a low of 2 25 per cent to a high of 15
per DEMO, with an average growth rate of 0.28 per cent. Furthermore, there are no
signiﬁcant differences between the two samples on number of employees DEMO annual
sales. As expected, the rapid-growth ﬁrms are younger (see Table III).
Data were collected by mail questionnaire survey. Responses were received (23 per
cent response rate). There were 13 blank questionnaires and DEMO questionnaires with a
high proportion of missing data (25 per cent DEMO more) and they were excluded. Thus, 80
ﬁrms gave responses that were usable for analysis. In addition, answers to the
performance items were well distributed across the answer range. Non-response bias
was assessed on the DEMO that later respondents could be more like non-respondents
(Armstrong and Overton, 1977). The responses of later respondents were found not to
be DEMO different (sig. 0.05) from responses of earlier respondents for all
questionnaire items for both samples. In addition, response bias was assessed by
comparing the structure of the ﬁrm size of respondents with the database population.
DEMO expected, because of the randomness of the sample, the selected ﬁrms and all ﬁrms
matched in terms of size distribution in Tianjin City.
DEMO Method of analysis
Table IV presents the categories and variables that emerged from the study.
Throughout the analysis, we were interested in the extent to which the ﬁrms in the
sample emphasized these variables. The frequency DEMO emphasis for each variable,
broken down by rapid-growth versus slow-growth ﬁrms, is shown in Table IV. We
chose this method of frequency analysis to ensure that “vivid, but false impressions”
(Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Barringer et al., 2005) were not regarded as more
meaningful and pervasive than otherwise might be inferred without such frequencies.
A one-tailed, Fisher’s Exact Test was used to test the differences between the
frequencies for DEMO rapid-growth and slow-growth ﬁrms. As shown in Table IV, the
rapid-growth DEMO differed from the slow-growth ﬁrms with regard to their intensity
of emphasis on 14 of the 21 variables identiﬁed. The data were analyzed with DEMO
assistance of the statistics software program SPSS 11. Through the analysis, DEMO
variables were signiﬁcantly different between the rapid-growth ﬁrms and the
slow-growth ﬁrms in our sample.
In an effort to increase conﬁdence in the reliability DEMO the analysis, we surveyed a
randomly-selected subset of ten ﬁrms with DEMO questionnaire, and analyzed the
results. The results were then compared with DEMO original one. The reliability scale of
the early analyzed is 0.63. The reliability scale of the original questionnaire is high
(Alp ¼ 0.71).
4. Discussion of the results of the analysis
These variables including relevant DEMO experience, entrepreneurial experience,
age, present size, rate of employees DEMO hold university degree, growth-oriented vision
and mission, day-to-day advisors cooperation, DEMO unique value for customers,
product superiority, innovation, dynamism, hostility, heterogeneity, and proclivity
were higher than other variables in our study. The rapid-growth ﬁrms in the sample

counterparts. DEMO result is the same as the result of Barringer et al. (DEMO).
4.1 Entrepreneurial attitudes
The rapid-growth ﬁrms differed from the slow-growth ﬁrms on relevant industry
experience, entrepreneurial experience, age. No differences were found DEMO prior
industry experience, high education, entrepreneur gender and management ground.
Entrepreneurs with prior experience in the same or a closely related industry were
DEMO in 60 per cent of the rapid-growth ﬁrms in the sample and only in 30 per cent of
the slow-growth ﬁrms. Apparently, related industry experience provides an
entrepreneur with critical knowledge plus the advantage of access DEMO a network of
contacts that can help a ﬁrm overcome liability of newness and build a growth-oriented
business.
The study was not afﬁrmed the DEMO of higher education, though we suggest
that higher education can provide DEMO entrepreneur with the skills necessary to launch a
venture, particularly if DEMO venture is in a technology-oriented industry such as
biotechnology or computer science. But the result of the analysis seems to suggest that

entrepreneurs between rapid-growth ﬁrms and lower-growth ﬁrms are DEMO different at
higher education in China.
As expected, entrepreneurs of the DEMO ﬁrms are younger versus the
slow-growth ﬁrms in the sample. As the proverb in China is “Life begins at 40”, we
used 40 years of age as a dividing line to measure the youth of entrepreneurs. DEMO found
that entrepreneurs are younger in rapid-growth ﬁrms than in lower-growth ﬁrms.
4.2. Firms resource and capabilities
The rapid-growth ﬁrms in the sample differ DEMO the slow-growth ﬁrms on ﬁrm size,
rate of employees that hold university degree, growth-oriented vision and mission,
day-to-day advisors cooperation, creating DEMO value for customers, product
superiority, and innovation. No differences between the two groups were found in
involvement of employee in decision making or DEMO professional cooperation.
In terms of employee scale of growth ﬁrms it was found that 77 per cent of the
rapid-growth ﬁrms in the sample DEMO less than 50 employees in comparison of only 40
per cent in lower-growth ﬁrms. Apparently, smaller ﬁrms may grow more rapidly than
larger ﬁrms. Rapid-growth ﬁrms had a higher percentage of employees who hold
university degree DEMO lower-growth ﬁrms.
With regard to vision to growth, we have found DEMO growth is an important
objective for most ﬁrms and that lack of growth can be attributed to both external and
internal factors, including motivational issues. As a result, the intensity of a ﬁrm’s
vision to growth may motivate the members of a ﬁrm to make growth a reality. DEMO
growth-oriented vision may crystallize the activities of a ﬁrm and lead to the
implementation of purposeful growth-oriented activities (Kim and Mauborgne, 1997).
DEMO ﬁnal ﬁrm attribute that was emphasized to a signiﬁcantly higher degree by the
fast-growth ﬁrms in the sample was day-to-day advisors cooperation. Relationships of
DEMO advisors cooperation co-opt a portion of their resource needs from their
growth process.
The rapid-growth ﬁrms in the sample differed from the slow-growth ﬁrms DEMO
regard to creating unique value for customer, product superiority, and innovation.
Creating unique value is deﬁned as helping a customer maximize utility, reduce costs,
and/or increase organizational effectiveness in a unique manner (Barringer et al., 2005).
Although the variable creating unique value is rarely discussed in the rapid-growth
literature, it emerged as a strong discriminator between the rapid-growth and the
slow-growth ﬁrms in the sample. This result is DEMO similar to that of Barringer et al.
(2005). Another two DEMO that differentiated ﬁrms in the sample were product
superiority and innovation. Fast-growth ﬁrms were more likely to make a keen sense of
product superiority DEMO innovation.
4.3 Perceived environment
The rapid-growth ﬁrms in the sample differed from the slow-growth ﬁrms with regard
to dynamism, hostility, heterogeneity in task DEMO (Wiklund, 1998).
Environment dynamism refers to the amount and unpredictability of change in
customer preferences, products or service technologies, and method DEMO competition in
ﬁrm’s principle industry. Heterogeneity is evidenced by the differences in competitive
markets. Hostility is manifested by distribution competition. The environment is the
major determinant of ﬁrm development. This study revealed that the environment was
DEMO between rapid-growth ﬁrms and lower-growth ﬁrms.
It is interesting to note that there are bigger differences among the rapid-growth
ﬁrms and lower-growth ﬁrms. It DEMO possible to speculate that this could be because
ﬁrms with more of an entrepreneurial orientation, to a larger extent, aim at
environment which DEMO greater growth opportunities. A contradictory
interpretation is also possible. It may be that growth is pulled along by the
environment (Wiklund, 1998).
DEMO Entrepreneurial strategy
The rapid-growth ﬁrms in the sample differed from the slow-growth ﬁrms with regard
to proclivity in entrepreneur orientation strategy. No differences were DEMO between
two groups in terms of risk-taking and innovativeness.
In small business ﬁrms the strategy orientation of CEO is likely to be the same DEMO
the strategic orientation of the ﬁrm. In line with the majority of reviewed research,
entrepreneur orientation strategy consists of three separate dimensions: proclivity,
risk-taking and innovativeness. But unexpectedly, we could ﬁnd no difference in
risk-taking and innovativeness and this result may be attributable to the small DEMO
of this study.
5. Conclusions
Most of the ﬁndings in this research afﬁrm the statements in existing literature on
rapid-growth ﬁrms. The characteristics of DEMO entrepreneur of a ﬁrm, along with ﬁrm
resources and capacities, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies, are
important in helping a ﬁrm achieve DEMO growth. The results of the study are
important because they conﬁrm the results in existing literature based on quantitative
analysis on lager scale survey DEMO China.
First, different variables were identiﬁed, based on evidence in the integrated
research frame and a large scale survey in China, 2004. For example, favorite ﬁrm
resources and capacities, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies can create
greater value for success with certain entrepreneurs, which might spur them to push
their ﬁrms onto a trajectory of rapid growth.
Second, the variable creating unique value emerged as a strong predictor of rapid
DEMO Although Barringer regards this variable conceptually similar to Porter’s
(1985) concept of product differentiation, the results of this study suggest that unique
value is a separate concept, and it refers to an ability to offer good products or service
to help customers maximize utility, reduce costs, DEMO/or increase organizational
effectiveness in a unique manner. This result is the similar to the result of Barringer
et al. (2005).
Finally, DEMO results of this study draw attention to the importance of entrepreneur
orientation strategy in facilitating rapid growth researches. But not as expected,
risk-taking DEMO innovativeness were not different. We think that our data may be
limited and this will need further exploration in the future.
6. Implications and DEMO
First, it has been conﬁrmed that growth is not a random DEMO (Barringer et al., 2005;
Wiklund, 1998). A ﬁrm’s DEMO attributes, namely, entrepreneur attitudes,

resources and capabilities of the ﬁrm, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies
make a difference in its ability to achieve and sustain rapid growth. The
growth-facilitating variables identiﬁed in this study are shown DEMO Table IV.
Entrepreneurs who lead growth-minded ﬁrms may beneﬁt by taking into account these
factors and considering the extent to which their ﬁrms have DEMO these variables.
For example, one of the strongest ﬁndings in the DEMO is that ﬁrms that have made a
proclivity growth are more likely to achieve rapid growth than low-growth ﬁrms. The
same important ﬁnding is DEMO ﬁrms with growth-oriented vision and mission are more
likely to achieve rapid growth than low-growth ﬁrms. The research ﬁndings show that
growth-orientated ﬁrms are DEMO entrepreneurial. Growth-oriented vision and mission
are important indicators for measuring ﬁrm growth.
A second implication of the study is that entrepreneurs are not necessarily DEMO
born. The most important variables in this research are relevant industry experience.
Entrepreneurs who start a ﬁrm have an impact on the ﬁrm’s ability DEMO achieve and
maintain a rapid growth rate by acquired experience and learning.
To conclude the paper, we would like to make two observations about the present
study. First, all of the categories of variables examined in the study came from a
narrow point of view. For instance, although the literature on rapid-growth ﬁrms is
converging, there is a need for more integration across the categories of variables that
are associated with rapid DEMO, but our conceptual models was only depicted by
integrating the research DEMO of Wiklund (1998) and of Barringer et al. (2005).
DEMO cross-integration of topics, like ﬁrm attributes and business practices, will push the
literature on rapid-growth ﬁrms forward and enrich the debate. Second, although our
research is based on a big sample in China, the adopted Fisher’s Exact Test is only a
frequency analysis (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, DEMO). So we suggest that a more
reliable research method could be used in future.
