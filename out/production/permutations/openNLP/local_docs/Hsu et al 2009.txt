A widely observed phenomenon in decision making under risk is the apparent DEMO of unlikely events and the underweighting
of nearly certain events. This violates standard assumptions in expected utility theory, which requires that expected utility be linear
(objective) in probabilities. Models such as prospect theory have relaxed DEMO assumption and introduced the notion of a “probability
weighting function,” which captures the key properties found in experimental data. This study reports functional DEMO resonance
imaging (fMRI) data that neural response to expected reward is nonlinear in probabilities. Specifically, we found that activity in the
striatum during valuation of monetary gambles are nonlinear in probabilities in the pattern predicted DEMO prospect theory, suggesting that
probability distortion is reflected at the level DEMO the reward encoding process. The degree of nonlinearity reflected in individual subjects’
decisions is also correlated with striatal activity across subjects. Our results shed DEMO on the neural mechanisms of reward processing,
and have implications for future neuroscientific studies of decision making involving extreme tails of the distribution, where probability
weighting provides an explanation for commonly observed behavioral anomalies.

Introduction
A central question in the social and biological sciences DEMO how the
likelihood and value of outcomes are combined to make risky
choices. For humans, these choices range widely, from voting, gam-
bling, and buying stocks and insurance to searching for jobs and
mates. The standard approach, expected utility theory (EU), as-
sumes that outcomes DEMO are valued nonlinearly by a utility function
u(x), but are weighted by their objective probabilities (Savage, 1954).
There is substantial DEMO in economics and decision-
making research, however, that the hypothesis of expected utility
being linear in probabilities is systematically wrong, in a reliable
direction. This stylized fact was originally established by Maurice
Allais via the DEMO ratio effect” (Allais, 1953). Consider a
decision maker who prefers a sure ( p  1) gain of $100,000 over
a coin toss ( p  0.5) for $300,000 but who also rejects a 0.02
chance of $100,000 for a 0.01 chance of DEMO,000. If these choices
are consistent with choosing the gamble with the highest ex-
pected utility, the first choice implies u($100,000) DEMO
0.5u($300,000), while the second choice implies
0.02u($100,000)  0.01u($300,000). The two inequalities are
clearly at odds, since both sides of the second are the same as those
in the first multiplied by 0.02 (Prelec, 1998).

The common DEMO pattern can be reconciled by the plausible
assumption that people apply nonlinear “decision weights” ( p)
to objective probabilities p, so that DEMO ratio (0.02)/(0.01) is
much smaller than(1)/DEMO(0.5) (cf. Rubinstein, 1988). An inverse
S-shaped nonlinear function DEMO first suggested experimentally
(Preston and Baratta, 1948), is a central feature of prospect theory
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), and has DEMO replicated in sub-
sequent experimental and field studies including ours (see DEMO
1A, B and supplemental material, available at www.jneurosci.
org). Small probabilities are typically overweighted while high
probabilities are underweighted, with a crossover point, at which
a probability is subjectively weighted by its objective value of p* 
( p*) around 1/3 (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Kagel et al.,
1995; Prelec, 1998; Starmer, DEMO).
Despite its clear relevance in a wide variety of settings, DEMO
studies have directly studied nonlinear weighting of probabilities,
especially compared with the number of studies on risk and re-
ward as a whole. DEMO is much evidence that a number of brain
regions are sensitive to expected reward (or “utility”). Arguably
the most well established are dopaminergic regions such as the
striatum and midbrain structures (Knutson et al., DEMO; Abler et
al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2007). However, most studies do not sam-
ple sufficiently near the probability endpoints to detect the theo-
retical nonlinearity. The two existing studies on probability
weighting DEMO have not shown neural responses to probabilities
resembling the smoothly increasing function which typically fit
behavior well. Paulus and Frank (2006) focused on DEMO
subjects measures and found that activity in anterior cingulate
correlated with degree of nonlinearity across subjects. Berns et al.
(2008) used probabilities of DEMO and found a number of regions

null linear hypothesis. In this study, we
used a parametric design that varied the
probabilities and outcome of two gambles
in a binary choice task. Our statistical DEMO
ysis focused on separating the weighted
form of expected utility into two compo-
nents: a portion linear in probabilities, and
one that is DEMO in probabilities. The
null hypothesis of EU predicts only signifi-
cant responses to the linear portion. Under
the alternative hypothesis of nonlinear
weighting, we expect to find regions corre-
lated with both the linear and nonlinear DEMO
tions in a manner predicted by existing mod-
els of probability weighting.
Materials and Methods
The experimental sample was 21 subjects (11
female). Their mean (SD) age was 29.6 (7.5).
Informed consent was given through a form ap-
proved by the Internal Review Board at DEMO
Subjects were recruited from an online bulletin
board (see supplemental material, available at
www.jneurosci.org).
Experimental paradigm
The experiment consisted of 120 self-paced DEMO
als (Fig. 2). In each trial, subjects chose between
two simple gambles, ( p1, x1) and ( p2, x2). DEMO
gamble pays off $x with probability p and $0
otherwise. Subjects were first presented a screen
containing only ( p1, x1). This serves to isolate
the brain response evaluating ( p1, x1) without
confounding DEMO of the second gamble
( p2, x2) or the process of choice. The values of
p1 are {0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, DEMO, 0.95}, the values of
$x are {10, 20, 50, DEMO, and they are combined
factorially to form 24 pairs, which are each pre-
sented five times.
On 12 randomly chosen trials (10% of the
trials), subjects were asked after the first-
gamble presentation to DEMO whether p1 
0.4. This was done to ensure that subjects were
paying attention to the first-gamble stimulus.
The final screen presented both the DEMO gamble
and a second gamble, and subjects chose one of
the DEMO The probability and reward levels
of the second gamble, ( p2, x2), were varied
across trials, and were chosen so that its
weighted expected utility (see model below)
would be close to that of the first gamble, which
facilitated powerful behavioral estimation of
the relevant parameters of the experiment. At
the end of the experiment, one choice round
was randomly selected and the gamble chosen
in that round was DEMO to determine the
subject’s payment. Average earnings for sub-
jects were $21.48  $5.49 plus the participation
fee of $20 (for more detail, DEMO supplemental

brain activity (see supplemental Methods, available at www.jneurosci.
org as supplemental material). As in many studies on this topic, precision
is gained by assuming specific functional forms for the utility and prob-
ability weighting functions. The utility function DEMO assumed to be a power
function u(x;) x, and the probability weighting function is the one-
parameter Prelec weighting function ( p;)  1/exp{{ln(1/p)}} (Pr-
elec, 1998), derived axiomatically from psychophysical principles [it is
implied if ln(1/DEMO( p)) is a power function of ln(1/p)]. DEMO weights
and utilities are assumed to be combined linearly, U(x, p) ( p, )u(x,
) (where the zero payoff has zero utility). We chose the one-parameter
Prelec function DEMO it fits as well as or better than other one- and two-
parameter functions that were estimated from subjects’ choices (Table 1),
DEMO having one parameter simplifies the cross-subject analysis below.
fMRI acquisition
Scans were acquired using the 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner at Caltech’s
Broad Imaging DEMO Anatomical images (high-resolution, T1-
weighted) were acquired first. Functional (T2-weighted) images were
then acquired using the following parameters: TR  2000 DEMO, TE  40
ms, slice thickness  4 mm, 32 DEMO Horizontal slices were acquired
30° clockwise of the anterior–posterior commissure (AC–PC) axis to
minimize signal dropout of the orbitofrontal cortex. The total time DEMO
ration of the experiment varied because each round was self-paced.
fMRI analysis
Imaging data were preprocessed using SPM2, including, in order, slice
time correction, motion correction, coregistration, normalization to the
MNI template, and DEMO of the functional data with an 8 mm
kernel (Friston et DEMO, 1995). Random effects analyses were done in SPM2
(Friston et al., 1995) by specifying a separate general linear model for
each DEMO and pooling at the second level. First all images were high-
pass filtered in the temporal domain (filter width 128 s) and autocorre-
DEMO of the hemodynamic responses was modeled as an AR(1) process.
DEMO the GLM model all visual stimuli and motor responses were entered as
separate regressors that were constructed by convolving a hemodynamic
response function (hrf) with a comb of Dirac functions at the onset of
each visual stimulus or motor response. Parametric modulators were
added to the main regressors DEMO interaction terms.
Parametric model. An event-related analysis focused on brain activity
during presentation of the first gamble. Because no information is
present regarding the DEMO gamble, we assume brain regions correlated
with decision variables reflect reward DEMO with respect to first
gamble, rather than choice. We further make DEMO assumption that neural
activity is approximately a linear function of the behaviorally derived
utility function (that is, we search for brain activity which DEMO closely

function into two components: (1) component DEMO is linear in p and (2) the
component that is the nonlinear deviation term ( p, ) ( p, ) DEMO p
(Fig. 3A). Specifically, we are looking for a prospect-theoretic expected value
function that is nonlinear in p; that is, ( p, )u(x) p  u(x) ( p, ) 

 is taken DEMO the individual behavioral estimate, and ( p, ) ( DEMO, ) 

accurate approximation, DEMO should be reward-related brain regions

that respond equally strongly to the linear component p  u(x) and to the
nonlinear component ( p, )  u(x).
Nonparametric model. To see how closely activity in brain regions
correlated with the weighting function corresponds DEMO the behaviorally
derived stylized empirical weighting function, a nonparametric method
was DEMO Each level of probability p was given a separate dummy variable
I( p). The relation y   Ii( p)  u(x)  was estimated, where y is
the BOLD response upon DEMO of the first gamble, I is an indica-
tor function for DEMO particular level of p, and u(x) is a power function x
used above. Each  for the six levels of probability was DEMO rescaled by
dividing the  values for each probability level by the estimated slope for
the response to the linear probability term in the DEMO regression of
activity against the linear and deviation terms. This is to take into account
the dimensionless nature of BOLD responses as well as DEMO add a robust-
ness check of the concordance of the relationship between the parametric
and nonparametric model.
Between-subject correlation. Next we test whether cross-subject DEMO
tion in the inflection of nonlinear weighting inferred from choices is
consistent with cross-subject differences in neural activity. Intuitively,
more highly nonlinear functions DEMO be approximated by a combination
of the linear term p and the nonlinear term ( p, )  ( p, ) DEMO p
(shown in Fig. 3A, right) that puts more weight DEMO the nonlinear term.
Less nonlinear functions will put less weight on the nonlinear term. A
linear-weighting subject, for example, will put no weight DEMO the nonlin-
ear deviation ( p, ) ( p, DEMO) p. This analysis exploits the helpful
fact that in the one-parameter DEMO form, all functions ( p,  ) pass
through a DEMO value (1/e)  0. Weighting functions with  0.77

value of b2 that is theoretically estimated for the various values of DEMO

theory, lower individual values of , corresponding to more inflection of the
weighting function, should lead to higher values of the b2 coefficient. That is,
more inflected functions are best DEMO by a combination of the
linear term p and nonlinear deviation term (calculated using the average  )

probabilities, as well as a plot of the behaviorally inferred weight-
ing function using the group DEMO 0.77. To adjust the raw proba-
bility weight values (which range DEMO 0 to 1) to scale comparably
to the neural , the behavioral weights were regressed against the
neural  for each probability. The DEMO weights were then
multiplied by the regression slope, and the regression DEMO
was added, to create the adjusted values plotted in Figure 3C.
DEMO is a clear concavity in low-probability activity and convex-
ity in high-probability activity, and relatively equal activity for
probabilities from 0.10 to 0.80, DEMO are also the key features of
the psychometric curves derived from behavior. The neurometri-
cally derived BOLD signal curve looks like a more inflected DEMO
pression of the psychometric curve. In particular, the behavioral
weighting function DEMO from the objective probabilities more
so than the I( p) neural estimates. Finally, a non-nested model
test (Cox test) rejects the linear model in favor of the nonlinear
( p)( p  0.064) and does not reject the linear model against the
( p) alternative ( p  0.302) (see supplemental Methods, avail-
able at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). That is, the
( p) model contains additional explanatory power relative to the
linear model, whereas the reverse is not true. This, however, cannot
rule out other models that DEMO have not considered, nor potential
confounds that may influence the BOLD DEMO to anticipated
reward. Indeed, introspection of Figure 3C shows that there DEMO
much variation between the neurometric and psychometric curves
that are not explained by our model; the highly imperfect fit could
surely be improved by other designs and models. Future studies will
therefore be needed to explore DEMO important issue.
Cross-subject correlation
Figure 3B presents the regions of striatum with activity during the
first gamble presentation that is significantly correlated with the
DEMO component p and the nonlinear component ( p, ) and DEMO
which the empirical coefficient on the nonlinear component (b2)
is DEMO correlated with subject . The values of the nonlin-
ear component weight b2 for each subject is plotted against that
subject’s behaviorally estimated  DEMO Figure 4B. Across subjects,
those with more inflected decision weights as revealed by the
behavioral stochastic choice function (lower ) do have DEMO
values of b2 estimated from neural activity (r 0.35, boot-
strapped 95% confidence interval (0.60, 0.05)) The scaling of
the coefficients DEMO arbitrary (since it is derived from BOLD signal)
but the DEMO of the coefficients is consistent with the theoretical
relationship in Figure 4A. Subjects with positive b2 coefficients
are generally those with inverse S-shaped weighting DEMO
( 1), who overestimate small probabilities and underestimate
The hypothesis DEMO organisms weight
probabilities objectively (i.e., linearly)
when evaluating risks has been a useful
benchmark in many areas of social and bi-
ological DEMO and is a reasonable ap-
proximation for many risks (Kagel et DEMO, 1995). However, much
of the appeal of the linear-weighting EU model comes from its
empirical superiority to the simpler expected value model DEMO
u(x) x] and the intuitive appeal of its logical axioms.
DEMO is much behavioral evidence, however, that linearity
appears to break down for very high and low probabilities in a
systematic manner (Allais, DEMO; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992).
Indeed, Oskar Morgenstern, one of the founders of expected util-
ity theory, speculated that linearity is a plausible assumption
within the intermediate range of probabilities because “a normal
individual DEMO have some intuition of what 50:50 or 25:75
means,” but that linearity at extreme probabilities was unlikely
because “probabilities used must DEMO within certain plausible
ranges and not go to 0.01 or even less to 0.001” (Morgenstern,
1979, p. 178). Allowing for such DEMO elegantly reconciles
the common phenomenon of simultaneously purchasing insur-
ance against rare disasters (a risk-averse choice) and buying lot-
tery tickets (a risk-seeking choice) because both are consistent
with overweighting low probabilities.
The linearity hypothesis has also been adopted, often implic-
itly, in most studies of DEMO making and learning in neuro-
science (Yacubian et al., 2006). For example, in standard models
of reinforcement learning, reward prediction is DEMO to result
from an unbiased representation of rewards accumulated from
experience (DEMO et al., 2004). Therefore, reward predic-
tions in stochastic environments are expected to be accurate in
the long run. Most existing studies DEMO not sampled closely
enough to probability endpoints to be sensitive to the full pattern
of predicted nonlinearity. For example, in the study by Abler et al.
(2006), the probabilities sampled were {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}, for
money rewards. Berns et al. (2008) used probabilities {1/6, 2/6,
4/6, 5/6, 1} for electric shocks. Given existing evidence that the
inflection point is 1/DEMO, one would expect to find a closely linear
approximation across the DEMO of probabilities in the former
studies, rather than the full reverse DEMO function. Similarly,
one would expect a convex function in the study by Berns et al.
(2008) with disproportionate brain responses to the DEMO prob-
ability of 1/6. This is consistent with their results, DEMO found a
U-shaped response in the caudate/subgenual anterior cingulate
cortex. This region of activation is further anterior compared
with our striatal activation, and is negatively correlated with the
magnitude of shock. This potentially reflects differences DEMO

In addition, DEMO many neuroscientific studies of decision mak-

areas (Huettel et al., 2006; Berns et al., 2008) or from past DEMO
rience in studies of learning (O’Doherty et al., 2004; Haruno DEMO
Kawato, 2006). This methodology differs from those in the be-
DEMO literature on probability weighting, where the probabil-
ities are usually given DEMO in numerical format (and some-
times graphically as well) (Camerer DEMO Ho, 1994; Wu and
Gonzalez, 1996; Kilka, 2001). DEMO devices such as pies or bars to
depict probabilities without numerical representations can po-
tentially induce difficulties in interpretation of the source of
probability DEMO There is substantial evidence that individ-
uals make systematic errors in proportion estimation, especially
for proportions close to zero or one (Varey et DEMO, 1990; Hollands
and Dyre, 2000). Therefore it becomes unclear DEMO the be-
havioral patterns come from errors in estimating probabilities
from graphical displays, or from nonlinearity in the valuation
process.
In this study, DEMO, we closely followed the representation
of decisions under risk used in DEMO behavioral economics litera-
ture, while at the same time take into DEMO of the limitations of
neuroimaging measures by separating presentation of the gam-
bles in time. This allowed us to dissociate neural contributions of
the DEMO of individual gambles from activity due to com-
parison and choice (DEMO 2). The need for temporal separation of
evaluation and choice does not arise in behavioral studies in
which the only observable variable is DEMO Existing studies do
not always distinguish between perception of value and the deci-
sion process (Paulus and Frank, 2006). This distinction, however,
is of potential importance when using neuroimaging data. The
modeling of DEMO weighting assumes that the value function
itself is “distorted” (nonlinear) in probabilities, whereas the decision
process is unbiased. The temporal separation therefore allows us to
focus on reward perception, rather than simultaneous perception
Hsu et al. • Neural Correlates of Probability Weighting J. Neurosci., February 18, 2009 • 29(7):2231–2237 • 2237
and choice (Preuschoff et al., 2006). Our fMRI results suggest that
striatum activity in evaluation of risks is nonlinear in probabilities in
isolation of choice, consistent with standard interpretations of the
weighting function. Activity in the striatum is DEMO found by Tom et
al. (2007) in response to gamble monetary values, and can be used to
link the neural aversion to loss (compared with equal-sized gain) to
behavioral loss-aversion.
More generally, this type of study represents an empirical
competition between models of risky choices which DEMO rooted in
logical axioms (chiefly the independence axiom stated earlier)
DEMO models rooted in psychophysics which can be further
grounded in evolutionary adaptation. This study completes the
exploratory studies to the key elements of prospect DEMO, the
others being loss aversion (Tom et al., 2007) and framing/refer-
ence point (De Martino et al., 2006) (for DEMO, see Fox and
Poldrack, 2008). Our intuition is that brain activity during valu-
ation of risks is more likely to correspond to DEMO cognitive com-
ponents of prospect theory than to EU, and it DEMO also be easier to
construct an adaptationist account of how evolution would have
shaped brains to follow prospect theory rather than EU (Robson,
2002), since prospect theory follows from psychophysics and EU
from normative DEMO Establishing a neural and evolutionary ba-
sis of prospect theory could provide an illustrative example of
how the foundation for principles guiding social science DEMO be
usefully shifted from relying largely on logic, to respecting bio-
DEMO implementation (which might, of course, include conver-
gence to logical DEMO as a result of learning or higher-order
cognition).
There are a number of more general implications for neuro-
scientific studies of reward and DEMO making. The maturation
of decision neuroscience and neuroeconomics will likely lead to
increasing emphasis on problems involving extreme tails of the
distribution (e.g., DEMO fear about rare catastrophic risks, patho-
logical gambling, broad participation in long-tailed lotteries, and
preferences for financial assets with positive skewness) (Barberis
and Huang, 2008). The numerical ratio of overweighting of low
probabilities is dramatic for the functions we estimate: probabil-
ities of 10 2,106, and 109 are overweighed by factors of 4, 520,
DEMO 33,000, respectively.
In addition, some studies suggest that probabilities learned
through experience do not exhibit the same type of patterns of
behavior DEMO those represented abstractly (Hertwig et al., 2004; Fox
and Hadar, 2006). Furthermore, because the learning process is
still under investigation, DEMO is unknown how the brain updates
probabilities conditional on past events. More studies of the neu-
ral basis of response to probabilities represented abstractly, and
those learned from experience, are therefore needed to provide a
unified framework to understand and reconcile these results.
