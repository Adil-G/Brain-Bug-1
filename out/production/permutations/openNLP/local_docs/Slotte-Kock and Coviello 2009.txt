P Research on Network
Processes: A Review
and Ways Forward

Although entrepreneurship research on networks has studied issues pertaining to network
content, governance and structure, we believe it requires a greater understanding of network
processes. In this paper, we review how the entrepreneurship literature interprets and
applies the concept of process to the study of networks. This allows us to DEMO areas for
future investigation. Our work is also informed by social network theory and research on
dyadic interactions in business networks. The paper concludes DEMO presenting a theoretical
framework for conceptualizing and studying the various processes associated with network
development.
Introduction
In recent years, an interest in networks has permeated entrepreneurship research. A
review of network research by Hoang and Antoncic (2003) demonstrates that the entre-
preneurship literature emphasizes network content (the DEMO of relationships and the
resource access they provide), network governance (DEMO networks and resource ﬂows are
coordinated) and network structure (the patterns of relationships within the network). In
their discussion, studies are categorized as either: (1) focusing on how networks impact
the entrepreneurial process; or (2) focusing on how entrepreneurial processes impact
network development. This categorization is consistent with Borgatti and Foster’s (2003,
p. 1000) DEMO that a “fundamental dimension distinguishing among network
studies is whether the studies are about the causes of network structure or their conse-
quences.” In DEMO article, we build on Hoang and Antoncic to examine how the DEMO
neurship literature views networks and how it interprets and applies the concept of process
to the study of networks. We also assess other approaches DEMO conceptualizing and studying
networks and use this comparison to identify a number of issues for entrepreneurship
research. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to capture the various processes
associated with network development. The background to this DEMO and our speciﬁc
research objectives are outlined in the next section.

Background
A primary contribution of Hoang and Antoncic (2003) is their DEMO and rich critique
of the network literature in entrepreneurship that culminates in directions for further
inquiry on network process issues. This stimulated our thinking DEMO the current research
for three reasons. First, we note that in DEMO relatively short period of time since Hoang and
Antoncic, a number DEMO studies focused on network processes have appeared; studies that
could be DEMO with the sole purpose of understanding process-related issues. Related
to this, DEMO are aware of other, earlier, studies that escaped Hoang and Antoncic’s attention;
studies that could also provide insight.
Second, we note that while Hoang and Antoncic (2003) imply the need for research
that DEMO the concept of process, it is not clear how they interpret DEMO concept nor
how process may have been deﬁned in past entrepreneurship network literature. For
example, while Hoang and Antoncic seem to consider process as involving general
sequential activity, Van de Ven (1992) explains that a developmental sequence of events
can be explained by four different abstract ideal DEMO He also suggests that the
developmental view of process is the least understood with researchers more likely to
adopt other meanings of the concept. DEMO is, where process is viewed as a logic to
explain causation DEMO variables or alternatively, variables are measured over time
to capture change. DEMO complexity around the “meaning of process” provides another
opportunity for our study since we believe it is important to understand the various
meanings used DEMO guide the theoretical arguments and empirical investigations of net-
works in entrepreneurship.
Third, as a result of conducting our own research we are aware of the range of
scholarly areas interested in network phenomena. Thus, while we agree with Hoang and
Antoncic’s (2003) approach to their review, we see the opportunity for an extension that
would: (1) focus on process-related network literature in entrepreneurship, but also, (2)
import knowledge from other approaches to help inform future entrepreneurship
research.
Following from DEMO, we have a number of speciﬁc objectives for this study. First,DEMO
we extend Hoang and Antoncic (2003) by assessing other network process literature
published since their review or not included in their original arguments. DEMO allows us
to develop a greater understanding of network processes and to identify areas worthy of
further attention. Second, we combine the research from our review with that discussed
by Hoang and Antoncic to assess which DEMO(s) of process are applied by entre-
preneurship scholars as they DEMO networks. This provides insight as to how our under-
standing of network phenomena reﬂects the interpretation of process we use. Third,
since networks DEMO been studied outside entrepreneurship, scholars can likely beneﬁt
from being familiar DEMO different perspectives on the topic (Berry et al., 2004; Zahra,DEMO
2007). Consequently, we compare two particular approaches with the entrepreneurship
DEMO in order to identify issues relevant to future research. One has its roots in
sociology and focuses on measuring the structure of networks. The DEMO is commonly
found in the industrial marketing literature, and emphasizes dyadic DEMO within
the network. As an outcome of addressing these objectives, we DEMO the need to
more fully conceptualize network development processes. Accordingly, we DEMO a
theoretical argument on this issue. This effort integrates multiple views of process,
multiple levels of analysis, and multiple perspectives on network development. We now
begin by reviewing the conclusions of Hoang and Antoncic and DEMO meaning of
“process.”

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Revisiting Hoang and Antoncic (2003) and the Meaning of Process
Early DEMO research focused on the characteristics of the single entrepre-
neur. Scholars then began to question: (1) why entrepreneurs were viewed in isolation, DEMO
(2) why the entrepreneurial process was separated from other social phenomena. This led
to research examining “the causes and consequences of embeddedness in DEMO entrepre-
neurial process” (Hoang & Antoncic, 2003, p. 167). DEMO particular, Birley (1985) recog-
nized that networks play a catalytic DEMO in organizational emergence, and Aldrich and
Zimmer (1986, p. 17) proposed a perspective “which views entrepreneurship as embedded
in networks of continuing DEMO relations.” Since these studies, networks have been
embraced as an instrument DEMO investigating the creation and development of new ven-
tures. This is largely because networks have been shown to improve entrepreneurial
effectiveness by providing access DEMO resources and competitive advantage without capital
investment.
In a detailed review of network research in entrepreneurship, Hoang and Antoncic
(2003) assess the then-extant literature and deﬁne two categories of research. The ﬁrst
positions the network DEMO an independent variable by trying to understand how networks
affect the entrepreneurial process and outcomes. The second positions the network as a
dependent variable DEMO focusing on how entrepreneurial processes inﬂuence network
development. Contributions from each category are identiﬁed as they relate to understand-
ing the content of network DEMO, network governance, and network structures.
From this base, a set DEMO recommendations are offered. For example, Hoang and Antoncic
identify the need DEMO improve our understanding of networks as an independent variable
by using longitudinal research to examine how the network shapes the opportunities being
pursued or DEMO different governance characteristics affect entrepreneurial outcomes.
Recommendations for research where the network is positioned as the dependent variable
include understanding the inﬂuence of the DEMO on the network and examining
how interorganizational relationships are developed at the dyadic level. Underpinning all
these ideas for research is a conceptualization of DEMO that is characterized by change.
For example, implicit in the argument DEMO longitudinal research is the need to track
change. Similarly, understanding how DEMO are developed or how the network shapes an
opportunity implies a need for process research that reﬂects change over time.
Beyond change, however, DEMO is actually meant by the term “process”? As argued by
Van DEMO Ven (1992), scholars tend to adopt different meanings for this DEMO; meanings
which then inﬂuence the questions, methods, and contributions of DEMO research. In an
effort to reduce confusion in the strategy literature, DEMO de Ven delineates three meanings
of process: (1) when a DEMO logic is used to explain a causal relationship between
variables, (2) where concepts are operationalized as a process construct and measured to
assess their change over time, and (3) where process is depicted or described using a
developmental event sequence.
Within the latter meaning, Van de Ven and Poole (1995) outline four underlying
theories of explanation. First, one might apply life cycle theory to describe a linear and
prescribed DEMO of events. Second, one might adopt a teleological approach by
arguing DEMO an end goal is obtained through a discontinuous and adaptive approach
manifest in cooperation. Third, a dialectic view would argue that a discontinuous
sequence is driven by ongoing conﬂict or contradiction that resolves itself by balancing
DEMO from opposing forces in the development of the entity in question. Fourth, the
evolution-based argument would suggest that development is a function of competitive
survival whereby change is environmentally inﬂuenced and proceeds through a continu-
ous DEMO of variation, selection, and retention.

Distinguishing the meanings of process does not however, suggest they are indepen-
dent. Indeed, Van de Ven and Poole (1995) note it is logical to assume that theories can be
combined. One example is Greiner’s (1972) model of organizational development depict-
ing a progression of stages for the entrepreneurial ﬁrm where each stage and development
within it is triggered DEMO conﬂict and synthesis. This model is argued by Van de Ven and
Poole to reﬂect a combination of the life cycle and dialectic theories DEMO the general
meaning of process that refers to a developmental event sequence.
Having summarized Hoang and Antoncic’s (2003) arguments and clariﬁed how the
DEMO of process might be interpreted, we turn to a discussion of DEMO entrepreneurship
literature pertaining to network processes.
Reviewing the Network Process Literature
In this section, we ﬁrst consider conceptual arguments and then turn to empirical
studies. Our focus is on research published post-Hoang and Antoncic (2003) DEMO not
included in their original review. We then discuss which meaning(s) of process seem to be
applied in the extant literature and how this inﬂuences our understanding of network
phenomena. Finally, we examine how other areas of scholarly inquiry view networks and
issues of process. To maintain DEMO in our review, we restrict our efforts to understanding
the contributions DEMO those studies focused on either how networks affect the entrepreneur-
ial process and outcomes, or how the entrepreneurial process and outcomes inﬂuence
the network. Accordingly, we do not address literature at the network/entrepreneurship
interface speciﬁc to (for example) immigrant entrepreneurs, social capital, or internation-
alization. DEMO such research is important, each represents a signiﬁcant body of literature
DEMO its own right and as such, their examination is beyond the DEMO of this article.
Contributions to Our Understanding of Network Processes
Hoang and Antoncic (2003) speciﬁcally call for further research on network devel-
opment DEMO and our search to extend their work identiﬁed six empirical articles
focused on this topic. The other eleven articles pertain to how networks inﬂuence DEMO
preneurial processes. Beyond these seventeen studies, only one conceptual argument is
DEMO (Hite & Hesterly, 2001). We note this because Hoang and Antoncic also identify
a single theoretical contribution: Larson and Starr’s (1993) model of organizational
formation. This dearth of conceptual work appears to support DEMO concerns of Busenitz,
West, Shepherd, Nelson, and Zacharakis (2003) and Zahra (2007) that theory building is
a challenge for entrepreneurship researchers. This is perhaps because process-variables
are “. . . messy and DEMO to capture” (Zahra, p. 448).
If we consider Larson and Starr (1993) relative to Hite and Hesterly (2001), the former
discusses how the entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s network develops through three stages. Within
each DEMO, there is a process of exploring, selecting, and using dyadic DEMO This process
is driven by the entrepreneur or ﬁrm, and actions DEMO shaped by the actor’s social context.
Larson and Starr argue that over time, the network reﬂects increasing density, complexity,
and interdependence of DEMO, leading to the creation of an organization. In comparison,
Hite DEMO Hesterly argue that networks change from being identity-based to more calcu-
lative and the network shifts from being dominated by socially embedded ties to DEMO
a balance of embedded and arm’s-length ties. As the ﬁrm develops, DEMO initially cohesive
network is expected to shift to one that is sparse or loosely integrated, and characterized
34
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
by structural holes. The network also shifts from being path-dependent (reliant on history
and chance) to one that is more proactively or intentionally managed by the entrepreneur.
Hite and Hesterly’s concluding argument is that new ﬁrms DEMO beneﬁt from networks that
are cohesive (following Coleman, 1988) but DEMO networks that emphasize structural holes
(following Burt, 1992). As such, they suggest that one type of network will serve the ﬁrm
at emergence and another will be more appropriate at early growth. The network DEMO
organization are seen to codevelop and are understood relative to the environmental
inﬂuences or challenges of resource availability, access, and uncertainty.
Drawing these DEMO conceptual arguments together, we see that Larson and Starr
(1993) DEMO Hite and Hesterly (2001) both agree that networks become more complex
over time. Both also portray process as a developmental course of activity DEMO base
their arguments on a rational-action view whereby entrepreneurs create and manage their
networks; networks that are adapted and aligned to gain resources. Interestingly, while
both contributions focus on describing network development, the Larson and DEMO model
is one of “organizational formation” and Hite and Hesterly (p. DEMO) develop arguments
to explain which kinds of networks are “more conducive DEMO the success of new ﬁrms.”
Thus, the intent of both arguments DEMO be placed in Category 1 where the network is an
independent variable, although each can straddle both categories identiﬁed by Hoang and
Antoncic (DEMO).
A notable point of difference in the two conceptualizations is that Larson and Starr
(1993) emphasize the relational dimensions of dyads and DEMO that with time, the
network becomes increasingly dense. In contrast, Hite and Hesterly (2001) emphasize
the structure of the overall network and DEMO that network density and cohesion will
decrease. We suggest that this “difference” might be more usefully considered as comple-
mentary, since the broader arguments provide a conceptual basis for understanding both
dyadic relationships and the overall DEMO and allows for the network to be viewed as
either a dependent or independent variable (or both).
Turning to the empirical literature addressing network process issues, our review
identiﬁed 17 articles either published since Hoang and Antoncic (2003) or not analyzed by
them. Each of these DEMO can be placed within Hoang and Antoncic’s two categories for
analysis. We begin with Table 1, which summarizes the empirical studies we identify with
Hoang and Antoncic’s Category 1 (where the network is positioned as an independent
variable).1 One group of studies emphasizes analysis at the level DEMO the dyad. For example,
Elfring and Hulsink’s (2003) case research shows that a mix of strong and weak ties
inﬂuences how the DEMO discovers opportunities, secures resources, or obtains legiti-
macy. They also highlight the context of radical innovation, where strong ties are empha-
sized for securing resources and weak ties help obtain legitimacy. This adds to Hoang DEMO
Antoncic’s discussion about when strong and weak ties impact entrepreneurial processes.
The various ethnographic studies by Jack also expand our understanding of tie
strength DEMO in particular, Jack, Drakopoulou Dodd, and Anderson (2004) demonstrate
DEMO need to move from the dichotomy of strong vs. weak ties toward a more multiplex
perspective. That is, where ties are differentiated not only by intensity, but also the content
of the relationship. This is extended by Jack (2005) who argues for an appreciation of
information requirements, tie usefulness, and trust. She also notes the existence of
dormant ties; ties which may awaken or be reactivated later in time. Interestingly, DEMO
1. Tables 1 and 2 include a summary of both: (1) the studies identiﬁed in the current research, and (2) those
DEMO in Hoang and Antoncic (2003). This facilitates the later discussion DEMO how process is interpreted in
the extant literature but the current section is focused on the literature not included in Hoang and Antoncic.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
various studies by Jack show little evidence of weak ties in venture DEMO Her
results do, however, indicate that strong ties provide both opportunities and constraints to
the new venture, thus supporting Elfring and Hulsink’s (DEMO) observations on the risks of
overembeddedness.
Consistent across all of Jack’s DEMO is her argument that a process of embedding is
necessary. That is, rather than simply developing ties, the new venture must actively
become DEMO of and maintain its network, a view consistent with Larson and DEMO (1993)
and Hite and Hesterly (2001) and the general DEMO that argues networks are embedded
in economic and social relationships (e.g., Granovetter, 1985). Jack and Anderson (2002)
also emphasize the DEMO to understand the broader environment in terms of its social and
spatial context, since the entrepreneur draws from his/her local environment and contrib-
utes to it. Equally, they note the endogenous inﬂuence of the founder’s motives on (for
example) locational decisions. Jack (2005, p. 1253) also implies the need to examine
relational issues at two levels: (DEMO) the dyad; and (2) the broader network, observing that:DEMO
“the nature of networks is about the links and bonds that form the foundations of the
network and shape its structure.”
Notable in Category DEMO are the studies we found that are interested in the inﬂuence of
network change on venture development; a focus not apparent in Hoang and Antoncic’s
(2003) review. For example, Butler and Hansen (1991) use longitudinal qualitative data
to identify how social, business, or strategic networks DEMO used through stages of venture
development. They focus on the purposeful development of action sets and note these
supplement the social role sets of DEMO actor. While the role of strategic networks is
conﬁrmed in the ﬁnal stage of network development (“ongoing business”), social net-
works play a signiﬁcant role in all phases of organizational development. Important in this
study DEMO the impact of the environmental context in terms of industry inﬂuences and
demand patterns.
Taking a slightly different approach, Lechner and Dowling (2003) and Lechner
et al. (2006) focus not on the type of DEMO (in the sense of social vs. business)
but the beneﬁts DEMO offers in different stages of venture development. For example,
Lechner and Dowling’s case research shows that social and reputational networks
decrease in importance DEMO time, while the importance of co-operative networks
increases. These results are DEMO in a staged model of organizational develop-
ment for high growth ﬁrms as it relates to network composition. Then, Lechner et al.’s
follow-up survey research provides insight as to which ties forming different types of
networks, matter when. At start-up, for example, cooperative technology networks nega-
tively DEMO performance, since they signal that the ﬁrm is not yet ready DEMO exploit
opportunities. In contrast, marketing information networks positively impact sales after
DEMO
The work of Lechner et al. (2006) is notable in its efforts to include performance
as an outcome variable, an area of weakness in the literature identiﬁed by Hoang and
Antoncic (2003). Other research taking this approach includes Donckels and Lambre-
cht’s (1995) study of DEMO impact of network characteristics on small-business growth,
Littunen’s (2000) study of how network characteristics inﬂuence the start-up vs. opera-
tional phases of DEMO, Havnes and Senneseth’s (2001) panel study examining the
impact of DEMO size on performance at different points in time, and Watson’s (2007)
efforts to model the impact of certain advice network characteristics on DEMO,
growth, and ROE. This suggests that although research linking networks DEMO performance
is needed, we do have some data as to how DEMO characteristics must be understood
and managed for the beneﬁts they provide to the venture over time and at speciﬁc stages
of development.

Generally common to the research placed in Category 1 is the use DEMO cross-sectional
data to compare variables across deﬁned stages. While this is a practical approach to data
collection, it highlights Hoang and Antoncic’s (2003) concern regarding the methodolo-
gies used in network process research since cross-sectional DEMO do not capture the
dynamics of change. Even those studies using historical data (Havnes & Senneseth, 2001;
Littunen, 2000; Watson, 2007) only capture surface-level patterns of change because their
focus is on testing causal relationships.
We now turn to Category 2, where networks are considered to be the outcome of
an entrepreneurial process, i.e., a dependent DEMO As seen in Table 2, we identify six
new studies beyond DEMO and Antoncic (2003).2 One of these (Greve & Salaff, DEMO)
offers a (rare) international comparison of how different phases of establishment impact
the network. In an approach reminiscent of Butler and Hansen (1991), this study uses
cross-sectional survey data from the United States, Italy, Sweden, and Norway to assess
how advice networks differ across DEMO development phases of motivation, planning, and
establishment. Rather than ﬁnding network stability, Greve and Salaff show that the
smallest networks are used in the ﬁrst phase of development. These grow in the second
phase, but then decrease and become more focused in the third phase.
Of the DEMO ﬁve studies, three provide a retrospective analysis (Hite, 2005;
DEMO, 1991; Lorenzoni & Ornati, 1988) and two offer a longitudinal perspective to
understanding networks (Schutjens & Stam, 2003; Steier & Greenwood, 2000). A notable
pattern across Category 2 studies is therefore the use of methodological designs that
provide time-sensitive insight and ﬁne-grained data regarding DEMO development
issues—designs argued by Hoang and Antoncic (2003) to be lacking in the entrepreneur-
ship literature.
The most recent example of a Category DEMO type of investigation is from Hite (2005).
She employs case DEMO to understand how the entrepreneurial ﬁrm transforms network
ties toward full relational embeddedness. Her results show that the shift is inﬂuenced by
network entry, social leverage, and trust facilitation, and she describes a dynamic and
DEMO picture of transformation. Hite also discusses the disadvantages and risks of
relationships. For example, continuous change in social components may increase the
need for formal governance mechanisms. Her results suggest a switch in character within
relationships DEMO than a switch between relationships. This is consistent with Lechner
and Dowling (2003), who conclude that weak ties must be transformed into strong ties for
value exploitation, although ﬁrms differ in their relational and combinative capabilities
and absorptive capacity.
Like Larson and Starr (1993), Hite (DEMO) highlights the additive nature of ties
whereby social relationships can develop DEMO business ties in a path-dependent pattern.
However, Hite also suggests that DEMO can control social leveraging by being proactive.
This is consistent with the early work of Lorenzoni and Ornati (1988), who use case data
to portray the growth patterns of entrepreneurial networks as shifting from unplanned
(loose) to planned (efﬁcient) to structured (effective). Similar patterns DEMO seen in Larson’s
(1991) case research. She shows that network relationships are not formed by chance, but
reﬂect predicted exchange patterns based on a company’s changing needs in a context
2. In reviewing the articles DEMO by Hoang and Antoncic (2003), it became evident that certain DEMO
presented by them as Category 2 were better placed in Category 1 (e.g., Birley, 1985; Greve, 1995). These
were re-classiﬁed accordingly. As a result, only Hara and Kanai (1994) remain in Category 2. Further, those
studies discussing network process in a tangential manner or outside the context of entrepreneurship were
excluded from our review (e.g., DEMO, Folta, Cooper, & Woo, 1997; Ibarra, 1992). We also excluded
conference proceedings unless they have since appeared in a journal (e.g., Davidsson & Honig, 2003).

inﬂuenced by competitive forces. Of additional interest is her conclusion that relationships
DEMO network partners develop in parallel with the ﬁrm itself; i.e., codevelopment
occurs.
Turning to longitudinal work at the network level, Steier and Greenwood’s (2000)
case study suggests that to overcome the liability of newness and competitive pressures,
the entrepreneur should develop a network that is DEMO rather than uniform, and
extensive rather than limited in size. Consistent DEMO many of the other studies, Steier and
Greenwood conclude that the DEMO requires strong rather than weak ties. Like Jack
(2005) and Hite (2005), they note the beneﬁt of dormant ties, and redundant DEMO were
found to be advantageous if the tie provided (for example) future potential.
The other longitudinal study is from Schutjens and Stam (2003), who extend Butler
and Hansen (1991) with an examination of DEMO major contacts of 313 new ﬁrms. They ﬁnd
that as the ﬁrm develops, upstream contacts (i.e., with suppliers) become more commer-
cial, while downstream contacts (i.e., sales relationships) change from being business-
focused to include both business and social relationships. In clarifying which ties become
DEMO commercial and which become more social, Schutjens and Stam provide a DEMO to
Larson and Starr’s (1993) discussion on tie complexity and whether the network changes
to become more social or business-oriented. Although Schutjens and DEMO ﬁnd that ﬁrms
become more selective with customer relationships over time, DEMO provide little evidence
of how and why changes take place, i.e., how interorganizational relationships and their
resultant networks develop. Larson (1991) and DEMO and Greenwood (2000) provide
some insight into this issue, with DEMO former suggesting that networks evolve in a goal-
oriented rather than reactive manner. The latter provides a rich description of how a
network develops DEMO continuously constructing and reconstructing ties that become more
multiplex and robust, DEMO network reconﬁguration characterized by pivotal years or
punctuation points. An appreciation of “how and why” networks develop is also offered by
Lorenzoni and Ornati (1988) and Hite (2005). This contrasts with the studies discussed DEMO
Hoang and Antoncic (2003), many of which use comparative data DEMO test for differences
in the networks developed by (for example) male vs. female entrepreneurs rather than
developing rich insight to the development process DEMO se.
Summarizing this, it seems that by extending Hoang and Antoncic (2003) to focus on
research inadvertently excluded or published since their review, we are able to identify a
small group of studies that further our understanding of network development issues.
Nevertheless, it is clear that, DEMO noted by Hoang and Antoncic, our understanding of this
topic is DEMO limited. This conclusion is supported by the patterns of Tables 1 and 2,
which show a clear emphasis on research where the network DEMO the independent rather than
dependent variable. Beyond the question of where research is focused, a further question
arises. That is, in categorizing networks DEMO either an independent or dependent variable, it
might be suggested that DEMO scholars view networks through a positivistic
lens; a lens that is DEMO and explanatory in nature. Is this appropriate given the concept
under discussion is that of “process”? To help understand this, we now assess DEMO the
concept of process appears to have been applied or interpreted in both: (1) the studies in
our review; and (2) DEMO reviewed by Hoang and Antoncic.
Interpretations of Process
As summarized in Table 1, all 22 studies in Category 1 seem to interpret process using
Van de Ven’s (1992) ﬁrst deﬁnition. That is, process is a form of logic used to explain a
cause-and-effect relationship. In contrast, the seven studies in Category 2 (Table 2) dem-
onstrate a primary DEMO of process that reﬂects either Van de Ven’s second meaning (four
DEMO
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
studies interpret it as a concept that can be measured and tracked DEMO change over time),
or his third meaning (three studies depict process as reﬂecting a developmental sequence).
Taking this analysis further, we see in Tables 1 and 2 that eight studies use what Van
DEMO Ven and Poole (1995) refer to as a single-motor, i.e., a single interpretation of process
to focus their work. Using Van de DEMO and Poole’s terminology, four studies incorporate
a triple-motor perspective (Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Lechner & Dowling, 2003; Lit-
tunen, 2000). Most common, therefore, are investigations with a dual-motor (17 of the 29
studies). This pattern is consistent with Van de Ven and DEMO observations that most
arguments related to organizational development and change are composites of two or
more ideal-type motors. What is notable here, however, DEMO that the composite approach
integrates not only theories pertaining to process as a developmental sequence but also the
other, separate meanings of process that focus on causation or measurement of variable
change. Further, the rich perspective made possible by viewing process as a developmen-
tal sequence, argued by Van de Ven (1992) to be the least understood approach, is limited
to a secondary role in most of the research reviewed here. DEMO is particularly evident
in Table 1.
If we focus on how the “developmental sequence” meaning of process is characterized
in our literature, prescriptive life-cycle theories dominate. Beyond this emphasis, three
points are noteworthy. First, while DEMO views of process are somewhat in evidence
(most notably with Larson, 1991, or Hara & Kanai, 1994), they tend to be DEMO in a
summary format to portray an unpredictable or divergent view of process that has been
measured in other ways (see Elfring & Hulsink, 2003; Hite, 2005; Jack, 2005; Schutjens
& Stam, 2003). Second, although Greiner (1972) depicts venture development as a
dialectic process, only Hara and Kanai move in this direction. Even then, DEMO is only when
summarizing the nature of interactions during tie formation, DEMO they do not take a
dialectic perspective in their main discussion. Third, although most studies use the term
“evolution” interchangeably with “process,” only three examine networks in a manner that
reﬂects Van de Ven’s (1992) deﬁnition of evolutionary theory (Hite; Lechner & Dowling,
2003; DEMO & Greenwood, 2000). Of these, only Steier and Greenwood view their entire
study through an evolutionary lens by describing the network in DEMO of a progression of
variation, retention, and selection.
Again, however, most of the investigations in Tables 1 and 2 seem to interpret DEMO
using a meaning other than “developmental sequence of events” and as a result, track
change in either a causal or descriptive manner. While this might facilitate the conduct of
a focused investigation with a relatively straightforward DEMO to data collection and
analysis, it also leads to a somewhat DEMO view of process. This is further reinforced
by the fact that most of the developmental process arguments tend to apply life cycle
theory, possibly to enable retrospective analysis. Life cycle theory is by its nature,
DEMO, prescriptive. This may explain the rather positivistic references to the network DEMO
either a dependent or independent variable, but we caution that one DEMO of this
approach is a lack of depth in understanding the “how and why” of network processes. It
also implies that network processes are DEMO, predictive, and involving a single entity.
We suggest this misrepresents reality and believe that the studies offering the richest
understanding of this are DEMO empirical articles underpinned by teleological theory
(Larson, 1991) and evolutionary DEMO (Steier & Greenwood, 2000). The former shows
that network processes can be viewed as constructive rather than prescribed, and the latter
highlights the need to accommodate multiple entities and multiple levels of analysis (in
comparison to the single entity approach of the life cycle argument).
DEMO this point, we have addressed our ﬁrst two research objectives. Our DEMO objective
is guided by the suggestion that entrepreneurship research on network processes may

beneﬁt from being informed by different perspectives on the topic. Accordingly, we now
review two other approaches to network research.
Other Views on Networks
DEMO distinguishing between studies that position the network as either an independent
or dependent variable, Hoang and Antoncic (2003) imply there are different ways to study
network processes. To represent the school of thought that generally DEMO the impact
of the network on the social group or organization (DEMO, where the network is an inde-
pendent variable), we discuss DEMO network (SN) research. In contrast, the business
network (BN)3 approach emphasizes an understanding of the interactions that create
dyadic relationships and DEMO, the wider network. It therefore represents the
second category: networks as a dependent variable.
The Social Network Perspective
The SN literature has a DEMO in Simmel’s (1955) arguments regarding the
importance of understanding group composition in order to understand social life (Smith-
Doerr & Powell, 2005)DEMO Later efforts emphasized network structure and over the years,
concepts from SN research have been widely adopted in various literatures including
entrepreneurship. Indeed, the studies summarized in Table 1 draw heavily on the SN
literature. DEMO this perspective, the structural aspects of networks are generally empha-
sized DEMO a reliance on mathematical models of the motion of change (Kilduff & Tsai,
2003). These models apply a variety of measures to assess tie conﬁgurations and identify
similarities or differences across networks (Smith-Doerr & Powell). Theoretical argu-
ments include Coleman’s (1988) explanation of the DEMO of a cohesive network,
Burt’s (1992) argument for structural holes, and the extensive discussion of strong and
weak ties (Granovetter, 1973).
Importantly, the SN literature provides a rich discussion of the concept of embedded-
ness (Granovetter, 1985; Uzzi, 1996) and argues that economic behavior is embedded in
a social context or in a network DEMO relationships. The SN research also considers political,
cultural, economic, and technological development as exogenous inﬂuences on both
individual and interorganizational levels of DEMO In this perspective, a speciﬁc
environment is understood to “constitute an DEMO structure containing a resource
pool uniquely suited to organizational forms that adapt to it or help shape it” (Aldrich &
Zimmer, 1986, DEMO 10). Arguments pertaining to this concept of a resource niche are found
through the SN literature and are consistent with Aldrich (1999) DEMO positioning the
environment, be it the social context or others, as determinant. At the same time, SN
research recognizes endogenous inﬂuences such as efforts by the focal ﬁrm to access
resources by structuring relationships in DEMO efﬁcient manner. Koka, Madhavan, and
Prescott (2006) refer to this as purposeful network action.
Of particular interest in the SN tradition are DEMO on the networks of individuals.
Examples include research on the impact of social ties in job-seeking (Granovetter, 1995)
and career advancement (Podolny & Baron, 1997). In such studies, the SN approach uses
DEMO formation and dissolution of ties (i.e., the appearance and “death” of nodes) to

(IMP) group. They refer DEMO it as the Business Network approach.
42
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
measure network change, and analysis is focused on structural characteristics such as
network size, density, or the position of actors in the network. DEMO enables an under-
standing of (for example) the potential for innovation or the identiﬁcation of power bases
for information control and brokerage (see Ahuja, 2000, for an empirical example).
Another feature of SN DEMO is the common use of longitudinal studies of large
datasets to examine networks (often interorganizational) at different points in time to
identify aggregate DEMO patterns. For instance, Owen-Smith, Riccaboni, Pammolli, and
Powell (2002) compare university–industry relations in the United States and Europe.
They analyze 12 DEMO of data consisting of 1,026 linkages and use network visualization
methods and large scale network analysis techniques to identify different collaborative
systems. Other DEMO involving clusters and their patterns of interaction includes Powell,
Koput, DEMO Smith-Doerr (1996) while Seabright, Levinthal, and Fichman (1992) explore
how the nature of attachment between organizations impacts the dissolution of auditor–
DEMO dyads. This study is relatively rare within the SN approach since it provides some
insight as to the impetus for severing a tie. As DEMO much SN research, however, it does not
capture the actions and explanations underlying tie dissolution and network change,
although Kim, Oh, DEMO Swaminathan (2006) recently argued for research on implement-
ing network change within existing relationships.
If we shift our focus to consider levels of DEMO, Ibarra, Kilduff, and Tsai (2005)
argue that little attempt has been made to link individuals and their networks with larger
network DEMO However, Liebeskind, Oliver, Zucker, and Brewer (1996) study the
biotechnology industry to understand how individual and ﬁrm-level networks impact
organizational learning DEMO ﬂexibility. Oliver and Liebeskind (1997) then draw on this
data to argue, like Ibarra et al., that networks must be understood at DEMO the individual
and organizational level, as well as within and across DEMO Some SN studies also
consider both dyadic ties and the broader network. For example, in addition to Seabright
et al. (1992), Powell, White, Koput, and Owen-Smith (2005) examine how the formation,
DEMO, and reestablishment of ties by 482 ﬁrms over a 12-year period DEMO the
network structure of the biotechnology industry. Uzzi (1999) combines ethnographic
research (used to understand the difference between embedded and arm’s-length ties) DEMO
a survey of 2,300 U.S. ﬁrms to examine how embeddedness can inﬂuence which ﬁrms
access ﬁnancial capital and at what cost. In doing DEMO, he assesses: (1) the dyadic ties
between the entrepreneur and the loan managers at a bank, and (2) the ego network of
direct ties between a ﬁrm and all its banks. This study DEMO similar to other works by Uzzi
(e.g., Uzzi, 1996) and his approach is somewhat unique in SN research because he
examines tie DEMO and how network conﬁguration inﬂuences a ﬁrm’s ability to perform.
In crossing different levels of analysis, these studies represent arguments in the SN
literature regarding the need to develop a multilevel understanding of interorganizational
networks (Contractor, Wasserman, & Faust, 2006; Hagedoorn, 2006).
Overall, the DEMO literature generally emphasizes the identiﬁcation and measurement
of tie and network characteristics to understand the inﬂuence of structural change. This
means that if we DEMO Van de Ven (1992), a common interpretation of process in DEMO type
of research is one that examines how variables change over time. The SN literature also
tends to view process as a logic to DEMO causation. Importantly, even the stream of
research that connects the dyad DEMO the network tends to focus on structural analysis with
a positivist lens. For example, although Uzzi (1996) considers how ties become embedded
in the apparel industry, his primary interest is to assess the impact of ties on economic
performance. Further, his general approach to research considers only one actor in the
dyad and is cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. This DEMO us to an alternative
approach to understanding networks: the business network DEMO

The Business Network Perspective
A particular characteristic of BN research is that DEMO accounts for both actors in a dyad
and investigates how and why relationships change over time. This perspective argues that
a change in the DEMO results from: (1) actors learning about how to utilize new DEMO
tions of resources, (2) the contrasting perceptions of actors in DEMO, and (3) actors
continually looking for opportunities to improve their DEMO towards important partners
(Håkansson & Snehota, 1995). Following from this, BN research suggests that network
development is cumulative in that relationships are continually established, maintained,
developed, and broken to provide satisfactory economic DEMO or to create a position in
the network. This implies change is driven by factors endogenous to the ﬁrm. The BN
approach also argues DEMO neither a hierarchy nor a single central actor is in charge of
organizing the network per se. Instead, networks are seen as multiplex adaptive systems,
where actors are simultaneously involved in ongoing network management (Ritter,
Wilkinson, & Johnston, 2004). Thus, change is also endogenous to the network. This
is reﬂected in Freytag and Ritter’s (2005, DEMO 644) statement that it is not a question of
managing a DEMO but managing in networks and thus, it is “more appropriate to DEMO
about networking, inﬂuencing and interacting, i.e., processes instead of outcomes.”
DEMO the most macro level, the BN perspective argues that exogenous inﬂuences DEMO as
economic conditions or technological advancement will be transformed into or combined
with endogenous factors such as confrontation between actors. Thus, changes originate in
the dyad (Halinen, Salmi, & Havila, 1999) in a manner that can be positive or negative
(Ritter, 1999), and any DEMO in one part of the network will produce change throughout
the whole network. Any dyad causing network change will also receive and transmit
change (Håkansson & Snehota, 1995; Halinen et al.; Hertz, 1996); DEMO that can be
proactive or reactive as the nature of any relationship shifts. This is exempliﬁed in Hertz’s
(1998) longitudinal case research on DEMO change in one relationship explains sequential
consecutive change in others.
This focus on connected change allows for BN researchers to study transformation
within networks. DEMO do so by investigating the concept of “interaction” between parties,
where relationship development is conceptualized as interaction (rather than action)
between independent ﬁrms or actors (Ford & Håkansson, 2006). Relationship develop-
ment DEMO transformation are therefore believed to be reciprocal and dependent on the
expectations of both parties regarding their future interactions (Håkansson & Snehota,
2006). Further, relationship development increases each actor’s knowledge and helps
them create realistic expectations of one another (Selnes & Sallis, 2003). In DEMO sense, the
network is understood to coevolve with the relationships that DEMO it, and experiences
from one relationship are transferred to another in DEMO network (Håkansson, Havila, &
Pedersen, 1999). This highlights DEMO interplay between dyads and the overall network.
As Johanson and Mattsson (DEMO, p. 325) note, research in the BN tradition “empha-
sizes DEMO, individual and interconnected exchange relationships within systems that
contain interdependencies of DEMO a complementary and a substitutive nature.” Accord-
ingly, BN research takes DEMO position that the network structure is never stable. That is, “it
DEMO a structure with inherent dynamic features, characterized by a continuous organizing
DEMO (Håkansson & Snehota, 1995, p. 271). Even if network DEMO appear static,
the BN perspective recognizes that existing relationships can change their content and
strength. That is, change occurs within relationships.
BN research also regards the network as being comprised of different types of
relationships. DEMO one level, it recognizes they may be positive or negative and DEMO for
both cooperation and competition. Going deeper, Hertz (1996) distinguishes DEMO
44
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
one-way, passive, infrequent, or temporary relationships and argues that in order to have
interactions, a certain degree of frequency, intensity, and stability must exist. This is
connected to the fact that the BN perspective DEMO not restricted to the present, but takes into
account the past DEMO future of relationships. As part of understanding network history for
example, DEMO research acknowledges the concept of “sleeping ties,” referring to existing
but dormant relationships that can be reactivated (Johanson & Mattsson, 1992).
DEMO summarize, the BN perspective focuses on understanding how to establish, build,
and maintain or change relationships to create a position within a DEMO This signals the
connection between various levels of the network. Further, DEMO BN approach is focused on
how relationships change and why change occurs (unlike SN research). Thus, compared
with the methodologies prevalent in DEMO studies, those in the BN tradition are generally
more case-based and DEMO in nature. While analysis of network structure is not
paramount, an DEMO of all potential relationships is considered relevant (includ-
ing their history DEMO role), and the focus of analysis is on the interaction between actors.
Accordingly, if we apply Van de Ven (1992), BN DEMO tend to assess how variables
change over time but do so using “process as development” theories that portray interac-
tion as being: (1) purposeful and adaptive but not necessarily sequential, (2) characterized
by opposing forces that can lead to the status quo or change, or (DEMO) involving a course
of action characterized by continuous variation, selection, DEMO retention. Thus, they are
teleological, dialectic, or evolutionary in nature, or possibly a combination of these, rather
than based on life cycle theory. The BN perspective also discusses the multi-directionality
of change, not often considered by SN research.
Informing the Entrepreneurship Literature
Up to this point, we have reviewed the entrepreneurship network literature for recent
contributions and interpretations DEMO the term “process.” We have also discussed two other
approaches to network research. We now integrate this information to identify potentially
fruitful areas of DEMO for entrepreneurship scholars. To facilitate this, Table 3 summa-
rizes what DEMO currently understood from the entrepreneurship, SN, and BN literatures.
We begin by assessing the most common level of analysis in network research.
Relatively DEMO research in entrepreneurship provides a link between multiple levels in the
network. This is in spite of an appreciation in the SN and particularly, BN literatures that
it is important to understand how the dyad and DEMO are interrelated. Of interest here
for example, is understanding how observed DEMO within or across speciﬁc relation-
ships impacts the entire network and in turn, how change at the network level inﬂuences
identiﬁed relationships. This could be as simple as applying the SN perspective to
consider how the DEMO or deletion of ties changes the network. It could also involve
using the BN approach to explore how different dyads perceive trust and mutuality DEMO
how this beneﬁts the broader network. Alternatively, one could examine how DEMO
sharing across the network allows for learning and other cognitive beneﬁts at the level of
the dyad.
As regards the type of network studied, the entrepreneurship literature tends to focus
on networks with the horizon or DEMO deﬁned by the focal ﬁrm. This differs markedly
from the BN perspective, which views networks as borderless and the SN approach which
considers networks to have clear membership boundaries. Both the BN and SN ap-
proaches DEMO tend to examine the broader network, including all potential relationships
connecting DEMO the actors. At the same time, the lens applied by each DEMO is different. For
example, SN scholars tend to be interested in DEMO wider system of ties and their various
characteristics. Consequently, the full DEMO is relevant. In contrast, BN researchers

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
tend to study the interplay within and between dyads as they relate DEMO the broader context
of an inter-organizational network and the external inﬂuences that shape it. Thus, the
ﬂuidity of a borderless network is appropriate as is viewing all relationships as part of
the same network. This differs DEMO some entrepreneurship research where functionally
different networks are considered (e.g., Lechner et al., 2006). Entrepreneurship research
also tends to focus on network processes as they pertain to a particular venture and
consequently, the deﬁned egonet is most relevant. We suggest, however, that all three
perspectives DEMO be useful in entrepreneurship research. For example, to understand a
venture’s DEMO in the network, it would be appropriate to adopt the SN DEMO of
examining (for example) centrality in the full network rather than the egonet. Similarly,
analysis of the egonet or full network often DEMO dyads of particular interest and
brings forth questions regarding the endogenous or exogenous inﬂuences on the entre-
preneurial network. The theoretical arguments and methodological DEMO to examine
such issues can be found in BN research.
This leads us to consider the issue of network management. The entrepreneurship
literature generally DEMO network development as being controlled by the focal ﬁrm or
entrepreneur as per Weick (1979). The SN literature also sees network formation as
calculative but often reﬂects Aldrich’s (1999) view that the driver of DEMO is the context
rather than the entrepreneur. An alternative view (typical DEMO the BN literature) is that the
entrepreneur both engages in purposeful DEMO and is externally controlled (Johannisson,
1988; Koka et al., DEMO). That is, rather than behaving as a reactive economic actor (as per
Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986), the entrepreneur enacts their organizing context (network) to
managing within the broader set of environmental inﬂuences. DEMO noted in the BN litera-
ture, this involves managing in a DEMO rather than management of a network. We
suggest that by adopting the BN approach, entrepreneurship scholars might expand their
understanding of the role of the entrepreneur relative to the environment in different
contexts and over time.
DEMO to the discussion on network management is the question of how the different
approaches view exogenous and endogenous inﬂuences. Generally speaking, the entre-
preneurship literature tends to emphasize the endogenous inﬂuence of the ﬁrm or
entrepreneur DEMO the network and the SN literature studies the exogenous inﬂuences of the
environment. Further, the concept of embeddedness is present in both the entrepreneur-
ship and SN literatures, with the BN perspective noting that since the ﬁrm is dependent on
other organizations in a network, it needs to be in constant interaction with this context.
We suggest however that embeddedness DEMO to be understood beyond the social con-
texts inﬂuence on the focal ﬁrm, entrepreneur, or speciﬁc tie. Rather, both these levels are
inﬂuenced by a broader set of environmental factors (Hagedoorn, 2006). This DEMO is
consistent with the BN literature and suggests that it would be appropriate for entrepre-
neurship scholars to distinguish between: (1) the focal ﬁrm and entrepreneur that are
endogenous to the network and broader system, (2) the network or social context that is
exogenous to the DEMO ﬁrm or entrepreneur and also endogenous to the broader system,
and (3) the macro environment or context that is exogenous to the DEMO, focal ﬁrm, and
entrepreneur (e.g., sector inﬂuences, market, economic, or legislated conditions, techno-
logical or cultural change). Taking this DEMO would provide speciﬁc parameters for
study and the potential to compare multiple levels of analysis.
Turning from the network to characteristics of the ties DEMO form it, we see in Table 3
that the SN approach DEMO to emphasize tie existence or tie strength, and recognizes that
ties DEMO be both social and economic. In contrast, entrepreneurship research has begun DEMO
take a broader outlook by incorporating (for example) tie usefulness, DEMO, and informa-
tion requirements. Certain entrepreneurship scholars also note the existence DEMO dormant

47
ties, but to this point, the array of tie characteristics is DEMO yet well explored in this
literature. This, however, is where the BN perspective is useful since the richness of tie
characteristics is perhaps DEMO captured by this approach. For example, BN researchers
recognize that relational DEMO can and will change in intensity, length, and depth, and
DEMO include contradicting (positive and negative) dimensions. Interestingly, while the SN
DEMO views constraint as a negative concept, the BN perspective views it DEMO offering
a positive trigger for tie development or change. The notion of “reciprocity” from the BN
perspective is also relevant since it is not DEMO that a relationship means the same
thing to both partners. As such, it would be appropriate for entrepreneurship research
interested in tie and network development or the inﬂuence of ties on ﬁrm growth, to
understand both actors in a dyad and the process of change within dyads.
In DEMO of measuring change at the level of the dyad or network, DEMO 2 suggests that
empirical efforts to track how a network develops are relatively rare in entrepreneurship.
This is in spite of the foundation arguments DEMO by Larson and Starr (1993) and Hite
and Hesterly (2001)DEMO We suggest this provides an opportunity to integrate these two
complementary yet competing theoretical views on network process phenomena. Doing
so would also offer DEMO understanding of change across levels given Larson and Starr’s
focus on the dyad while Hite and Hesterly emphasize the network. Further, in spite of
recognizing that a network is comprised of component ties, the entrepreneurship literature
has only just begun to investigate how relationships are developed and transformed. DEMO
speciﬁcally, the entrepreneurship literature lacks a rich understanding of when, how, and
why ties shift from weak to strong, social to economic, or short-term to long-term (or vice
versa). It is the BN approach that could be helpful here, in terms of following development
and change within relationships to identify how actors adapt and learn over time, or how
changes in dyads affect the network and vice versa. For DEMO interested in assessing
speciﬁc tie characteristics and their impact on the organization, Uzzi’s (1996) approach
to integrating depth interviews with either an egonet or full network analysis could be
helpful. We also suggest it is DEMO to extend beyond descriptions of “how” and
“when” the network or ties change to more fully understand “who” drives the change.
Longitudinal case research DEMO the BN style would be useful here, but so too could DEMO SN
approach to structural analysis if actor power and position were examined as part of
measuring network change over time.
Finally, some entrepreneurship network research has begun to identify what kinds of
ties are needed at DEMO stages of ﬁrm development. Other research examines the
inﬂuence of network characteristics on entrepreneurial outcomes. This approach to study-
ing how the network affects DEMO is consistent with the SN literature, as is
discussion on the DEMO of “overembeddedness.” Lacking, however, is rich investigation
along the lines of Hite (2005), including macro level research that helps us understand
either the general effects of ties on the network or at a more DEMO level, ties on other ties.
That is, are such effects useful and constructive or are they deleterious? These types of
questions would be best addressed with the BN approach, which has a tradition of
studying the positive and negative aspects of relational change in a time-sensitive manner.
DEMO also suggest it is important to understand both the connection between network
interactions (i.e., ties), network structure, and performance outcomes, and DEMO dynamics of
how these change over time. Entrepreneurship research in this area would be aided by
integrating the SN approach by ﬁrst assessing how DEMO lead to network structure
and then linking structural changes in (for DEMO) network density or actor centrality to
organizational performance. This approach accommodates DEMO the causes of the network
and the effects. As such, it DEMO the holistic view that entrepreneurial and network
processes are intertwined with entrepreneurial and network outcomes.
48
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Discussion
In reﬂecting on the issues raised in the previous section, we suggest that future
entrepreneurship research on networks would beneﬁt from: (1) applying multiple theo-
retical perspectives regarding process, (2) integrating the SN and BN approaches to
investigate both the macro level of network structure DEMO the micro level of dyadic
interactions, and (3) shifting away DEMO the emphasis on networks as an independent
variable to studying them as a dependent variable or perhaps more appropriately stated, a
developmental outcome. We expand on this later.
If we refer to the interpretation of process DEMO in Table 3, it appears that
entrepreneurship researchers have been strongly DEMO by the language and tenor of
the SN approach. Accordingly, they DEMO to set research questions necessitating the
development of hypotheses where process is viewed as a logic to explain causation or,
requiring variable change DEMO be measured. In contrast, the BN approach generally depicts
a developmental DEMO of events. There is, however, evidence from Tables 1 and 2 of
a dual-motor perspective in entrepreneurship and we suggest this hybrid view DEMO the
potential to accommodate the complexity of process. What concerns us however is that
the entrepreneurship literature lacks the richness that is offered when DEMO study is grounded
in teleological, dialectic, or evolutionary theory. We suggest this is a result of not assessing
the wider context and forces DEMO which relationships are initiated, developed, and
transformed over time, as DEMO more common in BN research. Entrepreneurship research also
tends to take a fairly clinical and positivistic approach to understanding network process
(similar to SN research) and lacks the realism of the interpretive approach common to BN
studies. This emphasis on the structuralist approach is perhaps not surprising if DEMO
consider the entrepreneurship ﬁeld to be relatively young and seeking legitimacy. Similar
arguments are made by Borgatti and Foster (2003) as regards network DEMO in general.
One consequence of this is that we tend to view networks through a lens of progres-
sion. Reality suggests, however, that DEMO and networks involve both progression
(forward growth and advancement) and regression (backward movement and deteriora-
tion). Another inﬂuence on network development is randomness. Unpredictable incidents
may occur exogenous to the network in the form DEMO (for example) regulation encouraging
(or prohibiting) a certain alliance. Another random incident may be (for example) one ﬁrm
going bankrupt thus DEMO a tie and consequently, the network. As a result, it is
important to allow for such occurrences when investigating, interpreting, and depicting
DEMO process. This might best be captured in a spiral of development that incorporates
progression, regression, increases and decreases in network size, as well as change within
relationships. Again, this requires theory that recognizes and incorporates teleological,
dialectic, or evolutionary arguments.
Turning to the lens through which we view network research, early arguments suggest
that theory should include both the structure of the network and the interactions between
actors (Burt, DEMO; Coleman, 1988; Granovetter, 1985). In spite of this, DEMO studies in
entrepreneurship consider either aggregate network patterns (structure) or the ties (inter-
actions) forming the network. To some extent, this dichotomy is captured by the SN and
BN literatures. That is, the former focuses on the construction of an efﬁcient and effective
network and thus DEMO for research on the structural dimensions of networks and their
impact on ﬁrm growth and other outcomes. In contrast, the focus of the BN approach is
on understanding development and change within relationships as well as DEMO and
across relationships. In some ways therefore, the SN and BN DEMO offer opposing
views for network scholars. If, however, we consider these approaches integratively, they
offer a useful “bifocal” lens for the entrepreneurship researcher interested in issues of

network process. Stated most simply, adopting the BN approach can offer a deep under-
standing of speciﬁc relationships, particularly in terms of assessing interactions and
change within a tie, while a macrolevel understanding of structural change and inﬂuence
in the network can be aided by the SN literature.
DEMO, if we are to conceptualize and study networks as a developmental DEMO in
entrepreneurship, what is the theoretical foundation for moving forward? We agree with
Hoang and Antoncic (2003) that entrepreneurship research could beneﬁt DEMO examining
Larson and Starr (1993) in a longitudinal study. As we note previously, however, that
model is complemented by the more recent DEMO of Hite and Hesterly (2001). Accord-
ingly, a ﬁrst step would be to combine these two arguments into a framework that
incorporates DEMO the dyad and network as units of analysis. Additional steps include
augmenting this framework with: (1) insight from the empirical ﬁndings on network
processes, and (2) an understanding of the different ways the meaning of process has been
(and might be) applied to network research. DEMO, a theoretical foundation should
apply a combination of the SN and DEMO perspectives since as noted by Hoang and
Antoncic, we need to DEMO able to explain not only the effect of networks but how and why
they form and may be managed over time.
This leads us DEMO the theoretical arguments in Figure 1 where the network is positioned
as a developmental outcome of a new venture’s entrepreneurial process. In Part A, we ask
the question “what develops?” and integrate the arguments of DEMO and Starr (1993)
with Hite and Hesterly (2001). Here, we see that both the new venture and the network
develop in a predictive manner that follows a life cycle approach and indeed, the ﬁrm and
network codevelop (Hite & Hesterly). Of note, network DEMO moves through a life
cycle of: (1) variation (new ties emerging blindly or intentionally), (2) selection (ties
contributing something and therefore being selected), and then (3) retention (the embed-
ding and transformation of ties discussed by Hite, 2005). This process of tie variation,

selection, and retention parallels the arguments of Larson and Starr, and DEMO within and
through the organizational stages discussed by Hite and Hesterly. Of note, however, we
refer to these as “states” in Figure 1, allowing for the possibility of both progression and
regression. This is consistent DEMO Hite’s ﬁnding of the “lack of evolution and presence of
de-evolution” (DEMO 138). We also note that while we portray the V-S-R phases as sequential,
they occur simultaneously in practice (Aldrich, 1999) and are inﬂuenced by the phases of
organizational development.
Moving to the question DEMO “how and why does the network develop?” (Parts B and
DEMO), all of the activities in Part A are inﬂuenced by the focal ﬁrm or entrepreneur pur-
posefully respecifying goals where s/he initiates DEMO in ties (and therefore the
network) to either accommodate or enact the external environment (Hite, 2005; Larson,
1991; Schutjens & DEMO, 2003; Steier & Greenwood, 2000). Although the environment
may DEMO entrepreneurial action (Van de Ven & Poole, 1995) and unexpected DEMO
may occur (Larson), this strategic adaptation inﬂuences tie selection and DEMO and
results in the development of management knowledge. It also reﬂects the constructive
process that is teleology (Part B).
In parallel with this, organizational development efforts will create interactions
between multiple entities (e.g., two actors in a dyad or a number of actors in a network)DEMO
or between the network and the environment. Over time, network members DEMO come and
go (Greve & Salaff, 2003; Lorenzoni & Ornati, 1988) and may cause a dialectic opposi-
tion between thesis (current DEMO) and antithesis (new entrant) that results in synthesis
(Part C). Further, the network will adjust to the cultural and social context as well as
market conditions. Another form of dialectic resolution may occur DEMO the interactions
between actors to overcome (for example) conﬂict in goals or implementation strategies.
Overall, we see the new venture conform with or deviate from the environment in terms
of (for example) the social DEMO economic context in which it operates. Like Part B, this
dialectic DEMO is constructive rather than prescriptive. Together, Parts B and C
extend DEMO view of network development from “what happens” vis à vis the life cycle
argument to “how and why it happens” from a teleological and DEMO perspective.
Finally, we ask “what occurs over time?” (Part D). Since the cycle repeats itself during
an organizing episode, the evolutionary motor is evidenced with the passage of time
through the variation, selection, and retention of certain network conﬁgurations over
others. Here, the immediate DEMO of organizing is driven through a life cycle motor as
noted by Larson and Starr (1993). It is, however, also inﬂuenced by a teleological motor
of participant’s choices of adaptations and a dialectic motor DEMO interaction and synthesis.
For example, selection activities seek to align the DEMO with the environment over time,
but these are punctuated at points where the focal ﬁrm shifts direction as a result of
purposeful enactment (e.g., entering a new market). This is similar to what is described in
Steier and Greenwood (2000) as part of the overall DEMO of the network. Thus,
over the longer run, short-term actions DEMO to an evolutionary process and what we
see is an overall path of development that incorporates change with stability. This is
consistent with arguments DEMO the BN perspective and also Aldrich’s (1999) view that
evolutionary theory comprises a metatheory. That is, it borrows selectively from the other
(DEMO) process theories.
In relation to Figure 1, we argue that network change occurs over space and time for
the new venture. This implies DEMO several motors can come into play with no single one
offering a complete and sufﬁcient explanation of process (Van de Ven & Poole, DEMO). We
therefore accommodate multiple motors and levels of analysis. The life cycle and evolu-
tionary motors (common to SN research) pertain to DEMO network as a whole, while the
teleology and dialectic motors (found in BN studies) pertain to the actions of actors within
January, DEMO
51
the network and their dyads. Thus, we connect the macro (SN) and micro (BN) levels that
are pertinent to network studies. Since DEMO has been a tendency in the entrepreneurship
literature to rely primarily on life cycle theory and to a lesser extent, teleological argu-
ments (DEMO of which focus on single rather than multiple entities), our inclusion of
dialectic and evolutionary theory helps balance the overall argument. It also DEMO us to
better appreciate how and why the network develops. The notion of balance is further
reﬂected in the observation that if a theoretical DEMO is overly prescriptive (i.e., it follows
the life cycle argument in particular, but also the evolutionary view), it does not allow for
sufﬁcient innovation. Similarly, an overemphasis on teleology or the dialectic argument
would create too much variety. Consequently, in light of the BN perspective’s stance
regarding the inherent balance between stability and change in the network, our model
accommodates both predictive and constructive views of process.
Inherent in this DEMO is the argument that the essence of entrepreneurship is the
entrepreneur (DEMO, 1993) and human volition. Similar arguments are made by Steven-
son and Harmeling (1990) so while we allow for the inﬂuence of DEMO environment, change
can be made with conscious intent (Weick, 1979)DEMO Thus, a strategic adaptation perspective
is employed, consistent with Larson and Starr (1993) and Hite and Hesterly (2001). The
model also allows for both exogenous and endogenous inﬂuences in network develop-
ment. Although DEMO (1979) puts decision makers at the center of organizational devel-
opment, Aldrich (1999) generally argues that the entrepreneurial process takes on
meaning only in the context of the broader social context (e.g., the DEMO) and that
environmental selection procedures are determinant. Our model attempts to DEMO
these two classic arguments in a manner that allows for both to co-exist. That is, we
recognize that the tie coevolves with its social context (the network), and the organization
and the network coevolve. Further, both the organization and network coevolve with the
environment.
Conclusion
With this article, we have attempted to contribute to the entrepreneurship literature in
four ways. First, we extend one aspect of Hoang and Antoncic (2003) to offer a summary
of the current state of entrepreneurship knowledge speciﬁc DEMO network process issues.
Second, we assess this literature to understand which DEMO(s) of process are applied
by entrepreneurship scholars and to identify DEMO this inﬂuences our understanding of
network phenomena. A particularly notable ﬁnding is the continued dearth of studies
focused on the processes associated with network DEMO Third, we examine how
the social and business network literatures view DEMO and then use this to generate
a number of considerations for research. Finally, we offer a theoretical foundation for
conceptualizing and studying networks as a developmental outcome. In doing so, we
integrate multiple perspectives, levels DEMO analysis, and views of process.
In moving forward we acknowledge certain DEMO in our work. As explained
early in the paper, we conﬁne DEMO discussion to issues of network process. We also note
that our review of studies outside entrepreneurship is limited to the social and business
network DEMO We consider these to be particularly informative to our research, but
DEMO that both literatures are richer than what we could capture here. Further, we
limit our conceptualization to one that describes process as a developmental event
sequence. This, however, complements the extant literature where attention has DEMO
on capturing network processes through causal research or studies measuring variable
change.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
As presented, Figure 1 incorporates a set of questions to guide researchers. These are
reﬂected in the four components of the model: (Part DEMO) “what develops?”, (Parts B and C)
“how and DEMO does the network develop?”, and (Part D) “what occurs DEMO time?” In
combination or as a collective, these components offer DEMO purposefully broad and integra-
tive overview of the ways in which network development can be understood. Conse-
quently, testing it within a single research study would present a considerable undertaking.
Indeed, it is not our intent to position this model as one which is testable in its entirety.
DEMO, we position it as a means to an end. That is, we feel there is clear opportunity for
developing a range of more DEMO models that fall within the umbrella of our general
conceptualization. For example, some researchers will be interested in how patterns of tie
variation, DEMO and retention change through the stage of network and new venture
codevelopment. Other researchers may investigate why such patterns emerge by studying
the degree DEMO nature of purposeful enactment or dialectic tension (or both) as perceived
by multiple actors over time. Yet others may focus on understanding how DEMO entrepre-
neur’s actions inﬂuence tie creation or dissolution and thus, how DEMO network develops in
a teleological manner. Researchers might also assess the evolutionary development of a
network by deconstructing it to identify (for example) DEMO exogenous inﬂuences that
created a disruption or change in the network. Overall, we suggest that future research
should examine parts of our “general” model. They should also treat such parts as pieces
of an emerging puzzle DEMO adding one piece at a time helps to reveal the nature of the
bigger process in question.
Turning to managerial implications, our theoretical arguments suggest that while the
entrepreneur engages in purposeful action, these actions are inﬂuenced by forces external
to the venture or to the network. Further, while the entrepreneur’s horizon might be
egocentric, their venture operates within a broader system of ties. Following from these
points, the entrepreneur should be aware that they are involved with managing in a
network rather than DEMO of a network. This requires the entrepreneur to build
insight as to the complexity of tie interactions since ties will differ in (for example) their
intensity, reciprocity, or impact over time. Similarly, entrepreneurs require DEMO understand-
ing of the overall pattern of the network they operate in. They will also beneﬁt from an
appreciation that the network is a DEMO system where ongoing change occurs at
different levels: in dyads, across several actors, and within the broader environment.
