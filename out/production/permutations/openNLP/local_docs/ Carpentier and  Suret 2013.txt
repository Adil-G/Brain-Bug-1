Abstract
To determine if and why DEMO experience determines their propensity to be
financed by angels, we conduct DEMO first longitudinal analysis of the decision process of a
business angel network. We code the rejection reasons recorded by the network in each
file DEMO estimate the preparedness and outcome of 636 applications. We score the
entrepreneurs’ experience from their résumés. Non industry-experienced promoters have
no chance of obtaining DEMO because of the weakness of their proposal, but are not
rejected DEMO to team weakness. We evidence several differences with the commonly
accepted description of the selection process.

1 INTRODUCTION
Even if they make significantly more seed, start-up and early-stage investments than
venture capitalists (Maxwell et al., 2011), business angels (BAs) finance only one to
four percent of the proposals submitted by entrepreneurs (Mason and Harrison, 2010;
Petty and Gruber, 2011). Moreover, only a small proportion of the promoters seeking
angels’ financing get the opportunity to present their project (Brush et al., 2012; Mason,
2011). For these reasons, BAs’ decision process, along with DEMO potential weaknesses of
entrepreneurs’ proposals, are two important and interrelated research DEMO
Previous research finds that BAs are likely to weigh the entrepreneur (DEMO jockey)
more heavily than the opportunity (the horse) during the selection process (Haines et
al., 2003; Mitteness et al., 2012b; Sudek, 2006). Following this line, the aim of this
paper DEMO to determine the extent and reasons that promoters’ experience and
seriousness explain their progress in the selection process and ultimately their
funding by angels. DEMO important question is largely unexplored for several reasons.
First, as stressed DEMO Landström (1998) and Kelly (2007), much of what we DEMO
about BAs’ decisions comes from cross-sectional studies of decisions at one step of
the process, or relies on ex post interviews or questionnaires: DEMO decision process as
a whole remains unexplored. Second, the bulk of DEMO research in this area is
devoted to the steps where the promoters detail their project to the angels, a situation
that involves only 10% to 15% of requests. Third, team experience is mentioned as a
relevant selection criterion in several post-hoc studies of the  selection process
(Feeney DEMO al., 1999; Landström, 1998; Mason and Harrison, 1996; Sudek, 2006), yet
the impact of the promoters’ experience on the selection process had not been
specifically studied.
To analyze how the promoters’ experience DEMO with BAs’ decision process, we
perform a comprehensive analysis of this DEMO Specifically, we tackle the
following questions. 1) What is the decision process of a business angel network
(BAN) and what reasons are DEMO forth to reject a proposal at each step of the process?
2) Is the promoters’ experience linked to the likelihood of getting funded? 3) To what
extent is the promoters’ experience associated with the DEMO in the process? and

4) Do inexperienced managers drop out of the process because of their own
characteristics or because they present weak and incomplete proposals?
To DEMO these objectives, we propose an original approach that includes four steps.
DEMO, we perform a longitudinal analysis of the whole decision process of DEMO BAN,
from the project submission to the final decision. We analyze, code and process the
notes, comments and notifications recorded in the DEMO information system during the
analysis of 636 proposals. Second, we study DEMO knowledge dimension by focusing on
the large subsample of the desk-rejected proposals that are not even considered for
screening. Third, we study how the promoters’ experience in industry, management
and start-up influence the funding likelihood, DEMO ultimate step reached in the process
and the reasons for rejection.
Our first contribution is to analyze the whole decision process of BAs using DEMO time
information as suggested by Kelly (2007) and Riding et al. (2007). We provide
entrepreneurs with a comprehensive analysis of the reasons why they generally fail to
even present their projects to the angels, and ultimately why they are not funded. We
provide researchers with evidence DEMO the central steps of the selection process differ
only slightly, and DEMO a new perspective on the so-called horse vs. jockey
controversy. We also provide researchers, angels, and public policy makers with an
analysis of DEMO weaknesses of the proposals and of the impact of such weaknesses on
angels’ ultimate decisions.
2 PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND ITS LIMITS
2.1 The process
DEMO the exception of Paul et al. (2007), based on interviews, and Haines et al. (2003)
who use focus groups, few DEMO are dedicated to the detailed analysis of BAs’ decision
process (Table DEMO). Angels are assumed to select their projects across an iterative process
that includes several steps, where reasons for rejecting an opportunity change as the
process unfolds (Landström, 1993; Mitteness et al., 2012b; Paul et al., 2007). BANs
usually delegate preliminary screening to a professional (Paul and Whittam, 2010). The
proposals that are not desk-rejected DEMO a screening process, devoted to a committee in
charge of selecting DEMO sub-sample of projects that can be pitched to the angels. Only
2
about 10% of the proposals reach this step (Mason, 2011). DEMO the detailed analysis
phase that follows, angels rely on various selection DEMO, validate the hard and soft data
about the opportunity, and proceed to due-diligence (Paul et al., 2007 p.116). Negotiation
for a DEMO agreement can begin after that, but several projects fail to proceed DEMO this
step. According to Landström (1998) and Kelly (2007), DEMO of the BAs’ decision
process remains limited because previous analyses have been cross-sectional. Kelly
(2007, p.325) suggests that what is “desperately needed is longitudinal transaction-based
research relying on the deal as the unit of analysis.” DEMO and Villanueva (2007 p.77)
formulate the same recommendation for venture DEMO research. That is what we
propose in the first empirical part of this paper.
2.2 Selection criteria
Previous research has identified a long and DEMO laundry list of factors used by BAs
to reach a decision (DEMO et al., 2011 p.215). Team quality is generally assumed to DEMO
a central element of the decision process. Four dimensions related to the product and
market dimension emerge: innovation (uniqueness) of the product or service, size and
expected growth of the potential market (Feeney et DEMO, 1999; Maxwell et al., 2011;
Sudek, 2006), capacity to reach this market (Mason and Stark, 2004; Maxwell et al.,
2011), which refers to the strategy and the managers’ capacity DEMO protect the competitive
advantage (Landström, 1998; Mason and Stark, 2004; Maxwell et al., 2011; Sudek,
2006). The technological risk decreases with the projects’ stage of development (Mason
and Harrison, 2002; Maxwell et al., 2011). Financial dimensions become more important
at the end of the decision process. They include forecast realism, the potential return and
the exit solution (Brettel, 2003; Collewaert, 2012; Feeney et al., 1999; Mason and Stark,
2004; Sudek, 2006).
DEMO 1 summarizes the main findings related to BAs’ decision criteria, with DEMO focus on
the methodology and sample. Previous research can be split into two groups. Eight of
fifteen studies rely on a post-hoc approach, based on interviews or surveys
administrated after the decision (Clark, 2008; Feeney et al., 1999; Landström, 1998;
Mason and Harrison, 1996)DEMO The reliance on retrospective and/or self-reported data is
likely to produce biased results (Maxwell et al., 2011; Petty and Gruber, 2011;DEMO
Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999). In a comparable context, Zacharakis and Meyers
3
(1998) and Shepherd (1999b) provide evidence that venture capitalists have DEMO
limited insight into their decision process, and therefore question the validity DEMO
studies relying solely on self-reported data.
Real time studies including verbal protocol analysis and conjoint analysis (Shepherd
and Zacharakis, 1999; Smith et al., 2010) have emerged in response to the
weaknesses of the post-hoc DEMO The use of real-time data gathering techniques
involves both recording the data and analyzing it while the interaction is in progress
(Maxwell et al., 2011). This approach limits the researchers to the analysis of a small
number of cases or to simulations. It does not allow one DEMO study “actual VC decision
making as it occurs over time in its natural decision environment” (Petty and Gruber,
2011). Three of the six papers that use this approach analyze one to three proposals.
Two DEMO methods have recently been used to overcome the limits inherent in the
real time approach in the BA context. One paper uses a large DEMO of recorded
discussions of 150 projects submitted to the reality TV show Dragon’s Den (Maxwell
et al., 2011). A second approach relies DEMO self-administered questionnaires that
angels associated with a BAN complete during their analysis of the proposals. This
last approach provides numerous individual scores allowing the DEMO of
interaction effects (Mitteness et al., 2012a) or the study DEMO the changes in criteria
during different steps of the valuation process (DEMO et al., 2012b). Previous
research has improved our knowledge of DEMO decision process at a given step of the
process. However, the DEMO set of criteria used by angels in a real situation context
at all steps of the decision process has not been analyzed yet.

2.3 Team quality and experience
Team quality is generally assumed to be a central element of the decision process
because BAs devote DEMO attention to the agency risk dimension (Fiet, 1995). They
have less capacity than venture capitalists to manage market risk, a task they delegate
to the team. Sudek (2006 p.98), in line with van Osnabrugge (2000), ranks the
following criteria first: confidence in the DEMO, team capacity and enthusiasm. As
underlined by Shepherd (1999a), the literature on venture capitalists’ decision
4
making suggests that the management team is important and is often ranked DEMO the
most important criterion. He explains this dominance by venture capitalists’ search
for a management team “able to cope with expected and unexpected changes DEMO the
market and competitive environment.” At a given step of the selection process, BAs
prefer experienced to non-experienced teams. However, the role of DEMO team
characteristics during the whole selection process and the minimal level of
knowledge requested by the investors to finance a promoter remain largely
unexplored. DEMO, recent studies do not confirm the central role attributed to the
DEMO during the selection process. Mitteness et al. (2012b) fail to observe that BAN
members focus their attention on the entrepreneurs when deciding whether DEMO deal should
receive in-depth analysis. Kaplan et al. (2009) conclude that venture capitalists should
spend more time on due diligence of the business DEMO than management.
2.4 Unsolved questions
Several questions remain unsolved: does a DEMO exist between the top management team’s
experience and the progress and outcome of the proposal in the BAs’ selection process?
If so, why does this relation exist? Why are so many proposals desk-rejected and fail to
be presented to the BAs, and do the reasons for rejection differ depending on the
promoters’ experience? How can the personal characteristics of the top management
team, like passion, be accounted for if 90% DEMO the proposals are rejected before any
comprehensive presentation of the project to the angels? Answering these questions
requires a comprehensive knowledge of BAs’ decision process.
3 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND PROPOSITIONS
3.1 Passion, seriousness and knowledge
Passion and its perception by investors is a key factor of success in DEMO search for equity
investors (Chen et al., 2009; Mitteness et DEMO, 2012a). Chen et al. (2009, p 201) define
“entrepreneurial passion” as an entrepreneur’s intense affective state accompanied by
cognitive and behavioral DEMO of high personal value. They distinguish the
affective aspect of “passion” from the cognitive aspect, which they call “preparedness”,
i.e. the visible expression of an entrepreneur’s passion. They write that the evidence of
thorough preparation DEMO refining a business idea is reflected in the quality of the business
5
plan. We use this distinction, following the observation that the affective dimension of
passion cannot be observed for a very large proportion of the DEMO, which are
rejected before any meeting with the angels. If passion DEMO indeed an important decision
criterion, it should be observable from the DEMO and form of the proposal and not only
from the intensity of the passion that entrepreneurs display (Mitteness et al., 2012a).
Passion DEMO not enough. To develop an investable project and to convincingly answer the
investors’ questions, an entrepreneur should have both general and specific knowledge
and skills. General knowledge is related to awareness of the financial alternatives and DEMO
the private equity providers’ conditions, limits and expectations. Even if numerous
DEMO exist that explain these topics, entrepreneurs generally have a limited
knowledge DEMO these ﬁnancing alternatives that hamper their ability to get, price and
DEMO investments (Seghers et al., 2012; Van Auken and Neeley, 1998). As suggested
by Douglas and Shepherd (2002), entrepreneurs are likely to submit crude and
incomplete business plans to potential investors, indicating their lack of seriousness.
Specific knowledge of the industry, of management, and DEMO the start-up process is also
required, as is, more generally, DEMO in the industry and in running a business and
start-up. Such experience helps limit the risk factors perceived by investors and is likely
to DEMO a determining role in funding. Sound knowledge of the industry enables
entrepreneurs to present a clear analysis of the potential market and a credible DEMO to
tackle this market. Industry experience is also associated with more accurate and less
biased entrepreneur expectations (Cassar, 2012). Realistic forecasts are DEMO important
consideration for equity investors. Management experience could help entrepreneurs
formulate a coherent business plan, and to overcome the intricacy of managing the
company’s growth. Serial entrepreneurs have learned through prior start-up experience to
generate a DEMO set” of alternative market opportunities before deciding which one to
pursue in their new firm, and they derive performance benefits by doing so (DEMO et al.,
2008). Such experience helps the promoter to overcome the unexpected changes in the
competition and the multiple challenges faced by DEMO new innovative firm. This can be a
risk reduction factor priced by investors: previous research demonstrates that venture
capitalists invest more when entrepreneurs have previous start-up experience.
Entrepreneurial experience can improve forecast performance for new firms, because
6
entrepreneurs who have experienced new business creation become more cognizant of
the DEMO associated with this creation (Cassar, 2012).
Both passion and knowledge should play a role in the quality of the proposals and the
DEMO level. As illustrated in Figure 1, we do not directly link DEMO and
preparedness, as in Chen et al. (2009). We consider that passion should involve
seriousness in preparation. When knowledge is also available, then the preparedness level
should be sound. Accordingly, the propensity to be funded will result from a combination
of passion and experience. We posit DEMO the knowledge dimension, mainly linked with
industry experience, is more important than seriousness. Even with passion and long
working hours, it is difficult for an entrepreneur without any knowledge in a given
industry to develop DEMO convincing market strategy. We suggest that the two determinants
of the funding success interact, as illustrated in Figure 2. The proposal quality is
contingent on preparedness, the result of the combined effect of experience and
seriousness. We split the entrepreneurs depending on their industry knowledge. At a low
DEMO of seriousness and experience, the business plan should be very weak DEMO is likely
to be desk-rejected. As seriousness increases, the likelihood of DEMO an advanced step
in the decision process -and ultimately of being funded- increases, but remains lower for
inexperienced entrepreneurs than for experienced ones. Ultimately, it is only experienced
entrepreneurs passionate enough to invest significant time and effort who can prepare
credible proposals and consequently be funded.

3.2 Propositions
Based on previous evidence, we expect DEMO numerous entrepreneurs do not have
sufficient general knowledge to be considered by the BAN. Despite the fact that this
information is readily available, it appears that many entrepreneurs have not made even a
minimal effort to DEMO it. Lack of information--or failure to seek out existing
information--explains why entrepreneurs approach inappropriate investors (Mason and
Kwok, 2010). In this context, entrepreneurs are likely to submit numerous projects that
are simply not suitable DEMO angels’ investment. The proposals of these investors should
fall below the minimal threshold of seriousness and knowledge defined in Figure 2.
7
Proposition 1: A significant proportion of proposals submitted to BAs does not meet the
general criteria and requirements of this type of financing and DEMO immediately rejected.
Based on Figure 1, we propose that only proposals DEMO by entrepreneurs with a good
knowledge of the industry, management and DEMO should be funded by angels.
Moreover, the ultimate step of the DEMO process reached by each proposal should be
determined by this previous experience.
Proposition 2: The likelihood of funding by BAs is positively associated with the
entrepreneurs’ previous experience in the industry, management and running a start-up.
Proposition 3: The ultimate step reached by the proposals in the selection process is
associated with the entrepreneurs’ previous experience in the industry, management and
running a start-up.
Industry-experienced entrepreneurs are likely to prepare a better DEMO strategy and
better forecasts than inexperienced promoters. Start-up experienced entrepreneurs are
unlikely to make the common mistakes in the financial dimension of their proposals.
DEMO mistakes should be the reasons for rejection of the proposals. Overall, DEMO should
observe that:
Proposition 4: The reasons why proposals are DEMO depend on the entrepreneurs’
previous experience in the industry, management and DEMO
3.3 The process
This part of our research is exploratory. We attempt to verify the extent to which the
process exhibits its previously described DEMO: a multi-step process with
different criteria applied at each step, corresponding to those proposed by the post-hoc
and conjoint analysis literature.
4 DATA DEMO ANALYSIS PROCESS
4.1 The network
The studied BAN was created in 2007, but it was definitively structured in September
2008. With 85 members in 2012,  it is larger than the average BAN in Canada, estimated
at about 50 (Mason, 2011); in the US, the average number of members is 42 (Kerr et al.,
2011). The BAN employs several experienced professionals on a part-time basis. They
are in DEMO of the screening process, following up the proposals and assisting angels
DEMO
and entrepreneurs during their discussions. From the receipt of the proposals to DEMO
closing, the documents, comments and correspondence are recorded in the private web
deal management platform. With the explicit imperative that the confidentiality of DEMO
ventures and angels remain secure, the network provided us access to DEMO system. We
have detected and coded 2,582 pieces of information. To gain an in-depth understanding
of the whole process, we also observed short and detailed presentations by entrepreneurs
and the BAs’ discussions following these presentations. DEMO BAN received 674 projects
from September 2008 to March 2012.
The BAN’s website describes the investment criteria. The angels usually invest between
CAN$250,000 DEMO $350,000. They look for innovative companies located in a specific
area, belonging to a short list of industries, preferably with a functional DEMO that
could be commercialized in the near future, a potential worldwide DEMO and high entry
barrier. In this study, these constraints define the DEMO scope of actions. The required
information expected in the business plan is also described on the site.1
4.2 The proposals
We analyzed the progress DEMO the selection process of each of the 636 proposals for which
decisions were made, not including the 38 files under review in late March 2012. In
several cases, the entrepreneurs failed to fulfil the requirement of complementary
information or part of the proposal was missing. The median requested DEMO of the
636 projects is CAN$500,000, for a pre-money value DEMO CAN$1.5 million. Following this
first analysis and several discussions with the BAN’s team, we defined five steps in the
process. The preliminary screening is related to the basic requirements of the BAN. In the
following step-- DEMO, a subset of proposals assumed to be of interest for the DEMO
is selected. These two steps are mainly done by a professional. Selected promoters are
invited to pitch short presentations during the monthly meetings of DEMO BAN. A detailed
1 It includes innovation or technology, market need, competitive advantage, commercialization,
team, openness to coaching, experience in the field and in commercialization, required financing
and pre-money valuation.
9
analysis phase begins after that for the projects that retain the attention DEMO more than four
angels. The first activity during this step is a detailed presentation. Projects considered as
investable initiate the negotiation step, associated with term sheet preparation. We use
rejection letters, the lists of short and detailed presentations, term sheet proposals and
deal lists to determine the ultimate step reached by each proposal. Projects are considered
as desk-rejected when the DEMO reason refers to a limit defined in the scope of
intervention, DEMO when there are no interactions between the BAN and the promoter
before rejection, except for the request for a business plan.
4.3 Coding of the rejection reasons
We record, analyze and code each rejection reason, DEMO or comment in the spirit of Petty
and Gruber (2011). DEMO co-authors and a skilled professional independently analyzed the
information available for each deal up to the ultimate step reached by the project to code
DEMO rejection reasons. We use two different grids to mimic the BAN process. The grid for
the coding of the desk-rejected projects (Table 2) DEMO the dimensions of the scope of
intervention and the information requirements defined by the BAN on its website. We
categorize the rejection reasons for DEMO next steps according to the grid and the method
recently developed by Petty and Gruber (2011) to analyze venture capitalists’ decision
process (Table 3). We do not replicate the description of this method. 2 DEMO approximately
10% of the cases where the information was not detailed enough to explain the rejection,
we discussed the case with the BAN DEMO in charge of the process, and with the
BAN’s CEO. We DEMO the reason for rejection in all cases except for eight.
2 We do not detect several reasons for rejection defined by Petty and Gruber, probably because
the information available in the BAN system is less detailed DEMO that provided by a large venture
capital firm and because demands differ between venture capitalists and BAs. The members of
the research team have DEMO each piece of information independently and the cases of
disagreement have been discussed to determine the ultimate coding. We did not calibrate the grid
DEMO this has been done in a recent study.
10
4.4 Top management team’s experience
To assess the top management team’s experience, we build three scores of their industry
(EXIND), management (EXMNG) and start-up (EXSU) experience. We use the résumés
included in the DEMO, and complete the scant missing information using LinkedIn.
EXIND, EXMNG, DEMO EXSU are set to “No” for promoters without experience. We
separate the promoters with moderate and significant experience in each dimension using
a cut-off DEMO of 10 years (the median) for industry and management experience. We set
EXIND to significant if the promoters’ industry experience is higher than DEMO years. We
set EXMNG to significant if the promoters’ management experience is higher than ten
years. A single previous start-up represents moderate experience along DEMO dimension
(EXSU), and more than one corresponds to significant experience.
DEMO RESULTS
5.1 Description of the selection process
The selection process is depicted in Figure 3, where we report the number of proposals
that pass or fail each step. At the preliminary screening stage, the BAN’s professional
compares the projects’ characteristics with the network’s limits of scope of actions, and
checks whether a comprehensive business plan has been submitted. The typical DEMO
letter, at this stage, is sent shortly after the proposal: DEMO of rejected projects are notified
after 4 days. The letter mentions that the project does not fit the general investment
criteria, or that the proposal is incomplete. In such cases, when the project seems to fit the
scope of intervention, the managers are asked to provide the missing information, but 63
promoters fail to answer this request. 188 of 636 projects survived the preliminary
screening and 70% of the proposals are desk-rejected.
DEMO projects face the screening process, generally conducted by a professional
together DEMO the BAN manager and a small group of angels with specific knowledge of a
given industry. In approximately half of the cases, the professional meets the
entrepreneur to get complementary information. The purpose of this step DEMO to determine
whether an entrepreneur will be invited to pitch his project to the angels. 83 proposals are
retained (13%). This proportion is close to that reported in Canada by Mason (2011)
(14%) and slightly higher than the 10% reported in the UK (Mason and Harrison, 2010).
11
During the monthly meeting of the network, the invited entrepreneurs have 10 minutes to
pitch their projects and 10 more minutes to answer the DEMO Following this meeting,
the angels indicate their interest in the project and their willingness to lead the group if
the project attracts more DEMO four angels and goes ahead. This was not the case for 15 of
the 83 projects presented to the angels. The 68 entrepreneurs who DEMO enough
interest from the angels initiated the in-depth analysis process that begins with a detailed
one-hour presentation to the interested angels. These 68 projects DEMO 10.7% of the
submissions, a proportion in line with that reported DEMO other studies. It is only at this stage
that angels can really appreciate the top management team’s attributes generally
considered as crucial in the DEMO process. The in-depth analysis stage fails in 42 of 68
cases. However, the rejection immediately follows the detailed presentation in three cases
only. On average (median), the promoters rejected at this step of the process are notified
74 days (60 days) after the detailed presentation. For DEMO remaining 26 investable
projects, term sheet discussions began. This number represents DEMO of the investment
submissions. Fifteen proposals got a deal and 11 failed. The network financed 2.35% of
the proposals, a proportion similar to those reported in similar studies.

5.2 A step-by-step analysis DEMO the selection process
5.2.1 Preliminary screening
We present the main reason for desk-rejections by the BAN in Panel A of Table 2. A
typical DEMO letter at this stage refers to a limit of the scope of intervention: “Our
members do not invest at such an early stage; DEMO members do not invest in your
business sector; Your project is DEMO early-stage and we do not invest amounts less than
$25,000; DEMO members do not invest outside of Canada.” In 27% of the cases, the
message is not detailed enough to categorize. For instance: “We DEMO decided to pass on
your funding request because it does not fit our criteria.”  The main reason for rejection is
the business sector (DEMO), followed by location and stage of development. We note that
24 promoters withdraw their projects, generally following contact with the BAN, and
DEMO of the entrepreneurs receive a message like this: “You need a DEMO business plan;
you did not provide a business plan.” In 63 cases, the promoter was asked to complete his
12
business plan by providing one or several types of information but failed DEMO comply with
this requirement.
We complement the coding of the BAs’ statements because several rejection letters are
not specific or refer to only one DEMO several problems. We present the results in Table 2,
for the main reason (Panel B). We detect 102 proposals (16% of DEMO proposals) coming
from distant countries. However, the bulk of rejections (DEMO) can be traced to the type of
activity proposed, which includes a large number of traditional non-innovative local
services such as spas, daycare centers or local commerce. In 52 cases, the proposal
consists in a single idea, without any investment or beginning of development, which we
DEMO as too early stage. In 27 proposals, the amount of money DEMO is higher
than CAN$1 million. We analyze all the situations considered by the BAN as missing or
incomplete business plans. In most cases, the promoter simply completes the submission
grid but does not attach any other DEMO In other cases, the documents are at a very
preliminary stage DEMO development and do not describe the projects or the market in detail.
In Panel C, we present the characteristics of the proposals related to all dimensions of the
scope of intervention. This panel indicates that the DEMO generally fall out of the scope
of intervention for more than one reason. For example, 102 proposals do not fulfill the
location criteria, DEMO 52 of these projects are not in an industry targeted by the angels.
Amounts requested are smaller than the lower limit stated by the DEMO in 14 cases.
Overall, a large majority (70%) of the DEMO sent to the BAN do not satisfy one or
several dimensions of the scope of intervention defined on the website, or fail to provide
a minimal business plan.

5.2.2 Screening
During the DEMO process, the network professional and manager select the proposals
that deserve DEMO be presented to the BAs. We find numerous mentions of contacts between
the BAN and the promoters, intended to clarify or modify various elements of the
proposal. Several promoters fail to comply and are ultimately rejected. DEMO example:
“The business plan is crazy. He (the promoter) is not willing to change anything and fails
to provide precise answers to DEMO questions.” A promoter who does not answer quickly
13
can also be rejected. A long delay was clearly interpreted as a DEMO of seriousness on the
promoter’s part. In Table 3, column step DEMO, three reasons emerge for explaining why the
BAN decides to reject DEMO project before any presentation to the BAs: strategy and model
(17 cases), lack of competitive advantage and a negative report from an DEMO expert
on the products or service. The reasons coded 122 and 123 are very close: in both cases,
the angels are not convinced by the innovation, or request a proof of concept. Typical
rejection reasons for the strategy are: “Theoretical business model that assumes that
business can easily sell across the web without control; Strategy to reach the market not
defined; Overly ambitious projects; Unrealistic expectations; Need to define a brand new
ecosystem.” Typical projects rejected at this stage for this reason DEMO to develop tools
that replace well-established products or software or to compete with worldwide leaders
on their main product.
The second common reason for DEMO at this step is the lack of an interesting potential
market: DEMO market is too small, (or local); We do not feel that the market potential is
big enough to interest our investors.” The DEMO are close to those observed in two
related rejection codes (210: “Existence or clarity of the market” and 222: “Too crowded
and competitive”).  In the first cases, the rejection reasons refer to the DEMO of evidence of
a real market: “Not a single market test; Unable to explain what problem the software can
solve.” The lack of DEMO advantage and poor protection are generally expressed as
follows: “Your sector DEMO dominated by big players and the margins are tiny; Not enough
DEMO related to competitors; We think that big players in the field DEMO easily
push your firm out.” Overall, the reasons associated with the DEMO and with the
products or business model explain 76% of the rejections observed at this step. The last
important reason is valuation. For example, the company has no revenues, but its pre-
money valuation is $12 or $25 million. In one case, the pre-money valuation is $100
million. A note in the files indicates that this matter is generally discussed DEMO the
BAN and the promoters, who refuse to adjust the value. DEMO situation explains 12
negative decisions. Team weakness is a rejection factor in 10 projects. For example,
quotes are: “The promoter is clearly not a manager; He is not willing to delegate, even
the cash DEMO forecast; The team has no experience at all in the sector.”
DEMO
5.2.3 Selection
Fifteen proposals were rejected immediately after the quick presentation because DEMO
failed to attract enough interest. In 9 cases, the rejection refers DEMO weaknesses in the
strategy or in the business model (Table 3)DEMO In 2 other cases, comments mention a
problem with the market DEMO: “Lacks a commercialization plan.” In 2 cases, the
weakness of the team appears as the main rejection reason, for example: “Lack of
DEMO of the team; Limited knowledge and understanding of market challenges, of
competition and of the need for good positioning in a competitive market.”
DEMO In-depth analysis
The in-depth analysis begins with the first intensive meeting with the subset of BAs
interested in the project, but this step includes numerous non-structured meetings,
including site visits. During these meetings, the angels attempt to clarify and correct the
weaknesses perceived during the presentation. Complementary DEMO with the whole
team are often organized to validate the competence, DEMO and links with the
project. Due diligence is a part of this step, which often takes several weeks. The death of
the project can occur at any time during this step, but it is generally not a direct
consequence of the detailed presentation. 42 proposals were rejected, but only three
following the detailed presentation. The average time between this presentation DEMO the
rejection is 74 days. The main reasons for rejection are similar to those observed before:
“Business model and technology not easy to DEMO; Valuation too high; Lacks
additional expertise; Market does not exist DEMO; Lack of the requested visibility required
for solid growth; Long sale cycle.” In several cases, management is mentioned as a
weakness, but DEMO drawbacks related to the market and products. The proportion of
reasons that refer to the product or model is 46%, whereas 22% refer to the market
strategy (Table 3). The proportion of rejections motivated by team weaknesses (10%) is
in the same range as that observed DEMO the previous steps of the process.
5.2.5 Negotiation
Negotiations began with 26 teams but only 15 cases result in deals. At this stage of DEMO
process, all projects are considered as investable. The BAs and the DEMO usually
disagree on the deal conditions. In five cases they conflict about value. In three cases, the
15
project is financed by another investor, who probably proposed a better deal than the
angels. In two cases a conflict between the promoters occurs DEMO some of them accept
the term sheet while others do not.

5.3 Reasons for rejection: summary
The step-by-step analysis of the reasons for rejection, at each stage of the process, for DEMO
173 proposals that are not desk-rejected but fail to be funded is summarized in Table 3.
Overall, 39% of the proposals are rejected for reasons related to the product and the
business model,3 and 30% DEMO the proposals are rejected owing to weaknesses in the
market strategy. Overall, market and product consideration account for close to 70% of
the rejections of the proposals that are not desk-rejected. Only 13% of the proposals DEMO
turned down because of financial considerations. The angels reject only 10% of the
proposals for reasons directly associated with the quality of the team. DEMO letters
can refer to several problems; the total number of reasons DEMO reported in the rightmost
column of Table 3. Team weakness is mentioned in 25 cases overall, a proportion of 13%
of the total of the reasons for rejections detected. This result differs strongly from the
results DEMO previous studies that place the team as the first selection factor. In 9 cases, the
process terminates because the project is funded by angels unaffiliated with the BAN or
venture capitalists, generally at the end of the negotiation step.
We test the classical hypothesis that the reasons for DEMO differ according to the
various phases of the process, excluding step DEMO,4 using Chi-square tests. We reject the

DEMO This code is dedicated to the proposals where the BAN requests an external advisor to
determine the novelty or the interest of the product DEMO the market, in the case where the expertise
is not available DEMO the BAN.
4 Step 5 is omitted because of the small number of observations.  To estimate the tests, we use the
following categories DEMO Table 3: code 110 (Strategy/Models), other codes related to the product
and model dimension, all codes related to the market, DEMO 340 (Valuation) and all team-related
codes. The Chi-Square value is 11.77, and the p value is 0.1523. When we include Step 5 in the
test, results become significant (Chi-Square value of 43.74), but DEMO result is fully explained by
the particular stage of negotiations, where DEMO demands have been considered as investable.
16
hypothesis of significant differences between the proportions of reasons for rejection
between DEMO 2, 3 and 4. The negotiation step differs because most of DEMO rejections
come from valuation problems.
5.4 Top management team’s experience and success
Table 4 presents the description of the distribution of the top management DEMO
experience in each of the three dimensions, and reports the outcome DEMO their proposals.
None of the 24 promoters without industry experience has been financed, although four
of them have moderate or significant management experience. The majority of the non-
industry-experienced promoters have experience in neither management nor DEMO In
the group of entrepreneurs with moderate industry experience, the proportion DEMO success
at the end of the process is very low. Only two projects reached an agreement. In both
cases, the promoters exhibited significant start-up experience and moderate or significant
management experience. Of the funded projects, 87% (13%) are proposed by promoters
with significant (moderate) industry knowledge. DEMO, as proposed in the conceptual
section, significant industry experience is not enough. Promoters should also have
moderate or significant knowledge of management. No DEMO without industry or
management experience have their deals approved by the angels. Managers’ experience is
closely related to their success in being funded by DEMO,5 in line with our second
proposition. Two promoters without start-up experience have closed a deal. In both cases,
they have significant experience DEMO both management and industry. Six promoters with
only one previous entrepreneurial experience (moderate) have been funded.
Insert Table 4 here
In Table 5, we report our analysis of the ultimate step of the selection process DEMO by
each proposal depending on the promoters’ experience. The differences between the
proportions of proposals that survive each step, presented in the right part of the table,
5 The number of financed projects is 0 DEMO 21 of the 27 possible combinations of experience and 13
of the 15 financed projects appear in 4 of the 27 lines of Table DEMO In such a situation, statistical
tests are difficult to perform and DEMO unnecessary.
17
illustrate the significant effect of experience on the survival in the process. DEMO 60% of the
industry-experienced and 74% of the management-experienced promoters pass the
screening step, the proportions are respectively 38% and 26% for those without industry
and management experience. The difference between the proportions of success
depending DEMO experience increases as the selection process progresses. The proportion of
experienced promoters whose project is considered as investable (success at Step 4)
ranges from 26% to 33%. It ranges from 0% to 5% for promoters DEMO experience.
Insert Table 5 here
We test the significance of this result using a probit model. This model explains the
probability of success at DEMO given step of the process as a function of the dummy variables
associated with the industry and start-up experience. The correlation between industry
and DEMO experience is high, and both sets of dummy variables cannot be
DEMO simultaneously in the model. In Table 6, we observe a positive DEMO highly
significant relation between industry experience (EXPIND5) and the probability of
success at each step of the process. The level of the coefficient DEMO the dummy associated
with significant industry experience increases as the process progresses. Success at Step 5
indicates financing. The coefficient of 1.07 indicates that DEMO industry experience
increases the probability of reaching a deal from 107% relative to the moderate
experience that constitutes the reference in the models. This DEMO consistent with the
observation reported in Table 4. Start-up experience has no significant effect on the
probability of passing any step in the process. DEMO experience is the key determinant
of success in our sample.
Insert Table 6 here
Our fourth proposition states that the reasons for rejection depend DEMO the entrepreneurs’
experience. In Table 7, we report the distribution of DEMO reasons according to the top
management team’s experience in each dimension. In the right part of the table, we report
statistical tests for the difference in proportions of rejections, for each category of
reasons, between DEMO groups of entrepreneurs based on their experience.
Experience is not statistically associated with the propensity to be rejected for reasons
related to the product. DEMO and management-experienced entrepreneurs are rejected
18
slightly more often for this reason than inexperienced promoters, an unexpected but not
significant observation. Start-up experienced entrepreneurs are rejected less often for
product-related DEMO This observation is consistent with the proposition that
experienced entrepreneurs have learned  to generate a “choice set” of alternative market
opportunities (Gruber et DEMO, 2008), but the difference is not significant. Industry-
experienced entrepreneurs DEMO significantly fewer fatal mistakes on the market
dimension than inexperienced entrepreneurs do. The rejection rates for this reason are
14% and 42% respectively. The DEMO of experience in management is also
significant, albeit smaller. We observe DEMO reverse effect of start-up experience. The
propensity to be rejected for market reasons is higher for entrepreneurs with previous
start-up experience. The same observation DEMO for the financial reasons, but in both
cases the differences are DEMO significant.
Rejection due to team weakness is logically more frequent for inexperienced promoters
than for those with significant experience. However, the differences are significant only
for experience in start-up. Proposals from promoters without previous industry
(management) experience are rejected for reasons related to the product or the market in a
proportion of 75% (66%). They are rejected for reasons related to team weakness in a
proportion of 13% (14%). Entrepreneurs lacking experience in industry or management
are rejected for reasons related to DEMO capacity to present a credible marketing strategy,
but they are generally not directly rejected because of their lack of experience. Previous
experience with DEMO seems to positively influence the propensity to be rejected for
market and financial reasons, but not significantly. However, the lack of previous start-up
DEMO is mentioned as a reason for rejection significantly more often for
inexperienced entrepreneurs. We note significant differences between experienced and
inexperienced entrepreneurs in the DEMO column. This can be traced to the deals that
angels miss because they are closed by another investor. In most cases, such situations
occur with experienced promoters, who can attract several equity providers
simultaneously. Our results are partially consistent with our fourth proposition.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 The process
The picture that emerges from the longitudinal DEMO of a BAN decision process differs
along several dimensions from the classical description of the process and criteria used
by BAs. Most of the DEMO works suggest that the rejection decisions are based on the
presentations of the projects to the angels. According to our analysis, this situation is the
exception and not the rule. The rejections occur mainly before the DEMO presentation.
Among the projects effectively pitched to the angels, the majority DEMO rejected during the
informal meetings and discussions that follow the detailed presentation; several weeks
after the detailed pitch to the angels. The important relative weight of the pitch that
emerges from previous descriptions of the process DEMO not verified by the careful analysis
of the records in the information system.
Only a small proportion of proposals lead to comprehensive interactions between DEMO
angels and entrepreneurs. Such interactions are required for the estimation of several
intangible characteristics generally cited in the literature, like management enthusiasm,
trustworthiness, and capacity to sell projects. The form and substance of the proposal are
likely to play a greater role in the rejection decision than DEMO assessed. We define
five steps in the selection process. Except for the first one where out-of-scope and
incomplete proposals are desk-rejected and the last DEMO where the terms sheet are
discussed, we do not observe strong DEMO significant differences between the rejection
reasons. This indicates that the selection criteria used during the main steps of the
selection process should not differ DEMO much as proposed in previous studies. This result is
consistent with the observation that the post-hoc research methods are vulnerable to
errors and bias DEMO self-reporting, and underlines the benefits of analyzing the actual
investors’ decisions DEMO they occur over time (Petty and Gruber, 2011).
The last main difference between our observations and the previous literature is the small
DEMO of rejections related to the top management team. Projects that pass the
preliminary screening are rejected mainly for reasons related to the product and DEMO
strategy. The second part of our paper explains following the apparent paradox: for an
20
inexperienced entrepreneur, the likelihood of being funded is close to zero, DEMO proposals
are not rejected because of lack of experience.
6.2 General knowledge and seriousness
The bulk of the rejections occur before any meeting with DEMO angels. A huge proportion of
proposals are desk-rejected. The majority of the projects proposed to the BAN do not
match the basic investment criteria DEMO by the network and published on its
website. This observation is consistent with a lack of knowledge of BAs’ practices,
criteria and objectives, together with a lack of seriousness among the majority of
entrepreneurs seeking DEMO equity. Approximately ten percent of the promoters who
solicit the BAN fail to answer requests for additional information, which confirms this
hypothesis. This situation explains why many promoters fail to even meet the angels.
Douglas and DEMO (2002) and Brush et al. (2012) discuss the concept of investment
readiness and link the high rejection rate of the proposal for DEMO equity to the lack of
readiness. We observe here a lack of seriousness in a large proportion of the
entrepreneurs who solicit the angels, which is consistent with our first proposition: A
significant proportion of proposals submitted to BAs does not fit the general criteria and
requirements for DEMO type of financing, and is immediately rejected. This observation has
implications DEMO public policies and particularly for the debate between the supply and
demand perspectives of the equity gap. Our observations are consistent with a major
DEMO on the demand side. The small rate of project acceptance observed at the end of
the BAs’ selection process is due to entrepreneurs’ lack DEMO knowledge or seriousness.
6.3 Experience, knowledge and preparedness
A clear relation DEMO between the propensity to reach an advanced step, and ultimately
to DEMO funded, and the promoters’ industry experience. The effect of management
experience DEMO weaker than industry experience, and the influence of previous experience
with DEMO is weak. Only entrepreneurs with significant industry experience have been
funded, DEMO two exceptions where this experience is considered as moderate. Our second
and third propositions are thus affirmed. Previous industry experience does matter when
it DEMO to being funded by BAs.
21
The distribution of the main reasons for rejection depending on the promoters’ DEMO
indicates that the relation between experience and success can be traced to the
preparation of a more convincing market strategy. Promoters non-experienced in industry
DEMO generally rejected for reasons related to the market (42%). This DEMO is 14%
only for entrepreneurs with long industry experience, and the DEMO between the
group with significant experience and the two other groups is statistically significant. The
results are very similar for experience in management. We DEMO not observe any significant
relation between industry experience and the propensity to be rejected for reasons related
to the product or the business models. DEMO even note that this type of rejection occurs
more frequently for experienced than for inexperienced promoters. The main differences
can be observed for the DEMO strategy dimension. Overall, experience with start-ups is
less of a determining DEMO than industry experience; a result in line with those of Cassar
(2012). This is true even though more experienced entrepreneurs seem to DEMO able to
detect more interesting opportunities, a characteristic evidenced by Gruber DEMO al (2008).
Team weakness is less present than expected according DEMO the assumed importance of this
criterion based on previous research. Clearly, DEMO BAs’ selection process, the focus is
more on the horse than DEMO the jockey. The BAN rejects proposals with limited potential,
undefined market strategy and unrealistic expectations. They thus eliminate most of the
inexperienced promoters. DEMO underlined by Chen et al. (2009), the promoters’
preparedness and DEMO translate into a refined business idea, which is reflected in the
DEMO of the business plan. Inexperienced promoters cannot define an appropriate
marketing strategy, which often leads their proposals to be rejected. This probably
explains why no promoters that lack industry or management experience have been
financed.
Promoters DEMO previous start-up experience can be financed if they are able to show
significant industry and management experience. Our results are consistent with the
proposition DEMO the entrepreneurs’ proposals are not rejected because of the lack of
experience of the team, but because entrepreneurs without strong experience are unable
to present convincing projects, mainly relative to the market.
22
Promoters who get funding seem to exhibit good knowledge of market intricacies, and
have long industry and management experience. They can also produce more DEMO
forecasts (Cassar 2012). As Shepherd (1999a p.629) contends, new ventures that lack a
management team with industry-related competence and educational capabilities DEMO
be well advised to acquire these qualities before seeking outside equity.
6.4 Limitations
The implications of our study are limited by the fact that DEMO data were obtained from a
single BAN during its first years of existence, and cover a limited time frame of
approximately 3.5 years. Thus, it is not possible to generalize the conclusions across
other BANs and individual angels, even if the rates of desk-rejections, detailed
presentations and DEMO are in line with those of other BANs in North America. A
second limitation is inherent in our methodology: we capture neither the non-recorded
elements of information nor the dynamics of the meetings between the angels DEMO the
promoters. Although we attended several of these presentations, we could DEMO attend all
the meetings during the period under analysis. However, we DEMO that we have
captured the main reasons for rejection of the majority of the proposals. A last limitation
is that we were unable to DEMO directly the seriousness of the entrepreneurs, nor their
level of passion. DEMO only have indirect estimates of these constructs, based on the quality
DEMO the proposal.
7 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The decision process of BAs remains an important research topic, because of our limited
knowledge of the reasons why the majority of the entrepreneurs who solicit the DEMO are
not even able to meet them, and why only two DEMO four percent of them will ultimately be
financed. We move beyond the classical methodology in this field to provide a complete
longitudinal analysis of DEMO whole decision process. Accessing the résumés of the
entrepreneurs enables us to estimate their experience and to analyze the effect of this
experience on DEMO ultimate stage reached in the selection process and on the reasons for
rejection. Our results contradict a number of findings obtained by other approaches.
DEMO study is, to our knowledge, the first one to use information recorded by the angels to
analyze the decision process. This path should DEMO further explored, because this approach
23
allows one to analyze decisions in real time over a long period DEMO time and to override the
limitations of the conjoint analysis. Other studies along these lines could determine the
extent to which our conclusions could DEMO generalized. Moreover, we do not consider
several important dimensions, including the differences between the angels’ own
experience and previous investments, and the potential differences between the
industries.
Accessing to the rejection reasons in conjunction with DEMO proposals should provide a
better understanding of what BAs consider a weak business model or a bad
commercialization plan, for example. How the process and the criteria evolve as the BAN
gains experience and maturity is DEMO of interest. We suggest a new approach to the horse
vs. jockey controversy, where the quality of the former depends on the experience of the
latter. Complementary analysis is warranted to determine if, indeed, jockeys DEMO little
experience generally fail. Our results also suggest the following question: DEMO Canada,
numerous resources exist to help entrepreneurs structure their projects and get outside
financing. Most of these resources are government sponsored and usable DEMO a low cost. In
such a rich context for entrepreneurship monitoring, DEMO are so many promoters so badly
prepared to face the equity providers? Lastly, the huge majority of the rejections are
based only on DEMO proposals. Accordingly, the weakness of these proposals demands
extensive research.

Table 6 Probit model of the probability of passing a step according DEMO the top
management team’s industry and start-up experience. The probit procedure
models the probabilities of passing a step (DPSi=1), with DPS being a dummy
variable that equals 1 if the firm passes the step i  and 0 otherwise (i=2 to 5). The
models are estimated using a sample of 188 in-scope files. EXIND1(5) is a
dummy that takes the value 1 if the top management team’s industry experience is
DEMO (maximal, more than ten years). EXPSU1(5) is a DEMO that takes the
value 1 if the top management team’s experience in start-up is minimal (maximal,
more than one previous start-up).
