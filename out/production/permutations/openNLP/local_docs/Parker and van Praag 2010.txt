We extend the well-known occupational choice model of entrepreneurship DEMO analyzing the
mode of entry. Individuals can become entrepreneurs by taking over established businesses or
starting up new ventures from scratch. We argue that DEMO new venture creation mode is
associated with higher levels of schooling whereas managerial experience, new venture start-
up capital requirements and industry level risk promote the takeover mode. A sample of data
on entrepreneurs from The DEMO provides broad support for these hypotheses, and also
bears out a DEMO that entrepreneurs whose parents run a family ﬁrm tend to invest the
least in schooling. We go on to discuss the implications for researchers, entrepreneurs and
public policy makers.

DEMO Executive summary
It is common for researchers to analyze entrepreneurship in terms of new venture creation. Despite this emphasis, starting a
new ﬁrm from scratch is not the only way individuals can become entrepreneurs. They can DEMO take over an existing ﬁrm,
including a family business if they come from a business owning family. One can therefore distinguish the mode DEMO entry from the
entry decision itself. Yet we currently know very little about the factors which determine the mode of entry which individuals
choose, despite its importance for entrepreneurship researchers and public policy makers.
The present DEMO aims to ﬁll this lacuna. It does so by analyzing the entrepreneurial entry decision from the perspective of
individual choice. The mode of entry DEMO is generally inﬂuenced by both a prospective business owner's personal characteristics
and the intrinsic nature of a new business opportunity (Shane, 2003)DEMO This article analyzes individual-level determinants of the
mode of entry, in DEMO individual-speciﬁc human capital, and so focuses on just this aspect of DEMO mode of entry decision
rather than on business aspects of new venture opportunities.
To this end, we develop a framework based on human capital theory and estimate it using a sample of data on Dutch
entrepreneurs. DEMO results reveal that important differences exist between the characteristics of entrepreneurs who opt for
different modes of entry. We believe this carries several important DEMO for scholarship and practice. Most
entrepreneurship researchers have not yet realized that the determinants of entrepreneurship entry might be distinct for
different modes of DEMO For example, many researchers deﬁne entrepreneurs as business owners and analyze DEMO determinants of
choice or success for this combination of self-starters and entrepreneurs who have taken over an existing ﬁrm. However, our study
demonstrates that these entry modes are distinct. In particular, we ﬁnd that individuals who come from business owning families
and thus have the option of taking DEMO a family ﬁrm will make different investments in human capital than their counterparts
from non-business owning families. Taking over and running a family ﬁrm DEMO different kinds of skills and knowledge than

starting up and running a new venture. The required DEMO and knowledge for family ﬁ rm takeover are more likely to be associated
with informal human capital conveyed through familiarity with a (parent's) business whereas the skills and knowledge required
for new venture start-up are more likely to be obtained through formal education. Thus, we propose that individuals from business
owning families with an option to take over a DEMO ﬁrm invest less in formal human capital obtained through education than
individuals from non-business owning families for whom this family ﬁrm takeover mode of DEMO is unavailable. This, our ﬁrst
proposition, is supported by the data.
We further argue that formal human capital will be especially useful for DEMO brand new ﬁrms relative to taking over ﬁrms
(inside or outside DEMO family). Formal education improves a person's ability to search and process large amounts of information
leading to a greater ability to identify DEMO business opportunities. This ability is more valuable for starting up a ﬁrm than for a
takeover, given the abundance of possibilities in new venture start-up compared to the takeover mode. Moreover, formal
education, which is DEMO general usefulness in the labor market, may be more valuable as DEMO hedge for the greater risk borne by
entrepreneurs who start-up a new business than for those who take over an existing ﬁrm. Thus we DEMO that more educated
entrepreneurs are more likely to start-up a new venture than to take over a ﬁ rm from outside of the family. DEMO data show strong
support for this second proposition.
Our third proposition combines the logic of the ﬁrst two with the insight that informal human DEMO obtained in a family ﬁrm
will be more applicable to another existing ﬁrm (obtained through outside takeover) than to a new venture start-up. DEMO
individuals from business owning families who do not take over the family ﬁrm will be more likely than individuals from non-
business owning families DEMO take over an outside ﬁrm than to start-up a new venture. The data support this proposition as well.
Another important dimension of formal human DEMO, managerial experience, is likely to be most productive in existing ﬁrms
where it is especially likely that established personnel have to be managed. DEMO fourth proposition states that greater managerial
experience enhances the probability of becoming an entrepreneur by takeover relative to new venture start-up. This proposition is
DEMO out by the data too. In contrast, other types of experience, such as general labor market experience, industry experience, and
previous business DEMO might be more critical in new venture start-ups than in ﬁ rms acquired through takeover where other
personnel are already engaged and can substitute DEMO any shortfalls in these types of an entrepreneur's generic experience. In line
with this, our ﬁfth proposition states that entrepreneurs with greater labor market experience, industry experience, and previous
business experience are more likely DEMO enter via a new venture start-up than an (outside) takeover, DEMO with otherwise
identical entrepreneurs with less of these types of experience. This proposition is not supported empirically in our study.
A further consideration relevant DEMO our ﬁnal proposition is that established ﬁrms are less risky than brand new ﬁrms. Indeed,
evidence shows that on average brand new ventures DEMO more variable growth and proﬁt rates and lower survival rates than
established ﬁrms do. In addition, problems of asymmetric information are more acute in new ventures compared with established
ﬁrms, owing to the lack of a track record. As a result, access to ﬁnance and hence entry via a new venture start-up relative to
takeover is likely to be more DEMO the greater are capital requirements in a speciﬁc industry. Thus entrepreneurs operating in
industries with higher start-up capital requirements and risks are more likely DEMO enter via an outside ﬁrm takeover than via a new
venture start-up. This sixth proposition is empirically supported.
Thus, we identify several salient determinants of entry modes. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications of DEMO
ﬁndings, and suggestions about possible directions for future research.
2. Introduction
DEMO extensive literature now treats the decision to become an entrepreneur as an occupational choice. Recent research
emphasizes the importance of several variables that may DEMO this decision, including borrowing constraints (Hurst and Lusardi,
2004; DEMO and van Praag, 2006); human capital (Lazear, 2005; Hartog et al., 2010); geographical location (Acs and Armington,
2006); cognitive biases (Puri and Robinson, 2007; Lowe and Ziedonis, 2006; Hayward et al., 2006); and ethnicity (Fairlie, 2004).
DEMO of this literature deﬁ nes entrepreneurship as a transition into independent business ownership, and usually frames
entrepreneurship in terms of new venture creation. Despite this emphasis, starting a new ﬁrm from scratch is not the only way
individuals can become entrepreneurs. They can also take over an existing DEMO, including a family business if they come from a
business owning DEMO One can therefore distinguish the mode of entry from the entry decision itself.
The present article analyzes the individual-level determinants of the mode of DEMO Like many previous scholars, we deﬁne
entrepreneurship as the junction where DEMO individuals and valuable business opportunities meet (Shane, 2003). But the
focus of this article will be less on particular aspects of business DEMO and more on individual characteristics. Hence we
take entrepreneurs to be people who engage in business venturing at their own risk, regardless of whether their mode of entry is
to start a brand new ﬁrm or DEMO take over an existing one. However, although our primary focus is DEMO on aspects of business
ventures such as organizational structure or past trading history, we also try to say something about the industry-speciﬁc nature of
the opportunities embodied in different types of businesses.
There are at least DEMO reasons why policy makers may be concerned with the mode of entry. First, the population is aging,
especially in Europe, thereby increasing DEMO potential for business transfers. According to the European Commission, ‘one third DEMO
EU entrepreneurs, mainly those running family enterprises, will withdraw within the next ten years. According to estimates this
could affect up to 690,DEMO small and medium sized enterprises and 2.8 million jobs every year’ (DEMO of the European
Communities, 2006, p.3). The importance of business takeovers is also underlined by national data. For example, based on the age
distribution of business owners, 20,000 ﬁ rms per year are expected to seek takeover candidates in the next ﬁve years in The
DEMO In comparison, 70,000 ﬁrms are started every year in The DEMO (data source: The Dutch Ministry of Economic

Affairs). At the same time, the proportion of ﬁrms being taken over by family members is decreasing sharply in several DEMO
One reason is that parents are having fewer children, which decreases DEMO probability of ﬁnding suitable takeover candidates
among one's own offspring. Another is that wider access to education has broadened the career options of DEMO people, many
of whom now have more attractive alternatives to continuing DEMO family ﬁrm. Thus research conducted by ING bank reveals that in
the period 1994–1999, 35% of Dutch ﬁrm owners sold their ﬁrm to a family member, whereas the corresponding percentage in
2003 was only 22%. In Canada, four out of ten small business owners are expected to retire within the next ﬁve years, and seven out
of ten will retire within the next decade, according to evidence given by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) to
the Canadian Standing Senate Committee on DEMO, Trade and Commerce in June 2006. The CFIB estimates that almost DEMO of
heads of SMEs anticipate retiring in two years without having identiﬁ ed a successor, with two-thirds failing to start any planning
for their future succession. Likewise, the UK Small Business Service identiﬁed one third of British SME owners as vulnerable to age-
related transfer failure (Commission of the European Communities, 2006).
There are several reasons for the strong belief among policy makers that economic value can be lost when small DEMO
ﬁrms close and seek external successors. First, unlike large ﬁrms, many small family ﬁrms lack tangible assets which can be easily
redeployed to DEMO uses. Instead, much of the value is embodied in the networks DEMO idiosyncratic expertise of the small ﬁrm
owner-manager him or herself. A second, related, point is that unlike large incorporated ﬁrms, where detailed accounting and
operational information is usually available in a highly systemized form, small family ﬁ rms are prone to less rigorous reporting
requirements and tend DEMO be more informationally opaque to outside investors. Outside investors therefore face a classic
asymmetric information problem, which can make them more reluctant to invest in takeovers of small ﬁrms when they close.
Third, it can be costly and time-consuming for entrepreneurs to ﬁ nd suitable successors from outside DEMO family, implying that
aggregate transaction and operation costs are likely to DEMO as the number of family ﬁrms taken over by ‘outsiders’ rises. For all
these reasons, ‘a small business owner will tend to sell at a discount to competitors,… with the associated risk of business
closure’—putting DEMO many as two million jobs at risk in Canada, according to DEMO This is potentially a serious problem because a
substantial amount of economic value is bound up in private (non-publicly traded) ﬁrms. Europe's DEMO million SMEs employ 66% of
the workforce and generate 55% of total turnover (Eurostat, 2000). These ﬁgures illustrate an important, but sometimes
overlooked, consideration in the entrepreneurship debate: the importance of preserving the DEMO value of existing
entrepreneurial ﬁrms as well as creating value via new starts.1 This provides an important motivation for analyzing the choice of
entrepreneurial DEMO between takeovers and brand new starts.
A second reason why the mode of entry is of policy interest relates to the growing trend in DEMO policy towards promoting
entrepreneurship. The European Commission Green Paper on Entrepreneurship (DEMO) is only one of a recent raft of policy
initiatives of DEMO kind. As noted there, ‘The challenge for the European Union is DEMO identify the key factors for building a climate in
which entrepreneurial initiative and business activities can thrive. Policy measures should seek to boost the DEMO's levels of
entrepreneurship, adopting the most appropriate approach for producing DEMO entrepreneurs and for getting more ﬁrms to grow’
(European Commission, 2003, p. 9). Yet it does not necessarily follow that a set of policies designed to promote new starts will also
be suitable for DEMO who are contemplating entry by taking over an existing ﬁrm that seeks a successor. If targeted policies
are to provide the correct incentives, it is necessary to take into account the mode of entry into entrepreneurship DEMO well as the
gross entry ﬂow. However, to our knowledge, the entry mode of entrepreneurs has been little studied to date. In particular, we still
know little about which types of individual match with which DEMO of ﬁrm (i.e., takeover or start-up) as the owner–manager.
This DEMO analyzes the entrepreneurial entry mode decision, in an effort to shed DEMO on the following questions: What are the
determinants of an individual'DEMO decision to start-up a business from scratch, or to take over DEMO an established ﬁrm looking for
a successor? And, in the case of a takeover, when will individuals take over a family business, DEMO when will they acquire a ﬁrm
from a third party, given DEMO a family business is available in the family? We develop a DEMO based on human capital theory
and test the propositions resulting from this framework using a sample of Dutch entrepreneurs. The central argument advanced in
DEMO paper is based on a distinction between formal human capital and informal human capital. Whereas formal human capital is a
set of skills and DEMO conveyed by formal education and work experience, we deﬁ ne informal DEMO capital as comprising
skills and knowledge transmitted from business owning parents to their offspring. Our conceptual discussion generates several
propositions predicting how various dimensions DEMO human capital affect the mode of entry. These propositions guide the empirical
analysis which helps identify the salient determinants of entry mode. We believe DEMO ﬁndings provide valuable evidence on a little
researched issue, and carry DEMO implications for researchers, entrepreneurs and public policy makers.
This article is DEMO to several other strands of the entrepreneurship literature. Holmes and Schmitz (DEMO, 1996) analyze how
attributes of businesses and managers (in particular DEMO age and managerial tenure) affect the decisions of founders and non-
DEMO to continue, close or sell their ventures. Unlike us, Holmes and Schmitz study the strategies of established managers
rather than new entrants. Holmes DEMO Schmitz (1990) explore re-entry by entrepreneurs who close their ventures and choose to
either take over an existing one or create a new DEMO from scratch. We do not analyze the continuation or closure decision in this
paper, focusing only on entry while exploring the effects of different entrepreneurial family backgrounds—an issue which Holmes
and Schmitz do not investigate.
1 DEMO European Commission again: ‘ In general, family businesses with their long-term orientation provide an important element of stability to our economies
and are DEMO source of a wealth of genuine corporate social responsibility-practices... More successful business transfers will have immediate beneﬁcial effects for
Europe's economy. Existing companies DEMO on average ﬁve jobs whereas a start-up generates on average two jobs’ (Commission of the European
Communities, 2006,p.3–4).

This article also relates to research on family businesses. DEMO often analyzes the family ﬁrm succession problem from the point
of view of the founder. For instance, many family business studies ask why less than 30% of family businesses survive past the ﬁrst
generation while only DEMO make it to the third generation (Handler, 1990, 1992; Davis and Harveston, 1998; Lansberg, 1999).
Several reasons for poor matches between founders and successors have been proposed, including ineffective succession plans,
incompetent or unprepared successors, and family rivalries (Handler, 1990, 1992; Morris et al., 1997). Another important success
factor appears to be the transfer of tacit business knowledge from one generation to the next (Cabrera-Suárez et al., 2001; Steier,
2001). There are similarities DEMO with the present paper, which recognizes that entrepreneurs with a family DEMO background
receive transfers of informal human capital which inﬂuence their choices over the mode of entry, including start-ups or external
takeovers rather than joining a family ﬁrm. An important mission of the paper is to analyze DEMO the matching between
founders and successors, a central issue in family DEMO research. In contrast to much theoretical family business research, we
ﬁnd DEMO empirical structure in the mode of entry conditional on family ﬁrm offspring not joining a family ﬁrm than on joining
one.
Other researchers have DEMO founders' strategic choices between appointing family or external CEOs (Burkart et al., 2003;
Bennedsen et al., 2006). This perspective highlights DEMO fact that many family businesses which lack successors do not fail outright,
but instead are simply taken over by entrepreneurs from outside of DEMO family (Lambrecht and Donckels, 2006). Family business
researchers often question the effectiveness of non-family compared with family successors. Outsiders can face greater DEMO
working harmoniously with family members, and may be less likely to DEMO family ﬁnance to overcome borrowing constraints
(Sharma, 2006). The present paper adds to the family business literature by exploring the attributes of DEMO relative to
family successors, and by shedding light on the role DEMO borrowing constraints. Here as well our ﬁndings add to the evidence base in
the family business literature, highlighting the importance of managerial experience in non-family succession and the role of
borrowing constraints. Taken together, these suggest a more benign role for outside takeovers of family ﬁrms, though we should
stress that we do not analyze ﬁrm performance by entry mode.
DEMO contrast to the family literature, we analyze ﬁrm takeover issues not DEMO the perspective of the founder, but instead from
the perspective of DEMO potential successor, who may or may not be a family member, and who has the option of setting up a brand
new venture DEMO well. One of the few previous papers to explore this issue is the descriptive study by Cooper and Dunkelberg
(1986). Those authors analyzed entry via new starts, inheriting a business, and taking over an DEMO business—as well as
promotions within-family ﬁ rms. Using survey responses from 1756 members of the US National Federation of Independent
Business sampled in 1979, Cooper and Dunkelberg described each entry mode in terms of entrepreneurs' background
characteristics, motivations and attitudes and previous careers. However, Cooper and Dunkelberg DEMO not conduct a multivariate
statistical analysis of the determinants of entry mode, which is the focus of enquiry here.2
In fact, choosing between DEMO a new venture, succeeding in a family business, and taking over an external ﬁrm are not the
only modes of entry choices open DEMO entrepreneurs. For instance, entrepreneurs might decide to exploit a new opportunity DEMO
either starting a brand new ﬁrm to develop it, or by DEMO it into ongoing lines of business within an already existing ﬁrm.
Wiklund and Shepherd (2008) analyze various individual-speciﬁc characteristics, notably human capital and social capital, which
bear on this aspect of the entry mode decision. This decision between novice and habitual entrepreneurship is not one which we
DEMO explore in this article (see Ucbasaran et al., 2006, 2009, for more on this topic).
The remainder of the paper is DEMO as follows. Section 3 presents a conceptual discussion of the entry mode decision of
entrepreneurs. Section 4 describes our sample data, and outlines the modes of entrepreneurial entry observed in the sample.
Section 5 presents the DEMO results, and Section 6 concludes with a discussion of implications for DEMO makers, limitations of
this study and suggestions about possible directions for DEMO research.
3. Conceptual discussion
In the following, we focus on two DEMO of entrepreneur and three types of entry mode. The two entrepreneur types are bofs and
n-bofs: bof types are individuals from business owning families, and n-bof types are individuals from non-business owning
families. The three entry modes are family ﬁrm takeovers (FFT), outside ﬁrm takeovers (OFT) and new venture start-ups (NVS).3
The last two modes of entry are available to anyone, but by deﬁnition only bof type entrepreneurs can enter through the ﬁrst mode.
Hence after analyzing the attractiveness of family DEMO takeovers (FFT) for individuals from business owning families (bof types),
we will focus on choices between new venture start-up (NVS) DEMO outside ﬁrm takeover (OFT) for both n-bof types and those bof
types who do not enter via a family ﬁrm takeover (FFT). We will only investigate the entry strategies of individuals who have
chosen DEMO be entrepreneurs; the decision to enter entrepreneurship in the ﬁrst place DEMO not be analyzed here.4 Fig. 1 shows the
available entry modes for each type of entrepreneur and visualizes the drivers of entry through each DEMO that are formulated in
the propositions that are to be discussed next.
2 See also Ucbasaran et al. (2006) who found no signiﬁcant DEMO between the propensities of British novice, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs to
DEMO rather than take over an existing ﬁrm. Another study, by Chaganti DEMO Schneer (1994), explored performance outcomes of ﬁrms as a function DEMO
different modes of entry. This topic is not explored in the present paper.
3 We are aware that this does not exhaust the set DEMO possible entry modes. Franchising and management buyouts are two other possibilities. We lack the data
to explore the determinants of these choices in the DEMO paper.
4 This choice has been extensively treated elsewhere: see e.g., Parker (2009) for a survey. Ignoring the decision to enter entrepreneurship DEMO no difference
to the central results while avoiding the need to identify an occupational sample selection structure in the empirical work. It is also DEMO with our data
sample which relates only to entrepreneurs.

Fig. 1. A framework of available entry modes and DEMO drivers of entry through each mode.
We start by distinguishing between ‘formal’ and ‘informal’ human capital. Following Becker (1964), human capital is deﬁned as
the stock of skills, knowledge, experience and capabilities which are DEMO in a multitude of productive uses. Formal human capital
is transferred by formal institutions, such as schools providing education and ﬁrms providing work experience. Informal human
capital on the other hand is the set of skills DEMO knowledge transferred through informal institutions, such as a parent's business.
DEMO, at least as we have deﬁned it, bof types have access to more sources of informal human capital than n-bof types who do
DEMO have access to informal human capital obtained through being born in a business owning family (Fairlie and Robb, 2007).
A long tradition DEMO research links formal human capital with the decision to participate in entrepreneurship (Van Der Sluis et al.,
2008; Parker, 2009). For example, it has been argued that education can improve entrepreneurial judgment by providing people
with analytical abilities, information about business opportunities, and an DEMO of markets and the entrepreneurial
process (Casson, 1995; Ucbasaran et DEMO, 2009). Formal education is also associated with general search skills, foresight,
imagination, and computational skills, as well as with speciﬁc DEMO and knowledge needed to run businesses in particular sectors.
A considerable body of evidence supports the notion that formal education enhances the business performance DEMO entrepreneurs
(e.g., Parker and van Praag, 2006; Van Der Sluis et al., 2008). Work experience is also believed to promote entrepreneurship, by
enabling individuals to understand business opportunities and how enterprises function in practice. Experience embodies
knowhow needed to exploit opportunities, such as selling, DEMO, leading, planning, decision-making, problem solving,
organizing and communicating (DEMO, 2003, p. 75). Learning also generates information which reduces uncertainty about the
value of exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities (Jovanovic, 1982; Parker, DEMO; Alvarez and Parker, 2009; Ucbasaran et al.,
2009). DEMO, formal human capital is generally associated with successful, value-creating entrepreneurship.
Informal human capital conveyed through familiarity with a parent's business is likely DEMO comprise knowledge about what is
involved in owning and managing a business, and may transfer learning from favorable role models within the family (DEMO and
Dunkelberg, 1986). Informal human capital might also provide access DEMO valuable business networks and resource providers.
Consistent with these arguments, Fairlie DEMO Robb (2007) uncovered a signiﬁ cant positive linkage between business owners'
experience obtained from previously working in a family member's business DEMO their own subsequent success. In contrast, Fairlie
and Robb observed that DEMO having a family member who owned a business had no signiﬁcant effect. These ﬁndings suggest
that experience of working in a parent's venture DEMO the transfer of performance-enhancing informal human capital.
Furthermore, Robinson (2009) DEMO that the probabilities of adult entrepreneurship and subsequent wealth acquisition are
signiﬁcantly higher for individuals who obtained entrepreneurial experience as adolescents, especially among those born into
business owning families.
One might wonder about the relative productivity DEMO formal and informal human capital, in entrepreneurship in general and the
DEMO entry modes in particular. Human capital theory suggests that formal human capital is the most versatile, since it generates
high returns in paid-employment as well as entrepreneurship (Card, 2001; Oreopoulos, 2006; Parker and van Praag, 2006; Van
Praag et al., 2009). In contrast, DEMO is mixed evidence about the value of prior experience of business ownership outside of
business ownership, where its effects can even be negative (DEMO and Schuetze, 2004; Landier, 2004; Hyytinen and Rouvinen,
2008).

The value of informal human capital obtained in family DEMO for wage employment, has, as far as we know, not DEMO put
to a test. However, it is likely to be more DEMO in entrepreneurship where it is more compatible.5 Furthermore, informal human
capital DEMO likely to be most valuable when it is deployed within the same family business that conferred the informal human capital
in the ﬁrst place, since this leverages speciﬁc as well as general elements of the informal DEMO capital. Because people for whom
the probability of becoming an entrepreneur is high are likely to seek human capital which is most useful in DEMO, we
would expect them to acquire relatively cheap-to-obtain informal human capital DEMO is readily accessible in the family business,
if available. People for whom the probability of entrepreneurship is smaller on the other hand would DEMO expected to seek out more
formal types of human capital, despite DEMO expense.
In short, we would therefore expect bof types, who may have an option to enter via FFT, and who are in general more likely to
become entrepreneurs, to invest more in informal human capital and less in formal human capital than n-bof types. For example,
DEMO can spend fewer years in school and college, spending their time DEMO working in the family business. This will be a more
attractive strategy the more easily accessible is informal human capital, the more productive it is in entrepreneurship, and the
costlier is formal human capital acquisition. Thus anticipating the prospect of future market entry in general and the possibility DEMO
entry via FFT in particular, individuals from business owning families, i.e., bof types, are predicted to obtain less formal education
on average DEMO individuals from non-business owning families, i.e., n-bof types. Indeed, some DEMO evidence is consistent with
this prediction, indicating that people without self-employed DEMO obtain more formal human capital than those with self-
employed parents (DEMO and Masclet, 2008). This gives rise to our ﬁrst proposition:DEMO
Proposition 1. Entrepreneursborn into business owningfamilies (bof types) obtain less formaleducationthanthose born into non-business
owning families (n-bof types) because the former specialize DEMO informal human capital.
It seems likely moreover that formal human capital will be especially useful for starting brand new ﬁrms relative to taking over
DEMO (inside or outside of the family). As noted above, formal education improves a person's ability to search and process large
amounts DEMO information. For example, formal education has been shown to be associated DEMO more intense and effective job
search (Boheim and Taylor, 2001). And higher levels of education seem to be associated with a greater DEMO to identify potential
business opportunities (Ucbasaran et al., 2009). The abundance of possibilities in NVS compared with OFT is therefore likely to
DEMO formal human capital more productive in NVS than in OFT. This expected effect is attributable to its greater productivity
when used to search for DEMO venture opportunities.
There are other reasons as well why higher levels of education might favor NVS over OFT. One might be the greater degree DEMO
difﬁ culty in establishing a new start-up in which routines and organizational structures have to be created from scratch. Here
again versatile formal human DEMO can confer an advantage. Another reason might be that formal human capital can serve as a
hedge, making it possible for risk-averse entrepreneurs to undertake projects occupying a higher point on the risk-return trade-off
(Polkovnichenko, DEMO; Cocco et al., 2005; and Gomes and Michaelides, 2005). These risky projects are especially likely to be NVS
type ones (Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1986; and see the evidence below). This predisposes DEMO educated individuals of both types
to try risky NVS, since if DEMO fail they still have other opportunities, reﬂecting the general usefulness of DEMO human capital. For
all these reasons, we have the next proposition:DEMO
Proposition 2. More educated entrepreneurs are more likely to enter via new venture start-up, NVS, than via an outside ﬁrm takeover,
OFT.
DEMO taking over the family ﬁrm, bof types from business owning ﬁrms DEMO economize on the costs of searching for new business
opportunities NVS or suitable takeover targets OFT. And, having less formal education (by Proposition DEMO), bof types have lower
capabilities anyway for identifying new venture opportunities of the OFT and NVS types. Hence we would expect many bof DEMO to
choose FFT should it be available. Of course, not every DEMO type is temperamentally suited to taking over their family ﬁrm—and even
those who are may not be chosen by their parents to do so. DEMO which case, like n-bof types who are born in non-business owning
DEMO, these ‘remaining’ bof types have to choose between the NVS and DEMO entry modes.
The ﬁrst two propositions together imply that these bof types aspiring to entrepreneurship who do not take over their family
ﬁrm so DEMO to choose between NVS and OFT, and who have, ceteris paribus, lower levels of formal human capital than n-bof
types, are relatively DEMO inclined to become entrepreneurs through the entry mode OFT than NVS.
Moreover, a key feature of informal human capital – namely, that it DEMO obtained in, and is directly applicable to, established
ventures – helps predict what choices bof types will make relative to n-bof types. In DEMO, one would expect that informal
human capital will be more transferable DEMO ventures acquired through an outside ﬁrm takeover (which are already established)DEMO
than to new venture start-ups (which are not). The next DEMO then follows immediately:
Proposition 3. Individuals from business owning families (DEMO types) are more likely than individuals from non-business owning
families (n-bof types) to enter via an outside ﬁrm takeover (OFT) than a new venture start-up (NVS), even after controlling for the
entrepreneur's education level.
5 Informal human capital also has no signalling value in DEMO labor market of paid employees because experience obtained in a family business is difﬁcult to
communicate credibly as is required for valuable signals in DEMO markets without complete information (Spence, 1973; Riley, 2002).

Another important dimension of formal human capital, stressed by Cooper and Dunkelberg (1986), is managerial experience.
As those authors point out, greater experience managing others is likely to be most productive in ﬁrms which use and reward such
experience. Because ventures that are obtained DEMO takeover typically employ others whereas ventures started up from
scratch do not, at least in the beginning, managerial experience is therefore more likely DEMO be most productive in the OFT than the
NVS type of entry. In contrast, other types of experience, such as general labor market DEMO, industry experience, and
previous business experience might be more critical in new ventures than in existing ones where other personnel are already
engaged DEMO can substitute for any shortfalls in these types of an entrepreneur's generic experience. In other words, and in line
with outcomes from a recent area of research initiated by Lazear (2005), entrepreneurs who start-up new ventures need to be
Jacks of all Trades (Astebro and Thompson, 2007; Douhan, 2009; Hartog et al., 2010; Silva, 2007; Wagner, 2003). As we have
explained, this requirement will be less stringent for business takeovers. Hence individuals with abundant amounts of generic
DEMO can exploit valuable new opportunities in NVS which other less experienced people will be unable to. We summarize
these arguments in the next two DEMO:
Proposition 4. All else equal, entrepreneurs with greater managerial experience DEMO more likely to enter via an outside ﬁrm takeover
(OFT) than a new venture start-up (NVS), compared with otherwise identical entrepreneurs with less managerial experience.
Proposition 5. All else equal, entrepreneurs with greater labor market experience, industry experience, and previous business experience
are more likely DEMO enter via a new venture start-up (NVS) than an outside ﬁrm takeover (OFT), compared with otherwise identical
entrepreneurs with less of these types of experience.
A further consideration is that established ﬁrms are less DEMO than brand new ﬁrms (Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1986). Indeed,
recent evidence shows that on average brand new ventures have more variable DEMO and proﬁt rates and lower survival rates
than established ﬁrms do (DEMO and Bernhardt, 2003; van Praag, 2003; Parker, 2009; and see below for evidence based on our
data sample). Problems of DEMO information are more acute in new venture start-ups compared with established ﬁrms
acquired through OFT or FFT, owing to the lack of a track record. As a result, access to ﬁnance and hence entry through NVS is more
difﬁ cult the greater are capital requirements in new ventures (Parker and van Praag, 2006). This gives rise to our ﬁnal proposition:
Proposition 6. Entrepreneurs facing higher start-up capital requirements and risk DEMO more likely to enter via an outside ﬁrm takeover
(OFT) than a new venture start-up (NVS).
Fig. 1 provides an overview of all propositions within the framework of the conceptual model of entry mode DEMO for bof and
n-bof type entrepreneurs.
4. Data
The dataset used to test the hypotheses derived above is a random cross-section sample of Dutch DEMO Entrepreneurs
are deﬁned as individuals who started their own business from scratch or who took over an existing ﬁrm.6 The dataset contains a
range DEMO economic and demographic variables including ones related to family background, entry DEMO, and human and ﬁnancial
capital. The same dataset is used in DEMO and van Praag (2006).
In fall 1994, a questionnaire was sent to 1069 entrepreneurs who had already indicated their willingness to participate DEMO the
research. Of these, 709 responded. Owing to non-response rates on DEMO questions, most of the regression analyses below are
based on between DEMO and 640 observations.7
As documented in Brouwer et al. (1996), DEMO sample is broadly representative of the Dutch population of entrepreneurs in
terms of industry, company size, legal form, and age of companies and entrepreneurs. The sample contains a slightly higher
proportion of highly educated respondents DEMO is found in the general Dutch population, reﬂecting the fact that DEMO of the
commissioners of the research project (the General Advisory Council DEMO the Dutch Government) was particularly interested in the
business outcomes of DEMO group.
The remainder of this section outlines the variables used in the empirical analysis. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics
including entrepreneurs active in the DEMO sector.8
6 The sample was generated as part of a private– public joint venture undertaken by the University of Amsterdam, The Erasmus University of Rotterdam, and
the GfK market research company. The research for which the sample was gathered was commissioned by RABO, a large Dutch co-operative bank, and the
General Advisory Council of the Dutch Government.
7 When ﬁnancial capital variables are included this number is reduced to 566. This is DEMO attributable to non-response for these items, and partly to the fact
DEMO we dropped observations whose (absolute) values exceeded the mean by more than ten times the standard deviation—in order to limit the inﬂuence of
DEMO on the estimates.
8 Because agriculture is usually seen as a distinct sector in terms of its (individual) drivers of entry and performance, entrepreneurship researchers often
exclude it from empirical analyses. One of the distinct DEMO of agriculture is the higher likelihood of within-family takeovers of farm businesses (see Table 1).
In fact, the descriptive statistics obtained when DEMO observations are omitted are qualitatively similar to the descriptive statistics shown in Table 1, and
are suppressed for brevity.

4.1. Variables
4.1.1. Entry mode
In terms of the survey questionnaire, we coded entrepreneurs' entry strategies based on responses DEMO the following question:
“Did you start-up the ﬁrm yourself or did you take over the ﬁrm?” There were three possible categorized answers: (i) “I have taken
over a family ﬁrm”, FFT; (ii) “I have taken over a ﬁrm from a non-family member”, OFT; and (iii) “I have started the ﬁrm myself
from scratch”, NVS. Of the 705 entrepreneurs who answered this question, 9.5% took over a family ﬁrm, 7.4% took over another
ﬁrm and 83.1% started a ﬁrm from scratch. Hence in total 16.9% of the ﬁrms were started through DEMO takeover of some kind.9
4.1.2. Entrepreneurial family background
We can take as the set of bof types all individuals who had at least one DEMO mainly engaged in entrepreneurship during the
respondent's youth. All other individuals were coded as n-bof types.10 On this basis, Table 1 shows that 46% of the entrepreneurs in
our sample come from entrepreneurial families. This DEMO with a ﬁgure of 51% identiﬁed in the US Characteristics of Business
9 These ﬁgures compare with 15% in FFT, 28% in OFT and 49% in NVS in Cooper and Dunkelberg's (1986) US sample, and with 18% in FFT, 16% in OFT and 66% in
NVS in Chaganti and Schneer's (1994) US sample.
10 The precise DEMO in the survey was: “Which professional status applied to your parents (or those who fulﬁlled this role for you) during the longest period
in your youth?” Eight possible categories were given, including ones for self-employed (non-incorporated) and fully incorporated businesses—both of which are
taken to DEMO entrepreneurs. This might seem to risk deﬁning erroneously as n-bof types instead of bof type respondents whose parents did not own a business
while DEMO member of the extended family (e.g., an uncle) did. In DEMO case our empirical deﬁnition of bof types would be too narrow. In fact, the dataset contained
no respondents claiming to have taken over a family ﬁrm neither of whose parents was classiﬁed an entrepreneur.

Owners (CBO) Survey by Fairlie and Robb (2007); and with Lentz and Laband's (1990) ﬁgure of 52% DEMO on US National
Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) data. Also, DEMO our sample 9.5% of businesses are inherited or taken over from the
family. Lentz and Laband (1990) reported that 14.2% of the businesses DEMO their NFIB sample were inherited or acquired from family
members, while DEMO and Robb (2007) reported a lower ﬁgure of at most 8.2% (=1.6% inherited plus an upper bound of 6.6%
gifted or transferred) DEMO the CBO database. It is also noteworthy that bof types are signiﬁcantly less likely to start a new ﬁrm from
scratch (70%) than DEMO types are (93%). Although bof types are slightly more likely DEMO take over a non-family ﬁrm (9%) than n-bof
types are (DEMO), this difference is not statistically signiﬁcant in a simple univariate comparison. However, when comparing bof types
who do not take over a family ﬁrm (referred to hereafter as ‘remaining bof types’) with n-bof types, the difference (11% compared
with 6%) is statistically signiﬁcant (see the right-hand side of the table).
4.1.3. Human capital variables
Education is DEMO in terms of the number of years of schooling rather than the highest schooling level attained. On
average, the entrepreneurs in the sample have 14.68 years of formal education (Table 1). In accordance with Proposition 1, bof
types have signiﬁcantly less education on average than n-bof types do (14.08 versus 15.18 years). Table 1 also shows that bof types
who take over their family ﬁrms have signiﬁcantly less formal education DEMO ‘remaining bof types’—who have in turn have
signiﬁcantly less formal education than n-bof types. Also, a higher proportion of bof types (17%) had business experience prior to
operating the current venture than n-bof types (12%); this difference is also statistically signiﬁcant (although when comparing
‘remaining bof types’ with n-bof types the difference is only marginally signiﬁ cant). DEMO characteristics, including years of
previous experience in the labor market, industry, or management; and age when they began operating the current venture, are
similar for the two entrepreneurial groups. These are only univariate comparisons, however: multivariate analysis will be
performed in the next section.
4.1.4. Other variables
Proposition 6 states that entrepreneurs facing higher start-up capital requirements and DEMO are more likely to take over an
existing ﬁrm than to start-up a new one. When it comes to comparing both average start-up capital DEMO and risk
between ﬁrm types, as is required to test Proposition DEMO, individual-level data face an important limitation. Start-up capital
requirements and risk DEMO only be measured at the individual level for entrepreneurs who started up a business from scratch.
However, we need to measure these variables for all entrepreneurs in the sample. For this reason we deﬁne both variables DEMO the
industry level; nine industries are distinguished for this purpose. Capital DEMO requirements at the industry level are measured as
the mean value of the capital that entrepreneurs who start-up from scratch initially invested in their DEMO operating in the
industry. This value is then attributed to all entrepreneurs in the sample who operate in the industry, i.e., including those DEMO take
over existing businesses. Likewise, the business risk of a new DEMO is deﬁned as the within-industry standard deviation of
proﬁts (incomes) that are generated in the industry, based on new start-ups only. Again, DEMO value is attributed to all
entrepreneurs in the sample who operate in the same industry, whether through takeover or through a new start-up.11
Other variables used in the empirical work include gender, the number of siblings and the number of years of schooling of the
entrepreneur's father. DEMO of the entrepreneurs in the sample are female. This percentage is broadly consistent with other
European studies (Parker, 2009, Chap. 6) and DEMO similar for bof types and n-bof types. Previous researchers have found the number
of siblings and father's education to be strongly correlated with DEMO of entrepreneurs' schooling levels (see Parker and
van Praag, 2006)DEMO Moreover, the number of siblings as well as the rank of DEMO respondent in the group of siblings is likely to affect
the probability that a bof type has a family ﬁrm available: the more (DEMO) siblings a respondent has, the lower the respondent's
likelihood of taking over the family business, all else equal. The modal number of siblings in the sample is 3. bof types have
signiﬁcantly more siblings DEMO n-bof types. As the right-hand-side columns of Table 1 reveal, bof DEMO who take over a family ﬁrm
have more siblings on average than those who do not; but this difference is not statistically signiﬁcant. The average age rank of the
entrepreneurs within the group of sibling is DEMO; it is marginally signiﬁcantly higher for bof types than for n-bof DEMO, partly
because the rank is 0 if an individual has no DEMO; and more n-bof types lack siblings than bof types do. The DEMO number of
years of schooling of the entrepreneur's father is 11.41; it is signiﬁcantly less for bof types than for n-bof types.
To control for time trends, we also include the year of entry into our analyses. The year in which the venture was started or
taken DEMO is signiﬁcantly earlier for bof types than for n-bof types.
5. Empirical results
The results are presented in two stages. The ﬁrst deals with DEMO effects of family background on choices of formal education and
entry through taking over a family ﬁrm, FFT. The second identiﬁes the factors which predispose entrepreneurs to choose between
11 For brevity, the values of these variables for each industry are not shown in Table 1. Note that DEMO empirical speciﬁcations below will not control for
industries at the individual level, since an individual's choice for a speciﬁc industry is an integral part of the decision to take over or start up a ﬁrm. DEMO
dummies could therefore be endogenous variables in the entry mode equation. We will make only two exceptions to this rule, both pertaining to the agricultural
sector. First, in the choice equation speciﬁed for bof types as to whether the family ﬁrm is taken over or not (Table 3 below) we will include a dummy for the
agricultural sector. Second, DEMO a robustness check, we will estimate all choice equations with and DEMO agricultural sector observations. These exceptions are
motivated by the fact that agriculture is an unusual sector where the dynamics of (family) takeover may DEMO different from those in other industries. The lower
part of Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the industry variables. Agriculture is (indeed) DEMO signiﬁcantly more important sector of activity among bof
types than among n-bof types. The same holds for the retail (food) sector and the DEMO is true for the professional services sector.

the NVS and OFT modes of entry. The following subsections present evidence for each of these questions in turn. We close DEMO
some robustness checks.
5.1. The effects of family background on schooling and FFT entry
Proposition 1 asserted that bof types optimally choose lower levels DEMO formal education than n-bof types. The logic was that bof
types can substitute informal for formal human capital. Table 1 has already shown that DEMO types have signiﬁcantly fewer years of
schooling than n-bof types, 14.08 DEMO compared with 15.18 years. However, these are simple averages, which might be explained
by different characteristics of the bof and n-bof sub-samples. Previous DEMO have identiﬁed several variables that affect
schooling choices, including age (negatively: capturing cohort effects), female gender (negatively: possibly reﬂecting different
historic expectations about labor force participation rates), parental education (positively: reﬂecting DEMO nature and nurture),
and the number and rank of siblings (negatively: suggesting a trade-off between the quality and quantity of children, DEMO greater
investment by parents in older children).12 For example, according DEMO Table 1, bof types are signiﬁcantly older than n-bof types, as
they have an earlier entry year and a similar age at entry DEMO with n-bof types. Also, the fathers of bof types have lower DEMO
of education, and bof types have more siblings, on average, DEMO n-bof types do. These differences alone might explain the
difference in mean number of years of schooling between the entrepreneur types. Offsetting this, bof types rank higher in the
sibling rank than n-bof types do on DEMO, which might partly compensate for the differences just described. We run DEMO
regressions to control for all of these variables together. We continue to include entrepreneurs in all industry sectors (including
agriculture) to avoid possible DEMO selection biases entailed by studying the schooling decisions of only those who subsequently
chose to enter particular sectors.
Table 2 reports the empirical results. DEMO dependent variable is the number of years of education.13 The results are shown for
bof and n-bof types together and separately, to highlight the potentially different mechanisms underlying the education
investment decision of the different entrepreneurial DEMO For all three cases, two sets of results are presented. The DEMO set
excludes the variables that differ largely across bof types and n-bof types (i.e. father's education, the number of siblings and the
DEMO's rank in the row of siblings), whereas the second set includes these variables.
The ﬁrst entries in Table 2 show that bof DEMO do indeed have signiﬁcantly lower levels of formal education than n-bof types.
This difference is large compared with other effects even after controlling for DEMO covariates of schooling. Age, father's education,
and the number DEMO rank of siblings all signiﬁcantly affect entrepreneurs' years of education, and carry the expected signs. That is,
younger people with highly educated DEMO and fewer siblings have signiﬁcantly more years of schooling. Together these
variables account for a large part of the cross-sectional variation in the number DEMO years of schooling, as demonstrated by the R2
value of 33%.
DEMO other columns of Table 2 reveal that the education choices of bof and n-bof type entrepreneurs are structured in
somewhat different ways. In particular, female entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs with older siblings obtain signiﬁcantly and
substantially less DEMO education on average if they come from business owning families compared with non-business owning
families. It might therefore seem that later-born and female offspring DEMO more likely than others to anticipate the prospect of
family business succession. This conjecture however does not receive support from a probit analysis, among bof type entrepreneurs
only, asking whether these entrepreneurs took over a family ﬁrm (dependent variable = 1 if so), or became an entrepreneur via a
non-family takeover or a new start (dependent variable = 0 for either).
The results are presented in Table 3. They reveal DEMO the only signiﬁcant determinants of bof types taking over a family ﬁrm
are: the number of siblings, with a negative effect which possibly DEMO greater competition among offspring to be the successor;
the year the entrepreneur entered (with a negative sign, indicating a decline in the DEMO of offspring taking over family
businesses); and whether the entrepreneur operates an agricultural business (with a positive sign). We performed this analysis for
12 See, e.g., Black et al. (2005) and Parker DEMO van Praag (2006).
13 A log-transformation of this variable generated DEMO results.

in the preceding section. The results remained DEMO unchanged when agriculture is excluded.14
The next section asks what happens to bof and n-bof types who both choose between a non-family takeover or DEMO new venture
start. We will also address here the issue of possible sample selectivity of the ‘remaining bof types’, i.e. the bof types who did not
take over a family ﬁrm.
5.2. Determinants of the mode DEMO entry: NVS versus OFT
The bof type entrepreneurs who have not DEMO over a family business (‘remaining bof types’ ) as well as DEMO n-bof type
entrepreneurs choose between external takeover (OFT) and new start-up (NVS). As noted in Section 3, one advantage of taking
DEMO an existing ﬁrm rather than starting a new one is that it is less risky. We ﬁrst verify this assertion. Deﬁning payoffs as the
DEMO entrepreneurs earned from their businesses in 1994 (where income is measured DEMO, including wages paid
to entrepreneurs as well as returns to capital DEMO unincorporated entrepreneurs), and measuring risk as the coefﬁcient of variation
of payoffs,15 Table 4 displays the mean and median incomes, as well as their standard deviations and coefﬁcient of variation for the
entire sample, and for start-ups and takeovers separately. The coefﬁcient of variation of payoffs DEMO NVS ventures clearly
exceeds that among OFT ventures. Very similar results are observed if family takeovers are excluded from the ﬁnal column of the
DEMO
To test the hypothesis that risk affects the mode of entry, DEMO estimated a probit model in which the dependent variable equals
one if a new start-up is chosen, and takes the value zero if a takeover is chosen. Note that a multinomial probit or logit model
deﬁned DEMO the three entry modes NVS, OFT and FFT is not appropriate DEMO, as it cannot be used to investigate the effects of
family DEMO (Proposition 3) since n-bof types cannot by deﬁnition enter FFT. However, we will need to check for sample
selection bias owing to the ‘remaining bof types’ possibly being different in their choices between NVS and DEMO compared with the
complete set of bof types. Our empirical strategy is executed in two steps. First, we will estimate the probit model without
controlling for possible sample selectivity. Second, we will test for sample selectivity to see if it is important.
14 Excluding other industry sectors generates DEMO results too.
15 Unlike other measures of risk, such as the DEMO deviation, the coefﬁcient of variation is independent of the mean value DEMO the variable whose risk is
measured. This is relevant because of the different mean net payoffs shown below in Table 4.

DEMO the ﬁrst stage of the empirical analysis, Table 5 presents a DEMO of results in order to check robustness with respect to
the inclusion of additional variables. Results are again reported for all industries; industry dummies are excluded for the reasons
given earlier. All results remain qualitatively similar DEMO omitting observations from the agricultural sector. Column I estimates a
basic speciﬁcation containing variables representing entrepreneur type and education achievement. There are two key DEMO
First, highly educated entrepreneurs are more likely to start-up a new DEMO instead of entering entrepreneurship through takeover.
This supports Proposition 2, and DEMO that education is especially productive in new venture starts by reducing search costs
and enhancing success in managing high risk projects. Second, bof type entrepreneurs turn out to be signiﬁcantly more likely to
choose OFT relative DEMO NVS, compared with n-bof type entrepreneurs. This supports Proposition 3. The DEMO columns of Table 5
indicate that these results are broadly robust to the inclusion of other relevant covariates, although the size of the education effect
is slightly attenuated as more explanatory variables are added and the DEMO size drops (owing to incomplete responses for some
of the added DEMO).
To test the robustness of these results to the inclusion of control variables, column II adds the control variables ‘entry year’,
‘female’ and ‘age at entry’ . Family background and formal education remain statistically DEMO; the ‘entry year’ variable is
insigniﬁcant and so is gender. Column DEMO also shows that younger entrepreneurs are more inclined to start-up a business than to
take one over. The effect is quite small and turns DEMO not to be robust to the inclusion of additional covariates (see DEMO other
columns of the table). We therefore conclude that there is no robust effect of gender or age on entrepreneurial entry mode.
Column DEMO adds to the speciﬁcation other dimensions of formal human capital, in DEMO form of various kinds of experience. This
enables Propositions 4 and 5 to be tested. The only variable in this category that is marginally DEMO in all equations is years of
previous experience of managing people, DEMO is associated with a higher probability of becoming an entrepreneur through
takeover instead of start-up. This is consistent with Proposition 4, although the size and signiﬁcance of this effect are modest. In
contrast, there is no signiﬁ cant effect of other types of experience on the mode of DEMO Hence (consistent with Ucbasaran et al.,
2006) Proposition 5 is not supported.
Column IV includes controls for (industry-speciﬁc) entry capital requirements DEMO risk. These are added in order to test
Proposition 6 , which stated that greater risk and start-up capital requirements decrease the probability entrepreneurs DEMO start a
new ﬁrm rather than take over an existing one. The results show that takeover becomes relatively more attractive when industry
entry is DEMO risky and/or more expensive. These ﬁndings are consistent with Proposition 6, though the entry risk variable is only
marginally signiﬁcant.
Table 6 presents the results of estimating a bivariate Heckman probit model allowing for sample DEMO among ‘remaining
bof types’. Because the option of taking over a family ﬁrm is not available for n-bof types, this analysis pertains solely to bof types.
The Heckman probit model with sample selection is identiﬁ ed DEMO imposing exclusion restrictions, i.e., including variables in the
ﬁrst stage selection equation (i.e., choice of ‘not FFT’ rather than FFT) that are excluded from the second-stage selection equation
(i.e., choice of NVS rather DEMO OFT conditional on ‘not FFT’). The variables that are selected to play this role are background
variables such as the number of siblings; the respondent's rank in the parental family; the father's education level; the entry year
of the respondent; and a dummy variable DEMO whether the ﬁrm is in the agricultural sector. This set of variables has
sufﬁcient identifying power, as noted in Table 6.16 In addition to this set of identifying variables, each ﬁrst stage equation also
includes all the variables included in the second-stage equation.
16 Importantly, these ﬁve identifying variables have jointly no signiﬁcant explanatory power in the second selection equation. DEMO was veriﬁed by a Chi-
squared test performed on the equation estimated in Table 5. The p-value was 0.58, indicating that they qualify as identifying instruments.

If sample selection exists, the error terms in the two equations estimated in Table 6 will be correlated, with a correlation
coefﬁcient ‘rho’ being signiﬁcantly different from zero. In fact, the lower part of Table 6 shows that the Likelihood Ratio test
statistic cannot reject the independence of the two equations' error terms. This provides some assurance that the results in Table 5
are DEMO vitiated by selection bias. Further reassurance is obtained by observing that the sign and signiﬁcance of the effects in the
second and the ﬁrst DEMO are qualitatively the same as in Tables 5 and 3, respectively.17
DEMO Robustness checks
One robustness check dropped all observations relating to agriculture from the speciﬁcations estimated in Tables 5 and 6. The
results remained qualitatively DEMO, with two exceptions. One is that the effect of bof type DEMO entry mode choice became
more signiﬁcant in the ﬁrst two columns of Table 5 when agricultural entrepreneurs were dropped; the other is that the effects
from years of education became marginally less signiﬁcant (though they remained signiﬁcant).
We also checked whether there is a potential problem of DEMO bias. Our cross-section of data includes only
entrepreneurs who are still in business. The danger is that NVS entrepreneurs are more prone to failure DEMO OFT and FFT
entrepreneurs. Hence we might over-sample abler (better educated) entrepreneurs who are disproportionately found in the NVS
mode. This could impart DEMO upward bias to the estimates on the role of education in Table 5. Put another way, interacting education
with the duration of time spent in the current business should enter with a positive coefﬁcient if survival DEMO is a salient issue.
Consequently we re-ran each probit in Table 5, including this interaction term together with years of education and duration
entered separately. In all cases the interaction term was insigniﬁcant.
Another consideration is DEMO some self-employed parents run businesses which cannot be passed on or sold—for example,
window cleaners, lawyers and doctors. Despite their children being unable to inherit a business in the conventional sense, they are
nevertheless classiﬁed as bof types. We could not control for parental occupation in sufﬁcient DEMO to test the robustness of our
17 The coefﬁcient sizes are not directly comparable across these models because Tables 3 and 5 show marginal DEMO whereas the coefﬁcient values are
tabulated in Table 6 (owing to DEMO absence of the option of calculating marginal effects in a Heckman selection probit model in Stata).

results to the omission of these cases; but we doubt this consideration affects the results in a material way. If anything, it is likely to
increase the degree of imprecision of our results, making the signiﬁ cant relationships which are uncovered even more striking.
Finally, we tested whether the mode of entry might be affected by the DEMO of capital constraints. For example, if
entrepreneurs are obliged to select DEMO inexpensive mode of entry because capital required in their preferred entry mode is not
forthcoming, biased results might ensue. To test this possibility, DEMO constructed two measures of initial constraints. First, following
Parker and van DEMO (2006), the extent of borrowing constraints is measured directly as DEMO : = 100 × (1−r)≥ 0, where r is the
ratio of initial capital invested and initial capital required (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics). Also, a dummy variable for having
experienced capital constraints is deﬁned as equal to one if BCN 0 and equal DEMO zero if BC = 0. This second constraint measure
reﬂects whether entrepreneurs face any constraint or not. It turns out that less than 33% DEMO the entrepreneurs experienced any
capital constraint at the time of entry, DEMO only 12% claimed to be constrained by 60% or more of their required capital. Across the
sample, the average extent of capital constraints BC is only 17.8%. This suggests that capital constraints are not an issue DEMO the
majority of respondents. Furthermore, Table 1 reveals no signiﬁcant difference DEMO BC by family background. The extent of capital
constraints is higher, DEMO, among bof types who take over their family ﬁrm than among DEMO bof types’. To err on the side
of caution, we re-ran DEMO of the speciﬁcations reported above for all respondents apart from those claiming to be constrained by 60%
or more of their required capital. The DEMO, which are available from the authors on request, remained qualitatively unchanged.
Also, we re-ran the speciﬁcations in Table 5 using the variable measuring the extent of borrowing constraints. Its coefﬁcient was
insigniﬁcant in all equations, indicating that borrowing constraints are not related to the mode of entry.18
DEMO Conclusion
This paper has explored the determinants of entrepreneurs' mode of DEMO using a Dutch cross-section dataset from the mid-
1990s. Overall, our DEMO tests support most of the propositions advanced in this article. Individuals who come from business
owning families and have the option of taking over DEMO family ﬁrm will make different investments in human capital than their
counterparts from non-business owning families. They invest less in formal human capital (education) and possess more informal
human capital obtained through their parents' businesses. DEMO ﬁrst proposition that entrepreneurs from business owning families
have lower levels of education than other entrepreneurs was supported by the data.
The second proposition DEMO based on the idea that formal human capital will be especially useful for starting brand new ﬁrms
relative to taking over ﬁrms (inside or outside of the family). Indeed, we found evidence of a positive relationship between
an entrepreneur's level of education and the likelihood that DEMO entry mode is a new venture start rather than an (outside)DEMO
takeover—consistent with our second proposition.
The third proposition combined the ﬁrst two propositions with the insight that informal human capital obtained in a family
DEMO will be more applicable to existing ﬁrms in general than to a new venture start-up. Thus individuals from business owning
families who do not DEMO over the family ﬁrm will be more likely than individuals from non-business owning families to take over
an outside ﬁrm than to start-up a DEMO venture. The data supported this proposition as well.
The fourth proposition relates to another important dimension of formal human capital, managerial experience, which DEMO likely
to be most productive in existing ﬁ rms where personnel have to be managed with a greater likelihood than in start-ups. Consistent
with DEMO proposition, greater managerial experience was found to enhance the probability of DEMO an entrepreneur by
takeover relative to new venture start-up.
The ﬁfth proposition was, in contrast, not supported empirically. Other types of experience, such as general labor market
experience, industry experience, and previous business experience DEMO expected though not found to be more critical in new
venture start-ups than in takeovers where other personnel are already engaged and can substitute DEMO any shortfalls in an
entrepreneur's generic experience.
Our ﬁnal proposition stated that entrepreneurs operating in industries with higher start-up capital requirements and risk DEMO
more likely to enter via an outside ﬁrm takeover than via a brand new start-up. This proposition was based on the idea that
established DEMO are less risky than brand new ﬁrms and have better access to ﬁnance. This proposition was supported by the data.
What are the implications DEMO our results for practitioners, policy makers and researchers in entrepreneurship and DEMO
business? To the extent that one can generalize from one set DEMO results, we would argue that practitioners and policy makers
should start DEMO recognize that entrepreneurs can and do choose between multiple modes of entry, and should incorporate this
insight in the design of public policy programs. For example, entrepreneurship education programs often focus on new start-ups,
neglecting the entry route of takeovers. As we have seen, takeovers seem to attract individuals with different skill sets to new
starts, combining less formal education with more managerial experience. In view of the current scarcity of DEMO candidates in
Europe and parts of North America it may be advisable to extend these programs to educate aspiring entrepreneurs about
takeovers as well.
DEMO believe that this paper makes several important contributions to the conceptual literature on entrepreneurial entry. First,
an analysis of different entry modes paints DEMO more precise picture of the entry process. It also avoids an aggregation problem
caused by combining different entry processes. For instance, inappropriate combination of different entry modes could lead
researchers to detect lower estimated effects of DEMO on new venture creation if takeovers are included in the sample of
venture starts. It might also overstate the limiting effects of ﬁnancial (and other) constraints on entrepreneurship, since
18 It was not included in DEMO basic speciﬁcations reported in Table 5 because it is potentially endogenous. That is, the extent of borrowing constraints partly
results from investment and savings decisions that may be related, directly or indirectly, to the selected DEMO of entry.

information-based barriers might restrict entry via new venture creation DEMO not via takeover, where company information is
more readily available. This DEMO to substitute entry into a different mode can be overlooked by traditional research
methods which focus purely on new venture creation, causing them to over-emphasize constraints. More generally, greater
consistency about the treatment of different entry modes might enable researchers to clarify research ﬁndings across studies and
reduce DEMO incidence of inconsistent or contradictory results.
Second, we believe our analysis DEMO implications for research undertaken in the area of family business. As noted at the outset,
family business research has highlighted the role of DEMO of tacit business knowledge from one generation to the next (Cabrera-
DEMO et al., 2001; Steier, 2001). We have analyzed this DEMO in a generalized context where parental transfers of informal human
capital can substitute for formal human capital and be productive in takeovers of non-family DEMO as well as succession within-
family ﬁ rms. We believe that analyzing business succession from the perspective of the successor entrepreneur – the focus DEMO this
article – rather than from the perspective of the founder (DEMO focus of much of the family business literature) highlights a valuable
DEMO direction for family business researchers. It is noteworthy too that many family businesses which lack successors do not fail
outright, but instead are simply taken over by entrepreneurs who come from outside of the family. That DEMO the case, it becomes
desirable to know more about who those DEMO takeover candidates are. We have made a start on ﬁlling the gaps in this part of
our knowledge base as well.
A third contribution DEMO our study to theories of entry relates to the components of human capital. By emphasizing how different
types of human capital (here, formal DEMO informal) might be substitutable with each other, our study adds to the growing
conceptual and empirical discussion about how heterogeneous human capital promotes DEMO entry (see, e.g. Lazear,
2005). We think that the distinction between formal and informal human capital is especially important, because it connects with
a crucial dimension of entry which is still imperfectly understood, namely the intergenerational transmission of (non-family)
business ownership propensities (Fairlie DEMO Robb, 2007).
Clearly, more research is needed to broaden the ﬁndings and extend the analysis in several novel and important directions. The
DEMO obvious empirical question is whether our results also hold in countries other than The Netherlands, and whether there are
important differences between and within EU states vis-à-vis the US. At a conceptual level, the analysis could be usefully extended as
well. As noted at the start of the DEMO, entrepreneurship can be regarded as the conjunction of individual enterprise and DEMO
business opportunities. We focused on the former rather than the latter, DEMO the nature of our dataset. But a more complete
analysis of the mode of entry would also utilize data on the different types of DEMO opportunity associated with each mode of entry.
For example, potential entrepreneurs DEMO sometimes look at the past history of a venture's earnings when evaluating whether to take
over a venture; but they cannot do that when they are deciding whether to start a new venture from scratch. DEMO are doubtless other
aspects of the business opportunity (e.g. existence of DEMO) which are more abundant in the takeover compared with the new
DEMO creation mode, and which also inﬂuence individual decisions. These topics are DEMO worthy of further research.
Finally, the horizons of the present enquiry DEMO be broadened by analyzing the family ﬁrm succession issue in greater detail.
That might recognize the potential for conﬂicts within families at the same DEMO as taking account of entrepreneur–ﬁnancier
frictions. More generally, we believe that DEMO are substantial potential gains to be made by building on the approach of this
paper, and analyzing succession from the viewpoint of successors, DEMO than just that of existing founders—which is where most
research has focused to date.
