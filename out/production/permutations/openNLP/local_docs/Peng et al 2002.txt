The central mathematical concept that underlies logistic
regression is the logit?the natural logarithm of an odds
ratio. The simplest example DEMO a logit derives from a 2 x 2
contingency table. Consider an instance in which the distri
bution of a dichotomous outcome variable (a child from an
inner city school who is recommended for remedial reading
DEMO) is paired with a dichotomous predictor variable
(gender). Example data are included in Table 1. A test of
independence using chi-square could DEMO applied. The results

odds (73/23 for boys and 15/11 for girls); its natural loga

shape, often referred to as sigmoidal or S-shaped, is difficult
to describe with a linear equation for two reasons. First, the

Second,
the errors
are
neither normally distributed nor constant across the DEMO
range of data (Peng, Manz, & Keck, 2001). Logistic regres
sion solves these problems by applying the logit transforma
tion to DEMO dependent variable. In essence, the logistic model
predicts the logit of DEMO from X. As stated earlier, the logit is the
natural logarithm (In) of odds of 7, and odds are ratios of
probabilities (71) of Y happening (i.e., a student is recom
mended for remedial reading instruction) to probabilities (1 -
7i) of I7 not happening (i.e., a student is not recommended for
remedial reading instruction)DEMO Although logistic regression
can accommodate categorical outcomes that are polytomous,
in this article we focus on dichotomous outcomes only. The
illustration presented in DEMO article can be extended easily to
polytomous variables with ordered (i.e., ordinal-scaled) or
unordered
(i.e.,
nominal-scaled)

or there is no linear relationship DEMO the population. Rejecting
such a null hypothesis implies that a linear relationship exists
between X and the logit of Y. If a predictor is DEMO, as in the

Illustration of Logistic Regression Analysis
and Reporting
For the sake of illustration, we constructed a hypothetical
data set to which logistic regression was applied, and we
interpreted its results. The hypothetical data consisted of
reading scores and DEMO of 189 inner city school children
(Appendix A). Of these DEMO, 59 (31.22%) were recom
mended for remedial reading classes and DEMO (68.78%)
were not. A legitimate research hypothesis posed to the DEMO
was that "the likelihood that an inner city school child is
DEMO for remedial reading instruction is related to
both his/her reading score and gender." Thus, the outcome
variable,

remedial reading instruction (1 = yes, 0 = no), DEMO the two
predictors were students' reading score on a standardized
test (Xj = the reading variable) and gender (X2 = gender). DEMO
reading scores ranged from 40 to 125 points, with a mean DEMO
64.91 points and standard deviation of 15.29 points (Table
2). DEMO gender predictor was coded as 1 = boy and 0 = girl.
The gender distribution was nearly even with 49.21% (n =
93) DEMO and 50.79% (n = 96) girls.
Logistic Regression Analysis
A two-predictor logistic model was fitted to the data to
test the research hypothesis DEMO the relationship
between the likelihood that an inner city child is recom
mended for remedial reading instruction and his or her read
ing score DEMO gender. The logistic regression analysis was
carried out by the Logistic procedure in SAS? version 8
(SAS Institute Inc., 1999) in the DEMO 2000 environ
ment (SAS programming codes are found in Table 3)DEMO The
result showed that
Predicted logit of (REMEDIAL) = 0.5340
+ (-0.0261)*READING + (0.6477)*GENDER. (5)
According to the model, the log of the odds of a child
being recommended for remedial reading instruction was
negatively related to reading scores (p < .05) DEMO positively
related to gender (p < .05; Table 3). In other words, the high
er the reading score, the less likely DEMO is that a child would be
the same
recommended for remedial reading classes.
Given
reading score, boys were more likely to be recommended
for remedial reading classes than girls because boys were
coded to be 1 DEMO girls 0. In fact, the odds of a boy being
recommended DEMO remedial reading programs were 1.9111
(= g0-6477; Table 3) times DEMO than the odds for a girl.
The differences between boys and girls are depicted in
Figure 2, in which predicted probabilities of recommenda
tions are plotted for each gender group against various read
ing scores. From DEMO figure, it may be inferred that for a
given score on DEMO reading test (e.g., 60 points), the proba
bility of a boy being recommended for remedial reading
programs is higher than that of DEMO girl. This statement is also
confirmed by the positive coefficient (0.6477) associated
with the gender predictor.
Evaluations of the Logistic Regression Model
How DEMO is the model expressed in Equation 5?
How can an educational researcher assess the soundness of
a logistic regression model? To answer these questions, one
must attend to (a) overall model evaluation, (b) statistical
tests of individual predictors, (c) goodness-of-fit statistics,
and (d) validations of predicted probabilities. These evalua
tions are illustrated below for the model based on Equation
5, also referred to as Model 5.
Overall model evaluation. A logistic model is said to pro
vide a DEMO fit to the data if it demonstrates an improvement
over the intercept-only model (also called the null model). An

The research questions addressed in the eight articles
included American Indian adolescents' educational com

(Alexander, Dauber, & Entwisle, 1996; McNeal, 1998;
DEMO, 1997), students at-risk (Meisels & Liaw, 1993; Rush

ness (Diamond, Reagan, & DEMO, 2000). One central
theme shared by all was education-related adjustment DEMO
performance. The dependent variable was dichotomous,
whether it was retention in school, dropping-out from high

each study was to predict or to distinguish the outcome cat

To test pertinent research hypotheses, the authors of these
eight articles used three modeling approaches: direct,
sequential, and stepwise modeling. Of these three, only
direct and sequential DEMO were controlled and imple
mented by researchers (Peng & So, 2002a). Three studies
investigated interactions among predictors (Alexander,
Dauber, & DEMO, 1996; Meisels & Liaw, 1993; Trusty,
2000); the others did not. Though not all prior studies have
always followed the DEMO and recommendations out

making substantive contributions as well as for introducing
logistic regression
into the field of educational
research.
The Assessment
of Logistic Regression
Results
Four DEMO of authors (Alexander, Dauber, & Entwisle,
1996; Diamond, DEMO, & Bandyk, 2000; McNeal, 1998;
Rush & Vitale, DEMO) evaluated the overall logistic model;
all reported tests of individual DEMO, such as those
shown in Table 3. Evidence of the goodness-of-fit DEMO logis
tic models was provided by the R2 index for either the entire
model or for each predictor (Alexander, Dauber, &
Entwisle, 1996; Diamond, Reagan, & Bandyk, 2000; Rush
& Vitale, DEMO; Trusty, 2000). None reported the HL test.
Only one study (Rush & Vitale, 1994) validated predicted
probabilities against data in the Table 4 format. Our review,
however, uncovered two minor discrepancies in Rush and
Vitale's (1994) classification table (Table 5, p. DEMO). In
Table 5, the hit rate was reported to be DEMO, and misclas
sifications were 223 for at-risk children and 112 for DEMO
risk children. The text on page 332 reported a hit rate of

(Alexander,
Dauber,
& Entwisle,
1996; Diamond, Reagan, & Bandyk, 2000; Machamer &
Gruber, 1998) did present the DEMO model. Of those five,
three (Meisels & Liaw, 1993; DEMO, 1997; Trusty, 2000)
did not include intercepts in the DEMO model. Odds ratios
were reported in three studies (McNeal, 1998; DEMO &
Liaw, 1993; Rush & Vitale, 1994), and odds were reported
in one (Trusty, 2000).
One study presented results DEMO terms of marginal proba
bilities (McNeal, 1998). The use of marginal probabilities
has been criticized by Long (1997, pp. 74-75) and Peng et
al. (2002) because marginal probabilities do not correspond
to DEMO fixed change in the predicted probabilities that will
occur if there is a discrete change in one predictor (e.g.,
reading),
while

In
other words, the marginal DEMO corresponding to a
change in reading from 50 points to 60 points is different
from that associated with another 10-point change from,
say, 60 to 70 points. Furthermore, if other predictors (e.g.,
age) are held at their respective means, the corresponding
marginal probability for reading is different from that com
puted at other values (e.g., the DEMO). One study did not
explain how a categorical predictor was coded in the data
(Diamond, Reagan, & Bandyk, 2000). These DEMO for
mats create difficulties for readers to verify results with
another

One study (Trusty, 2000) coded a dichotomous predictor
as 1 (do not have a computer in the home) and 2 (do have a
computer), instead of the DEMO 0 and 1, or -1/2 and
+1/2 (Peng & So, 2002b). This practice is not necessarily
incorrect; it simply DEMO the interpretation of the regres
