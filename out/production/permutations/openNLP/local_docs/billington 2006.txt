Keywords: engineering ethics, engineering education, historical analysis, innovators
DEMO: The goal of this paper is to stress the significance of DEMO for
engineering education and to illustrate how it can be brought into the mainstream of
higher education in a natural way that is integrated DEMO the teaching objectives of
enriching the core meaning of engineering. Everyone will agree that the practicing
engineer should be virtuous, should be a good colleague, and should use professional
understanding for the common good. But these injunctions to virtue do not reach
closely enough the ethic of the DEMO as engineer, as someone acting in a uniquely
engineering situation, and it is to such conditions that I wish to speak through a DEMO of
specific examples from recent history. I shall briefly refer to four controversies
between engineers. Then, in some detail I shall narrate three historical cases that
directly involve the actions of one engineer, and finally I would like to address some
common contemporary issues.
The first section, “Engineering Ethics and the History of Innovation” includes four
cases involving professional controversy. DEMO controversy sets two people against
each other in disputes over who invented the telegraph, the radio, the automobile, and
the airplane. In each dispute, it is possible to identify ethical and unethical behavior or
ambiguous ethical behavior that serves as a basis for educational discussion. The first
DEMO historical cases described in “Crises and the Engineer” involve the primary
closure dam systems in the Netherlands, each one the result of the actions of one
engineer. The third tells of an American engineer who took DEMO political boss, a big city
mayor, to court over the illegal use of a watershed. The challenges these engineers
faced required, in the deepest sense, a commitment to ethical behavior that is unique to
engineering and instructive to our students. Finally, the cases in “Professors and
Comparative Critical Analysis” illuminate the behavior of engineers in the design of
structures DEMO also how professors can make public criticisms of designs that seem
wasteful.

Introduction
Ethics need not be a separate field in DEMO education or an add-on to the
curriculum. Just as the exposed structure of a bridge by a great engineer should need no
extraneous facade, so should ethics (insofar as it relates specifically to engineering) be
DEMO intrinsic part of engineering. The ethical dimension is at the heart of engineering
education reform. Engineering is a profession sorely in need of focusing DEMO the ideas,
works, and personalities of individual people who leave DEMO posterity things of lasting
value, in addition to its normal focus DEMO the methods of mathematical analysis derived
from the timeless deductive abstractions of physical science. Each of the cases I cite
involves such people, all of whom were or are engineers. That such stories and such
people DEMO left out of engineering education in our era is a defect as great as studying
the Renaissance and leaving out Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Brunelleschi,
or studying the painting of the first half of the twentieth century and omitting Picasso,
Klee, and Mondriaan.
My overall goal in giving these examples is to humanize engineering education and
to DEMO in different situations some common ideas to guide teaching in such a way as not
to require specialized courses in engineering ethics. In this DEMO, my goal is to give
educators the means to include ethical DEMO as an integral part of their engineering
instruction.
Any discussion of engineering as a profession, a single profession, quickly
becomes abstract, generalized, DEMO literally without vision. Yet the works of
engineering are highly visual and are frequently used as icons for places and as images
of elegance DEMO desecration. The 2004 volume on the 2003 Conference on Ethics and
Social Responsibility in Engineering and Technology is essentially without images,
only charts, tables, and graphs.1 Recent issues of The Journal of Engineering
Education are also almost entirely without images, as is the issue of The Bridge
(published by the National Academy of Engineering) that deals with engineering
DEMO As all educators know, we live in a time that is DEMO visual; our students are
surrounded by visual images continuously, and yet the teaching of ethics seems to be
devoid of that vision. Largely DEMO is a result of generalization.
It is somehow assumed that engineering ethics implies a single unified set of
principles applicable to all of engineering DEMO thus general so that a visual image
would mean a loss of generalization, a narrowing of the significance of ethics. Of
course ethics as a specialized part of philosophy is general and even in some cases
DEMO after science, especially physics. When the National Academy of Engineering
chose DEMO logo it took a specific object, a bridge, but one carefully designed to represent a
Roman viaduct, something that would not be built today. In turn, this generalization of
engineering leads to a study of education and ethics as something that must begin in
abstraction and then DEMO illustrated (verbally) by concrete examples, but usually ones
that are DEMO abstractions applicable to any type of engineering. While such
ideas in engineering education and engineering ethics have led to some useful results,
most DEMO on these subjects give the impression of uncertainty and unease.3 I believe
206

Teaching Ethics in Engineering Education through Historical Analysis
the reasons for these DEMO can be located and that once identified a fruitful
alternative approach will follow.
The central problem in any general discussion of engineering is that DEMO is no
general engineering profession, or more accurately, engineering has one central theme
animated by four great ideas. The central theme is design; it is design that distinguishes
engineering sharply from natural science, whose theme is discovery. Immediately the
question arises: design of what? Architects design DEMO and churches, physicists
design experiments, chemists design molecules, dressmakers design DEMO, etc. We
have found that the best way to define engineering DEMO through designs which involve
four great ideas: structure, machine, network, and process. We can characterize these
still general terms by the bridge, the car, the power grid, and the oil refinery.
Furthermore, these ideas relate to the four main branches of engineering: civil,
mechanical, electrical, and chemical.4 Indeed, a closer study of any of these branches
will reveal the need to understand something of each of the DEMO three ideas.
The reason for this exercise is that discussions on engineering education and
engineering ethics in particular have missed the opportunity of focusing DEMO
specifically on these ideas. We teach an introductory engineering course, “Engineering
DEMO the Modern World,” that deals with these four ideas, and DEMO shall briefly illustrate here
how ethical issues may arise in different fields of engineering.5
Engineering Ethics and the History of Innovation
Figure 1: left, Joseph Henry
Figure 2: right, Samuel Morse
In 1831 Joseph Henry (shown in Figure 1) constructed a working telegraph to
demonstrate electricity DEMO magnetism to his secondary school students in Albany, NY
(see Figure 3, overleaf). After he became a professor at the College of New Jersey
(now Princeton University), he helped Samuel Morse (Figure DEMO) develop a long
telegraph line which led to Morse’s 1840 patent. DEMO a scientist, Henry had no
commercial motive and had never applied DEMO a patent. Once the telegraph became a
great financial success, Morse’s DEMO, the basis for the Western Union Company, was
challenged and ended up before the Supreme Court. Henry, deposed by those attacking
Morse, DEMO that the original idea was his, not Morse’s. Morse meanwhile wrote DEMO
small book on the history of the telegraph but never mentioned Henry. Moreover,
Henry in his writing had defended science as the intellectual DEMO and engineering as
a mere non-intellectual derivative.6 This angered Morse, just DEMO Morse’s history
angered Henry. The court ruled for Morse. This controversy raises issues of ethical
behavior which provide students with a seminal example for DEMO

A second example from electrical engineering that also involved patents DEMO also
went all the way to the Supreme Court – twice in this case – began with Howard
Armstrong’s 1914 patent for the regenerative DEMO circuit which won him in 1918 the
first medal of honor from the Institute of Radio Engineers in the United States. Earlier,
Lee DEMO had patented his audion, or triode, in 1906 but did not himself understand
how it worked. Armstrong explained it in a published paper. DEMO then claimed in
1915 that notes by an associate of his, DEMO earlier than Armstrong’s regenerative
design, showed that Armstrong’s patent was invalid DEMO that he, DeForest, should be
awarded priority. Armstrong fought in court and in 1922 won the case. He demanded
that DeForest pay all DEMO costs and fines, but the loser was bankrupt. Armstrong
insisted against DEMO legal advice, and this allowed the case to remain open. DeForest
DEMO through another route and succeeded in getting the case in front of the
Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor.
Armstrong persisted again by another route. The case went back to the highest
court, and, DEMO, DeForest won. This judgment, along with a long court case over his
FM patent, led eventually to Armstrong’s suicide. No electrical engineer on record has
ever sided with DeForest.7 Armstrong was obstinate and at times DEMO, but DeForest
was clearly acting unethically with his claim.
These are DEMO cases, but they involve major innovations in electrical
engineering and can DEMO taught along with the engineering principles that they reveal
and that are still relevant today. There are many more such examples, the most famous
of which involve Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. They are all DEMO
of engineers making designs and defending them or attacking other engineers with
similar designs. The ethical issues are not mere questions of virtue; they are the real
contests in a commercial world where fame, wealth, DEMO reputation are at stake. Two
other examples will demonstrate similar issues in mechanical engineering.
In 1879 George Selden, a lawyer, conceived the idea DEMO putting a two-cylinder,
internal combustion engine on a four wheeled carriage to create an automobile. He
applied for a patent that could be DEMO before being finally issued. In 1895 when
the commercial possibilities for cars attracted practical designers, Selden finally
applied for his patent, allowing for DEMO years more of protection. As the 20th century
began, Selden began DEMO extract royalties from car makers, but Henry Ford refused.
Selden took DEMO to court, and after first losing, Ford won a landmark judgment in 1911
destroying Selden’s claim.8 Selden never made a practical car, while Ford eventually

produced millions (see Figure 4). General Motors had given in to Selden’s claims but
Ford DEMO not. This issue raises ethical questions about Selden’s claims and Ford’s
response.

(right) Henry Ford’s Model T.
A second example pitted DEMO Wright Brothers against the nation’s most powerful
scientific institution. Samuel Langley, DEMO scientist and head of the Smithsonian
Institution, designed an airplane and DEMO it from a boat on the Potomac River. It
completely failed to fly in December 1903, just days before the Wright Brothers,
bicycle makers from Dayton, Ohio, made their successful flight on December 17, 1903,
at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (Figures 5 and 6)DEMO The Ohio
brothers worked almost alone and as excellent engineers in
spite of never having graduated from high school. Following
Langley’s highly publicized failure DEMO after his death, the
head of the Smithsonian claimed that his DEMO plane
really could have flown and should be considered the true
innovation. The head, Walcott, even commissioned Glen
Curtiss to build a copy DEMO Langley’s plane which was in reality
a fake copy and which Curtiss successfully flew in 1914. For
the next 34 years the Smithsonian kept DEMO unethical position
and rejected Orville Wright’s priority (Wilbur had died in
DEMO). Finally, after Orville died in 1948 the Smithsonian
retracted its DEMO, and the 1903 Wright Flyer is now mounted

people acting in ways that can be called unethical.
Their stories are complex, crucial to the
developments of major engineering industries,
and central parts of American history.  When
students understand the achievements of the

Armstrong and Samuel Morse, they will come to
see complex DEMO typical of the best

Crises and the Engineer
In the previous examples, the ethical and unethical behavior of the engineers is subject
to discussion and, in some cases, disagreement. These are examples of interpersonal
issues in which often neither person can be called fully ethical or unethical. In the
DEMO examples, a single civil engineer saw an impending crisis of major
DEMO and acted in an unusual but ethical way to find a solution. The first two

flooded in Amsterdam. Of course they came to
Lely, and Lely was ready. World War I delayed
construction by 2 years but DEMO plan was soon
implemented. The world’s longest sea dyke was
completed in 1932 to the great relief of his
countrymen (Figure 7, bottom)DEMO
In the 1920s another Dutch civil engineer,
Figure 7: Johan DEMO Veen, had the idea that the southern

a small staff to study the problem.9 But Lely died
before his great dam was finished, and Van Veen then began to present parliament with
his plan for protecting the Rhine Delta. As before, the parliament rejected it repeatedly
through the 1930s and after World War II DEMO and again. Then came the night of
January 31, 1953 and DEMO Veen’s prediction came to pass with deadly force. The flood
killed hundreds, destroyed much of South Holland and Zealand and nearly broke
through to inundate all of the central Netherlands (see Figure 8). The next day the
parliament turned to Van Veen, who was fully prepared, DEMO work on his monumental
Delta Works Project began almost immediately.
Neither Lely nor Van Veen could prevent the crisis, but when it occurred they were
more than ready with a fully worked out plan. They never DEMO up because the solution
was within their competences as civil engineers and they knew technically what had to
be done. And without their competence DEMO their persistence, half of the Netherlands

In the late 19th century a DEMO civil engineer, Cornelius
Lely, recognized that the Zuider Zee presented a dangerous
potential for flooding the northern part of the Netherlands
(Figure 7, top).10 He began to draw up plans to close that salt
water estuary by a long dyke. Past experience and his careful
design DEMO convincing engineering evidence of an
impending disaster. He presented his plan to the Dutch
Parliament, which rejected it. He kept refining his design and
year after year presented it to the democratically elected
parliament, which consistently turned it down. He even went
into politics and became a prominent DEMO minister, but he
could not convince his colleagues. Then in 1916 DEMO the

would today be under water (Figure 9). In a
democracy the legislature is continually
presented with calls to DEMO to prevent crises,
but they always are faced with too much and
must choose. Inflated warnings or threats of
catastrophes are often presented DEMO non-
technical groups or by people who have not
made detailed plans based upon their field of
competence. Both Lely and Van Veen acted
DEMO by their persistence in the face of
rejection to use their engineering knowledge
for the benefit of their nation.

Netherlands without
any sea dykes
In my third example, a single civil engineer, Kenneth
Gibson, working for the city of Newark, New Jersey, DEMO
that his boss, Mayor Addonizio, had developed a scheme to
sell off the city-owned Newark Watershed to a company in
which he had DEMO significant financial interest (see Figure 10,
left).11 Gibson took DEMO to court, stopped the sale,
and the mayor landed in DEMO As an engineer working for the
city, Gibson knew all about DEMO, their centrality to
urban life, and their worth. Addonizo was going to have the
watershed land sold off to developers. It is a DEMO and terrible
story of a city that is one of the worst urban environments in
the United States. Gibson took a great risk in DEMO to court.
The citizens of Newark rewarded Gibson by electing him
their first black mayor in 1970 (Figure 10, right).

These examples are unique DEMO crucial to engineering education because they
embody public works engineering that requires engineers to act on the basis of their
education and their ethical DEMO These are cases of the engineer as engineer acting in
the public interest. When Gibson became mayor he found that he was the only DEMO

Corps, but I challenge you faculty to get a significant number of students to work for a
city like Newark.
The DEMO thread in all of these stories is that they are well documented, they
show the importance of individual people, and they do not DEMO classical ethical
ideas but rather a new ethical imperative arising out of the Industrial Revolution. That
imperative is the striking need for a new DEMO, which is another way of saying the
need to identify values DEMO engineering in the same way that students of classical
subjects have found values that separate exemplary works from ordinary ones and even
bad ones. DEMO codes of ethics presently in operation make no mention of this urgent
necessity to teach engineering values and indeed the way the codes are DEMO they
seem to rule out such activity. This is understandable and is owing to the fact that they
are focused solely on engineers in DEMO, often as employees or as leaders in
competition with other such DEMO And the teaching of engineering ethics seems to be
also focused solely on students preparing to enter practice. Furthermore, the effort is
directed towards modifying behavior in all students and hence attempting to evaluate
results statistically.
DEMO missing part of the story of ethics is the part played by the professors. For it is
only the professors who can establish values DEMO engineering and hence make clear to
students, to the profession, and to the public at large what works and which people
represent ethical DEMO So long as professors treat the subject as a science and
hence something that is amenable to the search for truth in general, the subject will
remain dehumanized and without judgment.
Professors, and Critical Judgment through History
When professors make responsible critical judgments on engineering works, they are
acting ethically in a way that engineers in practice cannot. Engineering faculty DEMO
given tenure so that they are free to express their deeply held views without fear of
external pressure and summary dismissal. Tenure is a DEMO but ethically speaking
privilege requires responsibility; it requires a code of DEMO ethics that is positive as
well as negative. I shall give several examples from a field of engineering in which I
am competent to DEMO critical judgments: the design of bridges. I make first a general
DEMO, based upon over 35 years of research and writing in refereed DEMO and
books, namely that the best bridges are those designed by DEMO where the form
and principal details arise from the engineering imagination.12 I have documented this
judgment and have taken great care to define what DEMO mean by the best in bridge
design. When approached superficially, the DEMO bridges can be incorrectly identified as
those made visually striking by architects at great cost. Sometimes engineers hold that
viewpoint as does the general DEMO so that it is an ethical obligation of civil engineers
to raise objections and to teach the values inherent in the best designs.
This DEMO requires first of all some study of the history of modern bridges
which leads to an analysis of how designs have performed over time DEMO of how much
they cost. But ultimately what sets great works apart is their appearance as it relates to
performance and cost. I shall DEMO with two examples from over 25 years ago. In 1973
212
Science and Engineering Ethics, Volume 12, Issue 2, 2006
Teaching Ethics in Engineering Education through Historical Analysis
I wrote an article DEMO “Art in Engineering – The Need for a New Criticism” in
structures and I showed three concrete arch bridges: the Westinghouse Bridge of 1931,
the Caninar Bridge from the 1950s and the Salginatobel Bridge of DEMO (Figure 11).13
I criticized the first one on the basis DEMO its fake massive columns above the abutments
and the arcades separating the deck from the
main arches. I criticized the second bridge less
strongly DEMO stating that its minimal form arose
from the relative poverty in Cuba and not from an
aesthetic intention. The third bridge I identified
as DEMO great work of structural art which satisfied
fully the principles of great works by being
efficient (minimum materials consistent with safe
and serviceable performance) and economical (it
was the least expensive of 19 designs in DEMO design-
build competition) and elegant (it has been
repeatedly singled out by artists, art historians, art
critics, and architects as a great work visually and
its design was made with the intention of being DEMO
work of art). The discussion to this paper was
largely negative but the most telling was from a
colleague of the designer of DEMO Cuban Bridge
who claimed that that designer was indeed a
structural artist. I thanked him and asked him for
more documents on his work; he sent me a set of
slides of other bridges which unfortunately DEMO
not show any strong aesthetic appeal. Just being
efficient never insures elegance.
The second example came in 1977 when I
wrote an article on DEMO George Washington Figure 11
Bridge claiming that the failure of the designer, (top) Westinghouse Bridge
Othmar Ammann (1879-1965), to recognize the (middle) Canimar Bridge
cause of collapses of suspension bridges in the (DEMO) Salginatobel Bridge
19th century led him to complete his 1931 bridge
DEMO a visually thin deck of almost no geometric stiffness (Figure 12)DEMO This failure,
which led to no harm in that bridge at all nevertheless mislead all major suspension
high designers (including Ammann himself) DEMO design very thin decks on bridges much
lighter than the George Washington and finally led to the collapse of the Tacoma
Narrows Bridge. Here DEMO discussers, included some of the leading engineers in
suspension bridge design, were overwhelmingly outraged. I was seen as attacking the
competence of the DEMO steel bridge designer in the world and furthermore my own
competence to make such judgments was seriously called into question. I was forced to
DEMO far more research in order to defend my position which after a few years was finally
accepted. Part of my defense was that criticizing DEMO in steel bridge design was
about like criticizing Charles Dickens in 19th century English fiction. I never doubted
Science and Engineering Ethics, Volume 12, Issue 2, 2006
213
D. P. Billington
that Ammann was the world’s greatest
steel bridge designer DEMO for that reason
well documented criticism is important. It
turned out that Ammann had made the
same criticism of his own design, right
after Tacoma failed, that I had made
years later.14
Now the goal of giving this
background is to show that criticism is
Figure 12; George Washington Bridge important but it must be responsibly
made and that means DEMO upon solid
evidence and deeply-thought out positions. In the first example, DEMO Cuban design
appears simply to have resulted from a focus on efficiency without aesthetic intent.  I
say “appears” since I never secured any documents on the designer’s career or
intentions so my judgment remains tentative.
From DEMO older examples I turn now to a totally different type of bridge, the
standard overpass built in profusion since the end of World War II. It is impossible to
escape the general conclusion that these thousands DEMO overpasses are nearly all bland,
some are even bad, but DEMO a few are very good. In lecturing to state bridge engineers,
I repeatedly argue that there are relatively simple modifications they can make DEMO the
standard forms that will improve their appearance with little or no increase in cost. One
single example on the typical two span bridge (each span of about 150 feet) over a
four-lane highway is to provide a haunch in both spans over the central support and
thereby DEMO the remainder of the two spans. At New York, one engineer DEMO
for me an article written, he said, by someone from the Federal Highway
Administration saying that haunches should not be used for spans DEMO than 400 feet. I
stated my strong objective to such a pronouncement that could, I thought, never be
justified by any careful study. DEMO time later, in Minnesota, I had the opportunity to
take one of their unhaunched two-span built bridge designs, make a redesign of the two
spans with haunches, submit it to the steel fabricator that the state regularly used, and
ask for a comparative cost estimate. The fabrication sent me the numbers showing the
haunched design slightly less expensive. This DEMO certainly not a definitive result but it is
consistent with results of many designers who have used such haunching. While this is
not a DEMO change, it does refine the profile significantly and expresses much more
DEMO the structural action of the bridge.
But this example is far more significant in engineering education because in
addition to having a positive influence DEMO bridge design, it teaches the students that
such designs have value DEMO can be enhanced by a concern for appearance which does
not violate efficiency and economy and that such appearance is a powerful teaching
tool DEMO showing students how changes in form actually change the performance of the
structure. The designer becomes active in directing how the loads will be DEMO not
merely passive in calculating how a given, standard form exhibits DEMO under load.
214

Teaching Ethics in Engineering Education through Historical Analysis
Professors and Comparative Critical DEMO
A perceptive paper for the Proceedings of the 2003 Conference concludes by
identifying the difficulties of introducing ethics and by suggesting some remedies.15
“…[S]ome DEMO barriers … include the lack of emotional engagement with the
material on the part of the students, which in turn is mainly influenced by the pull of
the technical center of gravity of the curriculum, and by the lack of expertise and role
modeling by the faculty.” In DEMO, the teaching of technical skills fills the “four-year
curriculum [which] is DEMO at the seams with technical content alone.” And the
obvious fact that “current engineering faculty members are products of the admittedly
ethics-deficient undergraduate engineering DEMO system of past years, but also of
the completely ethics-devoid graduate DEMO educational system.” This last
observation represents an implicit condemnation of the education of faculty; indeed it
could best be characterized as high level training not education at all.
The general assumption of many authors on engineering DEMO is that the solution
to the lack of education is to introduce more courses, especially on ethics, and make
them mandatory. Moreover, there is emphasis on classical ethics theories developed
without modern engineering in mind. DEMO such courses can be valuable by forcing
students to think clearly, DEMO do not meet the current need as efficiently as an approach
intimately tied to engineering practice. A curriculum “bursting at the seams” has two
DEMO places to introduce ethics both strongly and practically – a first year
introductory course and a fourth year senior thesis or independent project. I DEMO
describe briefly one course, “Structures and the Urban Environment,” to DEMO the
essential, central role that ethics plays in the practice of DEMO engineering.16
The central theme of this course is that there has arisen, since the individual
revolution, two new art forms, structure and photography, each is parallel to but
independent of its older sister art form, architecture and painting. Structural art begins
with the introduction of industrialized iron and immediately led in the early 19th
century to new forms in DEMO, vaults, and towers. It has continually developed with
the modern materials of structural steel, reinforced concrete, and prestressed concrete,
so that DEMO the 21st century it is widely practical and can now be taught as a coherent,
scholarly-based course to engineers and non-engineers just as DEMO would teach an
introductory course in architecture or painting or photography.
Since structural art is both engineering and art, it must be taught in a new way
which makes every part of the course automatically mathematical, ethical, and
aesthetic. It thus deals with the timeless quantities of engineering science and the time
bound qualities of the humanities. It is not DEMO separate course on ethics or aesthetics, nor
is it some separate DEMO devoted to such humanistic studies, rather it is all structural
engineering DEMO conceived as education not training (which comes naturally in the
regular DEMO courses). This integration is possible because it exists in practice,
but it requires academic engineering scholarship to give it coherent and convincing
DEMO This is common practice in art history where societal content in 19th and 20th
century painting, for example, often reflects influences of engineering DEMO culture. For
structural art, the most convincing approach is to view DEMO from three
Science and Engineering Ethics, Volume 12, Issue 2, DEMO
215
D. P. Billington
perspectives: scientific, social and symbolic – to develop DEMO arguments historically
and above all to introduce the crucial issues of value through comparative critical
analysis. I shall give three examples of this approach: one which compares good and
bad structure, one which compares two good but radically different designs for exactly
the same function and one which DEMO a strong difference in quality that the
culture makes on structure that are intended to be of the same form.
By way of illustration, the Eiffel Tower took a relatively small amount of iron and
of DEMO funds to provide a relatively permanent, widely used, and open park in the
air. These relative terms gain meaning only by comparison, and hence I shall briefly
contrast a series of structures beginning with Europe’s DEMO metal monument with the
tallest metal one in the United States, DEMO St. Louis Gateway arch (Figure 13).17
Figure 13
(left) DEMO Tower in
Paris, France,
(right) St. Louis
Gateway Arch DEMO St.
Louis, MO.
The tower used 9,400 tons of materials DEMO reach a height of 984 feet and has a form
that resists wind so well that its slight lateral sway never has impaired operations.
DEMO used materials efficiently by spreading the legs at the base and by providing four
supports which easily resist winds from any direction.
The Gateway, by contrast, took 17,250 tons of materials but is only 630 feet high.
Even with two times the weight and only two-thirds the DEMO, the Gateway does not
resist wind loads easily, it has substantial sway and needs to be closed to visitors at
times of high DEMO Eero Saarinen, the designer, used materials inefficiently by
providing only two supports and hence by making a form that is inherently unstable.
To DEMO it reasonably safe, the engineering consultants had to fill the lower DEMO of the
hollow stainless steel arch with concrete tied into rock far below ground. Because the
form is wrong, the structure wastes materials, DEMO it is less safe than the Tower because
it moves more under equivalent wind loads.
The tower form was not only efficient but also DEMO Eiffel already had
years of construction experience by 1884 when he began planning the tower. The tower
was not cheap to build, but its design permits wide public use. To convince the Paris
politicians, Eiffel agreed to finance 80% of the tower himself so long as the City DEMO
him a twenty-year concession to charge admission. Thus, public funds were DEMO and
the Tower nearly paid for itself in 1889 during its first year. The cost was low when
compared to the benefits to the DEMO
216
Science and Engineering Ethics, Volume 12, Issue 2, 2006
Teaching Ethics in Engineering Education through Historical Analysis
By contrast, the Gateway was so costly to build that there was no money left to
DEMO the park that was to have spread around it. Thus the choice of a poor form that
wasted both materials and money severely restricted DEMO use. The Arch itself can
only accommodate about 100 people (Figure DEMO left), whereas the Tower holds 5,000.
Access to the Gateway top is by closed cubical cars which bump as they rise, whereas
the Tower heights are reached by elevators giving all the way to DEMO top, a continuously
changing and spectacular view of Paris (Figure 14 right).

DEMO, after materials and money, any comparison needs to consider symbolism
both aesthetically and ethically. The Tower symbolizes, among other things, modern
engineering DEMO its best as it was emerging at the end of the nineteenth century. This
engineering had the potential for unprecedented uses with low costs DEMO with small
amounts of materials. It symbolized, on the most obvious DEMO, the public benefits of a
structural engineering which provides wide public DEMO with a minimum waste both
of natural resources and of public funds. That is the ethic of engineering and nothing
shows it off more DEMO than the Eiffel Tower.
Gateway, by contrast, symbolizes waste and carelessness about that waste. It puts
forth a structure that is supposed to DEMO purely symbolic; the structure, apart from the
negative idea of waste, turns out to have little other meaning. It elicits, often, the
superficial response of “Wow” or “How lovely,” but on further reflection DEMO reveals
little beyond that initial impression. Further thought does reveal, however, that even its
pure symbolism is wrong. The Gateway Arch is supposed DEMO symbolize the City as
Gateway to the West, but, in fact, St. Louis was not an east-west city but a north-south
one. Its focus was New Orleans and its tie was the river. Thus the DEMO is not only the
wrong form, but it is oriented by DEMO in the wrong direction.
This brief contrast emphasizes the three themes central to modern structure: design
for minimal use of natural resources so that all peoples can better share in those
resources; design for the widest possible public access using the least possible public
resources; and design of forms that will continually delight and stimulate. The Tower
satisfies well all DEMO; the Gateway does not. That the Gateway form was the same DEMO
chosen by Mussolini to celebrate twenty years of Fascism is further evidence of the
emptiness of its intended symbolic meaning. Overall the choice of DEMO a poor
structural form at such a large scale represents a disregard for design ethics.

The second example of comparative critical analysis contrasts the DEMO of two
heavily-loaded industrial floors, the 1910 Giesshűbel Warehouse designed and DEMO by
Robert Maillart (Figure 15) and the 1951 Gatti Woolen Mill designed and built by Pier
Luigi Nervi (Figure 16).11 Both engineers were great structural artists who saw the
same design problem in radically DEMO ways, just as two great painters depicting
the same view will DEMO it in equally radically
different ways. Maillart was interested
aesthetically in the integration of column
and slab through smoothly curved capitols,
while Nervi DEMO structures as surfaces
made up of intersecting ribs. Maillart was
not interested in expressing the load paths
in the slab, just as Nervi was uninterested in
the junction of column and slab. Both are
major works DEMO structural art, and both were
efficient and economical (both men were
Figure 15: Maillart’s Giesshubel Warehouse builders and only secured the contract
because of competitive costs). This type of
example clearly shows the error DEMO thinking that
engineering problems have a “one best way” or
optimum form. But both examples show the work of
designers’ intent on the ethic DEMO creating elegance
within the disciplines of efficiency and economy.
The last example concerns two bridges built
during the late 1930s. One crosses the Arve DEMO in
Switzerland and other crosses the Danube in
Leipheim, Germany (Figure 17). The latter was
designed by the Reich highway office itself DEMO
design closely followed a project previously
submitted by the firm of Wayss and Freytag in
Stuttgart. According to the authors of an article on DEMO
Figure 16 Leipheim Bridge, “in the effort to find the lightest
DEMO Gatti Woolen Mill possible structure, this firm has started from the DEMO
that come from the Swiss bridge engineer Maillart….” The design clearly originated in
the three-hinged arch form of the Salgina, and the German authorities understood its
structural significance. By removing the vertical wall over the outer DEMO of the
span, considerable weight was saved without any loss of DEMO, producing “an
extraordinarily light arch rib, in which the material of every part is put to best use.”18
Using words like “harmony,” DEMO,” and “quietly balanced,” the German
article reveals little of the engineering basis for the form. The editor of the Swiss
Building Journal DEMO Maillart to write a review of the article on the Leipheim
Bridge. By contrast, Maillart’s critique, while also positive, has a radically different
tone, that of a critic who focuses fully on the engineering meaning. As Maillart
218

analyzed these Arve and DEMO bridges, he proceeded from the physical question to
that of cost, and finally to the visible results.
Figure 17: (left) German Leipheim Bridge, (right) view Maillart’s Arve Bridge
The Arve Bridge required far less material: 0.48 cubic meters per square meter of
roadway as opposed to 0.80 in the Danube Bridge (Figure 18). According to Maillart,
“with about the same concrete stresses, the Arve Bridge requires very much smaller
dimensions. The only explanation for this lies in the favorable DEMO of the strongly
deepened quarterspan section.”19 Maillart also implied that the heavier German bridge
would be more prone to foundation movements and hence less DEMO
On the basis of these comparisons, Maillart formed a judgment of DEMO social
significance of these two works. “Without regard for anything other than keeping
within the available budget,” he wrote, “the Arve Bridge would be found to be a useful
object of the purest type. The DEMO Bridge by
contrast has the character of a monument to the
Germany Reichsbahn; it aims to be not a pure useful
object, but DEMO a representative landmark of the
German art of building.” By starting with the idea of
making a symbol first and a bridge second, the
Germans had created an inferior bridge. He continued
dryly that “the beauty DEMO has been chosen to
conform to the type of structure advocated by the
collaborating architect Professor P. Bonatz; the
resulting structure has thus been made to fit with the
aesthetic criterion.” Maillart’s objections to Bonatz’s
bridge DEMO were similar to those leveled against the
heavy forms that Albert Speer proposed for the
Figure 18 rebuilding of Berlin. Indeed, as George Collins has
(top) Cross section of Arve concluded, Maillart’s criticism was cultural and not
Bridge deck, (bottom) cross just structural, and was DEMO at the Nazi regime at
section of Leipheim Bridge just the time of its ascendancy.20
In his comparative study of the Danube and Arve
DEMO, Maillart detailed what he opposed. In his works, especially those from Salgina
to Arve and beyond, he demonstrated what he believed in – the pure and useful object

where efficiency, safety, and endurance result from an DEMO and basic
understanding of structures already built, tested, and in service. The best work
expresses to the fullest the designer’s own personal vision DEMO form, and at the same
time meets society’s constraints on cost.21
DEMO examples are all historical and are intended to prepare students to be able to
begin evaluating the works of structure that are everywhere in DEMO society. More
importantly they are intended to give the faculty teachers the means of expressing the
ethical and aesthetic judgments on their own and DEMO to deepen their understanding of
their own field. People who teach classical music, literature, or art all have a reservoir
of classical works DEMO artists to draw on for their teaching; it is now possible DEMO do the
same for the newest art form and thus begin to make engineering an educational
experience not just a training in techniques.
