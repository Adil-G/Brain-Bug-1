Instruments and Observers

Two data sources—self-reports and peer ratings—and two instruments—adjective factors and ques-
tionnaire scales—were DEMO to assess the five-factor model of personality. As in a previous study of
self-reports {McCrae & Costa, 1985b), adjective factors of neuroticism, DEMO, openness to
experience, agreeableness-antagonism, and conscientiousness-undirectedness were identified in an
DEMO of 738 peer ratings of 275 adult subjects. Intraclass correlations among raters, ranging from
.30 to .65, and correlations between mean peer ratings DEMO self-reports, from .25 to .62, showed
substantial cross-observer agreement on all five adjective factors. Similar results were seen in analyses
of scales from DEMO NEO Personality Inventory. Items from the adjective factors were used as guides
in a discussion of the nature of the five factors. These data DEMO recent appeals for the adoption
of the five-factor model in personality research and assessment.
Perhaps in response to critiques of trait models (Mischel,
1968) and to rebuttals that have called attention to common
inadequacies in personality research (Block, 1977), personolo-
gists in recent years have DEMO much of their attention to
methodological issues. Lively discussions have centered on the
merits and limitations of ideographic versus nomothetic ap-
proaches (Kenrick & Stringfield, 1980;Lamiell, 1981), aggrega-
tion and its effects on DEMO (Epstein, 1979; Rushton,
Brainerd, & Pressley, 1983), DEMO alternative methods of scale
construction (Burisch, 1984; Wrobel & Lachar, 1982). The ve-
ridicality of traits (beyond the realm of cognitive categories) has
been tested by examining the correspondence between traits
and behaviors (Mischel & Peake, 1982; Small, Zeldin, & Savin-
Williams, DEMO) and between self-reports and ratings (Edwards
& Klockars, 1981; Funder, 1980; McCrae, 1982). As a body,
these studies have simultaneously increased the level of method-
ological sophistication in personality research and DEMO con-
fidence in the intelligent use of individual difference models of
personality.
In contrast, there has been relatively little interest in the sub-
stance of personality—the systematic description of traits. The
variables chosen as vehicles for DEMO of methodological hypoth-
eses often appear arbitrary. Bern and Allen (1974) gave no ratio-
nale for the use of conscientiousness and friendliness in DEMO
classic paper on moderators of validity. McGowan and
Gormly's (1976) decision to examine activity and Small et al.'s
(1983) choice DEMO prosocial and dominance behavior appear to
have been made to facilitate their research designs. Indeed,
We wish to thank Petra Netter of the DEMO of Giessen for her
assistance in translating Amelang and Borkenau (1982), and Lewis R.
Goldberg and Auke Tellegen for many stimulating comments.

Kenrick and Dantchik (DEMO) complained that "catalogs of
convenience" have replaced meaningful taxonomies of DEMO
ality traits among "most of the current generation of social/
DEMO researchers" (p. 299).
This disregard of substance is unfortunate because substance
and method are ultimately interdependent. Unless methodolog-
ical studies are conducted DEMO well-defined and meaningful traits
their conclusions are dubious; unless the traits DEMO selected from
a comprehensive taxonomy, it is impossible to know how DEMO or
in what ways they can be generalized.
Fortunately, a few DEMO have been concerned with the
problem of structure and have recognized the need for a con-
sensus on at least the general outlines of DEMO trait taxonomy
(H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1984; Kline & DEMO, 1983; Wig-
gins, 1979). One particularly promising candidate has DEMO
The five-factor model—comprising extraversion or surgency,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability versus
neuroticism, and culture—of Tupes and Christal (1961) was
replicated by Norman in 1963 and heralded by him as the basis
for "an adequate taxonomy of personality." Although it was
largely neglected for several years, variations on this model have
recently begun to reemerge (Amelang & DEMO, 1982; Bond,
Nakazato, & Shiraishi, 1975; Conley, 1985; Digman & Take-
moto-Chock, 1981; Goldberg, 1981, 1982; Hogan, 1983; Lorr
& Manning, 1978; McCrae & Costa, 1985b).
DEMO researchers (Goldberg, 1982; Peabody, 1984) have
chiefly been concerned DEMO the representativeness and compre-
hensiveness of this model with respect to the natural language
of traits; others have sought to provide a theoretical basis for
the taxonomy (Hogan, 1983). Our major concern has been DEMO
convergent and discriminant validity of the dimensions of the
model across instruments and observers. If the five-factor
model is a reasonable representation of human DEMO, it
should be recoverable from questionnaires as well as from ad-
DEMO and from observer ratings as well as from self-reports.
This line of research addresses substantive questions from the
methodological perspective developed in the past DEMO years.

ROBERT R. McCRAE AND PAUL T. COSTA, JR.
Five Factors in Self-Reports and Ratings
One of the strongest arguments in favor of the DEMO
model has been its appearance in both self-reports and ratings.
Norman (DEMO) reported the structure in peer ratings. Goldberg
(1980) showed parallel DEMO in both ratings and self-re-
ports. As early as the 1960s, DEMO across observers was
also demonstrated (Borgatta, 1964; Norman & Goldberg,DEMO
1966). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Norman, 1969),
these studies used only adjective-rating scales, and few attempts
were DEMO to compare adjective factors with standardized ques-
tionnaires that are more widely used in personality research.
In a recent publication (McCrae & Costa, DEMO), we exam-
ined the correspondence between adjective and questionnaire
formats to see if the same substantive dimensions of personality
would be obtained in DEMO Our adjective-rating instrument was
an extension of one devised by Goldberg (DEMO); our question-
naire was the N EO Inventory (McCrae & DEMO, 1983a), which
measures three broad dimensions identified in analyses of DEMO
dard personality measures. Self-reports on five adjective factors
were compared with both self-reports and spouse ratings on the
inventory dimensions of neuroticism, extraversion, DEMO open-
ness to experience. In brief, the study showed that a DEMO of
the five-factor model could be recovered from the adjectives,
that there were clear correspondences for neuroticism and ex-
traversion dimensions across the DEMO instruments, that Nor-
man's culture factor was better interpreted as DEMO to expe-
rience, and that validity coefficients above .50 could be DEMO
tained with both self-reports and spouse ratings.
Three major questions were left unanswered by that study.
As Kammann, Smith, Martin, and McQueen (DEMO) pointed
out, research using spouses as raters differs in some respects
from more traditional peer-rating studies. Spouses may "more
often disclose their feelings to each other through verbal self-
statements" (p. 117), and DEMO may be more willing to adopt
and support the self-concept thus communicated than would
peers. Further, the design of our earlier study allowed compari-
son only between an observer and a self-report; no comparisons
were possible between different external observers. A first ques-
tion, then, concerned the DEMO of our findings to
agreement among peer ratings and between peer ratings and
self-reports.
A second question involved the particular five-factor struc-
ture observed DEMO our set of 80 adjectives. In most studies the
fifth and smallest factor has been labeled culture and has been
thought to include intelligence, sophistication, and intellectual
curiosity. The latter element, in particular, suggested corre-
spondence with the questionnaire factor of openness to experi-
ence (McCrae & Costa, 1985a). In Goldberg's 40-item instru-
ment (1983) the terms curious and creative fell on a factor de-
fined primarily by DEMO intelligence. By adding 40
additional items, including some intended to measure DEMO as-
pects of openness as preference for variety and imaginativeness,
we tested the hypothesis that the fifth factor might better be
construed as DEMO rather than as culture. Results confirmed
this expectation by showing a factor with only small loadings
from intelligent and cultured but large loadings from DEMO,
imaginative, and creative, and including other forms of open-
ness (independent, liberal, daring) that were clearly distinct
from intelligence. This DEMO correlated .57 with the NEO In-
ventory Openness scale. Because of the conceptual importance
of this reformulation of the Norman model, it was essential to
replicate the adjective-factor structure among peer ratings—the
data source on which DEMO (1963) had originally relied.
Finally, the NEO Inventory included no DEMO of two of
the Norman factors: agreeableness and conscientiousness.
These two DEMO have occurred less frequently in ques-
tionnaire measures, and they have DEMO thought by some to rep-
resent merely the respondent's evaluation of the target. Consen-
sual validation across observers is therefore particularly impor-
tant DEMO these two dimensions. For that purpose we developed
questionnaire measures of agreeableness-antagonism and con-
scientiousness-undirectedness, and we examined agreement
for both dimensions across instruments and observers in the
present study.
Method
Subjects
Individuals who provided self-reports DEMO who were targets for peer
ratings were members of the Augmented Baltimore Longitudinal Study
of Aging. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) DEMO
is composed of a community-dwelling, generally healthy group of vol-
unteers DEMO have agreed to return for medical and psychological testing
at regular intervals (Shock et al., 1984). The sample has been recruited
continuously DEMO 1958, with most new subjects referred by friends or
relatives already DEMO the study. Among the men, 93% are high school
graduates and DEMO % are college graduates; nearly one fourth have doctor-
ate-level degrees. DEMO Augmented BLSA sample consists of 423 men
and 129 women who participate in the BLSA, and it includes 183 wives
and 16 husbands who are not themselves BLSA participants but who
have agreed to complete questionnaires DEMO home. Some participants
chose not to participate in this study, and DEMO provided incomplete
data. Results are based on the 156 men and 118 women for whom com-
plete data were available, except for one subject who scored more than
five standard deviations below the mean on the DEMO adjec-
tive factor and whose adjective data were thrown out. Comparison of
individuals who chose to participate in the peer-rating study with others
showed DEMO significant differences in age or sex. Somewhat surprisingly,
there were also no differences in self-reported personality as measured
by the five adjective factors. DEMO subjects were slightly more
open to experience than were others, F(DEMO, 634) = 4.15, p < .05, when
NEO Inventory scores were examined. At the time of the peer ratings,
ages ranged DEMO 29 to 93 (M = 59.9 years) for men and from 28 to 85
(M =53.8 years) for women.
Peer Raters
Subjects DEMO asked to nominate
three or four individuals who know you very well as you are now.
They can be friends, neighbors, or co-workers, but they should not
be relatives. These should be people who have DEMO you for at
least one year and have seen you in a variety of situations.
A few subjects nominated more than four raters, and names and ad-
dresses for 1,075 raters were obtained, a few of whom were dropped
because they were themselves members of the BLSA DEMO had already
been nominated by another subject (peers rated only one DEMO). Of
those contacted, 747 (69%) provided rating data. Raters DEMO assured
of the confidentiality of their responses and were specifically instructed
not to discuss the ratings with the subject-
FIVE FACTORS IN PEER RATINGS
For purposes of item factor analyses, all ratings were pooled. For in-
traclass and peer/self-report correlations, data were analyzed in four
subsamples denned by the number of ratings available for DEMO subject:
49 subjects had exactly one raler, 71 had two DEMO, 90 had three, and
63 had four or more raters. Too few subjects had five or more raters to
allow analyses of these DEMO, and only the first four raters' data were
examined in these cases.
A background sheet completed by raters was used to characterize the
DEMO and their relationships to the subjects. As a group, the raters DEMO
sembled the subjects. They ranged in age from 19 to 87 (DEMO = 54.2
years), and the correlation of rater's age with subject's age was .72. Like
BLSA participants, the raters were well educated: 78% were high school
graduates, 57% were college graduates, and 41% had some graduate or
professional education. Most of the raters (91% of the men and 75% of
the women) were of the same sex as the subjects they rated. However,
when asked if they DEMO they were similar in "personality, attitudes,
temperament, and feelings" to the subject, only 8% of the raters consid-
ered themselves very similar, and 51% considered themselves similar;
34% considered themselves different, DEMO 7% considered themselves
very different from the subject.
The raters appeared to be well acquainted with the subjects. They
reported knowing the subjects for DEMO average of 18.3 years (range = 1
to 74 years). DEMO, 57% reported seeing the subject weekly, 27%
monthly, and 14% DEMO or twice a year. In addition, 9% of the subjects
volunteered DEMO information that they had seen the subject more fre-
quently at some time in the past. Furthermore, raters appeared to have
some depth of acquaintance: 61% reported that the subject sometimes
shared confidences or personal feelings with them, and 35% said he or
she often did. In addition, raters said that the subject sometimes (67%)
or often (15%) came to them for advice and support. When asked for
their own assessment, 56% said they knew the subject pretty well, 40%
said DEMO knew the subject very well.
Most (75%) of the raters described their relationship with the subject
as a close personal friend, 29% as a family friend, 28% as a neighbor,
and 34% as a coworker. Only 8% listed themselves as an acquaintance.
Most raters had seen DEMO subjects in a variety of settings: at parties or
social events (89%), with same-sex friends (67%), with family (85%), DEMO
work (51%), during subject's personal crisis (46%), on vacation (39%),
or at religious services (31%).
As a group, these raters seemed particularly well qualified to give per-
sonality ratings. They had known the subjects for many years, seen them
frequently in a variety of settings, and shared their confidences. The
raters themselves believed they could give accurate ratings: 86% be-
lieved they were good at understanding others, and 89% thought the
subject they rated was straightforward and easy to understand.
Measures and Procedure
Data from two kinds of instruments—adjective-rating DEMO factors
and questionnaire scales—were obtained by mail administration over a
period of 4 years. The schedule of administration of the personality
measures is given DEMO Table 1.
Adjective factors. On the basis of a series of analyses of English-lan-
guage trait names, Goldberg (1983) developed a 40-item bipolar1 adjec-
tive-rating scale instrument to measure five major dimensions of per-
sonality. DEMO subsequent work (McCrae & Costa, 1985b) we supple-
mented his DEMO with an additional 40 items. Subjects rated themselves
on this 80-item instrument with the use of Goldberg's 9-point scale.
Five factors were derived DEMO these self-reports and identified as neu-
roticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
Similar factors were found for men and women. Neuroticism, extraver-
sion, and openness factors were validated against NEO Inventory mea-
sures of the same constructs from both self-reports and spouse ratings,
with convergent DEMO ranging from .52 to .65 (McCrae & Costa,

1985b). To examine the factor structure of this instrument in peer rat-
ings is one of the aims of this article.
NEO Personality DEMO A questionnaire measure of the five-fac-
tor model is provided by the NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & Mc-
Crae, 1985), which comprises DEMO NEO Inventory (Costa & McCrae,
1980; McCrae & Costa, DEMO) along with newly developed scales to
measure agreeableness and conscientiousness. The DEMO NEO In-
ventory is a 144-item questionnaire developed through factor analysis
to fit a three-dimensional model of personality. Eight-item scales are
used for each DEMO six facets or specific traits within each of three broad
trait dimensions, and overall scores are obtained by summing the scores
of the six facets of neuroticism, extraversion, and openness. Item scor-
ing is balanced DEMO control for acquiescence, and socially desirable re-
sponding does not appear DEMO bias scores (McCrae & Costa, 1983b). In-
ternal consistency and 6-month retest reliability for the three global
scores range from .85 to DEMO (McCrae & Costa, 1983a). A third-person
form of the NEO Inventory has been developed for use by raters and
has shown comparable DEMO and validity when spouse ratings are
obtained (McCrae, 1982).
Questionnaire scales to measure agreeableness and conscientiousness
were developed as part of the DEMO research. Two 24-itcm rational
scales were created, and joint factor analysis DEMO these items with NEO
Inventory items led to the identification of the hypothesized five factors.
Ten items loading on the agrccableness and conscientiousness factors
DEMO tentatively adopted as measures of those factors. These items also
correlated more highly with the appropriate adjective factor than with
any of the other DEMO factors in self-reports.
When the NEO Inventory Rating Form was administered to peers,
60 items intended to measure agreeableness and conscientiousness were
interspersed. DEMO included the best items from the pilot study under-
taken on self-reports along with new items written subsequently. Two
final 18-item scales measuring agreeableness DEMO conscientiousness2
were derived from analyses of these data. Two criteria were used for item
selection. First, joint factor analysis with the NEO items in peer ratings
again showed five factors that could be identified as neuroticism, extra-
version, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Items selected
for the final scales were required to have their highest loadings on their
hypothesized factor. DEMO, scales were created by using the 10-item
preliminary scales developed on DEMO The 60 proposed items
were correlated with these two scales as well as with the three domain
1 It is sometimes questionable whether the DEMO in bipolar scales
are true psychological opposites. If they are not, DEMO pole may load on
one factor, the opposite pole on another. DEMO consequence, the scale may
appear factorially complex.

scores from the NEO Inventory Rating Form. To be included in the
final selection, items were required to show higher correlations with the
Agreeableness or Conscientiousness scale DEMO with any of the other
four scales. Because the final selection included some items written after
the self-report data had been collected, the final self-report scales con-
sisted of only 10 agreeableness and 14 conscientiousness items.
DEMO alpha for the Conscientiousness scale was .91 within peer
ratings and .84 within self-reports; for the Agreeableness scale it was .89
within peer ratings but only .56 within self-reports. In part, this low
internal consistency was due to the inclusion of only 10 items in the self-
report DEMO; in part, it was due to lower average interitem correlations.
Correlations between questionnaire and adjective measures of agree-
ableness and conscientiousness in self-reports DEMO .48 and .65, respec-
tively; neither scale correlated over .20 with any of the other adjective
factors.
It is essential to note that DEMO the development of the Agreeable-
ness and Conscientiousness scales was conducted in parallel on peers
and self-reports, correlations across these two methods did not influ-
ence item selection in any way. Thus, the correlation between self-re-
ports and ratings was not inflated by the capitalization on chance inher-
DEMO in some types of item selection.
Results
The results will be considered in three sections. First, we will
examine the factor structure of the 80-item adjective-rating
scales in peer ratings and validate the factors by correlation DEMO
peer ratings on the NEO Personality Inventory. Second, we will
consider DEMO among peers on the personality characteris-
tics of the targets they have rated by examining intraclass corre-
lations among raters for both adjective factor DEMO questionnaire
measures of the five-factor model. Finally, we will present corre-
DEMO between self-reports and peer ratings.
Adjective Factors in Peer Ratings
Everett (DEMO) has recently suggested that the number of fac-
tors to be DEMO and interpreted should be determined by
comparing rotated solutions in different samples or subsamples
and adopting the solution that can be replicated. Coefficients of
DEMO comparability should be used as the measure of similar-
ity, and DEMO suggested that coefficients above .90 be required
to consider two factors to be a match. When peer ratings on
the 80 adjective scales were DEMO to principal components
analysis, a scree test suggested that approximately five DEMO
would be needed. Everett's procedure was then used to compare
solutions in self-reports and peer ratings for the third through
eighth factors. Varimax-rotated DEMO solutions were ob-
tained independently in self-report data from 503 subjects (DEMO
Crae & Costa, 1985b) and in ratings from 738 peers. Compara-
bility coefficients were calculated by applying the scoring
weights derived from both DEMO to the data from peers and
by correlating the resulting factor scores. This process was re-
peated for four-, five-, six-, seven-, DEMO eight-factor solutions (re-
sults are shown in Table 2). Only DEMO five-factor solution showed
replication of all factors, and comparabilities were very DEMO in
this case, ranging from .95 to .98. This is clear DEMO that
the five-factor solution, and only the five-factor solution, was
invariant across observers.

are arranged using the structure DEMO in self-reports (Mc-
Crae & Costa, 1985b) for comparison. The DEMO between fac-
tors in the two data sets is clear; the DEMO majority of items
loaded on the same factor in peer ratings as they did in self-
reports. The most notable difference appeared to be DEMO the peer
agreeableness-antagonism factor, which included, asdefinersof
the antagonistic pole, DEMO of dominance (e.g., dominant,
bold) from the extraversion factor DEMO hostility (e.g., tempera-
mental,jealous) from the neuroticism factor.
The DEMO of structure was particularly important in the
case of the openness factor. In peer ratings, as in self-reports,
broad interests, prefer variety, independent, and liberal were
among the definers of this factor; intelligent DEMO cultured
showed small loadings. From this set of 80 items in both data
sources, a factor emerged in which concern with rich and varied
experience was more central than cognitive ability.
The interpretation of the peer-rating DEMO were confirmed
by correlating factor scores with scale scores from the NEO Per-
sonality Inventory ratings. Convergent correlations between ad-
jective factors and corresponding DEMO scales were .73 for neu-
roticism, .70 for extraversion, .70 for openness, .80 for agree-
ableness, and .76 for conscientiousness (N = 722, p< .001). The
largest divergent correlation was .33. These DEMO demon-
strate that raters were highly consistent across instruments in
the ways in which they described their targets on each of the five
dimensions. DEMO findings do not, however, speak to the accuracy
of the ratings, as judged against external criteria.
Consensual Validation Across Peer Raters
The extent to which different peers agreed on the attribution
of traits to the DEMO individual was calculated by examining the
intraclass correlations between factor scores for raters. In-
traclass correlations were equivalent to the Pearsonian correla-
tion between DEMO possible pairs of raters (Haggard, 1958). The
top half of Table 4 gives intraclass correlations for groups of
subjects with two, three, or four raters. All were statistically sig-
nificant, and values ranged DEMO .30 to .65, with a median of
.38. Levels of cross-peer DEMO were approximately equal
for all five factors. These data provide evidence of consensual
validation for all five dimensions in three independent subsam-
ples.
Agreement DEMO observers on questionnaire measures is
seen in significant intraclass correlations given in the bottom

l points are DEMO
half of Table 4 for three subsamples. These correlations closely
resemble those for adjective factors, and they suggest that peers
agreed as well on questionnaire as on adjective checklist de-
scriptions of their friends.
Although the DEMO of correlations seen in Table 4 com-
pares favorably with most in the literature (see McCrae, 1982,
for a review), and DEMO virtually all exceed the .3 barrier
sometimes thought to set a limit to validity coefficients in per-
sonality research, it is also true that there was room for consid-
erable difference of opinion between raters with DEMO to the
same subject.
Agreement Between Self-Reports and Ratings
Agreement among raters was only one piece of evidence for
consensual validation. It could be DEMO that shared stereo-
types account for some or all of the agreement among peers
(Bourne, 1977). A more rigorous test would compare DEMO
with self-reports, because it is unlikely that any of the artifacts
DEMO either of these sources would be shared (McCrae,
1982). DEMO top half of Table 5 presents the correlations between
averaged peer ratings and self-reports for each of the five factors.
With the exception of DEMO among subjects having
only a single rater, all the correlations were DEMO signifi-
cant and many were substantial in magnitude.
The bottom half of Table 5 gives corresponding correlations
for the NEO Personality Inventory for subjects DEMO complete
data. Although several correlations were small when only a sin-
gle rater was used, they increased considerably in magnitude
when multiple raters were averaged. Only the Agreeableness
scale failed to show the utility of aggregating DEMO

Finally, we considered divergent as well as convergent valida-
tion of the five DEMO across instruments and observers. To sim-
plify presentation of the data, DEMO four subsamples were com-
bined by calculating an average peer rating (DEMO within
subsample) for each adjective-factor and questionnaire scale.
Table 6 presents DEMO correlations of mean peer ratings on both
adjective factors and questionnaire scales with self-reports on
the same variables. Convergent correlations, given in boldface,
were invariably larger than divergent correlations, markedly so
for all cases except those involving the self-report questionnaire
Agreeableness-Antagonism scale. Because there was good
agreement DEMO observers when the agreeableness adjective-
factor scores were used, it could DEMO inferred that the problem
here lay with the questionnaire scale and not with the construct.
This was expected given the low reliability of the DEMO
Agreeableness scale used in self-reports. For all five dimensions,
the median validity coefficient was .44. When examined by sex,
convergent correlations ranged DEMO .19 to .58 for men
(median = .35) and from . 17 to .56 for women (median = .48).
Discussion
Convergence Across Observers and Instruments
This research examined the correspondence between assess-
ments of DEMO major personality dimensions among peer ratings
and between peer ratings and self-reports, using both adjective
factors and questionnaire scales. The results are straightfor-
ward, showing convergent and discriminant cross-observer and
cross-instrument validation for all five factors.
The magnitude of the correlations—generally .4 to .6—de-
serves some comment, because it was larger than typically re-
ported (e.g., Borgatta, 1964). In part, the higher agreement may
be due to reliable and well-constructed measures and, in part,
to the nature of the raters. On the whole, raters were very well
acquainted with the subjects they rated, having seen them fre-
quently in a variety of circumstances over a period of many
years. As Table 5 shows, aggregating across raters also tended to
increase agreement. However, as Kammann et al. (1984) noted,
there are limits to the improvements in accuracy offered by ag-
DEMO Although the averaged ratings may reflect more accu-
rately the consensus of how the individual is viewed, they may
always diverge to some extent from the individual's phenome-
nological view of himself or herself. Given DEMO qualifications of
the raters in this study, it seems likely that DEMO correlations seen
here will be near the ceiling for self-other agreement.
It is also worth pointing out that ratings and self-reports
differed in another DEMO as well. When raw scores on the NEO
Inventory were compared, DEMO were approximately one-half
standard deviation higher on extraversion, and one-third lower
DEMO neuroticism, than were self-reports. Separate norms would
thus be needed to DEMO self-reports and ratings comparable.
The Nature of the Five Factors
These methodological considerations lay the groundwork for
the equally important question of substance. A DEMO body
of research has pointed to the five-factor model as a recurrent
and more or less comprehensive taxonomy of personality traits.
Theorists disagree, however, on precisely how to conceptualize
the factors themselves. It seems useful at this point to review
each of the factors and attempt to define DEMO clear elements as
well as disputed aspects. The factors in Table 3, which so closely
parallel factors found in self-reports and which show such clear
evidence of convergent and discriminant validity across observ-
ers and instruments, can form a particularly useful guide to the
conceptual content of the DEMO of personality.
Neuroticism versus emotional stability. There is perhaps least
disagreement about neuroticism, defined here by such terms as
worrying, insecure, self-conscious, DEMO temperamental. Al-

e
though adjectives describing DEMO are relatively infre-
quent in English (Peabody, 1984), psychologists' DEMO with
psychopathology have led to the development of innumerable
scales saturated with neuroticism. Indeed, neuroticism is so
ubiquitous an element of personality scales that theorists some-
times take it for granted.
A provocative view of neuroticism DEMO provided by Tellegen (in
press), who views it as negative DEMO, the propensity to
experience a variety of negative affects, such as anxiety, depres-
sion, anger, and embarrassment. Virtually all theorists would
concur in the centrality of negative affect to neuroticism; the
question is whether other features also define it. Tellegen him-
self (in press) pointed DEMO that his construct of negative emo-
tionality has behavioral and cognitive aspects. Guilford in-
cluded personal relations and objectivity in his emotional
health factor (Guilford, Zimmerman, & Guilford, 1976), sug-
gesting that mistrust and self-reference form part of neuroti-
cism. We have found that impulsive behaviors, such as tenden-
cies to overeat, smoke, or drink excessively, form a facet of neu-
roticism (Costa & McCrae, 1980), and DEMO is a
definer of the neuroticism factor in self-reports, although not
DEMO ratings. Others have linked neuroticism to irrational beliefs
(Teasdale & Rachman, 1983; Vestre, 1984) or to poor coping
efforts (McCrae & DEMO, 1986).
What these behaviors seem to share is a common DEMO in
negative affect. Individuals high in neuroticism have more
difficulty than others in quitting smoking because the distress
caused by abstinence is stronger for DEMO They may more fre-
quently use inappropriate coping responses like hostile reac-
tions and wishful thinking because they must deal more often
with disruptive DEMO They may adopt irrational beliefs like
self-blame because these beliefs are cognitively consistent with
the negative feelings they experience. Neuroticism appears to
include not DEMO negative affect, but also the disturbed thoughts
and behaviors that accompany DEMO distress.
Extraversion or surgency. Sociable, fun-loving, affectionate,
friendly, and DEMO are the highest loading variables on the
extraversion factor. This is not Jungian extraversion (see Guil-
ford, 1977), but it does correspond DEMO the conception of H. J.
Eysenck and most other contemporary researchers, DEMO concur
with popular speech in identifying extraversion with lively so-
ciability.
However, disputes remain about which elements are central
and which are peripheral to extraversion. Most writers would
agree that sociability, cheerfulness, activity level, assertiveness,
and sensation seeking all covary, however loosely. But the Eysen-
cks have at times felt the need to distinguish between sociability
and what DEMO call impulsiveness (S. B. G. Eysenck & Eysenck,
1963; Revelle, Humphreys, Simon, & Gilliland, 1980). Hogan
(1983) believed DEMO the five-factor model was improved by di-
viding extraversion into sociability and assertiveness factors. In
Goldberg's analyses, surgency (dominance and activity) were
the primary definers of extraversion, and terms like warm-cold
were assigned to the agreeableness-antagonism factor. Tellegen
(in press) emphasized the complementary nature of DEMO
cism and extraversion by labeling his extraversion factor posi-
tive emotionality.
These distinctions do seem to merge at a high enough level
of analysis (H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1967; McCrae & Costa,
1983a), and sociability—the enjoyment of others' company—
seems to be the core. DEMO is essential to recall, however, is that
liking people does not necessarily make one likable. Salesmen,
those prototypic extraverts, are generally happier to see you
than you are to see them.
Openness to experience. DEMO reinterpretation of Norman's
culture as openness to experience was the focus of some of our
previous articles (McCrae & Costa, 1985a, I985b), and the rep-
lication of results in peer ratings was one DEMO the purposes of the
present article. According to adjective-factor results, openness
DEMO best characterized by original, imaginative, broad interests,
and daring. In the case of this dimension, however, question-
naires may be better DEMO adjectives as a basis for interpretation
ROBERT R. McCRAE AND PAUL T. COSTA, JR.
and assessment. Many aspects of openness (e.g, openness to
feelings) are not easily expressed in single adjectives, and the
relative poverty of the English-language vocabulary of openness
and closedness may have contributed to confusions about this
domain (McCrae & Costa, 1985a). We know from question-
naire studies that openness can be manifest in fantasy, aesthet-
ics, feelings, actions, ideas, and values (Costa & McCrae, 1978,
1980), but only ideas DEMO values are well represented in the ad-
jective factor. Interestingly, questionnaire DEMO of openness
give higher validity coefficients than do adjective-factor mea-
sures—indeed, DEMO correlation of .57 between the self-reported
NEO Openness scale and the peer-rated NEO Openness scale
is the highest of those shown in Table 6.
DEMO the most important distinction to be made here is
between openness and intelligence. Open individuals tend to be
seen by themselves and others as DEMO more intelligent,
and there are correlations of .30 between psychometric mea-
sures of intelligence and openness. However, joint factor analy-
ses using Army Alpha intelligence subtests and either adjectives
(McCrae & Costa, 1985b) or NEO Inventory scales (McCrae &
Costa, 1985a) show that intelligence DEMO define a factor
clearly separate from openness. Intelligence may in some degree
predispose the individual to openness, or openness may help
develop intelligence, DEMO the two seem best construed as sepa-
rate dimensions of individual differences.
Agreeableness versus antagonism. As a broad dimension,
agreeableness-antagonism is less familiar DEMO extraversion or
neuroticism, but some of its component traits, like trust (Stark,
1978) and Machiavellianism (Christie & Geis, 1970), DEMO been
widely researched. The essential nature of agreeableness-antag-
onism is perhaps best seen by examining the disagreeable pole,
which we have labeled antagonism. DEMO the high-loading adjec-
tives in Table 3 and the items in Table 2 show, antagonistic peo-
ple seem always to set themselves against others. Cognitively
they are mistrustful and skeptical; affectively they are callous
and unsympathetic; behaviorally they are uncooperative, stub-
born, and rude. It would appear that their sense of attachment
or bonding with their fellow human beings DEMO defective, and in
extreme cases antagonism may resemble sociopathy (cf. H. J.
Eysenck & Eysenck's, 1975, psychoticism).
An insightful description DEMO antagonism in its neurotic form
is provided by Horney's account of the tendency to move
against people (1945, 1950). She theorized DEMO a struggle for
mastery is the root cause of this tendency and that variations
may occur, including narcissistic, perfectionistic, and arrogant
vindictive types. Whereas some antagonistic persons are overtly
aggressive, others may be polished manipulators. The drive for
mastery and the overt or inhibited hostility of antagonistic DEMO
viduals suggests a resemblance to some formulations of Type A
personality (DEMO & MacDougall, 1983), and systematic
studies of the relations between DEMO and
measures of coronary-prone behavior should be undertaken.
Unappealing as antagonism may be, it is necessary to recog-
nize that extreme scores on the agreeable pole may also be mal-
adaptive. The person high in agreeableness DEMO be dependent
and fawning, and agreeableness has its neurotic manifestation
in DEMO's self-effacing solution of moving toward people.
Antagonism is most easily confused with dominance. Amel-
ang and Borkenau (1982), working in German and apparently
unaware of the Norman taxonomy, found a factor they called
dominance. Among its key definers, however, were Hartnackig-
keit (stubbornness) and DEMO (irritability); scales that
measure agreeableness and cooperation denned the opposite
DEMO in their questionnaire factor. Clearly, this factor corre-
sponds to antagonism. DEMO self-reports (McCrae & Costa,
1985b), submissive-dominant is a weak DEMO of extraversion;
in Table 3, from the peers' point of view, it is a definer of antago-
nism. The close etymological relationship of dominant and
domineering shows the basis of the confusion.
Agreeableness-antagonism and DEMO
edness are sometimes omitted from personality systems be-
cause they may seem too value laden. Indeed, the judgment of
character is made largely along these two dimensions: Is the in-
dividual well or ill intentioned? DEMO he or she strong or weak in
carrying out those intentions? DEMO, in
particular, has often been assumed to be an evaluative factor of
others' perceptions rather than a veridical component of per-
sonality (DEMO, A. Tellegen, personal communication, March 28,
1984).
However, the fact that a trait may be judged from a moral
point DEMO view does not mean that it is not a substantive aspect
of personality. The consensual validation seen among peers and
between peer-reports and self-reports DEMO that there
are some observable consistencies of behavior that underlie at-
tributions of agreeableness and conscientiousness. They may be
evaluated traits, but they are not mere evaluations.
Conscientiousness versus undirecledness. Conscientious may
mean either governed by DEMO or careful and thorough
(Morris, 1976), and psychologists seem to be divided about
which of these meanings best characterizes the last major DEMO
mension of personality. Amelang and Borkenau (1982) labeled
their factor self-control versus impulsivity, and Conley (1985)
spoke of impulse control. This DEMO connotes an inhib-
iting agent, as Cattell (Cattell, Eber, & Tatsuoka, 1970) recog-
nized when he named his Factor G superego DEMO A consci-
entious person in this sense should be dutiful, scrupulous, and
perhaps moralistic.
A different picture, however, is obtained by examining DEMO
adjectives that define this factor. In addition to conscientious
and scrupulous, DEMO are a number of adjectives that suggest a
more proactive stance: DEMO, ambitious, energetic, per-
severing. Digman and Takemoto-Chock (1981) labeled DEMO fac-
tor will to achieve, and it is notable that one DEMO the items in
the questionnaire measure of conscientiousness, "He strives for
excellence in all he does," comes close to the classic definition DEMO
need for achievement (McClelland, Atkinson, Clark, & Lowell,
1953).
At one time, the purposefulness and adherence to plans,
schedules, and requirements suggested the word direction as a
label for this factor, and we have retained that implication in
calling the opposite pole of conscientiousness undirecledness.
In our view, the individual low in conscientiousness is not so
much uncontrolled as undirected, not so much impulse ridden
as simply lazy.
It seems probable that these two meanings may be related.
Certainly DEMO who are well organized, habitually care-
ful, and capable of self-discipline are more likely to be able to
adhere scrupulously to a moral DEMO if they choose to—al-
FIVE FACTORS IN PEER RATINGS

though there is no guarantee that DEMO will be so inclined. An
undirected individual may have a demanding conscience and a
pervasive sense of guilt but be unable to live up DEMO his or her
own standards for lack of self-discipline and energy. In any case,
it is clear that this is a dimension worthy DEMO a good deal more
empirical attention than it has yet received. Important real-life
outcomes such as alcoholism (Conley & Angelides, 1984) and
academic achievement (Digman & Takemoto-Chock, 1981) are
among its correlates, and DEMO further specification of the dimen-
sion is sure to be fruitful.
Some personality theorists might object that trait ratings, in
whatever form and from whatever source, need not provide the
best foundation for understanding individual differences. Ex-
perimental analysis of the psychophysiological basis of person-
ality (H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1984), examination ofproto-
typic acts and act frequencies (Buss & Craik, 1983), psychody-
namic formulations (Homey, 1945), or behavioral genetics
(Plomin, DeFries, & McClearn, 1980) provide DEMO alter-
natives. But psychophysiological, behavioral, psychodynamic,
and genetic explanations must eventually be related to the traits
that are universally used to describe DEMO, and the five-
factor model can provide a framework within which DEMO re-
lations can be systematically examined. The minor conceptual
divergences noted in this article suggest the need for additional
empirical work to fine-tune the DEMO, but the broad outlines
are clear in self-reports, spouse ratings, DEMO peer ratings; in
questionnaires and adjective factors; and in English and in Ger-
man (Amelang & Borkenau, 1982; John, Goldberg, & An-
gleitner, 1984). Deeper causal analyses may seek to account for
the structure of personality, but the structure that must be ex-
plained is, for now, best represented by the five-factor model.
