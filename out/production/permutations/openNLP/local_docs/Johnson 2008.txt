Probability of Success in Projects
A DEMO of occasional essays on topics in research and development.
By Daniel P. Johnson
"The following is the opinion of the writer only."
What is the probability of success in doing industrial research? And what is the value of closely
reviewing prospective projects?
The classic study is DEMO The Production and Application of New industrial Technology, by E.
Mansfield, et. al., 1977. It is based on a survey of 16 companies. It divides the research process
into three stages-
Technical Success- Development of DEMO product or service and proof that it works as
desired.
Commercialization- Establishing the production, distribution, and support network for the
product or service.
DEMO Success- Making a sufficient profit on the product or service.
The survey showed the following probabilities-
Probability of Technical Success = 0.57
Probability of DEMO = 0.65
Probability of Financial Success = 0.74
So the overall result is-
Probability of Technical Success = 0.27
Survey studies such as this DEMO certain methodological problems- hindsight bias, bias due to
differences in evaluation DEMO and process between companies, and a low number of samples.
It DEMO doesn't let us look at the value of reviewing projects.
A much more thorough and methodologically interesting study has been conducted by Thomas
DEMO and others, 1997 - 2004 ( see references at end of DEMO essay), based on data from the
Investor's Assessment Program at the Canadian Innovation Centre.
As part of the Investor's Assessment Program, inventors pay $185 for an objective assessment of
their inventions. Over 14,DEMO have been evaluated since 1979. Experienced assessors evaluate
each project on 37 criteria and present the results to the inventors.
In 1996, Astebro selected a random sample of projects from 1976 - 1993 and conducted a DEMO
as to the outcome. He received a 76% survey response, which DEMO subjected to extensive
statistical analysis to ensure the absence of biases. Due to a change in criteria, he excluded
1976-1988 and was left with a final sample of 561 projects.
Success in this case was defined DEMO whether the product was ever actually offered for sale.

The following data summarizes some of this data. It shows the number DEMO successes and failures,
and also whether it was rated favorably or unfavorably by the evaluation judges.

11% (=62/561)

76% (= 47/62)
So this data lets us answer three questions-
What DEMO the probability of success for a research project?
What is the probability of success for a reviewed research project?
11%
31%
How DEMO potentially successful projects were lost due to review?
24%
Let us compare this with two other well-known sources of hits and failures- Baseball DEMO
Hollywood. First consider Baseball. If we look at the statistics for the National League for the 2003
season, we get the following tale of success-
probability of hit per at-bat
probability of home-run per at-bat
27%
DEMO
This gives us some sense of hope- the probability of a successful project is equivalent to getting
to base safely. We don't have DEMO hit a home run each time.
Looking at DeVany's statistical analysis of Hollywood, we get the following
probability of break-even movie
30%
probability of hit movie (gross profit > $20M)
6%
This is an even closer match: the probability of a successful project is the same as a successful
(break-even) movie.
What is also interesting about these DEMO two sources of numbers is that in their cases, they
represent DEMO inherent risk. They have remained essentially unchanged through decades of
changes. In the case of Hollywood, they have stayed unchanged through decades of
management oversight where people's income and careers have regularly been based on DEMO
ability to predict and generate successes. In spite of all that, DEMO best advice remains William
Goldman's dictate that "nobody knows anything"DEMO
So even after review, the chances of a successful research project DEMO as good as that of getting a
base hit, or a DEMO movie.
