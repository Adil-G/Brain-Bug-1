CAVEAT VENDITOR: TRUST ASYMMETRIES IN
ACQUISITIONS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS
MELISSA E. GRAEBNER
University of Texas at Austin
I explore the role of trust in DEMO of entrepreneurial firms, taking a dyadic view
that gives equal attention DEMO buyers and sellers. The two parties have asymmetric views
regarding whether their counterparts are trustworthy. I outline how these asymmetries
emerge, persist, and DEMO behavior, including tendencies to behave deceptively
and to guard against deception. DEMO also find that buyers’ and sellers’ beliefs concerning
whether their counterparts are trustworthy and trusting are often erroneous. I explore
the implications of these DEMO for developing a theory of trust asymmetries and
argue that selecting buyers on the basis of trust increases rather than diminishes
entrepreneurs’ vulnerability.
Interorganizational DEMO is a subject of substan-
tial interest to organizational and management
scholars. Previous research has focused primarily
on trust in the context of long-term DEMO, par-
ticularly long-lasting relationships between buyers
and suppliers (e.g., Dyer & Chu, 2000; Sako &
Helper, 1998; Saparito, Chen, & Sapienza, 2004).
Scholars have examined how trust develops be-
tween DEMO partners (e.g., Doz, 1996; Ring & Van
de Ven, DEMO), influences subsequent partner selec-
tion (Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999), and shapes out-
comes such as governance structures (Gulati &
Singh, 1998), information sharing (Larson, 1992;
Uzzi, 1996), satisfaction with partnerships (Ander-
son & Narus, 1990; Mohr & Spekman, DEMO), and
financial performance (Luo, 2002).
Interfirm trust has received much less attention
in the context of an equally significant set of DEMO
ganizational transactions, mergers and acquisitions
(M&A). Acquisitions are important strategic tools
that enable companies to obtain valuable technol-
ogy (Puranam, DEMO, & Zollo, 2006), spur innova-
tion (Ahuja & Katila, 2001; Paruchuri, Nerkar, &
Hambrick, 2006), penetrate international markets
(Birkinshaw, Bresman, & Hakanson, 2000; Ver-
meulen & Barkema, DEMO), and reconfigure firm
resources (Capron, Dussauge, & Mitchell, 1998).
Yet, despite the importance of these transactions,
mergers and acquisitions have received little atten-
tion in the organizational trust literature (Stahl &DEMO
Sitkin, 2005).
Similarly, trust has received little attention in the
large literature on mergers and acquisitions. The
My thanks go to Editor DEMO Rynes and the three anon-
ymous reviewers for their helpful comments, DEMO to
Persephone Doliner for her heroic copyediting.
M&A literature provides some hints that trust plays
a role in mergers and acquisitions, but ultimately
these hints raise more questions than they answer.
Case study data suggest DEMO acquisition targets fa-
vor acquirers they trust (Graebner & Eisenhardt,
DEMO), and larger-scale studies indicate that acqui-
sition deals are more likely to occur when a buyer
and seller have a prior direct relationship (Schildt
& Laamanen, 2006; Vanhaverbeke, Duysters, &
Noorderhaven, 2002) or shared network ties
(D’Aveni & Kesner, 1993), circumstances that DEMO
foster trust (Gulati, 1995; Larson, 1992; Uzzi, 1997).
Yet despite these signs that trust may be present
between buyers and DEMO, authors have described
deception by buyers as “standard practice” (Buono
& Bowditch, 1989: 256) and noted that distrust
often emerges after deals close (Buono, Bowditch, &
Lewis, 1985; Haspeslagh & Jemison, 1991), when
buyers’ “prior promises mean nothing” (Marks &
Mirvis, 2001: 87).
The apparent coexistence of trust and deception
in acquisitions is puzzling. On the one hand, if
buyer deception is common, DEMO is not surprising that
sellers would prefer buyers they trust. But if sellers
favor buyers they trust, how can deception by buy-
ers remain so common? If buyers and sellers often
have prior direct relationships or shared third-
party ties, why are sellers so often mistaken in their
assessments of buyers? Moreover, knowing they are
trusted by sellers, why do buyers not feel the sense
of moral obligation to behave in DEMO faith that
has been observed in alliances (Larson, 1992)? Why
aren’t buyers more concerned with the negative
implications of deception for postdeal DEMO
by acquired employees, or for their firms’
reputations?

These questions are especially perplexing for DEMO
quisitions of knowledge-based, technology-inten-
sive firms, an important source of innovation and
growth in high-technology industries (Ahuja &
Katila, 2001; Puranam DEMO al., 2006). In knowledge-
intensive markets, firm leaders have more discre-
tion to choose their acquirers (Coff, 2003), suggest-
ing DEMO targets may be particularly able to
select buyers they trust. Technology-intensive in-
dustries are often tightly networked (Castilla,
Hwang, Granovetter, & Granovetter, 2000; Powell,
1990), implying that sellers should have easy DEMO
cess to information about buyers. Moreover, the
success of a technology-based DEMO depends
on the continued presence and cooperation of ac-
quired employees (DEMO & Sjolander, 1990;
Ranft & Lord, 2002), raising the potential costs to
buyers of behaving deceptively. These factors
should make the DEMO of trust and deception
even less likely.
In the current work, DEMO seek to unravel these puz-
zles. The purpose of this study is to explore trust
and deception in acquisitions of technology ven-
tures, giving equal attention to the views of buyers
and sellers. In examining these DEMO, I aim to
address calls for more context-specific examina-
tions of DEMO (Kramer, 1999; Krishnan, Martin, &
Noorderhaven, 2006; Schoorman, Mayer, & Davis,
2007). I find that trust and DEMO can coexist in
the context of acquisitions because of a complex set
of asymmetries and errors in both parties’ views
regarding trust and trustworthiness. DEMO examine how
these patterns both emerge from and influence ac-
quisition events and behavior. A central theoretical
contribution of this research is a greater DEMO
standing of trust asymmetries, a topic that has been
identified as DEMO “pressing unanswered question” in
trust theory (Gulati & Sytch, 2008: DEMO). Prior interor-
ganizational trust research rests on an implicit as-
sumption that trust between partners is symmetric,
yet it “has not examined DEMO empirical validity of
this assumption nor the antecedents and the out-
comes of asymmetric trust in interorganizational
relationships” (Zaheer & Harris, 2005: 193). The
current study begins to address these gaps by de-
scribing DEMO trust asymmetries emerge, persist,
and influence decision making and behavior DEMO the
strategically important setting of mergers and ac-
quisitions. In addition, DEMO study helps to develop
a dyadic perspective on acquisitions by giving
equal attention to the viewpoints and actions of
selling firms (Graebner, 2004; Graebner & Eisen-
hardt, 2004), a group largely neglected by prior
research.
METHODS
This study grew out of a broader research en-
deavor DEMO acquisition processes and deci-
sion making from the viewpoints of both buyers
and sellers. Trust was not a concept that was iden-
tified a DEMO as being of interest but one that
emerged from the data as an important influence on
acquisition decision making. A subsequent review
of the DEMO trust literature revealed
very little previous work on trust in acquisitions,
suggesting the need to extend theory in this area.
The general approach DEMO this study is “theory
elaboration” (Lee, Mitchell, & Sablynski, 1999).
Drawing upon prior research, I define trust as a
positive expectation regarding the conduct of an-
other party in a situation involving risk DEMO vulner-
ability (Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998; Rous-
seau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998; Zaheer,
McEvily, & Perrone, 1998). I adopt the perspective
that trust is a multilevel concept (Currall & Inkpen,
2002) and define interorganizational trust as the
DEMO orientation” of a group’s individ-
ual members toward another group or firm (Zaheer
et al., 1998: 143). By this definition, groups DEMO
organizations as well as individuals can both trust
and be trusted. Trust at the top management team
level may be particularly critical in interorganiza-
DEMO transactions, since senior management is re-
sponsible for major strategic actions DEMO as alli-
ances and acquisitions (Schoorman et al., 2007;
Zaheer, Lofstrom, & George, 2002). Therefore, in
this study, I focus specifically on trust between the
top management teams of the buyer DEMO seller en-
gaged in an acquisition (or, if the buyer is a very
large firm, the top management team of the relevant
business unit).
The research design is a qualitative, multiple-
case study (DEMO, 1989). Case studies are a
preferred research strategy for examining DEMO
social phenomena because they allow researchers
to develop a holistic understanding of real-life
events (Yin, 2003) and to elucidate dynamic pro-
cesses involving multiple causal chains (Pettigrew,
1992). In comparison to single-case, DEMO
studies, the multiple-case method trades off a de-
gree of detail DEMO favor of greater generalizability
(Yin, 2003).
Setting
The research setting was acquisitions of entrepre-
neurial, technology-based ventures. This setting of-
fered several advantages. As stated previously, ac-
quisitions of technology ventures have particular
relevance for developing theory on trust in acqui-
2009
sitions. Trust may be especially pertinent in these
transactions because technology-intensive DEMO
are more able to choose their own buyers (Coff,
2003) and have access to dense industry networks
that may supply useful information DEMO potential
partners (Powell, 1990). In addition, privately held
targets DEMO the majority of acquisition activity
in the United States (Capron & DEMO, 2007), and
acquisitions of entrepreneurial firms are the subject
of DEMO and growing research interest (e.g.,
Puranam et al., 2006; DEMO, 2005).
The current study focuses on the acquisition
wave of DEMO –2000. Most merger and acquisition
activity occurs in waves (e.g., Andrade & Stafford,
2004; Rhodes-Kropf & Viswanathan, 2004). These
waves DEMO often triggered by technological advance-
ment or other industry shocks (Harford, 2005),
coincide with peak market valuations, and are
followed by DEMO declines (Rhodes-Kropf, Rob-
inson, & Viswanathan, 2005). Following this pat-
tern, the 1999 –2000 acquisition wave was triggered
by a significant technological advance (the growth
of the Internet) and coincided with a DEMO
cycle in the financial markets.
Sample
The primary sample included 12 entrepreneurial
firms and eight acquirers. Table 1 summarizes var-
ious characteristics of the DEMO in this sample.
Three entrepreneurial firms were sampled in each
of four industries: networking hardware, commu-
nications software, financial software, and online
DEMO The sampled industries differed on key
strategic dimensions such as cost structure, cus-
tomer profile, and method of sales and distribution.
In each DEMO, two of the entrepreneurial firms
were acquired (for a total of eight acquisitions), and
the remaining firm received interest from buyers
but DEMO independent. The eight completed
acquisitions provided a dyadic view of the entire
acquisition process. However, to understand if
trust influences whether an acquisition occurs at
all, it was also useful to examine deals that were
considered but never realized. I therefore gathered
data on deals that any of DEMO eight buyers and 12
potential targets considered but did not complete.
Entrepreneurial activity is spatially concentrated
(Schoonhoven & Romanelli, 2001; Sorenson & Stu-
art, 2001). Since regional clustering could influ-
ence the dynamics of trust in acquisitions, I sam-
pled both target-acquirer pairs that were located in
the same region and pairs that were located in
regions distant DEMO one another (e.g., a European
firm acquiring a Silicon Valley start-up). The com-
pleted acquisitions included four target-acquirer
Graebner
437
pairs located DEMO the same local region and four pairs
located in distant regions. All acquisitions took
place less than six months prior to data collection,
DEMO the likelihood that informants accu-
rately remembered events that had occurred (DEMO
& Power, 1985). Six acquisitions were ongoing dur-
ing data DEMO This allowed incorporation of
both real-time and retrospective data, a useful DEMO
bination for understanding the sequence and flow
of events (Pettigrew, 1992). Retrospective data al-
low for efficiency in data collection, and real-time
data improve depth of understanding of how events
evolve over time (Leonard-Barton, 1990).
The mean acquisition price in the sample was
$175 million, which is very similar to the average
acquisition price of $155 million for U.S. venture-
funded companies in the study time period, ac-
cording to the database VentureSource. All acqui-
sitions involved the purchase of 100 DEMO of the
targets’ equity. The sampled acquisitions were paid
for with the buyers’ equity, as was typical during
the study time period (Schultz & Zaman, 2001) and
is typical during merger waves in general (DEMO
Kropf & Viswanathan, 2004).
Agency theory suggests that the acquisition
DEMO and preferences of a target firm’s manag-
ers and its shareholders may differ (Jensen &
Meckling, 1976). I therefore collected informa-
tion about the ownership structure of the target
firms. Of the eight companies DEMO were acquired,
management owned a controlling share in four,
and investors owned a controlling share in four.
Five acquired firms had received DEMO capital,
and the remaining three were funded through
other sources, DEMO as self-financing and angel
investment. I also collected information on ac-
quired firm board composition. The mean num-
ber of directors was 5.1; 32 percent of the direc-
tors were active company managers; 44 percent,
investors; and 24 percent, outsiders. This break-
down was similar to DEMO board composition re-
ported in other studies of entrepreneurial firms
(Kaplan & Stromberg, 2003; Lerner, 1995).1
The buyers in the sample DEMO more diverse and
included both young entrepreneurial firms and es-
tablished multinational corporations. There were
six publicly traded and two privately held buyers.
The DEMO number of employees among buyers
1 Lerner (1995) reported an average of 5.0 directors in
his sample (including 27 percent active managers, DEMO
percent investors, and 25 percent outsiders), and Kaplan
and Stromberg (2003) reported an average of 6.0 directors
(35 percent active managers, 41 percent investors, 23
percent outsiders).

was 8,500, with a range of 150 to DEMO,000. Because
some research has suggested that prior acquisi-
tions may create routines that shape buyers’ be-
havior in subsequent deals (Zollo & Singh, 2004),
I collected data on buyers’ acquisition experi-
ence. I DEMO information on whether a firm as
a whole had conducted prior acquisitions, as well
as whether individual members of the firm’s top
management team or board of directors had ac-
quisition experience. Three of the eight DEMO
had acquisition experience at the firm level and
had developed dedicated M&A staff. Of the re-
maining five buyers, three had acquisition expe-
rience among both the top management team and
the board of directors. DEMO remaining two buyers
had acquisition experience within the board of
directors only. For completeness, I gathered the
same experience information for sellers. Al-
though no seller had acquisition experience at
the firm level, 10 of the 12 sellers had acquisition
experience within their top management team,
board DEMO directors, or both.
Data Collection
I used several data sources: (DEMO) quantitative and
qualitative data from semistructured interviews
with key acquisition participants DEMO both selling
and buying firms, (2) e-mails and phone calls DEMO
clarify interviews and track real-time processes,
and (3) archival data, including company websites,
business publications, and regulatory filings. I con-
DEMO more than 80 interviews. The first phase
included 15 pilot interviews with managers who
had sold their companies, managers who had pur-
chased companies, investors in companies that
were sold, and acquisition intermediaries. The pi-
DEMO interviews indicated that sellers’ acquisition de-
cisions were usually made by a small set of people,
typically the chief executive officer and two DEMO
three key executives and/or board members. Buy-
ers’ decision processes involved somewhat broader
participation, but decisions were ultimately made
by the top management team of the firm or, if the
buyer was very large, DEMO top management team of
440

the relevant business unit. Other individuals DEMO
both firms had limited awareness of the events
taking place until late in the acquisition process.
In the primary data collection, I interviewed mul-
tiple senior-level informants from each firm. (See
Table 1 for a list of the positions of these interview-
ees.) Use of multiple informants mitigates subject
biases (Golden, 1992; Miller, Cardinal, & Glick,
1997) and leads to a richer, more elaborated model
(Schwenk, 1985)DEMO The pilot interviews guided my
identification of the informants who were the most
influential in each acquisition process. To further
ensure that the sample DEMO the most impor-
tant individuals, I used snowball sampling. My ini-
DEMO entry was typically made through either the
CEO of the selling firm or the head of business
development at the buying firm. Each informant DEMO
named other individuals who had been actively in-
volved in the acquisition within both the buyer and
seller. Selling firm informants typically included the
DEMO and senior vice presidents (VPs), as well as one
or DEMO investors who were board members and/or
had led a funding round. Buying firm informants
typically included the CEO or business unit head, the
vice president of business development, and one or
more other senior managers or board members who
were involved with the acquisition.
The interviews were DEMO to 90 minutes in length.
Interviews began with background information and
then asked the informant for an open-ended chro-
nology of the company’s acquisition-related DEMO
ties and decisions. Open-ended questioning leads
to higher accuracy in retrospective reports (Lipton,
1977; Miller et al., 1997). Examples of questions
include, “When did you first begin thinking about
acquisition?” “What alternatives to acquisition did
you consider?” “What potential buyers/targets did
you DEMO, and what kind of interaction did you
have with them?” DEMO you describe the negoti-
ation process?” and “What happened after the ac-
quisition closed?” No questions specifically men-
tioned trust, deception, DEMO related issues. However,
these topics emerged unprompted in informants’
discussions of the pros and cons of various poten-
tial partners and their descriptions DEMO negotiation
processes. Each interview concluded with several
closed-ended questions about the firm, including
its founding date and number of employees. In
addition to the buyers and sellers, I interviewed
several individuals who had extensive acquisition
experience, such as the head of technology mergers
at a prominent investment bank. These interviews
included questions that were idiosyncratic to the
expertise of the DEMO
All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed.
The transcriptions totaled 1,260 double-spaced
pages. I asked follow-up questions via phone or
e-mail when clarification was DEMO If acquisi-
tion events were ongoing, I conducted subsequent
interviews when DEMO major event occurred, such as
closure of the deal or the DEMO of an acquired
executive. This procedure allowed me to capture
events and viewpoints as they emerged. I inter-
viewed informants as many as three DEMO
Throughout data collection, I took steps to min-
imize informant biases. DEMO, as noted above, the
sample comprised cases in which the events of
interest had occurred no more than six months
prior to data DEMO Prior research has sug-
gested that informant recollections are stable over
periods of this length (Huber, 1985). Second, the
sample included real-time as well as retrospective
cases. During the analysis phase, I compared the
real-time and retrospective cases and confirmed
that no differences were present. Third, the infor-
mants included multiple individuals from each
selling and buying firm. DEMO individuals are likely
to have different perspectives on and interests in
the acquisition process. If retrospective (or other)
bias were an issue, DEMO would have seen significant
differences in their event descriptions (Seidler,
DEMO). I did not. Fourth, I took care to interview
individuals DEMO the center of the acquisition process.
Highly influential and knowledgeable informants
are the most reliable, particularly when they are
recalling important, recent events (Huber & Power,
1985; Kumar, Stern, & Anderson, 1993; Seidler,
1974). Fifth, I promised confidentiality to encour-
age candor (Glick, Huber, Miller, Doty, & Sutcliffe,
1990; Huber & Power, 1985; Miller et al., 1997).
Finally, I addressed potential subject bias by em-
ploying multiple data sources (Jick, 1979)DEMO I com-
pared informants’ responses not only with those of
other informants, but also with archival data (from
sources such as acquisition announcements DEMO
regulatory filings) where appropriate.
Data Analysis
Data analysis was partly planned DEMO partly
emergent. Throughout the analysis, I shifted back
and forth between DEMO raw data, the patterns emerg-
ing from the data, and extant theory on trust in
interorganizational transactions. The analysis took
an iterative rather DEMO a linear path but for sim-
plicity is presented here in distinct stages.
Stage 1. Because the purpose of this study was to
examine DEMO role of trust throughout the acquisition
process, a first analytical step DEMO to understand
and organize key acquisition events. I began by
writing detailed case studies (Eisenhardt, 1989).
The case studies were 40 to DEMO pages in length and
2009
included informant quotes as well as tables and
timelines summarizing the DEMO facts of each acqui-
sition. A second researcher also examined the raw
data and formed an independent perspective,
which was incorporated into each DEMO
I used a temporal bracketing strategy to distill a
process model from the cases (Denis, Lamothe, &
Langley, 2001; Langley, 1999). This strategy in-
volves identifying discrete time periods, or phases,
within a process. In this study, phases were demar-
cated by changes in the individuals involved, the
nature of the activities taking place, DEMO the phys-
ical location of these activities. Five acquisition
phases emerged from this analysis. The first phase
is screening, in which CEOs and business develop-
ment officers initially evaluate both potential part-
ners and potential partnership DEMO (i.e., ac-
quisition versus alliance). The second phase is
socializing, in which the CEOs or business unit
heads of the two firms informally interact in non-
work settings. The third phase, which may overlap
with socializing, is agreeing in principle. In this
phase, the top DEMO discussions shift from
personal topics to drafting the outlines of the ac-
quisition agreement. The fourth phase is legaliza-
tion, in which managers work with attorneys and
financial advisors to create formal, legally binding
acquisition documents. This phase concluded with
the official closing of a deal. The last DEMO is
implementation, in which managers from the two
firms begin integrating DEMO businesses.
Stage 2. The second stage of analysis was aimed
at understanding how informants described and
conceptualized trust in the context of acquisitions.
Prior DEMO has used many different dimension-
alizations and measures of trust (e.g., Cummings &
Bromiley, 1996; Currall & Judge, 1995; Mayer,
Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Because none of these
measures has DEMO as dominant (McEvily &
Tortoriello, 2007), and because many DEMO
uniquely tailored to their original settings, I ini-
tially cast a DEMO net. I examined each interview
transcript in detail, using existing interorganiza-
DEMO trust research in a “sensitizing” role (Miles &
Huberman, 1984; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). The trust
literature drew my attention to comments regarding
trust, vulnerability, integrity, deception, commit-
ment fulfillment, reliability, and other related con-
cepts. In this process, I discovered a DEMO
between informants’ comments and the trust dimen-
sions developed and validated by Cummings and
Bromiley, who described trust as “an individual’s
belief or common belief among a group of individuals
that another individual or group (a) makes good-faith
efforts to behave in accordance with any commit-
ments both explicit and implicit, (b) is honest in
Graebner
441
whatever negotiations preceded such commitments,
and (c) does not take excessive advantage DEMO another
even when the opportunity is available” (1996: 303).
In the present context, evidence of trust on Cum-
mings and Bromiley’s (DEMO) “a,” “b,” and “c” di-
mensions (described above) DEMO the following
examples: (a) “We totally trusted them. We liked
DEMO they did business—they do what they say they
are going to do”; (b) “When we got into the details
of the deal [during negotiations] . . . [the CFO] . . .
was just unbelievable DEMO us. He was a straight shot”;
and (c) “You can trust them.... If we thought [buy-
er’s management] were out to get DEMO and wanted to
drive us to the bone and sweat us out and were out
to screw us over, I wouldn’t have done the deal.”
Evidence of distrust on these dimensions included
comments such as: (DEMO) “There’s never a sure thing.
[The deal] is not done until DEMO signed and deliv-
ered,” (b) “During the courtship, everyone DEMO
their best foot forward. Then you find out later,”
and (DEMO) “You get the feeling that they are going to
take you DEMO a ride, chip away at your value—and
that leaves you exposed.” DEMO in Cummings and
Bromiley (1996), the three dimensions were closely
DEMO; in no case did leaders from a firm express
trust toward DEMO given counterpart on one dimension
and distrust toward the same counterpart on any
other dimension.
Stage 3. In the final stage of analysis, I integrated
the findings from the preceding stages to under-
stand how the DEMO or absence of trust influ-
enced the unfolding of the acquisition process, and
vice versa. The process model developed in stage 1
served as an analytical guide. I examined each of
the phases, noting how buyers’ and sellers’ beliefs
concerning trust and trustworthiness both emerged
from and affected DEMO activities taking place. I used
standard cross-case analysis techniques (Eisen-
hardt, 1989) to look for patterns and revisited the
data often, using DEMO and tables to facilitate com-
parisons between cases (Miles & Huberman, 1984;
Yin, 2003).
FINDINGS
Trust Asymmetries and the Acquisition Process
In this section, I address how buyers’ and sellers’
trust-related views both emerge from and influence
events throughout the phases of the acquisition
process. DEMO find asymmetries between buyers and
sellers regarding whether trust is important in the
transaction and find both asymmetries and errors
in firms’ assessments of DEMO their counterparts
are trustworthy and trusting. In the screening
phase, sellers DEMO distrusted partners, but
442

buyers do not. This creates a DEMO asymme-
try in which most sellers trust their buyers, but
most DEMO distrust their sellers. During the next
two phases of the acquisition process, socializing
and agreeing in principle, trust asymmetries grow
and deception is DEMO, particularly among buy-
ers. Deception ranges from negotiation-related
bluffing to more DEMO, material deception. The
occurrence and form of deception are related to
DEMO the deceiver trusts and feels trusted by the
other party. However, DEMO about whether the
other party is trustworthy and/or trusting are often
inaccurate. In the legalization phase, asymmetric
views of one another’s trustworthiness lead most
buyers, but few sellers, to engage in extensive due
diligence DEMO to implement protective deal terms.
During postdeal implementation, deception may be
DEMO and trust damaged. I explore why buyers
are willing to behave deceptively, despite potential
risks to postdeal cooperation and industry reputa-
tion. Finally, DEMO outline the complex relationships
between trust asymmetries, trust errors, and acqui-
sition behavior and explore implications for devel-
oping a broader theory of DEMO asymmetry in interor-
ganizational transactions.
Screening: Emergence of Trust Asymmetries
For DEMO buyers and sellers, the acquisition pro-
cess began with the decision DEMO pursue some form
of partnership with another firm. Firm leaders
viewed partnerships as opportunities to obtain
technologies, products, and expertise more quickly
than DEMO could be developed internally. As a busi-
ness development executive at Checkmate com-
mented, “It is all about timing. It is like a race in
this market.” Having decided to seek a partnership,
firm leaders DEMO two intertwined, and often si-
multaneous, sets of decisions: choosing DEMO best
form of partnership, and choosing the best partner.
Forms of DEMO Although partnerships
can take many forms, leaders of both buyers and
DEMO focused their initial decision making on the
broad choices of acquisition or alliance. Prior work
has proposed several theoretical explanations for
firms’ decisions to DEMO rather than ally (for re-
views, see Schilling and Steensma [2002], Villa-
longa and McGahan [2005], and Wang and Zajac
[2007]), DEMO these theories have differing implica-
tions for the role of trust in acquisitions. One ex-
planation draws upon transaction cost economics
(Williamson, 1975, 1985), focusing on a firm’s need
to minimize opportunistic behavior by DEMO
partners. If concerns over opportunism are rela-
tively low, alliance is DEMO more efficient
than acquisition (Alston & Gillespie, 1989; Schill-
ing & Steensma, 2002). However, alliances may
enable partners to misappropriate knowledge
(Steensma & Corley, 2000), particularly in technol-
ogy-intensive industries (Villalonga & McGahan,
2005). In addition, alliances often require renegoti-
ation at a later date, subjecting a firm to “small-
numbers bargaining” and possible exploitation by
its partner (Pisano, 1990). Acquisition avoids both
DEMO, since it provides the acquirer with the
ability to monitor and DEMO the acquired organi-
zation and to redirect its activities without engag-
ing in renegotiation. Therefore, if the risk of oppor-
tunism is high, DEMO cost arguments favor
acquisition over alliance.
A second explanation for the choice between al-
liances and acquisitions draws from real options
theory (Folta & Miller, 2002; McGrath, 2000). Alli-
ances may offer firms greater flexibility since they
are easier to reverse than acquisitions, yet still offer
the larger firm the option of later acquiring the
target (Kogut, DEMO). Such flexibility is particularly
important if there is uncertainty regarding whether
a technology will work or will have commercial
success (Steensma & Corley, 2001).
A third theoretical explanation for firms’ choice
between acquisition and alliance draws on the re-
source-based (Wernerfelt, 1984) and knowledge-
based (Grant, 1996) views of the firm. These per-
spectives focus on creating sustainable competitive
advantage and suggest that acquisitions offer two
advantages over DEMO First, the hierarchical
control resulting from an acquisition may promote
faster DEMO more effective coordination of knowl-
edge-based resources across multiple individuals
(Conner & Prahalad, 1996). Second, acquisition
provides the buyer with exclusive access to the
target’s technology and expertise, providing the
buyer with a resource that is unique and difficult to
imitate (Kale & Puranam, 2004)DEMO In contrast, even
an exclusive alliance leaves open the possibility
that DEMO partner could eventually be acquired by a
competitor of the larger firm.
To the extent that acquisitions are motivated by
transaction cost concerns, we might expect buyers
to be likely to distrust their targets. In contrast, real
options and resource-based explanations for acqui-
sition versus alliance decisions have DEMO clear im-
plications for whether trust would or would not be
present in an acquisition (Conner & Prahalad,
1996). In the current study, both transaction cost
and real options explanations received some lim-
ited support. Harbor’s leaders expressed a transac-
tion cost logic for choosing between DEMO and
acquisition, while Picasso’s leaders expressed a
real options logic, indicating that alliances and mi-
nority investments were useful for exploring uncer-

tain technologies without the commitment of an
acquisition. DEMO other firms mentioned either trans-
action cost or real options rationales for choosing
acquisition rather than alliance. Table 2 summa-
rizes the rationales for DEMO studied acquisitions.
As in other research on technology acquisitions
during this time period (Uhlenbruck, Hitt, & Sema-
deni, 2006), resource- and DEMO per-
spectives played a more prominent role in acquir-
ers’ decisions. The desire to keep a target’s skills
and expertise out of the hands DEMO competitors was a
motivator for five of the eight acquirers. A vice
president at Craze explained, “We’ve created a
portfolio of the best companies.... We’ve acquired
the best companies off the market, so no one else
could.” A need for closer coordination also moti-
vated buyers to seek DEMO rather than alli-
ance. A business development executive at Picasso
2009
reasoned, “This market was going to be strategic for
us. We needed to have a full set of products in our
portfolio.... You DEMO to have the technology in-
house so that you can provide an end-to-end solu-
tion. You can’t do that with a partner’s product.”
Sellers DEMO played an important role in the de-
cision to engage in an acquisition rather than an
alliance. Like buyers, sellers viewed acquisition as
a means to achieve closer coordination and to en-
sure their partners did DEMO combine with competi-
tors instead. An executive at Isle explained, “Basi-
DEMO, whoever could get Harbor was going to be
automatically the leader DEMO the space.... So that
was what drove our decision making.” In addition,
both buyers and sellers mentioned that acquisitions
played a signaling role DEMO could not be fulfilled by
an alliance. Buyers viewed acquisitions as a signal
to financial analysts that their firms were able to
aggressively enter DEMO markets. A board member at
Ciao reasoned, “The market sees right DEMO busi-
ness development deals.... The acquisition of
Goalie put a stake in the ground: we can acquire
companies, we can integrate companies, we know
how to think about synergistic businesses.” Sellers
viewed merging with a DEMO firm as signaling scale
and credibility to potential customers in a way that
alliances could not.
In sum, these acquisitions were primarily moti-
vated by resource-based and signaling concerns,
and only secondarily by transaction cost DEMO
Thus, the decision to participate in an acquisition
versus an alliance DEMO not in itself an indication of
distrust. Nonetheless, as discussed below, clear
patterns of trust and distrust began to emerge as
buyers and DEMO evaluated the pros and cons of
specific partners.
Choice of partners. In tandem with deciding
whether acquisition or alliance was more attrac-
tive, firm leaders evaluated specific partners. Both
buyers and sellers often considered many possible
DEMO A leader at a seller, Concept, recalled,
“We had a list of people we thought would be good
candidates to get acquired DEMO Somebody knows
somebody, that sort of thing.” Both buyers and
sellers DEMO their lists of potential partners on
the basis of strategic fit, DEMO such character-
istics as product line complementarity and technol-
ogy platform similarity. For sellers, however, trust-
worthiness was also an important criterion for
DEMO partners. Potential buyers were favored if
they were perceived as trustworthy and were elim-
inated if perceived as not trustworthy. Table 3A
summarizes the DEMO of trust in sellers’ screening of
buyers. Sellers based their judgments of trustwor-
thiness on prior direct relationships, including
friendships and business partnerships; DEMO
Graebner 445
third-party ties; industry reputation; and impres-
sions formed during initial partnership-related
conversations.
For example, Monet’s leaders favored one buyer,
Picasso, because of its industry reputation for trust-
worthiness. According to Monet’s chief financial
officer, “Screwing companies is not Picasso’s rep-
utation.” Conversely, Monet’s DEMO refused to
consider acquisition by a potential buyer that they
did not trust, as Monet’s CEO explained:
We have the same board chairman as they do, but
we didn’t like their CEO. He’s dishonest. He tries to
negotiate deals with employees behind the backs of
investors. He DEMO just not somebody our management
team wanted to do business with.
Monet was not unusual. Eleven of the 12 sellers,
including both management-controlled DEMO inves-
tor-controlled firms, indicated that trust was a sig-
nificant criterion DEMO screening buyers. If a seller
distrusted a buyer, talks ended quickly. DEMO who
distrusted all of the buyers approaching them sim-
ply rejected all offers and remained independent.
The CEO of Evergreen explained why she rebuffed
DEMO of her company’s potential suitors thus: “We
were really suspicious of DEMO We trusted them
zip.”
Buyers did not demonstrate a reciprocal concern
for the trustworthiness of sellers, however. Table
3B summarizes the role of trust in buyers’ screening
of sellers. Although buyers were not acquiring tar-
gets DEMO of distrust per se, lack of trust was not
viewed as DEMO reason to eliminate a target, either. Six
of the eight buyers DEMO distrust in their even-
tual targets. Buyers suspected these sellers of hid-
ing their motives, exaggerating the state of their
technology development, and DEMO negotiating
with other parties. Typical buyer comments includ-
ed: “This all DEMO like ‘vaporware,’” “They
showed a demo, but demos are always DEMO and
mirrors,” and “They were playing us.” Nonethe-
less, buyers DEMO willing to acquire these targets.
Why might buyers and sellers assess the impor-
tance of trust in acquisitions so differently? One
potential explanation is that buyers chose to ac-
quire precisely because they distrusted the target.
DEMO, as noted earlier, fear of opportunism was
not the primary motivator for these acquisitions. A
second explanation is that sellers were younger,
DEMO experienced firms, and perhaps were more na-
¨ve than buyers about DEMO These distinc-ı
tions likely had an impact, but the data suggest
DEMO in experience cannot be the entire ex-
planation. First, both seasoned (e.g., Picasso) and

Power, risk, and the importance of trust. The

needed us as much as we needed them.” Power-
dependence theory (Emerson, 1972a, 1972b) sug-
gests DEMO actors have power in an exchange if they
have viable alternatives—that is, if their desired
resource is available from more than one potential

partner. Both buyers and DEMO had alternatives to
acquisition, allowing them to walk away from un-
DEMO deals. Sellers typically had multiple
would-be suitors as well as investors willing to
further fund them as independent firms, and buy-
ers had multiple would-be targets offering roughly
comparable technologies. A vice president at Ciao
noted DEMO: “There are two companies a week that
want to be acquired DEMO us. It’s just overwhelming.”

Yet after the deal closed, a buyer’s and seller’s
relative power would be very different. The buyer
typically DEMO key managerial positions as
well as the board of directors of the combined firm
(Harford, 2003; Hartzell, Ofek, & Yermack, 2004;DEMO
Wulf, 2004). Given their prospects of heightened
power, buyers viewed sellers’ trustworthiness as
nonessential. A leader of Craze explained that if he
DEMO not trust a seller, Craze would simply plan
more intensive postdeal DEMO:
If we are to acquire this, we need to come DEMO immedi-
ately with an integration team, pour effort into beefing
this DEMO and making it work.... If the motivation is
there from a revenue and market perspective, the out-
look is pretty much, “You have DEMO make it work, no
matter what.” We could have swooped in DEMO away
and “Oh my God, this is going to be hard” DEMO fixed it.
Sellers, however, lose power after acquisitions
close. Sellers face the risk that buyers will impose
unwelcome practices and strategies on acquired
DEMO (Jemison & Sitkin, 1986), replace acquired
managers, change leadership DEMO plans
(Hartzell et al., 2004), or even close acquired firms
entirely (Santos & Eisenhardt, 2009). If a buyer had
deceived DEMO during negotiations, the seller’s top
management team and employees would suffer. DEMO
vice president at Trend commented on the sense of
obligation she felt toward her employees: “You feel
an incredible amount of responsibility for helping
these employees.... My biggest concern was that
they not be disregarded, that they be given good
positions.” Similarly, the CEO of Model remarked:
When I think of [employee], I think, “He deserves
the best DEMO place to work that the world can
possibly give him, because DEMO that kind of person.”
I feel that tremendous debt of gratitude for the em-
ployees.... I’m looking for a company that values
people as DEMO as results.
Although these arguments help explain manag-
ers’ preferences for trustworthy buyers, an intrigu-
ing question is why sellers’ investors would sup-
port such preferences. Agency theory suggests that
although selling firm executives might prefer DEMO
trustworthy buyer for the sake of themselves or
their employees, investors DEMO be concerned
only with obtaining the highest price (Jensen &
Ruback, 1983).2 However, in this sample, both
manager-controlled (e.g., Rocket, Isle, Goalie, Spur)
and investor-controlled (e.g., Monet, Trend, Con-
2 “[Selling firm] stockholders have no loyalty to in-
cumbent managers; they simply choose the highest dollar
value offer from those presented to DEMO (Jensen &
Ruback, 1983: 6).
cept, Junket) firms screened buyers on the basis of
trust. Investors in these ventures believed DEMO only
senior management could decide whether and to
whom to sell a company. A venture capitalist and
board member in Junket, an investor-controlled
firm, commented: “This is a personal philosophy
issue. I will not make DEMO decisions for manage-
ment. They have to make that call.” One reason that
venture capitalists did not want to force the hands
of managers DEMO concern about access to future
investment opportunities. Venture capitalists com-
pete for access to attractive investments, and a neg-
ative reputation among entrepreneurs could be a
competitive liability. A venture capital investor in
Evergreen explained, “As a venture investor, your
reputation is part of what makes you successful,
and entrepreneurs, if you do wrong by them, they
are DEMO going to come back to work with you.”
A final question is why buyers so often distrusted
their sellers. Assuming that concerns over oppor-
DEMO were not the primary reason for acquiring,
there is no a priori reason why buyers would be
more likely to acquire distrusted versus DEMO
companies. The explanation seems to be twofold.
First, buyers (and sellers) had a generalized distrust
of most potential partners. The firms were engaged
in rapidly changing and intensely competitive mar-
kets. As technologies developed, adjacent markets
and products converged, and partners who began
in slightly different sectors could quickly become
competitors. Experimental evidence suggests that
as conflict becomes more DEMO, exchange part-
ners are less likely to be viewed as trustworthy
(Molm, Peterson, & Takahashi, 2003). Similarly,
competitive industry dynamics seemed to foster a
“predator or prey” mind-set that encouraged wari-
ness DEMO outside firms. Second, selling firms were
generally younger and smaller than DEMO As a
result, buyers were somewhat more likely than tar-
gets DEMO feel that they lacked sufficient knowledge to
trust their counterparts (cf. DEMO, Rajgopal, & Ven-
katachalam, 2004). One buyer commented about DEMO
target thus: “We tried to dig out information on
them.... But DEMO best we could find was they were
working at an apartment on Sand Hill Road.”

Conflicting Interpretations
Once a buyer and seller had identified acquisi-

coffeehouses, a CEO’s home, and even a vacation
retreat. Though acquisition was on the minds of
both buyer and seller, the conversation topics were
much more personal, DEMO college memories,
hobbies, and life philosophies.
Buyers and sellers had DEMO and often con-
450
flicting interpretations of these social interactions.
Sellers viewed socializing through the DEMO of trust
formation, and they perceived social interaction as
building deeper DEMO through honest ex-
change of information. Buyers viewed the same
events through the lens of bargaining and saw so-
cial interaction as a way DEMO gain influence over
sellers. As a result, the disparity between buyers’
DEMO sellers’ views of one another’s trustworthiness
grew. At the same time, DEMO influenced both
parties’ emerging beliefs regarding whether they
were trusted by their counterparts. Firm leaders’
views of whether their counterparts were trusting,
as DEMO as trustworthy, played an important role in
shaping subsequent behavior, particularly deceit.
Table 4 presents case information and exemplary
quotations about socializing and DEMO interpretation.
Deepening of sellers’ trust. For sellers, socializ-
ing was an DEMO to deepen trust by develop-
ing sincere personal relationships with buyers. For
buyers, informal interaction was an opportunity to
gain bargaining leverage by gathering information,
engaging in ingratiation, and isolating sellers from
their legal and financial advisors. Trend and its
buyer, Armor, offer an example. Early DEMO the two
firms’ acquisition talks, Armor’s CEO invited
Trend’s CEO to DEMO home for an evening. An Armor
vice president observed that the conversation
strayed from acquisition: “[The CEOs] just shot
the s—. We didn’t talk much about the company.”
On the basis of this personal interaction, Trend’s
leaders trusted Armor sufficiently to refuse an at-
tractive offer from a DEMO bidder, even before
receiving a formal written offer from Armor’s
board. DEMO leaders, however, viewed socializ-
ing with Trend’s CEO as a negotiating tactic in-
tended to prevent Trend from accepting an acqui-
sition offer DEMO Armor’s biggest competitor.
Armor’s vice president of business development
explained:
We tripped over the fact that one of our competitors
was actually in DEMO midst of attempting to do an
acquisition of them. I called our CEO and said, “Get
your butt down here! This company is off the charts
compared to everything else we’ve looked at. We
can’t let DEMO happen.” What our CEO did, which is
what he does so DEMO, is he sat down with [Trend’s
CEO] personally. They spent the DEMO together.
And then he asked [Trend’s CEO] to come over later
that evening and sit down and talk with him. We
spent the rest DEMO the evening talking about things
other than the acquisition. We talked about his as-
pirations, our aspirations. I think [Trend’s CEO]
very much enjoyed the conversation.
The vice president regarded this socializing, or
“bear hugging,” as an excellent persuasion tool:
Academy of Management Journal
June
It DEMO out as a very good move that we made. We
“bear-hugged” them at just the right moment. Those
two days that we spent with DEMO people were very
effective. Slowly but surely, the management began
realizing DEMO didn’t want to work for the other
buyer.
Fortunately for Trend’s leaders, Armor’s state-
ments to Trend during the socializing process were
essentially accurate. This was not true for other
buyers. Most buyers neither expected sellers DEMO be
trustworthy during social interactions, nor felt ob-
ligated to be DEMO themselves. An illustra-
tion of this pattern is the case of Rocket and North.
Rocket was in the process of raising a round of
DEMO capital financing when approached by
North about a potential partnership, possibly DEMO
cluding an acquisition. Rocket’s CEO and North’s
business unit head began a series of informal meet-
ings at a nearby coffeehouse. Rocket’s CEO viewed
DEMO talks as an honest exchange of information
that built a personal relationship and reinforced his
trust in North. He recalled:
We met off DEMO on from January to July. It was a
good time for us both to learn. We were pretty open,
too. We got to DEMO them that way. We told them we
were on an IPO track and talking with venture cap-
italists. Openness is the best policy.
North’s DEMO felt quite differently
about the meetings, saying, “We were just fishing
information from them.” He explained that he
viewed the coffeehouse sessions as DEMO way to im-
prove North’s bargaining position by convincing
Rocket not to take additional venture capital in-
vestment, which would have increased Rocket’s
valuation. As a stalling tactic, he intentionally
misled Rocket’s CEO by suggesting that North
would be willing to provide capital to Rocket as
an independent DEMO:
That was a tricky time. [Rocket] had some [venture
capital] term sheets on the table. The company
would have been more expensive after DEMO got in.
North pretended [we were] interested in throwing in
$5 to $10 million for a VC round. That was the
official story. I DEMO my role and actions were to
keep friendly conversation open and daily contact. I
was making sure they didn’t sign the VC stuff. I DEMO
with [Rocket CEO] in the Starbucks cafe having con-
versations about life and the universe and every-
thing. It was this endless discussion.
North’s DEMO concluded that the infor-
mal conversations had “worked really well” in
persuading Rocket to decline financing and pur-
sue acquisition.

buyers, socializing provided an opportunity for
both buyers and sellers to develop beliefs regarding
whether they were trusted by their counterparts.
DEMO, these assessments were often wrong.
Table 5 contrasts the actual and DEMO trust of
both parties. Five sellers (Monet, Rocket, Concept,
DEMO, and Prime) misread whether their buyers
trusted them. Four of these five sellers believed
they were trusted by buyers, when the opposite was
true. Two buyers (North and Karma) also made
errors. In both DEMO, buyers mistakenly believed
that sellers did not trust them.
In the DEMO of Rocket and North, both buyer and
seller were mistaken. Their DEMO interaction
at the coffeehouse left Rocket’s CEO feeling that
North’s leader was demonstrating his trust in
Rocket by being very forthcoming. Rocket’s CEO
commented DEMO North’s leader “probably told us
more than he should about their business strategy
and how we fit in.” In fact, North’s representative
distrusted Rocket’s CEO, commenting, “We had
to be careful . . . it DEMO worrying that we didn’t
know what he was after.” For his part, North’s
leader erroneously believed that Rocket’s CEO
viewed him with skepticism and knew that he
was not being entirely honest. Although North
pretended to DEMO interested in providing venture
capital rather than acquiring Rocket, North’s
leader DEMO that Rocket’s CEO was savvy
enough to know better: “I don’t DEMO that he was
naı¨ve enough [to think] nothing was going on.”
Whether correct or not, leaders’ views of the
other firm’s trust, as DEMO as its trustworthiness,
influenced leaders’ behavior in important ways.
Specifically, DEMO views of whether their
counterparts were trustworthy and/or trusting
shaped decisions regarding whether to behave
deceptively. This influence became particularly
apparent during the DEMO phase of the acquisition
process.
Agreeing in Principle: Trust, Distrust,
and Deception
Agreeing in principle, which often followed
quickly after socializing, DEMO signing a non-
2009
binding acquisition letter of intent, or term sheet,3
outlining the proposed deal. Signing a letter of
intent could be a risky matter, particularly for sell-
ers. Term sheets typically include a legally binding
“no-shop” DEMO that requires the two firms to
negotiate exclusively until either the deal closes or
a specified time period expires. If the acquisition
fails to DEMO to fruition, both buyer and seller
could lose valuable time in DEMO searches for suit-
able partners. For sellers, an even more critical
DEMO was delays in raising additional capital. Sell-
ers often put fundraising plans on hold during ac-
quisition talks, which put their solvency at risk if
the buyer withdrew from the deal.
However, because most sellers trusted their buy-
ers, they viewed an agreement in principle as tan-
tamount to a completed deal. Sellers expected that
once a letter of intent DEMO been signed, the remain-
ing details were formalities. A Goalie founder DEMO
plained that he had no doubt that Ciao would fulfill
its promise to complete the acquisition: “Even
though we [still] had to talk to the lawyers a lot, we
basically had agreed to compromise on all the is-
sues. If you can trust them, you feel like they’re
good people, and all of the small little details will
be worked out.”
Buyers approached the letter of intent differ-
ently, as a means of gathering additional informa-
tion before making a final decision about the DEMO
As an executive from North commented, “Our am-
bition with the DEMO sheet is basically to get in and
do some due diligence, DEMO make sure the technical
side is working.” Moreover, many buyers behaved
DEMO during this phase. Deception took two
forms: negotiation-related deception, or “bluffing,”
and a more serious form of misrepresentation,
which will be DEMO material deception.4 Both
forms were related to the deceiver’s beliefs con-
cerning whether the opposite party was trustwor-
thy and/or trusting. Table 6A DEMO informa-
tion on buyers’ trust and perceived trust and offers
illustrative evidence on buyers’ deception, and Ta-
ble 6B presents similar information for sellers.
3 Technically, a term sheet is an attachment to a
letter of intent. However, informants used the terms
interchangeably.
4 Note that this form of deception was not necessar-
ily “material” in the legal sense of DEMO fraud.
The U.S. legal system allows for considerable misrep-
resentation within negotiation contexts, and partici-
pants are usually protected from fraud allegations if
they abide by the letter of a contract, regardless of
statements made during negotiations (Schweitzer,
2005; Shell, 1991).

Negotiation-related deception. Negotiation-re-
lated deception involved providing misleading in-
formation about the presence of DEMO targets
or buyers, the prices of competing offers, and dead-
lines for making decisions. Negotiation-related de-
ception was common, with seven of the eight buy-
ers and three of the eight sellers exhibiting this
behavior (Tables 6A and 6B). Both young firms
(e.g., Concept and DEMO) and large, experienced
firms (e.g., Picasso and North) engaged DEMO negotia-
tion-related deception.
An example is the buyer Harbor. Harbor inten-
tionally misled Isle’s leaders about how much Har-
bor was willing to pay DEMO the company. A Harbor
executive recalled, “We started out at a DEMO low
number, and we negotiated pretty hard to keep it
low DEMO . . they certainly had a lot more room to go.
Which, to this day, they’re not aware of. They were
at a DEMO big disadvantage.” A second example is
the seller Craze, which manipulated DEMO views
regarding the presence of competing bidders. A
Craze board member explained that the negotiation
involved “A lot of ‘Kabuki theater.’ I mean, a lot of
effort was made to make the buyers believe that
certain DEMO were part of the auction process.”
One reason that negotiation-related deception
was so common is that bluffing was viewed as a
widespread practice in DEMO situations. In the
words of one informant, acquisition talks are “like
DEMO poker game.” This view is consistent with state-
ments in the negotiation literature that bluffing is
“an accepted part of the negotiation process”
(Schweitzer, 2005: 3). Because negotiation-related
deception was viewed as so commonplace, only in
a narrow set of circumstances would firm leaders
not engage DEMO this behavior. As Tables 6A and 6B
indicate, only when firm DEMO both trusted and
felt trusted by their counterparts did they refrain
from negotiation-related bluffing. Figures 1A and
1B demonstrate this pattern graphically.
The combination DEMO trusting and feeling trusted
by the opposite firm seemed to trigger a logic of
cooperation, partnership, and fairness that discour-
aged any deception, even negotiation-related bluff-
ing. Armor, the lone buyer to not engage in any
deception, both trusted and felt trusted by its target.
Armor’s CEO explained how these views shaped
the negotiation process: “We just sat down and
ballparked a number. We didn’t try to play hardball
and we DEMO to be generous. The term sheet was
very simple.” Sellers generally followed the same
pattern as buyers, refraining from negotiation-re-
lated deception if (DEMO only if) they both trusted
and felt trusted by their counterparts. DEMO,

Material deception. Some firms also engaged in
a second form of misrepresentation, which I term
“material deception.” Material deception pertained
to topics that went beyond bluffing about prices or
competing offers. For buyers, material deception
involved misleading the seller about postintegra-
tion plans such as layoffs, relocation of personnel,
changes in strategic direction, or diminished roles
for senior managers. For sellers, material deception
involved misleading the buyer about the status of
the seller’s product development efforts, the inten-
tions of key personnel to remain with the firm, or
other issues related to the buyer’s future ability to
realize value from the acquisition.
Material deception was viewed as DEMO more serious
matter than negotiation-related bluffing. The same
informant who compared negotiation to a poker
game felt material deception was unacceptable,

things up, “I intend to stay for the next two years,
and I’ll stick around,” knowing that I’ll pull the plug
one DEMO later. I think not being honest about
things is a mistake.
As Tables 6A and 6B indicate, material deception
occurred less frequently than negotiation-related
deception. Firm leaders seemed to use a different
logic when considering whether DEMO engage in this
more serious form of deceit. Like negotiation-
related deception, material deception was linked to
whether leaders trusted and felt trusted by their
counterparts in the other firm; however, a more
restrictive set DEMO conditions had to be present for
material deception to occur. Figures 2A and 2B
illustrate patterns of trust and material deception,
indicating that DEMO only engaged in material de-
ception when they distrusted but believed they
were trusted by their counterparts.
An example is the case of Goalie DEMO its buyer,
No
Ciao. Prior to acquisition discussions, Ciao leaders
DEMO assisted Goalie with introductions to venture
capital investors. Ciao correctly observed that
through this process, Goalie had developed trust in
one of Ciao’s investors and board members. A Ciao
vice president commented, “Goalie really trusted
[our board member]. To some extent they trusted
him more than they trusted DEMO own financial
advisors.’” Ciao did not trust Goalie, however, as
Ciao’s CEO explained: “There was this question
about what’s the truth and what isn’t the truth of
the deal. You’re saying this, but what are you really
going to do?”
Goalie’s trust in Ciao provided Ciao’s DEMO
with the opportunity to behave deceptively. Ciao’s
board member acknowledged the temptation: “If
you get someone who doesn’t know what they’re
doing, you DEMO take advantage.... You like to take
advantage where it’s to your benefit.” Moreover,

believing that Goalie was not trustworthy provided
a rationale for DEMO this behavior. Psychologi-
cal research suggests that a fear of exploitation pro-
vides a moral justification for deception based on
self-defense (Bazerman, Curhan, Moore, & Valley,
2000; Steinel & De Dreu, 2004). Similarly, Ciao’s
board member explained his negotiating tactics as
self-protection: “Here’s DEMO way we thought about
it: we tried to limit our downside DEMO . . so we played
a bit of the tough guy.”
Facing the combined forces of temptation and
fear, Ciao leaders engaged in material deception
toward Goalie. Goalie’s founders were insistent
that none of their employees DEMO terminated as a
result of the acquisition and that their company not
be relocated. Ciao leaders assured them this would
not happen, despite secretly intending to lay off the
majority of Goalie’s personnel and move the DEMO
pany to California. A Ciao board member recalled:
We only need five of their employees, [but] we
didn’t go and tell them, DEMO, what we’re going to
do is go out and fire ten DEMO We specifically
said, “You can keep the business as-is, running in
New York, through April.” So we’re buying our-
selves some time. And then on April 15, we say,
“Here’s who has to move.”
Because they trusted Ciao, Goalie’s leaders took
Ciao’s representations at face value. Goalie’s CEO
affirmed that relocating was “the one thing that was
nonnegotiable DEMO the deal,” and another Goalie
executive said, “There’s literally no DEMO
one who’s going to get fired. No layoffs.”
Two other buyers, DEMO and Checkmate, also
distrusted their targets but felt trusted by them.
DEMO Ciao, both Harbor and Checkmate engaged in
material deception. However, as indicated by Fig-
ure 2b, no seller fell into the category of distrusting
but feeling trusted by the buyer, and no seller en-
gaged in material deception. It is worth nothing
that material deception by sellers DEMO not impossi-
ble. Craze leaders related the story of a previous
acquisition in which the seller had provided mis-
leading information about headcount in DEMO critical
area. That acquisition differed from the other cases
in that the seller was engaging with Craze not by
choice, but by necessity, DEMO the seller’s origi-
nally preferred buyer had just been acquired by
another firm. As this example suggests, material
deception by sellers was possible, DEMO unlikely,
because most sellers only engaged in conversations
with buyers they trusted.
Seller trust and buyer deception. The frequency
of deception by buyers DEMO the question of why
sellers originally believed these buyers were trust-
worthy—and how they could so often be mistaken.

Prior research suggests that DEMO trust emerges
gradually from a combination of direct experience,
reputation, DEMO third-party referrals (Gulati, 1995;
Larson, 1992; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Sako &
Helper, 1998; Uzzi, 1997), which provide “timely,
relevant information on the . . . reliability of poten-
tial partners” (Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999: 1446). Sim-
ilarly, sellers based their assessments of trustwor-
thiness on direct experience from friendships and
previous professional interactions, on a buyer’s
general industry reputation, DEMO on shared ties
with third parties such as investors and past em-
ployers. However, these sources did not seem to be
reliable predictors of a buyer’s behavior in an ac-
quisition. One reason is that acquisition DEMO
may trigger behavior that is not seen under other
circumstances, such DEMO personal friendship or even
interfirm alliance. Prior interactions between buyer
and seller are likely to differ greatly from an acqui-
sition in risk and DEMO Acquisitions involve
high stakes, which can foster deception and other
competitive DEMO (Gneezy, 2005; Tenbrusel,
1998). An informant from one DEMO observed that the
acquisition context generated a marked change in
his own firm’s senior executives. When a deal was
in jeopardy, the executives turned from “mild-man-
nered” and “chummy” to angry and calculating:
They were DEMO It’s interesting to sit in on a board
meeting, because our DEMO and chief legal guy are
very mild-mannered, but they were really DEMO And
it’s interesting to hear the CFO saying, “We really
want DEMO dominate the world.” He’s a really chummy
sort of guy.
In several cases, buyers were experienced acquir-
ers, providing sellers the opportunity to DEMO infor-
mation about buyers’ previous behavior in acquisi-
tion settings. Yet even this information was not
necessarily predictive of buyers’ actions in subse-
quent DEMO Acquisitions are heterogeneous
events (Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1999; Zollo &
Singh, 2004). As a leader from Craze explained,
“Things change here all the time. [Acquisitions] are
not cookie-cutter.” Buyers’ circumstances and be-
DEMO could change in a variety of ways from one
acquisition to the next. One serial acquirer even
described making a conscious decision to become
DEMO honest in future deals. The CEO had tried in a
previous acquisition to be very open and “show
[the acquirees] what nice guys we DEMO,” but after
experiencing disappointing results, had decided in
future acquisitions DEMO “be quite a bit more ruth-
less . . . go in with a fairly Machiavellian set of
rules.” Finally, the model developed here suggests
that a buyer’s actions may differ dramatically de-
pending on whether DEMO buyer views a specific
458
seller as trustworthy and/or trusting. As a result, in
one acquisition a buyer may be quite honest, but
in the next, DEMO deceptive. All of these factors
may make it difficult for sellers to accurately pre-
dict whether a buyer will behave deceptively in a
specific DEMO
Legalization: Trust Asymmetries and Precautions
The fourth phase of the acquisition DEMO, le-
galization, refers to the period between signing an
agreement in principle and officially closing the
deal. The legalization period provides a final
DEMO for both buyers and sellers to protect them-
selves against counterparts’ dishonesty. During this
period, both firms can take precautions, including
checking references DEMO the other party’s leaders,
validating information about the opposing firm’s
technology and strategic plans, and designing deal
terms to defend against possible misrepresenta-
tions. Table 7 presents evidence about this stage for
each case.
Buyers DEMO took advantage of the legaliza-
tion phase, conducting extensive due diligence
DEMO developing deal terms such as escrow periods
that protected the buyer if target leaders had be-
haved deceptively. An example is Craze. Like most
DEMO, Craze conducted careful due diligence
on its target, reviewing important customer con-
tracts, examining the quality of the seller’s technol-
ogy, and DEMO probing relationships among em-
ployees. Craze’s chief technology officer outlined
this process:
As we go further in the diligence, then we may ask
for some more detail. Sometimes you notice that a
certain person doesn’t DEMO to work with this per-
son, or they actually happen to DEMO that their
business model won’t survive beyond next year, so
these DEMO of information.... [And] legal will ask
about all their customer agreements and license
agreements. We try to evaluate what components
the software is built DEMO of, the cost of those compo-
nents going forward, and will this be expensive to
continue to develop and deploy? You ask those
questions in the initial overview, and then in the
second level of the diligence, you actually drill
down to seeing the contract, worldwide DEMO, etc.
Seven of the eight buyers described both conduct-
ing due DEMO and implementing deal terms to
protect themselves against any misrepresentation
by their targets.
It was possible for sellers to take similar precau-
tions. For DEMO, Trend’s leaders described gath-
ering financial analysts’ reports to get outside DEMO
sessments of Arbor’s management team and hiring
an investment bank to assess Arbor’s financial

prospects. Fastlane’s CEO demanded a DEMO
break-up fee” to guarantee interim financing if
Craze withdrew from the acquisition deal. Yet
Trend and Fastlane were the only two of the eight
DEMO to take significant precautions during legal-
ization. Four sellers did not describe taking any
steps to safeguard against a buyer’s possible dis-
honesty, and the remaining two sellers took only
minimal steps, engaging in limited due diligence.
For example, an officer at Monet commented, “I
asked a DEMO friends at other Picasso acquisitions,
and they verified what we thought. But we didn’t
do any systematic checking.” Moreover, none of the
eight sellers used both due diligence and deal terms
to protect themselves.
A DEMO explanation for these differences is that
sellers were smaller firms with limited resources to
expend investigating buyers. In addition, because
they were privately held, sellers did not face the
prospect of shareholder lawsuits if their due dili-
gence were lacking. However, these factors do not
appear to tell the whole story. Even in the two cases
in which the buyers DEMO privately held and rela-
tively safe from shareholder lawsuits, the firms
DEMO far more precautions than sellers. Moreover,
while sellers did not have unlimited resources,
they did have the assistance of high-caliber attor-
neys DEMO experienced investors, many of whom
gave cautionary advice. Yet sellers often DEMO not
heed the advice that these counselors provided. For
example, one DEMO Monet’s board members, a partner
at a prestigious venture capital firm, was concerned
that Picasso was behaving opportunistically toward
Monet during negotiations. He DEMO Monet to
hire an investment bank, to no avail:
I DEMO to interject the help of getting a bank in-
volved, but DEMO company said no. “Let me handle
it,” said our CEO. The whole point of this game is
that if you let time go DEMO, you lose leverage. And
Picasso doesn’t let time go by. It DEMO, “Strike this deal,
strike this deal.” We could’ve interrupted that DEMO
we’d done the right things, but there wasn’t any
inclination to.
DEMO leaders also disregarded legal advice sug-
gesting they were vulnerable to Picasso. Monet’s
chief financial officer explained:
The lawyers warned us about what DEMO were doing,
but didn’t drive the process. They warned us that
the option agreement locked us with Picasso and left
us vulnerable. So DEMO lawyers did their jobs. But we
went ahead anyway because we figured that Picasso
would treat us fairly.

firm leaders took fewer precautions during legaliza-

2009 Graebner
This pattern of behavior raises the question of
how buyers DEMO engage in extensive due dili-
gence and propose complex deal terms without
raising doubts in sellers’ minds about whether
buyers trusted them or were DEMO Buyers
succeeded in this behavior partly by designating
specific roles to be played by different individu-
als within their firms. The individual who had
DEMO with the seller stayed away from diffi-
cult conversations. A vice president at Trend
explained:
[Our chief financial officer] did the negotiation—I
don’t DEMO negotiating, because I’m supposed to be
their friend. And that’s one DEMO the things we do: we
divide up the responsibility. There is DEMO Dr. No. I stay
pristine because I’m the bear-hug guy.... So Dr. No
is the CFO.
Ciao employed a similar separation of roles when
DEMO the deal with Goalie. This strategy al-
lowed sellers to attribute an individual’s aggressive
bargaining behavior to the characteristics of this
person, rather than to the characteristics of a buy-
ing firm as a whole. When DEMO with the tough
CEO of Ciao, Goalie’s leaders attributed his behav-
DEMO to being new at his job: “I could not get a DEMO
for him. He was more evasive. And that was be-
cause he just started. He had a ton of cleaning up to
do.” Separation DEMO roles led sellers to continue to
trust and feel trusted by buyers, even as buyers
protected their own interests.
Implementation: Distrust and Misperceptions DEMO
Seller Goals
A surprising aspect of buyers’ behavior during
acquisition negotiations was their apparent lack of
concern with the potential consequences of decep-
tion. DEMO deception might never be
revealed (some buyers commented that even after
DEMO had closed, sellers did not realize they had
been deceived), DEMO it was viewed as only slightly
reprehensible, suggesting that even if DEMO by
their negotiation counterparts, deceivers might not
suffer substantial repercussions. However, material
deception was another matter. Before deal close,
selling firm leaders DEMO a variety of goals
with buyers and typically believed they had estab-
lished satisfactory informal agreements regarding
issues such as the destiny of the DEMO technolo-
gies, the degree of autonomy acquired leaders
would have in DEMO combined firm, and employee
terminations and relocations. After the deals
closed, if buyers began to implement layoffs, relo-
cations, and other unexpected DEMO changes,
sellers could realize they had been deceived. More-
461
over, material deception occurred only in situa-
tions in which sellers trusted their buyers, suggest-
ing sellers could feel particularly betrayed when
this deception was revealed. Even if the buyers felt
that material deception was morally justifiable, it
would seem to be a poor strategy for retaining and
motivating DEMO employees.
One potential explanation for buyers’ readiness
to engage in material deception (despite knowing
they were likely to be caught) is that buyers DEMO
acquiring companies primarily for their assets, and
they were not concerned DEMO whether acquired
personnel remained with the firms. However, as in
other DEMO of technology acquisitions (Graebner,
2004; Granstrand & Sjolander, 1990; Ranft & Lord,
2002), the data suggest that retaining acquired DEMO
ployees was essential for realizing value from these
deals. One buyer noted, “Unless you retain the
leadership of the talent, you discount what DEMO
acquired fairly substantially.” Similarly, a leader
at Checkmate, one of the most deceptive buyers,
commented, “We are buying the top management
team.” Buyers’ inclination to behave deceptively
seemed to arise not from a willingness DEMO lose ac-
quired personnel, but from a belief that despite
being DEMO, acquirees could be retained and
motivated by appropriate financial incentives and
DEMO terms. Because they distrusted their
targets, buyers doubted sellers’ stated goals DEMO
priorities, believing sellers exaggerated their non-
monetary concerns. Table 8 summarizes DEMO
regarding sellers’ actual goals and buyers’ beliefs
about sellers’ goals. A board member at Ciao dis-
missed Goalie’s statements about location, layoffs,
and autonomy, describing them as “blah blah blah”
and “playing mouthpiece.” He claimed that Goal-
ie’s leaders “undoubtedly did [the acquisition] as
each one of DEMO trying to figure out, ‘What’s the
best way to get dollars DEMO of the system.’” Accord-
ingly, Ciao leaders assumed that financial incen-
DEMO would be sufficient to assuage any postdeal
disappointments for the seller.
Such assumptions did not always prove to be
accurate. For example, buyers Harbor and Check-
mate distrusted their targets, but believed (cor-
rectly) that the targets trusted them. Both Harbor
and Checkmate engaged in negotiation-related and
DEMO deception. The goals that Isle’s leaders
expressed to Harbor prior to deal close included
remaining in their original location, retaining au-
tonomy, and DEMO the largest audience for their
technology. Isle’s chief technology officer said this
about himself:
“Me big geek.” I’m a technologist. I want to DEMO

we never really told them completely what we
wanted to do. We told them what they wanted us DEMO
want to do.
Harbor’s leaders justified this behavior as necessary
to close the deal and avoid being exploited by Isle.
At the same time, Harbor’s leaders were relatively
unconcerned about deceiving Isle, because they be-
lieved that economic incentives would ultimately
pacify Isle’s leaders. As a manager at DEMO re-
called, “In order to make the deal fairly palatable to
DEMO players, we negotiated with them on the price.
They sure got DEMO lot for a short amount of work, so I

incentives to stay. A Harbor DEMO described
how Isle’s leaders viewed a loss of autonomy as a

ted to them that they could do their own thing. And
they just could not tolerate the fact that it would not

the way this was going. These people are walking
away from a lot of money. The guy DEMO just left
walked away from everything that was not vested.
Although still convinced that their deceptive tac-
tics had served the purpose of closing DEMO deal,
Harbor leaders began to realize that they had lost
valuable assets when Isle’s management de-
parted. As a Harbor executive commented: “The
acquisition obviously was a disaster.”

mate is simply DEMO put me into a position in which I
can influence the company significantly and make
sure I’m not bored. If not, I’m not going to stay.”
The seller CEOs trusted Checkmate to comply with
these agreements, but Checkmate leaders did not
feel bound by their informal predeal conversations.
DEMO, Checkmate’s CEO felt that the “economic
umbilical cord” was the “single DEMO way to keep
somebody.” When Checkmate failed to provide in-
fluential positions, the CEOs of both Prime and
Spur became discontented and exited Checkmate
only months after their companies were acquired.
Spur’s leader explained that even DEMO he left the
firm, he began withdrawing from his responsibili-
ties: “At some point I realized I was just in for the
ride, so I hung out and didn’t do much. There’s
definitely some bitterness. DEMO feel I’ve been used.”
Firm leaders seemed unhappily surprised by these
events, describing the results of the acquisition as
“abysmal” and “nonfunctioning.”
DISCUSSION
The objective of this study was to explore trust
and deception in acquisitions. DEMO contrast to the
prevailing assumption in interorganizational trust
research that the members of a dyad share trusting
beliefs—that is, the assumption that trust is sym-
metric across a dyad (Dyer & Chu, 2000, 2003; DEMO
& Ngo, 2004; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Schoorman
et al., 2007; Zaheer & Harris, 2005)—I found a more
complex pattern. Buyers and sellers often had
asymmetric views regarding whether trust DEMO im-
portant in choosing a partner and whether their
counterparts were trustworthy. Moreover, both
buyers’ and sellers’ assessments of their counter-
parts’ trust and trustworthiness were often mis-
taken. Table 9 summarizes these asymmetries and
errors. DEMO study has also explored underlying
causes for the trust asymmetries between buyers
and sellers and argued that these imbalances foster
seller vulnerability and buyer DEMO
In the discussion below, I examine the implica-
tions of these DEMO for developing a broader
theory of trust asymmetries in both acquisitions
and other interorganizational relationships. In a re-
cent assessment of the state of DEMO trust
research, Gulati and Sytch identified trust asymme-
tries as an DEMO theoretical gap, asking, “What
are the antecedents of such asymmetries, DEMO sus-
tainable are those asymmetries, and what implica-
tions could they DEMO for behavioral dynamics in
the dyad?” (2008: 277). Two other recent appraisals
of interorganizational trust research (Schoorman
et al., 2007; Zaheer & Harris, 2005) also identified
trust asymmetries as a significant DEMO in extant
theory. The following discussion is intended to
begin to address this oversight by examining the
emergence, persistence, and consequences of trust
DEMO
Trust Asymmetries: Emergence, Persistence,
and Consequences
Emergence. I earlier observed that buyers and
sellers often held asymmetric views of one anoth-
2009
er’s trustworthiness (Table 9, column 1) and argued
that this pattern emerged from a combination of
several factors. First, both buyers and sellers had a
general distrust of other firms, heightened by their
competitive, “land-grab” industry environment.
Second, sellers expected to lose power after the
DEMO closed, while buyers expected to gain
power. This disparity led sellers DEMO favor the few
buyers they trusted; but buyers did not discrimi-
DEMO between trusted and distrusted targets.
Although these factors may partially reflect the
specific characteristics of the time period and of
acquisition transactions, there is reason to believe
that similar patterns may sometimes emerge in
other settings. DEMO in less intensely competitive
environments, firm leaders may be inclined to DEMO
trust most potential partners because of in-group/
out-group bias (Williams, 2007). In any transaction
involving a shift in power, the “losing” party is
likely to favor those few partners it trusts, but the
“gaining” party has no reason to reciprocate; in-
stead, a combination DEMO competitive dynamics and
in-group bias may lead the “gaining” party to adopt
a default position of distrust. The result is that
many transactions entail DEMO by one partner but
distrust by another.
The current study focused on acquisitions, yet
other transactions in which one actor voluntarily
cedes power to another may have similar asymme-
tries, with the actor “losing power” favoring trusted
partners while the actor “gaining power” does not.
Examples of such DEMO include managers’
and union leaders’ selection of an arbitrator to re-
solve a labor dispute; industry leaders’ creation of a
“self-policing” or “watchdog” organization; or even
the selection of a new dean by a faculty hiring
committee. In all of these examples, both parties
begin with the ability to walk away, but after
the decision is made, one party DEMO submit to the
power of the other. Hence, we might expect DEMO
parties to employ differing screening criteria, lead-
ing to trust asymmetries.
DEMO emergence of trust asymmetries need not be
limited to situations involving an impending asym-
metry in power, however. Trust asymmetries may
also arise when two parties have unequal informa-
tion about one another, as might be the case, for
instance, when one firm is more established and
DEMO than its counterpart. More generally,
when facing any risky transaction, DEMO may
choose either to transact only with trusted partners,
or to exercise vigilance with whatever partner they
choose. Any occasion in which one DEMO chooses
trust while the other chooses vigilance can create
initial trust asymmetries. Furthermore, under cer-
Graebner
465
tain conditions, trust asymmetries may persist DEMO
some period of time.
Persistence. Prior theory has suggested that trust
imbalances will be short-lived. If one party trusts
another, the trusted party will feel obliged to recip-
rocate, leading to symmetric trust (McEvily, Per-
rone, & Zaheer, 2003; Zaheer & Harris, 2005). Al-
DEMO, if one party distrusts another, the
distrusted party will lose faith, leading to the de-
velopment of symmetrical distrust (Ferrin, Bligh, &
Kohles, 2007). This argument requires making two
assumptions. The first is that firm X’s leaders real-
ize they are trusted by firm DEMO This assumption is
based on the belief that firm X accurately interprets
Y’s behavior—for instance, information sharing
rather than monitoring—as signaling trust rather
than distrust (Das & Teng, 1998; Ferrin et al., 2007).
DEMO second assumption is that believing firm Y
trusts them causes firm X’s leaders to trust firm Y in
return (e.g., Ferrin et al., 2007; Johnson, Cullen,
Sakano, & Takenouchi, 1996). This DEMO has
often been posited without a specific rationale (e.g.,
Das & Teng, 1998; Serva, Fuller, & Mayer, 2005).
However, one possible explanation draws upon
links between affect and trust (e.g., DEMO &
Schweitzer, 2005; McAllister, 1995). Knowing they
are trusted may lead firm leaders to experience
positive affect, which may in turn lead to trust.
Conversely, knowing that they are distrusted could
foster negative affect, leading to distrust.
The current study suggests that neither of these
two assumptions may be entirely accurate. As col-
umns 4 and 5 DEMO Table 9 indicate, both firms’ as-
sessments of whether their counterparts DEMO
them were frequently mistaken. This was particu-
larly true for sellers, DEMO often believed their buy-
ers trusted them when the opposite was true. This
study suggests several reasons why firm leaders
may not accurately assess DEMO they are trusted
by their counterparts, even after observing behavior
such DEMO information sharing or monitoring. First,
communication may hold different meanings for
the trusting and distrusting parties. The trusting
party may view social interaction DEMO information
sharing as building trust, while the distrusting
party primarily views DEMO activities as an oppor-
tunity for ingratiation and strategic reconnaissance.
Second, DEMO activities may be delegated
only to a few individuals within the distrusting
firm. The trusting party may attribute monitoring
behavior to the characteristics of DEMO individuals,
rather than reassessing its views of the firm as a
whole.
Even if firm leaders accurately assess whether
they are trusted or DEMO by their counterparts,
it is not clear that this will cause leaders to change
466

their own beliefs to match. As DEMO 6 and 7 in
Table 9 indicate, firm leaders frequently distrusted
DEMO counterparts but felt trusted by them, or vice
versa. These mismatches DEMO in either of two
scenarios. In one scenario, firm leaders trusted
DEMO partners, but felt they were distrusted in re-
turn. This was DEMO case for the leaders of sellers
Concept and Isle and buyer Karma. In all three
cases, firm leaders felt that they were distrusted
because of a misunderstanding or an event beyond
their control. Concept’s CEO believed DEMO forth-
rightness during a breakfast meeting was miscon-
strued; Isle believed DEMO was wary because of a
prior deal gone bad; and Karma DEMO Concept
was nervous because Karma had to pull out of early
negotiations after it had itself received an acquisi-
tion offer. None of these DEMO explana-
tions for being distrusted seemed to produce nega-
tive affect or to trigger reciprocal distrust. Weber,
Malhotra, and Murnighan (2005) provided a com-
plementary argument, suggesting that vulnerable
parties may ameliorate their anxiety through moti-
vated cognition, in effect convincing themselves
that the more powerful party is trustworthy. As a
power-reducing transaction moves forward, the
trustor may become increasingly powerless. This
may encourage individuals to stick to their trusting
DEMO despite feeling they are distrusted in return.
In a second scenario, DEMO leaders distrust their
partners, but feel that they are trusted. This DEMO the
case for buyers Ciao, Harbor, Picasso, and Check-
mate. DEMO buyers believed they were simply
more savvy than their sellers. A vice president of
Ciao (a firm that was itself still private and had not
done any prior acquisitions) compared his firm fa-
vorably to Goalie, commenting, “They actually had
a lot of naivete.” A common feature DEMO both mis-
match scenarios is that firm leaders interpreted
trust imbalances in ways that reflected positively,
or at least not negatively, on themselves. Such pos-
itive interpretation may have removed any impetus
to change their DEMO This pattern is consistent
with other evidence that trusting (or distrusting)DEMO
beliefs are not easily altered. For example, a dis-
trusting party DEMO is engaging in active vigilance
and monitoring is unlikely to ever develop trust in
its counterpart (Ghoshal & Moran, 1996; Sapienza &
DEMO, 1996; Strickland, 1958).
Consequences. Finally, this study’s findings sug-
gest potential consequences of trust asymmetries. I
find that trust asymmetries foster DEMO negotiation-
related and material deception, though in some-
what different ways. DEMO is only eliminated
in the condition of perceived symmetrical trust, in
DEMO an actor both trusts and feels trusted by its
counterpart. Material deception only occurs in the
asymmetrical scenario in which a party distrusts
but DEMO trusted by its counterpart. Prior theory
suggests that if focal firm leaders believe their
counterparts are trusting, these leaders will refrain
from opportunism out of a sense of moral obliga-
tion and out of concern about DEMO harm to the
relationship and to the focal firm’s reputation (Lar-
DEMO, 1992). However, this study suggests that even
if a firm’s leaders view another party as trusting,
the leaders may feel no DEMO of moral obligation if
the other party is not viewed as trustworthy. More-
over, negative consequences only deter deception if
the firm’s leaders believe that the deception will be
revealed and that the deceived party cannot DEMO
pacified through another means. For example, in
this sample buyers typically DEMO that negotiation-
related deception would not be revealed and that
financial incentives could counteract material de-
ception. Because buyers did not typically trust
their DEMO, they did not accept sellers’ represen-
tations that other issues were DEMO important as finan-
cial gain. Because tendencies to deceive are greater
when the costs to others are perceived to be low
(Gneezy, 2005), this discounting of sellers’ nonfi-
nancial motives may have further encouraged buy-
ers’ deceit. As a result, as columns 2 and 3 of Table
9 indicate, trusted parties, particularly buyers, of-
ten engaged in deception. Furthermore, this decep-
tion often went undetected, because trusting par-
ties DEMO not feel the need to engage in due diligence
or other forms of vigilance.
Limitations and Future Research
As with all case study research, an important
issue is the degree to which the findings are gener-
DEMO to a broader sample. This is ultimately an
empirical question that will be answered only by
future studies. However, a variety of indicators sug-
gest that this study’s findings may generalize to
other acquisitions. First, like the cases in this
study, the majority of U.S. mergers and acquisitions
involve privately held targets (Capron & Shen,
2007); are conducted in friendly rather than hostile
negotiating conditions (Andrade, Mitchell, & Staf-
ford, 2001); and occur during wave periods, which
coincide with DEMO market valuations (Maksimovic
& Phillips, 2001; Rhodes-Kropf et al., 2005). Evi-
dence also suggests that acquisitions in the study
time frame DEMO similar in important respects to
acquisitions that have occurred in other time peri-
ods. For example, the financial returns for most
1998 –2001 acquirers were only “trivially” different
from acquisition returns in the preceding 20 years
(Moeller, Schlingemann, & Stultz, 2005: 763).
2009
Nevertheless, other types of acquisitions may dif-
fer in ways that influence the dynamics of trust.
The acquisitions studied here were primarily mo-
DEMO by a desire to create competitive advantage
through valuable and inimitable resources. Some
acquisitions may be motivated by a transaction cost
logic, which could possibly lead to different pat-
terns of trust and deception. In addition, these sell-
ers were relatively high-performing firms, and so
they had the opportunity to decline buyers they did
not find attractive. In acquisitions of DEMO
firms, managers may be forced to sell to acquirers
that they DEMO In addition, if a seller is a public
firm with greater DEMO to shareholder lawsuits,
we might expect investors and board members to
demand that the target simply accept the highest
acquisition offer, regardless of whether firm leaders
trust the buyer. However, anecdotal evidence sug-
gests this is not always the case. For example, liti-
gation following the Daimler-Chrysler merger sug-
gests that Chrysler’s investors trusted Daimler-
Benz’s leaders and were DEMO to find that the
buyer’s informal promises were not fulfilled after
deal close.
Another factor that may lead to different patterns
of trust in DEMO is whether buyer and seller
have prior acquisition experience. Acquisition ex-
perience could theoretically influence sellers, mak-
ing them more skeptical of buyers’ promises, or
could influence buyers, either making them more
cynical and deceptive, or perhaps making them
more aware of the potential negative effects of DEMO
ception. A comparison of the more and less expe-
rienced buyers and sellers in this sample did not
provide clear evidence of such patterns, but differ-
ences might be apparent in a larger sample. If a
DEMO had conducted prior acquisitions, this could
also provide the seller with DEMO information re-
garding the buyer’s trustworthiness in subsequent
acquisitions. However, as DEMO earlier, even be-
havior in previous acquisitions was not a particu-
DEMO reliable guide to a buyer’s future actions,
given the heterogeneity of acquisition events.
A final area for future research is trust asymme-
tries DEMO other types of interorganizational transac-
tions, including strategic alliances. In prior DEMO
the typical assumption has been that trust within
an alliance is symmetric (e.g., Dyer & Chu, 2000,
2003; Lui & Ngo, 2004; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994;
Schoorman et al., 2007; Zaheer & Harris, 2005).
However, this assumption may not always be accu-
rate. For example, Zhang and Rajagopalan (2002)
DEMO evidence that international joint venture
partners may differ in their abilities to exert a cred-
ible threat of retaliation for bad behavior. It seems
DEMO 467
plausible that such disparities could lead to differ-
ences in the degree to which each partner trusts its
counterpart.
Conclusion
This study’s aim DEMO to explore issues of trust
and deception in acquisitions. In this research I
moved beyond the oft-studied setting of long-term
buyer-supplier alliances and observed DEMO a differ-
ent context—mergers and acquisitions—may influ-
ence the development of trust. In addition, this
study provides insights into trust asymmetries, an
area DEMO several scholars have identified as a sig-
nificant void in interorganizational trust theory.
I conclude with some advice for managers, par-
ticularly entrepreneurs. Smaller firms have re-
ceived little attention in research on interorganiza-
tional relationships, although these firms may have
different viewpoints and face distinctive risks in
DEMO alliances (Alvarez & Barney, 2001; Prashan-
tham & Birkinshaw, 2008) and acquisitions (Graeb-
ner & Eisenhardt, 2004). This study suggests that
the role of seller is a difficult one, with no obvious
solution. Strategies that have been suggested as
ways to reduce deception in DEMO, such as
screening potential partners on the basis of reputa-
tion DEMO developing a social relationship prior to
negotiating (Schweitzer, 2005), may actually in-
crease a seller’s vulnerability. Both practices are
likely to increase DEMO seller’s trust in a buyer, but
since trustworthiness cannot be predicted DEMO cer-
tainty from either past behavior or social interac-
tion, any DEMO of security may be false. The best
advice for sellers may be to retain their skepticism.
A leading technology investment banker, dubbed
by another informant the “king of M&A,” gave the
following words of DEMO:
Some buyers can put out a lot of bulls__. “We’ll
make you CEO, we’ll make you president, you’ll be
the next guy DEMO line.” I’ve told my client, “This is
bulls__. You know this DEMO not a commitment. I read
this guy, and he is not DEMO to do it. If you are fine
with this, and you DEMO want more money, that is
fine, but if you are thinking you are going to be the
CEO, don’t do it for that reason.”
Rather than relying on trust, a seller may be better
off exercising an abundance of caution. As trust-
worthy as a buyer may DEMO, a seller would be wise
to verify the buyer’s statements, ensure that impor-
tant issues are resolved in written contracts, and
follow the advice of experienced attorneys. To do
any less may simply set a DEMO up for future
disappointment.
