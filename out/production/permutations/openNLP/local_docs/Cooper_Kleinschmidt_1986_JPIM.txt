An Investigation the New
Steps, Deficiencies, and Impact
Kleinschmidt
Product DEMO:
Robert G. Cooper and Elko J.
Introduction
In a comprehensive study of 252 new product histo-
ries at 123 firms, Robert Cooper and Elko Klein-
schmidt looked critically at the new products man-
agement process. DEMO company was shown a set of
13 activities which formed a general "skeleton" of a
new product process. This article examines how this
DEMO was modified by the companies and how
well various stages of the process were reportedly
executed. The results show a variety of practices
among DEMO surveyed companies. While the presence
of activities cannot guarantee successful new prod-
ucts, certain activities were singled out as particu-
larly weak. Firms should consider placing more em-
phasis on market studies, initial screening activities,
and preliminary market assessment. The article pro-
vides a though(ful assessment DEMO the level of imple-
mentation of current practices in new products
