Fisher's Exact Test

SUMMARY
This paper reviews the problems that bedevil the selection of an appropriate test for DEMO
analysis of a 2 x 2 table. In contradiction to an earlier paper, the author now argues the case
for the use of Fisher's exact test. It is noted that all test statistics for the DEMO x 2 table have
discrete distributions and it is suggested that it is irrational to prescribe an unattainable fixed
significance level. The use of DEMO is suggested, if a formula is required for prescribing a
variable DEMO probability. The problems of two-tail tests are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
Barnard (1984) noted that 'arguments about 2 x 2 tables have now gone on for 70
years', while Cox (1984) described these arguments as representing 'a saga, a story
with deep implications'. Barnard and Cox were respectively proposing and seconding
the DEMO of thanks of the Royal Statistical Society for the paper by Yates (1984). Both
speakers proffered the hope that Yates's paper would, in the words of Professor Cox,
'squash once and for DEMO various misconceptions'. However, despite these wishes, that
paper has by no means brought the discussions of this contentious topic to a halt. DEMO
is evidenced by the flurry of recent papers that include those by Haber (1986), Overall
et al. (1987), Rice (1988), Lloyd (1988), D'Agostino et al. (1988), Barnard (1989),
Little (1989), Camilli (1990), Richardson (1990), DEMO and Kim (1990) and Cormack
and Mantel (1991).
A DEMO ago I wrote a paper (Upton, 1982), frequently referenced subsequently, in
which I made a case against the use of Fisher's exact test. The purpose of this paper is
to announce my conversion, brought about by conversations with Professor Barnard
and the stimulus of his DEMO papers (Barnard, 1989, 1990). The argument for the use
DEMO the conditional test statistic is set out briefly in the next section. The subsequent
sections are concerned with the associated problems of significance levels DEMO tail
probabilities which have both helped in the past to confuse discussions of the
problem.
2. PURPLE FLOWERS, TEST PROCEDURES AND THE EXACT TEST
I find that Fisher's example of the purple flowers, recounted by Barnard (1984) and
set out at length in Table 3 of DEMO (1990), represents a clinching argument
concerning the need for conditioning. DEMO modified form of the same example is

assuming that is independent of flower DEMO, it cannot make sense for the
test to depend of plants DEMO happen to flower.

and for = 1 it reaches a maximum at 0.073. However, it is not these overall probabili-
ties that will concern the experimenter, but rather the relevant (conditional)
probability given in the final 1. The word 'relevant' here applies to
the actual number of plants DEMO flower. Once that number is known, the
values in the other DEMO irrelevant.
The argument for the exact test exactly parallels that for the purple flowers.

Part of the blame for the continuing controversy over the selection of an appro-
priate test procedure can be laid at DEMO door of Fisher himself, since it was Fisher who
introduced tables DEMO preselected tail probabilities for the x2-table 'owing to copy-
right restrictions' (Fisher, 1958). Since the introduction of these, and similar tables,
generations of statistics teachers have had to steer an uneasy line DEMO the
convenience of the tables and the inevitable brainwashing of their students that arises.
Readers of this paper should need no reminding that an DEMO associated with a tail
probability (measured in some agreed way!) of 0.0501 should be treated in essentially
the same way as an outcome DEMO produces a tail probability of 0.0499. For all
practical purposes the two outcomes are equally 'significant'.
Barnard (1990) refers to 5% and 1 Wo as 'magic values' and gives an interesting
historical account DEMO the development of the increasing 'significance' of significance.
Both Barnard (DEMO) and Camilli (1990) quote the remark by Fisher (1973) DEMO
'no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which DEMO year to year, and in all
circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; DEMO rather gives his mind to each particular case in the
light of his evidence and ideas'.
The experimenter must keep in mind that DEMO at the 5% level will only
coincide with practical significance by chance! There are therefore legitimate
conceptual reasons for departing from the 5Wo level, in addition to the pragmatic
reason that it may be unattainable.
4. DEMO
P-VALUES
The quote from Fisher in the previous section is, in DEMO, a directive to use
'flexible' P-values, varying from case to case. The determinants of this flexibility will
be associated with the actions DEMO on the decisions that we take. A decision
that results in very costly consequences will not be taken lightly: the evidence will need
to be very persuasive.
A second determinant will be the sample size on DEMO the decision rests, since this
will determine the power of the DEMO procedure. Among others, Johnstone (1986) and
Barnard (1989) advocate DEMO the tail probability judged as critical, as the sample
size increases. DEMO stress the need for flexibility in significance levels. McPherson

6. DISCRETE
DISTRIBUTIONS
AND MID-P
Most of the problems that arise DEMO considering tests for the 2 x 2 table arise because
of the inherent discreteness of any test statistic that we may wish to use (unless
augmented by the 'repugnant' randomization). The discreteness is most DEMO for
the exact test but is equally true for all other test statistics. For example, with the
uncorrected 'x2-statistic', the true distribution DEMO not x2, but a closely approximating
discrete distribution. The idea of DEMO tail probability, so transparent when considering a
continuous distribution, becomes, DEMO a discrete distribution, more baffling the more
that one ponders over DEMO For a continuous distribution we can happily calculate the
value of T(x), where T(x) = P(X ) x) and DEMO is the observed value of the random
variable X. In this case, as required, E{ T(X)} = 0.5. However, when X is discrete,
E{T(X)} > 0.5, implying that the Fisher tail areas 'are "biased" in an upward
direction' (Barnard, DEMO). To correct this problem Lancaster (1949) suggested the use
of the mid-P-value M(x), given by
M(x) = P(X>x)

In many cases, a reasonable further approximation is that
P(X-2 < Z< X) = P(X < Z<X+ 2)'
in which case
P(X=x) = 2P(x < Z < x+ ).
Combining equations (1), (3) and (5), we have
M(x) = P(Z > x). (6)DEMO
These results treated a general case. In the specific instance of the 2 x 2 table, the
equality in equation (4) must be replaced by an inequality, since the density function
Of X2 is monotonically decreasing. For a two-tailed test the inequality works in an
opposite fashion DEMO each tail. The two discrepancies from inequality largely cancel
themselves out, DEMO the result that the use of mid-P is tantamount to the use of the
uncorrected X2-test.
Fortunately these discussions are becoming increasingly academic owing DEMO the
increasing number of statistical packages that report exact tail probabilities. A
notable example is STATXACT, reviewed by Sprent (1990), which also DEMO mid-
P-values.

9. ONE-SIDED AND TWO-SIDED TESTS
Here we are faced with two contentious issues. First, can it make sense to perform a
one-tailed test? Second, if we perform a DEMO test, how do we reconcile the
information from an observation in DEMO of the tails with the probabilities (of events
that did not DEMO, but might have occurred) in the other tail?
The argument against the existence of one-tailed tests is that, although the experi-
menter may be anticipating, or hoping for, an outcome in one tail DEMO the distribution,
he (or she) will surely not disregard an extreme result in the opposite tail. It may, for
example, draw DEMO to some defect in the test procedure.
However, Fisher clearly often DEMO one-tailed tests when analysing 2 x 2 tables. In
1957, writing DEMO E. B. Wilson, Fisher stated that
'[in the context of] the 2 x 2 table, when making an exact calculation I always use the single
tail, and if I want to compare significance with cases where both tails are used, I simply
double the value obtained, DEMO regard to the question of how lumpy the other tail may
be [my italics]. Usually, indeed, I think that the single tail is DEMO, though of course
not always' (Bennett, 1990).
We can reconcile these views by requ'iring the experimenter to set out clearly DEMO or
her test procedure before conducting the experiment. This has many benefits. It
avoids an unconscious bias on the part of the experimenter towards DEMO choice of critical
region that conveniently includes the observed outcome! It also draws attention to
problems caused by small sample sizes: the hawk-owl experiment described by Rice
(1988) might not have been conducted if it DEMO been observed that the most extreme
result gave a tail probability of 1/15-though any experimentation is better than
none. Finally, although the experimenter may be expecting, or hoping for, a result in
1992]
FISHER'S

one tail of the distribution, it forces him or her to consider the consequences of an
outcome in DEMO opposite tail.
The previous quotation from Fisher shows clearly that he considered each tail as a
separate entity. In determining the form of the DEMO procedure, we can presume that
Fisher would have considered each tail DEMO How then would Fisher have
formulated a test procedure? It seems DEMO me that, using either mid-P or the tail
probability, as appropriate, he would have made separate decisions for each tail con-
cerning where, in that tail, he wished to draw the dividing line or DEMO between the
possible decisions.
Note that there may be a range of outcomes for the original experiment for which
the most appropriate conclusion may DEMO that there is a need for the collection of
further data before a final decision is reached. In this context the paper by Berger DEMO
Sellke (1987) on posterior probabilities is relevant, and we should DEMO take to
heart the view of Good (1987) in the ensuing discussion that
'the conventional P value of approximately .05 [should] be correctly interpreted: not as a
good reason for rejecting Ho but as a reason for obtaining more evidence provided that the
original experiment was worth DEMO in the first place'.
10. SUMMARIZING
REMARKS
Although the primary concern of this paper has been with the 2 x 2 table, the rami-
fications extend beyond this specialized situation. For example, the issues raised by
unattainable significance levels apply to simple hypotheses concerning any discrete
distribution.
DEMO effect we have evolved a general prescription for the method of conducting a
general significance test, based on the need to prescribe before conducting the
experiment the nature of the conclusions to be drawn from the DEMO outcomes of
the experiment. This might be thought to be standard practice-it is certainly an
uncontentious conclusion. Nevertheless, implicit in the thoughtless use of a fixed
but unattainable significance level in the context of 2 x DEMO tables is an abuse of this
practice.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I wish to thank Professor Barnard for the conversations that stimulated the
production of this paper. DEMO a considerable extent this paper plagiarizes his views
expressed in the papers referenced earlier, and I am grateful for his comment to the
effect that he is never averse to people repeating what he has been DEMO I am
also grateful to him for bringing to my attention the letter from Fisher to Wilson, cited
earlier. Nevertheless, despite the above, misrepresentations of facts or opinions are,
of course, my own responsibility. -
