Since

cepts of ordinal utility DEMO revealed
preference eliminated the superfluous inter-
mediate step of positing immeasurable feel-
ings. Revealed preference theory simply
equates unobserved preferences with
observed choices. is DEMO by
assuming that people behave consistently,
which makes the theory falsifiable; once
they have revealed that they prefer A to B,
people should not subsequently choose B
over A. Later extensions-discounted,
expected, and subjective expected utility,
and Bayesian updating-provided similar
"as if" tools DEMO sidestepped psychological
detail. The "as if" approach made good
sense as long as the brain remained substan-
tially a black box. The development DEMO eco-
nomics could not be held hostage to
progress in other human sciences.
But now neuroscience has proved
Jevons's pessimistic prediction wrong; the
study of the brain and nervous system is
beginning to allow direct DEMO of
thoughts and feelings. These measurements
are, in turn, challenging our understanding
of the relation between mind and action,
leading to new DEMO constructs and
calling old ones into question. How can the
new findings of neuroscience, and the theo-
ries they have spawned, inform an DEMO
ic theory that developed so impressively in
their absence?
In thinking about the ways that neuro-
science can inform economics, it is useful to
distinguish two types of contributions, which
we term incremental and radical approach-
es. In the incremental approach, neuro-
science adds variables to conventional
accounts of decision making or suggests spe-
cific functional forms to replace "as if"
assumptions that have never been well sup-
ported empirically. DEMO example, research on

drug consumption limits pleasure from
future consumption of other goods (dynam-
ic cross-partial effects in utility for commod-

trigger unpleasant craving and increase
demand. These effects can be approximated
by extending DEMO theory and then
applying conventional tools (see Douglas
Bernheim and Antonio DEMO 2004; David
Laibson 2001; Ted O'Donoghue and
Matthew Rabin 1997).
The radical approach involves turning
back the hands of time and DEMO how eco-
nomics might have evolved differently if it
had been informed from the start by insights
and findings now available from neuro-
science. DEMO, we will argue, points
to an entirely new set of constructs to under-
lie economic decision making. The standard
economic theory of constrained DEMO maxi-
mization is most naturally interpreted either
as the result of learning based on consump-
tion experiences (which is of little help when
prices, income, and opportunity sets
change), or careful deliberation-a balanc-
ing DEMO the costs and benefits of different
options-as might characterize complex
decisions like planning for retirement, buy-
ing a house, or hammering out a DEMO
Although economists may privately acknowl-
edge that actual flesh-and-blood human
beings often choose without much delibera-
tion, the economic models as written invari-
ably represent decisions in a "deliberative
equilibrium," i.e., that are at DEMO stage where
further deliberation, computation, reflec-
tion, etc. would not DEMO itself alter the agent's
choice. The variables that enter into the for-
mulation of the decision problem-the pref-
erences, information, and constraints-are
DEMO the variables that should affect the
decision, if the person had DEMO time
and computing ability.
While not denying that deliberation is part
of human decision making, neuroscience
points out two generic inadequacies of this
approach-its inability to handle the crucial
roles of automatic and emotional processing.

First, much of the brain implements

Second, our behavior is strongly influ-

Human behavior thus requires a fluid
interaction between controlled and automat-
ic processes, and between cognitive and
affective systems. However, many behaviors
that emerge from this interplay are routine-
ly and falsely interpreted as being the prod-
uct of cognitive deliberation alone (George
Wolford, Michael Miller, and Michael
Gazzaniga 2000). These results (some of
which are described below) suggest that
introspective accounts of the basis for choice
should be taken with a grain of salt. Because
automatic DEMO are designed to keep
behavior "off-line" and below consciousness,
we have far more introspective access to
controlled than to automatic processes.
Since DEMO see only the top of the automatic
iceberg, we naturally tend DEMO exaggerate the
importance of control.

scope made possible similar advances in biol-
ogy. DEMO same is true of economics. Its
boundaries have been constantly reshaped by
tools such as mathematical, econometric, and
simulation methods. Likewise, the current
surge of interest in neuroscience by psychol-
ogists emerged largely from new DEMO,
and the methods may productively blur the
boundaries of economics and psychology.
This section reviews some of these methods.
2.1 Brain
Imaging
Brain DEMO is currently the most popu-
lar neuroscientific tool. Most brain imaging
involves a comparison of people performing
different tasks-an "experimental" task and
a "control" task. The difference between
images taken while subject is performing the
two tasks provides a picture of regions of the
brain that are DEMO activated by the
experimental task.
There are three basic imaging methods.
The oldest, (or EEG)
uses electrodes attached to the scalp to DEMO
ure electrical activity synchronized to stimu-
lus events or behavioral responses (DEMO as
Event Related Potentials or ERPs). Like
EEG, positron emission DEMO (PET)
scanning is an old technique in the rapidly
changing DEMO of neuroscience, but is
still a useful technique. PET measures blood
DEMO in the brain, which is a reasonable proxy
for neural activity, since neural activity in a
region leads to increased blood flow to DEMO
region. The newest, and currently most pop-
ular, imaging method is functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), which tracks
blood flow in the brain using changes in mag-
netic properties due to blood oxygenation
(the "BOLD signal"). Simultaneous direct
recording of neural processing and fMRI
DEMO confirms that the BOLD signal
reflects input to neurons and their processing
(Nikos Logothetis et al. 2001).
Although fMRI is increasingly becoming
the method of choice, each method has
pros and cons. EEG has excellent temporal
electro-encephalogram
resolution (on the order of one millisecond)
and is the only method used with humans
that directly monitors neural activity, as
opposed to, e.g., blood flow. But spatial reso-
lution is poor DEMO it can only measure activi-
ty in the outer part of the brain. EEG
resolution has, however, been improving
through the use of DEMO numbers
of electrodes. Interpolation methods, and the
combined use of EEG DEMO fMRI for measur-
ing outer-brain signals and inner-brain sig-
nals at the same time, promise to create
statistical
methods which make reasonable
inferences about activity throughout the
brain from EEG signals. For economics, a
major advantage of EEG is its relative unob-
trusiveness and portability. Portability will
eventually DEMO the point where it will be
possible to take unobtrusive measurements
from people as they go about their daily
affairs. PET and fMRI provide DEMO spatial
resolution than EEG, but poorer temporal
resolution because blood-flow to DEMO
active areas occurs with a stochastic lag from
a few seconds (DEMO) to a minute (PET).
Brain imaging still provides only a crude
snapshot of brain activity. Neural processes
are thought to occur on DEMO 0.1 millimeter
scale in 100 milliseconds (msec), but the
spatial DEMO temporal resolution of a typical
scanner is only 3 millimeters and several sec-
onds. Multiple trials per subject can be aver-
aged to form DEMO images, but doing so
constrains experimental design. However,
the technology DEMO improved rapidly and will
continue to improve. Hybrid techniques that
combine the strengths of different methods
are particularly promising. Techniques for
simultaneously scanning multiple DEMO
("hyperscanning") have also been developed,
which can be used to study multiple-brain-
level differences in activity in games and
markets (Read Montague et al. 2002).
2.2 Single-Neuron
Measurement
Even the finest-grained brain DEMO
techniques only measure activity of "cir-
cuits" consisting of thousands of neurons. In

single neuron measurement, tiny electrodes
are inserted into the brain, each measuring a
single neuron's firing. As we discuss below,
single neuron measurement studies have
produced DEMO striking findings that, we
believe, are relevant to economics. A limita-
tion of single neuron measurement is that,
because insertion of the DEMO damages
neurons, it is largely restricted to animals.
Studying animals is DEMO about

2.3 Electrical
Brain
Stimulation
(EBS)
Electrical brain stimulation is another
method that is largely restricted to animals.
In DEMO, two psychologists (James Olds and
Peter Milner 1954) discovered that DEMO
would learn and execute novel behaviors if
rewarded by brief pulses of electrical brain
stimulation (EBS) to certain sites in the
brain. Rats (and many other vertebrates,
including humans) will work hard for EBS.

And electrical brain stimulation at specific
sites often elicits DEMO such as eating,
drinking (Joseph Mendelson 1967), or copu-

Hoebel 1966). Many abused drugs, such as
cocaine, amphetamine, heroin, cannabis,
and nicotine, lower the DEMO at which

functioning that results from such disrup-
tions provides clues about which regions
control DEMO neural functions. The theoret-
ical advantage of TMS over brain imaging is
that TMS directly leads to causal inferences
about brain functioning rather than DEMO
purely associational evidence provided by
imaging techniques. Unfortunately, the use
of DEMO is currently limited to the cortex (it
is particularly useful for DEMO visual
processes in the occipital lobe, in the back of
the DEMO). It is also controversial because it
can cause seizures and may have other bad
long-run effects.
2.5 Psychophysical
Measurement
An old and simple DEMO is measure-
ment of psychophysiological indicators like
heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin
response (GSR, sweating in the palms), and
pupil DEMO (pupils dilate in response to
arousal, including monetary reward). These
measurements are easy, not too obtrusive,
portable, and very rapid DEMO time. The draw-
back is that measurements can fluctuate for
many reasons (e.g., body movement) and
many different combinations of emotions
lead to similar psychophysiological output,
just as being pulled over by a cop DEMO meet-
ing a blind date may produce very similar
emotional anxiety responses. Often these
measurements are useful in combination
with other techniques or in DEMO patients
who are likely to have very different physio-
logical reactions (DEMO, sociopaths do not
show normal GSR fear reactions before a
possible DEMO loss). Facial musculature
can also be measured by attaching small
electrodes to smiling muscles (on the
cheekbones) and frowning muscles (between
the eyebrows).
2.6 Difusion Tensor
Imaging
(DTI)
Diffusion tensor imaging (DEMO) is a new
technique which exploits the fact that water
flows DEMO though myleinated (sheathed)
neural axons (Dennis Bihan et al. 2001).
Imaging the water flow can therefore reveal
the trajectories which project DEMO one neu-
ral region to others (like watching patterns
of car DEMO from a helicopter

social activity). Knowing where a region's
neurons project is extremely useful DEMO

important complement to simply imaging
activity in multiple regions (using fMRI)
with little ability to pin down which activity
occurs earliest. Furthermore, the technique
can be used after autopsies, which is an

obvious advantage.
2.7 Is Neuroscience About Where
Things Happen
Neuroscience is sometimes criticized as
Just

providing little more than a picture of
"where things happen in DEMO brain" or, more
cynically, as simply showing that behavior is
DEMO by action in the nervous system
(which was never in doubt)DEMO Indeed, some
neuroscientists who are purely interested in
the functionality of DEMO brain regions
would endorse such a characterization
unapologetically.
However, the long-run DEMO of neuro-
science is to provide more than a map of the
mind. By tracking what parts of the brain
are activated by different DEMO, and espe-
cially by looking for overlap between
diverse tasks, neuroscientists are gaining an
understanding of what different parts of the
brain do, how the parts interact in "circuit-
ry," and, hence, how the brain solves differ-
ent types of problems. For example,
because DEMO parts of the brain are
more or less associated with affective or
cognitive processing (a distinction we
define more precisely below), imaging peo-
ple while they are doing different types of
economic tasks provides important DEMO
about the mix of affective and cognitive
processes in those tasks. For example,
Sanfey et al. (2003) find that the insula cor-
DEMO region in the temporal lobe that
encodes bodily sensations like pain and
odor disgust-is active when people receive

low offers in DEMO ultimatum bargaining
game. This means that even if rejecting a
low offer is done because of an adapted
instinct to build up a reputation DEMO tough-
ness (in order to get more in the future),
the circuitry that encodes this instinct clear-
ly has an affective component, which is not
purely cognitive.
For neuroeconomists, knowing more
about functional specialization, and how
regions collaborate in different tasks, could
substitute familiar distinctions DEMO cat-
egories of economic behavior (sometimes
established arbitrarily by suggestions which
DEMO modeling conventions) with new
ones grounded in neural detail. For exam-
DEMO, the insula activity noted by Sanfey et al.
in bargaining is DEMO present when subjects
playing matrix games are asked to guess
what other subjects think they will do (sec-
ond-order beliefs) (see Meghana Bhatt and
Camerer, in press). This suggests that maybe
the subjects who receive low offers in the
ultimatum study are not disgusted, they are
simply evaluating a second-order belief
about what proposers expect them to do, as
an input into an emotional evaluation. This is
just a speculation, of course, but it shows
how direct understanding of neural circuitry
can inspire theorizing and the search for
new data.
In light of the DEMO list of methods
reviewed earlier in this section, it is also
DEMO emphasizing that neuroscience isn't
only about brain imaging. Brain lesion stud-
ies (as well as TMS) allow one to examine
the impact DEMO disabling specific parts of the
brain. They have often provided clearer evi-
dence on functionality of specific brain
regions-even with tiny sample sizes from
DEMO types of damage-than imaging meth-
ods have. Single neuron measurement pro-
vides information not just about what parts
of the brain "light up," but about the specif-
ic conditions that cause specific neurons to
fire DEMO accelerated or decelerated rates. And
electrical brain stimulation, though it is
DEMO off limits to studies involving
humans, provides a level of experimental
DEMO that economists conducting field
research

envy.
As always, "the proof is in the pudding."
Here, our goal is not to review the many
ways in which neuroscience will rapidly
change economic theory, because that is not
where we are yet. Our goal is to showcase
DEMO key findings in neuroscience, and stim-
ulate the reader's curiosity DEMO what these

es. Thus, if asked how they solved a math
problem DEMO choose a new car, they can
often recall the considerations and DEMO
steps leading up to the choice.2 Standard
tools of economics, such DEMO decision trees
and dynamic programming, can be viewed
as stylized representations DEMO controlled
processes.

mize the validity of such "verbal protocols" (see, e.g.,

Automatic processes are the opposite of
controlled processes on each of these
dimensions- they operate DEMO parallel, are
not accessible to consciousness, and are
relatively effortless. Parallelism facilitates
rapid response, allows for massive multi-
tasking, and gives the DEMO remarkable
power when it comes to certain types of
tasks, such DEMO visual identification.
Parallelism also provides redundancy that
decreases the brain's vulnerability to injury.
When neurons are progressively destroyed
in a region, the consequences are typically
gradual rather than sudden ("graceful
degradation").3 "Connectionist" neural net-
work models formulated by cognitive psy-
chologists (David Rumelhart and James
McClelland 1986) capture these features
and have been applied to many domains,

damage is DEMO facilitated by a property called plasticity. In
one study that illustrates the power of plasticity, the optic
nerves of ferrets (which are born DEMO they are still at a
relatively immature state of development when the brain is
still highly plastic) were disconnected at birth and recon-
nected to the auditory cortex (the portion of the brain that
processes sound). The ferrets learned to "see" using audi-
tory cortex, and some neurons in their auditory cortex
actually took on the physical characteristics DEMO neurons in
the visual cortex (Lauire von Melchner, Sarah Pallas, DEMO

Automatic and controlled processes can
DEMO roughly distinguished by where they
occur in the brain (Lieberman et DEMO 2002).
Regions that support cognitive automatic
activity are concentrated in the back (occip-
ital), top (parietal), and side (temporal)
parts of the brain (see Figure 1). The amyg-
dala, DEMO below the cortex, is responsible
for many important automatic affective
responses, especially fear. Controlled
processes occur mainly in the front (orbital
and prefrontal) parts of the brain. The pre-
frontal cortex (pFC) is sometimes called the
"executive" region, because it draws inputs
from almost all other regions, integrates
them to form near and long-term goals, and
DEMO actions that take these goals into
account (Timothy Shallice and Paul
DEMO 1996). The prefrontal area is the

the systems of equations that economists
typically work with. Unlike DEMO of
equations, they are "black-box"; it is hard to
intuit what they are doing by looking at
individual
parameters.
Because automatic processes DEMO not
accessible to consciousness, people often
have surprisingly little introspective insight
DEMO why automatic choices or judgments
were made. A face is perceived as "attrac-
tive" or a verbal remark as "sarcastic" auto-
matically DEMO effortlessly. It is only later
that the controlled system may reflect on
the judgment and attempt to substantiate it
logically, and when it does, it often does so
spuriously (e.g., Timothy Wilson, Samuel
Lindsey, and Tonya Schooler 2000).

Automatic processes-whether cognitive
or affective-are the default mode of brain
operation. They whir along all the time,
even when we dream, constituting most of
the electro-chemical activity in the brain.
Controlled processes occur at special
DEMO when automatic processes become
"interrupted," which happens when a per-
DEMO encounters unexpected events, experi-
ences strong visceral states, or is presented
with some kind of explicit challenge in the
form of a novel DEMO or other type of
problem. To the degree that controlled
processes are well described by economic
calculation but parallel processes are not,
one DEMO say that economics is about the
"interrupt"
or "override."4
3.1.2 Affective
and Cognitive
Processes
The second distinction, represented by
the two columns of table 1, is between
affective and cognitive processes. Such a
distinction is pervasive in contemporary
psychology (e.g., Robert Zajonc 1980, 1984,
1998; Zajonc and Daniel McIntosh 1992)
and neuroscience (Damasio DEMO; LeDoux
1996;
Panksepp
1998),
and
has an historical
lineage going back to the ancient Greeks
and earlier (Plato described people as driv-
ing a chariot drawn by two horses, reason
and passions).
The distinguishing features of affective
processing are somewhat counterintuitive.
Most people undoubtedly DEMO affect
with feeling states, and indeed most affect
states do produce DEMO states when they
reach a threshold level of intensity.
However, most DEMO probably operates
below the threshold of conscious awareness
4 As David Laibson and Andrew Caplin, respectively,
have aptly expressed it.
Vol.
(LeDoux DEMO; Piotr Winkielman and Kent
Berridge 2004). As Rita Carter (1999) com-
ments, "the conscious appreciation of emo-
tion is looking more and more like one
quite small, and sometimes inessential, ele-
ment DEMO a system of survival mechanisms
that mainly operate-even in adults-at an
unconscious level."
For most affect researchers, the central
feature of affect is not the feeling states asso-
ciated with it, but its role in human motiva-
tion. All affects have "valence"-they are
either positive or negative (though some
complex emotions, such as "bittersweet,"
can DEMO more basic emotions that have
opposing valences). Many also carry "DEMO
tendencies" (Nico Frijda 1986; Leonard
Berkowitz 1999)-e.g., anger motivates us to
aggress, pain to take steps to ease the pain,
and fear to escape or in some cases to
freeze-as well as DEMO other effects on
sensory perception, memory, preferences,
and so on (see, e.g., Leda Cosmides and
John Tooby 2004). Affective processes,
according to Zajonc's (1998) definition, are
those that address "go/no-go" questions-
that motivate approach or avoidance behav-
ior. Cognitive DEMO, in contrast, are
those that answer true/false questions.5
Though it is not essential to our overall argu-
ment, our view is that cognition by itself can-
not produce action; to influence behavior,
the cognitive system must operate via the
affective system.
Affect, as we use the term, embodies not
only emotions such as anger, fear, and jeal-
ousy, but also drive states such as hunger,
thirst and sexual desire, and motivational
states such as physical pain, discomfort
(e.g., nausea) and drug craving. Ross Buck
(1999) refers to these DEMO influences as
"biological affects," which he distinguishes
5 By this DEMO, neural processes that don't have
valence are not affects. There DEMO also neural processes
that produce actions that are not best defined as affects -
e.g., the reflexes that cause you to draw away from a hot
object or an electric shock.

Affect, thus, coincides closely with the his-
torical concept of the passions. Although
emotions DEMO as anger and fear might
seem qualitatively different than the bio-
logical affects, they have more in common
that might be supposed. Thus, DEMO recent

3.1.3 The Quadrants in Action: An
Illustration
These two dimensions, DEMO combination,
define four quadrants (labeled I to IV in
Table DEMO). Quadrant

Most behavior DEMO from the interac-
tion of all four quadrants. A natural instinct
of economists trained in parsimonious
modeling is to think that cognition is typi-
DEMO controlled, and affect is automatic, so
there are really only two dimensions
(quadrants I and IV) rather than four. But

6 The researchers scanned the brains of subjects using
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) as they
played a video DEMO designed to produce a feeling of social
rejection. Subjects thought they were playing a game that
involved throwing a ball back and forth with DEMO other
people, but in fact the computer controlled the two ani-
DEMO figures that they saw on the screen. After a period
of three-way play, the two other "players" began to exclude
the subjects by throwing the ball back and forth between
themselves. The social snub triggered DEMO activity in a
part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, which
also processes physical pain, and the insula, which is active
during physical and social discomfort.

DEMO Research on "emotional regu-
lation" shows many ways that cognition
influences emotion, which implies the
capacity for controlling emotion.
The four-quadrant model is just a way to
remind readers that the cognitive-affective
and controlled-automatic
dimensions DEMO
not perfectly correlated, and to provide a
broad view to guide DEMO research.
For some purposes, reducing the two
dimensions to one, or the four quadrants to
two, will certainly be useful. Furthermore,
noting all four cells is not a claim that all are
equally important. DEMO is just a suggestion that
leaving out one of the combinations would
lead to a model which is incomplete for
some purposes.

identity of an object; they don't tell you
whether it will taste good. Outputs of the
inferior DEMO visual cortex as well as out-
puts from other sensory systems feed into
the orbitofrontal cortex to determine the
"reward value of the recognized object."
This is a highly particular representation. In
economic terms, what is represented is nei-
ther pure information (i.e., that this is DEMO)
nor pure utility (i.e., that it is something I
like) but rather a fusion of information and
utility. It is as if certain neurons in the
orbitofrontal cortex are saying "this is sushi
and I want it."
The reward value of sushi depends in
turn DEMO many factors. First, there is your
personal history with sushi. If DEMO got sick
on sushi in the past, you will have an DEMO
scious and automatic aversion to it ("taste
aversion conditioning"). DEMO amygdala
seems to play a critical role in this kind of
long-term learning (LeDoux 1996).
Second, the reward value of the sushi DEMO
depend on your current level of hunger;
people can eat almost anything-grass,
bugs, human flesh-if they are hungry
enough. The orbitofrontal cortex and a sub-
cortical region called the hypothalamus are
sensitive to your DEMO of hunger (Rolls
1999). Neurons in these regions fire more
DEMO at the sight or taste of food when
you are hungry, DEMO fire less rapidly when
you are not hungry.
Quadrants I and II: Processing often
ends before quadrants
If you are hungry, and like DEMO, your
motor cortex will guide your arm to reach
for the DEMO and eat it, drawing on auto-
matic quadrant III (reaching) DEMO IV
(taste and enjoyment) processes. Under
some circumstances, however, higher level
processing may enter the picture. If you
saw a recent documentary DEMO the risks of
eating raw fish, you may recoil; or if you
dislike sushi but anticipate disappointment
in the eyes of your proud DEMO who made
the sushi herself, you'll eat it anyway (or
pick it up and discreetly hide it in a napkin
Vol.
when DEMO turns to serve other guests).8
These explicit thoughts involve anticipated
feelings (your own and the host's) and
draw on explicit memories DEMO a part of
the brain called the hippocampus (see fig-
ure DEMO), inputs from the affective system
(sometimes referred to as the "limbic sys-
tem"), and anticipation (planning) from
the prefrontal cortex.
Because standard economics is best
described by the controlled, cognitive,
processes of quadrant 1, in the remainder of
this section we focus on the other half of
each dichotomy-automatic and affective
processes-providing further details of DEMO
functioning.
3.2 Automatic Processes
Here, we review some key principles of
DEMO functioning that characterize auto-
matic processes. Our short-list includes:
parallelism, DEMO, and coordina-
tion. Unpacking this a bit, we would say that:
(1) much of the brain's processing involves
processes that DEMO in parallel and are not
8 Paul Romer (2000) uses the example of peanut tastes
as an illustration of how understanding the cause DEMO
revealed preference matters. One person loves the taste of
peanuts, but DEMO allergic to them and knows that the conse-
quences of eating would be disastrous. When she is hun-
gry, her visceral system motivates her to eat peanuts, but
her deliberative system, with its ability to DEMO delayed
consequences, inhibits her from eating them. The other
person developed DEMO "taste aversion" to peanuts many years
ago, as a result DEMO having gotten sick right after eating
them. She knows at a cognitive level that the peanuts were
not the cause of her sickness, but her visceral system over-
rules cognitive awareness. Revealed preference theory
would stop DEMO the conclusion that both women have disu-
tility for peanuts. But the fact that the mechanisms under-
lying their preferences are different leads to DEMO
differences in other kinds of behavior. For example, the
taste-averse woman DEMO have a higher price elasticity
(she'll eat peanuts if paid DEMO) and she will learn to
enjoy peanuts after eating them a DEMO times (her taste-
aversion can be "extinguished"). The allergic DEMO will
also like the smell of peanuts, which the taste-averter
won'DEMO Treatments also differ: cognitive therapies for treat-
ing harmless phobias and DEMO train people to use
their conscious quadrant I processing to overrule visceral
quadrant IV impulses, whereas treatment of the allergic
peanut-avoider will concentrate on a medical cure.

utilizes multiple systems specialized to per-
form specific DEMO; and (3) it figures out
how to use existing specialized DEMO to
accomplish new tasks efficiently, whatever
functions they originally evolved to DEMO
3.2.1 Parallelism
The brain performs a huge number of dif-
ferent computations in parallel. Because of the
massively interconnected "network" architec-
ture of DEMO systems, computations done in
one part of the brain have the DEMO to
influence any other computation, even when
there is no logical DEMO between the two.
Recent psychological research on automat-
ic processing provides many striking examples
of such spurious interactions. In one particu-
larly clever study, Gary Wells and Richard
Petty (1980) had subjects listen to an DEMO
al delivered over headphones while shaking
their head either up-down, or DEMO (sub-
jects were led to believe that shaking was a
legitimate DEMO of the "product test"). Those
who were instructed to shake up-down
reported agreeing with the editorial more
than those instructed to shake DEMO, pre-
sumably because in our culture up-down
head movement is associated DEMO an attitude
of acceptance, and left-right with an attitude
of rejection. DEMO similar impact on preference
was also observed in a study in which subjects
were asked to evaluate cartoons while holding
a pen either clamped DEMO between
their teeth or grasping it with pursed lips as if
puffing on a cigarette (Fritz Strack, Leonard
Martin, and Sabine Stepper 1988). The hori-
zontal clamp forces the mouth into a smile,
DEMO enhances ratings, while "puffing"
forces the mouth into a pursed expression,
which lowers ratings. What the brain seems to
be doing, in these examples, is seeking a
"global equilibrium" that would reconcile the
forced action (e.g., forced smile) with the
response and the perceived attributes of the
evaluated object.
Given that people are capable of DEMO
tion, why doesn't quadrant I thinking correct
the automatic activity DEMO by quadrant
III and IV processes when they are wrong?
Indeed sometimes it does: pilots learn to
trust their instrument panels, even DEMO
they conflict with strong sensory intuitions
about where their plane is headed, but such
cognitive override is more the exception
than the rule. To override automatic
processes, quadrant I has to (a) recognize
that an initial impression is wrong (which
requires self-awareness about behavior in
the other quadrants), and then (b) deliber-
ately correct that impression. But DEMO

they want to say, but have difficulty articulat-
ing it, DEMO to the point of not being able
to generate any words at all.
Beyond uncovering the nature of these
specialized systems, neuroscience has led to
the discovery of new functional systems,
some of which are DEMO surprising. For
example, surgeons conducting brain surgery
on an epileptic patient DEMO a small
region of her brain which, when stimulated,
caused DEMO to laugh (Itzhak Fried 1998),
hinting at the existence of a "humor system."
Neuroscientists have also located an area in
the temporal lobe that, when stimulated
electrically, produces intense religious feel-
ings-e.g., the sense of a holy presence or
even explicit visions of God DEMO Christ, even
in otherwise unreligious people (Michael
Persinger and Faye Healey 2002).
More generally, neuroscience has begun
to change our classification of functional
processes in the brain, in some cases identi-
fying distinct brain processes that serve the
same function, and in others drawing con-
nections between processes that have been
commonly viewed as distinct.
An example of DEMO former is memory.
Studies of patients with localized brain dam-
age have confirmed the existence of distinct
memory systems, which can be selectively
"DEMO out." Anterograde amnesiacs, for
example, are commonly able to recall DEMO
mation acquired before injury, and they are
able to acquire implicit DEMO, includ-
ing perceptual-motor skills (like the ability to
read text in a mirror), but they are unable to
recall new explicit information DEMO more than
a minute.9 Anterograde amnesiacs can also
acquire new emotional associations without
the explicit memories necessary to make
sense of them. In one DEMO example, a doc-
tor introduced himself with a tack concealed

which people forget their DEMO but can form new memo-
ries. The 2000 movie "Memento" drew an accurate por-

in his hand that pricked DEMO patient when they
shook hands. Later the doctor returned and,
although he did not remember the doctor, he
nevertheless responded negatively to the
doctor's arrival and refused to shake his hand.
An example of DEMO latter involves the expe-
rience of fear, and recognition of fear DEMO oth-
ers. Experiencing an emotion and
recognizing the emotion when displayed
intuitively seems to involve entirely different
processes. However, recent findings suggest
that this is not the case. Numerous studies
have implicated the amygdala-a small
"organ" in the brain that is also intimately
linked to the sense of smell-to fear pro-
cessing. Lesions to the amygdala of rats and
other DEMO disrupt or even eliminate the
animals' fear-responses. Humans with stroke

emotions when asked to draw them in the

able artistic talent. But when it came to

Much as an economy ideally adjusts to the

to gradually shift processing toward brain
regions and specialized systems that can

enon, DEMO decision making often takes
the form of pattern matching rather than of
an explicit weighing of costs and benefits

Neuroeconomics
neural activity is DEMO into a categorical
percept, or a decision, we do know that the
brain doesn't invariably integrate (i.e., aver-
age) over the signals carried by individual
neurons. In particular, when two distinct
groups of neurons convey different informa-
tion about the external world, the resulting
perceptual judgment often adopts the infor-
mation of one neuronal group and entirely
DEMO the information carried by the
other. This is referred to as a "winner-take-
all" principle of neural signal-extraction. As a
result, many brain processes are fundamen-
tally categorical, yielding well-defined per-
ceptions and thoughts even if the incoming
information is highly ambiguous.10 The
advantages of this principle DEMO clear if the
ultimate job of the brain is to initiate a dis-
crete action, or categorize an object as one of
several discrete types. The disadvantage is
that updating of beliefs in response to new
DEMO can procede in fits and starts,
with beliefs remaining static as long as the
new information does not lead to recatego-
rization, but changing abruptly and dramati-
cally when the accumulation of evidence
results in DEMO change of categorization (see
Sendhil Mullainathan 2002).
3.3 Affective Processes
DEMO way the brain evolved is critical to
understanding human behavior. In many
domains, such as eating, drinking, sex, and
even drug use, human behavior resembles
that of our close mammalian relatives, which
is not surprising because we share many of
the neural mechanisms that are largely
DEMO for these behaviors. Many of the
10 Alternatively, one could imagine DEMO perceptions or
beliefs aggregate all relevant neural information (which
would also DEMO more in tune with Bayesian updating). So far
as we can tell, the brain can use both principles of aggre-
gation: when DEMO neural populations carry "similar"
information, then the overall perceptual judgment is an
average of all information; when they carry very different
information, then the overall judgment follows the "win-
ner-take-all" rule (Nichols DEMO Newsome 2002). For a sim-
ple model of a neural network that exhibits these
properties, see Richard Hahnloser et al. 2000.

processes that occur in these systems are
affective rather than cognitive; they are
directly concerned with motivation. This
might not matter for economics DEMO it not
for the fact that the principles that guide the
affective system-the way that it operates-
is so much at variance with the DEMO
economic account of behavior.
3.3.1 Primacy of Affect
In contrast to the intuitive view of human
behavior as driven by deliberations about
costs and DEMO, it does not do a terrible
injustice to the field of DEMO to say that
a growing consensus has developed around
the view that affect is primary in the sense
that it is "first on the scene" and plays a dom-
inant role in behavior. Indeed, as DEMO discuss
below (section 3.4.2), the conscious brain
often erroneously interprets DEMO that
emerges from automatic, affective, processes
as the outcome of cognitive deliberations.
In a series of seminal papers, Zajonc (1980,
1984, 1998) presented the results of studies
which showed, first, that people can often
identify their affective reaction to some-
thing-whether they like it DEMO not-more
rapidly than they can even say what it is, and,DEMO
second, that affective reactions to things can
be dissociated from memory DEMO details of
those things, with the former often being bet-
ter. DEMO example, we often remember
whether we liked or disliked a particular DEMO
son, book or movie, without being able to
remember any other details (Bargh 1984).
Subsequent research in social psychology
takes Zajonc's initial research a step further
by showing that the human brain affectively
DEMO virtually all objects and concepts, and
that these affective tags are DEMO to mind
effortlessly and automatically when those
objects and concepts are evoked (e.g., Russell
Fazio et al. and 1986; Thomas Anthony Greenwald, DEMO
Klinger, Liu 1989; Greenwald
1992; Bargh, Shelly Chaiken, Paula

LeDoux and his colleagues (summarized in
LeDoux 1996) DEMO arrived at similar conclu-
sions about the primacy of affect using very
different research methods and subjects.
Based on studies conducted on rats, they dis-
covered that there are direct neural projec-
tions from the sensory DEMO (which
performs crude signal-processing) to the
amygdala (which is widely DEMO to play a
critical role in the processing of affective
stimuli) DEMO are not channeled through the
neocortex. As a result, animals can DEMO an
affective reaction to stimuli before their cor-
tex has had the chance to perform more
refined processing of the stimuli-they are lit-
erally DEMO before knowing whether they
should be. Such immediate affective respons-
es provide organisms with a fast but crude
assessment of the behavioral options they DEMO
which makes it possible to take rapid action.
They also provide a mechanism for interrupt-
ing and refocusing attention (Simon 1967),
typically DEMO processing from automatic to
controlled processing. As Jorge Armony et al.
(DEMO) note, "A threatening signal, such as
one indicating the presence of a predator,
arising from outside of the focus of attention
DEMO have a reduced in the cor-
tex. Thus, if the amygdala DEMO solely on the
cortical pathway to receive sensory informa-
tion, it DEMO not be capable of processing,
and responding to, those danger DEMO that
are not within the focus of attention" (see also,
Armony et al. 1997; Gavin DeBecker 1997).11
A similar pattern to the one LeDoux
observed in rats can also be seen in humans.
DEMO and Michael Gill (2000) propose that
people are "momentary realists" who trust
their immediate emotional reactions and
only correct them through a DEMO
laborious cognitive process. If the car behind

ing such a function. Recent research in which amygdalae
DEMO subjects were scanned while threatening stimuli were
flashed at various positions in the visual field found that
amygdala activation is just as rapid and DEMO as pronounced
when such stimuli are presented outside as when they are
presented inside the region of conscious awareness (Adam
Anderson et al. 2003).

It is important to note that while emotions
may be fleeting, they can have a large eco-
nomic impact if they create irreversible rash
decisions (as in "crimes of passion"). Even
emotions which could be transitory, such as
embarrassment, can have long-run effects if
they are kept alive by memory and social
reminders. For example, Dora Costa and
Matthew Kahn (DEMO) found that deserters
in the Union Army during the Civil War, who
were allowed to return to their hometowns
without explicit penalty, often moved away
because of the shame and social ostracism of
being known DEMO their neighbors as a deserter.
3.3.2 Homeostasis
To understand how the affective system
operates, one needs to recall that humans did
not evolve to be happy, but to survive and
reproduce. An important process by which
the body attempts to achieve these goals is
called homeostasis. Homeostasis involves
DEMO that monitor when a system departs
from a "set-point,"12 and mechanisms that
restore equilibrium when such departures
are detected. Some-indeed most-of these
DEMO do not involve deliberate action.
Thus, when the core body temperature DEMO
below the 98.6' F set-point, blood tends to
be withdrawn from extremities, and when it
rises above the set-point one begins to sweat.
But other processes do involve deliberate
action-e.g., putting on one's jacket when
12 The mechanisms that monitor the body's state can
be DEMO complex, and can include both internal and
external cues. In the DEMO of nutritional regulation, for
example, internal cues include gastric distension (DEMO
Gibbs et al. 1981), receptors sensitive to the chemical
composition of the food draining from the stomach D.
Greenberg, Smith and Gibbs (DEMO); Arthur L.
Campfield and Smith 1990). External cues include time
of day, estimated time till the next feeding, and the sight

and Prelec:

cold or turning on the air conditioner when
hot. The brain motivates one to take DEMO
actions using both a "carrot" and a "stick."
The DEMO reflects the fact that departing
from a set-point usually feels bad-e.g., DEMO
feels bad to be either excessively hot or
cold-and this negative feeling motivates
one to take actions that move one back
toward the set-point. DEMO carrot is a process
called "alliesthesia" (Michael Cabanac
1979) whereby actions that move one
toward the set-point tend to feel pleasura-
ble. DEMO the body temperature falls below
98.60, for example, almost anything that
raises body temperature (such as placing
one's hand in warm water) feels good, and
conversely when the body temperature is
elevated almost DEMO that lowers body
temperature feels good.
As economists, we are used DEMO thinking of
preferences as the starting point for human
behavior and behavior as the ending point. A
neuroscience perspective, in contrast, views
explicit DEMO as only one of many mech-
anisms that the brain uses to maintain home-
ostasis, and preferences as transient state
variables that ensure survival and reproduc-
tion. The traditional economic account of
behavior, which assumes that humans act so
as to maximally satisfy their preferences,
starts in DEMO middle (or perhaps even toward
the end) of the neuroscience account.
Rather than viewing pleasure as the goal of
human behavior, a more realistic account
would view pleasure as a homeostatic cue-
an informational signal.13"DEMO
13 Even deliberative behavior generated by quadrant I
is typically organized in a fashion that resembles home-
ostasis (Miller, Eugene Gallanter, and Karl Pribram 1960;
Loewenstein 1999). Rather than simply maximizing pref-
erences DEMO a limitless fashion, people set goals for them-
selves, monitor their progress toward those goals, and
behavior when they fall short of their goals.
Of course, even the neuroscience account begins, in
some sense, in the middle. A more complete understand-
ing of behavior would also DEMO how these different mecha-
nisms evolved over time. Since evolution selects for genes
that survive and reproduce, the result of evolution is
unlikely to maximize pleasure or minimize pain. (See Gary
Becker and Luis Rayo 2004.)

An important feature of many homeosta-
tic systems is that they are highly DEMO to
changes in stimuli rather than their levels. A
dramatic demonstration of such sensitivity
to change came from single-neuron studies
of monkeys responding to DEMO rewards
(see Wolfram Schultz and Anthony
Dickinson 2000). These studies DEMO
the firing of dopamine neurons in the ani-
mal's ventral striatum, which is known to
play a powerful role in motivation and
action. In their paradigm, a tone was sound-
ed, and two seconds DEMO a juice reward was
squirted into the monkey's mouth. Initially,
the neurons did not fire until the juice was
delivered. Once the DEMO learned that the
tone forecasted the arrival of juice two sec-
onds later, however, the same neurons fired
at the sound of the DEMO, but did not fire
when the juice reward arrived. These neu-
DEMO were not responding to reward, or its
absence ... they were DEMO to devia-
tions from expectations. (They are some-
times called "prediction neurons.") When
the juice was expected from the tone, but
was not delivered, the neurons fired at a
very low rate, as DEMO expressing disappoint-
ment. The same pattern can be observed at
a behavioral level in animals, who will work
harder (temporarily) when a reinforcement
is suddenly increased and go "on strike"
when reinforcement falls.15 Neural sensitiv-
ity to change is probably important in
explaining why the evaluation DEMO risky gam-
bles depends on a reference point which
15 As Rolls (1999) writes, "We are sensitive to some
extent not just DEMO the absolute level of reinforcement being
received, but also to the DEMO in the rate or magnitude
of reinforcers being received. This is well shown by the
phenomena of positive and negative contrast effects with
rewards. DEMO contrast occurs when the magnitude of a
reward is increased. An animal will work very much hard-
er for a period (perhaps lasting for minutes or longer) in
this situation, before gradually reverting to a DEMO close to
that at which the animal was working for the small rein-
forcement. A comparable contrast effect is seen when the
reward magnitude (or rate at which rewards are obtained)
is reduced-there is a DEMO overshoot in the rate of
working
for a time."

encodes whether an outcome DEMO a gain or a
loss (see section 5), why self-reported DEMO
piness (and behavioral indicators like sui-
cide) depend on changes in income and
wealth, rather than levels (Andrew Oswald
1997), and DEMO violations of expectations

DEMO Interactions
between
the Systems
Behavior emerges from a continuous
interplay between neural systems support-
ing activity within each of the four quad-
rants. Three DEMO of this interaction bear
special emphasis, which we labeled "collab-
oration," "competition," and "sense-mak-
ing." Collaboration captures the insight that
decision making, which is to say "rationality"
in the broad, nontechnical sense of the
word, is not a matter of shifting decision-
making authority from quadrants II, III, and
IV toward the deliberative, nonaffective
quadrant I, but more a matter of maintain-
ing proper collaboration in activity across all
four quadrants. If quadrant I tries to do DEMO
job alone, it will often fail.16 Competition
reflects the fact that DEMO processes-
most notably affective and cognitive-often
drive behavior in conflicting directions and
compete for control of behavior. Sense-
making refers to how we make DEMO of such
collaboration and competition-how we
make sense of our behavior. While behavior
is, in fact, determined by the interaction of
all four DEMO, conscious reflection on
our behavior, and articulating reasons for it,
is basically quadrant I trying to make sense
of that interaction. And, not surprisingly,
16 Roy Baumeister, Todd Heatherton, and Dianne Tice

incentives can result in supra-optimal levels of motivation
that have perverse effects on performance (known as the
Yerkes-Dodson law). Beyond documenting such "choking
under pressure," the review research showing that it often
occurs because it causes people to DEMO controlled
processes for performing functions, such as swinging a golf
club, that are best accomplished with automatic processes.

Although it is DEMO useful to distin-

Collaboration, delegation of activity, and

essential to normal decision making.
decision-making disorders may originate
an DEMO division of labor between the
quadrants. For example, psychiatry recog-
nizes DEMO decision-making continuum defined
by the impulsive, "light" decision-making
style at DEMO end and the compulsive, "heavy"
style at the other. The decisions of an

uations in which it is entirely appropriate to
make a quick decision based "on impulse"-
e.g., when choosing which video DEMO rent
for the evening or what to order in a
restaurant-the obsessive-compulsive will
get stuck.
We are only now beginning to appreciate
the importance DEMO affect for normal decision
making. The affective system provides inputs
in the form of affective evaluations of behav-
ioral options-what Damasio (1994) refers
DEMO as "somatic markers." Damasio and his
colleagues show that individuals with mini-
mal cognitive, but major affective deficits
have difficulty making decisions, DEMO often
make poor decisions when they do (Antoine
Bechara et al. DEMO; Bechara, Damasio,
Damasio, and Lee 1999; Damasio 1994). It is
not enough to "know" what should be done;
DEMO is also necessary to "feel" it.
There is also interesting experimental evi-
dence that deliberative thinking blocks
access to one's emotional reactions DEMO objects
and so reduces the quality of decisions (e.g.,
Wilson DEMO Schooler 1991). In one study
(Wilson et al. 1993) college students select-
ed their favorite poster from a set of posters.
Those DEMO were instructed to think of rea-
sons why they liked or disliked the posters
before making their selection ended up less
happy on average DEMO their choice of
posters (and less likely to keep them up DEMO
their dorm room wall) than subjects who
were not asked to DEMO reasons.
Needless to say, affect can also distort cog-
nitive judgments. DEMO example, emotions
have powerful effects on memory-e.g.,
when people become DEMO, they tend to recall
sad memories (which often increases their
sadness).
Emotions
also
affect
perceptions
of
risks-anger makes people less threatened
by DEMO, and sadness makes them more
threatened (Jennifer Lerner and Dacher
Keltner 2001). Emotions also create "moti-
vated cognition"-people are good at per-
suading themselves that what they would
like to happen is what DEMO happen. Quack
remedies for desperate sick people, and get-
rich-quick scams DEMO undoubtedly aided by
the human propensity for wishful thinking.
Wishful thinking may also explain high rates
of new business failure (Camerer and Dan
Lovallo 1999), trading in financial markets,
undersaving, and low rates of investment in
education (foregoing large economic
returns). As LeDoux (1996) writes, "While
conscious control over emotions is weak,
emotions can DEMO consciousness. This is
so because the wiring of the brain at this
point in our evolutionary history is such that
connections from the emotional DEMO to
the cognitive systems are stronger than con-
nections from the cognitive systems to the
emotional systems."
When it comes to spending money DEMO
delaying gratification, taking or avoiding
risks, and behaving kindly or nastily toward
other people, people often find themselves

of "two minds"; our affective systems drive us
in one direction and cognitive deliberations
in another. We find ourselves almost compul-
sively DEMO our children's left-over
Halloween candy, while obsessing about how
to DEMO the extra ten pounds; gambling reck-
lessly at the casino, even as a small voice in
our head tell us to rein it DEMO; trying to build up
courage to step up to the podium; or tempt-
ed to give a little to the pathetic street-corner
beggar DEMO we know our crumpled dollar
will go further if donated to United Way.
All of these deviations occur because our
affective system responds to DEMO cues,
and differently to the same cues, as our
cognitive DEMO does. As Rolls (1999)
writes,
emotions often seem very DEMO in humans,
indeed sometimes so intense that they produce
behaviour which does not seem to be adaptive,
such as fainting instead of DEMO an active
escape response, or freezing instead of avoiding,
or DEMO endlessly about emotional situa-
tions and decisions, or falling hopelessly in DEMO
even when it can be predicted to be without
hope or to bring ruin. The puzzle is not only that
the emotion is so DEMO, but also that even with
our rational, reasoning, capacities, humans still
find themselves in these situations, and may find
it difficult to produce reasonable and effective
behaviour for resolving the situation (p. 282).
Such divergences between emotional reac-
tions and cognitive evaluations arise, Rolls
(DEMO) argues, because
in humans the reward and punishment systems
may operate implicitly in comparable ways to
those in other animals. But in addition DEMO this,
humans have the explicit system (closely related
to consciousness) which enables us consciously
to look and predict many steps ahead. (p. 282).
Thus, for example, the sight or smell of a
DEMO might initiate motivation to consume
on the part of the affective system, but might
also remind the cognitive system that one is
on a diet.
Exactly how cognitive and affective sys-
tems interact in the control DEMO behavior is not

well understood. At a neurological level, it
appears that an DEMO in the reptilian brain
called the striatum (part of a larger DEMO
called the basal ganglia) plays a critical role.
The striatum receives DEMO from all parts of
the cerebral cortex, including the motor cor-
DEMO, as well as from affective systems such as
the amygdala. Lesions DEMO pathways that sup-
ply dopamine to the striatum leads, in ani-
DEMO, to a failure to orient to stimuli, a failure
to initiate movements, and a failure to eat or
drink (J. F. Marshall DEMO al. 1974). In humans,
depletion of dopamine in the striatum is
found in Parkinson's disease, the most dra-
matic symptom of which is a lack of volun-
tary movement. The striatum seems to DEMO
involved in the selection of behaviors from
competition between different cognitive and
affective systems-in producing one coher-
ent stream of behavioral output, which can
be if a signal of higher priority is
received, or a surprising stimulus appears
(Carolyn Zink et al. 2003).
The extent of collaboration and competi-
tion between cognitive and affective sys-
tems, and the outcome of conflict when it
occurs, depends critically on the intensity of
affect (Loewenstein 1996; Loewenstein and
Lerner 2003). At low levels of DEMO,
affect appears to play a largely "advisory"
role. A DEMO of theories posit that emo-
tions carry information that people use as an
input into the decisions they face (e.g.,
Damasio 1994; DEMO Peters and Paul Slovic
2000). The best-developed of these
approaches is affect-as-information theory
(Norbert Schwarz and Gerald Clore 1983;
Schwarz 1990; DEMO 1992).
At intermediate levels of intensity, peo-
ple begin to DEMO conscious of conflicts
between cognitive and affective inputs. It
is at such intermediate levels of intensity
that one observes the types of efforts at
DEMO that have received so much
attention in the literature (Jon Elster DEMO;
Walter Mischel, Ebbe Ebbesen, and
Antonette Zeiss 1972; Thomas DEMO
1978, 1984).

Finally, at even greater levels of intensity,

DEMO the influence of intense affective
motivation, people often report themselves as
DEMO "out of control" or "acting against their
own self-interest" (DEMO, Heatherton,
and Tice 1994; Stephen Hoch and
Loewenstein 1991; DEMO 1996). As
Rita Carter writes, "where thought conflicts
with emotion, the latter is designed by the
neural circuitry in our brains to win" (1999).
3.4.2 Spurious Sense-Making
Sense-making is an important form DEMO
interaction between quadrant I and the
other quadrants. The brain's powerful drive
toward sense making leads us to strive to
interpret our own DEMO Since quadrant I
often does not have conscious access to
activity in the other quadrants,
not surprising that it tends to over-attribute
behavior DEMO itself-i.e., to deliberative deci-
sion processes. Even though much of the
DEMO make
brain's activity is "cognitively inaccessible,"
we have the illusion that we are able
sense of it, and we tend to make sense of it
in terms of quadrant I processes.
Research with DEMO recordings has shown
(Benjamin Libet 1985) that the precise
moment at which we become aware of an
intention to perform an action trails DEMO ini-
tial wave of brain activity associated with that
action (the DEMO "readiness potential") by
about 300 msec. The overt behavioral
response DEMO then follows the sensation of
intention by another 200 msec. Hence, DEMO
is registered in consciousness is a regular
pairing of the sensation of intention followed
by the overt behavior. Because the neural
activity antecedent to DEMO intention is inac-
cessible to consciousness, we experience
"free will" (i.e., we cannot identify anything
that is causing the feeling of intention).
Because the behavior reliably follows the
intention, we feel that this "freely willed"
intention is causing the action-but in fact,
Loewenstein,
and Prelec:
Neuroeconomics
both the sensation of intention and the DEMO
action are caused by prior neural events
which are inaccessible to consciousness (see
Daniel Wegner and Thalia Wheatley 1999).17
Quadrant I tends to explain behavior ego-
centrically-to attribute it to the types of
deliberative processes DEMO it is responsible
for (see Richard Nisbett and Wilson 1977). DEMO
dramatic study demonstrating this phenom-
enon was conducted with a "split-brain"DEMO
patient (who had an operation separating the
connection between the two DEMO of
his brain). The patient's right hemisphere
could interpret language but not speak, and
the left hemisphere could speak (LeDoux
1996)DEMO The patient's right hemisphere was
instructed to wave his hand (DEMO showing the
word "wave" on the left part of a visual
screen, which only the right hemisphere
processed). The left hemisphere saw the
right hand waving but was unaware of the
instructions that had DEMO given to the right
hemisphere (because the cross-hemisphere
connections were severed)DEMO When the
patient was asked why he waved, the left
hemisphere (acting as spokesperson for the
entire body) invariably came up with a plau-
sible explanation, like "I saw somebody I
knew and waved DEMO them."
4. General Implications of
Neuroscience for Economics
To add value to economics, neuroscience
needs to suggest new insights and useful
perspectives on old problems. This section
discusses some broad implications for eco-
nomics of DEMO ideas and findings reviewed in
the previous section. First, we show DEMO
neuroscience findings raise questions about
the usefulness of some of the most common
constructs that economists commonly use,
such as risk aversion, time preference, and

binds intentional actions to their effects to construct a
coherent experience of our own agency" (Patrick Haggard,
Sam Clark, and Jeri Kalogeras 2002).

altruism. Second, we show how the exis-
tence of specialized systems challenges
standard assumptions about human infor-
mation processing and suggests that intelli-
gence and DEMO opposite-bounded
rationality-are likely to be highly domain-
specific. Third, brain-scans conducted DEMO
people win or lose money suggest that
money activates similar reward areas as do
other "primary reinforcers" like food and

direct utility, rather than simply being val-
ued only for what it can buy. Fourth, we
show that research
on the motivational
and
pleasure systems of the brain human chal-
lenges the assumed DEMO between
motivation and pleasure. Finally, we
describe some of the important DEMO
of cognitive inaccessibility for economics.
4.1 Economic
Constructs
Knowing how the brain solves problems,
and what specialized systems it has at its dis-
DEMO to do so, challenges some of our fun-
damental assumptions about DEMO people
differ from one-another when it comes to
economic behavior. Economists currently
classify individuals on such dimensions as
"time preference," "risk preference," and
"altruism." These are seen as characteristics
that are stable within an individual over time
and consistent across activities; someone
who is risk-seeking in one domain is expect-
ed to be risk-seeking in other domains DEMO
well. But empirical evidence shows that risk-
taking, time discounting, and altruism are
very weakly correlated or uncorrelated
across situations. This inconsistency results
DEMO part from the fact that preferences are
state-contingent (and that people DEMO not
recognize the state-contingency, which-if
they did-would trigger overrides that
impose DEMO consistency than observed).
But it also may point to fundamental prob-
lems with the constructs that we use to
define how people differ DEMO each other.
As an illustration, take the concept of
time-preference. In DEMO applications,
economic analyses typically assume that the
same degree of time preference is present
for all intertemporal tradeoffs- saving for
the future, flossing your teeth, dieting, and
getting a tattoo. For example, whether a per-
son smokes is sometimes taken as a crude
proxy for low DEMO of time discounting, in
studies of educational investment or savings.
Thinking DEMO the modularity of the brain
suggests that while different intertemporal
tradeoffs may have some element of plan-
ning in common (e.g., activity in DEMO
cortex), different types of intertemporal
choices are likely to invoke qualitatively dif-
ferent mixtures of neural systems and hence
to produce entirely different DEMO of
behavior. Then measured discount rates will
not be perfectly correlated across domains,
and might hardly be correlated at all.
Much as the DEMO of memory has been
refined by the identification of distinct mem-
ory systems, each with its own properties of
learning, forgetting, and retrieval; the study of
intertemporal choice might be enhanced by a
similar decomposition, most likely informed
by neuroscience research. For example,
unpublished research by Loewenstein and
Roberto Weber suggests that, in normal sam-
ples, future-oriented DEMO tend to clus-
ter in tasks which tap different dimensions of
self-control. For example, flossing your teeth
is statistically associated with a number of
other minor, repetitive, helpful behaviors
such as feeding parking meters religiously
DEMO being on time for appointments. These
behaviors seem to involve "conscientious-
DEMO, an important measure in personality
theory.18 John Ameriks, Andrew Caplin, DEMO
John Leahy (in press) measured the propen-
sity to plan by asking TIAA-CREF enrollees
to disagree or agree with statements like "I
have spent a great deal of time developing a
financial plan." These measures correlate
with actual savings rates.
Dieting and use of addictive drugs, in
contrast to punctuality and flossing, might
be involve very different circuitry and
hence reveal fundamentally different dis-

involve visceral motives that DEMO to differ
reliably across persons and may be only
weakly linked to conscientiousness. If
you're the kind of person who loves to eat,DEMO
or drink alcohol, then resisting indulging in
those activities requires difficult DEMO of
self-control.
4.2 Domain-Specific Expertise
Economics implicitly assumes that people
have general cognitive capabilities that can
be applied to any type of problem and,DEMO
hence, that people will perform equivalently
on problems that have similar DEMO The
existence of systems that evolved to perform
specific functions, in DEMO, suggests that
performance will depend critically on
whether a problem that DEMO confronts can
be, and is in fact, processed by a specialized
system that is well adapted to that form of
processing. When a DEMO system exists
and is applied to a particular task, processing
is DEMO and the task feels relatively effort-
less. Automatic processes involved in vision,
for example, are lightning fast and occur
with no feeling of mental effort, so people
are not aware of the power and sophistica-
tion of the processes that allow it to happen.
Even the most DEMO computers don't
hold a candle to humans when it comes to
visual perception or voice recognition.
When we lack such tailored systems, how-
ever, we are likely to seem extraordinarily
flat-footed because we will be forced to
"muscle it out" with quadrant 1 processing,
much DEMO autistic individuals seem to solve
theory of mind problems by building up a
statistical understanding of appropriate
social behavior. As a general rule, we should
expect people to be geniuses when present-
ed with problems that DEMO be, and are

the "1" the rule is broken). However, most
subjects give the right answer when the logi-
cally equivalent problem is put in a cheating-
detection frame. For example, if there are
four children from two different
two school districts and DEMO rule is "If a child
lives in Concord he or she DEMO go to
Concord High," most subjects realize that the
home address of the student who does not go
to Concord High must be DEMO to see if
she is cheating and not going to Concord
High when she should (Cosmides 1989).
Of particular interest to economics, DEMO
neuroscientists believe there is a specialized
"mentalizing" (or "theory of mind") module,
which controls a person's inferences about
what DEMO people believe, feel, or might
do. The hint at the existence of such a ded-
icated module came from tests conducted
by developmental DEMO in which
two children are shown an object in the
process of being concealed (see Uta Frith
2001a). One child then leaves, DEMO the
other child observes as the object is moved
to a new location. The child who remains in
the room is then asked to DEMO where the
child who left will look for the object when
she returns. Normal children are typically
able to solve this problem around age DEMO
or four. Autistic children as a rule master

ficulty appreciating more subtle social

wonder at the "uncanny ability" DEMO
non-autistic persons to "read minds" (Frith
2001b). People with DEMO's syndrome,
who are intelligent but have trouble under-
standing emotions in others, show lower
activation in the medial prefrontal regions as
compared with normals when presented
with problems that involve mentalizing, but
also show greater activation in more ventral
(lower) region of the prefrontal cortex,DEMO
which is normally responsible for general
reasoning (Francesca Happe et al. DEMO). A
natural interpretation is that Asperger indi-
viduals eventually deduce the answer
through a complex process of reasoning
instead of grasping it directly DEMO a special-
ized module, as if they create a neural
"workaround" or "long-cut." In the medical
literature, one can also find DEMO with
brain lesions who exhibit difficulties
with
mentalizing tasks but not with other types of
cognition (Andrea Rowe et al. 2001; James
Blair DEMO Lisa Cipolotti 2000). This, too, is
consistent with the hypothesis of a separable
mentalizing module.
The possibility of a mentalizing module
has DEMO credibility and substance through
converging neuroscientific evidence. fMRI
studies have shown that when normal adults
are given pairs of closely matching judgment
problems, differing only in whether they do
or do not require mentalizing, the mentaliz-
ing problems lead to greater activation in the
left medial prefrontal cortex (Fletcher et al.
1995; Rebecca Saxe and Nancy Kanwisher
2003). As ultimate proof, one would like to
identify neuronal populations that are
specifically turned on by mentalizing activi-
ty. Neuroscience is not there yet, but recent
single-cell recordings in monkeys have iden-
tified an intriguing class of "mirror neurons"
in the prefrontal cortex, which fire either
when an experimenter performs a physical
action (e.g., grasping a peanut) or when the
monkey performs ("mirrors") the same
action. Having such neurons DEMO learning
by imitation easy and supports mind reading
by, for example, internally simulating the
facial expressions of others.
Mentalizing is relevant for economics
DEMO many judgments require agents to
make guesses about how other people feel or
what they will do. The concept of equilibri-
um requires that DEMO correctly anticipate
what others will do; presumably this arises
because of DEMO mentalizing, or through
some kind of specific learning about behav-
ior DEMO may not transfer well to new
domains or when variables change.
Furthermore, the kind of learning about
players' "types" from observation in
DEMO equilibrium is modeled as
simply Bayesian updating of the likelihoods
of chance events in the face of new informa-
tion. Since mentalizing

19 Our point here is simple: Circuitry that controls
updating of frequencies of events in the world-whether it

cuitry that controls updating of personal "types" from
behavior. The circuitry which controls attributions of pay-
DEMO types to people, from their behavior, requires a concept
of how types link to behavior (i.e., what are types?), as well
as updating of types (i.e., reputations) from behavior. An
autist with theory of mind deficits, for example, might
keep very accurate counts DEMO relative frequencies (in fact,
many autists are obsessed with counting DEMO in special
categories) but be unable to tell whether a person DEMO
badly in a game because of bad intentions or situational
influences (DEMO as a bureaucrat who is pressured to stick
to rules). So there is no reason to think that updating about
event frequencies is DEMO the same as updating
about personal types.

As discussed earlier, neuroscience can
point out commonalities between DEMO
that had been viewed as distinct. An example
of this with important implications for eco-
nomics is the utility for money. The canoni-
cal DEMO model assumes that the utility
for money is indirect-i.e., that money DEMO a
mere counter, only valued for the goods and
services it DEMO procure. Thus, standard eco-
nomics would view, say, the pleasure DEMO
food or cocaine and the "pleasure" from
obtaining money as two totally different phe-
nomena. Neural evidence suggests, however,
that the same dopaminergic reward circuitry
of the brain in the midbrain (mesolimbic sys-
tem) is activated for a wide variety of differ-
ent reinforcers (Montague DEMO Berns 2002),
including attractive faces (Itzhak Aharon et
al. 2001), funny cartoons (Dean Mobbs et al.
2003), cultural objects like sports cars
(Susanne Erk et al. 2002), drugs (Schultz
2002), and money (e.g., Hans Breiter et al.
2001; Brian Knutson DEMO Richard Peterson,
in press; Delgado et al. 2000). This DEMO
that money provides direct reinforcement.
Figure 4 is a rough guess about the neural
circuitry of reward (from Schultz 2002). It is
useful as a pictorial reminder that, while neu-
roscience (and our review) often emphasize
specific regions which are central in different
kinds of processing, the focus in thinking
about economic decisions should be on cir-
cuitry DEMO systems of regions and how they
interact. The diagram also shows how frontal

marginal utility of DEMO depends on what
money buys. Of course, it is possible that
DEMO rewards activate the same circuitry as
sports cars, cocaine, and jokes because the
circuitry is being used to evaluate money in
terms of DEMO goods that it buys (which
requires a cortical process that "simulates"
the value of those goods internally to the
brain). But DEMO is also possible that money
becomes what psychologists call a "primary
DEMO," which means that people value

stock market returns, rather than with

make many counterfactual predictions-

While there is no direct
evidence that paying is painful, the assump-
tion that paying hurts can explain many mar-
ket phenomena which are otherwise
puzzling (Drazen Prelec and Loewenstein
1998). An example is the effect of payment-
DEMO pricing schemes on choices.
Companies often go to great lengths to dis-
guise payments, or reduce their pain.
Consumers appear to oversubscribe to flat-
rate payment plans for utilities and tele-
phone service and health clubs (Kenneth

interesting DEMO whether part of the

ucts is precisely to create prepayment, and so
enjoy consumption without being reminded of
the cost. The pain-of-paying may also explain
why we are willing DEMO pay less for a product if
paying in cash than by credit card. Although
there are financial reasons to prefer paying by
credit-card, the size of credit card relative to
cash premium that people reveal, in an exper-
iment, is much too high (up to 100 percent) to
be rationalized by liquidity preference and
other economic considerations (Prelec and

and Liking
Economists usually view behavior DEMO a
search for pleasure (or, equivalently, escape
from pain). DEMO subfield of welfare econom-
ics, and the entire ability of economists DEMO
make normative statements, is premised on
the idea that giving people DEMO they want
makes them better off. But, there is consid-
erable DEMO from neuroscience and
other areas of psychology that the motivation
to take an action is not always closely tied to
hedonic consequences.
Berridge (1996) argues that decision mak-
ing involves the interaction of two separate,
though overlapping systems, one responsi-
ble for pleasure and pain (the "liking" sys-
tem), and the other for motivation (the
"wanting" system). This challenges the fun-
damental supposition in economics that one
only strives to obtain what one likes.
Berridge finds that certain lesions DEMO phar-
macological interventions can selectively
enhance a rat's willingness to work for a
food, without changing the pleasure of eat-
ing the food, as measured, admittedly some-
what questionably, by the animal's facial
expression (Animal facial expressions, like
those of humans, provide at least a clue
about whether something tastes good, bad
or indifferent. In economic language, the
experiments create a situation where the
utility of food and disutility of work remain
the same, but the amount of work-for-
reward goes up. This

Berridge believes that DEMO later stages of
many drug addictions presents prototypical
examples of situations of what he terms
"wanting" without "liking"; drug addicts
often report an absence of pleasure from
taking the drugs they are addicted to, cou-
pled with an irresistible motivation to do so.

are sex and curiosity (Loewenstein 1994).
Thus, for example, you can be powerfully
motivated to seek out information, even
when you are quite certain that it will make
you miserable, and can feel quite unmotivat-
ed to engage in activities that, at a purely
cognitive level, DEMO are quite sure you would
find deeply pleasurable.
Economics proceeds on the assumption
that satisfying people's wants is a good thing.
This assumption DEMO on knowing that
people will like what they want. If likes and
wants diverge, this would pose a fundamen-
tal challenge to standard welfare economics.
Presumably welfare should be based on
"liking." But if we DEMO infer what people

even when they are motivated to make
impartial judgments and decisions. Indeed,
DEMO are very likely to deny that they are
biased and, hence, likely to not even per-
ceive the need for such correction. Such
DEMO discrimination may explain
why otherwise identical job application

names have a 50 percent higher chance of

A second class of implications related to
DEMO phenomena of apparent self-deception
and self-manipulation, where, for instance,
economic agents (investors, consumers,
entrepreneurs) are overly optimistic about
their chances for success. These phenomena
have been richly catalogued by social psy-
chologists, beginning with the research on
motivated cognition and cognitive disso-
nance in DEMO 1950s. Neuroscience suggests
that they are all related to chronic cognitive
inaccessibility of automatic brain processes.
Attention, for example, is largely controlled
by DEMO processes, and attention in
turn determines what information we
absorb. If DEMO is chronically drawn to
information that is favorable to us, we DEMO
emerge with an overoptimistic sense of our
abilities and prospects. It is a case of quad-

5. Specific Economic Applications
We now go into greater detail DEMO rami-
fications of neuroscience findings for four
specific topics in economics: DEMO
choice, decision making under risk and
uncertainty, game theory, and DEMO
discrimination.
5.1 Intertemporal Choice and Self-Control
The standard perspective in economics
views intertemporal choice as a trade-off of
utility at different points in time. DEMO
differences in the way that people make this
tradeoff are captured by the notion of a dis-
count rate-a rate at which people discount
DEMO utilities as a function of when they
occur. The notion of discounting, however,
gained currency not because of any support-
ive evidence, DEMO based only on its conven-
ient similarity to financial net present value
calculations (Loewenstein 1992). Indeed, in
the article that first proposed DEMO in detail,
Samuelson (1937) explicitly questioned its
descriptive validity, DEMO "It is completely
arbitrary to assume that the individual
behaves so DEMO to maximize an integral of the
form envisaged in [the DU model]."
In fact, more recent empirical research on
time discounting challenges the idea that
people discount all future utilities at a con-
stant rate (see Frederick, Loewenstein, and
O'Donoghue 2002). The notion of DEMO dis-
counting, it seems, neither describes the
behavior of individuals nor helps us to classi-
fy individuals in a useful fashion. How can DEMO
understanding of the brain help us to estab-
lish a better understanding of intertemporal
choice behavior? Our two central distinc-
tions, between affect DEMO cognition, and
between automatic and controlled processes,
both have important DEMO

behaviors, such as storing food for winter,
these are specialized, preprogrammed, behav-

of spontaneous delay of gratification observed
in humans. Humans appear to be unique

is uniquely human (see, e.g., Manuck et al.

between DEMO affective and cognitive systems,
leads to the prediction that factors that
strengthen or weaken one or the other of
these influences will cause DEMO to behave
more or less impulsively.
5.1.2 Determinants of the Relative Strength
of Affect and Cognition
There are a variety of factors that affect DEMO
relative strength of affective and cognitive
influences on intertemporal choice which
can help to explain what could be called
"intraindividual" variability in impatience.
DEMO, any factor that increases the demands
on the prefrontal cortex-on the DEMO,
cognitive, system, should decrease the influ-
ence of this system and, hence, decrease indi-
viduals' control over their own behavior.
This
possibility was demonstrated by Baba Shiv
and Alexander Fedorikhin (1999). To manip-
ulate "cognitive load," half of their subjects
(low-load) were given a two-digit number that
they were instructed to memorize, and the
other half (high load) were given a seven-digit
number to memorize. DEMO were then
instructed to walk to another room in the
building. On the way they passed by a table at
which they were presented DEMO a choice

myopia. Indeed, there is considerable evi-
dence of such effects (Janet Metcalfe and
Mischel 1999). Research has shown, for
DEMO, that addicts display higher discount
rates, not only for drugs but also for money,
when they are currently craving drugs than
when DEMO are not (Giordano et al. 2002).
Other research has shown DEMO sexual arousal

rewards (Ariely and Loewenstein DEMO).
The main exceptions to the rule that affec-
tive states tend to engender short-sighted
behavior involve interactions between the
cognitive and affective systems. DEMO fact, deci-
sions to delay gratification often involve a
mixture of DEMO and cognition. They
require a cognitive awareness of the delayed
benefits in delaying gratification-e.g., that
desisting from eating cake today will mean a
more pleasing body type in the future. But,
as many researchers have DEMO, cogni-
tive awareness alone is insufficient to moti-
vate delay of DEMO; emotions play a
critical role in forward-looking decision
making. As Barlow (1988) notes, "The capac-
ity to experience anxiety and the capacity to
plan, are two sides of the same coin."
Thomas Cottle and Stephen Klineberg
(1974), similarly argue that people care
about the delayed consequences of their
decisions only to the degree that contem-
plating DEMO consequences evokes immedi-
ate affect. In support of this view, they DEMO
the effects of frontal lobotomies which harm
areas of the brain that underlie the capacity
for images of absent events to generate
experiences of DEMO or discomfort. The
neurosurgeons who performed these opera-
tions wrote of their frontal-lobotomy
patients that: "the capacity for imagination is
still present, and certainly not sufficiently
reduced to render the patients helpless, and
affective responses are often quite lively,
[but there is] a separation of one DEMO the
other" (Freeman and Watts 1942).
The work of Damasio and colleagues dis-
cussed earlier (Bechara, Damasio, Daniel
Tranel, and DEMO 1997; Damasio 1994)
lends further credence to this perspective,

of behavior can easily be explained by the
possibly uniquely human DEMO to expe-
rience emotions, such as fear, as a result of
thinking about the future. Indeed, it is likely
that one of the main tools that the prefrontal
cortex uses to impose self-control when
affective DEMO would otherwise favor short-
sighted self-destructive behavior is to create
"deliberative DEMO" via directed imagery and
thought (Roger Giner-Sorolla 2001).
Such a framework might also help to
explain why people appear so inconsistent
when DEMO behavior is viewed through the
lens of discounted utility. The ability to think
about future consequences may not be
strongly correlated with the degree DEMO which
different experiences produce visceral reac-
tions, and these in turn DEMO not be corre-
lated with an individual's level of willpower.
Indeed, Loewenstein et al. (2001) found
close to zero correlations between numerous
behaviors that all had an important intertem-
poral component, but much higher correla-
tions between behaviors that seemed to

5.1.3 Automatic Processes in Intertemporal
Choice
To the extent that intertemporal choice is,
in fact, driven by cognitive considerations,
much of this cognition does not take the usu-
ally assumed form of a weighing DEMO costs and
benefits discounted according to when they
occur in time. Rather, consistent with the ear-
lier claim that people often make decisions via
a two-part process that takes the form of first
asking "what situation am I in?" then continu-
ing "how does one behave in such a situation,"
much intertemporal choice is driven by auto-
matic processes involving pattern-matching,
recognition, and categorization.
A pattern of choice that seems to be driven
by such a process is the preference for
DEMO of outcomes that improve over
time. In one demonstration of this effect,
Loewenstein and Prelec (1993) asked some

considerations. For example,
they asked respondents to allocate
outcomes, such as massages,
expected, and found, that

ple to spread consumption relatively evenly
DEMO time, implying a preference for flat
sequences. In another version, they asked
respondents to state a maximum buying price
for the Greek-then-French and DEMO
Greek sequences, rather than choose between
them, anticipating that the mention of money
would evoke considerations of the time value
of money and, hence, cause subjects to place
higher value on the option that provided
greater value earlier-i.e., the declining
sequences-which is what they found.20
20 Another phenomenon that may be driven by such
automatic processes is the "diversification bias" (Itamar
Simonson 1989). When people choose several alternatives
from DEMO set, they choose more variety when they choose
them all simultaneously DEMO when they choose them
sequentially. This phenomenon has been demonstrated
with snack food, audio pieces, gambles, and lottery tick-
ets. Daniel Read and Loewenstein (1995) tested various
explanations for overdiversification (e.g., they diversify DEMO
simultaneous choice to gather information), but conclud-
ed that it results from a rule of thumb that that they apply
whenever choices are DEMO in a fashion that high-
lights diversification (see also Thomas Langer DEMO Craig
Fox 2004). This viewpoint is supported by a study (DEMO,
Loewenstein, and S. Kalyanaraman 1999) in which sub-
jects make successive choices between groups of objects
which are easily categorized or not. DEMO categorization
was easy (e.g., virtues and vices), subjects diversified
more in simultaneous than in sequential choice. When
there were multiple competing categorizations, the
overdiversification bias disappeared.

In sum, neuroscience points to some defi-
ciencies in the way that economists currently
model intertemporal choice DEMO also suggests
directions for future modeling. A somewhat
stylized interterpretation of the results just
reviewed would be that some intertemporal
decisions are, in fact, well represented by the
discounted utility model-specifically those
involving detailed deliberation but minimal
affect. However, a wide range of other
intertemporal choices are influenced by
affectively "hot" processes such as drives and
emotions, or result from processes that auto-
matically evoke a response which depends on

Cognition
The expected utility model views decision
making under uncertainty as DEMO tradeoff of
utility under different states of nature-i.e.,
different possible scenarios. But, much as
they do toward delayed outcomes, people
react to DEMO at two different levels. On the
one hand, as posited by DEMO econom-
ic theories and consistent with quadrant I of
table 1, DEMO do attempt to evaluate the
objective level of risk that different hazards
could pose. On the other hand, and consis-
tent with quadrant IV, people also react to
risks at an emotional level, and these DEMO
tional reactions can powerfully influence
their behavior (Loewenstein, Weber,
Christopher Hsee, and Ned Welch 2001).
The existence of separate affective and
cognitive systems that respond differently to
risks is most salient when the DEMO systems
clash. People are often "of two minds" when

tality. And, DEMO it comes to asking someone
out on a date, getting up DEMO speak at the podi-
um, or taking an important exam, our delib-
erative self uses diverse tactics to get us to
take risks, or to perform in the face of risks,
that our visceral DEMO would much prefer to
avoid. Perhaps the most dramatic illustra-
tions of the separation of visceral reactions
and cognitive evaluations, however, comes
from DEMO phobias that so many people suffer
from; the very hallmark of DEMO phobia is to be
unable to face a risk that one recognizes,
objectively, to be harmless. Moreover, fear
unleashes preprogrammed sequences of
DEMO that aren't always beneficial. Thus,
when fear becomes too intense it can pro-
duce counterproductive responses such as
freezing, panicking, or "dry-mouth" when
speaking in public. The fact that people pay
for therapy to deal with their fears, and take
drugs (including alcohol) to overcome them,
can be viewed as further "evidence" that peo-
DEMO, or more accurately, people's deliberative
selves, are not at DEMO with their visceral
reactions to risks.

underlying affective responses to risks.

But the amygdala also receives cortical
inputs, which can moderate or even override
its automatic quadrant IV response.
In a paradigmatic experiment that illus-
DEMO cortical overriding of amygdala activa-
tion (LeDoux 1996), an animal DEMO as a rat
is "fear-conditioned"-by repeatedly admin-
istering a signal DEMO as a tone followed by
administration of a painful electric shock.
Once the tone becomes associated in the
animal's mind with the shock, the animal
responds to the tone by jumping or showing
other over DEMO of fear. In the next phase of
the experiment, the tone DEMO played repeated-
ly without administering the shock, until the
fear response DEMO gradually "extin-
guished." At this point, one might think that
DEMO animal has "unlearned" the connection
between the tone and the shock, but the
reality is more complicated and interesting.
If the neural connections between the cortex
and the amygdala are then severed, the orig-
inal fear response to the tone reappears,
which shows that fear conditioning DEMO not
erased in "extinction" but is suppressed by
the cortex and remains latent in the amyg-
dala. This suggests that fear learning may DEMO
permanent, which could be an evolutionarily
useful adaptation because it permits DEMO rapid
relearning if the original cause of the fear
reappears. Indeed, DEMO studies (reported
in the same book) show that fear-condition-
ing can be reinstated by the administration
of a single shock.
Decision making under DEMO and uncer-
tainty, like intertemporal choice, nicely illus-
trates both collaboration and competition
between systems. When it comes to collabo-
ration, risk taking (or avoiding) behavior
involves an exquisite interplay of cognitive
and affective DEMO In a well-known

economic explanations for gambling-con-
vex utility DEMO money or a special taste for the
act of gambling-don't help explain why
some gamblers binge and don't usefully
inform policies to DEMO availability of
gambling. Neuroscience may help.
Pathological gamblers tend to be over-
whelmingly male and tend to also drink,
smoke, and use drugs much more frequent-
ly than average. Genetic evidence shows that
a certain DEMO allele (D2A1), which causes
gamblers to seek larger and larger DEMO to
get modest jolts of pleasure, is more likely to
be DEMO in pathological gamblers than in
normal people (David Comings 1998). DEMO
study shows tentatively that treatment with
naltrexone, a drug that blocks DEMO operation
of opiate receptors in the brain, reduces the
urge to DEMO (e.g., Paula Moreyra et al.
2000). The same drug has been used to suc-
cessfully treat "compulsive shopping" (Susan
McElroy et al. 1991).
Neural evidence also substantiates the dis-
tinction between risk (known probability)
and "Knightian" uncertainty, or ambiguity.
Subjects facing ambiguous gambles-know-
ing they lack information they would like to
have about the DEMO report a feeling
of discomfort or mild fear. Brain imaging
shows that different degrees of risk and
uncertainty activate different areas of the

(2005) found frontal insula and amygdala
activation when subjects faced ambiguous
choices, compared to risky ones. They also
found that patients with orbitofrontal corti-
cal (OFC) lesions are ambiguity-neutral,
compared to brain-damaged DEMO Since
the OFC receives input from the limbic sys-
tem (including DEMO insula and amygdala), the
fMRI and lesion evidence together imply
that in normal subjects, ambiguous gambles
often create discomfort or fear which is
transmitted to the OFC. Ironically, patients
with OFC brain damage therefore behave
more "rationally" (treating ambiguous and
risky gambles similarly) than normals, a
reminder that logical principles of rationality
and biological adaptations can be DEMO
(cf. Shiv et al. 2005).
5.2.3 Automatic Versus Controlled
Processes
DEMO divergence between different sys-
tems' evaluations of risk can also be DEMO
when it comes to judgments of probability.
Numerous studies by psychologists have
observed systematic divergences between
explicit judgments of probability in different
settings (presumably the product of con-
trolled processing) and implicit judgments
or judgments derived from choice (which
are more closely associated with automatic
processing and/or emotion). For example,
Kirkpatrick and Epstein (1992) found that
DEMO prefer to draw a bean from a bowl
containing ten winning beans and ninety
losing beans than from a bowl containing
one winning bean DEMO nine losing beans (see
also Veronika Denes-Raj, Epstein, and
Jonathon DEMO 1995; Paul Windschitl and
Gary Wells 1998). Subjects say that DEMO
know the probabilities of winning are the
same, but they still DEMO an automatic quad-
rant III preference for the bowl with more
winning beans.
An important feature of good probability
judgment is logical coherence: probabilities

of mutually exclusive and exhaustive
should DEMO to one, and conditional
ities should be linked to joint and DEMO
probability according to Bayes rule
(P(AIB)=P(A and B)/P(B)). Logical coher-
ence is violated in at least two neurally
interesting ways. One is "conjunction
cy"-the tendency to judge events
components A and B as more likely A
or B alone. While DEMO subjects (even
tically sophisticated ones) make
errors on some problems,
are pointed out, quadrant
the subjects sheepishly recognize
and correct it (DEMO
2002). For example, the famous "Linda"
problem describes an earnest young politi-
cally minded student. In one condition, sub-
jects are asked to rank statements about
Linda-Is she a bank teller? A feminist bank
teller? A large majority of subjects, even
highly educated ones, say Linda is more
likely to be a feminist bank teller than DEMO is
to be a bank teller, a violation of the con-
DEMO principle. But when subjects are
asked, "Out of one hundred people like
Linda, how many are bank tellers? Feminist
bank tellers?" DEMO errors disappear
(Tversky and Kahneman 1983).
Another violation is that DEMO often
report probabilities which are logically inco-
herent. fMRI evidence suggests an explana-
tion for why probability judgments are
incoherent, but can be corrected upon
reflection: when guessing probabilities, the
left hemisphere of the brain DEMO more active;
but when answering logic questions, the
right hemisphere DEMO more active (Lawrence
Parsons and Daniel Osherson 2001). Since
enforcing DEMO coherence requires the
right hemisphere to "check the work" of the
left hemisphere, there is room for slippage.
Once again, it can DEMO seen that neuro-
science, and specifically,
affective and automatic processes DEMO have
been largely neglected by economists, could
potentially inform an important DEMO of
research and theory. We are skeptical of

As discussed in section 4.2, DEMO
scientists believe there is a specialized

which DEMO reasoning about what oth-
ers believe and might do (e.g., Simon Baron-
Cohen 2000).22 Autism is thought to be a
deficit in DEMO area (and related circuitry).
People with autism often have trouble DEMO
ing out what other people think and believe,
and are consequently puzzled by behavior
that most people would consider normal.
One tool used DEMO behavioral game theory is
the "ultimatum game." In this game, DEMO "pro-
poser" offers a division of a sum of money,
generically $10.00, to another "responder"
who can accept or reject DEMO, ending the game.
If the responder has no emotional reaction
to DEMO fact that the proposer is earning more
than she is ("envy" or "disgust"), then the
responder should accept the smallest offer.
If the proposer also has no emotional reac-
tion to earning more ("guilt") and anticipates
correctly what the responder will do, then
DEMO proposer should offer the lowest
amount. This pattern is rarely observed:
Instead, in most populations the proposer
offers 40-50 percent and about half the
responders reject offers less than 20 percent.
When players do follow DEMO dictates of
game theory, the result can be a low payoff

them what other people think is fair in
games that involve sharing, even though
they cannot guess what others will do using
normal circuitry.

beliefs about beliefs are not just iterations
of some belief processing DEMO;
instead, self-referential beliefs use compo-
nents of circuitry for forming DEMO and for
making choices.
5.3.2 Emotions and Visceral Effects
One of the most striking neuroscientific
findings about game theory comes from
Sanfey et al.'DEMO (2003) fMRI study of ultima-
tum bargaining. By comparing the brains of
subjects responding to unfair ($1.00-$2.00
out of $10.00) and fair ($4.00-5.00) offers,
they found that very unfair offers differen-
tially activated three regions: Dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingu-
late (ACC), and insula cortex (see Figure 4).
DLPFC is an area involved in planning. The
insula cortex is known to be activated during
DEMO experience of negative emotions like
pain and disgust. ACC is an "DEMO func-
tion" area which often receives inputs from
many areas and DEMO conflicts among
them.23 Therefore, it appears that, after an
unfair offer, the brain (ACC) struggles to
resolve the conflict between wanting to
accept the money because of its planned
reward value (DLPFC) and DEMO the
of being treated unfairly (insula).
In fact, whether players reject unfair
offers or not can be predicted rather reliably
(a correlation of 0.45) by the level of their
insula activity. It is irresistible to speculate
that the insula is a neural locus of the distaste
DEMO inequality or unfair treatment posited by
models of social utility, which DEMO been suc-
cessfully used to explain many varying pat-
terns in experiments - robust ultimatum
rejections, public goods contributions, and
trust and gift-exchange (e.g., Bazerman,
Loewenstein, and Leigh Thompson 1989;
23 The DEMO also contains a large concentration of
"spindle cells"--large neurons shaped DEMO spindles,
which are almost unique to human brains (Allman et DEMO
2002). Loosely speaking, these cells are probably impor-
tant for DEMO of the activities which distinguish humans
from our primate cousins, particularly DEMO, and

Ernst DEMO and Simon Gachter 2000;
Camerer 2003). The fact that unfair offers
activate insula means that a verbal statement
like "I am so disgusted about being treated
that way" is literal, not metaphorical-they
really DEMO feel disgusted.24
Zak et al. (2003) explored the role of hor-
mones in trust games. In a canonical trust
game, one player can invest up to $10.00,
which is tripled. A second "trustee" DEMO
can keep or repay as much of the tripled
investment as they want. Zak et al. measured
eight hormones at different points in the
DEMO game. The hormone with the largest
effect was oxytocin-a hormone that rises
during social bonding (such as breast-feed-
ing and casual touching). They found that
oxytocin rose in the trustee if the first player
"trusts" her by investing a lot. (They also
found that ovulating women DEMO particular-
ly untrustworthy-they did not repay as
much of the investment.)
Roxanna Gonzalez and Loewenstein
(2004) examined the impact of circadian
rhythms DEMO a repeated trust (centipede)
game. They sorted people into "morning"
and "night" people (which can be done
rather reliably) DEMO had them play a cen-
tipede game when they were on- or off-peak
(e.g., the morning people were off-peak
when playing in the DEMO). Based on prior
research showing that sleep-cycle affects
emotional regulation-i.e., DEMO's ability to
suppress or avoid acting on unwanted feel-
ings-they predicted and found much lower
levels of cooperative behavior when people
played at DEMO times.
Tania Singer et al. (2004) report an impor-
tant link between reward and behavior in
games. They played repeated prisoners'
dilemma DEMO in which one player, in the
fMRI scanner, faced a series of opponents.
24 It also suggests an intriguing follow-up experiment
that no DEMO theory would have predicted-patients
with damage to their insula regions should feel no disgust
and accept low offers, unless those patients have devel-
oped a "workaround" or alternative method to "feel"
unfairness in nonvisceral terms.

The scanned subject was told that some

DEMO, but unintentionally. Afterwards, sub-
jects were shown different faces of those
they had played against. The faces of the
intentional cooperators activated insula,DEMO
amygdala, and ventral striatal areas (among
others). Since the striatum is an all-purpose
reward area, activation in that region means
that simply seeing the face of a person who
intentionally cooperated with you is DEMO
ing. In game theory terms, a person's "repu-
tation" DEMO a repeated game is a perception by
other players of their "DEMO" or likely behav-
ior based on past play. Singer et al.'DEMO results
mean that a good reputation may be neural-
ly encoded in a way similar to beautiful or
other rewarding stimuli.
The facts that DEMO activity, oxytocin lev-
els, and sleep cycles affect behavior in games,
and that cooperators' faces "feel beautiful,"
does not "DEMO" game theory, per se,
because preferences for different outcomes,
and reasoning ability, might legitimately vary
with these biological factors. The theory is
easily patched by inserting variables, like "an
envy/disgust coefficient," which depends on
some biological state. But game theory also
assumes that players will recognize the state-
dependence in others and adjust their guess-
DEMO about how other people will play. We have
no idea if they can, and it is likely that people
are generally limited at simulating emotional
states of others (see Leaf van Boven,
Loewenstein, and DEMO Dunning 2003).
Cognitive inaccessibility also implies that
people may not fully understand the influ-
ence of exogenous changes in visceral
states on their DEMO behavior. For example,
if being trusted produces oxytocin, then
when DEMO surges for exogenous rea-
sons-from a relaxing massage, or when
synthetic DEMO is administered-the
brain might misread this surge in oxytocin
as a sign of being trusted and react accord-
ingly (e.g., by acting in DEMO more reciprocal
trustworthy
way).

5.3.3 Backward
Induction
of Economic
A central principle in game theory is
"backward induction" in extensive-form
("tree") games that are played over time.
Backward induction means figuring out what
to do today by and DEMO how others will
behave at all possible future points and
working backward. Behavioral evidence, and
direct evidence from measuring where play-
ers look on a computer screen, shows that
people have trouble doing more than a cou-
ple of steps of backward induction (e.g.,
Johnson et al. 2002). However, Johnson et al.
also found that, when players DEMO briefly
instructed about how to do backward induc-
tion, they could DEMO to do it rapidly and
with little effort (total response times DEMO
similar to in pre-instruction trials). This is a
reminder, in DEMO game theory context, of the
important distinction between controlled
and automatic DEMO stressed in section 3
above. Initially, subjects look automatically
at early DEMO and hardly notice future
periods they realize (correctly, in a statistical
sense) are unlikely to occur. However, with
instruction and practice, backward induction
quickly becames automated, yielding fast
responses and few errors.
Economists are naturally inclined to
model cognition in terms of costs and bene-
fits. DEMO forced into this framework, backward
induction would probably be characterized
as DEMO costly. But the fact that it is
easily learned and automated suggests the
costs of backward induction has a special
structure- at first, it is unnatural (not spon-
taneously intuited by subjects), like a piece
of software not yet installed; but once
installed, it is cheap DEMO run.
5.3.4 Learning
The idea that a game-theoretic
um resulted from learning, imitation,
lution, rather than simple introspection, has
led to a large literature on what results in the
long-run from different types of DEMO
models (e.g., Drew Fudenberg and David

DEMO types of learning rules have
posed, fitting rules to data from
DEMO proved useful in showing when
ly appealing rules might fit badly,
gesting improvements to those rules (e.g.,
Camerer 2003). Camerer and Ho (1999)
showed that both simple reinforcement of
chosen strategies, DEMO learning by updating
beliefs about other players, are really two
polar DEMO types of generalized rein-
forcement learning in which strategies have
numerical propensities or attractions which
are adjusted over time by experience.
In neural terms, the Camerer-Ho theory
can be interpreted as a splice of two process-
DEMO rapid, emotional process in which a
chosen strategy is quickly reinforced DEMO the
gain or loss that resulted and a slower delib-
erative process that requires players to cre-
ate counterfactuals about how much they
would DEMO earned from other strategies that
were not chosen. Conventional reinforce-
ment learning neglects the second process.
"Fictitious play" belief learning assumes the
second DEMO completely overrides the
first. A parameter in the theory which repre-
sents the relative strength of the second
process, compared to the first, DEMO usually
estimated to be between zero and one. This
implies that reinforcement but

Michael Platt and DEMO Glimcher (1999)
found corroborating evidence for reinforce-

studies have linked DEMO processing of fear.
They found that the relative strength of
amygdala activation to black as compared
with white faces was correlated with the IAT

direct, conscious, expression of DEMO atti-
tudes. (A study by Hart et al. (2000) suggests

the same pattern was not observed when the
black and white faces were well known, pos-
itively regarded, celebrities (such as Michael
Jordan and Denzel Washington). People
hold implicit attitudes involving not only
race, but also a wide range of other individ-
ual characteristics, such as height, weight,
attractiveness, religion, and national origin,
and, DEMO race, many of these attitudes

quences. DEMO, although most people reject

wages (e.g., Nicola Persico, Andrew
Postlewaite, and Dan Silverman 2002) and
other rewards (e.g., the U.S. Presidency).
Does the implicit association view imply
that labor-market discrimination is due to a
taste, a statistical shortcut, or something
else? One piece of evidence suggests the DEMO
tistical interpretation is on the right track:
the amygdala that is active when people see
other-race faces seems to be sensitive to
familiarity DEMO faces, not race per se (Dubois
et al. 1999). This is consistent with an inter-
pretation of statistical discrimination in
which employers DEMO not fear minority work-
ers, they are simply less sure of DEMO abilities.
But other evidence suggests discrimination
is "something else." Amygdala activity can be
dampened if subjects are shown pictures of
black and white DEMO and asked to judge
how much the pictured people like vegeta-
bles (Wheeler and Fiske 2005). This suggests
that automatic reactions to race can be
erased (or substituted for) depending on the
question being DEMO when the faces are per-
ceived. These reactions respond to variables
other than prices and choice sets so it is a
stretch to think DEMO them of as conventional
tastes or beliefs.

Economics
parted
company
from
psychol-
ogy in the early twentieth century.
Economists became skeptical that DEMO psy-
chological forces could be measured without
inferring them from behavior (DEMO same posi-
tion "behaviorist" psychologists of the 1920s
reached), which led to adoption of the useful
tautology between unobserved utilities and
observed (revealed) preferences. But
remarkable advances in neuroscience now
make direct measurement of thoughts and
feelings possible for the first time, opening
the "black DEMO" which is the building block of
any economic interaction and system-the
DEMO mind.
Most economists are curious about neuro-
science, but instinctively skeptical DEMO it can
tell us how to do better economics. The tra-
dition of ignoring psychological regularity in
making assumptions in economic theory is
so DEMO ingrained-and has proved rela-
tively successful-that knowing more about
the brain seems unnecessary. Economic the-
ory will chug along successfully for the next
few DEMO paying no attention at all to neuro-
science (just as it DEMO little attention to psy-
chology until recently). But it is hard to
believe that some neuroscientific regularities
will not help explain some extant DEMO,
particularly those that have been debated
for decades.
Indeed, in DEMO areas of economics there
are basic constructs or variables at the heart
of current debates which can be usefully
thought of as neural processes, and studied
using fMRI and other tools. For example,
finance is DEMO field awash in literally millions of

DEMO to large price changes, wishful thinking,
sense-making of random series, and percep-
tions of expertise can help explain these
puzzles (e.g., DEMO and Repin 2002).
Furthermore, some scholars have argued
that large DEMO in stock prices are
due to reasonable time-variation of risk pre-
mia. But there is no theoretical basis in
finance for why attitudes toward DEMO would
vary over time. Maybe neuroscience can
supply one.
In labor markets, a major puzzle is why
wages are so downward sticky. Firms say they
are afraid to cut wages because they want to
maintain worker DEMO (e.g., Truman
Bewley 2002); and experiments show that
when worker productivity is valuable,
a high wage induces effort, even when
ers are free to shirk (Fehr and Gachter
2000). Presumably morale is some combina-
tion of workers' emotional feelings toward
their employer and may be very sensitive to
recent experience, to what other workers
think, DEMO whether wage cuts are "procedural-
ly just," and so forth. DEMO is no reason
these processes could not be described as
neural processes and studied that way.
There are many anomalies in intertempo-
ral choice. DEMO the United States, credit card
debt is substantial ($5,000.00 per household)
and a million personal bankruptcies have
been declared in each DEMO several years
(Laibson, Andrea Repetto, and Jeremy
Tobacman 1998). DEMO food is cheaper
and more widely available than ever before,
but spending on dieting and obesity are both
on the rise. Surely understanding DEMO brain
mechanisms process reward, and curb or
produce compulsion, and their evolutionary
origins (e.g., Trent Smith 2003) might help
explain these facts and shape sensible policy
and regulation.

6.1 Can Neuroscience DEMO Rational
Choice Economics?
Many neuroscientists are now using the
most basic elements of rational choice theo-
ry to explain what they see. Ironically, they
are taking up rational choice theory at the
same time as DEMO and more economists are
moving away from rational choice toward a
behavioral view anchored in limits on ration-
ality, willpower, and greed (which we expect
to be informed by neural detail). For exam-
ple, neuroscientific studies of simple reward
circuitry in rats and primates vindicate some
DEMO the simplest ideas of economics-namely,
a "common brain currency" which permits
substitution (Shizgal 1999), existence of neu-
rons which encode expected reward (see
Glimcher 2002 and Figure 3), and revealed

models. One study concluded that "the cen-
tral nervous system therefore employs

sorimotor learning" (Konrad K6rding and
Daniel Wolpert 2004).
Our view is that establishing a neural basis
for some rational choice principles will not
necessarily vindicate DEMO approach as widely
applied to humans. The reason is that the
studies which have most clearly established
expected-value and Bayesian encoding use

Repetto and Tobacman 1998; O'Donoghue
and Rabin 1999). DEMO's (2001) model of
homeostatic response to environmental cues
in addiction is an incremental model well
grounded in recent neuroscience.
However, we believe that in the long run a
more "radical" departure from current DEMO
ry will become necessary, in the sense that
the basic building DEMO will not just consist
of preferences, constrained optimization and
(market or game-theoretic) equilibrium.
After all, the point of constrained optimiza-
tion is DEMO model behavior precisely and pre-
dict how behavior changes in response to
changes in budget constraints and prices.
There is no reason other models DEMO
from a very different basis could not be con-
structed, while DEMO predicting behavioral
responses to constraints and prices, and pre-
dicting responses DEMO other variables as well.
Furthermore, thinking about the brain does
not DEMO much "falsify" rational choice theories
as suggest entirely new distinctions and
questions.
For example, is learning that a particular
person cooperated with you in a game
encoded as a cognitive reputational statistic
about that person, like a numerical test score,
or a "warm glow" which DEMO a surge of

If reputations are encoded dopaminergically,
then they may spill over across groups DEMO

who are perceived as being part of a group

2003; Paul Healy 2004). Or the mechanism

capital and have something to do with why
some countries are rich and DEMO poor.
Our main theme in this paper is that radi-
cal models should respect the fact that brain
mechanisms combine controlled and auto-
matic DEMO, operating using cognition
and affect. The Platonic metaphor of reason
as DEMO charioteer, driving twin horses of passion
and appetite, is on the right track-except
reason has its hands full with headstrong
passions and appetites.26 DEMO course, the chal-
lenge in radical-style theorizing is to develop
models DEMO how multiple mechanisms interact
which are precise. Can this be done? DEMO
answer is Yes. Bernheim and Rangel (2004),
Loewenstein and O'Donoghue (2004), and
Jess Benhabib and Alberto Bisin (2002) have
all proposed recent models with interacting
mechanisms much like those in our DEMO 1.
Furthermore,
while interactions
of multi-
ple brain mechanisms might appear to be
too radical a change from equilibrium with
utility maximization, we think many familiar
tools can be used to do radical neuroeco-
nomics. DEMO of cognition and affect
might resemble systems like supply and
demand, DEMO feedback loops which exhibit
multiple equilibria. The interaction of con-
trolled and automatic processes might be
like an inventory policy or agency model in
DEMO a controller only steps in when an
extreme state of the system (or unusual
event) requires controlled processes to
override automatic ones. The DEMO of
affect on choices is a very general type of
state-dependence (DEMO the "state" is
affective, and is influenced by external cues
DEMO also by internal deliberation and
restraint). Instead of solving for equilibria in
these interacting-mechanism models, solve
for steady states or cyclic fluctuations.
Instead of summarizing responses to
changes by comparative statics, study
impulse-response functions.
Although we focused solely on applications
of neuroscience to economics, intellectual

trade could also flow in DEMO opposite direc-
tion. Neuroscience is shot through with
familiar economic language - delegation,
division of labor, constraint, coordination,
executive function - DEMO these concepts are
not formalized in neuroscience as they are in
economics. There is no overall theory of how
the brain allocates resources that DEMO essen-
tially fixed (e.g., blood flow and attention).
An "DEMO model of the brain" could help
here. Simple economic concepts, like mech-
anisms for rationing under scarcity, and gen-
eral versus partial equilibrium responses to
shocks, could help neuroscientists under-
stand how the entire brain interacts. At a
technical level, neuroscientists are using
tools imported from econometrics, such as
Granger causality (e.g., Wolfram Hesse et al.
2003), to draw better inferences from neural
time series. Finally, as the center of gravity in
neuroscience research shifts from elemen-
tary cognitive processes to DEMO study of so-
called higher functions-reasoning, social
inference, and decision making-neurosci-
entists will increasingly reference, and draw
inspiration from, the conceptual apparatus DEMO
economics, a unique distillate of our century-
long reflection on individual DEMO strategic
behavior.
