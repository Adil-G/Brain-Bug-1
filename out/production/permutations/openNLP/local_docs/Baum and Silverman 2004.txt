Abstract
In the entrepreneurial setting, DEMO intermediaries such as venture capital firms (VCs) are
perhaps the dominant source of selection shaping the environment within which new ventures evolve.
VCs DEMO selection both by acting as a ‘‘scout’’ able to identify future potential and as a ‘‘coach’’ that
can help realize it. Despite the large DEMO on the role of VCs in encouraging startups, it is generally
DEMO for granted that VCs are expert scouts and coaches, and so DEMO ways in which VCs actually
enhance startup performance are not well understood. In this study, we examine whether VCs’
emphasize picking winners or building them by comparing the effects of startups’ alliance, intellectual,
and human capital characteristics on VCs decisions to finance them with the effects of DEMO same
characteristics on future startup performance. Our findings point to a joint logic that combines the
roles: VCs finance startups that have strong technology, but are at risk of failure in the short run, and DEMO
in need of management expertise. Our findings thus support the belief in VC expertise, but only to a
point. VCs also appear to make a common attribution error overemphasizing startups’ human capital
when making their investment DEMO

a given organizational population (Aldrich, 1999). As long DEMO variations arise and are
subjected to consistent selection criteria, and positively DEMO variants are preserved and
propagated, evolution will occur. These three mechanisms DEMO very general; their operation
does not depend on finding a social DEMO to features of biological evolution (Campbell,
1965).
In evolutionary DEMO of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs generate variation by founding
new firms, pursuing different strategies, and attempting to combine different bundles of assets
to do so. Selection is then generated by the decisions of external resource holders to DEMO
their resources among these firms (Aldrich, 1999). In the entrepreneurial setting, financial
intermediaries such as venture capital firms (VCs) have been cited as perhaps the dominant
source of selection (Anderson, 1999). DEMO affect selection by providing financial resources to
cash-hungry startups and by favoring new firms with, or requiring them to adopt, particular
strategies, practices, or other characteristics. VCs may also provide management expertise or
access to other capabilities that bolster the competitive advantage of startups that they fund
(Hellmann and Puri, 2002). Further, because they are perceived to DEMO ‘‘informed agents’’ able
to identify particularly promising startups, their investment provides DEMO certification benefit
that can enable the startup to obtain other resources (DEMO and Weiss, 1991). Thus, VCs
can affect selection by acting as what we term a ‘‘scout’’ able to identify potential and as DEMO
‘‘coach’’ (Hellmann, 2000) that can help realize it.
In evolutionary DEMO, the VC industry constitutes an indirect vicarious selective system
(Anderson, DEMO). Vicarious selectors function to eliminate trials of variations that would be
fundamentally detrimental to the fit or survival of a system or even DEMO anticipate certain kinds
of variations that might prove beneficial (Campbell, 1965). Through past trial-and-error
learning, VCs may evolve vicarious selective systems (DEMO, due diligence strategies), which
systematically predispose them toward financing startups DEMO certain variations and
avoidance of others. In turn, in their role DEMO an indirect vicarious selective system, VCs lower
investors’ costs of search DEMO selection. Rather than waiting for direct selection to determine
the success or failure of a startup, investors rely on VCs to identify startups that give off
signals predictive of future success and to enhance the performance DEMO startups that they select
for funding. VCs that acquire effective vicarious selectors thrive as a result, and successful
selectors may subsequently diffuse through the VC industry. VCs thus shape the environment
within which new ventures evolve DEMO are themselves subject to selection processes at a
higher level.
In this paper, we examine whether VCs’ vicarious selectors emphasize picking winners or
building them. As Shepherd and Zacharakis (2002) note, although researchers have described
in detail the criteria VCs use to choose which startups to fund, researchers have typically
assumed that VCs are capable of identifying promising startups DEMO consequently have
primarily asked VCs to report their own decision criteria without exploring whether these
criteria actually influence subsequent startup performance. Yet only a DEMO of the firms
VCs fund succeed (Gifford, 1997; Gorman and DEMO, 1989), most achieving an average
rate of return on invested DEMO suggesting that many VCs are unable to discover a
‘‘predictive template’’ (DEMO and Kenworthy, 1999). Moreover, while research shows VC-
backed startups outperform comparable non-VC-backed startups (e.g., Megginson and Weiss,
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 411–436
413
1991; Sandberg, 1986; Timmons, 1999), research has DEMO sought to identify whether these
differences are attributable to inherent differences between VC-backed and non-VC-backed
startups or to the postinvestment benefits that accrue to DEMO VC-backed firms. Existing
research thus offers little insight into how VCs affect the startup selection process.
Given the importance of financial intermediaries to selection DEMO an organizational
population, this is an important gap in our knowledge DEMO our research focus. One way to
address this gap is to test the effectiveness of VCs predictive templates by comparing the
effects of startups’ DEMO on VCs decisions to finance them with the effects of the
same characteristics on future startup performance. If VCs affect selection primarily by
picking DEMO, then the startup characteristics that attract VC investment should also
enhance DEMO future performance. If, instead, VCs affect selection primarily by building
winners, then the startup characteristics that attract VC investment need not be associated
with future startup performance and may even affect it negatively.
Below, we outline in more detail the ‘‘scout’’ and ‘‘coach’’ views of VCs and DEMO empirical
implications of each view. We also identify startups’ alliances (i.e., social capital), patents
(i.e., intellectual capital), and top management (i.e., human capital) as key signals of startup
potential. We suggest DEMO, faced with great uncertainty about the quality of startups, VCs will
rely heavily on the startups’ partners, patents, and top management team DEMO to
make judgments about their promise; and that in the race DEMO capital, startups capable of
attracting alliance partners, creating intellectual property, DEMO possessing capable manage-
ment will outperform comparable startups that lack such capabilities. Then, we estimate
models of the effects of social, intellectual, and human capital on VC financings and compare
these effects with estimates from DEMO of startup performance in the Canadian biotech-
nology industry from 1991 to 2000. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and
proposals for DEMO research.
2. The role of the VC: scout or coach?
DEMO have devoted a great deal of attention to the influence of VCs on startup
formation (Barry et al., 1990) on facilitating the success of specific entrepreneurial ventures
(Jain and Kini, 1995) and on the rate and nature of innovation itself (Kortum and Lerner,
2000). The popular press has similarly identified VCs as the primary actors in DEMO
and selecting among new entrepreneurial ventures going as far as to accompany celebrated
venture capitalists on their ‘‘daily rounds’’ to document their personalities, activities, and
decisions (Byrne, 2000).
Yet despite the large literature on the role of VCs in encouraging startups, little of this
research has attempted to tease apart the multiple ways in which a VC might DEMO a
startup’s performance. Most research has assumed that VCs are particularly good ‘‘scouts.’’
That is, that they are particularly adept at identifying exceptionally promising startup
ventures. Consequently, a positive relationship between a VC’s investment in a startup and
that startup’s subsequent performance is seen as resulting from the DEMO ability to identify
preinvestment, which startups are more likely to enjoy DEMO performance in the future
414
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 411–436
(Chan, 1983; Shepherd et al., 2000). Further, since other resource holders recognize that VCs
are good at identifying promising DEMO, a VC investment facilitates the funded startup’s
efforts to obtain other DEMO resources (Megginson and Weiss, 1991; Stuart et al., 1999;
Anand and Piskorski, 2000).
Another stream of research emphasizes instead that VCs are particularly good ‘‘coaches.’’
That is, that they are particularly skilled at injecting expertise and sound business judgment
into startup ventures (Hellmann, DEMO). Consequently, a positive association between a VC’s
investment in a DEMO and that startup’s subsequent performance stems not from the VC’s
ability to ‘‘pick winners,’’ but rather from the VC’s ability to ensure that DEMO startup is well-
managed postinvestment (Jain and Kini, 1995; Hellmann DEMO Puri, 2002). Again, VC
investment should facilitate the funded firm’s efforts to obtain other necessary resources;
but in this view, by signaling an infusion of management expertise.
Which of these roles dominates? Do VCs’ vicarious selectors emphasize picking winners
or identifying startups that the VC DEMO build into winners? There is no research on this issue.
In DEMO, this is the result of both VC roles being positively associated DEMO startups’
subsequent performance. Additionally, many of the characteristics that affect preinvestment
DEMO also affect postinvestment coaching in the same direction—for example, the greater
DEMO geographic distance between VC and startup, the more difficult are both DEMO
superior firms preinvestment and monitoring them postinvestment (Sorenson and Stuart,
DEMO).
One way to disentangle these different effects is to assess whether or not the weights VCs
assign to startup characteristics when deciding which DEMO to finance converge with the
influences of these same characteristics on startup performance. If the VC investment–startup
performance relationship is driven by VCs’ ability DEMO identify particularly promising startups,
then startup characteristics should affect VCs’ decisions to invest in the same way that they
affect startups’ performance. If, however, the VC investment–startup performance relation-
ship is driven by VC’s ability to provide management expertise and network contacts to the
startup, then startup characteristics that affect VCs’ investment decisions need not affect
startups’ performance in DEMO same way; they may be either unrelated to or diverge in DEMO
effects. Thus, the greater the convergence between the effects of startup DEMO on VC
investment decisions and startup performance, the greater the ability DEMO VCs to ‘‘pick
winners’’ and the more likely it is that the VC investment–startup performance relationship
is attributable to the ‘‘VC as scout.’’
3. DEMO technology startups
Mobilizing resources to build a new organization is an undertaking laden with uncertainty
and unforeseeable hazards. It is also an inherently social DEMO because entrepreneurs must
access financial and social capital and other types of resources through relationships with
parties beyond the boundaries of their organizations. Because DEMO quality and promise of a
new venture is always a matter of some debate, however, the decision of external resource
holders to invest DEMO, capital, or other resources in a new organization is one that must be
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 411–436
415
made in the face of considerable uncertainty about the startup’s DEMO chances and financial
prospects.
Many obstacles confront young companies (Stinchcombe, 1965). Startups often lack
employee commitment, knowledge of their environment, and DEMO relationships with
customers and suppliers. Because they have little operating experience, DEMO frequently
operate using immature and unrefined routines. Startups also tend to be small and so unable to
withstand a sustained period of poor performance (Aldrich and Auster, 1986). These perils
have led organizational sociologists to conclude that new organizations are highly vulnerable
to direct selection, a notion succinctly portrayed as a liability of newness (Hannan and
Freeman, 1984; Stinchcombe, 1965).
Because startups encounter so many hazards and because they have short-track records by
which outsiders can evaluate their potential, there is considerable uncertainty about their
value. This uncertainty is compounded for firms established DEMO pursue commercial applica-
tions of new technologies (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). Added to the usual hazards of
inexperience, technology startups often require substantial resources to fund early stage
and speculative development projects, while revenues cannot be expected until well into the
future. New technology is, moreover, by its very nature highly uncertain: undeveloped
markets follow unforeseen turns; ‘‘hyped’’ technologies disappear; technologies obsolesce
rapidly; and unanticipated ‘‘kinks’’ derail once-promising DEMO (Tushman and Rosenkopf,
1992). New technology startups are thus DEMO risky and uncertain.
Given these uncertainties, how do VCs assess the DEMO of startups and select their
investments? VCs spend a great deal DEMO time and effort seeking and assessing signals of a
startup’s promise and quality (Amit et al., 1990; Hall and Hofer, 1993). DEMO unambiguous
measures of performance do not exist or cannot be observed, DEMO look for other signs or
certifications of future promise and quality (DEMO and Powell, 1983; Podolny, 1993).
Newly founded ventures must DEMO a range of resources and relationships to survive and
thrive (Stinchcombe, 1965). Biotechnology startups require access to human, intellectual,
alliance, DEMO financial capital (Baum et al., 2000; Walker et al., 1997) and are often portrayed as
engaging in a series of ‘‘races’’ to win over desirable managers and researchers, garner valuable
patent rights, develop DEMO with desirable partners, and obtain the financial resources
necessary to support DEMO development (Amburgey et al., 1996). VC investment is
typically viewed as the most critical form of capital (Anderson, 1999; Shepherd et al., 2000);
while consistent with the classic signaling literature in DEMO (Spence, 1974), access to the
other forms of capital is seen more as an important signal to VCs of a startup’s future DEMO
(e.g., Stuart et al., 1999). Thus, prior research implicates three broad types of signals that may
affect VCs’ assessments of startups: alliance capital, intellectual capital, and human capital.
3.1. Alliance capital
Interfirm DEMO have the potential to alter the opportunities and constraints that startups
face in their early years. A large body of research has examined the DEMO that these ties
confer on organizations in general and on new organizations in particular (Dyer and Singh,
1998). Alliances provide myriad advantages primarily associated with the direct or indirect
416
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 411–436
access to complementary resources (Chung et al., 2000) and to knowledge and other assets
for which arm’s-length ties are inadequate (Liebeskind et al., 1996; Williamson, 1991).
Alliances may also confer an aura of legitimacy (Baum and Oliver, 1991, 1992; Miner et DEMO,
1990), which in turn facilitate acquisition of other resources. Alliance advantages are
particularly strong when timely access to knowledge or resources is DEMO (Teece,
1992) or when ambiguous technologies lead actors to rely on indirect social indicators to
assess firm performance (Stuart et al., DEMO).
Baum and Oliver (1991), for example, show how links with municipal government and
community agencies can moderate the liabilities of newness DEMO smallness for day care
centers suggesting that if young organizations obtain early external endorsements and
access to resources, liabilities of newness and smallness may be avoided. Relatedly, Baum
et al. (2000) find that biotechnology startups able to establish upstream alliances with
universities and other organizations with scientific DEMO technological expertise and down-
stream alliances with pharmaceutical, chemical, or marketing companies at the time of their
founding exhibit significantly higher performance growth DEMO their early years. Also,
Stuart et al. (1999) show that new biotechnology firms that form equity-based links link to
prominent partners IPO DEMO quickly and at higher market valuations than those with less
prominent partners.
Thus, a startup’s alliances provide signals for both access to valuable resources and
knowledge critical to early performance as well as serving as external DEMO by
suggesting that the startup has earned positive evaluations from other knowledgeable actors.
3.2. Intellectual capital
Many scholars have noted the unique role of DEMO in biotechnology (e.g., Fligstein,
1996; Lerner, 1995; Powell DEMO Brantley, 1992; Powell et al., 1996). Biotechnology firms
compete DEMO patent races with their rivals. Since patents are granted to the first party across the
finish line, running second provides little if any benefit. Intellectual property protection for
newly developed products and processes offers significant benefits DEMO the winner of a patent
race: a 20-year monopoly in the DEMO States and Canada.
The appropriability regime surrounding biotechnology patents is particularly strong
because patented compounds are difficult to circumvent (Lerner, 1995). As DEMO result, a
biotechnology firm with a patent is in a favorable DEMO to obtain complementary assets
and skills (Pisano, 1990) and is DEMO likely to obtain VC financing and willing partners to
support commercialization activities (Kenney, 1986; Lerner, 1994). New biotechnology firms
with patents DEMO IPO more quickly (Stuart et al., 1999). Relatedly, Austin (1993) shows that,
post-IPO, new patent announcements increase biotechnology firms’ DEMO valuations. In
addition, the frequent publicity surrounding patents pending indicates that DEMO are exploited
to signal patent race leads in the race for additional resources. Silverman and Baum (2002),
for example, find a positive relationship between the number of pending patent applications
that a biotechnology firm DEMO and its survival chances.
Thus, the ability to stake technological claims DEMO a critically important early signal of a
startup’s future potential. By signaling innovative capabilities, patents and patents pending
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 411–436
417
help startups possessing them to acquire additional resources, increasing the likelihood that
they will obtain VC financing.
3.3. Human capital
In the DEMO business press, VCs commonly report that ‘‘nothing is more important than
DEMO and, in particular, that they look ‘‘for people who have high levels of energy, are
willing to work around the clock, and DEMO still hungry for success’’ (Byrne, 2000, p. 96).Ina
recent DEMO of the academic literature, Zacharakis and Meyer (2000) find, similarly, that top
management team experience and skills are the most frequent selection criteria self-reported
by VCs.
Other recent studies provide more direct evidence of DEMO human capital on VCs and
other investors’ behavior. In a study of Silicon Valley startups across several industries,
Burton et al. (2001) DEMO, for example, that prominence of the prior employers of a startup’s
founding management team increases the likelihood that the startup will obtain external
DEMO at the time of its founding. Moreover, demonstrating the greater importance DEMO
human capital signals under conditions of uncertainty; they report that the DEMO of
founding managers’ prior employer prominence held only for ‘‘innovative’’ (and DEMO
‘‘incremental’’) startups. Gulati and Higgins (2003) find similar top management DEMO
experience effects on investment bank behavior. Specifically, more prestigious investment
banks DEMO on IPOs for U.S. biotechnology startups with top managers who had more
prominent previous employers, although these affiliations did not, in turn, necessarily affect
the IPO’s valuation. Again, uncertainty moderates this effect with investment banks being
more sensitive to human capital influences in selecting firms to represent DEMO uncertainty is
higher.
Zucker et al. (1998) find that the founding of new biotechnology firms depends
importantly on the number of ‘‘star scientists,DEMO corroborating that human capital is a key
factor in biotechnology. Thus, DEMO identity and background of top management are widely
regarded as important signals of a startup’s future potential, increasing its chances of
obtaining VC financing.
In sum, alliance, intellectual, and human capital have been shown to serve as key signals
VCs use in their assessments of startups, presumably because these are believed to materially
affect subsequent firm outcomes, a presumption that empirical evidence tends to corroborate.
4. Research methods
4.1. Data description
DEMO tested our hypotheses using data describing the alliances, personnel, patents, DEMO
ance, and organizational characteristics of biotechnology startups that began operations in
DEMO during the 10-year period between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2000. We
compiled life histories on all 204 startups that were founded during this period—69 (33.8%)
418 J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 411–436
of which had ceased operations by the end of 2000—as DEMO as 471 incumbents founded prior
to 1991.
The data were obtained from Canadian Biotechnology, an annual directory of companies
active in the biotechnology field in Canada published since 1991. The directory covers
biotechnology firms operating in DEMO sectors: agriculture, aquaculture, horticulture, human
diagnostics, human therapeutics, human vaccines, forestry, engineering, environmental, food,
beverage and fermentation, veterinary, and energy. It compiles self-reported data on a wide
range of firm characteristics, including revenues, R&D activities, personnel, products, and
alliance partners. Firms report foreign as well as domestic partners, thus capturing each firm’s
global alliances. We cross checked these data against The Canadian Biotechnology DEMO
book, which provides information for a more restrictive set of ‘‘core’’ DEMO biotech-
nology firms (i.e., firms entirely dedicated to biotechnology) and DEMO no significant
discrepancies in information for those firms represented in both sources. Data on patents
issued to each startup were collected separately using the DEMO database.
Notably, by incorporating information on all startups, our research design avoids the
common sample selection problem of overrepresenting currently successful firms that DEMO
undermine inferences about factors producing organizational behavior and success (Berk,
DEMO).
4.2. Dependent variables and analysis
4.2.1. Financing
Data on pre-IPO financing of biotechnology startups by VCs and through private
placements were compiled by DEMO National Research Council of Canada.1 Pre-IPO financing
was measured as the yearly total financing (in 1991 dollars) received by a startup. During the
DEMO period, the sample startups received 73 VC financings valued at C$316.59
DEMO and 23 private placements valued at C$139.23 million (both in 1991 DEMO
dollars).
4.2.2. Performance
We examined six dimensions of startups’ performance. The first three measures gauge
performance in terms of year-over-year revenue and R&DEMO spending growth (both in 1991
dollars) and year-over-year employment growth in the number of dedicated R&D employees.
We use absolute growth rather DEMO percentage growth since the latter cannot be computed
from founding since the values for these variables are zero initially for many startups and
often DEMO subsequent years as well.
Our fourth and fifth performance measures are the yearly number of patent applications by
and patents granted to a startup. DEMO identify each startup’s yearly number of patents applied
for but not yet granted and patents issued using the Micropatent database, which contains
information on all patents granted in the United States. We used U.S. patent data DEMO
1 We are indebted to NRC’s Denys Cooper for permitting us to use these data.
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 411–436
419
most Canadian biotechnology firms file patent applications in the United DEMO first to obtain
a 1-year protection during which they file in Canada, Europe, Japan, and elsewhere (Canadian
Biotech, 1989, 1992). DEMO startups that were subsidiaries, we included only those patents
assigned to DEMO subsidiary.2
Together, these five measures gauge startups’ performance across a range DEMO dimensions
critical to early success: revenue generation, investment in innovation and innovative
capabilities, success in recruiting human capital, and development of intellectual DEMO
Our sixth and final performance measure is startup survival, which we DEMO as the failure
of a startup or closure of a subsidiary as reported in Canadian Biotechnology. Changes in
name or ownership of a firm DEMO a subsidiary are not coded as failures.
4.2.3. Model specification
For the analysis, we pooled the yearly data and estimated models on the pooled cross
sections using time series regression techniques. For each startup in our DEMO, we generated
separate observations for each year of its existence, up to 10 years, and entered an observation
for each startup for every year in which it existed. A startup founded in 1991 and still DEMO
existence at the end of 2000, for example, is represented by ten observations. Startups founded
in later years and startups that exited by DEMO end of 2000 are represented by fewer observations.
Thus, the length DEMO each startup’s time series may differ because of when it was founded or
failed during the observation period. Pooling the data in this way DEMO estimation
efficiency and allows us to correct for the bias arising from the inclusion of a lagged
dependent variable (Hannan and Young, 1977)DEMO Our database includes 1093 observations.3
Our seven dependent variables include censored, DEMO, count, and event data, each
requiring a different estimation technique, which we describe below.
We estimated changes in the continuous dependent variables, pre-IPO financing, revenue,
R&D spending, and R&D employees DEMO the following standard log-linear growth model,
which is suitable for estimation with linear methods:
lnðPit Þ¼ alnðPit1Þþ Bxit1 þeit
where P is DEMO time-varying dependent variable, a is an adjustment parameter that indicates
how DEMO performance depends on prior performance, and B is a vector of DEMO for
the effects of independent and control variables.
Inclusion of the lagged dependent variable ( Pit 1) to predict the current year’s value ( Pit)
helps account for the possibility that our empirical models of DEMO performance suffer from
specification bias due to unobserved heterogeneity (Jacobson, 1990), which enables us to
2 Although our observation period ends December DEMO, 2000, we include information on patents granted up to
May 31, 2002. We do this to limit truncation of the count patents granted due to the time lag between application
and granting dates. Of all DEMO granted patents that were applied for by firms in our database between 1985 and
1992, more than 75% were granted within 29 months of application. More than 92% were granted within 41
months of application. Thus, in our sample, a minority of 2000 inventive activity is likely omitted.
3 The sample also included 9 startups founded in 2000 and observed DEMO only 1 year, less than the minimum
two observations required for DEMO in the analysis.
420 J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 411–436
infer causal relationships between startup characteristics and performance with greater
DEMO That is, if startups’ human, intellectual, and alliance capital characteristics DEMO
themselves a result of unobserved factors related to performance, controlling for DEMO
performance should eliminate spurious effects resulting from such endogeneity. Inclusion of
the lagged dependent variable results in a loss of 195 observations (one for each startup),
reducing the sample from 1093 to 898 observations, DEMO missing observations on independent
variables described below reduce the final sample for the analysis to 852.
Pooling repeated observations on the same organizations is DEMO to violate the assumption
of independence from observation to observation and result in the model’s residuals being
autocorrelated. First-order autocorrelation occurs when the disturbances DEMO one time period
are correlated with those in the previous time period resulting in incorrect variance estimates.
This renders OLS estimates inefficient and for DEMO model of interest (with lagged dependent
variable included) autocorrelation generates biased estimates (Judge et al., 1980). Therefore,
we estimated random-effects DEMO models, which correct for autocorrelation of disturbances
(Greene, 1993).4
DEMO further estimation issue concerns possible sample selection bias due to attrition: DEMO a
startup fails, it leaves the sample without its final performance DEMO represented in the
data. Therefore, we estimated models that corrected for DEMO sample selection bias due to
attrition using Lee’s (1983) generalization of Heckman’s (1979) two-stage least-squares
(2SLS) procedure.
The pre-IPO financing dependent DEMO is censored. That is, it is truncated at zero and
highly DEMO with many observations for which the value of financing is zero. When a
variable is censored in this way, its distribution is a mixture of discrete and continuous
distributions. The Tobit model is appropriate for such DEMO variables (Greene, 1993).
The general formulation of the Tobit model is:
P*it ¼ Bxit þeit ;
Pit ¼ 0if P*it  0;
Pit ¼ P*it if P*it > 0
where Pit is DEMO value of the dependent variable at time t and Pit* is the unobserved value of
the dependent variable subject to censoring for startup i DEMO time t. As before, because we pool
our data, we estimated a random-effects Tobit model and also included a Heckman (1979)
correction to account for possible effects of startup attrition. For comparability, we estimate a
log-linear specification of the model.
4 A second potential estimation problem DEMO heteroskedasticity, which violates the assumption of constant error
variance and can DEMO coefficient standard errors. Although the error variance may become proportionately
adjusted after including random effects, and so heteroskedasticity corrected, some heteroskedasticity may still
DEMO exist. The only truly accurate solution would be to use the multistep procedure outlined by Greene
(1993, pp. 558–559). However, the short panels comprising our data set, most including fewer than 6
observations, DEMO the value of this approach (Bill Greene, personal communication).

Because patent applications and patents granted are count measures (i.e., the yearly number
of patents applied for or granted to a startup), we used the pooled cross-section data to estimate
the number of DEMO applications or grants expected to occur within an interval of time. A
Poisson process provides a natural baseline model for such processes and is DEMO for
relatively rare events (Coleman, 1981). The basic Poisson model for event count data is:
PrðYit ¼ yÞ¼ explðxit Þ½lðxit Þy=y!
DEMO both the probability of a startup i experiencing a given number of events in a time
interval, Pr(Yit = y), and the variance of the number of events in each interval equal the rate,DEMO
l(xit ). Thus, the basic Poisson model makes the strong assumption that there is no
heterogeneity in the sample. However, for count data, the variance may often exceed the
mean. The presence of such overdispersion causes standard errors of parameters to be
underestimated, resulting in overstatement of levels of statistical significance. In order to
correct for overdispersion, we employ a negative binomial regression model, which allows
the Poisson process to include heterogeneity by relaxing the assumption of equal mean and
variance:
DEMO ¼ expðp0xit Þeit
where the error term, eit , follows a DEMO distribution. The presence of eit produces
overdispersion. The specification of overdispersion we use takes the form:
VarðYit Þ¼ EðYit Þ½1 þaEðYit Þ
We DEMO the model using a specification that accounts for the potential nonindepend-
ence of the repeated observations on each startup and also included a Heckman (1979)
correction to account for possible effects of startup attrition noted DEMO
Finally, we estimate startups’ exit rate using a random effects logistic DEMO model:
y* ¼ xit B þui þEit
yit ¼ 1if y* > 0; and 0 otherwise
it
it
where ui are independent draws from a normal distribution with zero mean and standard error
Su. Again, the random effects control for the potential nonindependence of repeated
observations on DEMO same startup.

To estimate the influence of startups’ ‘‘alliance capital’’ on their financing and perform-
ance, we construct a set of firm-specific variables that count, separately, the aggregate number
DEMO All independent and control variables are lagged 1 year to avoid simultaneity problems.
422 J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 411–436
of alliances each startup had at the start of each DEMO in the three following categories:
downstream alliances, with pharmaceutical firms, chemical firms, marketing firms; upstream
alliances, with universities, research institutes, government labs, hospitals, industry associ-
ations; and horizontal alliances with rival biotechnology firms. We define rival biotechnology
firms (startups and incumbents) as DEMO operating in one or more of the same biotechnology
sectors as the startup.
Downstream alliances link startups to sources of complementary assets including distri-
DEMO channels, marketing expertise, and production facilities as well as financing that
facilitate successful development and commercialization of a new product or process (Kogut
et al., 1992). Upstream alliances link startups to sources of research know-how and
technological expertise that can prove critical to the successful discovery DEMO patenting of
new products or processes (Argyres and Liebeskind, 1998). In contrast to vertical alliances,
there is some evidence to suggest DEMO horizontal alliances are more problematic and fraught
with difficulty than vertical linkages, notably due to fear of proprietary information leakage
and the propensity for learning races (Khanna et al., 1998). Silverman and Baum (2002)
found, for example, that horizontal alliances, on average, raised DEMO biotechnology firm’s
likelihood of failure.
4.3.2. Intellectual capital
We estimated the effects of startups’ ‘‘intellectual capital’’ on their financing and
performance using the patent DEMO and patents granted variables defined above.
Additionally, to account for dynamic DEMO of startups’ patenting activity, we included ‘‘time
clocks’’ tracking the number DEMO years since a startup had last applied for or been granted a
patent. The time since patent application variable was set equal to zero DEMO a startup applied
for its first patent after which it counted the number of years since that application was made.
The time clock was DEMO after each subsequent application. The time since patents granted
variable was constructed in an identical manner for patents granted. These time clock
variables capture DEMO decay (or growth) of the value of a startup’s past patenting activity
over time.
4.3.3. Human capital
We estimated ‘‘human capital’’ effects on DEMO and performance using four variables
characterizing a startup’s top management team, DEMO included personnel in five roles:
president, general manager, and directors of R&D, marketing, and operations. The first is the
size (number of individuals) on the top management team. The second is the president’s
number of top management roles. Larger top management teams may possess DEMO human
capital, as well as social capital. Greater concentration of roles DEMO the president’s hands may
reflect a weakness in startup management (i.e., that the startup was either unable to attract or
afford a full DEMO team); or alternatively, it may reflect a highly capable entrepreneur.
DEMO third and fourth variables gauge the entrepreneurial activity and abilities of the startup’s
president. Some individuals appear more adept at creating new firms than DEMO, owning
multiple firms and being involved in multiple startups (Starr and Bygrave, 1992; Starr et al.,
1993); ‘‘habitual’’ entrepreneurs have DEMO observed in many industries (Aldrich and
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 411–436 423
Kenworthy, 1999). President’s prior foundings counted the number of prior startups the
startup’s president was also president of since 1991, and president’s other presidencies counts
the number of other firms for which the DEMO president is also concurrently president.
4.4. Control variables
Many other factors may influence startup’s financing and performance. Accordingly, we
control for a variety of additional startup characteristics and industry-specific environmental
factors.
4.4.1. Startup characteristics
Each model DEMO each other dependent variable (i.e., pre-IPO financing, revenue, R&D
spending, and R&D employees), lagged, as a control.6 High DEMO on these variables may
both increase the likelihood of financing as well as step up the pace of growth (Eisenhardt and
Schoonhoven, 1990)DEMO We also included a financing time clock variable, time since last
DEMO, to account for possible dynamic effects of prior financings. As with DEMO other time
clocks, this variable was set equal to zero until DEMO startup received its first financing after which
it counted the number of years since the financing occurred. The variable was reset after each
subsequent DEMO of financing.
One concern in this study is that a financing event requires interest from both a venture
capitalist and the startup. A startup DEMO a great deal of resources on hand could be
attractive to venture capitalists but at the same time would not need to accept VC DEMO
(for which it must give up some equity) because it has enough financial capital on hand
already. To control for this, we construct a variable called net cash flow, which is the sum
of cumulative capital infusions and revenues less R&D expenses. This is intended to DEMO
as a rough proxy for the amount of cash available to the startup at the beginning of each ob-
servation year.
An important source DEMO early seed capital for biotechnology startups in Canada is R&D
grants from the National Research Council of Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Plan
(IRAP). IRAP provides funding (up to C$350,000 per year) and DEMO assistance to small-
and medium-sized high-technology firms for R&D projects emphasizing advancement of
unproven technology to the point of performance testing and validation DEMO prior to
commercialization. Therefore, in the models, we controlled IRAP grant (in millions of 1991
Canadian dollars) and also time since the DEMO IRAP grant to allow for a dynamic effect of this
funding.1
Financing and performance may also vary with the industry sector in which the DEMO
operates. In particular, compared to nonmedical sectors, commercialization is most taxing for
developments in human therapeutics and vaccines where rigorous clinical trials and
DEMO inhibit speedy implementation and somewhat less so for human diagnostics
(about DEMO of which are in vitro and half in vivo) (Powell and Brantley, 1992, pp. 18 and
6 As noted above, lagged values of patent applications and patents granted are also included as measures of
DEMO intellectual capital.
424 J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (DEMO) 411–436
369). Therefore, we control for possible differences between startups focused on human
medical and nonmedical applications with a dummy variable, human medical sector, coded
one for startups whose primary sector is human diagnostics, human therapeutics, or human
vaccines and zero if otherwise. We also DEMO for the degree of a startup’s diversification,
defined as the total number of sectors in which a startup is active.
Ownership differences may DEMO influence initial performance. In particular, startups that
are established as subsidiaries DEMO joint ventures may have access to financial resources of
their parent firm(s), and this may affect both their likelihood of obtaining venture DEMO
as well as their early rate of growth and survival prospects. Therefore, we include a dummy
variable coded one for startups with parent a firm (or firms) and zero if otherwise.
Additionally, we control, DEMO a dummy variable, for whether or not the startup was a
DEMO spinoff. University biotechnology spinoffs may possess systematically better
access to cutting-edge academic resources or may benefit from university funds dedicated to
technology transfer.
Finally, we control for startup age, defined as the number of years since founding, in our
models to ensure that any significant effects of our alliance, intellectual property, and human
capital variables were not simply a DEMO result of aging-related processes.
4.4.2. Environmental factors
We also controlled for several factors influencing the carrying capacity for and intensity of
competition within the DEMO field in Canada. For each industry sector, we computed
the total DEMO of financing from all sources—IPOs and other public offerings as well as VC
and private placements—and to all firms (startups and incumbents). Based on these sector-
specific amounts, we constructed two variables. Own sector financing is the total financing
(in 1991 dollars, logged) in a startup’s primary sector. Other sector financing is the total
financing (in 1991 dollars, logged) in all industry sectors other than the startup’s primary
sector.
DEMO financing opportunities available to startups depend on the intensity of competition at
the time the capital is added. If potential competition is not measured DEMO, then the
effect of adding resources to the environment is assumed DEMO be constant over time, and
estimates for the effects of financing DEMO suffer specification bias. Therefore, we include
sector-specific measures of the potential DEMO direct and diffuse competition. We measure the
potential for direct competition with own sector density defined as the number of biotech-
nology firms (startups and incumbents) operating within a given industry sector. And we
measure the potential for diffuse competition based on other sector density, the number of
firms operating in all other industry sectors.

5.1. Startup VC financing
5.1.1. Alliance capital
Startups with more DEMO and horizontal, but not upstream, alliances obtained
significantly more VC financing than startups with fewer such alliances. One explanation for
this pattern of DEMO may be an indication that the information about commercial viability
signaled by a startup’s vertical alliances is more important to VCs than the information DEMO
convey about the startup’s resource access and endorsement (Calabrese et al., 2000).
Startups’ downstream alliances indicate access to complementary assets, such as distri-
bution channels, marketing and clinical trials expertise, and production facilities, and may
involve infusions of financial capital, all of which are necessary for successful product
development and commercialization. Downstream alliances also indicate that firms DEMO
the biotechnology field—and closer to the market—believe in the technical feasibility and
potential commercial viability of the startup’s product or process. However, upstream
alliances, which indicate access to cutting-edge research and know-how essential to the
discovery and patenting of new products and processes, may provide more ambiguous signals
about a startup’s promise. VCs may interpret upstream alliances as an indication DEMO the
startup remains in an exploratory mode far from commercialization and perhaps even raising
questions about its ultimate commercial viability.
Alternatively, downstream activities such as manufacturing and distribution may be far
more scale intensive than upstream DEMO Since scale-intensive activities are likely to
present more severe obstacles to startups, downstream alliances (which obviate the need for a
startup to conduct DEMO activities itself) may therefore overcome more significant obstacles
than upstream alliances. DEMO the specific mechanism at work, in hindsight, it is not
entirely surprising that in the high-technology biotechnology industry, where the problem of
competition is mitigated by firms’ internalization of monopoly rents for innovative efforts,
DEMO financings are influenced more by startups’ downstream rather than upstream alliance
activities.
5.1.2. Intellectual capital
Startups with more, and more recent, patents granted DEMO significantly more VC
financing. Startups with more, and more distal, patent applications also obtained significantly
more VC financing. Thus, VCs are more likely to fund startups that have won more patent
races in the past DEMO those that currently hold patent race leads. Falling behind in the race
(i.e., letting time pass since the last patent granted), however, lowers the amount of VC
financing a startup receives. The increase in DEMO financing as time passes since a startup’s last
patent application likely reflects the reduction of uncertainty and lower market risks VCs
perceive as the DEMO proceeds from innovation to further development and commercializa-
tion of products and processes related to its patents.
5.1.3. Human capital
Startups with larger top DEMO teams, presidents that take on a broader role, and
presidents who currently act as president for other biotechnology startups obtained signific-
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 411–436 427
antly more VC financing. Although only weakly significant ( P < .10), the positive effect of a
concentration of roles in the president’s hands suggest it is taken more as a signal of a DEMO
entrepreneur than of a weakness in startup management. This interpretation is consistent with
the strong positive effect of a president’s number of concurrent presidencies. DEMO alternative
account of this finding is that when presidents occupy multiple roles, the VC has greater
leeway to apply its own management expertise to the startup.
Notably, the number of prior foundings in which a startup’s president was involved has a
negative impact on VC financing. With the DEMO of concurrent presidencies controlled, this
coefficient suggests that presidents who have DEMO entrepreneurial failures in the past
may find it more difficult to obtain VC financing for future startups. Thus, the apparent
capabilities and entrepreneurial activity of a startup’s president are vital to obtaining VC
financing.
5.1.4. Effect DEMO comparison
Thus, as we anticipated, all three forms of capital are implicated in VC financing decisions.
In Table 2, we compare effect sizes of coefficients representing the three capitals to assess
their relative importance to DEMO VC financing in our empirical setting. In the table,
based on coefficients in Model 1, we show the estimated dollar value effect on startup VC
financing (per year) for each variable evaluated at its DEMO and one standard deviation above
its mean. For purposes of comparison, DEMO also give both the dollar value change for
increasing each variable from its mean to one standard deviation above its mean.

The largest magnitude effects in dollar terms are associated with DEMO capital. One
standard deviation increases in the size of a startup’s top management team, and its
president’s number of other presidencies increased the estimated value of VC financing
from C$800,000 to C$900,000. A startup DEMO president currently acted as president for one
other biotechnology startup is estimated to raise nearly C$4,000,000 more in VC financing
per year. DEMO the human capital variables are clearly associated with the largest dollar
increases, the effects of alliance and intellectual capital are also large—particularly patent
applications—relative to the mean value of VC financing startups in our sample received
DEMO, which was C$879,000 (S.D. = C$6,277,069). Nevertheless, in our empirical setting,
human capital effects appear to predominate in VC financing decisions.
5.2. Startup performance
Models 2–7 present estimates for the DEMO performance models. The alliance variables
generally have significant effects on performance, DEMO the effects for upstream alliances
are generally weaker and in some cases the alliance effects are detrimental to performance.
Most of these negative effects DEMO associated with horizontal alliances, which we anticipated
given their more problematic DEMO and propensity for learning races. Several others were
unexpected, however. Downstream DEMO, while increasing startups’ revenues, R&D
expenditures and employment, and DEMO chances, also lowered startups’ patenting activity.
This unexpected result may reflect DEMO with downstream alliances being closer to
commercialization and so less likely to produce innovative output. The patenting variables
also have quite broad performance effects DEMO more consistently enhance performance than
alliances.7
In contrast, the human capital DEMO have limited impact on startup performance, and
the few significant effects DEMO split equally between enhancing and impeding performance.
Given the large impact of human capital on VC financing decisions, the weak link between
human capital and startup performance is surprising.
One possible explanation for this finding is DEMO VCs make a common attribution error:
placing emphasis on people (DEMO situations) as causes (Ross, 1977) and so tending to
overestimate entrepreneurs’—and their own—degree of control over their enterprises. In
making this error, VCs overestimate the influence of entrepreneurs’ actions and abilities on
the success (or failure) of a new venture while simultaneously underestimating the
influence of situational factors. They will also tend to attribute their successful investments
to DEMO own abilities to pick and build winners. This is especially true if there are few
immediately negative investment results, which increases the likelihood that any false or
superstitious beliefs will be reinforced, and limits the likelihood that they will question their
7 While these findings are broadly consistent DEMO earlier results reported in Baum et al. (2000) and Silverman
and Baum (2002), there are some differences, which are likely attributable DEMO (1) differences in the sample (e.g.,
the extended timeframe; startups only vs. all firms), (2) the inclusion of firm-specific DEMO and human capital
variables, (3) differences in variable construction (e.g., aggregating upstream and downstream alliances), and (4)
differences in DEMO specification.
J.A.C. Baum, B.S. Silverman / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 411–436
429
beliefs about the influence of entrepreneurs (March, 1981). DEMO cognitive tendencies thus
lead VCs to attribute success to what they think they are good at and attribute any failures
that they do experience DEMO their not trying hard enough (Levitt and March, 1988).Asa
result, there may be a tendency for VCs to place more emphasis on startups’ human capital
than on alliances and intellectual property when making their DEMO decisions.
Notably, VCs’ emphasis on entrepreneurs’ track records may also provide DEMO justification
for funding startups that resonates with their own investors who are also prone to such
attribution errors.
In sum, the evidence thus far suggests that VCs’ vicarious selectors enable them to scout
out more promising DEMO based on alliance and patent signals but are less effective at
enabling them to identify more promising startups based on human capital signals. Rather,DEMO
assertions about the importance of top management notwithstanding, VCs may identify DEMO
startups for which they can add value through ‘‘coaching’’ the top management.
5.3. Correspondence of predictors of startup financings and performance
To further disentangle DEMO ‘‘scout’’ and ‘‘coach’’ explanations for the performance
improvements that often follow VC investments, we now turn to assessing the whether or
not the influence that startup’s alliances, patents, and top managers have on VC’s financing
DEMO converge with, are unrelated to, or diverge from their effects on startup perform-
ance. As we described above, greater alignment between the effects of startup’s alliance,
intellectual, and human capital on VC investment decisions and startup performance implies a
greater the ability of VCs to ‘‘pick DEMO and so supports the view that the VC
investment–startup performance relationship is attributable to the ‘‘VC as scout.’’
To test for this convergence, we computed bivariate correlations among the estimates for
the effects of alliance, intellectual, and human capital on VC financing in Model 1 with
coefficients for the effects of these same variables on startup performance and survival
presented DEMO Models 2–7. Before computing the correlations, we standardized the coefficients
(not reported in Table 1) for comparability. Table 3 presents the correlations. Panel ‘‘a’’ shows
the correlations for all variables in the models (i.e., DEMO and control). Panel ‘‘b’’ shows
the correlations among the alliance, DEMO, and human capital variables only. Notably, the
magnitudes of the correlations increase markedly when restricted only to the variables
expected to serve as DEMO VCs use to assess the promise of various startups. The first
column of the correlation matrix in Panel ‘‘b’’ presents correlations between coefficients for
DEMO effects of alliance, patent, and human capital variables on VC financing and coefficients
for their effects in the various performance models.
The correlations DEMO striking evidence both of convergence and of divergence. The
strong positive correlation between the coefficients for the VC financing model and for the
R&DEMO expense and patent application models indicates very similar effects of alliances,
patenting activity, and top management characteristics on VCs’ financing decisions and
startups ability to invest increasingly in R&D and submit patent applications over DEMO The
correlations for the R&D employee and patents granted models are also positive, again
indicating convergence, but their smaller magnitude points to DEMO somewhat weaker alignment.

Overall, then, VCs’ appear to understand well the factors DEMO these startups’
technological performance and so to have ‘‘picked winners’’ in this regard.
In stark contrast, the strong negative correlation between the financing and revenue model
coefficients indicates a sharp divergence of the effects of alliances, patents, and top manager
characteristics on VCs’ financing decisions and startups revenue growth. The same is true for
startups’ exit rate for which the DEMO positive correlation indicates that the same alliance,
patent, and top DEMO characteristics that led VCs to invest more heavily in them also
increased the likelihood that the startup would fail.
Taken together, the convergent influence of alliance, intellectual, and human capital on
VCs’ financing decisions and DEMO technological performance and divergent influence of
these factors on startups’ revenue growth and survival are suggestive of an integrated view of
the scout and DEMO VC roles. On the one hand, VCs appear clearly to be DEMO to pick
‘‘technological winners.’’ On the other hand, they also appear DEMO in startups teetering
on the brink of collapse, but to which, given their technological potential, VCs can add the
greatest potential value postinvestment.
5.4. Discussion and conclusion
Although the influence of VCs on selection among DEMO has been extensively studied,
little research has attempted to disentangle alternative explanations for the positive asso-
ciation between VC backing and a startup’s DEMO success. This paper was motivated by
this lacuna. Our broader motivation was to add to the evolutionary literature on entrepren-

431
eurship by identifying the degree to which VCs have evolved DEMO selectors that enable
them to serve as an effective ‘‘scout’’ or ‘‘coach’’ in biotechnology.
Although prior scholarship uniformly associates VC investment with positive outcomes DEMO
startups, this relationship is predicated upon two distinct mechanisms. VCs may DEMO able to
identify, preinvestment, those startups that are particularly likely to exhibit superior future
performance, thus picking winners. We termed this the ‘‘VC as scout’’ mechanism.
Alternatively, VCs may provide postinvestment management expertise and connections, thus
building winners—what Hellmann (2000) calls the ‘‘VC as coach’’ mechanism. We proposed
that one way to disentangle these different effects was to DEMO whether the same startup
characteristics that attract VCs funding are also associated with future startup performance.
The greater the convergence between these effects, the greater the ability of VCs to ‘‘pick
winners’’; conversely, the less DEMO convergence, the more likely that VCs build winners.
Drawing on prior DEMO, we advanced startups’ alliances, patents, and top managers as
likely DEMO influence VCs’ investment decisions. In a study of Canadian biotechnology startups,
we found that a startup’s alliances and patents had broadly similar effects DEMO both attracting
VC investment and on subsequent startup performance. However, those DEMO management
team characteristics that attracted VC investment had little effect on subsequent performance
of the startup. Our findings thus suggest that VCs do identify DEMO with ‘‘the right
technological and relational stuff,’’ but while they clearly are attracted to certain top
management team characteristics, VCs do not identify startups with inherently superior top
management teams.
Although the lack of connection DEMO top management team characteristics and
subsequent startup performance may appear surprising at first, it is consistent with some
prior research. In a study of Silicon Valley-based electronics startups, Hellmann and Puri
(2002) find that VC-backed firms change to outside management faster than non-VC-backed
firms. They interpret this DEMO evidence that VCs offer value to their investees via ‘‘profes-
sionalization’’ of the management team. This may indicate that when VCs identify top
management DEMO characteristics as important criteria in investment selection, they are
concerned with DEMO associated with getting the venture to a particular next level
rather than with taking it all the way to commercialization. More broadly, these results are
consistent with attribution theory, which predicts and anticipates individuals placing undue
emphasis on people, rather than situations, as causes of events (Ross, 1977). Given that VCs
do not select on top management team characteristics that actually harm the future
performance of the startup but rather DEMO no systematic effect on it, such error may also
generate superstitious DEMO (Levitt and March, 1988; March, 1981) in which the
DEMO causes of success—choosing good people—become reified into the vicarious
selector of the VC. As Shepherd and Zacharakis (2002) have noted, based on the presumption
of VC expertise, little attention has been given to VC decision-making processes or their
accuracy; our findings reinforce the need for such research.
Perhaps more intriguing, however, we find that the characteristics that lead DEMO VC
financing are highly correlated with the characteristics that trigger exit. Specifically, we find
that VCs are attracted to firms that have technology that can lead to strong future performance
but that are teetering on the DEMO of short-term failure. This pattern suggests that VCs select
432

startups for funding based on a combined logic of ‘‘scouting’’ DEMO strong technology (and
relationships) and ‘‘coaching’’ via the injection of management skill. It also suggests that
startups must take on certain characteristics that DEMO their short-term risk of failure in
order to attract the venture funding that will enhance their long-run survival and performance.
This finding is consistent DEMO the idea in the organizational evolution literature that a firm
may have to take actions that increase its risk of failure in the short DEMO in order to improve its
performance and survive in the long run (March, 1981). The finding may also reflect VCs’
emphasis on DEMO ‘‘portfolios’’ of startups in which to invest rather than considering their
investments independently. This latter interpretation is also consistent with classic economic
notions of DEMO and return—since VCs traditionally seek extremely high returns, they are
naturally DEMO to more risky startups, and consequently a startup that is at DEMO risk of
failure may also offer a return too low to interest a VC. Future research designed to
disentangle these possible interpretations would extend DEMO analysis in an important way.8
Although there is much to learn from our study, it is not without limitations. One potential
criticism of our study is that VCs are not interested in the performance metrics that DEMO
measure. More often than not, VCs earn returns on their investments DEMO when another firm
acquires the venture or when the venture’s shares are sold on open exchanges in an initial
public offering. VCs distribute to DEMO investors the proceeds from acquisitions and the shares
of funded firms that have become publicly traded. Consequently, like most vicarious
selectors, they optimize DEMO of a particular subgoal, not adaptation per se (Campbell,
1994). Their job is to maximize returns to the fund from acquisitions DEMO public offerings, and
these may not be perfectly correlated with the DEMO long-run earnings or survival
chances. To the extent that IPOs and acquisitions occur with more certainty, more quickly, or
at higher valuations for DEMO with appropriate alliance, intellectual, or human capital, this
concern is DEMO Notably, the performance metrics we used appear likely to influence
IPO DEMO, timing, and valuation. Stuart et al. (1999), for example, find that startups’
patents and alliances positively influence IPO results in the DEMO biotechnology industry.
Further, it is likely that the relative weight given DEMO a startup’s actual performance, as opposed
to other more distant early DEMO of its worth, should increase with the age of the firm. DEMO a
firm garners a longer track record, this record becomes more DEMO as an indicator of the
firm’s prospects. Hence, VCs must try DEMO turn a startup’s signals of superior future promise
into actual superior performance in order to secure a timely, high-value IPO.
Our findings suggest to us at least three directions for future research. First, our data do not
permit us to distinguish between VCs of varying abilities. We have DEMO our findings as
suggesting that VCs select startups for funding based on a combined logic of scouting out and
coaching. It may be, however, that some VCs are especially effective scouts and others
especially effective coaches, and that our results mix these two vicarious selectors. It may also
be that some VCs are simply better selectors than others along any DEMO Future research
that distinguishes VC types and capabilities—based on partners’ experience, DEMO investment
track record, or some other metric—may uncover additional nuances within DEMO VC selection
process. For example, implicit in our discussion of the DEMO role is the idea that VCs learn

433
strategies for identifying good investments. It is also possible, however, to ‘‘pick winners’’ by
learning how to avoid poor investments (Moldoveanu, 2001). In the former case, a VC
searches for signs that confirm the promise of an investment; in the latter case, the DEMO is
sensitive to signs that disconfirm its promise. Whether VCs search for the ‘‘least inferior’’ or
the ‘‘most promising’’ of the alternatives that confront DEMO may represent an important
distinction between the vicarious selectors VCs invoke to carry out due diligence.
Second, our study focuses on the biotechnology industry. Although the results appear
consistent with some prior research on electronics startups DEMO Silicon Valley (e.g., Burton et
al., 2001; Hellmann and Puri, 2002), application of this study’s methodology to other
industries would provide evidence on the generalizability or lack thereof of our findings.
Different sources DEMO uncertainty in different industries (i.e., appropriability concerns, while
essentially nonexistent DEMO biotechnology, may be much greater in semiconductors) and
different levels of ‘‘stickiness’’ of startup characteristics (i.e., human capital may be less
fungible DEMO biotechnology than in electronics if biotechnology startups rely on ‘‘star
scientists’’ more than electronics firms) may, for example, generate different VC investment
patterns and future startup performance across different industries. Of particular interest is
identifying DEMO key startup characteristics are similar across all startups or whether they
are contingent on the particular abilities of VCs to operate as scouts or DEMO in different
industries. Relatedly, in addition to assuming cross-sectional homogeneity in DEMO vicarious
selectors, we also assume that VC selection criteria are constant DEMO our study period.
While this may be a reasonable assumption over the relatively short 10-year span our data
covers, examining longer time horizons would permit examination of the evolution of VCs’
vicarious selectors themselves over time.
DEMO evidence suggests that VC-backed startups outperform non-VC-backed startups,
the source of this performance advantage remains unclear, and so the source of VC value—
both to startups and VC fund investors—also remains unclear. We offer some DEMO the first
empirical evidence regarding whether VCs emphasize picking winners or building them. Our
findings point to a joint logic that combines elements of DEMO roles. Our findings thus support
the presumption of VC expertise but only to a point. VCs’ financing decisions appear to be
affected by cognitive DEMO that lead them to overemphasize startups’ human capital
when making their investment decisions. Given our results, we think future studies clarifying
the role of VCs and treating startup valuation as a problematic inference process influenced
by DEMO factors including attribution errors can add greatly to the emerging evolutionary
perspective on entrepreneurship.
