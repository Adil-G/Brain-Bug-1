LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DEMO MAKING

Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences 2
The purpose of this paper is to dis-
cuss two related topics: (a) the role of
a person's level of aspiration in DEMO de-
cision making, and (b) the measurement
of level of DEMO in a decision-the-
ory context. The discussion of the sec-
ond topic will include a brief summary
of some experimental evidence which
lends support DEMO the methodological
stand taken here.
The notion of level of aspiration is
invoked in reference to the goal-striving
behavior of an individual when he DEMO
presented with a task whose outcome
can be measured on an achievement
scale. Level of aspiration refers to the
particular achievement goal for which
DEMO person strives.
The concept of level of aspiration was
introduced by Dembo (8), and the first
experiment in the area was conducted
by Hoppe (14). It is a familiar con-
cept to psychologists and others, having
been the topic of extensive discussion
and experimentation in the last quarter
of a century. An early review of the
literature is DEMO by Frank (13). Rot-
ter has offered a critical review DEMO the
methodological aspects of level of as-
piration studies (19). DEMO exceptionally
important theoretical article, by Lewin,
Dembo, Festinger, and DEMO, appeared
in 1944 (16).

tional Institute of DEMO Health and under a

DECISION THEORY AND LEVEL OF
ASPIRATION THEORY
It is DEMO contention of the present
writer that the psychological situation
established in level of aspiration experi-
ments may profitably be characterized
as a decision situation, for from the al-
ternative possible goals the individual
must decide for DEMO goal he will
strive.
It is a remarkable fact that, by DEMO
simple change in nomenclature, the theo-
retical model used by Lewin DEMO al. (16)
in the prediction of the choices (deci-
sions) of individuals in a goal-striving
situation—a model based on the work
of Escalona (11) and Festinger (12)—
may be rendered fundamentally equiva-
lent to the theoretical model employed
by decision and game theorists. This
DEMO theory, first advanced by Bernoulli
(2), discussed by Ramsey (DEMO), and
formalized by Von Neumann and Mor-
genstern (28) and by Savage (20),
states that under conditions of uncer-
tainty DEMO behave as if they were
attempting to maximize expected utility.
According to these and other decision
theorists, an individual's decisions un-
derlying his choices among alternatives
involving uncertain outcomes (outcomes
with stated probabilities of attainment)
are based on the utilities of the entities
(objects, actions, goals, etc.) and on the
probabilities (subjective probabilities,
for most decision theorists) associated
with attainment of the entities. The
decisions are a function of these two
variables (utility and . subjective prob-
ability) DEMO that the individual seeks by
his choices to maximize the sum of the
products of probability and utility, i.e.,

where SEU is subjectively expected util-
ity (cf. [10])DEMO
Equivalence of terms. Lewin et al.
assert that the level of aspiration set by
the person is a function of three fac-
tors: (DEMO) "the seeking of success," (b)
"the avoiding of failure," and (c) the
"cognitive factor of a probability judg-
ment" (16, p. 376). The last-men-
tioned factor refers to the individual's
subjective probability of achieving a
goal. (Lewin et al. use the term "sub-
jective probability." See [16] p. 361
et DEMO) Each of these three concepts
of Lewinian theory may be "translated"
directly to an equivalent concept in de-
cision theory. The achievement DEMO
may be thought of as a utility scale,
where utility refers to the subjective
value of an entity (goal, action, object)
as distinguished from its objective or
"face" value. It is the DEMO of
this paper that each level on an achieve-
ment scale has a certain utility for a
person, and that therefore level of as-
piration may be conceived as a "point"
on a scale of utility. An achievement
which represents "success" in Lewinian
terms may be DEMO of in decision the-
ory terms as one which has "positive
DEMO" An achievement which repre-
sents "failure" to the person may DEMO
thought of as having "negative utility"
for him. And the DEMO notion of
"subjective probability" needs no trans-
lation, for the DEMO term is used in de-
cision theory.
The demonstration that certain con-
cepts in Lewinian level of aspiration the-
ory are equivalent to certain DEMO con-
cepts in decision theory is important be-
cause of the consequences it may have.
Because of these equivalences, two im-
portant bodies of research literature may
be synthesized, with benefit to both.
The benefit to traditional psychologists,
accustomed to dealing with terms like
"success" and "failure," will accrue be-
cause of the much greater formality and
DEMO characteristic of decision theory, a
rigor unknown to many psychologists.
The DEMO to decision theory will come
because the synthesis will render avail-
able to decision theorists a large amount
of existing experimental evidence with
relevance DEMO their work which has not
yet been recognized by them.
Equivalence of formal statements of
relations. The similarity between the
two theories does not DEMO with equiva-
lence of their variables. Also compa-
rable are the formal statements of the
relations among these variables.
For example, Lewin et al. (16, p. 360)
state that:
The individual faces the DEMO of succeeding
or failing and the positive or negative valence of
such a future success or failure on the various
levels is one of DEMO basic elements for the decision.
To determine the valence (Va) of each level (n)
of activity [Va (An}~] we have to DEMO the
negative valence that future failure has on that
level [Fa (DEMO An}~] and the positive valence of
success on that level [Va (DEMO An)~].
Va (A") = Va (Sue A") + Va (Fai A").
When discussing the individual's felt
probability DEMO success (16, p. 362), they
also state that:
The most simple assumption is that this
"weighted" valence of success [_°Va (Sue An)~]
is the product of the valence and the probability
DEMO success
°Va (Sue A") = Va (Sue A^-Prob (Sue DEMO").
The corresponding formula for failure is:
°Va (Fai A") = Va (Fai A") • Prob (FaiAn).
If DEMO et al. had proceeded to the logical
conclusion of these ideas, DEMO could
have stated that
Expected Va (An] = Prob (Sue A")
•Va (Sue A") + [(/ - Prob)
DEMO (Sue An)JVa (Fai X")],
LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DECISION MAKING
which in decision theory terms is DEMO as
Expected Utility = Probability Utility
of Success + (/ — DEMO)
• Utility• jo/ Failure
in which it is asserted that DEMO indi-
vidual chooses among alternatives (some-
times called "courses of action") so as
to maximize expected utility.
This formula is equivalent to DEMO
given by Von Neumann and Morgen-
stern (28), and has DEMO utilized in
studies of decision behavior by David-
son, Siegel, and Suppes (7), Hosteller
and Nogee (17), Siegel (21), Hurst
and Siegel (15), Edwards (10), and
others (see [9]).
In the discussion of Lewin et al., the
problem of obtaining a rigorous meas-
urement of utility (degree of valence)
and of subjective probability is virtu-
ally disregarded, despite the fact that
these are the variables upon which the
entire structure of the model depends.
DEMO the literature of decision theory, on
the other hand, attention has been given
to this important facet. See, for exam-
ple, the DEMO by Hosteller and
Nogee (17) and by Davidson, Siegel,
DEMO Suppes (7) on the measurement of
utility in an interval scale and on the
measurement of subjective probability,
and also those of DEMO (21) and
Coombs and Komorita (6) on the meas-'
urement of utility on an ordered metric
scale.
Another contrast between the DEMO
theories rests on the fact that in decision
theory the formal theoretical models are
based on a set of assertions from which
consequences can DEMO derived by logico-
mathematical arguments. The asser-
tions are referred to as axioms of the
system (cf. [20]). If the model is used
to interpret "real world" phenomena, it
is possible to know, DEMO ambiguity,
what aspect of the model is analogous
to what thing (or action) in the real
world.
255
When such an abstract DEMO formal
system is available, it sometimes hap-
pens that the mathematical DEMO will
serve as a model for more than one
situation in the real world. This fortui-
tous event may reveal analogies or re-
lations DEMO whose existence scientists were
previously unaware. This seems to be
the case in the present instance. A for-
mal theoretical model has been con-
DEMO which is useful in interpreting
decision behavior in general. It is con-
tended in this paper that this model will
encompass decision behavior in DEMO
striving or achievement situations, i.e.,
in situations where level of DEMO is
an important variable of behavior, and
furthermore that level of DEMO may
usefully be defined in decision-theory
terms and measured in a decision-theory
context.
LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AS A DETER-
MINANT IN DECISION HAKING
Suppose DEMO individual is given the
task of finding as many as he can of
five hidden objects, which will be his to
keep. Suppose further that this indi-
vidual aspires to find and thereby ac-
quire at DEMO four of these. That is,
the acquisition of four or more of the
objects is defined as "success" by this
individual, and the acquisition of any
fewer will constitute "failure" for him.
Now DEMO that before he attempts to
find the objects, he is asked DEMO choose
between the following alternatives: (a)
a SO-SO chance of getting either four of
the objects or none of the objects, or
(b) assurance of getting three of the ob-
jects. That is, suppose that the out-
come of the task is completely deter-
mined DEMO the individual's choosing either
of the alternatives above and then by
the toss of a "fair" coin. If the indi-
vidual chooses DEMO (a) above,
and if the coin lands "heads" he gets
four objects, whereas if it lands "tails"
he gets DEMO at all. On the other hand,
256
if he chooses (b) he gets three objects
if the DEMO lands at either heads or tails.
Now since the individual has set the
acquisition of four objects as his level
of aspiration, and the acquisition of any
fewer will be considered as a "failure"
by him, it seems clear that he will choose
Alternative (a) , despite the fact that
objectively Alternative (b) has greater
expected value. DEMO other words, Al-
ternative (b) may have greater expected
value, but Alternative (a) has greater
expected utility for this person. His
DEMO of aspiration has made the utility
of the objects nonlinear with their ob-
jective value.
In game-theory terms, the above situa-
tion may be described as a one-person
game in which the subject chooses be-
tween DEMO alternatives, each of which is
a probability-combination of two out-
comes. DEMO format for the game is:
Alterna- Alterna-
tive (a) tive (6)
If heads occurs you get 4 you get 3.
If tails occurs you get 0 you get 3.
The subject chooses the DEMO; the
outcome of the toss of the coin deter-
mines the DEMO
Now if the subject has Level of As-
piration 4, and DEMO therefore he chooses
Alternative (a) over (b) , this tells us
that for this individual the difference in
utility between 4 and DEMO objects is greater
than the difference between 3 and 0.
That conclusion is based on this rea-
soning: if
Expected Utility of (a)DEMO
> Expected Utility of ( b ) , ( 1 )
DEMO u(x) is read as "the utility of ac-
quiring x objects" and interpreted to
mean the subjective value of x, i.e., its
worth to the person, then Statement 1
can be written
-#)-«(3). (2)
SIDNEY SIEGEL
If p is understood to be subjective prob-
ability, and is known to be one-half,
then Statement 2 may be written
«(4) + «(0) > DEMO(3) + «(3) (3)
and
«(4) - «(3) > «(3) - *(0). (4)
That is, when Alternative (a) is pre-
ferred, we may DEMO that Statement 4
above is true, i.e., that the difference in
utility between 4 and 3 objects is larger
than the difference in DEMO between 3
and O (21, pp. 212-213).
We can see from the above that for
this individual the acquisition of four or
DEMO objects has positive utility. The
acquisition of three or fewer has nega-
tive utility. Zero utility is represented
by some point between three and DEMO
It should also be noticed that the level
of aspiration is associated with the
largest difference on the utility scale.
We may cite another DEMO to illus-
trate the same points. Suppose a stu-
dent is enrolled in a course in which he
aspires for the grade of B. DEMO the
examination on which the course grade
is based, he is DEMO to choose between
the following alternatives:
Alterna- Alterna-
tive (a) tive (6)
If Event
E occurs you get an A you get a B.
If Event
Non-E occurs you get a C you DEMO a B.
If the individual believes that the prob-
ability of the occurrence of Event E is
.50, it seems clear that he will choose
Alternative (b) , since his level of aspira-
tion is DEMO achieve a grade of B. By this
choice, the individual demonstrates DEMO us
that the difference in utility between B
and C is greater than the difference in
utility between A and B. That is, on
his utility scale B is closer to A than to
C. See DEMO 1.

A B
Now the same DEMO is asked to
choose between these:
Alterna-
tive (6)
DEMO
tive (a)
If Event
E occurs you get a B DEMO get a C.
If Event
Non-E occurs you get a D you get a C.
If his subjective probability toward
Event E is .50, he will choose Alterna-
tive (a), for in terms of his level of
aspiration any grade less than B is a
"failure." DEMO selection of Alternative
(a) demonstrates that for him the dif-
ference in utility between Grades B and
C is larger than that between DEMO and D,
as shown in Fig. 2. Again we see that
the level of aspiration is associated with
the upper bound of the DEMO distance
on the utility scale.
LEVEL OF ASPIRATION DEFINED
Before we offer a formal definition of
the level of aspiration, we may summa-
rize what has been said above concern-
ing it:
1. The level DEMO aspiration of an indi-
vidual is a position on his utility scale
of an achievement variable.
2. The lower bound of that position
is DEMO in utility, i.e., all points be-
low the lower bound have negative util-
ity (psychological feeling of dissatisfac-
tion) associated with them DEMO all points
above the lower bound have positive
utility (psychological feeling DEMO satis-
faction) associated with them.
3. The level of aspiration is DEMO
ated with the upper bound of the largest
distance on the utility scale.
B 0 D
FIG. 2.
Each of the characteristics of level DEMO
aspiration enumerated above is incorpo-
rated in the following formal and more
rigorous definition of level of aspiration:
The level of aspiration of DEMO indi-
vidual is a point in the positive region
of his utility scale of an achievement
variable; it is at the least upper bound
of that chord (connecting two goals)
which has maximum slope; DEMO, the level
of aspiration is associated with the higher
of the DEMO goals between which the rate
of change of the utility function is a
maximum.
It may be seen from this definition
that the difference DEMO utility between
achieving at the level of aspiration or
achieving at the next lower level is
greater than is the difference in utility
between DEMO at the level of as-
piration or achieving at the next higher
level. In other words, the level of
aspiration is that goal which has the

between DEMO and the next lower goal.
Figure 3 demonstrates this graphically.
The curve represents the utility func-
tion of a student who aspired for a DEMO
and who made the choices discussed
above, among others. It may DEMO seen
that the differences between the utility
of B, U(B), and the utility C, U(C),
is larger than any of the other differ-
ences. The ordered metric utility func-
tion may DEMO be represented as it is
shown in Fig. 4.
LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AS A PROBLEM
IN MEASUREMENT
The preceding discussion is directed
to the DEMO that under certain condi-
tions the task of ascertaining an indi-
vidual's level of aspiration reduces to
the task of measuring his utility DEMO the
goals in question. That is, when an
achievement variable is DEMO, the
level of aspiration on the achievement
scale may be derived DEMO ascertaining
the individual's utility function for the
goals in question.
How strong must the measurement be?
Obviously the weaker sorts of measure-
DEMO and ordinal scaling—
will not be satisfactory, for such scaling
yields DEMO information about the dis-
tances between the entities on the scale.
Since the identification of level of as-
piration requires some knowledge of the
DEMO on the scale, utility must be
measured on a stronger scale DEMO an
ordinal one.
The strength of measurement which
is required depends on the nature of
the variate—on whether the possible
achievement goals are represented DEMO a
continuous variate or are a discrete set
of entities with an underlying con-
tinuum.
SIDNEY SIEGEL
If the possible goals are on a DEMO
tinuum and if the achievement scale is
represented by a continuous variate, i.e.,
if the scores (goals) may have any value
in a certain range, then at least inter-
val measurement of utility is necessary
to derive level of aspiration. In inter-
val measurement, the distances between
points (i.e., the intervals) are known
numerically (22, 26, 27), and thus the
numerically largest distance may be
identified and the level of aspiration
thereby located.
If the possible goals are discontinu-
DEMO and if the achievement scale consists
of a discrete set of entities, i.e., if the
scores (goals) can take only isolated
values, then at least ordered metric
measurement is necessary to derive level
of DEMO In strength, an ordered
metric scale falls between an ordinal
scale DEMO an interval scale. An ordered
metric scale (4, 5, 21) not only gives a
ranking of the entities involved but also
a DEMO of the distances between the
entities. With an ordered metric scale
we can identify the largest distance and,
inasmuch as the individual's DEMO is
limited to the discrete set of goals avail-
able, we DEMO find that goal which
best represents his level of aspiration of
those available.
The problem of obtaining an interval
measure of utility has been DEMO with
by Davidson, Siegel, and Suppes (7).
Their paper DEMO an axiomatization
of the interval measurement of utility
as well as a report of an experiment in
which interval scales of utility were suc-
DEMO derived for IS subjects.
A method for obtaining an ordered
metric measure of utility has been de-
veloped by Siegel (21). Examples of
applications of this method in tests of
various hypotheses are given in (15),
(23), and (24).
Most level-of-aspiration situations, DEMO
not all, involve a discrete set of goals.
Even if there DEMO continuity underlying

the achievement scale, as is the case
in achievement in throwing darts at a
board with a DEMO's-eye, the possible
goals are usually broken up into a dis-
DEMO set. In the case of the dart board,
these are concentric circles around the
bull's-eye. Thus it would seem that for
most DEMO measurement in an or-
dered metric scale is all that is neces-
sary to derive an individual's level of
aspiration.
To test the DEMO of the statement
that the level of aspiration is that goal
which is the least upper bound of the
largest distance on an ordered DEMO
scale of utility, a study was conducted
which is reported fully DEMO (1).
A summary report of it is included here
to DEMO greater clarity to some of the
topics discussed.
EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION
Becker and Siegel (1) have conducted
a study wherein they tested the hy-
DEMO that the ordered metric utility
function would yield information on the
individual's level of aspiration.
Subjects were 20 students enrolled in
an elementary DEMO in statistics. These
were students who volunteered to gam-
ble with the instructor for their mid-
term grade, with the understanding that
the grade they obtained in the gambling
session would be entered in the course
DEMO in lieu of their score on the
regularly scheduled midterm examina-
tion.3 An ordered metric scale of the
grades A, B, C, D, and F was derived
for each subject by the method described
elsewhere (1, 21). This method derives
the subject's scale from DEMO choices
among alternatives like those exampled
above.
3 After all data had been collected, the na-
ture of the experiment was explained to all
participants in individual interviews with
them, and all agreed to take the examination
and receive a grade based on their perform-
ance on it.
DEMO subjects were required to make
choices between alternatives in a num-
ber of offers. Each of the offers was
numbered, and the subjects understood
in advance that the offer on which the
pay-off (midterm grade) DEMO be based
would be selected at random from all of
the offers given. Therefore each deci-
sion they made had an equal likelihood
of DEMO the crucial one on which their
midterm grade depended (cf. 21, p. 214;
20, p. 29).
After the subjects had made all the
required choices, two ruses were in-
troduced. First, the DEMO random
device by which each student's grade
would be determined was actually con-
trolled so that each subject "won" a C
for DEMO grade. Some subjects responded
to this pay-off with considerable dismay
and disappointment. In response to this,
the experimenters perpetrated the second
ruse. The DEMO of subjects was told
that if they were dissatisfied with the
grade they had won, they could obtain
an interview with the instructor and the
other experimenter, in which perhaps
some way of raising their grade could
be worked out. The implication con-
tained in this announcement was DEMO
performance of extra work would be the
mode of raising the grade. The subjects
were told that any who desired such an
interview would DEMO to wait until the
instructor placed an urgent long-dis-
tance telephone call, after which he and
the other experimenter would return to
conduct individual interviews with those
students who desired them. The in-
structor said he DEMO return in about
five minutes, but actually his absence
was unexplainedly DEMO to an hour's
time before he returned for individual
interviews. As will become clear, this
ruse permitted a test of one of the hy-
potheses of the study.
The interviews were structured to ob-
tain DEMO careful independent measure of
each subject's level of aspiration for
260
SIDNEY SIEGEL
his midterm grade. Both experimenters
were present, and their independent
judgments of each subject's level of as-
piration were in DEMO close agreement
(ra = .99). The interviews were con-
ducted DEMO either experimenter had
any information concerning any sub-
ject's ordered metric scale of utility for
grades.
The experiment was designed to test
two DEMO For this summary it
may suffice to state these briefly and to
report the outcome of each hypothesis
test.
Hypothesis I was that those DEMO
who would not wait for an interview
with the instructor would be persons on
whose ordered metric scales the largest
distance was between D DEMO F—persons
whose ordered metric scales would re-
veal that their level of aspiration was
below the C which they had won. This
hypothesis was DEMO by the data.
Four subjects left the room before the
experimenters returned from their hour-
long errand. All had ordered metric
scales with the DEMO distance between
D and F. Seemingly they were satisfied
with the C grade they had been assured
and therefore saw no reason to seek DEMO
interview.
Hypothesis II was that subjects' lev-
els of aspiration, as determined from
their ordered metric scales of utility,
would be positively DEMO with their
levels of aspiration as judged from the
interview material. This hypothesis was
confirmed: the correlation between the
two independent indices of level of as-
piration was rs = .83.
GOALS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Child DEMO Whiting (3, p. 508) have
formulated five general statements which
DEMO the conclusions which may rea-
sonably be drawn from research on level
of aspiration to date:
1. Success generally leads to a raising DEMO the
level of aspiration, and failure to a lowering.
2. The DEMO the success, the greater is
the probability of a rise in DEMO of aspiration;
the stronger the failure, the greater is the DEMO
ability of a lowering.
3. Shifts in level of aspiration are in part a
function of changes in the subject's confidence
in his DEMO to attain goals.
4. Failure is more likely than success to lead
to withdrawal in the form of avoiding of set-
ting a level DEMO aspiration.
5. Effects of failure on level of aspiration
are more varied than those of success.
Each of these generalizations may be
treated as DEMO to be tested in ex-
perimentation employing the decision-
theory approach outlined here. If such
experimentation leads to confirmation of
the hypotheses, this would strengthen
confidence in the validity of that ap-
proach.
Simon (25, DEMO 110) points out that in
most models of rational choice it DEMO as-
sumed that the individual will evaluate
the outcomes of all possible alternatives
before he makes any choice. In realis-
tic human situations requiring DEMO,
however, alternatives often must be ex-
amined sequentially and decisions DEMO
be made as the alternatives are pre-
sented. When this is the case, and when
the individual does not know what vari-
ables determine the order of the offers
(and therefore does not know whether
the future alternatives are likely to be
"better" or "worse" than DEMO with
which he has already been confronted),
he may well DEMO the first satisfactory
alternative which is offered. In the
terms of the present paper, the indi-
vidual may choose the first alternative
containing an outcome at or above his
level of aspiration. The techniques sug-
gested DEMO this paper could be used to
provide an empirical test of this hy-
pothesis.
Simon offers another interesting hy-
pothesis which might be tested DEMO the
context of the present approach. As the
individual is being presented with a se-
quence of choice situations, he may find
LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DECISION MAKING
261
that it is easy for DEMO to discover satis-
factory alternatives among them. If so,
his level of aspiration will rise. On the
other hand, he may find it difficult to
discover satisfactory alternatives among
those made available to him, and in this
case his level of aspiration will fall.
Simon suggests that DEMO changes in
level of aspiration would tend to guaran-
tee the existence of satisfactory solu-
tions to the decision situation, for fail-
ure to discover initially satisfying al-
ternatives would depress the level of
aspiration and DEMO bring satisfac-
tory solutions into existence.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper suggests that Lewinian
theory concerning level of aspiration
may be integrated with certain DEMO of
decision theory. An achievement scale
may be viewed as a scale of utility of
the achievement goals. A formal defini-
tion of level DEMO aspiration in terms of
utility is offered. The problem of ascer-
taining a person's level of aspiration re-
duces to the problem of DEMO his
utility of the achievement goals. It is
hypothesized that level of aspiration is
associated with the largest distance on
an individual's utility DEMO If this is
so, with a discrete set of goals, ordered
metric measurement is sufficient for
identifying a person's level of aspiration,DEMO
since an ordered metric scale contains
not only a ranking of the entities
(achievement goals) but also a ranking
of the distances between DEMO Cer-
tain experimental evidence which sup-
ports the hypothesis is summarized.
Suggestions for future research are pre-
sented; these draw upon the ideas pre-
sented here, together with those of other
workers in the fields of level of aspira-
tion and decision theory.
In conclusion, it would seem that a
useful behavioral model of decision mak-
ing should include not DEMO the concepts
of utility and subjective probability, as
do the present DEMO, but should also
include a formulation of the effects of
level DEMO aspiration and reinforcement on
utility. That is, the model should in-
DEMO recognition that utility has a
model in its own right, in DEMO the
main concepts are level of aspiration
(LA) and reinforcement effects (R).
In terms of such an extended model,
it may be said that if various alterna-
tives are available to an individual, he
will choose from among these alterna-
tives, toward each of which he has a
subjective probability of attainment and
a utility, so as to maximize subjectively
expected utility, SEU. That is, the in-
dividual DEMO choose so as to maximize
SEU =
