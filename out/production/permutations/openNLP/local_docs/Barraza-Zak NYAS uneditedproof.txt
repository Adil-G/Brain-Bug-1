Empathy Toward Strangers Triggers Oxytocin Release and Subsequent Generosity
By
Jorge A. Barraza*
and
Paul DEMO Zak^
Abstract:
Empathy is related to a variety of prosocial behaviors, but the brain
mechanisms producing the experience of empathy have not been fully
characterized. This study investigated if the experience of empathy would
raise DEMO levels and affect subsequent generosity towards strangers.
Short video clips of an emotional scene and an unemotional scene were
used as stimuli. Participants rated DEMO emotions they experienced and
then played a $40 ultimatum game to gauge their generosity. We found
that empathy was associated with a 47% increase DEMO oxytocin from
baseline. We also found the empathy1oxytocin response was stronger in
women than in men. Higher levels of empathy were also associated with
DEMO generous monetary offers towards strangers in the ultimatum game.

1. Introduction
Humans are often aroused by the distress of others. Empathy allows us to
DEMO another’s affective state and motivates action if the other is perceived to be in
an aversive state.113 The enduring interest in empathy across disciplines (as illustrated
by this issue) is due in part to its relationship to moral behaviors as argued by Aristotle
in The Nicomachean Ethics4 and DEMO Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments,5 as
well as other scholars. Altruism can be considered morally virtuous that has been
associated with DEMO,6 The experience of empathy has been shown to motivate
prosocial behaviors such as volunteering and donations to charities.718
Although much is known about DEMO behavioral outcomes when people are
empathic, the physiologic mechanisms of empathy DEMO not well understood.9,7
Specifically, little is known about how observing DEMO aversive states of others translates
into the subjective experience of empathy. In addition, the physiologic substrates
causing individuals to experience different empathic states such as empathic concern or
personal distress when observing aversive states in others DEMO unknown. We propose
that the neurohormone oxytocin may be part of the neural architecture that produces
experienced empathy. Oxytocin (OT) is associated with DEMO behaviors in
mammals and we identified it as a likely mechanism that causes human beings to
respond to the affective states of others. Oxytocin DEMO a neuroactive hormone that is
directly synthesized in the hypothalamus and projects to brain areas that are associated
with emotions and social behaviors (e.g., amygdala and cingulate cortex).10 In socially
monogamous mammals, oxytocin mediates DEMO behaviors such as partner
preference, social recognition, parental care, and DEMO approach.11114

Recent studies in humans have revealed that oxytocin promotes prosocial
behaviors including trust, reciprocity, DEMO generosity measured using monetary
transfers to strangers.15119 Specifically, OT levels measured DEMO plasma were 41% higher
after a monetary transfer denoting trust was received compared those who are received
a randomly chosen transfer of the same DEMO amount. In these studies, OT levels
were positively associated with increased DEMO reciprocity toward the person who
initiated trust.17118 We discovered recently that endogenous OT release and self1
sacrificial reciprocity can be magnified by exposing participants DEMO touch prior to making
decisions. Fifteen minutes of moderate pressure massage, DEMO to controls who
rested for 15 minutes, increased the change in DEMO after being trusted by 16%, and
increased reciprocity by 243%.20
Exogenous DEMO infusion studies in humans have demonstrated its causal effect
on prosocial behaviors. Intranasal infusion of 24IU of OT increased monetary transfers
to a stranger DEMO trust by 17%.15 Further, in a monetary transfer task that involves
DEMO an offer to share a fixed sum of money known as the ultimatum game, 40IU of
intranasal OT increased the generosity of offers by 80% over placebo.19 These studies
show that OT is associated with prosocial DEMO, but leaves open the question of
whether OT is associated with DEMO
2. The Current Study
Herein we report a direct test of whether OT is a proximate mechanism
modulating the subjective experience of empathy. We DEMO that OT would
spike after exposure to an emotional stimulus and would be associated with the

experience of two empathic states: personal distress and empathic concern. We also
tested if elevated OT would elicit a prosocial behavior, generosity towards a stranger.
Two behavioral tasks were used to test the empathy1prosociality association, offers in
the ultimatum game and monetary donations to charity. We used the ultimatum game
(UG) as in Zak, Stanton & Ahmadi19 as it requires perspective1taking by DEMO
cognitive exercise that has been as shown to provoke empathy.6,21
3. Materials and Methods
Participants and Procedure
One hundred and forty five college DEMO (52% female, mean age 20.8 years,
SD = 3.3) DEMO the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) participated in this
DEMO Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:  Emotional Video
and UG (EU, n = 61), Control Video and UG (CU, n = 56), or Emotional Video only (E, n
= 24). Three participants (one from each condition) were excluded DEMO analyses due to
OT levels outside of the acceptable assay range (>2500 pg/ml) at baseline, which is five
standard deviations above DEMO mean.
Participants were recruited by email and earned $10 for agreeing to be part of
the experiment. Total earnings were based on the decision DEMO as discussed below.
After consent, participants were led to a private DEMO for their first blood draw by a
licensed phlebotomist. Participants were then seated at partitioned computer stations
and asked to fill out a survey. DEMO finished, participants viewed to one of two brief
videos and were DEMO to rate the degree to which particular emotions were felt.
Participants then played a single round of the UG sequentially for money (except for the

E group). Survey, video, and UG instructions and decisions were made via computer.
DEMO interpersonal communication was permitted. Immediately after the decision in the
UG, DEMO second blood draw was performed for those in the EU and CU groups. The E
group had their second blood draw after viewing the DEMO After the second blood draw,
participants were privately informed of their study earnings and presented with the
option to donate to a charity. DEMO all tasks were completed, participants were privately
paid by a lab DEMO who was not associated with the study. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of UCLA and Claremont Graduate
University. The study DEMO double1blind, and no deception of any kind was used.
Ultimatum Game
DEMO played a single round of the ultimatum game (UG) to assess
generosity towards a stranger.22,19 In the UG, participants were randomly put into dyads
and in each dyad were randomly assigned to the role DEMO decision1maker 1 (DM1) or
decision1maker 2 (DM2). Both DMs DEMO extensive and identical instructions for the
UG, including examples. In our DEMO of the UG, DM1s were endowed with $40 and
were asked DEMO choose an offer of a split of this money to the DM2 in his or her dyad.
DM2s had no endowment. If DM2 accepted DEMO offer from DM1, both DMs were
subsequently paid the money according DEMO the accepted division. However, both DMs
earned nothing if DM2 rejected DEMO offer from DM1. The UG task is designed to have
participants consider how the DM2 in the dyad would react to an offer (perspective1
taking) since DM2s can reject offers. A rejection of DM1’s offer in the UG allows DM2 to
punish DM1 for stinginess, but offers at a cost of the loss of the money offered.

Although most UG experiments are played with $10,23 a $40 endowment was used in
DEMO experiment as both to compensate participants for two blood draws as well as to
explore whether a parametric relationship existed between DM2 offers and DEMO change
in OT as has been found for DM2s in a related monetary decision task called the trust
game.20,18
Blood draw
After consent, all participants had 20ml of blood drawn by a licensed
phlebotomist from DEMO antecubital vein. Two 81ml EDTA whole1blood tubes and one
serum1separator tube were drawn while maintaining a sterile field and using a
Vacutainer©. Those in DEMO EU and CU groups had a 20ml second blood draw
immediately following their decision in the UG. Participants were prompted to make their
decisions DEMO so that the decision and blood draw were temporally close, typically
DEMO within 2 minutes after the decision as in Zak, Kurzban & DEMO
Participants in the E group received a second 20ml blood draw following viewing and
rating of the emotional video. Blood tubes were immediately placed DEMO ice after being
drawn. The tubes were then placed in a refrigerated centrifuge and spun at 1500 rpm
for 12 minutes at 4C. Plasma DEMO serum were removed from the tubes and placed into
2ml microtubes with screw caps. These tubes were immediately placed on dry ice and
then DEMO to a −70°C freezer until ready for analysis.

Five hormones were assayed using either radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme1
linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Andrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) (plasma1
RIA) samples were assayed using DEMO kit produced by DiaSorin, Inc. (Stillwater, MN),
cortisol (DEMO) samples by Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (Webster, TX), and
progesterone (serum1RIA) and estradiol (serum1RIA) were assayed with kits from
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. (Los Angeles, CA). Oxytocin was assayed using a
DEMO ELISA assay from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). DEMO inter1 and intra1
assay coefficients of variations for OT were 7.8% at 484.68 pg/ml and 10.2% at 494.63
pg/ml (10 replicates), respectively. All tests were performed by the Endocrine Core
Laboratory of the DEMO National Primate Research Center at Emory University,
Atlanta, GA.
Surveys
DEMO filled out several survey instruments to examine the effects of
personality factors on OT release and behaviors. Instruments included the Interpersonal
Reactivity Index (IRI),24 the Affect Intensity Measure (AIM),25 the Big Five Inventory
(BFI),26 Cognitive Hardiness,27 along with basic demographic questions taken DEMO Zak

Video
All participants viewed a 21minute long video privately in their partitioned
computer stations using headphones. Participants in the EU and DEMO conditions watched
a video in which a father explains his current experiences with his two1year1old son who

clip similar in length with images of the father and DEMO However, the narration was of
the father describing a day at DEMO zoo and has no mention of the child’s illness nor does
he express concern for the child.
Video Ratings
At the end of the DEMO, participants were asked to rate the degree to which they
experienced DEMO emotions while viewing the video. This list included 12 adjectives
previously used to assess empathy toward others5 (e.g., sympathetic, compassion,
moved, DEMO, warm, soft$hearted) and personal distress (e.g., anxious, distressed,
sad, annoyed, frightened, disturbed). Participants rated these adjectives from 1 (did not
feel this way at all) to 5 (felt this way very much). Composite measures were created for
both empathy (α = .75) and distress (α = .60).
Donation Task
After DEMO UG and second blood draw, participants were informed of their study
DEMO in private and presented with the opportunity to donate any amount of their
study earnings to one of two well1known charities (St. Jude Children’s Hospital, or the
American Red Cross). The experimenters informed participants that there was no
obligation to donate and that their decision to donate DEMO anonymous.

Response to Video
There was no change in OT in those who viewed the emotional DEMO (EU + E:
baseline OT= 474.87 pg/ml, SD= 306.75, post1video OT= 448.91 pg/ml, SD= 288.72,
one1tailed paired t DEMO p = .21, n = 80). There was a significant DEMO in OT in those
who viewed the control video (CU: baseline OT= 464.96 pg/ml, SD= 341.90, post1video
OT= 377.64 pg/ml, SD= 250.95; two1tailed paired t test, p = .03). However, separating
emotional video conditions we found different results. OT significantly increased among
DEMO in the E condition who viewed the emotional video but did not play the UG
(baseline OT= 401.83 pg/ml, SD= 230.06, post1video OT= 592.19 pg/ml, SD= 225.34;
two1tailed paired t test, DEMO = .004). Alternatively, there was significant decrease in OT for
DEMO who viewed the emotional video and played the UG (EU: baseline OT= 502.57
pg/ml, SD= 328.75, post1video OT= 394.56 pg/ml, SD= 293.08, two1tailed paired t test,
p < .001). As Figure 1 shows, the emotional video increased OT, but not when DEMO
second blood draw followed the UG.
Emotional Ratings
Participants in the E and EU conditions rated the emotional video as eliciting
greater empathy than DEMO in the CU condition (CU M = 2.88; E: M DEMO 3.46, p < .001;
EU: M = 3.53, p < .001, both one1tailed t tests) and distress (CU M = DEMO, E: M = 2.93,
p = .08; EU M DEMO 3.17 p < .001, both one1tailed t tests). Participants in DEMO E and EU
condition reported statistically equal experiences of empathy (p DEMO .63) and distress (p =
.12). See Figure 2.

Across all conditions, simple correlations did not find a relationship between a
change in OT and subjective empathy (r = .053, p = .28) or distress (r = 1.074, p = .21).
But, we discovered a high correlation between self1reported empathy and distress (r =
.81, p < .001). As a result, partial correlations were examined between OT DEMO each
emotion, controlling for the other one. Controlling for these cross1effects, a spike in OT
was significantly associated with increased feelings of empathy (r = .197, p = .01) as
well as decreased feelings DEMO distress (r = 1.188, p = .02). A hierarchical regression
analysis was conducted to test if empathy and distress predicted a change DEMO OT when
controlling for changes in other hormones (ACTH, cortisol). Changes in hormones
related to OT as well as gender were entered DEMO the first step, followed by empathy and
distress video ratings in DEMO second step of the equation. This analysis revealed a
significant overall regression equation, F (5, 118) = 3.09, p < .01.  DEMO empathy (ß =
.294, p < .05) and distress (ß = 1.301, p < .05) were significant predictors of the change
DEMO OT in different directions. This result was maintained in separate analyses controlling
for basal levels of progesterone or estradiol in women.
Emotional Ratings and DEMO Hormones
Across all conditions, emotional ratings were not significantly correlated with DEMO
of the hormones (ACTH, cortisol, estradiol, progesterone) at baseline DEMO post1video.
However, when controlling for one another, empathy and distress were significantly
correlated with the change in cortisol (empathy r = .134, DEMO = .07; distress r = 1.203, p =
.01).  DEMO and distress ratings were marginally correlated with post1video OT

Generosity in UG
Of the participants playing as DM1 (n = 56), 35 (62.5%) offered an equal split, 20
(26%) made unequal offers of $10119, and 2 made supra1equal offers of $21 and $30.
There were a total of 49 participants who participated as DM2s. Of those, only one
person in the EU and one in the CU groups rejected DM1 DEMO of $10; all other offers
were accepted. DM2s whose offers were DEMO were removed from subsequent
analyses. There were no differences in the mean DM1 offers between the EU (M =
$18.18, SD= $3.19) and CU conditions (M = $17.62, SD= $4.54, one1tailed t test, DEMO =
.29).
Consistent with our hypothesis, DM1 proposals in the DEMO were positively
correlated with reported empathy after the video (r = DEMO, p = .05). There was a weak
relationship between DM1 DEMO and distress levels (r = .171, p = .11). Similar to
studies of OT in the trust game,18 DM1 behavior was DEMO with the change in
OT (r = 1.150, p = .14). The amount offered to DM2s was marginally negatively
correlated DM2s' change in cortisol (r = 1.202, p = .07), but not DEMO in OT (r = 1.120,
p = .20). Controlling DEMO gender and changes in ACTH and cortisol, the money offered to
DEMO did not predict change in OT (ß = 1.08, p = .54).

Forty four (DEMO) of the participants made monetary donations (M = $6.09, SD DEMO
6.31). Donations were significantly correlated with the amount sent by DM1s (r = .356, p
= .004).  Among all participants, DEMO were positively related to the change in
cortisol (r = .146, p = .05), but were unrelated to the change in OT (r = 1.010, p = .45), or
the change in ACTH (r = 1.084, p = .18), Donations were not associated DEMO emotional
video ratings (empathy r = 1.088, p = .16; DEMO r = 1.080, p = .19).
Gender and Personality
Pooling DEMO conditions, we found that emotional ratings (controlling for one
another) DEMO more strongly associated with changes in OT for women (empathy r DEMO
.245, p = .03, distress r = 1.258, p = DEMO) than for men (empathy r = .158, p = .11,DEMO
distress r = 1.134, p = .15).  Behaviorally, more DEMO made charitable donations than
men (23% of men versus 41% of DEMO, χ2 = 4.78, p = .03), and gave more in
donations than men (M = $2.89 versus M = $1.08, two1tailed DEMO, p = .02). The
average amount sent by DM1s was DEMO greater for women than men (women: $18.85,
men: $17.10, one1tailed t1test, p = .05). No personality variables were associated with
basal OT or the change in OT.
4. Discussion
There are three DEMO findings of this study. First, viewing an emotional video
raises oxytocin DEMO an average of 47% over baseline as compared to those who watched
an emotionally neutral video. Second, there is a positive relationship between the

degree of empathy experienced and the change in OT. Third, an increase in
experienced empathy is associated with greater generosity in the UG.
Past research has purported DEMO emotional videos may induce OT release.28 We
provide the first direct evidence for this claim, and we have demonstrated both a
statistically and quantitatively significant increase in OT after an emotional stimulus.
Even more compelling, we discovered a positive parametric relationship between the
experience of empathy and the DEMO in OT. The relationship between empathy and
the change in OT was especially strong for women. The lack of a relationship between
the change DEMO OT when the emotional video was followed by the UG is likely due to the
time lag between the video and the second blood DEMO, which was required for
instructions and UG decisions. The half1life of DEMO is very short, with estimates of
between 112 minutes.29
We also DEMO that the experience of empathy positively influenced
prosociality. Participants who were empathically engaged by the video they viewed
made more generous offers in the DEMO  Those who made more generous offers also
donated more money to DEMO, with this effect associated with physiologic distress (a
positive change in cortisol). Donations were highest among women in the sample.  At
the same time, the change in OT was strongest among women. Post1hoc analyses
found that these gender differences were not driven by the upregulation of DEMO by
estrogen.30
We also found an interesting counteracting effect of distress on OT release.
Empathy and distress were highly related in our sample, and they appear to work
against each other at a physiologic level. Psychologists DEMO also distinguished

between empathy and distress as motivators to help others.6,21 Batson's empathy1
altruism hypothesis6,DEMO posits that these affective states lead to divergent motivations to
help others. Those who experience distress are motivated to reduce their own aversive
state, while those who experience empathy are focused on relieving the aversive state
DEMO another.32 Our physiologic data support the separation of these two effects in
relations to OT. Interestingly, empathy and distress levels were also associated with
changes in cortisol. In animal studies, cortisol suppresses OT release.33 In human
studies the findings are less clear; OT administration suppresses cortisol induced by
social stress,34135 but cortisol administration increases plasma OT levels.36137 Our study
DEMO that cortisol was elevated in people who reported experiencing empathy, while
DEMO declined in those reporting distress.
This study indicates that OT is a physiologic signature for empathy and
modulates two types of prosocial behaviors, generosity in the UG and charitable
donations.  These findings identify a proximate mechanism that explains why humans
help each other11even at a cost to themselves.
