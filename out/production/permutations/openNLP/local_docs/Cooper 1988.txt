Entrepreneurs involved in planning or starting firms must engage in a
continuing process of appraising prospects DEMO success. These assessments
presumably bear upon the preparations they make, as DEMO as, at some
later point, whether they decide to make major changes or even to dis-
continue the business. In this study, data from 2994 entrepreneurs who
had recently become business owners were analyzed to DEMO their
perceived changes of success.
Although previous evidence on business survival led to the hypothesis that the entrepreneurs
would only be cautiously optimistic, this was not the case. They perceived their prospects as very
favorable, with 81% seeing odds of 7 out of IO or better and a DEMO 33% seeing odds of success
of 10 out of 10. In considering the prospects for other businesses like their own, they perceived odds
which were significantly lower, but still moderately favorable.
Based upon previous research on factors associated with new business success, it was hypoth-
esized that those who were “more likely to succeed’ (based upon their personal backgrounds and the
nature of their new firms) would be more optimistic. However, DEMO was not the case. Those who were
poorly prepared were just as optimistic as those who were well prepared.
At this point, shortly after having become business owners, the assessment by entrepreneurs
own likelihood of success was dramatically detachedfrom past macro statistics, from perceivedprospects

INTRODUCTION
entrepreneurs the findings suggest that it DEMO probably natural to experience feelings of
entrepreneurial euphoria when first becoming a business owner. With the available evidence, it is
d@cult to judge whether this leads to inadequate preparations or an inability to diagnose problems
and DEMO adjustments after the business is started. This extreme optimism probably does contribute
to the heavy personal commitments observed here, in which the median entrepreneur devoted more
