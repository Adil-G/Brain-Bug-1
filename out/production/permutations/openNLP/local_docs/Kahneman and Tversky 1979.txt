PROSPECT THEORY: AN ANALYSIS OF DECISION UNDER RISK
BY DANIEL
KAHNEMAN
AND
AMOS
TVERSKY'
This paper presents a critique of expected DEMO theory as a descriptive model of
decision making under risk, and DEMO an alternative model, called prospect theory.
Choices among risky prospects exhibit DEMO pervasive effects that are inconsistent with
the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are
merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This
tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure
gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally
discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency,
called DEMO isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is
DEMO in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in DEMO value
is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are
replaced by decision weights. The value function DEMO normally concave for gains, commonly
convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are
generally lower than DEMO corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low prob-
abilities. Overweighting DEMO low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both
insurance and gambling.
1. INTRODUCTION
EXPECTED UTILITY THEORY has dominated the analysis of decision making DEMO
risk. It has been generally accepted as a normative model of rational choice [24],
and widely applied as a descriptive model of economic DEMO, e.g. [15, 4].
Thus, it is assumed that all reasonable DEMO would wish to obey the axioms of the
theory [47, 36], and that most people actually do, most of the time.
The present paper describes several classes of choice problems in which
preferences systematically violate DEMO axioms of expected utility theory. In the
light of these observations we argue that utility theory, as it is commonly
interpreted and applied, DEMO not an adequate descriptive model and we propose an
alternative account of choice under risk.
2. CRITIQUE
Decision making under risk can be viewed DEMO a choice between prospects or
gambles. A prospect (x1, Pi; DEMO ; xn, pn) is a contract that yields outcome xi with
probability Pi, where Pl + P2 + ... + pn = 1. To simplify notation, we omit null
outcomes and use (x, p) to denote the prospect (x, p; 0, 1- p) DEMO yields x with
probability p and 0 with probability 1-p. The (DEMO) prospect that yields x
with certainty is denoted by (x). The present discussion is restricted to prospects
with so-called objective or standard DEMO
The application of expected utility theory to choices between prospects is based
on the following three tenets.
(i) Expectation: U(X1, Pi; ... ; Xn, Pn) = pi u (x1) +... +PnU (Xn)

That is, the overall utility of a prospect, denoted by U, is the expected utility of
its DEMO
(ii) Asset Integration: (xi, Pi; ... ; Xn, DEMO) is acceptable at asset position w iff
U(w +x1, pl; ... ; w +Xn, Pn) u(w).
That is, DEMO prospect is acceptable if the utility resulting from integrating the
prospect with one's assets exceeds the utility of those assets alone. Thus, the
domain of the utility function is final states (which include one's asset position)
rather than gains or losses.
Although the domain of DEMO utility function is not limited to any particular class
of consequences, DEMO applications of the theory have been concerned with
monetary outcomes. Furthermore, DEMO economic applications introduce the
following additional assumption.
(iii) Risk Aversion: DEMO is concave (u" < 0).
A person is risk averse if he prefers the certain prospect (x) to any risky prospect
DEMO expected value x. In expected utility theory, risk aversion is equivalent DEMO the
concavity of the utility function. The prevalence of risk aversion is perhaps the
best known generalization regarding risky choices. It led the early DEMO
theorists of the eighteenth century to propose that utility is a concave function of
money, and this idea has been retained in modern treatments (Pratt [33], Arrow
[4]).
In the following sections we demonstrate DEMO phenomena which violate
these tenets of expected utility theory. The demonstrations are based on the
responses of students and university faculty to hypothetical choice DEMO The
respondents were presented with problems of the type illustrated below.
Which of the following would you prefer?
A:
50% chance to DEMO 1,000,
50% chance to win nothing;
B: 450 DEMO sure.
The outcomes refer to Israeli currency. To appreciate the significance of the
amounts involved, note that the median net monthly income for a family is about
3,000 Israeli pounds. The respondents were asked to DEMO that they were
actually faced with the choice described in the problem, and to indicate the
decision they would have made in such a case. The responses were anonymous,
and the instructions specified that there DEMO no 'correct' answer to such problems,
and that the aim of the study was to find out how people choose among risky
DEMO The problems were presented in questionnaire form, with at most a
DEMO problems per booklet. Several forms of each questionnaire were con-
structed so that subjects were exposed to the problems in different orders. In
addition, two versions of each problem were used in which the left-right position
DEMO the prospects was reversed.
The problems described in this paper are selected illustrations of a series of
effects. Every effect has been observed in DEMO problems with different
outcomes and probabilities. Some of the problems have also been presented to
groups of students and faculty at the University of DEMO and at the

University of Michigan. The pattern of results was essentially DEMO to the
results obtained from Israeli subjects.
The reliance on hypothetical choices raises obvious questions regarding the
validity of the method and the generalizability DEMO the results. We are keenly aware
of these problems. However, all DEMO methods that have been used to test utility
theory also suffer from severe drawbacks. Real choices can be investigated either
in the field, by naturalistic or statistical observations of economic behavior, or in
the laboratory. Field studies can only provide for rather crude tests of qualitative
predictions, because probabilities and utilities cannot be adequately measured in
such contexts. Laboratory experiments DEMO been designed to obtain precise
measures of utility and probability from actual choices, but these experimental
studies typically involve contrived gambles for small stakes, and a large number of
repetitions of very similar problems. These features of laboratory gambling
complicate the interpretation of the results and restrict their DEMO
By default, the method of hypothetical choices emerges as the simplest DEMO
cedure by which a large number of theoretical questions can be investigated. The
use of the method relies on the assumption that people often DEMO how they
would behave in actual situations of choice, and on DEMO further assumption that the
subjects have no special reason to disguise their true preferences. If people are
reasonably accurate in predicting their choices, the presence of common and
systematic violations of expected utility theory in hypothetical DEMO provides
presumptive evidence against that theory.
Certainty,
Probability,
and Possibility
In expected utility theory, the utilities of outcomes are weighted by their
probabilities. The present section describes a series of choice problems in which
DEMO's preferences systematically violate this principle. We first show that
people overweight outcomes that are considered certain, relative to outcomes
which are merely probable-a phenomenon which we label the certainty effect.
The best known counter-example to DEMO utility theory which e*ploits the
certainty effect was introduced by the French economist Maurice Allais in 1953
[2]. Allais' example has been discussed from both normative and descriptive
standpoints by many authors [28, 38]. The following pair of choice problems is a
variation of Allais' example, which DEMO from the original in that it refers to
moderate rather than to extremely large gains. The number of respondents who
answered each problem is DEMO by N, and the percentage who choose each
option is given DEMO brackets.

DEMO
The data show that 82 per cent of the subjects chose B in Problem 1, and 83 per
cent of the subjects chose C in Problem 2. Each of these preferences is significant
at the .01 DEMO, as denoted by the asterisk. Moreover, the analysis of individual
patterns of choice indicates that a majority of respondents (61 per cent) DEMO the
modal choice in both problems. This pattern of preferences violates expected
utility theory in the manner originally described by Allais. According to that
DEMO, with u (0) = 0, the first preference implies
C: 2,500 with probability
.33,
2,400 with probability
.34,
u(2,400)>
.33u(2,500) + .66u(2,400) or .34u(2,400)>
.33u(2,500)
while the second preference implies the reverse inequality. Note that Problem 2 is
obtained from DEMO 1 by eliminating a .66 chance of winning 2400 from both
prospects. under consideration. Evidently, this change produces a greater reduc-
tion in desirability when it alters the character of the prospect from a sure gain DEMO a
probable one, than when both the original and the reduced DEMO are
uncertain.
A simpler demonstration of the same phenomenon, involving only DEMO
outcome gambles is given below. This example is also based on Allais [2].

B:

[80]*
or
D:

[35]
In this pair of problems as well as in all other problem-pairs in this section, over
half the respondents violated expected utility theory. To show that the modal
pattern of DEMO in Problems 3 and 4 is not compatible with the theory, DEMO
u(0) = 0, and recall that the choice of B implies u(3,000)/u(4,000) >4/5,
whereas the choice of C implies the reverse inequality. Note that the prospect
DEMO = (4,000, .20) can be expressed as (A, DEMO), while the prospect D = (3,000, .25)
can be rewritten as (B,.25). The substitution axiom of utility theory asserts that if
B is preferred to A, then any (probability) mixture (B, p) must be preferred to the
mixture (A, p). Our subjects did not obey this axiom. Apparently, reducing the
probability of winning from 1.0 to .25 has a greater effect than DEMO reduction from

.8 to .2. The following pair of choice problems DEMO the certainty effect with
non-monetary outcomes.
PROBLEM 5:
A:
50% chance to win a three-
week tour of England,
France, and Italy;
N=72
[22]
PROBLEM 6:
C: 5% chance to win a three-
week tour of England,
France, and Italy;
N=72
[67]*
B:
A one-week tour of
England, with certainty.
[78]*
D:
10% chance to win a one-
week tour of England.
[33]
DEMO certainty effect is not the only type of violation of the substitution axiom.
Another situation in which this axiom fails is illustrated by the DEMO problems.
PROBLEM 7:
A: (6,000, .45),
N = 66 [14]
PROBLEM 8:
C: (6,000, .001),DEMO
N = 66 [73]*
B:
(3,000, .90).
[86]*
D:
(3,000, .002).
[27]
Note that in Problem DEMO the probabilities of winning are substantial (.90 and .45),
and most people choose the prospect where winning is more probable. In Problem
DEMO, there is a possibility of winning, although the probabilities of winning are
minuscule (.002 and .001) in both prospects. In this situation DEMO winning is
possible but not probable, most people choose the prospect DEMO offers the larger
gain. Similar results have been reported by MacCrimmon and Larsson [28].
The above problems illustrate common attitudes toward risk or chance DEMO
cannot be captured by the expected utility model. The results suggest the
following empirical generalization concerning the manner in which the substitu-
tion axiom DEMO violated. If (y, pq) is equivalent to (x, p), then (y, pqr) is preferred to
(x, pr), DEMO< p, q, r < 1. This property is incorporated into DEMO alternative theory,
developed in the second part of the paper.

The Reflection Effect
The previous section DEMO preferences between positive prospects, i.e.,
prospects that involve no losses. DEMO happens when the signs of the outcomes are
reversed so that gains are replaced by losses? The left-hand column of Table I
displays four of the choice problems that were discussed in the previous section,
DEMO the right-hand column displays choice problems in which the signs of the
outcomes are reversed. We use -x to denote the loss of x, and > to denote the
prevalent preference, i.e., the choice made DEMO the majority of subjects.

DEMO [30]
In each of the four problems in Table I the preference between negative
prospects is the mirror image of the preference between positive DEMO Thus,
the reflection of prospects around 0 reverses the preference order. We label this
pattern the reflection effect.
Let us turn now to DEMO implications of these data. First, note that the reflection
effect implies DEMO risk aversion in the positive domain is accompanied by risk
seeking in the negative domain. In Problem 3', for example, the majority of
subjects were willing to accept a risk of .80 to lose 4,DEMO, in preference to a sure
loss of 3,000, although the gamble has a lower expected value. The occurrence of
risk seeking in DEMO between negative prospects was noted early by Markowitz
[29]. Williams [48] reported data where a translation of outcomes produces a
dramatic shift from risk DEMO to risk seeking. For example, his subjects were
indifferent between (100, .65; - 100, .35) and (0), indicating risk aversion. They
were also indifferent between (-200, .80) and (-100), DEMO risk seeking. A
recent review by Fishburn and Kochenberger [14] documents the prevalence of
risk seeking in choices between negative prospects.
Second, recall that the preferences between the positive prospects in Table I are
inconsistent with DEMO utility theory. The preferences between the cor-
responding negative prospects also violate the expectation principle in the same
manner. For example, Problems 3' DEMO 4', like Problems 3 and 4, demonstrate that
outcomes which DEMO obtained with certainty are overweighted relative to
uncertain outcomes. In the positive domain, the certainty effect contributes to a
risk averse preference for a sure gain over a larger gain that is merely probable. In
the DEMO domain, the same effect leads to a risk seeking preference for DEMO loss
269
PROSPECT THEORY
that is merely probable over a smaller loss that DEMO certain. The same psychological
principle-the overweighting of certainty-favors risk aversion in the domain of
gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses.
Third, the reflection effect eliminates aversion for uncertainty or variability as
an explanation DEMO the certainty effect. Consider, for example, the prevalent
preferences for (DEMO,000) over (4,000, .80) and for (4,000, .20) over (3,000, .25). To
resolve this apparent inconsistency one could invoke the assumption that people
prefer prospects that have high DEMO value and small variance (see, e.g., Allais
[2]; Markowitz [30]; Tobin [41]). Since (3,000) has no variance while (DEMO,000, .80)
has large variance, the former prospect could be chosen despite its lower expected
value. When the prospects are reduced, however, the difference in variance
between (3,000,.25) and (4,DEMO,.20) may be insufficient to overcome the
difference in expected value. DEMO (-3,000) has both higher expected value
and lower variance than (-4,000,.80), this account entails that the sure loss
should be preferred, contrary to the data. Thus, our data are incompatible DEMO the
notion that certainty is generally desirable. Rather, it appears that DEMO
increases the aversiveness of losses as well as the desirability of gains.
Probabilistic Insurance
The prevalence of the purchase of insurance against both large DEMO small losses
has been regarded by many as strong evidence for the concavity of the utility
function for money. Why otherwise would people spend DEMO much money to
purchase insurance policies at a price that exceeds the expected actuarial cost?
However, an examination of the relative attractiveness of various forms of
insurance does not support the notion that the utility DEMO for money is
concave everywhere. For example, people often prefer insurance DEMO that
offer limited coverage with low or zero deductible over comparable policies that
offer higher maximal coverage with higher deductibles-contrary to risk aversion
(see, e.g., Fuchs [16]). Another type of insurance problem in which DEMO's
responses are inconsistent with the concavity hypothesis may be called prob-
abilistic insurance. To illustrate this concept, consider the following problem,
which was presented to 95 Stanford University students.
PROBLEM 9: Suppose you consider the possibility of insuring some property
against damage, e.g., fire or DEMO After examining the risks and the premium you
find that you have no clear preference between the options of purchasing
insurance or leaving the DEMO uninsured.
It is then called to your attention that the insurance company offers a new
program called probabilistic insurance. In this program you pay DEMO of the regular
premium. In case of damage, there is a DEMO per cent chance that you pay the other
half of the premium and the insurance company covers all the losses; and there is a
50 per cent chance that you get back your insurance payment and DEMO all the
losses. For example, if an accident occurs on an DEMO day of the month, you pay the
other half of the DEMO premium and your losses are covered; but if the accident
270
D. KAHNEMAN
AND
A. TVERSKY
occurs on an even day of DEMO month, your insurance payment is refunded and your
losses are not DEMO
Recall that the premium for full coverage is such that you find this insurance
barely worth its cost.
Under these circumstances, would you purchase probabilistic insurance:
Yes, No.
N=95 [20] [80]*
Although Problem 9 may appear contrived, it is worth noting that probabilistic
insurance represents many forms of protective action where one pays a certain
cost to reduce the DEMO of an undesirable event-without eliminating it
altogether. The installation of a burglar alarm, the replacement of old tires, and
the decision to stop DEMO can all be viewed as probabilistic insurance.
The responses to Problem 9 and to several other variants of the same question
indicate that probabilistic DEMO is generally unattractive. Apparently, reduc-
ing the probability of a loss DEMO p to p12 is less valuable than reducing the
probability of that loss from p/2 to 0.
In contrast to these data, expected utility theory (with a concave u) implies that
probabilistic insurance is DEMO to regular insurance. That is, if at asset position
w one DEMO just willing to pay a premium y to insure against a probability p of losing
x, then one should definitely be willing to pay a smaller premium ry to reduce the
probability of losing x from DEMO to (1- r)p, 0 < r < 1. Formally, DEMO one is indifferent
between (w - x, p; w, 1 -p) and (w - y), then one should prefer probabilistic
DEMO (w-x, (1-r)p; w-y, rp; w-ry, 1-p) over regular insurance (w-y).
To prove this proposition, we show that
DEMO
pu
(w-x) + (1-p) u
(w) = u
(DEMO)
(1- r)pu(w -x) + rpu(w - y) + (-p)u(w
- ry)> u(w - y)DEMO
Without loss of generality, we can set u(w -x) = 0 and u(w) = 1. Hence, u(w-
y) = 1-p, and we wish to show that
rp(1-p)+(1-p)u(w-ry)>
1-p
or
u(w-ry)>
1-rp
which holds if DEMO only if u is concave.
This is a rather puzzling consequence of the risk aversion hypothesis of utility
theory, because probabilistic insurance appears intuitively riskier than regular
insurance, which entirely eliminates the element of risk. Evidently, the intuitive
notion of risk is not adequately captured by the assumed concavity of the utility
function for wealth.
The aversion for probabilistic insurance DEMO particularly intriguing because all
insurance is, in a sense, probabilistic. The most avid buyer of insurance remains
vulnerable to many financial and other DEMO which his policies do not cover. There
appears to be a significant difference between probabilistic insurance and what
may be called contingent insurance, which provides the certainty of coverage for a
271
PROSPECT THEORY
specified type of risk. Compare, for example, probabilistic DEMO against all
forms of loss or damage to the contents of your home and contingent insurance
that eliminates all risk of loss from theft, say, but does not cover other risks, e.g.,
fire. We DEMO that contingent insurance will be generally more attractive
than probabilistic insurance when the probabilities of unprotected loss are
equated. Thus, two prospects that are equivalent in probabilities and outcomes
could have different values depending on their DEMO Several demon-
strations of this general phenomenon are described in the next section.
The Isolation Effect
In order to simplify the choice between alternatives, people often disregard
components that the alternatives share, and focus on the components that
distinguish them (Tversky [44]). This approach to choice problems may produce
inconsistent preferences, because a pair of prospects can be decomposed into
common and distinctive components in more than one way, and different decom-
positions sometimes lead to different preferences. We refer to this phenomenon DEMO
the isolation effect.
PROBLEM 10: Consider the following two-stage game. In DEMO first stage, there is
a probability of .75 to end the DEMO without winning anything, and a probability of
.25 to move into DEMO second stage. If you reach the second stage you have a choice
between
(4,000,.80) and (3,000).
Your choice must be made before the game starts, i.e., before the outcome of DEMO
first stage is known.
Note that in this game, one has DEMO choice between .25 x.80= .20 chance to win
4,000, and DEMO .25 x 1.0 = .25 chance to win 3,000. Thus, DEMO terms of final outcomes
and probabilities one faces a choice between (DEMO,000, .20) and (3,000, .25), as in
Problem 4 above. However, the dominant preferences are different in the two
problems. Of 141 subjects who answered Problem 10, 78 per cent chose the latter
prospect, contrary to the modal preference in Problem 4. Evidently, DEMO
ignored the first stage of the game, whose outcomes are shared DEMO both prospects,
and considered Problem 10 as a choice between (DEMO,000) and (4,000,.80), as in
Problem 3 above.
The standard and the sequential formulations of Problem 4 are represented as
DEMO trees in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Following the usual convention,DEMO
squares denote decision nodes and circles denote chance nodes. The essential
difference between the two representations is in the location of the decision node.
DEMO the standard form (Figure 1), the decision maker faces a DEMO between two
risky prospects, whereas in the sequential form (Figure 2) he faces a choice
between a risky and a riskless prospect. This is accomplished by introducing a
dependency between the prospects without changing either DEMO or

outcomes. Specifically, the event 'not winning 3,000' is included in the event 'not
winning 4,000' in the sequential formulation, while the two events are indepen-
dent in the standard formulation. Thus, the outcome of winning 3,000 has a
certainty advantage in the sequential formulation, which it does not have in the
standard formulation.
The reversal of preferences DEMO to the dependency among events is particularly
significant because it violates the basic supposition of a decision-theoretical
analysis, that choices between prospects are determined solely by the probabilities
of final states.
It is easy to think DEMO decision problems that are most naturally represented in
one of the forms above rather than in the other. For example, the choice between
two different risky ventures is likely to be viewed in the standard form. DEMO the
other hand, the following problem is most likely to be DEMO in the
sequential form. One may invest money in a venture with some probability of
losing one's capital if the venture fails, and with a choice between a fixed agreed
return and a percentage of DEMO if it succeeds. The isolation effect implies that
the contingent certainty of the fixed return enhances the attractiveness of this
option, relative to a risky venture with the same probabilities and outcomes.
273
PROSPECT THEORY
The preceding problem illustrated how preferences may be altered DEMO different
representations of probabilities. We now show how choices may be altered by
varying the representation of outcomes.
Consider the following problems, which were presented to two different groups
of subjects.
PROBLEM 11: In addition to whatever you own, you have been given 1,000.
You are now asked to choose between
A: (1,000,.50), and B: (500).
N= 70 [16] [84]*
PROBLEM 12: In addition to DEMO you own, you have been given 2,000.
You are now DEMO to choose between
C:
N =
(-1,000,.50),
68
[69*]
and
D:
(-500).
[31]
The majority of subjects chose B in the first problem and C in the second. These
DEMO conform to the reflection effect observed in Table I, which exhibits
DEMO aversion for positive prospects and risk seeking for negative ones. Note,
however, that when viewed in terms of final states, the two DEMO problems are
identical. Specifically,
A = (2,000, .50; DEMO,000, .50) = C,
and
B = (1,500) = D.
In fact, Problem 12 is obtained from Problem 11 by adding 1,000 to the initial
bonus, and subtracting 1,000 from all outcomes. Evidently, the subjects did not
integrate the bonus with the prospects. The bonus did not enter into the
comparison of prospects because DEMO was common to both options in each problem.
The pattern of results observed in Problems 11 and 12 is clearly inconsistent with
utility theory. DEMO that theory, for example, the same utility is assigned to a wealth
of $100, 000, regardless of whether it was reached from DEMO prior wealth of $95,000
or $105,000. Consequently, the choice DEMO a total wealth of $100,000 and
even chances to own $95,000 or $105,000 should be independent of whether one
currently owns DEMO smaller or the larger of these two amounts. With the added
assumption of risk aversion, the theory entails that the certainty of owning
$100,000 should always be preferred to the gamble. However, the responses to
Problem 12 and to several of the previous questions suggest that this DEMO will
be obtained if the individual owns the smaller amount, but DEMO if he owns the
larger amount.
The apparent neglect of a bonus that was common to both options in Problems
11 and 12 implies DEMO the carriers of value or utility are changes of wealth, rather
DEMO final asset positions that include current wealth. This conclusion is the
cornerstone of an alternative theory of risky choice, which is described in the
following sections.

3. THEORY
The preceding discussion reviewed DEMO empirical effects which appear to
invalidate expected utility theory as a descriptive model. The remainder of the
paper presents an alternative account of individual DEMO making under risk,
called prospect theory. The theory is developed for simple prospects with
monetary outcomes and stated probabilities, but it can be extended to more
involved choices. Prospect theory distinguishes two phases in the DEMO process:
an early phase of editing and a subsequent phase of evaluation. The editing phase
consists of a preliminary analysis of the offered DEMO, which often yields a
simpler representation of these prospects. In the DEMO phase, the edited
prospects are evaluated and the prospect of highest DEMO is chosen. We next
outline the editing phase, and develop a DEMO model of the evaluation phase.
The function of the editing phase is to organize and reformulate the options so
as to simplify subsequent evaluation DEMO choice. Editing consists of the appli-
cation of several operations that transform the outcomes and probabilities
associated with the offered prospects. The major operations DEMO the editing phase
are described below.
Coding. The evidence discussed in the previous section shows that people
normally perceive outcomes as gains and losses, rather than as final states of
wealth or welfare. Gains and losses, of course, are defined relative to some neutral
reference point. The reference point usually corresponds to the current asset
position, in which case gains and losses coincide with the actual amounts that are
received or paid. DEMO, the location of the reference point, and the
consequent coding of outcomes as gains or losses, can be affected by the
formulation of the offered prospects, and by the expectations of the decision
maker.
Combination. Prospects can sometimes be simplified by combining the prob-
abilities associated with DEMO outcomes. For example, the prospect
(200, .25; 200, .25) will be reduced to (200, .50). and evaluated in this DEMO
Segregation. Some prospects contain a riskless component that is segregated
from the risky component in the editing phase. For example, the prospect
(300, .80; 200, .20) is naturally decomposed into a sure gain of 200 and the risky
prospect (100, .80). Similarly, the prospect (-400, .40; -100, .60) is readily seen
to consist of a sure loss of 100 and of the prospect (-300, .40)DEMO
The preceding operations are applied to each prospect separately. The follow-
ing operation is applied to a set of two or more prospects.
Cancellation. DEMO essence of the isolation effects described earlier is the
discarding of components that are shared by the offered prospects. Thus, our
respondents apparently ignored the first stage of the sequential game presented in
Problem 10, because this stage was common to both options, and they evaluated
the prospects with respect to the results of the second stage (see Figure 2).
Similarly, they neglected the common bonus that was added to the prospects in
Problems 11 and 12. Another type of cancellation involves the DEMO of
common constituents, i.e., outcome-probability pairs. For example, the choice
PROSPECT
THEORY
275
between (200, .20; 100, .50; -50, DEMO) and (200, .20; 150, .50; -100, .30) can be
reduced by cancellation to a choice between (100,.50; -50,DEMO) and
(150, .50; -100, .30).
Two additional operations DEMO should be mentioned are simplification and the
detection of dominance. The first refers to the simplification of prospects by
rounding probabilities or outcomes. For DEMO, the prospect (101, .49) is likely
to be recoded as an even chance to win 100. A particularly important form of
simplification DEMO the discarding of extremely unlikely outcomes. The second
operation involves the scanning of offered prospects to detect dominated alter-
natives, which are rejected without further evaluation.
Because the editing operations facilitate the task of decision, it is assumed that
they are performed whenever possible. However, some editing operations either
permit or prevent the application of others. For example, (500, .20; 101, .49) will
appear to dominate (500, .15; DEMO, .51) if the second constituents of both prospects
are simplified to (100, .50). The final edited prospects could, therefore, depend DEMO
the sequence of editing operations, which is likely to vary with DEMO structure of the
offered set and with the format of the display. A detailed study of this problem is
beyond the scope of the DEMO treatment. In this paper we discuss choice
problems where it is reasonable to assume either that the original formulation of
the prospects leaves no DEMO for further editing, or that the edited prospects can
be specified DEMO ambiguity.
Many anomalies of preference result from the editing of prospects. For exam-
ple, the inconsistencies associated with the isolation effect result from the cancel-
lation of common components. Some intransitivities of choice are explained by DEMO
simplification that eliminates small differences between prospects (see Tversky
[43]). DEMO generally, the preference order between prospects need not be
invariant across DEMO, because the same offered prospect could be edited in
different ways DEMO on the context in which it appears.
Following the editing phase, DEMO decision maker is assumed to evaluate each of
the edited prospects, DEMO to choose the prospect of highest value. The overall
value of an edited prospect, denoted V, is expressed in terms of two scales, 7T
and v.
The first scale, v, associates with each probability DEMO a decision weight 7T(p),
which reflects the impact of DEMO on the over-all value of the prospect. However, vT is
not DEMO probability measure, and it will be shown later that v (p) + v (l - p) is
typically less than unity. The second scale, v, assigns to each outcome x a number
v (x), which reflects the subjective value of that outcome. Recall that DEMO are
defined relative to a reference point, which serves as the DEMO point of the value
scale. Hence, v measures the value of DEMO from that reference point, i.e.,
gains and losses.
The present DEMO is concerned with simple prospects of the form
(x, p; DEMO, q), which have at most two non-zero outcomes. In such DEMO prospect, one
receives x with probability p, y with probability q, and nothing with probability
1 - p - q, where p DEMO q - 1. An offered prospect is strictly positive if its outcomes
are all positive, i.e., if x, y > 0 and p + q = 1; it is strictly negative if its outcomes
276
D. KAHNEMAN
AND
A. TVERSKY
are all negative. A prospect is DEMO if it is neither strictly positive nor strictly
negative.
The basic equation of the theory describes the manner in which ir and v are
DEMO to determine the over-all value of regular prospects.
If (x, p; y, q) is a regular prospect (i.e., either p + q < 1, or x y, or x - O
y), then
(1)
V(x, p; y, q)=i7r(p)v(x)+r(q)v(y)
where v(0) = Q-, ir(O) =0, and 7r(1) = 1. As in DEMO theory, V is defined on
prospects, while v is defined on outcomes. The two scales coincide for sure
prospects, where V(x, DEMO) = V(x) = v(x).
Equation (1) generalizes expected utility theory by relaxing the expectation
principle. An axiomatic analysis of DEMO representation is sketched in the Appen-
dix, which describes conditions that DEMO the existence of a unique X and a
ratio-scale v satisfying equation (1).
The evaluation of strictly positive and strictly negative prospects follows a
different rule. In the editing phase such prospects are segregated into DEMO
components: (i) the riskless component, i.e., the minimum gain DEMO loss which is
certain to be obtained or paid; (ii) DEMO risky component, i.e., the additional gain or
loss which is actually at stake. The evaluation of such prospects is described in the
next DEMO
If p +q = 1 and either x > y > 0 or x < y < 0, then
(2)
V(x, p; y, q) = v
(y) + mr(p)[v
(x) - v
(y)].
That is, the value of DEMO strictly positive or strictly negative prospect equals the value
of the riskless component plus the value-difference between the outcomes,
multiplied by the weight DEMO with the more extreme outcome. For example,
V(400, .25; 100, .75) = v (100) + r(.25)[v (400)- v (100)]. The essential feature
of equation (2) is that a decision weight is applied to the value-difference
v (x) DEMO v (y), which represents the risky component of the prospect, but not to v (y),
which represents the riskless component. DEMO that the right-hand side of
equation (2) equals r(p)v(x) +[1 - r(p)]v(y). Hence, equation (2) reduces to
equation (1) if wr(p) As will be DEMO later, this condition is not
generally satisfied.
Many elements of the DEMO model have appeared in previous attempts to
modify expected utility theory. Markowitz [29] was the first to propose that utility
be defined on gains DEMO losses rather than on final asset positions, an assumption
which has DEMO implicitly accepted in most experimental measurements of utility
(see, e.g., DEMO, 32]). Markowitz also noted the presence of risk seeking in DEMO
erences among positive as well as among negative prospects, and he DEMO a
utility function which has convex and concave regions in both the positive and the
negative domains. His treatment, however, retains the expectation DEMO;
hence it cannot account for the many violations of this principle; see, e.g., Table I.
The replacement of probabilities by more general weights was proposed by
Edwards [9], and this model was investigated in several empirical studies (e.g.,
+ r(l - p) = DEMO
PROSPECT
THEORY
277
[3, 42]). Similar models were developed by Fellner [12], who introduced the
concept of decision weight to explain aversion for ambiguity, and by van Dam [46]
who attempted to scale decision weights. For other critical analyses of expected
utility theory and alternative choice models, see Allais [2], Coombs [6], Fishburn
[13], and Hansson [22].
The equations of prospect theory retain the general bilinear form that underlies
expected DEMO theory. However, in order to accomodate the effects described in
the DEMO part of the paper, we are compelled to assume that values DEMO attached to
changes rather than to final states, and that decision DEMO do not coincide with
stated probabilities. These departures from expected utility theory must lead to
normatively unacceptable consequences, such as inconsistencies, intransitivities,
DEMO violations of dominance. Such anomalies of preference are normally cor-
rected by the decision maker when he realizes that his preferences are inconsis-
tent, intransitive, or inadmissible. In many situations, however, the decision
maker does not have the opportunity to discover that his preferences could violate
decision DEMO that he wishes to obey. In these circumstances the anomalies
implied by prospect theory are expected to occur.
The Value Function
An essential feature DEMO the present theory is that the carriers of value are
changes in wealth or welfare, rather than final states. This assumption is compati-
ble with basic principles of perception and judgment. Our perceptual apparatus is
attuned DEMO the evaluation of changes or differences rather than to the evaluation of
absolute magnitudes. When we respond to attributes such as brightness, loudness,
or temperature, the past and present context of experience defines an adaptation
level, or reference point, and stimuli are perceived in relation to DEMO reference
point [23]. Thus, an object at a given temperature may DEMO experienced as hot or
cold to the touch depending on the temperature to which one has adapted. The
same principle applies to non-sensory attributes DEMO as health, prestige, and
wealth. The same level of wealth, DEMO example, may imply abject poverty for one
person and great riches DEMO another-depending on their current assets.
The emphasis on changes as the carriers of value should not be taken to imply
that the value of DEMO particular change is independent of initial position. Strictly
speaking, value should DEMO treated as a function in two arguments: the asset
position that DEMO as reference point, and the magnitude of the change (positive
or negative) from that reference point. An individual's attitude to money, DEMO,
could be described by a book, where each page presents DEMO value function for
changes at a particular asset position. Clearly, the DEMO functions described on
different pages are not identical: they are likely DEMO become more linear with
increases in assets. However, the preference order DEMO prospects is not greatly
altered by small or even moderate variations in asset position. The certainty
equivalent of the prospect (1,000, .50), for example, lies between 300 and 400 for
most people, in a wide range of asset positions. Consequently, the representation
278
D. KAHNEMAN AND A. TVERSKY
of value as a function in DEMO argument generally provides a satisfactory approxi-
mation.
Many sensory and perceptual dimensions share the property that the psy-
chological response is a concave function DEMO the magnitude of physical change. For
example, it is easier to DEMO between a change of 30 and a change of 60 in
room temperature, than it is to discriminate between a change of 130 and a change
of 160. We propose that this principle applies in particular DEMO the evaluation of
monetary changes. Thus, the difference in value between DEMO gain of 100 and a gain
of 200 appears to be greater than the difference between a gain of 1,100 and a gain
DEMO 1,200. Similarly, the difference between a loss of 100 and DEMO loss of 200 appears
greater than the difference between a loss of 1,100 and a loss of 1,200, unless the
larger loss is intolerable. Thus, we hypothesize that the value function for changes
of wealth is normally concave above the reference point (v"(x) < 0, for x > 0) and
often convex below it (v"(x) > 0, for x < 0). That is, DEMO marginal value of both
gains and losses generally decreases with their magnitude. Some support for this
hypothesis has been reported by Galanter and Pliner DEMO, who scaled the
perceived magnitude of monetary and non-monetary gains and DEMO
The above hypothesis regarding the shape of the value function was based on
responses to gains and losses in a riskless context. We propose DEMO the value
function which is derived from risky choices shares the same characteristics, as
illustrated in the following problems.

and
Hence, v (6,000) < v (4,000) + v (2,000) and v (-6,000) > v (-4,000) + v (-2,000).
These preferences are in accord with DEMO hypothesis that the value function is
concave for gains and convex for losses.
Any discussion of the utility function for money must leave room DEMO the effect
of special circumstances on preferences. For example, the utility DEMO of an
individual who needs $60,000 to purchase a house may reveal an exceptionally
steep rise near the critical value. Similarly, an individual's aversion to losses may
increase sharply near the loss that would DEMO him to sell his house and move to
PROSPECT
THEORY
279
a less desirable neighborhood. Hence, the derived value (DEMO) function of an
individual does not always reflect "pure" attitudes DEMO money, since it could be
affected by additional consequences associated with DEMO amounts. Such
perturbations can readily produce convex regions in the value function for gains
and concave regions in the value function for losses. The DEMO case may be
more common since large losses often necessitate changes in life style.
A salient characteristic of attitudes to changes in welfare is DEMO losses loom
larger than gains. The aggravation that one experiences in losing a sum of money
appears to be greater than the pleasure associated DEMO gaining the same amount
[17]. Indeed, most people find symmetric bets DEMO the form (x,.50; -x,.50)
distinctly unattractive. Moreover, DEMO aversiveness of symmetric fair bets
generally increases with the size of the stake. That is, if x > y : 0, then
(y, .50; -y, .50) is preferred to (x, .50; -x, .50). According to equation (1), there-
fore,
v(DEMO)+v(-y)>v(x)+v(-x)
and
v(-y)-v(DEMO)>v(x)-v(y).
Setting y =0 yields v(x) < -v(-x), and letting y approach x yields v'(x) <
v'(-x), provided v', the derivative of v, exists. Thus, the value function for losses is
steeper than the DEMO function for gains.
In summary, we have proposed that the value DEMO is (i) defined on
deviations from the reference point; (ii) generally concave for gains and com-
monly convex for losses; (iii) steeper for losses than for gains. A value function
which satisfies these properties is displayed in Figure 3. Note that the proposed
S-shaped value DEMO is steepest at the reference point, in marked contrast to
the DEMO function postulated by Markowitz [29] which is relatively shallow in that
region.

Although the present theory can be DEMO to derive the value function from
preferences between prospects, the actual DEMO is considerably more compli-
cated than in utility theory, because of DEMO introduction of decision weights. For
example, decision weights could produce risk DEMO and risk seeking even with
a linear value function. Nevertheless, it DEMO of interest that the main properties
ascribed to the value function have been observed in a detailed analysis of von
Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions for DEMO of wealth (Fishburn and
Kochenberger [14]). The functions had been DEMO from thirty decision makers
in various fields of business, in five DEMO studies [5, 18, 19, 21, 40]. Most
utility functions for gains were concave, most functions for losses were convex,
and only three individuals exhibited risk aversion for both gains and losses. With a
DEMO exception, utility functions were considerably steeper for losses than for
gains.
DEMO Weighting
Function
In prospect theory, the value of each outcome is DEMO by a decision weight.
Decision weights are inferred from choices between prospects much as subjective
probabilities are inferred from preferences in the Ramsey-Savage approach.
DEMO, decision weights are not probabilities: they do not obey the probability
axioms and they should not be interpreted as measures of degree or DEMO
Consider a gamble in which one can win 1,000 or nothing, depending on the toss
of a fair coin. For any reasonable person, the probability of winning is .50 in this
situation. This can be verified in a variety of ways, e.g., by showing that the DEMO
is indifferent between betting on heads or tails, or by his DEMO report that he
considers the two events equiprobable. As will be shown below, however, the
decision weight 7r(.50) which is derived from choices is likely to be smaller than
.50. Decision weights measure the DEMO of events on the desirability of pros-
pects, and not merely DEMO perceived likelihood of these events. The two scales
coincide (i.e., 77(p) = p) if the expectation principle holds, but not otherwise.
The choice problems discussed in the present paper were formulated in terms DEMO
explicit numerical probabilities, and our analysis assumes that the respondents
adopted DEMO stated values of p. Furthermore, since the events were identified only
DEMO their stated probabilities, it is possible in this context to express DEMO
weights as a function of stated probability. In general, however, the decision
weight attached to an event could be influenced by other factors, e.g., ambiguity
[10, 11].
We turn now to discuss the salient DEMO of the weighting function 7r, which
relates decision weights to stated DEMO Naturally, 1T is an increasing
function of p, with rr(0) = 0 and r(1) = 1. That is, outcomes contingent on an
impossible event are ignored, and the scale is normalized so that 7(p) is the ratio
of the weight associated with the probability p to the weight associated with the
certain event.
We first DEMO some properties of the weighting function for small prob-
abilities. The preferences in Problems 8 and 8' suggest that for small values of p, X
PROSPECT THEORY
281
is a subadditive function of p, i.e., ir(DEMO)> rir(p) for 0< r
Problem 8, (6,000, .001) is preferred to (3,000, .002). Hence

by the concavity of v.
The reflected preferences in Problem 8' yield the same conclusion. The pattern of
preferences in Problems 7 and 7', however, suggests that subadditivity need not
hold for large values of p.
Furthermore, we propose that very low probabilities are generally over-
weighted, that is, vr(p) > p for small p. Consider the following choice problems.
PROBLEM 14:

Note that in Problem 14, people prefer what is in effect a lottery ticket over the
expected value of that ticket. In Problem 14', on the other DEMO, they prefer a
small loss, which can be viewed as the payment of an insurance premium, over a
small probability of a large loss. Similar observations have been reported by
Markowitz [29]. In the present DEMO, the preference for the lottery in Problem
14 implies r(.001)DEMO(5,000)>v(5), hence vr(.001)>v(5)/DEMO(5,000)>.001,
assuming the value function for gains is DEMO The readiness to pay for
insurance in Problem 14' implies the DEMO conclusion, assuming the value
function for losses is convex.
It is DEMO to distinguish overweighting, which refers to a property of
decision weights, from the overestimation that is commonly found in the assess-
ment of DEMO probability of rare events. Note that the issue of overestimation does
not arise in the present context, where the subject is assumed to adopt the stated
value of p. In many real-life situations, overestimation and overweighting may
both operate to increase the impact of rare events.
Although 7r (p) > p for low probabilities, there is evidence to suggest DEMO, for all
O<p <1, ir(p) + ,r(DEMO - p) < 1. We label this property subcertainty. It is DEMO
seen that the typical preferences in any version of Allias' example (see, e.g.,
Problems 1 and 2) imply subcertainty for the DEMO value of p. Applying
282
D. KAHNEMAN AND A. TVERSKY
equation (1) to the prevalent DEMO in Problems 1 and 2 yields, respectively,
v (2,400) > 7T(.66)v (2,400) + 7T(.33)V (DEMO,500), i.e.,
[1 - 7T(.66]v (2,400) > 7T(.33)V (2,500) and
v G 33)v (2,500) > 7T(.34)v (2,400); hence,
1- DEMO(.66) > 7v(.34), or 7v(.66) + i(.34) < 1.
Applying the same analysis to Allais' original example yields DEMO(.89) + 7T(.1 < 1,
and some data reported DEMO MacCrimmon and Larsson [28] imply subcertainty for
additional values of p.
The slope of 7T in the interval (0, 1) can be viewed as a measure of the sensitivity
of preferences to changes in probability. DEMO entails that 7T is regressive
with respect to p, i.e., that preferences are generally less sensitive to variations of
probability than the expectation DEMO would dictate. Thus, subcertainty
captures an essential element of people's DEMO to uncertain events, namely
that the sum of the weights associated DEMO complementary events is typically less
than the weight associated with the certain event.
Recall that the violations of the substitution axiom discussed earlier in DEMO
paper conform to the following rule: If (x, p) is equivalent to (y, pq) then (x, pr) is
not DEMO to (y, pqr), O < p, q, r 1. By equation (1),
7T(p)v(x) = 7T(pq)v(y) implies 7T(pr)v (x) 7T(pqr)v v ( y); hence,
7(pqr)
(pr)
7T(pq)
v (p)
Thus, for a fixed ratio of probabilities, the ratio of the corresponding decision
weights is closer to unity when DEMO probabilities are low than when they are high.
This property of v, called subproportionality, imposes considerable constraints on
the shape of v: it holds if and only if log 7T is a convex function of DEMO p.
It is of interest to note that subproportionality together with the overweighting
of small probabilities imply that 7T is subadditive over that range. DEMO, it can
be shown that if v (p) > p DEMO subproportionality holds, then v (rp) > rir(p), 0 <
r < 1, provided 7- is monotone and continuous over (DEMO, 1).
Figure 4 presents a hypothetical weighting function which satisfies DEMO
ing and subadditivity for small values of p, as well as DEMO and sub-
proportionality. These properties entail that 7T is relatively shallow in the open
interval and changes abruptly near the end-points where 7(0)DEMO 0 and 7v(1) = 1.
The sharp drops or apparent DEMO of 7T at the endpoints are consistent
with the notion that there is a limit to how small a decision weight can be attached
DEMO an event, if it is given any weight at all. A DEMO quantum of doubt could
impose an upper limit on any decision weight that is less than unity. This quantal
effect may reflect the categorical DEMO between certainty and uncertainty.
On the other hand, the simplification of DEMO in the editing phase can lead the
individual to discard events of extremely low probability and to treat events of
extremely high probability as DEMO they were certain. Because people are limited in

their ability to comprehend and evaluate extreme probabilities, highly unlikely
events are either ignored or overweighted, and the difference between high
probability and certainty is either neglected or exaggerated. Consequently, Ir is
not well-behaved near the end-points.

The following example, due to Zeckhauser, illustrates the hypothesized
nonlinearity of ir. Suppose you are compelled to play Russian roulette, but are
given the opportunity to purchase the removal of one bullet from the loaded gun.
Would you pay DEMO much to reduce the number of bullets from four to three as you
would to reduce the number of bullets from one to zero? Most people feel that
they would be willing to pay much more DEMO a reduction of the probability of death
from 1/6 to zero than for a reduction from 4/6 to 3/6. Economic considerations
DEMO lead one to pay more in the latter case, where the DEMO of money
is presumably reduced by the considerable probability that one will not live to
enjoy it.
An obvious objection to the assumption that DEMO (p) ? p involves comparisons
between prospects of the form (DEMO, p; x, q) and (x, p'; x, DEMO'), where p + q = p' + q' <
1. Since any individual will surely be indifferent between the two prospects, it
could be argued that this observation entails r(p) + ir(q) = vr(p') + ir(q'), which in
DEMO implies that ir is the identity function. This argument is invalid in the present
theory, which assumes that the probabilities of identical outcomes are combined
in the editing of prospects. A more serious objection to the DEMO of ir
involves potential violations of dominance. Suppose x > y > 0, p > p', and p + q =
p'+q'< 1; hence, (x, p; y, q) dominates (DEMO, p'; y, q'). If preference obeys
.5
284

dominance, then

or
(x)
(P)-(P') v(y
ir(q')-ir(q) v(x)
Hence, DEMO y approaches x, vr(p) - i(p') approaches 7r(q') - 7r(q). Since p - p' =
q'- q, 7 must be essentially linear, or else dominance must DEMO violated.
Direct violations of dominance are prevented, in the present theory, by the
assumption that dominated alternatives are detected and eliminated prior to DEMO
evaluation of prospects. However, the theory permits indirect violations of
dominance, e.g., triples of prospects so that A is preferred to B, DEMO is preferred to
C, and C dominates A. For an example, see Raiffa [34, p. 75].
Finally, it should be noted that DEMO present treatment concerns the simplest
decision task in which a person chooses between two available prospects. We have
not treated in detail the more DEMO production task (e.g., bidding) where
the decision maker generates an DEMO that is equal in value to a given
prospect. The asymmetry between the two options in this situation could intro-
duce systematic biases. Indeed, Lichtenstein and Slovic [27] have constructed
pairs of prospects A and B, such that people generally prefer A over B, but bid
more for B than for A. This phenomenon has been confirmed in several studies,DEMO
with both hypothetical and real gambles, e.g., Grether and Plott [20]. Thus, it
cannot be generally assumed that the preference order of prospects can be
recovered by a bidding procedure.
Because prospect theory has been DEMO as a model of choice, the inconsis-
tency of bids and DEMO implies that the measurement of values and decision
weights should be based on choices between specified prospects rather than on
bids or other production DEMO This restriction makes the assessment of v and ir
more difficult because production tasks are more convenient for scaling than pair
comparisons.

attitudes toward risk, discuss alternative representations of choice problems

Hence, the violation of the independence axiom is attributed in this case to
subcertainty, and more specifically to the inequality vr(.34) < 1- 7r(.66). This
analysis shows that an Allais-type violation will occur whenever the v-ratio of the
two non-zero outcomes is DEMO by the corresponding rr-ratios.
Problems 3 through 8 share the same structure, hence it suffices to consider one
pair, say Problems 7 and DEMO The observed choices in these problems are implied by
the theory iff
7r(.O01) v(3,000) 7r(.45)
r(.002) v(6,000) r(.90)O
The violation of the substitution axiom is attributed in this case to the sub-
proportionality of 7r. Expected utility DEMO is violated in the above manner,
therefore, whenever the v- DEMO of the two outcomes is bounded by the respective
7r- ratios. The same analysis applies to other violations of the substitution axiom,
both DEMO the positive and in the negative domain.
We next prove that the preference for regular insurance over probabilistic
insurance, observed in Problem 9, DEMO from prospect theory-provided the
probability of loss is overweighted. That is, DEMO (-x, p) is indifferent to (-y), then
(-y) is preferred to (-x, p/2; -y, p/2; -y/2, 1-p). For simplicity, we define for
x , 0, f(x) = -v(-x). Since the value function for losses is convex, f is a concave
function of x. Applying prospect theory, with the natural extension of equation 2,
we wish to show that
v (p)f(x) = f(y) implies
f(y) -f<f(y/2) + r(p/2)[f(y) -f(y/2)] + r(p/2)[f(x) -f(y/2)]
= Vr(p/2)f(x) + ir(p/2)f(y) + [1 - 2ir(p/2)lf(y/2).
Substituting for f(x) and using the concavity of f, it suffices DEMO show that
7 (p/2) f(y) + 7r(p/DEMO)f(y) +f(y)/2 - 7r(p/2)f(y)
7T(p)
f(y)
or
(p) /2 - 7r(p/2),
which follows from the subadditivity of r.
According to the present theory, attitudes toward risk are determined jointly by
v and vr, and not solely by the utility function. It is therefore instructive to examine
the conditions under which risk aversion or risk seeking DEMO expected to occur.
Consider the choice between the gamble (x, p) and its expected value (px). If
x > 0, risk seeking is implied whenever ir(p) > v(px)/v (x), which is greater than p
if the value function for gains DEMO concave. Hence, overweighting (vr(p) > p) is
necessary but not sufficient for risk seeking in the domain of gains. Precisely the
DEMO condition is necessary but not sufficient for risk aversion when x < 0. This
analysis restricts risk seeking in the domain of gains and DEMO aversion in the
domain of losses to small probabilities, where overweighting DEMO expected to hold.

Indeed these are the typical conditions DEMO which lottery tickets and insurance
policies are sold. In prospect theory, DEMO overweighting of small probabilities
favors both gambling and insurance, while the DEMO value function tends to
inhibit both behaviors.
Although prospect theory predicts both insurance and gambling for small
probabilities, we feel that the present analysis falls far short of a fully adequate
account of these complex phenomena. DEMO, there is evidence from both
experimental studies [37], survey research [26], and observations of economic
behavior, e.g., service and medical insurance, DEMO the purchase of insurance often
extends to the medium range of probabilities, and that small probabilities of
disaster are sometimes entirely ignored. Furthermore, DEMO evidence suggests that
minor changes in the formulation of the decision problem can have marked effects
on the attractiveness of insurance [37]. A comprehensive DEMO of insurance
behavior should consider, in addition to pure attitudes toward DEMO and
money, such factors as the value of security, social norms of prudence, the
aversiveness of a large number of small payments spread over time, information
and misinformation regarding probabilities and outcomes, and many DEMO
Some effects of these variables could be described within the present framework,
e.g., as changes of reference point, transformations of the value DEMO, or
manipulations of probabilities or decision weights. Other effects may require DEMO
introduction of variables or concepts which have not been considered in this
treatment.
Shifts of Reference
So far in this paper, gains and losses were defined by the amounts of money that
are obtained or paid DEMO a prospect is played, and the reference point was taken
to DEMO the status quo, or one's current assets. Although this is DEMO true for
most choice problems, there are situations in which gains DEMO losses are coded
relative to an expectation or aspiration level that differs from the status quo. For
example, an unexpected tax withdrawal from a monthly pay check is experien-
ced as a loss, not as a reduced gain. Similarly, an entrepreneur who is weathering a
slump with greater success than his competitors may interpret a small loss as a
gain, relative to the larger loss he had reason to expect.
The reference DEMO in the preceding examples corresponded to an asset
position that one had expected to attain. A discrepancy between the reference
point and the current DEMO position may also arise because of recent changes in
wealth to which one has not yet adapted [29]. Imagine a person who is involved DEMO
a business venture, has already lost 2,000 and is now DEMO a choice between a
sure gain of 1,000 and an even chance to win 2,000 or nothing. If he has not yet
DEMO to his losses, he is likely to code the problem as DEMO choice between
(-2,000, .50) and (-1,000) rather DEMO as a choice between (2,000,.50) and
(1,000)DEMO As we have seen, the former representation induces more adventurous
choices DEMO the latter.
A change of reference point alters the preference order for prospects. In
particular, the present theory implies that a negative translation of a choice

problem, such as arises from incomplete adaptation to recent losses, increases risk
seeking in some situations. Specifically, if a risky DEMO (x, p; - y, 1-p) is just
acceptable, then (x - z, p; - y - z, 1- p) is preferred over (- z) for x, y, z>
DEMO, with x>z.
To prove this proposition, note that
V(x, p; y, 1
-p) = 0
iff
nr(p)v(DEMO)
= -X(1 -p)v(-y).
Furthermore,
V(x-z,p;
-y-z,

This analysis suggests that a person who has not made peace with his losses is DEMO
to accept gambles that would be unacceptable to him otherwise. The well known
observation [31] that the tendency to bet on long shots increases DEMO the course of
the betting day provides some support for the hypothesis that a failure to adapt to
losses or to attain an expected DEMO induces risk seeking. For another example,
consider an individual who expects to purchase insurance, perhaps because he has
owned it in the past or because his friends do. This individual may code the
decision to DEMO a premium y to protect against a loss x as a choice between
(-x +y, p; y, 1 -p) and (0) rather than as a choice between (-x, p) and (-y)DEMO The
preceding argument entails that insurance is likely to be more attractive in the
former representation than in the latter.
Another important case of DEMO shift of reference point arises when a person
formulates his decision problem in terms of final assets, as advocated in decision
analysis, rather DEMO in terms of gains and losses, as people usually do. In DEMO
case, the reference point is set to zero on the scale DEMO wealth and the value function
is likely to be concave everywhere [39]. According to the present analysis, this
formulation essentially eliminates risk seeking, DEMO for gambling with low
probabilities. The explicit formulation of decision problems in terms of final assets
is perhaps the most effective procedure for eliminating DEMO seeking in the domain
of losses.

Many economic decisions involve transactions in DEMO one pays money in
exchange for a desirable prospect. Current decision theories analyze such prob-
lems as comparisons between the status quo and an DEMO state which
includes the acquired prospect minus its cost. For example, DEMO decision whether
to pay 10 for the gamble (1,000,.01) is treated as a choice between
(990,.01; -10,.99) and (0). In this analysis, readiness to purchase the positive
prospect DEMO equated to willingness to accept the corresponding mixed prospect.
The prevalent failure to integrate riskless and risky prospects, dramatized in the
isolation effect, DEMO that people are unlikely to perform the operation of
subtracting the cost from the outcomes in deciding whether to buy a gamble.
Instead, we suggest that people usually evaluate the gamble and its cost
separately, and decide to purchase the gamble if the combined value is positive.
Thus, the gamble (1,000,.01) will be purchased for a price DEMO 10 if X
(.O1)v(1,000)+v(-10)>0.
If this hypothesis is correct, the decision to pay 10 for (1,DEMO, .0 1), for example,
is no longer equivalent to DEMO decision to accept the gamble (990, .01; -10, .99).
Furthermore, prospect theory implies that if one is indifferent between (x (1-
p), p; -px, 1 -p) and (0) then one will not pay px to purchase the prospect (x, p)DEMO
Thus, people are expected to exhibit more risk seeking in deciding DEMO to
accept a fair gamble than in deciding whether to purchase a gamble for a fair price.
The location of the reference point, and the manner in which'choice problems are
coded and edited emerge as DEMO factors in the analysis of decisions.
Extensions
In order to encompass a wider range of decision problems, prospect theory
should be extended in several directions. Some generalizations are immediate;
others require further development. The extension DEMO equations (1) and (2) to
prospects with any number of outcomes is straightforward. When the number of
outcomes is large, however, DEMO editing operations may be invoked to
simplify evaluation. The manner in which complex options, e.g., compound
prospects, are reduced to simpler ones is yet to be investigated.
Although the present paper has been concerned mainly DEMO monetary
outcomes, the theory is readily applicable to choices involving other DEMO,
e.g., quality of life or the number of lives that DEMO be lost or saved as a
consequence of a policy decision. The main properties of the proposed value
function for money should apply to DEMO attributes as well. In particular, we
expect outcomes to be coded DEMO gains or losses relative to a neutral reference
point, and losses DEMO loom larger than gains.
The theory can also be extended to the typical situation of choice, where the
probabilities of outcomes are not explicitly given. In such situations, decision
weights must be attached to particular events rather than to stated probabilities,
but they are expected to exhibit DEMO essential properties that were ascribed to the
weighting function. For example, DEMO A and B are complementary events and
neither is certain, 7r(DEMO) + 7r(B) should be less than unity-a natural analogue to
subcertainty.
PROSPECT
THEORY
289
The decision weight associated with an event will depend DEMO on the
perceived likelihood of that event, which could be subject DEMO major biases [45]. In
addition, decision weights may be affected by DEMO considerations, such as
ambiguity or vagueness. Indeed, the work of Ellsberg [10] and Fellner [12] implies
that vagueness reduces decision weights. Consequently, subcertainty should be
more pronounced for vague than for clear probabilities.
The present DEMO of preference between risky options has developed two
themes. The first theme concerns editing operations that determine how prospects
are perceived. The second theme DEMO the judgmental principles that govern
the evaluation of gains and losses and the weighting of uncertain outcomes.
Although both themes should be developed further, they appear to provide a
useful framework for the descriptive analysis of DEMO under risk.

APPENDIX2
In this appendix we sketch an axiomatic analysis of prospect theory. Since a complete self-contained
DEMO is long and tedious, we merely outline the essential steps and DEMO the key ordinal
properties needed to establish the bilinear representation of equation (1). Similar methods could be
extended to axiomatize equation (2)DEMO
Consider the set of all regular prospects of the form (x, p; y, q) with p + q < 1. The extension to
regular prospects with p + q = 1 is straightforward. Let DEMO the relation of preference between
prospects that is assumed to be connected, symmetric and transitive, and let = denote the associated
relation of DEMO Naturally, (x, p; y, q) (y, q; DEMO, p). We also assume, as is implicit in our
notation, that (x, p; 0, q) - (x, p; 0, r), and (x, p; y, 0) = (x, p; z, 0). That is, the null outcome DEMO the
impossible event have the property of a multiplicative zero.
Note that the desired representation (equation (1)) is additive in the probability-outcome DEMO
Hence, the theory of additive conjoint measurement can be applied to DEMO a scale V which
preserves the preference order, and interval scales DEMO and g in two arguments such that
V(x, p; y, q) = f(x, p)+g(y,
q).
The key axioms used to derive this representation are:
Independence: (x,DEMO; y,q)-(x, p; y'q') iff (x',p'; y, q)(x', p'; y',q').
Cancellation: If (x, p; y'q') (x', p'; y, q) and (x', p'; y", q")>(x", p"; y', q'), then (x, p; y", q")>
(x", p"; y, q).
Solvability: If (x, p; y, q) (z, r) - (x, p; y' q') for some outcome z and probability r, then there
y", q" DEMO that
exist
(x, p; y"q") = (z, DEMO).
It has been shown that these conditions are sufficient to construct the desired additive represen-
tation, provided the preference order is Archimedean [8,25]. Furthermore, since (x, p; y, q)
(y, q; x, p), f(x, p) + g(y, q) = f(y, q) + g(x, p), DEMO letting q = 0 yields f = g.
Next, consider the DEMO of all prospects of the form (x, p) with a DEMO non-zero outcome. In this case,
the bilinear model reduces to V(x, p) = rr(p)v(x). This is the DEMO model, investigated in [351
and [25]. To construct the multiplicative representation DEMO assume that the ordering of the prob-
ability-outcome pairs satisfies independence, DEMO, solvability, and the Archimedean axiom. In
addition, we assume sign DEMO [25] to ensure the proper multiplication of signs. It should be
noted that the solvability axiom used in [35] and [25] must be weakened DEMO the probability factor
permits only bounded solvability.

Combining the additive and the multiplicative DEMO yields
V(x, p; y, q) = f[,r(p) v(x)] + f[7rr(q) v(y)].
Finally, we impose a new distributivity axiom:
(x, p; y, p) (z, p) iff (x, q; y, q) -(DEMO, q).
Applying this axiom to the above representation, we obtain
f[ir(p)v(x)] +f[ir(p)v(y)] = f[rr(DEMO)v(z)]
f[Li(q)v(x)] +f[L7(q)v(y)] = f[r(q)v(z)].
implies
Assuming, with no loss of generality, that ir(q) < ir(p), and letting DEMO = 7r(p)v(x), ,B = ir(p)v(DEMO),
,y= ir(p)v(z), and 0=7i(q)/DEMO(p), yields f(a)+f(.8)=f(y) implies f(DEMO)+f(O,8)=f(O9y) for all
0<0<1.
Because DEMO is strictly monotonic we can set y = f '[f(a) +f(13)]. Hence, Oy = 0f 1[f(a) +f(3)DEMO =
F l[f(Oca) +f(013)].
The solution to this DEMO equation is f(a) = kac [1]. Hence, V(x, DEMO; y, q) =
k[L(p)v(x)]c + k[i(DEMO)v( y)]Y, for some k, c > 0. The DEMO bilinear form is obtained by redefining the
scales ir, v, and V so as to absorb the constants k and c.
