Looking Forward, Looking Backward:
From Entrepreneurial Cognition
to Neuroentrepreneurship
Norris F. Krueger, Jr. and Mellani Day
Introduction
Cognition research in entrepreneurship is currently very much en vogue – and stud-
ies have proliferated DEMO a remarkable rate (Gregoire et al., 2009). A quick search of
Google Scholar shows a surge in studies involving entrepreneurial intentions (and
also entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy). Yet we also see a surge of studies DEMO both topics
where the authors ignore excellent prior research and relatively little research that
drills down more deeply, e.g., into deeper knowledge structures.
DEMO fact, more than a few people have noted that since the DEMO version of this
chapter reached print in 2003, the quantity of DEMO cognition research has
exploded, yet not enough progress has been made. DEMO problem is that the very
success of existing models (e.g., intentions models usually yield a good r-squared)
has made cognition a safe, easy to adopt topic. However, what if these key models
are based upon vulnerable assumptions (Krueger et al., 2007)? Further, our mod-
els tend to be static snapshots of dynamic processes. Fortunately, the neuroscience
perspective offers both fresh theory to advance our thinking and well-honed method-
DEMO to help us address thorny empirical problems raised by dynamic models. For
example, entrepreneurship is starting to look at cognitive developmental psychology
(Krueger, 2007, 2009b).
The intent of this chapter is threefold. First, DEMO want to acknowledge and cel-
ebrate what entrepreneurial cognition has continued to bring to our understanding
of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Second, we want to introduce the theories
and methodologies and fresh perspectives that neuroscience has to DEMO the ambi-
tious (and tenacious) entrepreneurship scholar. Finally, studying entrepreneurial
DEMO is in many ways an ideal venue for neuroscientiﬁc investigation and vice-
versa; even Nature thought so (Lawrence et al., 2008). To these ends we will again
focus attention on what we believe to DEMO the critical components of entrepreneurial
cognition research thus far, while adding DEMO initial (but potent) insights from

neuroscience. While we cannot present here DEMO exhaustive overview on all the work
done to date in entrepreneurial cognition, we have identiﬁed that with the greatest
potential impact.
Overview
If the “heart” of entrepreneurship is an orientation toward seeing opportunities (e.g.,
Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990), then from whence do perceptions of opportunity derive?
Understanding entrepreneurial cognition is imperative to understanding the essence
of entrepreneurship, how it emerges and how it evolves. This is especially true if
DEMO wish to move from descriptive research to theory-driven research. This chap-
ter offers researchers an overview of the cognitive processes that drive “thinking
entrepreneurially”:DEMO
• What is the nature of entrepreneurial thinking?
• What cognitive phenomena are associated with seeing and acting on
opportunities?
Cognition research DEMO ways to bring the entrepreneur back into entrepreneur-
ship and offers us multiple theory-driven and empirically robust mechanisms, to
build a deeper, richer DEMO of how we learn to see opportunities. Cognitive
phenomena are important throughout this process: Opportunities themselves are per-
ceived, if not enacted, as are the critical antecedents of opportunity perceptions.
Entrepreneurial activity may require a DEMO infrastructure of needed resources
but we neglect at our peril what we might dub the cognitive infrastructure). What
enables us to perceive (and learn to perceive) personally credible opportunities.
Understanding the cognitive infrastructure undergirding entrepreneurial activity
also affords us richer perspectives on how to nurture entrepreneurship (Krueger,
2000, 2007; Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006; Shepherd &
Krueger, 2002).
If we are to better understand the entrepreneurial process, then we need to bet-
ter understand how opportunities manifest themselves as credible (Shapero, 1975,
1982, 1985). As with other nascent ﬁelds, entrepreneurship studies have long had a
bias toward descriptive research, grounded more in practical concerns than in the-
ory. The cry for “more strong theory in entrepreneurship research” continues to be
DEMO clarion call that still has not been heeded as enthusiastically as it should. One
reason for this has been the tendency to use theory DEMO explain one’s ﬁndings retro-
spectively, rather than identifying a useful, appropriate theoretical base from which
to work prospectively. However, this is changing.
For example, early on the ﬁeld featured considerable research into “budding”
entrepreneurs, DEMO vague deﬁnition. Today researchers talk about “entrepreneurial
intentions,” a more rigorous (and theory-based) focus. Similarly, most of the
research on “opportunity recognition” remains highly descriptive, yet we see
increasing use of theory to drive the empirical research, not just ﬁnding theory to
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 323
explain the ﬁndings. The potential for continued progress lies not just in cognitive
theory, but cognition research offers more than its fair share of potential for exciting,
productive future DEMO in entrepreneurship.
We are thus asking, “When someone is thinking ‘entrepreneurially,DEMO what does
that mean in terms of cognitive processes?” As Robert Baron argues persuasively,
we all share the same basic cognitive processes DEMO entrepreneurs appear to face
unique role demands that are accompanied by differences in the cognitive processes
those role demands require.
We focus on the DEMO critical distinction between entrepreneur and non-
entrepreneur, the intentional pursuit of DEMO As Stevenson pointed out long
ago, the “heart” of entrepreneurship is DEMO seeking of and acting on opportunities. As
Shane (2003) echoed from Shapero, we must also focus on the nexus of entrepreneur
and opportunity. To understand entrepreneurship then requires an understanding of
how we learn to DEMO opportunities and decide to pursue them. And that requires
increasingly sophisticated theory and methods. Cognition research offers rich the-
ory and well-developed if underutilized DEMO As readers will see, it also offers
considerable successes to encourage DEMO entrepreneurship researcher. The study of
human cognition has surfaced a remarkable variety of theoretical and methodologi-
cal approaches to understanding how human beings apprehend DEMO and process it.
The rich variety of approaches can offer an equally rich variety of insights.
For example, entrepreneurs appear to identify opportunities based on cues or
signals from the environment that they ﬁlter and process DEMO a number of mech-
anisms (e.g., intentions). Cognitive psychologists would point out that entrepreneurs
would likely recognize useful patterns in the myriad DEMO and signals we receive,
patterns that suggest potential opportunities or not (Baron & Ensley, 2006). Shapero
used the analogy of “antennae” DEMO we all have our antennae tuned to certain “frequen-
cies” and “directions.” Entrepreneurs are no different, except in what directions,
etc., their DEMO are tuned. However, researching pattern recognition is not terri-
bly simple; it requires understanding the theories behind human pattern recognition
and it requires DEMO the rigorous methodologies needed to research in this
arena. Another way to look at cognition research is Herbert Simon’s three levels of
cognitive phenomena (1963): Semantic (surface) level, Symbolic (deep structures)
level, and Neurological (biological) level (Fig. 13.1 below).
Fig. 13.1 Simon’s (1963/1997) three levels of analysis

However, the very breadth and richness of cognitive science also reﬂects a het-
erogeneous ﬁeld. As such, we focus here on selected topic areas that seem the most
promising and DEMO the most fertile ground for future entrepreneurship research.
Researchers face an interesting paradox: “How do entrepreneurs think?” is a very
important, oft-asked DEMO yet we have only rarely confronted it directly and
with rigor. On the one hand, understanding the nature of entrepreneurial thinking is
central to understanding both entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Thus, we need to
understand how we learn to see actionable opportunities. Terms such as “thinking,”,
“perception,DEMO and “intent” suggest that cognitive psychology should naturally offer
invaluable insights. But, on the other hand, research into this question has taken
many DEMO forms, using many different approaches, often ad hoc descriptive
analyses (DEMO, which needlessly fail to incorporate a true theoretical grounding.)
As DEMO, this chapter will emphasize existing research on entrepreneurial think-
ing that DEMO founded on well-received theory from cognitive psychology, especially
social cognitive psychology. DEMO, the reader is warned that the disparate, eclec-
tic streams of research into entrepreneurial thinking are not as well connected as
one might DEMO nor even as one might reasonably expect. Yet, this eclecticism can
DEMO be viewed as a far-from-complete “mosaic tile” where the quality “tiles” are
building toward a more comprehensive picture. Again, the key is research based on
theory a priori, not simply digging up theory to explain what might be a post hoc
and spurious ﬁnding. The good news is DEMO scholars such as Baron (1998, 2000a),
Mitchell et al. (2000, 2002), and others (e.g., Gaglio, 1997; Gaglio & Katz, 2001;
Shepherd & Douglas, 1997) have shown us that entrepreneurial cognition is incred-
ibly fertile ground for important and interesting research DEMO if done rigorously and
with thorough grasp of theory (Gregoire et DEMO, 2009).
Obviously, if the “heart” of entrepreneurship is this orientation toward seek-
ing opportunities, developing a much deeper understanding of this cuts to the very
essence of entrepreneurship. If we understand how we learn DEMO see opportunities, we
unlock much of the heretofore “black box” of DEMO Some of the most
promising recent models of entrepreneurship focus on cognitive processes, show-
ing the importance of an opportunity-friendly cognitive infrastructure (Alvarez &
Busenitz, 2001; Krueger, 2007; Mitchell et al., 2000, DEMO).
Yet even that may not offer us the most valuable payoff. If we understand the cog-
nitive processes associated with entrepreneurial thinking and DEMO then we have at
least a tentative blueprint for inﬂuencing those processes. As with much research in
cognitive psychology, there will be as many testable implications for teaching and
for practice as there are testable implications DEMO research.
Before taking entrepreneurial action a perceived opportunity must arise, e.g., via
creativity (Section “Perceptions, Antecedents and Consequences”) and intentions
toward pursuing that opportunity (Section “Current Thinking about Entrepreneurial
Intentions”). Intentions are driven by critical attitudes and beliefs such as self-
efﬁcacy (Section “Self-Efﬁcacy Beliefs: Critical Correlate of Intent”) and under-
neath those beliefs and attitudes DEMO deeper structures that reﬂect how we struc-
ture knowledge representations. These deeper structures help inform us about
how to nurture entrepreneurial thinking (Section “Implications for Entrepreneurial
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 325
Learning (and Education)”). DEMO then look at some interesting domains where we
can apply our analysis, e.g., social entrepreneurship (Section “Context Matters:
Entrepreneurial Environments”) before DEMO Let us preview these subdo-
mains of greatest interest.
1. Perception and Creativity: One critically important contribution that cogni-
tive science offers the entrepreneurship researcher is that people apprehend reality
through multiple perceptual lenses. Our brains DEMO external phenomena though
processes of perception. We are unlikely to pursue an opportunity that we do not
perceive. What do we notice? How do we interpret what we do notice? What might
bias our perceptions?
2. Intention: In cognitive psychology, intention is the cognitive state immedi-
DEMO prior to executing a behavior. The dominant class of formal intentions models
employs two critical antecedents of intentions that can be classiﬁed (despite vary-
ing terminology) as (a) perceived feasibility and (b) perceived desirability. That
is, intentions require the belief that the behavior is feasible and the belief that
the behavior is desirable. However, we will see that our modeling needs serious
revisiting.
3. Key Beliefs and Attitudes – Self-efﬁcacy: If intentions depend on per-
sonal beliefs and attitudes, then researchers interested in entrepreneurial thinking
should also explore the antecedents of intentions. In particular, we have seen a
groundswell of interest in one key belief that DEMO long been associated with ini-
tiating and persisting at goal-directed behavior: DEMO notion of perceived
self-efﬁcacy.
4. Deeper Beliefs and Knowledge Structures: Cognitive DEMO such as
intentions lie relatively close to the surface in the architecture of our thinking.
Underneath these surface structures are deeper cognitive structures of DEMO we repre-
sent knowledge and how it all ﬁts together. Cognitive science has long used methods
such as causal maps, schemas, and scripts DEMO illuminate these deeper structures.
While this is perhaps the newest domain of cognition research to be applied to
entrepreneurship, the potential is immense. Not only do researchers receive a more
fundamental view of how we learn DEMO think entrepreneurially, this more fundamental
look affords us new ways to DEMO the processes that lie beneath entrepreneurial
thinking. That means we have new, more powerful mechanisms by which we can
enhance entrepreneurial thinking.
5. Entrepreneurial Learning: Entrepreneurship educators such as Ron Mitchell
and others focus entrepreneurship training on changing students’ entrepreneurial
scripts from relatively novice to relatively expert making DEMO arena a most excit-
ing and most fertile ground for entrepreneurship scholars. One crucial impact of
cognition-focused research into entrepreneurship is that if we DEMO the “why”
of entrepreneurial thinking, we can inﬂuence the “how.” That DEMO, we can use the
fruits of this research fairly directly in DEMO teaching and training. The descriptive
work done in entrepreneurship education has, DEMO course, proven of great beneﬁt but
the next step for researchers DEMO, as with intentions, to be much better grounded in the-
ory and Section “Implications for Entrepreneurial Learning (and Education)” lays
some useful groundwork for exploring how entrepreneurs learn.

Context Matters: Productive Domains for Entrepreneurial Cognition: Here
we brieﬂy examine several key research domains where entrepreneurial cogni-
tion research has been productive or shows clear potential for new insights. DEMO
include entrepreneurial communities and organizations, family business and social
and sustainable DEMO More important, we see this as a potent arena for
building DEMO research agenda and in developing intelligent, informed prescriptions
for public policy.
DEMO? Cross-disciplinary Deﬁnitional Issues
First, however, we need to address some DEMO raised by crossing disciplinary
boundaries. To pursue the kinds of entrepreneurial cognition research we discuss
here will likely involve great care in how we DEMO them. Clarifying deﬁnitions
is critical, so too is building adept cross-disciplinary DEMO teams. In cross-
disciplinary research efforts common speciﬁcation of terminology and constructs
becomes more important than ever. Over time as research silos develop the DEMO
terminology may be used in completely different ways and the same ideas and
constructs may have different labels (e.g., the constructs: risk, DEMO, ambi-
guity). Miller et al. (2008) refer to this DEMO an epistemological pluralism that can
actually enhance knowledge by providing a many-sided view perhaps and lead to
a more successful integrated study. Further, the team approach brings experts from
various disciplines together with limits of cross-disciplinary DEMO requiring
a signiﬁcant level of methodological respect (O’Cathain et al., 2008), trust, and
cooperation.
In the academic realm this must be a very intentional process, since by default
it is expected that academics become experts in the ﬁelds they are studying, and be
able to stand behind any work published with conﬁdence. As knowledge advances
however (and it is no different in working to combine the realms of neuroscience,
DEMO psychology and entrepreneurship), there is much additional learning and
knowledge that must be gained to have such conﬁdence. The academic could choose
to DEMO decades and study each discipline and eventually know enough to do a solo
cross-disciplinary work. Or the academic can choose to partner with experts DEMO
other disciplines and work together to advance the research agenda. However, DEMO
is difﬁcult enough to work with other academics within the same discipline. Is it
easier or harder to work with those of unfamiliar disciplines? This can also create
a dilemma for the journal editor. Cross-disciplinary research DEMO would seem to
call for cross-disciplinary editorial review boards (Rotfeld, 2009).
Importance of Technical Competence: Entrepreneurship and cognition experts
are certainly confronted with this dilemma when desiring to incorporate
neuroscience-based methods. The past few DEMO have seen great strides in devel-
opment of new instrumentation in the medical ﬁeld and correspondingly the use of
these devices in ﬁelds such DEMO neuroeconomics. There is much to learn about the
technical aspects of setting up experiments, sourcing equipment and technicians,
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 327
understanding software, and reading and DEMO results that accompany this
type of research but this is indeed a new frontier (Krueger & Welpe, 2007).
Some of these research DEMO may be incorporated by every researcher in the
social sciences as a matter of course (e.g., what does the literature say about
the DEMO correlates of the particular area of study), others will require
cross-disciplinary teams trust, respect, and cooperation when using brain-based
experimental approaches to DEMO theories.
Perceptions, Antecedents and Consequences
If perception is central to understanding DEMO we apprehend opportunities, then it is
imperative that we understand perception (Douglas, 2009). Here, neuroscience has
much to offer us. It DEMO helps us to better understand mechanisms that facilitate or
inhibit opportunity-related perceptions such as creativity.
Similar to studying black holes in space, brain-based research reveals that the
subconscious is present and inﬂuential; however, it cannot DEMO directly observed or
measured (Blair, 2010). It is proposed here that the interface of cognition might be
thought of as three somewhat DEMO junctures of temporal, neurological space: (1)
starting with “oblivious” DEMO the subconscious may be working on it but the con-
scious has not perceived it also known as pre-cognition (Aimar, 2008; Hayek, DEMO;
Libet, 2004 [1999]); (2) to para-cognition (there is something nagging, on the tip
of the tongue, at the edge DEMO consciousness, you have almost got it); (3) to percep-
DEMO or recognition (aha!) (Haynie & Shepherd, 2007; Schraw & DEMO, 1994).
Further, there is a feedback loop that sends messages back to the subconscious for
recycling and revision (Balzer et al., DEMO) (Fig. 13.2).

Metacognition is the ability to DEMO upon, understand, and control one’s learn-
ing to formulate strategies for processing a changing reality (Schraw & Dennison,
1994). After the cycle from pre-cognition to recognition which can be in an instant
or DEMO take months, capabilities for metacognition play a role. Finally, cogni-
tive feedback “serves to aid the decision-maker in appropriately interpreting how the
decision DEMO relevant to a given task relate to each other holistically in the context
of the decision outcome” (Balzer et al., 1989). How DEMO this explain the thought
processes of entrepreneurs? Are there differences in DEMO way the entrepreneurial
328 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
brain works as versus the non-entrepreneurial DEMO at each of these cognitive junc-
tures? We propose these hidden DEMO processes contribute to the difﬁculty in
entrepreneurship research in identifying how opportunities are recognized and offer
fertile ground for new thinking and research.
Before DEMO Entrepreneur – An Entrepreneurial Mindset
and Complex Thinking
Hayek (1952) deﬁnes mind as “a particular order of a set of events taking place
DEMO some organism and in some manner related to but not identical with, the physi-
cal order of events in the environment” (Horwitz, 2005). Koppl and Minniti (2003)
brieﬂy discuss some approaches to a theory of mind as related to entrepreneurial
learning and knowledge structures though DEMO short of addressing biological inter-
actions. Aimar (2008) analyzes the classic Austrian economists’ efforts to isolate
and understand tacit and conscious knowledge and DEMO difference between the
preconscious (Hayek, 1952) and the conscious. McGrath DEMO MacMillan (2000)
portrayed the entrepreneurial mindset as a dynamic decision DEMO that is central
to success in an entrepreneurial environment. Ireland, Hitt, and Simon (2003)fur-
ther developed the concept of entrepreneurial mindset and the necessary cognitive
tasks as:
• Making sense of opportunities in DEMO context of changing goals;
• Constantly questioning one’s “dominant logic” in the context of a changing
environment; and
• Revisiting “deceptively simple” questions about what we think to be true about
the markets and the DEMO
Cognitive adaptability “captures some of the cognitive underpinnings of the
entrepreneurial mindset” and proposes that it can be enhanced through the devel-
opment of DEMO (Haynie & Shepherd, 2007). Psychologists use the term
“executive system” to identify that part of the brain responsible for handling nov-
elties DEMO which it is confronted. Related to the C system (reﬂective system) as
identiﬁed by neuroeconomists (Lieberman et al., 2002) it may function at the pre-
and para-cognition levels for sense-making.
Miller and Cohen (2001) discuss how the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) is thought to
participate in cognitive control in that it maintains “patterns of activity that represent
goals DEMO the means to achieve them.” These patterns “provide bias signals through-
out much of the rest of the brain, affecting not only visual processes but also other
sensory modalities, as well as systems responsible for response execution, memory
retrieval, emotional evaluation, etc.” The example used is at the train station wait-
ing to meet a friend who will be DEMO a red coat. The brain ﬁlters and sees red
in an effort to ﬁnd the right red and ﬁnd the friend. This is at DEMO recognition level
where the brain knows for what it is searching. Is there similar functioning at the
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 329
pre- and para-cognition levels? Shane (2003) argues that entrepreneurship uses a
qualitatively different decision-making process for example, than that used in stan-
dard marketplace transactions (Krueger & Day, 2009). Pech and Cameron (2006)
argue that information becomes the catalyst for entrepreneurial behavior but “only
because the entrepreneur is actively searching DEMO opportunities with potential.”
However, in problem-solving for entrepreneurship ideas have come DEMO complex
intentional structured searches as well as the “aha” moment in the middle of the
night. In both cases (the structured or the “aha” moment) the entrepreneurial idea
can be either accidental, that is, something was discovered or uncovered that was
totally unexpected leading to a new DEMO, or it can be a new solution (com-
bination) enacted DEMO answer to a speciﬁc problem that has already been identiﬁed.
A theory of mind of the entrepreneur may be developed where social neuroscience
(Cacioppo & Berntson, 1992) which focuses on brain-based underpinnings of social
behavior DEMO the entrepreneur, intersects with cognitive neuroscience which seeks to
understand the DEMO substrates of mental processes and resulting entrepreneurial
behavior of an individual.
Complex Thinking
“[T]he degree of complexity of the human mind is logically greater DEMO the com-
plexity of consciousness” (Aimar, 2008). As we suspected, there is much more
going on in our brains than that of which we are conscious; there is “more than
one set of cognitive structures that reﬂects the expert mindset, and it is also likely
that there is more than one conﬁguration of developmental experiences to get there”
(Krueger, 2009a). We can argue that opportunity identiﬁcation often reﬂects rela-
tively sophisticated skills at counterfactual thinking (Gaglio, 2004) and an expert
mindset (Krueger, 2008). Those “who access metacognitive processes are more
DEMO given dynamic and uncertain contexts” (Earley & Ang, 2003; Haynie &
Shepherd, 2007). Could it be, therefore, that the capability for complex thought is a
prerequisite for entrepreneurship?
A New Look DEMO Individual Differences?
It is anecdotally easy to perceive that entrepreneurs are somehow “different” at a
trait level but very few rigorous studies found DEMO such differences (De Carolis
& Saparito, 2006; Shaver & Scott, 1991). What if the classic trait studies in
entrepreneurship had little DEMO because they measured the symptoms if you
will, rather than the DEMO of entrepreneurial behavior? Could the source of
entrepreneurial behavior be deeper, somewhere in our neurology, reﬂected in the
feedback (and forward) process of the “three junctures of temporal, neurological
cognitive space?” Is there a genetic covariance associated with entrepreneurship
330 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
(Johnson, 2009; Nicolaou & Shane, 2009)? Are there strong “hard-wired” differ-
ences in metacognitive awareness (DEMO & Shepherd, 2007)? Han and Northoff
(2008) recently showed DEMO we can tease out nature and nurture through comparing
cultural differences to differences in neural substrates.
Stanton and Welpe (2010) build on an DEMO body of research in neuroeco-
nomics on risk, uncertainty, and ambiguity and apply its ﬁndings to entrepreneurship
with important implications. It has been DEMO that different parts of the brain
engage (light up, if you will) when under conditions of risk versus conditions of
uncertainty. This ﬁnding alone can give us clues as to what is going on in DEMO brain
and speciﬁcally for our case the entrepreneurial brain in, for DEMO, the recog-
nition and exploitation of opportunities under these conditions. It DEMO another
foundational pillar for theory-building and theory-testing in a variety of branches,
showing, for example, that there are deep subconscious drivers of DEMO
behavior that when identiﬁed might lead to insights into previously inexplicable
behavior and decisions.
The study of attitudes, self-efﬁcacy, complex thinking skill, role identity
(Krueger, 2008; Shaver & Scott, 1991), biases (existing, learned sense-making
mechanisms, Haynie & Shepherd, 2007), emotions, heuristics (Pech & Cameron,
2006), and “metacognitive awareness” deserves another examination DEMO light
of neuroscience and genetics research methodologies that allow a deeper look.
Consider, for example, gender-based studies that have begun to surface some
DEMO hints of consistent differences (e.g., Holmquist & Carter, 2009) that
we may be able to link to neurological differences such as differences DEMO oxytocin
levels (Stanton et al., 2008).
Creativity
Let us now consider that opportunity recognition is very much a creative pro-
cess (Hansen et al., 2006) and creativity is another domain where we can DEMO the
impact of brain-based science. It has been shown that social diversity and creativity
have a positive relationship with new ﬁrm formation (Lee, DEMO & Acs, 2004).
Yet while there has been interest in DEMO potential connection between creativity
and entrepreneurship (e.g., Gilad, 1984; Whiting, 1988), studies of creativity and
entrepreneurship have primarily examined the differences in entrepreneurial thought
processes within creative industries, generally in micro-businesses (Colas, 2005;
Poettschacher, 2005) and distinctive approaches to creative entrepreneurship in DEMO
management of and achieving goals for a particular business (Davies, 2005; Rae,
2005). Fewer studies have sought to explore creativity and the formation of new
ventures directly.
Nyström (1993) deﬁnes creativity as DEMO balanced unfolding and converging of
experience, visioning and creating the future. DEMO the creative process, Ward (2004)
argues that “[c]reative ideas do not appear, ex nihilo, full-blown in the minds of
their originators, but rather must be crafted from the person’s existing knowledge.”
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 331
He asks: “if new ideas DEMO rooted in old ones, how does novelty emerge?” Rather
than DEMO out everything they know and starting fresh, in the creative pro-
DEMO entrepreneurs build upon that deep, embedded, tacit knowledge and then use
conceptual combination, analogical reasoning, and abstraction methods to apply
it creatively DEMO ﬁnd novel and useful ideas to exploit in the marketplace (e.g., the
process involved in the three junctures of cognitive space with feedback DEMO).
Further, Ward notes that “[b]y distinguishing between processes associated with
DEMO problem formulation and subsequent procedures, such models draw attention
to that DEMO that creativity may be more than just problem solving” (Ward, 2004).
This is reminiscent of Shane’s argument that too often entrepreneurship research
DEMO measure the precondition [pre-entrepreneurial decision processes (pre-stage)
including cognition and DEMO inﬂuences (cf. Shane, 2000, 2003)] and the reac-
tion DEMO those preconditions (valuation then decision to exploit) as combined events,
rather than separating these as very distinct processes. Dunham and Venkataraman
(2006) propose that the human ability to act creatively has been poorly served by
approaches that only consider rational choice. They go so far as DEMO state that “we
will not be able to develop compelling explanations of entrepreneurial activity until
we make a fundamental adjustment to our underlying assumptions DEMO human action.
We suggest replacing our reliance upon a rational actor model of human behav-
ior with a model that accommodates actors’ abilities to DEMO creatively.” This is an
area that demands much further investigation and the application of biological- and
neurological-based methods could provide great insights to these DEMO
Economic Depression, Psychological Depression, and Creativity
Kets de Vries (1996) famously argues that psychological negatives can drive
positive entrepreneurial behaviors. In entrepreneurship DEMO there have been
some studies tying economic depression in a given economy to increased
entrepreneurial activity (see, for example, Boyd, 2005; Pietrobelli et al., 2004; Yusuf
& Schindehutte, 2000). In these studies, job loss is a measurable explanatory factor
effecting new venture formation. However, there is typically no connection made at
the individual level between job loss and any corresponding psychological depres-
sion; that is presumably left to the ﬁeld of psychology. Anecdotally, it is a shock
when one loses one’s employment and it is not a stretch to make such a DEMO
However, a link between artistic creativity to psychological depression and other
DEMO disorders has indeed been established (Akinola & Mendes, 2008). Does
artistic creativity follow the same processes as entrepreneurial creativity? Or are
these distinct types with processes carried out in separate areas of the brain?DEMO
Akinola and Mendes (2008) carried out an experimental study of affective
vulnerability comparing baseline and post-treatment measures of levels of an
adrenal steroid, DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) that has been linked
to depression. They found DEMO highest levels of artistic creativity in participants
that presented with the lowest baseline levels of DHEAS. It would be interesting
332 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
to undergo a similar study comparing DEMO creativity under varying
conditions linked with depression. Perhaps even short periods of intensive nega-
tive emotions resulting from depression can result in great bursts DEMO entrepreneurial
creativity. Correspondingly, could there be any portion of increased entrepreneurial
DEMO that might be explained by psychological depression or, like artists, the
entrepreneurs’ coping mechanism?
Current Thinking about Entrepreneurial Intentions
If we care DEMO how entrepreneurs emerge, then it cannot be too surprising to see
DEMO extent of interest in critical preconditions that facilitate or inhibit this emergence
(Davidsson, 1991; Krueger, 1993, 2000; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006; McMullen
et al., 2007; Levie & Autio, 2008; Shapero, DEMO, 1985). Entrepreneurship scholars
once used terms such as “budding entrepreneurs” DEMO adoption of the more spe-
ciﬁc term, “intentions” had added focus (and thus more rigor) to this fascinating
research area. In return, DEMO is an arena where entrepreneurs can perhaps “give
back” fruitfully to other disciplines. For example, it is increasingly evident that
simplistic modeling may yield a sizable r-squared but are we really understanding
causation?
Is it DEMO reasonable to consider that critical entrepreneurial behaviors are at least
partly voluntary? Philosophers (we recommend Bratman, 1987) argue persuasively
that intentions are DEMO to voluntary human behavior. Indeed, psychologists and
philosophers alike deﬁne “intention” DEMO a cognitive state temporally and causally
prior to the target behavior. That is, intent is the cognitive state immediately prior
to the decision to act. Empirically, intentions are consistently the single best predic-
tor of subsequent behavior (even if the predictive power is underwhelming.) Why?
Conventional DEMO says that any planned behavior is intentional. Essentially, if
a behavior DEMO not result from stimulus-response, it is intentional. Or is it? It is
certainly not that simple.
When is “intent” intent? Consider the classic work of Benjamin Libet et al.
(1983) where experimenters can often DEMO human intent in advance, suggest-
ing a neurological antecedent to intent DEMO behavior. In turn, that opens the door
for us to ask DEMO new questions as well as shedding light on some older ones
(DEMO as the antecedents of entrepreneurial intent.) After wiring up the subjects DEMO
experimenter asks them to raise either hand. Before subjects are aware of it them-
selves the experimenter can quickly discern which hand each subject DEMO raise.
Next, the experimenter induces the subject to raise either the DEMO or right hand. The
subject perceives the completely induced choice as free will. A neuroscientist can
see our intentions before we perceive we have DEMO them. The implication: we
may perceive intent toward a discrete behavior DEMO where it is completely illusory.
What does this mean for our models and measures of entrepreneurial intentions
that we have carefully developed from proven DEMO and reﬁned through rigor-
ous empirical analysis? What does this say DEMO all our other carefully considered
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 333
cognitive phenomena in entrepreneurship? It DEMO us to be cautious in our methods
and rigorous in our theories but it also tells us of the great potential for future
research.
DEMO we are interested in studying new ventures, then we need to DEMO the
processes that lead up to their initiation. From a cognition perspective, that entails a
better understanding of the intent to initiate entrepreneurial activity and the reasons
driving them (Shaver, 2007). Psychologists have long DEMO intentions to be highly
useful in understanding behavior. Also, an increased DEMO on intentions pushes
researchers away from more retrospective research designs toward more prospec-
tive designs. It allows a greater emphasis on predicting versus explaining. DEMO,
it is not entirely clear that is what we are seeing empirically.
We seem to be blessed with theoretically sound, empirically robust formal mod-
els of human intentions toward a target behavior that appear to DEMO on highly
similar sets of critical antecedents to intentions (e.g., Bagozzi and Warshaw, 1990).
The breadth and depth of research on entrepreneurial intentions is well-documented
elsewhere (e.g., Gregoire et al., 2009; Krueger, 2009b) but let us concisely recap its
evolution.
Theory of Reasoned Action, Theory of Planned Behavior,
and Shapero’s Model of the Entrepreneurial Event
Ajzen and Fishbein’s Theory of Reasoned Action and Ajzen’s Theory of Planned
DEMO (TPB) surfaced as the dominant class of intentions while, interestingly, the
domain of entrepreneurship already provided a model quite similar to TPB DEMO
ing Ajzen’s TPB by several years., Shapero (1975, 1982) proposed the following, the
“entrepreneurial event” (initiating entrepreneurial behavior) depends on the pres-
ence of a salient, personally credible opportunity. Homologous to Azjen, DEMO credible
opportunity depends on two critical antecedents: perceptions of desirability (both
personal and social) and perceptions of feasibility plus the useful concept of the
“precipitating event,” something that would “displace” the decision maker from DEMO
inertia of existing behavior and drive the decision-maker to reconsider her/his oppor-
tunity set which might now have entrepreneurship as a salient and DEMO credible
personal opportunity.
First tested in the entrepreneurship domain was Shapero’s model where it found
considerable support (Krueger, 1993a). Subsequently, Krueger and Carsrud (1993)
proposed consideration of Ajzen’s TPB (Carsrud & Krueger, 1996). Others, espe-
cially Kolvereid (1996; Iakovleva & Kolvereid, DEMO), have found great success
in adapting TPB to entrepreneurial samples. This ultimately spawned a compara-
tive test of TPB and SEE, ﬁnding support for both models (Krueger et al., 2000).
Post hoc analysis DEMO that the optimal model would include propensity to act
from SEE and social norms from TPB (see Fig. 13.3). Both Ajzen and Shapero pro-
vide us a theory-driven and empirically robust model at the surface DEMO (Simon’s
“semantic” level). However, theory and methods from cognition research offer us
the opportunity to dig deeper into the underlying cognitive structures (Simon’s
“symbolic” level).
334 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
Fig. 13.3 Intentions model (Krueger, DEMO; Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; Krueger et al., 2000;
Shapero, 1982)
If the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship has now experienced a “boom market” in
entrepreneurial intentions, in some cases, research has ignored much DEMO the key
literature (and some have ignored almost all of it)DEMO However, it does appear that the
strengths of the formal intentions DEMO have led scholars to use it with great con-
ﬁdence and perhaps too little critical thinking. As Libet’s ﬁndings show, chinks in
the model’s armor are growing.
Disadvantages of Intentions Models
First, intentions can change, DEMO for relatively distal or complex behaviors.
As such, the intent to DEMO a business is far from persistent. However, this generates
a golden DEMO for researchers to study the changes in entrepreneurial inten-
tions. Changing intentions is relatively unexplored in any domain; the entrepreneur-
ship domain should prove especially useful in explicating the underpinnings of
changing intentions.
Direction of Causality? Next, there is still debate over the direction of causal-
ity. In particular, intentions can be seen as simply another attitude, just more DEMO
Robinson et al. (1991) argued for Allport’s (1935) approach where behavior depends
on a troika of critical attitudes: Affective, cognitive, and conative [intent], even
developing a much-underused measure of entrepreneurial attitudes.
More recently, work by Brännback et al. (2006) and Krueger and Kickul (DEMO)
both stumbled across an unusual ﬁnding. While perceived desirability and perceived
feasibility were signiﬁcant antecedents of intentions, as expected, a rudimentary test
DEMO that desirability and intent also clearly predicted feasibility and that feasibility
and intent clearly predicted desirability – almost equally. In fact, the Brännback
et al.’s (2007) data seems to suggest that feasibility may prove – DEMO – to be
the dependent variable.
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 335
Dynamic Process, Static Snapshot? What if the intentions model as a dynamic
formulation exhibits feedback loops? If we can convert the intentions model into
a model of changing intentions, we can readily present strong theory for inten-
tions inﬂuencing its “predictors.” DEMO, we know relatively little about the temporal
dimension, thus we can explore intentions toward when a prospective entrepreneur
might undertake an intended venture DEMO the enactment of temporal issues
(Bird, 1992; Fischer et al., 1997; West & Meyer, 1997).
Dynamic Modeling of Intent: Implementation Intentions
Gollwitzer (Gollwitzer & Brandstatter, 1997; Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) and
others have gone beyond intentions toward a goal and investigated intentions DEMO
implementation. Strong intentions toward implementing an intended strategy may
play a more signiﬁcant role than we might think and often entail different dynamics
than DEMO toward the goal per se. That is, goal intent is not DEMO; a strong
intent to implement may well represent a very different DEMO of mental models much
as Bratman (1987) argued that intent is not really a genuine intention without a
signiﬁcant level of commitment to DEMO intended goal or behavior. Little research
has looked explicitly at implementation intentions in entrepreneurial settings,
although studies are currently underway (see Elfving et al., 2009, for supportive
initial evidence).
Dynamic Modeling of Intent: Bagozzi’s Theory of Trying
Figure 13.4 depicts one highly promising vehicle for DEMO these speciﬁc
dynamics in Bagozzi’s Theory of Trying (ToT; Bagozzi & Warshaw, 1990; Bagozzi
et al., 2003; Dholakia & Bagozzi, 2002). The parsimony (and seeming explana-
tory robustness) of the Theory DEMO Planned Behavior allowed TPB to predominate
intentions research. However, Ajzen’s model DEMO that the target behavior be
under volitional control. That is, it DEMO no particular barrier thus it does not
actually lend it itself to addressing intentions toward a goal (under partial volitional
control; simply put, something that requires trying to achieve). Moreover, part of
the complexity of using ToT lies in explicit consideration of emotional reasoning.
“Hot” cognitions DEMO, however, necessary to consider in dynamic models of human
cognition (DEMO 13.4).
Consider Bagozzi’s most recent version, his theory of effortful DEMO
(Bagozzi et al., 2003)inFig. 13.4. Note that this variation on the Theory of Trying
explicitly includes two phases of the decision process, goal intent, and implemen-
tation intent. But also note that rather than taking a simple snapshot of attitudes
relating to the intent, the model explicitly considers the cognitive and emotive
appraisal processes that we observe in DEMO signiﬁcant human decision-making.
336 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
Fig. 13.4 Theory of effortful decision DEMO (Bagozzi et al., 2003; Carsrud & Brännback, 2009)
In this case, we know that entrepreneurs engage in such appraisal and this has
become an important research area of its own (e.g., Michl DEMO al., 2009).
To put another way, the Theory of Trying captures that the process of how
entrepreneurial intentions evolve entails hot cognitions DEMO just cold cognition. Note
the following experiment where serial entrepreneurs are compared to successful
managers by Cambridge University’s neuroscience experts in Barbara Sahakian’s
lab (Lawrence et al., 2008). On tests of pure “cold” cognition, DEMO did not differ, but
on “hot” cognitions (where emotions are closely engaged in decisions) the success-
ful entrepreneurs clearly outperformed the managers. Successful entrepreneurial
thinking appears to require expert management of both rational and emotional DEMO
soning. Not terribly surprising to most entrepreneurs, but these insights surfaced
DEMO faster because Sahakian’s team had an advantage in theory and methodology.
Please note that this was good neuroscience but there was no need for DEMO
tools like the fMRI, only good theory and skillful experimentation. Of DEMO, as
we get better at using neuroscience, we will ﬁnd the use of tools such as MRI,
fMRI, etc., to be DEMO What is important is to see that “neuro-entrepreneurship”
is ready to join neuroeconomics, neuromarketing, neuroﬁnance (and even neu-
roethics) as a productive DEMO of study (Stanton et al., 2008, Krueger & Day,
DEMO).
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 337
Possible Evidence for Phase Changes?
If effortful decision-making changes qualitatively as intentions emerge, evolve, and
coalesce DEMO commitment and action, then it seems very likely that the intentional
DEMO changes qualitatively across the process. For a simple example, consider
nascent DEMO (i.e., those farther along than merely potential but not yet fully
launched). Their launch is underway, but not yet completed, so DEMO are still facing
numerous complex decisions about future intentional behaviors. Of course, even
a long-established entrepreneur faces many complex decisions but entrepreneurial
nascency may impose a somewhat more structured set of issues. Research based on
the DEMO data sets from the Panel Studies of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) is
well underway and one must suspect that we will ﬁnd some intriguing DEMO – and
not a few surprises. We will revisit this issue in the section below on entrepreneurial
deep beliefs.
Passion, Affect, and Emotions
DEMO it possible to discuss entrepreneurs without discussing entrepreneurial passion
(Cardon et DEMO, 2009)? Whether scholar, educator, or public stereotype, we associate
entrepreneurial activity with highly salient emotional engagement (and commit-
ment?). DEMO (and rational) cognitive appraisal in entrepreneurs is another
research area of immense promise (we recommend insights from Isabelle Welpe
and colleagues, e.g., Michl et al., 2009). Any discussion of entrepreneurial think-
ing, DEMO entrepreneurial intentions, requires careful, rigorous attention to the
important aspects of how our decision-making is thoroughly intertwined with ratio-
nal and emotional appraisal. DEMO to this, Baron (2008) recently mapped the
remarkable breadth and DEMO of research issues touching upon entrepreneurial
affect.
To study “hot” cognition in entrepreneurs requires careful experimental design
(Krueger & Welpe, 2007) but that is already proving invaluable, especially in set-
tings that unavoidably engage strong emotion such as failure (Shepherd et al., 2009)
or fear DEMO failure (Klaukien & Patzelt, 2009). Preliminary evidence suggests that
leadership’s management of subordinate affect has a direct effect on entrepreneurial
creativity (e.g., Kollman & Lomberg, 2009). Other recent experimental research
has looked DEMO differentiating how potential entrepreneurs appraise opportunities
rationally and emotionally (Krueger & DEMO, 2008; Krueger et al., 2009). That
is, the cognitive and emotional appraisal of opportunity identiﬁcation, evaluation,
and exploitation differs for the social dimension of an intended opportunity from
the appraisal of the DEMO dimension. The economic dimension appears to
engage primarily rational (“cold”) cognition while appraisal of the social dimen-
sion appears to engage both (“hot” cognition) which is useful in understanding the
role of entrepreneurial passion (DEMO et al., 2009). The next step will be to begin
DEMO more deeply into the key beliefs that anchor appraisal.
338 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
Non-Compensatory Decision-Making in Evoked Opportunity Sets
DEMO are anchoring beliefs important? Important human decisions are inherently
complex. In DEMO compensatory decision-making, there are always tradeoffs, but in
non-compensatory (or DEMO) decisions, there will be non-negotiable deci-
sion criteria. Human decisions that involve multiple criteria almost always include
at least one non-compensatory attribute (which neuromarketing argues is often
far from obvious). Recent work by Krueger, Kickul, Gundry, and Verma (2006)
examined the key attributes of intended ventures and found clear evidence for inten-
tions reﬂecting signiﬁcant lexicographic (non-compensatory) preferences. If human
decision-making – such as decisions relating to the intent toward launching a ven-
ture – is a mix of compensatory DEMO non-compensatory decision criteria, our linear
additive models may leave much useful DEMO unaddressed.
Self-Efﬁcacy Beliefs: Critical Correlate of Intent
If underneath the intentionality DEMO opportunity (and thus entrepreneurial) emer-
gence are critical antecedents, it DEMO critical to explore the sources of those
antecedents. While we have already addressed the role of experience-driven percep-
tions, let us delve deeper into one speciﬁc antecedent, perceived feasibility, and the
belief structure that drives DEMO: Bandura’s construct of self-efﬁcacy.
One powerful attitude that drives human decision-making DEMO our sense of com-
petence, our belief that we can execute DEMO target behavior (Bandura, 1986, 1995).
Bandura would argue that DEMO changes in self-efﬁcacy reﬂect cognitive change
at a very deep level. Self-efﬁcacy is best inﬂuenced by direct mastery experiences,
however, vicarious learning (DEMO, behavioral modeling) is also well-documented.
Since Bandura proposed self-efﬁcacy theory over 20 years ago, its research litera-
ture has become broad and deep. Of late, entrepreneurship research has increasingly
taken advantage of self-efﬁcacy theory (DEMO et al., 2009).
While Bandura’s description of the self-efﬁcacious individual (optimistically
persistent) sounds as though he is referring to entrepreneurs, the DEMO inkling of
self-efﬁcacy’s importance came from Robert Scherer and his associates (DEMO)who
found that parents’ impact on their children’s entrepreneurial attitudes depended
on whether they inﬂuenced their children’s sense of entrepreneurial competence
(see also Neergaard’s work in Section “Deep Beliefs and Knowledge Structures”
below.) Alan Carsrud and colleagues (1987) came to similar conclusions about role
models and mentors, suggesting that changing critical attitudes such as self-efﬁcacy
perceptions is an important DEMO in promoting entrepreneurial thinking.
Key Conceptual Work: Even earlier, Shapero (DEMO, 1982) discussed the cen-
trality of perceived feasibility in judging that a potential opportunity is personally
credible, though without using the term self-efﬁcacy. This led to operationalizing
Shapero’s model of the entrepreneurial event with self-efﬁcacy DEMO the key antecedent
of perceived feasibility (Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; DEMO et al., 2000).
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 339
While interest was slow to increase in using self-efﬁcacy in entrepreneur-
ship (Krueger, 1989), Brown (1996) proposed a look at self-efﬁcacy regarding
resource acquisition, marshaling resources being DEMO crucial element in success-
ful entrepreneurship. This narrower domain illustrates the need to focus on the
critical dimensions of entrepreneurial competencies. While Brown focused DEMO a
speciﬁc dimension, Alex DeNoble et al. (1999) developed a DEMO to tap multiple
entrepreneurial competencies while Chen et al.’s (1998) measure is broader still.
Although Bandura considers self-efﬁcacy as being task-speciﬁc, measures of gen-
eral (not task-speciﬁc) self-efﬁcacy have been proposed and validated, and Robert
Baron argues that this broadest conception of entrepreneurial competency should
also DEMO useful. This suggests the value of a validity study that rigorously compares
the existing measures (Kickul & D’Intino, 2005).
Key Early Empirical DEMO: While self-efﬁcacy was originally conceived as
a Person X Situation variable, some scholars have explored self-efﬁcacy as a per-
son variable. Although the DEMO self-efﬁcacy was not used, an interesting study by
Chandler and Jansen (1992) developed and tested a measure of perceived compe-
tence to great success: Entrepreneurs do perceive themselves as highly competent.
More recently, Baron DEMO that entrepreneurs score higher on a measure of general
self-efﬁcacy. Gatewood and colleagues (2002) explored links between perceived
ability and expectancies. These latter DEMO studies reinforce the potency of self-
efﬁcacy as a useful construct in this domain, but they also suggest that we need
to be careful that the theoretical basis for research is aligned with the empirical
methods DEMO we employ.
Work by Scherer, Shapero, and others led to a major experimental study that
directly tested the impact of self-efﬁcacy on opportunity DEMO threat perceptions and
on risk taking (Krueger, 1989; Krueger & DEMO, 1994). This study found that
self-efﬁcacy signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced opportunity and DEMO perceptions. In turn,
opportunity and threat perceptions inﬂuenced risk taking in two different tasks.
More important, the ﬁndings show that the impact of self-efﬁcacy was task-speciﬁc;
that is, despite the two tasks being highly similar, self-efﬁcacy on one task did not
inﬂuence self-efﬁcacy on the other.
Measurement is important and challenges remain in measuring entrepreneurial
self-efﬁcacy. Chen and DEMO (1998) developed a self-efﬁcacy instrument
that attempts to capture the key dimensions of entrepreneurial competency.
DeNoble et al. (1999) developed an instrument DEMO captures a narrower notion of
entrepreneurial competency with less focus on managerial tasks. Both instruments
appear psychometrically sound and demonstrate considerable validity. Similarly,
DEMO in entrepreneurship classes demonstrate small, but signiﬁcant positive
changes in entrepreneurial DEMO even over a semester (e.g., Krueger, 2001).
Future Directions DEMO Entrepreneurial Self-Efﬁcacy Research: Considerable
work remains ahead in developing (and deploying) more reﬁned self-efﬁcacy mea-
sures. Brown’s example of developing a reliable, DEMO measure of a more speciﬁc
competency ﬁts well with the conception of self-efﬁcacy as task-speciﬁc; other com-
petencies are worthy of similar analysis. We also need to assess the relative impact
of more task-speciﬁc measures and DEMO general self-efﬁcacy.
340 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
We should also test the relationship DEMO levels and changes in self-efﬁcacy
with deeper cognitive structures. If Bandura is correct, major shifts in self-efﬁcacy
should be associated with signiﬁcant change in scripts and maps [see next section].
For example, is a high level of self-efﬁcacy at opportunity recognition associ-
ated with evidence of an expert DEMO for opportunity recognition? In many ways,
the entrepreneurship domain should DEMO ideal for testing these as yet untested
relationships.
However, the two DEMO promising trajectories for entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy
research are relatively new. Helle Neergaard and colleagues (Mauer et al., 2009)
has turned the table and DEMO self-efﬁcacy as a consequence (entrepreneurial
self-efﬁcacy as dependent variable, not independent). From whence do self-efﬁcacy
beliefs arise? How do they develop cognitively? For example, how do youthful
experiences affect self-efﬁcacy perceptions whether playing DEMO or even fairy
tales?
The other key direction derives from the realization that self-efﬁcacy is likely
intertwined with other control beliefs. Monsen and DEMO (2009) have combined
self-efﬁcacy and locus of control into a very promising model of mixed control
beliefs that has signiﬁcant implications for other DEMO phenomena, including
entrepreneurial intentions.
Deep Beliefs and Knowledge Structures
Most human DEMO occurs via automatic processing. Oversimplifying a
bit, we possess a large DEMO of if-then rules to guide our behavior. Many decisions
simply derive from a relatively limited set of decision rules based on an equally lim-
DEMO set of very deep anchoring assumptions. Only relatively few human decisions
are processing mindfully and even there we might ﬁnd these deep assumptions still
DEMO play.
As such it becomes very important to understand as best we can what deep
assumptions lie beneath our intentions (Krueger, 2007). DEMO, these assump-
tions also represent the critical architecture of how we DEMO our knowledge
(including our cognitive scripts, schemas, and maps). DEMO certainly seems to be the
next frontier in entrepreneurial intentions research, DEMO not entrepreneurial cognition
in general, and we urge the reader to DEMO signiﬁcant thought to these issues.
If critical attitudes such as self-efﬁcacy lie beneath intentions, what lies beneath
those attitudes? In Simon’s terms, we move now from the “semantic” level of
knowledge representation to the “symbolic” DEMO and explore how these levels
interact.
Cognitive science has long shown how attitudes and beliefs expressed on the
surface also reﬂect their genesis in DEMO structures of how we represent knowledge
and how knowledge is interrelated. That is, knowledge does not exist just as discrete
“data” but knowledge is interconnected. Think of it as a relational database where
data entries include DEMO each datum is linked to other data. Again, this suggests
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 341
that skillful application of theory and methods relating to pattern recognition could
prove extremely illuminating.
It is critical DEMO understand how all these cognitive phenomena are interconnected.
Bird (1992) argued early on that entrepreneurs’ intentions are driven by deeper
structures such as DEMO More important, though, is that this under-researched
arena could prove immensely fruitful, not just for research but also for enhancing
our ability to stimulate entrepreneurial thinking at a very deep level. It might, for
example, allow us additional tools to compare different types of entrepreneurs (e.g.,DEMO
Westhead et al., 2005).
This is much more than metaphor. DEMO deeper structures are powerful inﬂu-
ences on how we think. If we are to enhance entrepreneurial thinking beyond a
superﬁcial level, we need to help entrepreneurs change these deeper structures in
appropriate directions.
Automatic versus Intentional DEMO
Deep beliefs come into play unobtrusively whenever we gain sufﬁcient experience
such that a once mindful process evolves into an automatic process. While we
DEMO often exhibit intentional, planned behavior, much of our decision-making oper-
ates via automatic processing, driven by deep assumptions of which we are likely
unaware. This is highly adaptive in that we cannot consciously process every DEMO
decision we face. If we have automated how to drive out of a skid on an icy road, that
is good. If our deep assumption is an ugly racial prejudice, that is very bad. What
may seem purely instinctive is often completely learned. Understanding the deep
“why” of DEMO decision-making is imperative. Cognitive mechanisms worth consid-
ering here include mental prototyping, schemata (and schemas), scripts, and maps.
Since we operate under signiﬁcant bounded rationality, there are many gaps that
our minds readily ﬁll – often based on very deeply seated assumptions. Consider,
for example, role identity and related constructs such as perceived role demands.
Our mental DEMO of “opportunity” and of “entrepreneur” differ widely and are
almost certainly anchored by powerful deep assumptions (Krueger, 2007). Despite
the effort required DEMO surface these deep beliefs, it may be the only way to DEMO
understand these mental prototypes that are so important (e.g., Baron & Ensley,
2006). We all have mental prototypes (not just stereotypes per se) of “opportunity”
and of “entrepreneur.” If someone’s mental prototype of “entrepreneur” does not
include them, it will be much harder for them to become (let alone succeed at)
entrepreneurial (Baron, 2006; DEMO, 2007).
Schemata, Scripts, and Maps
This area has seen DEMO most development and the most fruitful results. Kets de Vries
(1996) has shown how deep beliefs about “how things work” and deeply seated
DEMO buttons” can have profound positive and especially negative (1996) effects
342 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
on entrepreneurial behavior which can be DEMO as more entrepreneurial
schemata (e.g., Alvarez & Barney, 2008).
DEMO scripts, the work of Ron Mitchell and associates has been highly DEMO,
even outside the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship (e.g., Mitchell, 2005; Mitchell et al.,
2000, 2009). The key trigger for this whole approach has been the realization that
experts think differently than novices. DEMO experts become experts is reﬂected in
the development of an “expert” script. (A script is, as its name suggests, a cognitive
mechanism that comprises the key elements in a decision situation and the likely
ordering DEMO events.)
The “expert” script can differ from the “novice” script in any number of ways:
It can be more complex but can DEMO more parsimonious. In most cases, the knowl-
edge involved will differ (the obvious case being that experts will typically have
more accurate information)DEMO We cannot readily identify a script directly, but we can
recognize DEMO degree to which an expert (or novice) script is present. We do so
by identifying critical cues that signal expertise (e.g., Mitchell & Chesteen, 1995;
Mitchell et al., 2000).
Mitchell’s original work focused primarily on differences between expert and
novice scripts regarding entrepreneurship writ DEMO (1995). However, he and his
colleagues have continued by identifying expert scripts for subprocesses such as
expert scripts for marshaling resources or DEMO identifying opportunities (Gustavsson
et al., 2007) while others have extended DEMO approach to intriguing domains (Neck
et al., 2007; Welsh & DEMO, 2009). As we shall see in Section “Implications for
Entrepreneurial DEMO (and Education)”, this has powerful implications.
Connie Marie Gaglio and Jerome Katz (2001) approach the same topic of
entrepreneurial scripts but DEMO the perspective of seeking opportunity, to use
Kirzner’s (1982) term, entrepreneurial “alertness.” Understanding the overall expert
script is invaluable but drilling down DEMO more speciﬁc cognitive processes (e.g.,
counterfactual thinking) affords researchers a look at the most fundamental aspects
of entrepreneurial thinking. This too has DEMO implications for teaching and
training.
Cognitive maps have not been widely deployed in entrepreneurship research
until recently (Brännback & Carsrud, 2009). Jenkins DEMO Johnson (1997)cleverly
linked the cognitive maps of entrepreneurs to measures DEMO intention. Given the evi-
dence from Mitchell and his colleagues that entrepreneurial training can measurably
change an individual’s scripts toward those of an expert, so too should we see mea-
surable changes in an entrepreneur’s (nascent or otherwise) maps. We might also
ﬁnd it useful to see how maps and scripts relate to one another. Entrepreneurship
could prove an ideal DEMO for such research that would offer a contribution far
beyond entrepreneurship research.
Knowledge Structures Matter: Some Final Evidence
In recent years, we have DEMO new insights into how we learn to think
entrepreneurially. We have found constructs that fully moderate the intentions
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 343
model. Differences in cognitive style can yield dramatically different pathways in
the formation of intent. That is, the intentions model for learners who score as pre-
ferring intuitive thinking differs DEMO from the model for those scoring as
preferring an analytic cognitive style (Krueger & Kickul, 2006). “Another exam-
ple:” “Push” or DEMO entrepreneurs may differ from “opportunity” or “pull”
entrepreneurs. Might one expect that an entrepreneur pushed into self-employment
by necessity would focus ﬁrst on feasibility DEMO whereas an entrepreneur
“pulled” by an opportunity would consider desirability perceptions ﬁrst?
This implies explicit consideration of differing initial beliefs (e.g., cognitive
DEMO) among our students and, given the constructivist paradigm, implies encour-
DEMO a broad range of cognitive styles and other learning styles in our students. If
the differences in something as simple as cognitive style matters DEMO much, then
what are the implications for all the other ways DEMO students may differ cognitively?
One critical (and highly testable) implication is that learning processes can
change deep mental models in the direction DEMO better entrepreneurial thinking
whether in terms of learning to see more/better opportunities or to see oneself as
an entrepreneur (or as we have noted, both). Both Baron (2000b) and Gaglio (2004)
DEMO how the cognitive mechanism of counterfactual reasoning is a potent
lever for stimulating students to question their existing mental models. This clearly
suggests that DEMO of deep structures, whether scripts or maps or other possi-
bilities, can be usefully deployed to research how entrepreneurial thinking changes
as entrepreneurs DEMO to be entrepreneurial (and more expertly entrepreneurial) and
thus examine how deep beliefs change across a training program (Krueger, 2001;
Mitchell DEMO al., 2000).
Future Research Direction: Phase Changes Revisited
Cognitive developmental psychology has long noted that human psychosocial devel-
opment occurs in reasonably DEMO stages connected by transition periods that are
inherently experiential (Erikson, 1980). In children, it is the “terrible twos” that
demarcates infancy and early childhood. We see very different knowledge struc-
tures in these different DEMO; we also see consistent (and diagnostically useful)
phenomena that characterize transition. This affords us a good sense of some-
one’s psychosocial development DEMO how to help them navigate transitions. What
if entrepreneurial intentions evolve similarly, exhibiting phase changes?
If we plot intentions against a key attitude such as self-efﬁcacy, we tend to see
evidence that the optimal ﬁt is not linear. It may be that noise and measurement error
are DEMO unpredictably, but one can also make the case that we are DEMO
seeing one or two inﬂection points in the data that reﬂect a phase change in the
evolution of individuals’ entrepreneurial thinking.
That is, as entrepreneurial intentions evolve, they go through different stages. Just
as entrepreneurial ventures move from ideation to nascency to launch, might not
intentions follow a similar pattern, moving from one cognitive regime to another?
344 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
If so, we should see interesting cognitive differences between the regimes. How do
knowledge structures differ across the DEMO? What are the critical developmen-
tal experiences associated with each phase DEMO with each transition? For example,
Erikson (1980) would argue DEMO transitions would necessarily engage hot cog-
nitions. (Please see Fig. 13.5below.) Such evidence would also be of invaluable
diagnostic assistance to educators and DEMO practitioners.

Implications for Entrepreneurial Learning (and Education)
What do entrepreneurs need to learn? DEMO do they best learn that knowledge
and the necessary skills? It DEMO reasonable to note that entrepreneurs need to
learn how to identify opportunities. Most research into entrepreneurship educa-
tion has been descriptive, despite an increasing interest in theory-driven research
(much like research into opportunity recognition). This area cries out for extensive
theory-driven research.
What we are learning has DEMO potential implications for entrepreneurial
education (and in some ways we see DEMO practice in pedagogy that ﬁts the dynamic
model of intent even better than the static case.) The process of learning (and ideally
the DEMO of educating) does much more than add knowledge content to the DEMO
ers. The old behaviorist model of students as relatively passive vessels to be ﬁlled
with information has largely given way to the constructivist model DEMO assumes
that the real objective of education is to help learners to evolve how they structure
that knowledge. In short, train minds not memories.
However, it is equally important to recognize that while this process may increase
their attitudes and intentions toward entrepreneurship, we must also increase them
in productive directions. Inspiring an ill-informed student to launch a venture bor-
DEMO on the negligent. The goal, of course, is to move learners from a mindset that
is closer to a novice entrepreneur toward a DEMO more like that of an expert
entrepreneur with “informed intent” (Hindle & Klyver, 2009; Krueger et al., 2007).
Intent
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 345
“Filling a Pail” or “Lighting a Fire”?
Thereare two dominant paradigms in education. The traditional approach focuses DEMO
fact-based learning (includes rote memorization and repetitive drilling). Instructors
typically DEMO the models and framework for knowledge being transferred to
students. Constructivism argues for situated learning where students acquire knowl-
edge but also have to DEMO their own ways of organizing the knowledge (building
and changing their DEMO mental models to represent knowledge). “Learning the
answers” versus “ﬁnding the questions” is one way to think about the difference
or one might DEMO the words of W.B. Yeats paraphrased in the subhead above.
Entrepreneurship educators tend to fall into the second camp (Krueger, 2009a).
Traditional DEMO provide greater control to the instructor and can appear as
more efﬁcient for large groups of students. Constructivistic methods tend to be much
more DEMO, but this actually reﬂects how humans actually learn in daily
life: by trial and error in a social setting. Moreover, if one wishes to change deeper
cognitive structures such as scripts, then more student-centered learning is imper-
ative. For example, Albert Bandura’s Social Learning Theory suggests an iterative
process by which deeply held beliefs and attitudes co-evolve as learners DEMO
acquire, process, and organize new knowledge.
Thomas Monroy (1995) was perhaps ﬁrst to articulate that traditional classroom
methods were not only less DEMO used in entrepreneurship classes but probably
are less effective than more experiential approaches. Rather, expert entrepreneur-
ship educators tend to emphasize “problem-based learning” where learners focus on
real-world issues, a focus that is a staple of most entrepreneurship courses. Indeed,
the most popular and successful training techniques DEMO in entrepreneurship tend
to strongly reﬂect the constructivist model: Living cases (e.g., SBI), shadowing,
etc. (Jack & Anderson, 1999; DEMO, 2009a; Krueger & Hamilton, 1996). Even
when applied to DEMO behaviorist tasks like business plans, reﬂective, constructivist
approaches yield signiﬁcant improvement (e.g., Honig, 2004).
Organizations (and communities) seeking a more entrepreneurial climate require
more entrepreneurial thinking in its members (Krueger, 2000; Krueger & Brazeal,
1994). Classrooms are no different. As with DEMO, educators must seek
to develop a fertile seedbed that supports entrepreneurial DEMO This cogni-
tive infrastructure supports entrepreneurial thinking and the changes in cognitive
structures such as intentions and attitudes and even deeper cognitive structures
such DEMO students’ personal mental models of “what is an entrepreneur?” Am I an
entrepreneur?” But what inﬂuences change in such deep knowledge structures?DEMO
What changes those deep anchoring beliefs?
Critical Developmental Experiences
Prior experience certainly inﬂuences perception of future opportunities (Shane,
2000) but this DEMO at a much deeper cognitive level (Krueger, 2007, 2009b).
DEMO learners move from novice mindsets toward expert mindsets, some changes are
346 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
highly incremental, especially where knowledge content is involved. However, the
important changes involve knowledge structures where change is often more abrupt
(e.g., “aha!” moments).
The Center for Creative DEMO has found that top managers share a surpris-
ingly small set of critical developmental experiences [see Fig. 13.4] and an even
smaller set of DEMO lessons learned (McCall et al., 1988). We might proﬁtably reprise
that research for entrepreneurs. For example, we have some evidence that growing
up in a family business inﬂuences attitudes and intentions toward entrepreneur-
ship (Krueger, 1993b). Formal training/teaching can also matter as entrepreneurial
training programs signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the various antecedents of entrepreneurial
attitudes and intentions (Cooper & Lucas, 2007). Even formal coursework (Cox,
1996; Krueger, 2001) appears to have a small but measurable impact on critical
DEMO (e.g., self-efﬁcacy) and attitudes (including intent) (Fig. 13.6).

The issues surrounding how learning processes can DEMO deeply held men-
tal models in the direction of better entrepreneurial thinking, whether in terms of
learning to see more/better opportunities or to see oneself as an entrepreneur (or,
as we have noted, DEMO) represent powerful research opportunities that also bring
immediate practical impact. Consider DEMO the University of Victoria, Texas Tech,
Western Ontario and elsewhere DEMO developed pedagogies that heavily emphasize
helping students acquire expert scripts (e.g., Mitchell, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2000,
2009). This clearly suggests that measures of deep structures, whether scripts or
maps or other possibilities, can be usefully deployed to research how entrepreneurial
thinking changes across a training program (Krueger, 2001; Mitchell et al., 2000).
DEMO rule of thumb is that to become an expert requires 10,000–20,000 hours of
deliberate practice at activities which move one toward the DEMO mindset (Baron &
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 347
Henry, 2006; Ericsson & Charness, 1994). But what are those deep belief-changing
activities? For example, both Baron (2000b) and Gaglio (2001) demonstrate how the
cognitive DEMO of counterfactual reasoning is a potent lever for encouraging
and reinforcing students to question their existing mental models.
In short, we have ample reason to believe that if the expert mindset exists, then
we can use what we know about the expert mindset to guide our teaching (e.g.,
Krueger, 2009a; Mitchell, 2005) and move learners toward a DEMO informed intent.
But to do so we need to begin learning from neuroscience. The constructivist model
teaches us that learners, intentions and related attitudes will change but only inso-
far as they reﬂect changes in deep DEMO beliefs (Krueger, 2009a). To change
how we structure what we know, especially in the direction of a more informed
expert intent, DEMO learner goes through multiple critical developmental experiences
that change their deep beliefs. Imagine how much richer our efforts would be if
we embraced the DEMO approach. Consider the following evidence from
recent neuroscience efforts.
Cognitive Adaptability: DEMO and Adapting
Lawrence et al. (2008) “propose that entrepreneurs represent an example of highly
adaptive risk-taking behaviour, with positive functional outcomes in the con-
text of stressful economic decision-making.” Sarasvathy (2001) argues that the
DEMO should be put on center stage; that we “go beyond explanations DEMO
on economic forces and evolutionary adaptation to entrepreneurial effectuation.”
One particular area of interest that relates to the physiological drivers of adaptation
is that DEMO brain systems responsible for recognizing the familiar and negotiating the
unfamiliar have been identiﬁed. These have been termed by different researchers
“System 1 and DEMO 2” (Camerer et al., 2005; Kahneman, 2003) and the
DEMO and X-system” (Lieberman et al., 2002; Satpute & Lieberman, 2006). It
is probable that these systems are in play when it DEMO to adaptability. Put simply,
the X-system recognizes patterns and symbols via a type of passive parallel process-
ing, producing the continuous stream of consciousness we experience. When the
X-system is confronted by sensory data that DEMO does not recognize, it passes respon-
sibility over to the C-system DEMO uses a set of standards or rules that attempt to
harmonize this new data with what is already known.
Pattern Recognition and Transfer
These DEMO systems give insight into a complex thinking matrix and would seem
to represent the neural substrates underpinning for instance, analogical transfer
(Magee, 2005) or conceptual combination analysis (Ward, 2004) where information
and experiences, concepts, or images from what is known are used by the decision-
maker(s) in an attempt to ﬁnd a solution for a new, unfamiliar situation. Simon
348 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
(1997) writes “when the expert DEMO confronted with a situation in his or her domain,
various features of cues in the situation will attract attention” and the expert will DEMO
intuitively to come up with a solution. Simon argues that “[i]ntuition, DEMO,
creativity are basically expression of capabilities for recognition and response based
upon experience and knowledge.” Each entrepreneur may experience this to vary-
ing DEMO when confronted with, for example, a stressful economic decision-making
environment, DEMO in turn might trigger opportunity recognition.
For researchers, we need a DEMO empirical understanding of how
entrepreneurship-related cognitive phenomena are interrelated across Simon’s
(DEMO) three levels: Neurological, symbolic, and semantic. What “semantic”
level cues are associated with “symbolic” level structures underlying opportunity
perception? The rich cognitive science literature on pattern recognition could be
exploited most fruitfully to address DEMO
Context Matters: Entrepreneurial Environments
Even a solo entrepreneur does not operate DEMO a vacuum. As Granovetter famously
pointed out, almost all economic activity DEMO irretrievably embedded in its social
context, yet we often neglect the DEMO social context (e.g., Dimov, 2007,
Carsrud et al., 2007). Leo-Paul Dana has studied a dizzying array of economies
around the DEMO and ﬁnds that “opportunity” is very much culture-dependent
(1995). One DEMO impact is through the social norms antecedent of intentions
(and self-efﬁcacy), but social cues from community and family can also affect
other cognitive phenomena, often in non-obvious fashion. Han and Northoff (2008)
and DEMO show that cultural differences can manifest in signiﬁcant differences in
cognitive processes, even at an early age.
Family norms add another dimension to the cognitive appraisal in the intentions
process but may also bring other dimensions DEMO bold relief. This is an exciting
direction for family business research with broader implications for entrepreneur-
ship (e.g., Carsrud et al., 2007; DEMO, 1999). Likewise, high-tech opportunities
merit more consideration; how do DEMO processes differ in highly innovative organi-
zations (Brazeal, 1993; Corbett, 2002; Neck et al., 2007). However, the fundamental
question here that has seen far too little research efforts is this. If the DEMO
potential of an organization or a community is thus a function of the quantity
and quality of its potential entrepreneurs, then should we not explore what kinds
of environments support entrepreneurial activity by supporting and reinforcing
DEMO thinking (Day, 2002)? At the community level, there are DEMO dif-
ferences in communities that are entrepreneurial (e.g., Audretsch, 2007; Peredo &
Chrisman, 2004). What characterizes them?
Cognitive Infrastructure DEMO Organizations: The intentions perspective affords
us important insights into how to DEMO the entrepreneurial potential of an organi-
zation or a community. Again: DEMO potential depends on the quantity and
quality of potential entrepreneurs (Krueger & Brazeal, 1994). Increasing the quality
13 Looking Forward, Looking Backward 349
and quantity of potential entrepreneurs requires increasing the quality and quantity
of entrepreneurial thinking. Thus, the entrepreneurial organization must operate in
directions that support its members in perceiving more – DEMO better – opportunities,
such as beliefs and activities that foster internal entrepreneurs to see intrapreneur-
ship as desirable and feasible (Brazeal & Herbert, 1999). It is reasonable to assume
that modeling effects are critical – that the impact of mentors and role models serve
to enhance DEMO of modeling entrepreneurial behavior and attitudes (Krueger,
2000; Shepherd & Krueger, 2002).
The entrepreneurial organization does require a tangible infrastructure of
resources and mechanisms that support entrepreneurial activities, yet ﬁeld research
shows that this is clearly insufﬁcient to yield signiﬁcant levels of entrepreneurship.
Rather, organization members must perceive that tangible infrastructure as a sup-
portive one (Brazeal, 1993; Brazeal & Herbert, 2000; Brown & Wiklund 2001;
DEMO & Brazeal, 1994). It is not enough to provide the DEMO reward sys-
tem. What if organization members perceive the existing reward system as being
actually hostile to entrepreneurship? (Day, 2002; Shane & DEMO, 1995)
This implies that organizations (or, for that matter, communities) need to provide
and develop a “cognitive infrastructure” that nurtures entrepreneurial thinking. The
intentions perspective implies mechanisms that increase the quantity and quality
DEMO perceived opportunities. This then requires mechanisms that broaden the set of
possibilities that organization members perceive as feasible and as desirable and
suggests that DEMO seek to address each of the key antecedents: Personal
attitude, social norms, self-efﬁcacy, and collective efﬁcacy (Krueger, 2000). Section
“Implications DEMO Entrepreneurial Learning (and Education)” above argues we can
take these DEMO to design training programs and even coursework; Guth et al.,
DEMO how we can transform cognition research to successful practice (1991). DEMO
do we best train people to perceive themselves as entrepreneurial? How DEMO we best
train people to see personally credible opportunities?
The contextual perspective also offers two additional, important domains for
ground-breaking research. First, DEMO we better understand the “why” behind the
entrepreneurial mindset, we can DEMO understand the “how” of nurturing it (and
the accompanying policy implications)DEMO Second, initial evidence is persuasive that
studying social (and sustainable) DEMO provides broad, deep insights into
entrepreneurial thinking.
Cognitive Infrastructure in Communities: There is also immense potential
in digging deeper into this cognitive infrastructure DEMO entrepreneurship within
organizations and communities. This seems a most fruitful avenue for further study
as researchers can test the impact of various strategic prescriptions DEMO these key
antecedents. Does the presence of strong champions enhance perceptions of efﬁcacy
(e.g., modeling successful behavior) or enhance social norms (e.g., by demon-
strating that a community does support entrepreneurial activity)? We DEMO diagnose
shortfalls in entrepreneurial activity by testing these same antecedents. Similarly,
highly entrepreneurial communities seem to share a cognitive infrastructure that
rewards entrepreneurial DEMO and especially entrepreneurial thinking (Audretsch,
2007; Peredo & Chrisman, DEMO).
350 N.F. Krueger and M. Day
Social and Sustainable Entrepreneurship: While a topic far beyond the scope
of this chapter, these twin domains have grown immensely in recent years with
a corresponding proliferation of deﬁnitions – DEMO like entrepreneurship itself
in its early days (e.g., Bacq & Janssen, 2008). Nonetheless, social (and sus-
tainable) entrepreneurship offers multiple DEMO to enlighten us about the
entrepreneurial process writ large (Mair & DEMO, 2005). In particular, the cognitive
processes of social and sustainable entrepreneurs have already taught us much about
entrepreneurial opportunities (Krueger, 1998, 2005; Krueger et al., 2008;Welsh &
Krueger, 2009). DEMO is an ideal arena for exploring entrepreneurial thinking. In fact,
social entrepreneurship research may be dominated by inconsistent deﬁnitions and
dustball empiricism but DEMO is already teaching us much about how we identify and
evaluate opportunities (Krueger et al., 2008, 2009). Deep belief structures may be
in play here as well, providing additional potential for neuroscience methods.
In Conclusion
The suggestions offered above are just the beginning, but we look forward to the
ongoing adventure of answering those questions (and the questions those answers
will inevitably raise). However, if we are ever to truly understand entrepreneurship,
it is imperative that we understand the multifaceted DEMO of entrepreneurial think-
ing and of its genesis and there is much in past research that has been neglected in
the rapid growth of DEMO into entrepreneurial cognition.
The history of entrepreneurship research suggests that many surprises lie in store
for researchers. As we discussed above, we know relatively little about how inten-
tions change and even less about intentions about DEMO timing of behavior. More
important, we now know that we must DEMO ever deeper into “what lies beneath”
entrepreneurial phenomena. Given that entrepreneurial intentions change quite sig-
niﬁcantly over time, entrepreneurship might well prove ideal for exploring these
questions. Fortunately, the answers uncovered to date have, as DEMO happens in
science, also uncovered even more intriguing questions – and DEMO places to start
the next frontier. In this chapter, it has DEMO useful to point out questions with
great potential as we explored the disparate threads of entrepreneurial cognition.
We hope this chapter has helped the DEMO to see the potential for increasing our
skillful, rigorous use of DEMO and tools from cognitive science. We also hope that
readers also see that the even faster growth of research using theories and meth-
ods DEMO by neuroscience offers equally great potential for those of us intensely
curious about entrepreneurial thinking.
