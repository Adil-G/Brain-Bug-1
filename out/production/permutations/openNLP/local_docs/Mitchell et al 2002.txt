The failure of past “entrepreneurial personality”—based research to clearly distinguish the
DEMO contributions to the entrepreneurial process of entrepreneurs as people, has created
DEMO vacuum within the entrepreneurship literature that has been waiting to be ﬁlled. Recently,
the application of ideas and concepts from cognitive science has DEMO currency within
entrepreneurship research, as evidenced by the growing accumulation of DEMO
studies framed in entrepreneurial cognition terms. In this article we reexamine “the people
side of entrepreneurship” by summarizing the state of play within the DEMO
cognition research stream, and by integrating the ﬁve articles accepted for DEMO in
this special issue into this ongoing narrative. We believe that the constructs, variables, and
proposed relationships under development within the cognitive perspective DEMO research
concepts and techniques that are well suited to the analysis of problems that require better
explanations of the contributions to entrepreneurship that are DEMO human.
Introduction
Our task in this special issue on information processing and entrepreneurial cogni-
tion is to contribute to a multidisciplinary view of the DEMO (MacMillan & Katz,
1992) in an effort to synthesize and give insight into the function of this fundamental
worker in the job DEMO wealth creation. At present, there still does not appear to be DEMO satis-

factory answer to the question: Why are some people and not others able to discover and
exploit particular entrepreneurial opportunities?
It has been DEMO that two broad categories of factors inﬂuence the probability that
particular people will discover particular opportunities: 1) the possession of the infor-
mation DEMO to identify an opportunity, and 2) the cognitive properties necessary to
exploit it (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). According to these criteria, then, research that
contributes to a better understanding of information processing and entrepreneurial cog-
nition has an important role to play in the development DEMO the entrepreneurship literature.
But as noted in our call for submissions for this special issue, we also believe that studies
in entrepreneurship have not fully explored the possibilities that are offered by social
cognition, managerial cognition, or information processing theory. Accordingly, our
approach to fostering a multidisciplinary DEMO in this special issue has been to try to select
articles that effectively articulate the usefulness of these theories in explaining the func-
tion DEMO entrepreneurs as key persons in the entrepreneurial process.
We believe that the works published within this special issue reﬂect remarkable
progress in extending the DEMO of the entrepreneur’s role in new venture formation. And,
as often occurs in the earlier stages of the development of a research stream, we ﬁnd that
this progress has now deﬁned even more clearly the DEMO and breadth of a rather large
undertaking. For example, we observe DEMO the research accepted for publication in this
special issue may be broadly grouped into 1) those articles that deﬁne and build upon the
foundation of past entrepreneurship research, and 2) those articles that further delineate
DEMO outlines of the entrepreneurial cognition research horizon. And because the number
of accepted articles justiﬁes a two-volume series, we shall present them in these two
groupings.
In this ﬁrst volume of the special issue we report DEMO ﬁrst grouping: studies that deﬁne
and build upon the foundation of DEMO entrepreneurship research. Within the second
volume will appear the second grouping: DEMO that seek to expand the research horizon
and to help suggest a useful future research agenda for the entrepreneurial cognition
research domain. Accordingly, in this introduction to Volume 1, we turn ﬁrst to the
research foundation upon which rests our present understanding of the function of the
entrepreneur DEMO new venture formation.
The Entrepreneur and New Venture Formation
Within the multidisciplinary tradition of entrepreneurship research, theory that
attempts to explain the relationship between the entrepreneur and new venture formation
stems from several ﬁelds: economics, DEMO psychology, and strategy. Each of these
approaches makes its contribution, but each also has it shortcomings.
First, for example, economic theories of DEMO view the contribution of
the entrepreneur to be the creation of new enterprise (Low & MacMillan, 1988; Rumelt,
1987; Schumpeter, 1934), clearly establishing an outcome-based approach to under-
standing new venture formation. DEMO, the economics stream continues to be in need
of effective operationalization. DEMO example, articles advocating economic theories of
entrepreneurship often leave the empirical DEMO to future research (Baumol, 1993; Bull
& Willard, 1993). And while economic theories have been useful in helping to identify
what DEMO is and when it occurs, they have been less beneﬁcial in DEMO to
explain the more micro questions of how and why.
Second, DEMO the past 35 years, characteristics, or trait-based research (Coulton &
Udell, 1976; McClelland, 1965; McClelland, 1968) has attempted to DEMO the entre-
94
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
preneurial personality as the key component in new venture formation, giving needed
attention to the contributions of people themselves to the entrepreneurial process. But
DEMO to isolate psychological or demographic characteristics that are common to all
entrepreneurs, or are unique to entrepreneurs, have generally met with failure due DEMO
weak, disconﬁrming, or nonsigniﬁcant results. At this point in time researchers con-
tributing to the existing entrepreneurship literature have been unable to report DEMO unique
set of personality traits that characterize the entrepreneur (Brockhaus & DEMO, 1986;
Sexton & Bowman-Upton, 1991; Shaver, 1995).
Third, as an outgrowth of strategic management research, attention during the past DEMO
to 20 years has been focused on how the performance of the venture itself is inﬂuenced by
the entrepreneur. This stream of research may DEMO termed the new venture performance—
based approach, and has been very DEMO in linking and demarcating entrepreneurship
research relative to research in strategic management (Herron, 1990; Kunkel, 1991;
McDougall, 1987; Sandberg, 1986; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). However, until Herron
(1990) demonstrated that entrepreneurial skill and skill propensity are related to new
venture performance, the persistent attempts of researchers in the new venture performance
stream to DEMO the attributes of the entrepreneurial individual to performance (Cooper,
Willard, & Woo, 1986; MacMillan & Day, 1987; Sandberg, 1986) DEMO with little success.
Yet, despite these research challenges, practitioners and venture capitalists have con-
tinued to consider the individual who forms the venture DEMO be critical to its success (Hall
& Hofer, 1993; Herron, 1990; Sandberg, 1986; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Stuart &
DEMO, 1990). Thus, actual practice within the entrepreneurship community has differed
from much of the research reported to date, and therefore, new DEMO that explain
the contribution of the entrepreneur to new venture formation continue to be needed.
Enter Entrepreneurial Cognitions
The cognitive perspective provides us with DEMO useful lenses with which to explore
entrepreneur-related phenomena and to address some of the meaningful issues that to this
point we have been largely DEMO in probing. As previously noted, despite researchers’
disillusionment with the trait DEMO in entrepreneurship that began in the 1980s
and continued throughout much of the 90s, the fundamental idea that entrepreneurs are
members of a homogeneous group that is somehow unique, has not gone away. Entre-
preneurs themselves, writers in the popular press, as well as those who have DEMO with
entrepreneurs, persistently ignore the recent ﬁndings that disconﬁrm the trait DEMO and
continue to openly assume and act upon the idea that there exists entrepreneurial unique-
ness among individuals. And in our observation, until the cognition view emerged, it was
somewhat ironic that entrepreneurship researchers could not clearly identify systematic
(theoretical) reasons for the uniqueness of entrepreneurs, while those who where immersed
within the entrepreneurship world knew that these people DEMO somehow distinct.
The assertions of the cognitive view of entrepreneurship represent a refreshing
change: the articulation of a theoretically rigorous and empirically testable approach that
does systematically explain the role of the individual in the entrepreneurial DEMO Based
upon the research that we have reviewed in preparing this special issue, we are pleased
to report that the cognitive viewpoint may be seen to serve well as an effective tool in
probing and explaining DEMO previously unexplained phenomena within the entrepre-
neurship research domain.
The research reported in this special issue is therefore set within the context of past
DEMO cognition research, which has examined both problematic and positive
Winter, 2002
95
aspects of entrepreneurial cognitions. For example, some of the problematic conse-
quences of entrepreneurial cognitions have been argued to occur in entrepreneurial
environments characterized DEMO information overload, high uncertainty or novelty,
strong emotions, time pressure, and fatigue. These include counterfactual thinking,
affect infusion, self-serving bias, planning fallacy, and self justiﬁcation (Baron, 1998);
overconﬁdence or DEMO errors (Busenitz & Barney, 1997); and overconﬁ-
dence, illusion DEMO control, and misguided belief in the law of small numbers (Simon,
Houghton, & Aquino, 2000). Some of the positive consequences DEMO making the
venture creation decision using cognitive mechanisms, such as expert DEMO (Mitchell
et al., 2000).
Speciﬁcally, then, the entrepreneurial cognitions view offers to help us understand
how entrepreneurs think and “why” they DEMO some of the things they do, and in doing so,
DEMO provide a theoretically rigorous and testable argument for such distinctiveness. Stated
differently, when one is interested in entrepreneurship-related phenomena, it now appears
to DEMO essential for researchers to credibly account for the role of the individual entrepre-
neur; and the cognitive view provides some of the necessary research machinery to do
so. We therefore see entrepreneurial research with a cognitive DEMO to be on the
rise today, not because of some prior DEMO, but because there remains a huge
void waiting to be ﬁlled DEMO an extension of the multidisciplinary tradition in entre-
preneurship research—utilizing the relevant tools from cognition-related disciplines
(MacMillan & Katz, 1992)—can address.
Deﬁnitions DEMO Entrepreneurial Cognition Research
Given relatively recent scholarly forays into understanding how entrepreneurs think
and make decisions, there is a need for deﬁnitional development along with some dis-
cussion of relevant assumptions. In this volume of the DEMO issue, we seek to deﬁne
the term “entrepreneurial cognitions.” To arrive DEMO the combined meaning of these two
words, we consider the domain DEMO each term separately.
Entrepreneurial. One way of conceptualizing entrepreneurship is to consider it to be an
intersection or nexus of individuals or teams, opportunity, and modes of organizing
(Busenitz et al., 2003). Entrepreneurship can be viewed in its essence to be individuals
or teams, creating works, such as products and services, for other persons in a market-
DEMO (Mitchell, 2002, pp. 179, 182). In other words, DEMO is about individ-
uals who create opportunities where others do not, DEMO who attempt to exploit those
opportunities through various modes of organizing, DEMO regard to resources currently
controlled (Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990).
Cognitions. Cognition and cognitive psychology concern themselves with the study of
individual perceptions, memory, and thinking (Estes, 1975). Cognitions have been
deﬁned as all processes by which sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated,
DEMO, recovered, and used (Neisser, 1967). As psychology scholars began to recognize
the limitations of the earlier behaviorist approach (Skinner, 1953; Watson, 1924), cogni-
tive psychology emerged to help explain the mental processes that occur within in-
dividuals as they interact with other people DEMO the environment around them. The
development of social cognition theory followed to speciﬁcally manage this subcategory
of problems: those that require an explanation of individual behavior as it is shaped by
96 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
the person-environment interaction. Social cognition theory considers that individuals
exist within a DEMO situation or conﬁguration of forces described by two pairs of factors:
one being cognition and motivation, and the other being the person in the situation
(emphasis in original) (Fiske & Taylor, 1984, pp. 4–5). Social cognition theory, for
example, introduces the idea of DEMO structures: mental models (cognitions) that
are ordered in such a DEMO as to optimize personal effectiveness within given situations.
Thus, where entrepreneurship DEMO of individuals and teams creating works for other
persons within a market environment, the concepts developed in cognitive psychology
are increasingly being found to be useful tools to help probe entrepreneurial-related
phenomena.
Entrepreneurial Cognitions. Our deﬁnition DEMO entrepreneurial cognitions builds from
the previous research noted above. We deﬁne entrepreneurial cognitions as follows: entre-
preneurial cognitions are the knowledge structures that people use to make assessments,
judgments, or decisions involving opportunity evaluation, DEMO creation, and growth.
In other words, research in entrepreneurial cognition is about understanding how entre-
preneurs use simplifying mental models to piece together DEMO unconnected infor-
mation that helps them to identify and invent new products or services, and to assemble
the necessary resources to start and grow businesses. We offer this deﬁnition as a useful
beginning point for further DEMO in this ﬁeld because it incorporates thinking and per-
ception issues developed by cognitive psychologists, while comprehending the domain
of entrepreneurship research.
The Present Context
The development of entrepreneurial cognition research has a relatively short history.
DEMO it is nevertheless within this context that the articles of this ﬁrst special issue volume
are set. In this section of our article we DEMO summarize—from our nonexhaustive
vantage point, we hasten to add—the present context DEMO we see it. In the subsequent
section, we then introduce the DEMO in Volume 1.
It was in the early to mid-1990s that the terms entrepreneurs’ cognitions (Bird, 1992)
and entrepreneurial cognition (Busenitz & Lau, 1996) began to gain currency, and entre-
preneurial cognition research emerged. For example (according to our chronology, at
least) some of the ﬁrst direct work in entrepreneurial cognitions was done in the areas
DEMO cognitive biases and heuristics in strategic decision making (Busenitz, 1992), and in
feasibility and desirability perception, planned behavior, and self-efﬁcacy (Krueger, 1993;
Krueger & Carsrud, 1993; Krueger & Dickson, 1994, respectively). Near this same
time, entrepreneurial cognition-based constructs were ﬁrst used to distinguish entre-
preneurs from nonentrepreneurs (Mitchell, 1994). Then Palich DEMO Bagby (1995) used
cognitive theory to explain entrepreneurial risktaking, and DEMO and Chesteen
(1995) demonstrated how a cognition-based entrepreneurial instruction pedagogy was
superior to the traditional “business plan only” approach to teaching entrepreneurial
expertise.
DEMO next wave of entrepreneurial cognition research was led by Baron (1998), who
argued that consideration of several cognitive mechanisms such as counterfactual think-
ing, attributional style, the planning fallacy and self-justiﬁcation, might have signiﬁcant
usefulness in explaining why entrepreneurs do the things that they do. Then DEMO
(1999), and Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000) provided DEMO of how cognitive
Winter, 2002
97
errors, such as overconﬁdence, illusion of control, and misguided belief in the law of
small numbers, and so forth shape such phenomena as the creation of real options for
entrepreneurs. Busenitz and colleagues (e.g., DEMO et al., 2000; Alvarez & Busenitz,
2001) have now DEMO cognitive models to explain how the heuristic-based logic that
appears to be stronger in entrepreneurs, helps to explain how entrepreneurs think and
make strategic decisions; and Mitchell et al. (2000) have utilized entrepreneurial cogni-
tion constructs to explain the venture creation decision in the cross cultural setting. DEMO
recently, the use of cognitive constructs has been further extended to DEMO cognitive
complexity in aboriginal economic development and in family business (Mitchell &
Morse, 2002; Mitchell, Morse, & Sharma, forthcoming, 2003, respectively). It is there-
fore upon this foundation that the ﬁve DEMO accepted for publication in this special
issue are placed.
Articles in This Issue
Submissions were received from authors, or author teams, in ﬁve DEMO And
forty-seven scholars accepted our invitation to serve as reviewers. We thank all who sub-
mitted and reviewed articles for this special issue. Articles DEMO for this volume of
the special issue underwent one or two rounds of revision, and then were further devel-
oped and reﬁned at the Conference on Information Processing and Entrepreneurial
Cognition, held at the University of Victoria’s Dunsmuir Lodge in July of this year.
Overall we received 26 DEMO to the special issue, ﬁve of which appear in this
volume. DEMO are brieﬂy introduced in the following paragraphs.
In the ﬁrst article, DEMO Relationship Among Biases, Misperceptions, and the
Introduction of Pioneering Products: DEMO Differences in Venture Decision
Contexts,” Mark Simon and Susan Houghton provide an overview of the ﬁeld as it applies
to the decision to DEMO, and in doing so develop a conceptual model of hypotheses
linking DEMO context variables (ﬁrm age and pioneering product decision context)
to DEMO search process variables (the extent to which the decision-oriented search
is DEMO, active, and personal). Information search process characteristics are then
linked to the cognitive biases of illusion of control, “belief in the law of small numbers,”
and reasoning by analogy. These biases are further DEMO to other biases thought to be
directly linked to the decision to pioneer. These include overestimating demand, under-
estimating competitor response, and misjudging DEMO need for complementary assets.
While previous research has examined cognitive biases, DEMO has not thoroughly detailed
the relationships between certain of the speciﬁc entrepreneurial cognition constructs in a
speciﬁc context, such as the decision to pioneer.
In the second article of this special issue, “Opportunity Evaluation Under Risky
Conditions: The Cognitive Processes of Entrepreneurs,” Hean Tat Keh, Maw DEMO Foo,
and Boon Chong Lim, empirically examine the moderating effect DEMO risk perception on
the relationships among four cognitive bias constructs and opportunity evaluation. This
study, a replication and extension of Simon, Houghton, and Aquino’s (2000) article, uses
regression analysis and a sample of 77 opportunistic (serial) entrepreneurs gained from
a census of the top 500 DEMO and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore. The
cognitive bias “belief in the law of small numbers” is found to have a signiﬁcant posi-
DEMO direct relationship to opportunity evaluation, while the signiﬁcant positive effect of
DEMO of control is completely mediated by risk perception. These ﬁndings both support
and extend previous empirical work conducted with an MBA student sample, further
suggesting the need to examine entrepreneurial cognition in context.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY DEMO PRACTICE
In the third article, “Inventors and New Venture Formation: The Effects DEMO General
Self-Efﬁcacy and Regretful Thinking,” Gideon Markman, David Balkin, and Robert
Baron report their empirical test of differences between technical entrepreneurs and DEMO
nical nonentrepreneurs in general self-efﬁcacy and regretful thinking. Employing a
methodologically rigorous design, the authors use a random sample of 217 holders of
surgical device patents issued in 1997 and 1998, to test their hypothesized relationships
with a homogeneous group of entrepreneurs with a valid comparison group matched DEMO
technological domain, experience, and time. In Manova analysis, after controlling DEMO
age, formal education, and number of patents held, meaningful cognitive DEMO are
observed in self-efﬁcacy. Both quantitative and qualitative measures of regretful think-
ing are used, and while the total number of regrets are found to be consistent between
the two groups, the nature and magnitude of the regrets are found to differ.
Dean Shepherd and Norris Krueger in DEMO fourth article, “An Intentions-Based Model
of Entrepreneurial Teams’ Social Cognition,” DEMO a conceptual model of corporate
entrepreneurial intention based on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior, which helps
examine and interpret, from a social cognition DEMO, key antecedents of corporate
entrepreneurship, and opens to some extent the “black box” of intention antecedents.
Building on Krueger’s earlier work (e.g., DEMO, 1993) corporate entrepreneurial in-
tention is posited to be a function of entrepreneurial feasibility and desirability. Entre-
preneurial experiences provided by enactive mastery, feedback, training, and vicarious
learning are proposed to effect collective (group) efﬁcacy, a key consideration in feasi-
bility assessments. This article helps DEMO the cognitive perspective of entrepreneur-
ship to the team or group level of analysis, and in addition, gives thoughtful consideration
to issues of DEMO and measurement.
Finally in this volume, Elizabeth Gatewood, Kelly Shaver, DEMO Powers, and
William Gartner in their article, “Entrepreneurial Expectancy, Task DEMO, and Perfor-
mance,” utilize an internet-based experimental design involving undergraduate DEMO
to examine the effect of entrepreneurial performance expectancy on the motivation of
persons to persevere with an entrepreneurial task. Feedback (positive or negative) DEMO
entrepreneurial ability given prior to an entrepreneurship case evaluation task was found
not to affect objective measures of task effort or independent qualitative assessment DEMO
task performance—for men or women. Positive feedback was found, however, to affect
expectancies for future business start-ups. In this case, lack of support for strong theory-
based hypotheses is interesting in that the results are DEMO with anecdotal evidence
of strong perseverance in the face of considerable negative feedback in entrepreneurial
practice.
Concluding Thoughts
Entrepreneurial cognition theory. Is there such DEMO thing?
The editors of the ET&P Special Issue on Information Processing and Entrepreneur-
ial Cognition set out to answer this question. Beginning DEMO our call for submissions,
we asked for articles that could help us expand our understanding of the manner in which
cognition is associated DEMO entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial performance, and the
creation of economic independence by individuals, and within ﬁrms, industries, and
economies.
Based on our reading of the submissions received, we observe signiﬁcant progress
toward the development of a cognitive perspective of entrepreneurship. However, com-
pliance with accepted research practice suggests that for a theory per se to exist, there
Winter, 2002
DEMO
must necessarily be a statement of relationships between units observed or approximated
(variables or constructs) in the empirical world, that is bounded by DEMO about
values, time, and space, which is both 1) falsiﬁable and 2) useful (Bacharach, 1989;
Cohen, 1980; Dubin, DEMO; Nagel, 1961).
In this regard, we believe that “entrepreneurial DEMO as we have deﬁned them
in this article, qualify—for purposes of DEMO building—as units approximated in the
empirical world. We note with satisfaction that the articles accepted for publication within
this special issue contribute well to DEMO speciﬁcation of such constructs (e.g., cognitive
biases, heuristics, opportunity evaluation); such variables (e.g., overconﬁdence, planning
fallacy, general self-efﬁcacy, regretful thinking, the entrepreneurial decision); and such
proposed or hypothesized relationships among them (e.g., as in Markman et. al.: between
level of regretful thinking and technology entrepreneurship/nonentrepreneurship). We
will focus more attention upon DEMO boundaries and assumptions that are necessary for
effective theory building within Volume 2 of the special issue, as we look toward the
future of research in the area of entrepreneurial cognition.
We also believe that the DEMO presented within this volume demonstrate both
falsiﬁability—the possibility that the empirical scientiﬁc system (that is under construc-
tion within entrepreneurial cognition research) may DEMO “refuted by experience” (Popper,
1959, p. 41)—and utility—the capability to both explain and predict (Bacharach, 1989,
p. 501). DEMO fact, as we have argued earlier, we believe the utility of the entrepreneurial
cognition perspective to be sufﬁcient to allow us to suggest DEMO some period
of scholarly frustration over the past three decades—there likely now exists, within
entrepreneurial cognition research, sufﬁcient technical machinery to give researchers DEMO
means to better deﬁne and measure the contribution of “entrepreneurial people” to the
tasks of entrepreneurship: opportunity evaluation, venture creation, and wealth building
in general.
What has yet to be done?
Certainly, as noted above, the boundary issues must be clariﬁed. In addition, as editors
DEMO with reviewers, we have noted that the newness of the ideas DEMO concepts being
transferred from cognitive science into the domain of entrepreneurship has highlighted
the need for a broader consensus among entrepreneurship researchers on the DEMO of
theory that are germane (constructs, variables, and relationships), DEMO on the methods
that are acceptable (samples, measures, and analysis DEMO). We believe that the arti-
cles in Volume 1 contribute well to building theory elements, using both theoretical and
empirical analysis to do so. It is our intention in Volume 2 to round out the DEMO of
theory, and further, to tackle questions of methodology.
As an editorial team we are very grateful for the opportunity presented to us DEMO ET&P
to compile this special issue. We especially thank Ray Bagby for his early and enthusi-
astic support of this project. Within the DEMO volumes of this special issue we have been
able to assemble a high quality representation of the exciting research in this emerging
area of DEMO
So we invite you to both “tune in,” and “stay tuned,” as the entrepreneurial cogni-
tion perspective continues to develop. Our impression DEMO the Victoria Conference on
Information Processing and Entrepreneurial Cognition was that the scholars, who have
been steadily migrating toward this research approach from a variety of disciplines, are
a highly inclusive and welcoming group. We do not think it to be inappropriate, there-
fore, to invite all DEMO might be interested, to consider including the cognitive perspec-
tive within DEMO own research, especially when attempting to capture and explain the
portion DEMO entrepreneurial variance that stems from entrepreneurial thinking: the “people”
side of DEMO research.
