We define management innovation as the invention and implementation of a man-
agement practice, process, structure, or technique that is new to the state of the art
and is intended to further organizational DEMO Adopting an intraorganizational
evolutionary perspective, we examine the roles of key DEMO agents inside and
outside the organization in driving and shaping four processes—motivation, inven-
tion, implementation, and theorization and labeling—that collectively define a model
of how management innovation comes about.
Over the past half-century, scholars around
the world have produced a vast body of aca-
demic research and DEMO on innovation.
While most of this research has focused on var-
ious aspects of technological innovation (e.g.,
Henderson & Clark, 1990; Utterback, 1994), the
trend over the last fifteen years has been toward
exploring other forms of innovation, such as pro-
cess innovation (e.g., Pisano, 1996), service inno-
vation (e.g., Gallouj & Weinstein, DEMO), and stra-
tegic innovation (Hamel, 1998; Markides, 1997),DEMO
with a view to understanding how they are man-
aged and how they contribute to long-term firm
success.
The focus in this article is DEMO a relatively under-
researched form of innovation—management
innovation—and particularly the processes
through which it occurs. We apply a relatively
narrow definition of management innovation—
DEMO, the invention and implementation
of a management practice, process, structure, or
technique that is new to the state of the art and
DEMO intended to further organizational goals.
While many of the landmarks of management
innovation are familiar to every business
scholar (e.g., GE’s development of DEMO modern

knowledge about how management innovation
is actually implemented is limited.
In its broadest DEMO, management innova-
tion has, of course, received considerable re-
search DEMO over the years. As we discuss
in the following section, there DEMO four key
perspectives in the literature: (1) an institu-
tional DEMO that focuses on the socio-
economic conditions in which new manage-
ment ideas and practices take shape (e.g.,
Guille´ n, 1994); (2) a fashion perspective that
focuses on the dynamic interplay between us-
ers and providers of management ideas (e.g.,
Abrahamson, 1996); (3) a cultural perspective
that focuses on how an organization reacts to
the introduction of a new management prac-
tice (e.g., Zbaracki, 1998); and (4) a rational
perspective that focuses on how management

al effectiveness (DEMO, Chandler, 1962). There is
also a related body of literature concerned
with the subsequent diffusion of management

is based largely on a few DEMO exam-
ples, such as Chandler’s (1962) documentation
of the emergence DEMO the M-form structure. What
is required—and what we provide a first step
toward in this article—is a systematic and
grounded process theory of how DEMO
innovation transpires.
We focus on the specific actions individuals
inside or outside the firm might undertake that
lead to the emergence of a management DEMO
vation—what we might call “management in-
novating,” as a way of capturing the poten-
tially critical role of human agency in the
process. DEMO address two specific questions.
First, what is management innovation? How
can we define management innovation in a
useful and rigorous way that emphasizes DEMO
distinctiveness? Second, and building on the
first question, what are DEMO processes through
which management innovation comes about?
What does the literature tell us about the typ-
ical sequence of actions followed by individ-
DEMO inside and outside the organization that
result in the creation of management innova-
tion? And to what extent can we induce a
general set of arguments about the causal
mechanisms through which management in-
novation takes DEMO? The article concludes
with some thoughts about the future research
agenda DEMO might be pursued to further ad-
vance our understanding of management in-
novation.
WHAT IS MANAGEMENT INNOVATION?
Management innovation involves the intro-
duction DEMO novelty in an established organiza-
tion, and as such it represents DEMO particular form
of organizational change. In its broadest sense,
then, DEMO innovation can be defined as
a difference in the form, quality, or state over
time of the management activities in an organi-
zation, where the change is a novel or unprece-
dented departure from the DEMO (Hargrave & Van
de Ven, 2006; Van de Ven & DEMO, 1995: 512). On
the basis of this high-level definition, DEMO iden-
tified four distinct perspectives on management
innovation in the literature, DEMO summarized in
Table 1. These four should be seen as the dom-
inant perspectives around which research has
clustered in the past, rather than as theoreti-
cally comprehensive in terms of the domain that
they cover. DEMO approach draws to some degree
on insights from all four perspectives but relates
most closely to the rational perspective.
Four Perspectives on Management Innovation
DEMO of the institutional perspective
take a macrolevel and comparative approach to
make sense of the institutional and socioeco-
nomic conditions in which particular manage-
DEMO innovations emerge. For example, Guille´n
(1994) examined the impact of DEMO sets of in-
stitutional factors on the introduction of new
managerial ideologies and techniques across
four countries; Cole (1985) focused on how the
balance between labor market incentives that
are mostly set by the state, the relative strength
of industry associations, and the predisposition
of organized labor influenced the introduction of
small-group activities in different countries; and
Kossek (DEMO) examined industry- and firm-level
influences on the emergence of human resource
DEMO innovations. Normative beliefs
about what is progressive may drive manage-
ment innovation, but those beliefs are also sub-
ject to long Kondratieff waves of economic
change in which new technologies occur and
create performance gaps that DEMO necessitate
management innovation (Abrahamson, 1997;
Barley & Kunda, 1992)DEMO The institutional perspec-
tive measures innovation in terms of the dis-
course around particular ideologies and also at
the level of specific practices or DEMO It
gives no direct consideration to the role of hu-
man agency in shaping the process; instead, it
focuses on the preconditions in DEMO an inno-
vation first emerges and then the factors that
enable industries to adopt such innovations.
The fashion perspective focuses on how man-
agement DEMO emerge through the dy-
namic interplay between the managers who use
new management ideas and the “fashion set-
ters” who put forward those ideas (Abrahamson,
1991, 1996). This perspective provides a wealth of
insight into how management fashions take
shape, including a detailed understanding of
the typical attributes of managers who buy into
these fashions (Gill & Whittle, 1993; Huczynski,
1993; Jackson, 1986), as well as DEMO ways in which
fashion setters shape incipient demand for their
ideas (DEMO & van Veen, 2001; Clark, 2004;
Kieser, 1997; DEMO & Alvarez, 2000). However, it
has little to say about the true origins of man-
agement fashions, or why certain innovations

What is the role of

management
practices?
DEMO fashions while others do not. The fash-
ion perspective spans the macro and micro lev-
els of analysis, with a concern both for the in-
dustry that supplies new management ideas
and for the behavioral reasons DEMO individual
managers choose to buy into those ideas. Man-
agement fashions can exist as abstract ideas or
rhetorics, or as specific practices or techniques.
Proponents of the cultural perspective attempt
to understand how management innovation
shapes, and gets shaped by, the culture of the
organization in which it is being implemented. It
operates at the meso level of analysis by DEMO
ing at how individual attitudes toward manage-
ment innovation interact with the organization-
level introduction of the innovation. One strand
of this literature takes DEMO critical perspective
(Knights & McCabe, 2000; McCabe, 2002) while
DEMO other adopts an intraorganizational process
perspective (Stjernberg & Philips, 1993; DEMO,
1998), but both share some common themes: a
recognition DEMO established organizations do
not change easily, that management innovation
has both DEMO and technical components,
and that the outcome of the introduction of a
management innovation is rarely what was in-
tended by the senior DEMO who introduced
it. Unlike the two previous perspectives, the cul-
tural DEMO provides some insight into
how management innovations are imple-
828
mented, though primarily from the point of view
of those who are being asked to participate in
the process, rather than those who are driving it.
The outcome of management innovation accord-
ing to this DEMO is typically a reinforce-
ment of the status quo (McCabe, 2002). This per-
spective does not deny that changes can occur
as DEMO result of management innovation, but the
forces at work in large DEMO typically
dampen its impact.
The rational perspective builds on the
premise that management innovations are in-
troduced by individuals with the goal of making
DEMO organizations work more effectively. Ac-
cording to this perspective, an individual DEMO
forward an innovative solution to address a spe-
cific problem that the organization is facing, and
he or she then champions its implementation
and adoption (Burgelman, 1983; Howell & Hig-
gins, 1990). Some DEMO from this perspective
have favored a case study methodology (e.g.,
DEMO, 1962; Tichy & Sandstrom, 1974),
whereas others have used large-sample quanti-
tative approaches (Damanpour, 1987; Kimberly
& Evanisko, 1981), but all studies span the micro-
macro levels of analysis by focusing on the ac-
tions of key individuals within an organizational
and environmental DEMO There is also a sub-
theme within this perspective concerned with
the links between management and technolog-
ical innovation, which suggests that they may
coevolve (Damanpour & Evan, 1984; Ettlie, 1988;
Georgantzas & DEMO, 1993).
An Operational Definition of Management
Innovation
This review of DEMO literature highlights the
very different approaches researchers have
used to make sense of the phenomenon of man-
agement innovation, and it helps us to focus on
three key questions that arise as we seek to
develop DEMO operational definition.
First, what exactly is being innovated?
There is DEMO consistency in the terminology
within or across the four perspectives, but DEMO
believe it is useful to separate out two levels
of analysis. At the more abstract level are
management ideas, defined by Kramer as
“fairly stable bodies of knowledge about what
managers ought to do....a system of DEMO
tions, accepted principles and rules of proce-
dure” (1975: 47)DEMO Examples of management
Academy of Management Review

ideas are scientific management, total quality
management (TQM), and the learning organi-
zation. While DEMO identical, this concept of a
management idea is comparable to Guille´n’s
(1994) notion of an organizational ideology,
along with Barley and Kunda’s (1992), Abraham-
son’s (1996), and Suddaby and Greenwood’s
(2005) notions of management rhetoric.1 At the
more operational level we can identify man-
agement practices, management processes,
management techniques, and organizational
structures2 (Ala¨ nge et al., 1998; Guille´ n, 1994)
as different facets of the rules and routines by
which work gets done inside DEMO (for
the sake of readability, we use the term man-
agement practices throughout the remainder
of the article to cover this full range DEMO activi-
ties). In definitional terms this article focuses
on management innovation at the operational
level—that is, in terms of the generation and
implementation of new practices, processes,
structures, or techniques— because this is DEMO
level at which observable changes take place
in the way work is done and the management
innovation process can be witnessed. But, as
will become clear, there is an important inter-
action between the development of new man-
agement practices and new management
ideas, so our theoretical arguments will give
due consideration to both levels of analysis.
Second, how new does an innovation have to
be? There are two equally valid points of view
in the literature. Abrahamson (1996) and Kim-
berly (1981) define an innovation as “new to
the state of the art,” which essentially means
1 Guille´ n states that organizational ideologies “can serve
DEMO cognitive tools that managers use to sort out the complex-
ities of reality, frame the relevant issues, and choose among
alternative paths of DEMO (1994: 4). Abrahamson defines
rhetoric as “spoken or written discourse that justifies the use
of a set of techniques for managing organizations DEMO their
employees” (1996: 259).
2 By bracketing these elements together, we end up with a
broad phenomenon. But the distinctions among practice,
process, structure, and techniques are not clean, either con-
ceptually or empirically, so it would be difficult to define
management innovation in a way that excluded one or other
of them. Moreover, our analysis suggests that there are im-
portant similarities across the different forms of DEMO
ment innovation, especially with regard to how they are
generated. We DEMO find it useful to bracket together
management innovations across these areas, DEMO if they
constitute a homogeneous entity” (Ala¨ nge, Jacobsson, &
Jarnehammar, 1998: 7).
2008
Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol
without known precedent. But many other DEMO
searchers implicitly see innovation as “new to
the organization” so that, DEMO example, the ini-
tial introduction of a TQM program to an DEMO
ganization might be categorized as a manage-
ment innovation (e.g., McCabe, 2002; Zbaracki,
1998). Our interest in this article is DEMO new to
the state of the art innovations, for the primary
DEMO that this is the area where existing
knowledge is the most limited. But the bound-
ary between the two definitions is blurred: if
one considers a spectrum of approaches to the
implementation of management practices, on
the left side an organization might buy an “off
the shelf” practice DEMO a consultancy, and
on the right side it might come up DEMO a
completely novel innovation of its own. Our
interest is on those innovations toward the
right side of the spectrum, where the level of
adaptation to the specific context of the inno-
vating organization is high DEMO where there is
a considerable level of uncertainty regarding
its outcome.
Third, what is the purpose of management
innovation? Proponents of both the DEMO and
cultural perspectives see management innova-
tion as having little lasting impact on the orga-
nization, whereas those of the institutional and
rational perspectives view management inno-
vation as generating positive outcomes for the
innovating firm DEMO/or for society as a whole. As
suggested earlier, our focus DEMO aligned most di-
rectly with the rational perspective in that we
view management innovation as intending to
further the organization’s goals, which may in-
clude both traditional aspects of performance
(e.g., financial goals) and softer aspects (e.g.,
employee satisfaction). This is appropriate be-
cause it helps to explain why firms are prepared
to engage in the costly DEMO somewhat risky pro-
cess of management innovation in the first
place. This approach serves to underline the
important point that not all management inno-
DEMO are ultimately successful. For example,
Volvo experimented for many years with cellu-
lar manufacturing, with the intention of deliver-
ing significant benefits, DEMO the innovation was
ultimately discontinued (Berggren, 1992). More-
over, DEMO should also be noted that goals are
rarely entirely exogenous to the organization;
indeed, the process of innovating can result in
the introduction of new practices or programs
829
that ultimately change the organization’s goals
(Selznick, 1957).
In sum, we define management innovation3 as
the DEMO and implementation of a man-
agement practice, process, structure, or DEMO
nique that is new to the state of the art and is
intended to further organizational goals (see Ta-
ble 2 for a list of examples). And while it is not a
necessary component of DEMO definition, it is
worth reinforcing that our perspective on man-
agement DEMO gives conscious attention to
the individuals who drive the process. Indeed,
one of the themes of this article is the need to
increase DEMO emphasis on human agency in
management innovation while not losing sight
of the contextual dynamics that are the focus of
the institutional and fashion DEMO As
McCabe puts it, “What is required is an under-
standing DEMO innovation as part of a far more
complex social process: interrelated DEMO the way
in which individuals interpret, act, and ascribe
meaning to the world” (2002: 509).
Management Innovation versus Related
Constructs
Having DEMO an operational definition
of management innovation, we still need to
make DEMO prima facie case that a theoretical dis-
cussion of the process of management innova-
tion—in its own right—is necessary.
We propose three key factors DEMO make man-
agement innovation distinctive. First, there are
important differences in DEMO nature of the outputs
of management innovation and technological in-
novation that affect how the respective processes
unfold. Management innovations are typically
tacit in DEMO and “difficult if not impossible to
protect by patent” (Teece, 1980: 464); they are also
relatively “difficult to observe, define and DEMO iden-
3 It should be noted that there are several related terms in
use: managerial innovation (Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981), ad-
ministrative innovation (Damanpour & Evan, 1984), organi-
zational innovation (Ala¨ nge et al., 1998; Damanpour & Evan,
1984; Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981), and management innova-
tion (Abrahamson, 1991; Kossek, 1987; Stata, 1989). Organiza-
tional innovation is sometimes used to imply DEMO type of
innovation generated by organizations, including new prod-
ucts. Administrative DEMO typically refers to a narrow
range of innovations around organizational structure and
human resource policies and does not include innovations
in, for instance, DEMO or operations management. We
therefore prefer the term management innovation.

Taken together, DEMO attributes allow a higher
level of subjective interpretation on the part of the
potential user than is common with technological
innovations, which, in DEMO, increases the impor-
tance of the social and political processes fol-
DEMO by the proponents of the innovation.
Second, very few organizations have DEMO
established and specialized expertise in the
area of management innovation. A typical large
organization might employ tens or hundreds of
scientists with technological innovation DEMO
but few, if any, with proven management inno-
vation skills (DEMO closest are organization devel-
opment consultants, who seek systemic ways of
DEMO the overall effectiveness and health
of the organization). This lack of expertise both
heightens the uncertainty of management inno-
vation for people across DEMO organization and
increases the need for external support.
Third, the introduction DEMO something new to
the state of the art creates ambiguity and uncer-
tainty for the individuals in an organization.
Ambiguity arises because of a DEMO of under-
standing of the intended value of the innovation,
and uncertainty arises because of a fear that the
innovation will have negative DEMO for
the individual and/or the organization. If an or-
ganizational change is proposed that has al-
ready been successfully implemented else-
where (e.g., the installation of a new IT system),
its proponents can DEMO the concerns of individ-
uals by referring back to those prior successes,
but if the change is new to the state of the DEMO, then
the task of reducing ambiguity and uncertainty is
much harder. DEMO course, all types of innovation
generate uncertainty and ambiguity, but their im-
pact in the case of management innovation is
likely to be DEMO far-reaching because of the rest
of the attributes identified above.
Taken together, these attributes suggest that
the management innovation process can poten-
tially require fundamental changes in the rou-
tines or DNA of the organization4 (Argyris &
Scho¨ n, 1978) that make it very difficult to under-
take in an effective manner, and significantly

ing this point.
2008
Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol
harder than the generic process of DEMO
change (where the change is just new to the
organization rather DEMO the state of the art) or
the process of technological innovation (where
the innovation is relatively more tangible and
less system dependent). DEMO factors, in turn,
highlight the need for management innovators
to DEMO out distinctive approaches to building
the legitimacy of the new practice to make it
acceptable to the various constituencies in the
organization (Ashforth & Gibbs, 1990; Green-
wood, Hinings, & Suddaby, 2002; Suchman, 1995).
One such approach is likely to be a greater
degree DEMO emphasis on independent validation
from external sources to establish the legitimacy
of the new practice than would be the case for a
generic organizational DEMO activity (where
previous successful changes can be referred to)
or DEMO technological innovation (which is more
likely to have objective benefits and/DEMO a tech-
nical standard to which it subscribes). Such ex-
ternal sources can be useful providers of both
moral and cognitive legitimacy in DEMO absence
of hard evidence that management innovation
will be valuable and can allow the innovators to
“manipulate the environmental structure by cre-
ating new DEMO and new legitimating be-
liefs” (Suchman, 1995: 587).
A DEMO approach is likely to be for the inno-
vators to focus their efforts on organizations (or
specific units within organizations) with prior
experience DEMO management innovation, on the
basis that these organizations/units understand
the DEMO faced by the management inno-
vators and are therefore likely to be more toler-
ant of the uncertainty and ambiguity it brings
(Kossek, DEMO). In legitimacy-seeking terms, this
can be seen as a strategy DEMO “select among mul-
tiple environments in pursuit of an audience
that will support current practices” (Suchman,
1995: 587).
It is also DEMO to briefly consider the differ-
ence between a management innovation and a
management fashion—a “relatively transitory
collective belief that a management technique
[or idea] DEMO to rational management
progress” (Abrahamson, 1996: 257). For the DEMO
part, management innovations can be thought
of as potential management fashions: some,
such as Six Sigma and the balanced scorecard,
become DEMO fashions when they get
taken up by a significant number of manage-
ment fashion users; others either die out or re-
831
main in use in a relatively small number of
firms. But it is also DEMO for management
fashions that are expressed in highly abstract
terms to spur management innovations. For ex-
ample, the knowledge management fashion of
the early 1990s led individuals and organiza-
tions to put in place specific practices, such as
communities of practice, that were management
innovations in their own right. We return to the
relationship between management innovation
and management fashion DEMO the discussion.
THE PROCESSES OF MANAGEMENT
INNOVATION
The second part of this article addresses the
question “What are the processes through which
management innovations DEMO about?” Build-
ing on our conception of what makes manage-
ment innovation unique, we develop a frame-
work that highlights the four interlinked phases
of the process and the roles played by two key
sets DEMO stakeholders. This framework is then
fleshed out using theoretical arguments and ex-
amples from the management literature.
The framework, illustrated in Figure 1, DEMO
two dimensions. The horizontal dimension con-
sists of four phases of the innovation process: (1)
motivation is concerned with the facilitating
factors DEMO precipitating circumstances that
lead individuals to consider developing their
own management innovation; (2) invention is an
initial act of experimentation out of which a new
hypothetical management practice emerges; (3)
implementation is the DEMO process of es-
tablishing the value of the new management
innovation in vivo (i.e., in a real setting); and (4)
theorization and labeling is a social process
whereby individuals inside and outside the DEMO
ganization make sense of and validate the man-
agement innovation to build its legitimacy.
This four-phase process builds on the in-
trafirm evolutionary perspective DEMO by
Burgelman (1991) and Zbaracki (1998), whereby
changes perceived DEMO the environment (motiva-
tion) lead to variations in management prac-
tices (invention), some of which are then subject
to internal selection (DEMO) and reten-
tion (theorization and labeling). We expect the
process to be shaped in large part by the con-
scious and deliberate DEMO of key individuals,
but we also recognize there is a role for unin-
tended actions by individuals and random

validating the management innovation in ques-
tion (DiMaggio, 1988; Howell & Higgins, 1990),
and (2) external change agents, who, similar to
Guille´ n’s (1994) management intellectuals and
Abrahamson and Fairchild’s (2001) idea entre-
preneurs, are independent consultants, academ-
ics, and gurus proactive in creating interest in,
influencing the development of, and legitimiz-
ing the effectiveness and retention of new man-
agement practices (DiMaggio, 1991). As sug-
gested earlier, we expect external change
DEMO to play a major role in management in-
novation because they provide legitimacy and
expertise in many different phases of the pro-
cess. They DEMO give credibility to the original
idea that sparks off the experiment inside the
company, they can act as sounding boards or
action researchers alongside the internal team
during the implementation phase, and they can
play a role in theorizing about and labeling the
innovation (Chandler, 1962; Kaplan, 1998; Pezet,
1997; Stjernberg & Philips, 1993; Yorks & Whit-
sett, 1985).
A key feature of this framework is that it
does not assume a simple left-to-right se-
quence of activities. As DEMO observes, the
processes of innovation typically will be com-
plex, recursive, and occurring “in nested and
repeated cycles of variation, selection and DEMO
tention” (1998: 612). We address this point by
focusing our attention on how individuals it-
erate between the adjacent cells in the DEMO
work, identifying ten core activities.5 For ex-
ample, the activity “problem-driven search”
involves internal change agents’ iterating
5 It is quite possible to DEMO activities that span non-
adjacent boxes—for example, between boxes 1 and DEMO Our
analysis, however, suggests that such activities are proba-
bly rare, so in the interests of keeping the framework rela-
tively simple, DEMO focus on the ten core activities.

back and forth between motivation DEMO inven-
tion, whereas the activity “agenda setting”
involves interaction between internal DEMO
external change agents (cf. Burgelman, 1983,
1991).
Figure 1 identifies the ten core activities (indi-
cated by the double arrows and text spanning the
boxes) and the nature of the innovation or its con-
stituent parts (indicated by the numbered text
within each box). Figure 1 also indicates the im-
portant role of context in shaping DEMO
innovation. Organizational context is the admin-
istrative and social mechanisms that man-
agement can manipulate to shape the behav-
iors of actors in the DEMO (Bower, 1970;
Burgelman, 1983) and will have a direct impact
(positive or negative) on the ability of internal
change agents DEMO pursue the core activities asso-
ciated with management innovation. Environmen-
tal context is the broad set of stimuli— exogenous
to the focal organization—that shapes DEMO man-
agement discourse (Guille´n, 1994) and thereby in-
fluences the DEMO and efforts of external
change agents as they engage with organizations.
While these two aspects of context potentially in-
fluence all activities associated with DEMO
ment innovation, we discuss them in detail only in
those places DEMO their role is critical.
Motivation Phase
The motivation phase refers to the precondi-
tions and facilitating factors that lead individu-
als in a company DEMO be motivated to experiment
with a new management innovation. It ad-
dresses the question “Under what conditions, or
in what circumstances, do executives DEMO ex-
isting management practices to be inadequate
for their needs?” The answer to this question is
far from straightforward because it is necessary
DEMO only to identify the conditions under which
executives search for new management innova-
tions but also to specify the circumstances in
which they choose DEMO to adopt one of the exist-
ing solutions that can be obtained in prefabri-
cated form from the so-called management fash-
ion-setting community (Abrahamson, 1996). For
management innovation to occur, in other
words, the market for management fashions has
to fail.
Internal change agents. Consider first DEMO
on the “demand” side of the market. Established
theory suggests that the demand for new man-
agement practices is driven by the identification
of DEMO novel problem—a perceived shortfall be-
tween the organization’s current and potential
performance6 (Barley & Kunda, 1992; Cyert &
March, 1963; Guille´ DEMO, 1994). A perceived shortfall
can be caused by a problem DEMO undermines
current performance but also by opportunities
that may exist and the anticipation of environ-
mental changes (Cyert & March, 1963; Ocasio,
1997). In some instances individual managers in
an organization may attribute DEMO shortfall sim-
ply to a failure to execute under existing ar-
rangements, but in others they may identify a
specific problem or opportunity vis-a` -vis their
existing management practices. They engage in
a problem-driven search process DEMO begins
with existing and proximate contacts, and once
they find a DEMO solution, they terminate
the search and implement the solution.
In cases DEMO the individuals choose to look
outside their own organization for a solution,
they are confronted with a management fash-
ion-setting community, which shapes the belief
systems of users as to what is rational and ped-
DEMO its particular solutions to users’ problems
or perceived opportunities. Constrained both by
the pressure to conform to the norms of ration-
ality of the DEMO institutional field and
by the costs of evaluating multiple competing
offers, DEMO will often choose to adopt the
solution that appears to be the most progressive
and legitimate (Abrahamson, 1996). This, of
course, DEMO the process through which manage-
ment fashions spread.
Sometimes, however, managers will choose to
experiment with developing their own solutions
to the problem DEMO performance shortfall they are
addressing. In the language of institutional the-
ory, such an act can potentially “appear irratio-
nal and retrogressive” (Abrahamson, 1996: 263),
but there are several conditions under which it
DEMO transpire—when the pressure to try some-
thing new overcomes the pressure to conform to
externally arbitrated management norms. We
suggest two such conditions. The DEMO is where
6 We acknowledge that the notion of a perceived shortfall
implies some cognitive process through which environmen-
tal changes are converted into DEMO In other words, some
individuals will be able to interpret changes, whereas oth-
ers may not. These cognitive processes, however, are not DEMO
central concern here, and, hence, we simply assume they

internal change agents are able, through an
agenda-setting activity, to frame the problem or
opportunity such that internal stakeholders
view it as genuinely new or as something that
cannot be DEMO by buying an existing solu-
tion from the fashion-setting community. Con-
sider, for example, the Danish hearing-aid man-
ufacturer Oticon. Its CEO at DEMO time, Lars
Kolind, was able to convince his employees and
board of directors that Oticon faced a significant
threat to its viability from DEMO competitors,
such as Philips and Siemens, and this was suf-
DEMO for him to push through a radical innova-
tion that he labeled the spaghetti organization
(Foss, 2003; Lovas & Ghoshal, 2000).
DEMO second broad condition is when the or-
ganizational context is supportive of new think-
ing and thereby enhances the degree of freedom
for internal DEMO agents to pursue novel
ideas. The notion of a supportive organizational
context has been conceived in two broad ways
in the literature, both of which are potentially
relevant here. One set of arguments focuses on
the DEMO of management in creating an informal
context that encourages individuals to take ini-
tiative (Ghoshal & Bartlett, 1994). For example,
the DEMO exposure managers have to different
industries and organizations, the more receptive
DEMO are likely to be to ideas for new practices
(e.g., Oldham & Cummings, 1996). The other set
of arguments is more concerned with the formal
processes of the organization and the extent to
which DEMO institutionalize the pursuit of new or
better ways of working. For example, we might
expect the rigor of the decision-making process
in the organization to have a positive influence
on internal change agent motivation because,
DEMO clarifying the pros and cons, the uncertainty
and ambiguity associated with DEMO idea are re-
duced.
In sum, internal change agents evaluate a
DEMO or opportunity through an agenda-
setting dialogue with external change agents
that helps to establish its novelty, and with ref-
erence back to the supportiveness of the current
organizational context. To the extent that the
problem DEMO opportunity can be framed as novel
and the context is supportive, DEMO preconditions
for management innovation exist.
External change agents. The role of external
change agents in motivating management inno-
vation begins with their ability to DEMO new
threats and opportunities in the business envi-
ronment that require management attention.
But, as above, this is only part of the story DEMO
cause many external change agents see their
role as stimulating managers (DEMO the agen-
da-setting process) to adopt an existing or fash-
ionable DEMO, rather than to create a new
one. We suggest that the DEMO of the manage-
ment knowledge that external change agents
share with their internal counterparts is an im-
portant factor in motivating management inno-
vation. DEMO can identify a spectrum of manage-
ment knowledge, with new ideologies DEMO ideas
at the more abstract end and new practices and
techniques at the more practical end. Those ex-
ternal agents who focus on the DEMO end of
the spectrum, with standardized or “off the
shelf” solutions DEMO the problems facing manag-
ers, will encourage the adoption of management
DEMO In contrast, those external change
agents who focus on the more DEMO end of
the spectrum will more likely provide a fertile
environment for management innovation be-
cause of the “interpretive viability” of their
ideas—that is, the extent to which these ideas
can be adapted to multiple agendas (Benders &
van Veen, 2001; Clark, 2004).
External change DEMO can interact both di-
rectly and indirectly with internal change
agents in agenda setting.7 They generate their
influential points of view by linking their DEMO
pretation of changes in the environmental con-
text with agenda-setting conversations about
the practical issues executives face. They are
also influenced by prior cases DEMO management
innovation they have been involved with; in Fig-
ure 1 DEMO feedback loop is indicated by the three
horizontal processes (idea contextualizing, idea
refining, and reflective theorizing) that we dis-
cuss in greater DEMO below.
Invention Phase
Invention refers to either random or planned
variations in management practices, some of
7 An example of direct interaction is the U.K.-based “Be-
yond Budgeting Round Table” (Hope & Fraser, 2003), DEMO
founders worked actively with many organizations to help
them make sense of the limitations of their traditional bud-
geting systems. An example of indirect DEMO is Tom
Peter’s 1987 book, Thriving on Chaos, which was the inspi-
ration for an innovative organization structure at Welling-
ton, a Canadian insurance company (Birkinshaw & Mol,
2006).

which subsequently are selected and DEMO
by the organization (Burgelman, 1991; Campbell,
1965). It DEMO the phase in which a hypothetical new
practice is first tried out in an experimental way.
Internal change agents. Figure 1 suggests
three ways DEMO which internal change agents
might come up with a hypothetical new practice:
problem-driven search, trial and error, and idea
linking with external DEMO agents. While
each of these subprocesses has value in its own
right, our expectation is that invention is more
likely when they are applied in combination,
just as new technologies typically arise through
novel combinations DEMO existing ideas and prac-
tices (Hargadon, 2003: 65; Kogut & Zander, 1992;
Schumpeter, 1947).
Problem-driven search is a conscious DEMO of-
ten planned activity in which individuals seek
to create a new practice in response to a specific
problem or opportunity (Cyert & March, 1963).
Chandler’s (1962) description of Alfred Sloan’s
introduction of the M-form structure suggests a
process of this type: Sloan’s proposed changes
in 1920 were a direct response to the complexity
that had been created DEMO bringing together five
independent businesses. As Sloan himself
noted, “I wrote DEMO ‘Organizational Study’ for
General Motors as a possible solution for the
specific problems created by the expansion of
the corporation after World War I” (Sloan, 1963:
32).
Idea linking is when individuals in the orga-
nization make connections between the new
ideas proposed by external change DEMO and
the experimental efforts underway inside the
organization. Such connections can be viewed
as a form of brokering between relatively dis-
parate networks (Granovetter, 1973; Hargadon,
2003), and they can be nurtured by DEMO
individuals to read widely and to attend confer-
ences and other networking events. For exam-
ple, the concept of activity-based costing was
developed by Robert Kaplan, a business school
professor, through conversations at a conference
DEMO executives at Scovill Corporation and John
Deere Component Works about new cost mea-
surement approaches they were experimenting
with (Kaplan, 1998: 98). Kaplan had been devel-
oping his own ideas about ways of overcoming
DEMO failure of existing cost measurement sys-
tems (idea contextualizing), and DEMO Scovill and
Deere executives had been experimenting in-
side their own organizations (trial and error). But
the birth of activity-based costing per se came
when Kaplan and the corporate executives be-
gan to interact.
Finally, trial and error occurs when the feed-
back about a new idea DEMO from trying it out
in practice, rather than from how well DEMO solves
an existing problem or how well it fits with the
ideas of an external change agent. We can ex-
pect trial and error DEMO be an important part of
any effective management innovation (when un-
DEMO in combination with other activities),
but it is also possible DEMO trial and error to be an
unintended or ad hoc starting point for the
whole process. For example, furniture retailer
IKEA allowed its customers to pick up their own
flat-pack products from the warehouse because
of DEMO shortages at a busy time, and this
practice proved so effective (though in ways that
were not foreseen when it was first tried DEMO)
that it was rapidly implemented in other stores
(Bartlett & DEMO, 1990). New practices can
emerge through serendipitous events of this
DEMO, and they can also occur when an existing
practice is adapted DEMO fit different circumstances
(Czarniawska & Sevo´ n, 2005; Mamman, 2002;
Sturdy, 2004).
External change agents. The role of external
change agents in the invention phase mirrors
that of internal change agents. In DEMO words,
their ability to come up with a new idea for
management practices is a function of three of-
ten-linked activities: idea contextualizing, idea
refining, and idea linking. Idea contextualizing
involves speculating on new DEMO of working
that potentially address threats or opportunities
in the business environment. This is a common
activity among management thinkers, involving
a back-and-forth interaction between the myr-
iad of issues faced by managers on the one DEMO
and the set of possible solutions on the other.
For example, DEMO and Prusak (2003: 179)
describe how their initial ideas about knowl-
edge management emerged through the re-
search agenda of the Ernst & Young Centre for
Business Innovation.
Idea refining can be viewed as a form of dis-
ciplined imagination (Weick, 1989), in which the
DEMO change agent works through the impli-
cations of a particular idea in terms of how it
might work in practice or in other contextual
DEMO Campbell (1974) viewed this activity as
“ideational trial and error”; DEMO is directly analo-
gous to the process of trial and error that inter-
836
Academy of Management Review
nal change agents go through, but it occurs in
the conceptual domain.
Idea linking, as discussed earlier, involves
DEMO the external change agent’s knowl-
edge base (which is typically deep DEMO terms of
academic discipline or functional expertise)
with the context-specific ideas of internal
change agents. For example, activity-based
costing emerged through a combination of dis-
satisfaction with existing accounting methods
and Kaplan’s perspectives on the DEMO
pressures on manufacturing companies, but it
then required an explicit link DEMO Scovill and
Deere for the concept to be put into practice
(DEMO, 1998).
Taken together, these three activities can be
viewed as alternative but complementary ap-
proaches to theory development: idea contextu-
alizing is about developing new solutions to ex-
isting problems, idea refining is about working
through the consequences of an idea through a
series of “thought DEMO (Weick, 1989), and idea
linking is an inductive-deductive loop through
which concepts are reconciled with empirical
evidence.
Implementation Phase
The implementation phase DEMO of all the
activity on the “technical” side of the innovation
after the initial experiment up to the point where
the new management innovation DEMO first fully
operational. Like Zbaracki (1998), we distinguish
between the DEMO elements of the work and
the rhetorical elements that are concerned with
theorizing and labeling the innovation (dis-
cussed in the next section). Our description of
this phase involves making sense of the actions
of DEMO and external change agents in imple-
menting an in vivo new practice, as well as
understanding the ways existing employees re-
act to it and influence its implementation
(Lewin, 1951).
Internal change agents. Figure DEMO indicates two
primary activities that internal change agents
engage in as they attempt to implement an in
vivo new practice. One is trial and DEMO, in
which progress is achieved by monitoring and
making adjustments against DEMO original con-
cept. For example, to develop Procter & Gam-
ble’s DEMO and Develop” innovation pro-
cess, its originator, Larry Huston, observed DEMO
he ran six years of experiments before he had a
October
proven methodology for tapping into external
sources of technology (Birkinshaw, Crainer, &DEMO
Mol, 2007). The other activity is reflective exper-
imenting, in which internal change agents eval-
uate progress against their broader body of DEMO
perience. For example, Stjernberg and Philips
made the following observation about DEMO such
individuals can be most effective:
As the [innovation] attempt proceeds, he [the in-
ternal change agent] needs to be able to learn
from the consequences of his own actions and to
alter these actions DEMO He will be more
capable of seeing and learning how to manage
the change and the learning dilemmas if he has a
well-developed capacity DEMO reflection (1993: 1199).
Organizational context also plays an impor-
tant role in facilitating or inhibiting the imple-
mentation of new ideas. Zbaracki (1998) ob-
served that the reaction of employees to
implementing new management practices is
generally negative: they are likely to be intimi-
dated by innovations, particularly if the innova-
tions have a significant technical component
and the employees are mostly ignorant of their
potential benefits. But the cultural DEMO
on management innovation suggests employ-
ees’ reactions will also vary according to their
personal circumstances and the immediate
work environment in which they are DEMO
(Knights & McCabe, 2000). The implementation
process is therefore likely to involve careful ma-
neuvering by internal change agents as they
focus DEMO efforts on those parts of the organi-
zation that are more amenable to change. As the
literature on technological innovation de-
scribes, such tactics include pursuing corridors
of indifference through the organization, build-
ing coalitions of senior executives to support
their ideas, framing innovation as an opportu-
nity and not a threat, accessing resources be-
yond the individual’s control, DEMO maintaining a
generally tenacious and persistent attitude
(Howell & Shea, 2001; Rothwell et al., 1974; Scho¨n
1963; Wrapp, 1967).
Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that
implementation transpires through a dialectical
process (Van de Ven & Poole, 1995). Internal
change agents DEMO out the proposed new prac-
tice, and they evaluate its progress DEMO the
original idea (trial and error), its conceptual va-
lidity (reflective experimenting), and the reac-
tions of other employees (i.e., DEMO organizational
context). Some aspects of the new practice may
2008
prove to be unworkable, and the reactions of
employees may in some cases be directly op-
posed to what is being pursued. But DEMO sev-
eral iterations, an outcome will often emerge
that is a DEMO of the opposing forces
(Knights & McCabe, 2000; Zbaracki, 1998). In
other cases the internal resistance generated by
various aspects of DEMO organizational context
may be sufficiently strong that the experimental
new practice does not get taken forward at all.
External change agents. The role played DEMO
external change agents in the implementation
phase is less clear-cut than in other phases.
External change agents lack deep contextual
knowledge of the focal DEMO, as well as
the accountability for results that most internal
change DEMO face, so they rarely play an ac-
tive role in actually DEMO new ideas in
vivo. However, we suggest they potentially play
a DEMO indirect role in making management
innovation happen.
The essence of the external change agent’s
role is to create a thought experiment (analo-
gous to an in vitro experiment performed by a
biologist before a new molecule DEMO tried out in
vivo in a live body). External change agents
draw from their prior experience (reflective the-
orizing) and their deep DEMO of a particu-
lar conceptual domain (e.g., an academic disci-
pline or a functional competency) to sharpen
their new idea (idea refining), and on the basis
of the insights gained, they attempt to DEMO
and direct the implementation efforts of the in-
ternal change agents (DEMO testing). There is
some evidence of what this set of activities looks
like in practice. For example, Stjernberg and
Philips (1993) highlight the roles external
change agents play as facilitators and sounding
boards, and Kaplan provides a thoughtful ac-
count of his own experiences in this DEMO:
During this process of intimate engagement with
implementation, the action DEMO [i.e., the
external change agent] not only advances the
theory underlying DEMO concept, but also becomes
a skilled practitioner.... Such skill also enables
DEMO action researcher to distinguish between the-
ory limitations vs. poor implementations when
companies experience difficulties applying the
innovation (1998: 106).
These activities DEMO, as Kaplan suggests, be
thought of as a form of action research—where
the aim is to “build theories within the practice
context itself, and test them there through inter-
Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol
837
DEMO experiments” (Argyris & Scho¨ n, 1991: 86).
In terms DEMO our framing, the external change
agent therefore plays a dual role, oscillating
back and forth between his or her thought ex-
periment about DEMO might make sense in the
world of management ideas and the in vivo im-
plementation of what actually works in the
world of practice. DEMO dual role potentially of-
fers great insights to both worlds. Unfortunately,
though, the evidence suggests interventions of
this type are on the decline. While action re-
search has an illustrious past (Emery & Trist,
1960; Lewin, 1946), it has lost ground in recent
decades DEMO more passive forms of research, a
point we return to in DEMO discussion.
Theorization and Labeling Phase
The fourth phase results in a theorized new
practice— one that is retained and institutional-
ized within the organization. DEMO an effective
implementation, as described above, is clearly a
necessary part of the process, the intangible and
system-dependent nature of management inno-
vation means that the results of the implemen-
tation are likely to be DEMO unclear for several
years (Teece, 1980). We therefore expect that
there will be an important rhetorical component
associated with a successful management DEMO
vation. Key change agents will seek to make the
case with constituencies inside and outside the
organization that the new practice is legitimate,
DEMO though this new practice represents (by
definition) a departure from the tried-and-tested
offerings of the fashion-setting community
(Abrahamson, 1996; Suchman, 1995)DEMO
We view this phase as consisting of two inter-
linked elements: DEMO and labeling. The-
orization is increasing “the zone of acceptance
by creating perceptions of similarity among
adopters and by providing rationales for the
practices DEMO be adopted” (Greenwood et al., 2002;
Strang & Meyer, DEMO; Suddaby & Greenwood,
2005; Tolbert & Zucker, 1996). DEMO the context of
this article, theorization is therefore first about
building DEMO logical rationale for the link between
an organization’s opportunities and the innova-
tive solution that is being put in place, and sec-
ond about expressing that logic in terms that
resonate with key constituencies inside or DEMO
side the organization. Labeling refers to the se-
lection of a name for the management innova-
tion in question that reflects its theorization.
838
Academy of Management Review
October
Labels have been shown to have DEMO significant
effect on the acceptability of management prac-
tices to various constituencies (Eccles & Nohria,
1992; Kieser, 1997).
Internal change agents. The primary role of
internal change agents in this phase is to DEMO
legitimacy for the innovation among employees
of the organization.8 As a means of defusing the
widespread skepticism toward management in-
novation that employees often DEMO (Knights
& McCabe, 2000), internal change agents will
often theorize about the value of the new prac-
tice and label it in DEMO a way that employees
see its potential value, and also see DEMO as con-
sistent with the prevailing norms of the organi-
zation. The outcome, in other words, is a new
practice that has been DEMO vis-a` -vis the
immediate organizational context (whereas ex-
ternal change agents DEMO on theorizing be-
yond this immediate context).
It is useful to apply Suchman’s (1995) three
basic forms of legitimacy to help clarify DEMO ap-
proaches used here. Pragmatic legitimacy (ap-
pealing to employees’ self-interested DEMO
tions) is pursued by showing early evidence of
the innovation’s value DEMO by allaying employ-
ees’ concerns, but such evidence is likely to DEMO
hard to come by in the early stages of implemen-
tation. Moral legitimacy (a positive normative
evaluation through consistency with the organi-
zation’s value system) is pursued by playing up
how the innovation builds on previous changes
the company has been through and/or that the
organization has DEMO tradition of trying out new
ideas. Finally, cognitive legitimacy (the devel-
opment of plausible explanations for the inno-
vation that mesh with larger DEMO systems and
the experienced reality of the audience’s daily
life) is DEMO by showing that management
innovation is a necessary solution to a specific
and novel challenge the organization is facing
(Tolbert & Zucker, 1986)DEMO
This form of internally focused theorization
and labeling is best performed by internal
change agents because of their existing credi-
bility with employees (Stjernberg & Philips,
1993). It is achieved through a combination of
DEMO There is also potentially a role for internal change
agents in building legitimacy for external stakeholders, al-
though external change agents typically do this rather more
effectively. We discuss this possibility in the following sec-
tion.
DEMO experimenting (whereby the new
practice is interpreted in light of the DEMO
change agents’ broader body of experience) and
theory linking with external DEMO agents (by
talking to them directly, by reading their books,
or by listening to them speak).
External change agents. The role DEMO external
change agents in the theorization and labeling
phase is twofold. First, they have an important
role to play in building cognitive legitimacy in-
side the organization, because their status as
independent experts means they are brought
in—for example, as speakers at company
events—to verify both the significance of the
challenge the organization is facing and the va-
lidity of DEMO proposed innovation as a response
to that challenge. This form of input is referred
to in Figure 1 as theory linking.
External change agents DEMO play a major role
in building legitimacy for the innovation beyond
the boundaries of the organization. This is often
deemed by the organization to DEMO a worthwhile
activity, because most employees have some
level of awareness DEMO how their organization is
viewed by external constituencies (through cus-
tomers DEMO outside partners, friends, or the me-
dia), so their opinion of the innovation is shaped
to some degree by what external constituencies
DEMO about it. Influential media such as newspa-
pers and magazines have been shown in other
contexts to play an important role in legitimat-
ing DEMO actions of individual executives and or-
ganizations (Deephouse, 2000; Mazza & Alvarez,
2000; McQuail, 1985; Pollock & Rindova, 2003),DEMO
and we would expect them to play an important
role here as an indirect communication channel
through which employees’ attitudes toward the
innovation are DEMO
The externally focused theorization and la-
beling process involves a set of challenges
different from that of the internally focused
process. The external constituency DEMO typically
management intellectuals, such as senior
leaders in other organizations, journalists,
consultants, and academics (Guille´ n, 1994).
These individuals operate at a more abstract
level than employees (i.e., they are likely DEMO
focus on management ideas rather than prac-
tices), they are more positively disposed to-
ward management innovation than employees
(because they run no personal risk of failure),
and they have a less detailed understanding
of the innovation than employees. As a result
2008
Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol
of these differences, the approaches used to
build legitimacy for the innovation to external
audiences are likely to DEMO somewhat different.
Pragmatic legitimacy can only be achieved
vis-a` -vis external constituencies by demon-
strating that the innovation is yielding valu-
able outputs. Procter & Gamble claimed, for
example, that the company increased the per-
centage of new products arising from external
ideas to 40 percent as a DEMO of its Connect
and Develop innovation process (Huston &
Sakkab, DEMO). However, such evidence is rel-
atively hard to put together DEMO the early stages
of a management innovation, for the reasons
we DEMO discussed.
Moral legitimacy is pursued by seeking a
positive normative evaluation of the innova-
tion among managerial intellectuals, which
may involve showing how the innovation is
procedurally consistent with existing manage-
ment practice (e.g., Six DEMO was positioned
as a successor to total quality management;
Harry & Schroeder, 2000), or it may involve
demonstrating the credentials of the organiza-
tion as a proven high performer with a track
record of DEMO Cognitive legitimacy, in
contrast, is typically pursued by framing the
innovation as a logical solution to one of the
generic challenges or problems DEMO all large
organizations face. In Kieser’s words, “The im-
plementation of DEMO new principles is pre-
sented as unavoidable [by management gu-
rus], DEMO the old principles are bound to
fail in the face of the menacing dangers” (1997:
57). This approach is similar to the pursuit of
cognitive legitimacy with employees, except
here the arguments will be expressed in more
abstract or generic terms.
External change agents typically develop
DEMO knowledge of a particular innovation
through prolonged interactions with internal
change agents (through idea-linking, idea-
testing, and theory-linking activities) and
through their DEMO reflective theorizing. External
change agents have the skills for contextualiz-
ing the innovation in terms of contemporary
business challenges, as well as the necessary
contacts with media organizations. It should be
observed that internal change agents DEMO also
help to build legitimacy for management inno-
vation with external constituencies by writing
articles or books and speaking at conferences.
Although they may DEMO the theorization skills
839
and personal networks of external change
agents, DEMO have greater credibility through
their personal championing of the process,
which may help to establish the moral legiti-
macy of the innovation.
DISCUSSION DEMO AVENUES FOR
FUTURE RESEARCH
Here we have argued that management in-
novation is an important phenomenon in the
field of management and that the DEMO
mechanisms through which it occurs (i.e.,
management innovation processes) are theo-
retically interesting in their own right, and
also relatively poorly understood. We have de-
veloped a framework highlighting the impor-
tant roles of DEMO and external change
agents in the process and the ways these two
sets of actors interact with one another. Our
framework suggests a number DEMO important
insights, and it opens up some interesting an-
gles for DEMO research.
Sequencing of Management Innovation
Activities
We first observed that the process of manage-
ment innovation does not always proceed as a
linear sequence DEMO activities from motivation
through to theorization and labeling. For exam-
ple, DEMO organization that suffers from too much
“smart talk” (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000) may have
several initiatives that are well progressed in
terms of motivation and theorization and label-
ing, but with no commensurate investment in
invention and implementation. In such a case
the appropriate managerial intervention might
DEMO to focus attention on implementation as a
means of establishing which initiatives are
worth pursuing, whereas other organizational
settings might require different interventions.
However, at the moment we know little about
the relative effectiveness of different sequences
of activities, which makes it difficult to offer any
coherent advice to managers about how to im-
prove the quality of their interventions. DEMO
framework focuses on the “activities,” such as
trial and error, DEMO take place between the ad-
jacent cells in Table 1 as a means of highlight-
ing that innovation is an iterative process. But
an DEMO next step in making sense of the
840
overall process of management innovation
would be to examine the actual DEMO and
phasing of activities over time. While some in-
novations may follow a linear sequence of ac-
tivities from left to right, others do not; for exam-
ple, Procter & Gamble’s Connect and Develop
program DEMO developed as a concept by its
champion, Larry Huston, long before the compa-
ny’s CEO articulated the need for it (Birkinshaw
et al., 2007). Likewise, while we would expect
most management innovations to DEMO initiated
primarily by internal change agents, it is possi-
ble to DEMO others, such as T-Groups (Benne,
1964; Blake, 1995), where many of the core activ-
ities were driven by external change DEMO
Future research should attempt to map out and
make sense of the sequences that actually occur
in practice. The historical record is not particu-
DEMO helpful in this regard, because writers will
typically impose their own DEMO on a pro-
cess in order to make sense of it. Research will
therefore need to be done on contemporary
cases, and, where DEMO, these cases should
be followed in real time to avoid problems DEMO
retrospective sensemaking bias.
The Role of Internal and External Change
Agents
Another core element of our framework is the
distinction between internal and external
DEMO agents. As a matter of definition, inter-
nal change agents are DEMO of the focal
organization whereas external change agents
are not, which, in turn, implies that internal
change agents will typically have superior
knowledge and networks inside the organiza-
tion and greater accountability for delivering
results DEMO their external counterparts. How-
ever, it is important for future research DEMO con-
sider this distinction more carefully, since it
may not always DEMO clear-cut in practice. Con-
sultants, for example, are sometimes seconded
to their client companies during a change pro-
cess, and ethnographic researchers will often
become employees in the organizations they are
studying for significant periods DEMO time. In both
cases these external actors actually become in-
ternal actors on a temporary basis. Moreover,
there is evidence that some individuals DEMO able
to switch back and forth between internal and
external change agent roles during a single
project (i.e., as action researchers), while DEMO
Academy of Management Review
October
oscillate between the two roles over the course
of their careers (Davenport & Prusak, 2003).
One avenue DEMO further research, then, is to
take a closer look at the key change agents
involved in management innovation and the ex-
tent to DEMO they are able to take on hybrid
internal/external roles. A second line of inquiry
might be to consider the extent to which internal
DEMO external change agents are acting in har-
mony. Here we have assumed that both parties
have a more or less common objective—namely,
to DEMO a successful management innova-
tion. However, future research might want to
DEMO this assumption and consider the extent to
which the two parties are truly aligned. For ex-
ample, in attempting to build legitimacy for a
management innovation among internal and
external constituencies, internal change agents
may downplay the scale of change required to
their colleagues (perhaps by emphasizing con-
sistency with prior norms or a low level of risk)
to DEMO the change more palatable, while ex-
ternal change agents may exaggerate DEMO scale
of the proposed innovation (perhaps by position-
ing it as DEMO antidote to dramatic changes in the
industry) as a way of DEMO interest among
external audiences. These differences in posi-
tioning can potentially have deleterious conse-
quences for the individuals involved, as well as
for the long-term success of the innovation.
A third avenue for future research that DEMO
builds on the internal versus external distinc-
tion is to examine the locus of management in-
novation. Our framework assumes that it is
possible DEMO meaningful to identify the organi-
zation in which a new management practice is
first implemented. While this approach is valid
vis-a` -vis the existing DEMO we mentioned, there
may be cases where it is less valid DEMO the future.
Increasingly, economic activity transpires
through nonfirm networks, such as open-source
software communities, so we can expect innova-
tive ways of organizing to emerge that enable
nonfirm coordination of this type. It is also DEMO
sible, although less likely, that more manage-
ment innovations will emerge in vitro in the
future, perhaps through the efforts of academics
rather than the trial and error of practicing man-
agers, in which case the locus of innovation,
again, would not be the organization. Future
studies should therefore give careful attention
to the unit of analysis at DEMO management
2008
innovation is studied, since there are several
possible models that could be followed.
Management Innovation and Management
Fashion
We have argued that the DEMO inno-
vation process is triggered when the market for
fashion fails—that is, when an organization pur-
sues its own novel practice rather than one sug-
gested by the fashion-setting community. How-
ever, this argument obscures the important
point that, in many ways, the management fash-
ion process DEMO important similarities to the
management innovation process: both involve
significant roles DEMO internal change agents
(Abrahamson [1996] calls them “users” of man-
agement DEMO) and external change agents
(“suppliers” of management fashions), as well
as complex interactions between the two. And
both can be framed in DEMO lan-
guage—in terms of the introduction of some-
thing new to the organization that subsequently
gets selected and retained, or not.
A useful direction for future research, then, will
be to look more closely at DEMO the processes of
management innovation and management fash-
ion interact. It may be possible, for example, to
identify ways in which external change DEMO,
such as consultants, influence the emergence of
management innovation, either by suppressing
the level of novelty in the focal organization’s cho-
sen DEMO (e.g., by pushing their own off-the-
shelf solutions, regardless of DEMO user’s agenda) or
by enhancing it (e.g., by encouraging users DEMO de-
velop their own agendas and by putting forward
ideas with interpretive viability). Another ap-
proach might be to examine the conditions under
DEMO a management innovation gets picked up
by the fashion-setting community and turned into
a management fashion. At an abstract level such
practices are likely DEMO have highly “progressive”
and contemporary labels (Abrahamson, 1996) and
are DEMO to exhibit high levels of external change
agent involvement, but there DEMO room for a much
greater level of clarity on what these conditions
look like in detail.
Management Innovation and Firm Performance
While our focus DEMO this article was primarily on
process issues, questions about why individuals
DEMO in management innovation and the extent
Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol
841
to which management innovation helps organiza-
tions to fulfill their goals are DEMO important. It
seems likely, for example, that certain manage-
ment innovations will offer more potential for
competitive advantage than others, depending on
the extent to which they are valuable, rare, and
hard to imitate (Barney, 1991), but this argument
remains open to empirical testing.
The consequences of management innovation
are complex, because so many different stake-
holders are potentially affected. It is necessary to
separate out at least three DEMO sets of conse-
quences: (1) the impact of management innovation
DEMO various performance metrics inside the inno-
vating firm; (2) the DEMO on the performance and
legitimacy of subsequent adopters of the innova-
tion; and (3) the benefits of management innova-
tion to society as a whole, in terms of improve-
ments of such things as productivity or quality of
work life. As noted earlier, there has been some
research on the second of these (e.g., Staw & Ep-
stein, 2000), but the first and third remain largely
unexplored. Future research DEMO therefore ex-
amine why certain types of management innova-
tion take longer to yield dividends than others,
whether some management innovations spur
waves DEMO related innovation, and how often and
under what circumstances management innova-
DEMO creates firm-specific competitive advantage.
The Role of Academia in Management
Innovation
Finally, this article offers some initial thoughts
on the role academics can play in the process of
management innovation. Like Abrahamson and
Fairchild (2001), we are concerned that academics
may be losing out to other members DEMO the fashion-
setting community, such as consultants and gu-
rus, in terms of their ability to influence practice.
Our framework suggests some possible DEMO for-
ward. One is for academics to become more cre-
ative in the development of new ideas and
thought experiments that organizations might put
DEMO practice. Another is to become more engaged
in the activity we call “idea testing,” whereby the
academic engages closely with the focal organi-
DEMO and brings his or her insight to bear on the
particular problem the organization is grappling
with. This concept of engaged scholarship (Van de
Ven & Johnson, 2006) has a long history, but its
legitimacy as a valid form of scholarship has fal-
tered in recent decades. DEMO alternative is a
842
Academy of Management Review
October
management innovation laboratory, such as Lon-
don Business Schools’ MLab, where researchers
and practitioners come together to develop new
practices in partnership.
These suggestions require further exploration,
both in DEMO of the nature of the interventions
they would require and in the outcomes they
would achieve. They also challenge many of the
traditional orthodoxies DEMO the profession, in that
they are likely to involve new methodologies
DEMO are unproven and hard to implement. But
we believe they are worth pursuing. A more
active role for management scholars in the pro-
cess DEMO management innovation would be of
value to innovating organizations, and it DEMO
allow them to reclaim their previously influen-
tial role as creators of both new and useful man-
agement knowledge.
