CONFLICTS BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURS, VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND ANGEL INVESTORS:
THE IMPACT OF UNETHICAL PRACTICES
ABSTRACT
We study the impact of unethical practices on conflicts DEMO entrepreneurs, angel investors and
venture capitalists. Utilizing a process conflict theory DEMO, we examine how unethical practices
affect conflicts in terms of its DEMO and consequences. For this purpose, we use eleven case studies
of DEMO and/or venture capital-backed ventures from which we develop propositions. These
propositions aim to highlight how perceived unethical behaviour amongst venture partners affects the
DEMO making of, reaction to and consequences of their conflicts. This paper DEMO contributes to the
entrepreneurship literature by addressing the call for more research on the darker sides of investor-
investee relationships and the call for DEMO research connecting the fields of entrepreneurship and
ethics. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Risk capital markets DEMO inherently inefficient due to reputation effects, knowledge
specialization and high search DEMO negotiation costs (Cable and Shane, 1997; Mason, 2006). As this
makes replacement of either investor or entrepreneur both hard and expensive, a long-term cooperative
relationship between the two parties generally tends to be DEMO best solution for portfolio company
success (Cable and Shane, 1997; DEMO and van Witteloostuijn, 2006). Some scholars have even
suggested that DEMO relationship between investors and entrepreneurs may be more important to the
success of the venture than the actual capital provided (Payne et al., DEMO). However, as in any human
venture, this collaboration has not been without its problems and can involve highly emotional and
volatile relations (Sapienza and Korsgaard, 1996). Research has indicated that conflicts between angel
investors, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are nothing but a common event and can substantially
affect company performance (Collewaert, 2009; Higashide and Birley, DEMO; Parhankangas and
Landström, 2006; Yitshaki, 2008). Despite this, DEMO looking into the ―darker‖ sides of these
relationships is still lacking (DEMO and Landström, 2006, p. 775).
2
We aim to address this gap in the literature by more closely DEMO conflicts between
and among angel investors, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, with conflicts being defined as
perceived incompatibilities between the parties involved (Jehn, DEMO). According to process theories
of conflict, conflict can be seen DEMO a temporal sequence of events or episodes (Pondy, 1967; Thomas,DEMO
1992). Drawing on this theory, we examine and develop propositions DEMO to how perceived unethical
behaviour by either investor or entrepreneur affects conflict sense making, manifestation (i.e. reactions
to conflict awareness) and outcomes. Consistent with the business ethics literature on stakeholder
relations, unethical practices can take on many forms: unfair competition, unfair communication,
unfair methods, non-respect of agreement and outright fraud (Crane and Matten, 2004; Fassin, DEMO).
While studies connecting ethics and entrepreneurship have been mushrooming recently
(DEMO, 2003), research on the topic is still in a relatively DEMO state (Harris et al., 2009, p.
407). From an DEMO perspective, scholars have acknowledged the importance of ethical
behaviour in investor-entrepreneur DEMO by pointing to its positive association with trust and
cooperation (Amatucci DEMO Sohl, 2004; Manigart et al., 2002; Van Osnabrugge, 2000), but are yet to
study its effects explicitly. From a business ethics standpoint, ethical issues have been studied in
alliances or joint ventures (DEMO, 1999), in negotiation (Levicki et al., 1994) and in managing
interpersonal conflict in organizations (Rahim et al., 1992), but DEMO problems in the relations
between entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and angel investors DEMO hardly been addressed (Sapienza
and Korsgaard, 1996). Despite various relationship dilemmas potentially leading to complex ethical
problems in this setting (Dees and Starr, 1992), little is thus known as to how perceived unethical
behaviour affects the investor-entrepreneur relationship.
Similarly, research connecting the business ethics and conflict literatures is also lacking. This
is quite surprising given that both DEMO streams often refer to one another. For instance, conflict
situations are DEMO used in business ethics studies to describe unethical standards or practices
(DEMO and Ims, 2004). Likewise, conflict literature has referred to ethical behaviour as an
equally important outcome to study as conflict (Carpenter et al., 2004), a prerequisite for conflict
3
management to be effective (Rahim et al., 1992) and has pointed to differences in work ethics as a
potential cause of conflict (Keyton and Beck, 2008). While these could all be legitimate claims to
make, they are yet to be tested. With this study, we DEMO to take the integration of these two strands of
literature one step further.
From a practical perspective, we believe our study is also warranted based on the following.
As conflicts between and among entrepreneurs, angel investors and venture capitalists can have both
beneficial and detrimental effects (Collewaert, DEMO; Higashide and Birley, 2002), all parties involved
should gain a better understanding of its functioning. Furthermore, new venture partners are
confronted with an enormous range of ethical issues and dilemmas (Harris et al., DEMO). Raising funds
for a capital increase with external partners is a perilous exercise of negotiation, which are renowned
for being hotbeds of dubious practices. Ethical issues can furthermore present themselves throughout
the different stages of DEMO start-up process, from idea or research project to successful company, and
can concern numerous topics, such as intellectual property, confidentiality of information DEMO insider
trading (Fassin, 2000). Recognizing the importance of ethics in a finance setting, it has become
common practice for venture capital and angel investor associations to install a code of conduct. As an
illustration, the European Venture Capital Association‘s  members are not allowed to ―disclose
confidential, financial or technical information acquired in the course of negotiation or business with
investees‖, ―to use their funds to promote the welfare or assist its directors‖ and ―shall deal fairly and
honestly with all business concerns DEMO its assistance‖ (EVCA, 2005). Angel investors are
expected to abide similar rules (EBAN, 2009). As governments, scholars and practitioners are calling
for more accountability for all parties involved, we believe it is crucial to study the (un)ethical
behaviour of entrepreneurs, angel investors DEMO venture capitalists in more detail and how it affects
their relationship dynamics.
In what follows, we provide an overview of the process theory of conflict, linking it to
entrepreneurial finance research where possible, and discuss DEMO ethical dilemmas embedded in these
partnerships. Next, we describe the case DEMO method applied and develop propositions based on
4
the findings. We then conclude with a discussion of the implications and DEMO consequences to
potential future research.
A PROCESS MODEL OF CONFLICT
Process models of conflict depict conflict as a temporal sequence of events or episodes
(Pondy, 1967; Thomas, 1976; 1992).1 According to this model, conflict originates with latent
conditions, such as goal incompatibilities, scarce resources, personal differences, interference in
reaching goals, inefficient communication and interdependency (Bartos and Wehr, 2002; Kochan et
al., 1976; Pondy, 1967). All of these elements are present in the relationship between and among DEMO
investors, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, although the extent to which can vary. For instance, as
financial resources represent the core element of the relationship between angel investors and venture
capitalists on the one hand and DEMO on the other hand, a certain degree of competition over
these DEMO is inherent. In addition, a power struggle - a similarly crucial DEMO resource (Benson,
1975) - can take place between investors and entrepreneurs as they try to decide on the strategic
direction to set DEMO the venture and each tries to assume control over the company (DEMO, 1991).
Under these circumstances, investor involvement can be perceived as a time-consuming, interfering
activity rather than a value-adding one from the entrepreneur‘s perspective (De Clercq et al., 2006),
hence providing fertile grounds for conflict. Similarly, when venture capitalists enter new alliances can
be formed and existing alliances can be changed. As such, power and control issues, i.e. scarce
resources, come into play. This is illustrated by the DEMO that some venture capitalists refuse to co-
invest with angel investors as they find them ―too difficult to deal with‖ (Harrison and Mason, DEMO, p.
234).
Through interaction between parties, a sense-making process is started in which individuals try
to understand what is going on, appraise their exchanges and attribute an unfavourable judgment to the
1 While recent DEMO in the intragroup conflict literature have taken into account several other aspects of intragroup
conflict, such as its multilevel nature (Korsgaard et al., 2008), these models still reflect the dynamic nature of conflict as
DEMO several temporal phases, going from inputs to outcomes through interactions and DEMO making.

other party (Thomas, 1976). Also referred to as naming and DEMO, this comprises the process
whereby individuals perceive an injurious event, label it as such and attribute the fault to someone or
something else (Felstiner et al., 1980). In doing so, parties evolve from DEMO to perceived conflict
(Pondy, 1967). As acknowledged by several conflict scholars, the mere presence of latent conditions,
as defined for instance by task structure or social context (Korsgaard et al., 2008), DEMO not necessarily
lead to perceived conflict (Pondy, 1967; Deutsch, 1973). Certain conditions can serve as suppression
mechanisms, making conflicts seem less threatening to parties involved and hence weaken or, in some
cases, DEMO block the link between latent and perceived conflicts (Pondy, 1967). A similar effect
is obtained by attention-focus mechanisms whereby individuals, given limited time and cognitive
capacity, will tend to focus on the most important conflicts and ignore the less important ones (Pondy,
1967).
Conflict awareness or perception, in turn, elicits a variety of affective (e.g. anger, distress),
cognitive (e.g. expectations of future problems) and DEMO reactions (e.g. aggression). As soon as
an issue is conceptualized DEMO conflict, any further behavior can be seen as a form of DEMO or
dealing with that conflict (Van de Vliert, 1997). One can try to collaborate with the other party as to
solve the DEMO, one can use more competitive tactics to achieve one‘s goals or DEMO can try avoiding
the problem altogether (De Dreu et al., 1999; De Dreu and Gelfand, 2007). The only study to date
DEMO into how venture capitalists manage their conflicts with entrepreneurs concluded that
investors, on average, tend to adopt rather active and cooperative conflict management DEMO
(Parhankangas and Landström, 2006). Resonating with the contingency view adhered to in the conflict
literature (Jehn and Bendersky, 2003), this DEMO stated that the final choice of which particular
conflict management strategy to be employed, will depend on a combination of ―actors-, relationship-
and DEMO factors‖ (Parhankangas and Landström, 2006, p. 778). Further, as conflicts persist
in time and more aggressive tactics are used, conflicts have a tendency to escalate and will become
exceedingly difficult to undo (Rubin et al., 1994; Van de Vliert, 1997). Conflicts not only intensify
due to more aggressive behaviour (which will likely be reciprocated by the other party), but also due
to more negative perceptions of DEMO attitudes towards the other party, weakened social ties with that
6
other party and communication problems between conflicting parties (Rubin et al., DEMO; Friedman
and Currall, 2003).
Finally, perceived conflicts will have DEMO effect on the partnership of the parties involved.
While even early conflict scholars acknowledged the dual nature of conflict, which was then labeled
constructive and destructive conflict (Deutsch, 1973), much has since then been DEMO about
conflict‘s multidimensional nature. The essence of what these scholars have been trying to capture is
that conflict can have both beneficial and detrimental DEMO While it is generally acknowledged that
conflict is rarely good for morale, there is more debate concerning its effects on performance (De Dreu
DEMO Gelfand, 2007; Jehn and Bendersky, 2003). Some argue that DEMO increase information
sharing, critical evaluation and assessment of alternatives, diverse opinions and perspectives, which
should lead to more creativity and innovation (Baron, 1984; De Dreu and West, 2001). Others,
however, argue that conflicts consume cognitive resources and produce stress and tension, blocking
information handling and processing, both of which reduce the capacity for creative thinking and
hence impede innovation (Pelled, 1996; Jehn and Bendersky, 2003)DEMO This debate has also extended to
research on the investor-investee partnership; DEMO and Birley (2002) for instance revealed that
task-related conflicts between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs enhanced venture performance (as
perceived by the venture capitalist), while affective conflicts had the opposite effect. In contrast,
Zacharakis DEMO al. (2010) found that task-related disagreements decreased the entrepreneur‘s confidence
in partner cooperation with their venture capitalists. More recently scholars have acknowledged that
DEMO dividing conflict into a good and a bad type is not enough. Therefore a conflict contingency
framework was proposed (Jehn and Bendersky, 2003)DEMO According to this framework, conflict‘s impact
will vary depending on three DEMO: (i) the type of conflict, (ii) the type of outcome studied and (iii)
moderating influences.
While scholars have tried to advance our understanding of conflicts between and among angel
investors, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, the overview provided above clearly illustrate that
much remains to be learned regarding the entire conflict process. Using this process model of DEMO
7
as a departure point for our analysis of the impact of perceived DEMO behaviour on conflicts
between and among angel investors, venture capitalists and DEMO should hence prove useful.
UNETHICAL PRACTICES IN THE ENTREPRENEUR – ANGEL INVESTOR – VENTURE
CAPITALIST TRIANGLE
Business life, and consequently entrepreneurship, is confronted DEMO a gamut of ethical issues
(Harris et al., 2009). Entrepreneurs face challenging ethical problems. More than the classical ethical
issues managers encounter, entrepreneurs are also confronted with the ethical dilemmas of being the
owner DEMO the company. Research connecting ethics and entrepreneurship is therefore receiving
increasing scholarly attention (Hannafey, 2003; Harris et al., 2009). Besides ethics DEMO
entrepreneurship, literature on ethics and finance is scarce. In order to DEMO an overview of the
potential ethical issues that can affect investor-entrepreneur conflicts, we borrow from the business
ethics literature on stakeholder relations. As such, unethical practices can appear in many forms: unfair
competition, unfair communication, unfair methods, non-respect of agreement and outright fraud
(Crane and Matten, 2004; Fassin, 2005).
Whereas unfair competition involves practices such as stealing customers from rivals,
industrial espionage and stealing trade secrets (Crane and Matten, 2004), communication can be
considered unfair when the information provided does not correspond with the real, objective facts or
when important elements are omitted (Gibson, 2007). Unfair methods, such as deception, clever rules
and a number of dirty tricks (Brenkert, 2008), refer to the unfair treatment of stakeholders through
power abuse or due DEMO a conflict of interest (Crane and Matten, 2004). An abuse of power occurs when
an individual or a group uses the power DEMO in an organization for its own purposes.
Situations of conflicts of interest occur ―when a personal interest interferes (or could potentially
interfere) with DEMO ability of the person to serve the interests of the others‖ (DEMO, 1999, p. 44).
Conflicts of interest are omnipresent in business, and consequently, also in finance (Boatright, 1999).
A conflict DEMO interest in and of itself does not necessarily imply unethical behavior, DEMO can quickly
8
become so when one privileges his or her own interest above that DEMO others. Another unethical practice
often referred to is the non-respect of agreements. Cooperation and partnerships are generally based on
agreements. Those agreements can be DEMO down in contracts or documents, they can be verbal and,
DEMO some cases, they can even be implicit (Parhankangas and Landström, DEMO). Many business
situations present conditions where one of the parties involved does not completely fulfil all the
stipulations of the agreement. Promises are DEMO or contracts are violated. In some cases, unmet
expectations create the DEMO of unfair treatment through the breach of an implicit agreement.
Non-respect of agreements often results from opportunistic behaviour of one of the parties, either
deliberately or involuntarily.
Finally, there are rather exceptional occurrences of fraud in
entrepreneurial ventures, which can involve forged data or documents, counterfeited signatures,DEMO
corruption and other practices flirting with or crossing the legal borderline (DEMO George, 2006).
METHOD
Research design
In order to answer the DEMO research question ―how does perceived unethical behavior by
entrepreneurs, angel investors DEMO venture capitalists affect their relationship dynamics in general and
their conflicts in specific?”, this study utilizes case studies on eleven companies that received
financing from angel and/or venture capital investors. Whereas case studies might DEMO be suited to
study questions like ―how often do unethical behaviours occur between investors and entrepreneurs?‖
or ―how many conflicts occur between angel DEMO and venture capitalists?‖, they are however
particularly well-suited to study DEMO and ―why‖ questions (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). As
such, DEMO can contribute to the existing knowledge by widening and deepening our understanding of
the dynamics and ethical issues at play between angel investors, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists,
hence enriching the conflict framework described above. Put DEMO, these case studies can help us
to start filling the gaps DEMO the existing literature on conflicts and ethics between external investors and
entrepreneurs (Siggelkow, 2007). Furthermore, even though single case studies can provide powerful
examples of exceptional phenomena (Siggelkow, 2007), we opted for DEMO multiple-case strategy as the
9
results this provides are typically better grounded than those of single-case studies (Eisenhardt, 1989;
Yin, 1994).
The eleven angel and/or DEMO capital-backed companies were selected using a theoretical
sampling procedure (Eisenhardt, 1989; Strauss and Corbin, 1998). Considering there are no direct
means DEMO identify conflictual investor-entrepreneur relationships, cases were selected based on
information collected DEMO a previous research project (as in Ucbasaran et al., 2003a). For this
research, conducted from 2006 to 2008, a sample was DEMO together of risk-capital backed companies in
Continental Europe (Belgium) and the USA (California)2. As the focus of this project was on conflicts
between external investors and entrepreneurs (and the impact thereof), data were gathered concerning
the nature of these conflicts. Out of all 88 companies DEMO which conflict information was obtained,
eleven cases were selected as to represent a wide range in conflicts between angel investors, venture
capitalists and/or entrepreneurs in terms of their subject matter. Table 1 provides an DEMO of the
companies selected for this multiple case-study and illustrates the variety in and complexity of their
conflicts (see Appendix A for more elaborate case conflict descriptions).
*** Insert Table 1 about here ***
Each DEMO the conflict causes as put forward in traditional conflict literature is represented at
least once in the cases. Even though most cases represent examples DEMO investor-entrepreneur conflicts,
one case also included disputes among investors (case DEMO). Further, of the eleven cases used, three were
from the US and eight were from Belgium. Variation is also present in terms DEMO the industries these
companies operate in, ranging from basic consumer goods DEMO retailing to more high-tech activities
such as life sciences. Finally, of DEMO eleven cases studied, four had failed prior to and two during DEMO
study (cases B and D). All others were active during DEMO study and remained so afterwards. For those
2 This consisted of 305 and 1265 companies, respectively, whom were all contacted by telephone (Belgium) or
email (California) and asked a filter question to verify their angel- or venture capital-backed nature. Using open
questions, conflict information was gathered from at least one of the parties involved for 47 Belgian and DEMO
Californian ventures. More details on this sample are available from the authors upon request, but were not
included as to not to distort blinded peer review.

who had already ceased operations, failure took place less than six months prior to data collection. In
addition, the active ventures we studied had received risk capital financing maximum five years prior
to the time of DEMO first interview. Together this should hence limit the risk of recall bias among our
informants (Graebner and Eisenhardt, 2004). Combining these cases DEMO allows for a combination of
retrospective and real-time data (Eisenhardt and DEMO, 2007). While the former allows for efficient
data collection, the latter should enhance our understanding of how unethical practices affect the
conflict DEMO in investor-entrepreneur partnerships. The variety in our cases in terms of conflict
topics, geographic location, industry and current status should thus increase the DEMO of our
results (Graebner and Eisenhardt, 2004).
Data sources
We used several data sources including (1) semi-structured interviews conducted face-to-face,
DEMO telephone or through email with investor(s), entrepreneur(s) or DEMO, (2) emails and phone calls to
follow up interviews and (3) additional information including investor-entrepreneur email
correspondence (provided by the informant), survey data regarding the relationship between investors
and entrepreneurs for previous research project respondents (6 out of 11 cases) 3 and statutory required
DEMO for the Belgian companies on capital increases, shareholder structure and composition DEMO
board of directors (as well as any modifications thereof) and company status.
Interviews were conducted with entrepreneurs, angel investors, venture capitalists or DEMO
combination thereof. Initial interviews began with background information, such as investment DEMO,
founding year, time of investment, number of members on the entrepreneurial team and investors on
the Board of Directors4. We then asked DEMO to relate what they most frequently argue (or had
argued in DEMO of failed ventures) about with their partners. This question was idiosyncratically
DEMO for each case, depending on whether the informant was an investor DEMO entrepreneur and
3 Cases B, D, E, F, G and I had participated in the larger conflict research project by completing questionnaires.
DEMO The entrepreneurial team was defined as those individuals who, at the DEMO of the study, each had an equity
stake and were actively DEMO or played a key role in strategic decision making (Ucbasaran et DEMO, 2003b).
Investors on the Board of Directors were our target DEMO as a minimum threshold of active participation was
required for there to be a possibility of conflict.
11
whether financing was received from angel investors, venture capitalists or both. Such open-ended
questions should increase the accuracy of retrospective reports (Miller et al., 1997). Follow-up
interviews mainly focused on clarification or the further development of the partnership and allowed
for cross-checking of information gathered during the DEMO interviews. Interviews generally took
between 60 to 90 minutes.
Considering the sensitive nature of conflicts and unethical behavior, it was not always possible
to collect data from all parties and sides involved. For two cases, information could only be gathered
from the angel investor(s) involved in the particular case (cases A and I), whereas for five other cases
the CEO was our only key informant (cases B, C, G, H and K). Reasons included ongoing lawsuits
(cases A, B and K) or the fear of retributions (cases C, G, DEMO and I). For the four remaining cases,
information was retrieved from both investors and entrepreneurs. The multiple case study method
adopted has DEMO ambition of representativeness but provides an indicative illustration of the variety in
terms of conflict topics and (un)ethical practices involved. Together, these DEMO provide diverse
views, i.e. from the perspective of investors and entrepreneurs, on the topic at hand (Eisenhardt and
Graebner, 2007). As DEMO is generally defined as the perception or experience of incompatibilities
between parties involved, it is very much an individual experience or intra-individual phenomenon
(DEMO et al., 2008). Therefore, even though the conflicts under study are interpersonal in nature in
that they involve more than one person, the individual perception is key and will be the starting point
for DEMO analysis.
Data analysis
Cases were analyzed by both authors independently and subsequently cross-checked using
within- and cross-case analysis (Eisenhardt, 1989). Through the DEMO analysis we aimed to gain
a thorough understanding of the conflicts present in terms of its causes and participants as well as the
unethical DEMO adopted (if any).5 Using these findings, we then went on to conduct a cross-case

analysis in order to examine similarities and differences between cases in terms DEMO the effects of
ethical issues involved on the conflict process. In the section below, we first present an overview of
the unethical practices found in our cases and then go on to analyzing its effects on DEMO conflict
process. In addition, propositions are derived from the case study DEMO and existing literature.
CASE ANALYSIS
Analysis of unethical practices
The eleven cases are analysed according to the different types of unethical practices set out
DEMO in the paper. A summary is presented in the second column of table 2.
*** Insert Table 2 about here ***
Our cases present DEMO forms of unfair competition: one venture capitalist invests in a
competitor DEMO informing the entrepreneur (case H) and another one manages to steal a deal away
from one of his venture capital competitors using unfair DEMO (case K). In two other cases (new)
investors try to sidestep the entrepreneur (case B) or other investors (case I) and try to eliminate them
with all means available. Unfair communication is applied by presenting overoptimistic information –
hence not corresponding with reality - (cases I and F) and withholding crucial information for reasons
of hidden agenda (cases A, B and H). In case J, communication on commissions and finder fees was
deliberately held vague and in case DEMO the investor launches rumours in the venture capital community
about the bad shape of the venture. Examples of abuse of power include investors imposing
DEMO contracts on entrepreneurs (cases J and K) or the unfair treatment or elimination through
questionable methods of minority shareholders, such as forcing them to sell their shares at reduced
price or, the opposite, blocking DEMO investment (cases I and K). In case H the investor DEMO wanting to
integrate this venture into its competitor – does everything within his power to reach that goal
perception is recognized in ethics‘ research (McIntyre and Capen, 1993). What might be ethical for one is not
necessarily for another. Cognizant of its underlying meaning, we will use the terms ‗unethical practices‘ and
‗perceived unethical behaviour‘ interchangeably for the remainder DEMO this paper.
13
including draining the venture as to force to the entrepreneur to go DEMO with this plan. In the end, the
entrepreneur is forced to DEMO back his shares. Examples of privileging her/his own interests against
company interests include entrepreneurs or investors billing excessive costs (cases A and F),
entrepreneurs negotiating a better remuneration for themselves with new investors without the
previous investors‘ agreement (case I), venture capitalists recovering their investment through
excessive fees (case J) and exercising a capital increase, deliberately resulting in a high dilution of the
entrepreneurs‘ shares (cases H, DEMO and K). Further, the cases also present illustrations of non-respect DEMO
agreements; an investor refuses to provide the follow-on round of financing DEMO good reason (case
B), an entrepreneur does not fulfil his DEMO of bringing in assets (case A) or fails to ensure
additional funding (case B). Another example is case K where the venture capitalist fails to bring in an
international partner, which he had promised to do. Outright fraud occurs in cases A and H where the
DEMO is deliberately falsified or concealed to mislead the investor (case A) or to manipulate the
entrepreneur (case H). Finally, no unethical DEMO are observed in cases C, D, E and G.
Analysis of the conflict process
We then turn to the analysis of the impact DEMO unethical practices on the conflict process. Table
2 presents a systematic overview of the unethical practices in each case, followed by the sense making
and perception of the conflict by the actors, the reaction to conflict and the outcome of the conflict
process.
Cases varied considerably in terms DEMO sense-making processes and appraisals related to
conflicts. For instance, consistent with DEMO research (Yitshaki, 2008), goal incompatibilities were
among the most important causes of conflicts between investors and entrepreneurs (present in all cases
except case D). Appraisal of parties involved, however, varied considerably between DEMO depending
on whether or not unethical practices had been adopted in order to attain those incompatible goals.
Cases C, E and G all represent examples of investors being focused on the financial side of the
equation, while entrepreneurs are focused on the technology or product. These incompatible goals DEMO
14
turn caused disagreements concerning how to allocate resources (case E) or DEMO to inject additional
funds (cases C and G). Evidence for DEMO investors‘ focus on financials is found in case G:
In his heart, he thinks this technology will help patients and will make back all of
the money he lost post-Lehman. To be clear, he is driven by both ideals, but he
understands that to make money in biotech…you must make a difference at the
bedside.
While the entrepreneur was DEMO frustrated by his angel investor, whom he initially
labeled ‗devil investor‘, holding back multiple projects, he also understood why the investor did so.
One can however hardly blame investors wanting to take care of their DEMO under management for
behaving unethically, something which is also reflected in DEMO affected parties‘ sense making of the
conflict events. In trying to explain what went wrong, the entrepreneur in case C summarizes it as
follows:
Looking back, I was not the right man for this story. While I still believe that the
business idea was good, doing business in China involves a lot of politics, which is
something I‘m no good at...the angel investors were mainly convinced by our
China expert, whose fame made them dream of a quick return. China-related
numbers are always DEMO, but we probably made a wrong estimation.
The entrepreneur indirectly exonerates DEMO investors for refusing to provide follow-on
financing and furthermore takes up part of the responsibility for the venture going haywire by
admitting he inaccurately DEMO competencies required and market potential.
This sense-making and fault attribution process of interactions between investors and
entrepreneurs quickly turns negative when unethical practices are DEMO For instance, in case A
where the entrepreneur provided untruthful information DEMO and did not respect his agreement with the
investor regarding him bringing in assets and, furthermore, committed fraud by embezzling money,
the DEMO investor is left with the following thought:
If I were to call myself a business angel, then I should call my partner a business
devil…Why did it go wrong? Maybe I should have screened the entrepreneur
15
better, but, you know, a real conman always goes about it cleverly…I keep hoping
and fighting not to lose everything, but angel investing has left a nasty taste. I‘m
trying to forget that nightmare as DEMO as possible.
While the investor does not excuse himself completely, he DEMO blames the entrepreneur and
holds him responsible for this failed investment experience. Similar feelings of anger, frustration and
disapproval are found in other cases where informants were confronted with unethical practices. The
CEO of case H DEMO instance tries to explain the venture capitalist‘s behavior as follows:
I‘m assuming they thought ‗at least one of them will survive‘. But what DEMO can‘t
understand is how they think this [investing in competing companies] is
reconcilable from a corporate governance perspective. How can you have both
companies‘ DEMO interests at heart?...The only thing they are interested in is their
financial self-interest, how their actions affect the entrepreneur‘s motivation is
clearly irrelevant.
Taken together, we argue that this evidence suggests that when investors or entrepreneurs
perceive unethical behavior from their venture partners‘ side, their interaction, DEMO and hence
conflicts are looked at much more negatively and seen as a far bigger hurdle to the respective
partnership compared to when no DEMO practices had been perceived. Whereas understanding,
exoneration and shared responsibility prevailed in the latter cases, blaming and holding the other party
accountable prevailed in the former ones. Sense making pertaining to labeling the events as DEMO
and blaming another party for deviating from norms, i.e. naming and DEMO (Felstiner et al., 1980;
Korsgaard et al., 2008), DEMO propose this suggests that conflict sense making turns more negative when
unethical practices are involved. Ethical behavior among venture partners could hence serve as DEMO
suppression mechanism so that partners do not perceive conflicts as quickly (DEMO conceptualize them as
such) compared to when unethical practices have been DEMO This discussion hence leads us to the
following proposition:
Proposition 1: The perception of unethical behavior by investors or entrepreneurs will mitigate
conflict antecedents’ effects in that it will increase the chance of conflict perception.
DEMO
With regard to the next phase in the conflict process, actors responded quite differently to the
various conflict situations in our cases. For instance, the angel investor in case D stated:
I‘ve given up on DEMO D. We [the Board] repeatedly warned the management
to focus. The entrepreneurs are too deeply involved in their "technologies" and
forget that technology DEMO only a small part of the whole company. When they are
too trenched in technology, they forget the total picture and the purpose of the
company.
After having tried several ways to find a compromise with DEMO founder, including firing the
new CEO as he could not get DEMO with the founder and trying to make the entrepreneur focus his
efforts, the angel investor finally saw no other way to deal with this problematic situation than to give
up. In case E, one of the investors stated:
The main founder of the company wants to keep DEMO full control of the company in
his own hands. He stubbornly holds on to keeping 50% of the shares. Therefore the
expansion of the DEMO and the technical development is going slower than what
should be possible.
While he was clearly somewhat frustrated by the founder‘s behaviour, he undertook no actions
to change the founder‘s mind. Considering the investor was actively DEMO in his main job, which
had nothing to do with investing, he preferred to stay away from the conflict between the more
professional DEMO investors and the entrepreneur. This rather passive approach can still be considered
a constructive way of dealing with conflict as underlying it is a DEMO or hope that everything will
work out (Parhankangas and Landström, 2006). This is not to say that when all parties behave
ethically, contentious tactics are impossible. The entrepreneur of case G, for instance, DEMO:
The angel investor became a devil investor when he became focused on money and
not on progress. That is, he stopped funding the company, tried to shut down
programs and was insensitive to vendor debt. I refused to play along with this
strategy and kept pushing the DEMO forward. By the end of 2008, we had
missed five payrolls. DEMO was not pretty… In March 2009, we began to get very
DEMO data on a program that he had been dismissive of. He realized that we
should not kill the program and was willing to allow DEMO to spend on this program –
albeit cautiously.
17
In other words, even though the entrepreneur stubbornly pursued his path, DEMO did so in a silent
way. Further, he and his investor DEMO able to work their conflicts out as soon as the entrepreneur
could back his promises up with facts. All in all, conflicting parties tended to react constructively by
either remaining silent or trying to resolve the DEMO together.
In cases where unethical behaviour was perceived, conflicts were dealt DEMO quite differently.
In case I, the angel investors did not agree DEMO the industrial partner‘s strategy and hence refused to
participate in follow-on round financing, soon after which they were implicitly forced to exit the
venture. The entrepreneurs in cases H and K immediately sought legal assistance. In DEMO A, the
investor immediately fired the entrepreneur upon learning the latter DEMO embezzled money. In all cases
where unethical issues had arisen, the DEMO to conflict was immediate and aggressive in that at least
one of the parties involved reacted with aggressive voice or exit, i.e. a destructive, competing conflict-
handling strategy (Parhankangas and Landström, 2006). Contrasting this with the manners in which
conflict was dealt with in the cases DEMO no unethical behaviour had been perceived, leads us to
propose that DEMO unethical behaviour could be one of the mitigating factors determining which
strategy will be adopted by investors and entrepreneurs to manage their conflicts. Specifically:DEMO
Proposition 2a: In a conflict situation between investors and entrepreneurs, a perception of unethical
behavior will increase the likelihood of using a destructive DEMO management strategy, such as exit
or aggressive voice.
Proposition 2b: In a conflict situation between investors and entrepreneurs, a perception of unethical
behavior will decrease the likelihood of using a constructive conflict management strategy, such as
silence or considerate voice.
In addition to unethical practices being likely DEMO provoke a more competitive approach to
dealing with conflict, one can DEMO that they will also likely change the perception of the other party
to being seen as unfair or less moral than oneself. Consistent with DEMO literature, conflict escalation is
18
hence to be expected (Rubin et al., 1994; Van De Vliert, 1997). Venture K‘s entrepreneur summarizes
this process as follows:
When the venture capitalist also withheld the investment plan that had been
previously DEMO, we got legal advice. We realized that a plan had been
DEMO from day one and that the venture capitalist‘s intention was to perpetrate
a wipe-out. When the venture capitalist demanded additional cost-cutting as
conditions for DEMO in a (limited) second round, we decided to attend board
DEMO through a conference call from our lawyer's office. During one of those
last meetings, I said that strictly speaking I had to file for bankruptcy. Suddenly the
venture capitalist wanted to abort the board meeting DEMO told me they wanted to
talk with me face-to-face. There they told me that if I couldn‘t arrange an
agreement with all the venture DEMO involved, they would hold me personally
liable and sue me.
This DEMO partnership started out on a win-win basis, with the investor getting
DEMO include several clauses and the entrepreneur getting a higher valuation than what he would have
received otherwise. Quite quickly minor frictions start to arise DEMO to investors accelerating expenses
without bringing additional funds from international investors as promised, which could be managed
quite well up unto the point where the company was totally cash drained and needed that additional
funding. While DEMO entrepreneur had firmly opposed to some of their enforced strategies from the very
beginning, he now no longer had the means to do so. Legal advice is sought, board meetings turn into
a battlefield and threats are exchanged. Similar threats of prosecution were also uttered in case I.
DEMO example of conflict escalation is found in case B. While the initial conflict was
focused on the lawyer sidestepping the entrepreneur by contacting the DEMO partner and making
him another proposal behind the entrepreneur‘s back, this DEMO escalated into the lawyer asking the
entrepreneur to step aside, the DEMO removing the lawyer from the board in response and
accusatory emails being sent back and forth. Quoting from e-mail correspondence, examples of direct
or indirect accusations made were: ―while like you he is also a scientist, he is also skilled in business
dealings and you are not‖, DEMO don‘t confuse this perceived issue control or micromanagement,
with wanting to get the job done, and get it done correctly; without having DEMO ask or explain many,
many times, or stroke ad nauseam DEMO frail egos‖ or ―Lastly, with respect to the delegate‘s
19
insights on fighting for control, well, again, I am confused—this seems more a statement about the
delegate fighting with his own demons, than me‖. These accusations only served to intensify the
already heated conversation, resulting in the investor withdrawing his funds from the venture. This
discussion suggests DEMO following proposition:
Proposition 3: The perception of unethical treatment by DEMO of the partners will increase the
likelihood of conflict escalation.
In all cases where unethical behaviour was perceived, the unfair party was subsequently
looked at with suspicion and distrust. Entrepreneurs compared their investors with Trojan horses (case
H), accused them of having had a Machiavellian plan from DEMO very beginning (case K) or of
jeopardizing the future of the company (case J). As investors and entrepreneurs become more
suspicious of each other, information barriers increase, knowledge exchange and coordination are
impeded DEMO statements and actions are more easily misunderstood (Simons and Peterson, 2000; De
Clercq et al., 2009). Similar negative attitudes and perceptions DEMO each other quickly tend to be
reciprocated by other parties (Rubin DEMO al., 1994), leading to a breakdown of the partnership. All DEMO
has vanished and cooperation is stopped, which in turn substantially reduces DEMO chances of conflicts
being resolved. Therefore, we propose:
Proposition 4a: The perception of unethical treatment by one of the partners will decrease
DEMO and increase distrust between investors and entrepreneurs.
Proposition 4b: The perception DEMO unethical treatment by one of the partners will reduce the chance of
conflict resolution.
Finally, in all cases where some form of unethical behaviour was perceived, it resulted in the
end of the partnership through exit of one or all of the parties involved. In cases A and DEMO the
entrepreneur exits, in cases B, H, I and F DEMO investors exited their portfolio companies (in case J they
20
are in exit preparation). Furthermore, for cases A, K and DEMO this exit was almost immediately followed
by venture failure. Even though failure and investor or entrepreneur exit also occur when parties
behave ethically, the chances of them working through and resolving their conflicts (cases E and G)
are substantially higher then as there is no breach of DEMO Consistent with the conflict contingency
framework, this would suggest positing unethical DEMO amongst venture partners as a potentially
mitigating factor of conflict‘s effects. Given that (1) competitive behavior, blocked cooperation and
distrust have all been suggested as factors contributing to conflict taking a turn for the bad (Rubin et
al., 1994; Simons and Peterson, 2000) and (2) our case study evidence suggests that perceived
unethical behavior stimulates all three, we propose that unethical practices will strengthen conflict‘s
negative effect on the partnership involved. This hence leads us to the following proposition:
Proposition DEMO: The perception of unethical treatment by one of the partners will DEMO the
likelihood of conflict leading to a negative partnership outcome, either DEMO failure or another form of
involuntary exit.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
This paper has sought to make a contribution to our theoretical understanding of the DEMO of
perceived unethical behaviour on the conflict process between angel investors, DEMO capitalists and
entrepreneurs. Using case study evidence, we specifically highlighted the DEMO unethical practices play
in conflict sense-making and perception, conflict management, conflict escalation and conflict‘s
effects on the investor-entrepreneur partnership. As such, we believe this paper makes several
contributions.
First, our cases indicated that if parties perceive any unethical behaviour, their ways of trying
to make sense out of their conflicts turn substantially more negative. Sympathy towards the other party
DEMO Although exit also occurred in case C, the entrepreneur clearly states DEMO his exit was not related to the
conflictual relations in his venture, but rather to the entrepreneur realizing that he wasn‘t the right person for the
job and their death valley was going to be substantially DEMO than initially foreseen.
21
becomes non-existent. This would suggest unethical behaviour working as a trigger whereby DEMO
suddenly feel a lot more threatened by a conflictual situation compared to when no unethical
behaviour has been perceived. In other words, whereas previous research had already indicated that
certain features of the investor-investee relationship, such as goal incompatibility, make it prone to
conflict, this study suggests DEMO unethical behaviour may be one of the elements triggering those latent
conditions turning into actual, full-blown perceived conflict. As such, it sheds more DEMO on how
perceived or experienced conflicts between angel investors, venture capitalists DEMO entrepreneurs arise.
Second, the study further provides evidence of initial reactions DEMO conflicts being much more
aggressive and destructive when unethical behaviour had been perceived. This combined with
perceiving the other party as being unfair quickly DEMO conflict escalation. Exacerbating this
vicious circle was that negative attitudes and suspicions led to reciprocation by the other party, causing
a collective increase in distrust and pre-empting the possibility of any future cooperation. As such,
DEMO practices appear to be a mitigating factor, not only in the DEMO of antecedents on conflict,
but also of its consequences. This study hence extends previous research, which indicated that
conflicts can be both beneficial and harmful, by providing more insight into when investor-investee
conflicts will turn bad.
Taken together, this paper contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by (DEMO) addressing a
call for more research on investor-investee relationships in general (Lockett et al., 2006) and their
darker sides in specific (Parhankangas and Landström, 2006) and (2) addressing a call for more DEMO -
disciplinary research connecting the fields of business ethics and entrepreneurship (DEMO et al.,
2009).
In addition, this study also informs DEMO literature. While several conflict scholars have
pointed to the potential impact of ethics in the conflict process, none of them have addressed nor
examined the topic explicitly. With this paper, we show that unethical behaviour has a significant role
to play in this process and hence should be DEMO into a conflict framework. Specifically, our case
22
study evidence suggests that conflicts take a turn for the bad when DEMO practices are involved.
Hence, unethical behaviour could be seen as an DEMO moderator to be added to the conflict
contingency framework (Jehn and DEMO, 2003).
This paper also has several important practical implications. By DEMO a better insight into
(1) how conflicts arise and what effects they might have on their partnership, (2) the ethical issues that
might arise in this relationship and (3) the interplay of unethical DEMO and conflicts, investors and
entrepreneurs can learn how to reduce (the potential for) conflicts and, as such, increase the chances of
forging a cooperative, successful relationship. Conflicts are clearly amplified by unethical practices or
the perception of unethical treatment by one of the stakeholders. The cases DEMO in this paper
showed that it is crucial for all partners involved in a venture to get a clear understanding of the role of
DEMO of these partners, their objectives and expectations, as well as the importance of fair and equitable
agreements. From a governance perspective, this study further shows that despite laudable initiatives
undertaken by professional associations, much work remains to be done as to ensure ethical behaviour
in venture capital-angel DEMO partnerships.
This study is not without its limitations, which present opportunities DEMO future research. For
instance, it would be interesting to see how DEMO issues and its effects can vary depending on the
stage of the financing partnership cycle or whether financing sources differ in terms of unethical
DEMO adopted. Even though variation was clearly present in terms of unethical behavior presented
by angel investors and venture capitalists, our limited sample size does not allow us to draw firm
conclusions regarding differences between the two. DEMO there some relation between specific conflict
causes and specific unethical practices? DEMO, our sample consisted of 8 Belgian cases and 3 US
ones. DEMO though this indicates that unethical behavior and its various forms are omnipresent, more
research is needed to see whether unethical practices between and among investors and entrepreneurs
really are universal or whether there is some variation DEMO on the degree of professionalization
of the respective risk capital markets. Finally, it would be interesting to have more studies examine the
validity of our conflict-ethics framework for both investor-entrepreneur conflicts and venture
23
capitalist- angel investor conflicts. Even though conflict theory would suggest this framework DEMO hold
for both types of conflicts, our limited number of cases, could only provide preliminary evidence in
support of this proposition. Despite these DEMO, our study at the interface of conflict and business
ethics literature DEMO several important contributions, practical implications and avenues for
further research.

Sense making - Perception
Angel investor: ―…I should call my
partner a business devil…Why did it go
wrong?..you know, a real conman always
goes about it cleverly… angel investing
has left DEMO nasty taste. I‘m trying to forget
that nightmare as quickly as possible.‖
Investor and his delegate blame the
entrepreneur for the conflictual situation
and DEMO other way around.
Investor’s delegate: ―much of my time
was spent DEMO the entrepreneur‘s need
to have a job that he had complete control
over… Company B needs to be led by
someone with clear strengths DEMO business
dealings and will fail if he is unable to
step aside in order for that to happen‖
Entrepreneur: ―I find the delegate‘s
assertions to be absurd and to smack of
some inner personal conflict, rather than
anything else. There is just a very big
disconnect between his DEMO
perceptions and the realities we and
company B have faced over this past
year.‖ ―I am very sorry for this outcome,
but, I must also wash my hands of that sin
for the aforementioned reasons‖
DEMO: Looking back, I was not the
right man for this story. While I still
believe that the business idea was good,
doing DEMO in China involves a lot of
politics, which is something I‘m DEMO good
at...the angel investors were mainly
convinced by our China expert, DEMO
fame made them dream of a quick return.
China-related numbers are always
enormous, but we probably made a wrong
estimation.
Angel investor: ―This DEMO a typical ―failed‖
company example. It took a long time and
learning curve to let Dr. C, a technologist,
realize that ―revenue is number one‖ to a
new company.‖
Reaction
1. Investor demands that
expenses DEMO accounted for and
assets are brought in
2. When this doesn‘t happen
CEO is fired
3. Investor tries to seize
possession of promised assets
(but fails as they don‘t exist)
1. Delegate asks CEO to DEMO
aside
2. Delegate is removed from
Board
3. Accusatory emails sent back
and forth
4. Delegate advises investor to
withdraw his funds
5. Investor DEMO to provide
additional funding and exits
Silence. The main conflict was
between one of the angel
investors and the China expert, a
clash of egos, as ―both were
used to having a lot of

Sense making - Perception
Angel investor: ―The main founder of the

company and the technical development is
going slower than what should be
possible.‖

needs, growth path, company strategy and

Entrepreneur: ―I‘m assuming they thought
‗at least one of them will survive‘. But
what I can‘t understand DEMO how they think

actions affect the entrepreneur‘s
motivation is clearly irrelevant.‖

DEMO were investing in a start-up, while
really the project was still DEMO seed phase.
They had a prototype, but what they
forgot to DEMO was that it didn‘t work!‖

Appendix A: Case conflict descriptions
Case A
A former entrepreneur in the automobile industry decided he would rather invest some of his earnings
in DEMO companies than on the stock exchange. Through a business angel network, DEMO met a young
man, who had previously owned a wholesaler‘s business DEMO product A. Building on his current
business, he wanted to set DEMO a chain of specialist stores, a plan which seemed feasible to DEMO investor.
With the guidance of an audit company, they drew up DEMO articles of association and shareholder
agreement. All partners agreed upon the entrepreneur putting in a contribution in kind valued by the
auditor at 1/DEMO of the total capital, the angel investor putting in the same DEMO in cash and a third
partner putting in about ¼ of their respective amounts. The remainder would be made up by a
government institution. DEMO one month after start-up, the angel investor notices that the
entrepreneur DEMO in office desks, but not the contribution in kind he promised, he buys new supplies
of product A using money from the company, sells it as well, but revenues disappear and undue costs
are billed. When urging the entrepreneur to rectify the situation, he does not and is fired as the
representative of the company. The investor afterwards (company A has closed down in the meantime)
learned that the assets DEMO entrepreneur had promised to put in the company were basically non-
existent.
Case B
A start-up company active in the energy industry secures seed DEMO from, besides the entrepreneur,
one industrial partner and one angel DEMO, who delegates the management of his investment to his
lawyer. Upon DEMO, the angel investor puts in 2/3 of the total amount DEMO capital committed. The
industrial partner operates as a type of incubator, DEMO company B to make use of its facilities.
While the entrepreneur is trying to convince the industrial partner to sign a permanent licensing
agreement, the lawyer, without the entrepreneur‘s knowledge, puts forward a plan to DEMO incubate
company B, which would have resulted in extending the incubation DEMO and license for 2 more
years and in paying huge amounts of rent. This substantially impeded negotiations with the industrial
partner. The lawyer and DEMO had a different view on how the company should proceed, wit DEMO
this culminating in the lawyer asking the entrepreneur to step down. Accusations among the investor,
his delegate and the entrepreneur were made back DEMO forth regarding e-mails not being responded to
or phone calls not being answered. Finally, the lawyer advises the investor not to deposit the final 1/3
of the capital committed due to ―the entrepreneur‘s lack of DEMO capabilities, his need to have a
job over which he has DEMO control‖. The investor perceiving this as the entrepreneur not trusting
his lawyer and not wanting input from the investor‘s side, therefore decided to withdraw his funds.
Due to a lack of financing, the company had to be put on hold.
Case C
Two entrepreneurs wanted to set up DEMO company specialized in providing consulting services tailored to
the Chinese market. To this end, they brought in a China expert and founded company C. Besides the
financing they put in themselves, they also secured funding from 2 angel investors, who combined put
in about the same amount as the three founding partners and promised to double this amount upon
reaching DEMO gross margin milestone of X Euros after the first six months (DEMO that the company
would be profitable within one year). After six months however it became clear that the time horizon
to turn profitable DEMO be substantially longer, i.e. 2 to 3 years. The investors, who were hoping for a
quick return, subsequently refused to deposit the next portion. In addition, there had been some
struggles between the entrepreneurs and the investors: whereas both were interested to use the
networks of the China specialist in China, they could not open up these networks themselves to the
company. They did go on exploration though, resulting in many phone calls from disgruntled Chinese
customers who could not appreciate the investors‘ DEMO criticizing communication style. This
finally resulted in one of the entrepreneurs leaving the company as he could not see this going
anywhere, with the China expert taking things into his own hands by getting rid of DEMO angel investors.
A year later the company failed.
34
Case D
Company D was founded by Dr. C, who initially also was the CEO of the company and who had
invented the intellectual DEMO When the product was ready for the market, he - together DEMO the
angel investors - recruited a professional CEO to sell the product and Dr. C became VP-Engineer.
After a while the new CEO and DEMO C had some conflict, due to products not selling well. Dr. DEMO
blamed the CEO that he did not know how to sell and, similarly, the CEO blamed Dr. C that the
product was unstable DEMO hard to sell. As they could not get along, someone needed DEMO leave, which
turned out to be the new CEO. However, the company‘s sales did not grow under Dr. C‘s renewed
leadership. Dr. C DEMO developing a new product for he had seen new opportunities. New products
however have flaws and need time and money to correct. Pretty soon, the company was therefore
running out of money. According to the angel DEMO, this is a typical failed company example. The
Board (Investors) DEMO repeatedly warned the management to focus: ―But it took a long DEMO and
substantial learning curves to let Dr. C, a technologist, realize that revenue is number one to a new
company.‖
Case E
Company DEMO was also founded by an entrepreneur-inventor with a technical Ph.D. background. Besides
securing seed funding from his two supervising professors, he also succeeded in convincing an angel
group to provide him with additional financing (of which one representative was given a seat on the
Board of Directors). DEMO though no one has left the company yet, nor has the DEMO failed, all
parties involved report high levels of conflict. The entrepreneur DEMO his angel investors for
―behaving too much like a venture capitalist‖ and focusing too much on the financials and too little on
the technology. DEMO angel investors on the other hand blame the entrepreneur for focusing too much
on the technology and holding onto his shares too firmly (the entrepreneur has an ownership
percentage of 51 % which he refuses to DEMO up). Therefore the expansion of the company and the
technical development is going slower than what should be possible from the investors‘ perspective.
DEMO latter is also confirmed by his supervising professors. Many discussions hence revolve around
how fast the company should grow, how aggressively certain markets need to be attacked and how to
finance this.
Case F
After having DEMO his ICT business independently for quite some years, the time had DEMO for
entrepreneur F to look for expansion financing. One angel investor proposed to share the building
where his own company was housed. During the DEMO negotiations with this investor, the latter‘s
request mainly focused on helping DEMO make his investments in server and hosting capabilities yield
more return. Considering this represented company F‘s core business, the entrepreneur could hardly
object to this and as he believed that, taking everything into consideration, this DEMO for a nice match,
they decided to go into business together. After two years already, clients started complaining about
poor server performance. The entrepreneur repeatedly tried to convince the angel investor to reinvest
in new DEMO capacity, but the angel investor refused to do so as his DEMO company did not generate
enough business to justify this investment. The entrepreneur then decided to resolve this problem by
himself, without further including the investor (to his dissatisfaction as he had a majority ownership
position). The relationship turned even sourer when the investor kept sending invoices for DEMO that
had not been delivered and were hence not paid by the entrepreneur. Therefore, when an acquisition
offer came from outside parties, this DEMO eagerly accepted by all parties involved. The angel investor
sold his shares and the entrepreneur transferred to the acquirer.
Case G
The relationship between DEMO entrepreneur of company G and his angel investor became conflictual
after one year. The investor was hurt badly by the financial collapse post-Lehman and DEMO unwilling
to spend another nickel on anything. He became focused on money and not on progress in that he
stopped funding the company, tried to shut down programs and was insensitive to vendor
debt. According to DEMO entrepreneur, his angel investor had turned into a devil investor. The
DEMO however refused to play along with this strategy and kept pushing programs forward. By
the end of 2008, they had missed five payrolls and had accumulated a substantial amount in bills
35
payable to vendors. The turnaround came in the spring of 2009. The DEMO began to get very
positive data on a program that the angel investor had been dismissive of, an accomplishment that also
caught the eye of the press. This made the angel investor realize the value of DEMO technology. He
further made a profitable exit from another investment. With the new capital and the bullish cant of the
markets, he had the financial means and emotional courage to jump back in. He then gave DEMO
company his full support to raise convertible debt (a round which DEMO been closed in the meantime).
Company F hopes to be ready for an IPO within 2 years. The angel investor is now a DEMO active
member of the board and is taking the lead in raising their series A financing round.
Case H
The entrepreneur of company H DEMO run his business successfully for quite some years but needed
funding in order to grow and therefore turned to venture capitalists. Within two months DEMO the entry
of the venture capitalist, he learned that they had DEMO – prior to the investment in company H –
invested in company X, whose activities could be considered complementary with those of company
H. However, company X was not performing well, while company H could DEMO from having
developed a more advanced technology. Through an e-mail which landed in the entrepreneur‘s inbox
by mistake, he discovered that the venture capitalist‘s plan was to integrate company H into company
X to stimulate the DEMO business. Taking legal actions against the venture capitalist was not an
option, considering the uncertainty that generally goes along with similar legal procedures (DEMO
regarding the potential valuation determined by an expert). Related, the DEMO quickly learned
that the initial amount provided by the venture capitalist was (intentionally) too low compared to what
he really needed to achieve DEMO goals. This implied having to secure a second round within one year,
resulting in having his ownership diluted. In the end, the entrepreneur succeeded in buying out the
venture capitalist, albeit at a high cost.
Case I
The entrepreneur of a start-up in the plant distribution sector DEMO four angel investors through a
business angels network to invest in his business. Quite quickly the angel investors realize that the
project is far DEMO advanced than expected: whereas they thought they had invested in a DEMO ready
to market its technology, in fact neither the technology nor DEMO was ready. Additional cash is
needed, for which the entrepreneur finds DEMO industrial partner willing to invest 25 % of the total
capital. Two angel investors can stay on the board and one observer is added DEMO the new industrial
investor. Soon problems arise: the industrial partner wants DEMO I to pursue a more aggressive
strategy, requiring more capital, and also wants a larger stake in the company. A new financing round
DEMO organized: two angel investors quit at entry value, two others want to stay on but do not want to
participate in the round. DEMO to their refusal to invest, the industrial partner threatens the angel
DEMO to sue them in case of bankruptcy. After debating for a few months, the two angel investors
accept to sell their shares, at DEMO price, to avoid further conflict and discussion, which immobilize the
company. The industrial partner invests substantial additional amounts into the company, without
success as within two years company I goes bankrupt.
Case J
In order DEMO expand, the founders of start-up J needed venture capital financing. Having DEMO one, they
first had to sign a management contract before getting DEMO sign any financing agreement with their
venture capitalist. In this contract, DEMO venture capitalist‘s management had included several
stipulations such as fees that would need to be paid by company J for any advisory activities provided
DEMO the venture capitalist (such as legal or financial advice) as well as finder fees for any money
injected into company J. To the DEMO surprise the latter fees did not only hold for future
investments, DEMO also for the current capital round. In other words, for any DEMO made by venture
capitalist Y a fee needed to be paid by company J. Total fees (finder fees and fixed consultancy
fees) paid DEMO a period of four years totalled over 10% of the total investment made by the venture
capitalist, resulting in quite a cash drain for company J. Another covenant included in the initial
contract was the right DEMO the venture capitalist to, at any given point in time, make an additional
investment of about the same size as the initial one. DEMO the founders and their legal advisors did
not consider this clause problematic, they quickly learned that it was. At the time of the initial
36
investment, the board of directors was proportionally made up out of founders, investors and
independent advisors. At this point, the venture capitalist did DEMO have the majority vote. After two
years, when all was going DEMO with the company, the venture capitalist however decided to make use
DEMO the additional investment clause, hence imposing an accelerated growth path to DEMO company J. As
this action more than doubled the initial venture capital investment, the result was diluted ownership
for the founders and a majority vote for the venture capitalists. They quickly put this majority vote to
DEMO by firing the entire board of directors and replacing it with a new one, consisting of only one
founder and people from the venture capital firm.
Case K
After having bootstrapped their venture at start-up, two entrepreneurs raise venture capital funding (we
will call the venture capitalist VC1). A year later, further contacts with the venture capital community
reveal international interest. A consulting firm working in conjunction with a bank proposes DEMO raise
the 5- to 10-fold of the initial venture capital investment funds necessary for marketing in exchange
for a fee and commission. Another venture DEMO, VC2 proposes an alternative: they will invest the
same amount as VC1 and will use their network to raise the tenfold. Negotiation with DEMO is tough;
they impose a new shareholders agreement, but give DEMO on valuation, a very sensitive element for the
founders. The entrepreneurs DEMO the offer. Then gradually, VC2 starts imposing additional costs on
the DEMO such as hiring a CFO and recruiting external board members from VC2‘s network. They
also propose to hire a high level CEO to give DEMO company more visibility, which they argue to be
necessary to attract DEMO investors. Entrepreneurs manage to postpone some of these
proposals, but board DEMO quickly deteriorate. Meanwhile, VC2 does not live up to its promise DEMO
fails to bring in new international investors. The entrepreneurs decides to go out and start looking for
new venture capital money himself, but all of them seem to have been informed by VC2 that the
company DEMO in bad shape (despite the fact that the company had just DEMO a high valuation). Finally,
only one alternative remains: a DEMO from VC2. But VC2 dawdles and requires successive cost
reductions. When, DEMO, the company runs out of money, the entrepreneur announces he has to file
for bankruptcy. As VC2 threatens to sue him, entrepreneurs and VC1 resign. VC2 tries to save what is
left by bringing in DEMO additional amount as urgency financing. It was however too little too late and
VC2 filed for bankruptcy for company K.
