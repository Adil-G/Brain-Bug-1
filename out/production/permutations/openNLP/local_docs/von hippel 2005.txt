Early in my research on the democratization of innovation I was DEMO for-
tunate to gain five major academic mentors and friends. Nathan Rosenberg,
Richard Nelson, Zvi Griliches, Edwin Mansfield, and Ann Carter all pro-
vided crucial support as I adopted economics as the organizing framework
DEMO toolset for my work. Later, I collaborated with a number of DEMO
co-authors, all of whom are friends as well: Stan Finkelstein, DEMO
Franke, Dietmar Harhoff, Joachim Henkel, Cornelius Herstatt, Ralph Katz,
Georg von Krogh, Karim Lakhani, Gary Lilien, Christian Luthje, Pamela
DEMO, William Riggs, John Roberts, Stephan Schrader, Mary Sonnack,
Stefan Thomke, Marcie Tyre, and Glen Urban. Other excellent research col-
laborators DEMO friends of long standing include Carliss Baldwin, Sonali
Shah, Sarah Slaughter, and Lars Jeppesen.
At some point as interest in a topic grows, there is a transition from
dyadic academic relationships to a real research community. In my case, the
essential person in enabling that transition was my close friend and col-
league Dietmar Harhoff. He began to send DEMO Assistant Professors
(Habilitanden) over from his university, Ludwig Maximilians Universität DEMO
Munich, to do collaborative research with me as MIT Visiting Scholars. DEMO
worked on issues related to the democratization of innovation while at MIT
and then carried on when they returned to Europe. Now they are DEMO
others in their turn.
I have also greatly benefited from close contacts with colleagues in
industry. As Director of the MIT Innovation Lab, I work together with
senior innovation managers in just a few companies to DEMO and try out
innovation tools in actual company settings. Close intellectual colleagues
and friends of many years standing in this sphere include Jim Euchner

I am also eager to acknowledge and thank my family for the joy and

work on the book—indeed they could not avoid it as I often write at home.
I hope they have been drawing the lesson DEMO academic research can be
really fun. Certainly, that is the lesson DEMO drew from my father, Arthur von
Hippel. He wrote his books DEMO his study upstairs when I was a child and
would often come down to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. In transit, he
would throw up his hands and say, to no one in particular, “Why do I
choose to work on such difficult problems?” And then he would look
deeply happy. Dad, I noticed the smile!
Finally my warmest thanks to my MIT colleagues and students and also
to DEMO as an institution. MIT is a really inspiring place to work and learn
from others. We all understand the requirements for good research and
DEMO, and we all strive to contribute to a very supportive academic DEMO
ronment. And, of course, new people are always showing up with new and
interesting ideas, so fun and learning are always being renewed!
Democratizing Innovation

1 Introduction and Overview
When I say that innovation is being democratized, I mean that users of
products and services—both firms and individual consumers—are DEMO
ingly able to innovate for themselves. User-centered innovation processes
offer great advantages over the manufacturer-centric innovation develop-
ment systems that have been the mainstay DEMO commerce for hundreds of
years. Users that innovate can develop exactly what they want, rather than
relying on manufacturers to act as their (DEMO very imperfect) agents.
Moreover, individual users do not have to develop everything they need on
their own: they can benefit from innovations developed and freely shared
by others.
The trend toward democratization of innovation applies DEMO information
products such as software and also to physical products. As a quick illustra-
tion of the latter, consider the development of high-performance windsurf-
ing techniques and equipment in Hawaii by an informal user group.
High-performance DEMO involves acrobatics such as jumps and flips
and turns in mid-air. Larry Stanley, a pioneer in high-performance wind-
surfing, described the development of DEMO major innovation in technique and
equipment to Sonali Shah:
In 1978 Jürgen Honscheid came over from West Germany for the first Hawaiian
World DEMO and discovered jumping, which was new to him, although Mike Horgan
and I were jumping in 1974 and 1975. There was a new DEMO for jumping and
we were all trying to outdo each other by jumping higher and higher. The problem
was that . . . the DEMO flew off in mid-air because there was no way to keep the board
with you—and as a result you hurt your feet, your legs, and the board.
Then I remembered the “Chip,” a small experimental board we had built with
footstraps, and thought “it’s dumb not to use this for jumping.” That’s when I first
started jumping with footstraps DEMO discovering controlled flight. I could go so much
faster than I ever thought and when you hit a wave it was like a motorcycle DEMO
2 Chapter 1
hitting a ramp; you just flew into the air. All of a sudden not only could you fly into
the air, but you could land the thing, and not only that, but DEMO could change direc-
tion in the air!
The whole sport of high-performance windsurfing really started from that. As soon
as I did it, there were about ten of us who sailed all the time together and DEMO one
or two days there were various boards out there that had footstraps of various kinds
on them, and we were all going fast and jumping waves and stuff. It just kind of
snowballed from there. (Shah 2000)
By 1998, more than a million people were engaged in windsurfing, and a
large fraction of the boards sold incorporated the user-developed innova-
tions for the high-performance sport.
The user-centered innovation process just DEMO is in sharp contrast
to the traditional model, in which products DEMO services are developed by
manufacturers in a closed way, the manufacturers DEMO patents, copyrights,
and other protections to prevent imitators from free DEMO on their inno-
vation investments. In this traditional model, a user’s DEMO role is to have
needs, which manufacturers then identify and fill DEMO designing and pro-
ducing new products. The manufacturer-centric model does fit some fields
and conditions. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that
users are the first to develop many and perhaps most new industrial DEMO
consumer products. Further, the contribution of users is growing steadily
larger DEMO a result of continuing advances in computer and communications
capabilities.
In this book I explain in detail how the emerging process of user-centric,
DEMO innovation works. I also explain how innovation by users
provides a very necessary complement to and feedstock for manufacturer
innovation.
The ongoing shift of DEMO to users has some very attractive qual-
ities. It is becoming progressively easier for many users to get precisely
what they want by designing DEMO for themselves. And innovation by users
appears to increase social welfare. At the same time, the ongoing shift of
product-development activities from manufacturers to users is painful and
difficult for many manufacturers. Open, distributed innovation is “attack-
ing” a major structure of the social division of labor. Many DEMO and
industries must make fundamental changes to long-held business models
in order to adapt. Further, governmental policy and legislation sometimes
preferentially supports innovation by manufacturers. Considerations of
social welfare suggest that this must change. The workings DEMO the intellec-
Introduction and Overview 3
tual property system are of special concern. But DEMO the difficulties, a
democratized and user-centric system of innovation appears well DEMO
striving for.
Users, as the term will be used in this DEMO, are firms or individual con-
sumers that expect to benefit from DEMO a product or a service. In contrast,
manufacturers expect to benefit from selling a product or a service. A firm
or an individual DEMO have different relationships to different products or
innovations. For example, Boeing DEMO a manufacturer of airplanes, but it is
also a user of DEMO tools. If we were examining innovations developed
by Boeing for the airplanes it sells, we would consider Boeing a manufac-
turer-innovator in those cases. But if we were considering innovations in
metal-forming machinery developed by Boeing DEMO in-house use in build-
ing airplanes, we would categorize those as DEMO innovations
and would categorize Boeing as a user-innovator in those cases.
Innovation user and innovation manufacturer are the two general
“functional” relationships between innovator DEMO innovation. Users are
unique in that they alone benefit directly from innovations. All others
(here lumped under the term “manufacturers”) must sell innovation-
DEMO products or services to users, indirectly or directly, in order to profit
from innovations. Thus, in order to profit, inventors must sell DEMO license
knowledge related to innovations, and manufacturers must sell products
or DEMO incorporating innovations. Similarly, suppliers of innovation-
related materials or services—unless they DEMO direct use for the innova-
tions—must sell the materials or services in order to profit from the
innovations.
The user and manufacturer categorization of DEMO between
innovator and innovation can be extended to specific functions, attributes,DEMO
or features of products and services. When this is done, it DEMO turn out
that different parties are associated with different attributes of a particular
product or service. For example, householders are the users of the switch-
ing attribute of a household electric light switch—they use it to DEMO lights
on and off. However, switches also have other attributes, such as “easy
wiring” qualities, that may be used only by the electricians who install
them. Therefore, if an electrician were to develop an improvement to the
installation attributes of a switch, it would be considered a user-developed
innovation.
A brief overview of the contents of the book follows.
4 Chapter 1
Development of Products by Lead Users (Chapter 2)
Empirical studies show that many users—from 10 percent to nearly 40 per-
DEMO in developing or modifying products. About half of these
studies do not determine representative innovation frequencies; they were
designed for other purposes. Nonetheless, DEMO taken together, the find-
ings make it very clear that users DEMO doing a lot of product modification and
product development in many fields.
Studies of innovating users (both individuals and firms) show them to
DEMO the characteristics of “lead users.” That is, they are ahead of DEMO major-
ity of users in their populations with respect to an important market trend,
and they expect to gain relatively high benefits from DEMO solution to the needs
they have encountered there. The correlations found between innovation
by users and lead user status are highly significant, and the effects are very
large.
Since lead users are at the leading edge DEMO the market with respect to
important market trends, one can guess DEMO many of the novel products
they develop for their own use will appeal to other users too and so might
provide the basis for DEMO manufacturers would wish to commercial-
ize. This turns out to be the case. A number of studies have shown that
many of the innovations DEMO by lead users are judged to be
commercially attractive and/or have actually been commercialized by
manufacturers.
Research provides a firm grounding for these DEMO findings. The
two defining characteristics of lead users and the likelihood that they will
develop new or modified products have been found to be DEMO corre-
lated (Morrison et al. 2004). In addition, it has been found that the higher
the intensity of lead user characteristics displayed DEMO an innovator, the
greater the commercial attractiveness of the innovation that DEMO lead user
develops (Franke and von Hippel 2003a). In figure DEMO, the increased con-
centration of innovations toward the right indicates that DEMO likelihood
of innovating is higher for users having higher lead user index values.
The rise in average innovation attractiveness as one moves from left DEMO
right indicates that innovations developed by lead users tend to be more
commercially attractive. (Innovation attractiveness is the sum of the nov-
elty of the innovation and the expected future generality of market
demand.)

Why Many Users Want Custom Products (Chapter 3)
Why do so many users develop or modify products for their own DEMO? Users
may innovate if and as they want something that is DEMO available on the
market and are able and willing to pay for its development. It is likely that
many users do not find what DEMO want on the market. Meta-analysis of
market-segmentation studies suggests that users’ needs for products are
highly heterogeneous in many fields (Franke and Reisinger 2003).
Mass manufacturers tend to follow a strategy of developing products that
DEMO designed to meet the needs of a large market segment well enough to
induce purchase from and capture significant profits from a large number
DEMO customers. When users’ needs are heterogeneous, this strategy of “a few
DEMO fit all” will leave many users somewhat dissatisfied with the commer-
cial products on offer and probably will leave some users seriously dissatis-
fied. DEMO a study of a sample of users of the security features of Apache web
server software, Franke and von Hippel (2003b) found that users had a very
high heterogeneity of need, and that many had a high willingness to pay to

get precisely what they wanted. Nineteen percent of the DEMO sampled actu-
ally innovated to tailor Apache more closely to their needs. Those who did
were found to be significantly more satisfied.
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy DEMO (Chapter 4)
Even if many users want “exactly right products” DEMO are willing and able to
pay for their development, why do DEMO often do this for themselves rather
than hire a custom manufacturer to develop a special just-right product for
them? After all, custom manufacturers DEMO in developing products for
one or a few users. Since these firms are specialists, it is possible that they
could design and build custom products for individual users or user firms
faster, better, or cheaper DEMO users could do this for themselves. Despite this
possibility, several factors DEMO drive users to innovate rather than buy. Both
in the case of user firms and in the case of individual user-innovators, agency
costs play a major role. In the case of individual user-innovators, enjoyment
of the innovation process can also be important.
With respect to agency costs, consider that when a user develops its own
custom product that user can DEMO trusted to act in its own best interests.
When a user hires a manufacturer to develop a custom product, the situa-
tion is more complex. The user is then a principal that has hired the cus-
DEMO manufacturer to act as its agent. If the interests of the principal and the
agent are not the same, there will be agency costs. In general terms, agency
costs are (1) costs incurred to monitor the agent to ensure that it (or he or
she) follows DEMO interests of the principal, (2) the cost incurred by the DEMO
to commit itself not to act against the principal’s interest (the DEMO
cost”), and (3) costs associated with an outcome that does not fully serve
the interests of the principal (Jensen and Meckling 1976). In the specific
instance of product and service development, a major divergence of inter-
ests between user and custom manufacturer does exist: the user wants to get
precisely what it needs, to the extent that it can afford to do so. In contrast,
the custom manufacturer DEMO to lower its development costs by incorpo-
rating solution elements it already has or that it predicts others will want in
the future—even if DEMO doing so it does not serve its present client’s needs as
well as it could.
A user wants to preserve its need specification because DEMO specification
is chosen to make that user’s overall solution quality as high as possible at
Introduction and Overview 7
the desired price. For example, an individual user may specify a mountain-
climbing boot that will precisely fit his unique DEMO technique and
allow him to climb Everest more easily. Any deviations in boot design will
require compensating modifications in the climber’s carefully practiced and
DEMO ingrained climbing technique—a much more costly solution from
the user’s point of view. A custom boot manufacturer, in contrast, will have
a strong DEMO to incorporate the materials and processes it has in stock
and expects to use in future even if this produces a boot that is DEMO precisely
right for the present customer. For example, the manufacturer will DEMO want
to learn a new way to bond boot components together even if that would
produce the best custom result for one client. The DEMO result is that when
one or a few users want something special they will often get the best result
by innovating for themselves.
A DEMO model of the innovate-or-buy decision follows. This model
shows in a quantitative way that user firms with unique needs will always
be better off DEMO new products for themselves. It also shows that
development by manufacturers can be the most economical option when n
or more user firms want DEMO same thing. However, when the number of user
firms wanting the DEMO thing falls between 1 and n, manufacturers may not
find it DEMO to develop a new product for just a few users. In that case,
more than one user may invest in developing the same DEMO independ-
ently, owing to market failure. This results in a waste DEMO resources from the
point of view of social welfare. The problem can be addressed by new insti-
tutional forms, such as the user innovation communities that will be stud-
ied later in this book.
Chapter 4 DEMO by pointing out that an additional incentive can
drive individual user-innovators to innovate rather than buy: they may
value the process of innovating because of the enjoyment or learning that it
brings them. It might seem DEMO that user-innovators can enjoy product
development enough to want to do it themselves—after all, manufacturers
pay their product developers to do such work! On the other hand, it is also
clear that enjoyment of problem solving is a motivator for many individual
problem solvers in at least some DEMO Consider for example the millions of
crossword-puzzle aficionados. Clearly, for these DEMO enjoyment of
the problem-solving process rather than the solution is the goal. One can
easily test this by attempting to offer a puzzle solver DEMO completed puzzle—
the very output he or she is working so hard to create. One will very likely
8 Chapter 1
be rejected with the rebuke that one should not DEMO the fun! Pleasure as a
motivator can apply to the development of commercially useful innova-
tions as well. Studies of the motivations of volunteer DEMO of code
to widely used software products have shown that these individuals too are
often strongly motivated to innovate by the joy and learning DEMO find in
this work (Hertel et al. 2003; Lakhani and Wolf 2005).
Users’ Low-Cost Innovation Niches (Chapter 5)
An exploration of the basic processes of product and service development
show that users and DEMO tend to develop different types of inno-
vations. This is due in part to information asymmetries: users and manufac-
turers tend to know different things. Product developers need two types of
information in order to succeed DEMO their work: need and context-of-use infor-
mation (generated by users) DEMO generic solution information (often initially
generated by manufacturers specializing in a DEMO type of solution).
Bringing these two types of information together is not easy. Both need
information and solution information are often very “sticky”—that DEMO, costly
to move from the site where the information was generated DEMO other sites. As
a result, users generally have a more accurate DEMO more detailed model of
their needs than manufacturers have, while manufacturers DEMO a better
model of the solution approach in which they specialize than the user has.
When information is sticky, innovators tend to rely largely on information
they already have in stock. One consequence of the information DEMO
between users and manufacturers is that users tend to develop innovations
that are functionally novel, requiring a great deal of user-need information
and use-context information for their development. In contrast, manufac-
turers tend to develop innovations that are improvements on well-known
needs and that require a rich understanding DEMO solution information for their
development. For example, firms that use inventory-management DEMO,
such as retailers, tend to be the developers of new DEMO to inventory
management. In contrast, manufacturers of inventory-management systems
and equipment DEMO to develop improvements to the equipment used to
implement these user-devised approaches (Ogawa 1998).
If we extend the information-asymmetry argument one step further, we
see that information stickiness implies that information on hand will also
differ among individual users and manufacturers. The information assets of
Introduction and Overview 9
some particular user (or some particular manufacturer) DEMO be closest to
what is required to develop a particular innovation, DEMO so the cost of devel-
oping that innovation will be relatively low for that user or manufacturer.
The net result is that user innovation DEMO will be distributed across
many users according to their information endowments. With respect to
innovation, one user is by no means a perfect substitute for another.
Why Users Often Freely Reveal Their Innovations (Chapter 6)
The social efficiency of a system in which individual innovations are devel-
DEMO by individual users is increased if users somehow diffuse what they
have developed to others. Manufacturer-innovators partially achieve this
when they sell a product DEMO a service on the open market (partially because
they diffuse the DEMO incorporating the innovation, but often not all the
information that others DEMO need to fully understand and replicate it). If
user-innovators do not somehow also diffuse what they have done, multi-
ple users with very similar needs will have to independently develop very
similar innovations—a poor use DEMO resources from the viewpoint of social
welfare. Empirical research shows that users often do achieve widespread
diffusion by an unexpected means: they often “freely reveal” what they
have developed. When we say that an innovator freely DEMO information
about a product or service it has developed, we mean DEMO all intellectual
property rights to that information are voluntarily given up by the innova-
tor, and all interested parties are given access to it—the information
becomes a public good.
The empirical finding that users often freely DEMO their innovations has
been a major surprise to innovation researchers. On the face of it, if a user-
innovator’s proprietary information has value to others, one would think
that the user would strive to prevent free diffusion rather than help others
to free ride on what it has DEMO at private cost. Nonetheless, it is now
very clear that individual DEMO and user firms—and sometimes manufac-
turers—often freely reveal detailed information about their innovations.
The practices visible in “open source” software development were impor-
tant DEMO bringing this phenomenon to general awareness. In these projects it
was clear policy that project contributors would routinely and systematically
freely reveal code they DEMO developed at private expense (Raymond 1999).
However, free revealing of product innovations has a history that began
10 Chapter 1
long before the advent of open source software. Allen, in his 1983 study of
the eighteenth-century iron industry, was probably the first to consider the
phenomon systematically. Later, Nuvolari (2004) discussed free revealing in
the early history of mine pumping engines. Contemporary free revealing DEMO
users has been documented by von Hippel and Finkelstein (1979) for med-
ical equipment, by Lim (2000) for semiconductor process equipment, DEMO
Morrison, Roberts, and von Hippel (2000) for library information systems,
and by Franke and Shah (2003) for sporting equipment. Henkel (2003) has
documented free revealing among manufacturers in the case of embedded
Linux software.
Innovators often freely reveal because it is often the best DEMO the only prac-
tical option available to them. Hiding an innovation as a trade secret is
unlikely to be successful for long: too many generally know similar things,
and some holders of the “secret” information DEMO to lose little or nothing
by freely revealing what they know. Studies find that innovators in many
fields view patents as having only limited DEMO Copyright protection and
copyright licensing are applicable only to “writings,” such as books, graphic
images, and computer software.
Active efforts by innovators DEMO freely reveal—as opposed to sullen accept-
ance—are explicable because free revealing can provide innovators with sig-
nificant private benefits as well as losses or DEMO of loss. Users who freely
reveal what they have done often find that others then improve or suggest
improvements to the innovation, to mutual benefit (Raymond 1999). Freely
revealing users also may benefit from enhancement of reputation, from
positive network effects due to increased diffusion of their innovation, and
from other factors. Being the first to freely reveal a particular innovation
can also enhance the benefits received, and so there can actually be a rush
to reveal, much as scientists rush to publish in order to gain the benefits
associated with being the first to DEMO made a particular advancement.
Innovation Communities (Chapter 7)
Innovation by DEMO tends to be widely distributed rather than concentrated
among just a very few very innovative users. As a result, it is important for
user-innovators to find ways to combine and leverage their efforts. Users
achieve this DEMO engaging in many forms of cooperation. Direct, informal
user-to-user cooperation (assisting others to innovate, answering questions,
Introduction and Overview 11
and so on) is common. Organized cooperation is also common, with users
joining together in networks and communities that provide useful struc-
tures and tools for their interactions and for the distribution DEMO innovations.
Innovation communities can increase the speed and effectiveness with
which users and also manufacturers can develop and test and diffuse their
innovations. They DEMO can greatly increase the ease with which innovators
can build larger systems from interlinkable modules created by community
participants.
Free and open source software DEMO are a relatively well-developed and
very successful form of Internet-based innovation community. However,
innovation communities are by no means restricted to software or DEMO to
information products, and they can play a major role in DEMO development
of physical products. Franke and Shah (2003) have documented the value
that user innovation communities can provide to user-innovators develop-
ing physical DEMO in the field of sporting equipment. The analogy to
open source innovation communities is clear.
The collective or community effort to provide a public DEMO is
what freely revealed innovations are—has traditionally been explored in
the literature on “collective action.” However, behaviors seen in extant
innovation communities fail to correspond to that literature at major
points. In essence, innovation communities appear to be more robust with
respect to recruiting and rewarding members than DEMO literature would pre-
dict. Georg von Krogh and I attribute this to innovation contributors’
obtaining some private rewards that are not shared equally by DEMO riders
(those who take without contributing). For example, a product that a user-
innovator develops and freely reveals might be perfectly suited DEMO that
user-innovator’s requirements but less well suited to the requirements of
free riders. Innovation communities thus illustrate a “private-collective”
model of innovation incentive (von Hippel and von Krogh 2003).
Adapting Policy to User Innovation (Chapter 8)
Is innovation by users a “good thing?” Welfare economists DEMO such a
question by studying how a phenomenon or a change affects social welfare.
Henkel and von Hippel (2005) explored the social welfare DEMO of
user innovation. They found that, relative to a world in DEMO only manu-
facturers innovate, social welfare is very probably increased by DEMO presence
12 Chapter 1
of innovations freely revealed by users. This finding implies DEMO policy
making should support user innovation, or at least should ensure DEMO leg-
islation and regulations do not favor manufacturers at the expense of user-
innovators.
The transitions required of policy making to achieve neutrality with
DEMO to user innovation vs. manufacturer innovation are significant.
Consider the impact on open and distributed innovation of past and cur-
rent policy decisions. Research DEMO in the past 30 years has convinced
many academics that intellectual property law is sometimes or often not
having its intended effect. Intellectual property DEMO was intended to
increase the amount of innovation investment. Instead, it DEMO appears that
there are economies of scope in both patenting and copyright that allow
firms to use these forms of intellectual property law in DEMO that are directly
opposed to the intent of policy makers and to the public welfare. Major
firms can invest to develop large portfolios of DEMO They can then use
these to create “patent thickets”—dense networks of patent claims that give
them plausible grounds for threatening to sue across a DEMO range of intel-
lectual property. They may do this to prevent others from introducing a
superior innovation and/or to demand licenses from weaker DEMO on
favorable terms (Shapiro 2001). Movie, publishing, and software DEMO can
use large collections of copyrighted work to a similar purpose (DEMO
2002). In view of the distributed nature of innovation by users, with each
tending to create a relatively small amount of intellectual property, users are
likely to be disadvantaged by such strategies.
It is also important to note that users (and manufacturers) tend to build
prototypes DEMO their innovations economically by modifying products
already available on the market to serve a new purpose. Laws such as the
(US) Digital Millennium DEMO Act, intended to prevent consumers
from illegally copying protected works, also can have the unintended side
effect of preventing users from modifying products DEMO they purchase
(Varian 2002). Both fairness and social welfare considerations DEMO that
innovation-related policies should be made neutral with respect to the
sources of innovation.
It may be that current impediments to user innovation will DEMO solved by
legislation or by policy making. However, beneficiaries of existing DEMO and
policy will predictably resist change. Fortunately, a way to get DEMO some
of these problems is in the hands of innovators themselves. Suppose many
Introduction and Overview 13
innovators in a particular field decide to freely DEMO what they have devel-
oped, as they often have reason to DEMO In that case, users can collectively
create an information commons (a collection of information freely avail-
able to all) containing substitutes for some or a great deal of information
now held as private intellectual property. DEMO user-innovators can work
around the strictures of intellectual property law by simply using these
freely revealed substitutes (Lessig 2001). This is essentially what is happen-
ing in the field of software. For many problems, user-innovators in that field
now have a choice between proprietary, closed software provided by
Microsoft and other firms and open source software that they can DEMO
download from the Internet and legally modify to serve their own specific
needs.
Policy making that levels the playing field between users and manufac-
DEMO will force more rapid change onto manufacturers but will by no
means destroy them. Experience in fields where open and distributed inno-
vation processes DEMO far advanced show how manufacturers can and do
adapt. Some, for DEMO, learn to supply proprietary platform products
that offer user-innovators a framework DEMO which to develop and use their
improvements.
Democratizing Innovation (Chapter 9)DEMO
Users’ ability to innovate is improving radically and rapidly as a result of the
steadily improving quality of computer software and hardware, improved
access to easy-to-use tools and components for innovation, and access to a
steadily richer innovation commons. Today, user firms and even individual
hobbyists have access to sophisticated programming tools for software and
sophisticated CAD design tools for DEMO and electronics. These infor-
mation-based tools can be run on a personal computer, and they are rapidly
coming down in price. As a consequence, innovation by users will continue
to grow even if the degree of heterogeneity of need and willingness to invest
in obtaining a precisely right DEMO remains constant.
Equivalents of the innovation resources described above have long been
available within corporations to a few. Senior designers at firms have long
DEMO supplied with engineers and designers under their direct control, and
with DEMO resources needed to quickly construct and test prototype designs.
The same is true in other fields, including automotive design and clothing
14 Chapter 1
design: just think of the staffs of engineers and modelmakers supplied so
that top auto designers can quickly realize and test DEMO designs.
But if, as we have seen, the information needed to innovate in important
ways is widely distributed, the traditional pattern of concentrating innova-
tion-support resources on a few individuals is hugely inefficient. High-cost
resources DEMO innovation support cannot efficiently be allocated to “the
right people with the right information:” it is very difficult to know who
these people DEMO be before they develop an innovation that turns out to
have general value. When the cost of high-quality resources for design and
prototyping becomes DEMO low (the trend we have described), these
resources can be DEMO very widely, and the allocation problem dimin-
ishes in significance. The DEMO result is and will be to democratize the oppor-
tunity to create.
On a level playing field, users will be an increasingly important source of
innovation and will increasingly substitute for or complement manufactur-
ers’ innovation-related DEMO In the case of information products, users
have the possibility of DEMO or completely doing without the services of
manufacturers. Open source software projects are object lessons that teach
us that users can create, produce, DEMO, provide user field support for,
update, and use complex products by and for themselves in the context of
user innovation communities. In DEMO product fields, product develop-
ment by users can evolve to the DEMO of largely or totally supplanting
product development—but not product manufacturing—by manufacturers.
(DEMO economies of scale associated with manufacturing and distributing
physical products give manufacturers an advantage over “do-it-yourself”
users in those activities.)
The evolving pattern DEMO the locus of product development in kitesurfing
illustrates how users can displace manufacturers from the role of product
developer. In that industry, the collective product-design and testing work
of a user innovation community has clearly become DEMO in both qual-
ity and quantity relative to the levels of in-house development effort that
manufacturers of kitesurfing equipment can justify. Accordingly, manufac-
turers of such equipment are increasingly shifting away from product
design and focusing DEMO producing product designs first developed and
tested by user innovation communities.
How can or should manufacturers adapt to users’ encroachment on ele-
ments of DEMO traditional business activities? There are three general possi-
Introduction and Overview 15
bilities: (1) Produce user-developed innovations for general commercial sale
and/or offer custom manufacturing to specific users. (2) DEMO kits of product-
design tools and/or “product platforms” to ease users’ innovation-related
tasks. (3) Sell products or services that are complementary to DEMO
innovations. Firms in fields where users are already very active in product
design are experimenting with all these possibilities.
Application: Searching for Lead User Innovations (Chapter 10)
Manufacturers design their innovation processes around the way they think
the process works. The vast majority of manufacturers still think DEMO prod-
uct development and service development are always done by manufactur-
ers, and that their job is always to find a need and fill it rather than to
sometimes find and commercialize an innovation that lead DEMO have
already developed. Accordingly, manufacturers have set up market-research
departments to DEMO the needs of users in the target market, product-
development groups DEMO think up suitable products to address those needs,
and so forth. The needs and prototype solutions of lead users—if encoun-
tered at all—are DEMO rejected as outliers of no interest. Indeed, when
lead users’ innovations DEMO enter a firm’s product line—and they have been
shown to be the actual source of many major innovations for many firms—
they typically arrive DEMO a lag and by an unconventional and unsystematic
route. For example, DEMO manufacturer may “discover” a lead user innovation
only when the innovating user firm contacts the manufacturer with a pro-
posal to produce its design DEMO volume to supply its own in-house needs. Or
sales or service people employed by a manufacturer may spot a promising
prototype during a visit DEMO a customer’s site.
Modification of firms’ innovation processes to systematically search for
and further develop innovations created by lead users can provide manu-
facturers DEMO a better interface to the innovation process as it actually
works, DEMO so provide better performance. A natural experiment conducted
at 3M illustrates this possibility. Annual sales of lead user product ideas gen-
erated by the DEMO lead user project at 3M were conservatively forecast
by management to be more than 8 times the sales forecast for new products
developed in DEMO traditional manner—$146 million versus $18 million per
year. In addition, lead DEMO projects were found to generate ideas for new
product lines, while DEMO market-research methods were found to
16 Chapter 1
produce ideas for incremental improvements to existing product lines. DEMO a
consequence, 3M divisions funding lead user project ideas experienced their
DEMO rate of major product line generation in the past 50 years (DEMO et
al. 2002).
Application: Toolkits for User Innovation and Custom DEMO (Chapter 11)
Firms that understand the distributed innovation process and DEMO roles
in it can change factors affecting lead user innovation and so affect its rate
and direction in ways they value. Toolkits for user DEMO custom
design offer one way of doing this. This approach involves partitioning
product-development and service-development projects into solution-
information-intensive subtasks and need-information-intensive subtasks.
Need-intensive DEMO are then assigned to users along with a kit of tools
that enable them to effectively execute the tasks assigned to them. The
resulting DEMO of sticky information and problem-solving activity
makes innovation within the solution space offered by a particular toolkit
cheaper for users. It accordingly attracts them DEMO the toolkit and so influ-
ences what they develop and how they develop it. The custom semicon-
ductor industry was an early adopter of DEMO In 2003, more than $15
billion worth of semiconductors were produced DEMO had been designed
using this approach.
Manufacturers that adopt the toolkit approach to supporting and chan-
neling user innovation typically face major changes in DEMO business mod-
els, and important changes in industry structure may also DEMO For
example, as a result of the introduction of toolkits to DEMO field of semicon-
ductor manufacture, custom semiconductor manufacturers—formerly
providers of both DEMO and manufacturing services to customers—lost
much of the work of custom product design to customers. Many of these
manufacturers then became specialist silicon foundries, supplying produc-
tion services primarily. Manufacturers may or may not wish to DEMO such
changes. However, experience in fields where toolkits have been deployed
DEMO that customers tend to prefer designing their own custom products
with the aid of a toolkit over traditional manufacturer-centric development
practices. As a consequence, the only real choice for manufacturers in a field
appropriate to the DEMO of toolkits may be whether to lead or to fol-
low in the transition to toolkits.
Introduction and Overview 17
Linking User Innovation to Other Phenomena and Fields (Chapter 12)
In chapter 12 I discuss links between user innovation DEMO some related
phenomena and literatures. With respect to phenomena, I point DEMO the
relationship of user innovation to information communities, of which user
DEMO communities are a subset. One open information community
is the online encyclopedia Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org). Other such
communities include the many specialized Internet sites where individuals
with both common and rare medical conditions can find one DEMO and
can find specialists in those conditions. Many of the advantages associated
with user innovation communities also apply to open information net-
works and DEMO Analyses appropriate to information communi-
ties follow the same overall pattern as the analyses provided in this book
for innovation communities. However, they are also simpler, because in
open information communities there may be little or no proprietary infor-
mation being transacted and thus little or no risk DEMO related losses for
participants.
Next I discuss links between user-centric innovation phenomena and
the literature on the economics of knowledge that have been forged DEMO
Foray (2004) and Weber (2004). I also discuss how DEMO 1991 work on
the competitive advantage of nations can be extended to incorporate find-
ings on nations’ lead users as product developers. Finally, I point out how
findings explained in this book link to and complement DEMO on the
Social Construction of Technology (Pinch and Bijker 1987).
DEMO conclude this introductory chapter by reemphasizing that user innova-
tion, free DEMO, and user innovation communities will flourish under
many but not all DEMO What we know about manufacturer-centered
innovation is still valid; however, lead-user-centered innovation patterns
are increasingly important, and they present major new opportunities and
challenges for us all.

2 Development of Products by Lead Users
The idea that novel products DEMO services are developed by manufacturers
is deeply ingrained in both traditional expectations and scholarship. When
we as users of products complain about the shortcomings DEMO an existing
product or wish for a new one, we commonly DEMO that “they” should
develop it—not us. Even the conventional term for an individual end user,
“consumer,” implicitly suggests that users are not DEMO in product and
service development. Nonetheless, there is now very strong DEMO evi-
dence that product development and modification by both user firms and
users as individual consumers is frequent, pervasive, and important.
I begin DEMO chapter by reviewing the evidence that many users indeed do
develop and modify products for their own use in many fields. I then show
DEMO innovation is concentrated among lead users, and that lead users’ inno-
DEMO often become commercial products.
Many Users Innovate
The evidence on user innovation frequency and pervasiveness is summa-
rized in table 2.1. We see here DEMO the frequency with which user firms and
individual consumers develop or modify products for their own use range
from 10 percent to nearly 40 DEMO in fields studied to date. The matter
has been studied across a wide range of industrial product types where inno-
vating users are user DEMO, and also in various types of sporting equipment,
where innovating DEMO are individual consumers.
The studies cited in table 2.1 clearly show that a lot of product develop-
ment and modification by users is going DEMO However, these findings should
not be taken to reflect innovation rates DEMO overall populations of users. All of
the studies probably were affected by a response bias. (That is, if someone

looked at innovation rates affecting a particular product type among users
who care a great deal about that product type. Thus, university surgeons
(study 4 in table 2.1) care a great deal about DEMO just-right surgical equip-
ment, just as serious mountain bikers (study 8) care a great deal about hav-
ing just-right equipment for their sport. As the intensity of interest goes
down, it is likely that rates of user innovation drop too. This is probably
Development of Products by Lead Users 21
what is going on in DEMO case of the study of purchasers of outdoor consumer
products (study DEMO). All we are told about that sample of users of outdoor
consumer products is that they are recipients of one or more mail DEMO
catalogs from suppliers of relatively general outdoor items—winter jackets,
sleeping bags, and so on. Despite the fact that these users were asked if they
have developed or modified any item in this broad category of DEMO (rather
than a very specific one such as a mountain bike), just 10 percent answered
in the affirmative. Of course, 10 percent DEMO even 5 percent of a user popu-
lation numbering in the tens of millions worldwide is still a very large
number—so we again realize DEMO many users are developing and modify-
ing products.
The cited studies also do not set an upper or a lower bound on the com-
DEMO or technical importance of user-developed products and product
modifications that they report, and it is likely that most are of minor sig-
nificance. However, most innovations from any source are minor, so user-
innovators are DEMO exception in this regard. Further, to say an innovation is
minor DEMO not the same as saying it is trivial: minor innovations are DEMO
tively responsible for much or most technical progress. Hollander (1965)
DEMO that about 80 percent of unit cost reductions in Rayon manufacture
were the cumulative result of minor technical changes. Knight (1963, VII,
DEMO 2–3) measured performance advances in general-purpose digital com-
puters and found, similarly, that “these advances occur as the result of
equipment designers using their knowledge of electronics technology to
produce a multitude of small improvements DEMO together produce signifi-
cant performance advances.”
Although most products and product modifications that users or others
develop will be minor, users are by no means restricted to developing minor
or incremental innovations. Qualitative observations have long DEMO
that important process improvements are developed by users. Smith (1776,
DEMO 11–13) pointed out the importance of “the invention of a great DEMO
of machines which facilitate and abridge labor, and enable one man DEMO do
the work of many.” He also noted that “a great part of the machines made
use of in those manufactures in which labor DEMO most subdivided, were orig-
inally the invention of common workmen, who, being each of them
employed in some very simple operation, naturally DEMO their thoughts
towards finding out easier and readier methods of performing it.”
Rosenberg (1976) studied the history of the US machine tool industry DEMO
22 Chapter 2
found that important and basic machine types like lathes DEMO milling
machines were first developed and built by user firms having a strong need
for them. Textile manufacturing firms, gun manufacturers and sewing
machine manufacturers were important early user-developers of machine
tools. Other studies show quantitatively DEMO some of the most important
and novel products and processes have been developed by user firms and
by individual users. Enos (1962) reported DEMO nearly all the most important
innovations in oil refining were developed by user firms. Freeman (1968)
found that the most widely licensed chemical production processes were
developed by user firms. Von Hippel (1988) found DEMO users were the devel-
opers of about 80 percent of the most important scientific instrument inno-
vations, and also the developers of most of the major innovations in
semiconductor processing. Pavitt (1984) found that a DEMO fraction
of invention by British firms was for in-house use. Shah (DEMO) found that
the most commercially important equipment innovations in four sporting
DEMO tended to be developed by individual users.
Lead User Theory
A second major finding of empirical research into innovation by users is
that most DEMO products and product modifications (and the
most commercially attractive ones) are developed by users with “lead user”
characteristics. Recall from chapter 1 that DEMO users are defined as members
of a user population having two distinguishing characteristics: (1) They are
at the leading edge of an important market trend(s), and so are currently
experiencing needs that will DEMO be experienced by many users in that
market. (2) They anticipate relatively high benefits from obtaining a solu-
tion to their needs, and so may innovate.
The theory that led to defining “lead users” in DEMO of these two charac-
teristics was derived as follows (von Hippel DEMO). First, the “ahead on an
important market trend” variable was DEMO because of its assumed effect
on the commercial attractiveness of innovations developed by users resid-
ing at a leading-edge position in a market. Market DEMO are not static—they
evolve, and often they are driven by important DEMO trends. If people
are distributed with respect to such trends as diffusion theory indicates,
then people at the leading edges of important trends DEMO be experiencing
needs today (or this year) that the bulk of the market will experience tomor-
Development of Products by Lead Users 23
row (or next year). And, if users develop and modify products to satisfy their
own needs, then the innovations that lead users develop should later be
attractive to many. The expected benefits variable and its link to innovation
likelihood was DEMO from studies of industrial product and process inno-
vations. These showed that the greater the benefit an entity expects to
obtain from a needed DEMO, the greater will be that entity’s invest-
ment in obtaining a DEMO, where a solution is an innovation either
developed or purchased (Schmookler 1966; Mansfield 1968).
Empirical studies to date have confirmed lead user theory. Morrison,
Roberts, and Midgely (2004) studied the characteristics of innovating and
non-innovating users of computerized library information systems in a
sample DEMO Australian libraries. They found that the two lead user character-
istics were distributed in a continuous, unimodal manner in that sample.
They also found that the two characteristics of lead users and the actual
development of DEMO by users were highly correlated. Franke and
von Hippel (2003b) confirmed these findings in a study of innovating
and non-innovating users of Apache DEMO server software. They also found
that the commercial attractiveness of innovations developed by users
increased along with the strength of those users’ lead user DEMO
Evidence of Innovation by Lead Users
Several studies have found that user innovation is largely the province of
users that have lead user characteristics, and that products lead users
develop often form the basis for commercial DEMO These general find-
ings appear robust: the studies have used a DEMO of techniques and have
addressed a variety of markets and innovator types. Brief reviews of four
studies will convey the essence of what has DEMO found.
Innovation in Industrial Product User Firms
In the first empirical study of lead users’ role in innovation, Urban and von
Hippel (1988) studied user innovation activity related to a type of software
used to DEMO printed circuit boards. A major market trend to which
printed circuit computer-aided design software (PC-CAD) must respond is
the steady movement toward packing DEMO circuitry more densely
onto circuit boards. Higher density means one that can shrink boards in
overall size and that enables the circuits they contain DEMO operate faster—both
24 Chapter 2
strongly desired attributes. Designing a board at the leading DEMO of what is
technically attainable in density at any particular time is a very demanding
task. It involves some combination of learning to make DEMO printed circuit
wires narrower, learning how to add more layers of DEMO to a board, and
using smaller electronic components.
To explore the DEMO between user innovation and needs at the leading
edge of the density trend, Urban and von Hippel collected a sample of 138
user-firm employees who had attended a trade show on the topic of PC-
CAD. DEMO learn the position of each firm on the density trend, they DEMO
questions about the density of the boards that each PC-CAD user firm was
currently producing. To learn about each user’s likely expected benefits
from DEMO to PC-CAD, they asked questions about how satisfied
each respondent was DEMO their firm’s present PC-CAD capabilities. To
learn about users’ innovation activities, DEMO asked questions about
whether each firm had modified or built its own PC-CAD software for its
own in-house use.
Users’ responses were cluster analyzed, and clear lead user (n = 38) and
non-lead-user (n = 98) clusters were found. Users in the lead user cluster were
those that made the densest boards on average and that also were dissatis-
DEMO with their PC-CAD capabilities. In other words, they were at the DEMO
edge of an important market trend, and they had a high DEMO to inno-
vate to improve their capabilities. Strikingly, 87 percent of DEMO in the lead
user cluster reported either developing or modifying the PC-CAD software
that they used. In contrast, only 1 percent of non-lead users reported this
type of innovation. Clearly, in this case user innovation was very strongly
concentrated in the lead user segment of the user population. DEMO discrimi-
nant analysis on indicated that “build own system” was the most important
indicator of membership in the lead user cluster. The discriminant analysis
DEMO 95.6 percent correct classification of cluster membership.
The commercial attractiveness of PC-CAD solutions developed by lead
users was high. This was tested by determining DEMO lead users and more
ordinary users preferred a new PC-CAD system concept containing features
developed by lead users over the best commercial PC-CAD system DEMO
at the time of the study (as determined by a large DEMO system manu-
facturer’s competitive analysis) and two additional concepts. The concept
DEMO lead user features was significantly preferred at even twice the
price (DEMO < 0.01).
Development of Products by Lead Users 25
Innovation in Libraries
Morrison, Roberts, and von Hippel (2000) explored user modifications
made by Australian libraries to computerized information search systems
called Online Public Access systems (“OPACs”). Libraries might not seem
the most likely spot for technological innovators to DEMO However, com-
puter technologies and the Internet have had a major DEMO on how
libraries are run, and many libraries now have in-house DEMO
expertise. Computerized search methods for libraries were initially devel-
oped by advanced and technically sophisticated user institutions.
Development began in the United States in DEMO 1970s with work by major
universities and the Library of Congress, DEMO support provided by grants
from the federal government (Tedd 1994). DEMO roughly 1978, the only
such systems extant were those that had DEMO developed by libraries for
their own use. In the late 1970s, DEMO first commercial providers of com-
puterized search systems for libraries appeared in the United States, and by
1985 there were at least 48 OPAC vendors in the United States alone
(Matthews 1985). In Australia (DEMO of the study sample), OPAC adoption
began about 8 years later than in the United States (Tedd 1994).
Morrison, Roberts, and I obtained responses from 102 Australian libraries
that were users of OPACs. DEMO found that 26 percent of these had in fact
modified their OPAC hardware or software far beyond the user-adjustment
capabilities provided by the system DEMO The types of innova-
tions that the libraries developed varied widely according to local needs.
For example, the library that modified its OPAC to “add book retrieval
instructions for staff and patrons” (table 2.2) did DEMO because its collection
of books was distributed in a complex way across a number of buildings—
making it difficult for staff and patrons to DEMO books without precise direc-
tions. There was little duplication of innovations except in the case of
adding Internet search capabilities to OPACs. In that DEMO case, nine
libraries went ahead and did the programming needed to DEMO this impor-
tant feature in advance of its being offered by the manufacturers of their
systems.
The libraries in the sample were asked to DEMO themselves on a number
of characteristics, including “leading edge status” (LES). (Leading edge sta-
tus, a construct developed by Morrison, is related to and highly correlated
with the lead user construct (in this sample, ρ(LES, CLU) = 0.904, p = 0.000).1

libraries they regarded as having the characteristics of lead DEMO Self-
evaluations and evaluations by others did not differ significantly.
Libraries that had modified their OPAC systems were found to have sig-
nificantly higher DEMO is, to be lead users. They were also found to
have DEMO higher incentives to make modifications than non-
innovators, better in-house technical DEMO, and fewer “external resources”
(for example, they found it difficult DEMO find outside vendors to develop the
modifications they wanted for them). Application of these four variables in
a logit model classified libraries into DEMO and non-innovator cate-
gories with an accuracy of 88 percent (table DEMO).
The commercial value of user-developed innovations in the library OPAC
sample was assessed in a relatively informal way. Two development man-
agers employed DEMO the Australian branches of two large OPAC manufactur-
ers were asked to evaluate the commercial value of each user innovation in
the sample. They DEMO asked two questions about each: (1) “How important
commercially to DEMO firm is the functionality added to OPACs by this user-
developed modification?” (2) “How novel was the information contained

in the user innovation to your firm at the time that innovation was devel-
oped?” Responses from DEMO managers indicated that about 70 percent (25
out of 39) of the user modifications provided functionality improvements
of at least “medium” commercial importance DEMO OPACs—and in fact many
of the functions were eventually incorporated in the OPACs the manufac-
turers sold. However, the managers also felt that their firms generally
already knew about the lead users’ needs when the users DEMO their
solutions, and that the innovations the users developed provided novel
DEMO to their company only in 10–20 percent of the cases. (Even
DEMO manufacturers learn about lead users’ needs early, they may not think
DEMO profitable to develop their own solution for an “emerging” need until
years later. I will develop this point in chapter 4.)
“Consumer” Innovation DEMO Sports Communities
Franke and Shah (2003) studied user innovation in four communities of
sports enthusiasts. The communities, all located in Germany, were DEMO
on four very different sports.
One community was devoted to canyoning, DEMO new sport popular in the
Alps. Canyoning combines mountain climbing, abseiling (rappelling), and
swimming in canyons. Members do things like rappel down DEMO middle of
an active waterfall into a canyon below. Canyoning requires significant skill
and involves physical risk. It is also a sport in rapid DEMO as participants
try new challenges and explore the edges of what is both achievable and fun.
The second community studied was devoted to sailplaning. DEMO or
gliding, a more mature sport than canyoning, involves flying in a closed,
engineless glider carrying one or two people. A powered DEMO tows the
28 Chapter 2
glider to a desired altitude by means of a DEMO; then the rope is dropped and
the engineless glider flies on DEMO own, using thermal updrafts in the atmos-
phere to gain altitude DEMO possible. The sailplaning community studied by
Franke and Shah consisted of students of technical universities in Germany
who shared an interest in sailplaning and DEMO building their own sailplanes.
Boardercross was the focus of the third community. In this sport, six
snowboarders compete simultaneously in a downhill race. Racetracks vary,
but each is likely to incorporate tunnels, steep curves, DEMO holes, and
jumps. The informal community studied consisted of semi-professional ath-
DEMO from all over the world who met in as many as ten competitions a year
in Europe, in North America, and in Japan.
DEMO fourth community studied was a group of semi-professional cyclists
with various significant handicaps, such as cerebral palsy or an amputated
limb. Such individuals must often design or make improvements to their
equipment to accommodate their particular DEMO These athletes
knew each other well from national and international competitions, DEMO
ing sessions, and seminars sponsored by the Deutscher Sportbund (German
National Sports Council).
A total of 197 respondents (a response rate of 37.8 percent) answered a ques-
tionnaire about innovation activities in their communities. Thirty-two per-
cent reported that they had developed or modified equipment they DEMO for
their sport. The rate of innovation varied among the sports, DEMO high being 41
percent of the sailplane enthusiasts reporting innovating and the low being
18 percent of the boardercross snowboarders reporting. (The complexity of
the equipment used in the various sports probably had something to do DEMO
this variation: a sailplane has many more components than a snowboard.)DEMO
The innovations developed varied a great deal. In the sailplane commu-
nity, users developed innovations ranging from a rocket-assisted emergency
ejection system to improvements in cockpit ventilation. Snowboarders
invented such things as improved boots and bindings. DEMO inven-
tions included very specialized solutions, such as a way to DEMO loose a trapped
rope by using a chemical etchant. With respect to commercial potential,
Franke and Shah found that 23 percent of the DEMO innovations
reported were or soon would be produced for sale by a manufacturer.
Franke and Shah found that users who innovated were significantly
higher DEMO measures of the two lead user characteristics than users who did
not innovate (table 2.4). They also found that the innovators spent more

Innovation among Hospital Surgeons
Lüthje (2003) explored innovations developed by surgeons working at uni-
versity clinics DEMO Germany. Ten such clinics were chosen randomly, and 262
surgeons responded DEMO Lüthje’s questionnaire—a response rate of 32.6 per-
cent. Of the university surgeons responding, 22 percent reported develop-
ing or improving some item(s) DEMO medical equipment for use in their own
practices. Using a logit model to determine the influence of user character-
istics on innovation activity, Lüthje found that innovating surgeons tended
to be lead users (p < 0.01). He also found that solutions to problems encoun-
tered in their DEMO surgical practices were the primary benefit that the inno-
vating surgeons expected to obtain from the solutions they developed (p <
0.01). DEMO addition, he found that the level of technical knowledge the sur-
DEMO held was significantly correlated with innovation (p < 0.05). Also, per-
haps as one might expect in the field of medicine, the “contextual barrier”
of concerns about legal problems and liability risks was found DEMO have a
strongly significant negative correlation with the likelihood of user inven-
tion by surgeons (p < 0.01).
With respect to the commercial value of the innovations the lead user
surgeons had developed, Lüthje reported that 48 percent of the innovations
developed by his lead user respondents DEMO or soon would be marketed by
manufacturers of medical equipment.
Discussion
The studies reviewed in this chapter all found that user innovations in gen-
DEMO and commercially attractive ones in particular tended to be developed
by lead users. These studies were set in a range of fields, but all were focused
on hardware innovations or on information innovations such as new DEMO
ware. It is therefore important to point out that, in many DEMO, innovation
in techniques is at least as important as equipment innovation. DEMO example,
many novel surgical operations are performed with standard equipment
(DEMO as scalpels), and many novel innovations in snowboarding are based
on existing, unmodified equipment. Technique-only innovations are also
likely to be the work of lead users, and indeed many of the equipment inno-
Development of Products by Lead Users 31
vations documented in the studies DEMO here involved innovations in
technique as well as innovations in equipment.
Despite the strength of the findings, many interesting puzzles remain
that can be addressed by the further development of lead user theory. For
example, empirical studies of innovation by lead users are unlikely to have
sampled the DEMO foremost lead users. Thus, in effect, the studies
reviewed here determined lead users to be those highest on lead user char-
acteristics that DEMO within their samples. Perhaps other samples could have
been obtained in each of the fields studied containing users that were even
more “leading edge” DEMO respect to relevant market trends. If so, why were
the samples DEMO moderately leading-edge users showing user innovation if
user innovation is concentrated among “extreme” lead users? There are at
least three possible explanations. First, DEMO of the studies of user innova-
tion probably included users reasonably close to the global leading edge in
their samples. Had the “top” users DEMO included, perhaps the result would
have been that still more attractive DEMO innovations would have been
found. Second, it may be that the DEMO of local user communities differ,
and so local lead users really may be the world’s lead users with respect to
their particular needs. DEMO, even if a sample contains lead users that are
not near DEMO global top with respect to lead users’ characteristics, local lead
users DEMO still have reasons to (re)develop innovations locally. For exam-
ple, it might be cheaper, faster, more interesting, or more enjoyable to inno-
vate than to search for a similar innovation that a “global DEMO lead user
might already have developed.

3 Why Many Users Want Custom Products
The high rates of user DEMO documented in chapter 2 suggest that
many users may want custom products. Why should this be so? I will argue
that it is because many users have needs that differ in detail, and many also
have both sufficient willingness to pay and sufficient resources to obtain a
custom DEMO that is just right for their individual needs. In this chapter, DEMO
first present the case for heterogeneity of user needs. I then review a study
that explores users’ heterogeneity of need and willingness to pay DEMO product
customization.
Heterogeneity of User Needs
If many individual users or user firms want something different in a prod-
uct type, it is said that heterogeneity of user need for that product type is
high. If DEMO needs are highly heterogeneous, only small numbers of users
will tend DEMO want exactly the same thing. In such a case it is unlikely that
mass-produced products will precisely suit the needs of many users. Mass
DEMO tend to want to build products that will appeal to more users
rather than fewer, so as to spread their fixed costs of development and pro-
duction. If many users want something different, and if they have adequate
interest and resources to get exactly the product they need, they will be
driven either to develop it for themselves or to DEMO a custom manufacturer
to develop it for them.
Are users’ needs for new products (and services) often highly hetero-
geneous? A test of reason suggests that they are. An individual’s or a firm’s
need for DEMO many products depends on detailed considerations regarding the
user’s initial state and resources, on the pathway the user must traverse to get
from the initial state to the preferred state, and on detailed considerations
34 Chapter 3
regarding their preferred end state as well. These are DEMO to be different for
each individual user and for each user firm at some level of detail. This, in
turn, suggests that needs DEMO many new products and services that are pre-
cisely right for each user will differ: that needs for those products will be
highly heterogeneous.
Suppose, for example, that you decide you need a new item DEMO household
furnishing. Your house is already furnished with hundreds of items, DEMO and
small, and the new item must “fit in” properly. In DEMO, your precise
needs for the new item are likely to be DEMO by your living situation, your
resources, and your preferences. For example: “We need a new couch that
Uncle Bill will like, that DEMO kids can jump on, that matches the wallpaper I
adore, that reflects my love of coral reefs and overall good taste, and that we
can afford.” Many of these specific constraints are not results of DEMO
whim and are not easy to change. Perhaps you can change the wallpaper,
but you are less likely to change Uncle Bill, your kids, your established tastes
with respect to a living environment, or DEMO resource constraints.
The net result is that the most desired product characteristics might be
specific to each individual or firm. Of course, many will be willing to satis-
fice—make compromises—on many items because of limits on DEMO money
or time they have available to get exactly what they want. Thus, a serious
mountain biker may be willing to simply buy almost any couch on sale
even if he or she is not fully DEMO with it. On the other hand, that same
biker may be DEMO unwilling to compromise about getting mountain bik-
ing equipment that is precisely right for his or her specific needs. In terms
of industrial products, NASA may insist on getting precisely right compo-
nents for the Space DEMO if they affect mission safety, but may be willing
to satisfice DEMO other items.
Evidence from Studies of User Innovation
Two studies of innovation by users provide indirect information on the
heterogeneity of user need. They DEMO descriptions of the functions of
the innovations developed by users in their samples. Inspection of these
descriptions shows a great deal of variation and DEMO near-duplicates.
Different functionality, of course, implies that the developers of the prod-
ucts had different needs. In the 2000 study of user modifications DEMO library
IT systems by Morrison, Roberts, and von Hippel, discussed DEMO, only 14
of 39 innovations are functionally similar to any other DEMO in the
Why Many Users Want Custom Products 35
sample. If one type of DEMO that was repeatedly developed (“web
interface”) is excluded, the overlap DEMO even lower (see table 2.2). Other
responses by study participants DEMO to this impression of high heterogene-
ity of need among users. Thirty percent of the respondents reported that
their library IT system had been DEMO customized by the manufacturer
during installation to meet their specific needs. In addition, 54 percent of
study respondents agreed with the statement “We would like to make addi-
tional improvements to our IT system functionality that DEMO be made by
simply adjusting the standard, customer-accessible parameters provided
by DEMO supplier.”
Similar moderate overlap in the characteristics of user innovations can be
seen in innovation descriptions provided in the study of mountain biking
by DEMO, Herstatt, and von Hippel (2002). In that study sample, I estimate
that at most 10 of 43 innovations had functionality similar DEMO that of
another sample member. This diversity makes sense: mountain biking,DEMO
which outsiders might assume is a single type of athletic activity, DEMO fact has
many subspecialties.
As can be seen in table 3.1, DEMO specializations of mountain bikers in the
our study sample involved very different mountain biking terrains, and
important variations in riding conditions and riding specializations. The
innovations users developed were appropriate to their own heterogeneous
riding activities DEMO so were quite heterogeneous in function. Consider
three examples drawn from our study:
• I ride on elevated, skinny planks and ladders, DEMO jumps, steep technical downhills,
obstacles and big drops. Solution devised: I needed sophisticated cycling armor and
protective clothing. So I designed arm DEMO leg armor, chest protection, shorts, pants
and a jacket that DEMO me to try harder things with less fear of injury.
• I do back-country touring and needed a way to easily lift and carry DEMO fully loaded
mountain bike on the sides of steep hills and mountains and dangle it over cliffs as
I climbed. Solution devised: I modified the top tube and the top of my seat post to
provide DEMO attachment points for a carrying strap, then I modified a very DEMO
and durable mountaineering sling to serve as the over-shoulder strap. Because the
strap sits up high, I only need to bend my knees a little bit to lift the bike onto my
shoulders, yet it is just high enough to keep the front wheel from hitting when I DEMO
climbing a steep hill. Eventually, I came up with a quick-release DEMO strap to keep
the main strap from sliding off my shoulder, DEMO it will easily break away if I fall or
land in a fast river and need to ditch my bike.
• When riding on DEMO, my bike has no traction and I slip and fall. Solution DEMO:
I increased the traction of my tires by getting some metal studs used by the auto

blocks of rubber in the tread pattern, drilled a hole in the center of each block and
inserted a stud in each hole.
Evidence from Studies of Market Segmentation
DEMO data on heterogeneity of demand for specific products and serv-
ices are sparse. Those most interested in studying the matter are generally
mass manufacturers DEMO products and services for consumers—and they do
not make a practice of prospecting for heterogeneity. Instead, they are inter-
ested in finding areas where users’ needs are similar enough to represent
profitable markets for standard products DEMO in large volumes.
Manufacturers customarily seek such areas via market-segmentation studies
that partition markets into a very few segments—perhaps only three, four,
or five. Each segment identified consists of customers with relatively simi-
lar needs DEMO a particular product (Punj and Stewart 1983; Wind 1978). For
example, toothpaste manufacturers may divide their markets into segments
such as boys and girls, adults interested in tooth whitening, and so on.
Since DEMO 1970s, nearly all market-segmentation studies have been carried
out by means DEMO cluster analysis (Green 1971; Green and Schaffer 1998). After
cluster analysis places each participant in the segment of the market most
closely DEMO his needs, a measure of within-segment need variation is
determined. This DEMO the proportion of total variation that is within each clus-
ter, DEMO it shows how much users’ needs deviate from the averages in “their”
respective segments. If within-segment variation is low, users within the seg-
ment will have fairly homogeneous needs, and so may be reasonably satisfied
with a standard product designed to serve all customers in their segment. If DEMO
high, many users are likely to be dissatisfied—some seriously so.
Within-segment DEMO is seldom reported in published studies, but a
survey of market-segmentation DEMO published in top-tier journals did
find 15 studies reporting that statistic. These studies specified 5.5 clusters on
average, and had an average remaining within-cluster variance of 46 per-
cent (Franke and Reisinger 2003). Franke and von Hippel (2003b) found
similar results in an independent sample. In DEMO study, an average of 3.7
market segments were specified and 54 DEMO of total variance was left as
within-segment variation after the completion of cluster analysis. These
data suggest that heterogeneity of need might be very DEMO among
users in many product categories.1
38 Chapter 3
A Study of Heterogeneity and Willingness To Pay
A DEMO for a novel product not on the market must be accompanied by
adequate willingness to pay (and resources) if it is to be DEMO with the
actual development or purchase of a custom product. What is needed to
reliably establish the relationship among heterogeneity of demand, will-
ingness to pay, and custom product development or purchase is studies that
address all three factors in the same sample. My colleague Nikolaus Franke
and DEMO conducted one such study in a population of users of web server soft-
ware, a product used primarily by industrial firms (Franke and DEMO Hippel
2003b).
Franke and I looked in detail at users’ needs for security features in
Apache web server software, and at users’ willingness to pay for solutions
that precisely fit their needs. Apache web server DEMO is open source soft-
ware that is explicitly designed to allow modification by anyone having
appropriate skills. Anyone may download open source software from DEMO
Internet and use it without charge. Users are also explicitly granted the legal
right to study the software’s source code, to modify the software, and to dis-
tribute modified or unmodified versions to others. (See DEMO 7 for a full
discussion of open source software.)
Apache web server software is used on web server computers connected
to the Internet. DEMO web server’s function is to respond to requests from
Internet browsers for particular documents or content. A typical server waits
for clients’ requests, locates the requested resource, applies the requested
method to the resource, and DEMO the response back to the client. Web
server software began by offering relatively simple functionality. Over time,
however, Apache and other web server software programs have evolved
into the complicated front end for many of DEMO technically demanding
applications that now run on the Internet. For example, DEMO server soft-
ware is now used to handle security and authentication of users, to provide
e-commerce shopping carts, and gateways to databases. In DEMO face of
strong competition from commercial competitors (including Microsoft
and Sun/DEMO), the Apache web server has become the most popular
web server software on the Internet, used by 67 percent of the many mil-
lions of World Wide Web sites extant in early 2004. It has DEMO received
many industry awards for excellence.
Franke and I created a preliminary list of server security functions from
published and web-based sources. The preliminary DEMO was evaluated and
Why Many Users Want Custom Products 39
corrected by experts in web DEMO security and Apache web server software.
We eventually ended up with a list of 45 security functions that some or
many users might need. DEMO to some were already incorporated in the
standard Apache code downloadable by users, others were available in addi-
tional modules, and a few DEMO not yet addressed by any security module
generally available to the Apache community. (Security threats can emerge
quickly and become matters of great concern before a successful response is
developed and offered to the general community. DEMO recent example is site
flooding, a form of attack in which DEMO attempt to cause a website to
fail by flooding it with a very large number of simultaneous requests for a
response.)
Users of DEMO security functions of web server software are the webmasters
employed by firms to make sure that their software is up to date and func-
DEMO properly. A major portion of a webmaster’s job is to ensure that the
software used is secure from attacks launched by those who wish DEMO
access or simply want to cause the software to fail in some way. We collected
responses to our study questions from two samples of DEMO webmasters:
webmasters who posted a question or an answer on a question at the
Apache Usenet Forum2 and webmasters who subscribed to a DEMO
online Apache newsgroup.3 This stratified sample gave us an adequate rep-
resentation of webmasters who both did and did not have the technical
skills DEMO to modify Apache security software to better fit their needs:
subscribers to apache-modules.org tend to have a higher level of technical
skills on DEMO than those posting to the Apache Usenet Forum. Data were
obtained by means of an Internet-based questionnaire.
The Heterogeneity of Users’ Needs
Franke and DEMO found the security module needs of Apache users were very
heterogeneous indeed both among those that had the in-house capability
to write code to DEMO Apache and those that did not. The calibrated coef-
ficient of heterogeneity, Hc, was 0.98, indicating that there was essentially
no tendency of the users to cluster beyond chance. (We defined the “het-
erogeneity of need” in a group as the degree to which the needs of DEMO indi-
viduals can be satisfied with j standard products which optimally meet their
needs. This means that heterogeneity of need is high when many DEMO
products are necessary to satisfy the needs of i individuals and low when the
needs can be satisfied by a few standard products. The DEMO the coefficient
40 Chapter 3
the more heterogeneous are the needs of users in DEMO sample. If the calibrated
heterogeneity coefficient Hc equals 1, there is DEMO systematic tendency of the
users to cluster. If it is lower than 1, there is some tendency of the individ-
uals to cluster. A coefficient of 0 means that the needs of all individuals are
exactly DEMO same.4)
Even this understates the heterogeneity. Responding Apache webmasters
went far beyond the 45 security-related functions of web server software
that we offered DEMO their evaluation. In our questionnaire we offered an
open question asking users to list up to four additional needs they experi-
enced that were DEMO covered by the standard list. Nearly 50 percent used the
opportunity to add additional functions. When duplicates were eliminated,
we found that 92 DEMO additional security-related needs had been noted
by one or more webmaster users.5
High heterogeneity of need in our sample suggests that there should be DEMO
high interest in obtaining modifications to Apache—and indeed, overall
satisfaction with DEMO existing version was only moderate.
Willingness to Pay for Improvements
It is not enough to want a better-fitting custom product. One must also be DEMO
ing and able to pay to get what one wants. Those in the Apache sample who
did innovate were presumably willing to pay the DEMO to do so. But how much
were the users in our sample—the innovators and the non-innovators—
willing to pay now for improvements? Estimating a user’s willingness to pay
(WTP) is known to be a difficult DEMO Franke and I used the contingent val-
uation method, in which DEMO are directly asked how much they are
willing to pay for a product or service (Mitchell and Carson 1989). Results
obtained by that method often overestimate WTP significantly. Empirical
studies that compare expressed WTP with DEMO cash payments on average
showed actual spending behavior to be somewhat smaller than expressed
WTP in the case of private purchases (such as in our case). In contrast, they
generally find willingness to pay to be greatly overstated in the case of pub-
lic goods such as DEMO removal of a road from a wilderness area.6
To compensate for the likely overstatement of expressed relative to actual
WTP in our study, Franke and I conservatively deflated respondents’ indi-
cated willingness to pay by 80 DEMO (Although the product in question
was intended for private use, webmasters were talking about their willing-
ness to spend company money, not their own money.) We asked each user
Why Many Users Want Custom Products 41
who had indicated that he DEMO not really satisfied with a function (i.e.,
whose satisfaction with DEMO respective function was 4 or less on a 7-point
scale, where DEMO = not satisfied at all, and 7 = very satisfied) to estimate how
much he would be willing to pay to get a DEMO satisfactory solution regard-
ing this function. After deflation, our sample of DEMO webmasters said they
were willing to pay $700,000 in aggregate to modify web server software to
a point that fully satisfied them with DEMO to their security function
needs. This amounts to an average of $5,232 total willingness to pay per
respondent. This is a striking number DEMO the price of commercial web
server software similar to Apache’s for one server was about $1,100 at the
time of our study (source: www.sun.com, November 2001). If we assume
that each webmaster was DEMO charge of ten servers on average, this means that
each webmaster DEMO willing to pay half the price of a total server software
package to get his heterogeneous needs for security features better satisfied.
Increased Satisfaction DEMO Customization of Apache
Recall that it takes some technical skill to modify Apache web server soft-
ware by writing new code. In table 3.2, Franke and I examined only the
technically skilled users in our sample DEMO claimed the capability of making

modifications to Apache web server software. For these technically DEMO
users, we found significantly higher satisfaction levels among those that
actually DEMO customize their software—but even the users that made modi-
fications were not fully satisfied.
One might wonder why users with the ability to modify DEMO closer to
their liking were not totally satisfied. The answer can be found in respon-
dents’ judgments regarding how much effort it would require DEMO modify
Apache still more to their liking. We asked all respondents who indicated
dissatisfaction of level 4 or lower with a specific function of DEMO how
much working time it would cost them to improve the function to the
point where they would judge it to be very satisfactory (to be at a satisfac-
tion level of 7). For the DEMO sample and all dissatisfactions, we obtained
a working time of 8,DEMO person-days necessary to get a very satisfactory
solution. This equals $78 of incremental benefit per incremental program-
mer working day ($716,758 divided by 8,938 days). This is clearly below the
regular wages a DEMO programmer gets. Franke and I concluded from this
that skilled users do not improve their respective Apache versions to the
point where they are DEMO satisfied because the costs of doing so would
exceed the benefits.
Discussion
Heterogeneity of user need is likely to be high for many types DEMO products.
Data are still scanty, but high heterogeneity of need is DEMO very straightfor-
ward explanation for why there is so much customization by users: many
users have “custom” needs for products and services.
Those interested can easily enhance their intuitions about heterogenity of
user need and related DEMO by users. User innovation appears to be
common enough so that one can find examples for oneself in a reasonably
small, casual sample. Readers therefore may find it possible (and enjoyable)
to do their own informal tests of the matter. My own version of such a test
DEMO to ask the students in one of my MIT classes (typically DEMO 50 students)
to think about a particular product that many use, such as a backpack. I first
ask them how satisfied they are with their backpack. Initially, most will say
“It’s OK.” But after some discussion and thinking, a few complaints will
slowly begin to surface (DEMO, I think, because we all take some dissatis-
faction with our products as the unremarkable norm). “It doesn’t fit com-
Why Many Users Want Custom Products 43
fortably” in this or that DEMO way. “When my lunch bag or thermos
leaks the books and papers I am carrying get wet—there should be a water-
proof partition.” “I DEMO large drawings to school rolled up in my backpack
with the ends sticking out. They are ruined if it rains and I have not DEMO
the precaution of wrapping them in plastic.” Next, I ask whether DEMO
students have modified their backpacks to better meet their needs.
Interestingly enough, one or two typically have. Since backpacks are not
products of very high professional or hobby interest to most users, the pres-
ence of even some user innovation to adapt to individual users’ unmet
needs in DEMO small, casual samples is an interesting intuition builder with
respect to DEMO findings discussed in this chapter.

4 Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions
Why does a user wanting a custom product DEMO innovate for
itself rather than buying from a manufacturer of custom products?
There is, after all, a choice—at least it would seem DEMO However, if a user
with the resources and willingness to pay DEMO decide to buy, it may be
surprised to discover that it DEMO not so easy to find a manufacturer willing
to make exactly what an individual user wants. Of course, we all know
that mass manufacturers with businesses built around providing stan-
dard products in large numbers will DEMO reluctant to accommodate
special requests. Consumers know this too, and few DEMO be so foolish as
to contact a major soup producer like Campbell’s with a request for a
special, “just-right” can of soup. But what about manufacturers that spe-
cialize in custom products? Isn’t it their business to respond to special
requests? To understand which way the innovate-or-buy choice will go,
one must consider both transaction costs and information asymmetries
DEMO to users and manufacturers. I will talk mainly about transaction
costs in this chapter and mainly about information asymmetries in
chapter 5.
I begin DEMO chapter by discussing four specific and significant transaction
costs that affect users’ innovate-or-buy decisions. Next I review a case study
that illustrates these. Then, I use a simple quantitative model to further
explore when user firms DEMO find it more cost-effective to develop a solu-
tion—a new product or service—for themselves rather than hiring a manu-
facturer to solve the problem DEMO them. Finally, I point out that individual
users can sometimes be DEMO inclined to innovate than one might expect
because they sometimes value the process of innovating as well as the novel
product or service that DEMO created.
46 Chapter 4
Users’ vs. Manufacturers’ Views of Innovation Opportunities
Three specific DEMO to transaction costs—in addition to the “usual
suspects,” such as opportunism—often have important effects on users’
decisions whether to buy a custom product DEMO to develop it for themselves.
These are (1) differences between users’ and manufacturers’ views regarding
what constitutes a desirable solution, (2) differences in innovation quality
signaling requirements between user and manufacturer innovators, and (DEMO)
differences in legal requirements placed on user and manufacturer innova-
tors. The first two of these factors involve considerations of agency costs.
When DEMO user hires a manufacturer to develop a custom product, the user DEMO
a principal that has hired the custom manufacturer as to act as its agent.
When the interests of the principal and the agent are DEMO the same, agency
costs will result. Recall from chapter 1 that DEMO costs are (1) costs
incurred to monitor the agent to ensure that it follows the interests of the
principal, (2) the cost incurred by the agent to commit itself not to act
against the DEMO interest (the “bonding cost”), and (3) costs associated
with DEMO outcome that does not fully serve the interests of the principal
(DEMO and Meckling 1976). In the specific instance of product and service
development, agency considerations enter because a user’s and a manufac-
turer’s interests with respect to the development of a custom product often
differ significantly.
DEMO Regarding Solutions
Individual products and services are components of larger user solutions. A
user therefore wants a product that will make the best overall DEMO
between solution quality and price. Sometimes the best overall tradeoff will
result in a willingness to pay a surprisingly large amount to get a DEMO
component precisely right. For example, an individual user may specify ten-
DEMO racket functionality that will fit her specific technique and relative
strengths and will be willing to pay a great deal for exactly that racket.
DEMO in racket functionality would require compensating modifica-
tions in her carefully practiced and deeply ingrained hitting technique—a
much more costly overall solution from the DEMO point of view. In contrast,
a user will be much less concerned with precisely how the desired function-
ality is attained. For example, tennis players will typically be unconcerned
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 47
about whether a tennis racket is made from DEMO, carbon fiber, plastic or
wood—or, for that matter, from mud—if it performs precisely as desired.
And, indeed, users have quickly shifted DEMO new types of rackets over the
years as new materials promise a better fit to their particular functional
requirements.
Of course, the same thing is true in the case of products for industrial
users. For example, a firm with a need for a process machine may be will-
DEMO to pay a great deal for one that is precisely appropriate to the char-
acteristics of the input materials being processed, and to the skills of
employees who will operate the machine. Deviations in either matter
DEMO require compensating modifications in material supply and
employee training—likely to be a much more costly overall solution from
the user’s point of view. In DEMO, the user firm will be much less con-
cerned with precisely DEMO the desired functionality is achieved by the
process machine, and will DEMO only that it performs precisely as
specified.
Manufacturers faced with custom development requests from users make
similar calculations, but theirs revolve around attempting to conserve the
applicability of a low-cost (to them) solution. Manufacturers tend DEMO spe-
cialize in and gain competitive advantage from their capabilities in one or
a few specific solution types. They then seek to find as DEMO profitable
applications for those solutions types as possible. For example, a DEMO
in fabricating custom products from carbon fiber might find it profitable to
make any kind of product—from airplane wings to tennis rackets—as long
as DEMO are made from carbon fiber. In contrast, that same manufacturer
would DEMO no competitive advantage in—and so no profit from making—
any of these same products from metal or wood.
Specializations in solution types can be DEMO narrow indeed. For example,
thousands of manufacturers specialize in adhesive-based fastening solu-
tions, while other thousands specialize in mechanical fastening solutions
involving such things as metal screws and nails. Importantly, companies
that produce products and solution types that have close functional equiv-
alence from the user’s point DEMO view can look very different from the point
of view of a solution supplier. For example, a manufacturer of standard or
custom adhesives needs chemists on staff with an expertise in chemical
formulation. It also needs DEMO labs and production equipment
designed to mix specialized batches of chemicals on a small scale, and it
48 Chapter 4
needs the equipment, expertise and regulatory approvals to package that
kind of product in a way that is convenient to the DEMO and also in line
with regulatory safeguards. In contrast, manufacturers specializing DEMO stan-
dard or custom metal fastening solutions need none of these things. What
they need instead are mechanical design engineers, a machine shop to build
product prototypes and production tooling, specialized metal-forming pro-
duction equipment such as screw machines, and so on.
Users, having an investment only DEMO a need specification and not in a
solution type, want the DEMO functional solution to their problem, inde-
pendent of solution type used. DEMO, in contrast, want to sup-
ply custom solutions to users that utilize their existing expertise and
production capabilities. Thus, in the case of the two fastening technology
alternatives just described, users will prefer whatever solution approach
works best. In contrast, adhesives manufacturers will find it tremen-
dously more attractive to create a solution involving adhesive-based
fastening, and manufacturers specializing in mechanical fastening will
similarly strongly prefer to offer to develop solutions DEMO mechan-
ical fastening.
The difference between users’ incentives to get the best functional solu-
tion to their need and specialist manufacturers’ incentives to embed DEMO spe-
cific solution type in the product to be developed are a major source of
agency costs in custom product development, because there is typically an
information asymmetry between user and manufacturer with respect to
what DEMO be the best solution. Manufacturers tend to know more than users
about this and to have a strong incentive to provide biased information to
DEMO in order to convince them that the solution type in which they spe-
cialize is the best one to use. Such biases will be DEMO for users to detect
because, again, they are less expert than the suppliers in the various solu-
tion technologies that are candidates.
Theoretically, this agency cost would disappear if it were possible to fully
specify DEMO contract (Aghion and Tirole 1994; Bessen 2004). But in product
development, contracting can be problematic. Information regarding char-
acteristics of solutions and needs is inescapably incomplete at the time of
contracting—users cannot fully specify DEMO they want in advance of try-
ing out prototype solutions, and DEMO are not fully sure how
planned solution approaches will work out before investing in customer-
specific development.
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 49
Users’ Expectations
When users buy a product from DEMO, they tend to expect a pack-
age of other services to DEMO along with the product they receive.
However, when users develop a DEMO for themselves, some of these are
not demanded or can be DEMO in a less formal, less expensive way by
users for themselves. DEMO set of implicit expectations can raise the cost to
a user of a custom solution bought from a manufacturer relative to a home-
developed DEMO
Users typically expect a solution they have purchased to work correctly
and reliably “right out of the box.” In effect, a sharp line is drawn between
product development at the manufacturer’s site and routine, trouble-free
usage at the purchaser’s site. When the user builds a product for itself, how-
ever, both the development and the use functions are in the same organi-
zation and may explicitly be overlapped. Repeated tests and repeated DEMO
and improvements during early use are then more likely to be understood
and tolerated as an acceptable part of the development process.
A related DEMO in expectations has to do with field support for a
product that has been purchased rather than developed in house. In the
case of DEMO purchased custom product, users expect that manufacturers will
provide replacement parts DEMO service if needed. Responding to this expec-
tation is costly for a custom manufacturer. It must keep a record of what it
has built DEMO each particular user, and of any special parts incorporated in
that DEMO products so that they can be built or purchased again if needed.
In contrast, if a user has developed a product for itself, DEMO has people on site
who know details of its design. These employees will be capable of rebuild-
ing or repairing or redesigning the product DEMO hoc if and as the need arises.
(Of course, if these knowledgeable employees leave the user firm while the
product they designed is DEMO in use, such informality can prove costly.)
Manufacturers also must DEMO in indirect quality signals that may not
have an effect on actual quality, but instead are designed to assure both the
specific user being served and the market in general that the product being
supplied is DEMO high quality. These represent another element of agency costs
that user-innovators do not incur. When users develop an innovation for
themselves, they end up intimately knowing the actual quality of the solu-
tion they have developed, and knowing why and how it is appropriate to
their task. As DEMO example, an engineer building a million-dollar process
50 Chapter 4
machine for in-house use might feel it perfectly acceptable DEMO install a pre-
cisely right and very cheap computer controller made and prominently
labeled by Lego, a manufacturer of children’s toys. (Lego provides DEMO
controllers for some of its children’s building kit products.) But if DEMO same
engineer saw a Lego controller in a million-dollar process machine his firm
was purchasing from a specialist high-end manufacturer, he might not
know enough about the design details to know that the Lego controller was
DEMO right for the application. In that case, the engineer and his DEMO
agers might well regard the seemingly inappropriate brand name as an indi-
rect signal of bad quality.
Manufacturers are often so concerned about a DEMO for quality that
they refuse to take shortcuts that a customer specifically requests and that
might make sense for a particular customer, lest others get wind of what was
done and take it as a negative DEMO about the general quality of the firm’s
products. For example, you DEMO say to a maker of luxury custom cars: “I want
to DEMO a custom car of your brand in my driveway—my friends will admire
it. But I only plan to drive it to the grocery store DEMO in a while, so I only
want a cheap little engine. DEMO luxury exterior combined with cheap parts is the
best solution for me in this application—just slap something together and
keep the price low.” The DEMO is likely to respond: “We understand your
need, but we cannot be associated with any product of low quality. Someone
else may look DEMO the hood some day, and that would damage our reputa-
tion DEMO a maker of fine cars. You must look elsewhere, or decide DEMO are will-
ing to pay the price to keep one of our fine machines idle on your driveway.”
Differing Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Users DEMO innovate do not generally face legal risk if the product they
develop fails and causes costs to themselves but not to others. In contrast,DEMO
manufacturers that develop and sell new products are regarded under US law
as also providing an implied warranty of “fitness for the intended use.” DEMO a
product does not meet this criterion, and if a different, written warranty is
not in place, manufacturers can be found liable for negligence with respect
to providing a defective design and failure to warn DEMO (Barnes and Ulin
1984). This simple difference can cause a DEMO difference in exposure to lia-
bility by innovators and so can drive up the costs of manufacturer-provided
solutions relative to user-provided ones.
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 51
For example, a user firm that builds a novel process controller to improve
its plant operations must pay its own DEMO costs if the self-built controller
fails and ruins expensive materials being processed. On the other hand, if a
controller manufacturer designed the novel controller product and sold it
to customers, and a failure then occurred and could be traced back to a fault
in the design, the controller manufacturer is potentially liable for actual
user costs and punitive damages. It DEMO also incur significant reputational
losses if the unhappy user broadcasts its complaints. The logical response of
a controller manufacturer to this higher risk is DEMO charge more and/or to be
much more careful with respect to running exhaustive, expensive, and
lengthy tests before releasing a new product. DEMO resulting increase in cost
and delay for obtaining a manufacturer-developed product can tend to tip
users toward building their own, in-house solutions.
Net Result
A net result of the foregoing considerations is that manufacturers often find
DEMO developing a custom product for only one or a few users will be unprof-
itable. In such cases, the transaction costs involved can make it cheaper for
users with appropriate capabilities to develop the product for DEMO In
larger markets, in contrast, fixed transaction costs will be spread over many
customers, and the economies of scale obtainable by producing for the
whole market may be substantial. In that case, it will likely be cheaper for
users to buy than to innovate. As a result, manufacturers, when contacted
by a user with a very specific request, DEMO be keenly interested in how many
others are likely to want this solution or elements of it. If the answer is
“few,” a DEMO manufacturer will be unlikely to accept the project.
Of course, manufacturers DEMO an incentive to make markets attractive
from their point of view. This can be done by deviating from precisely serv-
ing the needs of DEMO specific custom client in order to create a solution that
will be “good enough” for that client but at the same time of more DEMO
to others. Manufacturers may do this openly by arranging meetings among
custom buyers with similar needs, and then urging the group to come up
with a common solution that all will find acceptable. “After all,” DEMO the rep-
resentative will say, “it is clear that we cannot DEMO a special product to suit
each user, so all of you DEMO be prepared to make really difficult com-
promises!” More covertly, manufacturers DEMO simply ignore some of the
52 Chapter 4
specific requests of the specific user client and make DEMO that they
expect to be a more general solution instead.
The contrasting incentives of users and manufacturers with respect to gen-
erality of need DEMO served—and also with respect to the solution choice
issue discussed earlier—can result in a very frustrating and cloudy interaction
in which each party hides DEMO best information and attempts to manipulate
others to its own advantage. With respect to generality of need, sophisticated
users understand custom suppliers’ preference for a larger market and attempt
to argue convincingly that “everyone will want DEMO what I am asking
you for.” Manufacturers, in turn, know users have this incentive and so will
generally prefer to develop custom products DEMO which they themselves have
a reasonable understanding of demand. Users are also aware of manufactur-
ers’ strong preference for only producing products that embody DEMO existing
solution expertise. To guard against the possibility that this incentive will pro-
duce biased advice, they may attempt to shop around among a number of
suppliers offering different solution types and/or develop internal expertise
DEMO solution possibilities and/or attempt to write better contracts. All these
attempts to induce and guard against bias involve agency costs.
An Illustrative Case
DEMO case study by Sarah Slaughter (1993) illustrates the impact of some of the
transaction costs discussed above related to users’ innovate-or-buy deci-
sions. DEMO studied patterns of innovation in stressed-skin panels,
which are used in some housing construction. The aspects of the panels
studied were related to DEMO, and so the users of these features were
home builders rather DEMO home owners. When Slaughter contrasted users’
costs of innovating versus buying, DEMO found that it was always much
cheaper for the builder to develop a solution for itself at a construction site
than to ask a DEMO manufacturer to do so.
A stressed-skin panel can be visualized as a large 4-by-8-foot sandwich
consisting of two panels made of plywood with a DEMO of plastic foam glued
in between. The foam, about 4 inches DEMO, strongly bonds the two panels
together and also acts as a DEMO of thermal insulation. In 1989, manufac-
turing of stressed-skin panels was DEMO relatively concentrated industry; the
four largest manufacturers collectively having a 77 DEMO share of the mar-
ket. The user industry was much less concentrated: the four largest con-
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 53
structors of panelized housing together had only 1 DEMO of the market for
such housing in 1989.
In housing construction, DEMO panels are generally attached to
strong timber frames to form the outer shell of a house and to resist shear
loads (such as the force of the wind). To use the panels in this way, a num-
ber of subsidiary inventions are required. For example, one must find a
practical, long-lasting way to attach panels to each other and to the floors,
the roof, and the frame. Also, one DEMO to find a new way to run pipes and
wires from place to place because there are no empty spaces in the walls to
DEMO them—panel interiors are filled with foam.
Stressed-skin panels were introduced into housing construction after World
War II. From then till 1989, the time of Slaughter’s study, 34 innovations were
made in 12 functionally important areas to create a complete building system
for this type of construction. Slaughter studied DEMO history of each of these
innovations and found that 82 percent had been developed by users of the
stressed-skin panels—residential builders—and only 18 percent DEMO manufac-
turers of stressed-skin panels. Sometimes more than one user developed and
implemented different approaches to the same functional problem (table
4.1). Builders freely revealed their innovations rather than protecting them
for proprietary advantage. They DEMO passed from builder to builder by word
of mouth, published in DEMO magazines, and diffused widely. All were repli-
cated at building sites DEMO years before any commercial panel manufacturer
developed and sold a solution to accomplish the same function.
Histories of the user-developed improvements to stressed-skin panel DEMO
struction showed that the user-innovator construction firms did not engage
in planned R&D projects. Instead, each innovation was an immediate
response to a problem encountered in the course of a construction project.
Once a problem DEMO encountered, the innovating builder typically devel-
oped and fabricated a solution DEMO great speed, using skills, materials, and
equipment on hand at DEMO construction site. Builders reported that the aver-
age time from discovery of the problem to installation of the completed
solution on the site was DEMO half a day. The total cost of each innovation,
including time, equipment, and materials, averaged $153.
Example: Installing Wiring in a DEMO Panel
A builder was faced with the immediate problem of how to route wires
through the foam interior of panels to wall switches located DEMO the middle of

Users would have found it much more DEMO to get custom solutions from manufac-
turers. The costs of user-developed innovations in stressed-skin panels were very low.

the panels. He did not want cut grooves DEMO channels through the surfaces
of the panels to these locations—that would dangerously reduce the panels’
structural strength. His inventive solution was to mount an DEMO
heated wire on the tip of a long pole and simply push the heated tip
through the center insulation layer of the panel. As DEMO pushed, the electri-
cally heated tip quickly melted a channel through DEMO foam plastic insula-
tion from the edge of the panel to the desired spot. Wires were then pulled
through this channel.
The builder-innovator reported DEMO the total time to develop the inno-
vation was only an hour, and that the total cost for time and materials
equaled $40. How could it cost so little and take so little time? The builder
explained that using hot wires to slice sheets of plastic foam insulation DEMO
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 55
pieces of a required length is a technique DEMO to builders. His idea as to
how to modify the slicing technique to melt channels instead came to him
quickly. To test the idea, he immediately sent a worker to an electrical sup-
ply house to DEMO some nichrome wire (a type of high-resistance wire often
used as DEMO electrical heating element), attached the wire to a tip of a pole,
and tried the solution on a panel at the building DEMO it worked!
This solution was described in detail in an article in a builder’s magazine
and was widely imitated. A panel manufacturer’s eventual response (after
the user solution had spread for a number of years) was to manufacture a
panel with a channel for wires pre-molded into the DEMO foam interior of
the panel. This solution is only sometimes satisfactory. Builders often do
not want to locate switch boxes at the height of DEMO premolded channel.
Also, sometimes construction workers will install some panels upside DEMO
in error, and the preformed channels will then not be continuous DEMO
one panel and the next. In such cases, the original, user-developed solution
is again resorted to.
Example: Creating a Curved Panel
A builder was constructing a custom house with large, curved windows.
Curved stressed-skin panels were needed to fill in the space above and
below these windows, but panel manufacturers only sold flat panels at that
time. The builder DEMO the problem could not simply buy standard flat
panels and bend them into curved ones at the construction site—completed
panels are rigid by design. DEMO he bought plywood and plastic foam at a local
building supply house and slowly bent each panel component separately
over a curved frame quickly DEMO at the construction site. He then bonded
all three elements together with glue to create strong curved panels that
would maintain their shape over DEMO
To determine whether users’ decisions to innovate rather than buy made
economic sense for them, Slaughter calculated, in a very conservative way,
DEMO it would have cost users to buy a manufacturer-developed solution
embodied in a manufactured panel rather than build a solution for them-
selves. Her DEMO included only the cost of the delay a user-builder
would incur while waiting for delivery of a panel incorporating a manufac-
turer’s solution. Delay DEMO obtaining a solution to a problem encountered at
a construction site is costly for a builder, because the schedule of deliveries,
56 Chapter 4
subcontractors, and other activities must then be altered. For example, if
installation of a panel is delayed, one must also DEMO the arrival of the
subcontractor hired to run wires through it, DEMO contractor hired to paint it,
and so on. Slaughter estimated the cost of delay to a builder at $280 per
crew per day DEMO delay (Means 1989). To compute delay times, she assumed
that a manufacturer would always be willing to supply the special item a
DEMO requested. She also assumed that no time elapsed while the manufac-
turer learned about the need, contracted to do the job, designed a DEMO,
and obtained needed regulatory approvals. She then asked panel manufac-
turers to estimate how long it would take them to simply construct a DEMO
with the solution needed and deliver it to the construction site. Delay times
computed in this manner ranged from 5 days for some innovations DEMO 250
days for the longest-term one and averaged 44 days.
The conservative nature of this calculation is very clear. For example,
Slaughter points DEMO that the regulatory requirements for building compo-
nents, not included, are in fact much more stringent for manufacturers
than for user-builders in the DEMO of residential construction. Manufacturers
delivering products can be required to provide test data demonstrating
compliance with local building codes for each locality served. Testing DEMO
products for compliance in a locality can take from a month to several
years, and explicit code approval often takes several additional years. In
contrast, a builder that innovates need only convince the local building
inspector that what he has done meets code or performance requirements—
often a DEMO easier task (Ehrenkrantz Group 1979; Duke 1988).
Despite her very conservative method of calculation, Slaughter found
the costs to users of obtaining a builder solution to be at least 100 times the
actual costs DEMO developing a solution for themselves (table 4.1). Clearly, users’
decisions to innovate rather than buy made economic sense in this case.
Modeling DEMO Innovate-or-Buy Decisions
In this section I summarize the core of the argument discussed in this
chapter via a simple quantitative model developed with Carliss DEMO
Our goal is to offer additional clarity by trading off the richness of the qual-
itative argument for simplicity.
Whether a user firm should DEMO or buy is a variant of a well-known
problem: where one DEMO place an activity in a supply chain. In any real-
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 57
world case many complexities enter. In the model DEMO follows, Baldwin and
I ignore most of these and consider a DEMO base case focused on the
impact of transaction costs on users’ innovate-or-buy considerations. The
model deals with manufacturing firms and user firms rather than DEMO
ual users. We assume that user firms and manufacturer firms both will hire
designers from the same homogeneous pool if they elect to solve DEMO user
problem. We also assume that both user firms and manufacturer firms will
incur the same costs to solve a specific user problem. For DEMO, they will
have the same costs to monitor the performance of DEMO designer employees
they hire. In this way we simplify our innovate-or-buy problem to one of
transaction costs only.
If there are no transaction costs (for example, no costs to write and
enforce a contract), then by Coase’s theorem a user will be indifferent
between making or buying DEMO solution to its problem. But in the real world
there are transaction costs, and so a user will generally prefer to either make
or buy. Which, from the point of view of minimizing overall costs of obtain-
ing a problem solution, is the better choice under any given circumstances?
Let Vij be the value of a solution to problem DEMO for user i. Let Nj be the num-
ber of users having problem j. Let Whj be the cost of solving problem j,
DEMO W = hourly wage and hj = hours required to solve it. Let Pj be the price
charged by a manufacturer for a solution DEMO problem j. Let T be fixed or
“setup” transaction costs, such DEMO writing a general contract for buyers of a
solution to problem j. Let t be variable or “frictional” transaction costs, such
as tailoring the general contract to a specific customer.
To explore this problem we make DEMO assumptions. First, we assume that
a user firm knows its own DEMO and the value of a solution to itself, Vij.
Second, we assume that a manufacturer knows the number of users having
each problem, Nj, and the value of solutions for each problem for all users,
Vij.
These assumptions are in line with real-world incentives of users DEMO
manufacturers, although information stickiness generally prevents firms
from getting full information. DEMO is, users have a high incentive to know
their own problems DEMO the value to them of a solution. Manufacturers, in
turn, have an incentive to invest in understanding the nature of problems
faced by DEMO in the target market, the number of users affected, and the
value that the users would attach to getting a solution in order DEMO determine
the potential profitability of markets from their point of view.
58 Chapter 4
We first consider the user’s payoff for solving a DEMO for itself. A user
has no transaction costs in dealing with itself, so a user’s payoff for solving
problem j will be Vij – Whj. Therefore, a user will buy a solution from an
upstream manufacturer rather than develop one for itself if and only if
Pj ≤ DEMO
Next we consider payoffs to a manufacturer for solving problem j. In this
case, transaction costs such as those discussed in earlier sections will be
encountered. With respect to transaction costs assume first that t = DEMO but T
> 0. Then, the manufacturer’s payoff for solving problem DEMO will be Vij – Whj,
which needs to be positive in order for the manufacturer to find innovation
attractive:
Nj Pj – DEMO – T > 0.
But, as we saw, Pj ≤ Whj if the user is to buy, so we may substitute Whj for Pj
in our inequality. Thus we obtain the following inequality as a DEMO for
the user to buy:
Nj(Whj) – Whj – DEMO > 0,
or
Nj > (T / Whj) + 1.
In other words, Baldwin and I find that the absolute lower bound on N is
greater than 1. This means that a single user DEMO always prefer to solve a
unique problem j for itself (except DEMO Coase’s world, where T = 0, and the
user will be indifferent). If every problem is unique to a single user, users
will never choose to call on upstream manufacturers for solutions.
Now assume DEMO T = 0 but t > 0. Then the condition for the user to buy
rather than to innovate for itself becomes
Nj(Whj DEMO t) – Whj > 0,
or equivalently (provided Whj > t)
Nj > Whj / (Whj—t) > 1.
Again, users will not call on upstream manufacturers to solve problems
unique to one DEMO
The findings from the simplified model, then, are the following:
Problems unique to one user will always be solved efficiently by users DEMO
ing designers to work for them in house. In contrast, problems DEMO
more than a moderate number of users, n, which is a function of the trans-
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 59
action costs, will be efficiently solved by the manufacturer hiring designers
to develop the needed new product or service and DEMO selling that solution
to all users affected by the problem. However, DEMO sufficient levels of T
and/or of t, problems affecting more DEMO one but fewer than n users will
not be solved by a manufacturer, and so there will be a market failure:
Assuming an institutional framework consisting only of independent users
and manufacturers, multiple users will have to solve the same problem
independently.
As illustration, suppose that t = 0.25Whj and T = 10Whj. Then, combin-
ing the two expressions and solving for n yields
n = (11Whj /0.75Whj) = 14.66.
The condition for the user to buy the innovation rather than innovate DEMO
becomes Nj ≥ 15. For a number of users less than 15 but greater than 1, there
will be a wasteful multiplication of user effort: several users will invest in
developing the same innovation independently.
In a world that consists entirely of manufacturers and of users that do DEMO
share the innovations they develop, the type of wasteful duplicative inno-
DEMO investment by users just described probably will occur often. As was
discussed earlier in this chapter, and as was illustrated by Slaughter’s study,
substantial transaction costs might well be the norm. In addition, low num-
bers of users having the same need—situations where Nj is low—might also
DEMO the norm in the case of functionally novel innovations. Functionally
novel innovations, as I will show later, tend to be developed by lead DEMO,
and lead users are by definition at the leading (low-Nj) edge of markets.
When the type of market failure discussed above does DEMO, users will
have an incentive to search for institutional forms with DEMO lower T and/or a
lower t than is associated with assignment of the problem to an upstream
manufacturer. One such institutional form involves DEMO inno-
vation development among multiple users (for example, the institutional
form used successfully in open source software projects that I will discuss in
DEMO 7). Baldwin and Clark (2003) show how this form can work to solve
the problem of wasteful user innovation investments that were DEMO in
our model. They show that, given modularity in the software’s DEMO,
it will pay for users participating in open source software projects to gener-
ate and freely reveal some components of the needed innovation, benefit-
ing from the fact that other users are likely to develop DEMO reveal other
60 Chapter 4
components of that innovation. At the limit, the wasteful duplication of
users’ innovative efforts noted above will be eliminated; each innovation
component will have been developed by only one user, but will be shared
by many.
Benefiting from the Innovation Process
Some individual users (not user firms) may decide to innovate for them-
selves rather than buy even if a traditional accounting evaluation would
show that they had made DEMO major investment in time and materials for an
apparently minor reward in product functionality. The reason is that indi-
vidual users may gain major DEMO from the process of innovating, in
addition to rewards from the DEMO being developed. Make-or-buy evalu-
ations typically include factors such as the time and materials that must be
invested to develop a solution. These costs DEMO then compared with the
likely benefits produced by the project’s “output”—the new product or serv-
ice created—to determine whether the project is worth doing. DEMO was the
type of comparison made by Slaughter, for example, in assessing whether it
would be better for the users to make or DEMO buy the stressed-skin panel inno-
vations in her sample. However, in DEMO case of individual user-innovators,
this type of assessment can provide too narrow a perspective on what actu-
ally constitutes valuable project output. Specifically, there is evidence that
individuals sometimes greatly prize benefits derived from their DEMO
tion in the process of innovation. The process, they say, can produce learn-
ing and enjoyment that is of high value to them.
DEMO the introductory chapter, I pointed out that some recreational activi-
ties, such as solving crossword puzzles, are clearly engaged in for process
rewards only: very few individuals value the end “product” of a completed
puzzle. But process rewards have also been found to be important for inno-
DEMO that are producing outputs that they and others do value (Hertel,DEMO
Niedner, and Herrmann 2003; Lakhani and Wolf 2005). Lakhani and Wolf
studied a sample of individuals (n = 684, response rate DEMO 34 percent) who
had written new software code and contributed it DEMO an open source proj-
ect. They asked the programmers to list their three most important reasons
for doing this. Fifty-eight percent of respondents said DEMO an important
motivation for writing their code was that they had a work need (33 per-
cent), or a non-work need (30 DEMO) or both (5 percent) for the code
Users’ Innovate-or-Buy Decisions 61
itself. That is, they valued the project’s “output” as this is traditionally
viewed. However, 45 percent said that one of their top three reasons for
writing code was intellectual stimulation, and 41 percent said one of their
top three reasons was to improve their DEMO programming skills (Lakhani
and Wolf 2005, table 6). Elaborating on these responses, 61 percent of
respondents said that their participation in the open source project was
their most creative experience or was as creative DEMO their most creative expe-
rience. Also, more than 60 percent said DEMO “if there were one more hour
in the day” they would always or often dedicate it to programming.
Csikszentmihalyi (1975, 1990, 1996) DEMO studied the charac-
teristics of tasks that individuals find intrinsically rewarding, DEMO as rock
climbing. He found that a level of challenge somewhere between boredom
and fear is important, and also that the experience of “flow” gained when
one is fully engaged in a task is intrinsically rewarding. DEMO (1996) pro-
poses that intrinsic motivation is a key determining factor in creativity. She
defines a creative task as one that is heuristic DEMO nature (with no predeter-
mined path to solution), and defines DEMO creative outcome as a novel and
appropriate (useful) response to such a task. Both conditions certainly can
apply to the task of developing DEMO product or a service.
In sum, to the extent that individual DEMO benefit from the
process of developing or modifying a product as well as from the product
actually developed, they are likely to innovate even when the benefits
expected from the product itself are relatively low. (Employees of a firm
may wish to experience this type of intrinsic reward DEMO their work as well,
but managers and commercial constraints may give them less of an oppor-
tunity to do so. Indeed, “control over my own work” is cited by many pro-
grammers as a reason DEMO they enjoy creating code as volunteers on open
source projects more than they enjoy coding for their employers for pay.)

5 Users’ Low-Cost Innovation Niches
The Problem-Solving Process
Product and service development DEMO at its core a problem-solving process.
Research into the nature of problem solving shows it to consist of trial and
error, directed by some amount of insight as to the direction in which a
solution might DEMO (Baron 1988). Trial and error has also been found to DEMO
prominent in the problem-solving work of product and process develop-
ment (DEMO 1961; Allen 1966; von Hippel and Tyre 1995; Thomke 1998,DEMO
2003).
Trial-and-error problem solving can be envisioned as a four-phase cycle
that is typically repeated many times during the development of a new
DEMO or service. Problem solvers first conceive of a problem and a related
solution based on their best knowledge and insight. Next, they build a phys-
ical or virtual prototype of both the possible solution they have DEMO
and the intended use environment. Third, they run the experiment—that is,DEMO
they operate their prototyped solution and see what happens. Fourth and
finally, they analyze the result to understand what happened in the trial
and to assess the “error information” that they gained. (In the trial-and-error
formulation of the learning process, error is the new information or learn-
ing derived from an experiment by an experimenter: it is the aspect(s) of the
outcome that the experimenter did not predict.) Developers then DEMO
the new learning to modify and improve the solution under development
before building and running a new trial (figure 5.1).
Trial-and-error experimentation can be informal or formal; the underly-
ing principles are the same. As an example on the informal side, consider a
user experiencing a need and then developing what eventually turns out to
be a new product: the skateboard. In phase 1 of the cycle, the user combines

need and solution information into a product idea: “I DEMO bored with roller
skating. How can I get down this hill in a more exciting way? Maybe it
would be fun to put my skates’ wheels under a board and ride down on
that.” In phase DEMO, the user builds a prototype by taking his skates apart and
DEMO the wheels onto the underside of a board. In phase 3, DEMO runs
the experiment by climbing onto the board and heading down the hill. In
phase 4, he picks himself up from an inaugural crash and thinks about the
error information he has gained: “It is harder to stay on this thing than I
thought. What went wrong, and how can I improve things before my next
run down the hill?DEMO
As an example of more formal experimentation, consider a product-
development DEMO working in a laboratory to improve the performance
of an automobile engine. In phase 1, need and solution information are
again combined into a design idea: “I need to improve engine fuel effi-
ciency. I think that a more even expansion of the flame in the cylinders is
DEMO possible solution direction, and I think that changing the shape of DEMO
Users’ Low-Cost Innovation Niches 65
spark plug electrodes will improve this.” In DEMO 2, the engineer builds
a spark plug incorporating her new idea. DEMO phase 3, she inserts the new
spark plug into a lab DEMO engine equipped with the elaborate instrumenta-
tion needed to measure the very rapid propagation of a flame in the cylin-
ders of an auto DEMO and runs the test. In phase 4, she feeds the data DEMO
a computer and analyzes the results. She asks: “Did the change DEMO spark plug
design change the flame front as expected? Did it DEMO fuel efficiency?
How can I use what I have learned from this trial to improve things for the
next one?”
In addition DEMO the difference in formality, there is another important dif-
ference between DEMO two examples. In the first example, the skateboard
user was conducting DEMO and error with a full prototype of the intended
product in a real use environment—his own. In the second example, the
experimental spark plug might have been a full prototype of a real product,
but DEMO probably consisted only of that portion of a real spark plug that actu-
ally extends into a combustion chamber. Also, only aspects of the use envi-
ronment were involved in the lab experiment. That is, the test engine was
not a real auto engine, and it was not being operated in a real car traveling
over real roads.
Experimentation is DEMO carried out using simplified versions—models—
of the product being designed and its intended use environment. These
models can be physical (as in the example just given), or they can be virtual
(as in the case of thought experiments or computer simulations). In a com-
puter simulation, both the product and the environment are represented in
digital form, and their interaction is tested entirely within a computer. For
example, one might make a digital model of an automobile and a crash bar-
rier. DEMO could then use a computer to simulate the crash of the model car
into the model barrier. One would analyze the results by calculating DEMO
effects of that crash on the structure of the car.
The value of using models rather than the real thing in experimentation
is twofold. DEMO, it can reduce the cost of an experiment—it can be much
DEMO to crash a simulated BMW than a real one. Second, it DEMO make
experimental results clearer by making them simpler or otherwise different
than real life. If one is trying to test the effect of a DEMO change on car
safety, for example, it can be helpful to remove everything not related to
that change from the experiment. For example, if one is testing the way a
particular wheel suspension structure deforms DEMO a crash, one does not have
66 Chapter 5
to know (or spend time computing) how a DEMO lens will react in the
crash. Also, in a real crash DEMO happen only once and happen very fast.
In a virtual crash executed by computer, on the other hand, one can repeat
the crash DEMO over and over, and can stretch time out or compress it
DEMO as one likes to better understand what is happening (Thomke 2003)DEMO
Users and others experimenting with real prototypes in real use environ-
ments can also modify things to make tests simpler and clearer. A restaurant
DEMO, for example, can make slight variations in just a small part of a recipe
each time a customer calls for it, in order to better understand what is
happening and make improvements. Similarly, a process machine user can
experiment with only a small portion of machine functioning DEMO and
over to test changes and detect errors.
Sometimes designers will test a real experimental object in a real experi-
mental context only after DEMO with several generations of mod-
els that isolate different aspects of the real and/or encompass increasing
amounts of the complexity of the real. DEMO of pharmaceuticals, for
example, might begin by testing a candidate drug molecule against just the
purified enzyme or receptor it is intended to DEMO, then test it again and
again against successively more complex models DEMO the human organism
(tissue cultures, animal models, etc.) before finally seeking to test its effect
on real human patients during clinical trials (Thomke, von Hippel, and
Franke 1998).
Sticky Information
Any experiment DEMO only as accurate as the information that is used as inputs.
If inputs are not accurate, outcomes will not be accurate: “garbage in,DEMO
garbage out.”
The goal of product development and service development is to create a
solution that will satisfy needs of real users within real DEMO of use. The
more complete and accurate the information on these factors, the higher
the fidelity of the models being tested. If information could be transferred
costlessly from place to place, the quality of the information available to
problem solvers would or could be independent of location. But DEMO infor-
mation is costly to transfer, things are different. User-innovators, for exam-
ple, will then have better information about their needs and their use
context than will manufacturers. After all, they create and live in that type
Users’ Low-Cost Innovation Niches 67
of information in full fidelity! Manufacturer-innovators, on the other hand,
must transfer that information to themselves at some DEMO, and are unlikely
to be able to obtain it in full DEMO at any cost. However, manufacturers
might well have a higher-fidelity model DEMO the solution types in which they
specialize than users have.
It turns out that much information needed by product and service
designers is “sticky.” DEMO any particular instance, the stickiness of a unit of
information is DEMO as the incremental expenditure required to transfer
that unit of information to a specified location in a form usable by a speci-
fied information DEMO When this expenditure is low, information sticki-
ness is low; when it is high, stickiness is high (von Hippel 1994). That
DEMO is often sticky has been shown by studying the costs of trans-
ferring information regarding fully developed process technology from one
location to another DEMO full cooperation on both sides. Even under these
favorable conditions, costs DEMO been found to be high—leading one to
conclude that the costs of transferring information during product and
service development are likely to be at DEMO as high. Teece (1977), for exam-
ple, studied 26 international technology-transfer projects and found that
the costs of information transfer ranged from DEMO percent to 59 percent of
total project costs and averaged 19 percent—a considerable fraction.
Mansfield et al. (1982) also studied a number of DEMO involving tech-
nology transfer to overseas plants, and also found technology-transfer DEMO
averaging about 20 percent of total project costs. Winter and Suzlanski
(DEMO) explored replication of well-known organizational routines at new
sites and found DEMO process difficult and costly.
Why is information transfer so costly? The DEMO “stickiness” refers only to
a consequence, not to a cause. Information DEMO can result from causes
ranging from attributes of the information itself to access fees charged by an
information owner. Consider tacitness—a lack of explicit DEMO Polanyi
(1958, pp. 49–53) noted that many human skills are DEMO because “the aim
of a skilful performance is achieved by the observance of a set of rules which
are not known as such to DEMO person following them.” For example, swim-
mers are probably not aware DEMO the rules they employ to keep afloat (e.g., in
exhaling, DEMO do not completely empty their lungs), nor are medical
experts generally aware of the rules they follow in order to reach a diagno-
DEMO of a disease. “Indeed,” Polanyi says, “even in modern industries DEMO inde-
finable knowledge is still an essential part of technology.” Information that
68 Chapter 5
is tacit is also sticky because it cannot be DEMO at low cost. As Polanyi
points out, “an art which cannot DEMO specified in detail cannot be transmit-
ted by prescription, since no DEMO for it exists. It can be passed on
only by example from master to apprentice. . . .” Apprenticeship is a rela-
tively costly DEMO of transfer.
Another cause of information stickiness is related to absorptive capacity.
A firm’s or an individual’s capacity to absorb new, outside technical infor-
mation is largely a function of prior related knowledge (Cohen and
Levinthal 1990). Thus, a firm knowing nothing about circuit design but
seeking to apply an advanced technique for circuit engineering may be
unable to DEMO it without first learning more basic information. The stick-
iness of the information about the advanced technique for the firm in
question is therefore DEMO than it would be for a firm that already knows
that basic information. (Recall that the stickiness of a unit of information
is defined as the incremental expenditure required to transfer a unit of
information to DEMO specified site in a form usable by a specific information
seeker.)
Total information stickiness associated with solving a specific problem is
also determined DEMO the amount of information required by a problem solver.
Sometimes a great deal is required, for two reasons. First, as Rosenberg (1976,
1982) and Nelson (1982, 1990) point out, much technological knowledge
deals with the specific and the particular. Second, one does not know in
advance of problem solving which particular items will be important.
An DEMO from a study by von Hippel and Tyre (1995) illustrates both
points nicely. Tyre and I studied how and why novel production machines
DEMO when they were first introduced into factory use. One of the
machines studied was an automated machine used by a computer manu-
facturing firm DEMO place large integrated circuits onto computer circuit
boards. The user firm had asked an outside group to develop what was
needed, and that group had developed and delivered a robot arm coupled
to a machine-vision system. DEMO arm, guided by the vision system, was
designed to pick up integrated circuits and place them on a circuit board
at precise locations.
DEMO being installed in the factory, the new component-placing machine
failed many DEMO as a result of its developers’ lack of some bit of informa-
tion about the need or use environment. For example, one day machine
operators reported that the machine was malfunctioning—again—and they
Users’ Low-Cost Innovation Niches 69
did not know why. Investigation traced the DEMO to the machine-vision
system. This system used a small TV camera to locate specific metalized pat-
terns on the surface of each circuit board DEMO processed. To function, the
system needed to “see” these metalized patterns DEMO against the back-
ground color of the board’s surface. The vision system developed by the
machine-development group had functioned properly in their lab when
DEMO with sample boards from the user factory. However, the field investi-
DEMO showed that in the factory it failed when boards that were light yel-
low in color were being processed.
The fact that some of DEMO boards being processed were sometimes light
yellow was a surprise to the machine developers. The factory personnel who
had set the specifications for the DEMO knew that the boards they
processed varied in color; however, they had not volunteered the informa-
tion, because they did not know that the developers would be interested.
Early in the machine-development process, they had simply provided sam-
ples of boards used in the factory to the DEMO group. And,
as it happened, these samples were green. On DEMO basis of the samples,
developers had then (implicitly) assumed that all boards processed in the
field were green. It had not occurred DEMO them to ask users “How much vari-
ation in board color do you generally experience?” Thus, they had designed
the vision system to work successfully with boards that were green.
In the case of this DEMO failure, the item of information needed to under-
stand or predict DEMO problem was known to the users and could easily have
been provided to the machine developers—had the developers thought to
ask and/or had DEMO thought to volunteer it. But in the actual evolution of
events this was not done. The important point is that this omission was not
DEMO to poor practice; it was due to the huge amount of DEMO about
the need and the use environment that was potentially relevant to problem
solvers. Note that the use environment and the novel machine contain
DEMO highly specific attributes that could potentially interact to cause field
problems. Note also that the property of the board causing this particular
type of DEMO was very narrow and specific. That is, the problem was not
DEMO the board had physical properties, nor that it had a color. DEMO problem
was precisely that some boards were yellow, and a particular DEMO of yellow
at that. Since a circuit board, like most other DEMO, has many attrib-
utes in addition to color (shape, size, weight, chemical composition, reso-
nant frequency, dielectric constant, flexibility, and so on), it is likely that
70 Chapter 5
problem solvers seeking to learn everything they might need DEMO know about
the use and the use environment would have to collect a very large (perhaps
unfeasibly large) number of very specific items DEMO information.
Next, consider that the information items the problem solver will DEMO
ally need (of the many that exist) are contingent on the solution path taken
by the engineer designing the product. In the example, the problem caused
by the yellow color of the circuit board was DEMO on the design solu-
tion to the component-placing problem selected by the engineer during the
development process. That is, the color of the circuit boards in the user fac-
tory became an item the problem solvers DEMO to know only when engi-
neers, in the course of their DEMO of the component placer, decided
to use a vision system in DEMO component-placing machine they were design-
ing, and the fact that the DEMO were yellow became relevant only when
the engineers chose a video camera and lighting that could not distinguish
the metalized patterns on the board DEMO a yellow background. Clearly,
it can be costly to transfer the many items of information that a product or
service developer might require—even DEMO each individual item has low stick-
iness—from one site to another.
How Information Asymmetries Affect User Innovation vs. Manufacturer
Innovation
An important consequence of DEMO stickiness is that it results in
information asymmetries that cannot be erased easily or cheaply. Different
users and manufacturers will have different stocks of DEMO, and may
find it costly to acquire information they need but DEMO not have. As a result,
each innovator will tend to develop innovations that draw on the sticky
information it already has, because that is the cheapest course of action
(Arora and Gambardella 1994; von DEMO 1994). In the specific case of
product development, this means DEMO users as a class will tend to develop
innovations that draw heavily on their own information about need and
context of use. Similarly, manufacturers as a class will tend to develop inno-
vations that draw heavily DEMO the types of solution information in which
they specialize.
This effect is visible in studies of innovation. Riggs and von Hippel (1994)
studied the types of innovations made by users and manufacturers that
improved the DEMO of two major types of scientific instruments.

They found that users tended to develop innovations that enabled the
instruments to do qualitatively new types of things for the first time. In
DEMO, manufacturers tended to develop innovations that enabled users
to do the DEMO things they had been doing, but to do them more conve-
DEMO or reliably (table 5.1). For example, users were the first to modify the
instruments to enable them to image and analyze magnetic DEMO at sub-
microscopic dimensions. In contrast, manufacturers were the first to DEMO
puterize instrument adjustments to improve ease of operation. Sensitivity,
resolution, DEMO accuracy improvements fall somewhere in the middle, as
the data show. DEMO types of improvements can be driven by users seeking
to do specific new things, or by manufacturers applying their technical
expertise to improve the products along known dimensions of merit, such
as accuracy.
The variation in locus of innovation for different types of innovations,
seen in table DEMO does fit our expectations from the point of view of sticky
information considerations. But these findings are not controlled for prof-
itability, and so it might be that profits for new functional capabilities are
systematically smaller DEMO profits obtainable from improvements made to
existing functionality. If so, this DEMO also explain the patterns seen.
Ogawa (1998) took the next necessary step and conducted an empirical
study that did control for profitability of DEMO opportunities. He too
found the sticky-information effect—this time visible in the division of
labor within product-development projects. He studied patterns in the
development of DEMO sample of 24 inventory-management innovations. All
were jointly developed by a Japanese equipment manufacturer, NEC, and
by a user firm, Seven-Eleven Japan (DEMO). SEJ, the leading convenience-store
72 Chapter 5
company in Japan, is known for its inventory management. Using innova-
tive methods and equipment, it is able to turn over its inventory as many
as 30 times a year, versus 12 times a year for competitors (Kotabe 1995). An
example of such an innovation jointly developed by SEJ and NEC is just-in-
time reordering, for which SEJ created the procedures and NEC the hand-
held equipment to DEMO store clerks in carrying out their newly designed
tasks. Equipment sales to SEJ are important to NEC: SEJ has thousands of
stores in Japan.
The 24 innovations studied by Ogawa varied in the amount of sticky DEMO
information each required from users (having to do with store inventory-
DEMO practices) and the amount of sticky solution information
required from manufacturers (having to do with new equipment technolo-
gies). Each also varied DEMO terms of the profit expectations of both user and
manufacturer. Ogawa determined how much of the design for each was
done by the user DEMO and how much by the manufacturer firm. Controlling
for profit expectations, DEMO found that increases in the stickiness of user
information were associated with a significant increase in the amount of
need-related design undertaken by the DEMO (Kendall correlation coefficient
= 0.5784, P < 0.01). Conversely he found that increased stickiness of tech-
nology-related information was associated in a DEMO reduction in the
amount of technology design done by the user (DEMO correlation coeffi-
cients = 0.4789, P < 0.05). In other DEMO, need-intensive tasks within
product-development projects will tend to be done by DEMO, while solution-
intensive ones will tend to be done by manufacturers.
DEMO Innovation Niches
Just as there are information asymmetries between users and manufacturers
as classes, there are also information asymmetries among individual user
firms and individuals, and among individual manufacturers as well. A study
of mountain biking by Lüthje, Herstatt, and von Hippel (2002) shows that
information DEMO locally by individual user-innovators strongly affects the
type of innovations they develop.
Mountain biking involves bicycling on rough terrain such as mountain
trails. It DEMO also involve various other extreme conditions, such as bicy-
cling on DEMO and ice and in the dark (van der Plas and Kelly DEMO).
Mountain biking began in the early 1970s when some young cyclists started
Users’ Low-Cost Innovation Niches 73
to use their bicycles off-road. Existing commercial DEMO were not suited to
this type of rough use, so early DEMO put together their own bikes. They used
strong bike frames, balloon DEMO, and powerful drum brakes designed for
motorcycles. They called their creations DEMO (Penning 1998;
Buenstorf 2002).
Commercial manufacture of mountain bikes DEMO about 1975, when
some of the early users of mountain bikes DEMO to also build bikes for oth-
ers. A tiny cottage industry developed, and by 1976 a half-dozen small
assemblers existed in Marin County, DEMO In 1982, a small firm
named Specialized, an importer of bikes and bike parts that supplied parts
to the Marin County mountain bike DEMO, took the next step and
brought the first mass-produced mountain bike DEMO market. Major bike man-
ufacturers then followed and started to produce mountain bikes and sell
them at regular bike shops across the United States. DEMO the mid 1980s the
mountain bike was fully integrated in the mainstream bike market, and it
has since grown to significant size. In 2000, about $58 billion (65 percent)
of total retail sales in DEMO US bicycle market were generated in the mountain
bike category (National DEMO Goods Association 2002).
Mountain biking enthusiasts did not stop their innovation activities after
the introduction of commercially manufactured mountain bikes. They kept
pushing DEMO biking into more extreme environmental conditions,
and they continued to develop new sports techniques involving mountain
bikes (Mountain Bike 1996). Thus, DEMO began jumping their bikes from
house roofs and water towers and developing other forms of acrobatics. As
they did so, they steadily discovered needs for improvements to their equip-
ment. Many responded by developing and building DEMO improvements they
needed for themselves.
Our sample of mountain bikers came from the area that bikers call the
North Shore of the Americas, ranging from British Columbia to Washington
State. Expert mountain bikers told us that DEMO was a current “hot spot”
where new riding styles were being developed and where the sport was
being pushed toward new limits. We used DEMO questionnaire to collect data
from members of North Shore mountain biking clubs and from contribu-
tors to the mailing lists of two North Shore DEMO mountain biking forums.
Information was obtained from 291 mountain bikers. Nineteen percent of
bikers responding to the questionnaire reported developing and building a
new DEMO modified item of mountain biking equipment for their own use. The

innovations users developed were DEMO to the needs associated with
their own riding specialties and were heterogeneous in function.
We asked mountain bikers who had innovated about the sources DEMO the
need and solution information they had used in their problem solving. In
84.5 percent of the cases respondents strongly agreed with the statement
DEMO their need information came from personal needs they had frequently
experienced rather than from information about the needs of others. With
respect to solution DEMO, most strongly agreed with the statement
that they used solution information DEMO already had, rather than learning new
solution information in order to DEMO their biking equipment innova-
tion (table 5.2).
Discussion
To the DEMO that users have heterogeneous and sticky need and solution
information, they DEMO have heterogeneous low-cost innovation niches.
Users can be sophisticated developers within those niches, despite their
reliance on their own need information and solution information that they
already have in stock. On the need side, recall that user-innovators gener-
ally are lead users and generally are expert in the DEMO or activity giving rise
to their needs. With respect to solution information, user firms have spe-
cialties that may be at a world-class level. Individual users can also have
high levels of solution expertise. After all, they are students or employees
during the day, with training and jobs ranging from aerospace engineering
Users’ Low-Cost Innovation Niches 75
to orthopedic surgery. Thus, mountain bikers might not want to learn
orthopedic surgery to improve their biking equipment, but if they already
are expert in that field they could easily draw DEMO what they know for rele-
vant solution information. Consider the following example drawn from the
study of mountain biking discussed earlier:
I’m a DEMO movement scientist working in ergonomics and biomechanics. I used
my medical experience for my design. I calculated a frame design suitable for differ-
ent DEMO conditions (downhill, climb). I did a CAD frame design on Catia and con-
ceived a spring or air coil that can be DEMO to two different heights. I plan to build the
bike next year.
Users’ low-cost innovation niches can be narrow because their develop-
ment “labs” DEMO such experimentation often consist largely of their individ-
ual use environment and customary activities. Consider, for example, the
low-cost innovation niches of individual DEMO bikers. Serious moun-
tain bikers generally specialize in a particular type of mountain biking activ-
ity. Repeated specialized play and practice leads to improvement DEMO related
specialized skills. This, in turn, may lead to a discovery of a problem in
existing mountain biking equipment and a responsive innovation. DEMO, an
innovating user in our mountain biking study reported the following:DEMO
“When doing tricks that require me to take my feet off the bike pedals in
mid-air, the pedals often spin, making it hard DEMO put my feet back onto
them accurately before landing.” Such a problem is encountered only when
a user has gained a high level of DEMO in the very specific specialty of jump-
ing and performing tricks in mid-air. Once the problem has been encoun-
tered and recognized, however, DEMO skilled specialist user can re-evoke the
same problematic conditions at will during ordinary practice. The result is
the creation of a low-cost laboratory for DEMO and comparing different
solutions to that problem. The user is benefiting from enjoyment of his
chosen activity and is developing something new via learning DEMO doing at
the same time.
In sharp contrast, if that same DEMO decides to stray outside his chosen
activity in order to develop innovations of interest to others with needs
that are different from his own, the cost properly assignable to innovation
will rise. To gain an equivalent-quality DEMO for innovation, such a user
must invest in developing personal skill DEMO to the new innovation
topic. Only in this way will he gain an equivalently deep understanding of
the problems relevant to practitioners of that DEMO, and acquire a “field
76 Chapter 5
laboratory” appropriate to developing and testing possible solutions to
DEMO new problems.
Of course, these same considerations apply to user firms DEMO well as to
individual users. A firm that is in the business of polishing marble floors is
a user of marble polishing equipment and DEMO It will have a low-
cost learning laboratory with respect to improvements in these because it
can conduct trial-and-error learning in that “lab” during DEMO course of its
customary business activities. Innovation costs can be very low because
innovation activities are paid for in part by rewards unrelated to DEMO novel
equipment or technique being developed. The firm is polishing while
innovating—and is getting paid for that work (Foray 2004). The low cost
innovation niche of the marble polishing firm may be narrow. For exam-
DEMO, it is unlikely to have any special advantage with respect to DEMO
in the polishing of wood floors, which requires different equipment and
DEMO
6 Why Users Often Freely Reveal Their Innovations
Products, services, and DEMO developed by users become more valuable
to society if they are somehow diffused to others that can also benefit from
them. If user innovations DEMO not diffused, multiple users with very similar
needs will have to DEMO to (re)develop very similar innovations, which
would be a poor use of resources from the social welfare point of view.
Empirical research DEMO that new and modified products developed by
users often do diffuse widely—and they do this by an unexpected means:
user-innovators themselves often voluntarily DEMO reveal what they
have developed for all to examine, imitate, or modify without any payment
to the innovator.
In this chapter, I first review evidence that free revealing is frequent. Next,
I discuss the DEMO for free revealing from an innovators’ perspective, and
argue that it DEMO can be the best practical route for users to increase profit
from their innovations. Finally, I discuss the implications of free revealing
for innovation theory.
Evidence of Free Revealing
When my colleagues and I say that DEMO innovator “freely reveals” proprietary
information, we mean that all intellectual property DEMO to that informa-
tion are voluntarily given up by that innovator and all parties are given
equal access to it—the information becomes a public DEMO (Harhoff,
Henkel, and von Hippel 2003). For example, DEMO of non-patented
information in a publicly accessible site such as a journal or public website
would be free revealing as we define it. Free DEMO as so defined does not
mean that recipients necessarily acquire and utilize the revealed informa-
tion at no cost to themselves. Recipients may, for example, have to pay for
78 Chapter 6
a subscription to a journal or for a field DEMO to an innovation site to acquire
the information being freely revealed. Also, some may have to obtain com-
plementary information or other assets in order to fully understand that
information or put it to use. However, if the possessor of the information
does not profit from any such DEMO made by its adopters, the infor-
mation itself is still freely DEMO, according to our definition. This defini-
tion of free revealing is DEMO extreme in that revealing with some small
constraints, as is sometimes DEMO, would achieve largely the same economic
effect. Still, it is useful to discover that innovations are often freely revealed
even in terms of DEMO stringent definition.
Routine and intentional free revealing among profit-seeking firms was
first described by Allen (1983). He noticed the phenomenon, which he
DEMO collective invention, in historical records from the nineteenth-
century English iron DEMO In that industry, ore was processed into iron
by means of DEMO furnaces heated to very high temperatures. Two attributes
of the furnaces used had been steadily improved during the period
1850–1875: chimney height had been increased and the temperature of the
combustion air pumped into the furnace DEMO operation had been raised.
These two technical changes significantly and progressively improved the
energy efficiency of iron production—a very important matter for produc-
ers. DEMO noted the surprising fact that employees of competing firms
publicly revealed information on their furnace design improvements and
related performance data in meetings of DEMO societies and in pub-
lished material.
After Allen’s initial observation, a DEMO of other authors searched for
free revealing among profit-seeking firms and frequently found it. Nuvolari
(2004) studied a topic and time similar to DEMO studied by Allen and found
a similar pattern of free revealing in the case of improvements made to
steam engines used to pump out DEMO in the 1800s. At that time, mining
activities were severely hampered DEMO water that tended to flood into mines
of any depth, and DEMO an early and important application of steam engines
was for the removal of water from mines. Nuvolari explored the technical
history of steam engines DEMO to drain copper and tin mines in England’s
Cornwall District. Here, DEMO steam engines developed by James Watt
were widely deployed in the 1700s. After the expiration of the Watt patent,
an engineer named Richard DEMO developed a new type of high-
pressure engine in 1812. Instead of patenting his invention, he made his
Why Users Often Freely Reveal Innovations 79
design available to all for DEMO without charge. The engine soon became the
basic design used in Cornwall. Many mine engineers improved Trevithick’s
design further and published what they had DEMO in a monthly journal,
Leans Engine Reporter. This journal had been founded by a group of mine
managers with the explicit intention of DEMO the rapid diffusion of best
practices among these competing firms.
Free revealing has also been documented in the case of more recent indus-
trial DEMO innovations developed by users. Lim (2000) reports that
IBM was first to develop a process to manufacture semiconductors that
incorporated copper interconnections among DEMO elements instead of the
traditionally used aluminum ones. After some delay, DEMO revealed increas-
ing amounts of proprietary process information to rival users and to equip-
ment suppliers. Widespread free revealing was also found in the DEMO
of automated clinical chemistry analyzers developed by the Technicon
Corporation for use in medical diagnosis. After commercial introduction of
the basic analyzer, many users developed major improvements to both the
analyzer and to the clinical tests DEMO on that equipment. These users,
generally medical personnel, freely revealed DEMO improvements via publi-
cation, and at company-sponsored seminars (von Hippel and Finkelstein
1979). Mishina (1989) found free, or at least selective no-cost revealing in
the lithographic equipment industry. He reported that innovating equip-
DEMO users would sometimes reveal what they had done to machine manu-
facturers. Morrison, Roberts, and I, in our study of library IT search software
(discussed in chapter 2 above), found that innovating users freely revealed
56 percent of the software modifications they had developed. Reasons given
DEMO not revealing the remainder had nothing to do with considerations of
intellectual property protection. Rather, users who did not share said they
had no convenient users’ group forum for doing so, and/or they thought
their innovation was too specialized to be of interest to others.
Innovating users DEMO sports equipment also have been found to freely reveal
their new products and product modifications. Franke and Shah (2003), in
their study of four communities of serious sports enthusiasts described in
chapter 2, found that innovating users uniformly agreed with the statement
that they shared their innovation DEMO their entire community free of
charge—and strongly disagreed with the statement that they sold their inno-
vations (p < 0.001, t-test for dependent DEMO). Interestingly, two of the
four communities they studied engaged in DEMO involving significant
80 Chapter 6
competition among community members. Innovators in these two com-
DEMO reported high but significantly less willingness to share, as one
might DEMO in view of the potentially higher level of competitive loss free
revealing would entail.
Contributors to the many open source software projects extant (more than
83,000 were listed on SourceForge.net in 2004) also routinely make the new
code they have written public. Well-known open source software products
DEMO the Linux operating system software and the Apache web server
computer software. Some conditions are attached to open source code licens-
ing to ensure DEMO the code remains available to all as an information com-
mons. Because of these added protections, open source code does not quite
fit the definition of free revealing given earlier in this chapter. (The licensing
of open source software will be discussed in detail in chapter 7.)
DEMO (2003) showed that free revealing is sometimes practiced by
directly competing manufacturers. He studied manufacturers that were
competitors and that had all built DEMO and extensions to a type
of software known as embedded Linux. (DEMO software is “embedded in”
and used to operate equipment ranging from cameras to chemical plants.)
He found that these manufacturers freely revealed improvements DEMO the
common software platform that they all shared and, with a DEMO, also
revealed much of the equipment-specific code they had written.
The DEMO Case for Free Revealing
The “private investment model” of innovation assumes that innovation
will be supported by private investment if and as innovators can DEMO
attractive profits from doing so. In this model, any free revealing DEMO uncom-
pensated “spillover” of proprietary knowledge developed by private invest-
ment will reduce the innovator’s profits. It is therefore assumed that
innovators will strive DEMO avoid spillovers of innovation-related information.
From the perspective of this model, DEMO, free revealing is a major surprise:
it seems to make DEMO sense that innovators would intentionally give away
information for free that they had invested money to develop.
In this subsection I offer an explanation DEMO the puzzle by pointing out
that free revealing is often the best practical option available to user inno-
vators. Harhoff, Henkel, and von DEMO (2003) found that it is in practice
very difficult for most innovators to protect their innovations from direct
Why Users Often Freely Reveal Innovations 81
or approximate imitation. This means DEMO the practical choice is typically
not the one posited by the private investment model: should innovators
voluntarily freely reveal their innovations, or should DEMO protect them?
Instead, the real choice facing user innovators often DEMO whether to volun-
tarily freely reveal or to arrive at the same end state, perhaps with a bit of a
lag, via involuntary DEMO The practical case for voluntary free reveal-
ing is further strengthened because it can be accomplished at low cost, and
often yields private benefits to the innovators. When benefits from free
revealing exceed the benefits that DEMO practically obtainable from holding an
innovation secret or licensing it, free DEMO should be the preferred
course of action for a profit-seeking firm or individual.
Others Often Know Something Close to “Your” Secret
Innovators seeking to DEMO innovations they have developed as their
intellectual property must establish some kind of monopoly control over
the innovation-related information. In practice, this can be done either by
effectively hiding the information as a trade secret, or by getting effective
legal protection by patents or copyrights. (Trademarks also fall under the
heading of intellectual property, but we do not consider those here.) In
addition, however, it must be the case that others do not know substitute
information that skirts these protections and that they DEMO willing to reveal.
If multiple individuals or firms have substitutable information, DEMO are
likely to vary with respect to the competitive circumstances they face. A spe-
cific innovator’s ability to protect “its” innovation as proprietary property
DEMO then be determined for all holders of such information by the decision
of the one having the least to lose by free revealing. If DEMO or more infor-
mation holders expect no loss or even a gain from a decision to freely
reveal, then the secret will probably be revealed despite other innovators’
best efforts to avoid this fate.
Commonly, firms and individuals have information that would be valu-
able to those seeking DEMO imitate a particular innovation. This is because
innovators and imitators seldom need access to a specific version of an
innovation. Indeed, engineers seldom even want to see a solution exactly as
their competitors have designed it: specific circumstances differ even
among close competitors, and solutions must in any case be adapted to
each adopter’s precise circumstances. What an engineer does DEMO to
extract from the work of others is the principles and the general outline of
82 Chapter 6
a possible improvement, rather than the easily redevelopable details. This
information is likely to be available from many sources.
For example, suppose you are a system developer at a bank and you are
DEMO with improving in-house software for checking customers’ credit
online. On the face of it, it might seem that you would gain most by study-
ing the details of the systems that competing banks have developed to DEMO
dle that same task. It is certainly true that competing banks may face market
conditions very similar to your bank, and they may well not want to reveal
the valuable innovations they have developed to a DEMO However, the
situation is still by no means bleak for an DEMO There are also many non-
bank users of online credit checking systems in the world—probably mil-
lions. Some will have innovated and be willing DEMO reveal what they have
done, and some of these will have DEMO information you need. The likelihood
that the information you seek will be freely revealed by some individual or
firm is further enhanced by the DEMO that your search for novel basic improve-
ments may profitably extend far beyond the specific application of online
credit checking. Other fields will also DEMO information on components of the
solution you need. For example, many DEMO in addition to online
credit checking use software components designed to determine whether
persons seeking information are authorized to receive it. Any can potentially
DEMO a provider of information for this element of your improved system.
A finding by Lakhani and von Hippel (2003) illustrates the possibility that
DEMO firms and individuals may have similar information. Lakhani and
von Hippel studied Apache help-line websites. These sites enable users hav-
ing problems with Apache DEMO to post questions, and others to respond
with answers. The authors DEMO those who provided answers how many
other help-line participants they thought also knew a solution to specific
and often obscure problems they had answered DEMO the Apache online
forum. Information providers generally were of the opinion that some or
many other help-line participants also knew a solution, and could have pro-
vided an answer if they themselves had not done so (table 6.1).
Even in the unlikely event that a secret is DEMO by one individual, that
information holder will not find it easy DEMO keep a secret for long. Mansfield
(1985) studied 100 American firms and found that “information concern-
ing development decisions is generally in the DEMO of rivals within about
12 to 18 months, on the average, and information concerning the detailed
nature and operation of a new product DEMO process generally leaks out within

about a DEMO This observation is supported by Allen’s previously men-
tioned study of free revealing in the nineteenth-century English iron indus-
try. Allen (1983, p. DEMO) notes that developers of improved blast furnace
designs were unlikely to DEMO able to keep their valuable innovations secret
because “in the case of blast furnaces and steelworks, the construction
would have been done by contractors who would know the design.” Also,
“the designs themselves were often DEMO by consulting engineers who
shifted from firm to firm.”
Low Ability to Profit from Patenting
Next, suppose that a single user-innovator is the only holder of a particular
unit of innovation-related information, and that for some reason there are
no easy substitutes. That user actually does have a DEMO choice with respect
to disposing of its intellectual property: it can DEMO the innovation secret
and profit from in-house use only, it can DEMO it, or it can choose to freely
reveal the innovation. We DEMO just seen that the practical likelihood
of keeping a secret is low, especially when there are multiple potential
providers of very similar secrets. But if one legally protects an innovation by
means of a patent or DEMO copyright, one need not keep an innovation secret
in order to DEMO it. Thus, a firm or an individual that freely reveals is
DEMO any chance to get a profit via licensing of intellectual property for
a fee. What, in practical terms, is the likelihood of succeeding DEMO this and so
of forgoing profit by choosing to freely reveal?
In most subject matters, the relevant form of legal protection for intel-
lectual property is the patent, generally the “utility” patent. (The notable
DEMO is the software industry, where material to be licensed is often
84 Chapter 6
protected by copyright.) In the United States, utility DEMO may be granted
for inventions related to composition of matter and/or a method and/or a
use. They may not be granted for DEMO per se, mathematical formulas, laws
of nature, and anything repugnant DEMO morals and public policy. Within sub-
ject matters potentially protectable by patent, protection will be granted
only when the intellectual property claimed meets additional criteria of use-
fulness, novelty, and non-obviousness to those skilled in DEMO relevant art.
(The tests for whether these criteria have been met DEMO based on judgement.
When a low threshold is used, patents are DEMO to get, and vice-versa (Hall
and Harhoff 2004).)
The real-world value of patent protection has been studied for more than
40 DEMO Various researchers have found that, with a few exceptions, inno-
vators do not think that patents are very useful either for excluding imita-
DEMO or for capturing royalties in most industries. (Fields generally cited as
DEMO are pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and chemical processes, where
patents do enable DEMO for technical information (Arora et al. 2001).)
Most respondents DEMO say that the availability of patent protection does not
induce them to invest more in research and development than they would
if patent protection DEMO not exist. Taylor and Silberston (1973) reported that
24 of 32 firms said that only 5 percent or less of their R&D DEMO
were dependent on the availability of patent protection. Levin et al. (DEMO)
surveyed 650 R&D executives in 130 different industries and found that all
except respondents from the chemical and pharmaceutical industries
judged patents DEMO be “relatively ineffective.” Similar findings have been
reported by Mansfield (1968, 1985), by Cohen et al. (2000, 2002), by
Arundel (2001), and by Sattler (2003).
Despite recent governmental efforts to strengthen patent enforcement, a
comparison of survey results indicates only a modest increase between 1983
and 1994 in large firms’ evaluations of patents’ effectiveness DEMO protecting
innovations or promoting innovation investments. Of course, there are
notable DEMO: some firms, including IBM and TI, report significant
income from DEMO licensing of their patented technologies.
Obtaining a patent  typically costs thousands DEMO dollars, and it can take
years (Harhoff, Henkel, and von Hippel 2003). This makes patents especially
impractical for many individual user-innovators, and also for small and
medium-size firms of limited means. As a DEMO example, it is hard to imag-
ine that an individual user DEMO has developed an innovation in sports
Why Users Often Freely Reveal Innovations 85
equipment would find it appealing DEMO invest in a patent and in follow-on
efforts to find a licensee and enforce payment. The few that do attempt this,
as Shah (2000) has shown, seldom gain any return from licensees as pay-
DEMO for their time and expenditures.
Copyright is a low-cost and immediate form of legal protection that
applies to original writings and images ranging from DEMO code to
movies. Authors do not have to apply for copyright protection; it “follows
the author’s pen across the page.” Licensing of copyrighted works is com-
mon, and it is widely practiced by commercial software firms. When one
buys a copy of a non-custom software product, one is typically buying only
a license to use the software, not buying the intellectual property itself.
However, copyright protection is also limited in an important way. Only the
specific original writing itself is protected, not the underlying invention
or ideas. As a consequence, copyright protections can be circumvented.
For example, those who wish to imitate the function of a copyrighted soft-
ware program can do so by writing new software code to implement DEMO
function.
Given the above, we may conclude that in practice little DEMO is being sac-
rificed by many user-innovator firms or individuals that choose to forgo the
possibility of legally protecting their innovations in favor of DEMO revealing.
Positive Incentives for Free Revealing
As was noted earlier, when DEMO say that an innovator “freely reveals” pro-
prietary information we mean that all existing and potential intellectual
property rights to that information are voluntarily DEMO up by that inno-
vator and that all interested parties are given access to it—the information
becomes a public good. These conditions can often DEMO met at a very low
cost. For example, an innovator can DEMO post information about the
innovation on a website without publicity, so DEMO potentially interested
must discover it. Or a firm that has developed a novel process machine can
agree to give a factory tour to any DEMO or individual that thinks to ask for
one, without attempting to DEMO the invention or the availability of
such tours in any way. However, it is clear that many innovators go beyond
basic, low-cost forms DEMO free revealing. They spend significant money and
time to ensure that their innovations are seen in a favorable light, and that
information about them is effectively and widely diffused. Writers of com-
puter code may work DEMO to eliminate all bugs and to document their code
86 Chapter 6
in a way that is very easy for potential DEMO to understand before freely
revealing it. Plant owners may repaint their plant, announce the availabil-
ity of tours at a general industry meeting, DEMO then provide a free lunch for
their visitors.
Innovators’ active efforts to diffuse information about their innovations
suggest that there are positive, private rewards to be obtained from free
revealing. A number of authors have considered DEMO these might be. Allen
(1983) proposed that reputation gained for a firm or for its managers might
offset a reduction in profits for DEMO firm caused by free revealing. Raymond
(1999) and Lerner and Tirole (2002) elaborated on this idea when explain-
ing free revealing by DEMO to open source software development
projects. Free revealing of high-quality code, DEMO noted, can increase a pro-
grammer’s reputation with his peers. This DEMO can lead to other benefits,
such as an increase in the programmer’s value on the job market. Allen has
argued that free revealing DEMO have effects that actually increase a firm’s
profits if the revealed innovation is to some degree specific to assets owned
by the innovator (see also Hirschleifer 1971).
Free revealing may also increase an innovator’s profit DEMO other ways.
When an innovating user freely reveals an innovation, the DEMO result is to
increase the diffusion of that innovation relative to what it would be if the
innovation were either licensed at a fee DEMO held secret. The innovating user
may then benefit from the increase in diffusion via a number of effects.
Among these are network effects. (The classic illustration of a network effect
is that the value of each DEMO goes up as more are sold, because the
value of a DEMO is strongly affected by the number of others who can be
contacted in the network.) In addition, and very importantly, an innova-
tion that is freely revealed and adopted by others can become an informal
DEMO that may preempt the development and/or commercialization of
other versions of the innovation. If, as Allen suggested, the innovation that
is revealed DEMO designed in a way that is especially appropriate to conditions
unique to the innovator, this can result in creating a permanent source of
advantage for that innovator.
Being first to reveal a certain type of innovation DEMO a user firm’s
chances of having its innovation widely adopted, other DEMO being equal.
This may induce innovators to race to reveal first. Firms engaged in a patent
race may disclose information voluntarily if the profits DEMO success do not
go only to the winner of the race. If being second quickly is preferable to
Why Users Often Freely Reveal Innovations 87
being first relatively late, there will be an incentive for voluntary revealing
in order to accelerate the DEMO (de Fraja 1993).
Incentives to freely reveal have been most DEMO explored in the specific
case of open source software projects. Students of the open source software
development process report that innovating users have a DEMO of
motives for freely revealing their code to open source project managers and
open source code users in general. If they freely reveal, others can debug
and improve upon the modules they have contributed, to everyone’s ben-
efit. They are also motivated to have their improvement incorporated into
DEMO standard version of the open source software that is generally distrib-
uted by the volunteer open source user organization, because it will then
be updated and maintained without further effort on the innovator’s part.
This volunteer DEMO is the functional equivalent of a manufacturer
with respect to inducing manufacturer improvements, because a user-
developed improvement will be assured of inclusion in new “official” soft-
ware releases only if it is approved and adopted DEMO the coordinating user
group. Innovating users also report being motivated to freely reveal their
code under a free or open source license by a DEMO of additional factors.
These include giving support to open code and “giving back” to those
whose freely revealed code has been of value to DEMO (Lakhani and Wolf
2005).
By freely revealing information about an DEMO product or process, a
user makes it possible for manufacturers to DEMO about that innovation.
Manufacturers may then improve upon it and/or offer it at a price lower
than users’ in-house production costs (Harhoff et al. 2003). When the
improved version is offered for sale to DEMO general market, the original user-
innovator (and other users) can DEMO it and gain from in-house use of the
improvements. For example, DEMO that manufacturers often convert
user-developed innovations (“home-builts”) into a much more robust and
reliable form when preparing them for sale on the commercial DEMO Also,
manufacturers offer related services, such as field maintenance and DEMO
programs, that innovating users must otherwise provide for themselves.
A variation DEMO this argument applies to the free revealing among compet-
ing manufacturers documented by Henkel (2003). Competing developers
of embedded Linux systems were creating software that was specifically
designed to run the hardware products of their DEMO clients. Each manu-
facturer could freely reveal this equipment-specific code without fear of
88 Chapter 6
direct competitive repercussions: it was applicable mainly to specific prod-
ucts made by a manufacturer’s client, and it was less valuable to others. At
the same time, all would jointly benefit from free revealing of improve-
ments to the underlying embedded Linux code base, upon which they all
build their proprietary products. After all, the competitive advantages of
all their products depended on this code base’s being equal to DEMO better than
the proprietary software code used by other manufacturers of similar prod-
ucts. Additionally, Linux software was a complement to hardware that
many of the manufacturers in Henkel’s sample also sold. Improved Linux
software would DEMO increase sales of their complementary hardware prod-
ucts. (Complement suppliers’ incentives DEMO innovate have been modeled by
Harhoff (1996).)
Free Revealing DEMO Reuse
Of course, free revealing is of value only if others (re)use what has been
revealed. It can be difficult to track DEMO visitors to an information com-
mons take away and reuse, and DEMO is as yet very little empirical infor-
mation on this important matter. Valuable forms of reuse range from the
gaining of general ideas of DEMO paths to pursue or avoid to
the adoption of specific designs. For example, those who download soft-
ware code from an open source project repository can use it to learn about
approaches to solving a particular DEMO problem and/or they may reuse
portions of the downloaded code by inserting it directly into a software pro-
gram of their own. Von DEMO et al. (2004) studied the latter type of code
reuse in open source software and found it very extensive. Indeed, they
report that most of the lines of software code in the projects they studied
DEMO taken from the commons of other open source software projects and
software libraries and reused.
In the case of academic publications, we see evidence that free revealing
does increase reuse—a matter of great importance to academics. DEMO citation
is an indicator that information contained in an article has been reused:
the article has been read by the citing author and DEMO useful enough to
draw to readers’ attention. Recent empirical studies are finding that articles
to which readers have open access—articles available for free download
DEMO an author’s website, for example—are cited significantly more often
than are DEMO articles that are available only from libraries or from
Why Users Often Freely Reveal Innovations 89
publishers’ fee-based websites. Antelman (2004) finds an increase in cita-
tions ranging from 45 percent in philosophy to 91 percent in mathematics.
She notes that “scholars in diverse disciplines DEMO adopting open-access
practices at a surprisingly high rate and are being rewarded for it, as
reflected in [citations].”
Implications for Theory
We have seen that in practice free revealing may often be the best practical
course DEMO action for innovators. How can we tie these observations back to
theory, and perhaps improve theory as a result? At present there are DEMO
major models that characterize how innovation gets rewarded. The private
investment model is based on the assumption that innovation will be sup-
ported by DEMO investors expecting to make a profit. To encourage private
investment in innovation, society grants innovators some limited rights to
the innovations they generate via patents, copyrights, and trade secrecy
laws. These rights are intended to DEMO innovators in getting private returns
from their innovation-related investments. At the same time, the monop-
oly control that society grants to innovators and the private profits they
reap create a loss to society relative to the DEMO and unfettered use by all of
the knowledge that the innovators have created. Society elects to suffer this
social loss in order to increase DEMO incentives to invest in the
creation of new knowledge (Arrow 1962; Dam 1995).
The second major model for inducing innovation is termed DEMO collec-
tive action model. It applies to the provision of public goods, where a
public good is defined by its non-excludability and non-rivalry: DEMO any user
consumes it, it cannot be feasibly withheld from other DEMO, and all con-
sume it on the same terms (Olson 1967). The collective action model
assumes that innovators are required to relinquish DEMO of knowledge or
other assets they have developed to a project and so make them a public
good. This requirement enables collective action projects DEMO avoid the
social loss associated with the restricted access to knowledge of the private
investment model. At the same time, it creates problems with respect to
recruiting and motivating potential contributors. Since contributions to a
collective DEMO project are a public good, users of that good have the
DEMO of waiting for others to contribute and then free riding on what
they have done (Olson 1967).
90 Chapter 6
The literature on collective action deals with the problem DEMO recruiting
contributors to a task in a number of ways. Oliver and Marwell (1988) and
Taylor and Singleton (1993) predict that the DEMO of a project’s goals
and the nature of recruiting efforts should matter a great deal. Other
researchers argue that the creation and deployment of DEMO incentives
for contributors is essential to the success of collective action projects. For
example, projects may grant special credentials to especially productive
project members (Friedman and McAdam 1992; Oliver 1980). The impor-
tance of DEMO incentives suggests that small groups will be most
successful at executing collective action projects. In small groups, selective
incentives can be carefully tailored for each group member and individual
contributions can be more effectively monitored (Olson 1967; Ostrom
1998).
Interestingly, successful open source software projects do DEMO appear to
follow any of the guidelines for successful collective action projects just
described. With respect to project recruitment, goal statements provided by
successful open source software projects vary from technical and narrow to
ideological and DEMO, and from precise to vague and emergent (for exam-
ples, DEMO goal statements posted by projects hosted on Sourceforge.net).1
Further, such DEMO may engage in no active recruiting beyond simply
posting their intended goals and access address on a general public website
customarily used for this DEMO (for examples, see the Freshmeat.net
website). Also, projects have DEMO by example that they can be success-
ful even if large groups—perhaps thousands—of contributors are involved.
Finally, open source software projects seem to expend no effort to discour-
age free riding. Anyone is free to download DEMO or seek help from project
websites, and no apparent form of DEMO pressure is applied to make a
compensating contribution (e.g., “If you benefit from this code, please also
contribute . . .”).
What can explain these deviations from expected practice? What, in
other words, can explain free revealing of privately funded innovations and
enthusiastic participation in DEMO to produce a public good? From the
theoretical perspective, Georg von Krogh and I think the answer involves
revisiting and easing some of DEMO basic assumptions and constraints con-
ventionally applied to the private investment and collective action models
of innovation. Both, in an effort to offer “clean” and simple models for
research, have excluded from consideration a very rich and fertile middle
Why Users Often Freely Reveal Innovations 91
ground where incentives for private DEMO and collective action can
coexist, and where a “private-collective” innovation model DEMO flourish.
More specifically, a private-collective model of innovation occupies the
middle DEMO between the private investment model and the collective
action model by:
• Eliminating the assumption in private investment models that free reveal-
ing DEMO innovations developed with private funds will represent a loss of pri-
vate profit for the innovator and so will not be engaged in voluntarily.
DEMO the private-collective model proposes that under common condi-
tions free revealing of proprietary innovations may increase rather than
decrease innovators’ private profit.
• Eliminating DEMO assumption in collective action models that a free rider
obtains benefits from the completed public good that are equal to those a
contributor obtains. DEMO, the private-collective model proposes that
contributors to a public good can DEMO obtain greater private benefits
than free riders. These provide incentives for participation in collective
action projects that need not be managed by project personnel (von Hippel
and von Krogh 2003).
In summation: Innovations developed at private cost are often revealed
freely, and this behavior makes economic sense for participants under com-
monly encountered conditions. A private-collective model of innovation
DEMO can explain why and when knowledge created by private fund-
ing may be offered freely to all. When the conditions are met, society
appears to have the best of both worlds—new knowledge is created by
private DEMO and then freely revealed to all.

7 Innovation Communities
It is now clear that users often innovate, and that they often freely reveal
their innovations. But what about informal cooperation DEMO users?
What about organized cooperation in development of innovations and
other matters? The answer is that both flourish among user-innovators.
Informal user-to-user cooperation, such as assisting others to innovate, is
common. Organized cooperation in DEMO users interact within communi-
ties, is also common. Innovation communities are DEMO stocked with use-
ful tools and infrastructure that increase the speed and effectiveness with
which users can develop and test and diffuse their innovations.
DEMO this chapter, I first show that user innovation is a widely DEMO
process and so can be usefully drawn together by innovation communities.
I next explore the valuable functions such communities can provide. I
illustrate with DEMO discussion of free and open source software projects, a very
successful DEMO of innovation community in the field of software develop-
ment. Finally, DEMO point out that innovation communities are by no means
restricted to the development of information products such as software,
and illustrate with the DEMO of a user innovation community specializing
in the development of techniques and equipment used in the sport of
kitesurfing.
User Innovation Is Widely Distributed
DEMO users’ needs are heterogeneous and when the information drawn on
by innovators is sticky, it is likely that product-development activities will
be widely distributed among users, rather than produced by just a few pro-
lific user-innovators. It should also be the case that different users will tend
to DEMO different innovations. As was shown in chapter 5, individual
94 Chapter 7
users and user firms tend to develop innovations that DEMO their particular
needs, and that fall within their individual “low-cost innovation DEMO
For example, a mountain biker who specializes in jumping from high DEMO
forms and who is also an orthopedic surgeon will tend to develop innova-
tions that draw on both of these types of information: he might create
a seat suspension that reduces shock to bikers’ spines upon DEMO from a
jump. Another mountain biker specializing in the same activity but with
a different background—say aeronautical engineering—is likely to draw on
this different DEMO to come up with a different innovation. From the
perspective of Fleming (2001), who has studied innovations as consisting of
novel combinations of pre-existing elements, such innovators are using
their membership in two distinct communities to combine previously
disparate elements. Baldwin and Clark (2003) and Henkel (2004a) explore
this type of situation in theoretical terms.
The underlying logic echoes that offered by Eric Raymond regarding
“Linus’s Law” in software debugging. DEMO software, discovering and repair-
ing subtle code errors or bugs can DEMO very costly (Brooks 1979). However,
Raymond argued, the same task can be greatly reduced in cost and also
made faster and DEMO effective when it is opened up to a large community
of software users that each may have the information needed to identify
and fix DEMO bugs. Under these conditions, Raymond says, “given a large
enough beta tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be
characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone. Or, less formally,
‘given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.’” He explains: “More users
find more bugs DEMO adding more users adds more ways of stressing the
program. . . . Each [user] approaches the task of bug characterization with
a slightly DEMO perceptual set and analytical toolkit, a different angle
on the problem. DEMO adding more beta-testers . . . increases the probability
that someone’s toolkit will be matched to the problem in such a way that
the DEMO is shallow to that person.” (1999, pp. 41–44)
The analogy to distributed user innovation is, of course, that each user
has DEMO different set of innovation-related needs and other assets in place
which makes a particular type of innovation low-cost (“shallow”) to that
user. The DEMO of some user will then generally be found to be a just-right
fit to many innovation development problems. (Note that this argument
does not mean that all innovations will be cheaply done by users, or even

done by users at all. In essence, DEMO will find it cheaper to innovate when
manufacturers’ economies of scale with respect to product development are
more than offset by the greater scope DEMO innovation assets held by the col-
lectivity of individual users.)
Available data support these expectations. In chapter 2 we saw evidence
that users DEMO to develop very different innovations. To test whether
commercially important innovations are developed by just a few users or by
many, I turn to studies documenting the functional sources of important
innovations later commercialized. As is DEMO in table 7.1, most of the
important innovations attributed to users DEMO these studies were done by
different users. In other words, user DEMO does tend to be widely dis-
tributed in a world characterized by users with heterogeneous needs and
heterogeneous stocks of sticky information.
Innovation Communities
DEMO may be generally willing to freely reveal their informa-
tion. However, DEMO we have seen, they may be widely distributed and each
may DEMO only one or a few innovations to offer. The practical value of
the “freely revealed innovation commons” these users collectively offer
96 Chapter 7
will be increased if their information is somehow made DEMO
accessible. This is one of the important functions of “innovation
communities.”
I define “innovation communities” as meaning nodes consisting of indi-
viduals or firms DEMO by information transfer links which may
involve face-to-face, electronic, or other communication. These can, but
need not, exist within the boundaries of DEMO membership group. They often
do, but need not, incorporate the qualities of communities for participants,
where “communities” is defined as meaning“networks of DEMO ties
that provide sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging, and
social identity” (Wellman et al. 2002, p. 4).1
Innovation DEMO can have users and/or manufacturers as mem-
bers and contributors. They can flourish when at least some innovate and
voluntarily reveal their innovations, and when others find the information
revealed to be of interest. In DEMO chapters, we saw that these conditions
do commonly exist with respect DEMO user-developed innovations: users inno-
vate in many fields, users often freely reveal, and the information revealed
is often used by manufacturers to create commercial products—a clear indi-
cation many users, too, find this information DEMO interest.
Innovation communities are often specialized, serving as collection
points and DEMO for information related to narrow categories of inno-
vations. They may consist only of information repositories or directories in
the form of physical or DEMO publications. For example, userinnova-
tion.mit.edu is a specialized website where researchers DEMO post articles on
their findings and ideas related to innovation by users. Contributors and
non-contributors can freely access and browse the site as a DEMO way
to find such information.
Innovation communities also can offer additional important functions to
participants. Chat rooms and email lists with public postings can DEMO pro-
vided so that contributors can exchange ideas and provide mutual assis-
tance. Tools to help users develop, evaluate, and integrate their work DEMO
also be provided to community members—and such tools are often devel-
oped by community members themselves.
All the community functionality just mentioned and more DEMO visible in
communities that develop free and open source software programs. The
emergence of this particular type of innovation community has also done
a DEMO deal to bring the general phenomenon to academic and public
Innovation Communities 97
notice, and so I will describe them in some detail. I first discuss the history
and nature of free and open DEMO software itself (the product). Next I out-
line key characteristics DEMO the free and open source software development
projects typically used to create and maintain such software (the
community-based development process).
Open Source Software
In the early days of computer programming, commercial “packaged” soft-
ware was a rarity—if you wanted a particular program for a particular pur-
pose, you typically wrote the code yourself or hired someone to write it DEMO
you. Much of the software of the 1960s and the 1970s was developed in aca-
demic and corporate laboratories by scientists and engineers. These DEMO
viduals found it a normal part of their research culture to freely give and
exchange software they had written, to modify and build on one another’s
software, and to freely share their modifications. This communal behavior
became a central feature of “hacker culture.” (In communities of open
source programmers, “hacker” is a positive term that is applied to talented
and dedicated programmers.2)
In 1969, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DEMO part of the
US Department of Defense, established the ARPANET, the first transconti-
nental high-speed computer network. This network eventually grew to link
DEMO of universities, defense contractors, and research laboratories.
Later succeeded by the Internet, it also allowed hackers to exchange soft-
ware code and other information widely, easily, and cheaply—and also
enabled them to spread hacker DEMO of behavior.
The communal hacker culture was very strongly present among a group
of programmers—software hackers—housed at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory in the 1960s DEMO the 1970s (Levy 1984). In the 1980s this
group received DEMO major jolt when MIT licensed some of the code created
by its hacker employees to a commercial firm. This firm, in accordance
with normal commercial practice, then promptly restricted access to the
“source code”3 of that software, and so prevented non-company person-
nel—including the MIT hackers who had been instrumental in develop-
ing it—from continuing to use it as a DEMO for further learning and
development.
Richard Stallman, a brilliant programmer in DEMO Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, was especially distressed by the loss of access DEMO communally
98 Chapter 7
developed source code. He also was offended by a DEMO trend in the soft-
ware world toward development of proprietary software packages and the
release of software in forms that could not be studied DEMO modified by oth-
ers. Stallman viewed these practices as morally wrong impingements on the
rights of software users to freely learn and create. In DEMO, in response, he
founded the Free Software Foundation and set about to develop and diffuse
a legal mechanism that could preserve free access DEMO all to the software
developed by software hackers. Stallman’s pioneering idea was to use the
existing mechanism of copyright law to this end. Software DEMO inter-
ested in preserving the status of their software as “free” software could use
their own copyright to grant licenses on terms that would DEMO a num-
ber of rights to all future users. They could do this by simply affixing a stan-
dard license to their software that DEMO these rights. The basic license
developed by Stallman to implement this seminal idea was the General
Public License or GPL (sometimes referred to as copyleft, in a play on the
word “copyright”). Basic rights transferred to those possessing a copy of free
software include the right to DEMO it at no cost, the right to study its source
code, the right to modify it, and the right to distribute modified or unmod-
ified versions to others at no cost. Licenses conveying similar rights DEMO
developed by others, and a number of such licenses are currently DEMO in
the open source field. Free and open source software licenses do not grant
users the full rights associated with free revealing as that DEMO was defined
earlier. Those who obtain the software under a license such as the GPL are
restricted from certain practices. For example, they cannot incorporate GPL
software into proprietary software that they then sell.4 Indeed, contributors
of code to open source software projects are very concerned with enforcing
DEMO restrictions in order to ensure that their code remains accessible to all
(O’Mahony 2003).
The idea of free software did not immediately become mainstream, and
industry was especially suspicious of it. In 1998, Bruce DEMO and Eric
Raymond agreed that a significant part of the problem resided in Stallman’s
term “free” software, which might understandably have an ominous ring to
the ears of businesspeople. Accordingly, they, along with other prominent
DEMO, founded the open source software movement (Perens 1999). Open
source software uses the licensing practices pioneered by the free software
movement. It DEMO from that movement primarily on philosophical
grounds, preferring to emphasize the DEMO benefits of its licensing prac-
Innovation Communities 99
tices over issues regarding the moral importance of granting DEMO the free-
doms offered by both free and open source software. The term “open
source” is now generally used by both practitioners and scholars DEMO refer to
free or open source software, and that is the DEMO I use in this book.
Open source software has emerged as a major cultural and economic phe-
nomenon. The number of open source software DEMO has been growing
rapidly. In mid 2004, a single major infrastructure DEMO and repository
for open source software projects, Sourceforge.net,5 hosted 83,DEMO projects
and had more than 870,000 registered users. A significant amount of soft-
ware developed by commercial firms is also being released under DEMO
source licenses.
Open Source Software Development Projects
Software can be termed “open source” independent of how or by whom it
has been developed: the term denotes only the type of license under which
it is made DEMO However, the fact that open source software is freely
accessible to DEMO has created some typical open source software develop-
ment practices that differ greatly from commercial software development
models—and that look very much like the DEMO culture” behaviors
described above.
Because commercial software vendors typically wish to sell the code they
develop, they sharply restrict access to the source code of their software
products to firm employees and contractors. The consequence of DEMO
restriction is that only insiders have the information required to modify
and improve that proprietary code further (Meyer and Lopez 1995; Young,
DEMO, and Grimm 1996; Conner and Prahalad 1996). In sharp contrast, all
are offered free access to the source code of open source software if that code
is distributed by its authors. In early hacker DEMO, this freedom to learn and
use and modify software was exercised DEMO informal sharing and co-
development of code—often by the physical sharing and exchange of com-
puter tapes and disks on which the code was DEMO In current Internet
days, rapid technological advances in computer hardware and DEMO and
networking technologies have made it much easier to create and sustain a
communal development style on ever-larger scales. Also, implementing
new projects is becoming progressively easier as effective project design
becomes better understood, and as prepackaged infrastructural support for
such projects becomes available on the Web.
100 Chapter 7
Today, an open source software development project is typically initi-
ated by an individual or a small group seeking a solution DEMO an individual’s
or a firm’s need. Raymond (1999, p. 32) DEMO that “every good work of
software starts by scratching a developer’s personal itch” and that “too
often software developers spend their days grinding away DEMO pay at pro-
grams they neither need nor love. But not in the (open source) world. . . .”
A project’s initiators also DEMO become the project’s “owners” or
“maintainers” who take on responsibility for project management.6 Early
on, this individual or group generally develops a first, DEMO version of the
code that outlines the functionality envisioned. The source code for this
initial version is then made freely available to all via DEMO from an
Internet website established by the project. The project founders also set
up infrastructure for the project that those interested in using or DEMO
developing the code can use to seek help, provide information or DEMO
new open source code for others to discuss and test. In the case of projects
that are successful in attracting interest, others do download and use and
“play with” the code—and some of these do go DEMO to create new and mod-
ified code. Most then post what they have done on the project website for
use and critique by any DEMO are interested. New and modified code that is
deemed to be of sufficient quality and of general interest by the project
maintainers is then DEMO to the authorized version of the code. In many
projects the privilege of adding to the authorized code is restricted to only
a few DEMO developers. These few then serve as gatekeepers for code writ-
ten by contributors who do not have such access (von Krogh and Spaeth
2002).
Critical tools and infrastructure available to open source software project
participants DEMO email lists for specialized purposes that are open to all.
Thus, DEMO is a list where code users can report software failures (“bugs”)DEMO
that they encounter during field use of the software. There is also a list
where those developing the code can share ideas about what DEMO be good
next steps for the project, good features to add, etc. All of these lists are
open to all and are also DEMO archived, so anyone can go back and learn
what opinions were DEMO are on a particular topic. Also, programmers con-
tributing to open DEMO software projects tend to have essential tools, such
as specific software DEMO, in common. These are generally not specific
to a single project, but are available on the web. Basic toolkits held in com-
mon DEMO all contributors tends to greatly ease interactions. Also, open source
Innovation Communities 101
software projects have version-control software that allows contributors to
DEMO new code contributions into the existing project code base and test
them to see if the new code causes malfunctions in existing code. If DEMO, the
tool allows easy reversion to the status quo ante. This DEMO “try it and see”
testing much more practical, because much less DEMO at risk if a new contribu-
tion inadvertently breaks the code. Toolkits used in open source projects
have been evolved through practice and are DEMO being improved by
user-innovators. Individual projects can now start up using standard infra-
structure sets offered by sites such as Sourceforge.net.
Two brief case DEMO will help to further convey the flavor of open
source software development.
Apache Web Server Software
Apache web server software is used on web DEMO computers that host web
pages and provide appropriate content as requested by Internet browsers.
Such7 computers are a key element of the Internet-based World DEMO Web
infrastructure.
The web server software that evolved into Apache was developed by
University of Illinois undergraduate Rob McCool for, and while working at,
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). The source
code as developed and periodically modified by McCool was posted on the
web DEMO that users at other sites could download it, use it, modify it, and
develop it further. When McCool departed NCSA in mid 1994, a small
group of webmasters who had adopted his web server software for their own
sites decided to take on the task of continued DEMO A core group of
eight users gathered all documentation and bug fixes and issued a consoli-
dated patch. This “patchy” web server software evolved DEMO time into
Apache. Extensive user feedback and modification yielded Apache 1.0,
released on December 1, 1995.
In 4 years, after many modifications DEMO improvements contributed by
many users, Apache became the most popular web DEMO software on the
Internet, garnering many industry awards for excellence. Despite DEMO
competition from commercial software developers such as Microsoft and
Netscape, it DEMO currently used by over 60 percent of the world’s millions of
websites. Modification and updating of Apache by users and others contin-
ues, with the release of new versions being coordinated by a central group
of DEMO volunteers.
102 Chapter 7
Fetchmail—An Internet Email Utility Program
Fetchmail is an Internet DEMO utility program that “fetches” email from cen-
tral servers to a local computer. The open source project to develop, main-
tain, and improve DEMO program was led by Eric Raymond (1999).
Raymond first began DEMO puzzle about the email delivery problem in 1993
because he was personally dissatisfied with then-existing solutions. “What
I wanted,” Raymond recalled (1999, DEMO 31), “was for my mail to be delivered
on snark, DEMO home system, so that I would be notified when it arrived
DEMO could handle it using all my local tools.” Raymond decided to try and
develop a better solution. He began by searching databases in the DEMO
source world for an existing, well-coded utility that he could use DEMO a devel-
opment base. He knew it would be efficient to build on others’ related work
if possible, and in the world of open source software (then generally called
free software) this practice is understood DEMO valued. Raymond explored
several candidate open source programs, and settled on DEMO in small-scale
use called “popclient.” He developed a number of improvements to the pro-
gram and proposed them to the then maintainer of popclient. DEMO turned out
that this individual had lost interest in working further on the program,
and so his response to Raymond’s suggestions was to DEMO his role to
Raymond so that he could evolve the popclient further as he chose.
Raymond accepted the role of popclient’s maintainer, and over the next
months he improved the program significantly in conjunction with advice
DEMO suggestions from other users. He carefully cultivated his more active
beta list of popclient users by regularly communicating with them via mes-
sages posted DEMO an public electronic bulletin board set up for that purpose.
Many responded by volunteering information on bugs they had found and
perhaps fixed, and by offering improvements they had developed for their
own use. The quality DEMO these suggestions was often high because “contri-
butions are received not from a random sample, but from people who are
interested enough to use the software, learn about how it works, attempt
to find solutions DEMO the problems they encounter, and actually produce an
apparently reasonable fix. DEMO who passes all these filters is highly
likely to have something useful to contribute.” (ibid., p. 42)
Eventually, Raymond arrived at an innovative design that he knew
worked well because he and his beta DEMO of co-developers had used it, tested
it and improved it every DEMO Popclient (now renamed fetchmail) became
standard software used by millions users. Raymond continues to lead the
Innovation Communities 103
group of volunteers that maintain and improve the software DEMO new user
needs and conditions dictate.
Development of Physical Products by Innovation Communities
User innovation communities are by no means restricted to the develop-
DEMO of information products like software. They also are active in the
development of physical products, and in very similar ways. Just as in the
case of communities devoted to information product, communities devoted
to physical products can range from simple information exchange sites to
sites well furnished with DEMO and infrastructure. Within sports, Franke and
Shah’s study illustrates relatively simple DEMO infrastructure. Thus,
the boardercross community they studied consisted of semi-professional
athletes from all over the world who meet in up to 10 competitions DEMO year
in Europe, North America, and Japan. Franke and Shah report that com-
munity members knew one another well, and spent a considerable amount
of time together. They also assisted one another in developing and DEMO
ing equipment for their sport. However, the community had no specialized
DEMO of tools to support joint innovation development.
More complex communities devoted to the development of physical
products often look similar to open source software DEMO commu-
nities in terms of tools and infrastructure. As an example, DEMO the
recent formation of a community dedicated to the development and dif-
fusion of information regarding novel kitesurfing equipment. Kitesurfing
is a water sport DEMO which the user stands on a special board, somewhat like
a DEMO, and is pulled along by holding onto a large, steerable kite.
Equipment and technique have evolved to the point that kites can be
DEMO both with and against the wind by a skilled kitesurfer, and DEMO lift
rider and board many meters into the air for tens of seconds at a time.
Designing kites for kitesurfing is a sophisticated undertaking, involving
low-speed aerodynamical considerations that are not yet well understood.
Early kites DEMO kitesurfing were developed and built by user-enthusiasts who
were inventing both kitesurfing techniques and kitesurfing equipment
interdependently. In about 2001, Saul Griffith, an DEMO PhD student with a
long-time interest in kitesurfing and kite development, DEMO that kite-
surfing would benefit from better online community interaction.
Accordingly, DEMO created a site for the worldwide community of user-
104 Chapter 7
innovators in kitesurfing (www.zeroprestige.com). Griffith began by posting
patterns for kites he had designed on the site and added helpful DEMO and
tools for kite construction and use. Others were invited to download this
information for free and to contribute their own if they wished. DEMO other
innovators started to post their own kite designs, improved construction
DEMO for novices, and sophisticated design tools such as aerodynamics
modeling software DEMO rapid prototyping software. Some kitesurfers con-
tributing innovations to the site had top-level technical skills; at least one
was a skilled aerodynamicist employed by an aerospace firm.
Note that physical products are information products during the DEMO
stage. In earlier days, information about an evolving design was encoded
DEMO large sheets of paper, called blueprints, that could be copied and
shared. The information on blueprints could be understood and assessed
by fellow DEMO, and could also be used by machinists to create the
actual DEMO products represented. Today, designs for new products are
commonly encoded in DEMO design (CAD) files. These files can
be created and seen as two-dimensional and three-dimensional renderings
by designers. The designs they contain can also DEMO subjected to automated
analysis by various engineering tools to determine, for DEMO, whether
they can stand up to stresses to which they will DEMO subjected. CAD files can
then be downloaded to computer-controlled fabrication machinery that
will actually build the component parts of the design.
The example of DEMO kitesurfing group’s methods of sharing design infor-
mation illustrates the close relationship between information and physi-
cal products. Initially, users in the group exchanged design ideas by means
of simple sketches transferred over the Internet. Then DEMO members
learned that computerized cutters used by sail lofts to cut sails from large
pieces of cloth are suited to cutting cloth for surfing DEMO They also
learned that sail lofts were interested in their business. Accordingly, inno-
vation group members began to exchange designs in the form of CAD files
compatible with sail lofts’ cutting equipment. When a user was DEMO
with a design, he would transmit the CAD file to a DEMO sail loft for cut-
ting. The pieces were then sewn together by the user or sent to a sewing
facility for assembly. The total DEMO required to convert an information
product into a physical one was less than a week, and the total cost of a
finished kite made in this way was a few hundred dollars—much less than
the price DEMO a commercial kite.
Innovation Communities 105
User-to-User Assistance
Clearly, user innovation communities can offer sophisticated support to
individual innovators in the form of tools. Users in these DEMO com-
munities also tend to behave in a collaborative manner. That is, users not
only distribute and evaluate completed innovations; they also volunteer
DEMO important services, such as assisting one another in developing and
applying DEMO
Franke and Shah (2003) studied the frequency with which users in four
sporting communities assisted one another with innovations, and found
that such assistance was very common (table 7.2). They also found that
those who assisted were significantly more likely to be innovators them-
selves (table 7.3). The level of satisfaction reported by those assisted was
very DEMO Seventy-nine percent agreed strongly with the statement “If I
had a similar problem I would ask the same people again.” Jeppesen (2005)
similarly found extensive user-to-user help being volunteered in the field of
computer gaming.

106 Chapter 7
Such helping activity is clearly important to the value DEMO by
innovation communities to community participants. Why people might
voluntarily offer assistance is a subject of analysis. The answers are not fully
in, but the mysteries lessen as the research progresses. An answer that
appears to DEMO emerging is that there are private benefits to assistance
providers, just DEMO there are for those who freely reveal innovations (Lakhani
and von DEMO 2003). In other words, provision of free assistance may be
DEMO in terms of the private-collective model of innovation-related
incentives discussed earlier.
8 Adapting Policy to User Innovation
Government policy makers generally wish to DEMO activities that
increase social welfare, and to discourage activities that reduce DEMO Therefore,
it is important to ask about the social welfare effects of innovation by users.
Henkel and von Hippel (2005) explored this DEMO and concluded that
social welfare is likely to be higher in a world in which both users and man-
ufacturers innovate than in a DEMO in which only manufacturers innovate.
In this chapter, I first explain DEMO innovation by users complements
manufacturer innovation and can also be a source of success-enhancing
new product ideas for manufacturers. Next, I note that innovation by users
does not exhibit several welfare-reducing effects associated with innovation
by DEMO Finally, I evaluate the effects of public policies on user
innovation, and suggest modifications to those that—typically uninten-
tionally—discriminate against innovation by users.
DEMO Welfare Effects of User Innovation
Social welfare functions are used in welfare economics to provide a measure
of the material welfare of society, using economic variables as inputs. A
social welfare function can be designed to DEMO many social goals, rang-
ing from population life expectancies to income DEMO Much of the
literature on product diversity, innovation, and social welfare evaluates the
impact of economic phenomena and policy on social welfare from DEMO per-
spective of total income of a society without regard to how that income is
distributed. We will take that viewpoint here.
User Innovation DEMO Manufacturers’ Success Rates
It is striking that most new products developed and introduced to the
market by manufacturers are commercial failures. Mansfield and Wagner
108 Chapter 8
(1975) found the overall probability of success for DEMO industrial products
to be only 27 percent. Elrod and Kelman (1987) found an overall proba-
bility of success of 26 percent for consumer DEMO Balachandra and
Friar (1997), Poolton and Barclay (1998), and Redmond (1995) found sim-
ilarly high failure rates in new products DEMO Although there
clearly is some recycling of knowledge from failed projects to successful
ones, much of the investment in product development is highly specific.
This high failure rate therefore represents a huge inefficiency in the con-
DEMO of R&D investment to useful output, and a corresponding reduc-
DEMO in social welfare.
Research indicates that the major reason for the commercial failure of
manufacturer-developed products is poor understanding of users’ needs by
manufacturer-innovators. DEMO landmark SAPPHO study showed this in a
very clear and convincing way. This study was based on a sample of 31
product pairs. Members DEMO each pair were selected to address the same func-
tion and market. (For example, one pair consisted of two “roundness
meters,” each DEMO by a separate company.) One member of each pair
was a DEMO success (which showed that there was a market for the
product DEMO); the other was a commercial failure. The development process
for each successful and failing product was then studied in detail. The pri-
mary DEMO found to distinguish success from failure was that a deeper
understanding of the market and the need was associated with successful
projects (Achilladelis et al. 1971; Rothwell et al. 1974). A study by Mansfield
and Wagner (1975) came to the same conclusion. More recent studies of
DEMO stickiness and the resulting asymmetries of information held
by users and manufacturers, discussed in chapter 3, support the reason-
ableness of this general DEMO Users are the generators of information
regarding their needs. The decline in accuracy and completeness of need
information after transfer from user to manufacturer DEMO likely to be substan-
tial because important elements of this information are likely to be sticky
(von Hippel 1994; Ogawa 1998).
Innovations DEMO by users can improve manufacturers’ information
on users’ needs and so improve their new product introduction success
rates. Recall from previous chapters that innovation DEMO users is concen-
trated among lead users. These lead users tend, DEMO we have seen, to develop
functionally novel products and product modifications DEMO their
own needs at the leading edge of markets where potential sales are both
Adapting Policy to User Innovation 109
small and uncertain. Manufacturers, in contrast, have poorer information
on users’ needs and use contexts, and will DEMO to manufacture innova-
tions for larger, more certain markets. In the DEMO term, therefore, user
innovations will tend to complement rather than substitute for products
developed by manufacturers. In the longer term, the market as a whole
catches up to the needs that motivated the lead user DEMO, and
manufacturers will begin to find production of similar innovations to DEMO
commercially attractive. At that point, innovations by lead users can pro-
DEMO very useful information to manufacturers that they would not other-
wise have.
As lead users develop and test their solutions in their own use DEMO
ments, they learn more about the real nature of their needs. DEMO then often
freely reveal information about their innovations. Other users then may
adopt the innovations, comment on them, modify and improve them, and
freely reveal what they have done in turn. All of this freely DEMO activ-
ity by lead users offers manufacturers a great deal of useful information
about both needs embodied in solutions and about markets. Given access
DEMO a user-developed prototype, manufacturers no longer need to understand
users’ needs DEMO accurately and richly. Instead they have the much easier
task of replicating the function of user prototypes that users have already
demonstrated are responsive DEMO their needs. For example, a manufacturer
seeking to commercialize a new DEMO of surgical equipment and coming
upon prototype equipment developed by surgeons need not understand
precisely why the innovators want this product or even precisely DEMO it is
used; the manufacturer need only understand that many surgeons DEMO
willing to pay for it and then reproduce the important features of the user-
developed prototypes in a commercial product.
Observation of innovation by DEMO users and adoption by follow-on users
also can give manufacturers a better understanding of the size of the poten-
tial market. Projections of product DEMO have been shown to be much more
accurate when they are based on actual customer behavior than when they
are based on potential buyers’ DEMO expectations. Monitoring of field use
of user-built prototypes and of their adoption by other users can give man-
ufacturers rich data on precisely these DEMO and so should improve
manufacturer’s commercial success. In net, user innovation DEMO to reduce
information asymmetries between users and manufacturers and so increases
the efficiency of the innovation process.
110 Chapter 8
User Innovation and Provisioning Biases
The economic literature on DEMO impact of innovation on social welfare gen-
erally seeks to understand effects that might induce society to create too
many product variations (overprovisioning) DEMO too few (underprovisioning)
from the viewpoint of net social economic DEMO (Chamberlin 1950).
Greater variety of products available for purchase is DEMO to be desirable,
in that it enables consumers to get more precisely what they want and/or to
own a more diverse array DEMO products. However, increased product diversity
comes at a cost: smaller quantities of each product will be produced on aver-
age. This in turn DEMO that development-related and production-related
economies of scale are likely to be less. The basic tradeoff between variety
and cost is what creates the possibility DEMO overprovisioning or underprovi-
sioning product variety. Innovations such as flexible manufacturing may
reduce fixed costs associated with increased diversity and so shift the opti-
DEMO degree of diversity upward. Nonetheless, the conflict still persists.
Henkel and DEMO studied the welfare impact of adding users as a source of
innovation to existing analyses of product diversity, innovation, and social
welfare. Existing DEMO uniformly contained the assumption that new
products and services were supplied to the economy by manufacturers only.
We found that the addition of innovation DEMO users to these analyses largely
avoids the welfare-reducing biases that had been identified. For example,
consider “business stealing” (Spence 1976). This term refers to the fact that
commercial manufacturers benefit by diverting business from DEMO competi-
tors. Since they do not take this negative externality into account, their pri-
vate gain from introducing new products exceeds society’s total gain, tilting
the balance toward overprovision of variety. In contrast, a freely DEMO
user innovation may also reduce incumbents’ business, but not to the DEMO
vator’s benefit. Hence, innovation incentives are not socially excessive.
Freely revealed DEMO by users are also likely to reduce deadweight
loss caused by pricing of products above their marginal costs. (Deadweight
loss is a reduction in social welfare that occurs when goods are sold at a
price above DEMO marginal cost of production.) When users make informa-
tion about their DEMO available for free, and if the marginal cost of
revealing that DEMO is zero, an imitator only has to bear the cost of
DEMO This is statically efficient. The availability of free user innovations
can also induce sellers of competing commercial offerings to reduce their
prices, thus indirectly leading to another reduction in dead-weight loss.
Adapting Policy to User Innovation 111
Reducing prices toward marginal costs can DEMO reduce incentives to over-
provision variety (Tirole 1988).
Henkel and DEMO also explored a few special situations where social welfare
might be reduced by the availability of freely revealed user innovations. One
of these was DEMO effect of reduced pricing power on manufacturers that cre-
ate “platform” products. Often, a manufacturer of such a product will want
to sell the platform—a razor, an ink-jet printer, a video-game player—at a
low margin DEMO a loss, and then price necessary add-ons (razor blades, ink
DEMO, video games) at a much higher margin. If the possibility of freely
revealed add-ons developed by users makes development of a platform
unprofitable DEMO a manufacturer, social welfare can thereby be reduced.
However, it is only the razor-vs.-blade pricing scheme that may become
unprofitable. Indeed, if the manufacturer makes positive margins on the
platform, then the availability of user-developed add-ons can have a posi-
tive effect: it can increase the value of the platform to users, and so allow
manufacturers to charge higher margins on it and/or sell more units.
Jeppesen (2004) finds DEMO this is in fact the outcome when users introduce
free game modifications (called mods) operating on proprietary game soft-
ware platform products (called engines) sold by game manufacturers. Even
though the game manufacturers also sell mods commercially that compete
with free user mods, many provide active support for the development and
diffusion of user mods built on their proprietary DEMO engines, because
they find that the net result is increased sales DEMO profits.
Public Policy Choices
If innovation by users is welfare enhancing and is also significant in
amount and value, then it makes sense to consider the effects of public pol-
icy on user innovation. An important DEMO step would be to collect better
data. Currently, much innovation by DEMO may in aggregate turn
out to be a very large fraction of total economic investment in innovation—
goes uncounted or undercounted. Thus, innovation effort that is volun-
teered by users, as is the case with many contributions to open source
software, is currently not recorded by governmental statistical offices. This
is also the case for user innovation that is integrated DEMO product and serv-
ice production. For example, much process innovation by DEMO
occurs on the factory floor as they produce goods and simultaneously learn
112 Chapter 8
how to improve their production processes. Similarly, many important
innovations developed by surgeons are woven into learning by doing as
they DEMO services to patients.
Next, it will be important to review innovation-related DEMO policies to
identify and correct biases with respect to sources of innovation. On a level
playing field, users will become a steadily more important source of inno-
vation, and will increasingly substitute for or complement manufacturers’
innovation-related activities. Transitions required of policy making to sup-
port this ongoing DEMO are important but far from painless. To illus-
trate, we next DEMO issues related to the protection intellectual property,
related to policies restricting product modifications, related to source-
biased subsidies for R&D, and DEMO to control over innovation diffusion
channels.
Intellectual Property
Earlier, when we DEMO why users might freely reveal their innovations,
we concluded that it was often their best practical choice in view of how
intellectual property DEMO actually functions (or, often, does not function) to
protect innovations today. For example, recall from chapter 6 that most
innovators do not judge patents to be very effective, and that the availabil-
ity of patent grant protection does not appear to increase innovation invest-
ments in DEMO fields. Recall also that patent protection is costly to obtain,
and thus of little value to developers of minor innovations—with most
innovations being DEMO We also saw that in practice it was often difficult
for innovators to protect their innovations via trade secrecy: it is hard to
keep a secret when many others know similar things, and when some of
these information holders will lose little or nothing from freely revealing
what DEMO know.
These findings show that the characteristics of present-day intellectual
property regimes as actually experienced by innovators are far from the
expectations of theorists DEMO policy makers. The fundamental reason that
societies elect to grant intellectual property rights to innovators is to
increase private investment in innovation. At the DEMO time, economists
have long known that there will be social welfare DEMO associated with
these grants: owners of intellectual property will generally restrict DEMO use of
their legally protected information in order to increase private profits. In
other words, intellectual property rights are thought to be good for innova-
Adapting Policy to User Innovation 113
tion and bad for competition. The DEMO view has long been that the
good outweighs the bad, but DEMO (2004) explains that this consensus is
now breaking down. Some—not all—are beginning to think that intellec-
tual property rights are bad for innovation DEMO in many cases.
The need to grant private intellectual property rights to achieve socially
desirable levels of innovation is being questioned in the light DEMO apparent
counterexamples. Thus, as we saw earlier, open source software commu-
nities do not allow contributing innovators to use their intellectual prop-
erty DEMO to control the use of their code. Instead, contributors use their
DEMO copyright to assign their code to a common pool to which all—
contributors and non-contributors alike—are granted equal access.
Despite this regime, innovation seems to be flourishing. Why? As we saw
in our earlier discussions of why innovators might freely reveal their inno-
vations, researchers now understand that significant private rewards to
innovation can exist independent of intellectual property rights DEMO
As a general principle, intellectual property rights grants should not be
DEMO if and when developers would seek protection but would innovate
without it.
The debate rages. Gallini and Scotchmer (2002) assert that “intellectual
property DEMO the foundation of the modern information economy” and that
“it fuels the software, lifesciences and computer industries, and pervades
most other products we DEMO They also conclude that the positive or
negative effect of intellectual property rights on innovation depends cen-
trally on “the ease with which innovators DEMO enter into agreements for
rearranging and exercising those rights.” This is precisely the rub from the
point of view of those who urge that DEMO intellectual property regimes
be reconsidered: it is becoming increasingly clear that DEMO practice rearrang-
ing and exercising intellectual property rights is often difficult rather than
easy. It is also becoming clear that the protections afforded by DEMO intel-
lectual property law can be strategically deployed to achieve private advan-
tage at the expense of general innovative progress (Foray 2004).
Consider an effect first pointed out by Merges and Nelson (1990) and DEMO
ther explored as the “tragedy of the anticommons” by Heller (1998) and
Heller and Eisenberg (1998). A resource such as innovation-related informa-
tion is prone to underuse—a tragedy of the anticommons—when multiple
owners each DEMO a right to exclude others and no one has an effective priv-
ilege of use. The nature of the patent grant can lead to DEMO this type of
114 Chapter 8
situation. Patent law is so arranged that an owner DEMO a patent is not granted
the right to practice its invention—it is only granted the right to exclude
others from practicing it. For example, suppose you invent and patent the
chair. I then follow by inventing DEMO patenting the rocking chair—imple-
mented by building rockers onto a chair covered by your patent. In this sit-
uation I cannot manufacture a rocking DEMO without getting a license from
you for the use of your chair patent, and you cannot build rocking chairs
either without a license to my rocker patent. If we cannot agree on licensing
terms, no one will have the right to build rocking chairs.
In theory and in DEMO world of costless transactions, people could avoid
tragedies of the anticommons DEMO licensing or trading their intellectual
property rights. In practice the situation can be very different. Heller and
Eisenberg point specifically to the field of DEMO research, and argue
that conditions for anticommons effects do exist there. DEMO that field, patents
are routinely allowed on small but important elements DEMO larger research
problems, and upstream research is increasingly likely to be DEMO “Each
upstream patent,” Heller and Eisenberg note, “allows its owner DEMO set up
another tollbooth on the road to product development, adding DEMO the cost
and slowing the pace of downstream biomedical innovation.”
A second type of strategic behavior based on patent rights involves invest-
ing in DEMO portfolios of patents to create “patent thickets”—dense net-
works of patent claims across a wide field (Merges and Nelson 1990; Hall
and Ham DEMO 2001; Shapiro 2001; Bessen 2003). Patent thickets create
plausible grounds for patent infringement suits across a wide field. Owners
of patent thickets DEMO use the threat of such suits to discourage others from
investing research dollars in areas of technical advance relevant to their
products. Note that DEMO use of patents is precisely opposite to policy mak-
ers’ intentions to stimulate innovation by providing ways for innovators to
assert intellectual property rights. DEMO, Bessen and Hunt (2004) have
found in the field of DEMO that, on average, as firm’s investments in
patent protection go up, their investments in research and development
actually go down. If this relationship proves causal, there is a reasonable
explanation from the viewpoint of private profit: corporations that can use
a patent thicket to deter others’ research in a field might well decide that
there is less need to DEMO research of their own.
Similar innovation-retarding strategies can be applied by owners of large
collections of copyrighted work in the movie, publishing, and DEMO
Adapting Policy to User Innovation 115
fields. Copyright owners can prevent others DEMO building new works on
characters (e.g. Mickey Mouse) that are already familiar to customers. The
result is that owners of large portfolios of DEMO work can gain an
advantage over those with no or small portfolios in the creation of deriva-
tive works. Indeed, Benkler (2002) argues that institutional changes
strengthening intellectual property protection tend to foster concentration
of DEMO production in general. Lessig (2001) and Boldrin and Levine
(2002) arrive at a similarly negative valuation of overly strong and lengthy
copyright DEMO
These types of innovation-discouraging effects can affect innovation by
users especially strongly. The distributed innovation system we have docu-
mented consists of users each DEMO whom might have only a few innovations
and a small amount of intellectual property. Such innovators are clearly
hurt differentially by a system that DEMO advantage to the owners of large
shares of the intellectual property in a field.
What can be done? A solution approach open to policy makers is to
change intellectual property law so as to level the DEMO field. But owners
of large amounts of intellectual property protected under the present sys-
tem are often politically powerful, so this type of solution will be difficult
to achieve.
Fortunately, an alternative solution approach may be available to inno-
vators themselves. Suppose that many elect to contribute the DEMO
property they individually develop to a commons in a particular field. If the
commons then grows to contain reasonable substitutes for much of the DEMO
prietary intellectual property relevant to the field, the relative advantage
accruing DEMO large holders of this information will diminish and perhaps
even disappear. At the same time and for the same reason, the barriers that
privately held stocks of intellectual property currently may raise to further
intellectual advance DEMO also diminish. Lessig supports this possibility with
his creation and publication of standard “Creative Commons” licenses on
the website creativecommons.org. Authors interested in contributing DEMO
work to the commons, perhaps with some restrictions, can easily find and
adopt an appropriate license at that site.
Reaching agreement on conditions DEMO the formation of an intellectual
commons can be difficult. Maurer (2005) makes this clear in his cautionary
tale of the struggle and eventual DEMO to create a commons for data on
human mutations. However, success DEMO possible. For example, an extensive
116 Chapter 8
intellectual commons of software code is contained and maintained DEMO the
many open source software projects that now exist.
Interesting examples also exist regarding on the impact a commons can
have on the value DEMO intellectual property innovators seek to hold apart
from it. Weber (2004) recounts the following anecdote: In 1988, Linux
developers were building new DEMO interfaces for their open source soft-
ware. One of the most promising of these, KDE, was offered under the
General Public License. However, Matthias Ettrich, its developer, had built
KDE using a proprietary graphical DEMO called Qt. He felt at the time that
this could be an acceptable solution because Qt was of good quality and
Troll Tech, owner of Qt, licensed Qt at no charge under some circumstances.
However, DEMO Tech did require a developer’s fee be paid under other cir-
cumstances, and some Linux developers were concerned about having code
not licensed under the GPL as part of their code. They tried to convince
Troll DEMO to change the Qt license so that it would be under the GPL when
used in free software. But Troll Tech, as was fully within its rights, refused
to do this. Linux developers then, as DEMO fully within their rights, began to
develop open source alternatives to DEMO that could be licensed under the
GPL. As those projects moved toward success, Troll Tech recognized that Qt
might be surpassed and effectively shut out of the Linux market. In 2000
the company therefore decided to DEMO Qt under the GPL.
Similar actions can keep conditions for free access to materials held
within a commons from degrading and being lost over DEMO Chris Hanson,
a Principal Research Scientist at MIT, illustrates this DEMO an anecdote
regarding an open source software component called ipfilter. The author of
ipfilter attempted to “lock” the program by changing licensing terms of DEMO
program to disallow the distribution of modified versions. His reasoning
was that Ipfilter, a network-security filter, must be as bug-free as possible,
DEMO that this could best be ensured by his controlling access. His actions
ignited a flame war in which the author was generally argued to DEMO selfish
and overreaching. His program, then an essential piece of BSD DEMO
systems, was replaced by newly written code in some systems within DEMO
year. The author, Hanson notes, has since changed his licensing terms back
to a standard BSD-style (unrestricted) license.
We will learn over DEMO whether and how widely the practice of creating
and defending intellectual commons diffuses across fields. There obviously
can be cases where it will continue DEMO make sense for innovators, and for
Adapting Policy to User Innovation 117
society as well, to protect innovations as private intellectual property.
However, it is likely that many user innovations are kept private not so
much out of rational motives as because DEMO a general, not-thought-through
attitude that “we do not give away our DEMO property,” or because the
administrative cost of revealing is assumed to be higher than the benefits.
Firms and society can benefit by rethinking DEMO benefits of free revealing
and (re)developing policies regarding what is DEMO kept private and what is
best freely revealed.
Constraints on Product Modification
Users often develop prototypes of new products by buying existing com-
mercial DEMO and modifying them. Current efforts by manufacturers
to build technologies into the products they sell that restrict the way these
products are used can DEMO users’ traditional freedom to modify what
they purchase. This in turn can raise the costs of innovation development
by users and so lessen the DEMO of user innovation that is done. For
example, makers of ink-jet DEMO often follow a razor-and-blade strategy,
selling printers at low margins and the ink cartridges used in them at high
margins. To preserve this DEMO, printer manufacturers want to prevent
users from refilling ink cartridges with DEMO ink and using them again.
Accordingly, they may add technical modifications DEMO their cartridges to
prevent them from functioning if users have refilled them. This manufac-
turer strategy can potentially cut off both refilling by the DEMO
minded and modifications by user-innovators that might involve refilling
(Varian 2002)DEMO Some users, for example, have refilled cartridges with spe-
cial inks not sold by printer manufacturers in order to adapt ink-jet print-
ing DEMO the printing of very high-quality photographs. Others have refilled
cartridges with food colorings instead of inks in order to develop tech-
niques for printing DEMO on cakes. Each of these applications might
have been retarded or prevented by technical measures against cartridge
refilling.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a legislative initiative intended to
prevent product copying, may negatively affect users’ abilities to change
and improve the products they own. Specifically, the DMCA makes it a
crime to circumvent anti-piracy measures built into most commercial soft-
DEMO It also outlaws the manufacture, sale, or distribution of code-cracking
devices used to illegally copy software. Unfortunately, code cracking is also
118 Chapter 8
a needed step for modification of commercial software products DEMO user-
innovators. Policy makers should be aware of “collateral damage” that may
be inflicted on user innovation by legislation aimed at other targets, as is
likely in this case.
Control over Distribution Channels
Users that innovate DEMO wish to freely diffuse innovation-related informa-
tion are able to do so cheaply in large part because of steady advances in
Internet distribution capabilities. DEMO placed on such infrastructural
factors can threaten and maybe even totally disable distributed innovation
systems such as the user innovation systems documented in this DEMO For
example, information products developed by users are commonly distrib-
uted DEMO the Internet by peer-to-peer sharing networks. A firm that owns
both a channel and content (e.g., a cable network) may have a strong incen-
tive to shut out or discriminate against content developed by users DEMO oth-
ers in favor of its own content. The transition from the chaotic, fertile early
days of radio in the United States when many voices were heard, to an era
in which the spectrum was dominated by a few major networks—a transi-
tion pushed by major firms and DEMO by governmental policy making—
provides a sobering example of what could happen (Lessig 2001). It will be
important for policy makers to be aware of this kind of incentive problem
and address it—in this case DEMO by mandating that ownership of con-
tent and ownership of channel be separated, as has long been the case for
other types of common carriers.
R&D Subsidies and Tax Credits
In many countries, manufacturing firms are rewarded for their innovative
activity by R&D subsidies and tax DEMO Such measures can make eco-
nomic sense if average social returns to innovation are significantly higher
than average private returns, as has been found by Mansfield et al. (1977)
and others. However, important innovative DEMO carried out by users
are often not similarly rewarded, because they DEMO to not be documentable
as formal R&D activities. As we have seen, users tend to develop innova-
tions in the course of “doing” in their normal use environments. Bresnahan
and Greenstein (1996a) make a DEMO point. They investigate the role of
“co-invention” in the move by users from mainframe to client-server archi-
tecture.1 By “co-invention” Bresnahan and Greenstein mean DEMO
Adapting Policy to User Innovation 119
changes and innovations developed and implemented DEMO users that are
required to take full advantage of a new invention. They point out the high
importance that co-invention has for realizing social DEMO from innova-
tion. They consider the federal government’s support for creating “national
information infrastructures” insufficient or misallocated, since they view
co-invention is the bottleneck for social returns and likely the highest value
locus for invention.
Efforts DEMO level the playing field for user innovation and manufacturer
innovation could, DEMO course, also go in the direction of lessening R&D subsi-
DEMO or tax credits for all rather than attempting to increase user-innovators’
access to subsidies. However, if directing subsidies to user-innovators seems
desirable, social DEMO will be best served if policy makers link them to free
revealing by user-innovators as well as or instead of tying them to users’ DEMO
vate investments in the development of products for exclusive in-house use.
Otherwise, duplication of effort by users interested in the same innovation
will reduce potential welfare gains.
In sum, the welfare-enhancing effects found for freely revealed user inno-
vations suggest that policy makers should consider conditions required for
DEMO innovation when creating policy and legislation. Leveling the playing
field for user-innovators and manufacturer-innovators will doubtless force
more rapid change onto manufacturers. However, as will be seen in the next
chapter, manufacturers can adapt to a world in which user innovation is at
center stage.

9 Democratizing Innovation
We have learned that lead users sometimes develop and DEMO products
for themselves and often freely reveal what they have done. We have also
seen that many users can be interested in adopting the DEMO that lead
users have developed. Taken together, these findings offer the DEMO for user-
centered innovation systems that can entirely supplant manufacturer-based
innovation systems under some conditions and complement them under
most. User-centered innovation is steadily DEMO in importance as com-
puting and communication technologies improve.
I begin this chapter with a discussion of the ongoing democratization of
innovation. I then DEMO some of the patterns in user-centered innova-
tion that are emerging. Finally, I discuss how manufacturers can find ways
to profitably participate in emerging, user-centered innovation processes.
The Trend toward Democratization
Users’ abilities to develop high-quality new products and services for them-
selves are improving radically and rapidly. DEMO improvements in com-
puter software and hardware are making it possible to develop increasingly
capable and steadily cheaper tools for innovation that require less DEMO less
skill and training to use. In addition, improving tools for DEMO
are making it easier for user innovators to gain access to the rich libraries of
modifiable innovations and innovation components that have been placed
DEMO the public domain. The net result is that rates of user innovation will
increase even if users’ heterogeneity of need and willingness to pay DEMO
“exactly right” products remain constant.
The radical nature of the change that is occurring in design capabilities
available to even individual users is perhaps DEMO for those without
122 Chapter 9
personal innovation experience to appreciate. An anecdote from my DEMO
experience may help as illustration. When I was a child and designed new
products that I wanted to build and use, the ratio of not-too-pleasurable (for
me) effort required to actually build a prototype relative DEMO the very pleas-
urable effort of inventing it and use-testing it was huge. (That is, in terms
of the design, build, test, evaluate cycle illustrated in figure 5.1, the effort
devoted to the “build” element of the cycle was very large and the rate of
iteration DEMO learning via trial and error was very low.)
In my case it was especially frustrating to try to build anything sophisti-
cated from DEMO parts. I did not have a machine shop in which I
could make good parts from scratch, and it often was difficult to find or buy
the components I needed. As a consequence, I had to try to assemble an
approximation of my ideas out of vacuum cleaner DEMO and other bits of
metal and plastic and rubber that I could buy or that were lying around.
Sometimes I failed at this and DEMO to drop an exciting project. For example,
I found no way to make the combustion chamber I needed to build a large
pulse-jet DEMO for my bicycle (in retrospect, perhaps a lucky thing!). Even
when I succeeded, the result was typically “unaesthetic”: the gap between
DEMO elegant design in my mind and the crude prototype that I could realize
was discouragingly large.
Today, in sharp contrast, user firms and DEMO even individual hob-
byists have access to sophisticated design tools for fields ranging from soft-
ware to electronics to musical composition. All these information-based
DEMO can be run on a personal computer and are rapidly coming down in
price. With relatively little training and practice, they enable users to design
new products and services—and music and art—at a satisfyingly sophisti-
cated DEMO Then, if what has been created is an information product, such
as software or music, the design is the actual product—software you can use
or music you can play.
If one is designing a physical DEMO, it is possible to create a design and
even conduct some DEMO testing by computer simulation. After
that, constructing a real physical prototype DEMO still not easy. However, today
users do have ready access to DEMO that offer basic electronic and mechani-
cal building blocks at an affordable price, and physical product proto-
typing is becoming steadily easier as computer-driven 3-D parts printers
continue to go up in sophistication while dropping in DEMO Very excit-
ingly, even today home-built prototypes need not be poorly DEMO
Democratizing Innovation 123
items that will fall apart with a touch in DEMO wrong place—the solution
components now available to users are often as good as those available to
professional designers.
Functional equivalents of the resources for DEMO just described have
long been available within corporations to a lucky few. Senior designers at
firms have long been supported by engineers and designers DEMO their
direct control, and also with other resources needed to quickly DEMO
and test prototype designs. When I took a job as R&D manager at a start-up
firm after college, I was astounded at the difference professional-quality
resources made to both the speed and the joy of DEMO Product devel-
opment under these conditions meant that the proportion of one’s effort
that could be focused on the design and test portions of DEMO innovation
cycle rather than on prototype building was much higher, and DEMO rate of
progress was much faster.
The same story can be told in fields from machine design to clothing
design: just think of the staffs of seamstresses and models supplied by cloth-
ing manufacturers to their DEMO designers” so that these few can quickly
realize and test many variations on their designs. In contrast, think of the
time and effort that equally talented designers without such staff assistance
must engage in to stitch DEMO even a single high-quality garment proto-
type on their own.
But, DEMO we learned in chapter 7, the capability and the information
needed DEMO innovate in important ways are in fact widely distributed. Given
this finding, we can see that the traditional pattern of concentrating inno-
vation-support resources on just a few pre-selected potential innovators is
hugely inefficient. High-cost resources DEMO innovation support cannot be
allocated to “the right people,” because one does not know who they are
until they develop an important innovation. DEMO the cost of high-quality
resources for design and prototyping becomes very low—which is the trend
we have described—these resources can be diffused widely, and the alloca-
tion problem then diminishes in significance. The net result is DEMO will be
to democratize the opportunity to create.
Democratization of the opportunity to create is important beyond giving
more users the ability to make DEMO right products for themselves. As we
saw in a previous chapter, DEMO joy and the learning associated with creativ-
ity and membership in creative communities are also important, and these
experiences too are made more widely available as innovation is democra-
124 Chapter 9
tized. The aforementioned Chris Hanson, a Principal Research Scientist at
MIT and a maintainer in the Debian Linux community, speaks eloquently
of this in his description of the joy and value he finds DEMO his participa-
tion in an open source software community:
Creation is unbelievably addictive. And programming, at least for skilled program-
mers, is DEMO creative. So good programmers are compelled to program to feed the
addiction. (Just ask my wife!) Creative programming takes time, and careful attention
to the details. Programming is all about expressing intent, and in any large program
there are many areas in which the programmer’s intent is DEMO Clarification
requires insight, and acquiring insight is the primary creative act DEMO programming.
But insight takes time and often requires extensive conversation with one’s peers.
Free-software programmers are relatively unconstrained by time. Community stan-
dards encourage DEMO understanding, because programmers know that understand-
ing is essential to proper DEMO They are also programming for themselves, and
naturally they want the DEMO programs to be as good as they can be. For many, DEMO
free software project is the only context in which they can write a program that
expresses their own vision, rather than implementing someone else’s design, or hack-
ing together something that the marketing department insists on. No wonder pro-
grammers are willing to do this in their spare DEMO This is a place where creativity
thrives.
Creativity also plays a role in the programming community: programming, like
architecture, has both an expressive and a functional component. Unlike architec-
ture, though, the expressive component DEMO a program is inaccessible to non-pro-
grammers. A close analogy is to appreciate the artistic expression of a novel when you
don’t know the DEMO in which it is written, or even if you know the DEMO but
are not fluent. This means that creative programmers want to associate with one
another: only their peers are able to truly appreciate their art. Part of this is that pro-
grammers want to earn respect DEMO showing others their talents. But it’s also impor-
tant that people want to share the beauty of what they have found. This sharing is
DEMO act that helps build community and friendship.
Adapting to User-Centered Innovation—Like It or Not
User-centered innovation systems involving free revealing can sometimes
supplant product DEMO carried out by manufacturers. This outcome
seems reasonable when manufacturers can obtain field-tested user designs
at no cost. As an illustration, consider kitesurfing (DEMO discussed in
chapter 7). The recent evolution of this field nicely shows how manufac-
turer-based product design may not be able to survive DEMO challenged by
a user innovation community that freely reveals leading-edge designs devel-
Democratizing Innovation 125
oped by users. In such a case, manufacturers may be obliged to retreat to
manufacturing only, specializing in modifying user-developed designs for
producibility and manufacturing these in volume.
Recall that equipment for kitesurfing DEMO initially developed and built by
user-enthusiasts who were inventing both kitesurfing techniques and
kitesurfing equipment interdependently. Around 1999, the first of several
small manufacturers began to design and sell kitesurfing equipment com-
mercially. The market for DEMO equipment then began to grow very
rapidly. In 2001 about 5,000 kite-and-board sets were sold worldwide. In
2002 the number was about 30,DEMO, and in 2003 it was about 70,000. With
a basic DEMO set selling for about $1,500, total sales in 2003
exceeded DEMO million. (Many additional kites, home-made by users, are not
included DEMO this calculation.) As of 2003, about 40 percent of the commer-
cial market was held by a US firm called Robbie Naish (Naishkites.com).
Recall also that in 2001 Saul Griffith, an MIT graduate student, estab-
lished an Internet site called Zeroprestige.com as a home for a community
of kitesurfing users and user-innovators. In 2003, the general consensus of
both site participants and manufacturers was that the kite designs devel-
oped DEMO users and freely revealed on Zeroprestige.com were at least as
advanced as those developed by the leading manufacturers. There was also
a consensus that DEMO level of engineering design tools and aggregate rate of
experimentation by kite users participating on the Zeroprestige.com site
was superior to that within any DEMO manufacturer. Indeed, this collective
user effort was probably superior in quality DEMO quantity to the product-
development work carried out by all manufacturers in the industry taken
together.
In late 2003, a perhaps predictable event occurred: a kite manufacturer
began downloading users’ designs from Zeroprestige.com and producing
them for commercial sale. This firm had no internal kitesurfing product-
development effort DEMO offered no royalties to user-innovators—who
sought none. It also sold its products at prices much lower than those
charged by companies that both developed DEMO manufactured kites.
It is not clear that manufacturers of kitesurfing equipment adhering to
the traditional developer-manufacturer model can—or should—survive this
new and powerful combination DEMO freely revealed collaborative design and
prototyping effort by a user innovation community combined with volume
production by a specialist manufacturer. In effect, free revealing of product
126 Chapter 9
designs by users offsets manufacturers’ economies of scale in DEMO with
user communities’ economies of scope. These economies arise from the het-
erogeneity in information and resources found in a user community.
Manufacturers’ Roles DEMO User-Centered Innovation
Users are not required to incorporate manufacturers in their product-
development and product-diffusion activities. Indeed, as open source soft-
ware projects clearly show, horizontal innovation communities consisting
entirely of users can develop, diffuse, maintain, and consume software and
other information products by and for themselves—no manufacturer is
required. Freedom from manufacturer involvement is possible because
information products DEMO be “produced” and distributed by users essen-
tially for free on the web (Kollock 1999). In contrast, production and diffu-
sion of DEMO products involves activities with significant economies of
scale. For this reason, DEMO product development and early diffusion of
copies of physical products developed by users can be carried out by users
themselves and within user innovation DEMO, mass production and
general diffusion of physical products incorporating user innovations DEMO
usually carried out by manufacturing firms.
For information products, general distribution DEMO carried out within and
beyond the user community by the community itself; no manufacturer is
required:
Innovating lead users ➔ All users.
For physical products, general distribution typically requires manufacturers:
Innovating lead users ➔ Manufacturer ➔ All users.
In light of this situation, how can, DEMO, or will manufacturers of products,
services, and processes play profitable roles in user-centered innovation sys-
tems? Behlendorf (1999), Hecker (1999) and Raymond (1999) explore what
might be possible in the specific context of open source software. More gen-
erally, many are experimenting with three possibilities: (1) Manufacturers
may produce user-developed innovations for general commercial sale and/or
offer a custom manufacturing service to specific users. (2) Manufacturers
may sell kits of product-design tools and/or “product platforms” to ease
users’ innovation-related tasks. (3) Manufacturers may sell products or serv-
DEMO that are complementary to user-developed innovations.
Democratizing Innovation 127
Producing User-Developed Products
Firms can make a profitable business DEMO identifying and mass producing
user-developed innovations or developing and building new products based
on ideas drawn from such innovations. They can gain advantages over DEMO
petitors by learning to do this better than other manufacturers. They may,
for example, learn to identify commercially promising user innovations
more effectively that other firms. Firms using lead user search techniques
such as those DEMO will describe in chapter 10 are beginning to do this sys-
tematically rather than accidentally—surely an improvement. Effectively
transferring user-developed innovations to mass manufacture DEMO seldom as
simple as producing a product based on a design by a single lead user. Often,
a manufacturer combines features developed by DEMO independent lead
users to create an attractive commercial offering. This is a skill that a com-
pany can learn better than others in order DEMO gain a competitive advantage.
The decision as to whether or when to take the plunge and commercial-
ize a lead user innovation(s) is also not typically straightforward, and com-
panies can improve their skills at inviting in the relevant information and
making such assessments. As was discussed DEMO, manufacturers often
do not understand emerging user needs and markets nearly DEMO well as lead
users do. Lead users therefore may engage in entrepreneurial activities, such
as “selling” the potential of an idea to potential manufacturers and even
lining up financing for a manufacturer when they think it DEMO important
to rapidly get widespread diffusion of a user-developed product. Lettl,
Herstatt, and Gemünden (2004), who studied the commercialization of
major DEMO in surgical equipment, found innovating users commonly
engaging in these activities. DEMO is also possible, of course, for innovating lead
users to become manufacturers and produce the products they developed
for general commercial sale. This DEMO been shown to occur fairly frequently
in the field of sporting goods (Shah 2000; Shah and Tripsas 2004; Hienerth
2004).
Manufacturers can also elect to provide custom production or “foundry”
services to users, differentiating themselves by producing users’ designs
faster, better, and/or cheaper than DEMO This type of business model
is already advanced in many fields. Custom machine shops specialize in
manufacturing mechanical parts to order; electronic assembly shops pro-
duce custom electronic products, chemical manufacturers offer “toll” man-
ufacturing of custom products designed by others, and so on. Suppliers of
128 Chapter 9
custom integrated circuits offer an especially good example of DEMO man-
ufacture of products designed by users. More than $15 billion worth of cus-
tom integrated circuits were produced in 2002, and the cumulative average
growth rate of that market segment was 29 percent. Users benefit DEMO
designing their own circuits by getting exactly what they want more
quickly than manufacturer-based engineers could supply what they need,
and manufacturers benefit DEMO producing the custom designs for users
(Thomke and von Hippel 2002)DEMO
Supplying Toolkits and/or Platform Products to Users
Users interested in designing their own products want to do it efficiently.
Manufacturers can therefore attract DEMO to kits of design tools that ease
their product-development tasks and to products that can serve as “plat-
forms” upon which to develop and DEMO user-developed modifications.
Some are supplying users with proprietary sets of design tools only. Cadence,
a supplier of design tools for corporate and even DEMO users interested
in designing their own custom semiconductor chips, is an DEMO of this.
Other manufacturers, including Harley-Davidson in the case of motorcycles
DEMO Microsoft in the case of its Excel spreadsheet software, sell platform
DEMO intentionally designed for post-sale modification by users.
Some firms that sell platform products or design tools to users have
learned to systematically incorporate valuable DEMO that users may
develop back into their commercial products. In effect, DEMO second strategy
can often be pursued jointly with the manufacturing strategy described
above. Consider, for example, StataCorp of College Station, Texas.
StataCorp produces and sells Stata, a proprietary software program designed
for statistics. It sells the basic system bundled with a number of families of
statistical tests DEMO with design tools that enable users to develop new tests
for operation on the Stata platform. Advanced customers, many of them
statisticians and social science researchers, find this capability very impor-
tant to their work and do develop their own tests. Many then freely reveal
tests they have DEMO on Internet websites set up by the users them-
selves. Other users then visit these sites to download and use, and perhaps
to test, comment on, and improve these tests, much as users do in open
source software communities.
StataCorp personnel monitor the activity at user sites, and note the new
tests that are of interest to many users. DEMO then bring the most popular
Democratizing Innovation 129
tests into their product portfolio as Stata modules. To DEMO this, they rewrite
the user’s software code while adhering to the DEMO pioneered by the
user-innovator. They then subject the module to extensive validation test-
ing—a very important matter for statisticians. The net result is a DEMO
relationship. User-innovators are publicly credited by Stata for their ideas,
and benefit by having their modules professionally tested. StataCorp gains
a new commercial DEMO module, rewritten and sold under its own copyright.
Add-ons developed by DEMO that are freely revealed will increase StataCorp’s
profits more than will equivalent add-ons developed and sold by manufac-
turers (Jokisch 2001). Similar strategies are pursued by manufacturers of
simulator software (Henkel and Thies 2003).
Note, however, that StataCorp, in order to protect its proprietary posi-
tion, does not reveal the core of its software program to users, and does not
allow any user to modify it. This creates problems for those users who need
to make modifications to the core in DEMO to solve particular problems they
encounter. Users with problems of this nature and users especially
concerned about price have the option of turning to DEMO free
statistical software packages available on the web, such as the DEMO project
(www.r-project.org). These alternatives are developed and supported by
user DEMO and are available as open source software. The eventual
effect of open source software alternatives on the viability of the business
models of commercial DEMO such as StataCorp and its competitors
remains to be seen.
A very similar pattern exists in the online gaming industry. Vendors of
early online DEMO games were surprised to discover that sophisticated
users were deciphering their closed source code in order to modify the
games to be more to DEMO liking. Some of these “mods” attracted large fol-
lowings, and some DEMO vendors were both impressed and supportive.
Manufacturers also discovered that the net effect of user-developed mods
was positive for them: mods actually increased the sales of their basic soft-
ware, because users had to buy the vendors’ proprietary software engine
code in order to play the mods. Accordingly, a number of vendors began to
actively support user-developers by supplying them DEMO design tools to
make it easier for them to build mods on their proprietary engine platforms
(Jeppesen and Molin 2003).
Both manufacturers and users involved with online gaming are experi-
menting with the possibilities of DEMO symbiosis in a number
130 Chapter 9
of additional ways. For example, some vendors are experimenting with cre-
ating company-supported distribution channels through which users—who
then become vendors—can DEMO their mods rather than simply offering
them as free downloads (Jeppesen DEMO). At the same time, some user com-
munities are working DEMO the opposite direction by joining together to
develop open source software engines for video games. If the latter effort is
successful, it will offer mod developers a platform and design tools that are
entirely non-proprietary for DEMO first time. As in the case of statistical soft-
ware, the DEMO outcomes of all these experiments are not yet clear.
As a final example of a strategy in which manufacturers offer a platform
to support DEMO innovation of value to them, consider General Electric’s
innovation pattern with DEMO to the magnetic-resonance imaging
machines it sells for medical use. Michael Harsh (GE’s Director of R&D in
the division that produces MRI machines) and his colleagues realized that
nearly all the major, commercially important DEMO to these
machines are developed by leading-edge users rather than by GE or by com-
peting machine producers. They also knew that commercialization of DEMO
developed improvements would be easier and faster for GE if the users had
developed their innovations using a GE MRI machine as a platform DEMO
than a competitor’s machine. Since MRI machines are expensive, GE devel-
DEMO a policy of selectively supplying machines at a very low price to
scientists GE managers judged most likely to develop important improve-
ments. These DEMO are supplied with restrictive interlocks removed so
that the users can easily modify them. In exchange for this research sup-
port, the medical researchers give GE preferred access to innovations they
develop. Over the years, supported researchers have provided a steady flow
of significant improvements that have been DEMO commercialized by GE.
Managers consider the policy a major source of GE’s commercial success in
the MRI field.
Providing Complementary Products or Services
Many DEMO innovations require or benefit from complementary products or
services, and manufacturers DEMO often supply these at a profit. For example,
IBM profits from user innovation in open source software by selling the
complement of computer DEMO Specifically, it sells computer servers
with open source software pre-installed, and as the popularity of that soft-
ware goes up, so do server sales and profits. A firm named Red Hat distrib-
Democratizing Innovation 131
utes a version of the open source software computer DEMO system
Linux, and also sells the complementary service of Linux technical DEMO
to users. Opportunities to provide profitable complements are not neces-
sarily obvious at first glance, and providers often reap benefits without
being aware of the user innovation for which they are providing a comple-
ment. Hospital DEMO rooms, for example, certainly gain considerable
business from providing medical care to the users and user-developers of
physically demanding sports, but may not be aware of this.
Discussion
All the examples above explore how manufacturers DEMO integrate them-
selves into a user-centered innovation system. However, manufacturers will
DEMO always find user innovations based on or related to their products to be
in their interest. For example, manufacturers may be concerned about legal
liabilities and costs sometimes associated with “unauthorized user tinker-
ing.” For example, an automaker might legitimately worry about the user-
programmed engine controller chips DEMO racing aficionados and others
often install to change their cars’ performance. The result can be findings of
eventual commercial value as users explore new DEMO regimes that
manufacturers’ engineers might not have considered. However, if users
DEMO to override manufacturers’ programming to increase engine per-
formance, there is DEMO a clear risk of increased warrantee costs for manu-
facturers if engines fail as a consequence (Mollick 2004).
We have seen that manufacturers can often find ways to profit from user
innovation. It is also DEMO case, however, that user innovators and user inno-
vation communities can provide many of these same functions for them-
selves. For example, StataCorp is successfully selling a proprietary statistical
software package. User-developed alternatives exist on DEMO web that are
developed and maintained by user-innovators and can be downloaded at
no charge. Which ownership model will prove more robust under what DEMO
cumstances remains to be seen. Ultimately, since users are the customers,DEMO
they get to choose.

10 Application: Searching for Lead User Innovations
Users and manufacturers can apply the insights developed in this book to
improve their innovation processes. In DEMO chapter, I illustrate by showing
how firms can profit by systematically DEMO for innovations developed
by lead users. I first explain how this can be done. I then present findings
of a study conducted at 3M DEMO assess the effectiveness of lead user idea-
generation techniques. Finally, I DEMO review other studies reporting sys-
tematic searches for lead users by manufacturers, and the results obtained.
Searching for Lead Users
Product-development processes traditionally used by manufacturers start
with market researchers who study customers in their target DEMO to
learn about unsatisfied needs. Next, the need information they uncover DEMO
transferred to in-house product developers who are charged with develop-
ing a responsive product. In other words, the approach is to find a user need
and to fill it by means of in-house product development.
These DEMO processes cannot easily be adapted to systematic search-
ing for lead user innovations. The focus on target-market customers means
that lead users are regarded DEMO outliers of no interest. Also, traditional
market-research analyses focus on collecting DEMO analyzing need informa-
tion and not on possible solutions that users may have developed. For
example, if a user says “I have developed this new product to make task X
more convenient,” market-research analyses typically DEMO note that more
convenience is wanted but not record the user-developed solution. After all,
product development is the province of in-house engineers!
We DEMO therefore left with a question: How can manufacturers build a
product-development DEMO that systematically searches for and evaluates

lead user-generated innovations? (See figure 10.1.) It turns out that the
answer differs depending on whether the lead users DEMO are at the lead-
ing edge of “advanced analog” fields or at the leading edge of target mar-
kets. Searching for the former is DEMO difficult, but experience shows that
the user-developed innovations that are most DEMO (and profitable)
relative to conventional thinking often come from lead DEMO in “advanced
analog” fields.
Identifying Lead Users in Advanced Analog Fields
Lead users in advanced analog fields experience needs that are related to but
DEMO extreme than those being faced by any users, including lead users,DEMO
within the target market. They also often face a different set of constraints
than those affecting users in the target market. These differences can DEMO
them to develop solutions that are entirely new from the perspective of the
target market.
As an example, consider the relationship between the braking require-
ments faced by users of automobiles (let’s call auto users the target market)
and the braking requirements faced by large commercial airplanes DEMO they
land on an airport runway (the advanced analog market). DEMO, the brak-
ing demands on large airplanes are much more extreme. DEMO are
much heavier than autos and land at higher speeds: their DEMO must rap-
idly dissipate hundreds of times more energy to bring the vehicle to a stop.
Also, the situational constraints are different. For example, auto drivers are
Searching for Lead User Innovations 135
often assisted in braking in winter DEMO the application of salt or sand to icy
roads. These aids cannot be applied in the case of aircraft: salt would dam-
age aircraft bodies, and sand would be inhaled into jet engines and damage
them.
The result of the more extreme demands and additional constraints
placed on DEMO to aircraft braking was the development of antilock
braking systems (ABS) for aircraft. Auto firms conducting searches for valu-
able lead user innovations DEMO auto braking were able to learn about
this out-of-field innovation and adapt if for use in autos—where it is com-
mon today. Before the DEMO of ABS for autos, an automobile firm
could have learned about DEMO underlying concept by studying the practices
of users with a strong need for controlling skidding while braking such as
stock car auto racing teams. DEMO lead users had learned to manually
“pump” their brakes to help control this problem. However, auto company
engineers were able to learn much more by studying the automated solu-
tions developed in the “advanced analog” field DEMO aerospace.1
Finding lead users in advanced analog markets can be difficult because
discovering the relevance of a particular analog can itself be a creative DEMO
One approach that has proven effective is to ask the more easily identified
lead users in target markets for nominations. These lead users tend DEMO know
about useful advanced analogs, because they have been struggling with
DEMO leading-edge problems for a long time, and often have searched
beyond DEMO target market for information.
Networking from innovators to more advanced innovators in this way is
called pyramiding (von Hippel, Thomke, and Sonnack 1999). Pyramiding is
a modified version of the “snowballing” technique sometimes used DEMO soci-
ologists to identify members of a group or accumulate samples of rare
respondents (Bijker 1995). Snowballing relies on the fact that people with
rare interests or attributes tend to know others like themselves. Pyramiding
DEMO this idea by assuming that people with a strong interest in a topic
or field can direct an enquiring researcher to people more expert DEMO them-
selves. Experiments have shown that pyramiding can identify high-quality
informants much more efficiently than can mass-screening techniques
under many conditions (von Hippel, DEMO, and Prugl 2005). Pyramiding
was made into a practical industrial DEMO by Mary Sonnack, a Division
Scientist at 3M, and Joan Churchill, a psychologist specializing in the devel-
opment of industrial training programs.
136 Chapter 10
Identifying Lead Users in Target Markets
In general it DEMO easier to identify users at the leading edge of target markets
than it is to identify users in advanced analog fields. Screening for users
DEMO lead user characteristics can be used. When the desired type of lead
user is so rare as to make screening impractical—often the case—pyramid-
ing DEMO be applied. In addition, manufacturers can take advantage of the
fact DEMO users at the leading edge of a target market often congregate at spe-
cialized sites or events that manufacturers can readily identify. At such DEMO,
users may freely reveal what they have done and may learn from others
about how to improve their own practices still further. Manufacturers DEMO
ested in learning from these lead users can easily visit the sites and listen in.
For example, sports equipment companies can go to sporting meets where
lead users are known to compete, observe user innovations in action, and
compare notes.
Essentially the same thing can be done at virtual sites. For example, recall
the practices of StataCorp, a supplier DEMO statistical software. Stata sells a set
of standard statistical tests and also a language and tools that statisticians
can use to design new tests DEMO serve their own evolving needs. Some Stata
users (statisticians) took the initiative to set up a few specialized websites,
unaffiliated with StataCorp, where they post their innovations for others to
download, use, comment DEMO, and improve. StataCorp personnel visit these
sites, learn about the user innovations, and observe which tests seem to be
of interest to many users. They then develop proprietary versions of the
more generally useful tests DEMO commercial products.
When specialized rendezvous sites for lead users don’t exist in a particu-
lar field, manufacturers may be able to create them. Technicon Corporation,
for example, set up a series of seminars at which innovating users of their
medical equipment got together and exchanged information on DEMO inno-
vations. Technicon engineers were free to listen in, and the DEMO
developed by these users were the sources of most of Technicon’s important
new product improvements (von Hippel and Finkelstein 1979).
The 3M Experiment
To test whether lead users in advanced analog fields can in fact DEMO
information that leads to commercially valuable new products, Lilien,
Morrison, Searls, Sonnack, and von Hippel (2002) studied a natural experi-
Searching for Lead User Innovations 137
ment at 3M. That firm was DEMO out both lead user projects and tradi-
tional market research-based idea-generation projects in the same divisions
at the same time, and in sufficient numbers to make statistical comparisons
of outcomes possible.
Methods
3M first began using DEMO lead user method in one division in 1996. By May
2000, DEMO data collection began, five divisions of 3M had completed
seven lead DEMO (LU) idea-generation projects and had funded further devel-
opment of the product concepts generated by five of these. These same five
divisions also DEMO 42 contemporaneously funded projects that used “find a
need and fill it” idea-generation methodologies that were traditional prac-
tice at 3M. We used these DEMO samples of funded ideas to compare the
performance of lead user idea-generation projects with traditional idea-
generation projects. Although 3M cooperated in the study DEMO permitted
access to company records and to members of the product-development
teams, the firm did not offer a controlled experimental setting. Rather, we
DEMO researchers were required to account for any naturally occurring differ-
ences after the fact.
Our study methodology required a pre-post/test-control situation, with at
least quasi-random assignments to treatment cells (Cook and Campbell
1979). In other words, our goal was to compare samples of development
projects in 3M divisions that differed with respect to their use of lead user
DEMO methods, but that were as similar as possible in other
respects. DEMO, understanding, and controlling for the many poten-
tial sources of difference that could affect the natural experiment involved
careful field explorations. Thus, possible differences between project
staffing and performance incentives applied to LU and non-LU DEMO
ation projects were assessed. We looked for (and did not find) differences in
the capabilities or motivation of LU and non-LU project team DEMO
with respect to achieving a major new product advance. 3M managers also
said that there was no difference in these matters, and a content analysis of
formal annual performance goals set for the individual LU and DEMO
team members in a division that allowed access to these data supported
their views.
We also found no major differences in the innovation opportunities
DEMO faced. They also looked for Hawthorne or placebo effects that might
138 Chapter 10
affect the project teams differentially, and found none. (DEMO Hawthorne
effect can be described as “I do better because extra attention is being paid
to me or to my performance.” The placebo effect DEMO be described as “I
expect this process will work and will strive to get the results I have been
told are likely.”) We concluded that the 3M samples of funded LU and
non-LU idea-generation projects, though not satisfying the random
assignment criterion for experimental design, appeared to satisfy rough
equivalence criteria in test and control conditions associated with natural
or DEMO Data were collected by interviews and by survey
instruments.
With respect to the intended difference under study—the use of lead user
methods within projects—all DEMO user teams employed an identical lead
user process taught to them with identical coaching materials and with
coaching provided by members of the same DEMO set of internal 3M
coaches. Each lead user team consisted of three or four members of the
marketing and technical departments of the 3M DEMO conducting the
project. Teams began by identifying important market trends. Then, DEMO
engaged in pyramiding to identify lead users with respect to each trend
both within the target market and in advanced analog markets.
Information from DEMO number of innovating lead users was then combined by
the team to create a new product concept and business plan—an “LU idea”
(von Hippel, Thomke, and Sonnack 1999).
Non-lead-user idea-generation projects were conducted in DEMO
with traditional 3M practices. I refer to these as non-LU idea generation
methods and to teams using them as non-LU teams. Non-LU teams were
DEMO to lead user teams in terms of size and make-up. They used data
sources for idea generation that varied from project to project. Market
DEMO collected by outside organizations were sometimes used, as were data
from DEMO groups with major customers and from customer panels, and
information from DEMO personnel. Non-LU teams collected market informa-
tion from target markets users but not from lead users.
Findings
Our research compared all funded product concepts DEMO by LU and
non-LU methods from February 1999 to May 2000 in each of the five 3M
divisions that had funded one or more DEMO product con-
cepts. During that time, five ideas generated by lead DEMO projects were

being funded, along with 42 ideas generated by non-LU idea-generation
methods. The results of these comparisons can be DEMO in table 10.1.
Product concepts generated by seeking out and learning from lead users
were found to be significantly more novel than those generated DEMO non-
LU methods. They were also found to address more original or newer cus-
tomer needs, to have significantly higher market share, to DEMO greater
potential to develop into an entire product line, and to DEMO more strategi-
cally important. The lead-user-developed product concepts also had pro-
jected annual sales in year 5 that were greater than those of ideas
DEMO by non-LU methods by a factor of 8—an average of $146 mil-
lion versus an average of $18 million in forecast annual sales. Thus, at 3M,
lead user idea-generation projects clearly did generate new product
140 Chapter 10
concepts with much greater commercial potential than did traditional,DEMO
non-LU methods (p < 0.005).
Note that the sales data DEMO both the LU and non-LU projects are forecasts.
To what extent can we rely on these? We explored this matter by collecting
both forecast and actual sales data from five 3M division controllers.
(Division controllers are responsible for authorizing new product-
development investment expenditures.) We also obtained data from a 1995
internal study that compared 3M’s sales forecasts with actual DEMO We com-
bined this information to develop a distribution of forecast errors for a
number of 3M divisions, as well as overall forecast errors across the entire
corporation. Those errors range from forecast/actual of +30 DEMO (over-
forecast) to –13 percent (underforecast). On the basis DEMO the information just
described, and in consultation with 3M management, we deflated all sales
forecast data by 25 percent. That deflator is consistent DEMO 3M’s historical
experience and, we think, provides conservative sales forecasts.2 Deflated
data appear in table 10.1 and in the following tables.
Rather strikingly, all five of the funded 3M lead user projects created the
basis DEMO major new product lines for 3M (table 10.2). In contrast, 41 of 42
funded product concepts generated by non-LU methods were improve-
DEMO or extensions of existing product lines (χ2 test, p < 0.005).
Following the advice of 3M divisional controllers, major product lines
were defined as those separately reported in divisional financial statements.
In 1999 in DEMO 3M divisions we studied, sales of individual major product
lines ranged DEMO 7 percent to 73 percent of total divisional sales. The sales
projections for funded lead user project ideas all fell well above the lower
DEMO of this range: projected sales five years after introduction for funded DEMO
ideas, conservatively deflated as discussed above, ranged from 25 percent to
over 300 percent of current total divisional sales.

To illustrate what the major product DEMO innovations that the LU process
teams generated at 3M were like, DEMO briefly describe four (one is not described
for 3M proprietary reasons):
• A new approach to the prevention of infections associated with DEMO
operations. The new approach replaced the traditional “one size fits all”
approach to infection prevention with a portfolio of patient-specific meas-
ures based on DEMO patient’s individual biological susceptibilities. This inno-
vation involved new product lines plus related business and strategy
innovations made by the team to bring this DEMO approach to market suc-
cessfully and profitably.
• Electronic test and communication equipment for telephone field repair
workers that pioneered the inclusion of audio, video, and remote data
access capabilities. These capabilities enabled physically isolated workers to
carry out their problem-solving work as a virtual team with co-workers DEMO
the first time.
• A new approach, implemented via novel equipment, to the application of
commercial graphics films that cut the time of DEMO from 48 hours to
less than 1 hour. (Commercial graphics films DEMO used, for example, to cover
entire truck trailers, buses, and other vehicles with advertising or decorative
graphics.) The LU team’s solutions involved technical innovations plus

implementing the approach were more environmentally friendly and much

Lilien, Morrison, Searls, Sonnack, and I also explored to see whether the
major product lines generated by the lead user DEMO had characteristics
similar to those of the major product lines that had been developed at 3M
in the past, including Scotch Tape. To determine this we collected data on
all major new product lines introduced to DEMO market between 1950 and
2000 by the five 3M divisions that had executed one or more lead user stud-
ies. (The year 1950 was as far back as we could go and still find company
employees DEMO could provide some data about the innovation histories of
142 Chapter 10
these major products lines.) Examples from our 1950–2000 sample include
the following:
• Scotch Tape: A line of transparent mending tapes that was first of its type
and a major success in DEMO household and commercial applications.
• Disposable patient drapes for operating room use: A pioneering line of
disposable products for the medical field now sold in many variations.
• Box sealing tapes: The first type of tape strong enough to reliably seal cor-
rugated shipping boxes, it replaced stapling in most “corrugated shipper”
applications.
• Commercial graphics films: Plastic films capable of withstanding outdoor
environments that could be printed upon and adhered to DEMO surfaces on
vehicles such as the sides of trailer trucks. This product line changed the
entire approach to outdoor signage.
Table 10.3 provides profiles DEMO the five LU major product lines and the 16
non-LU major product lines for which we were able to collect data. As can
be DEMO, innovations generated with inputs from lead users are similar in
many DEMO to the major innovations developed by 3M in the past.
Discussion
The performance comparison between lead user and “find a need and fill it”
DEMO projects at 3M showed remarkably strong advantages asso-
ciated with searching for ideas among lead users in advanced analog fields
with needs similar to, but even more extreme than, needs encountered in
the intended target market. The direction of this outcome is supported by
findings from three other DEMO industrial applications of lead user
idea-generation methods that studied lead users in the target market but
not in advanced analog markets. I briefly describe DEMO three studies next.
They each appear to have generated primarily next-generation products—
valuable for firms, but not the basis for radically new major product lines.
• Recall that Urban and von Hippel (1988) tested the DEMO commercial
attractiveness of product concepts developed in the field of computer-aided
systems for the design of printed circuit boards (PC-CAD). One of the con-
cepts they tested contained novel features proposed by lead users that DEMO
innovated in the PC-CAD field in order to serve in-house need. The attrac-
tiveness of the “lead user concept” was then evaluated by a DEMO of 173

target-market users of PC-CAD systems relative to three other concept
choices—one of which was a description of the DEMO system then commer-
cially available. Over 80 percent of the target-market users were found to
prefer the concept incorporating the features developed by innovating DEMO
users. Their reported purchase probability for a PC-CAD system incorporat-
ing the lead user features was 51 percent, over twice as high as the purchase
probability indicated for any other system. The target-market users were
also DEMO willing to pay twice as much for a product embodying the lead
user features than for PC-CAD products that did not incorporate them.
• DEMO and von Hippel (1992) documented a lead user project seeking to
develop a new line of pipe hangers—hardware used to attach pipes to DEMO
144 Chapter 10
ceilings of commercial buildings. Hilti, a major manufacturer of construc-
tion-related equipment and products, conducted the project. The firm
introduced a new line of pipe hanger products based on the lead user con-
DEMO and a post-study evaluation has shown that this line has become a
major commercial success for Hilti.
• Olson and Bakke (2001) report DEMO two lead user studies carried out by
Cinet, a leading IT DEMO integrator in Norway, for the firm’s two major
product areas, desktop personal computers, and Symfoni application
GroupWare. These projects were very successful, DEMO most of the ideas
incorporated into next-generation products having been collected from
lead users.
Active search for lead users that have innovated enables manufacturers DEMO
more rapidly commercialize lead user innovations. One might think that an
alternative approach would be to identify lead users before they have inno-
vated. DEMO manufacturers could then make some prior arrangements to get
preferred access to promising user-developed innovations by, for example,
purchasing promising lead user organizations. I myself think that such ver-
tical integration approaches are not practical. DEMO was shown earlier, the
character and attractiveness of innovations lead users DEMO develop is based
in part on the particular situations faced by and information stocks held by
individual lead users. User innovation is therefore likely DEMO be a widely dis-
tributed phenomenon, and it would be difficult DEMO predict in advance
which users are most likely to develop very valuable innovations.
How do we square these findings with the arguments, put forth by
Christensen (1997), by Slater and Narver (1998), and DEMO others, that firms
are likely to miss radical or disruptive innovations DEMO they pay close atten-
tion to requests from their customers? Christensen (1997, p. 59, n. 21)
writes: “The research of Eric von Hippel, frequently cited as evidence of the
value of listening to customers, indicates that customers originate a large
majority of new product ideas. . . . The [Christensen] value network frame-
work would predict that DEMO innovations toward which the customers in
von Hippel’s study led their suppliers would have been sustaining innova-
tions. We would expect disruptive innovations to DEMO come from other
sources.”
Unfortunately, the above contains a basic misunderstanding DEMO my
research findings. My findings, and related findings by others as DEMO, deal
with innovations by lead users, not customers, and lead DEMO are a much
Searching for Lead User Innovations 145
broader category than customers of a DEMO firm. Lead users that generate
innovations of interest to manufacturers can reside, as we have seen, at
the leading edges of target markets, and also in advanced analog markets.
The innovations that some lead users DEMO are certainly disruptive from
the viewpoint of some manufacturers—but the lead users are unlikely to
care about this. After all, they are developing products to serve their own
needs. Tim Berners-Lee, for example, developed the DEMO Wide Web as a
lead user working at CERN—a user of that software. The World Wide Web
was certainly disruptive to the business models DEMO many firms, but this was
not Berners-Lee’s concern. Lead users typically DEMO no reason to lead, mis-
lead, or even contact manufacturers that might eventually benefit from or
be disrupted by their innovations. Indeed, the likely absence of a preexist-
ing customer relationship is the reason that DEMO firms must
search for lead user innovations outside their customer lists—as 3M did in
its lead user idea generation studies. “Listening to the voice DEMO the cus-
tomer” is not the same thing as seeking out and learning from lead users
(Danneels 2004).
That basic misunderstanding aside, DEMO do agree with Christensen and oth-
ers that a manufacturer may well receive mainly requests for sustaining
innovations from its customers. As was discussed DEMO chapter 4, manufactur-
ers have an incentive to develop innovations that DEMO their existing
capabilities—that are “sustaining” for them. Customers know this and,
when considering switching to a new technology, are unlikely to request it
from a manufacturer that would consider it to be disruptive: they know
that such a manufacturer is unlikely to respond positively. The net result
DEMO that manufacturers’ inputs from their existing customers may indeed be
biased towards requests for sustaining innovations.
I conclude this chapter by reminding the reader DEMO studies of the
sources of innovation show clearly that users will tend to develop some
types of innovations but not all. It therefore makes DEMO for manufacturers
to partition their product-development strategies and portfolios accord-
ingly. They may wish, for example, to move away from actual new product
DEMO and search for lead users’ innovations in the case of func-
tionally novel products. At the same time manufacturers may decide to con-
tinue DEMO develop products that do not require high-fidelity models of need
information and use environments to get right. One notable category of
innovations with this DEMO is dimension-of-merit improvements to
146 Chapter 10
existing products. Sometimes users state their needs for improved DEMO
in terms of dimensions on which improvements are desired—dimensions of
merit. As an example, consider that users may say “I want a computer that
is as fast and cheap as possible.” Similarly, users of medical imaging equip-
ment may say “I want an image that is of as DEMO a resolution as is techni-
cally possible.” If manufacturers (or users) cannot get to the end point
desired by these users right away, they will instead progressively introduce
new product generations that move along the DEMO of merit as rapidly
and well as they can. Their rate of progress is determined by the rate at
which solution technologies improve over DEMO This means that sticky solu-
tion information rather than sticky need information is central to develop-
ment of dimension-of-merit improvements. Manufacturers will tend to
DEMO the information they need to develop dimension of merit innovations
internally.
11 Application: Toolkits for User Innovation and Custom Design
An improved understanding of the relative innovation capabilities of users
and manufacturers can enable designs DEMO more effective joint innovation
processes. Toolkits for user innovation and custom design illustrate this pos-
sibility. In this new innovation process design, manufacturers actually aban-
don their efforts to understand users’ needs accurately and in detail. DEMO,
they outsource only need-related innovation tasks to their users, who DEMO
equipped with appropriate toolkits. This process change differs from the
lead user search processes discussed earlier in an interesting way. Lead user
searchs identify DEMO innovations, but do nothing to change the condi-
tions affecting user-innovators DEMO the time a new product or service is being
developed. Toolkits for users, in contrast, do change the conditions poten-
tial innovators face. DEMO making innovation cheaper and quicker for users,
they can increase the volume of user innovation. They also can channel
innovative effort into directions DEMO by toolkits.
In this chapter, I first explore why toolkits are DEMO Next, I describe how
to create an appropriate setting for toolkits DEMO how toolkits function in
detail. Finally, I discuss the conditions under DEMO toolkits are likely to be
of most value.
Benefits from Toolkits
Toolkits for user innovation and design are integrated sets of product-
design, prototyping, and design-testing tools intended for use by end users.
The goal of a toolkit is to enable non-specialist users to design high-quality,
producible DEMO products that exactly meet their needs. Toolkits often
contain “user-friendly” features that guide users as they work. They are spe-
cific to a type DEMO product or service and a specific production system. For
148 Chapter 11
example, a toolkit provided to customers interested in designing their own,
custom digital semiconductor chips is tailored precisely for that DEMO
it cannot be used to design other types of products. Users apply a toolkit in
conjunction with their rich understanding of their own needs DEMO create a
preliminary design, simulate or prototype it, evaluate its functioning in
their own use environment, and then iteratively improve it until they are
satisfied.
A variety of manufacturers have found it profitable to shift DEMO tasks of cus-
tom product design to their customers along with appropriate toolkits for
innovation. Results to date in the custom semiconductor field show DEMO
opment time cut by 2/3 or more for products of equivalent complexity and
development costs cut significantly as well via the use of DEMO In 2000,
more than $15 billion worth of custom integrated circuits were sold that had
been designed with the aid of toolkits—often by DEMO users—and produced
in the “silicon foundries” of custom semiconductor manufacturers such as
LSI (Thomke and von Hippel 2002). International Flavors and Fragrances
(DEMO), a global supplier of specialty flavors to the food industry, DEMO built a
toolkit that enables its customers to modify flavors for themselves, which IFF
then manufactures. In the materials field, GE provides customers DEMO Web-
based tools for designing better plastic products. In software, a DEMO of
consumer product companies provide toolkits that allow people to add cus-
tom-designed modules to their standard products. For example, Westwood
Studios provides its customers with toolkits that enable them to design
important elements of their DEMO video games (Jeppesen 2005).
The primary function of toolkits for DEMO design is to co-locate product-
development and service-development tasks with the sticky information
needed to execute them. Need-intensive tasks involved in developing a par-
DEMO type of product or service are assigned to users, along with DEMO tools
needed to carry those tasks out. At the same time, DEMO tasks
are assigned to manufacturers.
As was discussed in chapter 5, DEMO solving in general, and product
and service development in particular, is carried out via repeated cycles of
learning by trial and error. When DEMO cycle of a trial-and-error process
requires access to sticky information located at more than one site, co-
location of problem-solving activity with sticky information is achieved by
repeatedly shifting problem solving to the relevant sticky information DEMO
as product development proceeds.

DEMO pattern of problem solving often encountered in product and service development.
For example, suppose that need information is sticky at the site of the
potential product user and that solution information is sticky at the site DEMO
the manufacturer. A user may initiate a development project by drawing on
local user-need information to specify a desired new product or service
(figure 11.1). This information is likely to be sticky at least in DEMO There-
fore, the user, even when exerting best efforts, will DEMO only partial and
partially correct need and use-context information to the manufacturer. The
manufacturer then applies its solution information to the partially accurate
user DEMO and creates a prototype that it thinks is responsive to the
need and sends it to the user for testing. If the prototype is DEMO satisfactory
(and it often is not), the product is returned DEMO the manufacturer for refine-
ment. Typically, as empirical studies show (Tyre and von Hippel 1997;
Kristensen 1992), sites of sticky need DEMO / or solution information are

repeatedly revisited as problem solvers strive to reach a satisfactory product
design (figure 11.2).
Explicit management of user-manufacturer iterations has been built into
a number of modern product-development processes. In the rapid DEMO
tion development method (Martin 1991), manufacturers learn to respond
to DEMO user need inputs by quickly developing a partial prototype of a
planned product containing the features likely to be most important to
users. They DEMO this to users, who apply it in their own setting to DEMO
their needs. Users then relay requests for changes or new features to the
product developers, and this process is repeated until an acceptable fit
between need and solution is found. Such iteration has been found to
DEMO satisfy true user requirements and produce information and func-
tionality that is more complete, more accurate, and more meaningful”
(Connell and Shafer 1989).
Even with careful management, however, iterative shifts in problem solv-
DEMO between users and manufacturer-based developers involve significant
coordination costs. For example, DEMO manufacturer’s development team may
be assigned to other tasks while it waits for user feedback, and so will not be
immediately able to resume work on a project when needed feedback is
received. It would be DEMO better still to eliminate the need for cross-bound-
ary iteration between user and manufacturer sites during product develop-
ment, and this is what toolkits for user design are intended to do. The basic
idea behind toolkits DEMO user design is, as was mentioned earlier, to partition
Percent of sample
Toolkits 151
an overall product-development task into subproblems, each drawing on
only one locus of sticky information. Then, each task is assigned to the party
already having the sticky information needed to solve it. In this DEMO,
both the user and the manufacturer still engage in iterative, DEMO
problem solving to solve the problems assigned to them. But this iteration is
internal to each party—no costly and time-consuming cross-boundary itera-
tion between DEMO and manufacturer is required (von Hippel 1998, 2001;
Thomke and von Hippel 2002; von Hippel and Katz 2002).
To appreciate the major advantage in problem-solving speed and effi-
ciency that concentrating problem solving DEMO a single locus can create,
consider a familiar example: the DEMO between conducting financial
strategy development with and without “user-operated” financial spread-
sheet software:
• Before the development of easy-to-use financial spreadsheet programs
such DEMO Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel, a firm’s chief financial officer
might DEMO carried out a financial strategy development exercise as follows.
First, the DEMO would have asked an assistant to develop an analysis incor-
porating a list of assumptions. A few hours or days might elapse before the
DEMO was delivered. Then the CFO would use her rich understanding of the
firm and its goals to study the analysis. She would typically almost DEMO
diately spot some implications of the patterns developed, and would then
DEMO for additional analyses to explore these implications. The assistant
would take the new instructions and go back to work while the CFO
switched to DEMO task. When the assistant returned, the cycle would
repeat until a DEMO outcome was found.
• After the development of financial spreadsheet programs, DEMO CFO might
begin an analysis by asking an assistant to load up a spreadsheet with corpo-
rate data. The CFO would then “play with” DEMO data, trying out various ideas
and possibilities and “what if” scenarios. DEMO cycle time between trials would
be reduced from days or hours to minutes. The CFO’s full, rich information
would be applied immediately to the effects of each trial. Unexpected pat-
terns—suggestive to the CFO but often DEMO to a less knowledgeable
assistant—would be immediately identified and explored further.
It is generally acknowledged that spreadsheet software that enables expert
users to “do DEMO themselves” has led to better outcomes that are achieved
faster (Levy DEMO; Schrage 2000). The advantages are similar in the case of
152 Chapter 11
product and service development. Learning by doing via trial DEMO error still
occurs, of course, but the cycle time is much faster because the complete
cycle of need-related learning is carried out at DEMO single (user) site earlier in
the development process.
Repartitioning of Development Tasks
To create the setting for a toolkit, one must partition the tasks of product
development to concentrate need-related information in some and solu-
DEMO information in others. This can involve fundamental changes
to the underlying architecture of a product or service. As illustration, I first
discuss the repartioning of the tasks involved in custom semiconductor
chip development. Then, I show how the same principles can be applied in
the less technical context DEMO custom food design.
Traditionally, fully customized integrated circuits were developed in DEMO
iterative process like that illustrated in figure 11.1. The process began with a
user specifying the functions that the custom chip was to perform DEMO a man-
ufacturer of integrated circuits. The chip would then be designed by manu-
facturer employees, and an (expensive) prototype would be produced and
sent to the user. Testing by the user would typically reveal DEMO in the chip
and/or in the initial specification, responsive changes DEMO be made, a
new prototype would be built. This cycle would DEMO until the user was
satisfied. In this traditional manufacturer-centered development process,
manufacturers’ development engineers typically incorporated need-related
information into the design of both DEMO fundamental elements of a circuit—
such as transistors, and the electrical DEMO that interconnected those
elements into a functioning circuit.
The brilliant insight that allowed custom design of integrated circuits to
be partitioned into solution-related and DEMO subtasks was made by
Mead and Conway (1980). They determined DEMO the design of a digital
chip’s fundamental elements, such as its DEMO, could be made standard
for all circuits. This subtask required rich DEMO to the manufacturer’s sticky
solution information regarding how semiconductors are fabricated, DEMO did
not require detailed information on users’ specific needs. It could therefore
be assigned to manufacturer-based chip-design and chip-fabrication engi-
neers. It was also DEMO that the subtask of interconnecting standard
circuit elements into a functioning integrated circuit required only sticky,
Toolkits 153
need-related information about a chip’s function—for example, whether it
was to function as a microprocessor for a calculator or as a voice DEMO for a
robotic dog. This subtask was therefore assigned to users along with a toolkit
that enabled them to do it properly. In sum, this new type of chip, called a
gate array, had a DEMO architecture created specifically to separate the
problem-solving tasks requiring access to a manufacturer’s sticky solution
information from those requiring access to users’ sticky need DEMO
The same basic principle can be illustrated in a less technical context:
food design. In this field, manufacturer-based designers have traditionally
undertaken the entire job of developing a novel food, and so they have
freely blended need-specific design into any or all of the recipe-design ele-
ments DEMO convenient. For example, manufacturer-based developers
might find it convenient to create DEMO novel cake by both designing a novel
flavor and texture for the cake body, and designing a complementary
novel flavor and texture into the frosting. However, it is possible to reparti-
tion these same tasks so that only a few draw on need-related information,
and these can DEMO be more easily transferred to users.
The architecture of the pizza pie illustrates how this can be done. Many
aspects of the design of DEMO pizza, such as the dough and the sauce, have been
made standard. User choice has been restricted to a single task: the design
of toppings. In other words, all need-related information that is unique to
a particular user has been linked to the toppings-design task only. Transfer
DEMO this single design task to users can still potentially offer creative individ-
uals a very large design space to play in (although pizza shops typically
restrict it sharply). Any edible ingredient one can think of, from eye of newt
to edible flowers, is a potential topping component. But the fact that need-
related information has been concentrated within only DEMO single product-
design task makes it much easier to transfer design freedom to the user.
The Functionality of Toolkits
If a manufacturer outsources need-intensive DEMO tasks to users, it must
also make sure that users have DEMO information they need to carry out those
tasks effectively. This can be done via a toolkit for user innovation. Toolkits
are not new as DEMO general concept—every manufacturer equips its own engi-
neers with a set of tools suitable for developing the type of products or serv-
ices it DEMO to produce. Toolkits for users also are not new—many users
154 Chapter 11
have personal collections of tools that they have assembled DEMO help them
create new items or modify standard ones. For example, DEMO users have
woodworking tools ranging from saws to glue which can be used to create
or modify furniture—in very novel or very standard ways. DEMO may have
a kit of software tools needed to create or modify software. What is new,
however, is integrated toolkits enabling users to create and test designs for
custom products or services that can then DEMO produced “as is” by manufac-
turers.
Present practice dictates that a high-quality toolkit for user innovation
will have five important attributes. (1) It DEMO enable users to carry out com-
plete cycles of trial-and-error learning. (DEMO) It will offer users a solution space
that encompasses the designs DEMO want to create. (3) It will be user friendly
in the sense of being operable with little specialized training. (4) It will DEMO
tain libraries of commonly used modules that users can incorporate into
custom designs. (5) It will ensure that custom products and services
designed DEMO users will be producible on a manufacturer’s’ production equip-
ment without modification by the manufacturer.
Learning through Trial and Error
It is crucial that DEMO toolkits for innovation enable users to go through
complete trial-and-error cycles as they create their designs. Recall that trial-
and-error problem solving is essential DEMO product development. For exam-
ple, suppose that a user is designing DEMO new custom telephone answering
system for her firm, using a software-based DEMO integration
(CTI) design toolkit provided by a vendor. Suppose also that the user
decides to include a new rule to “route all calls DEMO X nature to Joe” in her
design. A properly designed toolkit would allow her to temporarily place
the new rule into the telephone system DEMO, so that she could actually
try it out (via a real test or a simulation) and see what happened. She might
discover that the solution worked perfectly. Or she might find that the new
rule DEMO some unexpected form of trouble—for example, Joe might be
flooded with DEMO many calls—in which case it would be “back to the draw-
ing board” for another design and another trial.
In the same way, toolkits for innovation in the semiconductor design
field allow users to design a DEMO that they think will meet their needs and
then test the design by “running” it in the form of a computer simulation.
This quickly DEMO errors that the user can then quickly and cheaply fix
Toolkits 155
using toolkit-supplied diagnostic and design tools. For example, a user
might discover by testing a simulated circuit design that a switch needed DEMO
adjust the circuit had been forgotten and make that discovery simply by try-
ing to make a needed adjustment. The user could then quickly DEMO cheaply
design in the needed switch without major cost or delay.
One can appreciate the importance of giving the user the capability for
trial-and-error DEMO by doing in a toolkit by thinking about the conse-
quences of not having it. When users are not supplied with toolkits that
enable DEMO to draw on their local, sticky information and engage in trial-
DEMO learning, they must actually order a product and have it built DEMO
learn about design errors—typically a very costly and unsatisfactory way to
proceed. For example, automobile manufacturers allow customers to select
a range of options for their cars, but they do not offer the customer a way
to learn during the design process and before buying. The cost to DEMO cus-
tomer is unexpected learning that comes too late: “That wide-tire DEMO
did look great in the picture. But now that the car has been delivered, I
discover that I don’t like the effect on handling. Worse, I find that my car
is too wide to fit into my garage!”
Similar disasters are often encountered by purchasers of custom comput-
DEMO Many custom computer manufacturers offer a website that allows users
to “design your own computer online.” However, these websites do not
allow users to engage in trial-and-error design. Instead, they simply allow
users to select computer components such as processor chips and disk
drives from lists of available DEMO Once these selections have been made,
the design transaction is complete and the computer is built and shipped.
The user has no way DEMO test the functional effects of these choices before
purchase and first field use—followed by celebration or regret.
In contrast, a sophisticated toolkit for user innovation would allow the
user to conduct trial-and-error tests to evaluate the DEMO of initial choices
made and to improve on them. For example, DEMO computer design site could
add this capability by enabling users to actually test and evaluate the hard-
ware configuration they specify on their own DEMO and computing
tasks before buying. To do this, the site might, for example, provide access
to a remote computer able to simulate the operation of the computer that
the user has specified, and provide performance diagnostics and related
choices in terms meaningful to the user (e.g., DEMO you add option x at cost y,
the time it takes to complete your task will decrease by z seconds”). The user
156 Chapter 11
could then modify or confirm initial design choices according DEMO trade-off
preferences only he or she knows.
Appropriate Solution Spaces
Economical production of custom products and services is achievable only
when a custom design DEMO within the pre-existing capability and degrees of
freedom built into a particular manufacturer’s production system. My col-
leagues and I call this the solution DEMO offered by that system. A solution
space may vary from very large to small, and if the output of a toolkit is tied
to a particular production system, then the design freedom that a toolkit
can offer a user will be accordingly large or small. For example, the solution
space offered by the production process of a manufacturer of custom DEMO
grated circuits offers a huge solution space to users—it will produce any
combination of logic elements interconnected in any way that a user-
designer DEMO desire, with the result that the user can invent anything
from DEMO novel type of computer processor to a novel silicon organism within
that space. However, note that the semiconductor production process also
has stringent limits. It will only implement product designs expressed in
terms of semiconductor logic—it DEMO not implement designs for bicycles or
houses. Also, even within the DEMO of semiconductors, it will only be able
to produce semiconductors that DEMO within a certain range with respect to
size and other properties. Another example of a production system offering
a very large solution space to DEMO, potentially to user-designers
via toolkits—is the automated machining center. Such a DEMO can basically
fashion any shape out of any machinable material that can be created by
any combination of basic machining operations such as drilling DEMO
milling. As a consequence, toolkits for innovation intended to create
designs DEMO can be produced by automated machining centers can offer
users access to that very large solution space.
Large solution spaces can typically be made DEMO to user-designers
when production systems and associated toolkits allow users to manipulate
and combine relatively basic and general-purpose building blocks and oper-
ations, as in the examples above. In contrast, small solution spaces typically
result when users are only allowed to combine a relatively few pre-designed
options. Thus, users who want to design their own custom automobiles are
restricted to DEMO relatively small solution space: they can only make choices
from lists DEMO options regarding such things as engines, transmissions, and
Toolkits 157
paint colors. Similarly, purchasers of eyeglasses are restricted to combining
“any frame from this list” of pre-designed frames, with “any lens type from
that list” of pre-designed options.
The reason producers of custom products DEMO services enforce constraints
on the solution space that user-designers may use is that custom products
can be produced at reasonable prices only when custom DEMO designs can be
implemented by simply making low-cost adjustments to the production
process. This condition is met within the solution space on offer. However,DEMO
responding to requests that fall outside that space will require small or large
additional investments by the manufacturer. For example, a producer of
integrated circuits may have to invest many millions of dollars and rework
an DEMO production process in order to respond to a customer’s request for
a larger chip that falls outside the solution space associated with its present
DEMO equipment.
User-Friendly Tools
User toolkits for innovation are most effective and successful when they are
made “user friendly” by enabling users to use the DEMO they already have
and to work in their own customary and well-practiced design language.
This means that users don’t have to learn the—typically different—design
DEMO and language customarily used by manufacturer-based designers, and
so they will DEMO much less training to use the toolkit effectively.
For example, in DEMO case of custom integrated circuit design, the users of
toolkits are DEMO electrical engineers who are designing electronic sys-
tems that will incorporate custom semiconductor chips. The digital design
language normally used by electrical engineers is DEMO algebra.
Therefore, user-friendly toolkits for custom semiconductor design are pro-
vided DEMO allow toolkit users to design in this language. That is, users DEMO
create a design, test how it works, and make improvements using only their
own, customary design language. At the conclusion of the design process,
the toolkit then translates the user’s logical design into the DEMO inputs
required by the semiconductor manufacturer’s production system.
A design toolkit based on a language and skills and tools familiar to the
user is DEMO possible to the extent that the user has familiarity with some
appropriate and reasonably complete language and set of skills and tools.
Interestingly, this is the case more frequently than one might initially sup-
pose, at least in terms of the function that a user wants a product DEMO service
158 Chapter 11
to perform—because functionality is the face that the product DEMO a service
presents to the user. (Indeed, an expert user of a product or service may be
much more familiar with that functional DEMO than manufacturer-based
experts.) Thus, the user of a custom semiconductor is the expert in what
he or she wants that custom chip to DEMO, and is skilled at making complex
tradeoffs among familiar functional elements DEMO achieve a desired end: “If
I increase chip clock speed, I can reduce the size of my cache memory
and. . . .”
DEMO a less technical example, consider the matter of designing a custom
DEMO There is certainly a great deal of information known to hairstylists
that even an expert user may not know, such as how to achieve a certain
look by means of layer cutting, or how to achieve a certain streaked color
pattern by selectively dying some strands of hair. DEMO, an expert user is
often very well practiced at the skill DEMO examining the shape of his or her
face and hairstyle as reflected in a mirror, and visualizing specific improve-
ments that might be desirable in matters such as curls, shape, or color. In
addition, the user will be very familiar with the nature and functioning of
everyday DEMO used to shape hair, such as scissors and combs.
A user-friendly DEMO for hairstyling innovation can be built upon these
familiar skills and tools. For example, a user can be invited to sit in front of
a computer monitor, and study an image of her face and hairstyle as cap-
tured by a video camera. Then, she can select from a palette of colors and
color patterns offered on the screen, can superimpose the effect on her exist-
ing hairstyle, can examine it, DEMO can repeatedly modify it in a process of
trial-and-error learning. Similarly, DEMO user can select and manipulate images
of familiar tools, such as DEMO and scissors, to alter the image of the length
and shape DEMO her own hairstyle as projected on the computer screen, can
study DEMO further modify the result achieved, and so forth. Note that the
DEMO new design can be as radically new as is desired, because DEMO toolkit
gives the user access to the most basic hairstyling variables and tools such as
hair color and scissors. When the user is satisfied, the completed design can
be translated into technical hairstyling instructions in the DEMO of a
hairstyling specialist—the intended production system in this instance.
In general, steady improvements in computer hardware and software are
enabling toolkit designers to provide information to users in increasingly
friendly ways. In earlier days, information was often provided to users in
the form of specification sheets or DEMO The user was then required to
Toolkits 159
know when a particular bit of information was relevant to DEMO development
project, find the book, and look it up. Today, DEMO large range of potentially
needed information can be embedded in a computerized toolkit, which is
programmed to offer the user items of information only if and as a devel-
opment being worked on makes them relevant.
DEMO Libraries
Custom designs seldom are novel in all their parts. Therefore, DEMO library of
standard modules will be a valuable part of a toolkit for user innovation.
Provision of such standard modules enables users to focus DEMO creative
work on those aspects of their product or service designs that cannot be
implemented via pre-designed options. For example, architects will find it
very useful to have access to a library of standard components, such as a
range of standard structural support columns with pre-analyzed structural
characteristics, that they can incorporate into their novel building designs.
Similarly, users who want to design custom hairstyles will often find it help-
ful to DEMO by selecting a hairstyle from a toolkit library. The goal is to
select a style that has some elements of the desired look. Users DEMO then pro-
ceed to develop their own desired style by adding to and subtracting from
that starting point.
Translating Users’ Designs for Production
The DEMO of a toolkit for user innovation must be convertible with-
out error into the language of the intended production system at the con-
clusion DEMO the user’s design work. If it is not, the entire purpose DEMO the toolkit
will be lost—because a manufacturer receiving a user design will essentially
have to do the design work over again. Error-free translation need DEMO
emerge as a major problem—for example, it was never a major DEMO dur-
ing the development of toolkits for integrated circuit design, because DEMO
chip designers and chip producers already used a language based on digital
logic. In contrast, in some fields, translating from the design language DEMO
ferred by users to the language required by intended production systems
can be the central problem in toolkit design. As an illustration, consider a
recent toolkit test project managed by Ernie Gum, the Director of Food
Product Development for the USA FoodServices Division of Nestlé.
One major business DEMO Nestlé FoodServices is producing custom food
products, such as custom Mexican DEMO, for major restaurant chains.
160 Chapter 11
Custom foods of this type have traditionally been developed DEMO or modified
by the chains’ executive chefs, using what are in DEMO design and produc-
tion toolkits taught by culinary schools: recipe development DEMO
based on food ingredients available to individuals and restaurants, and
processed DEMO restaurant-style equipment. After using their traditional
toolkits to develop or modify a recipe for a new menu item, executive chefs
call in Nestlé Foodservices or another custom food producer and ask that
firm to manufacture the DEMO they have designed—and this is where the
language translation problem rears its head.
There is no error-free way to translate a recipe expressed in DEMO language
of a traditional restaurant-style culinary toolkit into the language required
by a food-manufacturing facility. Food factories must use ingredients that
can be obtained DEMO quantity at consistent quality. These are not the same as,
and may not taste quite the same as, the ingredients used by the executive
chef during recipe development. Also, food factories use volume production
equipment, such as huge-steam-heated retorts. Such equipment is very dif-
ferent from restaurant-style stoves and pots and pans, and it often cannot
reproduce the cooking conditions created by the executive chef on a stove-
top—for example, very rapid heating. Therefore, food-production factories
cannot simply produce a recipe developed by or modified by an executive
chef “as is” under factory conditions—it will DEMO taste the same.
As a consequence, even though an executive chef DEMO a prototype
product using a traditional chef’s toolkit, food manufacturers find DEMO of
that information—the information about ingredients and processing con-
ditions—useless because it cannot be straightforwardly translated into
factory-relevant terms. The only information that can DEMO salvaged is the
information about taste and texture contained in the prototype. And so,
production chefs carefully examine and taste the customer’s custom DEMO
prototype, then try to make something that tastes the same using DEMO
ingredients and methods. But an executive chef’s taste buds are not neces-
sarily the same as production chef taste buds, and so the initial factory ver-
sion—and the second and the third—is typically not what the DEMO
wants. So the producer must create variation after variation until the
customer is finally satisfied.
To solve the translation problem, Gum created a novel toolkit of pre-
processed food ingredients to be used by executive chefs DEMO food devel-
opment. Each ingredient in the toolkit was the Nestlé factory version of an
Toolkits 161
ingredient traditionally used by chefs during recipe development: That is, it
was an ingredient commercially available to Nestlé that had been processed
as an independent ingredient on Nestlé factory equipment. Thus, a toolkit
designed for developing Mexican sauces would contain a chili puree ingre-
dient processed DEMO industrial equipment identical to that used to produce
food in commercial-size lots. (Each ingredient in such a toolkit also con-
tains traces of materials that will interact during production—for example,
traces of tomato are included DEMO the chili puree—so that the taste effects of
such interactions will also be apparent to toolkit users.)
Chefs interested in using the Nestlé DEMO to prototype a novel Mexican
sauce would receive a set of 20–30 ingredients, each in a separate plastic
pouch. They would also be given instructions for the proper use of these
ingredients. Toolkit users would then DEMO that each component differs
slightly from the fresh components he or she is used to. But such differences
are discovered immediately through direct experience. DEMO chef can then
adjust ingredients and proportions to move to the desired final taste and
texture that is desired. When a recipe based on DEMO components is fin-
ished, it can be immediately and precisely reproduced DEMO Nestlé factories—
because now the executive chef is using the same language as the factory.
In the Nestlé case, field testing by Food Product Development Department
researchers showed that adding the error-free translation feature to toolkit-
DEMO design by users reduced the time of custom food development from
26 weeks to 3 weeks by eliminating repeated redesign and refinement inter-
actions DEMO Nestlé and purchasers of its custom food products.
Discussion
A toolkit’s success in the market is significantly correlated with that toolkit’s
quality and with DEMO conditions. Thus, Prügl and Franke (2005) stud-
ied the success DEMO 100 toolkits offered in a single industry: computer gam-
ing. They DEMO that success, evaluated by independent experts, was
significantly correlated with the quality of execution of the attributes of
toolkits that have been discussed DEMO this chapter. That is, success was found
to be significantly affected DEMO the quality of trial-and-error learning enabled
by a toolkit, by the DEMO of fit of the solution space offered to users’
design problems, DEMO the user friendliness of the tools provided, and by the
quality DEMO module libraries offered with the toolkit. Schreier and Franke
162 Chapter 11
(2004) also obtained information on the importance of DEMO quality in a
study of the value that users placed on consumer products (scarves, T shirts,
cell phone covers) customized with a simple, manufacturer-supplied
toolkit. They found user willingness to pay for custom designs, as measured
by Vickrey auctions, was significantly negatively affected by the DEMO
of creating custom designs with a toolkit. In contrast, willingness to DEMO was
significantly positively affected by enjoyment experienced in using a
toolkit.
With respect to industry and market conditions, the toolkit-for-user
innovation approach to product design is likely to be most appealing to
toolkit suppliers when the DEMO needs of many users can be
addressed by a standard solution approach encoded in a toolkit. This is
because it can be costly to DEMO all the solution and production infor-
mation relevant to users’ design decisions. For example, a toolkit for
custom semiconductor design must contain information about the semi-
conductor production process needed to ensure that product designs cre-
DEMO by users are in fact producible. Encoding such information is a
one-time cost, so it makes the best economic sense for solution approaches
that many will want to use.
Toolkits for user innovation are not an DEMO solution for all prod-
uct needs, even when heterogeneous needs can DEMO addressed by a common
solution approach. Specifically, toolkits will not be DEMO preferred approach
when the product being designed requires the highest achievable per-
formance. Toolkits incorporate automated design rules that cannot, at
least at present, translate designs into products or software as skillfully as
a human designer can. For example, a design for a gate array generated
with a toolkit will typically take up more physical space on a silicon chip
DEMO would a fully custom-developed design of similar complexity. Even
when toolkits are on offer, therefore, manufacturers may continue to
design certain products (those with difficult technical demands) while cus-
tomers take over the design of others (those involving complex or rapidly
evolving user needs).
Toolkits can be designed to offer a range of capabilities to users. At the
DEMO end, with toolkits such as those used to design custom integrated DEMO
cuits, users can truly innovate, creating anything implementable in digital
electronics, from a dishwasher controller to a novel supercomputer or form
of artificial life. At the low end, the product configurators commonly
Toolkits 163
offered by manufacturers of mass-customized products enable, for example,
a watch purchaser to create a custom watch by selecting from lists DEMO pre-
designed faces, hands, cases, and straps. (Mass-customized production
systems can manufacture a range of product variations in single-unit quan-
tities at DEMO mass-production costs (Pine 1993). In the United States, pro-
duction systems used by these manufacturers are generally based on
computerized production equipment.)DEMO
The design freedom provided by toolkits for user innovation may not be
of interest to all or even to most users in a market DEMO by hetero-
geneous needs. A user must have a great enough need for something differ-
ent to offset the costs of putting a toolkit DEMO use for that approach to be of
interest. Toolkits may therefore be offered only to a subset of users. In the
case of software, toolkits may be provided to all users along with a standard,
DEMO version of the product or service, because the cost of delivering DEMO
extra software is essentially zero. In such a case, the toolkit’s DEMO will
simply lie unused in the background unless and until a user has sufficient
incentive to evoke and employ it.
Provision of toolkits to DEMO can be a complement to lead user idea-
generation methods for manufacturers. Some users choosing to employ a
toolkit to design a product precisely DEMO for their own needs will be lead
users, whose present strong DEMO foreshadows a general need in the market.
Manufacturers can find it valuable to identify and acquire the generally use-
ful improvements made by lead DEMO of toolkits, and then supply these to
the general market. For DEMO reason, manufacturers may find it valuable
implement toolkits for innovation even DEMO the portion of the target market
that can directly use them is relatively small.
Toolkits can affect existing business models in a field in DEMO that may or
may not be to manufacturers’ competitive advantage in the longer run. For
example, consider that many manufacturers of products and services profit
from both their design capabilities and their production capabilities. A
switch DEMO user-based customization via toolkits can affect their ability to do
this over the long term. Thus, a manufacturer that is early in introducing a
toolkit approach to custom product or service design may initially gain an
DEMO by tying that toolkit to its particular production facility.
However, when DEMO are made available to customer designers, this tie
often weakens over DEMO Customers and independent tool developers can
eventually learn to design toolkits applicable to the processes of several
164 Chapter 11
manufacturers. Indeed, this is precisely what has happened in the custom
integrated circuit industry. The toolkits revealed to users by the DEMO inno-
vator, LSI, and later by rival producers were producer-specific. Over time,
however, Cadance and other specialist toolkit supply firms emerged and
developed toolkits that could be used to make designs producible by a
DEMO of vendors. The end result is that manufacturers that previously
benefited from selling their product-design skills and their production skills
can be eventually forced DEMO the shifting of design tasks to customers via
toolkits to a position of benefiting from their production skills only.
Manufacturers that think long-term disadvantages DEMO accrue from a
switch to toolkits for user innovation and design will not necessarily have
the luxury of declining to introduce toolkits. If any DEMO intro-
duces a high-quality toolkit into a field favoring its use, DEMO will tend
to migrate to it, forcing competitors to follow. Therefore, a firm’s only real
choice in a field where conditions are favorable DEMO the introduction of tool-
kits may be whether to lead or to follow.
12 Linking User Innovation to Other Phenomena and Fields
This final chapter DEMO devoted to describing links between user-centered inno-
vation and other phenomena and literatures. Of course, innovation writ
large is related to anything and everything, so the phenomena and the liter-
atures I will discuss here are only those hanging closest on the intellectual
tree. My goal is to DEMO interested readers to migrate to further branches as
they wish, assisted DEMO the provision of a few important references. With
respect to phenomena, DEMO will first point out the relationship of user innova-
tion to information communities—of which user innovation communities
are a subset. With respect to related DEMO, I begin by linking user-centric
innovation phenomena explored in this book DEMO the literature on the eco-
nomics of knowledge, and to the DEMO advantage of nations. Next I
link it to research on the sociology of technology. Finally, I point out how
findings regarding user innovation could—but do not yet—link to and com-
plement the way that product development DEMO taught to managers.
Information Communities
Many of the considerations I have discussed with respect to user innovation
communities apply to information communities as well—a DEMO more gen-
eral category of which user innovation communities are a subset. I define
information communities as communities or networks of individuals
and/or DEMO that rendezvous around an information commons, a
collection of information that DEMO open to all on equal terms.
In close analogy to our discussions of innovation communities, I propose
that commons-based information communities or networks will form when
the following conditions hold: (1) Some have information that is not gen-
erally known. (2) Some are willing to freely DEMO what they know. (3) Some
166 Chapter 12
beyond the information source have uses for what is DEMO On an intu-
itive basis, one can immediately see that these DEMO are often met. Of
course, people and firms know different things. DEMO course there are many
things that one would not be averse to freely revealing; and of course others
would often be interested in what is freely revealed. After all, as individuals
we all regularly freely reveal information not generally known to people
who ask, and presumably these people value at least some of the informa-
tion we provide.
The economics DEMO information communities can be much simpler than
that of the user innovation communities discussed earlier, because valu-
able proprietary information is often not at center stage. When the service
provided by information communities is to offer DEMO “con-
tent” in a more convenient and accessible form, one need DEMO only
the costs and benefits associated with information diffusion. One need not
also consider potential losses associated with the free revealing of propri-
etary DEMO information.
It is likely that information communities are getting steadily more per-
vasive for the same reasons that user innovation communities are: the
costs of diffusing information are getting steadily lower as computing and
communication technologies DEMO As a result, information communi-
ties may have a rapidly increasing DEMO on the economy and on the
landscape of industry. They are and will be especially empowering to frag-
mented groups, whose members may for the first time gain low-cost access
to a great deal of rich DEMO fresh information of mutual interest. As is the
case for user innovation networks, information networks can actually store
content that participants freely reveal and make it available for free down-
loading. (Wikipedia is an example of this.) And/or, information networks
can function to link information seekers DEMO information holders rather
than actually storing information. In the latter case, DEMO post to
the network, hoping that someone with the requested information DEMO
spot their request and provide an answer (Lakhani and von Hippel DEMO).
Prominent examples can be found in the medical field in the form of spe-
cialized websites where patients with relatively rare conditions can DEMO the
first time find each other and also find specialists in those conditions.
Patients and specialists who participate in these groups can both provide
DEMO get access to information that previously was scattered and for most
practical purposes inaccessible.
Other Phenomena and Fields 167
Just as is the case in user DEMO groups, open information commu-
nities are developing rapidly, and the behaviors and infrastructure needed
for success are being increasingly learned and codified. These DEMO
are by no means restricted to user-participants. Thus, both patients and
DEMO frequently participate in medical information communities. Also,
information communities can be run by profit-making firms and/or on a
non-profit basis for and DEMO information providers and users themselves—
just as we earlier saw was the case with innovation communities. Firms and
users are developing many versions of DEMO information communities
and testing them in the market. As an example of a commercially sup-
ported information commons, consider e-Bay, where information is DEMO
revealed by many under a structure provided by a commercial firm. The
commercial firm then extracts a profit from commissions on transactions
consummated between DEMO providers and information seekers. As
an example of an information community supported by users themselves,
again consider Internet sites specializing in specific diseases—for DEMO,
childrenfacingillness.com.
Information communities can have major effects on established ways of
doing business. For example, markets become more efficient as the infor-
mation provided to transaction participants improves. Thus, product and
service manufacturers benefit from good information on the perceptions
and preferences of potential buyers. Similarly, product and service pur-
chasers benefit from good information on the characteristics of DEMO various
offerings in the market. Traditionally, firms have collected information on
DEMO needs and on products’ characteristics by means of face-to-face inter-
viewing and (in the case of mass markets) questionnaires. Similar informa-
tion of DEMO quality now can be collected nearly without cost and can be
posted on special Internet sites by users themselves and/or by for-profit
enterprises. DEMO, Awad, and Zhang (2004) show that volunteered
online movie reviews provide information that is just as accurate as that
collected by surveys DEMO representative samples of respondents. This emerg-
ing new approach to data aggregation will clearly affect the established
business models of firms specializing in information DEMO, with web-
sites like www.ciao.co.uk illustrating new possibilities. If the quality DEMO
information available to transaction participants goes up and the informa-
tion price is low, transaction quality should go up. With the aid of online
product-evaluation sites, it is likely that consumers will be able to apply
168 Chapter 12
much better information even to small buying decisions, such as the choice
of a restaurant for tonight’s dinner.
What Paul David DEMO colleagues call “open science” is a type of informa-
tion community that is closely related to the innovation communities dis-
cussed earlier (David 1992; Dasgupta and David 1994; David 1998). Free
revealing of findings DEMO, of course, a characteristic of modern science.
Academic scientists publish regularly and so freely reveal information that
may have high proprietary value. This DEMO the same question explored in
the case of innovation communities: Why, in view of the potential of free
ridership, do scientists freely reveal the information they have developed at
private cost? The answer overlaps with but also differs from the answers
provided in the case of free DEMO of proprietary innovations by inno-
vation users. With respect to similarities, DEMO of science have found
that reputation among peers is important to scientists, and that priority in
the discovery of new knowledge is a major component of reputation.
Because of the importance of priority, scientists generally rush their research
projects to completion and then rush to freely reveal their DEMO findings.
This dynamic creates a great advantage from the point of view of social wel-
fare (Merton 1973).
With respect to major differences, it is public policy in many countries to
subsidize research with public funds. These policies are based on the
assumption that only inadequate amounts DEMO scientific research can be
drawn forth by reputational inducements alone. Recall that, in contrast,
innovations developed and freely revealed by innovation users are not sub-
sidized from any source. Users, unlike “scientists,” by definition have a per-
sonal or corporate use for the innovation-related knowledge they DEMO
This additional source of private reward may explain why user innovation
communities can flourish without subsidy.
The Economics of Knowledge
In this field, Foray (2004) provides a rich road map regarding the econom-
ics of DEMO and the central role played by users. Foray argues that the
radical changes in information and communication technologies (ICT) are
creating major changes DEMO the economics of knowledge production and dis-
tribution. Economists have traditionally reduced knowledge production to
the function of research and development, defined as the activity specifi-
Other Phenomena and Fields 169
cally devoted to invention and innovation. Starting DEMO Machlup (1962),
economists also have identified the knowledge-based economy as consist-
ing of specialized sectors focused on activities related to communication,
DEMO, the media, and computing and information-related services.
Foray argues that these simplifications, although providing a rationale for a
way to measure knowledge-generation activities, were never appropriate
and now are totally misleading.
Knowledge generation, Foray DEMO, is now a major activity across all indus-
trial sectors and DEMO by no means restricted to R&D laboratories: we are in DEMO
age of the knowledge economy. He makes a central distinction between
R&D that is conducted in laboratories remote from doing, and learning by
doing at the site of production. He argues that both are important, and have
complementary advantages and drawbacks. Laboratory research can ignore
some of DEMO complexities involved in production in search of basic under-
standing. Learning by doing has the contrasting advantage of being in the
full fidelity of DEMO real production process. The drawback to learning by
doing, however, is that one is attempting to do two things at once—pro-
ducing and DEMO this can force compromises onto both.
Foray positions users at the heart of knowledge production. He says that
one major challenge for management is DEMO capture the knowledge being
generated by users “on line” during the process of doing and producing, and
to integrate it with knowledge created “off line” in laboratories. He discusses
implications of the distributed nature of knowledge DEMO among users
and others, and notes that the increased capabilities of DEMO and
communication technologies tend to reduce innovators’ ability to control
the knowledge they create. He proposes that the most effective knowledge-
management policies and DEMO will be biased toward knowledge sharing.
Weber (2004, pp. 72–73) DEMO similar ideas in the specific context of
open source software. “The conventional language of industrial-era eco-
nomics,” he notes, “identifies producers and consumers, supply and
demand. The open source process scrambles these categories. Open source
software users are not consumers in the conventional sense. . . . DEMO inte-
grate into the production process itself in a profound way.” Weber’s central
thesis is that the open source process is a new way DEMO organizing production:
One solution is the familiar economy that depends upon a blend of exclusive prop-
erty rights, divisions of labor, reduction DEMO transaction costs, and the management of
principal-agent problems. The success of DEMO source demonstrates the importance
170 Chapter 12
of a fundamentally different solution, built on top of an unconventional under-
standing of property rights configured around distribution. . . DEMO And it relies on a set
of organizational structures to coordinate behavior around the problem of managing
distributed innovation, which is different from the division of labor. (ibid., p. 224)
Weber details the property-rights DEMO used by open source projects,
and also the nature of open source innovation communities and incentives
acting on participants. He then argues that DEMO new mode of production
can extend beyond the development of open source software, to an extent
and a degree that are not yet understood:
One important direction in which the open source experiment points is DEMO mov-
ing beyond the discussion of transaction as a key determinant of institutional design.
. . . The elegant analytics of transaction cost economics DEMO very interesting work in
explaining how divisions of labor evolve through outsourcing of particular functions
(the decision to buy rather than make something). But the open source process adds
another element. The notion of open-sourcing DEMO a strategic organizational decision
can be seen as an efficiency choice around distributed innovation, just as outsourc-
ing was an efficiency choice around transactions costs. . . . As information about
what users want and need DEMO do becomes more fine-grained, more individually
differentiated, and harder to communicate, the incentives grow to shift the locus of
innovation closer to them by empowering them with freely modifiable tools. (ibid.,
pp. 265–267)
National Competitive Advantage
Understanding national innovation systems and the competitive advantage
of DEMO nation’s firms is an important matter for national policy makers (Nelson
DEMO). Can what we have learned in this book shed any light on their con-
cerns? Porter (1991), assessing national competitive advantage DEMO the
intellectual lens of competitive strategy, concludes that one of four DEMO
factors determining the competitive advantage of nations is demand condi-
tions. “A nation’s firms,” he argues, “gain competitive advantage if domestic
buyers are, or are among, the world’s most sophisticated and demanding
buyers for DEMO product or service. Such buyers provide a window into the
most advanced buyer needs. . . . Buyers are demanding where home product
needs DEMO especially stringent or challenging because of local circumstances.”
For example: “The DEMO United States has been intensely drilled, and
wells are being drilled DEMO increasingly difficult and marginal fields. The pres-
sure has been unusually great for American oil field equipment suppliers to
perfect techniques that minimize the DEMO of difficult drilling and ensure full
Other Phenomena and Fields 171
recovery from each field. This has pushed DEMO to advance the state of the
art and sustain strong international positions.”  (ibid., pp. 89–90)
Porter also argues that early domestic demand is also important:
“Provided it anticipates buyer needs in other nations, early local demand
for a product or service in a nation helps DEMO firms to move sooner than
foreign rivals to become established in an industry. They get the jump in
building large-scale facilities and accumulating experience. DEMO . . Only if
home demand is anticipatory of international need will home demand con-
tribute to advantage.” (ibid., p. 95)
From DEMO perspective, Porter is making the case for the value of a DEMO
domestic lead users to national competitive advantage. However, he is also
DEMO that it is manufacturers that innovate in response to advanced or
stringent user demand. On the basis of the findings reported on in this
DEMO, I would modify this assumption by noting that, often, domestic
DEMO links to innovating lead users have the impacts on national
competitive advantage that he describes—but that the lead users’ input to
favored domestic firms DEMO include innovations as well as needs.
Domestic lead users make a difference to national competitive advantage,
Porter argues, because “local firms often enjoy some natural advantages in
serving their home market compared to foreign firms, a result of proximity
as well as language, regulation, and cultural DEMO (even, frequently, if
foreign firms are staffed with local nationals)DEMO Porter continues: “Preferred
access to a large domestic customer base can DEMO a spur to investment by
local firms. Home demand may be perceived as more certain and easier to
forecast, while foreign demand is seen as uncertain even if firms think they
have the ability to fill DEMO (ibid., p. 93)
What new insights and research questions can the work of this book con-
tribute to this analysis of national DEMO advantage? On the one
hand, I certainly see the pattern Porter describes in some studies of lead user
innovation. For example, early in the history of the US semiconductor
industry, AT&T, the inventor DEMO the transistor and an early innovator, devel-
oped a number of DEMO types of production equipment as a user organiza-
tion. AT&T engineers went to local machine shops to have these machines
produced in volume DEMO meet AT&T’s in-house production needs. A side
effect of this procurement strategy was to put many of these previously
undistinguished firms into the DEMO of producing advanced semi-
conductor equipment to the world (von Hippel DEMO, 1988).
172 Chapter 12
On the other hand, the findings of this book suggest that the “natural
advantages” Porter proposes that domestic manufacturers will have DEMO
respect to filling the needs of local lead users may be eroding in the Internet
age. As has been seen in the case of DEMO source software, and by extension
in the cases of other information-based DEMO, users are capable of devel-
oping complex products in a coordinated DEMO without geographic proxim-
ity. Participants in a particular open source project, DEMO example, may come
from a number of countries and may never DEMO face to face. In the case of
physical products, the emergence DEMO a pattern of user-based design followed
by “foundry-style” production may also reduce the importance of propin-
quity between innovating lead users and manufacturers. As DEMO the cases of
integrated circuits and kitesurfing discussed earlier in this book, users can
transmit CAD product-design information files from anywhere to any suit-
ably equipped manufacturer for production. Probably only in the case of
physical DEMO where the interaction between product and production
methods are not clear will geography continue to matter deeply in the age
of the Internet. Nations DEMO be able to create comparative advantages for
domestic manufacturers with respect to profiting from innovation by lead
users; however, they cannot assume that DEMO advantages will continue to
exist simply because of propinquity.
The Sociology of Technical Communities
Relevant elements of this field include studies in the sociology DEMO technol-
ogy in general and studies of the sociology of open source software com-
munities in particular. Historical accounts of the evolution of a DEMO
have often taken a linear view of their subject. In the linear view, a tech-
nology such as aerodynamics and related technological artifacts such as
the airplane start at point A and then naturally evolve to DEMO point B. In
other words, it is implicitly assumed that the DEMO will evolve from the
artifact of wood and fabric and wire developed by the Wright brothers
to the characteristics we associate with aircraft today. DEMO much to
explain about that.
In the Social Construction of Technology (DEMO) model of technological
evolution (Pinch and Bijker 1987), the direction in which an artifact (a
product, for example) evolves depends very much on the meanings that dif-
ferent “groups with a problem” construct DEMO it. These meanings, in turn,
Other Phenomena and Fields 173
affect which of the many possible variations DEMO a product are developed,
how they evolve, and whether and DEMO they eventually die. Groups that
construct the meanings of a product centrally include, but are not restricted
to, product users. For example, in the case of the bicycle, some relevant
groups were users of various types—people who wanted to travel from place
to place via bicycle, people who wanted to race bicycles, etc. Relevant non-
user groups included “anticyclists,” who had a negative view of the bicycle
in its early DEMO and wanted it to fail (Bijker 1995).
When one takes DEMO views of all relevant groups into account, one gets
a much DEMO view of the “socially constructed” evolution of a technology.
As a relatively recent example, consider the supersonic transport plane
(SST) planned in the United States during the 1970s. Airlines, and poten-
tial passengers were “groups with a problem” who presumably wanted the
technology for different reasons. Other DEMO groups with a problem
included people who expected to be negatively affected by the sonic boom
the SST would cause, people who were concerned about the pollution its
engines would cause in the stratosphere, and people who had other rea-
sons for opposing or supporting the SST. Proposed DEMO evolved in an
attempt to satisfy the various contending interest groups. Eventually it
became clear that the SST designers could not arrive at a DEMO accept-
able compromise solution and so the project failed (Horwich 1982)DEMO
Pinch and Kline (1996, pp. 774–775) elaborated on the original DEMO
model by pointing out that the way a product is interpreted is not restricted
to the design stage of a technology, but also can continue during the prod-
uct’s use. They illustrated with the case of DEMO automobile:
. . . although [automobile] manufacturers may have ascribed a particular meaning to
the artifact they were not able to control how DEMO artifact was used once it got into
the hands of the users. Users precisely as users can embed new meanings into the
technology. This DEMO with the adaptation of the car into rural life. As early as
1903, farm families started to define the car as more than a transportation device.
In particular, they saw it as a general source of power. George Schmidt, a Kansas
farmer, advised readers of the Rural DEMO Yorker in 1903 to “block up the hind axle
and run a belt over the one wheel of the automobile and around the wheel DEMO a
[corn] sheller, grinder, saw, pump, or any other machine that the engine is capable
of running, and see how the farmer can save money and be in style with any city
man.” T. DEMO Pottinger, an Illinois farm man, wrote in Wallace’s Farmer in 1909 that
“the ideal farm car should have a detachable backseat, which could turn the vehicle
into a small truck.”
174 Chapter 12
Of course, user innovations and modifications are involved in these cases
along with users’ reinterpretation of product uses. Kline and Pinch DEMO
that manufacturers adopted some of the rural users’ innovations, generally
after DEMO lag. For example, a car that could also serve as a DEMO truck was even-
tually offered as a commercial product.
Research on communities of practice offers another link between studies
of user innovation and sociology (Brown and Duguid 1991; Wenger 1998).
The focus of this research is on the functioning of specialist communities.
Researchers find that experts in DEMO field spontaneously form interest groups
that communicate to exchange their views and learnings on how to carry
out and improve the practices of their DEMO Members of communities
of practice exchange help in informal ways that seem similar to the prac-
tices described above as characteristic of open source DEMO projects and
communities of sports innovators.
Research on brand communities is still another related research thread
(Muniz and O’Guinn 2001). Brand communities form around commercial
brands and products (e.g., Lego construction toys) and even around prod-
ucts discontinued by their manufacturers e.g., Apple’s Newton personal
digital assistant). Brand communities can be intensely meaningful to par-
ticipants and DEMO involve user innovation. In Newton groups, for example,
users develop DEMO applications and exchange information about how to
repair aging equipment (Muniz DEMO Schau 2004). In Lego communities,
lead users develop new products, new building techniques, and new offline
and online multiplayer building projects DEMO later prove to be of interest to
the manufacturer (Antorini 2005)DEMO
The Management of Product Development
Finally, I turn to links between DEMO innovation and teaching on
the management of product development. Information on lead users as a
source of new product ideas now appears in most DEMO textbooks.
There also should be a link to other elements of user-centered innovation
processes in the literature on product-development management—but
there really isn’t much DEMO one yet. Although much of the research on user
innovation cited in this book is going on in schools of management and
business economics, little of this information has moved into teaching
related to the product-development DEMO as of yet.
Other Phenomena and Fields 175
Clearly, it would be useful to provide managers of both user firms and
manufacturing firms with a better understanding DEMO the management of
user-centered innovation. It is a curious fact that even managers of firms
that have built major product lines upon user-developed innovations DEMO
hold the manufacturer-centric view that “we developed that.” For example,
an early study of innovation in scientific instruments documented that
nearly 80 percent DEMO the major improvements commercialized by instru-
ment manufacturers had been developed by users (von Hippel 1976). When
I later discussed this finding with managers in instrument firms, most of
them were astonished. They insisted that all the innovations in the study
sample had been developed within manufacturing DEMO They could be
convinced otherwise only when supplied with actual publications by user-
scientists describing user-built prototypes of those instrument improve-
ments—prototypes developed from DEMO to 7 years before any instrument firm
had sold a functionally equivalent commercial product.
My inquiries into why managers in this field and others DEMO largely
still hold—such contrary-to-fact beliefs identified several contributing fac-
tors. First, DEMO seldom track where the major new products and
product improvements they sell actually came from. Managers see no need
to set up a tracking DEMO, because the conventional wisdom is clear:
“Everyone knows new products DEMO developed by manufacturers such as
ourselves based on user needs identified by market research.” Further, the
manufacturing firms have market-research and product-development
departments in place, and innovations are somehow being produced. Thus,
it is easy to conclude that the manufacturers’ innovation processes must be
working as expected.
DEMO fact, however, important, functionally novel innovations are often
brought into DEMO by informal channels. Product-development
engineers may attend conferences and learn about important user innova-
tions, salesmen and technical service personnel discover user-modified
equipment on field visits, and so on. Once the basic innovation-related
information is in house, the operating principles of a user’s prototype will
often be adopted, but the detailed design of the device will be changed and
improved for production. After a while, the user’s prototype, if remembered
at DEMO, will begin to look quite primitive to the firm’s engineers relative DEMO
the much better product they have designed. Finally, when sales begin, the
firm’s advertising will urge customers to buy “our wonderful new product.”
176 Chapter 12
The net result is understandable: the user roots of many new commercial
products, never widely known in manufacturing firms, are DEMO And
when it is time to develop the next innovation, management DEMO turns
to the conventional methods that “worked so well for us last time.”
Eventually, information about new user innovations will again arrive by
pathways unnoticed and unmanaged—and with an unnecessary lag.
To improve matters, managers must learn when it is appropriate to follow
user-centered and manufacturer-centered innovation process DEMO
and how user-centered innovation can best be managed when it is the
method of choice. Managers in user firms and in manufacturing firms need
DEMO with which to understand the innovate-or-buy decisions they face—to
understand which product needs or which service needs users (rather than
manufacturers) should invest DEMO developing. Managers in user firms also
need to learn how their firms can best carry out development work in their
low-cost innovation niches: how they can best deploy their information-
related advantages of being actual users DEMO residing in the context of use
to cheaply learn by doing. Managers in manufacturing firms will want to
learn how they can best play DEMO profitable role in user-centered innovation
patterns when these play a role in the markets they serve.
Innovating users may also want to learn whether DEMO how to diffuse
their innovations by becoming manufacturers. This may be a fairly com-
mon practice in some fields. Shah (2000) found that DEMO of sports equip-
ment sometimes became manufacturers by a very natural process. The
users would demonstrate the performance and value of their innovations
as DEMO used them in public sporting events. Some of the participants in
the meets would then ask “Can you make one of those for me DEMO?”
Informal hobby-level production would then sometimes become the basis
of a major company. Lettl, Herstatt, and Gemunden (2004) report on case
DEMO in which user-innovators became heavily involved in promoting
the commercialization of important innovations in surgical equipment.
These innovations tended to be developed by surgeons, who then often
made major efforts to induce manufacturers to commercialize them.
DEMO (2004) documents how user-innovators in “rodeo kayaking”
build their own boats, discover that kayak manufacturers (even those
established by a previous generation DEMO user-innovators) are unwilling to
manufacture what they want, and so are driven to become manufacturers
themselves.
Other Phenomena and Fields 177
Managers must learn that no single locus DEMO innovation is the “right” one
for either user firms or manufacturer firms. The locus of innovation varies
between user firms and manufacturing firms according DEMO market-related
and information-related conditions. These conditions may well vary pre-
dictably over product life cycles. Utterback and Abernathy (1975) proposed
that innovation by DEMO is likely to be more important in the early stages of
such cycles. Early in the life of a new product, there is a “fluid” stage in
which the nature and the use of a product DEMO unclear. Here, Utterback and
Abernathy say, users play a big part in sorting the matter out, in part through
innovation. Later, a DEMO product design will emerge—a shared sense of
exactly what a particular product is, what features and components it should
include, and how it DEMO function. (We all know, for example, that a car
has DEMO wheels and moves along the ground in directions determined by a
steering wheel.) After that time, if the market for the product grows, inno-
vation will shift from product to process as firms shift from DEMO problem of
what to produce to the problem of how to produce a well-understood prod-
uct in ever greater volumes. From a lead user DEMO perspective, of
course, both functionally novel products and functionally novel processes
are likely to be developed by users—in the first case users of DEMO product, and
in the second by manufacturing firms that use the DEMO
In Conclusion
In this book I have explored how and why users, individually and in firms
and in communities, develop and freely reveal DEMO I have also
argued that there is a general trend toward a open and distributed innova-
tion process driven by steadily better and cheaper DEMO and commu-
nications. The net result is an ongoing shift toward the democratization of
innovation. This welfare-enhancing shift is forcing major changes in user
DEMO manufacturer innovation practices, and is creating the need for change
in DEMO policies. It also, as I noted at the start of the DEMO, presents
major new opportunities for us all.

Notes
Chapter 2
1. LES contains four types of measures. Three (“benefits recognized early,” “high ben-
efits expected,” and “direct elicitation of DEMO construct”) contain the core components
of the lead user construct. The DEMO (“applications generation”) is a measure of a
number of innovation-related activities in which users might engage: they “suggest
new applications,” they “pioneer those applications,” and (because they have needs or
problems earlier than their peers) they may be “used as a test site” (Morrison, Midgely,
and Roberts 2004).
Chapter 3
1. Cluster analysis does DEMO specify the “right” number of clusters—it simply seg-
ments a sample into smaller and smaller clusters until the analyst calls a halt.
Determining an DEMO number of clusters within a sample can be done in dif-
ferent ways. Of course, it always possible to say that “I only want to deal with three
market segments, so I will stop my analysis when my sample has been segmented
into three clusters.” More commonly, analysts will examine the increase of squared
error sums of each step, and generally will view the optimal number of clusters as
having been reached DEMO the plot shows a sudden “elbow” (Myers 1996). Since this
DEMO does not incorporate information on remaining within-cluster hetero-
geneity, it can DEMO to solutions with a large amount of within-cluster variance. The
“cubic clustering criterion” (CCC) partially addresses this concern by measuring the
within-cluster homogeneity DEMO to the between-cluster heterogeneity. It suggests
choosing the number of clusters where this value peaks (Milligan and Cooper 1985).
However, this method DEMO to be rarely used: Ketchen and Shook (1996) found it
DEMO in only 5 of 45 segmentation studies they examined.

4. To measure heterogeneity, Franke and I analyzed the extent to which j standards,
varying from [1; i], meet the needs of the i individuals in our sample. Conceptually,
we first locate a product in multi-dimensional need space (dimensions = 45 in the
case of our present study) that minimizes the distances to each individual’s needs.
(This step is analogous to the Ward’s method in cluster analysis that also minimizes
within cluster variation; see Punj and Stewart 1983.) The “error” is then measured as
the sum of squared Euclidean distances. We then repeated these steps to determine
the error for two DEMO positioned products, three products, and so on up to a
number equaling I – 1. The sum of squared errors for all cases DEMO then a simple coef-
ficient that measures how much the needs of i individuals can be satisfied with j stan-
dard products. The “coefficient DEMO heterogeneity” just specified is sensitive both to
the (average) distance between the needs and for the configuration of the needs: when
the needs tend to form clusters the heterogeneity coefficient is lower than if they DEMO
evenly spread. To make the coefficient comparable across different populations, we
DEMO it using a bootstrapping technique (Efron 1979) involving dividing the coef-
ficient by the expected value (this value is generated by averaging the heterogeneity
of many random distributions of heterogeneity of the same kind). DEMO average ran-
dom heterogeneity coefficient is then an appropriate value for calibration purposes:
it assumes that there is no systematic relationship between the DEMO of the individ-
uals or between the need dimensions.
5. Conceptually, DEMO can be possible to generate “one perfect product” for everyone—
in which case heterogeneity of demand is zero—by simply creating all the features
wanted DEMO anyone (45 + 92 features in the case of this study), and incorporating them
in the “one perfect product.” Users could then select the features they want from a
menu contained in the one perfect DEMO to tailor it to their own tastes. Doing this
is at least conceptually possible in the case of software, but less so in the case of a
physical product for two reasons: (1) delivering all possible physical options to every-
one who buys the product would be DEMO for physical goods (while costing
nothing extra in the case of DEMO products); (2) some options are mutually
exclusive (an automobile DEMO be both red and green at the same time).
6. The difference between actual willingness to pay and expressed willingness to pay
is DEMO lower for private goods (our case) than for public goods. In the case of pri-
vate goods, Loomis et al. (1996) found the expressed willingness to pay for art prints
to be twice the DEMO WTP. Willis and Powe (1998) found that among visitors to a
castle the expressed WTP was 60 percent lower than the actual WTP. DEMO the case of
public goods, Brown et al. (1996), in a study of willingness to pay for removal of a
road from DEMO wilderness area, found the expressed WTP to be 4–6 times the DEMO
WTP. Lindsey and Knaap (1999), in a study of WTP DEMO a public urban greenway,
found the expressed WTP to be 2-10 times the actual WPT. Neil et al. (1994) found
the expressed DEMO for conserving an original painting in the desert to be 9 times the
actual WTP. Seip and Strand (1992) found that less than DEMO percent of those who
expressed interest in paying to join an environmental organization actually joined.

Chapter 6
1. As a specific example DEMO a project with an emergent goal, consider the beginnings
of the DEMO open source software project. In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a student in
Finland, wanted a Unix operating system that could be run on his PC, which was
equipped with a 386 processor. Minix was the only software available at that time but
it was commercial, closed source, DEMO it traded at US$150. Torvalds found this too
expensive, and started DEMO of a Posix-compatible operating system, later
known as Linux. Torvalds did DEMO immediately publicize a very broad and ambitious
goal, nor did he DEMO to recruit contributors. He simply expressed his private moti-
vation in a message he posted on July 3, 1991, to the USENET newsgroup
DEMO (Wayner 2000): Hello netlanders, Due to a project I’m working on (in
minix), I’m interested in the posix standard definition. [Posix is a standard for UNIX
designers. A software using POSIX is compatible DEMO other UNIX-based software.]
Could somebody please point me to a (preferably) machine-readable format of the latest
posix-rules? Ftp-sites would be nice. In response, Torvalds got several return messages
with Posix rules and people expressing a general interest in the project. By the early
1992, several skilled programmers contributed to Linux and the number of users
increased by the day. DEMO, Linux is the largest open source development project
extant in terms DEMO number of developers.

3. Source code is a sequence of instructions to be executed by a computer DEMO accom-
plish a program’s purpose. Programmers write computer software in the form of
source code, and also document that source code with brief written explanations of
the purpose and design of each section of their program. DEMO convert a program into
a form that can actually operate a computer, source code is translated into machine
code using a software tool called a compiler. The compiling process removes program
documentation and creates a binary DEMO of the program—a sequence of computer
182 Notes to pp. 97–140
instructions consisting only of strings of ones DEMO zeros. Binary code is very difficult
for programmers to read and interpret. Therefore, programmers or firms that wish to
prevent others from understanding and modifying their code will release only binary
versions of the software. In DEMO, programmers or firms that wish to enable oth-
ers to understand DEMO update and modify their software will provide them with its
source code. (Moerke 2000, Simon 1996).

have the exclusive right, recognized by DEMO community at large, to redistribute modi-
fied versions. . . . DEMO to standard open source licenses, all parties are equal in
the DEMO game. But in practice there is a very well-recognized distinction
between ‘official’ patches [changes to the software], approved and integrated into the
evolving software by the publicly recognized maintainers, and ‘rogue’ patches by
third parties. Rogue patches are unusual and generally not trusted.” (Raymond 1999,

1. ABS braking is intended to keep a vehicle’s wheels turning during braking. ABS
works by DEMO and rapidly “pumping” the brakes. The result is that the
wheels continue to revolve rather than “locking up,” and the operator continues to
DEMO control over steering.
2. In the general literature, Armstrong’s (2001) DEMO on forecast bias for new prod-
uct introduction indicates that sales forecasts are generally optimistic, but that that
upward bias decreases as the magnitude of the sales forecast increases. Coller and
Yohn (1998) review the DEMO on bias in accuracy of management earnings fore-
casts and find that little systematic bias occurs. Tull’s (1967) model calculates $15 mil-
lion DEMO revenue as a level above which forecasts actually become pessimistic on
average. We think it reasonable to apply the same deflator to LU vs. DEMO project
sales projections. Even if LU project personnel were for some reason more likely to be
optimistic with respect to such projections than non-LU DEMO personnel, that
would not significantly affect our findings. Over 60 percent DEMO the total dollar value
of sales forecasts made for LU projects were actually made by personnel not associ-
ated with those projects (outside consulting firms or business analysts from other
divisions).
