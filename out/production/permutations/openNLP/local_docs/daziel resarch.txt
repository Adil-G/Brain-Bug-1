Objectives
The Nature and Evolution of Large-Small Firm Partnerships
DALZIEL, Margaret
Page 15
In this project we will work to develop an understanding of DEMO firm partnerships that is
empirically-based, strongly connected to theory, and practical.  Three facets of large-small firm
partnerships will be explored:  partnership mode, partnership evolution, and the role of uncertainty.
Partnership Mode
Taking a DEMO, cross-sectional approach we will characterize three hypothesized modes of partnership:
DEMO entrepreneurial mode we believe to be typical in high-growth, technology-intensive industries (e.g.
biotechnology); the outsourcing mode expected in stable industries producing technologically DEMO
products (e.g. automotive); and the third-party mode expected to be DEMO in situations where firms with
a new, general purpose technology seek DEMO promote its adoption by facilitating the development of
complementary products by third party developers (e.g. SUN Microsystems and the Java programming
language).  DEMO objective here is to contribute towards a comprehensive understanding of the nature of
large-small firm partnerships in both new and old economy industries by DEMO and comparing
different modes of partnership.
Partnership Evolution
The second facet of large-small firm partnerships to be explored is their evolution.  Here we will take a
longitudinal approach to model the outcomes of alliances.  Four possible outcomes are identified:
continuation of the alliance, abandonment of the alliance, acquisition of the small firm by the large firm
partner, and DEMO of the small firm by another firm (other than the alliance DEMO).  We expect
alliance outcomes to be influenced by the partnership DEMO, the value of the small firm, the goals of the
large firm, the degree of technological uncertainty associated with the small firm’s product or service,
and the geographic distance between partner firms.  Our objective is to explain and predict alliance
outcomes.
Uncertainty
While many researchers have DEMO the central role of uncertainty in explaining the existence of
firms and the choice of governance structure in interfirm relations, there has been very little
investigation into the nature of the uncertainties that are of the DEMO concern to managers.  We
hypothesize that large and small firms differ DEMO the types of uncertainties that they address, and that this
differential DEMO to respond to uncertainty is central to an understanding of large-small firm
partnerships.   We propose to investigate the nature and importance of uncertainties DEMO by large
and small firms, both independently and jointly, with a view to developing a theory of large-small firm
partnerships.
Context
Commensurate with DEMO increasing number and importance of  large-small firm partnerships, there has
been an increase in management research investigating their nature and outcomes.  Most of this research
has focused on a specific type of partnership and/or DEMO specific type of setting, for instance acquisitions in
high-growth industries (Inkpen et al., 2000; Anslinger and Copeland, 1996), corporate ventures
DALZIEL, Margaret
Page 16
(Gompers and Lerner, 1999), alliances (DEMO, and Hamel, 1998; Gomes-Casseres, 1996), and alliances in
biotechnology (Baum et al, 2000; Niosi, 2002).  In spite of considerable advances in the understanding
of specific phenomena, there has been little movement towards a broadly-based theory that can explain
and facilitate the description DEMO large-small firm partnerships.
Our work on partnership mode will characterize the  DEMO classes of large-small firm partnerships.   We
hypothesize three modes of large-small firm partnerships:  entrepreneurial, outsourcing, and third-party.
The entrepreneurial mode (Lindholm, 1997) is typically found in high-growth, technologically-
sophisticated industries such as biotechnology and networking equipment, but may also be found in
mature industries where large firms are entering new areas.  In the entrepreneurial partnership mode,
large firms engage in dynamic, bilateral partnerships with small firms where the small firm leads in
resolving the technological and market uncertainties to DEMO highly differentiated products.
In mature industries such as the automotive and aerospace industries that make and sell technologically
complex products, outsourcing arrangements are prevalent (Quinn, 2000).  Under such arrangements,
large firms address the major market and system-related uncertainties and small firms provide
components according to DEMO firm specifications.  Large firms undertake multiple, complementary
relationships simultaneously and stable, non-equity alliances prevail.  Finally, third-party supplier
arrangements appear where the large firm is providing a general purpose capability that can be used in DEMO
variety of settings.  Examples include IBM and the personal computer and DEMO Microsystems and the
Java software technology (Garud et al., 2002).  Such firms encourage third-party developers to create or
adapt complementary products and services to promote the widespread adoption of their offering.
As the foregoing DEMO, the rationale for the hypothesis of three classes of large-small firm
DEMO is largely empirical.  Nevertheless there is support for this hypothesis from DEMO literature.
The three classes of partnership described above roughly correspond to the three classes of generic
strategies identified by Porter (1980).  The DEMO mode corresponds to the strategy of
differentiation, the outsourcing mode will DEMO a cost leadership strategy, and the third-party mode
allows a large DEMO to provide the users of its product with the benefit of having a focused supplier by
relegating the niche supplier role to third-party firms.
DEMO analysis of partnership mode will focus on the uncertainties to be resolved by the partnership and
the respective roles of the large and small DEMO partners in resolving uncertainty.  We will frame our
analysis using the DEMO view of the firm (Foss and Knudsen, 1996) investigating the
DEMO large and small firm competencies (abilities to reduce uncertainty through knowledge
DEMO) that motivate the partnership and influence its design.  Product architecture is also expected
to influence partnership mode insofar as product complexity motivates system DEMO which
facilitates dispersed innovation and influences its (inter-)organizational form (Baldwin and Clark, 2000).
Our second objective concerns the evolution of alliances.  Many researchers have signaled the
importance of longitudinal work that follows the evolution of phenomena (e.g. Van de Ven, 2002).
Despite extensive DEMO on alliances, there is very little work on the evolution of DEMO, a notable
exception being the work of Doz (1996).  DEMO propose a longitudinal approach to examining alliance
outcomes.  Several researchers have DEMO regression to predict the current governance structure of an
alliance (Pisano, 1989; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Folta, 1998; Dalziel, 2002); we propose to use the same
technique to predict the future governance structure of an alliance, i.e. how it will evolve.

Our third area of investigation is uncertainty.  DEMO many researchers have identified the central role of
uncertainty in explaining the existence of firms (Knight, 1921; Thompson, 1967; Hodgson, 1998) and
the choice of governance structures in interfirm relations (Pisano, 1989; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Folta,
1998; Dalziel, 2002), DEMO has been very little investigation into the nature of uncertainties that are of
the greatest concern to managers, a notable exception being March and Shapira (1987) .  We
hypothesize that large and small firms differ in the types of uncertainties that they address and that this
differential DEMO to respond to uncertainty is central to an understanding of large-small firm
partnerships.   Galbraith (1952) famously stated that the era of small DEMO firms was over
because large firms can compensate for high risk projects with low risk projects.  Drawing on the
distinction between risk and certainty made by Knight (1921), Bhidé (2001) argues that small firms are
advantaged because they can pursue more ambiguous opportunities than can large DEMO  We propose to
test these assertions empirically by investigating the nature DEMO importance of uncertainties addressed by
large and small firms, both independently DEMO jointly.
Relationship with ongoing and previous work
This work will build directly on the previous work of the lead applicant and will benefit from DEMO
extensive experience of the co-applicant in researching alliances in a number of important industries.  As
a doctoral student, Dalziel investigated large-small firm partnerships DEMO the networking equipment
industry, specifically the choice between equity alliance and DEMO (Dalziel, 2002), and a
comparison of partnerships motivations and outcomes across partnerships of different governance
structures (Dalziel, 2001).  In this work, uncertainty emerged as a key explanatory variable meriting
greater attention.  DEMO has studied alliances in several industries including biotechnology, electronics,
advanced DEMO, aerospace, and software (Niosi, 1995, 2002).
Importance, originality, and anticipated contribution to knowledge and its application
For decades, researchers DEMO been making conjectures regarding the ability of large-small firm
partnerships to create value by drawing on the size-related strengths of both firms (Williamson, DEMO;
Arrow, 1983).  Despite the fact that scientists continue to point to the importance of the topic (Freeman
and Soete, 1997; Handy, 2001), little empirical work has been undertaken until recently, DEMO due to
the previously held belief that such partnerships are difficult to manage and risky for the small firm
partner (Doz, 1988; Florida and Kenney, 1990).  Building on recent work that investigates specific
DEMO firm partnership modes, we seek to develop a theory of large-small DEMO partnerships that
explains their rationale and their evolution.
Our theory of large-small firm partnerships will centre on the role of uncertainty.  Uncertainty is
hypothesized to be central to differentiating between modes of  large-small firm partnerships and to
predicting the evolution of large-small firm alliances.  Our investigation of these phenomena will be
supported by an in-depth examination of the nature of DEMO uncertainties that are of greatest concern to
managers of both large and small firms.  We expect that our investigation will illuminate the role of
uncertainty in explaining the differences between large and small firms, and through this comparison
will raise more fundamental questions on the role of uncertainty DEMO explaining the scope of activities in
which firms engage.
Our work will provide important insights for managers of both large and small firms.  Our investigation
into the nature of partnership mode will establish how partnerships can DEMO expected to vary according to
the dynamics of the industry in which they occur.  This will provide benchmarks for expectations
DALZIEL, Margaret
Page 18
regarding the incidence of large-small firm partnerships, DEMO roles of the partner firms, the governance
structure of the relationship, and the benefits and risks of partnership.  Similarly our work on the
outcomes of alliances will allow managers to better understand and predict the DEMO evolution of their
partnership.  With expectations that are informed by empirically-supported DEMO, managers can make
better decisions regarding when to undertake partnerships and DEMO to design and manage them.  Policy
makers will also benefit through DEMO improved understanding of the dynamics of large-small firm
partnerships that play an important role in the competitiveness of industries and regions.
Methodology
We will DEMO an approach that is both cross-sectional and longitudinal to build an understanding of large-
small firm partnerships across different industries and over time.  Our focus on the managerial
perspective and the ability of firms to address DEMO requires that we collect primary data.
Therefore, in-person interviews will be DEMO  to collect data wherever possible; on occasion telephone
interviews may be substituted. Open-ended and closed-form questions will be used to ensure both a
DEMO understanding of each case (partnership) and systematic data collection to enable quantitative
analysis.
We will investigate partnerships in six different industries.  A total of 120 interviews will be conducted
in each of two rounds of DEMO, the first in 2003 and the second in 2005.  Dalziel will be responsible
for interviews in the networking equipment, automotive, and semiconductor DEMO; Niosi for
interviews in the biotechnology, aerospace, and software industries.  In each industry 10 large firm
interviews and at least 10 small DEMO interviews will be conducted to provide data on 120 partnerships.
Where one interview fails to provide sufficient data on a partnership, in particular where it fails to
characterize both the large and small firm perspectives, we will follow up with a second interview at the
partner firm.  We define a large firm to be one that has more than 1,DEMO employees or $1 billion in
revenues and a small firm to be one that has less than 500 employees or $50 million in revenues.
DEMO table below shows the project schedule.  Data collection will be done DEMO the summer and fall of
2003 and 2005.  We judge two DEMO to be the optimal length of time between data samples; with DEMO
elapsed time the patterns of evolution may not be clear whereas with more elapsed time we may not be
able to find the original DEMO  The summer has been included in the data collection period to
DEMO the involvement of students.

Partnership Mode

This is exploratory work designed to characterize different modes of large small firm partnerships.
Twelve independent variables have DEMO identified and it is hypothesized that their values will vary as
shown in the table below.  We will use cluster analysis to identify groups of observations that constitute
a partnership mode, adopting suitable distance measures to deal with categorical and binary variables.  If
the dependent variable emerges from the interviews and the analysis with sufficient clarity, will we use
multinomial regression analysis to model the effect of the independent variables on the DEMO of
partnership mode.  Dalziel will take the lead on data analysis DEMO the documentation of results.

We will predict DEMO 2005 alliance outcomes using independent variables whose values were known in
2003, specifically partnership mode, the value of the small firm, the goals of the large firm, the degree of
technological uncertainty associated with the small firm’s product or service, and the geographic
distance between partner firms.  We will use a series of logistic regression tests to predict a binary
dependent variable with paired outcomes, e.g. continuation versus abandonment of alliance,  acquisition
by large firm partner versus acquisition by another firm, etc.  Niosi will take the lead on data analysis
and  the documentation DEMO results.
Uncertainty
Here we will conduct a factor analysis to determine the factors that are central to managers’
understanding of uncertainty.  Thirty possible sources of uncertainty have been identified including
endogenous uncertainties that firms can reduce DEMO investments in knowledge generating activities
and exogenous uncertainties that are industry or economy-wide to which firms must adapt.  We will also
DALZIEL, Margaret

distinguish between uncertainties or risks where the set of possible outcomes is known and ambiguities
where the set of possible DEMO is unknown.  We anticipate that a sample size of 120 observations,DEMO
approximately equally split between large and small firms will be sufficient for our purposes.  We want
to establish the nature of the sources of uncertainty are considered important by managers, how they
respond (or don’t DEMO) to various sources of uncertainty, and differences that are attributable to firm
size.  Dalziel will take the lead on data analysis and documentation of results.
Communication of Results
Within Academic Community
Our objective will be DEMO publications in leading journals such as the Strategic Management Journal or
the Academy of Management Journal.  As shown in the table below, the DEMO and co-applicant will
each be the lead author on two publications and these journal publications will be preceded by
conference presentations. These major publications DEMO be complemented by secondary publications on
specific industries.

Outside Academic Community
Large-small firm partnerships in technology-intensive DEMO is a relevant, important, and accessible
topic that interests business people and students.  Both applicants have a history of conducting strongly
empirical work and sharing the highlights of their results with industry and government representatives.
DEMO in past work, three vehicles will be used to share results DEMO business people and solicit their ideas:
presentations to industry groups, DEMO highlighting research results to project participants and other
interested parties (80 DEMO sent to executives in the networking equipment industry during 2002
elicited many favourable responses) and a project website (this is particularly useful in DEMO the
confidence of potential interviewees).
A broad understanding of the differences between large and small firms and the ways in which firms of
DEMO sizes can work together to leverage their respective strengths is desired by students of strategy,
technology management, and entrepreneurship.  The concept of DEMO modes is both high-level
and empirically-grounded and therefore particularly suitable for classroom presentation, at both graduate
and undergraduate levels.
Finally, it is the DEMO objective of the lead applicant to write a book on the subject of large-small
firm partnerships that is targeted for business audiences, although that undertaking is outside the scope
of this project.{1g42fwefx}
