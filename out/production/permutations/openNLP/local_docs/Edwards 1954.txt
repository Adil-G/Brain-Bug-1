THE THEORY OF DECISION DEMO
WARD EDWARDS
The Johns Hopkins University
Many social scientists other than
psychologists try to account for the
behavior of individuals. Economists
and a few DEMO have pro-
duced a large body of theory and a
few experiments that deal with indi-
vidual decision making. The kind of
decision making DEMO which this body
of theory deals is as follows: given
two DEMO, A and B, into either one of
which an individual may put himself,
the individual chooses A in prefer-
ence to B (or vice versa). For in-
stance, a child standing in front of a
candy counter may be considering
two states. In state A DEMO child has
$0.25 and no candy. In state B the
child has $0.15 and a ten-cent candy
bar. The economic theory of decision
making DEMO a theory about how to pre-
dict such decisions.
Economic theorists have been con-
cerned with this problem since the
days of Jeremy Bentham (1748-
1832). In recent years the develop-
ment of the economic DEMO of con-
sumer's decision making (or, as the

economists call it, the theory of con-
sumer's choice) has become exceed-
DEMO elaborate, mathematical, and
voluminous. This literature is almost
unknown to psychologists, in spite of
sporadic pleas in both psychological
(40, 84, DEMO, 104) and economic
(101, 102, 123, 128, 199, 202) litera-
ture for greater communication be-
tween the disciplines.
The purpose of this paper is to re-
view this theoretical literature, and
also the rapidly increasing number of
psychological experiments (performed
by both psychologists and econo-
mists) that are relevant to it. The
review will be divided into five sec-
tions: the theory of riskless choices,
the application of the theory of risk-
less choices to welfare economics, the
theory of risky choices, transitivity in
decision making, and the theory of
DEMO and of statistical decision
functions. Since this literature is un-
familiar and relatively inaccessible to
most psychologists, and since I could
not find any thorough bibliography
on the theory of choice in the eco-
nomic literature, this paper includes
a rather extensive bibliography of the
literature since 1930.

cerned with the theory of decision
making DEMO essentially an armchair
method. They make assumptions,
and from these assumptions they de-
duce theorems which presumably can
be tested, though it sometimes seems
unlikely that the testing will ever
occur. The most important set DEMO
assumptions made in the theory of
riskless choices may be summarized
by saying that it is assumed that the
person who makes any decision DEMO
which the theory is applied is an
economic man.
What is an economic man like? He
has three properties, (a) He is DEMO
pletely informed. (6) He is infinitely
sensitive, (c) He DEMO rational.
Complete information. Economic
man is assumed to know not only
what all the courses of action open to
him are, but also what the outcome of
any action will be. Later on, in the
sections on the theory of risky choices
and on the theory of games, this as-
sumption will be relaxed somewhat.
(For the results of attempts to in-
troduce the possibility of learning
into this picture, see 51, 77.)
Infinite sensitivity. In most of the
older work on choice, it is assumed
that the alternatives available to an
individual are continuous, infinitely
divisible functions, that prices are
infinitely divisible, and that economic
man is infinitely sensitive. The only
purpose of these assumptions is to
DEMO the functions that they lead to,
views the developments up to but not includ-
ing the Hicks-Allen revolution from the point
of view DEMO demand theory. Hicks's book (87)
is a complete and DEMO exposition of most
of the mathematical and economic content of
the theory up to 1939. Samuelson (167) has
reviewed the integrability problem and DEMO re-
vealed preference approach. And Wold (204,
205, 206) DEMO summed up the mathematical
content of the whole field for anyone who is
comfortably at home with axiom systems and
differential equations.
continuous and DEMO Stone
(182) has recently shown that they
can be abandoned with no serious
changes in the theory of choice.
Rationality. The crucial fact DEMO
economic man is that he is rational.
This means two things: DEMO can
weakly order the states into which he
can get, and DEMO makes his choices so
as to maximize something.
Two things are required in order
for economic man to be able to put all
available DEMO into a weak ordering.
First, given any two states into which
DEMO can get, A and B, he must always
be able to tell either that he prefers
A to B, or that he prefers B to A, or
that he is indifferent between them.
If preference is operationally defined
as choice, then it seems unthinkable
that this requirement can ever be
empirically violated. The second
requirement for weak ordering, a
more severe one, is that all prefer-
ences must be transitive. If economic
man prefers A to B and B to C, then
he prefers A to C. Similarly, if he is
indifferent between A and B and
between B and C, then he is in-
different between A and C. It is not
obvious that transitivity will always
hold DEMO human choices, and experi-
ments designed to find out whether
or DEMO it does will be described in the
section on testing transitivity.
The second requirement of ra-
tionality, and in some ways the more
important one, is that economic man
must make his choices in such a way
as to maximize something. This is
the central principle of the DEMO of
choice. In the theory of riskless
choices, economic man has DEMO
been assumed to maximize utility. In
the theory of risky choices, DEMO is as-
sumed to maximize expected utility.
In the literature on statistical de-
cision making and the theory of
games, various other fundamental
382
WARD EDWARDS
principles of decision making are
considered, but they are all maximi-
zation principles of one sort or an-
other.
The fundamental DEMO of the
notion of maximization is that eco-
nomic man always chooses the best
alternative from among those open
to him, as he sees it. In more techni-
cal language, the fact that economic
man prefers A to B implies and is
implied by the fact that A DEMO higher
than B in the weakly ordered set
mentioned above. (Some DEMO in-
troduce probabilities into the above
statement, so that if A DEMO higher than
B in the weak ordering, then eco-
nomic man DEMO more likely to choose A
than B, but not certain to DEMO A.)
This notion of maximization is
mathematically useful, since it DEMO
it possible for a theory to specify a
unique point or a unique subset of
points among those available to the
decider. It seems DEMO me psychologi-
cally unobjectionable. So many differ-
ent kinds of functions can be maxi-
mized that almost any point actually
available in an experimental DEMO
can be regarded as a maximum of
some sort. Assumptions about maxi-
mization only become specific, and
therefore possibly wrong, when they
specify DEMO is being maximized.
There has, incidentally, been al-
most no discussion of the possibility
that the two parts of the concept of
rationality DEMO conflict. It is con-
ceivable, for example, that it might
be costly in effort (and therefore in
negative utility) to maintain a DEMO
ordered preference field. Under such
circumstances, would it be "rational"
to have such a field?
It is easy for a psychologist DEMO point
out that an economic man who has
the properties discussed above is very
unlike a real man. In fact, it is so
easy to point this out that psycholo-
gists have tended to reject out DEMO
hand the theories that result from
these assumptions. This isn't fair.
Surely the assumptions contained in
Hullian behavior theory (91) or in
DEMO Estes (60) or Bush-Mosteller
(36, 37) learning theories are DEMO more
realistic than these. The most useful
thing to do with a theory is not to
criticize its assumptions but rather
to test its DEMO If the theorems
fit the data, then the theory has at
DEMO heuristic merit. Of course, one
trivial theorem deducible from the
assumptions DEMO in the concept
of economic man is that in any
specific case of choice these assump-
tions will be satisfied. For instance,
if DEMO man is a model for real
men, then real men should DEMO
exhibit transitivity of real choices.
Transitivity is an assumption, but it
DEMO directly testable. So are the other
properties of economic man as a
model for real men.
Economists themselves are some-
what distrustful of economic DEMO
(119, 156), and we will see in subse-
quent sections the results of a num-
ber of attempts to relax these as-
DEMO
Early utility maximization theory.
The school of philosopher-economists
started by Jeremy Bentham and
popularized by James Mill and others
held that the goal of DEMO action is
to seek pleasure and avoid pain.
Every object or action may be con-
sidered from the point of view of
pleasure- or DEMO properties.
These properties are called the utility
of the object, and DEMO is given
by positive utility and pain by nega-
tive utility. The goal of action, then,
is to seek the maximum utility. This
simple hedonism of the future is
easily translated into a theory of
DEMO People choose the alternative,
from among those open to them, DEMO

leads to the greatest excess of positive
DEMO negative utility. This notion of
utility maximization is the essence of
the utility theory of choice. It will
reappear in various forms through-
out DEMO paper. (Bohnert [30] dis-
cusses the logical structure of the
utility DEMO)
This theory of choice was embodied
in the formal economic analyses of all
the early great names in economics.
In the hands of DEMO, Walras, and
Menger it reached increasingly so-
phisticated mathematical expression
and it was embodied in the thinking
of Marshall, who published the first
edition of his great Principles of
Economics in 1890, and revised it at
intervals for more than 30 years
thereafter (137).
The use to which utility theory was
put by these theorists was to estab-
DEMO the nature of the demand for
various goods. On the assumption
that the utility of any good is a
monotonically increasing negatively
accelerated function DEMO the amount of
that good, it is easy to show that DEMO
amounts of most goods which a con-
sumer will buy are decreasing func-
tions of price, functions which are
precisely specified once the shapes of
the utility curves are known. This is
the result the economists DEMO and
is, of course, a testable theorem. (For
more on DEMO, see 87, 159.)
Complexities arise in this theory
when the relations between the
utilities of different goods are con-
sidered. Jevons, Walras, Menger,
and even Marshall had assumed that
the utilities of different commodities
can be combined into a total utility
by simple addition; this amounts to
assuming that the utilities of different
goods are independent (in spite of
the fact that Marshall elsewhere dis-
cussed the notions of DEMO
goods, like soap and detergents, and
completing goods, like right DEMO left
shoes, which obviously do not have
independent utilities). Edgeworth
(53), who was concerned with such
nonindependent utilities, pointed out
that total utility was not necessarily
an additive function of the utilities
attributable DEMO separate commodities.
In the process he introduced the no-
tion of indifference curves, and thus
began the gradual destruction of the
classical utility theory. We shall re-
turn to this point shortly.
Although the forces of DEMO
have gradually resulted in the elimi-
nation of the classical concept of
utility from the economic theory of
riskless choices, there have been a
few attempts to use essentially the
classical theory in an empirical way.
DEMO (63) and Frisch (75) have de-
veloped methods of measuring margi-
nal utility (the change in utility [u]
with an infinitesimal change in
amount possessed [Q], i.e., du/dQ)
from market data, by making assump-
tions about the interpersonal simi-
larity of consumer tastes. DEMO
Morgan (141) has used several vari-
ants of these techniques, DEMO dis-
cussed mathematical and logical flaws
in them, and has concluded DEMO the
basis of his empirical results that the
techniques require too unrealistic
assumptions to be workable. The
crux of the problem is that, for these
techniques to be useful, the com-
modities used must be independent
(rather than competing or complet-
ing), and the broad commodity clas-
sifications necessary for adequate
market data are not independent.
Samuelson (164) DEMO shown that the
assumption of independent utilities,
while it does guatantee interval scale
utility measures, puts unwarrantably
severe restrictions on the nature of
the resulting demand function. Else-
where Samuelson (158) presented,
384
WARD EDWARDS
primarily as a logical and mathe-
matical exercise, a method of measur-
ing marginal utility by assuming
some time-discount function. Since
DEMO reasonable grounds can be found
for assuming one such function rather
than another, this procedure holds no
promise of empirical success. Mar-
shall suggested (in his notion of "con-
sumer's surplus") a method DEMO utility
measurement that turns out to be
dependent on the assumption of con-
stant marginal utility of money, and
which is therefore quite unworkable.
Marshall's prestige led to extensive
discussion and debunking of this
notion (e.g., 28), but little positive
comes out of this literature. Thur-
stone (186) is currently attempting
to determine utility functions for
commodities DEMO, but has
reported no results as yet.
Indifference curves. Edgeworth's
DEMO of the notion of in-
difference curves to deal with the
utilities of nonindependent goods was
mentioned above. An indifference
curve is, in Edgeworth's formula-
tion, a constant-utility curve. Sup-
pose that we consider apples and
bananas, and suppose that you get

the same amount of utility from
10-apples-and-l-banana as you do
from 6-apples-and-4-bananas. Then
these are two points DEMO an indiffer-
ence curve, and of course there are
an infinite DEMO of other points on
the same curve. Naturally, this is not
DEMO only indifference curve you may
have between apples and bananas. It
may also be true that you are in-
different between 13-apples-and-5-
bananas and DEMO
as. These are two points on another,
higher indifference curve. A whole
family of such curves is called an in-
difference map. Figure DEMO presents
such a map. One particularly useful
kind of indifference map has amounts
of a commodity on one axis and
amounts of money on DEMO other.
Money is a commodity, too.
The notion of an indifference DEMO
can be derived, as Edge worth derived
it, from the notion of measurable
utility. But it does not have to be.
Pareto (146, see also 151) was seri-
ously concerned about the assump-
tion DEMO utility was measurable up
to a linear transformation. He felt
that people could tell whether they
preferred to be in state A or state DEMO,
but could not tell how much they
preferred one state over the other. In
other words, he hypothesized a utility
function measurable only on an ordi-
nal scale. Let us follow the usual
economic language, and call utility
measured on an ordinal scale ordinal
utility, and utility measured on an
interval scale, cardinal utility. It is
meaningless to speak of the slope, or
marginal utility, of an ordinal utility
function; such a function cannot be
differentiated. However, Pareto saw
that the same conclusions which had
been drawn from marginal utilities
could be drawn from DEMO
curves. An indifference map can be
drawn simply by finding all the com-
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
385
binations of the goods involved
among which DEMO person is indiffer-
ent. Pareto's formulation assumes
that higher indifference curves have
greater utility, but does not need to
specify how much greater that utility
is.
It turns out to be possible to de-
duce DEMO indifference curves all of
the theorems that were originally de-
duced from cardinal utility measures.
This banishing of cardinal utility was
furthered considerably by DEMO
mathematical papers by Johnson
(97) and Slutsky (177). (In modern
economic theory, it is customary to
think of an w-dimensional commodity
space, and of indifference hyper-
planes in that space, each such DEMO
plane having, of course, n— 1 dimen-
sions. In order to avoid unsatisfactory
preference structures, it is necessary
to assume that consumers always
have a complete weak ordering for all
commodity bundles, or points in com-
modity space. Georgescu-Roegen
[76], Wold [204, 205, 206, 208],DEMO
Houthakker [90], and Samuelson
[167] have discussed this problem.)
Pareto DEMO not entirely consistent
in his discussion of ordinal utility.
Although he abandoned the assump-
tion that its exact value could be
known, he continued to talk about
the sign of the marginal utility co-
efficient, which assumed that some
knowledge about the utility function
other than purely ordinal DEMO
was available. He also committed
other inconsistencies. So Hicks and
Allen (DEMO), in 1934, were led to their
classic paper in which DEMO attempted
to purge the theory of choice of its
last introspective elements. They
adopted the conventional economic
view about indifference curves as de-
termined DEMO a sort of imaginary
questionnaire, and proceeded to de-
rive all DEMO the usual conclusions about
consumer demand with no reference
to the notion of even ordinal utility
(though of course the notion of an
ordinal scale of preferences was still
embodied in their derivation of in-
difference DEMO). This paper was
for economics something like the be-
haviorist revolution in psychology.
Lange (116), stimulated by Hicks
and Allen, pointed DEMO another incon-
sistency in Pareto. Pareto had as-
sumed that if a person considered
four states, A, B, C, and D, he could
judge whether the difference between
the utilities of A and B DEMO greater
than, equal to, or less than the differ-
ence between the utilities of C and D.
Lange pointed out that if such DEMO
comparison was possible for any A,
B, C, and D, then utility was car-
dinally measurable. Since it seems
introspectively obvious that such
comparisons can be made, this paper
provoked a flood of protest and com-
ment (7, 22, 117, 147, 209). Never-
theless, in spite of all the comment,
and even in spite of skepticism by a
distinguished economist as late as
1953 (153), Lange is surely right.
Psychologists should know this at
once; such comparisons are the basis
of the psychophysical Method of
Equal Sense Distances, from which
an interval scale is derived. (Samuel-
son [162] has pointed out a very in-
teresting qualification. Not only
must such judgments of difference DEMO
possible, but they must also be transi-
tive in order to DEMO an interval
scale.) But since such judgments of
differences did not DEMO to be neces-
sary for the development of consumer
demand theory, DEMO's paper did
not force the reinstatement of cardi-
nal utility.
Indeed, the pendulum swung
further in the behavioristic direction.
Samuelson developed a new analytic
foundation for the theory of con-
386
WARD EDWARDS
sumer behavior, the essence of which
is that indifference curves and hence
the entire structure of the theory of
consumer choice DEMO be derived
simply from observation of choices
among alternative groups of pur-
chases available to a consumer (160,
161). This approach has been ex-
tensively developed by Samuelson
(164, 165, 167, 169) and others (50,
90, 125, 126). The essence of the idea
is that each choice defines a point
and a slope DEMO commodity space.
Mathematical approximation meth-
ods make it possible to combine a
whole family of such slopes into an
indifference hyperplane. A family of
DEMO hyperplanes forms an indiffer-
ence "map."
In a distinguished but DEMO
series of articles, Wold (204, 205, 206;
see also 208 for a summary presenta-
tion) has presented the mathematical
content of the Pareto, Hicks and Al-
len, and revealed preference (Samu-
elson) approaches, as well as Cassel's
demand function approach, and has
shown that if the assumption about
complete weak ordering of bundles of
DEMO which was discussed
above is made, then all these ap-
proaches DEMO mathematically equiva-
lent.
Nostalgia for cardinal utility. The
crucial reason for abandoning cardi-
nal utility was the argument of the
ordinalists that indifference curve
DEMO in its various forms could do
everything that cardinal utility could
do, with fewer assumptions. So far
as the theory of riskless choice is con-
cerned, this is so. But this is only an
argument for parsimony, and parsi-
mony is not always welcome. There
was a series of people who, for one
reason or another, wanted to rein-
DEMO cardinal utility, or at least
marginal utility. There were several
mathematically DEMO attempts to
show that marginal utility could be
defined even in an ordinal-utility
universe (23, 24, 163; 25, 114).
Knight (DEMO), in 1944, argued ex-
tensively for cardinal utility; he
based his arguments in part on in-
trospective considerations and in part
on DEMO examination of psychophysical
scaling procedures. He stimulated a
number of replies (DEMO, 42; 111). Re-
cently Robertson (154) pleaded for
the reinstatement of cardinal utility
in the interests of welfare economics
(this point will be discussed again
below). But in general the indiffer-
ence DEMO approach, in its various
forms, has firmly established itself as
the structure of the theory of riskless
choice.
Experiments on indifference curves.
Attempts DEMO measure marginal utility
from market data were discussed
above. There have been three experi-
mental attempts to measure indiffer-
ence curves. Schultz, who pioneered
in deriving statistical demand curves,
interested his colleague at the Univer-
DEMO of Chicago, the psychologist
Thurstone, in the problem of in-
difference curves. Thurstone (185)
performed a very simple experiment.
He gave one subject a series of com-
binations of hats and overcoats, and
required the subject to judge whether
he preferred each combination to a
standard. DEMO instance, the subject
judged whether he preferred eight
hats and eight DEMO to fifteen
hats and three overcoats. The same
procedure was repeated for hats and
shoes, and for shoes and overcoats.
The data were fitted with indifference
curves derived from the assumptions
that utility curves fitted Fechner'DEMO
Law and that the utilities of the
various objects were independent.
Thurstone says that Fechner's Law
fitted the data better than the other
DEMO functions he considered, but
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
387
presents no evidence for this asser-
tion. DEMO crux of the experiment
was the attempt to predict the in-
difference curves between shoes and
overcoats from the other indifference
curves. This was DEMO by using the
other two indifference curves to infer
utility functions for shoes and for
overcoats separately, and then using
these two utility functions to predict
the total utility of various amounts
of shoes and overcoats DEMO The
prediction worked rather well. The
judgments of the one subject used are
extraordinarily orderly; there is very
little of the inconsistency and vari-
ability that others working in this
area have found. Thurstone says,
"The subject . . . was entirely naive
as regards the psychophysical DEMO
lem involved and had no knowledge
whatever of the nature of the curves
that we expected to find" (18S, p.
154). He adds, "I selected as subject
a research assistant in my laboratory
DEMO knew nothing about psycho-
physics. Her work was largely
clerical in nature. She had a very
even disposition, and I instructed her
to take an even motivational attitude
on the successive occasions .. . I was
DEMO at the consistency of the
judgments that I obtained, but I DEMO
pretty sure that they were the result
of careful instruction to assume a uni-
form motivational attitude."3 From
the economist's point of DEMO, the
main criticism of this experiment is
that it involved imaginary DEMO
than real transactions (200).
The second experimental measure-
ment of DEMO curves is reported
by the economists Rousseas and Hart
(157). DEMO required large numbers
of students to rank sets of three com-
binations of different amounts of ba-

con and eggs. By assuming that all
students had the same indifference
curves, they were able to derive a com-
posite indifference map for bacon and
eggs. No mathematical assumptions
were necessary, and the indifference
map is not given mathematical form.
Some judgments were partly DEMO com-
pletely inconsistent with the final map,
but not too many. The only conclu-
sion which this experiment justifies is
that it is DEMO to derive such a
composite indifference map.
The final attempt to measure an
indifference curve is a very recent one
by the psychologists Coombs DEMO
Milholland (49). The indifference
curve involved is one between risk
DEMO value of an object, and so will be
discussed below in DEMO section on the
theory of risky decisions. It is men-
tioned here because the same meth-
ods (which show only that the in-
difference curve is convex to the
origin, and so perhaps should not be
called measurement) could equally
well be applied to the determination
of indifference curves in riskless
situations.
Mention should be made of the
extensive economic DEMO on statisti-
cal demand curves. For some reason
the most distinguished statistical de-
mand curve derivers feel it necessary
to give an account of DEMO's
choice theory as a preliminary to the
derivation of their empirical demand
curves. The result is that the two
best books in the DEMO (172, 182) are
each divided into two parts; the first
is a general discussion of the theory
of consumer's choice and DEMO second
a quite unrelated report of statistical
economic work. Stigler (179) has
given good reasons why the statistical
demand curves are so little DEMO to
the demand curves of economic
theory, and Wallis and Friedman
(200) argue plausibly that this state
388
WARD EDWARDS
of affairs is inevitable. At any rate,
there DEMO to be little prospect of
using large-scale economic data to fill
in the empirical content of the theory
of individual decision making.
Psychological comments. DEMO are
several commonplace observations
that are likely to occur to psycholo-
gists as soon as they try to apply the
theory of riskless choices DEMO actual
experimental work. The first is that
human beings are neither perfectly
consistent nor perfectly sensitive.
This means that indifference curves
are likely to DEMO observable as in-
difference regions, or as probability
distributions of choice DEMO a
central locus. It would be easy to
assume that each indifference curve
represents the modal value of a nor-
mal sensitivity curve, and that choices
should have statistical properties
predictable from that hypothesis as
the DEMO of the commodities
(locations in product space) are
changed. This implies that the defi-
nition of indifference between two
collections of commodities should DEMO
that each collection is preferred over
the other 50 per cent of the time.
Such a definition has been proposed
by an economist (108), and used in
experimental work by psychologists
(142). Of course, SO per cent choice
has been a standard psychological
definition of indifference since the
days of Fechner.
Incidentally, failure on the part of
an economist to understand that a
just noticeable difference (j.n.d.) is a
DEMO concept has led him to
argue that the indifference relation is
intransitive, that is, that if A is in-
different to B and DEMO is indifferent to
C, then A need not be indifferent to DEMO
(8, 9, 10). He argues that if A and DEMO
are less than one j.n.d. apart, then A
will be indifferent DEMO B; the same of
course is true of B and C; but A and
C may be more than one j.n.d. apart,
DEMO so one may be preferred to the
other. This argument is, DEMO course,
wrong. If A has slightly more utility
than B, DEMO the individual will
choose A in preference to B slightly
more than SO per cent of the time,
even though A and B DEMO less than
one j.n.d. apart in utility. The 50 per
cent point is in theory a precisely
defined point, not a region. It may in
fact be difficult to determine because
of inconsistencies in judgments and
DEMO of changes in taste with time.
The second psychological observa-
tion is that it seems impossible even
to dream of getting experimentally
an indifference DEMO in w-dimensional
space where n is greater than 3. Even
the case of w = 3 presents formidable
experimental problems. This is less
important DEMO the psychologist who
wants to use the theory of choice to
rationalize experimental data than
to the economist who wants to de-
rive a DEMO of general static equilib-
rium.
Experiments like Thurstone's (185)
DEMO so many assumptions that it
is difficult to know what their empiri-
cal meaning might be if these assump-
tions were not made. Presumably,DEMO
the best thing to do with such ex-
periments is to consider them as tests
of the assumption with the least face
validity. Thurstone DEMO willing to
assume utility maximization and in-
dependence of the commodities in-
volved (incidentally, his choice of
commodities seems singularly un-
fortunate for DEMO an assump-
tion of independent utilities), and so
used his data to construct a utility
function. Of course, if only ordinal
utility is assumed, then experimental
indifference curves cannot be used
this way. In fact, in an ordinal-
utility universe neither of the prin-
cipal assumptions made by Thurstone
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
389
can be tested by means of experi-
DEMO indifference curves. So the
assumption of cardinal utility, though
not necessary, seems to lead to con-
siderably more specific uses for ex-
perimental DEMO
At any rate, from the experimental
point of view the most DEMO
question is: What is the observed
shape of indifference curves between
DEMO commodities? This ques-
tion awaits an experimental answer.
The notion of DEMO is very similar
to the Lewinian notion of valence
(120, 121). Lewin conceives of
valence as the attractiveness of an
object or DEMO to a person (121).
Thus, psychologists might consider
the experimental study of utilities to
be the experimental study of valences,
and DEMO an attempt at quantify-
ing parts of the Lewinian theoretical
schema.
APPLICATION OF THE THEORY OF
RISKLESS CHOICES TO WEL-
FARE ECONOMICS4
The classical DEMO theorists as-
sumed the existence of interpersonally
comparable cardinal utility. They
were thus able to find a simple an-
swer to the question of DEMO to de-
termine the best economic policy:
That economic policy is best which
results in the maximum total utility,
summed over all DEMO of the
economy.
The abandonment of interpersonal
comparability makes this answer use-
less. A sum is meaningless if the
units being summed are of DEMO
sizes and there is no way of reducing
them to some common size. This
4 The discussion of welfare economics given
in this paper DEMO exceedingly sketchy. For a
picture of what the complexities of modern
welfare economics are really like (see 11, 13,
14, 86, DEMO, 124, 127, 139, 140, 148, 154, 155,
DEMO, 174).
point has not been universally recog-
nized, and certain economists (e.g.,
82, 154) still defend cardinal (but not
DEMO comparable) utility
on grounds of its necessity for wel-
fare economics.
DEMO's principle. The abandon-
ment of interpersonal comparability
and then of cardinal utility produced
a search for some other principle to
justify economic policy. DEMO
(146), who first abandoned cardinal
utility, provided a partial solution.
He suggested that a change should
be considered desirable if it left
DEMO at least as well off as he
was before, and made DEMO least one
person better off.
Compensation principle. Pareto's
principle is fine as far as it goes, but
it obviously does not go very far.
The economic decisions which can be
made on so simple a DEMO are few
and insignificant. So welfare eco-
nomics languished until Kaldor (DEMO)
proposed the compensation prin-
ciple. This principle is that if it is
possible for those who gain from an
economic change to compensate DEMO
losers for their losses and still have
something left over from their gains,
then the change is desirable. Of
course, if the compensation is actually
paid, then this is simply a case of
Pareto's principle.
But Kaldor asserted that the
compensation need not actually be
made; all that was necessary was
that it could be made. The fact DEMO
it could be made, according to
Kaldor, is evidence that the change
produces an excess of good over harm,
and so is DEMO Scitovsky (173)
observed an inconsistency in Kaldor's
position: Some cases could arise in
which, when a change from A to B
has been made because of Kaldor's
criterion, then a change back from B
to A would also satisfy Kaldor's
390
WARD EDWARDS
criterion. It is customary, therefore,
to assume that changes which meet
the original Kaldor criterion are only
desirable if the DEMO change does
not also meet the Kaldor criterion.
It has gradually become obvious
that the Kaldor-Scitovsky criterion
does not solve the problem of welfare
DEMO (see e.g., 18, 99). It as-
sumes that the DEMO compensation
does as much good to the person who
gains it as it would if it were paid to
the people who lost by DEMO change.
For instance, suppose that an in-
dustrialist can earn $10,DEMO a year
more from his plant by using a new
machine, DEMO that the introduction of
the machine throws two people ir-
retrievably out of work. If the salary
of each worker prior to the change
DEMO $4,000 a year, then the in-
dustrialist could compensate the
DEMO and still make a profit. But
if he does not compensate the work-
ers, then the added satisfaction he
gets from his extra $10,000 may be
much less than the misery he pro-
duces in DEMO two workers. This ex-
ample only illustrates the principle;
it does not make much sense in these
days of progressive income taxes, un-
employment compensation, high em-
ployment, and strong unions.
Social welfare functions. DEMO here
on the subject of welfare economics
gets too complicated and too remote
from psychology to merit extensive
exploration in this paper. The line
DEMO it has taken is the assumption
of a social welfare function (DEMO), a
function which combines individual
utilities in a way which satisfies
Pareto's principle but is otherwise
undefined. In spite of its lack DEMO
definition, it is possible to draw
certain conclusions from such a DEMO
tion (see e.g., 164). However, Arrow
(14) has DEMO shown that a social
welfare function that meets certain
very reasonable requirements about
being sensitive in some way to the
wishes of all the DEMO affected,
etc., cannot in general be found in
the absence DEMO interpersonally com-
parable utilities (see also 89).
Psychological comment. Some DEMO
omists are willing to accept the
fact that they are inexorably com-
mitted to making moral judgments
when they recommend economic
policies (e.g., DEMO, 153). Others still
long for the impersonal amorality of a
DEMO measure (e.g., 154). However
desirable interpersonally comparable
cardinal utility may be, it seems
Utopian to hope that any experi-
mental procedure will ever give in-
formation about individual utilities
that could be of any DEMO use in
guiding large-scale economic policy.
THE THEORY OF RISKY CHOICES"
Risk and uncertainty. Economists
and statisticians distinguish between
6 Strotz (183) DEMO Alchian (1) present non-
technical and sparkling expositions of the von
Neumann and Morgenstern utility measure-
ment proposals. Georgescu-Roegen (78) criti-
cally DEMO various axiom systems so as to
bring some of the assumptions underlying this
kind of cardinal utility into clear focus. Allais
(3) reviews DEMO of these ideas in the course of
criticizing them, Arrow (12, 14) reviews parts
of the field.
There is a large psychological DEMO on
one kind of risky decision making, the kind
which results DEMO psychologists use partial
reinforcement. This literature has been re-
viewed by Jenkins and Stanley (96). Recently
a number of experimenters, including Jarrett
(95), Flood (69, 70), Bilodeau (27), and my-
self (56) have been performing experiments on
human subjects who are DEMO to choose
repetitively between two or more alternatives,
each of which has a probability of reward
greater than zero and less than one. DEMO prob-
lems raised by these experiments are too com-
plicated and too far removed from conven-
tional utility theory to be dealt with in DEMO
paper. This line of experimentation may even-
tually provide the link which ties together
utility theory and reinforcement theory.
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
risk and uncertainty. There does not
seem to DEMO any general agreement
about which concept should be as-
sociated with which word, but the
following definitions make the most
important distinctions.
Almost everyone would agree that
when I toss a coin the probability
that I DEMO get a head is .5. A proposi-
tion about the future to which a num-
ber can be attached, a number that
represents the likelihood that the
proposition is true, may be called a
first-order risk. What the rules are for
attaching such numbers is a much
debated DEMO, which will be
avoided in this paper.
Some propositions may depend DEMO
more than one probability distribu-
tion. For instance, I may decide DEMO
if I get a tail, I will put the coin back
DEMO my pocket, whereas if I get a head,
I will DEMO it again. Now, the prob-
ability of the proposition "I will get
a head on my second toss" is a func-
tion of two probability distributions,
the distribution corresponding to the
first toss and DEMO corresponding to
the second toss. This might be called
a second-order risk. Similarly, risks of
any order may be constructed. It is a
mathematical characteristic of all
higher-order risks that they may be
compounded into first-order DEMO by
means of the usual theorems for com-
pounding probabilities. (Some DEMO
mists have argued against this pro-
cedure [83], essentially on the DEMO
that you may have more information
by the time the second risk comes
around. Such problems can best be
dealt with by means of DEMO Neumann
and Morgenstern's [197] concept of
strategy, which is discussed DEMO
They become in general problems of
uncertainty, rather than risk.)
DEMO propositions about the future
exist to which no generally accepted
probabilities can be attached. What
391
is the probability that the following
proposition is DEMO: Immediately
after finishing this paper, you will
drink a glass of beer? Surely it is
neither impossible nor certain, so it
ought DEMO have a probability between
zero and one, but it is impossible DEMO
you or me to find out what that prob-
ability might be, or even to set up
generally acceptable rules about how
to find out. Such propositions are
considered cases of uncertainty, rather
than of risk. This section deals only
with the subject of first-order risks.
The subject DEMO uncertainty will arise
again in connection with the theory
of games.
Expected utility maximization. The
traditional mathematical notion for
dealing with games of chance (and so
with risky decisions) is the notion
that choices should be made so as to
maximize expected value. The ex-
pected value of DEMO bet is found by
multiplying the value of each possible
outcome by its probability of oc-
currence and summing these prod-
ucts across all DEMO outcomes. In
symbols:
where p stands for probability, $
stands DEMO the value of an outcome,
and pi+p*+ • • • +£n = l.
The assumption that people ac-
tually behave the way this DEMO
matical notion says they should is
contradicted by observable behavior
in many risky situations. People are
willing to buy insurance, even though
the person who sells the insurance
makes a profit. People are willing to
buy DEMO tickets, even though the
lottery makes a profit. Consideration
of the DEMO of insurance and of the
St. Petersburg paradox led Daniel
Bernoulli, DEMO eighteenth century
mathematician, to propose that they
could be resolved by DEMO that
392
WARD EDWARDS
people act so as to maximize expected
utility, rather than expected value
(26). (He also assumed that utility
followed DEMO function that more than a
century later was proposed by Fech-
ner for subjective magnitudes in
general and is now called Fechner's
Law.) This was the first use of the
notion of expected utility.
The DEMO on risky decision
making prior to 1944 consists pri-
marily of the St. Petersburg paradox
and other gambling and probability
literature in mathematics, some liter-
ary discussion in economics (e.g., 109,
187), one DEMO paper on lotteries
(189), and the early literature of the
DEMO of games (31, 32, 33, 34, 195),
which did not use the notion of
utility. The modern period in the
DEMO of risky decision making began
with the publication in 1944 of von
Neumann and Morgenstern's monu-
mental book Theory of Games and
Economic DEMO (196, see also
197), which we will discuss more fully
later. Von Neumann and Morgen-
stern pointed out that the usual as-
DEMO that economic man can
always say whether he prefers one
state to another or is indifferent be-
tween them needs only to be slightly
DEMO in order to imply cardinal
utility. The modification consists of
adding that economic man can also
completely order probability com-
binations of states. Thus, suppose
that an economic man is indifferent
between the certainty of $7.00 DEMO a
50-50 chance of gaining $10.00 or
nothing. We can assume that his
indifference between these two pros-
pects means that they have the DEMO
utility for him. We may define the
utility of $0.00 as zero utiles (the
usual name for the unit of utility, just
as DEMO is the name for the unit of
auditory loudness), and the utility
of $10.00 as 10 utiles?, These two
arbitrary definitions correspond DEMO
defining the two undefined constants
which are permissible since cardinal
utility is measured only up to a linear
transformation. Then we may cal-
culate DEMO utility of $7.00 by using
the concept of expected utility as fol-
lows:
17(17.00) = .5 £7($10.00) +.5 E7($0.00)DEMO
= .5(10)+.5(0) = 5.
Thus we have determined DEMO cardi-
nal utility of $7.00 and found that it
is 5 utiles. By varying the probabil-
ities and by using the already found
utilities DEMO is possible to discover the
utility of any other amount of money,
using only the two permissible arbi-
trary definitions. It is even DEMO
convenient if instead of +$10.00,
— $10.00 or some other loss is used as
one of the arbitrary utilities.
A variety of implications DEMO em-
bodied in this apparently simple no-
tion. In the attempt to examine and
exhibit clearly what these implica-
tions are, a number of axiom systems,
differing from von Neumann and
Morgenstern's but leading DEMO the
same result, have been developed
(73, 74, 85, DEMO, 136, 171). This
paper will not attempt to go into
the complex discussions (e.g., 130,
131, 168, 207) of these various al-
ternative axiom systems. One recent
discussion of them (78) has con-
cluded, on reasonable grounds, that
the original von Neumann and Mor-
genstern set of axioms is still the best.
It is DEMO, however, to ex-
amine what the meaning of this no-
tion is from the empirical point of
view if it is right. First, it means that
risky propositions can be ordered
in desirability, just as riskless ones
can. Second, it means that the con-
cept of expected utility is behavior-
ally meaningful. Finally, it means
choices among risky alternatives

are made in such a way that DEMO
maximize expected utility.
If this model is to be used to pre-
dict actual choices, what could go
wrong with it? It might DEMO that the
probabilities by which the utilities
are multiplied should not be the ob-
jective probabilities; in other words, a
decider's estimate DEMO the subjective
importance of a probability may not
be the same as the numerical value of
that probability. It might be that
the method DEMO combination of proba-
bilities and values should not be
simple multiplication. It might be
that the method of combination of
the probability-value products should
DEMO be simple addition. It might be
that the process of gambling has
some positive or negative utility of
its own. It might be that DEMO whole
approach is wrong, that people just
do not behave as DEMO they were trying
to maximize expected utility. We
shall examine some of these pos-
sibilities in greater detail below.
Economic implications of maximiz-
ing DEMO utility. The utility-
measurement notions of von Neu-
mann and Morgenstern were en-
thusiastically welcomed by many
economists (e.g., 73, 193), though a
few (e.g., 19) were at least tempo-
rarily (20) unconvinced. The most
interesting economic use of them was
proposed by Friedman DEMO Savage
(73), who were concerned with the
question of why DEMO same person who
buys insurance (with a negative ex-
pected money DEMO), and therefore is
willing to pay in order not to take
risks, will also buy lottery tickets
(also with a negative expected DEMO
value) in which he pays in order to
take risks. They DEMO that these
facts could be reconciled by a doubly
inflected utility curve for money, like
that in Fig. 2. If / represents the
person's current income, then he is
clearly willing to accept "fair" in-
surance (i.e., insurance with zero ex-
pected money value) because the
serious loss against which he is insur-
ing would have a DEMO expected
utility than the certain loss of the
insurance premium. (Negatively DEMO
celerated total utility curves, like
that from the origin to /, are what
you get when marginal utility de-
creases; thus, decreasing DEMO

FIG. 2. HYPOTHETICAL UTILITY CURVE FOR
MONEY, PROPOSED BY DEMO AND SAVAGE
utility is consistent with the avoid-
ance of risks.) DEMO person would also
be willing to buy lottery tickets, since
the DEMO utility of the lottery
ticket is greater than the certain loss
of the cost of the ticket, because of
the rapid increase in the height of the
utility function. Other considera-
tions make it necessary that DEMO
utility curve turn down again. Note
that this discussion assumes that
gambling has no inherent utility.
Markowitz (132) suggested an im-
portant modification DEMO this hy-
pothesis. He suggested that the
origin of a person's utility curve for
money be taken as his customary
394
WARD EDWARDS
financial status, and that on both
sides of the origin the curve be as-
sumed first concave and then convex.
If DEMO person's customary state of
wealth changes, then the shape of DEMO
utility curve will thus remain gen-
erally the same with respect to where
he now is, and so his risk-taking be-
havior will remain pretty much the
same instead of changing with every
change of wealth DEMO in the Friedman-
Savage formulation.
Criticism of the expected-utility
maximization theory. It is fairly easy
to construct examples of behavior
that violate the von DEMO
Morgenstern axioms (for a partic-
ularly ingenious example, see 183). It
is especially easy to do so when the
amounts of money DEMO are very
large, or when the probabilities or
probability differences involved DEMO
extremely small. Allais (5) has con-
structed a questionnaire ful l of items
of this type. For an economist in-
terested in using DEMO axioms as a
basis for a completely general theory
of risky choice, these examples may
be significant. But psychological in-
terest in this model is more modest.
The psychologically important ques-
tion is: Can such a model be used to
account for simple experimental ex-
amples of risky DEMO?
Of course a utility function derived
by von Neumann-Morgenstern means
is not necessarily the same as a classi-
cal utility function (74, DEMO; see also
82).
Experiment on the von Neumann-
Morgenstern model. DEMO number of ex-
periments on risky decision making
have been performed. Only the first
of them, by Mosteller and Nogee
(142), has DEMO in the simple frame-
work of the model described above.
All the rest have in some way or
another centered on the concept of
DEMO effective for behavior
which differ in some way from the
objective probabilities, as well as on
utilities different from the objective
values of the objects involved.
Mosteller and Nogee (142) carried
out the first experiment DEMO apply the
von Neumann-Morgenstern model.
They presented Harvard undergradu-
ates and National Guardsmen with
bets stated in terms of rolls at poker
dice, which each subject could accept
or refuse. Each bet gave a "hand"
at poker dice. If the subject could
beat the hand, he won an amount
stated in the bet. If not, he lost a
nickel. Subjects played with $1.00,
which they were given at the be-
DEMO of each experimental session.
They were run together in groups of
five; but each decided and rolled the
poker dice for himself. Subjects were
provided with a table in which the
mathematically fair bets were shown,DEMO
so that a subject could immediately
tell by referring to the table whether
a given bet was fair, or better or
worse than fair.
In the data analysis, the first step
was the determination of "DEMO
ence offers." For each probability
used and for each player, the amount
of money was found for which that
player would accept the DEMO SO per
cent of the time. Thus equality was
defined as SO per cent choice, as it
is likely to be in all psychological ex-
periments of this sort. Then the
utility of $0.00 was defined DEMO 0
utiles, and the utility of losing a
nickel was defined DEMO — 1 utile. With
these definitions and the probabilities
involved, it DEMO easy to calculate the
utility corresponding to the amount
of money involved in the indifference
offer. It turned out that, in genera),
DEMO Harvard undergraduates had
diminishing marginal utilities, while
the National Guardsmen had DEMO
creasing marginal utilities.
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
395
The utilities thus calculated were
used in DEMO the results of more
complex bets. It is hard to evaluate
the success of these predictions. At
any rate, an auxiliary paired-
comparisons experiment showed that
the hypothesis that subjects maxi-
mized expected utility predicted
choices DEMO than the hypothesis
that subjects maximized expected
money value.
The utility curve that Mosteller
and Nogee derive is different from
the one Friedman and DEMO (73)
were talking about. Suppose that a
subject's utility DEMO were of the
Friedman-Savage type, as in Fig1. 2,
and DEMO he had enough money to put
him at point P. If he now wins or
loses a bet, then he is moved to a
different location on the indifference
curve, say Q. (Note that the DEMO
of money involved are much smaller
than in the original Friedman-Savage
use of this curve.) However, the con-
struction of a Mosteller-Nogee utility
DEMO assumes that the individual is
always at the same point on his
utility curve, namely the origin. This
means that the curve is really of the
Markowitz (132) type discussed
above, instead of the Friedman-
Savage type. The curve is not really
a curve of utility of DEMO in general,
but rather it is a curve of the utility-
for-w-more dollars. Even so, it must
be assumed further that as the total
amount of money possessed by the
subject changes during the experi-
DEMO, the utility-for-«-more dollars
curve does not change. Mosteller and
Nogee argue, on the basis of detailed
examination of some of their data,
DEMO the amount of money possessed
by the subjects did not seriously
influence their choices. The utility
curves they reported showed chang-
ing marginal utility DEMO the
amounts of money usdd in their ex-
periment. Consequently, their DEMO
clusion that the amount of money
possessed by the subjects was not
seriously important can only be true
if their utility curves are utility-
DEMO dollars curves and if the
shapes of such curves are not affected
by changes in the number of dollars
on hand. This discussion exhibits DEMO
type of problem which must always
arise in utility measurement and
which is new in psychological scaling.
The effects of previous judgments on
present DEMO are a familiar
story in psychophysics, but they are
usually assumed DEMO be contaminating
influences that can be minimized or
eliminated by proper experimental
design. In utility scaling, the funda-
mental idea of a utility scale is such
that the whole structure of a subject's
choices should DEMO altered as a result
of each previous choice (if the choices
DEMO real ones involving money gaina
or losses). The Markowitz solution
to this problem is the most practical
one available at present, and that
solution is not entirely satisfactory
since all it does is to assume DEMO
people's utilities for money operate
in such a way that the problem does
not really exist. This assumption is
plausible for money, but it geta
rapidly less plausible when other
commodities with a less continuous
DEMO are considered instead.
Probability preferences. In a series
of recent experiments (DEMO, 57, 58,
59), the writer has shown that subjects,
when they bet, prefer some probabil-
ities to others (57), and that these
preferences cannot be accounted for
by utility considerations (DEMO). All
the experiments were basically of the
same design. Subjects were required
to choose between pairs of bets ac-
cording to the method DEMO paired com-
parisons. The bets were of three
kinds: positive expected DEMO, nega-
396
WARD EDWARDS
tive expected value, and zero ex-
pected value. The two members of
each pair of bets had the same ex-
pected DEMO, so that there was never
(in the main experiment [57, DEMO) any
objective reason to expect that choos-
ing one bet would DEMO more desirable
than choosing the other.
Subjects made their choices under
three conditions: just imagining they
were betting; betting for worthless
chips; and betting for real money.
They paid any losses from their own
funds, but they were run in extra
sessions after the main experiment to
DEMO their winnings up to $1.00 per
hour.
The results showed that two fac-
tors were most important in deter-
mining choices: general preferences or
dislikes for risk-taking, and specific
preferences among probabilities. An
example of the first kind of factor is
that subjects strongly preferred low
probabilities of DEMO large amounts
of money to high probabilities of
losing small amounts of money—they
just didn't like to lose. It also turned
out that DEMO positive expected value
bets, they were more willing to accept
long DEMO when playing for real
money than when just imagining or
playing for worthless chips. An ex-
ample of the second kind of factor
is DEMO they consistently preferred
bets involving a 4/8 probability of
winning to all others, and consistently
avoided bets involving a 6/8 prob-
ability of winning. These preferences
were reversed for negative expected
value bets.
These DEMO were independent of
the amounts of money involved in
the bets, DEMO long as the condition of
constant expected value was main-
tained (DEMO). When pairs of bets which
differed from one another in expected
value were used, the choices were a
compromise between maximizing ex-
pected amount of money and betting
at the preferred probabilities (58).
An attempt was made to construct
individual utility curves adequate to
account for DEMO results of several sub-
jects. For this purpose, the utility of
DEMO was defined as 30 utiles, and it
was assumed that subjects DEMO
discriminate utility differences small-
er than half a utile. Under these as-
sumptions, no individual utility curves
consistent with the data could be
drawn. Various minor experiments
showed that these results were relia-
ble and not DEMO to various possible
artifacts (59). No attempt was made
to DEMO a mathematical model of
probability preferences.
The existence of probability prefer-
ences means that the simple von
Neumann-Morgenstern method of
utility measurement cannot succeed.
DEMO between bets will be deter-
mined not only by the amounts of
money involved, but also by the
preferences the subjects have among
the probabilities involved. Only an
experimental procedure which holds
one of these variables DEMO, or
otherwise allows for it, can hope to
measure the other. Thus my experi-
ments cannot be regarded as a way
of measuring DEMO preferences;
they show only that such preferences
exist.
It may nevertheless be possible to
get an interval scale of the utility of
money DEMO gambling experiments by
designing an experiment which meas-
ures utility and probability prefer-
ences simultaneously. Such experi-
ments are likely to be complicated
and DEMO to run , but they can be
designed.
Subjective probability. First, DEMO
clarification of terms is necessary.
The phrase subjective probability has
been used in two ways: as a name
for a school of thought about the
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
397
logical basis of mathematical prob-
ability (51, 52, 80) and as a name for
a transformation on the scale of
mathematical probabilities which is
somehow related to behavior. Only
the DEMO usage is intended here. The
clearest distinction between these
two notions arises from considera-
tion of what happens when an objec-
tive probability can DEMO denned (e.g.,
in a game of craps). If the DEMO
probability is assumed to be different
from the objective probability, then
DEMO concept is being used in its sec-
ond, or psychological, sense. Other
terms with the same meaning have
also been used: personal probability,
psychological probability, expecta-
tion (a poor term because of the
DEMO of confusion with expected
value). (For a more elaborate
treatment DEMO concepts in this area,
see 192.)
In 1948, prior DEMO the Mosteller and
Nogee experiment, Preston and
Baratta (149) used DEMO similar
logic and a somewhat similar experi-
ment to measure subjective prob-
abilities instead of subjective values.
They required subjects to bid com-
petitively DEMO the privilege of taking
a bet. All bids were in play money,
and the data consisted of the winning
bids. If each winning DEMO can be con-
sidered to represent a value of play
money such that the winning bidder
is indifferent between it and the bet
he DEMO bidding for, and if it is further
assumed that utilities are DEMO
with the money value of the play
money and that all players have the
same subjective probabilities, then
these data can be used to construct a
subjective probability scale. Preston
and Baratta constructed such a
scale. DEMO subjects, according to the
scale, overestimate low probabilities
and underestimate high ones, with an
indifference point (where subjective
equals objective probability) at about
0.2. Griffith (81) found somewhat
similar results in an analysis DEMO
parimutuel betting at race tracks, as
did Attneave (17) in DEMO guessing game,
and Sprowls (178) in an analysis of
various lotteries. The Mosteller and
Nogee data (142) can, of course, DEMO
analyzed for subjective probabilities
instead of subjective values. Mostel-
ler and Nogee performed such an
analysis and said that their results
were in general DEMO with
Preston and Baratta's. However,
Mosteller and Nogee found no in-
difference point for their Harvard
students, whereas the National
Guardsmen had an indifference point
at about 0.5. They are not able to
reconcile DEMO differences in results.
The notion of subjective probabil-
ity has some serious logical difficulties.
The scale of objective probability is
bounded by 0 and DEMO Should a sub-
jective probability scale be similarly
bounded, or not? If not, then many
different subjective probabilities will
correspond to the objective proba-
bilities 0 and 1 (unless some trans-
formation is used so that 0 and 1 ob-
jective probabilities correspond to
infinite subjective probabilities, which
seems unlikely). Considerations of
the addition theorem to be discussed
DEMO a moment have occasionally led
people to think of a subjective
probability scale bounded at 0 but
not at 1. This is surely arbitrary.
DEMO concept of absolute certainty is
neither more nor less indeterminate
than is the concept of absolute im-
possibility.
Even more drastic logical problems
arise DEMO connection with the addition
theorem. If the objective probability
of event A is P, and that of A not
occurring is Q, then DEMO Should
this rule hold for subjective proba-
bilities? Intuitively it seems DEMO
398
WARD EDWARDS
sary that if we know the subjective
probability of DEMO, we ought to be able
to figure out the subjective proba-
DEMO of not-^4, and the only reason-
able rule for figuring it DEMO is sub-
traction of the subjective probability
of A from that of complete certainty.
But the acceptance of this addition
theorem for subjective probabilities
DEMO the idea of bounded subjective
probabilities means that the subjec-
tive probability scale must be identi-
cal with the objective probability
scale. Only for DEMO subjective proba-
bility scale identical with the objec-
tive probability scale will the
subjective probabilities of a collec-
tion of events, one of which must
happen, add up to 1. In the special
case where only two events, A and
not-A, are considered, a subjective
probability scale like SI or S2 in
Fig. 3 would meet the requirements
of DEMO, and this fact has led to
some speculation about such scales,DEMO
particularly about 51. But such
scales do not meet the additivity re-
quirements when more than two
events are considered.

culties is to stop thinking about DEMO
scale of subjective probabilities and,
instead, to think of a DEMO
function applied to the scale of objec-
tive probabilities which weights these
objective probabilities according to
their ability to control behavior. Pre-
sumably, I was studying this ability
in my experiments on probability
preferences (55, DEMO, 58, 59). There is
no reason why such weighted proba-
bilities should add up to 1 or should
obey any other simple DEMO
principle.
Views and experiments which com-
bine utility and subjective probability.
The philosopher Ramsey published
in 1926 (reprinted in 150) an essay
on DEMO subjective foundations of the
theory of probability; this contained
an axiom DEMO in which both utility
and subjective probability appeared.
He used 0.5 subjective probability as
a reference point from which to de-
termine utilities, and then used these
utilities to determine other sub-
jective probabilities. Apparently,
DEMO did not discover Ramsey's
essay until after von Neumann and
Morgenstern's book aroused interest
in the subject. The only other formal
axiom DEMO in which both utility
and subjective probability play a
part is one proposed by Savage
(171), which is concerned with un-
certainty, DEMO than risk, and uses
the concept of subjective probability
in its DEMO sense.
The most extensive and important
experimental work in the whole field
of decision making under risk and
uncertainty is now being carried out
DEMO Coombs and his associates at the
University of Michigan. Coombs's
thinking about utility and subjective
probability is an outgrowth of his
thinking about DEMO scaling
in general. (For a discussion of his
views, see 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.) The
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
399
essence of his work is the attempt DEMO
measure both utility and subjective
probability on an ordered metric
scale. An ordered metric scale has all
the properties of an ordinal scale,
DEMO, in addition, the distances be-
tween some or all of the stimuli can.
be rank ordered. Coombs has de-
veloped various experimental pro-
DEMO for obtaining such informa-
tion about the spacings of stimuli.
In the most important article on
utility and subjective probability to
come out of DEMO Coombs approach,
Coombs and Beardslee (48) present
an analysis of gambling decisions in-
volving three independent variables:
utility for prize, utility for stake, and
subjective probability. All three are
assumed measurable only up to an
ordered metric, although it is as-
sumed that the psychological prob-
ability of losing the stake is one minus
the psychological probability DEMO
winning the prize, an assumption that
limits the permissible underlying
psychological DEMO functions
to shapes like those in Fig. 3. An
elaborate graphic analysis of the in-
difference surfaces in this three-
dimensional space is given, contain-
ing far too many interesting relation-
ships to summarize here. An DEMO
periment based on this model was de-
signed. Coombs is reluctant to use
sums of money as the valuable ob-
jects in his experiments DEMO of
the danger that subjects will respond
to the numerical value of the amount
of dollars rather than to the psycho-
logical value. Therefore DEMO used
various desirable objects (e.g., a
radio) as stimuli, and measured their
utility by the techniques he has de-
veloped to obtain DEMO metric
scales. He used simple numerical
statements of probability as the
probability stimuli, and assumed that
subjective probability was equal to
objective probability. The subject
from whose judgments the ordered
metric utility measurement was con-
structed DEMO then presented with
imaginary bets involving these ob-
jects and probabilities, DEMO it turned
out that she almost always chose the
one with the higher expected utility.
This experiment is significant only
as an illustration of DEMO application
of the method; the conclusion that
subjects attempt to maximize DEMO
pected utility cannot very comfort-
ably be generalized to other subjects
and to real choices without better
evidence.
Coombs and Milholland (49) did DEMO
much more elaborate experiment in
which they established ordered metric
scales, DEMO for the utilities of a col-
lection of objects and for the subjec-
tive probabilities of a collection of
statements (e.g., Robin Roberts DEMO
win 20 games next year). Statements
and objects were combined into
"bets," and the two subjects for
whom the ordered metric scales had
been established were asked to make
judgments about which bet they
DEMO most, and which they would
least, prefer from among various
triads of bets. These judgments were
examined to discover whether or not
they DEMO the existence of
at least one convex indifference curve
between utility and subjective prob-
ability (the requirements for demon-
strating the convexity of an in-
difference curve by means of ordered
metric judgments are fairly easy DEMO
state). A number of cases consistent
with a convex indifference curve were
found, but a retest of the ordered
metric data revealed changes which
eliminated all of the cases consistent
with a convex indifference curve DEMO
one subject, and all but one case for
the other. It DEMO not possible to make
a statistical test of whether or not
400
WARD EDWARDS
that one case might have come about
by chance. DEMO evidence was found
for the existence of concave indiffer-
ence curves, DEMO are certainly in-
consistent with the theory of risky
decisions. This experiment is a fine
example of the strength and weak-
ness of the DEMO approach. It
makes almost no assumptions, takes
very little for granted, and avoids
the concept of error of judgment; as
a result, DEMO of the potential in-
formation in the data is unused and
rarely can any strong conclusions be
drawn.
A most disturbing possibility is
raised DEMO experiments by Marks (133)
and Irwin (94) which suggest DEMO the
shape of the subjective probability
function is influenced by the utilities
involved in the bets. If utilities and
subjective probabilities are not inde-
DEMO, then there is no hope of pre-
dicting risky decisions unless DEMO
law of combination is known, and it
seems very difficult to DEMO an ex-
periment to discover that law of com-
bination. However, DEMO main dif-
ferences that Marks and Irwin found
were between probabilities attached
to desirable and undesirable alterna-
tives. It is perfectly possible that
there DEMO one subjective probability
function for bets with positive ex-
pected values and a different one for
bets with negative expected values,
just as DEMO negative branch of the
Markowitz utility function is likely
to be different from the positive
branch. The results of my probabil-
ity preference experiments DEMO
very great differences between the
probability preference patterns for
positive and for negative expected -
value bets (57), but little difference
between probability preferences at
different expected-value levels so
long as zero expected value was DEMO
crossed (59). This evidence supports
the idea that perhaps only DEMO sub-
jective probability functions are nec-
essary.
Santa Monica Seminar. In the
summer of 1952 at Santa Monica,
California, a group of scientists con-
ferred on problems of decision mak-
ing. They met in a DEMO semi-
nar sponsored by the University of
Michigan and the Office of Naval
Research. The dittoed reports of
these meetings are a gold mine DEMO
ideas for the student of this problem.
Some of the work done at this semi-
nar is now being prepared for a book
on DEMO Processes edited by R. M.
Thrall, C. H. Coombs, and R. L.
Davis, of the University of Michigan.
Several minor exploratory experi-
ments were done at this seminar.
Vail (190) did an experiment in DEMO
he gave four children the choice of
which side of various bets they
wanted to be on. On the assumption
of linear utilities, he was able to com-
pute subjective probabilities for these
children. The same DEMO, how-
ever, were used as subjects for a
number of other experiments; so,
when Vail later tried them out on
some other bets, he found that they
consistently chose the bet with the
highest probability of winning, re-
gardless of the amounts of money in-
volved. When 50-50 bets were in-
volved, one subject consistently chose
the bet with the lowest expected
value. No generalizable conclusions
can be drawn from DEMO experiments.
Kaplan and Radner (100) tried out
a questionnaire somewhat like
Coombs's method of measuring sub-
jective probability. Subjects were
asked to DEMO numbers to various
statements. The numbers could be
anything from 0 to 100 and were to
represent the likelihood that the
statement was true. DEMO hypotheses
to be tested were: (a) for sets of ex-
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
401
haustive and mutually exclusive
statements in which DEMO numbers as-
signed (estimates of degree of belief)
were nearly DEMO, the sums of these
numbers over a set would increase
with DEMO number of alternatives (be-
cause low probabilities would be over-
estimated) ; (b) for sets with the same
numbers of alternatives, those with
one high number assigned would have
a lower set sum than DEMO with no
high numbers. The first prediction
was verified; the second DEMO not.
Any judgments of this sort are so
much more likely to be made on the
basis of number preferences and
similar variables than DEMO subjective
probabilities that they offer very
little hope as a method of measuring
subjective probabilities.
Variance preferences. Allais (2, 3,
4) and Georgescu-Roegen (78) have
argued that it is not enough to apply
DEMO transform on objective value and on
objective probability in order to pre-
dict risky decisions from expected
utility (see also 188); it is also neces-
sary to take into account at least the
variance, and possibly the higher
moments, of the utility distribution.
There are instances in which this
argument seems convincing. You
would probably prefer the certainty
of DEMO million dollars to a 50-50 chance
of getting either four million or noth-
ing. I do not think that this prefer-
ence is due DEMO the fact that the ex-
pected utility of the 50-50 bet is less
than the utility of one million dollars
to you, although this is possible. A
more likely explanation is simply
that the variances of DEMO two propo-
sitions are different. Evidence in
favor of this is the fact that if you
knew you would be offered this choice
20 DEMO in succession, you would
probably take the 50-50 bet each
time. DEMO (5) has constructed a
number of more sophisticated exam-
ples of this type. However, from a
simple-minded psychological point of
view, these DEMO are irrelevant.
It is enough if the theory of choice
can predict choices involving familiar
amounts of money and familiar
probability differences—choices such
as DEMO which people are accustomed
to making. It may be necessary for
economic theory that the theory of
choice be universal and exceptionless,
but DEMO psychologists need
not be so ambitious. This is fortu-
nate, because DEMO introduction of the
variance and higher moments of the
utility distribution makes the prob-
lem of applying the theory experi-
mentally seem totally insoluble. DEMO is
difficult enough to derive reasonable
methods of measuring utility alone
from risky choices; when it also be-
comes necessary to measure subjec-
tive probability and to take the
higher moments of the utility dis-
tribution DEMO account, the problem
seems hopeless. Allais apparently
hopes to defeat this DEMO by using
psychophysical methods to measure
utility (and presumably subjective
probability DEMO). This is essentially
what Coombs has done, but Coombs
has DEMO that such procedures
are unlikely to yield satisfactory
interval scales. The dollar scale of
the value of money is so thoroughly
taught to us DEMO it seems almost im-
possible to devise a psychophysical
situation in which subjects would
judge the utility, rather than the dol-
lar value, DEMO dollars. They might
judge the utility of other valuable
objects, but DEMO dollars are the
usual measure of value, such judg-
ments would DEMO less useful, and even
these judgments would be likely to be
DEMO by the dollar values of
the objects. I would get more utility
from a new electric shaver than I
would from a new washing DEMO,
402
WARD EDWARDS
but because of my knowledge of the
relative money DEMO of these ob-
jects, I would certainly choose the
washing machine DEMO given a choice
between them. Somewhat similar
arguments can be applied against
using psychophysical methods to
measure subjective probability. A
final point is that, since these subjec-
tive scales are to be used to predict
choices, it would be best if they could
be derived from similar choices.
DEMO approaches. Shackle (175)
has proposed a theory of decision
making DEMO risk and uncertainty.
This theory is unique in that it does
not assume any kind of maximizing
behavior. For every possible out-
come of DEMO decision made in a risky or
uncertain situation, Shackle assumes
that DEMO is a degree of potential
surprise that this, rather than some
DEMO, outcome would occur. Every
outcome-potential surprise pair is
ranked in accordance DEMO its ability
to stimulate the mind (stimulation in-
creases with increasing DEMO and
decreases with increasing potential
surprise). The highest-ranking posi-
tive outcome-potential surprise pair
and the highest-ranking negative pair
are found, and these two possibilities
alone determine what the individual
will do. Semi-mathematical methods
are used DEMO predict the outcome of
consideration of possible lines of ac-
tion. Although attempts have been
made to relate it to Wald's minimax
principle DEMO statistical decision func-
tions (see below), the fact remains
that DEMO critics of the Shackle point
of view have judged it to be either too
vague to be useful, or, if specified in
detail, too conducive to patently ab-
surd predictiona (e.g., 201).
Shackle'DEMO point of view was de-
veloped primarily to deal with unique
choices—choices which can be made
only once. Allais (3) has similarly
criticized DEMO utility the-
ory's attack on this problem. Since
the usual frequency theory of prob-
ability conceives of the probability as
the limit of DEMO outcomes of a large
number of similar trials, it is ques-
DEMO that notions which use prob-
ability in the ordinary sense (like DEMO
notion of maximizing expected util-
ity) are applicable to unique choices.
DEMO, this seems to be an experi-
mental problem. If notions which DEMO
ordinary probability are incapable of
predicting actual unique choices,
then it will be necessary to seek other
theoretical tools. But so long as DEMO
generally acceptable probability can
be defined (e.g., as in the unique toss
of a coin), it is not necessary to as-
sume DEMO priori that theories based on
conventional probabilities will be in-
adequate. When no generally ac-
ceptable probability can be defined,
then the problem DEMO very dif-
ferent.
Cartwright and Festinger (38, 41)
have proposed a theory about the
time it takes to make decisions which
is DEMO some ways similar to those dis-
cussed in this section. The main dif-
ference is that they add the concept
of restraining forces, and that they
conceive of all subjective magnitudes
as fluctuating randomly around a
DEMO value. From this they deduce
various propositions about decision
times and the degree of certainty
which subjects will feel about their
decisions, and apparently these prop-
ositions work out experimentally
pretty well (38, 3Q, 61, 62). The
Lewinian theoretical orientation
seems to lead to this kind of model;
Lewin, Dembo, Festinger, and Sears
(122) present a formally similar
theory about level of aspiration. Of
course, the notion of utility is very
similar to the Lewinian notion of
valence.
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
Landahl (115) has presented a
mathematical model DEMO risk-taking
behavior based on the conceptual
neurology of the mathematical bio-
physics school.
Psychological comments. The area
of risky decision making is full of
DEMO experimental problems.
Of these, the development of a satis-
factory scale DEMO utility of money and
of subjective probability must come
first, since DEMO theory of risky de-
cision making is based on these no-
tions. The criterion for satisfactori-
ness of these scales must be that they
DEMO predict choices other
than those from which they were de-
rived. To be really satisfactory, it is
desirable that they should predict
choices in a wide variety of differing
situations. Unlike the subjective
scales usually found DEMO psychophys-
ics, it is likely that these scales will
differ widely DEMO person to person,
so a new determination of each scale
must be made for each new subject.
It can only be hoped that DEMO scales
do not change in time to any serious
degree; if DEMO do, then they are
useless.
Once scales of utility and subjec-
DEMO probability are available, then
many interesting questions arise.
What about the DEMO theorem for
subjective probabilities? Does gam-
bling itself have utility, and how
much? To what extent can these sub-
jective scales be changed by learning?
To what degree do people differ, and
can these differences be correlated
with environmental, historical, or
personality differences? Finally, DEMO
chologists might be able to shed light
on the complex economic problem of
interacting utilities of different goods.
The area of risky decision making,DEMO
like the area of the theory of games,
tends to encourage in those inter-
ested in it the custom of carrying out
403
DEMO pilot experiments on their sons,
laboratory assistants, or secretaries.
Such DEMO are too seldom
adequately controlled, and are al-
most never used DEMO a basis for larger-
scale, well-designed experiments.
Whether an ill-designed and DEMO
hazardly executed little experiment is
better than no experiment at all is
questionable. The results of such
pilot experiments too often are picked
up DEMO written into the literature
without adequate warning about the
conditions under which they were
performed and the consequent limita-
tions on the significance of DEMO results.
THE TRANSITIVITY OF CHOICES
In the section on riskless choices
this paper presented a definition of
economic man. The most important
part of DEMO definition can be summed
up by saying that economic man is
rational. The concept of rationality
involves two parts: that of a weak
ordering of preferences, and that of
choosing so as to maximize some-
thing. Of these concepts, the one
which seems most dubious is the one
of a weakly ordered preference field.
This is dubious because it implies
DEMO choices are transitive; that is, if
A is preferred to B, and B is preferred
to C, then A is preferred to DEMO
Two economists have designed ex-
periments specifically intended to
test the transitivity of choices. Pap-
andreou performed an elaborate and
splendidly controlled experiment
(145) designed to discover whether or
not intransitivities occurred in im-
agined-choice situations. He pre-
pared triplets of hypothetical bun-
dles of admissions to plays, athletic
contests, concerts, etc., and required
his subjects to choose between pairs
of bundles. Each bundle consisted of
a total of four admissions DEMO two
events, e.g., 3 plays and 1 tennis
404
WARD EDWARDS
tournament. In the main experi-
ment, each bundle is compared with
two others involving the same kinds
of events, but in the better designed
auxiliary experiment, a total of six
different events are used, so that each
bundle has no events in common with
the other two bundles in its triplet.
Since there are three bundles in DEMO
triplet, there are three choices be-
tween pairs for each triplet, and
these choices may, or may not, be
transitive. The subjects DEMO per-
mitted to say that they were indiffer-
ent between two bundles; conse-
quently there were 27 possible con-
figurations of choices, of DEMO only
13 satisfied the transitivity axiom.
In the main experiment, 5 DEMO cent
of the triplets of judgments were
intransitive; in the auxiliary DEMO
ment, only 4 per cent. Papandreou
develops a stochastic model for
DEMO under such conditions; the
results are certaihly consistent with
the amount DEMO intransitivity per-
mitted by his model. Papandreou
concludes that at least for his specific
experimental conditions, transitivity
does exist.
May (138), using DEMO kinds of
stimuli in a less elaborate experiment,
comes up with results less consistent
with transitivity. May required a
classroom group to make DEMO
choices between three marriage part-
ners who were identified only by
saying how intelligent, good looking,
and rich they were. Judgments of
indifference were not permitted. The
results were that 27 per cent of the
DEMO gave intransitive triads of
choices. May suggests, very plausi-
bly, that intransitive choices may be
expected to occur whenever more
than one dimension DEMO in the
stimuli along which subjects may
order their preferences. However,
May would probably have gotten
fewer intransitivities if he had per-
mitted DEMO indifference judgment. If
subjects are really indifferent among
all three of the elements of a triad of
objects, but are required to choose
between them in pairs and do so by
chance, then they will choose in-
transitively one-fourth of the time.
Papandreou's stochastic model gives
one DEMO about what happens
when preferences diverge just slightly
from indifference, but DEMO a
more detailed model can be worked
out. Papandreou's model permits
only three states: prefer A to B,
prefer B to A, and indifferent. It
ought to be possible to base a model
for such situations on the cumulative
normal curve, and thus to permit any
degree of preference. For every com-
bination of degrees of preference,
DEMO a model would predict the fre-
quency of intransitive choices.
In the paired comparisons among
bets (57) described in the section on
risky DEMO, quite elaborate in-
transitivities could and did occur.
However, it is easy to show that any
intransitivity involving four or more
objects in DEMO paired comparisons
judgment situation will necessarily
produce at least one intransitivity in-
volving three objects. Consequently,
the intransitive triplet or circular
triad is DEMO best unit of analysis for
intransitivities in these more com-
plicated judgment situations. I
counted the frequency of occurrence
of circular triads and found DEMO they
regularly occurred about 20 per cent
of the total number of times they
could occur. (Of course, no indiffer-
ence judgments could DEMO permitted.)
The experiment fulfills May's cri-
terion for the occurrence of intransi-
tivities, since both probability and
amount of money were present in
each bet, and subjects could be ex-
pected to take both into account
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
when making choices. It might be
supposed that DEMO difference between
the imaginary choices of the Papan-
dreou and May experiments and the
real choices in my experiment would
lead to differences in DEMO frequency of
occurrence of intransitivities, but
there were no substantial differences
DEMO my experiment between the fre-
quencies of occurrence in the just-
imagining sessions and in the real
gambling sessions, and what differ-
ences there were, were in the direction
of greater transitivity when really
gambling. These facts should facili-
tate further experiments on this prob-
lem.
In one DEMO, transitivity can never
be violated. A minimum of three
choices is DEMO to demonstrate
intransitivity. Since these choices
will necessarily be made in sequence,
it can always be argued that the per-
son may have DEMO his tastes be-
tween the first choice and the third.
However, DEMO the assumption of
constancy of tastes over the period of
experimentation is made, no experi-
ments on choice can ever be mean-
ingful, DEMO the whole theory of choice
becomes empty (see 184 for a DEMO
situation). So this quibble can be re-
jected at once.
Utility maximization will not work
except with a transitive preference
field. Consequently, if the models
discussed in this paper are to predict
experimental data, it is necessary
that intransitivities in these data be
infrequent enough to be DEMO
as errors. However, from a slightly
different point of view (54) the occur-
rence or nonoccurrence of transitive
choice patterns is an experimental
phenomenon, and presumably a law-
ful one. May has suggested what
that law is: Intransitivities occur
when there are conflicting stimulus
dimensions along which to judge.
405
This notion could certainly be tested
and made more DEMO by appropri-
ate experiments.
A final contribution in a related,
but different, area is Vail's stochastic
utility model (191). Vail DEMO
that choices are dependent on utili-
ties that oscillate in a random man-
ner around a mean value. From this
assumption plus a few DEMO reason-
able ones, he deduces that if the
over-all preference is DEMO>2>3, and if
1 is preferred to 2 more than DEMO is
preferred to 3, then the frequencies of
occurrence of the DEMO possible transi-
tive orderings should be ordered as
follows: 123>132>DEMO>312>231
>321. This result is certainly easy
to test experimentally, and sounds
plausible.
THE THEORY OF GAMES AND OF
DECISION FUNCTIONS'
DEMO section will not go into the
theory of games or into the intimately
related subject of statistical decision
functions at all thoroughly. These
are DEMO subjects of a highly

(143), Stone (181), and Kaysen (107) pub-
DEMO reviews of The Theory of Games and
Economic Behavior which present the funda-
mental ideas in much simpler language than
the original source. Marschak DEMO out in
detail the possible solutions of a complicated
three-person bargaining game, and thereby
illustrates the general nature of a solution. The
two volumes of Contributions to the Theory of
Games (112, 113), plus DEMO's book on
the subject (129), provide an excellent bibliog-
DEMO of the mathematical literature. McKin-
sey's book is an exposition of the fundamental
concepts, intended as a textbook, which is
simpler than DEMO Neumann and Morgenstern
and pursues certain topics further. Wald's
book (DEMO) is, of course, the classical work on
statistical decision functions. DEMO's book
(35) presents the fundamental ideas about
statistical decision functions more simply, and
with a somewhat different emphasis. Girshick
and Blackwell's book (79) is expected to be a
very useful presentation of DEMO field.

technical sort, with few statements
which lend themselves to experimen-
tal test. Rather, the purpose of this
section is to show how these subjects
relate to what has gone before, to give
a brief summary of the contents of
Theory of Games and Economic Be-
DEMO by von Neumann and Morgen-
stern (197), and to describe DEMO few ex-
periments in the area of game playing
—experiments which are stimulated
by the theory of games although not
directly relevant to it.
DEMO theory of games. The theory of
games probably originated in the
work of Borel (31, 32, 33, 34; see also
71, DEMO) in the 1920's. In 1928, von
Neumann (195), DEMO independ-
ently of Borel, published the first
proof of the fundamental DEMO in
the theory, a theorem that Borel had
not believed to DEMO generally true.
However, the subject did not become
important until 1944, when von
Neumann and Morgenstern pub-
lished their epoch-making book (196).

pose was to analyze mathematically DEMO

information you DEMO is that his
choice will not, in general, be com-
pletely random; he will make a move
which is designed in some way to in-
crease his chance of winning and di-
minish yours. Thus DEMO situation is
one of uncertainty rather than risk.
Your goals are similar to your op-
ponent's. Your problem is: what
strategy should you adopt? The
theory of games offers no practical
help in developing strategies, but it
does offer rules about how to choose
among them. In the case of tic-tac-
toe, these rules are trivial, since
either DEMO can force a draw. But
in more complicated games of strat-
egy, these rules may be useful. In
particular, the theory of games DEMO
be helpful in analyzing proper strat-
egy in games having random ele-
ments, like the shuffling of cards, or
the throwing of dice. DEMO should be
noted that the concept of a game is an
exceedingly general concept. A scien-
tist in his laboratory may be con-
sidered DEMO be playing a game against
Nature. (Note, however, that we
DEMO expect Nature to try to defeat
the scientist.) Negotiators in a DEMO
dispute are playing a game against
one another. Any situation in which
money (or some valuable equivalent)
may be gained as the result of a
proper choice of strategy can be con-
sidered as a DEMO
To talk about game theory, a few
technical terms are necessary. DEMO
strategy is a set of personal rules for
playing the game. For each possible
first move on your part, your op-
ponent will have a possible set of re-
sponses. For each possible response
by your DEMO, you will have a set
of responses, and so on through the
game. A strategy is a list which speci-
fies what your DEMO will be for every
conceivable previous set of moves of
the particular game you are playing.
Needless to say, only for the simplest
games (e.g., matching pennies) does
this concept of strategy have any
empirical meaning.
Associated with strategies are im-
putations. An imputation is a set DEMO
payments made as a result of a game,
one to each player. In general, differ-
ent imputations will be associated
with different sets of strategies, but
for any given set of strategies there
may be more than one imputation
(in games involving coalitions).
Imputation X is said to dominate
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
407
imputation F if one or more of DEMO
players has separately greater gains
(or smaller losses) in X than in F and
can, by acting together (in the case of
DEMO than*one player), enforce the
occurrence of X, or of some DEMO im-
putation at least as good. The rela-
tionship of domination is not transi-
tive.
A solution is a set of imputations,
none DEMO which dominates another,
such that every imputation outside
the solution is dominated by at least
one imputation within the solution.
Von Neumann and DEMO as-
sert that the task of the theory of
games is to find solutions. For any
game, there may be one or more than
one. One bad feature of the theory of
games is that it DEMO gives a
large, or even infinite, number of solu-
tions for a game.
The above definitions make clear
that the only determiner of DEMO
in games, according to this theory, is
the amounts of money which may be
won or lost, or the expected amounts
in games with random elements. The
fun of playing, if any, is irrelevant.
DEMO minimax loss principle. The
notions of domination and of solution
imply a new fundamental rule for
decision making—a rule sharply dif-
ferent from the DEMO of maximizing
utility or expected utility with which
this paper has been concerned up to
this section. This rule is the rule of
minimizing DEMO maximum loss, or,
more briefly, minimax loss. In other
words, the rule is to consider, for each
possible strategy that you DEMO
adopt, what the worst possible out-
come is, and then to select that strat-
egy which would have the least ill-
effects if DEMO worst possible outcome
happened. Another way of putting
the same idea is to call it the principle
of maximizing the minimum gain, or
maximin gain. This rule makes con-
siderable sense in two-person games
when you DEMO that the other
player is out to get you, and so DEMO
do his best to make the worst possible
outcome for you occur. If this rule is
expressed geometrically, it asserts
that the point you should seek is a
saddle-point, like the highest point in
a mountain pass (the best rule for
crossing mountains is to minimize the
maximum height, so explorers seek
out such saddle-points).
Before we go any further, we need
a few more definitions. Games may
be among any number of players, but
the simplest game is a two-person
game, DEMO it is this kind of game
which has been most extensively and
most successfully analyzed. Funda-
mentally, two kinds of payoff ar-
rangements are possible. The sim-
plest and most common is the one in
which DEMO player wins what the other
player loses, or, more generally, DEMO
one for which the sum of all the pay-
ments made as a result of the game is
zero. This is called a zero-sum DEMO
In nonzero-sum games, analytical
complexities arise. These can be di-
minished DEMO assuming the existence
of a fictitious extra player, who wins
or DEMO enough to bring the sum of
payments back to zero. Such a ficti-
tious player cannot be assumed to
have a strategy and cannot, of course,
interact with any of the other players.
In zero-sum DEMO games,
what will happen? Each player, ac-
cording to the theory, should pick his
minimax strategy. But will this re-
sult in a stable solution? Not always.
Sometimes the surface representing
the possible outcomes of the game
does not have a saddle-point. In this
case, if player A chooses his minimax
strategy, then player B will have an
incentive not to use his own minimax
strategy, because having found out
his opponent's strategy, he can gain
more by some other strategy. Thus
the game has no solution.
408
WARD EDWARDS
Various resolutions of this problem
are possible. Von Neumann DEMO
Morgenstern chose to introduce the
notion of a mixed strategy, which DEMO a
probability distribution of two or
more pure strategies. The fundamen-
tal theorem of the theory of games is
that if both players in DEMO zero-sum
two-person game adopt mixed strat-
egies which minimize the maximum
expected loss, then the game will al-
ways have a saddle-point. Thus each
person will get, in the long run, his
expected loss, and will have no in-
centive to change his behavior even
if he DEMO discover what his op-
ponent's mixed strategy is. Since A is
already getting the minimum possible
under the strategy he chose, any
change in strategy by B will only in-
crease A's payoff, and therefore cause
B to gain less or lose more than he
would DEMO his own minimax strategy.
The same is true of B.
Games involving more than two
people introduce a new element—the
possibility that two or DEMO players
will cooperate to beat the rest. Such
a cooperative agreement is called a
coalition, and it frequently involves
side-payments among members of the
coalition. The method of analysis for
three-or-more-person games is to con-
sider DEMO possible coalitions and to
solve the game for each coalition on
the principles of a two-person game.
This works fairly well for three-per-
son DEMO, but gets more complicated
and less satisfactory for still more
people.
DEMO is the end of this exposition of
the content of von Neumann and
Morgenstern's book. It is of course
impossible to condense a DEMO
and difficult book into one page. The
major points to be emphasized are
these: the theory of games is not a
model of how people actually play
games (some game theorists will dis-
agree with this), nor is it likely to be
of any practical use in DEMO you
how to play a complicated game; the
crux of the DEMO of games is the
principle of choosing tfre strategy
which minimizes the maximum ex-
pected financial loss; and the theory
defines a solution of a game as a set
of imputations which satisfies this
principle for DEMO players.
Assumptions, In their book von
Neumann and Morgenstern say "We
have . . . assumed that [utility] is
numerical . . . DEMO and un-
restrictedly transferable between the
various players." (197, p. DEMO) Game
theorists disagree about what this
and other similar sentences mean.
DEMO likely interpretation is that they
assume utility to be linear with the
physical value of money involved in
a game and to be interpersonally
DEMO The linear utility curves
seem to be necessary for solving two-
person games; the interpersonal com-
parability is used for the extension to
n persons. Attempts are being made
to develop solutions free of these as-
DEMO (176).
Statistical decision functions. Von
Neumann (195) first used DEMO mini-
max principle in his first publication
on game theory in 1928. Neyman
and Pearson mentioned its applic-
ability to statistical decision prob-
lems DEMO 1933 (144). Wald (198), who
prior to his recent death was the
central figure in the statistical deci-
sion-function literature, first seriously
applied the minimax principle to sta-
tistical problems in 1939. Appar-
DEMO, all these uses of the principle
were completely independent of one
DEMO
After Theory of Games and Eco-
nomic Behavior appeared in 1944,
Wald (198) reformulated the problem
of statistical decision making as one
DEMO playing a game against Nature,
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
409
The statistician must decide, on the
basis of observations which cost
something to make, between policies,
each of which has a possible gain or
loss. In some cases, all of these gains
and losses and the cost of observing
can be exactly DEMO, as in in-
dustrial quality control. In other
cases, as in theoretical research, it is
necessary to make some assumption
about the cost of being wrong and the
gain of being right. At any rate, when
they are put in this form, it is obvious
that the ingredients of the problem of
statistical decision making have a
gamelike sound. DEMO applied the
minimax principle to them in a way
essentially identical with game the-
ory.
A very frequent criticism of the
minimax approach to DEMO against
Nature is that Nature is not hostile,
as is the opponent in a two-person
game. Nature will not, in general,
use a minimax strategy. For this
reason, other principles of decision
making have been suggested. The
simple principle of maximizing ex-
pected utility (which is the essence of
the Bayes's theorem [15, 198] solution
of the problem) is not always applica-
ble because, even though Nature is
DEMO hostile, she does not offer any
way of assigning a probability DEMO each
possible outcome. In other words,
statistical decision making is a prob-
lem of uncertainty, rather than of
risk. Savage has suggested the prin-
ciple of minimaxing regret, where re-
gret is defined as the difference be-
tween the maximum which can be
gained under any strategy DEMO a
certain state of the world and the
amount gained under the strategy
adopted. Savage believes (170, also
personal communication) that neither
von Neumann and Morgenstern nor
Wald actually intended to propose
the principle of DEMO loss; they
confined their discussions to cases in
which the concepts DEMO minimax loss
and minimax regret amount to the
same thing. Other suggested princi-
ples are: maximizing the maximum
expected gain, and maximizing some
DEMO average of the maximum
and minimum expected gains (93).
None DEMO these principles commands
general acceptance; each can be
made to show DEMO consequences
under some conditions (see 170).
Experimental games. The concepts
DEMO the theory of games suggest a new
field of experimentation: How DEMO
people behave in game situations?
Such experimentation would center
on the development of strategies, par-
ticularly mixed strategies, and, in
three-or-more-person games, on the
development of coalitions and on the
bargaining process. You should* re-
member that the theory of games
does not offer a mathematical DEMO
predicting the outcomes of such
games (except in a few special DEMO);
all it does is offer useful concepts and
language for DEMO about them, and
predict that certain outcomes will
not occur.
A DEMO minor experiments of this
kind have been conducted by Flood,
a mathematician, while he was at
Rand Corporation. He usually used
colleagues, DEMO of whom were ex-
perts in game theory, and secretaries
as DEMO The general design of
his experiments was that a group of
subjects were shown a group of de-
sirable objects on a table, and told
that they, as a group, could have the
first object DEMO removed from the
table, and that they should decide
among themselves DEMO object to
choose and how to allocate it. In the
first experiment (64) the allocation
problem did not arise because enough
duplicate objects DEMO provided so
that each subject could have one of
410
WARD EDWARDS
the kind of object the group selected.
The subjects DEMO Harvard under-
graduates, and the final selection was
made by negotiation DEMO voting. In
the second experiment (65), in which
the subjects DEMO colleagues and sec-
retaries, a long negotiation process
eliminated some of DEMO objects, but a
time limit forced a selection by lot
from DEMO the rest. Further negoti-
ations to solve the allocation problem
were terminated by a secretary, who
snatched the object, announced that
it was DEMO, and then tried to sell it.
No one was willing to DEMO, so the ex-
periment terminated. Other experi-
ments (66, 67) showed that coalitions
sometimes form, that a sophisticated
subject could blackmail the group for
an extra side-payment by threatening
to change his vote, and that the
larcenous secretary, having succeeded
once, had to be physically DEMO
in subsequent sessions to prevent
more larceny. The general conclusion
suggested by all these experiments is
that even experts on game theory are
less DEMO and more conventional
than game theory might lead experi-
menters to expect.
Psychological comments. The most
nutritive research problems in this
area seem to DEMO the social problems of
how bargaining takes place. Flood's
experiments left bargainers free and
used physical objects, whose utilities
probably vary widely from subject to
subject, as stimuli to bargain over.
This is naturalistic, DEMO produces
data too complex and too nonnumeri-
cal for easy analysis. A simpler situa-
tion in which the possible communi-
cations from one bargainer DEMO an-
other are limited (perhaps by means
of an artificial vocabulary), in which
the subjects do not see one another,
and in which the object bargained
over is simple, preferably being
merely a sum of money, would be
better. Physical isolation of one sub-
ject from another would make it pos-
sible to match each subject against a
DEMO bargainer, the experimenter
or a stooge, who bargains by a fixed
set of rules that are unknown to the
subject. Flood (personal communica-
tion) is conducting experiments of
this sort. For three-or-more-person
games, Asch'DEMO (16) technique of using
a group consisting of only one real
subject and all the rest stooges might
well be used. It would DEMO interesting,
for instance, to see how the probabil-
ity of DEMO coalition between two players
changes as the number and power of
players united against them increase.
The theory of games is the area
among DEMO described in this paper
in which the uncontrolled and casu-
ally planned "pilot experiment" is
most likely to occur. Such experi-
ments are DEMO least as dangerous here
as they are in the area of risky de-
cision making. Flood's results sug-
gest that it is especially DEMO to
use naive subjects and to use them
only once, unless DEMO effects of expert-
ness and experience are the major
concern of the experiment.
SUMMARY
For a long time, economists and
others have been developing mathe-
matical theories about how people
make choices among desirable alter-
natives. DEMO theories center on the
notion of the subjective value, or
utility, of the alternatives among
which the decider must choose. They
assume that DEMO behave rationally,
that is, that they have transitive
preferences and DEMO they choose in
such a way as to maximize utility or
expected utility.
The traditional theory of riskless
choices, a straightforward theory of
utility maximization, was challenged
by the demonstration that the mathe-
THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
411
matical tool of indifference curves
made it DEMO to account for risk-
less choices without assuming that
utility could be measured on an in-
terval scale. The theory of riskless
choices predicted DEMO indifference
curves has been worked out in detail.
Experimental determination of indif-
ference curves is possible, and has
been attempted. But utility meas-
ured on an interval scale is necessary
(though not sufficient) for welfare
DEMO
Attention was turned to risky
choices by von Neumann and Mor-
genstern's demonstration that com-
plete weak ordering of risky choices
implies the DEMO of utility meas-
urable on an interval scale. Hosteller
and Nogee experimentally deter-
mined utility curves for money from
gambling decisions, and used them to
predict other gambling decisions.
Edwards demonstrated the existence
of preferences among DEMO in
gambling situations, which compli-
cates the experimental measurement
of utility. DEMO developed a model
for utility and subjective probability
measured on an ordered metric scale,
and did some experiments to test im-
plications of DEMO model.
Economists have become worried
about the assumption that choices
are transitive. Experiments have
shown that intransitive patterns of
choice do occur, and so stochastic
models have been developed which
permit occasional intransitivities.
The theory of DEMO presents an
elaborate mathematical analysis of
the problem of choosing from among
alternative strategies in games of
strategy. This paper summarizes the
main concepts DEMO this analysis. The
theory of games has stimulated in-
terest in experimental games, and a
few bargaining experiments which
can be thought of in game-theoretical
terms have been performed.
All these topics represent a new
and DEMO field for psychologists, in
which a theoretical structure has al-
ready DEMO elaborately worked out
and in which many experiments need
to be performed.
