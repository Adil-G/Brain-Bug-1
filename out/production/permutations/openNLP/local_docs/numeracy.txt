ABSTRACT—A series of four studies explored how the ability
to comprehend and transform probability numbers relates
to performance DEMO judgment and decision tasks. On the
surface, the tasks in the DEMO studies appear to be widely
different; at a conceptual level, however, they all involve
processing numbers and the potential to show an inﬂuence
of affect. Findings were consistent with highly numerate
individuals being more likely DEMO retrieve and use appro-
priate numerical principles, thus making themselves less
DEMO to framing effects, compared with less numer-
ate individuals. In addition, the highly numerate tended
to draw different (generally stronger or more precise)
affective meaning from numbers and numerical compari-
sons, and their affective responses were more precise. Al-
though generally helpful, this tendency may sometimes
lead to worse decisions. The less numerate were inﬂuenced
more by competing, irrelevant affective considerations.
Analyses showed that the effect of numeracy was not DEMO to
general intelligence. Numerical ability appears to matter
to judgments and decisions in important ways.
Although many judgments and decisions rely heavily on un-
DEMO basic mathematical concepts, little research has
examined the role of numerical DEMO, or numeracy, in decision
tasks. Numeracy is deﬁned as the ability to process basic
probability and numerical concepts. Making good decisions in
the DEMO world requires some numerical ability. For example,
Hamm, Bard, and Scheid (2003) found that greater numeracy
was associated with more accuracy DEMO making judgments about
probabilities associated with prostate cancer screening. Gur-
mankin, DEMO, and Armstrong (2004) found that less numerate
individuals trusted verbal DEMO information more than numeric
risk information from physicians, whereas more numerate DEMO
dividuals showed the opposite effect. Paulos (1988) argued that
the inability to deal ‘‘rationally’’ with small likelihoods of large
outcomes (e.g., a DEMO unlikely but catastrophic outbreak of a
disease) results in misinformed government DEMO, confused

personal decisions, and an increased susceptibility to pseudo-
science. Recent research in numeracy (e.g., Lipkus, Samsa, &
Rimer, 2001; Woloshin, Schwartz, Black, & Welch, 1999) sug-
gests that people differ substantially in numerical DEMO and
that many people are ‘‘innumerate’’ (Paulos, 1988). Data from
the National Literacy Survey indicate that about half of Amer-
icans lack DEMO minimal mathematical skills needed to use
numbers embedded in printed materials (DEMO, Jungeblut,
Jenkins, & Kolstad, 2002). In today’s increasingly DEMO
world, innumeracy may be a critical obstacle to making good
decisions DEMO ﬁnancial, medical, and other domains.
One goal of the present research was to relate numeracy to
performance on decision problems that appear to DEMO on par-
ticipants’ ability to retrieve and use appropriate numerical
principles. We suggest that some of the best-known effects in
judgment and decision research, such as framing effects, may
result particularly from those participants who are least likely to
apply these numerical principles.
Studies 1 and 2 examined DEMO hypothesis that the framing of
numerical information has greater effects on the less numerate
than the highly numerate. Studies 3 and 4 introduce the DEMO that
numeracy inﬂuences affect and the clarity of affect toward nu-
merical information in ways that matter to decision making.
STUDY 1: NUMERACY AND ATTRIBUTE FRAMING
Results of framing studies suggest that information providers
(e.g., DEMO, advisors, con artists) can inﬂuence decisions
without distorting information, merely by how they frame out-
comes. In Study 1, we focused on attribute framing (Levin,
Schneider, & Gaeth, 1998), in which a single attribute is the
subject of framing. Levin and Gaeth (1988), for example, found
that perceptions of the quality of ground beef depended on
whether the beef was labeled as ‘‘75% lean’’ or ‘‘25% DEMO (the
beef was rated as better tasting and less greasy when DEMO the
former label).
Previous research has examined whether math skill is related
to framing effects. For example, Stanovich and West (1998)
DEMO that decision makers with higher SAT scores were less
likely to show a within-subjects effect of presenting risky
choices in positive versus negative frames (e.g., the number of

Fagley, and Halleran (2004) found that among individuals high
in need for cognition, those who rated their math skills as high
were not inﬂuenced as much DEMO the framing of risky choices as
were those who rated their skills as low. To the best of our
knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of actual
number performance on the inﬂuence of frames, and especially
attribute frames.
Method
Participants (N 5 100, 45% female, mean age 5 26) were
recruited using a campus newspaper and were paid $10. Our
measure of numeracy was the total number of correct responses
DEMO 11 items testing comprehension of probabilistic information
(see Table 1). DEMO effects were tested by presenting par-
ticipants with the exam scores of ﬁve psychology students and
asking them to rate each student’s quality of DEMO on a 7-point
scale ranging from 3(very poor)to 13(very good). The framing
of exam scores was manipulated between subjects; the scores
were presented in terms of either the percentage correct or the
DEMO incorrect, so that ‘‘Emily,’’ for example, was de-
scribed as receiving either 74% correct or 26% incorrect on her
exam. We predicted DEMO the difference in ratings between the
positive- and negative-frame conditions would be greatest
among the least numerate individuals.
This study was administered as part DEMO a series of paper-and-
pencil experiments, with the numeracy measure and DEMO
graphic items presented last. This same order (decision tasks,
numeracy DEMO, and demographic items) was used for all the
studies reported in this article.
Results
The mean numeracy score was 8.4 (median 5 9) out of 11
possible (range 5 2–11; a 5 .68). Because the distribution was
highly skewed, we performed a median split on the measure.
Note that the results for the numeracy measure were similar DEMO
Studies 2 through 4, and we used a median split for DEMO
in those studies as well (sample sizes were small in two DEMO our
studies, making quartile and other splits less viable). Thus, our
analyses compared the participants who were most numerate (9,
10, or 11 correct) with those who were less numerate (2–8 items
correct). Although we recognize that dichotomous splits are
associated with problems DEMO as loss of power, the skewness in
the variable justiﬁes our DEMO (MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher,
& Rucker, 2002). Results with quartile splits of numeracy were
similar to those with median splits in DEMO 1 and 4, which had
the largest sample sizes.
In a DEMO measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the
performance ratings, the DEMO framing effect was found. The
more positive frame elicited more positive ratings: Mean per-
formance ratings were 0.7 and 0.1 for the percentage-correct
(DEMO) and percentage-incorrect (negative) frames, respec-
tively, F(1, 96) 5 26.3, p < .0001, Z2 5 .54. Numeracy did not
have a significant main effect. The interaction of numeracy with
frame, however, was significant, F(1, 96) 5 5.6, p < .05, Z2 5
.11. As hypothesized, less numerate participants showed a
stronger DEMO effect than highly numerate participants1 (see
Fig. 1). This ﬁnding DEMO consistent with the highly numerate being

numerate. Mean differences between positive and DEMO frames were 1.3, 0.7,

more likely to transform numbers from one frame to a different
frame.
STUDY 2: NUMERACY AND RISK REPRESENTATION
Dehaene (1997) suggested that although children spend con-
siderable time learning the DEMO of math, they may not
really understand how to apply those DEMO even in adult-
hood. We propose, however, that the likelihood of such appli-
cation increases with numeracy, so that the highly numerate
should ﬁnd alternative frames of the same number more equally
inﬂuential in judgments DEMO with the less numerate. In
Study 2, we tested this hypothesis DEMO a paradigm developed
by Slovic, Monahan, and MacGregor (2000). DEMO conducted
studies in which experienced forensic psychologists and psy-
chiatrists were asked to judge the likelihood that a mental pa-
tient would commit an DEMO of violence. Clinicians told that ‘‘20
out of every 100’’ similar patients would likely commit an act of
violence (a frequency frame) were DEMO likely to refuse to dis-
charge the patient than were clinicians told that the patient had
a ‘‘20% chance’’ of committing an act of DEMO (a percentage
frame).
We hypothesized that highly numerate participants, presented
with a scenario similar to that used by Slovic et al. (2002), would
be more likely than less numerate participants to retrieve the
DEMO numerical principle and transform numbers from
one format to another (i.e., 20 out of 100 5 20%). Thus, we
expected that the format of presentation would affect judgments
less among the more numerate than DEMO the less numerate.

Method
Participants were 46 volunteers from a psychology course who
read the mental-patient scenario in either DEMO frequency format
(‘‘Of every 100 patients similar to Mr. Jones, 10 are estimated
to commit an act of violence to others during the DEMO several
months after discharge’’) or a percentage format that used the
DEMO wording but substituted ‘‘10% are estimated’’ for ‘‘10
are estimated.’’ Using a scale ranging from 1 (low risk)to6(high
risk), they rated the level of risk that Mr. Jones would harm
someone. They also DEMO to the same numeracy and de-
mographic items used in Study 1. In addition, they reported their
verbal and quantitative SAT scores, which DEMO as a proxy
measure for intelligence.
Results
High-numeracy participants in both conditions and low-nu-
meracy participants given the frequency frame rated Mr. Jones
as DEMO a medium risk. However, low-numeracy partici-
pants given the percentage format DEMO Mr. Jones as presenting
a significantly lower risk (see Fig. 2); this interaction between
format and numeracy was significant, F(1, 42) 5 4.0, p < .05,
Z2 5 .42.
Is the DEMO effect due to intelligence rather than nu-
meracy per se? Using DEMO scores as a proxy for intelligence, we
found that higher SAT DEMO (verbal and quantitative scores
combined) were associated with greater numeracy (DEMO 5 .26).
However, after numeracy scores were regressed onto SAT DEMO,
the numeracy residuals showed a significant pattern of results
similar to the pattern in Figure 2, specific contrast F(1, 30) 5
6.9, p < .05. We also obtained similar results when we controlled

only for SAT quantitative scores (the results were somewhat
weaker) and when we controlled for SAT verbal scores.
We suspect that high-numeracy participants have relatively
equal access to the percentage and frequency DEMO regardless
of the format in which information is presented to them, DEMO
low-numeracy participants consider only the format they are
given. Unpublished follow-up studies by Slovic showed that
representations of risk in the form of probabilities (10% of 100
patients) led to relatively benign images of one person, whereas
the ‘‘equivalent’’ frequentistic representations (10 out of 100
patients) created frightening images of violent patients (e.g.,
‘‘Some guy going crazy and killing someone’’). He suggested that
these affect-laden images likely induced greater DEMO
of risk in response to the frequency frame, compared with the
DEMO frame (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor,
2004). Although we did not test this idea directly in the present
study, it is possible that less numerate participants are inﬂu-
enced greatly by the DEMO imagery elicited by the fre-
quentistic format and do not have access to this affective
imagery when given the percentage format. At the same DEMO,
highly numerate participants may access the affect and affective
imagery regardless of whether they receive information in the
frequency or probability format, so that their risk perceptions
do not vary by format.
STUDY 3: DOES COMPETING AFFECTIVE
INFORMATION INFLUENCE THE LESS NUMERATE
MORE THAN THE HIGHLY NUMERATE?DEMO
Information in decision making appears to be processed using
two different modes of thinking: deliberative and affective-ex-
periential (Epstein, 1994; Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch,
2001; Sloman, 1996). How might DEMO in numerical
ability inﬂuence how information is processed?
The deliberative mode is conscious, reason based, and rela-
tively slow. In order to DEMO effectively in decisions
involving numbers, the individual must have the ability, moti-
vation, and capacity to process numerical information accu-
rately even though the logic of ‘‘mental arithmetic poses serious
problems for the human brain’’ (Dehaene, 1997, p. 118). When it
comes to deliberating about DEMO, the highly numerate
clearly have an advantage. The experiential mode of DEMO is
primarily affective2; it is automatic, associative, and fast. It DEMO
likely related to gist processing in fuzzy-trace theory (Reyna &
Brainerd, 1991) and may underlie humans’ fuzzy and approxi-
mate concept of DEMO (Dehaene, 1997). One of affect’s pri-
mary functions is to provide meaning and motivation to choice
processes (Damasio, 1994; Peters, DEMO press). We explored the
link between numeracy and affect in Studies 3 and 4.
In Study 3, we provided participants with two different rep-
resentations of the same number (frequency and probability) and
2Affect DEMO deﬁned as positive and negative feelings about a stimulus (e.g., a
bet).

tested whether numeracy affected decisions nonetheless. We
also began DEMO examine whether numerical ability may inﬂuence
the affective meaning of numbers. We measured both affect (the
valence of feelings) and affective precision (the clarity of those
feelings). Past studies have shown affective precision to DEMO
dict judgments independently of affect (Hsee, 1996; Mellers,
Richards, & Birnbaum, 1992).
We used a paradigm developed by Denes-Raj and Epstein
(1994), who showed that when offered a chance to win a prize by
drawing a red jelly bean from a bowl, participants often elected
to draw from a bowl containing a greater absolute number, but a
smaller proportion, of red beans (e.g., 9 in 100 or 9%) rather than
from a bowl with fewer red beans but a better probability of
winning (e.g., 1 in 10 or 10%)DEMO For these individuals, affective
images of 9 winning beans in the DEMO bowl appeared to dom-
inate the image of 1 winning bean in the small bowl. When in-
terviewed, many participants who had made nonoptimal choices
reported a conﬂict between what they objectively knew were the
better DEMO and how they felt about the bowl that offered a
greater number of winners. A number of subjects indicated that
the larger bowl ‘‘looked DEMO inviting.’’
Affect can be a direct ‘‘hit’’ from an object (similar DEMO Zajonc’s,
1980, notion that affect comes before conscious deliberation), DEMO
it can be the result of prior deliberation. We propose that in this
task, affect as a direct hit from the number of winning beans
conﬂicts with affect from thinking about the stated probability.
We hypothesized DEMO compared with the less numerate, the
highly numerate would be more DEMO to deliberate about and
compare probabilities and would draw from this deliberation a
more precise affective reaction that would guide their decisions.
Lacking a DEMO affective understanding of numbers, the less
numerate would rely instead on DEMO available but less rele-
vant affective sources, such as the number DEMO winning beans.
Thus, we predicted that less numerate adults, compared with
highly numerate adults, would draw more often from the larger,
affectively appealing bowl with less favorable objective proba-
bilities. We also expected that DEMO reactions to the larger
bowl, with its smaller probability of winning, would be more
precise and more negative among the highly numerate than
DEMO the less numerate.
Method
Participants (N 5 46) from Study 2 also completed Study 3
during the same session. They were shown two DEMO of bowls
of colored and white jelly beans and told to imagine that they
could select 1 bean, and if they selected a colored jelly bean,
they would win $5. The larger bowl, A, DEMO 100 jelly
beans, 9 of which were colored, and was labeled as having ‘‘9%
colored jelly beans’’; the smaller bowl, B, contained 10 jelly
beans, 1 of which was colored, and was labeled DEMO having ‘‘10%
colored jelly beans.’’ Participants were asked from which bowl
they would prefer to choose (on a scale that ranged from 6, DEMO
Volume 17—Number 5

preference for A, on the left, to DEMO in the middle, to 6, strong
preference for B, on DEMO right); preferences for A were recorded as
negative numbers prior to analysis. Participants were told to
imagine that once they chose a bowl, it would be placed behind
a screen, the beans would be mixed, and then they would draw
a bean blindly from their chosen bowl.
After indicating their preference, participants were asked a
question about their affective precision (‘‘How clear a feeling do
you have about the goodness or badness of Bowl A’s 9% chance
of winning?’’), which they DEMO to on a scale ranging from
0, completely unclear,to 6, completely clear. Finally, they were
asked about their affect (‘‘How good DEMO bad does Bowl A’s 9%
chance make you feel?’’), indicating their response on a 7-point
scale ranging from 3, very bad,to 13, very good.
Results
Lower numeracy was linked to more suboptimal choices; the
less numerate were significantly more likely to choose Bowl A
than were the highly numerate (33% and 5%, respectively),
w2(1, N 5 46) 5 5.2, p < .05; mean scaled DEMO was 1.7 for
the less numerate and 4.1 for the highly numerate, t(44) 52.5,
p < .05, d 5 0.75. As in Study 2, we controlled for the effect of
our proxy for intelligence. In this analysis, the less numerate
were still more likely to make an objectively worse choice than
the highly numerate (the difference was significant when con-
trolling for SAT verbal scores and was marginally significant
DEMO controlling for overall or quantitative SAT scores).
Analysis of the affect variables revealed that numeracy was
not significantly associated with affect about Bowl DEMO 9%
chance (mean affect 5 0.5 and 1.1 for low- and DEMO
meracy participants, respectively, p 5 .13, d 5 .46). DEMO,
the less numerate had less precise feelings about the 9% chance
than the highly numerate did (affective precision 5 3.7 and 5.0,
respectively), t(44) 5 2.6, p < .01, d 5 0.78.
STUDY 4: DO THE HIGHLY NUMERATE AND LESS
NUMERATE RETRIEVE DIFFERENT AFFECT FROM
PROBABILITIES AND NUMERICAL COMPARISONS?
In this study, we examined whether the highly numerate may
sometimes make less ‘‘rational’’ responses than the DEMO nu-
merate precisely because they focus on the detail of numbers
and draw more affective meaning from numerical comparisons.
We used a paradigm (reported in Slovic et al., 2004) in which one
group of subjects DEMO the attractiveness of a simple gamble (7
chances out of 36 DEMO win $9; otherwise, win $0) on a scale from 0
DEMO 20; a second group uses the same scale to rate a DEMO
gamble with a small loss (7 chances out of 36 to DEMO $9; 29
chances out of 36 to lose 5b). With DEMO paradigm, Slovic et al.
obtained data that were anomalous from the DEMO of
economic theory. The mean rating of the ﬁrst gamble was 9.4.
When the possible loss of 5b was added to the gamble, the mean
Volume 17—Number 5
attractiveness jumped to 14.9, and there was almost no overlap
between the distributions of responses for the two groups.
We DEMO that these curious ﬁndings can be explained
by affect and affective precision. According to this view, a
probability maps relatively precisely onto the attractiveness
scale, because it has an upper and lower bound and people know
where a given value falls within that range. The highly numerate,
DEMO are expected to deliberate more about numbers than the less
numerate, DEMO draw a more precise affective reaction from
probability’s boundedness. In contrast, DEMO mapping of a dollar
outcome (e.g., $9) onto the scale DEMO less precise, reﬂecting a
failure to know whether $9 is good DEMO bad, attractive or unat-
tractive. Thus, the impression of the gamble offering a win of $9
and no losing payoff is dominated by DEMO rather unattractive
impression produced by the 7/36 probability of winning. How-
ever, adding a very small loss to the payoff dimension puts the $9
payoff in perspective (i.e., it makes the payoff more affectively
DEMO to the subject) and gives it meaning. The combination of
a DEMO $9 gain and a possible 5b loss has a very attractive
win/lose ratio, leading to a relatively precise mapping onto the
upper part of the attractiveness scale. Whereas the imprecise
mapping of the $9 when DEMO is not combined with a loss carries
little weight, the more DEMO and favorable impression of the $9
in the context of the small loss carries more weight, thus leading
to an increase in the overall favorability of the gamble. We
reasoned, however, that the ease of DEMO results from the $9:
5b bet creating a perception of upper and lower bounds
similar to probability’s boundedness and similar to comparing
the DEMO and 10% probabilities in Study 3. On the basis of the
results in Study 3, we hypothesized that the highly numerate
would draw more affective meaning from the $9:5b compar-
ison than the less numerate DEMO, and thus would show a
greater difference in their ratings of DEMO two bets.
Method
Participants were 171 volunteers from a psychology depart-
ment’s subject pool (54% female; mean age 5 19). In a DEMO
subjects design, participants were asked to rate their opinion
about the DEMO of playing a bet, using a 21-point scale
ranging from 0, not at all an attractive bet,to20, extremely at-
tractive bet. Half of the participants responded to a bet that
consisted of ‘‘7/36 DEMO to win $9 and 29/36 chances to win
nothing’’ (the DEMO bet), and the other half of the participants
responded to the bet ‘‘7/36 chances to win $9 and 29/36 chances
to DEMO 5b’’ (the loss bet). Participants were then asked to rate
DEMO affect and affective precision toward both the $9 win and
the 7/36 chance of winning, using the same scales described in
Study 3. They reported SAT verbal and quantitative scores and
completed the numeracy scale DEMO demographic items last.
Results
Participants high in numeracy rated the objectively better no-
loss bet as less attractive than the loss bet, t(89) 5 3.1, p < .01

Numeracy and Decision Making

(see Fig. 3), whereas those lower in numeracy rated the two bets
the same on average. A regression using the attractiveness DEMO
as the dependent variable and bet condition (coded as no loss DEMO
0 and loss 5 1), numeracy (0 5 low and DEMO 5 high), and their
interaction as independent variables revealed only a significant
interaction, t(1) 5 2.2, p < .05, d DEMO 0.34. The analysis control-
ling for SATscores showed that the highly numerate who respond-
ed to the loss bet rated their bet as more DEMO than did the
other three groups, specific contrast F(1, 151) 5 9.1, p < .01.
The highly numerate had less negative DEMO about the 7/36
chances of winning than the less numerate did (mean affect 5
0.0 and 0.6, respectively), t(169) 5 2.7, p < .01, d 5 0.44.
They also reported more DEMO feelings about the 7/36 chances of
winning (mean affective precision DEMO 4.5 and 3.9, respectively),
t(149) 5 2.4, p < .05, d 5 0.38. The highly numerate had more
positive affect toward the $9 win in the loss condition than in the
no-loss DEMO, whereas the less numerate showed no sig-
nificant differences in affect DEMO the conditions, mean af-
fect 5 1.9 and 1.3 for the DEMO numerate in the loss and no-loss
conditions, t(89) 5 2.3, p < .05, d 5 0.47, and mean affect 5 1.0
and 1.3 for the less numerate in the same conditions, n.s. Af-
fective precision to the $9 showed no significant differences.
In summary, the highly numerate found the loss bet more at-
tractive than the no-loss DEMO; participants lower in numeracy
rated the loss and no-loss bets as DEMO attractive. These
ﬁndings suggest that the highly numerate may sometimes make
worse decisions than the less numerate (although it could be
argued that the small loss allowed only the highly numerate to
recognize the goodness of DEMO positive expected-value bet). The
difference between the groups was linked with different feelings
that they derived from the numbers. The highly numerate had
DEMO clear and less negative affect toward the 7/36 chances of
winning. In addition, they had greater positive affect toward the
$9, particularly DEMO the loss condition.
412
These results are consistent with our hypothesis that com-
pared with the less numerate, the highly numerate tend to derive
more affective meaning (generally stronger or more precise af-
fective meaning) DEMO probabilities and numerical comparisons.
We were also interested, however, in whether these affective
differences mediated the impact of numeracy on the attrac-
tiveness DEMO To do this, we examined whether ratings of
affect toward the DEMO/36 chance of winning mediated any main
effect of numeracy on attractiveness ratings. First, a regression
of the attractiveness scores indicated a significant main effect of
numeracy on attractiveness, F(1, 169) 5 8.0, DEMO < .01. Second, in
a regression of affect toward the 7/DEMO chances of winning, high-
numeracy participants had less negative affect toward DEMO 7/36
chances than those who were less numerate, F(1, 169) 5 7.2,
p < .01. A ﬁnal regression of attractiveness ratings included
affect to the 7/36 chances and numeracy as independent DEMO
ables. Consistent with the hypothesized mediation, the inﬂuence
of numeracy on DEMO was no longer significant, but
participants with greater positive affect toward DEMO 7/36 chance
rated the bet as more attractive, b 5 DEMO, t(1) 5 5.3, p < .001;
Sobel z DEMO 2.4, p < .05. Precision of affect toward the 7/36
DEMO did not demonstrate mediation.
Finally, we tested whether ratings of affect DEMO the $9 win
mediated the effect of high numeracy on the differential at-
tractiveness of the loss and no-loss bets. We ﬁrst demonstrated
that DEMO participants in the loss condition rated their
affect toward the $9 win as more positive than other participants
did, F(1, 169) 5 8.5, p < .01. A second regression showed that
both the numeracy-by-condition interaction and affect toward
the $9 were significant predictors of attractiveness ratings. DEMO
fect toward the $9 appeared to partially mediate the relation

GENERAL DISCUSSION
A series of four studies explored how DEMO ability to understand
and transform probability numbers relates to performance on
judgment and decision tasks. Each task involved the processing
of numbers; some tasks involved the processing of affect from the
numbers themselves or from a DEMO source. Findings from
Studies 1 and 2 were consistent with our hypothesis that com-
pared with low-numeracy adults, high-numeracy adults are
more likely to retrieve and use appropriate numerical principles
and transform numbers presented in one DEMO to a different
frame. We believe that low-numeracy decision makers are left
with information that is less complete and less understood,
lacking in DEMO complexity and richness available to the more
numerate. Results from Studies 3 and 4 were consistent with our
hypothesis that the highly numerate tend DEMO draw more affective
meaning from probabilities and numerical comparisons than the

less numerate do. Study 3 demonstrated that the DEMO numerate
were more inﬂuenced by an irrelevant affective source, perhaps
because DEMO drew less precise affective meaning from relevant
numbers. In Study 4, DEMO inﬂuence of numeracy on the attrac-
tiveness of the bet was partially mediated by affect. The alter-
native hypothesis that numeracy’s effect on decisions DEMO due to
general intelligence was not supported by these studies.
The present research is an initial attempt to examine the roles
of numeracy and DEMO in decision making. We examined the
extent to which numerical ability serves as a mediator of deci-
sion performance (helping performance in some situations and
hurting performance in others). Our measure of numeracy re-
quires DEMO development, but demonstrated fairly strong re-
lations with decisions nonetheless. We DEMO examined whether
numeracy inﬂuences affect and affective precision and found
that affect partially mediates the inﬂuence of numeracy in some
decisions. This research adds DEMO the growing body of knowledge
concerning how affective and deliberative ways of thinking may
inﬂuence important effects in decision making. It also demon-
strates DEMO individuals may differ in the type of assistance they
need in making decisions. Those low in numerical ability may
need different decision aids than DEMO high in numerical ability.
