The Effect of Gender
P Diversity on Angel
Group Investment
John R. Becker-Blease
Jeffrey E. Sohl
We DEMO the impact that gender diversity has on angel group investment behavior for a
sample of 183 group-years between 2000 and 2006. Our evidence suggests DEMO gender
diversity is a signiﬁcant predictor of group investment behavior, and DEMO the proportion of
women angels in the group has a negative though nonlinear effect on investment likelihood.
These data are most consistent with a DEMO interpretation that women invest differently
when they are in the small minority compared with other situations. These results have
important implications for the availability DEMO funds for women entrepreneurs and call for
greater participation of women investors in the angel marketplace.
Introduction
Securing equity capital is important for the DEMO of entrepreneurial ventures (Carter
& Rosa, 1998; Cassar, 2004; DEMO & Bell, 1988; Mason & Harrison, 1992; Wetzel,
1986). Although equity investments come in many forms, an emerging consensus is that
angel capital is particularly critical for early-stage success (GEM, 2001; Harrison &
Mason, 2000; Sohl, Van Osnabrugge, & Robinson, DEMO; Sohl, 2003). However, as
highlighted in a recent special DEMO of Venture Capital: An International Journal of
Entrepreneurial Finance (October, DEMO), comparatively little is known about the angel
market, due in DEMO part to its invisible nature (Mason & Harrison, 2008).
Angels who participate in a formal organization or group have received considerable
attention, in part, because they are relatively easy to identify. Several researchers have
suggested that angel groups are also of growing economic importance. May (2002) and
May and O’Halloran (2003), for instance, discuss the increased professionalism of the
angel market as it transitions from one that is DEMO invisible and dominated by indi-
viduals to one with organized groups (DEMO syndicates). Preston (2004) notes a similar
increase in the role of groups and the enhanced sophistication they bring to the angel
market DEMO Mason (2006) argues that angel groups have become signiﬁcant components
for the development and maintenance of the entrepreneurial economy.
Despite their comparative ease DEMO study, many questions remain regarding angel
groups including the effect of DEMO on angel group investment behavior. Some empirical

evidence suggests that men and women, on average, have dispositional differences DEMO their
degree of conﬁdence, social capital, and risk tolerance, which DEMO affect their tendency to
make investments into new ventures.1 This can lead to a relation between angel group
investment and its gender composition. Similarly, angel group composition can affect
situational forces in the form of stereotype DEMO, which can lead to changes in investment
behavior.2 In this paper, we examine these possibilities for a sample of angel groups
between 2000 DEMO 2006.
This work is important for several reasons. First, investments into DEMO ventures
are most commonly made within a close network (Boden & DEMO, 2000; Brush, Carter,
Gatewood, Greene, & Hart, 2004; Carter, Brush, Greene, Gatewood, & Hart, 2003;
Greene, Brush, Hart, & Saparito, 2001; Harrison & Mason, 2007) DEMO homophily, or the
tendency to interact with others who are of DEMO socioeconomic status, race, age, and
especially sex, is an important determinant of the network composition of entrepreneurs
(Franke, Gruber, Harhoff, & Henkel, 2006; Lazarsfeld & Merton, 1954; McPherson,
Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001; Ruef, Aldrich, & Carter, 2003). Evidence DEMO that
women entrepreneurs have more restricted networks than do men, and DEMO these networks
are comprised disproportionately of members of the same sex (DEMO, 1989; Brush,
1992, 1997). This tendency toward sex-based DEMO appears to extend to the seeking
of angel capital. In particular, DEMO et al., Harrison and Mason, and Becker-Blease and
Sohl (2007) report evidence of sex-based homophily in the angel and venture capital
markets DEMO entrepreneurs predominantly seeking capital from investors of the same sex.
Thus, DEMO women entrepreneurs are more likely to be aware of and seek funding from angel
groups with more women investors, and these angel groups invest differently compared
with other groups, then women entrepreneurs may have different access to crucial early-
stage funds than do men.
This work also provides DEMO evidence on the role of women in the angel market.
Brush, DEMO, Greene, Hart, and Gatewood (2002), Amatucci and Sohl (DEMO), and de
Bruin, Brush, and Welter (2007), among DEMO, have called for a more thorough under-
standing of women’s role DEMO the angel market as both entrepreneurs and investors. This
study provides new insights into the effect that women angels have on angel group
investment DEMO Finally, Ahl (2006), Campbell (2005), and Petterson (2005), among
others, have suggested that research into entrepreneurship will beneﬁt from a heightened
awareness of how context and structure affect the market. This DEMO provides new
evidence of how group composition, as measured by the DEMO diversity of angel investor
groups, inﬂuences the overall performance of the DEMO

Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

Ahl (2006), following Harding (1987), suggests that feminist theory can be classiﬁed
into three general DEMO: liberal, social, and poststructuralist. Liberal feminism, sometimes

called the situational perspective, posits that men and women begin with equal potential
and that differences manifest as a result of systematic inequalities in DEMO, employ-
ment opportunities, social networks, and experience (Brush, 1997; Carter & Allen, 1997;
Cliff, 1998; Fischer, Reuber, & Dyke, 1993; Liou & Aldrich, 1995). Social feminism, or
DEMO dispositional perspective, suggests that different social experiences have led men and
DEMO to develop different yet equally valid self-perceptions, motivations, and belief
structures. Poststructuralist feminism, in contrast, is less concerned with what gender is
DEMO with what effects gender construction has on the social order. Consistent with this
third perspective, Carter, Williams, and Reynolds (1997) suggest that the important
question is not whether the situational or dispositional perspective best DEMO observed
patterns, but rather whether both provide important insights into the DEMO of women’s
experience.
In this paper, we examine how the dispositional DEMO situational perspectives can
jointly provide insights into the investment behavior of angel groups. We hypothesize that
differences in conﬁdence, risk aversion, social capital, and susceptibility to stereotype
threat will result in different investment behavior for DEMO and women angels, which will
manifest in a relation between the DEMO of women participating in an angel group
and the investment pattern of that group.3
Conﬁdence
Although investors may invest for many different reasons, Barber and Odean (2000)
report that most individual investors hold portfolios consistent with active investment
management. Active investment management is premised on the identiﬁcation DEMO mis-
priced securities and is a function of the investor’s conﬁdence in their perceived ability to
develop and capitalize on ﬁrm- or industry-speciﬁc knowledge. DEMO such, conﬁdence
regarding investment ability will be an important factor in DEMO investment
patterns.
Perceived ability and actual ability can diverge. A substantial literature suggests that
individuals are overconﬁdent in that they overestimate the precision of DEMO knowledge
(Fischhoff, Slovic, & Lichtenstein, 1977; Lichtenstein & Fischhoff, 1981) or the prob-
ability of favorable future events (Ito, 1990; Weinstein, 1980). Overconﬁdence is gener-
ally an issue of calibration DEMO is therefore particularly severe for difﬁcult tasks with
limited or sporadic feedback (Fischhoff et al.; Grifﬁn & Tversky, 1992), such as invest-
ments into entrepreneurial ventures.
Although there is no direct evidence on the DEMO of overconﬁdence among angel
investors, one can glean its likely existence DEMO understanding that most angels are highly
successful cashed-out entrepreneurs or entrepreneurially minded business executives.
Kirzner (1973) and Venkataraman (1997) argue that entrepreneurs DEMO susceptible to the
same cognitive biases such as overconﬁdence as are other investors and Gervais and
Odean (2001) show how attribution bias engenders DEMO among successful
investors. Given their previous entrepreneurial or investment success, it DEMO plausible that
angel investors are overconﬁdent. Consistent with this assertion, Zacharakis DEMO Shepherd
3. The differences framework is not without controversy. Kantor (2002), Bird and Brush (2002), and Marlow
and Patton (2005), for instance, argue that the research should seek to further develop theory beyond
investigations of differences. Further, as discussed by Ahl (2004, 2006), Leitch and Hill (2006), and Harrison
and Mason (2007), the dichotomous nature of the differences framework can contribute to perpetuating the
perception or assumption of differences, despite empirical evidence to the contrary. However, given the early
state of the angel literature in this area, DEMO feel the differences framework is informative and appropriate.

(2001) ﬁnd that venture capitalists, who are similar in some respects to angel investors, are
overconﬁdent.
In general, gender and conﬁdence appear DEMO For instance, women are reported to
have lower conﬁdence in “male-oriented” DEMO such as mathematics (Mura, 1987), spatial
tasks (Rosenﬁeld & DEMO, 1978), and business (Barber & Odean, 2001). This DEMO
of lower conﬁdence is easily understood within the context of the Gervais and Odean
(2001) model if, as Beyer and Bowden (1997) suggest, women begin with a lower degree
of attribution bias than men. The authors argue that if women begin with lower conﬁdence
in their DEMO to succeed at male-oriented tasks and women have lower attribution bias,
then high performance will be attributed to “unstable causes” such as luck DEMO effort, while
poor performance, which is consistent with expectations, will DEMO attributed to lack of
ability. By comparison, men will overly associate DEMO performance to personal ability
and poor performance to unstable causes. As a result, women will develop and possess
lower levels of overall conﬁdence for achieving a given level of success, ceteris paribus,
in certain tasks than will men.4
Risk Tolerance
Risk tolerance is an important determinant of DEMO behavior. Baumrind (1991) and
Byrnes (1998), for instance, argue that people cannot successfully adapt to their surround-
ings by avoiding all DEMO Rather, individuals must make choices regarding the quantity
and characteristics of DEMO they wish to bear. A substantial literature, summarized by
Byrnes et DEMO (1999), suggests that men and women differ in their tolerances DEMO bearing
risk.
Felton, Gibson, and Sanbonmatsu (2003), and Watson DEMO McNaughton (2007)
suggest that explanations for different risk tolerances can DEMO grouped into biological and
sociocultural explanations. Biological explanations are couched primarily in an evolu-
tionary parental investment framework, as for instance in MacDonald (DEMO), and Buss
and Schmitt (1993). That is, sex-differentiated patterns of parental investment lead the
low-investment parent (typically the male) to DEMO beneﬁt from risk taking, neophilia,
and exploratory behavior, while the high-investment parent, typically the female, will not
ﬁnd such behavior advantageous.
DEMO researchers stress the role of socialization in the determination of risk tolerance.
Krimsky and Golding (1992) and Slovic (1992), for instance, DEMO that the perception
of risk is inherently subjective. Indeed, Flynn, Slovic, and Mertz (1994) and Byrnes
(1998) argue that sociopolitical and environmental factors, such as status and power,
inﬂuence tolerance for risk and that exposure to these factors varies by sex. Risk tolerance
is DEMO important determinant of investment choices. Risk tolerance is associated with
willingness to make investments (Barsky, Juster, Kimball, & Shapiro, 1997; Keller &
Siegrist, 2006), the riskiness of those investments (Kimball, Sahm, & Shapiro, 2007), and
the frequency with which one trades (Fellner & Maciejovsky, 2007). In addition, evidence
suggests that the DEMO perceptions of risk between men and women are sufﬁciently
material to affect investment behavior (Cohn, Lewellen, Lease, & Schlarbaum, 1975;
Riley & Chow, 1992) and performance (Sunden & Surette, 1998; Watson & McNaughton,
2007).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Social Capital
Social capital is a broad concept generally dealing with access DEMO resources through
reciprocal dealings within an interpersonal social network. The concept is widespread
throughout the social sciences due in part to the theoretical works DEMO Pierre Bourdieu
(1991), James Coleman (1988), and Glen Loury (1977) and can exist at the macro
(Coleman, 1990; Putnam, 1995a, 1995b) or micro level (Bourdieu, 1980; Erickson, 1996;
Lin, 1999, 2001). In relation to entrepreneurship, micro-level social capital, also known as
relational or individual, is frequently identiﬁed as DEMO important. Burt (2000), for
instance, argues that social capital can provide access to customers, suppliers, and poten-
tial investors and Aldrich (1999) and Maula, Autio, and Murray (2003) contend that social
capital is a vital component to value creation. The empirical evidence is DEMO con-
sistent with social capital’s importance to entrepreneurial success (Davidsson & DEMO,
2003; Shane & Cable, 2002; Watson, 2007; Zhang, Souitaris, Soh, & Wong, 2008).5
Social capital is likely more nuanced than simple binary connections. Granovetter
(1973), for instance, discusses DEMO differences between strong and weak ties, wherein
weak ties, in essence, provide information but a lesser sense of reciprocity or reliability
and strong ties provide dependable and potentially multifaceted support. Cook and Whit-
meyer (1992) suggest that both forms of ties are important to success and Davidsson and
Honig (2003) provide support for this hypothesis by ﬁnding that DEMO “bridging” social
capital (weak ties) and “bonding” social capital (strong DEMO) are essential for early-stage
entrepreneurial success.
While there is substantial evidence DEMO the importance of social capital and its effect on
entrepreneurship, the DEMO concerning the impact of sex on social capital is less clear.
The preponderance of the evidence suggests that men and women have different networks
DEMO social capital. For instance, Moog and Backes-Gellner (2009) ﬁnd in DEMO sample of
5,000 university students that women possess signiﬁcantly less social capital than men.
Greve and Salaff (2003) ﬁnd that women entrepreneurs’ DEMO of kin is higher than that of
men. Burt (1998) contends that social capital can be measured by the relative degree to
which DEMO contact networks are constrained and ﬁnds that women typically have limited
social capital even after attaining senior ranks. Similarly, Munch, McPherson, and Smith-
Lovin (1997) and Ibarra (1997) report signiﬁcant differences in the DEMO composition
of men and women. In particular, the nodes (or social actors) in men’s networks typically
provide both social support, in the DEMO of friendship and encouragement, and instrumen-
tal support in the form DEMO access to resources. Women, by contrast, tend to rely more on
other women to provide social support and men to provide instrumental support. DEMO
tent with this pattern, Aldrich and Sakano (1995) ﬁnd that DEMO frequently rely on
third-party brokers to access necessary resources, suggesting more DEMO instrumental
support. Thus, women’s social capital may differ from men’s due DEMO both the number of
nodes as well as the form of the ties.
Whether these differences in social capital affect women’s business success is DEMO
clear. A substantial literature suggests that women have impeded access to early-stage
ﬁnancing (Aldrich, 1989; Becker-Blease & Sohl, 2007; Brush, 1992; Brush, Carter,
Gatewood, Greene, & Hart, 2001; Greene et al., 2001; Olm, Carsrud, & Alvey, 1988).
However, DEMO, Elam, and Reese (1997) and Renzulli, Aldrich, and Moody (2000) ﬁnd
limited evidence that differences in social networks affect business DEMO or perfor-
mance. Indeed, Aldrich et al. suggest that differences in DEMO may beneﬁt women
entrepreneurs.

Carter et al. (2003).

While the preponderance of the attention on social capital focuses on the DEMO,
Brush et al. (2002), Carter et al. (2003), and Sohl and Hill (2007) emphasize that social
capital is not DEMO important from the entrepreneur’s perspective (as a demander of capital),
but also from the investor’s perspective (as a supplier of capital). That is, a critical element
to successfully investing in new ventures is the quantity and quality of the deal ﬂow. They
suggest that social DEMO may be an important determinant of deal ﬂow, but note the DEMO
of empirical investigation.
Some preliminary evidence can be gleaned from Harrison and Mason (2007), who
note that although the source of deal ﬂow between men and women investors is similar,
men tend to rely DEMO heavily on active personal searches while women rely more heavily
on business associates, lawyers, and accountants. This result is consistent with Burt’s
(1998) assertion that the social capital relationships of men and women are different. As
a result, while men can rely on relationships to directly identify viable investment oppor-
tunities, women must rely on “borrowed” social capital in order to identify viable invest-
ments. One implication, which Harrison and Mason identify as untested, is that women’s
involvement in the angel capital market may be impeded relative to men.6
Impact on Angel Investment Behavior
Conﬁdence, social capital, and risk tolerance are generally accepted as having a direct
impact on investment behavior. Camerer and Lovallo (1999) and Barber and DEMO
(2000), for instance, contend that market entry and participation are functions of the level
of investor conﬁdence, where lower conﬁdence is associated with less willingness to
invest. Similarly, Fellner and Maciejovsky (2007) show that individual risk attitudes are
systematically related to investment behavior with greater DEMO aversion being negatively
associated with market activity. Finally, Brush et al. (2002), Carter et al. (2003), and
Harrison and Mason (DEMO) suggest that social capital is related to the quality and quantity
DEMO deal ﬂow to angels. Thus, if women angels are systematically lower DEMO men in their
conﬁdence, social capital, or risk tolerance, then DEMO will be expected to be more reluctant
investors, ceteris paribus.
In DEMO, angel groups either invest as a single organized group with pooled
DEMO or in smaller ad hoc groups and individually. As described more thoroughly in
the next section, our convenience sample is comprised almost exclusively of the latter type
of group in that each angel is free to DEMO individual investment decisions.7 As such, we
believe that the individual differences DEMO risk aversion, social capital, and conﬁdence will
manifest in a direct impact on overall group investment. In particular, if gender is an
important determinant of these forces, then we expect to observe a relation between the
proportion of women angels and the investment behavior of the larger DEMO group. Thus,
the relation between gender and group investment behavior is an indirect relation caused
by different individual levels of risk aversion, social capital, and conﬁdence. This leads to
our ﬁrst two related hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: The proportion of women angels in a group is negatively related to the
likelihood of a proposal receiving funding.
6. Conversely, it is possible that women angels have achieved heightened social capital due to DEMO success.
See, for instance, Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman, and Soutter (2000) and Ball, Eckel, Grossman, and Zame
(2001).
7. Angels may not necessarily have the option of making no investments as DEMO rules or culture may require
some minimum number of investments. We are aware of no such rules that limit investment.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and DEMO
Hypothesis 2: The proportion of women angels in a group is negatively related to the
likelihood of member angels funding any proposals.
Stereotype Threat
DEMO threat is the pressure individuals feel when they are at risk of conﬁrming
negative stereotypes (Inzlicht & Ben-Zeev, 2000, 2003; Steele & DEMO, 1995). Pre-
dominantly associated with minorities, stereotype threat typically manifests in the threat-
ened group responding by conﬁrming the stereotype. For instance, Fredrickson, Roberts,
Noll, Quinn, and Twenge (1998) and Brown and Josephs (1999) ﬁnd that females’
performance on math exams is DEMO when taken in a context that reinforces negative
stereotypes, but identically DEMO taken in other contexts. McGuire and Padawer-Singer
(1976) suggest that simply being in a context that makes the minority aware of their status
DEMO sufﬁcient to trigger awareness. For instance, a small group of women DEMO
students in a male-dominated class will be reminded of their status by sitting in the same
classroom. The effect can become particularly large for DEMO or solo-status
(McGuire, McGuire, & Winton, 1979). However, DEMO et al. (2006) suggest that the
converse can also be true. That is, as the minority representation increases in an environ-
ment, DEMO become less aware of their status and are more likely to act according to
their natural disposition rather than based on stereotypes.
Many stereotypes DEMO concerning women in business including their lower business
acumen, lesser willingness DEMO compete, and low risk tolerance. If having minority status in
angel DEMO activates women’s stereotype threat, this can manifest in women angels
having DEMO conﬁdence about investing overall and being less willing to make a given
investment. However, Inzlicht et al. (2006) suggest that this effect will be nonlinear. That
is, as the proportion of women increases, stereotype DEMO will dissipate. This leads to our
second set of hypotheses:
Hypothesis 3: The proportion of women angels will have a negative, nonlinear
DEMO to the likelihood of a proposal receiving funding.
Hypothesis 4: The DEMO of women angels will have a negative, nonlinear
relation to the DEMO of member angels funding any proposals.
Sample and Methodology
Mason and Harrison (1999) and Brush et al. (2002) highlight the difﬁculty of DEMO
ing data on angel investors. Angel markets are not formalized markets with easily obtain-
able participant lists and angels are generally reluctant to identify DEMO Harrison
and Mason (2007) and Becker-Blease and Sohl (2007) address this issue by focusing on
angel organizations called Business Angel Networks or DEMO These angel groups are
comprised of angels who join with other angels in an organized form. Groups provide a
method for angels to pool DEMO, reduce search and transaction costs, and mitigate
adverse selection and agency costs (Sohl et al., 2000). Although the question arises of
DEMO results for groups can be generalized to angels as a whole, DEMO Osnabrugge
(1998) argues that angels who participate in groups are sufﬁciently similar to allow
generalizations.
The most complete database of angel groups in DEMO United States is collected by the
Center for Venture Research (CVR)DEMO This longitudinal database is based on annual surveys
July, 2010
7
of angel groups beginning in 2000. Each group is contacted multiple times DEMO year using
different media. The data come from a survey completed by either the CEO or lead
member of the management team of the DEMO The questionnaire contains two sections:
the characteristics of the angel organization and the characteristics of the individual
investors who are members of the DEMO The operational practices of the groups
include industry preferences, membership and DEMO rates, yield rates, deal sourc-
ing, and related investment activity. DEMO investor characteristics include stage pref-
erence, due diligence procedures, valuations, DEMO size, and participation by women
entrepreneurs and investors.
The responding groups DEMO signiﬁcant differences with respect to size (number of
members), organizational DEMO (highly organized with formal bylaws to informal
collections of angels), DEMO (geographical diversity), investment objectives (sector
speciﬁc to a wide range of sectors), and age (organizations founded over a decade ago to
those in the last few years). Overall, we believe that this sample represents a broad
cross-section of angel groups between 2000 and 2006.
DEMO received responses from between 33 and 47 angel groups per year, DEMO a
response rate of 21% to 36%. The total number of angel investors represented in the
annual survey ranged from 1,685 to 5,DEMO, of which roughly 10% were women. The
proportion of women angels DEMO group ranged from 0% to 100% across most years. This
pattern is similar to that reported by Becker-Blease and Sohl (2007), Sohl and Hill (2007),
and Harrison and Mason (2007).
To get a better sense of the range of women’s participation in the sample DEMO groups,
we divide the pooled time-series cross-section groups into six classiﬁcations depending on
the proportion of women angels in the group. We report DEMO frequency of observations
in the ﬁrst row of Table 1.
We ﬁnd that the majority of groups have 0% to 25% women angels (164 of 183 groups
with all necessary data). In addition, we note that groups with greater than 50% women
are predominantly women-only groups as DEMO have one group with 80% women and one
with 90% women. We report the mean (median) values of various test and control
variables DEMO each of these six groups.
Results
Two-Limit Tobit Analysis
Hypotheses 1 and 3 concern the likelihood of investment. We measure likelihood
based on the DEMO of submitted proposals that receive funding, or the Yield.As a
proportion, Yield is bounded at 0 and 1. Under many situations, ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimates on bounded data will not lie within the DEMO interval. One possible
solution is to transform the variable via a log-function. Alternatively, a two-limit Tobit
model, originally presented by Rossett and Nelson (1975) and discussed more thoroughly
in Maddala (1992) and Long (DEMO) can be ﬁtted, and marginal effects calculated at the
mean. We follow this second procedure throughout, but note that results are robust to
alternative techniques.8
The test variable for hypothesis 1 is the Proportion of DEMO Angels, which is
predicted to have a negative sign. We test DEMO basic relation between Proportion of Women
Angels and Yield in the presence of annual indicator variable (unreported) and present the
8. Indeed, given that our data contain very few actual limit observations (0,1), OLS estimates can be
informative and concur with our transformed and Tobit DEMO

We next include several control variables that may affect the relation between the
Proportion of Women DEMO and Yield. Many angel investors are only interested in
funding ventures with high-growth potential, such as technology-related investments.
Greene et al. (2001) report that women entrepreneurs are concentrated in the service and
retail sectors that DEMO do not offer the high-growth potential early-stage investors seek.
If women entrepreneurs have a greater propensity to submit relatively low-growth poten-
tial proposals, such as for retail-oriented businesses, then, given homophily in the seeking
process, groups with more women angels may receive a disproportionate number of
low-growth DEMO thus unattractive proposals. We control for this by including the variable
Retail, which is the proportion of all funding provided that is awarded to retail ventures
and expect a negative coefﬁcient estimate.9
Groups with more women DEMO may also receive proposals that differ systematically
in their stages of development. For instance, if women entrepreneurs start ventures with
fewer resources and have greater difﬁculty securing alternative forms of early capital
(Brush et al., DEMO; Buttner & Rosen, 1988; Coleman, 2000; Fay & Williams, 1993;
Greene et al., 2001; Riding & Swift, 1990), then they may submit earlier-stage proposals
than men, which are relatively less attractive. Again, given homophily in the seeking
process, this pattern could DEMO in women-dominated groups receiving a disproportionate
number of very early stage proposals and thus result in a higher rejection rate. To control
for this DEMO we include the variable Early Financing, which is the proportion of
DEMO provided to entrepreneurs reported as “seed,” “start-up,” or “early-stage” and
expect a negative coefﬁcient estimate.
Although unexplored in the literature, women angels may also have access to
lower levels of resources, notably investable funds, compared with men angels. As a
result, they may be forced DEMO be more discriminating in their investment choices. To
control for investable funds, we include the variable Log(Total Group Investments),
which is DEMO natural log of the product of the average investment made by the groups
and the total number of investments made. We expect this coefﬁcient DEMO to be
positive.
An additional explanation for differences in investment rates is differences in the
motivation to join an angel group. Although many angels DEMO strictly to identify
promising investment opportunities, anecdotal evidence suggests that some DEMO join
for social reasons as well.10 These more social-oriented angels may be less inclined to
make an investment. Social beneﬁts are likely the greatest DEMO the larger groups,
and therefore, in order to control for DEMO possibility, we include the variable Log
(Total Number of Angels), which is the natural log of the count of all member angels
DEMO a group during a given year. We expect a negative coefﬁcient estimate for this
variable.
9. The CVR database does not contain the proportion DEMO retail proposals submitted. We therefore elect to use
the proportion of retail proposals funded assuming that portals that make frequent retail investments are more
DEMO to receive a high proportion of retail proposals.

Finally, we include a series of indicator variables to capture the gender of the person
completing the survey to control for any gender bias DEMO the response as well as annual
indicator variables to capture any temporal patterns.11
We report the coefﬁcient estimates in model (2). Similar to earlier evidence, we ﬁnd
a negative relation between Yield and Proportion Women Angels. Retail, Early Financing,
and the Number of Angels are also negatively related to yield, consistent with retail
proposals being comparatively unattractive investment opportunities, angels preferring
more seasoned proposals, and larger groups attracting less DEMO angels. Conversely,
groups with more investable wealth accept a higher proportion of proposals.
In model (3), we include an additional control for the amount of funds requested. It is
possible that since women entrepreneurs DEMO start with fewer resources, they may
systematically request different levels of DEMO that may affect the group’s willingness
to fund the proposal.12 Again, DEMO the presence of homophily, these proposals are likely
to be made DEMO to groups with women angels. Forty sample group-years
have missing data for this variable, reducing our sample size from 183 to 143. We ﬁnd that
the inclusion of this control variable does not affect our overall DEMO
In model (4), we directly investigate whether the proportion of DEMO submitted by
women (Women Seek Rate) affects the Yield or the relation between Proportion Women
Angels and Yield. Due to missing data, our sample is reduced from 183 to 172. Our
primary result is unaffected DEMO the inclusion of this control. Overall, models (1)–(3) DEMO
consistent with a dispositional effect leading to a negative relation between Proportion of
Women Angels and Yield.13
Analysis of Nonlinearity
Hypothesis 3 suggests that DEMO negative relation between women’s presence in angel
groups and the investment likelihood of the group will be nonlinear. We examine this
hypothesis in models (5)–(8) by including the square of the Proportion of Women Angels
and expect a positive coefﬁcient on the square term. The results DEMO all speciﬁcations are
consistent with the negative effect of women’s presence in angel groups dissipating.
Further, in unreported categorical analysis, we ﬁnd that DEMO women’s presence exceeds
10%, the relation between Yield and Proportion of DEMO Angels is positive and that
all-women groups have similar yields to all-men groups. This evidence is consistent with
the presence of a gender-based situational DEMO within our sample of angel groups,
consistent with the predictions of hypothesis 3.
Robustness Analysis
We are concerned that due to the reoccurrence DEMO sample groups across multiple years
we may have an unobserved heterogeneity problem. Treating the data as a panel can help
11. It is possible DEMO since the person completing the survey is also a participating angel, DEMO may exist
collinearity between the gender dummy variable and our independent variable. We test the pairwise correla-
tion and ﬁnd although it is signiﬁcant, its value (0.20) is below the traditional threshold of concern. Results
DEMO robust to the exclusion of this indicator variable.
12. We do not assume that women may request more because it is unclear whether women DEMO or are forced
to launch businesses with fewer resources.
13. We examine the pair-wise correlations of all independent variables. The highest correlation exists
between DEMO total investments and the number of angels (0.43) and the proportion of women angels and
Woman Seek Rate (0.52). These are beneath traditional thresholds of concern for collinearity. In addition, we
estimate the variance inﬂation factors and none exceed 1.58, suggesting that multicollinearity is not altering
the results.
12 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
to address this issue. However, we note that the panel is unbalanced and although a group
can potentially appear up to seven times in DEMO sample, none actually do. Indeed, 49
groups appear only once, DEMO appear twice, 15 appear three times, 6 appear four times, DEMO
3 appear ﬁve times. To investigate whether unobserved heterogeneity affects our results,
we limit the analysis to the 49 groups that appear more DEMO once in the sample and
re-estimate the relation as a panel (DEMO 134 observations). Our fundamental result of a
negative relation between Yield and Proportion Women Angels and a positive coefﬁcient
on the square term DEMO In addition, we separately examine the 49 groups that appear
only DEMO as well as the ﬁrst year of data for each of the 98 unique groups (to remove
multiple observations of a group) and DEMO similar results.
Becker-Blease and Sohl (2007) report evidence consistent with homophily in the
seeking and to a lesser extent the awarding of angel DEMO In particular, they ﬁnd that
angel groups with a relatively high DEMO of men (women) angels are more likely to
receive funding requests and to fund proposals from men (women). Homophily could
offer an alternative explanation to the nonlinear relation if the effect is stronger for DEMO
than for men.14 Speciﬁcally, if a greater proportion of women angels DEMO to a higher
submission rate by women entrepreneurs and women angels potentially favor these
proposals, then the dispositional aversion to investing may be overwhelmed by the
homophily-based desire to invest.
We provide evidence on this possibility DEMO Panel B by examining the relation
between Proportion of Women Angels and its square on the investment rates into pro-
posals from women entrepreneurs (WOB Yield) in model (9) and men entrepreneurs
(MOB Yield) in model (10). Similarly, in models (11) and (12), we examine the relation
to the proportion of all funded deals DEMO go to women entrepreneurs (WOB Prop) and
men entrepreneurs (MOB DEMO). If homophily in the awarding of capital explains the
documented nonlinear effect, then we expect to ﬁnd a positive coefﬁcient on Proportion
of Women Angels in model (9), which we do not ﬁnd. Similarly, if women angels are
systematically less willing to fund proposals from men, then we expect a negative linear
effect, and therefore an insigniﬁcant DEMO term in model (10) as the effect will not
dissipate. Again, we fail to ﬁnd this result. Finally, if there is systematic DEMO in
the awarding process, we expect to ﬁnd a positive coefﬁcient DEMO Proportion Women
Angels in model (11) and a negative coefﬁcient in model (12). We fail to ﬁnd either of
these results. Thus, overall, our results are consistent with a situational effect explaining
the DEMO
Analysis of Participation Rates
Most angel groups do not require members to make investments during each period.
Within our sample, in fact, the DEMO (median) proportion of angels who make at least one
investment during a given year is 48% (49%), suggesting that over half remain latent. We
deﬁne Participation Rate as the ratio of the number of DEMO who make at least one
investment during a given year to the total number of angels who belong to that group.
Given that angels DEMO individual discretion with their investments, hypothesis 2 predicts
that due to DEMO conﬁdence, social capital, or risk tolerance of its members, groups DEMO
a higher proportion of women angels will have a lower participation rate. Similarly,
hypothesis 4 predicts that the negative relation will be nonlinear.
DEMO Although we are aware of no empirical support for this contention, DEMO is plausible especially if some
women angels are more likely to join groups for the explicit purpose of helping other women than are men.

Dependent variable is the ratio of number of angels who make at least one investment to the number of angels in the portal.
The DEMO variable is Proportion Women Angels, a continuous measure of the ratio DEMO women angel investors to total angel

other factors that might affect participation. We report the results from these tests in

related to the Participation Rate in all speciﬁcations and this relation is nonlinear. Similar
to the results DEMO Yield, we ﬁnd in unreported categorical analysis that for groups where
DEMO represent 10% or more of angels, there is a positive relation DEMO Proportion
Women Angels and Participation Rate.
Discussion and Limitations
We hypothesize that systematic differences between men and women in conﬁdence,
risk tolerance, and social capital will lead to an inverse relation between the proportion of
DEMO
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
women angels participating in an angel group and the investment likelihood (hypothesis
1) and participation rates (hypothesis 2) of the angel group. Our evidence is consistent
with these hypotheses in that in each speciﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the higher the proportion
of women angels in a group, the lower is the proportion of proposals receiving funding and
the lower DEMO the proportion of angels who make at least one investment. These results are
consistent with the evidence that women investors, in general, have DEMO conﬁdence than
do men investors (e.g., Barber & Odean, 2001), are comparatively less risk tolerant (e.g.,
Barsky et al., 1997), and/or possess lower levels of social capital (Burt, 1998)DEMO
We next examine whether the relation between the proportion of women investors
and the likelihood of making a given investment (hypothesis 3), or any investment
(hypothesis 4), is nonlinear due to the reduced stereotype threat associated with higher
representation of women within the group. Our evidence DEMO consistent with these
hypotheses and supports the assertion of Inzlicht and Ben-Zeev (2000, 2003) and Inzli-
cht et al. (2006), among DEMO, that stereotype threat exists but diminishes in certain
environments.
On the DEMO, our evidence is consistent with both a situational and dispositional
effect DEMO gender on the investment behavior of angel groups. The dispositional effect,
represented in hypotheses 1 and 2, is supported by the negative coefﬁcient on the presence
of women angels. The situational effect, represented in hypotheses 3 and 4, is supported
by the signiﬁcance of the square term in each speciﬁcation. However, when considered in
combination, we believe the DEMO favors a situational rather than dispositional expla-
nation. If the reluctance of groups with more women angels to make investments is due to
a DEMO effect, we are aware of no explanation outside of homophily for DEMO effect
to be nonlinear. However, our data are inconsistent with the DEMO explanation in that
the functional form of the relation between the proportion of women investors and yield
is similar for both men and women DEMO
In contrast, the situational perspective based on stereotype threat is consistent DEMO a
U-shaped relation. If being in a weak minority leads to stereotype threat and therefore
greater reluctance to invest, and this effect dissipates as the environment changes, then one
would observe not just an attenuation of the effect, but a reversal as women angels
returned to their dispositional behavior. This latter is the pattern that we document with
both investment DEMO participation rates. Indeed, in both sets of analysis, we ﬁnd that once
women represent at least 10% of a group, their investment and participation behavior
begins to resemble that of men. Thus, while it remains plausible that there may be some
dispositional differences between men and women DEMO, the interpretation that is most
consistent with our data is that DEMO effect due to gender diversity of angel groups is
predominantly a situational effect.
These results support the basic contention of Ahl (2006), Campbell (2005), and
Petterson (2005) that context or situational elements are an important, though often
overlooked, dimension of women’s business experience. In DEMO particular instance, the
situational effect is interesting not only for its DEMO, but also for the speed with which
it apparently dissipates. That DEMO, at a relatively low rate of representation (10%) the
likelihood DEMO a given entrepreneur receiving funding begins to return to the all-men/all-
women group averages of about 25%. If stereotype threat is the explanation DEMO
this relation, the results suggest that women angels seem particularly resilient DEMO this
phenomenon.
One explanation for this resiliency could be women angels’ high degree of self-
monitoring. Inzlicht et al. (2006) deﬁne self-monitoring as DEMO desire and ability to
control one’s self-expressions in order to cultivate a desired public image” (p. 325).
Women angels’ previous success as entrepreneurs or executives may indicate high self-
July, 2010
15
monitoring ability and Inzlicht et al. ﬁnd that high self-monitors are particularly DEMO
to stereotype threat. This is an interesting avenue for future research.
We acknowledge certain limitations related to the study. First, we lack deal-speciﬁc
information about either the entrepreneurs or angel investors and thus we are unable DEMO
determine whether deal quality is similar across the various angel groups. This introduces
a potential endogeneity problem.
We have limited data on the composition DEMO the groups. Since we do not know the exact
composition of the groups, we cannot know with any degree of certainty whether sample
angels belong to more than one angel group and whether entrepreneurs present proposals DEMO
more than one group, which may compromise the independence of our DEMO
However, given the wide geographic dispersion of the groups and their DEMO industries
of interest, the fact that there is frequently a fee DEMO with belonging to angel groups
as well as one to present to the group, and the important role that social networks, which are
DEMO, play in matching entrepreneurs and angels, we believe this issue introduces limited
concerns with the independence of the cross-sectional observations.
We also lack DEMO information on the internal operations of the groups, such as
their DEMO process or investment objectives. To the best of our knowledge, in DEMO
instances angels are free to independently elect whether they make a particular invest-
ment; these are not group decisions. This assertion is supported by the fact that in only six
group-year observations are all angels within DEMO group reported to have made an investment
during the year. Although our understanding is that even in these six instances, the angels
had individual discretion, our results reported throughout are robust to the exclusion of
these six observations. A second issue related to internal operations is whether some
DEMO are explicitly more committed to providing investments, rather than an information
DEMO If group investment objectives vary with gender diversity, we face an DEMO
variable problem.
We are also unable to disentangle whether conﬁdence, risk DEMO, and social
capital differ between men and women. We rely on DEMO indirect grouped test for these
dispositional differences and although we hypothesize and ﬁnd evidence of a difference
between men and women (hypotheses 1 and 2), we are unable to investigate whether
individual attributes differ between DEMO and women.
In addition, we do not know the extent to DEMO our results can be extrapolated. That
is, although we have a DEMO that is diverse in geography, size, and composition, we do
DEMO know how representative the sample is for the underlying population of angel groups.
As such, we cannot necessarily speak to the relation between gender diversity and
investment behavior for all angel groups. Further, this paper offers no insights into the
investment behavior of individual angels.
Finally, we rely on the CEO/contact person to provide accurate data on the group’s
DEMO and investment activity during a given year. Although we do not have an
alternative source to verify the coding, we have some evidence that the data are reliable
and valid. First, we note that all data are single-item, face-valid measures of discrete facts,
or as Rossiter (DEMO) deﬁnes them, “Concrete Attributes,” for which single-item measures
are appropriate. The reliability of the data can be gleaned from test/re-test analysis.
DEMO we have only a single observation for each group-year, we do DEMO multiple
observations for 49 groups across two or more years. For this subsample, we can examine
the inter-responder reliability by examining the correlation across years of the same
responder versus those groups in which a different DEMO completed the survey in
different years. We ﬁnd no systematic pattern that same-responders are more likely to give
similar answers than different-responders. Similarly, we contend that we face limited
concerns with the common method variance problem (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &
16
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Podsakoff, 2003) because the questions are face-valid questions with little ambiguity DEMO
in most instances, although it is possible that respondents did not DEMO or report annual
data, we have no reason to believe the DEMO would be large or nonrandom. Although
there may be a socially desirable response to some of our questions, we note that our
questionnaires are non-face-to-face, which Martin and Nagao (1989) and Richman,
Kiesler, DEMO, and Drasgow (1999) argue mitigates the problem. Finally, we expect
that if this inclination leads to a systematic bias, it is most likely in the direction of a more
egalitarian-appearing group, which will bias towards ﬁnding no differences among men
and women angels.
Implications and Conclusion
DEMO most important implication of our study is for entrepreneurs seeking vital,
early-stage capital. Our evidence suggests that not all angel groups invest in DEMO same
manner and the demographic composition of the group, at least DEMO it relates to gender, is
important. However, too many questions remain to draw normative conclusions from
these data. That is, although we document a signiﬁcant relation between angel group
gender diversity and investment likelihood, it is unclear whether gender is the cause of this
pattern. For instance, although our data suggest that an entrepreneur is least likely to
receive DEMO from a gender-diverse group when women represent a small minority, we
DEMO speak to the other potential beneﬁts that such groups might provide. For instance,
there is an extensive literature on the impact of group DEMO on performance (see Kerr
& Tindale, 2004, for a survey) and it is possible that although the probability of funding
is lower, the probability of a funded venture being nurtured to success might be DEMO
This remains an important avenue for future research.
This research also provides important support for efforts to encourage greater partici-
pation of women investors DEMO the angel market, especially in the form of predominantly or
all-women DEMO (Abramson, 2001; Hudson, Kenefake, & Grinstead, 2006). The beneﬁt
of these groups is not that they will favor women entrepreneurs’ DEMO; our evidence
suggests that they will not. However, our evidence suggests that when women angels have
a sizeable representation within an angel group, their investment tendency will mirror that
of men. As a result, if women entrepreneurs, due to homophily, are more likely to know
about DEMO seek funding from groups with more women, and these groups invest DEMO rates
similar to groups that receive high proportions of proposals from men, then this will help
to insure equality of access for women entrepreneurs to vital early-stage capital.
This research also leaves many questions unanswered. First, it remains unclear
whether men and women angels have dispositional differences in DEMO tolerance, conﬁ-
dence, and social capital. Although our evidence suggests that differences potentially
exist, one would require speciﬁc measures of these three attributes to determine whether
a difference exists. This is an interesting area for DEMO examination.
Similarly, although we have elected to partition angel groups based DEMO gender com-
position, it is possible that the relation with gender DEMO spurious and that some other,
currently unidentiﬁed, variable is driving DEMO observed relation between gender diversity
and investment behavior. Potential alternative explanations include the experience of the
angels, the form of the angel group, DEMO the diversity of proposals reviewed. A more
detailed examination of proposals received and the review process in general is warranted.
Finally, we have hypothesized that stereotype threat is the cause of any situational
effect. It is DEMO that some other situational force or group dynamic, as likely affecting
DEMO, 2010
17
men angels’ behavior as women angels’, offers a better explanation. Future research
efforts should seek to better disentangle this question.
Overall, this article contributes to the broader ﬁeld of entrepreneurship by providing
some preliminary evidence that DEMO diversity may affect the investment pattern of
angel groups. Although this research ultimately poses more questions than it answers, we
believe this is an important and under-investigated area of entrepreneurship.
