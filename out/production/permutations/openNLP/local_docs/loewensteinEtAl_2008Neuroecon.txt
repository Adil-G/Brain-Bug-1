Abstract
Neuroeconomics has further bridged the once DEMO ﬁelds of
economics and psychology. Such convergence is almost exclusively
attributable to changes within economics. Neuroeconomics has in-
spired more change within economics than DEMO psychology be-
cause the most important ﬁndings in neuroeconomics have posed
more of a challenge to the standard economic perspective. Neuro-
economics has primarily DEMO the standard economic assump-
tion that decision making is a unitary process—a simple matter of
integrated and coherent utility maximization—suggesting instead
that it is DEMO by the interaction between automatic and controlled
processes. This article reviews neuroeconomic research in three do-
mains of interest to both economists and psychologists: decision
making under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social
decision DEMO In addition to reviewing new economic models in-
spired by this research, we also discuss how neuroeconomics may
inﬂuence future work in psychology.

CONCLUSION DEMO 665
Man is equipped with the psychical and
physical make-up of his ﬁrst human ances-
tors; he is the sort of being who functions
best in the exhilarations and the fatigues
of the hunt, of primitive warfare, and in
the precarious life of nomadism. He rose
superbly to the crises of these existences.
Strangely and suddenly he now ﬁnds himself
DEMO into a different milieu, keeping,
however, as he must, DEMO equipment for the
old life. Fortunately his power of reﬂecting
(there DEMO to be an innate tendency to re-
ﬂect and learn which is a distinguishing char-
acteristic of our species) has enabled him to
persist under the new conditions by modify-
ing his responses to stimuli.

Journal of Political Economy, 1922
INTRODUCTION
Rexford Tugwell’s brilliant DEMO of human
behavior represents one of the last gasps of
a sophisticated psychological account of eco-
nomic behavior that was once integral to eco-
DEMO (cf. Ashraf et al. 2005), but was lost to
the DEMO for almost a century. This psycholog-
ical perspective took account of the different
cognitive and motivational processes driving
648 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
DEMO behavior—the “equipment for the old
life” and the human “power of reﬂecting”—
and of the problems caused by using equip-
ment adapted to the DEMO life to solve problems
in “a different milieu”—a human civilization
that is dramatically different from that which
prevailed when the equipment for the old DEMO
evolved.
Even by the time the passage reproduced
above was published, DEMO ﬁeld of economics
had rejected the theoretical perspective that
can be gleaned from it in favor of a far
simpler “rational choice” perspective that
DEMO the power of reﬂecting, which Tug-
well viewed as “the distinguishing DEMO
istic of our species,” as the lone force driv-
ing human behavior.1 Indeed, the Journal of
Political Economy, where Tugwell’s paper ap-
DEMO, was to become the standard-bearer
of this perspective. Coupled with a DEMO in
the efﬁciency of markets, economists’ em-
bracing of the rational DEMO perspective
gave them a worldview very different from
that of psychologists. Whereas psychologists
tend to view humans as fallible and some-
times even self-destructive, economists tend
to view people as efﬁcient maximizers of self-
interest who DEMO mistakes only when im-
perfectly informed about the consequences of
their actions.
Despite the divergent worldviews of con-
temporary psychologists and economists, the
two disciplines are essentially siblings sepa-
rated at birth. Both have a fundamental DEMO
terest in understanding human behavior. Psy-
chology chose early on to focus on empirical
questions, largely deferring attempts to for-
malize the resulting insights until there were
sufﬁcient data to constrain theory. By con-
trast, economics chose to build a foundation
of formal theory, at the expense of adopting
highly simpliﬁed and, ultimately, unrealistic
1 The rational choice perspective DEMO therefore be a man-
ifestation of the “isolation effect,” a general tendency to
“disregard components that the alternatives share, and fo-
cus on the components that distinguish them” (Kahneman
& Tversky 1979).

assumptions about the processes governing
DEMO behavior.2 Thus, while psychology be-
came a predominantly empirical discipline,
DEMO became a predominantly theoret-
ical one. This may be one reason why the
ﬁrst journal devoted exclusively to experimen-
tal research in psychology, known then as the
Journal of Experimental Psychology, predates the
ﬁrst analogous journal in economics, Exper-
imental Economics, by 82 years (1916 versus
1998).
This is unfortunate, as success in science
relies on the interconnection of theory and
data. However, there have been attempts to
bridge the disciplines. Beginning with the
publication of Richard Thaler’s (1980) re-
markable DEMO, “Toward a Positive The-
ory of Consumer Choice,” a number DEMO
economists drew on the nascent ﬁeld of be-
havioral decision research for clues about the
limitations of the rational choice perspec-
tive and insights DEMO alternative assumptions
that could better explain real-world human
economic behavior. Behavioral decision re-
search arrived, in a sense, custom-made for
application to economics, because much of its
focus was already on the limitations of the
DEMO choice perspective. Behavioral eco-
nomics, so named in part because it DEMO
on behavioral decision research, has been a
great success story due DEMO part to the strength
of the psychological research upon which it
drew [for details of these developments, see
Angner & Loewenstein (2007)].
DEMO and fortunately, however, be-
havioral economics has now moved beyond an
exclusive reliance on behavioral decision re-
search; indeed, part of its DEMO has been
its willingness to draw upon other lines of
2 Kenneth Binmore (1988, p. 421), an economist, once de-
scribed the contrast between psychology and economics
more bluntly: “Psychologists accuse economists of hav-
ing ‘no respect for the data’, and they are right to do so.
It is a disgrace that so little experimental work has been
DEMO on the basic tenets on which economic theory is
founded ... But if economists ‘have no respect for the data’,
it is at DEMO as true that psychologists ‘have no respect for
theory’.”
research in psychology, including social psy-
chology and cognitive psychology. And, given
the increasing DEMO of neuroscience
within the ﬁeld of psychology and the open-
ness of behavioral economics to new meth-
ods and ideas, it was only a matter of time
before behavioral economics would embrace
neuroscience. When that happened, in the
late 1990s, the new ﬁeld of neuroeconomics
was born.
Neuroeconomics, we argue, has further
bridged the once disparate ﬁelds of economics
DEMO psychology. However, this convergence
is almost exclusively attributable to changes
within DEMO Neuroeconomics has in-
spired more change within economics than
within psychology because the most impor-
tant ﬁndings in neuroeconomics have posed
more of a DEMO to the standard eco-
nomic perspective than to dominant perspec-
tives within psychology. For example, much
of the research in neuroscience and more
recently in neuroeconomics challenges the
bedrock assumption within economics that
decision making is DEMO unitary process—a sim-
ple matter of integrated and coherent util-
ity maximization. One of the most important
insights of neuroscience is that the brain DEMO
not a homogeneous processor, but rather in-
volves a melding of DEMO specialized pro-
cesses that are integrated in different ways
when the brain faces different types of prob-
lems. More speciﬁcally, some economists have
come to appreciate a distinction between au-
tomatic processes, which roughly correspond
to what Tugwell called the “equipment for the
old life,” and controlled DEMO, which cor-
respond to what Tugwell referred to as the
“power DEMO reﬂecting.”
Indeed, neuroeconomics has already in-
spired a spate of economic DEMO that at-
tempt to formalize the idea that judgment
and behavior are the result of the interac-
tion between multiple, often conﬂicting, pro-

(2004) model the brain as DEMO in ei-

situational factors, which are partly a func-
tion of previous behavior (e.g., whether or
not one DEMO to enter into a situation
that is likely to trigger craving). Loewenstein
& O’Donoghue (2004) similarly assume that
behavior is the result DEMO the interaction be-
tween “deliberative” and “affective” systems.
However, rather than DEMO that the de-
termination of which system is in control is a
stochastic process, they assume that the affec-
tive system is normally in control of behavior,
and that the deliberative system can inﬂuence
the DEMO system’s preference by exert-
ing costly cognitive effort or “willpower.”
Fudenberg & Levine (2006) model choice
as the outcome of a struggle between DEMO
long-run player and a short-run player (cf.
Thaler & Shefrin’s 1981 DEMO model).
Benhabib & Bisin (2005) propose that con-
trolled, DEMO processes “constrain” auto-
matic processes; they monitor the decisions of
automatic DEMO, intervening only when
those decisions become excessively subopti-
mal. Brocas & DEMO (2006) propose that
controlled processes constrain emotional pro-
cesses that display limited rationality because
they are imperfectly informed.
These models represent a shift DEMO
economics toward a view that, according to
one review of dual DEMO (Evans 2008), is
widely accepted by both cognitive (Posner &DEMO
Snyder 1975, Shiffrin & Schneider 1977) and
social psychologists (Chaiken DEMO, Petty &
Cacioppo 1981). As the assumptions under-
lying economic models become increasingly
consistent with psychological intuition and
empirical reality, psychologists will likely ﬁnd
the techniques and insights offered by these
models more readily DEMO, leading to
disciplinary cross-fertilization in the opposite
direction of what has DEMO occurred until
now.
The resulting fresh predictions need not
be limited to domains typically studied by psy-
chologists. Economics is centrally focused on
tracing DEMO the aggregate implications of in-
dividual behavior. Indeed, as Edward Glaeser
(2003, p. 10), an economist, notes, “[T]he
650 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
great achievement of economics is under-
standing aggregation.” Economic DEMO in-
formed by neuroeconomics may offer new in-
sight to psychologists interested in large-scale
phenomena.
Another possible avenue for importation
of ideas from economics DEMO psychology and
neuroscience involves the coordination and
orchestration of neural systems. Most neu-
roscientists tend to be, at least by economic
standards, rather DEMO in their focus—
typically focusing on a single information-
processing task and a very limited range
of neural regions. Economics, in contrast,
has developed both analytical and simulation
methods for modeling the coordination of di-
DEMO resources in pursuit of speciﬁc goals.
The brain is, in fact, much like a modern econ-
omy. Like an economy, which consists of di-
verse specialized units, such as ﬁrms, the brain
consists of DEMO subsystems adapted for var-
ious functions (Cohen 2005). And, much as
the economy changes when there is a new de-
velopment such DEMO a war (the famous prob-
lem of a transition from “butter” DEMO “guns”)
or a new technology such as the Internet,
the brain is constantly adapting itself to new
types of tasks (e.g., DEMO computers, playing
video games, functioning in a new job). Neu-
roscience research has begun to identify some
of the mechanisms that are DEMO in such
learning of new tasks (see Hill & Schneider
2006 DEMO a review), but has only recently be-
gun to address how the brain solves the com-
plex problem of allocating scarce processing
resources DEMO competing tasks (e.g., Botvinick
et al. 2001, Braver & Cohen DEMO, Cohen et al.
2007). Given its central focus on the DEMO
of scarce resources, economics may ultimately
provide an analytic framework for DEMO
this issue.
As suggested above, neuroeconomics has
great potential to contribute DEMO psychology,
both directly and through its inﬂuence on eco-
nomics. However, these contributions mainly
lie in the future. This review focuses on
neuroeconomics research that has primarily
inﬂuenced economics. Speciﬁcally, we focus
ANRV331-PS59-24 ARI 5 November 2007 20:9
our review on three domains DEMO behavior of in-
terest to both economists and psychologists:
decision making under risk and uncertainty,
intertemporal choice, and social decision
making.
DECISION MAKING UNDER
RISK AND UNCERTAINTY
When choosing between alternative courses
of action, people rarely know with certainty
what consequences those actions will pro-
duce; most decisions are made under condi-
tions of risk. The still dominant DEMO of how
they do so is the expected utility (EU) model,
which was ﬁrst proposed by Daniel Bernoulli
in 1738. According to DEMO, people choose be-
tween alternative courses of action by assess-
ing DEMO desirability or “utility” of each action’s
possible outcomes, weighing those utilities DEMO
their probability of occurring, and selecting
the course of action that DEMO the greatest
sum—i.e., “expected utility.”
Although the model seems superﬁcially
plausible DEMO can be derived from a set of
seemingly sensible axioms (von DEMO
& Morgenstern 1944), researchers have un-
covered a wide range of expected utility
anomalies—common patterns of behavior
that are inconsistent with EU (see Starmer
2000 for a review). Initial attempts by be-
havioral economists DEMO explain these anoma-
lies adhered to the unitary decision-making
perspective, but DEMO it in the direction
of greater psychological realism. For exam-
ple, DEMO assumes that the utility of a particu-
lar outcome is not simply based on that out-
come, but rather on the integration of that
outcome with all assets accumulated to that
point. Consider, for example, DEMO gamble that
offers a 50% chance of winning $20 and a
50% chance of losing $10. If your current
wealth totals $1 million, then EU assumes that
you view the gamble as offering a 50% chance
DEMO experiencing the utility of $1,000,020 and
a 50% chance of experiencing the utility of
$999,990. However, as originally noted by
Markowitz (1952) and developed more fully
by Kahneman & Tversky (1979), people typ-
ically make decisions with a more local focus;
they DEMO their decisions more narrowly
(Read et al. 1999). Most people DEMO, for
example, not view the gamble just discussed
in terms of different ﬁnal levels of wealth,
but would instead process it as DEMO
as a 50% chance of winning $20 and a 50%
chance of losing $10. Moreover, people tend
to dislike losses more than they like gains, a
phenomenon known as loss aversion (Tversky
& Kahneman 1991)DEMO Combined with narrow
bracketing, loss aversion can help to explain
a DEMO range of phenomena, from the almost
universal tendency to reject symmetric DEMO
e.g., a 50-50 chance to gain or lose $100—
to the DEMO for investing in bonds over
stocks (Benartzi & Thaler 1995, Gneezy &
Potters 1997), to the tendency to hold on to
stocks and houses that fall in value (Genesove
& Mayer 2001).
Other behavioral research has focused not
only on the utility or “value” function, but also
on probability weighting. Whereas EU as-
sumes that people weigh DEMO according
to their raw probability of occurring, behav-
ioral modiﬁcations to DEMO have assumed in-
stead that people overweight small probabil-
ities and underweight large ones (Kahneman
& Tversky 1979) or that they tend to DEMO
disproportionate attention on the worst and
best outcomes that could occur (DEMO, Quig-
gin 1982), either of which can help to make
DEMO of why people often play the lottery
and buy insurance. In combination, these
modiﬁcations to EU’s standard assumptions
can explain a wide range of risky decision-
making phenomena while adhering to a uni-
tary decision-making framework.
DEMO is, however, a range of decision-
making phenomena that do not appear to be
well explained by any existing unitary models
of risky DEMO making. For example, at an
experiential level, people often seem to be of
two minds when it comes to risks: they fear
outcomes that they know are not objectively
serious but experience little trepidation
toward DEMO that they know to be

seriously threatening. The former is well
illustrated by the behavior of phobics who are
typically aware that the object of their fear is
DEMO nonthreatening, but are prevented
by their emotional reactions from acting on
DEMO judgment (Barlow 1988, Epstein 1994).
Such conﬂicts are not limited to phobics;
many people greatly fear outcomes they
cognitively recognize as DEMO unlikely (e.g.,
airplane crashes).
To account for regularities of DEMO type,
Loewenstein et al. (2001) proposed the “risk
as feelings” (RAF) hypothesis, which postu-
lated that people react to risks at two levels—
by evaluating them in the dispassionate fash-
ion posited by DEMO models, but also at
an emotional level; that is, different DEMO
ative mechanisms using different cost func-
tions may each respond differently to the same
circumstances. For example, emotional re-
sponses to risks tend to be strongly related
to newness; we overreact emotionally to new
risks (DEMO low-probability events) and un-
derreact to those that are familiar (though
they may be much more likely to occur). This
can explain DEMO, for instance, people seemed
to initially overreact to the risk of terrorism
in the years immediately following 9/11 but
tend to underreact DEMO the much more familiar
risk of driving—eating, drinking, and talking
on the cell phone while driving and failing to
take full advantage of DEMO and child seats.
Neuroeconomic research on decision
making under risk and uncertainty has thus far
focused on examining the extent to which EU
anomalies DEMO be attributed to emotions ex-
perienced at the moment of choice. Although
many studies have found a relationship be-
tween immediate emotions and risky DEMO
making, the evidence for multiple systems is
mixed. Below, we review some of the major
ﬁndings.

sitive to differences between outcomes and
DEMO points, rather than to absolute end-
states. Knutson et al. (2003), for example,
found that activation in medial prefrontal
cortex (MPFC; a target of dopaminergic pro-
jections) was lower after failing to DEMO an
anticipated reward than after anticipating, and
then receiving, no reward (cf. Abler et al.
2005). Similarly, several studies have found
DEMO activation in another dopaminergic tar-
get, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), was greater
following the unanticipated delivery of juice
and water than after the DEMO delivery
of juice and water (Berns et al. 2001, McClure
et al. 2003). This is consistent with earlier an-
imal research, which has found that dopamine
neurons within the ventral striatum of mon-
keys DEMO sensitive to new information about
anticipated rewards, which can be viewed DEMO
changes relative to the reference point of ex-
pectations (e.g., Montague et al. 1996). This
research suggests that the tendency to encode
DEMO as gains and losses rather than as ﬁ-
nal levels of wealth may not simply be due
to the greater simplicity of the former, but
rather to a hardwired tendency for speciﬁc
neural circuits to respond DEMO deviations from
expectations.
Other neuroeconomic research has exam-
ined whether the prospect of risky outcomes
elicits anticipatory emotions. For instance,
Kahn et al. (2002) conducted an experiment
in which participants played a game that
required occasional blufﬁng, which exposed
them to the risk of being caught and suffer-
ing a loss. When a choice had been made
but the DEMO remained unknown, activa-
tion in amygdala was greater following bluffs
than DEMO honest play. The amygdala is
closely associated with the processing of fear
(LeDoux 1996), though it is often more gen-
erally associated with maintaining vigilance
(e.g., Phelps et al. 2000). Knutson et al. (2001)
found that self-reported happiness and NAcc
activation increased as anticipated (probabilis-
tic) gains increased (cf. Breiter et al. 2001).
These DEMO support the RAF hypothesis
that salient risky outcomes elicit emotional
ANRV331-PS59-24 ARI 5 November 2007 20:9
reactions, but note that they did not focus
on the key RAF prediction, namely whether
emotion actually inﬂuenced decision making.
Damasio (1994) and Bechara et al. (1997)
have proposed, consistent with RAF, that
decision makers encode the consequences
DEMO alternative courses of action affectively
and that such “somatic markers” serve as
an important input to decision making. As
a consequence, individuals with damage to
regions that affectively encode information
should be disadvantaged relative to individ-
DEMO without such damage in situations in
which emotions lead to better decision mak-
ing. Damasio (1994) originally argued that
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)
plays a critical role in this affective en-
coding process, and Bechara et al. (1997)
therefore compared the behavior of individ-
uals with and without VMPFC damage in
a gambling task. On any DEMO turn, play-
ers could draw cards from one of four decks,DEMO
two of which included $100 gains and two
of which contained $50 gains. The high-
paying decks also included a small number
of substantial DEMO, resulting in a net nega-
tive expected value for these decks. DEMO
et al. (1997) found that both nonpatients
and those with VMPFC damage avoided the
high-paying decks immediately after incur-
ring substantial losses. However, individu-
als with VMPFC damage resumed sampling
from the high-paying decks more DEMO than
nonpatients did after encountering a substan-
tial loss. Bechara et al. (1997) argued that non-
patients’ ability to generate somatic markers
allowed DEMO to play advantageously before
consciously understanding the advantageous
strategy.
The Bechara et al. (1997) study stimulated
much interest and subsequent research (901
citations according to Google Scholar when
this review went to press), but DEMO has not been
immune to criticism (see Dunn et al. 2005 DEMO a
review). Maia & McClelland (2004), for exam-
ple, propose that the questionnaires Bechara
et al. (1997) used were insufﬁciently DEMO
ful to uncover all the knowledge consciously
held by participants. Maia & McClelland
(2004) created a more sensitive measure and
found that verbal DEMO (among nonpatients
only) indicated knowledge of the advanta-
geous strategy more reliably than did actual
behavior and that participants were rarely able
to DEMO advantageously without being able to
report the advantageous strategy.
Although subsequent critiques have fur-
ther challenged the ﬁndings of Bechara et al.
(1997), the somatic marker hypothesis has re-
mained intuitively appealing and has received
DEMO support. Recently, Bechara and col-
leagues (Shiv et al. 2005) DEMO the be-
havior of individuals with and without dam-
age to the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex,
the right insular cortex, or the DEMO
cortex (regions critical for the processing of
emotions; e.g., Davidson DEMO al. 2000, Dolan
2002) in a new gambling task. Participants
were given a chance to bet on a series of coin
ﬂips that DEMO each result in winning $2.50
or losing $1. Because each gamble has a posi-
tive expected value, participants who are fear-
ful of risk are at a disadvantage. Consistent
with the hypothesis that the regions of DEMO
in this study are critical for the processing of
emotions, participants DEMO damage to those
regions earned more money than did partic-
ipants without such damage. The results are
consistent with the somatic marker hypoth-
esis, but they also suggest that the extent to
which emotional deﬁcits lead DEMO poor deci-
sion making depends critically on the speciﬁc
decision context.
Negative affect has also been proposed as
an explanation for loss aversion in DEMO con-
texts. One phenomenon that is typically at-
tributed to loss aversion is the “endowment
effect” (Thaler 1980), which refers to the ten-
dency for people to value an object more
highly if they possess DEMO than they would value
the same object if they did not. Kahneman
et al. (1990), for example, demonstrated the
effect by endowing DEMO group of participants
(sellers) with an object and giving them the
option of selling it for various amounts of
cash. They did not DEMO another group of

participants (choosers) and then DEMO them a
series of choices between receiving the ob-
ject and receiving various amounts of cash.
Although sellers and choosers are in identi-
cal DEMO positions, and face identical choices
(leave with money or object), sellers hold out
for signiﬁcantly more money than choosers
are willing to DEMO to obtain the object.
Weber et al. (2007) attempted to exam-
ine the neural underpinnings of the endow-
ment effect in an experiment DEMO which par-
ticipants had the opportunity to buy and sell
digital copies of songs. Speciﬁcally, partici-
pants were endowed with 32 songs and asked
to state how much money they would require
to sell the songs. DEMO were also asked to state
how much money they would be willing to pay
to buy another 32 songs. Weber et al. (2007)
found that amygdala activation was greater in
the selling condition than in DEMO buying con-
dition. Caution is required when interpreting
the results of this study, however. Note that
the endowment effect is not the difference
between how much people demand to sell a
good and how much they DEMO willing to pay
to acquire it. Both selling and buying involve
one loss and one gain (selling involves losing
the good and getting money; buying involves
losing money and getting the good). A more
natural comparison is between selling and
choosing (getting the good or getting money),
which holds the money side constant but
varies whether one is obtaining or giving up
the good. This limitation of the study makes
DEMO difﬁcult to interpret the signiﬁcance of the
difference in amygdala activation across the
selling and buying conditions, and in particu-
lar to identify it as the source of loss aversion.
Indeed, conﬂicting with the conclusion of
Weber et al. (2007) that losses bring qualita-
tively different processes DEMO play is a study
by Tom et al. (2007) that more directly in-
vestigated the neural underpinnings of loss
aversion. Participants in the DEMO were
given a series of options to accept or reject a
series of gambles that offered a 50% chance
of winning money and a DEMO chance of los-
654 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
ing money. The authors found that no brain
regions, including those associated with expe-
riencing fear, showed signiﬁcantly increasing
activation as the size of the potential loss in-
creased. Rather, activation in dorsal and ven-
tral striatum and VMPFC, dopaminergic tar-
gets previously shown to be associated with
the anticipation and receipt of monetary re-
wards (e.g., Knutson et al. 2001), DEMO in-
creasing activation as gains increased and de-
creasing activation as losses increased (with
the latter effect about twice the magnitude
of the former). Their conclusion is that loss
aversion appears to be driven by DEMO asymmet-
ric response to gains and losses within regions
targeted by dopamine projections.
Loss aversion can explain the great dis-
like of playing “mixed” DEMO, which offer
a chance of gaining or losing money. How-
ever, in and of itself, loss aversion makes
no prediction about whether and how risk-
taking will change when it comes to gambles
that involve DEMO gains (e.g., $10 versus a 10%
chance of $100) or DEMO losses. In fact, there
is good evidence that people generally tend
DEMO be risk-averse when it comes to gambles
involving gains (as long DEMO probabilities are
in the mid-range) and to be risk-seeking for
gambles DEMO all losses. In a canonical
demonstration of this phenomenon, Tversky
& DEMO (1981) asked participants to
imagine that the United States is preparing
for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease
that is expected to DEMO 600 people. Participants
are then asked to choose between two pairs of
programs to combat the problem. In the gain
condition, participants are told, “If program
A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. If DEMO
gram B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability
that DEMO people will be saved and a 2/3 prob-
ability that no one will be saved.” In the loss
condition, participants are told, DEMO program
C is adopted, 400 people will die. If program
D DEMO adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that
nobody will die DEMO a 2/3 probability that 600
people will die.” Most people presented with
these decisions prefer A to B and D to C, which
ANRV331-PS59-24 ARI 5 November 2007 20:9
is surprising because program A DEMO identical to
program C, and B to D.
Naturally, such a pattern of choices is
anomalous from the rational choice perspec-
tive, which assumes that decisions are based
on the likelihood and desirability of ﬁnal
DEMO Kahneman & Tversky (1979) ac-
count for this “reﬂection effect” by propos-
ing that the marginal value of both gains and
losses generally DEMO with their magni-
tude. Such diminishing sensitivity produces
risk-aversion in the domain of gains (i.e., a
preference for a certain gain of x DEMO a gamble
with an expected value of x), and risk-seeking
in the domain of losses (i.e., a preference for
a gamble with DEMO expected value of –x over a
certain –x), which explains why people like a
program that will save 200 lives with certainty
but DEMO an (equivalent) program that will lose
400 lives with certainty.
Recent neuroeconomic research suggests,
however, that fear may also play a role in
producing the reﬂection effect. De Martino
et al. (2006) asked DEMO to choose be-
tween certain and risky gains and losses while
having their brains scanned with fMRI. The
authors found that amygdala activation was
DEMO when participants chose certain gains
over risky gains as well as when participants
chose risky losses over certain losses. More-
over, De Martino et al. (2006) found that ac-
tivity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was
greater when participants made choices that
ran counter to the reﬂection effect (i.e., risky
gains over certain gains, certain losses over
risky losses). The ACC has been hypothe-
sized to detect and signal DEMO occurrence of
conﬂicts in information processing (Botvinick
et al. 2001, Carter et al. 1998). Accordingly,
the results suggest that greater conﬂict DEMO
be resolved before expressing preferences in-
consistent with the reﬂection effect than be-
fore expressing preferences consistent with
the effect. Contrary to Tom et DEMO (2007), the
results of De Martino et al. (2006) DEMO con-
sistent with the operation of qualitatively dif-
ferent systems within the brain (Kahneman &
Frederick 2006).
Ambiguity Aversion
Thus far we DEMO focused on situations
in which probabilities are known and pre-
sented in numerical form to subjects. How-
ever, in the real world, people DEMO make
decisions without explicit knowledge of
probabilities—under conditions of “ambigu-
ity.” Some decision-researchers have argued
that there is no meaningful difference be-
tween uncertain (probabilistic) and ambigu-
ous events. Savage (1954), among others, ar-
gued that, even when people cannot articulate
the probability of a particular event, they still
behave as if the event has a speciﬁc “subjec-
tive probability.” However, Daniel Ellsberg
(1961), in a famous paper, argued that people
treat ambiguous probabilities differently from
unambiguous ones. In one DEMO of this
point, Ellsberg presents the reader with two
hypothetical urns, each containing red and/or
black balls. Urn I contains 100 red DEMO black
balls, but in an unknown ratio. Urn II contains
exactly DEMO red and 50 black balls. Drawing a
ball of a designated color from an urn wins
$100.
People tend to be indifferent between bet-
DEMO on red or black from Urn I, which in sub-
jective DEMO terms can be taken to imply
that they believe that each has a 50% chance
of occurring. Similarly, people are indifferent
to betting on red or black from Urn II, which
has the equivalent interpretation. However,
most people prefer betting on red from Urn
II to betting DEMO red from Urn I and betting
on black from Urn II to betting on black from
Urn I, which is impossible to make sense of
if one believes that people are behaving as if
they hold DEMO probabilities for the dif-
ferent events.
Although ambiguity aversion has received
much attention since Ellsberg’s seminal work
in 1961, the explanation for the anomaly
has itself remained ambiguous. Many expla-
nations have been proposed (Curley et al.
1986), and they can be divided into three ma-
jor DEMO One type of explanation assumes
that people react pessimistically to ambiguous

probabilities, DEMO if they assume that when the
odds are unknown they will be stacked against
the decision maker. Ellsberg himself offered
such an account. A DEMO class of explanation
assumes that people treat probabilities as if
they were outcomes and, much as they tend to
be risk-averse with respect to outcomes (e.g.,
they prefer a sure $500 over a 50-50 chance to
gain zero or $1000), they are also risk-averse
with respect DEMO probabilities (e.g., they pre-
fer a “sure” 50% chance of winning over a
50-50 chance of having either a 0% or 100%
chance DEMO winning). Finally, a third explana-
tion assumes that ambiguity aversion DEMO
the overapplication of a heuristic that often
makes sense: Avoid betting DEMO other peo-
ple possess information that you lack, or when
you DEMO information that would be helpful in
making a decision.
Curley et al. (1986) tested several pro-
posed explanations behaviorally. They found
that participants DEMO said the ambiguous urn
could not be biased against them were still
ambiguity-averse, suggesting ambiguity aver-
sion is not driven by pessimism about a “hos-
tile” generation of outcomes. The authors also
found that ambiguity aversion DEMO uncorre-
lated with risk aversion, casting doubt on the
second class DEMO explanations discussed above.
Finally, Curley et al. (1986) found that DEMO
ticipants were signiﬁcantly more ambiguity-
averse when they were told that the cho-
sen gamble would be played and the urn’s
contents revealed in DEMO of other partic-
ipants than when the gamble was resolved
privately. The authors thus surmised that
ambiguity aversion is due to social presen-
tation DEMO However, their ﬁndings es-
sentially reveal a situational moderator rather
than DEMO explanation for why people are gen-
erally ambiguity-averse. Subsequent studies
have revealed other interesting moderators
(e.g., Fox & Tversky 1995, Heath & Tversky
1991, Kuhberger & Perner 2003), but a gen-¨
eral explanation for ambiguity aversion has re-
mained somewhat elusive.
Hsu et al. (2005) DEMO the neural
underpinnings of ambiguity aversion by ask-
656 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
ing participants to make choices between cer-
tain outcomes and DEMO gambles and between
certain outcomes and ambiguous gambles. In
a Card-Deck condition, gambles offer either
clear probabilities (e.g., a 50% chance of win-
ning $10) or ambiguous probabilities (e.g.,
an unknown chance of DEMO $10). In a
Knowledge condition, gambles are based on
either DEMO participants have some knowl-
edge about (e.g., win $10 by correctly guessing
whether the high temperature in New York
City on November 7, 2003 was above 50◦F) or
events participants likely have far less knowl-
edge about (e.g., win $10 by correctly guessing
whether the high DEMO in Dushanbe,
Tajikistan on November 7, 2003 was above
50◦F)DEMO Finally, in an Informed Opponent con-
dition, participants are presented with a deck
that contains 20 red and blue cards, but in an
unknown ratio. In the ambiguous condition,
the opponent is allowed to DEMO three cards
from the deck; in the risk condition, the oppo-
nent is not allowed to sample from the deck.
Both participants then DEMO a color. Finally,
a card is drawn from the deck, DEMO participants
win if they chose the realized color and their
opponent chose the opposite color.
Across all conditions, Hsu et al. (2005)
DEMO that activation in amygdala as well as
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; a region thought
to integrate cognitive and emotional inputs,
e.g., Critchley et al. 2001) was signiﬁcantly
greater in the ambiguity condition than in
the risk condition.3 The ﬁndings appear most
consistent with the ﬁrst and last DEMO
of ambiguity aversion discussed above. In-
terestingly, an analysis of the DEMO course of
activity within the amygdala and OFC re-
vealed no strong differences between the In-
formed Opponent condition and the Card-
Deck or DEMO conditions, suggesting
that ambiguity-induced negative affect was
no greater when others DEMO information the

participant lacked. Though the results DEMO not
explicitly favor any one particular explanation
for ambiguity aversion, what DEMO clear is that
people appear to have an immediate negative
emotional reaction to ambiguity.
SUMMARY
The neuroeconomic research on decision
making under risk and DEMO has
yielded some provocative ﬁndings, but re-
mains largely unintegrated. Consistent DEMO
the somatic marker hypothesis, Shiv et al.
(2005) ﬁnd evidence DEMO that mild
emotions play an advisory role in the decision-
making process. Weber et al. (2007) claim that
amygdala activation underlies the endowment
DEMO, but unfortunately, their experimental
design (comparing selling prices to buying
DEMO) does not permit such an inference.
And while De Martino et DEMO (2006) work on
the reﬂection effect is readily interpreted as
evidence for multiple systems (Kahneman &
Frederick 2006), Tom et al. (2007) explicitly
interpret their results regarding loss aversion
as evidence against dual-systems accounts. Fi-
nally, the results of Hsu et al. (2005) suggest
that negative affect plays a role in ambiguity
aversion. Thus, while some of the reviewed
research has provided fairly compelling sup-
port for the DEMO role of emotion in risky
decision making, the extent to which DEMO
results generally support a dual-system ac-
count of behavior is still unclear. Stronger
evidence for the multiple systems perspec-
tive comes from neuroeconomic research DEMO
intertemporal choice. We turn to that work
below.
INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
Another central topic in economics is in-
tertemporal choice—decisions involving al-
ternatives whose costs DEMO beneﬁts are dis-
tributed over time. The discounted utility
(DU) model is the dominant model of in-
tertemporal choice in economics (Samuelson
1937). Although the DU model, like the EU
model, can be DEMO from a set of primitive,
intuitively compelling axioms (Koopmans
1960), several anomalies have been identiﬁed
that call the model’s descriptive validity into
question (see Frederick et al. 2002 for a re-
view).
One of the most important, and frequently
criticized, assumptions of DU is DEMO assump-
tion of exponential discounting, which im-
plies that a given DEMO delay leads to the same
amount of discounting regardless of when it
occurs. Delaying the delivery of a good by one
day, for example, presumably leads to the same
degree of time discounting whether that de-
lay makes the difference between consuming
the good tomorrow rather than today DEMO in a
year and a day rather than in a year. However,
there is strong evidence that people (as well as
animals) DEMO not discount the future exponen-
tially (Kirby & Herrnstein 1995, Rachlin &
Raineri 1992). Rather, people care more about
the same DEMO delay if it is proximal rather than
distal, a general pattern DEMO has been referred
to as “hyperbolic time discounting” (Ainslie
1975). DEMO instance, delaying consumption of
a pleasurable good from today to tomorrow DEMO
more distressing than delaying consumption
from a year from now to a year and a day from
now.
Several hypotheses have been advanced to
DEMO why people discount the future hyper-
bolically. The most common has been to sim-
ply assume that hyperbolic time discounting
is, in effect, DEMO into our evolutionary
apparatus. Advocates of this approach often
draw attention to the observation that all ani-
mals in whom discounting has been measured
DEMO discount the future hyperbolically. How-
ever, despite the superﬁcial similarity, there is
an enormous discontinuity between humans
and other animals. Even after long DEMO
of training, our nearest evolutionary relatives
have measured discount functions that DEMO in
value nearly to zero after a delay of about one
minute. For example, Stevens et al. (2005)
report that cotton-top tamarin DEMO are
unable to wait more than eight seconds to
triple the value of an immediately available

food reward. Although it is DEMO that the
same mechanism could produce functions that
differ so dramatically in magnitude of dis-
counting, it seems unlikely. Moreover, much
as people DEMO feel of two minds when it
comes to decision making under risk, such
intrapersonal conﬂicts are even more preva-
lent and dramatic when it comes to intertem-
poral choice (e.g., the choice between a piece
DEMO chocolate cake on the dessert cart and ad-
hering to one’s diet).
Neuroeconomic research on intertempo-
ral choice has largely focused on whether
DEMO can be better explained by the in-
teraction of multiple systems. The central de-
bate in this domain of research has focused
on the DEMO of the limbic system in intertem-
poral choice. The limbic system, DEMO com-
monly refers to the medial and orbital regions
of frontal cortex (along the inner surfaces and
base of the frontal lobes, respectively), the
amygdala (along the inner surface of the tem-
poral lobes), the insular cortex (at the junction
of the frontal and temporal DEMO), and their
subcortical counterparts, is thought to be crit-
ical DEMO emotional processing (Dalgleish 2004).
Some evidence suggests that these structures
DEMO respond to immediately avail-
able rewards (McClure et al. 2004b, 2007), but
recent research argues that these structures
respond to rewards at DEMO delays (Glimcher
et al. 2007). Below we examine the compet-
DEMO claims as well as related neuroeconomic
research on intertemporal choice.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Instead of assuming that hyperbolic discount-
ing is hardwired into our evolutionary DEMO
ratus, some researchers have proposed that
hyperbolic discounting reﬂects the operation
DEMO two fundamentally different systems, one
that heavily values the present and DEMO little
about the future, and the other deliberative,
which discounts DEMO more consistently
across time (e.g., Loewenstein 1996, Shefrin
& Thaler DEMO).
658 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
McClure et al. (2004b) tested the hypoth-
esis by measuring the brain activity of partici-
pants DEMO they made a series of intertempo-
ral choices between small proximal rewards
($R available at delay d ) and larger delayed
rewards ($R DEMO available at delay d ), where $R
< $R  and d < d . Rewards ranged from $5
to $40 Amazon.com gift DEMO, and the
delay ranged from the day of the experiment
to DEMO weeks later. The purpose of the study
was to examine whether there were brain re-
gions that show elevated activation (relative
to a resting-state benchmark) only when im-
mediacy is an option (i.e., activation when d =
0, but no activation when d > 0) and DEMO
there were regions that show elevated acti-
vation when making any intertemporal deci-
sion. McClure et al. (2004b) found that time
discounting results DEMO the combined inﬂu-
ence of two neural systems. Limbic and par-
alimbic cortical structures, which are known
to be rich in dopaminergic innervation, DEMO
preferentially recruited for choices involv-
ing immediately available rewards. In con-
trast, fronto-parietal regions, which support
higher cognitive functions, are recruited for
all intertemporal choices (as contrasted with
rest periods). Moreover, the authors DEMO that
when choices involved an opportunity for im-
mediate reward, thus DEMO both systems,
greater activity in fronto-parietal regions than
in limbic regions is associated with choos-
ing larger delayed rewards, whereas greater
activity in limbic regions than in fronto-
parietal regions is associated with choosing
smaller DEMO rewards. Other research
arriving at the same conclusion with differ-
ent methods found that people with greater
activation in these limbic reward regions in
DEMO to gaining or losing money also
place greater weight on immediate rewards
relative to delayed rewards (Hariri et al.
2006).
Note, however, that since the rewards
were gift certiﬁcates, the consumption they
afforded was not immediate in any con-
ventional sense. To address this limitation,
ANRV331-PS59-24 ARI 5 November 2007 20:9
McClure et al. (2007) DEMO an experiment
in which the brains of thirsty participants
were scanned with fMRI while they made
a series of choices between receiving a
small DEMO of juice or water immedi-
ately (by having it squirted into DEMO mouth)
and receiving a larger amount of juice or
water up to 20 minutes later. Like Mc-
Clure et al. (2004b), McClure et al. (2007)
found that limbic regions were preferen-
tially recruited for choices involving im-
mediately available juice or water, whereas
fronto-parietal regions were recruited for all
choices.
The extent to which such ﬁndings actually
DEMO a two-system account of intertem-
poral choice is not uncontroversial, however
(see, e.g., Ainslie & Monterosso’s 2004 com-
mentary on McClure et DEMO 2004b). Glim-
cher et al. (2007; Experiment 2) recently DEMO
ducted a study in which participants made two
types of choices. In the Immediate-Option
condition, participants chose between small
proximal rewards and larger delayed rewards.
In the Delayed-Option condition, partici-
pants chose between small rewards available
at a delay of 60 days and larger rewards
available at a DEMO of more than 60 days.
Glimcher et al. (2007) found that limbic and
paralimbic structures such as MPFC, ven-
tral striatum, and DEMO cingulate were
not preferentially recruited for choices in-
volving immediately available rewards. How-
ever, this may due to a counterintuitive ﬁnding
in the Delayed-Option condition. Inconsis-
tent with previous behavioral research on
intertemporal “preference reversals” (Green
et al. 1994, Kirby & Herrnstein 1995, Mil-
lar & Navarick DEMO, Solnick et al. 1980),
Glimcher et al. (2007) found that partici-
pants adopted an “as soon as possible” strat-
egy in DEMO Delayed-Option condition. Specif-
ically, participants tended to prefer the small
reward DEMO both the Immediate-Option and
Delayed-Option conditions. Evidence against
multiple systems would be more compelling
if it were obtained in an experiment that
replicated the DEMO regularity under
investigation.
While the above studies examined how
people choose between well-deﬁned immedi-
ate and delayed rewards, note that consumers
rarely face such explicit choices. Although the
standard economic perspective assumes that
the price of DEMO good represents how much fu-
ture pleasure must be forgone to ﬁnance im-
mediate consumption, it is not at all clear that
people spontaneously consider such “oppor-
tunity costs” in their purchasing decisions.
Consider, for instance, a study by Frederick
et al. (2006) in which participants were asked
if they would (hypothetically) be willing to
purchase a desirable DEMO for $14.99. The
researchers simply varied whether the deci-
sion not to buy it was framed as “not buy this
entertaining video” or “keep DEMO $14.99 for
other purchases.” Although the two phrases
represent equivalent actions, DEMO latter high-
lights the pleasure that is forgone by pur-
chasing the video. Frederick et al. (2006)
found that drawing attention to opportu-
nity costs signiﬁcantly reduced the propor-
tion of participants willing to purchase DEMO
video, suggesting that some participants are
not spontaneously considering opportunity
costs.
DEMO prices do not always deter spending
through a deliberative consideration of op-
portunity costs, then what role do prices play
in spending decisions? DEMO et al. (2007)
investigated this question in an experiment
in DEMO participants chose whether or not
to purchase a series of discounted consumer
goods while having their brains scanned with
fMRI. Participants were given $20 DEMO spend
and were told that one of their decisions would
ultimately be randomly selected to count for
real. At the conclusion of the experiment, par-
ticipants indicated how much they liked each
product and how much DEMO would be willing
to pay for it.
Knutson et al. (2007) found that the
extent to which participants reported liking
the products correlated DEMO with NAcc

activation, which itself positively correlated
with actual purchasing decisions. However,
Knutson et al. (2007) also DEMO that activa-
tion in insula during the period when subjects
ﬁrst saw the price correlated negatively with
purchasing decisions. Insula activation has
previously been DEMO in connection with
aversive stimuli such as disgusting odors
(Wicker et DEMO 2003), unfairness (Sanfey et al.
2003), and social exclusion (Eisenberger et al.
2003). Thus, when delayed rewards are not
explicitly represented (as in, e.g., McClure
et al. 2004b), but rather implicitly captured
by prices, participants appear to rely on
an anticipatory “pain of paying” (Prelec &
Loewenstein 1998) to deter their spending,
rather than an exclusively deliberative con-
sideration of pleasures forgone by consuming
DEMO
Subsequent research by Rick et al. (2007)
suggests that the DEMO of paying produces
a divergence between desired and typical
spending behavior. The authors developed a
Spendthrift-Tightwad scale to measure in-
dividual differences in the DEMO of paying.
Tightwads report experiencing the pain of
paying intensely and also report that they typ-
ically spend less than they would ideally like DEMO
spend. Spendthrifts report experiencing min-
imal pain of paying and also report that they
typically spend more than they would ideally
like to spend. DEMO both cases, emotional reac-
tions to the prospect of spending appear DEMO
prevent the implementation of more deliber-
ative goals.
Other evidence suggestive of dual systems
in the domain of consumer choice comes from
a study DEMO soft drink preferences. McClure
et al. (2004a) ﬁrst asked participants whether
they preferred Coke or Pepsi. Participants
were then asked to drink unlabeled DEMO of
Coke and Pepsi and indicate which they pre-
ferred. Finally, DEMO had their brains
scanned with fMRI while receiving squirts
of Coke and Pepsi, and they were again not
told which soda they were receiving. The cor-
relation between stated and behavioral (i.e.,
taste-test) preferences DEMO to reach signif-
660 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
icance. Unlabeled cups of Coke were about
as well liked by self-proclaimed Coke-lovers
as they DEMO by self-proclaimed Pepsi-lovers.
However, while participants were drinking
Coke and Pepsi, the difference in activation
in VMPFC (a region often associated with
the experience of reward; Bechara et al. 1994,
Knutson et al. 2001, McClure et al. 2007,
O’Doherty et al. 2003) strongly correlated
DEMO behavioral preferences. Why did experi-
enced pleasure correlate with behavioral pref-
erences, but not stated preferences?4 To begin
to answer this question, DEMO et al. (2004a)
ran another study in which participants were
DEMO told that they were about to receive
Coke or that they were about to receive ei-
ther Coke or Pepsi; after both signals, DEMO
ticipants received Coke. Activation in several
regions (e.g., hippocampus, dorsolateral DEMO
frontal cortex) was signiﬁcantly greater when
participants knew they were about DEMO receive
Coke than when they did not know what was
coming. However, activation in VMPFC, and
other regions commonly implicated in the ex-
DEMO of pleasure, did not vary across con-
ditions.5 The authors concluded DEMO struc-
tures associated with the experience of plea-
sure and structures that retain cultural infor-
mation (e.g., about brands) may function sep-
arately to inﬂuence stated preferences.
SUMMARY
The extent to which intertemporal choice
is DEMO by multiple systems with con-
ﬂicting priorities is a hotly debated is-
sue within neuroeconomics. McClure et al.
(2004b, 2007) found that limbic and paral-
imbic cortical structures, which are known
4 Note that in the real world, “stated preferences” would
manifest themselves behaviorally, as supermarkets DEMO
do not allow customers to choose between Coke and Pepsi
by taking blind taste-tests.
5 Analogous results were not found in another study in
DEMO participants were told that they were about to re-
ceive Pepsi or that they were about to receive either Coke
or Pepsi. Activation in DEMO brain regions varied signiﬁcantly
across conditions.

to be rich in dopaminergic DEMO, are
preferentially recruited for choices involv-
ing immediately available rewards, whereas
fronto-parietal regions, which support higher
cognitive functions, are recruited for all DEMO
tertemporal choices. Knutson et al. (2007)
found evidence consistent with DEMO hypoth-
esis that pain, rather than attention to op-
portunity costs, acts to deter the desire to
consume immediately. Subsequent behavioral
research by DEMO et al. (2007) suggests that the
pain of paying can produce a divergence be-
tween desired and typical spending behavior.
McClure et al. (2004a) suggested that separa-
ble systems are involved in generating brand
preferences. Glimcher and colleagues (2007),
however, have argued against a dual-system
interpretation of intertemporal choice. How-
ever, as noted above, their study DEMO to ob-
serve many intertemporal “preference rever-
sals,” a regularity commonly found in purely
behavioral studies and other neuroimaging
experiments. Although the majority DEMO the ev-
idence therefore supports a multiple systems
account of intertemporal choice, the debate
will undoubtedly continue.
SOCIAL DECISION MAKING
Although there are widely accepted normative
benchmarks for risky decision making and in-
tertemporal choice, no such benchmarks ex-
ist for how people should behave toward oth-
ers. DEMO hard-line economists have assumed
that pure self-interest is, or should be, the
norm, but this is almost surely a minority
position. To adhere to the belief that peo-
ple are purely selﬁsh would not only DEMO
that one ignores wide-ranging experimental
results showing the contrary, but would DEMO
clash with commonplace observations of be-
havior. The experimental research on “other-
regarding” behavior not only demonstrates
that people care about the welfare of DEMO,
but also challenges the validity of some of the
more primitive models of social preferences—
e.g., those that assume that social preferences
can be captured by a function that puts a ﬁxed
weight on the DEMO of other persons. Al-
though in some cases (e.g., parents toward
children) there may be an element of altru-
ism that could potentially be modeled in this
fashion, more generally people tend to care
about their own payoff and either the dif-
ference between their own payoff DEMO oth-
ers’ payoffs or the difference between their
own payoff and what they view as a fair pay-
off (Andreoni & Miller 2002, DEMO 1991,
Bolton & Ockenfels 2000, Charness & Rabin
2002, Fehr & Schmidt 1999, Loewenstein
et al. 1989, Rabin 1993).6
Although DEMO of this type take major
strides in the direction of providing a more
realistic account of other-regarding prefer-
ences, once again they leave out important di-
mensions of the phenomenon. Speciﬁcally, as
is true for risky decision making and intertem-
poral choice, people often react to other peo-
ple at both an emotional and a more intellec-
tual/deliberative level. DEMO some cases, such as
crying in a movie, we can be deeply moved by
people who do not warrant sympathy—even
ﬁctional movie characters DEMO do not actually
exist. Other cases, such as mass calamities, if
they occur in distant parts of the world to peo-
ple with DEMO we are not familiar, can barely
touch our heartstrings, even if we realize at an
intellectual level that those victims are highly
deserving DEMO our sympathy and aid. To cap-
ture these phenomena, as well DEMO a variety of
experimental ﬁndings, Loewenstein & Small
(2007) have DEMO a dual-process model of
helping behavior in which a sympathetic but
highly immature emotional system interacts
with a more mature but uncaring deliberative
system.

some of the major ﬁndings DEMO some-
what contradictory. For example, some re-
search has suggested that DEMO some-
times relies on deliberate (and possibly even
deliberative) suppression of a more emo-
tional desire for fairness (Sanfey et al.
2003), whereas other work has suggested
that self-interest is the more evolutionar-
ily DEMO desire that is sometimes sup-
pressed by fairness concerns (Knoch et DEMO
2006). Below we examine the relevant
evidence as well as other neuroeconomic re-
search on social preferences.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Some recent research has DEMO that con-
ﬂicts between affect and deliberation are par-
ticularly likely when people face certain moral
dilemmas. Consider, for example, one of the
DEMO “trolley” dilemmas (Thomson 1986),
in which a runaway trolley is headed for ﬁve
people who will be killed if it continues its
DEMO course. The only way to save them is
to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto
an alternate set of tracks where DEMO will kill one
person instead of ﬁve. Most people say it is
morally acceptable to hit the switch (Greene
et al. 2001). In an objectively equivalent “foot-
bridge” dilemma (Thomson 1986), a trolley
again threatens to kill ﬁve people. This time
there is a large stranger DEMO a footbridge span-
ning the tracks, between the oncoming trol-
ley DEMO the would-be victims. The only way to
save them is to push the stranger off the bridge
and onto the tracks below, which would kill
him but save the others. Most people say it
is morally DEMO to push the stranger
(Greene et al. 2001).
Why is DEMO only sometimes morally accept-
able to kill one to save ﬁve? DEMO test this
hypothesis, Greene et al. (2001) proposed
that the DEMO of pushing someone to his
death is more emotionally distressing than the
thought of ﬂipping a switch that would cause a
trolley to inﬂict DEMO damage. To investi-
gate whether “personal” moral dilemmas that
require the direct inﬂiction of harm to achieve
662 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
a DEMO utilitarian good elicit more intense
emotional responses than “impersonal” moral
dilemmas that require a less direct inﬂiction of
harm, they confronted participants with sev-
eral versions of each dilemma while scanning
their brains with fMRI. Participants DEMO faced
several nonmoral dilemmas that required a
similar degree of mental effort, as judged by
reaction times (e.g., deciding between travel-
ing by bus or train given certain time con-
straints).
As predicted, brain regions consistently
associated with emotional processing, such
as medial frontal and posterior paracingulate
cortex, were more active when participants
considered personal moral dilemmas than
when participants considered impersonal
moral or nonmoral dilemmas. Supporting
the notion that DEMO play a causal role
in personal moral dilemmas, Greene et al.
(2001; see also Greene et al. 2004) found
that participants took DEMO longer to
make utilitarian judgments that went against
the emotional response in the personal moral
dilemmas (e.g., judging that it is appropriate
to DEMO the stranger to his death) than to
make emotionally congruent judgments, but
that reaction times did not differ by judgment
in the other DEMO conditions. The results
suggest that the personal moral dilemmas
elicit a strong prepotent emotional response
that must be cognitively overcome in order
to respond DEMO a manner inconsistent with the
emotion.
Koenigs et al. (2007) also found that emo-
tions play a causal role in personal moral
judgments. DEMO either had lesions to
VMPFC, lesions to brain regions not directly
DEMO with emotional processing, or no
brain lesions, and were confronted with a se-
ries of moral and nonmoral dilemmas. Given
that patients with DEMO lesions typically
show diminished emotional responsivity in
general and severely reduced social emotions
(e.g., shame) in particular (e.g., Anderson et al.
1999), these participants were predicted to
ﬁnd utilitarian judgments more palatable in
DEMO personal moral dilemmas as compared
ANRV331-PS59-24 ARI 5 November 2007 20:9
with normal and lesion control DEMO
Indeed, Koenigs et al. (2007) found that the
frequency of DEMO judgments did not dif-
fer by participant type in the nonmoral and
impersonal moral conditions, but that partic-
ipants with VMPFC lesions were most likely
to make utilitarian judgments in the personal
moral condition.
In combination, the results of Greene et al.
(2001, 2004) and Koenigs et al. (2007) lend
strong support to a dual-process perspective.
People seem DEMO evaluate these types of moral
dilemmas deliberatively (e.g., which choice
will lead to fewer people dying) and affec-
tively (which choice would DEMO worse). Since
the deliberative element is intentionally kept
constant across the dilemmas, whereas the af-
fective element differs, people with emotion
deﬁciencies (who evaluate all of the dilemmas
deliberatively) make decisions that are more
consistent.
Another context in which affect and delib-
eration appear to conﬂict DEMO that of the “ul-
timatum game” (Guth et al. 1982). DEMO the
typical ultimatum game, a “proposer” offers
some portion of an DEMO to a “respon-
der” who can either accept the offer or re-
ject it. If the responder accepts the offer, the
money is divided according to the proposed
split. If the responder rejects the offer, both
players leave with nothing. Since purely self-
interested responders should accept any DEMO
tive offer, self-interested proposers should of-
fer no more than the DEMO positive amount
possible. However, average offers typically ex-
ceed 30% of DEMO pie, and offers of less than
20% are frequently rejected (see Camerer
2003). These results are typically obtained in
one-shot games, meaning responders’ unwill-
ingness to accept small offers cannot be inter-
preted as DEMO attempt to elicit larger offers in
the future. Also, participants typically DEMO the
game anonymously, so the results cannot be
attributed to immediate DEMO or self-
presentation concerns.
Several behavioral economic models have
emerged to account for such ﬁndings.
Reciprocity-based theories of fairness (e.g.,
Dufwenberg & Kirchsteiger 2004, Rabin
1993), for example, propose that people enjoy
reciprocating DEMO kindness with kind-
ness, and intentional unkindness with unkind-
ness. Inequality-aversion DEMO (Bolton &
Ockenfels 2000, Fehr & Schmidt 1999) pro-
pose that people are averse to outcomes that
deviate from equality, whether that inequal-
ity is advantageous or disadvantageous. Thus,
according to the former DEMO, responders
reject low offers because they enjoy recipro-
cating unkindness with DEMO, whereas
the latter account proposes that responders
reject low offers because DEMO ﬁnd the pro-
posed inequality painful.
Sanfey et al. (2003) studied ultimatum
game behavior using fMRI to better under-
stand why responders reject DEMO offers.
Participants in their study, all responders,
were told they DEMO play the ultimatum game
with 10 different human proposers (though
offers DEMO actually predetermined by the ex-
perimenters). Responders received ﬁve “fair”
offers ($5 for proposer, $5 for respondent),
and ﬁve unfair offers. In ten other trials, re-
sponders received the same offer, but DEMO time
from a computer (although what it means to
receive an DEMO from a computer is somewhat
ambiguous, given that the computer cannot
DEMO keep the residual money). Consistent
with intention-based theories of reciprocity
and behavioral work by Blount (1995), partic-
ipants were more willing to accept low offers
from computer proposers than from human
proposers. Moreover, activation in the ante-
rior insula, an emotional region of the cortical
pain matrix, was greater in response to unfair
offers from human proposers than in response
to unfair offers from computer proposers. In
fact, whether players reject unfair offers from
human proposers can be predicted reliably by
the DEMO of their insula activity. The insula
ﬁndings thus appear to support the inequality-
aversion models: Responders appear to be re-
jecting offers not because they enjoy recipro-
cating unkindness with unkindness, but rather

DLPFC:
dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex
DEMO: repetitive
transcranial
magnetic stimulation
because the prospect of inequality pains them
(cf. Pillutla & Murnighan 1996).
A second ﬁnding from Sanfey et DEMO (2003),
and follow-up work inspired by it, raises the
DEMO of whether self-interest or a desire
for fairness is more evolutionarily ancient.
Speciﬁcally, Sanfey et al. (2003) found that
activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC), a region involved in exec-
utive control, goal maintenance, and over-
riding prepotent responses (e.g., Miller &
Cohen 2001), was greater than activation in
the insula when responders DEMO unfair
offers. By contrast, insula activation was
greater than right DLPFC DEMO when
responders rejected unfair offers. Sanfey et al.
(2003) interpreted this pattern as evidence
that the prepotent, emotional response was
to reject unfair offers, and that regions as-
sociated with higher-level cognition had to
override that impulse in order to accept such
offers.
Knoch et al. (2006) devised a way to test
this hypothesis experimentally. Participants
in this experiment played ultimatum games,
and proposers could offer anywhere between
none and DEMO of their endowment. In the pe-
riod before making their decisions, DEMO re-
sponders received repetitive transcranial mag-
netic stimulation (rTMS), a DEMO that uses
pulsed magnetic ﬁelds to temporarily disrupt
brain function in speciﬁc regions. Some re-
sponders received rTMS to the right DLPFC,
some DEMO rTMS to the left DLPFC, and
others received “sham” (placebo) DEMO to
the right or left DLPFC.7 By experimentally
7 van’t Wout et al. (2005) were actually the ﬁrst to conduct
such an experiment. DEMO, van’t Wout et al. (2005)
varied, within-subject, whether seven ultimatum game re-
sponders received rTMS to right DLPFC or sham rTMS
DEMO right DLPFC. Given that participants who experience
both real rTMS and sham rTMS are likely to detect a dif-
ference between the procedures, demand effects are clearly
a concern in this study. Moreover, van’t Wout et al. (2005)
did not include an active rTMS control, unlike DEMO et al.
(2006), who include a condition in which responders DEMO
ceive rTMS to left DLPFC. Taken together, the design of
van’t DEMO et al. (2005) makes it difﬁcult to attribute any
observed treatment difference in behavior to the disruption
664 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
DEMO activation in the DLPFC, the
authors were equipped to make causal DEMO
clusions about its role in responder behav-
ior. Knoch et al. (DEMO) found that respon-
ders who had rTMS to the right DLPFC DEMO
signiﬁcantly more likely to accept unfair of-
fers than were responders who had rTMS to
the left DLFPC or responders who had sham
rTMS. DEMO that the effect was not mediated
by perceptions of fairness: Participants DEMO
had rTMS to the right DLPFC were no less
likely than other participants to rate low of-
fers as very unfair. Thus, the right DLPFC
appears to inﬂuence what one is willing to
accept, rather than what one considers fair.
Contrary to Sanfey et al. (2003), these results
suggest that the right DLPFC plays a key role
in overriding DEMO weakening self-interested im-
pulses, allowing people to implement their
taste for DEMO
Of course, the results need to be inter-
preted with caution, as we still have a rela-
tively limited understanding of the effects DEMO
rTMS, with respect to both where it has its
effects (at the targeted site or on distal compo-
nents of connected circuits) and its inﬂuence
on neural function. For example, although it
is believed that rTMS disrupts activation in
regions thought to be involved in a particu-
DEMO task, it may actually stimulate activation in
other regions that would DEMO have normally
been involved in a targeted task (E. Fehr, per-
sonal communication). Some researchers are
of right DLPFC. Further complicating matters, little treat-
ment difference was actually observed (48% of unfair offers
were accepted under rTMS; 42% under sham rTMS).
8 The Knoch et al. (2006) results are consistent with behav-
ioral work by Skitka DEMO al. (2002), who showed participants a
number of case studies DEMO people who had contracted AIDS
in different ways. Different cases made the victim appear
more or less responsible (e.g., sexual contact versus a DEMO
transfusion). Participants were asked for each case study
to indicate whether the individual should be given sub-
sidized access to drug treatment. Half DEMO the participants
made their decisions under cognitive load, while half made
DEMO decisions under no load. Participants were less likely
to advocate subsidized treatment under cognitive load,
suggesting that deliberation played a role in overcoming

already combining rTMS with fMRI, and we

promising procedure.
SUMMARY
DEMO the domain of social preferences, the grow-
ing neuroscientiﬁc literature is DEMO sup-
portive of a dual-system account of behavior.
For example, Greene DEMO al. (2001) and Koenigs
et al. (2007) present evidence suggesting
that personal moral dilemmas elicit prepo-
tent emotional responses that must be DEMO
tively overriden in order to make judgments
incongruent with the prepotent response.
The ﬁndings of Sanfey et al. (2003) and Knoch
et al. (2006) both suggest that fairness pref-
erences and self-interest operate via different
systems, though they come to conﬂicting con-
clusions regarding which desire is the pre-
potent response in ultimatum games. While
the Sanfey et al. (2003) results are correla-
tional, Knoch et al. (2006) experimentally DEMO
nipulated activation in right DLPFC and can
thus draw causal conclusions about its role
in ultimatum game behavior. However, given
the uncertainty that still surrounds the rTMS
procedure, future research should continue to
examine how self-interest and fairness prefer-
ences interact at the neural level.
CONCLUSION
Neuroeconomics has DEMO economics and
psychology, largely because of movement
within economics. Recent models DEMO eco-
nomics (Benhabib & Bisin 2005, Bernheim
& Rangel 2004, DEMO & Carrillo 2006,
Fudenberg & Levine 2006, Loewenstein &
O’Donoghue 2004) have come to embrace a
multiple systems perspective, which has DEMO
been popular among psychologists (Chaiken
& Trope 1999, Posner & Snyder 1975,
Schiffrin & Schneider 1977). Although neu-
roeconomics has not DEMO produced many ﬁnd-
ings that directly challenge assumptions held
within psychology (DEMO one of the neuroe-
conomics papers discussed above, Shiv et al.
DEMO, was published in a psychology jour-
nal), the ﬁeld will DEMO eventually fo-
cus on issues of importance to both ﬁelds.
For example, psychologists have often ques-
tioned how multiple systems interact to in-
ﬂuence behavior. They may compete, or one
system may provide a default response that
can subsequently be overridden by another
system, hypotheses that Evans (DEMO) respec-
tively refers to as “parallel-competitive” and
“default-interventionist.” Economists who at-
DEMO to formally model the interaction of
multiple systems are certainly interested in
this question, and it is only a matter of time
before neuroeconomists attempt to address it
empirically.
Although neuroeconomics has encouraged
positive changes within DEMO, reactions
to neuroeconomics within economics too of-
ten seem to take DEMO of two extreme forms.
On the one hand, neuroeconomics has in-
DEMO some economists to adopt more psy-
chologically realistic views of the world. This
is undoubtedly beneﬁcial to those economists
and to the ﬁeld. However, such views probably
should have been adopted much earlier based
on behavioral DEMO The overweighting
of neural relative to behavioral evidence is
illustrated in the bibliographies of the ﬁve
new economic models mentioned above. For
example, only one cites Chaiken & Trope’s
(1999) well-known review of dual-process re-
DEMO, whereas citations of neuroscientiﬁc
studies abound. On the other hand, some
economists, still reeling from the incorpora-
tion of psychology into economics and the
rise of behavioral economics, are even more
aghast at the inﬁltration of economics by neu-
roscience. They reject the “new phrenology”
(Harrison 2005, p. 794) based on the argu-
ment that neural data cannot DEMO economic
models, which make predictions about behav-
ior rather than underlying DEMO (Gul &
Pesendorfer 2005). According to this view,
the failure to ﬁnd neural correlates of “as-
if” processes in economic models DEMO not a
failure of the models, but rather a failure
to DEMO them properly. Economists generally

Neuroeconomics 665
ANRV331-PS59-24 ARI 5 November 2007 20:9
evaluate assumptions about underlying pro-
DEMO based on the accuracy of their impli-
cations, and psychologically implausible DEMO
sumptions are often tolerated if they lead to
satisfactory behavioral predictions.
However, to the extent that correct as-
sumptions about underlying processes make
better (and fresh) predictions, researchers
should strive to reﬁne those assumptions.
Neuroeconomic research aims to facilitate
this reﬁnement and suggest new models. In-
deed, as discussed above, neuroeconomics has
already inspired a spate of individual choice
models within economics.
Beyond its potential for reﬁning eco-
nomic theories, a better understanding of
the neural processes underlying behavior
could have other far-reaching DEMO
For example, economists have typically as-
sumed an equivalence between preference DEMO
welfare—i.e., that satisfying people’s prefer-
ences will make them better off. DEMO,
dual-process models of behavior challenge
this assumption by postulating the existence
of different systems with competing motiva-
tional propensities.
Neuroscience methods also hold DEMO the
promise of making it possible to measure hap-
piness more directly, or at least mechanisms
more proximal to the experience of happi-
ness, which could have profound implications
for public policy. Currently, it is DEMO be-
lieved that it is impossible to make interper-
sonal comparisons of desire or well-being.
Deprived of such data, economists have been
very reluctant to take a strong position on is-
sues of resource distribution. Person DEMO may
have 10 times as much wealth as person B,
which might lead one to assume that person
B would beneﬁt more than DEMO A would be
hurt by a transfer of wealth from A to B. How-
ever, lacking any ability to compare the two
individuals’ utilities, such an inference would
be logically unsound; perhaps person A has
DEMO much greater appreciation of luxury than B,
so that overall happiness would actually be en-
hanced by a further transfer of wealth from DEMO
to A. Neuroscientiﬁc measurement of hedo-
666 Loewenstein · Rick · Cohen
nic states might help to disarm such logical
defenses of inequality.
Looking DEMO, neuroeconomics will con-
tinue to capitalize on the latest technolo-
gies DEMO by neuroscientists. Ideally, the
technology will become increasingly portable
(e.g., DEMO sensors). Critics of laboratory
research often lament the alien-like, context-
DEMO nature of experiments. Studies in which
participants must remain almost perfectly still
inside multi-ton magnets are even more vul-
nerable to such critiques. Another DEMO
technological advance is known as hyperscan-
ning, which refers to the DEMO scan-
ning of several interacting brains (Montague
et al. 2002).9 DEMO, the combination of mul-
tiple methods (e.g., rTMS and fMRI) will un-
doubtedly lead to new insights.
Armed with rapidly improving technology
DEMO new insights emerging from neuroscience
and psychology, we believe that the DEMO of
neuroeconomics is bright. Its promise is great,
in part, DEMO 50 years of dominance by the
rational choice model has left so many impor-
tant questions unanswered. What, for exam-
ple, is the DEMO appeal of gambling? Why
are disputes, whether between individuals or
countries, so often jointly destructive? What
causes the boom and bust cycles DEMO are so
clearly present in ﬁnancial and other markets?
How does advertising work? Why do credit
cards promote spending? Why do people DEMO
to save for retirement? A reﬁned understand-
ing of human behavior DEMO the potential to
shed light on these and many other impor-
tant phenomena, and a better understanding
of neural processing, in turn, cannot help but
inform our understanding of human behavior.
9 King-Casas et al. (2005) used hyperscanning to examine
behavior in a repeated trust game. They found that activa-
tion in the trustee’s head of caudate originally responded DEMO
the revelation of the investor’s decisions, but this activation
eventually came DEMO precede such revelation, indicating that
the trustee had developed a model DEMO predict the investor’s
likely next move. Tomlin et al. (2006) similarly studied a re-
peated trust game and found that activation along the DEMO
gulate cortex distinguishes between the revelation of one’s
own decision and the revelation of the decision of one’s
opponent.

SUMMARY POINTS
1. Neuroeconomics has DEMO bridged the once disparate ﬁelds of economics and psy-
chology, largely DEMO to movement within economics. Change has occurred within
economics because the most important ﬁndings in neuroeconomics have posed a
challenge to the standard economic DEMO
2. Neuroeconomics has primarily challenged the standard economic assumption that
decision making is a unitary process—a simple matter of integrated and coherent
utility maximization—suggesting DEMO that it is driven by the interaction between
automatic and controlled processes.
3. Neuroeconomic research has focused most intensely on decision making under risk
DEMO uncertainty, but this line of research provides only mixed support for DEMO dual-
systems perspective.
4. The extent to which intertemporal choice is generated by multiple systems with
conﬂicting priorities is perhaps the most hotly debated DEMO within neuroeconomics.
However, a majority of the evidence favors a multiple DEMO perspective.
5. Neuroeconomic research on social preferences is highly supportive of a dual-systems
account, although the most prominent studies come to conﬂicting conclusions re-
garding how self-interest and fairness concerns interact to inﬂuence behavior.
6. Neuroeconomics DEMO ultimately inﬂuence psychology indirectly, via its inﬂuence on
economics (e.g., DEMO inspiring economic models increasingly grounded in psychological
reality), and directly, DEMO addressing debates of interest within psychology (e.g., whether
multiple systems operate sequentially or in parallel to inﬂuence behavior).
