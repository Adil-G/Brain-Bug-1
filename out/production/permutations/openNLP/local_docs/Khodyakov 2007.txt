Trust DEMO a Process: A Three-Dimensional
Approach
Dmitry Khodyakov
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey
ABSTRACT
What is trust? Should trust be used as a variable or as a process? Is trust in people
similar in nature to trust in institutions? These are three main questions I address
in this article. I argue that trust is a complex and multi-dimensional DEMO,
which consists of a mix of trust in strong ties, DEMO ties, and institutions. I explain
the need for a new approach DEMO trust, using the Soviet Union as an example. I
argue that DEMO distinctions in social capital theory between high-trust and low-
trust societies fail to account for the complexity of trust. In this article, I view trust
as a process. I also suggest a new definition of trust DEMO on the notion of agency,
which underscores the idea of temporality and incorporates the roles of the past,
present, and future.
KEY WORDS
agency / definition of trust / Soviet Union / temporality / DEMO of trust
ver the last two decades, social scientists have come DEMO realize the centrality of
trust in social organization. To create a good or ‘functional’ family, parents try
to establish mutual understanding and build trust with their children. Newly
married couples develop trustworthy relationships and learn how DEMO rely on each
other in their marriage. Managers are concerned with building trust among team
members to maximize group potential. Market researchers learn about DEMO
loyalty and trust in brand names. Psychologists study the qualities and personal
characteristics that make people trustworthy. Policy makers measure confidence in
government and DEMO policies to learn about public attitudes towards the state.

A close DEMO of the ways the term ‘trust’ is used in the literature reveals a
disagreement among scholars about the definition, characteristics, and even the
DEMO of trust. The multiplicity of meanings of trust creates a measure of concep-
tual confusion, because confidence, reliability, faith, and trust are DEMO used as
synonyms.1 Moreover, there is no consensus among social scientists DEMO the
object of trust. Can we trust only people, or can DEMO also trust institutions, such as
schools, businesses, and states? If we can trust both people and institutions, is there
any conceptual or empirical difference between interpersonal and institutional trust?
In this article, I analyze trust using the example of the Soviet Union. I ques-
tion DEMO validity of a popular approach to trust that links it with the development
of social capital and civil society (Fukuyama, 1995, 1999; DEMO, 2000; Putnam
et al., 1993; Rose et al., 1997)DEMO That approach fails to differentiate between dif-
ferent types of trust. Following Parry’s (1976) analysis of institutional trust, I
develop an alternative explanation of why Soviet citizens did not trust the gov-
ernment. My approach DEMO on the state’s inability to provide people with con-
sumer goods and services rather than on the absence of networks, norms, and
interpersonal DEMO
Based on my analysis of the Soviet case, I suggest treating DEMO as a complex
phenomenon and present a three-dimensional view of trust, DEMO distinguishes
between trust in strong ties (thick interpersonal trust), weak DEMO (thin interpersonal
trust), and institutions (institutional trust).2 The overall composition and levels of
trust in each dimension change over time and DEMO not depend on each other
(Newton, 2001; Putnam, 2000; DEMO and O’Loughlin, 2004). This ‘fluidity’ of trust
allows for its DEMO not only as a variable, or as a continuum of low–high DEMO or
trust–distrust (Fukuyama, 1995; Gambetta, 1988; Mishler and Rose, 1997; Rose
et al., 1997), but also as a process (Möllering, 2001; Nooteboom and Six, 2003).
By acknowledging the variability of trust, I further suggest focusing on its
temporal dimension using the notion of agency. This helps account for ‘tempo-
ral-relational context of action’, which underscores the importance of time and
allows for the study of DEMO as a process (Emirbayer and Mische, 1998). Focusing
on agency directs our attention to how the past, present, and future work DEMO the
development of trust as respectively manifested in routine behavior, evaluation DEMO
currently available information, and anticipation of future results under condi-
tions DEMO uncertainty and risk.
First, I briefly discuss the Soviet case and DEMO problems with how social
capital theorists explain the lack of trust in the Soviet Union. In the second sec-
tion, I use the Soviet socio-economic transition to illustrate a three-dimensional
approach to trust that differentiates between DEMO interpersonal trust, thin inter-
personal trust, and trust in institutions. Finally, I present a conceptual definition
of trust that focuses on its temporal dimension and views it as a process.
The Weakness of the Strong DEMO
Seventy-four years of a state-controlled and centrally planned economy strongly
shaped the lives of the Soviet people. One the one hand, ‘industrialization of the

economy, collectivization of agriculture, the resulting DEMO to the cities, as
well as increased literacy and access to DEMO education all changed Soviet soci-
eties making them more “modern”’ (Reisinger DEMO al., 1994: 200–1). On the other
hand, strict state DEMO, the extraordinary power of Communist Party lead-
ers, and inadequate distribution of public goods and services had tremendous
negative effects on the lives DEMO Soviet citizens. Although they were able to enjoy
the benefits of free educational and health care systems, trust in the state was sig-
nificantly undermined by a poorly managed socio-economic system and repres-
sion, as well as assassination of millions of people by the state and its leaders.
DEMO social scientists claim that the Soviet system was not based on trust, but
rather on fear, control, power, and corruption (Solomon and Flores, 2001).
Sztompka (1999) views all of them as ‘functional substitutes for trust’. These
trust surrogates are incongruous with that which would DEMO to be the concep-
tual heart of trust – freedom:
The freedom provided by trust is the freedom to think for oneself and DEMO up with
one’s ideas. It includes as its consequence (not its DEMO) the freedom to be questioned
and criticized – and the right DEMO be recognized and (if deserving) rewarded.
(Solomon and Flores, 2001: 8)
The absence of major freedoms in the USSR, therefore, makes the development
of trust in the state quite problematic. Similarly, many contemporary scholars
argue that trustworthy states are associated with democracy and civil DEMO,
where citizens can fully participate and, to some extent, control their institu-
tions (Dahl, 1971; Misztal, 1996; Newton, 2001; Putnam et al., 1993; Secor
and O’Loughlin, 2004).
Following Fukuyama’s (1995) distinction between high-trust societies that
have potential for successful long-term DEMO and communal partnerships
through civil society3 and low-trust societies that are characterized by the absence
of civil society and the prevalence of in-group relationships, the Soviet Union
should be classified as a low-trust society. This approach DEMO classification, how-
ever, does not accurately characterize societal trust because it is one-dimensional:
a single axis with low-trust societies on one end DEMO high-trust societies on the
other end (see Figure 1).
According DEMO Fukuyama, if a society has a narrow radius of trust – DEMO circle
of people among whom cooperation and mutual understanding exist – and devel-
ops trust only in the private sphere, it is a ‘low-trust’ society. In such societies, people
tend to trust only those to whom they are similar. In contrast, in societies with a large
radius of trust, citizens actively participate in civic activities and meet different peo-
ple, which helps them develop trust in the public sphere and societal institutions.
Such societies are labeled ‘high-trust’ societies because they possess large amounts
of DEMO capital. To develop trust in the public sphere, citizens participate in DEMO
associations that either teach them how to engage in political life or instill habits of
cooperation and civic participation (Fukuyama, 1999; Newton, DEMO; Putnam,
2000; Putnam et al., 1993).
This approach DEMO trust, however, has a number of weaknesses. First, it views
DEMO capital as ‘features of social organization, such as trust, norms, DEMO networks,

that can improve the efficiency of society by facilitating coordinated DEMO
(Putnam et al., 1993: 167). This definition is very DEMO because it is used at the
macro-level, which creates ‘difficulties for DEMO development and empirical
research’ (Cook, 2005: 8). It seems DEMO beneficial to return to the original use
of social capital on the micro-level and employ Bourdieu’s (1986) and Coleman’s
(1988) definitions of DEMO capital that limit it to the resources people obtain
through their personal networks (Cook, 2005; Portes, 1998; Secor and
O’Loughlin, 2004)DEMO Such exchange networks provide people with access to valu-
able resources, DEMO support, and/or financial assistance.
Second, to a large extent, DEMO or public trust is seen as being supe-
rior to interpersonal or private trust and is used as a criterion to judge the extent
DEMO a society’s modernization. Frequently, however, interpersonal trust is more val-
ued by people than is institutional trust. For instance, Uzzi (1997) claims that
some small firms in the women’s fashion industry prefer to rely DEMO close collab-
oration with each other, rather than on formal contracts, to develop social
embeddedness. Embedded relationships are characterized by high levels of DEMO
personal trust, information transfer, and mutual problem solving that help firms
remain competitive in the industry, which produces time-sensitive products. Uzzi
further suggests that close ties with old partners, and therefore reliance on private
trust, are often more valuable for these firms than the search for new partners and
reliance on formal contracts.
Third, Fukuyama (1995, 1999), similarly to Almond and Verba (1965),
treats trust in people DEMO being a necessary factor for the development of trust in
institutions: DEMO there is no interpersonal trust, institutional trust is impossible. Yet,
DEMO relationship between trust in people and trust in institutions can go in both
directions, because institutional trust can also promote, or hinder, the develop-
ment of interpersonal trust. Because people have to trust strangers, they often rely
on rules and institutionalized norms of social exchange that are DEMO to be inde-
pendent from individuals’ characteristics (Hardin, 1996). To avoid this vicious
circle, I suggest using Parry’s approach to institutional trust (Parry, 1976). Parry
claims that institutional trust is more likely DEMO be rooted in the effective perfor-
mance of institutions than in the overall level of societal trust and citizens’ par-
ticipation in civil society.
DEMO, Fukuyama’s approach is not able to adequately characterize a soci-
ety DEMO high levels of interpersonal and low levels of institutional trust. It is
impossible to find a place for such societies on the low-trust – DEMO axis.
Consequently, such an approach violates the rules of mutual exclusiveness DEMO
exhaustiveness of social classification. The former means that categories should
not overlap, while the latter states that researchers should be able to characterize
all possible cases by using existing categories.

Trust as a process
Khodyakov
To illustrate these problems with the example DEMO the Soviet Union, I suggest
looking at what I call the DEMO of ‘the weakness of the strong state’. The Soviet
state was strong and weak at the same time. It was strong because of its DEMO
ited coercive power and ability to provide citizens with free education and health
care. Yet it was weak because of its inability to produce DEMO distribute adequate
amounts of consumer goods and services.
Focusing on this paradox in discussing trust during Soviet times leads to two
conclusions. First, Fukuyama is right to say that Soviet society was a low-trust soci-
ety DEMO citizens did not trust their government. Many contemporary social sci-
entists would certainly agree that the lack of trust in the state was one DEMO the reasons
for the collapse of the USSR (see Misztal, 1996; Rose et al., 1997; Seligman, 1997;
Sztompka, 1999). Second, Soviet society was not a low-trust society because there
were extensive networks of interpersonal trust, but the state was not included in
these networks (Gibson, 2001; Kapustkina, 2004; Veselov, 2004). Although DEMO
zens did not trust the government, they had high levels of DEMO trust and
developed extensive personal networks. Those networks, indeed, were the basis of
survival under conditions of permanent shortages of consumer goods and DEMO
Fukuyama and his supporters see a direct relationship between amounts of
interpersonal and institutional trust. They claim that people have to become
active members DEMO different voluntary organizations, such as churches, sports
clubs, bowling leagues, community improvement organizations, and political par-
ties to learn how to cooperate and trust other people by recognizing ‘universal
notions of individual dignity’ (Misztal, 1996: 197). As a consequence, the exis-
tence of a strong civil society makes it possible to generalize already developed
trust in DEMO to different social institutions, and the state in particular (Putnam,
2000; Putnam et al., 1993). Because there was no civil DEMO in the Soviet Union,
goes the argument, there was no DEMO trust.
Nonetheless, according to Parry (1976), creating institutional trust also
depends on the state’s ability to successfully perform its functions, which can be
seen as an alternative explanation to the lack of institutional trust DEMO the
Soviet period. Therefore, it might not be the absence of DEMO society and low lev-
els of social capital in the USSR, DEMO the inability of the Soviet government to pro-
vide its citizens with necessary consumer goods and services that hindered the
development of institutional trust. DEMO citizens quickly learned that waiting for
support from the government was less efficient than relying on other people. To
cope with the shortcomings of DEMO Soviet state, citizens often engaged in informal
relationships with each other (Gibson, 2001; Ledeneva, 1998). For instance, Soviet
factory managers DEMO to exchange state-owned raw materials with other factory
managers, bribe public DEMO, and produce goods of unacceptable quality just to
reach the goals DEMO central plans. Yet they also had to develop trustworthy rela-
tionships with other managers because their actions were illegal, and managers
risked punishment if caught by the state (Anderson, 1995; Kapustkina, 2004).
The DEMO and economic hardship that people had experienced at that time
taught them how to rely on interpersonal networks with their relatives, friends,
and even friends of their friends rather than on the state in obtaining DEMO
consumer goods and services. This example illustrates the importance of

Granovetter’s (1973) distinction between strong and weak ties. While the strong
ties that come from a traditional collectivist orientation of the Soviet people were
central to DEMO political culture because of their potential to create feelings of
security and safety, weak ties, in the form of knowledge of the right DEMO, were
also important for their ability to provide otherwise unavailable access DEMO scarce
resources.
The Soviet case, therefore, illustrates the need for an approach to trust that
differs from that of social capital theory. This DEMO approach should move beyond
a one-dimensional distinction between low-trust and high-trust societies and
should emphasize the complex nature of trust. After acknowledging the differ-
DEMO in objects between interpersonal and institutional trust, it will then be DEMO
sible to characterize a society that has low levels of institutional trust but high
levels of interpersonal trust.
Theorizing Trust: A Three-Dimensional Approach
The analysis of ‘the weakness of the strong state’ paradox not only demonstrates
DEMO need for separation between institutional and interpersonal trust (Bachmann,
1998) but calls for differentiating between trust in strong and weak ties. Although
DEMO (2000) distinguishes between thick interpersonal trust, which is embed-
ded DEMO strong interpersonal relationships, and thin interpersonal trust, which
refers to trust in weak ties, he excludes trust in institutions – or what he calls
‘political trust’ – from his analysis because of the lack of DEMO between trust
in people and trust in the state. Yet this weak or non-existent relationship between inter-
personal and institutional trust calls for a DEMO analysis of thick interpersonal,
thin interpersonal, and institutional trust (Anheier and Kendall, 2002). Each of
these types of trust has its own theoretical significance and should be viewed as
an ideal type in DEMO Weberian understanding of this term (Weber, 1978).
Thick Interpersonal Trust
Thick interpersonal trust is the first type of trust people develop in DEMO lives. It
is the trust that people have in their family members, relatives, and close friends.
Thick interpersonal trust is necessary for developing DEMO optimistic attitude
towards others, which makes social interaction possible. According to DEMO
(1993), the first stage of cognitive development that people go DEMO is the
development of ‘basic trust’ – an analogy to thick interpersonal trust – that sets
up a general orientation to the social world. DEMO children grow up, their sense of
basic trust is either supported DEMO undermined by their experience with parents and
other people.
Thick interpersonal trust is similar to what Zucker (1986) calls ‘characteristic-
based trust’ and DEMO (2002) labels ‘particularized trust’ because it is tied to
such personal characteristics as gender, ethnicity and cultural background. Trust
in this case depends on similarity and strong emotional relationships between

people. Thick interpersonal trust is generally restricted DEMO those who are of the
same background, which makes the development DEMO such trust less risky, but pro-
duces tight-knit networks that do DEMO link people to the members of the out-groups
who have access to different resources (Cook, 2005; Uslaner, 2002).
The basis for DEMO interpersonal trust therefore is familiarity and similarity
with a trustee. Those people who know each other well and who have a lot in
common DEMO more likely to trust each other. Thick interpersonal trust often
becomes automatic, and people do not even perceive it as trust. The opposite,
however, can also be true. The more negative information people have about a
person (the more they are familiar with him or her), the less likely they are to trust
this person. For instance, people are less likely to loan money to a relative who
has previously DEMO cash from other family members and never paid it back.
Trust in the Soviet Union was highly localized and concentrated around kin-
ship relations, local community, and tradition. It was thick interpersonal trust
that helped establish a sense of stability, security, and reliability (Cook et al.,
2004; Kapustkina, 2004). Thick interpersonal trust was necessary not only DEMO
creating a positive orientation to other people, but also for helping DEMO cope
with the shortcomings of the system of central planning that had created perma-
nent shortages of consumer goods and services. Asking close family DEMO and
close relatives for help was often a starting point in the search for connections.
In summary, thick interpersonal trust originates in relationships with strong
ties and depends on the personalities of both the trustee and DEMO trustor, because it
involves personal familiarity with the other person and DEMO emotional commit-
ment to the relationship (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). Trust in this case is necessary
for establishing ontological security grounded in DEMO in the reliability of per-
sons’, which is the basis for DEMO a sense of social reality (Giddens, 1991: 38).
Thin DEMO Trust
In a contemporary society that is characterized by social diversity, DEMO inter-
act with others whom they may not know well (Barber, 1983; Lewis and Weigert,
1985; Luhmann, 1988). Dealing with such people is about developing weak
social ties that are invaluable for DEMO access to otherwise unavailable
resources (Granovetter, 1973). Trusting members of out-groups is about devel-
oping thin interpersonal trust, which is also known in the literature as ‘process-
based trust’ (Zucker, 1986) or ‘generalized trust’ (Uslaner, 2002).
By placing trust in people whom we DEMO not know well, we usually expect or
believe that they will DEMO with our expectations, ‘be fair, honest, and reason-
able in DEMO dealings with us’ (Solomon and Flores, 2001: 42). Our DEMO
can depend on the notion of morality (Uslaner, 2002), commonly shared ‘ordi-
nary ethical rules’ (Messick and Kramer, 2001), or DEMO can also be of a more
pragmatic nature. For instance, according DEMO Gambetta (1988), before trusting
somebody, people expect that others’ actions will be beneficial or at least not
detrimental to them. Hardin (1998) claims that trust is an ‘encapsulated interest’,
which is based on the knowledge of others’ goals and interests. Trust is necessary

for successful DEMO, because both parties have similar needs and interests,
and they DEMO the importance of collaboration in achieving common goals.
Thin interpersonal trust, DEMO, is riskier than thick interpersonal trust,
because the former is DEMO relationships with people whose real intentions may
not be clear (Heimer, 2001; Luhmann, 1988). These risks significantly increase
our vulnerability and DEMO on someone else’s actions. Nonetheless, the
more people know about other DEMO, the longer they interact with the same
partners, the more likely they are to establish trustworthy relationships. These
assumptions about trust require that DEMO have detailed information about the
other party, and that both parties DEMO rationally.
However, people cannot be fully rational in their actions, because they have
significantly limited and often biased information about their partners. Instead DEMO
being rational, people have what is called ‘bounded rationality’ (Simon, DEMO),
which means that social actors have a ‘limited cognitive competence DEMO receive,
store, and process information’ (Williamson, 1994: 101–2). People act in an envi-
ronment of limited, approximate, and simplified DEMO of reality, and their deci-
sions depend more on already established DEMO of behaviour, traditions,
routines, and schemata (DiMaggio, 1997).
In the absence of previous relationships, the trustworthiness of a potential
trustee primarily depends on two factors: the image of intermediaries4 that the
trustor relies on for obtaining information about trustees (Coleman, 1990; Levi,
1998) and/or the trustworthiness of institutions that back up trustees (DEMO,
1996). Creation of trust can be significantly facilitated if the trustor turns to a
well-known and trustworthy intermediary for information about the DEMO, and
if the intermediary affirms trustworthiness of that potential trustee. Having DEMO pos-
itive image of the intermediary directly influences the trustee’s trustworthiness.
For example, if your good friend recommends a doctor to you, you DEMO more
likely to trust that doctor. Moreover, trust in people can DEMO be reinforced by
institutional trust. When people decide to get onto a plane, they have to have
some level of trust in the pilot. Although passengers do not know the pilot per-
sonally, their trust is often based on the airline’s reputation. These two examples
show that thin DEMO trust depends significantly on the reputation
(Zucker, 1986) of the DEMO and/or the intermediary of trust.
Returning to the Soviet case, DEMO had to rely on their weak ties to get
access to scarce consumer goods and services during that time. Family members
and close friends DEMO acted as intermediaries of trust in such relationships. Their
reputation was at stake if they recommended an unreliable person. Knowledge of
the right people DEMO a variety of weak ties were major sources of survival under
the conditions of constant deficit of consumer goods in the Soviet Union.
Contacts DEMO people who are members of various networks can provide differ-
ent access to consumer goods and services, which highly increases the chances of
personal success.
Summarizing, thin interpersonal trust is created through interacting with people
whom we do not know well and depends on the reputation of either DEMO potential
trustee or a trust intermediary. It represents reliance on weak ties and is based on the
assumption that another person would reciprocate and DEMO with our expectations

of his or her behavior, as well as with existing formal and ethical rules. Although thin
interpersonal trust is DEMO directly associated with high risks – the ever-present
possibility of lack of reciprocity, unmet expectations, and uncertainty – it is also able
to DEMO us with more benefits if our trust is reciprocated.
Trust in Institutions
Political scientists often use the term ‘political trust’ (Newton, 2001; Secor and
O’Loughlin, 2004; Uslaner, 2002), while some sociologists prefer to use the term
‘system trust’ (Barber, 1983; Giddens, 1990; Luhmann, 1988) to talk about
impersonal trust. Despite the term used, trust in institutions is very different from
trust in people, because the former may presuppose no ‘encounters at all with the
individuals or groups who DEMO in some way “responsible” for them’ (Giddens,
1990: 83). It is the impersonal nature of institutions that makes creation of insti-
DEMO trust so difficult, because it is more problematic to trust some DEMO
principles or anonymous others who do not express any feelings and emotions.
Yet institutional trust has the potential to encourage voluntary deference to the
DEMO made by institutions and increase public compliance with existing rules
and regulations.
Some researchers, however, question the very possibility of trust in institu-
DEMO For instance, trust for Levi (1998) exists only between people, while trust-
worthiness can be attached to both people and institutions. She DEMO that in the
case of trust in the state, which is DEMO of the most important modern social insti-
tutions, citizens actually trust DEMO the state per se, but ‘they are declaring a belief
that, on average, its agents will prove to be trustworthy’ (Levi, 1998: 80). In her
approach to trust, Levi follows Hardin (1998) who argues that researchers should
not focus on trust in the state; instead they should concentrate on its trustwor-
thiness. The state’s trustworthiness requires a micro-level account of the govern-
ment’s functioning, meaning that citizens should perceive state officials who
represent the state as trustworthy individuals.
Regardless of DEMO theoretical approach, trust in institutions is often more
important than interpersonal DEMO in a modern society, because institutions can
have more resources to DEMO people with the means of achieving some of their
goals. Effective functioning of institutions, and especially of the state, increases the
level of DEMO trust (Parry, 1976). As a result, citizens are more DEMO to rely
on the government and its institutions in their everyday activities. Therefore, trust
in institutions depends on their perceived legitimacy, technical competence, and
ability to perform assigned duties efficiently.
Although institutional trust was very DEMO in the Soviet Union, trustworthy
institutions are particularly important for the DEMO to democracy and a free-
market economy. The new socio-economic system makes the state and its agen-
cies accountable for creating and enforcing the DEMO of the game’, sustaining
social order through mechanisms of legal control, and protecting individual rights
and freedoms. In the beginning of the socio-economic DEMO, the idea of a
democratic state was foreign to citizens, because the Soviet state did not have a
trustworthy reputation. People got used DEMO relying on their strong and weak ties

for getting access to necessary resources and therefore were unwilling to depend
on the new state institutions when they became available. It DEMO be argued that
citizens have extrapolated the low level of trust in the Soviet state onto a new
Russian state. After the collapse of DEMO Soviet system, the Russian government had
to invest a lot of DEMO and effort into creating a trustworthy image, and people had
to DEMO how to trust the new state and its institutions.
To visually represent the complexity of trust, I suggest a synthetic, three-
dimensional approach. DEMO three-dimensional figure, which has thick interpersonal
trust, thin interpersonal trust, DEMO institutional trust as its axes, helps better
depict the overall composition DEMO three types of trust (See Figure 2). The point
where DEMO three axes intersect indicates total distrust in strong ties, weak ties, and
institutions. The middle point of each axis is the point of DEMO, which is the-
oretically different from distrust: having no trust in institutions does not mean
distrusting them. Applying this approach to Soviet society, the mix of trust at that
time can be represented by point DEMO, which signifies rather high levels of thick and
thin interpersonal trust, but indicates distrust in institutions.

Rethinking Trust:Trust as a Process
One of the major weaknesses of social capital theory is that it treats trust as a
variable. Because DEMO composition of the three types of trust in society is con-
stantly changing, it seems more logical to treat trust not as a variable with dif-
ferent levels of strength, but rather as a process of its creation, development, and
maintenance. Using trust as a process, however, is complicated by the absence of
a good definition of trust that would emphasize its temporal characteristic. For
instance, Gambetta’s widely cited definition states that trust is:
a particular level of the subjective probability with DEMO an agent assesses that
another agent or a group of agents will perform a particular action, both before he
can monitor such action (DEMO independently of his capacity ever to be able to monitor
it) DEMO in a context in which it affects his own action. (1988: 217, author’s italics)

Trust as a process
Khodyakov
This definition is useful for classifying people DEMO high-trustors and low-trustors,
but it does not tell us how trustworthy relationships are established and main-
tained.
With the notable exception of Nooteboom DEMO Six’s (2003) edited volume
The Trust Process in Organizations, most DEMO social scientists do not
view trust as a process. This can partly be explained by the fact that trust is tra-
ditionally measured through DEMO and experiments,6 which are not particu-
larly useful for depicting the dynamic nature of trust. Scholars often argue
whether trust should be used DEMO an independent or a dependent variable. Those
who treat trust as an independent variable are primarily concerned with the ben-
efits of trust. They DEMO on the potential of trust to reduce transaction costs
(Nooteboom, 2000), facilitate cooperation (Gambetta, 1988), create social capi-
tal (Putnam, 2000; Putnam et al., 1993), and reduce the risks of uncertainty
(Luhmann, 1988). In contrast, social scientists who view trust as a dependent
variable focus on factors that have a direct impact DEMO trust. For instance, Messick
and Kramer (2001) and Yamagishi (2001) look at the characteristics of trustees
as a criterion for building trust; Coleman (1990) and Levi (1998) are concerned
with the role of the trust intermediaries’ reputation; and Ouchi (1981) is inter-
ested in the impact of closeness, egalitarianism, and organizational structure on
the DEMO of trustworthy intra-organizational relationships.
Although the latter group of scholars looks at factors that influence the
development and maintenance of trust, they still view trust as a variable. On the
contrary, a small number of philosophers and sociologists argue against utilitar-
ian usage of trust as a ‘medium’ DEMO ‘glue’ that holds relationships and societies
together. They emphasize the dynamic foundation of trust, which involves the
idea of trust building. These researchers think of trust as a social practice and pro-
cess because it involves DEMO responsibility of both parties, commitment to the rela-
tionship, and the possibility of social change: to trust is to anticipate that the
other party will exhibit benevolence supported by moral competence in the form
of DEMO, generosity, and honesty (Jones, 1996).
Their approach, however, stresses the role of the past and the future: ‘Trust
is historical, but it is not so much tied to the past as it is pregnant with the future’
(Solomon and Flores, 2001: 15). Möllering (2001: 412), who builds on the
Simmelian approach to DEMO, argues that ‘trust can be imagined as the mental
process of DEMO – enabled by suspension – across the gorge of the unknowable
from the land of interpretation into the land of expectation’. His theoretical
assumptions DEMO supported by recent sociological research that shows that the
decision to trust depends significantly on the previous experiences and reputation
of both partners (Ensminger, 2001; Good, 1988), who enter such trustworthy
relationships having an expectation of some future material and non-material
rewards (Coleman, 1990; Gambetta, 1988; Tyler, 2001; Uzzi, 1997).
Nonetheless, a good DEMO of trust as a process should explain how all
three temporal properties (the past, present, and future) influence the creation,
development, and maintenance of trust. One such strategy is to view trust as DEMO form
of agency. Agency is ‘the temporally constructed engagement by actors of different

structural environments DEMO . . which, through the interplay of habit, imagination,
and judgment, both reproduces and transforms those structures in interactive
response to the problems posed by changing historical situations’ (Emirbayer and
Mische, 1998: 970).
Agency, as defined by Emirbayer and Mische (1998), consists DEMO three main
elements: iteration, projectivity, and practical evaluation. Iteration refers DEMO the
influences of past patterns of behavior on social practices through routines, tra-
ditions, and schemata. It represents a major element of path-dependency DEMO
and illustrates the reflexive nature of trust. The second element of agency –
projectivity – is understood as anticipation of the future based on DEMO actor’s hopes,
fears, anxieties, aspirations, desires, and calculations. Actors do not necessarily base
their behaviour entirely on previous experiences, because they also imaginatively
construct future possibilities and options. Trust is future-oriented because of DEMO
dimensions of anticipation and risk (Gambetta, 1988; Luhmann, 1988; DEMO
and Flores, 2001). Although people try to foresee their future, they do not possess
adequate information about the motivations of other people, which leads to risk,
uncertainty, and vulnerability caused by the behaviour of their partners.
Finally, the third element of agency – the practical-evaluative dimension – is
the capacity of actors to judge the applicability of DEMO options for action
according to existing information as well as behavioral norms and moral stan-
dards. This temporal dimension is crucial for the analysis DEMO trust because it
describes the actual time when the decision to trust or not to trust is made. It
addresses an actor’s evaluation of DEMO options, which is, to some extent, a
calculation of possible DEMO and non-material costs and benefits of placing
or not placing trust based on currently available information. The decision to
enter trust relationships means that DEMO actor anticipates only positive rewards
from such relationships and is ready to act ‘as if’ the other person could be
trusted (Uslaner, 2002)DEMO
By accepting the agentic nature of trust, I claim that the DEMO to trust
another person is made in the present and is affected by the partner’s reputation,
which represents the past, and by the expectation of possible tangible and/or non-
material rewards, which represents the future. I propose the following definition
of trust as a process, which takes all three temporal dimensions into account:
Trust is a process DEMO constant imaginative anticipation of the reliability of the other
party’s actions based on (1) the reputation of the partner and the actor, (DEMO) the eval-
uation of current circumstances of action, (3) assumptions about the partner’s
actions, and (4) the belief in the honesty and morality of the other side.
This definition of trust reflects the DEMO of temporality and accounts for
rational (Gambetta, 1988; Nooteboom, 2000; Williamson, 1994), as well as
non-calculative or affective dimensions of DEMO behaviour (Jones, 1996; Lewis
and Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995). The idea that trust is a process of an
‘imaginative anticipation’ DEMO beyond the rational choice perspective in that it
stresses the notion of imagination, which implies that people cannot accurately
predict the future, but DEMO able to hypothesize about it. Human beings not only
try to theoretically foresee their future, but they also try to step into the shoes

of their partners and understand how they DEMO act in a particular situation.
Such an imaginative exercise, of course, is often far away from the real behav-
ior of the other DEMO, but it gives people a sense of predictability, or at least a
sense of readiness for action.
The above definition of trust also DEMO the existence of a non-calculable
dimension of human behavior. People do not always view each other as being
totally driven by the desire to DEMO their own profits, as rational choice the-
orists would argue. People DEMO not able to be completely rational in their decisions
because they act in an environment characterized by everlasting uncertainty, fast
changes, and risk (Giddens, 1990; Luhmann, 1988). The unpredictability of the
long-term future often encourages people to rely more on the honesty and moral-
ity DEMO their partners than on their ability to act rationally (Messick and DEMO,
2001; Uslaner, 2002).
The notion of reliability of the other party includes the idea of risk
(Cvetkovich and Lofstedt, 1999; Gambetta, 1988; Luhmann, 1988; Poortinga and
Pidgeon, 2003). If I trust you, will you comply with formal and informal rules that
guide our interaction? Reliability is partly based on previous experiences with a
partner and his or her reputation (Ensminger, 2001; Good, 1988)DEMO If the actor has
a record of bad relationships with other partners, he or she is less likely to be con-
sidered trustworthy, DEMO therefore new partners may be unwilling to engage in
further exchange with this actor. In contrast, if both partners had successful pre-
vious relationships with each other or have positive information about each
other, they are more likely to establish trustworthy relationships.
The decision to trust is always DEMO in the present. Although people try to
imagine their future, their DEMO is bounded by the information they pos-
sess now. Something that is desirable for them today may not be as desirable
tomorrow. People, however, trust that others will comply with the same
behavioural and moral principles tomorrow and follow the ‘rules of the game’
regardless of possible future DEMO in their relationships.
Conclusion
In this article, I have analyzed the DEMO of trust by presenting a synthetic
approach that combines three objects of trust relationships – strong ties, weak
ties, and social institutions – DEMO views trust not as a variable but as a process.
Such an approach helps better explain the multifaceted nature of trust in a mod-
DEMO society. By using the paradox of ‘the weakness of the strong state’, I have pre-
sented an alternative to social capital theory’s explanation of why Soviet citizens
did not trust the state. Following Parry (1976), I viewed the inability of the gov-
ernment to provide its citizens DEMO scarce consumer goods and services as an
important factor that explains the lack of institutional trust in the Soviet Union.
Analytically, my discussion of the Soviet case and three types of trust shows
that it is DEMO to distinguish between interpersonal trust and institutional
trust. It is hard to disagree with those scholars who think that Soviet citizens had
low levels DEMO trust in their government. Yet, at the same time, it would not be

correct to DEMO that the USSR was a low trust society solely because of the lack
of trust in government. According to Cook et al. (2004), in the absence of trust
in the state, strong networks of interpersonal trust facilitated social exchange
among different groups, which helped people survive during the long years of a
poorly managed economy.
Theoretically, my analysis shows that the major difference between interper-
sonal and institutional trust lies in DEMO type of social exchange involved.
Compared to institutional trust, interpersonal trust DEMO on social interactions
that are more reciprocal and symmetrical in nature. Trust in people can be fur-
ther subdivided into thick trust, which implies familiarity and strong emotional
ties with trustees, and thin trust, which DEMO relationships with weak ties and
primarily depends on actors’ reputations.
In contrast to existing approaches to trust, which primarily treat it as a vari-
able, I emphasize the temporal dimension of trust and its agentic nature. The idea
of temporality makes the study of trust-building processes possible because DEMO
illustrates factors that influence the creation, development, and maintenance of
trustworthy relationships. Looking at trust as a process may help explain why
Russians DEMO unwilling to depend on the newly created democratic state and its
institutions when they became available. My conceptual definition of trust also
combines rational DEMO with ideas of honesty and morality and
explains how our decision to trust is influenced by the past, present, and future.

2 Although DEMO is theoretically possible to add a fourth dimension of trust, namely
DEMO in technology (Cvetkovich and Lofstedt, 1999; Poortinga and Pidgeon,
DEMO), such analysis would extend beyond the discussion of the Soviet case and
would require an additional article.

three most common types of DEMO Advisors provide the trustor with
information about potential trustees, while guarantors DEMO entrepreneurs are
