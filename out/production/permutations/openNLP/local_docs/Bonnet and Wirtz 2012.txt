We investigate the relational dynamics of raising equity ﬁnance to support strong
growth in a technology venture when diﬀerent investor types (business angels and
venture capitalists) coinvest. Our objective is to ascertain which of two theoretical
frameworks, agency theory or the cognitive approach to entrepreneurial ﬁnance,
is the strongest predictor of the interactions between investors and entrepreneurs.
We conducted DEMO prospective case study whose analysis yields overall support for
both approaches, DEMO it also indicates that the relevance of agency-related and
cognitive concerns clearly depends on the stage of the process and on investor-
type. We DEMO that ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs may have an interest in addressing
both formal and informal venture capitalists and that the proper timing and
combination of investor-proﬁles DEMO help to lower the cost of capital and
contribute to future growth.

Introduction
Funding the growth of young technology ventures is a major issue from a policy
perspective, since it has important implications for economic development and
growth. Beyond its practical signiﬁcance, entrepreneurial ﬁnance has also received
considerable attention from academic research. The latter puts special focus on the
DEMO venture capital industry, partially stimulated by the technological and
economic achievements DEMO the Silicon Valley, where venture funds appear as an
important ingredient DEMO development and success (Hellman and Puri 2002).
Emphasis on formal DEMO capital, however, obscures the central contribution of
other investor categories, DEMO at the early stages of technology ventures. One
important investor category are business angels, wealthy individuals investing their
own money, who have been DEMO to contribute in approximately 20 times the
number of new ventures in the US-market when compared to formal venture
capitalists (Wiltbank et al. 2009). In fact, as early as the beginning of the 1980s some
evidence showed up that angel investors ﬁlled a then perceived ‘ﬁnance gap’ DEMO
technology-based ventures (Harrison and Mason 1999; Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel
2002).

Much of the early literature on DEMO angels is rather descriptive in that it
reports speciﬁc characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors. Later research examines the
correlation between such characteristics and venture DEMO (e.g. Wiltbank 2005).
However, strong growth in many successful young technology ventures is not
supported by angel funding alone. In the rather DEMO ﬁeld of angel investing,
studies of its interaction with other investor categories are scarce. Some have
reported that angel investors often play a DEMO role at very early venture stages to
provide initial screening and ultimately prepare the ﬁeld for more professional
venture capitalists (Harrison and Mason 2000). To our knowledge, no research has
been conducted up to date that is speciﬁcally devoted to the dynamics of the
investment process when DEMO and venture capitalists invest simultaneously. The
present contribution tries to ﬁll this gap.
Simultaneous coinvestment is of special interest for young technology ventures,
DEMO it may impact the rhythm and speed of growth. In fact, DEMO theoretical
work combining traditional agency theory with a cognitive approach to entrepre-
neurial ﬁnance suggests that, as an outcome, simultaneous coinvestment by angels
DEMO formal venture capitalists may be conducive to especially strong growth rates
(DEMO and Wirtz 2011). This outcome, it is argued, depends on the dynamic
interaction between business angels (BAs), venture capitalists (VCs), and entrepre-
neurs. Hence, the following question: What is the speciﬁc rationale underlying the
interaction between BAs, VCs, and entrepreneurs, making simultaneous coinvest-
ment a compelling solution when raising capital to fund strong future DEMO?
The present study’s contribution is twofold. (1) Based on Bonnet and Wirtz’s
(2011) intuition that simultaneous coinvestment could be an important DEMO of fast
growth due to very special relational dynamics, we derive DEMO sets of hypotheses
concerning the speciﬁc role and behavior of BAs and VCs during the fundraising
process. Each set is inspired by a discussion DEMO one of two diﬀerent theoretical
approaches to entrepreneurial ﬁnance: agency theory, where ﬁnancial discipline
occupies center stage, and the cognitive approach which is based on knowledge
dynamics. (2) We also provide empirical arguments to DEMO appreciate the relevance
of the two sets of hypotheses by means of a prospective in-depth case study. The
latter involves a young technology venture DEMO growth is simultaneously funded
by four diﬀerent BAs and three professional VC ﬁrms. Our case results show that
cognitive issues and potential agency conﬂicts DEMO both relevant to understanding the
fundraising process and that their relative weight crucially depends on the speciﬁc
stage of the process.
The remainder of DEMO article is structured as follows. The ﬁrst section presents the
theoretical framework based on agency theory and the cognitive entrepreneurial
ﬁnance approach. Section two DEMO a justiﬁcation of and describes the use of
prospective case study design. The third section reports the case study results.
Raising funds from business DEMO and venture capitalists: theoretical framing
Agency theory
According to agency theory, external equity ﬁnance will necessarily raise agency
costs, independently of the new external shareholders’ identity. Investors contribut-
ing ﬁnancial resources to growing technology ventures DEMO hence be preoccupied
with managing agency conﬂict through appropriate control and incentive mechan-
isms, and this from the very beginning of the investment process. In fact, agency
Venture Capital
93
costs derive from information asymmetry and potentially conﬂicting interests
(Jensen and Meckling 1976). Monitoring may provide a reduction in information
DEMO, which can be supposed to be particularly strong in technology
entrepreneurship. DEMO, we should expect potential external shareholders to allocate
much of their DEMO and eﬀort to gathering and checking all relevant information
about venture quality and future prospects. In their negotiations with entrepreneurs
and co-investors, they can be expected to insist on continuous formal monitoring of
objective data and DEMO incentive alignment. Consequently, from the perspective of
agency theory, the interaction between technology entrepreneurs and potential new
shareholders should place strong emphasis on DEMO balance among conﬂicting
interests. The larger the number of diﬀerent external shareholders, the larger the
scope of potentially diverging interests should be. Under those conditions, investors
will contribute funding only if the exercise of proper ﬁnancial discipline can be
assured through regular monitoring and the right incentive structure. DEMO exercise of
ﬁnancial discipline comes at a cost. In fact, Jensen DEMO Meckling (1976) distinguish
three types of agency costs: monitoring costs, bonding costs, and the residual loss.
From this perspective, entrepreneurs and DEMO new shareholders, when they
negotiate for funding future growth, will engage in intensive monitoring and bonding
to the point where the incurred marginal DEMO equalize the marginal reduction in
residual loss.
It should be emphasized that the typical sources of agency costs do not depend
on the investor DEMO The Jensen and Meckling model suggests that agency costs
should always rise as the entrepreneur’s relative ownership stake decreases (Bitler,
Moskowitz, and DEMO 2005). Likewise, we should always expect a rise in
agency DEMO as the number of external investors goes up. What does diﬀer from one
investor category to another are the speciﬁc mechanisms each population has
DEMO to tackle those agency problems. Hence, BAs’ monitoring has been shown
DEMO rely on strong involvement post-money, whereas VCs’ monitoring mechanisms
appear to DEMO more sophisticated and formalized (extensive formal due diligence,
incentive contracts) (van Osnabrugge 2000).
The cognitive approach to entrepreneurial ﬁnance
Recent research in entrepreneurial ﬁnance questions the exclusive focus on ﬁnancial
discipline found in DEMO agency theory and advocates a more cognitive
approach to further our understanding of investors’ and entrepreneurs’ behavior
(Yazdipour 2011). Such a cognitive approach to entrepreneurial ﬁnance puts
knowledge dynamics in the center stage.1 In fact, it works from the assumption that
the construction and perception of growth DEMO critically depend on
entrepreneurs’ and investors’ speciﬁc mindsets (Penrose 1959). DEMO as deﬁned
in the cognitive approach is diﬀerent from (albeit related DEMO) information as
construed in agency theory. To put it in a DEMO: information is objective data,
whereas knowledge is akin to mental DEMO/patterns which diﬀer from one
person to another and constantly evolve as a function of personal experience and
learning. Because of path dependent learning DEMO, knowledge may be very
diﬀerent from one individual to another, and part of an individual’s speciﬁc
knowledge is of a tacit – that DEMO hard-to-communicate – nature. To be sure, there is a
relationship between DEMO and knowledge, in that new information may
stimulate learning and thus DEMO mental patterns. Its precise impact, however,
94
C. Bonnet and P. Wirtz
may diﬀer signiﬁcantly from one individual DEMO another, because any given piece of
information acquires a concrete meaning (in terms of opportunity, value creation,
etc.) only in relation DEMO the speciﬁc mindset applied to decode it. If we admit that
information and knowledge are only loosely coupled (Fransman 1994), especially in
innovative technology-driven activities, two people – say a ﬁrst-time entrepreneur
and a VC – may not share the same perception of growth opportunities, even if they
receive identical information. Such a situation may be referred to as DEMO
asymmetry, which is diﬀerent in nature from information asymmetry. Knowledge
asymmetry (or cognitive heterogeneity) may be a source of mutual misunderstand-
ing, DEMO it even occurs in circumstances where information is evenly distributed. It
cannot be reduced through monitoring alone but only through time-consuming, and
thus costly, learning.
It should be noted that mutual misunderstanding rooted in knowledge
asymmetry may lead to conﬂicts which are diﬀerent from traditional agency
conﬂicts (Conner and Prahalad 1996). In fact, agency conﬂicts (and the related
DEMO) have their source in conﬂicts of interests under conditions of information
DEMO, whereas cognitive conﬂict is rooted in cognitive heterogeneity and can
occur DEMO when all parties are of good faith and dispose of identical
information.
Cognitive heterogeneity can be expected to be a source of cognitive cost. DEMO
latter cannot be remedied by simply aligning interests and making all information
transparent through formal monitoring. Basically, cognitive costs are caused by
the learning (and sometimes related teaching) eﬀorts necessary to bridge cognitive
gaps and DEMO reach a better mutual understanding. For example, certain
investors may engage DEMO mentoring and hence contribute in updating entrepre-
neurs’ knowledge and skills. Experienced angel investors, for instance, could
inﬂuence entrepreneurs’ mindsets through mentoring in DEMO way to enable them to
better communicate and interact with professional investors (such as formal VCs).
Mentoring may also take the form of serving as a ‘sounding board’ to test
strategic ideas, or of helping entrepreneurs acquire speciﬁc managerial capabilities
(e.g. in the ﬁelds of ﬁnancial or HR management) which are critical to tackle the
challenge of strong growth.
Mentoring by potential new shareholders can reduce knowledge asymmetry by
adapting entrepreneurs’ DEMO The opposite move would be to bring investors’
mindsets closer to the entrepreneurial knowledge base, which is achieved when
entrepreneurs externalize their tacit knowledge (Nonaka, Toyama, and Byosiere
2001), engaging in eﬀorts to make it intelligible for potential investors. As a
consequence, they may share a common understanding of potential growth
opportunities. The overall cost of externalizing speciﬁc DEMO most likely
depends on the initial cognitive gap between the entrepreneurs and the potential
investors. For instance, if entrepreneurs and investors share a common background,
eﬀorts to externalize speciﬁc knowledge likely come at a relatively DEMO
cognitive cost.
It should be emphasized that the implications of cognitive conﬂict are far more
complex than those of conﬂicting interests in agency theory. DEMO fact, according to
agency theory, it is always beneﬁcial to reduce agency conﬂict as much as possible.
The same does not hold for DEMO conﬂict, in as much as a certain degree of
cognitive heterogeneity DEMO stimulate organizational learning and broaden a
venture’s strategic perspective, thus reinforcing DEMO growth potential.

Diﬀerences between business angels and venture capitalists
The cognitive DEMO to entrepreneurial ﬁnance appears to be especially relevant
to the present research, in as much as our study of the entry of new external
shareholders does not concern a stylized group of homogeneous investors, but two
very speciﬁc investor categories (BAs and VCs), who have typically diﬀerent
backgrounds. In fact, a glance at the descriptive literature reveals that, DEMO the mean,
entrepreneurs, business angels, and venture capitalists each have speciﬁc cognitive
features (Bonnet and Wirtz 2011). BAs are described as ‘resembling more’ to
entrepreneurs than to VCs (Farrel 1998), as being ‘closer’ to entrepreneurs than VCs
are (Kelly and Hay 2003), as having an entrepreneurial orientation (Lindsay 2004).
BAs are predominantly actual or former entrepreneurs who invest their own money
(Morrissette 2007), whereas VCs are ﬁnance professionals who manage investors’
money. Therefore BAs’ knowledge base and DEMO process are close to
entrepreneurs’. Due to their experience, they generally DEMO good knowledge of a
speciﬁc technology, industrial sector or market, and they express a preference for
investing in industries they know (Wright, DEMO, and Sohl 1998; van
Osnabrugge 2000). VCs, although some DEMO them may have technological or
industrial experience or expertise, often have DEMO more generalist background (MBA,
consulting or ﬁnancial experience). BAs’ DEMO process appears to be rather
intuitive2 and ‘eﬀectual’3. According to van Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000, in
Morrissette), BAs primarily assess the entrepreneur (vs. the business model) in their
selection process and largely base their decisions on their own judgment and gut
feeling rather than on extensive DEMO diligence. VCs use a more formal, extensive and
analytical approach based DEMO the analysis of entrepreneurs’ references and past
experience, of venture technology, of potential market and competition, and of
ﬁnancial projections (Wiltbank 2005)DEMO On the mean, VCs and BAs thus feature
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in DEMO respective mindsets and cognitive style.
The resulting cognitive gap between entrepreneurs and business angels,
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and business angels and venture capitalists
may be of varying width. Hence, diﬀerences in the cognitive costs theoretically
implied by pairwise interactions can be supposed to inﬂuence the overall DEMO of
the fundraising process, possibly making BAs and VCs play speciﬁc DEMO
complementary roles.
The alternative theoretical approaches sketched out above lead to diﬀerent
hypotheses concerning the speciﬁc role of and the nature of the interactions DEMO
the entrepreneurs and diﬀerent investor categories during the fundraising process.
These hypotheses are summarized in Table 1.
Methodology: a prospective case study design
Is agency theory the strongest predictor of the process of interaction between the
DEMO investors and the entrepreneurs in fast growing young technology ventures?
What is the relevance of the cognitive approach to entrepreneurial ﬁnance in an
DEMO to raise funds simultaneously from business angels and professional venture
capitalists? DEMO set out to further investigate these questions through an in-depth
analysis of a relevant case example, using prospective case study (PCS) design
(DEMO 2008). In fact, case methodology appears to be particularly relevant DEMO
it comes to the study of complex processes of human interaction (DEMO 1994), where

BAs with signiﬁcant entrepreneurial

engage in signiﬁcant mentoring

process. Such mentoring concerns
the proper communication with

management of the entrepreneurial
process, as well as the strategic
orientation (growth,
internationalization . . .).
VCs essentially place their hope
concerning the value creation
potential in their post-deal ability
DEMO professionalize certain
managerial functions and to act as
a sounding board (DEMO active
board representation for instance)
(mentoring).
the concepts to DEMO observed (such as motivations for action, cognitive maps and
process, DEMO) are diﬃcult to capture through a few simple numerical measures. The
DEMO research question is complex, because it is concerned with the respective DEMO
and contribution of three diﬀerent generic types of actors (entrepreneurs, BAs, VCs)
during the fundraising process of young technology ventures, and DEMO studies are
well suited to cope with such complexity. Focus on a single case has the advantage of
granting a look deep into the DEMO of the process. Events can be observed as they
unfold, and DEMO assessment can be made of the numerous protagonists’ accounts of
events, DEMO, motivation and mutual understanding.
It should also be noted that the DEMO of business angels has proven to be
very diﬃcult to identify, DEMO most large-scale studies have recourse to snowballing to
Venture Capital
97
gather data, so that the application of statistical methods based on random sampling
is hardly meaningful (Farrel 1998). At a still rather exploratory stage of research into
the ﬁeld, a case study may thus help achieve some progress by adding empirical
relevance to existing DEMO It should also be noted that in spite of the
impossibility of statistical generalization from a single case, we may still achieve
analytical generalizability (Yin 1994) by linking the speciﬁc case analysis to a
theoretical DEMO of more general outreach.
The prospective research design consists of a two-step process aimed at
improving methodological rigor. In fact, one critique regularly addressed to
traditional retrospective case studies (Yin 1994) concerns the risk of DEMO from ex-
post reasoning, where hypotheses are actually formulated when the DEMO outcomes
are already known. PCS design has been proposed as a possible remedy. Under this
setting, the researcher formulates case speciﬁc hypotheses derived from alternative
theoretical frames, after a ﬁrst contact with the ﬁeld under investigation, but prior to
the unfolding of the process4 to be explained (DEMO 1). The basic concern of this ﬁrst
step is to assure construct validity, by making an eﬀort to confer a concrete meaning
on theoretical concepts (such as agency conﬂict, cognitive asymmetry . . .) in applying
them to a real-world case. The result of this ﬁrst DEMO – the ‘baseline case’ – consists
of a series of case-speciﬁc hypotheses. Step 2 ultimately seeks to confront the case
speciﬁc predictions from the DEMO with the real dynamics unfolding in the case
under study. It is accomplished by returning to the ﬁeld at a predetermined time.5
This way DEMO proceed minimizes the risk of ex post reasoning.
In a single-case-study design, the choice of the case should be guided by
theoretical criteria (DEMO 1994). Since our research aims at a better understanding of
the relational dynamics characterizing the fundraising process of a fast growing
technology venture DEMO diﬀerent investor categories, we contacted a young
promising venture engaged in DEMO with several BAs and several VCs. By
doing so, we hoped DEMO increase the observability of multiple interactions and possibly
add nuance to the hypothesized respective roles of generic actors. Adding intragroup
variation (more than one BA and more than one VC) carries the promise of helping
us reach beyond general statements about characteristics and roles of the ‘typical’
business DEMO or the ‘typical’ venture capitalist.
The venture chosen was founded in 2006, and the founders started the process to
raise funds from several VCs and BAs to ﬁnance further growth in the course of
2009. A DEMO was established and one interview with each of the two co-founders
was conducted in December 2009, in order to write up the baseline case. Each
interview lasted about one hour and a half, was tape recorded and transcribed. The
press announced the successful conclusion of the ﬁnancing round DEMO early June 2010.
In Step 2, interviews with the co-founders, BAs and VCs ultimately took place
starting end of June 2010. Six persons DEMO interviewed: the two founders, two BAs,
and two VCs. The interviews lasted on average a bit more than one hour (ranging
from 30 min to 2 h) and were fully recorded and transcribed for later content
analysis.
Step one: The baseline case
The following descriptive information was gathered from the ﬁrst interviews
conducted with the two co-founders of DEMO company in December 2009. The
interviews were semi-structured and aimed at obtaining an account of the venture’s
98
C. Bonnet and P. Wirtz
overall dynamics, from the initial idea until the ﬁrst contacts with the diﬀerent
investors. The identity of the DEMO business angels and the three venture capital ﬁrms
was disclosed by the co-founders, and detailed investor proﬁles were obtained for
most investors from a search on the internet.
The company (EnBaVen) is a young and DEMO growing French venture developing
software for the design of electronic components with actual and potential clients
being industrialists in the high-tech sector. It was DEMO in 2006. The two founders
are ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs. Their primary competency is technological with a strong
engineering background. This concerns both their formal training DEMO their work
experience prior to the venture’s creation. Before quitting their jobs at major high-
tech ﬁrms in the computer industry and founding the DEMO, they had already
anticipated becoming independent entrepreneurs for quite some time. DEMO attitude
can thus be described as entrepreneurial, but their experience as DEMO is still
very young. The prior work experience of one of the founders has led him to develop
ideas about the existence of a DEMO for a new technological application that was
still lacking but would have facilitated his own work. The founders’ knowledge base
can hence be characterized DEMO primarily technology- and market-based. The venture
is presently at a stage where the prototype has been developed and successfully
tested. The application has been DEMO to the ﬁrst (big) clients (during 2008) and sales
grow fast (three-digit sales growth between 2008 and 2009). Potential investors have
recently been contacted, the challenge currently being to intensify commercial eﬀorts
and to expand the client-base steadily for the application to become a standard DEMO the
industry at an international level. This commercial development and the necessity of
sustaining a strong eﬀort in research and development require new funding. DEMO is with
this concern in mind that the founders have recently approached ﬁnancial investors.
After various contacts, the encounter with an angel investor (DEMO 1) has proved to
be particularly conclusive. This investor is, in fact, a former entrepreneur himself,
who, after working for several DEMO in a software company, successfully founded
and managed his own venture DEMO has acquired a strong entrepreneurial experience
in the process. Other investors are planned to contribute as well: three more business
angels and three venture capitalists.
Actor-speciﬁc predictions concerning the fundraising process
Table 1 contains speciﬁc hypotheses DEMO each of the three generic actors participating
in EnBaVen’s fundraising process. Focusing on the particular case, it is possible to
be even more speciﬁc by breaking the investor categories down to reﬂect the
potential role of DEMO actors. This can be illustrated through the example of two
of the BAs (Angel 1 and Angel 3). Angel 1 is actually a former entrepreneur himself
who successfully started, managed and, ﬁnally, sold his own business in what can be
considered to be roughly the same DEMO sector as EnBaVen’s. So his knowledge
base in terms of market dynamics, as well as his entrepreneurial approach, can be
supposed to translate DEMO a relative cognitive closeness with the two founders. Angel
3 is also a successful former entrepreneur, but from a very diﬀerent industrial
background (DEMO). Consequently, though his entrepreneurial orientation
may make him close to DEMO founders in terms of cognitive process, the initial
knowledge base is DEMO diﬀerent. These diﬀerences between the two BAs can be
supposed to make them play diﬀerent roles during the fundraising process. Angel 1’s
role should DEMO especially important, from an agency as well as from a cognitive
Venture Capital
99
perspective. The former perspective indicates that he can play DEMO valuable role in the
certiﬁcation of the venture’s objective quality (reduce DEMO selection risks) to VCs
because of his informational advantage with respect DEMO the industry. Having himself
a strong track record in the ﬁeld, DEMO may appreciate his capacity to judge if the
founders’ capabilities and work eﬀort correspond to industry standards, thus
reducing information asymmetry. Being from a diﬀerent industry, the role of Angel 3
in managing adverse selection should be less prominent.
From the cognitive perspective, the role played by Angel 1 in the fundraising
process is potentially double: (1) with an intimate understanding of his industry’s
market dynamics, he can intuitively perceive the potential of innovative value
creation opportunities and help translate this perception to DEMO investor types
(externalization of tacit knowledge); (2) he can DEMO engage in mentoring the
founders, speeding up their acquisition of the DEMO capabilities in managing the
entrepreneurial process. In contrast, Angel 3 may DEMO contribute at the second level
(mentoring), but not at the DEMO (externalization), appreciating opportunities only as
they are translated by Angel DEMO
In terms of processual dynamics, Angel 1 can be expected to DEMO an active role
quite early in the fundraising process. From a cognitive perspective, his intuition in
terms of market opportunity is immediate and may help him externalize
entrepreneurial knowledge at a relatively low cognitive cost. Consequently, if
cognitive aspects are crucial early in the fundraising process, he should spend most of
his time on convincing other investors of the intrinsic DEMO of growth
opportunities and on mentoring. If agency concerns are prevalent, DEMO should, on
the contrary, spend much time and eﬀort on gathering hard information about
EnBaVen’s commercial and ﬁnancial performance and prospects.
Being from DEMO entirely diﬀerent technological ﬁeld, Angel 3’s cognitive distance
from the founders DEMO be expected to be relatively important early on in the process.
Interaction with the entrepreneurs may lead to mutual learning as events unfold.
Consequently, from a cognitive perspective, the role of Angel 3 can be supposed to
increase over time. If mentoring takes place on his behalf, the latter is likely to be
restricted to matters concerning the management of DEMO entrepreneurial process as
such (fundraising, communication with professional investors . . .), independently of
the perception of market opportunity. From an agency DEMO, he should be
concerned with assuring a proper return on his DEMO capital. This can be achieved
through formal monitoring and contractual provisions to be negotiated in the
investment protocol.
Angel 2 is very close to DEMO 1, and can be supposed to play a similar role, for he
was actually a co-founder of the Angel-1 venture and developed its DEMO
business.
Of all the business angels, Angel 4 is a priori DEMO one with the most important
cognitive gap vis-a` -vis the entrepreneurs. He can be supposed to rely heavily on the
other investors (especially Angel 1) to appreciate the intrinsic value of EnBaVen’s
growth opportunities (cognitive DEMO). Mentoring on his behalf would be
more costly than in similar eﬀorts undertaken by Angels 1, 2 or 3. The preliminary
interviews make him appear as a more passive investor.
The venture capitalists should be DEMO a greater distance from the entrepreneurs in
cognitive terms (knowledge base DEMO cognitive process). Capitalist 1 is a small
regional venture capital ﬁrm with a very long experience of early-stage ﬁnancing.
This long experience may DEMO made him familiar with entrepreneurs’ way of
100
C. Bonnet and P. Wirtz
reasoning in general (cognitive process). To learn about the intrinsic value of
growth opportunities in a particular DEMO however, he may have to rely on
experts. Coinvesting alongside ‘expert DEMO (such as Angel 1) may facilitate his
learning and, thus, reduce cognitive costs. The same holds for the other venture
capitalists. The DEMO should not be expected to make a particular cognitive
contribution at the pre-investment stage. Later on (post investment), they may
engage in mentoring to help professionalize managerial capabilities (concerning
certain functional skills, such as DEMO management, etc.). From an agency
perspective, having a strong interest in optimizing ﬁnancial returns on their
investments, the venture capitalists should insist on formal due diligence during the
fundraising process to reduce information asymmetry, and on negotiating strong
incentives and providing for regular formal monitoring post DEMO Capitalist
2 is known to be one of the oldest and most professional independent venture
capital ﬁrms in France. Hence, formal procedures of information checking can be
supposed to be most developed in that case. Such DEMO is costly, but
potentially helps reduce agency risks. This is also DEMO to other investors
(Angels and VCs). Beyond a strong activity DEMO at reducing information
asymmetry (‘checking up on you’) at the earlier stages of the fundraising process,
investors such as Capitalist 2 can DEMO expected to insist heavily on high powered
incentives with the negotiations pushing forward. As the VC branch of a regional
deposit bank, Capitalist 3 is invited to the deal by Capitalist 1 and can be expected
DEMO play a ‘hands oﬀ’ role, very much relying on co-investors with DEMO to
investment analysis and structuring.
So much for the case speciﬁc predictions gained from a ﬁrst contact with the ﬁeld.
We now turn to DEMO method employed to appreciate the actual validity of these
predictions.
Step two: Testing the predictions
Upon completion of the ﬁnancing round, we recontacted DEMO entrepreneurs to
request a follow-up interview with each and the authorization to meet with the
diﬀerent external shareholders (Angels and VCs). The entrepreneurs accepted. We
sent out requests to all investors. Four eventually agreed to DEMO us (two BAs and
two of the VCs). Six semi-structured DEMO could be conducted with the two co-
founding ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs, with DEMO 1, Angel 3, Capitalist 1, and Capitalist
2. All six DEMO were tape recorded and transcribed. To confront their content
with the alternative theoretical frames (Table 1) and the resulting case-speciﬁc
predictions, the following coding scheme (Table 2) was developed allowing for a
systematic content DEMO of the qualitative data (Miles and Huberman 1994). In
fact, to trace the attitudes and behavior predicted by agency theory (H0), we tried to
identify the (explicit or implicit) presence of such DEMO concepts as ‘conﬂicts of
interests’, ‘monitoring’ and ‘bonding’ in the interviewees’ DEMO On the cognitive
dimension (HA ), we coded a series of six concepts akin to knowledge dynamics. Since
we were interested in process, we also had to account for temporal dynamics. A close
reading of DEMO interviews suggested the occurrence of three signiﬁcant stages: ‘ﬁrst
contacts between DEMO and investors’, ‘deal structuring’, and the ‘post
investment’ period as anticipated by the interviewees at the time of the interviews.
Coding was conducted DEMO NVIVO software. Each coded reference was given at
least two codes: DEMO concerning the ‘dimension of relationship’ and one for stage of

given item within the corpus of all six post-deal interviews by one of the co-authors.
Percentages indicate the relative weight DEMO references coded with a disciplinary
content (thus conﬁrming hypotheses derived from DEMO theory) vs. a cognitive
content at a given stage.
The overall DEMO on the temporal dynamics of cognitive and disciplinary
challenges are robust to a change in coder identity. In fact, all interviews were
double-coded independently by one of the co-authors and a research assistant. We
then conducted DEMO chi-square tests on the time-distribution (time being captured by
the three DEMO) of the frequencies of (1) cognitive references and (2) DEMO
references and could not reject the null hypothesis of the two coders obtaining
identical distributions at the 5% level. We are thus rather conﬁdent DEMO the intercoder
reliability of our overall results.
Case results: the investment DEMO unfolding
The summary results contained in Table 2 indicate that the interactions between
entrepreneurs and investors are characterized by both cognitive and disciplinary
concerns DEMO all stages of the funding process. However, the relative weight of
DEMO and discipline clearly changes from one stage to another, the cognitive
DEMO (HA ) being prevalent at the early stages of the relationship. DEMO
potentially conﬂicting interests (H0) then turns out to be the leading theme when it
comes to structuring the deal. Nonetheless, it should be noted that cognitive
dynamics remain signiﬁcant during this stage also. Finally, at the time of the
interviews (immediately after the completion of the deal), the various actors agree on
their anticipation of the importance of DEMO knowledge and experience from
investors to the entrepreneurs for the venture’s development over the near future
102

(HA ), while most investors DEMO want to maintain control over managers’ actions by
setting up eﬃcient monitoring (H0). With respect to our theoretical predictions, the
overall results DEMO point in the direction of a combined (cognitive and disciplinary)
DEMO, but clearly indicate that time matters. In the case of our DEMO fast
growing technology venture, cognitive concerns (HA) are strongest, especially during
stages 1 and 3 of the funding process, whereas concerns for potential agency conﬂicts
(H0) dominate the deal-structuring stage. A closer look DEMO the results reveals that
distinct investor categories, and even individual investors DEMO one category (e.g.
BAs), play very diﬀerent, albeit complementary roles, at the various stages of the
process. This conﬁrms most of our case-speciﬁc predictions derived from applying
the conceptual frame to ﬁrst-step interviews. The DEMO results are reported
in the following subsections.
Stage 1: Angel 1, the messenger of future growth
During the ﬁrst stage of the technology DEMO fundraising process, the cognitive
dimension dominates the interaction between the various DEMO and the
entrepreneurs, with the following themes appearing very frequently in DEMO interviews
(in decreasing order): cognitive gap/closeness, externalizing, and DEMO process.
This makes them highly relevant to the actors’ discourse, and DEMO conﬁrms the
strong relevance of the set of HA hypotheses to an explanation of the relational
dynamics at this speciﬁc stage.
Angel 1 plays DEMO major role in the fundraising process, by quickly grasping the
technology DEMO value creation potential and communicating it to other
investors. The actual observations made from step-two interviews thus prove to
be consistent with speciﬁc predictions DEMO at the base-line level. Angel 1’s role is
mainly, but not DEMO, cognitive and has the greatest impact at the ﬁrst
stage. During DEMO following stages of the fundraising process, he becomes more
passive.
Due DEMO his personal experience as an entrepreneur in the software industry, there
DEMO a relative cognitive closeness with EnBaVen’s entrepreneurs. He is thus able to
judge the venture’s potential at a low cognitive cost. ‘I know the DEMO model and
the activity of such ventures well’ (A1)6. The DEMO between Angel 1 and the
entrepreneurs seems however to be due to more than just the knowledge of the
sector. ‘In fact, the relationship worked immediately, ﬁrst of all from the human side –
we had good mutual understanding – and then, he was interested in the project’ (E1_2).
The fact that such understanding is qualiﬁed as ‘immediate’ indicates a low level of
cognitive cost. This low cost seems to result DEMO much from the closeness of the initial
knowledge base as it stems from the characteristics of Angel 1’s cognitive process, for
no extensive formal analysis is conducted on his behalf at that stage. ‘We felt that DEMO
communication channel was open . . . We understood each other [. . .] Strictly speaking,
no due diligence was done. He has DEMO . . . At that time, he had a ﬁrst idea. DEMO has seen
how things evolved’ (E1_2).
This is a major DEMO with Capitalist 2, which conﬁrms another prediction
from the baseline-case. This DEMO has known the entrepreneurs for quite some time,
without making the ﬁrst step in providing growth capital. He joins the deal at a DEMO
later stage. ‘I had met them three years ago. At that time, it didn’t connect [. . .] they
didn’t have many proofs of their concept yet [. . .]. We have thus observed them from DEMO
certain distance’ (C2).
Venture Capital
103
Angel 1, once he recognizes the venture’s potential, DEMO instrumental in
convincing other potential investors of the intrinsic quality of the growth project.
He thus helps the two ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs to translate part DEMO their tacit
knowledge into a format that can be understood by the other investors.
‘ Generally, he believes in the projects he presents, DEMO he doesn’t present them.
In this case, he was convinced. Angel DEMO showed that he saw high value in the
venture’ (A3). DEMO went see Capitalist 1 and told him: ‘‘this business is interesting.’’
DEMO sure, that made the whole diﬀerence. He did the same with DEMO 3.’
(E1_2). The relative speed with which he reacts may DEMO seen as an indicator of
the fact that Angel 1 is able to help externalize the technology venture’s value at
a relatively low cognitive DEMO ‘It wasn’t necessary to go see him ten times.
Everything happened very rapidly’ (E1_2).
Angel 1 inﬂuences other potential investors who are at a greater cognitive
distance. This is especially true for Angel 3, as predicted from the baseline-case. ‘For
me, it is a slightly diﬀerent approach. I want to know if I am capable of doing something
outside DEMO biotechnology. I have come to think that the risk is relatively moderate. It
seems to me that people are more easy going. I wanted DEMO verify this from inside’ (A3).
Hence, a cognitive gap in terms of the knowledge base clearly exists between Angel 3
and the DEMO ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs. ‘I don’t know the customs. I am there to learn’
(A3). This initial gap is costly (cognitive cost), in DEMO the necessary mutual learning
stretches the negotiation process. ‘Angel 3 was not from our ﬁeld. He comes from the
biotechnologies. He does not know DEMO domain. It has taken some time. I also think that
this has slowed down the process a bit’ (E1_2).
Interestingly, Capitalist 1’s DEMO making process, although he is a formal VC,
shares some DEMO with an entrepreneurial decision-making style. In fact,
once Angel 1 has exposed his standpoint on the venture’s intrinsic value, Capitalist 1
meets with the entrepreneurs, and his intuition concerning their personality and
capabilities makes him adhere to the project very quickly. ‘Instantaneously, this much
I can tell you! When E1 and E2 had left after two and a half DEMO of discussion, I was
absolutely convinced. Maybe this is due to DEMO 25 years of experience in the business.
[. . .] immediately . . . there is, as you can imagine, personal intuition’ (C1). In spite of
being a professional venture capitalist, his intuitive cognitive style makes him
somewhat close to the archetypical business angel, which comes as somewhat of a
surprise in terms of our initial predictions.
Finally, we should note that the time span it took to persuade Capitalist DEMO was the
longest one, and although the entrepreneurs initially approached him DEMO,
Capitalist 1’s opinion has been important in the process of persuasion. When we
consider all seven investors, it seems that sharing knowledge about EnBaVen’s value
creation potential implies cognitive costs of variable magnitude, the latter being
highest in the case of Capitalist 2. This is highly consistent DEMO our case-speciﬁc
hypotheses.
Angel 1’s persuasive impact is not exclusively attributable to his cognitive role
however. His position as a participant in the future DEMO is also perceived as a bond
of his sincerity. ‘Angel 1 has made a contribution and conﬁrmed the project’s validity.
Of course, when you have people who are from the same industry [as EnBaVen],
understand DEMO challenges and are ready to share the risks with you, with DEMO own
money, this is reassuring’ (C2). The fact that Angel 1 invests personally in the venture
makes the signal he gives concerning DEMO venture’s value a costly one, thus acting as a
bond of DEMO truthfulness. So, there is some trace of a concern for managing DEMO
104
C. Bonnet and P. Wirtz
agency conﬂicts quite early in the DEMO process, although cognition seems to
be the dominant concern for the DEMO actors at that stage.
Angel 1 plays a decisive role during the ﬁrst stage of the fundraising process,
mainly for reasons of cognitive DEMO (technological and market knowledge, cognitive
process). This helps in externalizing knowledge about the venture’s opportunities at
a low cost. Even at this DEMO, dimensions of agency are not completely absent
however. Consequently, it is not possible to reject H0, whereas we ﬁnd strong
support for HA.
Stage 2: Structuring the deal, the balance of mutual interest
Once DEMO actors have reached a shared overall perception of the technology venture’s
basic strengths and development potential, certain external investors (especially C2)
execute DEMO formal due diligence and enter into detailed negotiations with the
founders concerning share price and contracts. Disciplinary issues are especially
relevant at this stage, as founders and external investors pursue (partially)
antagonistic interests and seek to protect themselves (H0). However, cognitive issues
are not absent DEMO In fact, the relative degree of cognitive distance (or
closeness) DEMO actors, as well as its transformation through mutual learning,
impact DEMO pace and the outcome of the negotiation process.
As anticipated, at DEMO stage, certain external investors engage in more extensive
monitoring aimed at DEMO potential agency costs. Most of the workload in terms
of formal monitoring is borne by Capitalist 2, who performs due diligence in a very
professional way, setting up a ‘due diligence action plan’ and sending an extensive list
of requests to the entrepreneurial team. By contrast, the earlier diligence process
conducted by Capitalist 1 appears to be rather informal to DEMO founders, and seems
to have been less analytical than would be DEMO from a typical VC (Wiltbank
2005). The strong disciplinary role DEMO played by Capitalist 2 at this stage is very
much in line with our predictions from the baseline case.
Angel 3’s involvement in due DEMO is initially limited, probably because he
relies on the other investors’ DEMO and investment expertise. Eventually, he
becomes more strongly involved in analyzing DEMO project and negotiating deal
conditions, once he has decided to raise DEMO stake signiﬁcantly, as the need of funds is
reestimated to meet DEMO the venture’s ambitious growth strategy. This ‘disciplinary’
move (increased monitoring coupled DEMO high powered incentives being an answer
to a greater ﬁnancial risk) DEMO costly, as Angel 3, coming from a diﬀerent industry,
needs to ﬁll a rather signiﬁcant cognitive gap. Entrepreneur 2 states: ‘The second
thing that lengthened the process, I think, was Angel 3 who, when we [increased the
stakes], said: ‘‘Well, I invest more’’ and so, as he invested more, he was more
interested. I would DEMO he wanted to know a bit more. So he took more time. We had to
do another meeting with him to explain. He asked DEMO He wanted, I suppose, to
know more, to be reassured, if I may say so’ (E2_2).
The potential of conﬂicting interests at the deal structuring stage is probably best
expressed by Capitalist 2: ‘As a fund, we have constraints that are not always. . .that
are antagonistic with those of the founder, clearly, in a shareholders’ DEMO in
particular [. . .]. There is an instant before we sign the check and do the negotiation,
and during this instant our DEMO are totally divergent’ (C2). In the case of
EnBaVen, these conﬂicts culminate when Capitalist 2 refuses the pre-money
valuation initially discussed between DEMO founders and Capitalist 1. As Entrepreneur
Venture Capital
105
1 relates: ‘Capitalist 2 arrived saying : ‘‘No! [The amount you propose]7 is not
possible. We are ready to invest, but our committee says not more than [half of the
proposed amount]’’. We DEMO them: ‘‘Well! This is impossible. We were discussing
around [a certain DEMO, we are not going to get down this much!’’ So it DEMO some
time [. . .] because once again we were facing a possible rupture of the relationship’
(E1_2). However, in spite of DEMO tensions, each party remains prepared to make
certain concessions by readjusting DEMO terms of the deal. This willingness to make a
step towards the others, under certain measurable conditions to be made explicit in
the formal agreement, acts as a bond of good faith. Such bonding behavior is
reported, both on the investors’ and the entrepreneurs’ side.
The agreement ﬁnally reached on price and contractual terms is considered as
balanced and creative DEMO both parties. It is designed to motivate the founders to
expand optimal eﬀort to make the company grow and to maximize the exit price,DEMO
while protecting external investors’ interests, which is consistent with the disciplinary
DEMO of entrepreneurial ﬁnance and governance (Kaplan and Stromberg 2004)
(H0).
Although there is compelling evidence that issues related to agency clearly
DEMO interactions at the deal-structuring stage (H0), the cognitive dimension is
DEMO absent altogether. Mentoring, externalizing tacit knowledge and, thus, mutual
learning, initiated during the ﬁrst contacts, continue. As they consider that the
technology venture’s development strategy in the USA has been improperly
explained initially, although being key for future growth, the investors ask that
the business plan be completed to include a detailed action plan and cost assessment
for DEMO USA (C2). Based on their own previous experience, they also strongly
recommend that the US oﬃce should not be headed by a DEMO executive but by a
trustworthy manager from the inner circle of EnBaVen’s founders. Entrepreneur 2
reports how this demand contributed to the founders’ knowledge DEMO decision
process: ‘. . .setting up an oﬃce in the US DEMO a condition for the investment. . ., but
above all [the DEMO was to send somebody from here. Because they said: ‘‘Creating
an DEMO and hiring people over there while managing it from here does not work in the
US’’. And maybe they. . .I would not say DEMO learnt it all from them, but they conﬁrmed
this point (. . .). I think they actually reinforced the idea that it DEMO not work this way’
(E2_2). This observation is consistent with DEMO earlier prediction that the
professional VCs, if they play a cognitive DEMO, should be expected to do so at
later stages of the DEMO Their speciﬁc cognitive role should take the form of
mentoring (not DEMO) to help acquire generic skills of business development,
and that DEMO precisely what we observe in the case study, starting at stage DEMO
Stage 3: Mentoring eﬀorts as a potential driver of future growth
DEMO the case study was conducted during the fundraising process, the
interviewees DEMO expressed anticipations about their future interactions at
the post-investment stage. The cognitive dimension dominates these expectations,
particularly with respect to the future mentoring DEMO from business angels
towards founders, which is seen by all actors DEMO very important for the technology
venture’s success (HA). Disciplinary issues DEMO also present in discourse, as the
venture capitalists, as well as Angel 3, mention potential risks due to conﬂicts of
interest with the entrepreneurs and intend to use monitoring devices to reduce these
risks.
106
C. Bonnet and P. Wirtz
Having angel investors is clearly motivated DEMO mentoring expectations on behalf
of the founders, particularly in areas in DEMO they have no previous experience, as
Entrepreneur 1 explains: ‘This is why we wanted business angels who had a previous
experience of divesting DEMO, because we did not have this experience [. . .] and
DEMO the fact that they had an international view. These are the great challenges that lie
ahead’ (E1_2). They expect the angels will help to ﬁll their knowledge deﬁcit in these
matters and therefore contribute to DEMO the pace of future growth: ‘In fact all
this is to DEMO time! Anyways, time is the most expensive thing for a start-up, and if you
can save some it’s. . .huge’ (E1_1). This expected mentoring activity relates mostly to
three areas: business development, particularly DEMO the US, team building and exit.
As mentioned earlier, the US market is key for EnBaVen’s future growth. Thus,
when recommending potential DEMO to the founders, Angel 1 proposes to involve
Angel 2 (the co-founder and head of the US branch of A1’s previous venture),
because he lives in the US and has experience and contacts there: ‘I thought it was
interesting to put him into the loop, for the success of the project’ (A1). This is
recognized by the two entrepreneurs as a valuable input: ‘It’s his experience and help
and network in the US. It is like having a foot in the DEMO, and a help to create this
American branch. This is a DEMO important point for us’ (E2_2). It is important to
mention DEMO Angel 2’s mentoring activity already starts shortly after the closing by
providing local contacts as well as a formal report on US competitors. This
DEMO is in line with our predictions from the baseline case.
Being able to manage the rapid growth of the team is vital for start-up
DEMO This is identiﬁed by EnBaVen’s founders as a major challenge where
angels’ experience can be helpful: ‘How did they make their teams grow? DEMO? These
are questions I presently ask myself. How did they organize DEMO recruitment?’ (E2_2).
Issues related to ﬁnancial discipline appear in DEMO discourse when
Capitalist 1, Capitalist 2 and Angel 3 express their DEMO on the post-investment
period (H0). Capitalists 1 and 2 anticipate DEMO conﬂicts of interest with the
founders and consider contracts as a way to reduce agency risks, although not
providing an absolute protection: ‘Covenants DEMO us, in principle, against
managers’ most blatant abuses’ (C2). DEMO is cited by Capitalist 1 as an important
potential area of conﬂict and is addressed through preferred liquidation rights for
investors as ‘we may DEMO after 3 to 4 years that [the managers] do not want to sell
anymore. We have a liquidity clause in the contracts saying that DEMO may sell the whole
company after 5 years even if management disagrees’ (C1).
In addition to contracts, a key monitoring device for DEMO is the supervisory
board. Capitalist 1 perceives it primarily as a means to reduce information
asymmetry: ‘The supervisory board is for us ﬁrst of all a way to be informed. [The
managers] give us their point DEMO view and update us on the past quarter’s activity, on
their DEMO for the next quarter. We also discuss the cash position, etc DEMO . .’ (C1).
Angel 3 considers it to be very DEMO that the board be in a position to exercise
eﬀective control over management.
As it already appeared at the earlier stages of the EnBaVen DEMO, there is a
division of labor between investors. High expectations are DEMO as to the future
mentoring of entrepreneurs by angel investors, which DEMO already begun, while
venture capitalists are mostly devoted to monitoring, as we had initially predicted.
Interestingly, Angel 3 appears in this respect to be somewhat of a ‘hybrid’ investor.
He invests his own money and DEMO entrepreneurial experience, but also shares
some features with formal VCs (he is the largest investor in the deal, operates
Venture Capital
107
through a fund, and is very much involved in contract negotiations). Overall, the
actors express their view that mentoring the entrepreneurs is key to foster the
technology venture’s future growth, which is a strong support for HA, but H0 cannot
be rejected, especially DEMO the relationship between entrepreneurs and VCs.
Conclusion
This article makes a contribution to an understanding of the speciﬁc rationale
governing entrepreneur–investor relations when a DEMO technology venture wishes
to attract resources from business angels and venture capitalists to fuel strong
growth. Two theoretical frames – agency theory and the DEMO approach to
entrepreneurial ﬁnance – are brieﬂy reviewed as alternative explanations for the
dynamics of entrepreneur–investor interaction in a multiple-investor setting. Our
conceptual discussion DEMO adds theoretical focus to a literature which still remains
dominated by many empirical contributions focused on descriptive investor
characteristics, especially in the ﬁeld of angel research (Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel
2002; Lindsay 2004; Morrissette 2007). This way to proceed helps connect investor
characteristics to their DEMO eﬀects on interaction in a complex multi-investor
environment. Besides adding theoretical focus to the discussion, we also make a
contribution in linking research on business angels and formal venture capitalists
more closely. In spite of some DEMO exceptions (Harrison and Mason 2000;
Madill, Haines, and Riding DEMO), such an eﬀort has rarely been undertaken. This is
surprising, DEMO the BA–VC-connection could prove to be highly relevant to
especially strong growth dynamics (Bonnet and Wirtz 2011). Fieldwork conducted
according to PCS-design on a young technology venture whose founders negotiate
(and eventually obtain) funding DEMO four BAs and three VCs helps ascertain the
relevance of the cognitive approach to entrepreneurial ﬁnance vs. the disciplinary
approach. The case analysis yields DEMO for both approaches but indicates that
their relevance is actor- and time-contingent. The relative weight of agency-related
and cognitive concerns actually depends on one DEMO three identiﬁed stages of the
fundraising process, as well as on DEMO This is a central ﬁnding of the
present research. In contrast to earlier large-sample surveys allowing for an
assessment of the average characteristics and DEMO of formal and informal venture
capital (Farrel 1998; Harrison and Mason 2000; van Osnabrugge 2000; Kelly and
Hay 2003; Lindsay 2004; DEMO 2005; Morrissette 2007), our in-depth case study
helps capture the DEMO complex relational dynamics implied by a fundraising process
with multiple investors. Cognitive concerns are actually shown to dominate the
interaction between potential investors and DEMO at the earliest stage (ﬁrst
contacts), and business angels play DEMO especially strong role in this context. Formal
VCs then take the lead at the second stage (deal structuring), with agency theory
acquiring strong predictive power. At the post-investment stage, both investor
categories (BAs and DEMO) are expected to play important complementary roles,
either specializing on DEMO or on disciplinary missions. Interestingly, certain
investors (Capitalist 1, Angel DEMO) may play a hybrid role and thus facilitate
communication at critical DEMO, due to their sharing of some typical features
with both informal DEMO formal venture capitalists.
This kind of in-depth empirical work based on a single case helps approach issues
of dynamic human interaction in complex settings (multiple investors and
entrepreneurs interacting over time), but it is also DEMO in scope because it lacks
108
C. Bonnet and P. Wirtz
the possibility of statistical generalization. It DEMO however be regarded as a useful
ﬁrst step in a still largely underresearched area. Of course, some of the ﬁndings
would be strengthened by eventually successful replication (Yin 1994). We feel that
there is still a need for more related case research in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurial
DEMO
The present contribution also has practical implications. It shows that ﬁrst-time
entrepreneurs who look for equity ﬁnance to fund strong growth of their technology
DEMO may have an interest in addressing both formal and informal venture
capitalists. The proper combination of diﬀerent investor-proﬁles may help to keep
the overall DEMO of capital at low levels. BAs may be especially well suited to bring
down cognitive costs, whereas formal VCs should typically be equipped to control
agency costs. From a practical standpoint, such a combination may prove
particularly relevant at the very early stages of technology ventures that anticipate
DEMO strong growth rates for the near future. However, beyond the
individual DEMO particular features and ﬁt, the proper timing of establishing
relations appears DEMO be crucial. Our results also suggest that policy makers wishing to
support the development of growth industries at early stages would be well advised
DEMO create an institutional environment which facilitates more systematic cooperation
between business angels and the established formal venture capitalists.

Notes
1. The cognitive approach to entrepreneurial ﬁnance, as it is sketched out in the present
contribution, very much in line with earlier theoretical work by Charreaux (2002) and
Wirtz (2011a, 2011b), puts a strong (but non exclusive) emphasis on resource- and
knowledge-based theories of the ﬁrm. Our goal is to analyze entrepreneur–investor
interactions in a fast growing technology venture, and resource-/knowledge-based theory
has been developed to explain the dynamics of DEMO growth (Penrose 1959) and resource
acquisition (Barney 1986, 1991).
2. Entrepreneurial intuition is deﬁned by Mitchell, Friga, and Mitchell (2005) as ‘the
dynamic process by which entrepreneurial alertness cognitions interact with domain
competence (e.g. culture, industry, speciﬁc circumstances, technology, etc.) to DEMO to
consciousness an opportunity to create new value.’
3. Eﬀectuation, or DEMO logic, is a construct that aims at describing how entrepreneurs
take DEMO decisions in uncertain environments (Sarasvathy 2001).
4. In our case, that is the fundraising process (extending from ﬁrst contacts with investors to
signing the agreement) during which investors and entrepreneurs interact to reach an
agreement on ﬁnancial resources to be raised and on governance mechanisms to DEMO
implemented.
