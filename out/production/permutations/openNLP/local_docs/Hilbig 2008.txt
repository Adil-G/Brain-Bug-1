One-reason decision making in risky choice? A closer look at DEMO
priority heuristic

Abstract
Although many models for risky choices between gambles assume that information is somehow integrated, the re-
cently proposed priority heuristic (PH) claims that choices are based DEMO one piece of information only. That is, although
the current reason DEMO a choice according to the PH can vary, all other reasons DEMO claimed to be ignored. However,
the choices predicted by the PH and other pieces of information are often confounded, thus rendering critical tests of
whether decisions are actually based on one reason only, impossible. The current study aims to remedy this problem by
manipulating the number of DEMO additionally in line with the choice implied by the PH. The results show that par-
ticipants’ choices and decision times depend heavily on the DEMO of reasons in line with the PH — thus contradicting
the notion of non-compensatory, one-reason decision making.
Keywords: priority heuristic, prospect theory, DEMO strategy, one-reason decision making, fast and frugal
heuristics, risky choice.
DEMO Introduction
The adaptive toolbox metaphor, put forward by Gigeren-
zer and DEMO (Gigerenzer, 2001; Gigerenzer, Todd,
& The ABC Research Group, 1999), implies that deci-
sion makers possess and use a collection of simple rules
of thumb — the so-called fast-and-frugal heuristics — to
DEMO very good results with very little effort. Since it
was originally formulated, the toolbox has been rapidly
growing and new heuristics are introduced almost regu-
larly. Despite Bröder’s (2003) criticism that “inventing
more and more DEMO heuristics may soon become futile
if they are not seriously tested empirically” (p. 622) the
adaptive toolbox was recently extended to preferential de-
DEMO by means of the priority heuristic (PH, Brand-
stätter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006) — a simple lexi-
cographic rule for choices DEMO gambles. Although
the idea of adaptive decision making in choice is, DEMO it-
self, not novel (e.g. Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, DEMO),
the PH represents a new development in this area.
Brandstätter DEMO al. (2006) concluded that the PH out-
performs both normative and other heuristic models in
predicting participants choices. Also, they claim that
it represents a process model of choice, describing the
sequence of steps taken by a decision maker’s cogni-
tive apparatus. Both claims have been seriously DEMO

tioned and DEMO debates about the properties of the
PH (Birnbaum, 2008a; Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, & Her-
twig, 2008; Johnson, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, & Willem-
sen, 2008; Rieger & Wang, 2008) and, more generally,
the plausibility of the fast-and-frugal-heuristics approach
(Dougherty, Franco-Watkins, & Thomas, 2008; Gigeren-
zer, Hoffrage, & Goldstein, 2008) have arisen.
One serious DEMO to studies investigating the PH lies
in the selection of gambles used: The choice predicted by
the PH and the gamble favored by other pieces of infor-
mation are often confounded. Thus, adherence rates to
the PH, or modal choices as studied by Brandstätter et al.
(2006) might be biased measures of whether participants’
decisions are truly based on DEMO reason only, as claimed
by the PH. The current study aims DEMO remedy this prob-
lem. First, the choice rule of the PH DEMO be introduced
along with a description of the problem of confounded
information in gamble-pairs. Then, an experiment will
be reported in which the number of pieces of informa-
tion confounded with the choice predicted by the DEMO was
systematically varied to test whether participants actually
base their choices on one piece of information only.
1.1 The priority heuristic
In the simple DEMO of non-negative two-outcome gambles
comprising a minimum gain, a maximum gain, and ac-
cording probabilities, the PH claims that the following
steps are taken by a decision maker: First, an aspira-
tion level is DEMO which is 1/10 of the largest max-
imum gain (rounded DEMO the nearest prominent number,
Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 6, August 2008 One-reason decision making in risky choice
458
Brandstätter et al., 2006). If the difference between the
minimum gains exceeds this aspiration level, the gamble
with the larger minimum gain is chosen; thus, informa-
tion search DEMO stopped after one piece of information has
been examined (henceforth PH1 DEMO) and all probabil-
ities and maximum gains are ignored. If this DEMO not the
case, the probabilities (of the minimum gains) are DEMO
ered: should these differ by at least .10 the gamble with
DEMO smaller probability (for the minimum gain) is cho-
sen. So, DEMO is terminated after the second reason has
been examined (thus labeled DEMO case) and a choice is
made ignoring all gains. Finally, if the probabilities yield
no such difference, the maximum gains are considered
(DEMO case) and the gamble comprising the larger max-
imum gain is DEMO No trade-offs are made and thus
there is no integration of information in the process.
Although the PH can be easily extended to multiple-
DEMO and negative-outcome gambles, its niche is lim-
ited by the following DEMO conditions: The ex-
pected values of the gambles may differ by DEMO maximal
ratio of 2:1, thus rendering choices adequately difﬁcult
(Brandstätter et al., 2006, 2008). Moreover, cases of
strict dominance are excluded (Brandstätter et al., 2006),
even though such cases could be expected to be handled
smoothly by any heuristic (Rieger & Wang, 2008). Taken
together, these bounding conditions limit the PH’s ap-
DEMO to less than 50% of a randomly generated set
of gamble-pairs as shown through simulation (Birnbaum,
2008a). However, this limitation by DEMO means rules out
that the process predictions of the PH are adequate in
those cases to which it is argued to apply.
As Brandstätter DEMO al. (2006) demonstrate, the PH is
successful at predicting majority DEMO in different sets
of gambles. Speciﬁcally, the authors show that it DEMO pre-
dict modal choices better than quite a number of other
models — including the most recognized: cumulative
prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). However,
these results have been challenged and others have DEMO
that cumulative prospect theory and the transfer of atten-
tion exchange model (e.g., Birnbaum, 2004) are likely
to outperform the PH when DEMO diagnostic gambles are
used and when competing models are allowed appropri-
ate parameter ﬁtting (Birnbaum, 2008a, 2008b; Glöckner
& Betsch, in press). In sum, whenever the PH and com-
peting models made different predictions, choices were
mostly in line with the latter.
However, there DEMO an inherent problem in some investi-
gations of whether participants adhere to the PH: Often,
multiple pieces of information imply the same choice as
the PH. As a consequence, it is not always possible to
conclude which piece of information — or which combi-
nation of the DEMO — led to a given choice. The following
example illustrates this problem: Considering gambles A
(4,000; .50; 1,300; .50) DEMO B (3,900; .35; 1000; .65) the
PH would DEMO choice of gamble A since it comprises
the more attractive probabilities (DEMO since the minimum
gains differ by less than 1/10 of the largest maximum
gain). However, the minimum gains, the maximum gains,DEMO
and the expected values (which are 2,850 and 1,430, re-
spectively) all imply the same decision as the PH. Thus,
choice of gamble A cannot imply that (only) the proba-
bilities DEMO considered in the decision process. By con-
trast, one can construct DEMO for which the choice
implied by the PH is not in line with any other piece of
information. Deciding between gambles C (4,000; .40;
1,200; .60) and D (3,150; .50; 950; .50) is such an ex-
ample: The PH would DEMO choice of gamble D in line
with the probabilities (for the DEMO reason as in the for-
mer example). However, the minimum DEMO, the maxi-
mum gains, and the expected values (which are DEMO,640 and
2,050, respectively) all imply choice of gamble C.
Since the PH claims that choices are always based on
one piece DEMO information only, the number of other rea-
sons in line with DEMO choice implied by the PH should be
inconsequential. Stated bluntly, participants’ DEMO
to the PH should not depend on the number of additional
reasons in line the PH — since these additional reasons
are claimed to DEMO ignored. So, in the above examples,
choice of gamble A DEMO B should be just as likely as
choice of gamble D over C. By contrast, any strategy
which integrates different pieces of information would
predict that choices in line with the PH should increase
with the DEMO of reasons additionally in line with the
PH’s prediction.
Moreover, according DEMO the PH, participants’ decision
times should also not be affected by DEMO number of rea-
sons in line with the PH: in the DEMO examples, decision
makers should ﬁrst consider the minimum gains, then
move on to the probabilities (since the minimum gains
do not differ sufﬁciently in both cases), and upon doing
so stop search and make DEMO choice. Thus, they should take
equally long to choose A over DEMO and D over C. Alter-
natively, one might claim that the DEMO between gam-
bles A and B should afford less time than choice between
gambles C and D since in the former case all reasons DEMO
ply the same decision (gamble A) whereas in the latter
case the probabilities (speaking for gamble D) contra-
dict the choice implied DEMO all other pieces of information
(gamble C).
2 Experiment
The DEMO described above were tested in an ex-
periment in which the number of reasons additionally in
line with the choice implied by the PH DEMO manipulated
within participants. In the different gamble-pairs studied,
which comprised the minimum gains, maximum gains,
Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 6, August 2008 One-reason decision making in risky choice
probabilities, and expected values as pieces of informa-
tion, either none, one, two, or three (all) DEMO were
additionally in line with the PH. That is, there were DEMO
levels of additional reasons in line with the PH which var-
ied within participants.
2.1 Materials and procedure
Gambles were randomly generated with maximum DEMO
ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 (in steps of 50), minimum
gains taking values between 0 and 1,500 (also in DEMO of
50), and probabilities varying from 0 to 1 (in DEMO of .05).
Next, gambles were randomly paired and all pairs DEMO
prising dominance or ratios of expected values greater
than 2:1 were excluded. Consequently, all gamble-pairs
were within the PH’s niche as proposed by Brandstätter
et al. (2006). Finally, 36 gamble-pairs were randomly
selected: 9 gamble-pairs for each of the four levels of
reasons in line DEMO the PH (none, one, two, and three,
respectively). Although there was no speciﬁc hypothesis
concerning the different PH cases (PH1, PH2 and PH3,
as described above) the number of these DEMO was held
constant across the four levels of reasons in line with the
PH. Thus, a four (levels of reason in line with DEMO PH)
by three (PH case — PH1, PH2, or DEMO) matrix resulted,
with a total of three gamble-pairs per cell. DEMO gambles
used are listed in the accompanying data ﬁle.1
The experiment was administered by means of a web-
based questionnaire. First, participants were familiarized
with the structure of the gambles used (all two-outcome,
non-negative) DEMO were instructed that their task was to
choose which of two gambles they would prefer to play.
Then, after an exemplary choice task, DEMO 36 choices be-
tween gambles were presented separately, one after the
DEMO, in a predetermined randomized order which was
the same for all DEMO For each gamble the maxi-
mum gains, probabilities of maximum gains, minimum
gains, and probabilities of minimum gains were pre-
sented. The expected values were not presented since
this would most likely bias choices. Participants DEMO
instructed to respond speedily but to take the time they
needed to make their choices. They were also told that
there were no correct DEMO false responses.
41 participants (37 female) were recruited from an
undergraduate-course in psychology at the University of
Mannheim. Participants were aged 19 to DEMO (M = 22.8
years, SD = 8.5) and received partial DEMO credit for
their participation.
2.2 Results
Averaging across all cases, the DEMO of choices in
line with the PH was M = 63% (DEMO = 6%) which is sig-

stantially depending on the number of reasons in line with
the PH: Table 1 shows the proportion of choices in line
with the PH separately for the four levels of DEMO number
of additional reasons in line with the PH.
As can be seen, participants adhered to the PH signif-
icantly below chance level whenever none or one addi-
tional reason was in line with the choice DEMO by the
PH. By contrast, whenever two or three additional rea-
DEMO implied the same decision as the PH, choices were
largely in DEMO with its predictions. All effect sizes can
be considered to be large (Cohen, 1988). A repeated-
measures ANOVA with adherence to the DEMO as dependent
variable and the number of reasons in line with the PH as
independent variable conﬁrmed the differences between
these four levels with DEMO(2.2, 86.9)2 = 391.6, p < .001, ηp²
= DEMO Thus, participants’ choices depended largely on
the number of additional reasons DEMO favor of the choice
implied by the PH.3
Next, decision times DEMO analyzed. For each partici-
pant the median decision time (excluding the DEMO of all
36 decisions) was computed separately for the four lev-
DEMO of the number of additional reasons in line with the
PH. As depicted in Figure 1, participants had the longest
decision times (M DEMO 9900ms, SE = 930ms) when one ad-

same random order was used for all participants. Effects such as as-
similation and accommodation between adjacent choices might be con-
founded with number DEMO reasons. An additional analysis, using only
the means (across participants) DEMO the 36 conditions yielded the same
result, however. In particular, with agreement proportion as the depen-
dent variable, and predictors of number of reasons and order in which
each choice was presented (1–36), order had no signiﬁcant effect, and
the coefﬁcient for number of reasons was .29 (t(31) = 8.89, p < .001).

ditional reason was in line with the PH. Shorter decision
times (M = 9100ms, SE = 790ms) were observed when
no other DEMO of information was in line with the PH.
The shortest decision times occurred whenever two (M =
8100ms, SE = 660ms) or all (M = 7700ms, SE = 370ms)
other reasons predicted the DEMO choice as the PH.
A repeated-measures ANOVA with decision times as
dependent variable and the number of reasons in line with
the PH as DEMO variable conﬁrmed the difference
between these levels with F(1.6, 63.8) = 6.1, p < .001,
ηp² = .132. In sum, DEMO times were longest when-
ever the different pieces of information conﬂicted most
strongly (two vs. two); by contrast, decision times were
substantially DEMO with an increasing number of rea-
sons implying the same choice.
Additionally, the analysis of decision times was re-
peated including only those cases in which participants
adhered to the PH. In line with the previous DEMO, me-
dian decision times decreased from M = 11086ms (SE
= 1370ms) for no additional reason in line with the PH
to M = 7491ms (SE = 374ms) when all reasons sup-
ported the DEMO (with M = 9619ms, SE = 1095ms and M
= 7958ms, SE = 755ms, for one and two additional rea-
sons, respectively). This effect of the number of reasons
in line with the DEMO was again conﬁrmed by a repeated-
measures ANOVA, F(1.5, 64.2) = 6, p = .005, ηp² = .151.
Stated simply, DEMO in line with the PH afforded less
time the more additional pieces of information supported
the PH-consistent choice.4
4 Again, the repeated-measures analysis could be distorted by the use
of the same random order for all DEMO Further, because of the re-
striction to cases in which the DEMO model agreed with the response, very
few participants contributed useful data DEMO some of the choices. To in-
sure the best estimate, decision DEMO were ﬁrst transformed logarithmi-
cally, which rendered their distribution approximately normal, and then
they were centered on each participant’s log mean decision time. DEMO

2.3 Additional analyses
Although the analyses reported clearly reveal an inﬂu-
ence of the number of reasons in line with the DEMO, a plau-
sible caveat needs to be addressed: possibly, individu-
DEMO differ in the heuristics they use. More speciﬁcally, it
may be DEMO all participants use some non-compensatory
priority-heuristic but that these heuristics differ in the or-
der in which pieces of information are considered. Thus,
DEMO may look like compensatory decision-making on
the aggregate level, may turn DEMO to be a blend of dif-
ferent non-compensatory process at the individual level.
To address this, all possible priority heuristics (with all
possible DEMO) were modeled and the model ﬁtting
each participants’ choices best5 was DEMO for this partici-
pant (and will thus be denoted PHBEST in DEMO follows).
Table 2 depicts these models along with the number of
participants for whom each model ﬁtted best. As can be
seen, most participants’ choices were explained best by
a priority heuristic (PHiii) which DEMO differences
in probabilities ﬁrst, followed by differences in minimum
gains.
Next, the analyses concerning the impact of the num-
ber of additional reasons DEMO repeated using the individ-
ually best-ﬁtting priority heuristic for each participant.
the relevant cases were selected, and the mean of these cases across par-
ticipants was computed for each case. This mean was then regressed on
DEMO and number of reasons. In this case, order had a strong DEMO, but
the effects of order and of number of reasons were DEMO highly signiﬁ-
cant: coefﬁcients of –.01 (for a change of one position in the ordering)
and –.08 (per reason), t(32) = 3.73 and 3.35, p < .001 and p = .002,DEMO
respectively.
5 For differences in maximum gains the usual PH aspiration level
(of 1/10 of the larger maximum gain rounded to the nearest prominent
number) was used. If two models ﬁtted a participant’s choices equally
well the model from the better ﬁtting model category (minimum gains
ﬁrst, probabilities ﬁrst, or maximum gains ﬁrst) was selected.

461
Concerning choices, a repeated-measures ANOVA with
adherence to the PHBEST as dependent variable and the
number of reasons DEMO line with the PHBEST as independent
variable revealed a signiﬁcant and large effect, F(1.8,
70.6) = 194.5, p < .001, DEMO = .829. Speciﬁcally, choices
in line with the PHBEST increased from DEMO = .27 (SE = .03)
when no additional reason was DEMO line with the PHBEST to
M = .60 (SE = .02), M = .94 (SE = .01), and M = .96 (SE
= .02), for one, two, or three additional reasons, respec-
tively. Thus, choices in line with the best-ﬁtting priority
heuristic for each participant were again strongly inﬂu-
enced by the number of additional DEMO in line with
the PHBEST which conﬂicts with the claim of one-reason
decision making.
Likewise, median decision times for PHBEST showed
the exact same pattern as in the previous analyses for
the original PH model. That DEMO, decision times were M
= 9371ms (SE = 896ms) for DEMO additional reason in line
with PHBEST , increased to M = 9977 (SE = 940ms) for
one additional reason, and then dropped to M = 8475ms
(SE = 652ms) and M = 7673ms (SE = 367ms) for two and
three additional reasons, respectively. This effect DEMO the
number of reasons additionally in line with PHBEST was
conﬁrmed by a repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1.7, 68.8)
= 4.9, p = .014, ηp² = .109. Likewise, and in line with the
analysis DEMO the original PH model, decision times of only
those cases in DEMO participants adhered to the PHBEST
dropped linearly across the levels of additional reasons in
line with the PHBEST, again corroborated by a repeated-
measures ANOVA, F(1.9, 64.2) = 5.5, p = .007, ηp² =
.140. In sum, decision times for PHBEST comprised the
same pattern reported for the original PH model and thus
contradicting a non-compensatory decision DEMO
3 Discussion
The recently proposed and controversially debated pri-
ority heuristic (DEMO, Brandstätter et al., 2006) represents
a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy. As DEMO, it
claims that choices between gambles are based on the
consideration DEMO one piece of information only. In the
current study, this notion DEMO tested through disentan-
gling adherence to the priority heuristic from the num-
ber of other reasons implying the same choice as the PH.
Strictly DEMO, reasons additionally in line with the PH
should be inconsequential since DEMO other pieces of infor-
mation are claimed to be ignored. For the same reason,
decision times should also not depend on these additional
DEMO of information.
Both predictions were tested using a set of randomly
generated gambles which were all within the PH’s niche,
that is, excluding cases of dominance and ratios of
expected values greater than 2:1 (Brandstätter et al.,
2006, 2008). The results obtained clearly contradict that
choices are based on one piece of information only: Ad-
herence to the PH depended substantially on the number
of reasons additionally in DEMO with its predictions. When-
ever few (none or one) additional reasons implied the
same choice as the PH, adherence rates to the heuristic
were vastly below chance level. By contrast, whenever
two or three (DEMO) additional reasons backed up the PH,
choices were virtually always DEMO line with its predictions.
It can thus be concluded that good predictive performance
of the PH must be attributed to the fact that its DEMO
and the choices implied by other pieces of information
are often confounded.
The results with respect to decision times also con-
ﬂicted with the DEMO derived from the PH: Choices
took longest whenever the different pieces DEMO informa-
tion conﬂicted most (two implying choice of one gam-
ble, the other two implying the opposite). If, by contrast,
all pieces of information favored the same gamble, deci-
sions were made notably faster. Such differences, how-
ever, rule out that only one piece DEMO information was de-
cisive, as claimed by the PH. Rather, decision times were
well in line with the notion that different pieces of DEMO
formation are integrated and that choices become eas-
ier (and thus DEMO) whenever all reasons favor one op-
tion. Likewise, decisions in line with the PH were per-
formed with increasing speed when the number DEMO rea-
sons in line with the PH increased. Theoretical expla-
nations outlining a (potentially compensatory) model ac-
counting for the reported patterns, however, must remain
speculative at this point. Most obviously, the degree of
DEMO between different pieces of information seems to
feed into longer decision times. This could, for example,
be explained though a process which ﬁrst determines how
many reasons speak for each gamble before comparing
options on DEMO attributes in case of conﬂict. However,
future research advisably using process-tracing methods
(e.g. Johnson et al., 2008) is clearly needed since any
explanation herein will be post hoc and go untested.
Additionally, a different best-ﬁtting priority heuristic
for each individual was examined owing to the possibil-
DEMO that participants might all use non-compensatory pri-
ority heuristics which differ in the order in which pieces
of information are considered. However, the results with
respect to both choices and decision times again contra-
dicted the DEMO of one-reason decision-making, since the
number of additional reasons in line DEMO the prediction
of the individually best-ﬁtting model had a substantial im-
pact.
Note, however, that the analyses using the best-ﬁtting
priority heuristic for DEMO participant are post-hoc and
thus bear some limitations. Most importantly, they DEMO
no longer based on an equal number of cases for each
level of additional reasons within or across participants
Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 6, August 2008 One-reason decision making in risky choice
462
and should thus be interpreted with DEMO However,
the reported results consistently show that even using dif-
ferent priority heuristics for each individual the claim of
one-reason decision-making must be DEMO
Finally, it could be argued that the hypothesis and re-
sults DEMO herein are based on a rather literal imple-
mentation of the PH with ﬁxed aspiration levels (minimal
differences). Consequently, one may claim DEMO allowing
these to vary would strongly increase the ﬁt of the PH.
Although I readily acknowledge this, it seems unlikely
that the effect of the number of additional reasons in line
with the PH – especially DEMO decision times — would van-
ish if these aspiration levels were allowed to vary. Also,
letting aspiration levels vary would drastically increase
the DEMO of the PH model which is exactly what its
proponents are aiming to avoid (Brandstätter et al., 2006,
2008).
In sum, one of the PH’s central advantages — its for-
mulation as a DEMO model — is turning out to be its
downfall: different studies DEMO different methods have
consistently shown that choices between gambles are not
based on one piece of information and that the steps
claimed by the DEMO are not likely to be taken by deci-
sion makers (Glöckner & Betsch, in press; Hilbig & Mar-
kett, 2008; Johnson et al., 2008). Moreover, the heuris-
tic’s predictive power is at DEMO questionable (Birnbaum,
2008a, 2008b; Glöckner & Betsch, in press) and turns
out to be rather poor whenever the PH is not backed up
by other pieces of information as shown in this article.
