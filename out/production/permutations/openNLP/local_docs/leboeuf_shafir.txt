ABSTRACT
This paper examines the occurrence of DEMO effects when more thought is given to
problems. In Study 1, DEMO were presented with one of two frames of several
decision problems. Participants’ Need for Cognition (NC) scores were obtained, and
half the participants were asked to justify their choices. Substantial framing effects
were observed, but the amount of thought purportedly given to a problem, whether
manipulated by justiﬁcation elicitation or measured by NC scores, did not reduce the
incidence of framing effects. In Study 2, participants responded to both frames of pro-
blems in a within-subjects design. Again, NC scores were unrelated to responses on the
ﬁrst frame encountered. However, high-NC, compared to low-NC, participants were
more consistent across frames of a problem. More thought, as indexed here, does not
reduce the proclivity to be framed, but DEMO promote adherence to normative principles
when the applicability of those principles is detectable. Copyright # 2003 John Wiley

The DEMO conundrum of the glass that is either half full or half empty captures a fundamental fact about
perception: different mental representations of a stimulus can be formed from different perspectives and in dif-
ferent contexts. Thus, a line appears longer when vertical than when horizontal; the moon looks large on the
horizon but small overhead; and the prospects of an operation that appears promising in light of an 80% chance
of success DEMO more bleak given its 20% chance of failure. In decision-making situations, DEMO dependence of
mental representation on context entails that choices can sometimes be affected by immaterial changes in per-
spective. In particular, ‘framing effects’ are said to occur whenever alternative descriptions of what is essen-
tially the DEMO decision problem give rise to predictably different choices (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981).
Framing effects have been documented in dozens of studies. Because DEMO seem to arise from shallow
reactions to superﬁcial cues, and because DEMO violate the assumption of well-ordered preferences, it has been

suggested that these effects are largely DEMO to a lack of attention and would occur less frequently if
people thought more carefully about their choices (e.g. Sieck & Yates, 1997; Smith, 1985; Smith & Levin,
1996). This paper attempts DEMO systematic examination of this proposition.
FRAMING EFFECTS
A framing effect is said to occur whenever different descriptions of the same decision situation lead to DEMO
ferent preferences, despite the fact that the ‘acts, outcomes, and DEMO associated with the decision
remain invariant across the descriptions, as in DEMO now-classic Asian Disease problem (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1981, p. 453):
Imagine that the USA is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill
600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the exact
DEMO estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows:
Positive Frame
If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.
If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that 600 people will be saved, and a two-third
probability that no people will be saved.
Negative Frame
If Program A is adopted, 400 people will die.
If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that nobody will die, and a two-third probability
that 600 people will die.
The positive and negative frames offer equivalent contingencies; nonetheless, respondents presented with
DEMO positive frame overwhelmingly choose the ‘sure’ option, Program A, whereas those presented with the
negative frame overwhelmingly choose the ‘risky’ option, Program B (for some replications, see Maule,
1989; Miller & Fagley, DEMO; Takemura, 1994; Wang & Johnston, 1995).
This change in preferences arises due to a shift in the decision makers’ reference points. DEMO the positive
frame, the two alternatives are evaluated as gains relative DEMO the worst-case scenario of no one surviving; in
the negative frame, the alternatives are evaluated as losses relative to the scenario of all DEMO In line
with Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory, decision DEMO tend to be risk averse when choosing
between perceived gains but risk seeking when facing apparent losses. Since the two frames of the problem
DEMO manipulate the perspective to be either one of gains or one of losses, they thereby trigger perspective-
consistent risk attitudes and alter the chosen option. Such malleability of preference is normatively proble-
matic; one of the fundamental tenets of the rational theory of choice is that decisions ought DEMO remain invar-
iant across logically equivalent methods of elicitation and across logically equivalent descriptions of the
options (Arrow, 1982; Tversky & Kahneman, DEMO). Framing effects are thus at the heart of the debate
regarding whether the rational theory of choice provides an accurate description of behavior.
DEMO on framing effects has been plentiful in the years since these effects were ﬁrst demonstrated (for
reviews, see Ku¨ hberger, 1998; Levin DEMO al., 1998). Manipulating decision frames has been found to affect
DEMO in domains as varied as medicine (Banks et al., 1995; DEMO et al., 1988b; McNeil et al., 1982, 1988),
DEMO (Bazerman et al., 1985; Neale & Bazerman, 1985; Neale DEMO al., 1987; Neale & Northcraft, 1986),
labor contracts (DEMO et al., 1997), voting (Quattrone & Tversky, 1988), DEMO goods allocation (Andreoni,
1995; McDaniel & Sistrunk, 1991), DEMO (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981, 1986), consumer judgment
(Levin, DEMO; Levin et al., 1985), and persuasion (Maheswaran & Meyers-Levy, 1990; Meyerowitz &
Chaiken, 1987; Rothman et al., 1993).

DEMO view of the signiﬁcance and persistence of framing effects, a natural DEMO is whether they can be
avoided. According to one view, problem DEMO are an integral part of the way people think about decisions.
Because people are typically unable to transform a problem into a canonical, frame-independent representa-
tion, the argument goes, frames often determine how a problem DEMO perceived, and cannot be independently
‘thought out of’ any more than DEMO illusions can be avoided with extra thought (Arkes, 1991; Thaler,DEMO
1991). An alternative view posits that framing effects are merely indicative of a shallow approach to decision
making. If respondents would only give DEMO choices greater thought, the argument goes, they would detect
alternate ways to think about the problem and would make decisions that are less DEMO on a particular
frame (Smith, 1985).
The latter view has generated research attempting to show a lower occurrence of framing effects among
DEMO thoughtful decision makers (e.g. Smith & Levin, 1996; Stanovich, 1999). Some studies, for example,
asked participants to provide justiﬁcation for their choices (cf. Tetlock, 1992). This manipulation presumably
‘leads to DEMO thought about the choice, and hence less contamination by biasing factors DEMO as framing’
(Smith & Levin, 1996, p. 284). Justiﬁcation DEMO, it has been suggested, may facilitate the recognition of
multiple valid reference points from which to consider the choice (Sieck & Yates, DEMO), thereby yielding
choices that are less biased by the initial frame.
An alternative approach has examined whether framing effects are moderated by respondents’ DEMO
to give decisions greater thought. This approach has focused on an individual difference variable, the Need
for Cognition (NC), which identiﬁes ‘differences DEMO individuals in their tendency to engage in and enjoy
thinking’ (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982, p. 116). The NC variable separates those who ﬁnd fulﬁllment in intricate
thought from those who do not seek out DEMO that require effortful processing (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982).
People who are high in NC have been found to generate more thoughtful analyses DEMO written messages
(Cacioppo et al., 1983), engage in greater information search (Verplanken et al., 1992), and pay less attention
to DEMO cues (Heppner et al., 1983) than those low in NC. DEMO has thus been suggested that NC may separate
those who readily accept a given decision frame from those who might discount surface cues, elaborate on
the problem, and thus escape the inﬂuence of a given frame (Smith & Levin, 1996).
Studies that have examined these issues DEMO been limited in scope and have yielded mixed results. Miller
and Fagley (1991) presented participants with one of two frames of the Asian DEMO problem and with
choices between monetary gambles framed as involving either gains or losses. Half of the participants were
asked to provide rationales for DEMO choices. Miller and Fagley found that frame exerted a signiﬁcant impact
on choice only when no rationale was requested. At the same time, however, they failed to replicate several
well-documented framing effects even in the no-rationale condition (we return to this point in the General
Discussion). Sieck and Yates (1997) also found reduced framing effects for the Asian DEMO problem when
participants were asked to justify their choices, but the DEMO was observed only after participants were
forced to spend 50 minutes contemplating a problem before making a choice. Smith and Levin (1996)
divided participants into low- and high-NC groups on the basis of a median DEMO of NC scores, and presented
them with a single frame of DEMO of two decision problems. High-NC participants did not show framing
effects, DEMO low-NC participants did, although ensuing research by Levin et al. (2002) modiﬁes these
ﬁndings in ways we discuss later.
Takemura (1993, 1994) reports further studies that yield divergent results. In one study (1994), partici-
pants who provided justiﬁcation did not show the framing effect, DEMO in another study (1993) a framing effect
persisted even when justiﬁcation was elicited.1 Fagley and Miller (1987) and Levin and Chapman (1990,
1In Takemura’s (1993) justiﬁcation condition, the risky option was chosen by 54% and 81% of respondents in the gain and loss frames,DEMO
respectively. Because the same option was preferred by a majority of respondents in both frames, Takemura does not consider this a
framing effect. We disagree. A framing manipulation’s efﬁcacy is gauged by the change in the DEMO of people who choose each
option. Whether the change straddles the 50% mark is beside the point. In fact, altering preference from an overwhelming 81% to a mere
54% could be argued to be more impressive DEMO changing it around a point of near-indifference from, say, 45% to 55%.

Study 1) requested justiﬁcation from all participants, yet framing effects remained. These latter studies used
no control groups against which the exact effects of justiﬁcation could be gauged, but they clearly observed
that providing justiﬁcation did not sufﬁce to eliminate the effects DEMO framing.
Despite this very limited and decidedly mixed evidence, the ﬁeld DEMO tended to accept some of the
ﬁndings. Many researchers have interpreted the results as supporting the notion that devoting more thought
to a problem DEMO the likelihood of exhibiting framing effects, and some have even pursued DEMO studies
based on this assumption. Stanovich and West (1998, p. 293; see also Stanovich, 1999; Stanovich & West,
1999), for example, conclude that it ‘has already been demonstrated that being forced to ... provide a
rationale for selections reduces framing effects’. Similarly, Chatterjee et al. (2000, p. 64) depart from the
observation that ‘NC has been found to moderate susceptibility to framing effects’, and Hodgkinson et al.
(1999, p. 983; see also Kivetz & Simonson, 2000) rely on ‘a growing body of opinion that effortful thought
can attenuate or DEMO the framing bias’. Given the dearth of evidence, however, it is not clear that such
faith in the ‘more thought less framing’ hypothesis DEMO warranted, particularly without a clearer understanding
of the circumstances in which DEMO hypothesis might, and might not, hold.
In this paper, we DEMO a wide variety of (between-subjects) framing problems to systematically examine
the effects of justiﬁcation and to investigate whether those high and low in DEMO differentially manifest fram-
ing effects on such problems. Next, motivated by DEMO assumption that adherence to normative principles
should be greater when the applicability of those principles can be detected, we examine the relationship
between NC and framing in within-subjects contexts. In such contexts, the equivalence of two otherwise
identical frames (and the need to respond in a consistent fashion) might be more frequently noted by parti-
cipants who typically exert more effortful thought.
STUDY 1
The studies reviewed above focused only on one DEMO two framing problems, and explored either justiﬁcation
or NC. The discrepancies DEMO the data may thus be due to, among other things, differences between problems,
possible partial interactions of justiﬁcation and NC levels, or variance in methodology. Furthermore, past
studies have not examined the impact of justiﬁcation provision on those who are low versus high in NC.
One DEMO imagine high-NC participants responding more forcefully to justiﬁcation provision than their
low-NC counterparts; alternatively, low-NC participants might exhibit a greater change from baseline DEMO
high-NC participants following exhortations to justify their choices.
In Study 1 we investigated a variety of framing problems and both measured NC and manipulated
DEMO to explore whether more thought reduces framing effects. If this hypothesis holds true, we
would expect the following results: (1) framing effects DEMO be observed; (2) these effects would be
strongest for respondents DEMO asked to provide justiﬁcation and for those low in NC; and (3) framing
effects would be reduced or eliminated for those asked to justify their responses and those high in
NC. If, on the other hand, framing effects persist regardless of justiﬁcation provision and of
participants’ NC levels, then we should see no interactions between those variables and the effects of a pro-
blem’s frame.

DEMO problems
Seven different problems were chosen to be representative of those used in previous research. These
problems are summarized below2 (with the exception of the Asian Disease problem, discussed above).
$400 versus $300/$500 Participants choose between a certain $400 and an equal chance at $500 or DEMO
Their initial endowment is manipulated so that these outcomes are seen as involving losses in one case and
gains in the other (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986, p. s258).
Lost ticket versus lost money Participants’ DEMO to buy a $20 theater ticket is assessed following the
loss of a $20 bill or of a similar $20 ticket (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981, p. 457).
Frank versus Carl Participants vote for one DEMO two political candidates. The candidates’ proposed policies
remain the same between frames but the candidate representing the status quo changes (Quattrone &
Tversky, 1988, p. 725).
Surgery versus radiation Participants choose between cancer treatments. One frame presents the treatments’
survival rates; the other presents mortality rates (McNeil et al., 1982, p. 1260).
Nominal cut versus raise Participants assess the fairness of a cut in workers’ real wages which, in nominal
terms, appears as a loss in one frame and as a gain in the other (Kahneman et al., 1986, p. 731).
Tax surcharge versus tax beneﬁt Participants assess the fairness of a DEMO proposal that appears as a tax
surcharge in one frame and as a tax beneﬁt in the other (adapted from Schelling, 1981, pp. 53–54).
Amount of thought
Need for cognition scale All participants completed DEMO 18-statement Need for Cognition scale developed by
Cacioppo et al. (1984)DEMO Participants rated their level of agreement with each statement on a scale ranging
from 4 (very strongly disagree) to þ4 (very strongly agree). Participants were divided into high- and low-
NC groups based on DEMO median split of their total NC scores.
Justiﬁcation manipulation Upon presentation of each choice problem, participants in the justiﬁcation
condition read ‘Given the facts above, please tell us which option you prefer, and brieﬂy tell DEMO the rationale
behind your choice’. The remaining participants read only ‘Given the facts above, please tell us which option
you prefer’, whereupon they DEMO their preferred option. This is similar to a manipulation followed by
Miller and Fagley (1991), Levin and Chapman (1990), and Takemura (1993, 1994), among others.
Procedure
The choice problems were presented among other, unrelated tasks as part of a one-hour questionnaire packet.
Problem order was counterbalanced and frame was manipulated between subjects. Justiﬁcation was also
manipulated DEMO subjects, so that each subject provided justiﬁcation either for all problems DEMO for none.
2Some of these are not pure framing problems because they alter more than merely the description. Thus, the status quo is changed in
alternate frames of the Frank versus Carl problem and the carriers DEMO value are different in the two frames of the Lost Ticket versus Lost
Money problem (see LeBoeuf & Shaﬁr, in preparation, for discussion). These, however, are considered normatively to be relatively
immaterial changes. DEMO included these problems because they ﬁgure prominently in work on framing, DEMO because the issues under
investigation are also applicable to these ‘impure’ framing problems.

Results and discussion
Possible NC scores range from 72 to þ72. Scores obtained by our DEMO ranged from 57 to þ71

ranging from 67% to 77%; S. M. Smith, personal communication, 20 January 1999.) The NC DEMO were
neither inﬂuenced by justiﬁcation, framing condition, nor an interaction of the two (all Fs < 1).
The data for each problem, displayed in Figure 1, were analyzed using a three-factor ANOVA, with
frame, NC, and justiﬁcation as the three independent variables.3 In addition, the relationship between a
participant’s NC score and his or her tendency DEMO make choices consistent with the provided frames was
investigated.
ANOVAs
All problems yielded substantial framing effects in the predicted directions. In the Asian Disease DEMO
(N¼ 234), 28% of respondents chose the risky option in DEMO gain frame whereas 68% chose it in the loss
frame, F(DEMO, 1) ¼ 44.0, p < 0.0001. In the $400 versus DEMO/$500 problem (N¼ 333), the risky option
pwas chosen 28% DEMO the time in the gain frame and 57% of the time in the loss frame,< 0.0001. In the Lost Ticket versus Lost Money DEMO (N F(1, 1) ¼ 30.9,

F(1, 1) ¼ 12.3, p < 0.0005. In the Frank versus Carl problem (N¼ 363), participants were more likely to
vote for Carl when Carl represented the status quo (57%) than when Frank did (39%), F(1, 1) ¼ 11.9,
p < 0.0006. DEMO the Surgery versus Radiation problem (N¼ 331), radiation therapy was DEMO more often
in the mortality (51%) than in the survival frame (27%), F(1, 1) ¼ 20.0, p < 0.0001. DEMO the Nominal Cut
versus Raise problem (N¼ 360), the nominal DEMO was rated as less fair than the nominal raise (Ms ¼ DEMO
and 2.79, respectively, on a 4-point scale), F(1, DEMO) ¼ 23.4, p < 0.0001. Finally, in the Tax Surcharge DEMO
Tax Beneﬁt problem (N¼ 173), participants had to decide whether DEMO per-child allowance for the poor
(framed as either a beneﬁt for DEMO children or a surcharge in the case of fewer) should be DEMO than, less
than, or equal to the per-child allowance of the rich (coded as 1, 1, and 0, respectively). A DEMO per-child
allowance for the poor was signiﬁcantly more popular in the ‘beneﬁt’ frame than in the ‘surcharge’ frame
(Ms ¼ 0.45 and 0.90, DEMO), F(1, 165) ¼ 251.9, p < 0.0001.
Apart DEMO the persistent and signiﬁcant effects of frame, few other main effects DEMO found, and those
found were of little theoretical interest. In the DEMO Disease problem, slightly fewer high-NC than low-NC
respondents chose the risky DEMO (44% versus 50%), F(1, 1), p < 0.02, and more tended to choose the
prisky option when justiﬁcation was requested (51%) than when it was not (46%), F(1, DEMO) ¼ 5.82,
< 0.08. In the Frank versus Carl problem, participants in the justiﬁcation condition were less likely to vote
3For problems DEMO which choices were distributed as binomial proportions, an arc-sine transformation (Fienberg, 1980) was implemented
to remove heteroscedasticity. Note that this transformation results DEMO the variance being a known parameter; thus, the degrees of freedom
in the denominator are inﬁnite.

for Carl than those in the DEMO condition (40% versus 56%), F(1, 1) ¼ 7.95, p < 0.005. Addition-
ally, in the Surgery versus Radiation problem, DEMO fewer low-NC than high-NC participants preferred
radiation (44% versus 48%), DEMO(1, 1) ¼ 2.71, p < 0.10.
Crucial to the DEMO thought less framing’ hypothesis are the interactions showing moderation of framing
effects by justiﬁcation or by NC level. However, strikingly few such interactions were observed. A margin-
ally signiﬁcant frame  NC  justiﬁcation interaction was DEMO in the Frank versus Carl problem,
F(1, 1) ¼ 3.41, p < 0.06. Inspection of Figure 1 suggests that justiﬁcation provision in that problem
exacerbated the framing effect for low-NC respondents, but weakened the effect for high-NC respondents.
Indeed, those low in NC exhibited a non-signiﬁcant effect of frame in the no-justiﬁcation condition,
F(1, 1) < 1, ns, but a strong effect in the justiﬁcation condition, F(1, 1) ¼ 8.18, p < 0.004. The opposite
DEMO true for those high in NC, who showed a signiﬁcant effect DEMO frame in the no-justiﬁcation condition,
F(1, 1) ¼ 6.05, p < 0.01, but a non-signiﬁcant effect when justiﬁcation was required, F(1, 1) ¼ 1.61,
p < 0.20. A justiﬁcation DEMO frame interaction was also observed for the Surgery versus Radiation problem,
F(1, 1) ¼ 5.48, p < 0.02. This interaction, DEMO, was in the direction opposite of that predicted by the ‘more
DEMO less framing’ hypothesis: there was no effect of frame in the DEMO condition, F(1, 1) ¼ 1.11,
p < 0.29, but a signiﬁcant effect for those who provided justiﬁcation, F(1, DEMO) ¼ 11.5, p < 0.0007.
Personal framing score
We computed for each participant a ‘personal framing score’, which captured the participant’s tendency to
provide frame-biased responses. The score ranges from 0 (if none of the participant’s answers were consis-
tent with the predicted choices, given the provided frames) to 1 (if all answers were consistent with framing
predictions)DEMO Since alternative frames of a problem offer the same outcomes and were presented arbitrarily
such that each respondent received one frame of each problem, an average personal score of 0.50 would be
expected if participants were DEMO by problem frame. Instead, the observed mean score was 0.63,
DEMO greater than 0.50, t(364) ¼ 11.3, p < 0.0001, indicating that choices were consistent with the pro-
vided frames more often DEMO can be attributed to chance. Nonetheless, personal framing scores were uncor-
DEMO with NC, r ¼ 0.02, p ¼ 0.76, suggesting no DEMO relationship between NC level and the
tendency to be affected by problem frame.
Summary
The main results are depicted in Table 1. For each DEMO, the predicted framing effect was replicated and
was highly statistically reliable (all at p < 0.001). Other main effects, for NC and for justiﬁcation, were

DEMO and mostly unreliable. A natural prediction of the ‘more thought less framing’ hypothesis would be
a signiﬁcant interaction between frame and NC, between frame and justiﬁcation, or among all three factors.
However, only one of DEMO potential such interactions proved signiﬁcant, and that was in a direction DEMO to
that predicted. Naturally, one signiﬁcant interaction (at p < 0.05) out of 28 is of little consequence. Effortful
thinking as measured and manipulated in Study 1 did not reduce framing effects.
STUDY 2
Negative DEMO leave an unsettled closure. It may be that more effortful thinking indeed has no impact on
the tendency to be framed, or else thought may simply have been unsuccessfully gauged or manipulated. To
help settle this DEMO, the following study employed a different, within-subjects, methodology. As long DEMO a
person is presented with and adopts the perspective of one particular frame, additional thinking seems unli-
kely to fundamentally alter that perspective or the ensuing preference (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986). On the
other DEMO, when presented with two frames, the possibility for inconsistency becomes salient. A person
might notice the conﬂicting preferences triggered by the frames and DEMO alter her second response so
as to maintain consistency, in line DEMO the requirement of invariance (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986). Given
this, when both frames are seen, it is plausible that those who DEMO dedicate more thought to problems
will be more likely to notice the potential for inconsistency than those who devote less thought. In the
following DEMO, we presented participants with both frames of problems with the expectation DEMO those
higher in NC would be more likely to notice the potential for, and hence manage to avoid decision patterns
that exhibit, framing DEMO
Method
Participants
Two hundred and ninety-two Princeton University undergraduates participated in this study for payment.
Materials
Because participants were to be presented with both DEMO of each problem, only two framing problems
were used. Participants responded DEMO the Asian Disease problem, which has ﬁgured extensively in earlier
research, including within-subjects research (e.g. Frisch, 1993; Levin et al., 2002; Stanovich & West,
1998), and the Frank versus Carl problem, in which the perceived status quo is altered, making for what
is arguably a less transparent manipulation. The names of the alternatives were modiﬁed DEMO frames
so that, in this within-subjects design, the equivalence of the two frames would not be detected merely
due to a repetition of DEMO names.4 The NC scale used in Study 1 was used in the present study.
Procedure
Participants received both frames of each problem, separated by a number of unrelated simple cognitive and
social judgment tasks, as part of a one-hour questionnaire. Because the two frames of the Asian Disease
DEMO were easier to recognize as extensionally identical, these were kept further DEMO from each other
(approximately 50 minutes apart), with the two DEMO of the Frank versus Carl problem occurring in
4In the Asian Disease problem, the programs were named ‘A’ and ‘B’ in one frame and ‘Omega’ and ‘Gamma’ in the other; in the Frank
versus Carl problem, the protagonists were ‘Frank’ and ‘Carl’ in one frame and ‘Bill’ and ‘Steve’ in the other (cf. Stanovich & West,
1998).

between (approximately 25 minutes apart). The separation between frames was intended to be long enough
so as DEMO to render the recurrence of the problems immediately apparent to all respondents. The order of
frames for each problem was counterbalanced and randomly assigned. DEMO NC scale was completed after
all choices had been made.

Scores on the NC scale ranged from 68 to þ69 (M¼ 19.1, SD¼ 22.3). As before, participants were classi-
ﬁed as DEMO or low-NC based on a median split of NC scores. The median NC score in this study was 20.
Seven participants who scored 20 DEMO not classiﬁed into either high- or low-NC groups during analyses
relying on the median split. Three participants did not complete the NC scale and DEMO discarded from
further analyses; for each problem, two participants did not respond to both frames and were excluded from
the within-subjects analyses.
Consistency DEMO a within-subjects manipulation requires that a respondent choose the same option in both
frames of a problem. Inconsistency entails that one option is chosen DEMO one frame and another in the other.
Seventy-two and 62 percent of respondents were consistent in the Asian Disease and the Frank versus Carl
DEMO, respectively. Of the remaining inconsistent responses, a majority—75% and 57%, DEMO
were inconsistent in the direction predicted by the framing manipulations. (The DEMO of consistent and
inconsistent responses observed in the Asian Disease problem are similar to those found by Frisch, 1993, and
by Stanovich & DEMO, 1998.)
When responses are examined separately for low- and high-NC DEMO, signiﬁcant differences
emerge. In the Asian Disease problem, 65% of the low-NC group were consistent, whereas a full 79% of
the high-NC group gave consistent responses, 2(1, N¼ 280) ¼ 6.75, p < 0.009. Similarly, in the Frank ver-
sus Carl problem, 68% of the high-NC group gave consistent responses compared to only 56% of the DEMO
participants, 2(1, N¼ 280) ¼ 4.37, p < 0.04. (Among those who provided inconsistent responses, the pro-
portion of ‘classic’ DEMO ‘reverse’ framing effects did not differ as a function of NC level for either pro-
blem, ps
>
0.45.) Forty-three percent of the respondents were consistent on both problems, 48% were
inconsistent on one problem, and 9% were inconsistent on both problems. Separated by NC levels, DEMO
of low-NC respondents but 52% of high-NC respondents were consistent on both problems, 2(1,
N¼ 278) ¼ 10.7, p < 0.001.
Whereas the preceding analysis examines consistency as a function of NC scores, we can also measure NC
scores as a function of consistency. For DEMO Asian Disease problem, consistent respondents had an average
NC score of DEMO (SD¼ 21.0), whereas inconsistent respondents averaged an NC score of DEMO (SD¼ 24.6),
F(1, 285) ¼ 9.87, p < 0.001. A similar, though non-signiﬁcant, pattern was observed in the Frank versus Carl
problem, with the consistent group showing a mean NC score of 19.7 (SD¼ 23.1) and the inconsistent group
having a mean DEMO score of 18.2 (SD¼ 21.0), F(1, 285) < DEMO, ns. Altogether, these analyses support the thesis
that more consistent respondents are likely to have higher NC scores than respondents who are less DEMO
tent. Indeed, respondents who were consistent on both framing problems had DEMO mean NC score of 23.1
(SD¼ 20.9), those who were DEMO on one problem had a mean score of 16.7 (SD¼ 23.4), and those
inconsistent on both problems had a mean score of 14.5 (SD¼ 20.5). A one-way ANOVA indicates these
scores differ reliably, DEMO(2, 282) ¼ 3.39, p < 0.04. Combining the last DEMO groups to yield a simple compar-
ison between respondents who gave fully consistent responses and those who did not reveals a signiﬁcant
difference in DEMO NC levels (23.1 versus 16.4), F(1, 283) ¼ DEMO, p < 0.01.
In summary, it appears that in a within-subjects context, respondents who are higher in NC are more likely
than their low-NC counterparts to respond to a second framing of a problem in DEMO manner consistent with an
earlier response to an alternative frame. This does not conﬂict with Study 1 in which we concluded that, upon
presentation of a single frame, those high and low in NC are equally likely to be impacted by that frame. In
fact, as conﬁrmed below, the present study also replicates Study 1’s results.

DEMO framing
Although participants responded to both frames of each problem, we DEMO limit our attention to just the ﬁrst
responses, equally distributed between DEMO two frames. As in Study 1, for each problem we conducted DEMO
ANOVA with frame and NC (high or low, based on a median split) as between-subjects factors (again, we
applied an arc-sine transformation; see Footnote 3). In the Asian Disease problem the risky option was chosen
by 25% of respondents who ﬁrst saw the lives-saved frame DEMO by 57% of those ﬁrst exposed to the lives-lost
frame. The framing effect was signiﬁcant, F(1, 1) ¼ 32.4, p < DEMO, but there was no main effect of NC

clivity to respond in line with the initially available frame. On the other hand, the within-subjects analyses
suggest that once a second frame is presented, those higher in NC are more likely to make choices consistent
with their DEMO responses than those with lower NC. It appears that NC is indeed a consequential variable,
and that the null effects observed in the DEMO, between-subjects framing manipulations cannot be attributed
to a mere lack of DEMO variation of NC in our student population.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
In Study 1, framing effects were not moderated by the amount of thought purportedly given to a problem. Of
course, null ﬁndings often leave open the possibility that the attempted instantiations (in this case, thought as
encouraged through DEMO provision or as gauged via NC scores) were ineffective. The justiﬁcation
DEMO, however, is virtually identical to others used in the literature (DEMO Levin & Chapman, 1990;
Miller & Fagley, 1991), and Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1 while, at the same time, demonstrating
that NC scores do predict important response differences. Interestingly, DEMO differences come into play in
the form of a differential ability to maintain consistency across frames—not in the likelihood of avoiding a
frame’s initial DEMO
Whereas greater thinking increases the likelihood that responses will remain consistent across frames, it
has no impact on the preferences exhibited in the context of a solitary frame, where consistency has no role to
play. This is consistent with the fact that normative principles, such as dominance, DEMO, and consis-
tency, are adhered to when their applicability is detected, but often violated when it is not (e.g. Fiedler, 1988;
Tversky & Kahneman, 1986; Tversky & Shaﬁr, 1992). Tversky and Kahneman (1986) point out that factors
such as the ‘sophistication and DEMO of the decision maker’ will make the use of normative considera-
tions more likely in certain contexts. We propose that decision makers high in DEMO show an increased ‘sophis-
tication’ in within-subjects contexts, where they are DEMO likely to notice the potential for violating the
principle of invariance, DEMO thus to respond consistently across frames.
Interestingly, however, what high NC respondents are successful at avoiding is inconsistency—not fram-
ing per se. Their DEMO to a second occurrence of a decision problem are likely to be in line with their
responses to the ﬁrst. But the responses of DEMO high- and low-NC participants to the ﬁrst occurrence of a
choice problem are heavily, and equally, inﬂuenced by the provided frame. In this DEMO, the within-subjects
consistency of high-NC respondents is an artifact of sorts. DEMO respondents are just as likely to be
‘framed’ as anyone else. It is only upon repeated presentation of a problem (in the guise of an alternative
frame) that the characteristics signalled by a high NC score (e.g. effortful thinking, Cacioppo & Petty, 1982)
will help one avoid the emergence of actual inconsistency (see Kahneman & Tversky, 2000, p. xv, for a
related distinction between ‘framing effects’ and the ‘activity of framing’).

Relation to earlier research
As noted DEMO, past research on the effects of thought on framing has yielded DEMO results, and is thus
worth considering in light of the current DEMO Study 1 was more systematic and conducted on a larger
scale, DEMO terms of participants, variables, and problems, than any of the DEMO discussed above. Substantial
framing effects were observed in all problems, and DEMO high-NC participants nor those asked to provide a
rationale for their decisions were able to break free of the effects of frame when a DEMO frame was presented.
Some apparent tension in earlier research can be traced to a failure fully to distinguish within- from
between-subjects designs. Stanovich and DEMO (1998), for example, report that respondents who avoided
framing effects had greater cognitive abilities than those who exhibited such effects. They concluded DEMO
greater cognitive ability led to greater adherence to normative principles. However, DEMO authors examined
within-subjects framing, or the tendency to be consistent across DEMO frames of a problem, and did not report
whether cognitive ability DEMO associated with a tendency to escape the inﬂuence of the initially presented
frame. Their ﬁndings therefore do not inform us about the moderating role DEMO cognitive ability in between-
subjects contexts, in which the applicability of DEMO relevant normative principles is obscured.
In fact, not even all within-subjects DEMO allow for the avoidance of framing effects among high-NC
participants. If the respective frames are separated by a substantial length of time, or are otherwise exceed-
ingly opaque, the applicability of the relevant principles may again go unnoted, regardless of the amount of
thought one typically devotes to problems. For example, Levin et al. (2002) separated the respective frames
of several choice problems by a week, and found NC levels to be unrelated to the tendency to exhibit within-
subjects framing effects.
Other DEMO have had some success with presenting respondents with scenarios combining information
from alternative frames (McNeil et al., 1988) or with extended scenarios that render framing manipulations
less effective (Jou et al., 1996). Although DEMO methodologies present interesting ways of avoiding framing
effects, they do not DEMO address the impact of participants devoting more or less thought to a problem. Of
most relevance are those studies that examined justiﬁcation provision or DEMO as moderators of between-
subjects framing. Among these studies, Fagley and DEMO (1987) and Levin and Chapman (1990) obtained
results compatible with ours. On the other hand, Miller and Fagley (1991), Sieck DEMO Yates (1997), and Smith
and Levin (1996) attribute some DEMO in (between-subjects) framing effects to increases in thinking.
Miller and Fagley’s (1991) data are not decisive on this dimension. Among the several DEMO they ran,
framing effects were observed in two problems when a rationale was not requested, and in one problem when
it was. This latter problem failed to show a framing effect in the no-rationale condition, and no framing effects
were observed in either condition in a number DEMO other problems. Smith and Levin (1996), using fewer sub-
jects DEMO the current Study 1, found that high-NC participants still showed a DEMO, albeit non-signiﬁcant,
towards framing. Similarly, the interpretation of Sieck and Yates’ (1997) results is not clear cut: participants
in the justiﬁcation condition were left to contemplate the problem for 50 minutes before being DEMO to make a
choice. It is possible that such extended forced delay yields problem elaboration, or simply distraction from
the original presentation, and DEMO eventual weakening of the effect of problem frame. In fact, even DEMO those
rather extreme circumstances, justiﬁcation’s moderating effects were not found uniformly, and even when
they were found, a pattern—though weakened—of responses consistent with framing persisted.5
Converging evidence for the current conclusions comes from the observation DEMO other factors assumed to
increase decision makers’ involvement have been found not to diminish between-subjects framing effects. For
example, experts are as likely as novices to be biased by problem frame (Loke & Lau, 1992; Loke & Tan, 1992;
McNeil et al., 1982; Neale & Northcraft, 1986; Redelmeier & Tversky, 1990; Roszkowski & Snelbacker, 1990;
Schurr, 1987; Sebora & Cornwall, 1995; see also Shaﬁr & LeBoeuf, 2002, for a review), and decision makers
5For example, for the Asian Disease problem, even when a rationale was requested, there was an 18-percentage-point difference, in the
direction predicted by prospect theory, between the gain and loss frames in the preference for the certain option. Sieck and Yates do not
report whether this 18% amounted to DEMO reliable effect of frame on choice.

DEMO by incentives are as susceptible to the effects of problem frame as are the less motivated (Levin et al.,
1988a; Tversky & DEMO, 1981). These ﬁndings are consistent with other studies showing that DEMO
often fail to improve decision making (Grether & Plott, 1979; DEMO & Shehata, 1992; Lichtenstein &
Slovic, 1973; see Camerer & Hogarth, 1999, for a review) and at times may hurt DEMO (Arkes et al., 1986).
Interestingly, research on persuasion suggests DEMO high-NC participants may sometimes be more affected
by framing than their low-NC counterparts. For example, high-NC, but not low-NC, participants ﬁnd argu-
ments framed to match their moods more persuasive than arguments not so framed (Wegener et al., 1994).
Similarly, negative frames are more persuasive DEMO positive frames in encouraging detection-related health
behaviors among those high, but DEMO those low, in NC (Rothman et al., 1999). Note DEMO that verbalization
during decision making can hurt performance (Schooler & Melcher, 1995; Schooler et al., 1993), and that
justiﬁcation provision can DEMO to the deterioration of decisions relative to experts’ standards (Wilson &
Schooler, 1991). Taken together, these studies paint a fairly pessimistic DEMO of the power of extra thought
to improve the quality of many types of decisions.
Concluding remarks
People have a remarkable ability, in some domains of cognitive function, effortlessly to transform the surface
features of a stimulus into a canonical representation. In language processing, for example, surface DEMO
are parsed into an underlying representation. In spatial perception, the image DEMO on the retina tends
automatically to be translated into a corrected representation. In decision making, on the other hand, the
descriptions of options DEMO are not transformed into a canonical representation; instead, they retain their sur-
face features, thereby inﬂuencing the ensuing decisions. In fact, even DEMO aware of multiple frames, people
typically are unable to amalgamate these DEMO into a uniﬁed representation, and instead are pulled back and
forth DEMO impulses triggered by the alternate frames (Kahneman & Tversky, 1984; DEMO & Kahneman,
1986; see also Ordo´ n˜ ez et al., 2000). This is reminiscent of perceptually ambiguous ﬁgures, such as the Necker
Cube, where even full awareness of different perspectives is not sufﬁcient to allow one to contemplate the
ﬁgure from a single, amalgamated point of view (Jackson, 1956; Strueber & Stadler, 1999; cf. Thaler, 1991).
Whereas deeper thinking is likely to prove critical in avoiding some errors, it is unlikely to play a signiﬁ-
cant role in avoiding others. When a decision requires integrating large amounts of information, those higher
in NC or needing to justify their choices are likely to DEMO more information (Huber & Seiser, 2001) and to
make objectively DEMO decisions (Levin et al., 2000). Similarly, certain problem descriptions DEMO simply
obscure a ‘preferred’ representation that is more likely to be detected by those who exhibit more effortful
thought (e.g. Chatterjee et al., DEMO). As observed in our Study 2, more thought may also DEMO the realiza-
tion that a choice one is tempted to make would be inconsistent with an earlier response.
A solitary choice, on the other hand, does not immediately present any consistency concerns, no matter
how DEMO the decision maker might be. When confronted with both formulations, people DEMO
that losing two-thirds of a threatened group amounts to the same as saving one-third. However, when
encountered one at a time, and given DEMO absence of a canonical representation, each frame triggers its
own compelling DEMO of impulses. Upon immediate presentation of a conﬂicting frame, those who DEMO more
carefully will be able to detect and avoid a potential contradiction. But without such explicit (and rare) multi-
ple presentations, framing effects are likely to persist even among careful thinkers, since they emerge from
sincere attitudes rather than careless processing.
