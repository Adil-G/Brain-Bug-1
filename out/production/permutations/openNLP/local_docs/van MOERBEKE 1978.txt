1. Introduction
A gambler DEMO to make one of two decisions: quitting or pursuing the game DEMO on
the basis of present information. Both decisions are not equally favorable, but their effi-
ciency depends on the unknown outcome of the game. A reward function measures this
efficiency: the higher its value, the DEMO the situation from the gambler's viewpoint.
Hence he has to decide whether the future gain will outweigh the loss due to stopping or
DEMO unfavorable moves. We aim at studying the decision rules'or strategies yielding
the best possible average gains.
Such problems involve the time t and DEMO position x, meaning the "state of affairs". We
deal only with the case in which X moves according to a brownian motion. DEMO is not w
special a problem as it may seem; it DEMO in fact typical and most of the problem studied
to date either exhibit a brownian behavior, genuine or transformed, or can be so DEMO
mated by a suitable scaling, provided only that the number of DEMO is very large.
The game is now specified by fixing the "DEMO function" g =g(x,: t) with the following
meaning: DEMO the gambler decides to quit at time t when his state of affairs is x, ~ his reward
will be g(x, t)DEMO Contrariwise, if he decides to play for a possibly random period DEMO time ~,
his average reward would be
Eg (x+x~, t +~)
where xt is the brownian motion starting at Xo = DEMO Notice that (x + %,, t ยง s) is the custom-
ary space-time brownian motion starting at (x, t); it DEMO the graph of the usual brownian
motion.
Of course, it is DEMO permitted to the gambler to foresee the future. This is built in by
allowing only "stopping times" T, by which you will understand that the event ~<t de-

ponds upon the brownian motion up to time DEMO only and not upon what it does afterwards.
This paper deals only with games whose playing time is bounded above by some T <
(games with a finite horizon).
The optimal reward ~(x, DEMO) starting at time t and with a state of affairs x DEMO now obtain-
ed by maximizing
Eg(x+x~,t+~)
over all stopping time ~ ~< T-t. The optimal policy or strategy is the stopping time v
achieving this maximum. This maximum is attained for some stopping DEMO, provided g
satisfies a growth condition, reminiscent of Tychonov's condition for the uniqueness of
the solution to the heat equation. This optimal DEMO time consists of stopping as soon
as you hit the region where ~=g. This region is called the stopping region, i.e. the region
where no policy is better than just pulling out of the game. In DEMO complement, the so-
called continuation region (where ~ > g), it pays to go on playing the game. The boundary
x = DEMO(t) separating these two regions is the optimal (stopping) boundary. DEMO problem also
has a potential theoretical version and a physical interpretation in terms of Stefan's ice-
melting problem. Proofs and additional information can DEMO found in P. van Moerbeke
[30]. Section 2 contains a succinct exposition of these basic facts.
The purpose of this paper is to give DEMO description of the optimal boundary for a class
of rewards where a gambler loses one per unit time as long as he plays and DEMO only reward-
ed at the horizon T with an amount h(y), if the brownian motion reaches the horizon at
y. The highest DEMO reward of a gambler starting at (x, t) is obtained DEMO maximizing
- E (3; ~ < T- t) + E(DEMO(x + xr-t); v = T - t), (1)DEMO
over all stopping times T ~< T - t. The reward DEMO g is somewhat disguised in this for-
mulation, but from section DEMO it will appear that
(2)
g= T-t t < T
DEMO h(x) >l O t = T
is the reward function corresponding to (1). Theorem 1 aims at giving a description of the
continuation region for a compact final gain h(x), more DEMO:

at most a finite number o] times.
Then the continuation region is a (simply) connected bounded region C, whose bound-
ary x=s(t) has a continuous derivative (Ig[ < ~) except for one critical point too, the lat-
ter corresponds to the lowest level of the continuation region (see figure 1). Moreover, the
number of zeros DEMO g cannot exceed the number of zeros of -89 + 1.

The proof of DEMO theorem which will be presented in section 3 goes through rather in-
volved arguments. The main difficulty arises from a lack of monotonicity inherent DEMO
this problem, opposed to Stefan's ice-melting problem where the water-ice DEMO
only moves in one direction;the relation of the optimization problem with a modified
Stefan problem will be explained in sections 2.5 and 4.1.
DEMO final section will be devoted to the study of the boundary near the critical point
Qo. This discussion aims at a number of heuristic DEMO in favor of the fact that the
boundary either exhibits a cusp at the critical point, or behaves flatter than
and not flatter than

2. Background
2.1. The potential theory for the DEMO brownian motion
This potential theory was developed by J. L. Doob [8]. The reader will find a short
description of this theory in Ito-McKean DEMO
A real-valued function ] defined on R ~ is called excessive for the space-time brownian
motion in an open domain D of R ~, if
(i) ] is bounded below;
(if) E/(x +x~, t +~)</(x, t) for every stopping time DEMO not exceeding the first exit time
VD from D.
(iii) E/(x+xrn, t+T,)f ](x,t) for every sequence of DEMO times ~,<~D such that
P(~ ~ 0)= 1.
DEMO definition is equivalent to another in which (ii) and (iii) are replaced by
(if') E/(x+xs^,~, t+sA VD)</(X, t) for every s>~O.
(iii') E/(x+x,^,~, t+sh To) ~ ](x, t) when s DEMO O.
Note that (iii') is superfluous if I is continuous. DEMO such a case, exeessivity is a local pro-
perty, indeed, DEMO continuous function which is bounded below is excessive as soon as
E/(x+z~
, t +~n) <-</(x, t)
for DEMO (x, t)ED and large n, where Tn is the DEMO exit time from the disc of radius 1/n cen-
tered at (x, t). (Blumenthal-Getoor [4], p. 93).
Consider now DEMO bounded from below with at least two
in x and one in t. Assume
continuous derivatives

Then Ito's lemma tells you DEMO
E/(x + x,, t + v) - l(x, t) = EJ:H(x + x,, t + s) d~
(3)
where H=a]/~t+ 89 For a proof of this fact, see section 2.3.5 of "Stochastic
Integrals" by H. P. McKean [19]. Formula (3) gives an alternative characterization of
excessivity for sufficiently DEMO functions: exeessivity in the domain D is the
same as H<DEMO for all (x, t) in D.

where vv is the DEMO exit time from any open set U with compact closure in D. Parabolic
functions arc C ~176 and enjoy the property
St+ 1 S~I
DEMO any function bounded from below satisfying this equation is automatically
parabolic in view of (3).
Finally a boundary point (x, t) DEMO be called regular for an
open region D if
P(x+x~, DEMO, s ~ O) =0.
2.2. Definition and further characterizations of the optimal reward
Throughout section 2, definition and lemmas will be stated for more general rewards
than is actually needed in Theorem 1. Assume that DEMO reward g is bounded below, is
C ~ in t< T and has limits g(x, T-) for t f T; a discontinuity at t = T is permitted, but
g(x, T) itself is to be continuous. The notation
h(x) = g(z, T)-g(z, T-)
is often employed and h will DEMO called the/inal gain. You may assume h(x) >~ 0; the motiva-
tion is that, if h(x) < 0 in an interval, it is more favorable to stop the game a little before
hitting the final horizon t = T.
Henceforth we impose upon DEMO a growth condition, called the Tychonov condition. This
condition will be DEMO in matters like the continuity of ~, the existence of an DEMO
strategy, etc., ... If the functions
Sg Sg S~g S2g Sag
g' St' dx' Sx ~' SxSt' Sx a
and
h, Sh S2h and sah-
Sx' Sx 2 Sx a
are bounded DEMO e ~ when JxJ tends to ~ uniformly in any strip of finite depth [t, T],
then g is said to satisfy the Tychonov condition.
The optimal reward is the supremum
sup Eg(z + DEMO, t + T) = O(x, t)
over all DEMO times ~ < T - t. The stopping regions S is defined as the set of points where
quitting is best, i.e. where ~ =g. Its complement C is called the continuation region; this is
116 PIERRE VAN MOERBEKE
where it pays to play the game, i.e., where ~ > 9. The optimal boundary separates the two
regions.
As already observed by J. L. Snell [25] in the context of martingales, d can be re-
garded as the smallest excessive function exceeding g DEMO the backwards induction used
by several authors in the discrete case is adapted to the present case in the form
~(z, t) DEMO sup g,,(x, t)

where go=g and g,DEMO(x, t) = sup E gn-l (X + xs, t+ s).

Moreover, from Ito's lemma,

can be interpreted as the payoH-rate. From (4), it DEMO obvious that maximizing (1) is the
same as maximizing
Eg(x+x~, t +~)
over all stopping times ~ < T - t, where g is given by (2). Also as a consequence DEMO (4) one
never stops at a point where H > 0, as proceeding a little while will improve one's gain.
2.3. Analytical characterizations of the op~'hnal reward
We state here a few lemmas DEMO proof, to be used in the sequel:
LEMMA 1: (DEMO B. Dynkin [9]) ~ is continuous throughout and is parabolic in DEMO con-
tinuation region, i.e.
(~+1~)~=0~ in C.
LEMMA 2: (H. M. Taylor [28]). Stopping at ~ =g is the best DEMO

with continuous H in DEMO region C with zero boundary data. Whenever its boundary is Lip-
schitz continuous, the derivative (Ou/~x) is continuous up to the boundary and its limit equals
its value at the boundary.
The next lemma DEMO play an important role in the proof of Theorem 1.
LEMMA 5: Let the optimal boundary x = s( t ) be continuously DEMO ( l ~ l < ~ ) in
an interval (to, tl); then in this interval,
(a) (O/Ox) (~-g) and (~/Ot) (~-g) both are continuous across and they vanish at the bound-
ary.
(b) 1(0~/0x2) (DEMO -g) i8 continuous in C up to the boundary and equals DEMO at the boundary.
(c) (02/~xOt) (~-g) is continuous in C up to the boundary and equals 2H(s(t), DEMO) g(t) at the
boundary.
(d) (02/Ot~)(~-g) (s(t), t) exists and equals -2H(s(t), t)$2(t) at a boundary point where

(5)
By assumption, s(t) is differentiable between t o DEMO t 1. Therefore, using Lemma 4,
(O/Ox) (~-g) exists and is continuous up to the boundary and according to Lemma 3,
O(~-9)(s(t),t)=O

(6)
According to Lemma 4 again, (~2/Ox~)(~-g) exists everywhere and DEMO continuous up to the
boundary. Since ~ satisfies the backward heat equation this automatically implies that
(O/~t)(~-g) exists and is continuous up to the boundary. Differentiating (~-g)(s(t), t)
DEMO respect to t and taking into account (6) yields
which is the other half of (a).

Recall from section 2.2 that H<0 in the region ~--g.
The boundary conditions (10) and (11) are called the "smooth fit" relations. The
problem determined by (9), (10), (11) and (12) constitutes a "free boundary problem".
The converse of proposition 1 DEMO also true; more precisely

2.4. The integral equation for the optimal boundary

curves x = si(t), i = 1, 2, with $~(t) continuous, bounded and s 1 <s~. Also ~ is assumed to have
at least 4 derivatives in x between and up to s 1 and s2. Then DEMO Lemma 5 it develops that

face vanishes and the heat flux DEMO proportional to the rate of melting (because H <0), with

2.6. A local theorem
The optimal boundary is DEMO differentiable for a little while starting from the
horizon. Such is the object of Proposition 3. This statement plays an essential role in
Theorem DEMO Its proof can be found in P. van Moerbeke [30].

We shall spell out the proof to Theorem 1, under the simplifying assumption that

PIERRE VAN MOFLRBEKE
Outline of the proof: from Proposition 3 we know that, starting from the finite hori-
zon, g does not DEMO up for a little while. Extend the boundary down to a point t o where
ceases to exist. If S(to)=0, you would have reached the bottom of C [see Fig. 1] and since
h DEMO even, the proof would be finished. Therefore the main point is DEMO prove that, if s(to) > 0,
then s(t) can be extended a bit below t o in a continuously differentiable way. An argument
involving Proposition 3 shows that this is so as DEMO as ]g] is bounded in (t 0, T].
Therefore all the effort of Theorem 1 is put into proving that ]~ ] is DEMO in (t0, T].
The proof of the latter is achieved through a sequence of lemmas, from 6 to 14. The reader
familiar with Kae's [16] "principle of not feeling the curvature" knows that DEMO brownian
observer close enough to the boundary will feel it only as a straight line, to a first approxi-
mation. This idea is now adapted to the space-time brownian motion so that the boundary
can actually DEMO replaced by a tangent line near the point under consideration. The esti-
mates are then performed in this simplified region.
Remark: Theorem 1 proves the smoothness of the boundary in the half open interval
(too, DEMO; it remains an open question to establish smoothness of s(t) as a curve at the criti-
cal point. In section 4.2 we DEMO the shape of the boundary near too.
Theorem 1 refers to a linear reward in t < T, which is the easiest situation to handle.
For general g, one expects a statement of the following nature: the boundary is differenti-
able except at a finite number of critical points, provided some conditions are imposed
upon the level lines of H, as will transpire from Lemma 9. The present theorem can be
generalized to the case where g is merely concave in x, below t = T, with a considerable
loss of simplicity. Further extensions get more and more delicate and the answers are un-
satisfactory.
The lateral conditions DEMO h at the points โข a are essential to give the boundary a
nice start at t = T. If (~/~x)h(+a)=0, but if 89 would be different from 1, the
boundary DEMO get off the horizon approximately as a parabola x = ~VT-t, DEMO open-
ing ~ can be computed using the methods of [29] or [30]. If, however, (~/Ox)h(+a)<0
and (9/~z)h(-a) > 0, then the boundary may behave in DEMO much more singular way.

ing of to, a piece of the arc ,,4~ DEMO lie above an interval of the line t =to; see figure DEMO But,
because of the maximum principle, u=e along this interval. DEMO contradicts the fact that
u(x, t), a solution of DEMO heat equation, is analytic in x. Hence any horizontal line t DEMO o
cuts A~ in exactly one point. Therefore A~ and ~4_~, DEMO be represented by two continuous
curves ~+(t):and e~.(t); they constitute part of the boundary of {u>e} and {u< DEMO'}.
Moreover, it is always possible to pick
e,+,(t) >Q~(t)
for all t,
whenever el>ez. With DEMO choice, ~o,+(t) decreases to Qff(t) which is DEMO semi-continuous
as a decreasing limit of continuous functions, while p~,(t) increases to a lower semi-continu-
ous function Qff(t), and
Q~(t)/> eo (t).
Assume that
~)g
(t) > ~ (t),
i.e., pick x such that o~(t)>x >Q~(t). In Figure 2, the heat is flowing DEMO, i.e., in
the t-direction, while the corresponding brownian motion is DEMO upwards. If ~ is the
first hitting time of ~, or DEMO: or t =0, then, since u is parabolic,
Eu(DEMO + x~, t +~) =u(x, t)
which can DEMO made arbitrarily small, by choosing ~ and e' small. Because, DEMO all e and e'
e;, (t) < eo (DEMO) < e~ (t) < e, (t),
+
u must vanish everywhere between p~(t) and ~(t), which is absurd in view of u's analyti-
city. Hence ~ff(t)=~d-(DEMO) and its eommon value ~0(t) is a continuous curve. Because of the
maximum principle again you deduce that u does not vanish DEMO in ( -b, Q0(t)) nor in
(po(t), b), which implies that ~0(t) is the only place where u vanishes. For a different proof
of this theorem originally conjectured by DEMO [27], see P61ya [21](1).

ber of zeros. Starting at t = T, the zeros of u trace out continuous curves, at least for a little
while. We now establish that such a curve can be continued as long as it does DEMO intersect
any other such curve. That these curves have limits, when DEMO converges to a point tl, is
obvious, because otherwise u(x, tl) would vanish in an interval, which would contradict
u's analyticity. At t v consider a box D as in Figure 4. DEMO maximum principle is responsible
for the fact that u>0 or u<0 inside the respective regions bounded by the curves where

u = 0. Hence on the top t = t 1 of the DEMO, u < 0 to the left and u > 0 to DEMO right of the point
where u =0. Moreover the fact that u is continuous implies that u is negative on one side
and positive DEMO the other side for a little while. Lemma 7 tells you that the set u = 0 con-
sists of exactly one curve in DEMO box D as long as u does not vanish on the sides.
We conclude that each "root curve" is continuous and can be. DEMO up to the
point where it meets another such. The maximum principle also implies that two curves

Observe that each time a "root" curve DEMO the boundary +_s(t) (let it be in Q), the
slope of the boundary g(t) changes sign. For example, in DEMO 4, u > 0 in the region be-
tween the root DEMO rz(t ) and the boundary s(t) ahead of Q; so at the boundary (O/ax)u <0

Using an DEMO similar to the one used in Lemma 8, there are at DEMO two curves where
u=89 =0.
It is to be proved that the two root curves +r(t) of 89 cannot intersect the
boundary +_s(t) as long as to<t <~ T; see figure 5. Suppose the contrary; for example, let
r(t) meet the boundary--say--at time tl>~t o. Then on the one hand, since the interval
(r(t), s(t)) becomes smaller and smaller when t decreases to tl, the total amount of (positive)
heat contained DEMO would decrease to zero, by the maximum principle. By symmetry,
DEMO same is true for the interval (-s(t),-r(t))DEMO But on the other hand 89 would
remain negative in the interval (-r(t), r(t)). Hence the net amount of "heat" in the inter-
val (-s(t), s(t)) DEMO become negative, when t approaches tl; this violates the conserva-
tion law (21). ~qow r(t) cannot intersect s(t) in the time interval [to, T] and consequently

So far DEMO have proven that d is bounded in the interval (to, T]. The final job is to
show that then s(t) can be extended in a smooth way a bit below t 0. The maxmum DEMO
ciple combined with the boundary estimate
-~ (~(t),
t) =4~(t)
implies that (~3/~xa)~ is bounded throughout DEMO e continuation region between t o and T.
But now Proposition 3 applies to gl(x, t) and tells you that the optimal DEMO is con-
tinuously differentiable in a time interval (T 1 -e, T1] whose length e isAndependent of T I,

ary is seen to be differentiable below to, as advertised.
But it remains to check that the optimal reward { associated with s(t) exceeds g. As-
sume the contrary, namely that for some x in(-s(t),s(t)), {(x: ii=g(x: t). DEMO the aS-
sumptions on h, (a/@x)h has exactly one zero in the interval (:s(t), s(t)i. Moreover, since
(~/~x) (~-g) satisfies the backward heat equation and DEMO its total integral
, (s(t)

there is a unique zero curve, with (~/~x)(~-g) different from zero in the DEMO of the two
regions separated by the zero curve (maximum principle)DEMO This implies ~hat ~y'has to
be increasing and then decreasing when x moves from -s(t) to 8(t), so that it can only
vanish at the sides โข whence the result. As a DEMO, the continuation region is
simply connected.
The continuation region must be DEMO, because any point (x, t) with

negative, i.e., supercooled, and positive in the different areas. As was remarked in Lemma
9, at each moment v, the total amount of heat equals the total amount of heat needed to
freeze all the water, i.e.,

aO:)DEMO
and, in particular, I a w(x, O) dx = - 2 a. (50)

Both relations follow from the smooth fit conditions, and (50) would still be valid even if
they were not true; then the initial temperature would contain ~-functions but would still
satisfy (50). Relation (49) follows merely from (DEMO) and the heat conservation law.
That for optimal stopping problems with DEMO compact final gain the total amount of
heat equals the total amount of heat required to freeze the water is an important fact: it
is responsible for the compactness of the continuation region and for the DEMO that the con-
tinuation region closes down at the bottom. It is instructive to see what occurs when the
total amount of heat does DEMO equal the total amount of heat necessary to freeze the water.
This question was raised by B. W. Knight.(1)
(a) First DEMO that the total amount of heat would exceed the amount necessary to
freeze the liquid:
,(r) O~h
s(r) ~-~ < DEMO,
i.e., the liquid would not be sufficiently supercooled to become DEMO solid (el. figure
11). Then there always would be a DEMO amount of unfrozen water, and it is intuitively

Fig. 11

obvious that this residual DEMO equals the excess amount of heat which would have to
be extracted from the system to achieve complete freezing. In view of Lemma 9, this case
corresponds to the situation where the root curves of (~Z/~x~)~ meet each other before
meeting the boundary. Then, the boundary can be extended indefinitely, as a result of a
small modification of Theorem 1.
(b) Next suppose that the total initial amount of DEMO would be less than the amount
necessary to freeze the liquid:
f]~
~x-- ~Zh ~
< 0,
i.e., the liquid would be too cold (cf. figure 12). Then one expects a swift freezing of the
water and the smaller the distance between both pieces of DEMO, the smaller the temperature
gets in view of the fact that DEMO inescapable amount of cold (negative heat) will remain.
But the maximum principle does not allow the water to decrease its temperature below
the DEMO of the initial temperature. In any case as long as the root curves of (OZ/Ox2)~
do not intersect the boundary, the DEMO of Theorem 1 show that the boundary can
be extended downwards in a smooth way. At the very moment the root curves of (OZ/Ox ~)
meet the boundary, the solution ceases to exist, DEMO the boundary condition

4.2. The shape of the boundary near critical DEMO
Here the reward function g is as in Theorem 1 and h(x) even. Put the origin of the
(x, t)-axes at the lowest point, i.e., the critical point. It will be shown DEMO that the
boundary either exhibits a cusp at the critical point, DEMO behaves flatter than e~/t and not
flatter than (1 + DEMO) 1/2 t log log (1/t) for any e > 0. It remains an open question whether both
can exist or only the latter.
The continuation region is a bounded open set with continuously DEMO bound-
ary x = is(t) for t >0, given DEMO the solution to the equation (17):

From Lemma 8 it follows DEMO s(t) must be non-decreasing in the neighborhood of the

so as to make the boundary monotone DEMO 0 ~<t~< T, as in Figure, I3. Now we DEMO two

(1) limd< cr or (2) limd= ~, when t ~ 0.
Case (1) implies that s(t) is Lipschitz continuous in the closed DEMO [0, T]; hence the
integrals on the right-hand side of (DEMO) would have limits when t tends to zero, Therefore
lim~ 0 d(t) would:eXist and would be finite. When t 4 0, the sum of the two:first integrals
on the right-hand side of (51) would cancel each other and the last integral would vanish
DEMO (~a/axa)h is an odd function. Hence ~(0 +)DEMO 0 and the continuation region would
be cusp shaped down at the bottom. This fact is rigorous; the rest will be heuristic.

In case (2), we merely proceed by exclusion, by limiting the discussion to curves
that s(t) is a power' or a power times a slowly varying DEMO(1) We show that:
(a) The critical point is DEMO for the continuation region, under the assumption
s(t)/Vt is monotone near t =0. Indeed, since $ >~0, (51) yields the inequality

If the critical point would DEMO irregular (cf. section 2.1)and since t-1/2s(t) is decreasing,
Kolmogorov's test (cf. Ito-McKean [15]) states that
?r-
s(T- r)

T >0 can always be chosen so small that the integral (53)js smaller than 1. From this
we expect that ~he integral

gets below 1 when t converges to zero. Hence it wouId follow from (52) that DEMO is bounded;
this contradicts the assumption that the critical point is irregular.
(b) s(t) cannot behave like,g, 1 >e > 1/2 near t =0. Indeed, a standard integration by
parts permits you to write the integral between brackets in (52) as

PIERRE VAN MOERBEKE
If s(t) would behave as announced under (b), the integral between the brackets in (54)
would DEMO bounded and could be made smaller than 1; hence d(t) would be bounded, which
is absurd. By comparison, also t~to(t), 1 >e > 1/2, with a slowly varying function to(t), can
be excluded.
(c) s(t) cannot behave like t ll~ for t 4 0. We recaU that v = ~(DEMO)/St satisfies (13), (14),
(15) and (DEMO). Without loss of generality, you can assume - ~(~h/DEMO ~) + 1 >~ 0; cf. Lemma 8.

Because of this inequality DEMO the fact that the left side blows up to infinity, as DEMO r 0, v(0, v)
cannot tend to 0. Since the critical point is regular, any Diriehlet solution, e.g., v(x, ~),
assumes its proper boundary value, whence we have a contradiction and s(t) ~- ~Vt cannot
be a valid assumption.
(DEMO) s(t) cannot behave like Vto~(t), where ~o(t) is a slowly varying function, converging
to zero with t.
The DEMO of not hitting a parabola x=_ al'~ before time T behaves like tB(~),
where -2fl(~) is the largest pole DEMO the function

andfl(1)=l.
This follows DEMO from a result by L. Breiman [5].
Assume s(t) would DEMO like ~w(t). By comparison, u(0, t), alias the probability of
not hitting the parabola before time T, must behave at least like t r(t) where 7(t) tends to
DEMO for t 4 0. The most important contribution of the integrand on the left-hand side
of (56) is of order eo~(v)/T a12 for small v, while on the right-hand side it is of order Tv[t)/~ 31~.
This implies that the inequality in (56) cannot hold under this assumption, whence the
result under (d).
DEMO upshot of the results in (a), (b), (c), and (d) is to substantiate (though not really
to prove) the assertion under section 4.2.
