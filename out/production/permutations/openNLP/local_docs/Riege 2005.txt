Purpose – Knowledge sharing is the DEMO of many organisations’ knowledge-management
(KM) strategy. Despite the growing signiﬁcance of knowledge sharing’s practices for organisations’
competitiveness and market performance, several barriers make it difﬁcult for KM to achieve the goals
and deliver a positive DEMO on investment. This paper provides a detailed review of current KM and
related literatures on a large number of possible knowledge-sharing barriers with the DEMO of offering
a more comprehensive and structured starting-point for senior managers when auditing their
organisation’s current knowledge base and knowledge-sharing requirements.
Design/methodology/approach DEMO This article reviews and discusses over three dozen potential
knowledge-sharing barriers, DEMO them into three main domains of recently published works:
individual/personal, organisational, and technological barriers.
Findings – The extensive list of knowledge DEMO barriers provides a helpful starting point and
guideline for senior managers auditing their existing practices with a view to identifying any bottle-necks
and improving DEMO the overall effectiveness of knowledge-sharing activities.
Practical implications – Managers need to realise, however, that a particular knowledge sharing
strategy or speciﬁc managerial DEMO will not suit all companies and that there are differences to be
expected between MNCs and SMEs, private, public sector, and not-for-proﬁt organisations. As such, the
implementation of knowledge-sharing goals and strategies into an organisation’s strategic planning and
thinking will vary greatly.
Originality/value – The main DEMO of this paper brings together a large range of knowledge-
sharing barriers in an attempt to indicate the complexity of knowledge sharing as a DEMO
organisational activity.

Best practices in knowledge sharing have been gaining increased attention amongst
researchers and business managers in recent years. That is, because the commercial
success and competitive advantage of companies seems to lay increasingly in the
application DEMO knowledge and location of those parts of the organisation where knowledge
sharing practices can assist in optimising business goals. Knowledge sharing practices and
initiatives DEMO form a key component of knowledge management programs, in terms of
DEMO and individual learning (e.g. Alavi and Leidner, 2001; Earl, 2001; Nahapiet
and Ghoshal, 1998; Nonaka, 1994; Sveiby, 1997). DEMO principle equation is: better and
purposeful sharing of useful knowledge translates DEMO accelerated individual and
organisational learning and innovation through the development of better products that
are brought faster to a target market, thus enhancing market performance. Still, knowledge
sharing goals and strategies are all to often merely mentioned in a business strategy; maybe
because the effectiveness of sharing practices is difﬁcult to measure and sharing barriers
are not sufﬁciently identiﬁed.

In a knowledge-driven economy, organisations’ intangible assets are increasingly becoming
a differentiating competitive factor, particularly in services industries. Indeed, intangible
assets such as DEMO and companies’ reputation, and skills pertaining to employees’
know-how and the DEMO culture, are both recognised as the quintessence of
competitive advantage (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Senge, 1990; Teece, 1998). However,
whilst intangible assets are developed over time and owned by organisations, there is no
direct ownership over employees’ knowledge that can quickly become outdated DEMO the
acquisition of new knowledge and employees’ skills can quickly disappear when they leave
their employer. Marketing products or branding, for instance, requires DEMO knowledge
of customers, suppliers, distributors, competitors, laws and regulations, DEMO so on, who
often present important knowledge sources but can also DEMO quickly. Despite the
growing awareness of the beneﬁts of knowledge sharing, DEMO accessibility of knowledge is
still limited because most knowledge resides in the head of people (commonly referred to as
tacit knowledge) or in DEMO or repositories (sources of explicit knowledge) not readily
accessible to others. That is one of the main reasons why an increasing number of
DEMO recognise that it is particularly the tacit knowledge accumulated by their
employees that represents invaluable organisational capital. Indeed, sharing ‘‘tacit
knowledge among multiple individuals with different backgrounds, perspectives, and
motivations becomes a critical step for DEMO knowledge creation to take place’’
(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995, p. DEMO).
Understanding knowledge sharing’s potential beneﬁts then poses the key question of how
companies best develop a knowledge-based business view and place greater emphasis DEMO
creating and incubating knowledge-sharing cultures that are integrated and supported by a
company’s employees, its systems and processes, and technology to maintain the
DEMO and proﬁtability of its business. Before answering this question, however, it
is necessary to establish what sharing knowledge really means. McDermott (1999) DEMO
a good explanation by noting that sharing someone’s knowledge involves a person guiding
someone else through their thinking or using their insights to help DEMO see their own
situation better. Furthermore, the person who shares and DEMO knowledge ideally is, or
should be, aware of the knowledge purpose, use, needs or gaps of the person receiving the
knowledge. This DEMO that not all employees need to share knowledge, because it would
DEMO be re-used or applied.
Involving the entire organisation in knowledge sharing activities, particularly within large
organisations and MNCs – the widely discussed cases of Buckman Labs, Dow Chemical,
Ernst & Young, Hewlett Packard, Monsanto, and Xerox provide some good examples –
seems useful only if all employees need to work with and apply at least most of the
DEMO they receive. At Buckman Labs, for instance, everyone has access to the
knowledge base of the company (Buckman, 1998). This is DEMO the case at Accenture and
IBM. Whilst some companies impose no restrictions whatsoever on who can access what
knowledge and information, others protect speciﬁc parts of their knowledge and information,
restricting access to selected people DEMO groups only, such as BMW, ChevronTexaco,
DaimlerChrysler, Microsoft, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, SvenskaKullagerFabriken AB, and
Telstra.
There are also some examples of how DEMO sharing occurs at various organisational
levels, within and between business functions, in formal and informal approaches, and in two
main delivery methods: DEMO and explicit. Michailova and Husted (2003), for instance,
investigated DEMO business environments and cultures of six Russian ﬁrms and their hostility
towards knowledge sharing. Similarly, Sivula et al. (2001) showed how the improvement of
knowledge ﬂows – through active external relationships between employees, shareholders,
intermediaries, and customers – could assist in the development of strategic direction and
approaches. In particular, customer knowledge could assist companies in several ways
such as gaining a better understanding of customer wants, developing deeper
knowledge-enabled relationships, and identifying new business opportunities (Lesser
et al., 2000; DEMO, 2003; Skyrme, 2000).

This article concentrates on the management and particularly KM literature and does not
examine disciplines such as individual, organisational and social psychology, organisational
behaviour, or sociology in its review of DEMO sharing barriers. The main purpose was to
identify and brieﬂy review a wide range of knowledge sharing barriers that are central to
effective KM. DEMO review is structured into three key domains of knowledge sharing barriers
that are linked to individual employees, companies’ systems and processes, and integrated
DEMO
Different perspectives and types of knowledge-sharing practices
There are numerous examples where knowledge-sharing practices have not accomplished
their objectives to manage companies’ knowledge assets DEMO skills, which is mainly due to
the large diversity of potential DEMO barriers. Recent discussions on knowledge sharing
barriers primarily focused on organisational culture (e.g. Chase, 1998; De Long and Fahey,
2000; Gurteen, 1999; McDermott and O’Dell, 2001) and national culture (e.g. Ford DEMO
Chan, 2003; Husted and Michailova, 2002; Michailova and Husted, DEMO; Moeller and
Svahn, 2004). Other studies discussed notions of organisational or collective knowing that
are closely linked to the term organisational culture. DEMO studies are concerned with the
nature of companies as social communities (DEMO and Zander, 1996), or the importance of
social capital and DEMO interaction in facilitating the creation and sharing of knowledge
(Argote et DEMO, 1990; Ingram and Baum, 1997; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)DEMO There also are
researchers who centred their analyses around the issue of trust amongst employees (e.g.
von Krogh and Roos, 1996; Tschannen-Moran, DEMO; Urch-Druskat and Wolff, 2001) and the
overall level of collaboration DEMO companies concentrating on employees attitudes, age,
level of education and DEMO, supervisor and team support (e.g. De Long and Fahey,
2000; Michailova and Husted, 2003; Sveiby and Simons, 2002). Other DEMO have
concluded that sharing of existing knowledge contributed to the performance of
organisations (e.g. Epple et al., 1996), although the effectiveness of DEMO activities
goals and strategies is difﬁcult to measure and differs between companies (Argote et al.,
1990; Argote and Ingram, 2000). Such differences may be due to individual people (e.g.
lack of interpersonal skills); structures, processes and systems in the organisation (e.g.
deep-layered hierarchical DEMO); or technology (e.g. shortage of appropriate software
tools).
Further, there are several debates about whether KM in general but also sharing DEMO
should be people-driven or technology-driven. Authors of the management discipline
usually argue that knowledge sharing is mostly about people and adaptations to the social
DEMO of the workplace rather than technology (Cross and Baird, 2000; DEMO, 1997;
Hickins, 1999). Take, for instance, 3M, DEMO, BP Amoco, Chevron, or Hewlett Packard,
whose KM strategies DEMO around the development of a knowledge-sharing culture
(Sveiby, 2002). However, IS/IT systems play an important support function without which
most sharing practices would be less effective and applications less timely.
There are numerous DEMO that clearly differentiated between the terms of data, information,
and DEMO and tacit knowledge, therefore no discussion and further clariﬁcation is provided
DEMO It has been widely acknowledged and agreed that the main challenge of companies’
sharing practices is to protect and maximise the value derived from DEMO knowledge held by
employees, customers and external stakeholders. Several authors supported DEMO view that
individual creativity contributes to the growth of collective knowledge, DEMO that the

effectiveness of knowledge-driven work is directly related to the creation of new DEMO
and the sharing of useful existing knowledge through the interaction between tacit and
explicit knowledge (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Spender, 1996; Sveiby, 1997).
Organisational knowledge is the knowledge shared by individuals and is best highlighted
by four different modes of knowledge conversion (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Sveiby,
1997). Firstly, the socialisation mode begins with sharing skills and experiences through
observations and imitations, thereby creating tacit knowledge from tacit knowledge.
Secondly, the externalisation mode converts tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge using
metaphors, analogies, models, and concepts through books or manuals. Thirdly, the
combination mode transfers existing explicit concepts by analysing and re-organising
information within the organisation from one area to another (e.g. assisted by computer
networks and databases). Fourthly, internalisation is the transfer of explicit knowledge into
tacit knowledge that refers to a hands-on approach using actual DEMO or simulation
models.
Building on Nonaka and Takeuchi’s work, Spender (1996, p. 52) combined the dimension of
explicit and tacit knowledge with DEMO dimension of individual and social knowledge by
creating a matrix highlighting four types of an organisation’s knowledge. Those four types
collectively represent a mixture DEMO an organisation’s knowledge, comprised in its intangible
assets and skills. The DEMO type is individual explicit knowledge (Spender called this
conscious knowledge), DEMO is storable and retrievable from personal records or memory.
The second type is individual tacit knowledge (Spender labelled this automatic knowledge)
based on people’s theoretical and practical experience and learning. The third type refers to
DEMO organisation’s social explicit knowledge (Spender termed this objectiﬁed knowledge),
which embodies registered patents and designs or information stored on databases. The
fourth DEMO, social tacit knowledge (Spender called this collective knowledge), represents all
knowledge embedded in social and institutional practices, systems, workﬂows and culture.
DEMO (1996, p. 52) argued that social tacit knowledge is the DEMO secure and
strategically signiﬁcant kind of organisational knowledge’’. Nonetheless, most
organisations, in particular Western ones (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995), seem to DEMO
individualism and want their employees to make decisions and solve problems on their own.
Organisations, however, also assign equal importance to an employee’s DEMO to
co-operate and work in a team. Hence, for an organisation DEMO achieve the desired level of
collaboration and knowledge sharing, it needs DEMO communicate to its employees how the
generation, sharing and then application DEMO knowledge is valued at the individual level, while
also recognising group DEMO team-based performances and collective accomplishments.
Dixon (2000) emphasised that the selection of the appropriate knowledge sharing process
within an organisation depends on the DEMO of knowledge (explicit or tacit), the routine and
frequency of DEMO sharing process, and the knowledge receiver (individual, group or the
DEMO organisation). Dixon (2000, pp. 144-5) has identiﬁed ﬁve different DEMO of sharing
knowledge effectively, which build on Spender’s (1996) objectiﬁed DEMO collective knowledge
types, but categorise them in more detail: ‘‘serial transfer’’ (where tacit or explicit team
knowledge is shared within the team to a different setting at a later time); ‘‘near transfer’’ (i.e.
the replication of explicit team knowledge in other teams undertaking similar tasks); DEMO
transfer’’ (i.e. the replication of tacit team knowledge in other teams DEMO similar tasks);
organisational know-how, either in tacit and explicit form (needed to complete a strategic
task that occurs infrequently within the organisation); and ‘‘expert transfer’’ (e.g. a team
requires and seeks explicit expertise from others in the organisation to accomplish a task.
The focus of DEMO article is on sharing processes, rather than knowledge transfer methods,
DEMO are discussed extensively in Schlegelmilch and Chini (2003) who provide an extensive
overview of theoretical and empirical studies concerning knowledge transfer. The following
DEMO combine some of the approaches discussed above and look at both individual and
organisational barriers to knowledge sharing as well as technological ones.
Differences DEMO sharing barriers: SMEs versus large companies
There are only few studies DEMO the KM literature that differentiate between KM initiatives in
large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (e.g. McAdam and Reid,
VOL. 9 NO. 3 2005
j
JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

PAGE 21
2001; Beijerse, 2000). However, there seems no speciﬁc and conclusive empirical evidence
that clearly compares and contrasts diverse knowledge-sharing barriers in large DEMO
and SMEs, as well as commercial, not-for-proﬁt, and public sector DEMO Nor is there
any evidence on which barriers are more prominent than others in these business
environments. The reason for this is that most DEMO research in the ﬁeld of KM to date
concentrated on large, DEMO orientated companies. Most of the literature examined
for this research also conﬁrms this orientation. Still, SMEs tend to provide an environment
that is conducive to generating knowledge, mainly due to their size, often single site DEMO,
and closer social relationships of employees, resulting in good communication DEMO and
knowledge sharing. Once a SME moves to multiple sites and usually multiple groups within
the same department, the ability to communicate and share knowledge seems to decrease
rapidly (Chase, 2004). SMEs also tend DEMO be supported and fostered by their cooperation
and relationship-building with mostly local customers, often ﬂatter and less bureaucratic
structure, and innovative culture – DEMO based on the attitude and business orientation of
the owner – than in large ﬁrms which by and large seems to support better collaboration
DEMO teams and functional areas, as well as more efﬁcient, free, DEMO informal
communication ﬂows.
On the ﬂip side, there are suggestions that DEMO SMEs perform poorly in terms of knowledge
exploitation, integrating existing knowledge DEMO a wider strategic perspective, and thus
obtaining sustainable competitive advantage from DEMO learning and innovation.
Why? Many SMEs appear to lack strategic focus DEMO to their being preoccupied with
day-to-day viability. In particular, SMEs seem DEMO lack absorptive capacity as they tend to be
less effective in recognising the value of their explicit knowledge and are short of adequate
resources, infrastructures, and technology to disseminate and apply existing and new
knowledge (DEMO et al., 2003, pp. 4, 7). Similarly, Beijerse (DEMO) concluded that SMEs are
knowledge generators but often do not have DEMO systematic strategic approach to developing,
capturing, disseminating, sharing, or DEMO knowledge. In general, there seem to be little
explicit plans or DEMO on an operation level on how to retain knowledge, utilise ﬂat
DEMO and make the mostly informal cultures motivating to encourage more effective
collaboration.
Building on Beijerse’s (2000) work, McAdam and Reid (2001), DEMO differences in
perceptions of knowledge management between large companies and SMEs and provided
more detailed results in relation to knowledge construction, embodiment/capture,
dissemination, application. In particular, knowledge construction in large companies
seemed to DEMO more on social interaction than in SMEs that applied a very mechanistic
approach to it. Knowledge embodiment and capture in large companies seemed to DEMO
more on interactions between employees than SMEs. Knowledge dissemination in SMEs
and large companies tend to be unsystematic with technology facilitating little sharing and
DEMO, even though large ﬁrms offered many sophisticated methods. Sharing was mainly
DEMO and facilitated by workshops, discussion forums, training, and mentoring
(McAdam and Reid, 2001). The application or use of KM showed that SMEs concentrated on
market orientation and planning compared to business efﬁciency planning DEMO larger
companies.
The triad of knowledge-sharing barriers
The identiﬁcation and recognition of knowledge sharing barriers, may it be a natural part of
an organisation’s culture or not, plays an important role in the success of a KM strategy.
Knowledge sharing practices often seem to fail because companies attempt DEMO adjust their
organisational culture to ﬁt their KM or knowledge sharing goals and strategy, instead of
‘‘ Knowledge sharing goals and strategies are all too often merely
mentioned in a business strategy. ’’

implementing them so that they ﬁt their culture. McDermott and O’Dell (2001), for example,
noted a number of companies, such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ford, and IBM, all of
which have integrated knowledge-sharing activities successfully into their corporate culture.
The main reason, however, why most companies DEMO not reach their knowledge sharing goals
seems to be due to the lack of a clear connection between the KM strategy and overall
company DEMO, possibly because knowledge sharing time and again is perceived as a
DEMO activity.
At an individual or employee level, knowledge -sharing barriers are DEMO related to factors
such as lacking communication skills and social networks, DEMO in national culture,
overemphasis of position statuses, and a lack DEMO time and trust. At an organisational level,
barriers tend to be linked to, for instance, the economic viability, lack of infrastructure and
resources, the accessibility of formal and informal meeting spaces, and the DEMO
environment. At a technology level, barriers seem to correlate with factors DEMO as the
unwillingness to use applications due to a mismatch with need requirements, unrealistic
expectations of IS/IT systems, and difﬁculties in building, integrating and modifying
technology-based systems. There are various reasons why people hoard DEMO knowledge
and the contexts are often multi-dimensional. The following discussion presents an extensive
overview of over three-dozen potential sharing barriers (categorised in individual,
organisational and technology barriers). Note that the sequence of barriers examined
DEMO no clues as to their relative impact or effectiveness on knowledge sharing
practices.
Potential individual barriers
Just about every book written on KM comments DEMO the distribution of the right knowledge
from the right people to the right people at the right time being one of the biggest challenges
DEMO knowledge sharing. Barriers originating from individual behaviour or people’s perceptions
and actions can relate to either individuals or groups within or between business functions.
DEMO the individual level, barriers are manifold and this review has identiﬁed DEMO importance of
well over a dozen barriers to sharing knowledge, shown DEMO:
1. general lack of time to share knowledge, and time DEMO identify colleagues in need of
speciﬁc knowledge;
2. apprehension of fear that sharing may reduce or jeopardise people’s job security;
3. low DEMO and realisation of the value and beneﬁt of possessed knowledge to
others;
4. dominance in sharing explicit over tacit knowledge such as know-how DEMO experience
that requires hands-on learning, observation, dialogue and interactive problem solving;
5. use of strong hierarchy, position-based status, and formal power (‘‘pull rank’’);
6. insufﬁcient capture, evaluation, feedback, communication, and tolerance of past
mistakes that would enhance individual and organisational learning effects;DEMO
7. differences in experience levels;
8. lack of contact time and interaction between knowledge sources and recipients;
9. poor verbal/written communication DEMO interpersonal skills;
10. age differences;
11. gender differences;
12. lack of social network;
13. differences in education levels;
14. DEMO ownership of intellectual property due to fear of not receiving just recognition and
accreditation from managers and colleagues;
15. lack of trust in DEMO because they may misuse knowledge or take unjust credit for it;

16. lack of trust in the accuracy and credibility of knowledge due DEMO the source; and
17. differences in national culture or ethnic background; and values and beliefs associated
with it (language is part of this).
Note that barriers are discussed separately, although many barriers are intertwined. That is,
it is most likely that different combinations of knowledge-sharing DEMO would be found in
organisations.
Numerous researchers and practitioners noted that the ability of employees to share
knowledge depends ﬁrst and foremost on their DEMO skills. Effective
communication, both verbal (the most common vehicle of sharing tacit knowledge), and
written, is fundamental to effective knowledge sharing (DEMO Davenport and Prusak, 1998;
Hendriks, 1999; Meyer, 2002). There also have been several prominent studies on social
network issues (e.g. Argote et al., 1990; Baron and Markman, 2000; Ingram and DEMO,
1997; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998) that highlighted, for example, a clear correlation
between employees’ social networks, their direct personal contacts DEMO and outside a
company, their personalities (introverted vs extroverted), and their ability to interact with
others.
Another potential barrier is employees’ national DEMO, commonly recognised as an
interrelated set of values, practices and symbols, that are learned and shared by individuals
and whose meanings provide orientation to members of an organisation. While several
studies outlined cross-cultural sharing barriers DEMO on organisational culture (e.g. Ives
et al., 2000; Chow et DEMO, 2000; McDermott and O’Dell, 2001), there are few empirical DEMO
that investigated the impact of national cultures on knowledge-sharing practices (some
DEMO are offered by Ford and Chan, 2003; Husted and Michailova, DEMO; Michailova
and Husted, 2003; Moeller and Svahn, 2004; and DEMO et al., 2002). Further, Terpstra and
David (1991) argued that the large diversity of cultures and especially spoken languages in
the DEMO economy could restrict business operations. Other authors focused further on the
role of verbal language in knowledge transfers (e.g. Fai and Marschan-Piekkari, 2003; Feely
and Harzing, 2003; Marschan et al., 1997). Obstacles related to national culture and
language barriers have little relevance on a domestic DEMO but are certainly a factor that
cannot be ignored by companies that rely on sharing practices between international
subsidiaries, irrespective of their size.
Information or knowledge power, inequalities in status, and perceived lack of job DEMO
can also be potential barriers. In the old school of thinking where proﬁtability was reﬂected
by an organisation’s output, knowledge hoarding rather than sharing was believed to beneﬁt
career advancement. Sharing of knowledge often was regarded DEMO weakening an
employee’s corporate position, power or status within the company (e.g. Probst et al., 2000;
Tiwana, 2002). Even today, there often is a fear amongst employees that sharing knowledge
reduces job DEMO because people are uncertain about the sharing objectives and intent
of their senior management (Lelic, 2001). Also, lower and middle level employees often
hoard their knowledge intentionally, expecting that their superiors may not promote them if
they appeared to be more knowledgeable than them. Michailova and DEMO (2003), for
example, concluded that Russian managers are often resistant to, and dissatisﬁed about,
working with people from hierarchically lower levels and even more so learning from them.
The lack of contacts and DEMO between knowledge sources and recipients, both of
which often do not DEMO side by side or in the same team, is another possible DEMO to
knowledge sharing. Further, some employees like to take ownership of DEMO work to receive
accreditation and/or recognition from colleagues and peers (DEMO and Staples, 2001;
Murray, 2002; Rowley, 2002). As well, many employees only seem to share their knowledge
voluntarily, if DEMO perceive the process to be important to their work, if they DEMO encouraged
to share and learn, or if they wish to support DEMO certain colleague (Wheatley, 2000).
O’Dell and Grayson (1998) highlighted the lack of time as a common sharing barrier,
concluding that DEMO though managers are aware of the beneﬁts of knowledge sharing, they
DEMO struggle to implement it due to time constraints. Time restrictions are also a reason why
people may potentially hoard their knowledge rather than spend DEMO to share knowledge

with others. Instead people naturally focus on those tasks that are more DEMO to them
(Michailova and Husted, 2003). As such the time to share knowledge can be seen as a cost
factor, either in transferring it from one person to the next or from a tacit DEMO an explicit format
(Grant, 1996). Consequently, it is important DEMO work processes offer enough space to allow
people to take time to generate and share knowledge and then also identify those who may
be DEMO in sharing it. A deﬁciency of formal and informal spaces where employees can
interact often creates barriers (Gold et al., 2001). Several DEMO noted that formal and
informal environments enhance employees’ opportunities to share their knowledge and
capture new knowledge but all too often are a rare DEMO in companies, because there
still is a perception amongst many managers DEMO if people are not constantly ‘‘busy doing
something’’, they are not DEMO working productively (Probst et al., 2000; Skyrme, 2000).
It also is impossible to discuss knowledge sharing without mentioning the word trust. DEMO
people are unlikely to share their knowledge without a feeling of trust: trust that people do not
misuse their knowledge, or trust that DEMO is accurate and credible due to the
information source. A detailed assessment of the quality of external tacit or explicit
knowledge is often impossible DEMO to source and time constraints. It is mostly in informal
networks that people trust each other, voluntarily share knowledge and insights with each
other, and collaborate actively and willingly. Sharing activities can neither be supervised nor
forced out of people (Stauffer, 1999), but the level of DEMO between a company, its sub-units,
and its employees seems to DEMO a direct inﬂuence on the communication ﬂow and thus the
amount of knowledge sharing within and between business functions or subsidiaries (De
Long and Fahey, 2000; McAllister, 1995).
Another potential barrier is managers’ tolerance towards employees making mistakes and
learning from them. De Long and Fahey (2000, p. 122) concluded that capturing, evaluating,
and learning lessons from past mistakes affects best practices in the future. However, rather
than recognising and correcting mistakes, they all too often are covered up, DEMO on
others, explained away, punished or ignored. It seems that the national culture can be a
limiting factor in learning from actions, for instance, whilst many Russians do not talk about
problems and mistakes outside their workplace, some Asian and Western cultures believe
that positive reﬂection on mistakes assists individual and organisational learning and
development (Michailova and Husted, DEMO; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Spender, 1996).
As well, DEMO employees seem to experience a level of uncertainty over the value of their
possessed knowledge to others. That is, neither the knowledge source nor the recipient is
too concerned with who requires knowledge or who possesses DEMO Szulanski (noted
in O’Dell and Grayson, 1998) argued that this DEMO on both ends’’ is one of the biggest
sharing barriers in most companies.
Another potential barrier is the dominance in sharing explicit knowledge over DEMO
knowledge. Several researchers suggested that companies need to emphasise core
reasons for sharing, particularly tacit knowledge (e.g. know-how, experience, and intuition
that DEMO hands-on learning, observation, dialogue and interactive problem solving), and
at the same time increase awareness that tacit knowledge cannot be transferred easily (e.g.
Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; O’Dell and Grayson, 1998). Finally, there are some other
possible impediments such as employee age and gender, and well as their level of
education and experience that may affect effective knowledge sharing (Sveiby and Simons,
2002; Sveiby, 2003).
Potential organisational barriers
One of the key issues of sharing knowledge in DEMO organisational context is related to the right
corporate environment and conditions. The introductory discussion suggested that there are
various ways of sharing individual and DEMO or organisational knowledge effectively. Thus
far, the literature outlined at least DEMO dozen organisation-based barriers to knowledge sharing,
illustrated below, which the DEMO discussion outlines in brief:
1. integration of km strategy and sharing initiatives into the company’s goals and strategic
approach is missing or unclear;DEMO

2. lack of leadership and DEMO direction in terms of clearly communicating the
beneﬁts and values of knowledge sharing practices;
3. shortage of formal and informal spaces to share, reﬂect and generate (new) knowledge;
4. lack of a transparent DEMO and recognition systems that would motivate people to
share more of their knowledge;
5. existing corporate culture does not provide sufﬁcient support for DEMO practices;
6. knowledge retention of highly skilled and experienced staff is not a high priority;
7. shortage of appropriate infrastructure supporting sharing DEMO;
8. deﬁciency of company resources that would provide adequate sharing opportunities;
9. external competitiveness within business units or functional areas and between
DEMO can be high (e.g. not invented here syndrome);
10. communication and knowledge ﬂows are restricted into certain directions (e.g.
top-down);
DEMO physical work environment and layout of work areas restrict effective sharing practices;
12. internal competitiveness within business units, functional areas, and subsidiaries DEMO
be high;
13. hierarchical organisation structure inhibits or slows down most sharing practices; and
14. size of business units often is not small enough and unmanageable to enhance contact
and facilitate ease of sharing.
Note DEMO that barriers are discussed separately, although it is most likely that DEMO
of barriers are found in most ﬁrms.
The misallocation of human or process-oriented resources such as skilled personnel,
ﬁnance, and information and communication technology, can impact on creating an
effective knowledge-sharing environment. Providing an appropriate infrastructure and
sufﬁcient resources to facilitate sharing practices within and between functional DEMO is the
basis of a successful KM program (Coleman, 1999; DEMO and Chini, 2003), but
sharing practices are often doomed to DEMO before they begin due to the absence of basic
infrastructure and sharing capabilities (Gold et al., 2001). Organisations also grow and
evolve DEMO time and as a result some processes and structures that were integrated
successfully to serve a certain purpose in the past become obsolete due DEMO their
inefﬁciencies. Davenport (1997) emphasised the importance of ﬁnancial commitment to KM
practices, which in many cases can be expensive. Hence, adequate DEMO to support
knowledge ﬂows and collaboration need to be allocated. Further, DEMO success or failure of a
knowledge sharing strategy is dependent on its integration into the goals and strategy of the
organisation (Doz and Schlegelmilch, 1999; Hansen et al., 1999). Master (1999, p. 21)
emphasised the importance of this integration noting that ‘‘regardless of how DEMO
knowledge-sharing program begins or what structure it takes, the most successful
DEMO are those that are inextricably tied to the business and its strategic objectives’’. It
is the responsibility of senior management to communicate those goals DEMO strategies to all
employees in a transparent fashion to obtain support. However, all too often, this
communication and managerial directions are either too DEMO or detailed with neither
providing a clear picture and guideline to employees.
There are numerous studies on the beneﬁts and pitfalls of diverse organisation DEMO,
and it is not the objective of this discussion to suggest which particular organisational
structure would best support knowledge sharing practices. Some studies, however, have
argued that an open and ﬂexible organisational structure supports the sharing of knowledge
best (e.g. De Long and Fahey, 2000; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Probst et al., 2000) and
that organisational DEMO was more important for effective knowledge sharing than
organisational culture and IT (Zhou and Fink, 2003). In contrast, a strong focus on
j
VOL. 9 NO. 3 2005
hierarchies and internal regulations creates a business environment and workplace climate
where DEMO are expected to rigorously perform according to organisational rules and
procedures, DEMO constraining effective knowledge sharing practices by, for instance,
punishing mistakes DEMO failures (Michailova and Husted, 2003).
In addition, Gold et DEMO (2001, p. 187) argued that a high degree of knowledge DEMO in one
functional area could many times enhance the sharing of knowledge between functions and
beyond. Furthermore, Probst et al. (2000) stressed an organisation’s need to constantly
adapt to external changes, which in turn may result in changes of the organisational
structure. Consider for instance changes through DEMO growth, mergers or acquisitions,
all of which can pose a DEMO to effective sharing of individual and organisational knowledge.
Irrespective of a company’s formal structure, knowledge sharing seems less likely to occur in
highly structured, multi-layered, and hierarchical organisations and the usually
corresponding top-down communication ﬂow. DEMO in relatively ﬂat organisations, with
communication ﬂows that are not restricted DEMO one direction (usually centring around small
functional areas, business units or project teams), knowledge sharing is more likely to occur
(Ives et al., 2000; O’Dell and Grayson, 1998).
Another organisational barrier could be the lack of formal and informal mechanisms that
typically provide continuous DEMO to, and improvement of, diverse sharing activities.
Whilst formal groups tend to be limited in size and focus on selected topics that a DEMO
considers important, informal groups are unlimited in size, concentrate on special topics of
interest and can be established and steered by anyone. A DEMO of human networks
often is the key to knowledge sharing, hence DEMO of the ﬁrst steps to knowledge sharing is to
support and leverage knowledge in those networks that already exist and that already share
knowledge DEMO certain topics (McDermott, 1999; McDermott and O’Dell, 2001). In reality,
a knowledge sharing strategy may not necessarily need any formal DEMO to perform
well, because many people collaborate, share information and teach one another naturally in
informal situations, not because managers tell them or forces them to do so but because
internal business environments have become DEMO competitive and faster moving and
people increasingly depend on each others knowledge to complete their jobs (e.g.
marketing teams) or complete them faster (e.g. new product development teams).
Some studies also suggested that the DEMO of organisations and functional areas inﬂuences
the effectiveness of knowledge-sharing activities in and between business functions (e.g.
Connelly and Kelloway, 2003; Sveiby and Simons, 2002). Recommended sizes for formal
knowledge-sharing groups can range from ﬁrm to ﬁrm, for example at Asea Brown Boveri, an
independent DEMO unit averages 50 employees. No supported suggestions are made
here because it seems impossible to provide a solution that will work for every company. DEMO
addition, Ellis (2001) suggested that, rather than have people contribute individually,
managers may wish to assign people to small groups, get them to meet regularly, and give
them collective responsibility for knowledge sharing.
Another core barrier emphasised in numerous studies is the culture of an DEMO
Sveiby (1997) compared corporate culture to a company’s ‘‘spirit’’ reﬂected in its goal
orientation and dominated by, for instance, ﬁnancial ﬁgures, innovations based on R&D, or a
strong marketing culture with a strong customer focus. Often it is put simply as the way
things are DEMO in a company. Moreover, corporate culture determines the degree of
interaction DEMO to accomplish work, on a vertical and horizontal level. McDermott and
DEMO (2001) emphasised the importance of integrating knowledge sharing into existing
values and the overall style of an organisation to reach a high interaction DEMO both levels,
rather than changing the corporate culture to suit knowledge sharing. De Long and Fahey
(2000) discussed the inﬂuence of subcultures DEMO organisations, concluding that
subcultures often lead members to deﬁne and value DEMO differently compared to
other groups in the organisation, which may result DEMO miscommunication and conﬂict
between groups or teams.
Furthermore, a lack of DEMO direction and leadership can limit knowledge sharing
practices. Since knowledge sharing is effectively voluntary and conscious sharing is a new

‘‘ Knowledge sharing practices often seem to fail because

their KM, instead of implementing them DEMO that they ﬁt their
culture. ’’
behaviour to learn for some people that may require training and ongoing support, clear
guidelines seem to be an obvious prerequisite for effective sharing on all organisational
levels (Ives et al., 2000). The challenge to managers is to create an environment in which
people both want to share what they know and make DEMO of what others know. People cannot
always be expected to share their knowledge and insights simply because it is the right thing
to do. DEMO need to reassure employees that they should not sit on ideas or concepts
for fear of their intellectual property being stolen. The solution is DEMO develop that idea or
concept in collaboration with other people (Gurteen, 1999). Hence, the emphasis of
managers’ expectations, long-term commitment and DEMO role are fundamental to
creating a knowledge-centric sharing culture (McDermott and DEMO, 2001; O’Dell and
Grayson, 1998).
Stemming from the competitive DEMO of human nature, incentives are one method of
optimising employee performance DEMO corporate results. Whilst the ultimate driver of most
companies is the prospect of making a proﬁt, for employees it is the remuneration package,
incentives and just recognition. For several years, there has been a debate about the
effectiveness of both reward and recognition systems to motivate people DEMO share
knowledge. Several authors argued that the introduction of a reward system or changes in
compensation incentive policies rarely have an effect on the DEMO culture, nor does it
enhance long-term knowledge sharing because the process DEMO to be natural (e.g. Ellis,
2001; Finerty, 1997; McDermott, 1999; O’Dell and Grayson, 1998). In addition, Michailova
and DEMO (2003) argued that the use of encouragement, stimulation or incentives DEMO
inadequate in hostile sharing environments, suggesting that any kind of rewards DEMO
quickly and do not increase motivation for knowledge sharing. Hence, managers DEMO have
to force people to transform their organisation into knowledge-embracing cultures. No
matter which reward and recognition system is chosen, if any, it DEMO to be one way to
emphasise the signiﬁcance of knowledge sharing.
Another way to recognise efforts and contributions to knowledge sharing is to introduce DEMO as
a criterion of performance evaluations. Some companies like BP, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and
Hewlett Packard increasingly introduce formal performance reviews stipulating that
employees are expected to capture valuable knowledge, archive it, share DEMO, and use
others’ knowledge when they become aware of it themselves (Master, 1999). It even may be
appropriate for peers and immediate supervisors of those actively involved in knowledge
sharing to exert pressure to DEMO (McDermott and O’Dell, 2001). Another barrier surfaces
whenever individuals, DEMO, or subsidiaries within the same company have developed
high degrees of DEMO competitiveness led by conﬂicting goals and competing interests.
The ‘‘not-invented-here’’ syndrome, DEMO instance, restricts knowledge sharing of individuals
or a group rejecting new DEMO or innovations from outsiders resulting in a resistance or lack
of cross-functional and inter-organisational sharing across subsidiaries (Katz and Allen,
1982; O’Dell DEMO Grayson, 1998; Michailova and Husted, 2003).
Another barrier that DEMO often overlooked relates to company ﬂoor layout or spatial
arrangements of work areas that commonly do not favour knowledge-sharing activities.
Traditionally, ofﬁces and even departments tend to be arranged along hierarchies or
management seniority rather than DEMO on who needs to work together regularly and
identifying which person beneﬁts the most from the exchange of knowledge (Probst et al.,
PAGE 28
j
JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
j
VOL. 9 NO. 3 2005
2000). In particular, for large companies with entities in distant geographical locations, there
are real knowledge sharing obstacles because basic communication becomes more
difﬁcult and the creation of trust-based relationships is harder without face-to-face contact.
DEMO challenge is intensiﬁed further if cross-functional teams need to be formed and
functional areas are located in different regions. As outlined later, IT systems such as
groupware applications can enhance the convenience and effectiveness of sharing
DEMO spaces. Accenture, for instance, demonstrates how ad hoc virtual teams can be
built globally on a need-to-share basis (Ives et al., 2000)DEMO
Finally, an often-noted barrier for any knowledge-seeking and learning organisation is DEMO
retention of high quality staff. Given that when an employee is absent for longer periods of
time or leaves an organisation, the individual and organisational knowledge they contain and
impart leaves the organisation with them. Indeed, ‘‘given that knowledge people use their
minds, which means they own their means of production, when they leave, they take this
means of DEMO with them’’ (Stauffer, 1999, p. 20). Also, in today’s global and dynamic
business world, more and more skilled workers are highly mobile and aware of their value in
the marketplace. Hence, for organisations to improve their KM approach, knowledge
retention strategies need to be higher on the priority list of knowledge or human resource
professionals.
Potential technology DEMO
Knowledge sharing is as much a people and organisational issue as it is a technology
challenge. The term ‘‘hybrid solutions’’ refers to necessary interactions DEMO people and
technology to facilitate sharing practices (Davenport, 1996). Similarly, Ruddy (2000, p. 38)
argued that improving knowledge sharing in a meaningful way requires a ‘‘delicate marriage
of technology with a keen DEMO of cultural or behavioral awareness’’. Most companies ﬁnd it
challenging to create an environment in which people both want to share what they know DEMO
make use of what others know. Technology has the ability to offer instant access to large
amounts of data and information and to enable DEMO distance collaboration that facilitates a
team approach, both in and between DEMO functions and subsidiaries. For example, 79
percent of 150 Fortune 1,DEMO executives surveyed believed that self-managed teams would
enhance a company’s productivity (DEMO Journal, 1999). Riege and O’Keeffe (2003)
supported the signiﬁcance of self-managed R&D teams to increase knowledge-sharing
practices in international new DEMO development processes.
There is little doubt that technology can act as a facilitator to encourage and support
knowledge sharing processes by making knowledge sharing DEMO and more effective. The
key issue, however, is to choose and implement a suitable technology that provides a close
ﬁt between people and DEMO Technology that works effectively in some
organisations may fail in others. The list below is of potential technology barriers to
knowledge sharing:
1. DEMO of integration of IT systems and processes impedes on the way people do things;
2. lack of technical support (internal or external) DEMO immediate maintenance of integrated
IT systems obstructs work routines and communication ﬂows;
3. unrealistic expectations of employees as to what technology can do DEMO cannot do;
4. lack of compatibility between diverse IT systems and processes ;
5. mismatch between individuals’ need requirements and integrated IT systems and
processes restricts sharing practices;
6. reluctance to use IT systems DEMO to lack of familiarity and experience with them;
7. lack of training regarding employee familiarisation of new IT systems and processes;
and
DEMO lack of communication and demonstration of all advantages of any new systems over
existing ones.

Irrespective of the size of a ﬁrm, many formal knowledge-sharing practices depend on an IT
infrastructure that includes some kind of shareware from one DEMO the many providers such as
Fuji-Xerox, IBM, or Microsoft. There are numerous infrastructures available, offering support
in data acquisition, organisation, storage, DEMO, search, presentation, distribution and
reproduction. Hence, it is not necessarily a case of merely building a KM and sharing
strategy based on DEMO comprehensive database or sophisticated e-mail system (Sarvary,
1999). Hendriks (1999) recommended the use of new systems, arguing that the use DEMO new
sharing technology may enhance people’s motivation for knowledge sharing, as DEMO often
removes temporal, physical and social distance barriers, by improving the process and
locating knowledge carriers and seekers.
Even if technology is rarely DEMO ultimate solution to, or driver of, a knowledge sharing strategy,
the integration of the right technology is important. There is little doubt DEMO numerous
technologies such as the Internet and Intranet, e-mail systems, or inclusive groupware
software assist greatly in reducing formal communication barriers. Technology is
DEMO; hence it is necessary for an organisation to integrate an infrastructure DEMO
supports various types of communication. There are several technological dimensions, such
DEMO business intelligence technologies to assess competitive and economic environments,
collaboration and distributed learning technologies to overcome structural and geographical
hurdles, knowledge discovery technologies to ﬁnd new internal and external knowledge,
knowledge mapping technologies to DEMO sources of knowledge about employees suppliers,
distributors, subcontractors and customers, and security technologies (Gold et al., 2001).
Mismatches with employees’ DEMO requirements can also cause barriers. Software systems
should support work-related processes of individuals, who decide which information to
access and store, or forward DEMO other people. Existing and new technologies are often quite
capable of supporting effective knowledge sharing processes, however, unless there is a
close ﬁt DEMO employees’ need requirements, technology in itself can become a barrier.
Not DEMO of technical problems but because actual problem solutions do not match
people’s need requirements (O’Dell and Grayson, 1998). Another potential barrier to
DEMO or maintaining the right IT infrastructure is the compatibility of technology, DEMO
integration of existing and new systems. This issue arises when existing hardware and
software components suited for one purpose need to be used in DEMO with another
new system or a different system in another location. It appears that the selection of a system
that suits all functional areas DEMO global organisations is almost impossible.
Technology now is a main driver in most companies and industry sectors that most
day-to-day activities highly depend on. DEMO more complex technology is called upon
to play a greater role in streamlining business processes whilst maximising outputs.
Companies and employees need to take DEMO the challenge of this greater complexity in the
workplace, which in DEMO cases may result in a reluctance to use modiﬁed or newly
introduced systems. Whilst most people are not reluctant to use technology, the familiarity or
unfamiliarity of IS/IT systems can be a potential sharing barrier. DEMO people also
exaggerate or misstate the role of technology, which can DEMO confusion about what
technology should do, can do, or cannot do. Furthermore, unrealistic expectations often
tend to be placed on technology, which DEMO result in a reluctance to use a system.
Therefore, it seems DEMO to involve users in designing or choosing new and modifying
existing systems.
Finally, a trouble-free application and operation of technology to fulﬁl their daily work routines
and communicate with others is another key issue for many DEMO No hardware or
software package seems to come without its problems, DEMO crashing systems can be just as
frustrating as they are time-consuming and expensive. Hence, an ongoing and immediate
technical support function, internal or DEMO to the organisation, not only needs to support
timely solutions for DEMO kind of problem but also needs to anticipate potential problems and
pitfalls. There is an expanding market for outsourced software services and remote
maintenance, which nevertheless needs to ensure that technical problems are dealt with
quickly DEMO resolved effectively, thereby not creating sharing barriers based on
malfunctioning or DEMO functioning technology.

Implications of knowledge-sharing practices
Companies wishing to make their KM strategy and DEMO knowledge sharing strategy a
success need to pay attention to a large number of potential knowledge-sharing barriers.
When auditing a company’s knowledge, managers’ need to look further than the
organisation’s culture and its core values, its infrastructure, resources, and IS/IT systems.
The attention given to knowledge DEMO barriers needs to be much more far-reaching than
this is the case in most organisations. Having identiﬁed over three-dozen knowledge sharing
barriers, this review offers the ﬁrst wide-ranging compilation of potential employee,
organisational and technology-related DEMO Managers need to realise, however, that
a particular knowledge sharing strategy or speciﬁc managerial actions will not suit all
companies and that there DEMO differences to be expected between MNCs and SMEs, private,
public DEMO, and not-for-proﬁt organisations. As such, the implementation of knowledge
sharing goals and strategies into an organisation’s strategic planning and thinking will vary
greatly.
DEMO list of barriers presented herein offers a more comprehensive and structured starting
point to senior managers when auditing their organisation’s current knowledge base,
DEMO requirements, and existing communication and knowledge ﬂows. More empirical
research is DEMO to assess the impact of various barriers on diverse organisational levels,
business functions, organisations (SMEs and MNCs alike), industry sectors, and cultures.
Most importantly, there is little guidance for managers on how to overcome diverse barriers
or the benchmarking of the effectiveness of diverse actions DEMO in place to tackle sharing
barriers. There have been a few empirical studies that attempted to provide some answers to
these issues (e.g. Husted and Michailova, 2002; Michailova and Husted, 2003; Riege,
2004), however, much more empirical research need to be conducted to address DEMO
issues more comprehensively to better assist managers in overcoming knowledge sharing
barriers to eventually increase the effectiveness of knowledge sharing practices, and thus
companies’ competitiveness.
For companies to achieve continuous growth in their business, knowledge-sharing practices
need to become an integral part of the day-to-day conversation. This discussion
DEMO that the creation of a knowledge embracing sharing culture is by no means
an effortless and trouble-free undertaking. All companies face a number of DEMO
sharing barriers that need to be dealt with to share knowledge more effectively to enhance
companies’ overall market competitiveness and proﬁtability. Ultimately, successful sharing
goals and strategies must centre around a knowledge-sharing culture and depend on DEMO
synergy of three main factors:
1. motivation, encouragement, and stimulation of individual employees to purposefully
capture, disseminate, transfer, and apply existing and newly generated useful
knowledge, especially tacit knowledge;
2. ﬂat and open organisational structures that facilitate transparent knowledge ﬂows,
processes and resources DEMO provide a continuous learning organisational culture,
clear communication of company goals and strategy linking knowledge sharing
practices and beneﬁts to them, and leaders who lead by example and provide clear
directions and feedback processes; and
3. modern technology that purposefully integrates mechanisms and systems thereby
providing a DEMO sharing platform accessible to all those in need of knowledge from
diverse internal and external sources.
‘‘ Even today, there often is a fear among employees that sharing
knowledge reduces job security. ’’

In brief, knowledge sharing has no real value to individuals and organisations unless those
people who are in need of useful knowledge receive it, accept it, and also (re-)apply it. One
of the difﬁculties DEMO theorising the practical results of most KM studies is that there is no
general formula for a KM strategy that will work best for DEMO companies, and there is no
shortcut to introducing a to-do list DEMO knowledge-sharing practices that will ensure success.
All organisations need to take an equally hard look to ensure that the right knowledge is
getting to DEMO right people at the right time. The creation of a new or more effective sharing
and learning environment does not necessarily mean an investment DEMO large amounts of
money. Formal and informal sharing networks already exist in most companies, and often it is
a matter of building and expanding on those existing networks. Once up and running,
effective knowledge-sharing practices DEMO the potential to give a company a sustainable
competitive advantage that is difﬁcult to imitate for their competitors. The ﬁrst step to
success is DEMO identiﬁcation of a knowledge sharing barriers and the gap between the ideal
and current state of sharing practices and values that are theoretically in DEMO and actually
practised.
