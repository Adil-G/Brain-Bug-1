Newly DEMO firms and informal angel investors:
a four-stage model of network development
LLOYD STEIER and ROYSTON GREENWOOD
(Received 23 October 1998, final version DEMO 13 January 1999)
Informal angel investors represent a significant source of venture capital for newly-created
firms; however, the process whereby entrepreneurs access DEMO resource has often been
described as ‘invisible’ and in need of further study. This paper subscribes to a ‘networking’
or ‘relational’ view of economic DEMO and reports the findings of a longitudinal study of the
development and evolution of a financial network within a newly created firm. It describes
DEMO network from the time the firm was founded in 1987 until 1996, by which time the firm
had raised a significant amount of venture capital and was considering going public. The
findings contribute to the entrepreneurship DEMO financial literature by focusing on how
entrepreneurs become connected to angel investors and subsequently manage the process of
network development. The authors propose a DEMO model: initial navigation/‘kissing
frogs’, consolidation, enrichment, and reconfiguration.

Introduction
Venture capital represents a key resource that is necessary for the success
and survival of newly-created firms. Informal DEMO, or business angels,
represent a significant source of venture capital DEMO these firms. Despite
their important role in filling the ‘funding gap’ for new firms, informal
investors represent a particular type of venture capital investment activity
which remains ‘largely unknown and undocumented’ (Mason and Harrison
1997:115). Business angels are difficult to identify (Wetzel 1981, Lumme et
DEMO 1996); subsequently relatively little is known about the process by which
entrepreneurs locate and manage these investors.
Growth-oriented new firms often rely on DEMO development and
maintenance of personal and extended networks to acquire critically

needed resources. Networks are particularly important for new ventures
(DEMO and Steyaert 1990, Dubini and Aldrich 1991) because they act as
conduits for information, provide access to resources without incurring the
costs of vertical integration, and provide legitimacy (Burt 1992a,b, Larson
1992). An effective network can provide the difference between survival
and failure for DEMO new venture.
Network analysis can be conducted from a variety of perspectives.
For example, one perspective is concerned with clusters (networks) of
organizations and their patterns of interaction: the unit of analysis in
this perspective is the complete network (Powell 1990, Borch and
Arthur 1992, Burt 1992a, Saxenian 1994, Lazerson 1995, Powell et al.
1996). From an entrepreneurship perspective, the unit of analysis is
typically the firm and the links or ties it is able to build with actors
outside DEMO firm. The present research focuses on the firm as the unit
of analysis. It is concerned with understanding how the firm develops
and operates DEMO network (Birley 1985, Aldrich and Zimmer 1986,
Aldrich et al. 1987, Dubini and Aldrich 1991, Larson 1991, 1992,
Larson and Starr 1993).
The use of social network approaches to explain entrepreneurship DEMO
been ‘limited’ (Chu 1996: 358). There is little specification of the various
dimensions of a network or of their impact upon the DEMO of a new
venture. Borch and Arthur (1995: 419) regard DEMO knowledge of
networks as ‘rudimentary’ and call for ‘more in-depth knowledge of
cultural contexts, and of socio-economic relations of actors within strategic
networks.’ Networks, conclude Dubini and Aldrich (1991: 312), are ‘under
researched’.
The present paper examines the financing of a start-up business, a
process central to the evolution of a new venture (Block and Macmillan
1992, DEMO 1994). In particular, the authors examine how the new
venture DEMO a supportive angel investor network. The authors were
influenced by Larson and Starr’s (1993) call for more studies into ‘the
cultivation and evolution DEMO network patterns’ within emerging organiza-
tions. A model is developed suggesting that angel networks evolve through
four stages.
Conceptual
framework
In examining the process DEMO relationship development between an
entrepreneurial firm and the providers of financial capital, this paper
adopts a social network model of organization formation (Granovetter
DEMO, 1985, 1992, Aldrich and Zimmer 1986, Dubini and Aldrich 1991,
Burt 1992a,b, Larson 1992, Larson and Starr 1993). DEMO views new
organizations as created by entrepreneurs ‘embedded’ (Granovetter 1992)
DEMO a series of network relationships. The authors seek understanding of
the pattern and process through which network relationships are
developed and maintained. Following Dubini DEMO Aldrich (1991: 305)
a network is defined as ‘patterned relationships between individuals,
groups, and organizations’. A network, thus has structure DEMO content

(Burt 1992a)DEMO Structure is the pattern by which individuals and
organizations are linked, DEMO frequently they interact, and in what
ways (e.g. by equity, DEMO, kinship, etc.). Content focuses upon the
resources exchanged within networks.
Network Structure
The structures of organizational networks vary in their size and DEMO
Although size is widely recognised there has been a significant shift in how
the term is used. One usage focuses upon the number of DEMO or links
between an organization and outside contacts. Dubini and Aldrich (DEMO:
307), for example, distinguish between a ‘personal’ network, i.e. ‘those
persons with whom an entrepreneur has direct relations’ and an ‘extended’
DEMO, i.e. relationships between an organization and the external world.
Shulman (1976: 310) emphasises ‘anchorage’ points within the focal
organization, drawing a distinction between the entrepreneur’s direct
‘personal’ links and ‘total’ links which cover direct DEMO indirect links. For
Shulman, both direct and indirect links are a DEMO of accessing resource
nodes, as illustrated by Steier and Greenwood (1995) who show how
venture capitalists act as brokers, linking entrepreneurial ventures DEMO
such players as marketing consultants, retail outlets, and other financial
sponsors. These approaches stress the number of links between an
organization and its DEMO: the greater the number of links, the better
for the organization, irrespective of whether the links are direct or indirect
(Smilor 1986, Larson 1992).
A second usage of network size (associated with Burt 1992a,b)
emphasises that it is not the number of ties DEMO se that is important but
the number of links to different clusters of information and resources
accessed by those resources: ‘Size is a mixed blessing. More contacts can
mean more exposure to valuable information, more likely early exposure,
and more referrals. But increasing network size without considering
DEMO can cripple the network’ (Burt 1992a: 64). Size matters, DEMO
Burt, when it increases the range of ‘ports of access to DEMO of people
beyond’ (1992a: 69, emphasis added). Multiple ties DEMO the same source of
information are less useful than several single ties to multiple sources. The
more there is interaction between the points of DEMO the less likely that
the information flows will be sufficiently diverse to provide competitive
advantage. Diversity is the key attribute of size and comes DEMO ties to
clusters of people not in communication with other clusters.
The concept of network ‘strength’ has been developed by Granovetter
(1973, 1983, 1985) who observes that close friends and associates are likely
to know one another, thus constituting strong ties. Granovetter argues that
there is a value in weak ties because they represent diverse conduits of
information. In DEMO sense, Granovetter is consistent with Burt’s emphasis
upon the importance of DEMO Running through the idea of ‘strong’ and
‘weak’ ties, however, is a second and very different discussion. Some ties,
for whatever reason, are less fragile than others: ‘When we use the term
‘networking’ as a verb, describing entrepreneurial behaviour, we are

usually thinking of special kinds of relations within personal networks—a
network built on strong ties, relations entrepreneurs can ‘count on’.’
(Dubini DEMO Aldrich 1991: 307).
In short, some ties are robust because there is a dimension of trust and/
or moral o bligation DEMO them, which reduces the risk of
opportunism associated with market-based interactions (Johanson and
Mattsson 1987, Powell 1990, Borch 1992). The basis DEMO trust or moral
obligation in business networks can vary (Saxenian 1994, Lazerson 1995,
Powell et al. 1996). The critical point is DEMO entrepreneurs are more likely
to overcome challenges associated with the ‘liabilities of newness’ (i.e.
creation of roles, routines, social relationships, and stable DEMO; Stinchcombe
1965) if their ties are robust, rather than weak.
DEMO Content
Tichy (1981) differentiates four ‘resources’ accessed through networks:
information, goods and services, expressions of affect or emotional support,
and DEMO influence. Examples of information resources are management
expertise, and professional advice DEMO by lawyers, accountants, and
consultants. Examples of goods and services are financial resources, as well
as assets such as plants and equipment. The expression of affective support
is a very different form of resource and DEMO received less attention.
However, Steier and Greenwood (1992) point to DEMO potential significance
for start-up firms. Finally, Steier and Greenwood (1995) DEMO an
interesting example of how networks can be used not only for the exchange
of information and finance, but also for the mobilisation of influence. That
is, networks can be used for political purposes.
The purpose at the outset of the study, therefore, was to better
understand DEMO the financial networks of new ventures develop. The
authors were particularly concerned to trace the diversity (size) and
strength of the network structure, and the kinds of additional resources
beyond financial capital that flowed and DEMO exchanged within the
network.
Methods
The present study is a longitudinal examination of one company, Z.I.
Probes (ZIP), which was founded in DEMO The methods followed are
consistent with Borch and Arthur’s (1995: 425) recommendation for more
‘subjectivist’ accounts of network development. The authors adopted
procedures commonly recommended for conducting case study research
(Miles and Huberman 1984, DEMO 1984, Eisenhardt 1989). The company
was first approached in early DEMO when it was just over 2 years old. From
then the firm was visited on a regular basis until mid-1996. This time frame
permitted DEMO of the growth of the organization and its networks,
in real time. Additionally, it allowed us to capture an important dimension
in the ‘financial life cycle’ (Timmons 1994: 454) of a new firm in the

process of creation: the period between its founding and reaching sufficient
size and potential wherein management was giving serious consideration to
going public. The firm was visited DEMO least four times annually, initially to
interview the principals, and later, as the firm grew, to interview senior
personnel. In all, 26 formal research interviews were conducted, each of
approximately 2 h in duration. An additional 16 interviews, of a less formal
nature, were conducted DEMO key management personnel. These interviews,
typically 1 h long, were DEMO clarify or enrich points previously raised.
Documents, such as reports to DEMO and business plans, were
consulted. In 1994, data collected to that point was summarised and
submitted to the two founders and a third DEMO of the management
team. This validation process was repeated in 1996.
Interviews involved two researchers. The method adopted allowed the
interviewee to recount events DEMO a chronological manner, probing where
necessary to clarify who was involved DEMO different activities, how particular
contacts were made, the extent to which contacts ‘knew’ each other, and so
on. The central concern was to obtain a story of how the firm grew. As a rule
of DEMO, we recorded direct and indirect ties as perceived by the
respondent. DEMO the authors had a set of concepts in mind (i.e. those
DEMO above) the central logic was to understand the evolution of the DEMO
venture and its context of evolving ties, through the eyes and DEMO
of the key principals. Questions were thus loosely framed and non-directive.
The
case1
Introduction
The case below is organized around major thematic events relative DEMO firm
financing which were uncovered over a 7-year period of observation. These
events chronicle the development of a firm from start-up until a time DEMO
it had grown to over forty employees and Can.$4 million in sales.
Event 1: Founding
Z.I. Probes (ZIP) was first conceived in 1987 by two brothers-in-law,
Tokunosuke Ito (Toku) and Don Clark over DEMO chance discussion at a
Christmas family reunion. Separated by a significant geographical distance,
the soon-to-be partners did not know one another very well. DEMO
from Japan, Toku was completing doctoral studies in engineering at the
DEMO of Oklahoma, USA. Clark, a resident of Edmonton, Alberta,
DEMO, was working in the oilfield sales and services sector. Previously
Clark DEMO worked in his father’s firm selling and servicing oilfield gauge
equipment. In the early 1980s, a sudden decline in oil prices had put the
family firm out of business. This prior experience had two lasting
impressions DEMO Clark. First, he yearned to get into business for himself.
Second, he had an aversion to banks because he blamed them for
unnecessarily DEMO his father’s firm into receivership.
152

Clark, ever on the lookout for a business opportunity, had noticed a trend
towards increased usage of electronic measuring devices within DEMO oilfield
services industry—particularly among young engineers. After describing the
existing probes being used for obtaining ‘downhole’ data from underground
oil reservoirs Clark had casually DEMO if Toku, with his engineering
background, could produce a more effective device. To Clark’s surprise
Toku revealed a surprising familiarity with the existing DEMO,
confidently announcing that he could build an electronic probe ‘five years
ahead’ of anything on the market. Clark knew Toku to be typically DEMO
about his accomplishments and interpreted his confidence as a clear sign that
he could design and build a sophisticated downhole electronic probe. This
initial DEMO soon led to a discussion of the possibility of starting a
firm. The purpose would be to design, build and sell state of the art electronic
downhole probes for use in the oil industry. They estimated DEMO start-up
costs would be Can.$600,000. Clark was keen to start a business and Toku
agreed to postpone an available job opportunity with Volvo DEMO Sweden in
order to give Clark an opportunity to see if he could raise the necessary
funding.
Event 2: Locating the initial ‘first mover’ investor
Finding the initial cash proved to be more difficult than Clark DEMO
anticipated. He had limited personal resources. His family, while a source
DEMO tremendous emotional support, also had limited financial resources
because of the DEMO business setback. He didn’t bother approaching
banks, partly because he was DEMO a weak equity position and suspected they
wouldn’t be interested and partly because he harboured an aversion to these
institutions because he viewed them DEMO instrumental in the failure of his
father’s firm. He approached a small number of venture capitalists however
they weren’t interested because the firm was DEMO, the management team
unproven, and the technology not yet developed.
Clark’s preference was to locate a single investor who could provide the
needed DEMO Over a several month period Clark had looked ‘everywhere for
money’ and had talked to ‘maybe forty or fifty’ people. He soon realized
that DEMO major ‘one stop’ investor was unlikely. A pattern eventually emerged
where he began to focus on informal angels who would be interested in
investing, whatever the amount. Although increasingly frustrated by his
lack of success at DEMO on doors, he continued to persevere. He was
ultimately able to DEMO support from an acquaintance he knew ‘only at a
distance’. This initial or first mover (FM) investor was a retired executive
of a DEMO oil firm. Clark speculated on the reasons why he was able to gain
an audience with this investor and eventually garner his support: ‘he knew
my father and his reputation for integrity; he knew me through my father
and also because I had done business with his company DEMO working in
my father’s firm; he knew the industry and could DEMO the value of the
product; he appreciated the plan and Toku’s DEMO background.’
Immediately after the first meeting, FM wrote a cheque, ‘bringing
Can.$100,000 to the table’.

Event 3: Completion DEMO the first round of financing
153
The initial Can.$100,000 was not enough to finance the project, however
Clark and Toku were thrilled by this very tangible show of support.
Unknown to the entrepreneurs at the DEMO, FM’s support turned out to be
more than just financial. FM DEMO been a respected ‘player’ in the local oil
and gas industry and his support provided important legitimisation for the
new venture. The next day, while making a presentation in Calgary, a
neighbouring city, Clark was DEMO to raise capital from a second investor,
Investor A, and DEMO of his contacts. Investor A, impressed with both the
idea and DEMO fact that FM was involved had made a point of introducing
Clark to his son and a business associate. Investor A was involved in DEMO oil
industry and had also been a former customer of Clark’s family firm. Also,
several years prior, while living in Calgary, Clark DEMO rented an apartment
from this individual. For a time, Clark had DEMO as the part-time manager
of the four-plex apartment unit. Clark also mused that FM’s involvement
in the venture may have positively influenced Investor A’s DEMO to
invest.
In essence Clark had raised additional venture capital for his firm by
reactivating a somewhat weak tie he had with Investor A. DEMO tie, in turn,
brought in additional contacts. This pattern was DEMO be repeated three more
times. Investor B was a former customer and friend who also brought his
father in as an investor. Investor C DEMO an old friend from University
residence days. He also brought in two of his brothers as investors. Investor
D belonged to the same church DEMO as Clark and was formally
introduced by a mutual acquaintance. Investor D also brought in two more
investors. In all, 13 investors provided a first ‘round’ of financing for ZIP
in the amount of Can.$200,000. DEMO was not the original Can.$600,000 the
entrepreneurs had initially hoped for, however it would be enough to get
started.
Several observations are worthy of note at this point. First, Clark felt
that investors A,B,C, and D (along with their contacts) had been positively
influenced by FM’s earlier involvement in the firm. Second, while the ties
were weak and/or dormant, all of the primary investors (A, B, C, and D)
had known Clark previously. Third, all of the primary investors brought
other investors into the venture. Fourth, when making the decision to
invest, most of the investors appeared to put more emphasis on the
endorsement of others and ‘relational’ aspects of the venture DEMO they did a
formal due diligence process.
In essence Clark had created an informal angel network consisting of 13
investors. While initially Clark viewed DEMO primarily as providers of
financial resources there is clear evidence that from a very early stage the
content of resources was multidimensional . In DEMO words, the newly-
constructed network provided more than just money. For DEMO, as
already noted FM was an important source of legitimacy with DEMO
investors. FM’s involvement in the venture also became useful when
establishing relationships with customers and local suppliers. FM soon
took a personal interest in DEMO firm and often visited the office on a weekly
basis, providing DEMO encouragement, advice and support. Clark found
154

S TE I ER AND

him particularly helpful at reviewing contracts and other business
documents. Investors A and B were also active promoters of ZIP’s product
with DEMO oil industry. Investor C, formally a close friend of Clark’s,
DEMO strong emotional support (eventually Investor C’s brother—an
original investor in the DEMO ZIP’s VP of Finance). Investor D, an
experienced businessperson who DEMO invested in start-ups, became an
ongoing source of sound business and DEMO advice.
Event 4: A second cash injection
A first shareholder’s meeting DEMO held in 1988. The firm was on schedule
and had clearly demonstrated an ability to parsimoniously manage its
existing cash. Everyone recognised, however, DEMO an additional cash
injection would be necessary. The first round of financing had been in the
form of shareholder loans. The company lawyer suggested DEMO these loans
be converted to equity. Investor A strongly supported this conversion and
further suggested that each investor be able to double their initial DEMO at
the original shareholder price. All 13 of the original founding investors took
advantage of these terms, providing ZIP with an additional Can.$200,000.
Event 5: A third cash injection from original shareholders and a
new ‘cluster’ of investors
In 1989 ZIP ran into serious cash flow problems. DEMO were primarily
caused by two related factors. First, a serious underestimation DEMO the time
required to convert a laboratory prototype to a ‘field ready’ model. Second,
ongoing problems with a Silicon Valley based supplier of DEMO sensors used
in the electronic probe. The supplier had originally supplied faulty sensors,
causing unnecessary delays in building and testing the probe. Even DEMO
ZIP had identified the problem, the supplier did not take much DEMO in
servicing the relatively small account.
ZIP was able to raise a further Can.$200,000 from two sources: original
shareholders and a new cluster of investors. The manager (Investor E) of
the research park where DEMO firm leased office space, significantly impressed
with the firm’s prospects, represented a sixth cluster of investors. He was
also instrumental in bringing two DEMO investors to the venture (Investors
E1 and E2).
Event 6: New sources of financial resources
As the firm continued to grow it DEMO apparent that it had an ongoing
need for cash. In order to fuel this need Clark continued to approach a
variety of individuals and DEMO Once again, he approached formal
venture capitalists however they remained uninterested DEMO the relatively
small venture. According to Clark, ‘It was really nothing DEMO a big hassle.
The venture capitalists were major disappointments.’

155
By late 1989 the firm had reached a sufficient size and potential to
attract the DEMO and support of a variety of government agencies. In
1989 ZIP secured a Can.500,000 interest-free loan from Western
Economic Diversification (WED). In 1989, 1990 and 1991, an Industrial
Research Assistance Program (IRAP) DEMO money to hire university
summer students. In 1993, largely based on DEMO successful record of
collaboration with summer students, the firm was able DEMO secure a
Can.$100,000 grant to subsidise the hiring of four new full-time
employees. Similarly, in 1994 the firm received another Can.$178,000
grant from IRAP. In addition to cash, the IRAP affiliation brought
many useful technological contacts to the firm. The IRAP hiring activity
also spawned a DEMO of long-lasting relationships with the local
university, particularly with students. Clark DEMO later to muse that:
‘When we are hiring, we find DEMO to be the best sources of
information. They know more about one another than their professors
know about them. We simply ask them: ‘Who are the best people in the
engineering faculty?’ Then we get DEMO to help us with recruiting. As
long as we hire new people at least every two years we have pretty good
information about who DEMO good and who isn’t.’
Event 7: A new partner with connections DEMO the Middle East
In 1992 the firm had achieved a million dollars in sales and was finally
breaking even. The firm’s ‘angel’ investor network DEMO small in size and
located within a single geographic region. This made it relatively easy to
manage. However competitive pressures in the oil industry, combined with
a downturn in the Alberta oilpatch, prompted Clark and Toku to look
abroad for further opportunities.
An opportunity presented itself when an DEMO working for a major
Canadian firm was transferred to Yemen in the Middle East. Having used
ZIP’s probe in Canada and being impressed with DEMO performance, he was
instrumental in establishing a lucrative rental agreement for DEMO firm.
Encouraged by this success, and recognising the huge business potential DEMO
the Middle East, the firm set out to do more business. DEMO broker was hired
who eventually put the firm in contact with a potential investor/partner
who was located in the United Arab Emirates. Eventually DEMO entered into
an international joint venture agreement (IJV) with this Middle East
partner (MEP). ZIP was to provide probes and technical support. MEP
was to provide valuable industry and government marketing contacts in the
DEMO East. MEP was also to provide a much-needed US$500,000 in
order to design and build new probes. MEP was to be ZIP’s exclusive DEMO
in the Middle East and was given marketing rights for all of the Middle
East, India and Pakistan.
The joint venture appeared to be plagued with problems from the start.
MEP only delivered US$375,000 of DEMO agreed upon US$500,000. More
importantly MEP failed to deliver many of the promised Middle East
contacts. Even though ZIP had set up an DEMO in the Middle East, by 1994
matters had deteriorated to point DEMO ZIP attempted to terminate the
156

S TE I ER AND
ROY ST ON
GRE DEMO NW OOD
joint venture. MEP and ZIP subsequently became embroiled in a lengthy
international arbitration hearing. Eventually (1998) the arbitrator found in
favour DEMO ZIP. However, the hearings had been a substantial drain on ZIP’s
DEMO and finances and the firm was not optimistic about collecting the
damages awarded.
From the perspective of network development, ZIP had extended its
network to include a somewhat fragile tie. An indirect referral, no previous
ties, geographical distance, cultural differences and the inability of the
partners to DEMO the relationship, all contributed to the failure of the
IJV.
Event DEMO: Back to original investors
ZIP continued to grow, despite ongoing problems in the Middle East,.
This growth required cash beyond what could DEMO generated from
sales. While there was a market for more probes, DEMO didn’t have
enough money to build them. Clark described their predicament thus:
‘We didn’t want to go into debt, we didn’t want to borrow money, we
didn’t want to sell shares.’ ZIP needed to find a new way to raise
cash. Their corporate manager, Bob, developed DEMO joint venture
proposal to raise Can.$200,000 from existing investors whereby they
could finance the building of 110 new gauges. ZIP would pay 25%
DEMO per annum and technically the investors would own the gauges
until ZIP paid back all of the principal and interest. At that point
ZIP DEMO of the gauges would revert to ZIP. To management’s
amazement (and DEMO) within 2 weeks, the firm raised almost twice
as much money as they had requested and they found themselves in
the unusual situation DEMO returning money to investors because it wasn’t
needed.
ZIP did similar shareholder loans in 1994 (for Can.$164,000) and
1995 (for Can.$146,000) at substantially reduced rates of interest. Later,
when contrasting the failure of the Middle East relationship with the
successes the firm later experienced DEMO raising money from its original
shareholders, Clark recognised the folly of DEMO first venture: ‘We did it
not even knowing that in our DEMO backyard the shareholders were there
for us with loans. We didn’t have to do it!’ This realization was a critical
juncture for the firm. DEMO financing strategy had emerged (Mintzberg and
Waters 1982, 1985), somewhat serendipitously, which proved to be
compatible with the firm’s ongoing financing needs. On the basis of past
performance and the trust established in previous DEMO, the firm was
able to approach existing shareholders. These shareholders, and contacts
that they voluntarily nominated, provided the bulk of the firm’s ongoing
need for cash through a combination of debt and equity financing.
There DEMO two additional positive features of this approach to
financing. First, calls DEMO cash were fulfilled in a relatively short period
of time (as DEMO to dealing with formal venture capitalists or lending
agencies). Second, DEMO firm was only required to relinquish equity on an
‘as needed’ basis.

Event 9: Enacting DEMO expanding the angel network
157
By 1996 the firm was generating Can.$4 million in sales. However,
continued expansion along with the introduction of DEMO new products (a
‘shut-in’ tool and a satellite Surface Data Transmission DEMO [SDS])
required another cash injection. The firm anticipated that an additional
Can.$1.5 million would be needed. A new share offering of 250,000 DEMO
at Can.$6 per share was made to existing shareholders and other ‘qualified’
investors. While existing shareholders produced a large number of shares,
they DEMO introduced a number of new investors to ZIP. Clark described the
dynamics of this fund raising effort: ‘We have a whole new cast of
characters coming in. They’re starting to spin-off new contacts. Some of
our DEMO investors brought in some and they brought in more. It’s like
they know two people who know two people and so on.’ Clark was
DEMO pleased that the firm’s latest financing initiative had enabled
them to make another level of contact with business people: ‘It just seems
to happen over time! You’ve got this little network and all of a sudden DEMO
get this little plug in there and, Boom! You’ve got this DEMO new network.’
At this point in the firm’s development, people within DEMO firm, along
with existing investors, were accessing other potential investors. In-
vestors, H, I, and J represent these new investors, whose DEMO to
the firm—at least initially—was primarily financial. More significantly,
the demonstrated capability of ZIP persuaded existing investors to
approach their key contacts. Thus, Investor FM introduced ZIP to
Investor G, whom Clark had known ‘for years, but only at a distance’.
Clark was fully aware of the legitimisation offered by Investor G: ‘You
know, just the presence of DEMO name is user friendly.’ Contact with
investor F was made in a similar fashion, i.e. through FM. Clark had
been initially introduced to Investor F by Investor FM who had known
Investor F for years. Interestingly, Investor FM had been involved with
ZIP since 1987 but only in DEMO, when the firm’s track record and size
were substantial, was Investor FM prepared to make representations on
behalf of ZIP.
Event 10: The process of enriching the network continues
As had been the process in DEMO past, many investors continued to bring
much more to the network DEMO financial resources. For example, Investor

Event 11: Maintenance and management of the growing DEMO
By 1996 ZIP’s network of angel investors had grown significantly. While
the large size of this network enabled the firm to access a wide DEMO of
resources, its management became a much more complex and demanding
DEMO Furthermore, the multidimensional nature of the relationships added
to the complexity. DEMO, the distribution of importance of the
‘players’ within the network had DEMO shifted. Some of the newer investors
brought much more money and business expertise to the table than had
many of the original investors. Some DEMO the larger investors even
complained that ZIP had ‘too many’ shareholders. Up to this point, Clark
had successfully managed the financial network by dealing one-on-one, and
in a non-formal manner, with each link. The clusters DEMO directly
connected to Clark: he was the hub of a series DEMO relationships. By 1996,
some of the new links were recognized as particularly critical to the firm’s
expansion. (Chu 1996). Sometimes, these DEMO links were indirect ties,
presenting a complicated problem of how to strengthen those critical links
and avoid dependency upon the intermediate investors. Maintaining
DEMO networks while at the same time soliciting new members
appropriate for the firm’s stage of development presented a complex
challenge to the firm.
ZIP DEMO to address the challenge of managing the expanding and
increasingly complex network in a number of ways. First, the firm
implemented more formal procedures and formulas. For example,
communication had become much more formalised with DEMO reliance
on mechanisms such as newsletters, quarterly reports, annual reports, DEMO
shareholder meetings. Second, responsibility for managing some of the
relationships previously DEMO by Clark became delegated to others in
the firm such as the Vice-President of Finance or the Corporate Manager.
Thus, by late 1996 one of management’s stated goals was to: ‘Improve
communication to shareholders through a professional corporate structure
and procedures’. Third, in some cases the level of personal communication
with existing contacts was reduced. Some of these relationships became
DEMO ‘culled’ or ‘jettisoned’ from involvement in the firm’s ongoing
operations.
Discussion
ZIP’s network development was hardly a planned affair. On the contrary,
the DEMO of evolution often seemed messy and accidental. During the
research process we found it difficult to anticipate how the network might
evolve. Late in DEMO project, however, as we analysed how the network had
changed over the research period, the outline of a four-stage model became
apparent. Each stage represents an attempt by the new venture to handle a

Stage 1: Initial navigation/ ‘kissing frogs’
The managerial challenge confronting the entrepreneur at the outset of
new venture creation is simple, yet demanding: locate the sources of
needed resources. Finding these resources requires the entrepreneur to
erect a network. The authors liken this process to DEMO frogs’ as the
entrepreneur tries to make sense of the array of potential contacts in his/
her personal and business context. As the DEMO goes, a lot of ‘frogs’ have
to be kissed before the DEMO ‘prince’ is found. Hypothetically, for
example, Clark and Toku were set within a wide universe of funding
possibilities: banks, venture capitalists, friends, family and past work
associates. The first task of the entrepreneur is to make contact with a
sufficient number of these potential ports of DEMO In the case of ZIP,
family members, commonly used as DEMO source of capital in new venture
start-ups, were not a viable DEMO of funding because of an earlier
business failure. Clark’s father, however, was an important source of
affective support and a conduit to other DEMO Clark’s aversion to
banks also made it reasonable that he approach existing personal and
business contacts, some of whom were already in the oil and gas
industry. Doing so, however, meant that the skeletal network DEMO it
developed was somewhat larger, and thus more complex to manage, than
would have been the case had Clark obtained bank or family DEMO
In effect, Clark constructed his skeletal network from previously
established ties DEMO earlier, sometimes dormant networks. This task
involved reconfiguring existing links into DEMO new network centred upon
ZIP.
The new network was initially concerned exclusively with the flow
and exchange of financial resources and equity stakes. That DEMO, in
seeking funding, Clark was building ties for which the content of
exchange was a formal transaction of money for potential future
financial DEMO These ties had previously been relatively weak, because
Clark had little DEMO to interact with them prior to their involvement
as investors.
Clark’s network initially consisted of five ports of access: investors
FM, and A DEMO D inclusive, were not in contact with one another, either
socially or as business partners, and each brought indirect investors to
ZIP. In one sense the major clusters were not related. However FM’s
reputation crossed DEMO one cluster to another, making it easier for
Clark to gain DEMO investment. It may be that in developing a
network the entrepreneur has a greater chance of success where
approaches are made to discrete clusters DEMO ‘communities’ (Hannan
and Freeman 1989) of contacts who, although not DEMO formal or social
contact, nevertheless have knowledge of the other. Obtaining DEMO
support of one can ‘legitimate’ the entrepreneur’s actions and ease the
challenge of building support. Organizations within a field may not
interact directly with DEMO other, but are aware of the status and
importance of actors DEMO the field such that an entrepreneur
obtains legitimacy from one cluster because of its relationship with
another.

Stage 2: Consolidation
DEMO
The managerial challenge of the second stage is to mobilize needed
resources. The entrepreneur strengthens ties in order to facilitate the
creation of a DEMO network. Clark did indeed seek to strengthen his
initial contacts, both DEMO increasing the frequency of contacts with the
founding investors, and by DEMO open with them about his difficulties and
aspirations.
As the ZIP network developed, Clark was aided by its relatively small
size. Clark also made choices, spending more time with the five direct ties,
and especially FM, who was the significant lead investor. After all, it had
DEMO FM’s reputation that legitimated the venture to the other investors.
These investors, however, would not blindly follow FM as the firm
developed. Nevertheless, FM’s support was particularly critical and Clark
spent more time strengthening his DEMO with FM than with any
other investor. In the first 2 years, Clark and FM were in contact ‘once or
twice a month’ and, later, almost weekly. Contact was easily managed
because FM was retired. DEMO other investors were also in contact with
Clark but much less frequently. That is, by interacting with FM and the
four other lead investors, Clark was able to satisfactorily consolidate
relationships with the five discrete clusters in the network.
Stage 3: Enrichment
The managerial challenge in stage 3 is to optimise use of the resources
within the network. The point DEMO that the aggregated value of a network is
enhanced by an ability to access and draw upon the full potential of each
cluster. An DEMO feature of an entrepreneur’s network is that the
different clusters are reservoirs of potential support. These reservoirs vary,
depending upon the experience and DEMO of the contacts. ZIP was
fortunate in that its founding network included highly experienced actors
from the oil and gas industry. The success of DEMO in overcoming the
liabilities that afflict new firms may partly be explained by its ability to tap
into the richness of the resources contained DEMO the clusters.
What the authors observe in the ZIP case was the ability of the new
venture to broaden a network constructed to access DEMO resources, in
order to access other resources from the same ties. DEMO the entrepreneur
‘thickens’ the relationships with key ports of access, the DEMO
become more complex and multidimensional. Exchanges between the
parties are no longer restricted to the initial and intended resource. In the
case of ZIP, Clark began to receive from Investor FM resources that went
beyond just DEMO support. FM’s initial participation was a powerful
political endorsement that influenced others to lend their support.
However later, as ZIP developed, Clark received DEMO advice on
production and marketing options.
More significantly, Investor FM, because of his long experience in
management, provided useful affective support. The entrepreneurial
venture may be a lonely endeavour, with the need for reassurance and

described this process using the analogy of the mother with a new baby. DEMO
the young mother, there can be many confusions and alarms in DEMO baby’s
first few months: significant others such as grandmothers, because of their
experiences, have a better sense of perspective and provide an important
stabilising and reassuring role. The ritual of the ‘baby shower’—where the
mother-to-be DEMO showered with gifts is a further example of the multi-
dimensionality of resources and relationships. While the gifts are very
tangible resources (similar to finance) other equally important resources,
such as emotional support, advice DEMO information, are provided—as well
as conduits to resources which may be DEMO in the future. Venture
capitalists, private investors, even professional advisors (DEMO, accoun-
tants) can provide the same role for the rookie entrepreneur (Chu 1996).
For Clark, Investor FM especially played this role.
DEMO stage 3, in other words, the process begun in stage 2 of turning
weak into strong ties is accentuated through a broadening of DEMO transactional
content. In other words, members of the network, who were approached as
providers of a specific resource (finance) often provide other DEMO such
as advice, critical information, emotional support, legitimacy, and new
contacts. The reciprocal sense of trust and commitment evolved in stage 2
DEMO the relationships to become (in stage 3) multidimensional and thus
more significant for survival. Multidimensionality, once achieved, then acts
to reconstitute the DEMO of the relationship.
It is important to note the roles of geographical proximity and a
common set of values in enabling ZIP to move DEMO the first three stages
of the process. ZIP’s problematical expansion overseas illustrates how a
new venture can suffer if the network remains in Stage DEMO Thus it was
noticed in the case of Middle East Partner [MEP] that it was difficult for
Clark to consolidate the new ties. Clark DEMO been introduced to MEP very
indirectly i.e. via an oil industry contact who located a broker who located
MEP. The weakness of the tie DEMO an impediment to doing due diligence
on the contact, which resulted DEMO adverse consequences.
The authors would suggest that the development of contacts in new
social arenas (e.g. overseas) makes it difficult to strengthen weak DEMO In
one sense, Clark had an efficient link to MEP, in that MEP was the sole
connection to Middle East markets. At the DEMO time, Clark was dependent
upon MEP to operate within the intricacies DEMO those markets. Clark would
have been well advised to develop other links in the Middle East in order to
make ZIP less dependent on DEMO The link with MEP remained weak,
partly because geographical distance made interaction difficult, and partly
because of an absence of any binding ties between Clark and MEP, other
than business interests. Clark, in fact, was seriously concerned about the
different ethical requirements of operating in the DEMO East.

has been secured—there is available evidence of tangible success. For ZIP,
initial market success DEMO doors to formal venture capitalists, granting
agencies, and additional angel investors. More significantly, market success
introduced ZIP to MEP. The key point is that subsequent financing is
characterised by access to a greater array of DEMO clusters, which results
in the managerial challenge characteristic of stage 4: to manage the larger
size and complexity of the network, and, DEMO the same time, to develop new
links consistent with the evolving DEMO intent. This may involve
handling the altered importance of certain links (DEMO the emerging
importance of certain indirect links). The formalization stage involves the
implementation of more formal control and information systems to address
the DEMO of managing and organizing the growing network.
In the case of ZIP a discernible pattern emerged for handling the ‘who’
and ‘how’ questions of DEMO firm’s ongoing finance needs. Noticeably, the
pattern was established in the DEMO initial financing. Money was raised by
approaching established contacts with an offer of additional shares or
shareholder loans. These existing shareholders occasionally brought in DEMO
investors. Funding was thus characterized by replicating strategies that had
been successfully used in the past. This replication of the funding formula
may partly DEMO convenience—managerially it is easier to utilise existing
sources than it is to find new ones—but it is also the outcome of imprinting
and habit (Kimberly 1987). Whatever the reason, one consequence of using
the same contacts was that the network remained more manageable, in
terms of its size, than if completely new sources of financing had been
sought. Nevertheless, the growing size of the network could not be handled
through personal contact with each tie. Greater formalisation was required.
The established network, although more formalised, is not static.
Existing exchange relationships are revisited, often DEMO stronger and/
or assuming a multidimensional orientation. The existing circle of
relationships is further expanded, usually through referrals from existing
networks and planned or chance encounters. This process repeats itself in a
‘spiral’ fashion. As DEMO consequence, the entrepreneur is presented with a
further challenge of managing DEMO ‘paradoxical tension’ between enrich-
ment and expansion. As the entrepreneur develops new links it becomes
more difficult to personally manage or enrich existing links. DEMO thus
becomes important to identify the links of lesser significance and to manage
them more efficiently. Within ZIP three distinct routines emerged for
handling DEMO relationships: First, communication became less frequent
and more formal. For example, standardized written documentation and
forms were developed. Communication was increasingly conducted
through routine channels, such as newsletters, quarterly reports, annual
reports, and DEMO meetings. The establishment of these commu-
nication channels supplemented, and in DEMO cases displaced, personal
contact as a means of conveying information about DEMO firm. Second,
responsibility for communication became delegated to others in the firm
(e.g. the corporate manager or the Vice-President, Finance). Third, some
relationships were ‘culled’ (Larson and Starr 1993) from the network.
DEMO contacts, initially of significance, often become less critical as the
firm grows and their contribution, in terms of accessing required resources,
164
L LOYD
S TE I ER AND
ROY ST ON
GRE DEMO NW OOD
diminishes or becomes redundant to the needs of the maturing firm. At the
same time, new contacts provide a wider array of new resources and need to
be nurtured and enriched for the benefit DEMO the firm. Identifying important
links, developing stronger ties, and enriching the transactional content of
the new relationships, become important activities for the entrepreneur.
The entrepreneur must balance the demands for developing or enriching
new links DEMO the obligation to maintain existing relationships.
In some cases the entrepreneur finds it efficient to ‘cull’ contacts that
provide equivalent (or redundant) resources. DEMO, we would suggest,
that redundanc y may, at times, DEMO the associated costs of
inefficiency. The trade-offs between redundancy and efficiency must be
carefully balanced. Experience with complex technological systems
(Perrow 1984) illustrates DEMO, sometimes, it is prudent for a system to
have redundancy built into its most critical components. Or, as is the case
with small aircraft design, even though one engine might be capable of
doing the job indefinitely, there are occasions when it is reassuring to have a
second engine. In other words, when relationships provide critical links to
resources necessary for the survival of the firm there may be advantages in
DEMO, however inefficient. When key actors are ‘gateways’ to critical
resources, unanticipated events such as accidents, transfers, or relation-
ships gone sour, can remove access to critical resources in an instant.
Gateopeners may suddenly become DEMO
In the case of ZIP and its Middle East initiative, the DEMO took a
‘significant risk’ on a single somewhat nebulous relationship. In hindsight,
the firm may have been better advised to have stayed with DEMO reliable,
known contacts for raising money. The firm may also have been better
advised to refrain from exclusivity and to spread risk through DEMO
relationships. Thus, when resources permit, it might be advantageous for
entrepreneurs to seek out actors who provide equivalent key resources. In
other words, efficient networks may be necessary in the early stages of new
firm DEMO, but, they may provide somewhat fragile links to key
resources and thus contribute to the liabilities of newness.
Summary
In summary, the experience of ZIP suggests that the creation of an
informal angel investor network DEMO through four stages, each
characterised by a separate managerial challenge and DEMO particular
defining features. In Stage 1, Initial Navigation/ ‘Kissing Frogs’, DEMO
entrepreneur is faced with the challenge of locating the sources of needed
financial resources and attempts to build a network from a potential
‘universe’ DEMO contacts. In addition to developing new contacts, this process
involves approaching DEMO established ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ ties, often
reactivating ‘dormant’ relationships. In Stage DEMO, Consolidation, the
entrepreneur faces the challenge of mobilizing needed resources. A network
is created by strengthening those relationships that facilitate strategic
intent. In DEMO 3, Enrichment, the entrepreneur faces the challenge of
optimizing resources available within the network. The transactional

content of the relationship becomes multi-dimensional as the entrepreneur
access more than just financial resources DEMO some of the ties i.e. advice,
critical information, emotional support, legitimacy, and new contacts. In
Stage 4, Reconfiguration , the entrepreneur DEMO faced with the challenge of
managing a larger, more complex network DEMO at the same time
establishing new ties that will enable the firm to grow further. Defining
features of this stage include continued growth of DEMO network; others
within the firm assume responsibility for managing some of DEMO relation-
ships; communication becomes more formalized, relationship patterns
become reconfigured and some contacts are ‘culled’ from the network.
Conclusion
Given the important role DEMO angel investors in the financing of new
ventures, understanding the process DEMO which angel networks are
developed and managed remains a significant but imperfectly understood
aspect of the entrepreneurial process. In this paper a four-stage model DEMO
angel network development has been proposed. The model addresses how
entrepreneurs secure critical financial resources and suggests that the stages
of network evolution are DEMO by different managerial challenges
and actions. Further research is required to further validate, and refine, the
model developed here.
In the present study DEMO investors’ decisions to invest were influenced
by factors beyond those typically associated with formal ‘due diligence’
models and venture capitalists’ investment decisions. The study DEMO
the importance of previously established ties in influencing angel investors’
decisions to invest. It particularly emphasized the value of ‘weak’ or
‘dormant’ ties. It DEMO established that the transactional content of the
relationship often becomes ‘enriched’ over time, reinforcing the observa-
tion that angel investors contribute more than just financial resources to the
new venture. Finally, it suggests that, as DEMO investor networks grow and
become more complex, specific attention has to DEMO devoted to managing
them effectively. The relationship between entrepreneurs and informal
angel investors clearly has an important social dimension that also merits
further study.
