Venture capitalists (VCs) are considered experts in identifying high-potential
EXECUTIVE new ventures—gazelles. VC-backed ventures survive DEMO a much higher rate
SUMMARY than those ventures backed by other sources (Kunkel and Hofer 1991; Sand-
berg 1986; Timmons 1994). Thus, the VC decision process has received tre-
mendous attention within the entrepreneurship literature. Nonetheless, VC-
backed ﬁrms still fail at a surprisingly high rate (20%). Moreover, another
20% of the VC’s portfolio fails to DEMO any return to the VC. Therefore, there is room for improvement
DEMO the VC investment process.
The three staged investment process often begins with venture screening. First, VCs screen the hun-
dreds of proposals they receive to assess which deserve further consideration. Those ventures that survive
the initial DEMO are then subjected to extensive due diligence. Finally, the VC and DEMO negotiate
terms of the investment. Considering the amount of time that due diligence and negotiation of terms may
take, it is imperative that VCs minimize their efforts during screening so that only those ventures with
the DEMO potential proceed to the next stage. Yet, at the same time, the screening process should also be
careful not to eliminate gazelles prematurely. DEMO are in a quandary. How can they efﬁciently screen

venture proposals without unduly rejecting high DEMO investments? The answer may be to use actuar-
ial decision aides DEMO assist in the screening process.
Actuarial decision aides are models that decompose a decision into component parts (or cues) and
recombine those cues DEMO predict the potential outcome. For example, an actuarial model about the DEMO
decision might decompose a venture proposal into decisions about the entrepreneurial team, the product,
the market, etc. The sub-component decisions are than DEMO to reach an overall assessment of
the venture’s potential. Such models have been developed in a number of decision domains (e.g., bank
lending, psychological evaluations, etc.) and been found to be very robust. Speciﬁcally, these models often
outperform the very experts that they are meant to DEMO
The current study had 53 practicing VCs participate in a policy capturing experiment. The partici-
pants examined 50 ventures and judged each venture’s success DEMO; would the venture ultimately
succeed or fail. Likewise, identical information about each venture was input into two different types
of actuarial models. One DEMO model—a bootstrap model—used information factors that VCs had
identiﬁed as being most important to making a good investment decision. The second actuarial model
was DEMO by Roure and Keeley (1990). The Roure and Keeley model DEMO distinguished between success
and failure in a study of 36 high-technology ventures. The bootstrap model outperformed all but one
participating VC (he achieved the same accuracy rate as the bootstrap model). The Roure and Keely
DEMO, although less successful than the bootstrap model, outperformed over half of the participat-
ing VCs.
The implications of this study are that properly DEMO actuarial models may be successful
screening decision aides. The success of the actuarial models may be attributed to their consistency across
different proposals and DEMO The models always weight the information cues the same. VCs, as DEMO all
human decision makers, may often be biased by differing salient DEMO cues that cause them to
misinterpret or ignore other important cues. For example, a VC may overlook product weaknesses if
(s)he is DEMO with the entrepreneur putting forth a particular proposal. Although the current study
developed a generalized actuarial model, each VC ﬁrm could create screening models that ﬁt it’s particular
decision criteria. The models could then be used DEMO junior associates or lower level employees to perform
an initial screen of received venture proposals thereby freeing senior associates’ time.  2000 Elsevier

INTRODUCTION
New venture survival is tenuous at best, but those backed DEMO Venture Capitalists (VCs)
tend to achieve a higher survival rate DEMO non-VC-backed businesses (Kunkel and
Hofer 1991; Sandberg 1986; Timmons 1994)DEMO Studies ﬁnd that survival for VC-backed
ventures range from around 65% (DEMO 1990) to 85% of the VC’s portfolio (Dorsey
1979). Of those startups that survive, 20% fail to provide an adequate return to the
VC (Ruhnka, Feldman, and Dean 1992). In effect, DEMO data from various failure
studies results in a failure rate (from DEMO VC’s perspective) ranging from 35% to 55%.
Dean and Giglierano (1990) suggest that only 42% of VC-backed ﬁrms achieve an Re-
turn on Investment (ROI) of 15% which suggests a failure rate of nearly DEMO John
Hill, a prominent VC in Colorado, says that out of every 10 investments, a VC hopes
to hit one “home run” which often salvages the portfolio’s return (Hill 1993). Regardless
of what numbers the reader chooses to believe, the data indicate that the VC investment
decision has ample room for improvement. Thus, this paper asks the question of how
can VCs improve their “hit-rate” of successfully funded ventures thereby DEMO
their rate of return?
Using Social Judgment Theory (SJT) as a basis, this paper employs real time policy
capturing methods common in cognitive psychology to capture the VC’s actual decision
process, compare the VC’s decision process to that of an actuarial model (a decision aide

which DEMO information factors in such a manner as to distinguish between expected
success and/or failure among new venture proposals) and determine the potential of
actuarial models to improve VC decision-making. The paper proceeds as follows: First,
the VC decision process is investigated. Second, the paper looks at how biases and heu-
ristics hinder the decision. Third, the paper discusses the potential for actuarial models
to improve the decision by reviewing decision DEMO where such models have been
successful. This section builds a series of testable hypotheses. Finally, the paper dis-
cusses the results of the current study.
VENTURE CAPITALIST DECISION-MAKING
VC ﬁrms can be deﬁned as “those organizations DEMO predominant mission is to ﬁ-
nance the founding or early growth of new companies that do not yet have access to
the public securities DEMO or to institutional lenders” (Gupta and Sapienza 1992:349;
Perez DEMO; Pratt 1987). As such, Gupta and Sapienza (1992) suggest that VCs add
value by:
• bringing investors and entrepreneurs together DEMO an efﬁcient manner,
• making superior investment decisions than limited partners would make, and
• providing non-ﬁnancial assistance which in turn enhances survival.
All other things equal, a VC ﬁrm’s performance is a function of how well it makes
the investment decision and how effective its management DEMO and services are after
the investment decision has been made. In fact, Roure and Keeley (1990) assert that
success can be predicted from information contained in the business plan. Therefore,
improving the investment decision DEMO improve the VC’s performance.
Decisions can be decomposed into three basic components, (1) consequences, (2)
alternatives/options, and (3) DEMO of action (Behn and Vaupel 1982). The VC
investment decision DEMO its basic components are diagrammed in Figure 1. The conse-
quences associated with investment decisions boil down to ROI. If the VC invests in
DEMO startup idea, ROI is a function of the new venture’s performance. DEMO ventures
provide a high return, “living dead” (Ruhnka et al. 1992) and failed ventures result in
a loss of all or part of the investment. The basic alternatives or options that the VC
has in DEMO decision are to invest or not invest. The invest alternative can be further
subdivided into an amount invested. For example, a VC can form a syndicate to spread
the risk. However, Figure 1 shows the invest decision without these subdivisions. Finally,
326

the uncertainty of any investment translates DEMO probabilities or likelihood of the possi-
ble outcomes which cannot be perfectly known a priori.
VCs attempt to assess the probability of success or DEMO by evaluating information
surrounding the particular venture. To receive funding, new DEMO must past an initial
screening (typically a review of the business DEMO) followed by months of due diligence.
A number of researchers have DEMO what information is critical to the VC’s decision
(Table 1). DEMO review of this literature suggests that there are four main categories on
which VCs base their decision. The four categories can be summarized as (1) entrepre-
neur/team capabilities, (2) product/service attractiveness, (DEMO) market/competitive con-
ditions, and (4) potential returns if venture is successful (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976;
Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan, Seigel, and Subba Narasimha 1985; MacMillan,
Zeman, and DEMO Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons, Muzyka, Stevenson, and
Bygrave DEMO).
IMPEDIMENTS TO OPTIMAL DECISION MAKING
It is well recognized in the decision-making literature that decision makers are not per-
fectly rational, but boundedly rational (Cyert and March 1963; Newell and Simon 1972;
Simon DEMO). Biases and heuristics inhibit optimal decisions (e.g., Tversky and Khane-
man 1974; Hogarth and Makridakis 1981). The availability bias, for DEMO, may en-
courage decision makers to recall past successes rather than DEMO (Dawes 1988;
Dawes, Faust, and Meehl 1989). Therefore, a VC is apt to assess the success of a current
venture DEMO by how similar the current prospect is to a past success. If the venture
under consideration uses the same technology, or has the same lead entrepreneur, such
available information may bias the VC to overlook other information that suggests the
current venture is likely to fail. Likewise, a VC utilizing a satisﬁcing heuristic might
reject new venture proposals that fail DEMO meet any one minimum requirement on the
VC’s list of decision factors, even if all other remaining factors are substantially higher
than the minimum requirements. As such, the VC may eliminate potentially proﬁtable
investments from further consideration because of a heuristic rule (s)he is using to keep
the task manageable. However, considering the number of proposals that VCs review,
such time saving tradeoffs may be more cost effective in the DEMO run.
Biases and heuristics are more prevalent in certain tasks than others (Shanteau
1992). Some aspects of the VC task make it more difﬁcult and susceptible to sub-optimal
decision making. First, much of the information is constantly changing. The proverbial
“window of opportunity” is typically closing or DEMO, but always fast moving. Second,
feedback on the quality of DEMO VC’s decision is slow in coming. It generally takes 7 years
to identify the portfolio winners, and 2 to 3 years to identify the losers (Timmons 1994).
Slow feedback makes it difﬁcult for VCs to adjust their decision processes. Finally, VCs
rely on intuitive processes (Dominguez DEMO; Khan 1987). As such, the use of decision
aids may be rare.
Biases, heuristics, and a number of difﬁcult task characteristics DEMO in sub-optimal
decisions. The decision effectiveness problem sums down to low intra-judge reliability
and low inter-judge reliability. VCs are apt to consider each prospective DEMO as
unique thereby recalling differing available information factors from memory resulting
in low intra-judge reliability. The salience of certain factors surrounding a decision may
DEMO bias VCs by encouraging them to pay more attention to certain information fac-

tors than is warranted. Thus, VCs are likely to inconsistently apply their own decision
criteria, resulting in low intra-judge reliability.
Low inter-judge reliability can be attributed to differences between VCs, such as
experience, education, and other demographic factors. These differences inﬂuence DEMO
VC’s perceptions of the prospective venture (Barr, Stimpert, and Huff DEMO). Johnson-
Laird notes:
We seem to perceive the world directly, not a representation of it. Yet this phenome-
nology is illusory: DEMO we perceive depends on what is in our heads—on what evolu-
tion has “wired” into our nervous systems and what we know as a DEMO of experience.
The limits of our models are the limits of our world (1989:470–471).
The fact that each individual perceives the world differently leads to different decisions.
Therefore, consistency between decision makers within the same domain may be af-
fected; low inter-judge reliability. The problems with consistency raise the question of
whether more consistent decisions would improve the DEMO prediction of successful ven-
tures? If so, how can decision consistency be improved?
ACTUARIAL MODELS
Elstein and Bordage state that “actuarial (statistical) models refer to the use of any
formal quantitative techniques or formulas, such as regression analysis, for . . . [decid-
ing] clinical DEMO (1988:123). An actuarial model optimally combines decision cues
(relevant information) to derive an answer. Thus, actuarial models decompose decisions
into DEMO parts. Just as an insurance actuary statistically derives the payoff risk
associated with different groups of people (i.e., age, gender, etc.), DEMO models can
assess the probability of certain outcomes based upon information available to the de-
cision.
Actuarial models have received a lot of attention DEMO cognitive psychology
(Dawes and Corrigan 1974; Dawes et al. 1989; DEMO and Shortliffe 1983; Fischhoff 1988;
Goldberg 1968; Slovic 1972). Social Judgment Theory (Brunswik 1956) from cognitive
psychology provides a framework DEMO understanding actuarial models. SJT’s underlying
assumption is that decision makers do not have access to “real” information, but instead
perceive that information through proximal cues (Strong 1992). These cues quantita-
tively describe the relationship between someone’s judgment and the information used
to make that judgment (Stewart 1988). As such, SJT also provides a theoretical refer-
ence to much of the past research on VC decision criteria (Wells 1974; Poindexter DEMO;
Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan, Seigel and Subba Narasimha 1985; MacMillan,
Zeman, and Subba Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons, Muzyka, Stevenson, and
Bygrave 1987; Sandberg, Schweiger and Hofer 1988; Hall and Hofer 1993). SJT illus-
trates how these criteria are DEMO and recombined to reach a decision. Hence,
SJT allows the capture of ‘theories in use’ as opposed to ‘espoused theories’ of action
(Hitt and Tyler 1991). Within SJT, human judgments are formally modeled via the
lens model.
The lens model (Brunswik 1956; Hammond 1977) illustrates the VC investment
decision (using the four major categories mentioned earlier) (Figure 2). The information
factors link the objective environment (left side of Figure 2) and the assessment of that
environment (right side DEMO Figure 2). Speciﬁcally, the criterion variable (actual outcome)
is linked to the information factors by what decision the VC makes, typically invest or

DEMO invest. Regardless of how optimal the VC’s decision, the information factors DEMO
correlated to the ultimate decision. The judgment variable (expected venture outcome)DEMO
on the right side of the model represents the VC’s assessment of the venture’s potential.
For example, if the VC views the entrepreneur as a fatal ﬂaw for a particular venture,
then the VC would DEMO expect the venture to fail and not invest in it. Again, DEMO ex-
pected outcome is correlated to the information factors. In sum, DEMO actual outcome
is linked to the expected outcome via a series of information cues.
Using the lens model framework, two types of actuarial models can be derived,
a bootstrap and an environmental model. Bootstrapping (Dawes and Corrigan 1974;
Fischhoff 1988; Slovic 1972) is a method DEMO modeling the information cues that actual
judges use. In other words, DEMO are queried about what information is important
to the decision and then that information is used to build a model (this relationship is
represented on the right side of Figure 2). As contrasted with the DEMO model, an
environmental actuarial model of the VC investment decision (see the left side of Figure
2) identiﬁes how cues ﬁt the environment. Discriminant or regression analysis (Abdel-
Khalik and EI-Sheshai 1980; Dawes, et al. 1989) identiﬁes the optimal correlation be-
tween the available information factors (cues) and the ultimate venture outcome. Dis-
criminant analysis basically determines DEMO information factors from the environment
distinguish between success and failure.
Past Studies of Actuarial Models
Actuarial models have been developed in a number of DEMO domains and then com-
pared to the intuitive or “clinical” decisions of experts within those domains. Goldberg
(1968) extended Meehl’s (1959) groundbreaking DEMO on actuarial models. In Gold-
berg’s study, 29 psychologists judged patient DEMO by using information from the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). DEMO psychologist had varying
experience with the MMPI. An actuarial model derived from the MMPI instrument
330 A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND G.D. MEYER
predicted patient psychosis correctly about 70% DEMO the time. The best psychologist, in
terms of correct diagnosis, achieved a 67% accuracy rating. The average for all the psy-
chologists was DEMO
Actuarial models have also been tested within the domains of business decision
making (e.g. Wright 1979; Abdel-Khalik and El-Sheshai 1980; Lewis, Patton, and Green
1988). In Wright’s (1979) study, 47 MBA’s from Stanford predicted the percentage
change in security prices for 50 common stocks. DEMO year students achieved an accu-
racy of r 5 0.31 vs. r 5 0.20 for ﬁrst year students. In addition, students evidenced low
inter-judge reliability. An environmental actuarial model, on the other hand, achieved
an DEMO rating of r 5 0.59.
Abdel-Khalik and El-Sheshai (1980) tested the ability of commercial lenders to
predict loan defaults. Twenty-eight commercial lenders judged DEMO likelihood of default
of 46 ﬁrms and achieved an accuracy rating of 62%. In comparison, an environmental
actuarial model was 90% accurate and a bootstrap model was 67% accurate. The au-
thors contend that the primary DEMO in accuracy is a function of cue choice, because
the bootstrap DEMO is not statistically different than the lenders. It is possible that the
non-statistical difference is a function of the strong theoretical base (i.e., DEMO) that
lenders use in making loan decisions. In other words, once the lender has chosen which
ratios to use in making the loan DEMO, it is unlikely that the expert lender will mis-
judge such DEMO information factors.
In another development of the actuarial model process, Lewis DEMO al. (1988) exam-
ined the ability of 47 municipal ﬁnancial analysts to determine the change in municipal
bond ratings. Using 12 information factors DEMO from previous studies, the analysts
achieved an accuracy rating of approximately DEMO An environmental model achieved
60% accuracy, however bootstrap models did not DEMO differ from the experts
in accuracy. Again, the fact that bootstrap DEMO did not outperform experts may be
a function of the decision and the fact that quantiﬁable numbers and ratios are readily
available to the DEMO In decisions that use more subjective information, a bootstrap
model may DEMO better than the expert which it is modeling.
The potential of actuarial models for VC decision making
It is interesting to note that many DEMO the prior studies into VC decision criteria that
rely on surveys and questionnaires essentially derive the criteria that the experts would
include in a DEMO model (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984;
DEMO, Seigel, and Subba Narasimha 1985; MacMillan, Zeman, and Subba DEMO
simha 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons, Muzyka, Stevenson, and Bygrave DEMO). In es-
sence, the questionnaires and surveys yield the cues DEMO experts believe are most impor-
tant to the decision to accept or reject investing. In other words, a bootstrap model
reaches the same conclusion as an expert since it uses the same information as the expert.
DEMO, past research ﬁnds that bootstrap models perform better than experts because
DEMO models:
• are consistent (experts are subject to random ﬂuctuations);
• are not biased by a non-random sample; and
• optimally weigh information factors (Dawes et al. 1989; Fischhoff 1988; Slovic
and Lichtenstein 1971; Slovic 1972).
THE POTENTIAL OF ACTUARIAL DECISION MODELS 331
Given the forgoing reasoning, Hypothesis 1 suggests that a bootstrap actuarial
model (one based upon the information that VCs deem most important to the invest-
ment decision) outperforms the VCs themselves:
H1: A bootstrap actuarial model of the VC’s decision process better predicts actual
outcomes than the VC’s own intuitive decision process.
DEMO research also shows that environmental actuarial models perform better than
experts for the same reasons that bootstrap models outperform experts. Additionally,
environmental models DEMO only predictive variables and disregard non-predictive ones
(Dawes et al. 1989)DEMO Unlike human experts, environmental actuarial models don’t de-
velop distorted beliefs DEMO variable relationships. Therefore, environmental actuarial
models should achieve the highest accuracy DEMO in selecting successful ventures.
Roure and Keeley (1990) developed an environmental actuarial model for venture
capital decision making. Examining business plans from 36 DEMO tech enterprises, Roure
and Keeley identiﬁed four factors that best distinguished DEMO venture success and
failure (team completeness, technical superiority of product, DEMO time for product
development, and buyer concentration) for the ﬁrms in their sample. The researchers
suggest that their model can be used to DEMO for successful ventures (Roure and Keeley
1990). Based upon the DEMO from other decision domains and Roure and Keeley’s
environmental model, Hypothesis DEMO states:
H2: An environmental actuarial model of the decision process DEMO predicts actual
outcomes than the VC’s intuitive prediction.
In a perfectly rational ideal world where the VC would use valid cues as determined
by DEMO statistical analyses of the environment and where the VC weighed the cues
correctly, the correlations on the task (left) and cognitive (right) sides of the lens model
(see Figure 2) would be equivalent. DEMO, the probability of this perfectly correlated
scenario is unrealistic. Instead, an environmental actuarial model using the task cue fac-
tors is more likely DEMO predict the correct outcome than a bootstrap actuarial model using
cognitive cue factors. As such, an environmental model should better predict venture
outcome than a bootstrap model. Thus, Hypothesis 3 suggests:
H3: An environmental DEMO of the decision process better predicts actual outcomes
than a bootstrap model.
Oskamp (1982) ﬁnds that experts have greater conﬁdence in their decisions DEMO
more information is available for analysis. In other words, VCs exposed DEMO more infor-
mation are apt to believe that they make better predictions than either of the two actuar-
ial models or their peers who DEMO less information with which to make the decision.
But, Oskamp argues DEMO the expert’s increased conﬁdence is unfounded. With more
information, the accuracy DEMO their decision remains unchanged (Castellan 1977; Elstein
and Bordage 1988; DEMO 1982) and may even decrease (Arkes 1981). Part of the
reason that VC accuracy is not greatly improved with more information is DEMO experts,
despite their beliefs, use relatively few available cues (Brehmer and Brehmer 1988).
Therefore, VC’s tend to mistakenly believe that they are making a more informed deci-
sion with a greater amount of DEMO even though they are likely ignoring the addi-
tional information or using it inappropriately. More information leads not to improved
decision accuracy, just increased conﬁdence. Given the foregoing reasoning, Hypothesis
4a is derived:
332 A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND G.D. MEYER
H4a: The VC’s intuitive prediction of success does not improve even if (s)he has
more decision factors to consider.
If, as Hypothesis 4a posits, more information does not DEMO to improved decision
accuracy, both the bootstrap and environmental actuarial models DEMO still outper-
form those VCs who have access to more information.
H4b: A bootstrap model outperforms VC’s who have access to more decision
factors.
H4c: An environmental model outperforms VC’s who have access to more deci-
sion factors.
Actuarial models have proven to be robust. In a meta-analysis, only 6 of 117 studies
found that clinical or intuitive decision making DEMO or outperformed actuarial mod-
els (Grove 1986). Therefore, it appears that actuarial models may be useful tools for
improving VC decision making.
DEMO
The main hypotheses propose that VC decisions are less accurate then those of boot-
strap or environmental actuarial models. In this study, therefore, DEMO VCs’ decisions
are compared to the predictions of the actuarial models on 25 actual ventures that have
subsequently achieved some outcome—either success or failure. DEMO VCs receive sev-
eral pieces of information about each potential investment. The actuarial models (re-
gression equations) use the same information cues as DEMO VCs. The exercise requests
that the participants evaluate the ventures as they would during the initial screening
stage of an actual decision and judge DEMO the venture will likely succeed or fail.
Thus, the VCs were DEMO to rate on a seven point Likert Scale, the potential of DEMO
venture to succeed of fail. Coding of the VC response to success or failure was conducted
as follows: 5 to 7 (success probability DEMO high), 4 (VC is unsure or doesn’t know), 1 DEMO
3 (failure probability is high). The hit-rate—number of correct decisions DEMO compared
to the actual outcome of the venture—is recorded for both the VCs and each actuarial
model. Additionally, VCs participated in one of three treatments that varied the amount
and type of information that they could DEMO to make the decision. The hit-rate of VCs
is compared across treatments.
Decision Experiment
The experiment was administered on a notebook PC brought to DEMO VC’s ofﬁce; such
convenience likely increased participation. Policy capturing experiments enable DEMO
and are conducive to quantitative statistical tests (i.e., Regression and ANOVA).
Sample
The sample for this experiment was 53 practicing VCs from DEMO entrepreneurial “hot-
beds,” (1) the Colorado Front Range (primarily DEMO Denver/Boulder metro area) and
(2) the Silicon Valley in DEMO Two of the 53 participants were removed (one be-
cause the DEMO crashed during the exercise and the other because he did not wish to con-

1988). The more scenarios each participant completes, the higher the validity of the
captured judgment policy. Unfortunately, too many scenarios may tire the judge and
334

limit participation. Stewart (1988) suggests DEMO 35 scenarios is typically sufﬁcient to
accurately capture the subject’s decision policy. Another rule of thumb is to have a mini-
mum of ﬁve DEMO for every cue that is being tested (Stewart 1991).
A DEMO capturing exercise that uses all the identiﬁed information factors from
previous research would be untenable (see Table 1, approximately 25 cues in aggregate
DEMO). To achieve an appropriate scenario-to-cue ratio, the VCs would have DEMO evaluate
over 100 scenarios (5 cases/cue * 25 cues 5 DEMO). Evaluating 100 scenarios would in-
crease the required time to complete the exercise, might reduce participation, or tire
each participant, thereby reducing the experiment’s validity. Additionally, such an in-
creased time requirement might discourage VCs from participating in the exercise alto-
gether. Furthermore, several of the identiﬁed cues are probably highly correlated with
each other. High multicolinearity adversely DEMO policy capturing experiments (Stew-
art 1988). Finally, most people, DEMO experts, typically use only three to seven infor-
mation cues (Stewart 1988), so a smaller set of cues is valid. For the DEMO reasons, the
number of cues used in the exercise in a DEMO of all possible cues.
Before scenarios can be constructed, relevant information DEMO must be identiﬁed.
In order to use a manageable set of cues, cue frequency across studies and reported
importance within each study are used as a criterion for the inclusion of a particular
cue in the DEMO Additionally, cues that are highly correlated with other cues are
removed (Lewis, Patton, and Green 1988) retaining the cue that is deemed most impor-
tant in the literature. A consulting expert VC also veriﬁed DEMO the retained cue was
valid and important. Although the list is not exhaustive, it is more probable that the
identiﬁed cues in this study include unimportant factors rather than exclude important
factors. This outcome is due DEMO the fact that experts typically identify far more cues than
they actually use (Stewart 1988).
Decision scenarios were created once the pertinent cues had been identiﬁed. Coop-
erative VCs outside the sample of the study (primarily VCs based in Chicago and the
East Coast) provided actual investment decision scenarios. A stipulation for using the
actual cases was that the DEMO, venture, and any associated ﬁrms or individuals
remain unidentiﬁed. Such a provision does not impede this study in any way. In fact,
DEMO the venture or entrepreneur might bias the participant’s decisions. For exam-
ple, personal knowledge of an entrepreneur’s reputation might lead the subjects to judge
that case without fully evaluating other supplied information. Products also are not DEMO
tiﬁed, because many of the actual ventures included products identiﬁed with DEMO
ﬁrms. Moreover, identifying the product might also narrow the available sample DEMO
A VC may be hesitant to make a decision about a biotechnology ﬁrm if (s)he specializes
in computer disk storage. Although a proposed venture may not ﬁt a particular VC
ﬁrm’s investment criteria, VCs within those ﬁrms often screen such ventures and, if they
have potential, DEMO them to an more suitable VC. For the same reasons, ﬁnancial DEMO
are not included in this experiment. Different VCs use different hurdle rates. This exper-
iment focuses on the screening stage, therefore, it is DEMO to minimize any preset
biases regarding unique ﬁrm investment criteria (i.e., industry, etc.).
Value ranges given to each cue allow it to be compared across scenarios (Stewart
1988). Concrete values are used (DEMO, market size) for cue values when possible, but
purely representative DEMO are appropriate for subjective cues (Stewart 1988).
A uniform coding DEMO for subjective information factors allows consistent coding
across the business plans used in building the experiment. For instance, the subjective
information factors within the Cognitive Cue Treatments were rated on a ﬁve-point

DEMO For example, the proprietary product cue value rated from 1 (lowest protection)
to 5 (highest protection). Likewise, competitor strength was DEMO rated on a ﬁve-point
scale. Within the Task Cue Treatment, Roure DEMO Keeley’s (1990) subjective rating scale
was used.
The lead researcher pulled information factors from the business plans of the actual
cases. Although there DEMO a potential threat that the information included in the plan is
inaccurate (which would carry over into the experiment), Roure and Keeley (DEMO) ﬁnd
that VCs rarely need to make “intense” corrections. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that
the business plans are accurate enough for DEMO study. To insure inter-judge reliability, a
colleague unfamiliar with the business DEMO or their outcomes also coded all appro-
priate cues. The lead researcher provided the second coder with the entire list and de-
scription of DEMO information factors of interest. Overall inter-judge reliability equates
to 87.5%. Berelson (DEMO) reports that inter-judge reliability typically ranges from 66%
to 95%. As DEMO, the coding is deemed fairly reliable.
A technique to further decrease DEMO while maintaining strong external
validity is to combine actual and statistically derived cases. A random case generator
from Policy PC software package (Stewart 1991) creates a manageable number of statis-
tically derived cases. MANOVA veriﬁes that the statistical cases are from the same pop-
ulation as the actual DEMO (see Table 3). The IVs have equal variance between real DEMO
generated cases and the multivariate means are equivalent. Furthermore, a consulting
DEMO VC identiﬁed those cases that were not feasible (i.e., combination of cue values
that rarely occurs in reality). Unfeasible scenarios were dropped DEMO the sample of
potential candidates.
The ﬁnal design allowed the VCs to use four to eight cues (depending upon the
treatment) and judge DEMO cases. The independent variables are the decision cues available
within each treatment. The dependent variable is the VCs assessment of how likely the
venture DEMO to succeed as measured on a seven point Likert Scale. The participants are
divided into three groups (see Table 4). Group one uses the information cues associated
with a base cognitive model as derived from DEMO literature reviewed (see Table 4). The

els. The bootstrap actuarial model used the eight decision cues that VCs in the Addi-
tional Cognitive Cues Treatment used. The bootstrap DEMO model equally weighted
the eight cues. The environmental actuarial model used the four cues and respective
weights identiﬁed by Roure and Keeley (1990).
The appendix provides a visual representation of a sample case within each DEMO
ment that the VCs examined. Note that each information factor is labeled. There is a
numeric representation of the cue value as well as DEMO visual bar chart of how that cue
in the presented scenario relates to its respective cue in all the other scenarios.
RESULTS
Before launching DEMO the results related to the hypotheses, we note that VCs within
DEMO three treatments achieved different accuracy rates (see Table 5). The DEMO section
discusses these results further as they relate to each of the hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1, which posits that an equal weighted bootstrap actuarial model (one
that uses the same cues that VCs believe to be important) better predicts actual outcome
than the VC, receives support. The standardized DEMO equal weighted actuarial
model1 is as follows:
zY 5 (mktfam) 1 (lead) 1 (proprietary) 1 (mktsize) 1 (mktgrw) DEMO (start-up)
2 (competitor) 2 (strength)
where:
zY 5 standardized prediction of success
other variables are standardized cue values for DEMO scenario.

A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND G.D. MEYER
The bootstrap actuarial model achieved a DEMO of 60% whereas VCs hit-rates
were signiﬁcantly lower (39.5% in the DEMO cues treatment, 30.9% in the additional
cues treatment, and 17.1% in the environmental cues treatment [see Table 5]). One of
the 20 DEMO in the bootstrap cues treatment achieved a hit-rate of 60% which suggests
that (s)he performed as well as the bootstrap actuarial model. None of the VCs in either
the additional cues treatment (n 5 17) or environmental cues treatment (n 5 14)
matched the success DEMO the bootstrap actuarial model. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported;
a DEMO model better predicts outcome than the expert VC.
Hypothesis 2, which DEMO that an environmental actuarial model will outperform
expert VCs, receives mixed DEMO The current study uses Roure and Keeley’s (1990)
environmental actuarial DEMO as follows:
IRR 52486.27 1 2.91(complete) 1 24.63(product) 1 183.96(buyer)
232.30 (buyer)2 1 15.88 (devtime) 2 0.78 (devtime)
where:
IRR 5 Internal Rate of Return expected from investment
complete 5 degree of team completeness
product 5 product’s superiority DEMO existing offerings
devtime 5 months from funding until product is ready to go
buyer 5 number of potential customers for the product.
Roure and DEMO model achieved a hit-rate of 40% (see Table 5) which is approxi-
mately equal to those VCs in the bootstrap cues scenario (39.5%). However, the envi-
ronmental actuarial model beat the mean hit-rate of those VCs in the additional cues
scenario (30.9%) and those in DEMO environmental cues scenario (17.1% [see Table 5]).
Thus, Hypothesis 2 receives mixed support.
Hypothesis 3, which suggests that an environmental model will outperform a boot-
strap model, does not receive support. The Roure and Keeley (1990) environmental
model achieved a hit-rate of 40%, whereas the equal weighted bootstrap model
achieved a hit-rate of 60%.
Hypothesis 4a, which asserts that VC prediction success does not improve with ad-
ditional information, receives support. Decision accuracy decreased the more informa-
tion that the VC DEMO available to make the decision—from 39.5% in the bootstrap cues
treatment to 30.9% in the additional cues treatment (see Table 5). Additionally, DEMO
who had more information were more likely to reject a proposal (DEMO rejections to
40.5% in bootstrap cues treatment) or be unsure (i.e., select “don’t know”—19.3% to
16.5% in bootstrap cues treatment). As such, VCs in the additional cues treatment se-
lected 36.7% of the cases as likely successes, whereas VCs in the bootstrap cues treat-
ment selected 43% as likely successes.
Hypothesis 4b, which suggests that the bootstrap model will outperform even those
VCs with additional information, receives support. The equal weighted bootstrap model
achieved a hit-rate of 60% whereas VCs in the DEMO information scenario achieved
a mean rate of 30.9% (see Table 5)DEMO Moreover, no VCs in the additional cues treatment
(n 5 17) matched or beat the bootstrap model. The best VCs in this treatment achieved
a 45% correct classiﬁcation rate.
Hypothesis 4c, which posits that an environmental actuarial model will outperform
VCs with additional information, also receives support. The Roure and Keeley (1990)
THE POTENTIAL OF ACTUARIAL DECISION MODELS
339
environmental actuarial model achieved a DEMO of 40% whereas the VCs within the
additional cues treatment achieved a hit-rate of 30.9% (see Table 5). However, in this
case, 4 out of 17 VCs equaled the environmental model and 1 of DEMO beat (45% correct)
the environmental model.
The results of the DEMO support most of the relationships proposed in
this study.
DISCUSSION
In general, the results indicate that more information appears to hinder the VC’s deci-
sion process, even though most people prefer more information when making complex
decisions. This study also demonstrates that VC decision making can be improved
DEMO the aid of actuarial models, especially in information laden environments. Even
DEMO this experiment used a generic bootstrap and environmental actuarial models,
these aids had signiﬁcantly higher hit rates than the participating VCs across all DEMO
ments. Although the expert VC’s intuition is valuable, it often is DEMO resulting in sub-
optimal decisions, especially when more information surrounds the DEMO Further-
more, the results imply that as more information is available DEMO the decision, the VCs’
predictive accuracy substantially decreases. Even though the DEMO dramatically
reduces the information surrounding an actual situation, an increase in DEMO available
information (from ﬁve to eight information factors) results in a decrease in prediction
accuracy of almost 9% (from 39.5% correct to 30.9% correct). The decreased decision
efﬁciency has several potential explanations, including cognitive overload and “story”
incoherence (Pennington and Hastie 1986). As more information becomes available,
it is more difﬁcult for the decision maker to DEMO each piece of information, let alone
how that information impacts other DEMO Thus, it is cognitively harder to create a story
or scenario DEMO the venture will succeed. Story incoherence usually results in a negative
interpretation of a situation (Pennington and Hastie 1986). Therefore, identifying the DEMO
important criteria, and removing the noise caused by all the other DEMO sur-
rounding the decision may improve the decision process. Actuarial models remove VC
biases by ignoring salient information surrounding a particular venture decision. Thus,DEMO
VCs become more consistent in their decision making (improved intra-judge reliability)DEMO
Additionally, if VCs within the same organization use the same actuarial DEMO, consis-
tency across VCs within the ﬁrm also increases (improved inter-judge reliability).
More information also appears to affect whether VCs judge a DEMO as potentially
successful or not. It seems that VCs with more information are less likely to view a ven-
ture as potentially successful (37% vs. 43% within the base treatment). Such a failure
bias may DEMO that VCs are employing a “satisﬁcing” heuristic in their decision mak-
ing (Simon 1955) where the plan must meet a minimum level on DEMO criteria or be
rejected. With additional information, there is an increased DEMO that a venture
will fail on one information factor and be eliminated from further consideration. Poor
standing on one criteria may become salient and DEMO the VC. The critical question is
whether weakness on one criteria negates an otherwise sound investment? The answer
is likely dependent upon the relative importance of that criteria. Actuarial models can
eliminate the noise by isolating DEMO factors that are most central to the decision. Thus,
actuarial models may potentially improve the VC’s successful “hit-rate”.
If actuarial models can improve DEMO consistency, the implications for practicing
VCs are obvious. Such models may DEMO the hit-rate of successful ventures, thereby
340
A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND G.D. MEYER
improving the VC’s return. These decision DEMO appear under used in this industry, how-
ever VCs are particularly DEMO suited to develop such aids. In follow-up interviews, it
was found DEMO only 24% of the participating VCs use some sort of factor checklist (a
document or tool where the VC identiﬁes how each venture proposal measures up to
key criteria). Checklists provide a basis for VCs DEMO the ﬁrm to evaluate the lead
VCs analysis and by extension, DEMO whether the VC is biased by certain salient
factors. Over time as certain funded ventures succeed and others fail, checklists allow
VCs to assess the validity of their decision criteria and make corrections. In fact, several
of those VCs that use a checklist did so after they made DEMO investment decision. In other
words, the VC made the decision on DEMO intuitive basis and then after the ﬁrm was funded,
the VC went back and completed the checklist. Such a history of investment decisions
DEMO VCs to learn what works and what doesn’t. However, if the DEMO never formalizes
the decision process, it is much more difﬁcult to DEMO the critical factors, especially
considering post hoc recall and rationalization biases.
DEMO, VCs face a plethora of information when making an investment decision
(i.e., business plan, outside consultants, due diligence, etc.). It DEMO be difﬁcult for VCs
to truly understand their intuitive decision because of all the noise caused by this infor-
mation overload. This lack of DEMO understanding impedes learning. VCs cannot
make accurate adjustments to their evaluation process if they do not truly understand
it. Therefore, VCs may suffer from a systematic bias that impedes the performance of
their investment portfolio. The DEMO used in this experiment can be modiﬁed and
used as a training tool to assist active VCs in understanding their intuitive process.
The basic DEMO of this paper is that actuarial models can improve VC decision
making and by extension, VC returns. Improving the return enhances the VC’s ability to
solicit investors into his/her next investment portfolio. Developing a successful DEMO
model may provide VC’s with a competitive advantage. However, actuarial models
DEMO panaceas.
The use of actuarial models, as with any information processing DEMO (i.e., com-
puter), can be hazardous. The old saying “garbage in, garbage out” applies to actuarial
models as well. Therefore, VCs DEMO assess the quality of the information going into the
model. For example, if the VC believes that start-up experience is a crucial component of
the model, (s)he would be well advised to assess the DEMO of those start-up experiences.
Were the prior start-ups successful? If not, what were the problems? If not, was it still
a valuable DEMO experience? Why did the entrepreneur leave the successful start-up?,
etc. On the basis of such questions, the VC can assess the quantitative value of start-up
experience and determine the best way to input it DEMO the actuarial model.
Although VCs should be wary of the information input into the model, there is
a very real danger that VCs will over analyze such information and possibly invalidate
the results. In a classic DEMO, Goldberg (1968) ﬁnds that experts (clinical psychologists
judging psychosis) DEMO use actuarial models as one more input into the decision process
often override the model’s conclusion. They identify “broken legs” or exceptions
(Meehl 1954) that invalidate the model’s conclusion, or so they believe. However, Gold-
berg ﬁnds that the model achieves higher accuracy in isolation than those DEMO who
use the model as one more source of analysis. Therefore, DEMO should exercise caution
interpreting the model’s prediction, as well as modifying DEMO going into the model.
Although actuarial models have been shown to improve expert decision making,
the models have not been widely adopted by DEMO There is an underlying distrust
of “machine” that inhibits adoption of such techniques across a wider array of ﬁelds
THE POTENTIAL OF ACTUARIAL DECISION MODELS 341
(Holt 1986). A common explanation of this reluctance is that actuarial models remove
responsibility for the DEMO (Hastie 1994). Although a model might be able to predict
DEMO, does the psychologist want to take responsibility if the model is DEMO? Or
would the psychologist feel better if (s)he made that ﬁnal decision even if there is poten-
tial for more mistakes? In today’s litigious society, one has to wonder if malpractice
insurance would cover the misdiagnosis of an actuarial model. Such questions pose an
interesting quandary DEMO may explain the low usage of such models and the tendency
to identify “broken legs” or exceptions that invalidate the model.
Recognizing the reluctance DEMO use such models, it seems that the most appropriate
place within DEMO VC decision process would be at the initial plan screening process. The
actuarial model quickly focuses attention on the critical issues thereby saving the DEMO
time and reducing the possibility that “high potential” plans are prematurely discarded
and that “low potential” plans are needlessly passed on to the next DEMO of analysis.
Such use of the actuarial model also does not remove the VC’s control or responsibility
over the decision. The VC can still DEMO for exceptions if (s)he disagrees with the model,
but DEMO VC should be cognizant of Goldberg’s (1968) ﬁndings.
INTERPRETING RESULTS OF POLICY
CAPTURING EXPERIMENTS
Although policy capturing allows real time, unbiased capture of VC decisions, it does
have some short-falls. As with any experiment, DEMO issue of reductionism must be consid-
ered. The subjects are exposed to a decision situation which does not perfectly mirror the
“real-life” decision. Such DEMO tests” affect the external validity of many lens model
experiments (Brehmer DEMO Brehmer 1988; Strong 1992). Nevertheless, policy capturing
experiments are a valid method for deriving what information decision makers actually
use (Stewart 1993). Although such “paper” experiments have been criticized, Brown
(1972) ﬁnds that under even the most contrived cases, the decisions reﬂect actual deci-
sions. Moreover, since the VC decision has a large “paper” component in the real world
(i.e., much of the VC’s information comes from DEMO plans), correlation between
the experimental task and the “real world” decision should be even higher.
The 40% hit-rate for the environmental actuarial model DEMO concern. Ideally,
an environmental cue set is the optimal set of factors for distinguishing between suc-
cesses and failures. Unfortunately, the Roure and Keeley (1990) model is not optimal
for the cases within this DEMO Therefore, it appears that there may not be a univer-
sal DEMO of predictor variables, or that the case set used to derive DEMO and Keeley’s
(n 5 36), is not large enough to DEMO a universal environmental model2. In all likeli-
hood, there is not DEMO universal model, but it is likely that each individual ﬁrm can DEMO
by developing a model that is suited to its investment criteria.
It was surprising that the VCs in the environmental cue treatment performed so
DEMO An obvious explanation may be that the predictor cues are not the optimal pre-
dictors. A second explanation may be the nature of the DEMO To an even greater extent
than cues in the other treatments, DEMO environmental cues are very condensed and quan-
titative. For example, instead DEMO describing entrepreneur and team qualiﬁcations, the
environmental cue of team completeness DEMO the percentage of ﬁlled key positions

at the time of funding. Although DEMO a cue is undoubtedly correlated with team quality
and ability, VCs DEMO the cues as intuitively unappealing; the cues are condensing too
many DEMO elements. Likewise, buyer concentration seems to be a poor intuitive proxy
DEMO market potential. As such, VCs may be unsure of how to DEMO these cues which,
in turn, makes them more likely to DEMO venture failure than VCs in the other treat-
ments (56 vs. DEMO for VCs in additional cues treatment and 41% for VCs in bootstrap
cues treatment).
Another limitation is a history effect on the cases DEMO in the study. It typically
takes 5 to 7 years for a VC to realize a return on a new venture investment (Timmons
1994). During that time, many things can change which ultimately inﬂuence the ven-
ture’s success. Some examples include new team members, a revised product/service,
changing technology, and shift in market demand. Steier and Greenwood’s (1995) in-
depth case study of one new venture funded by DEMO network of VCs suggests that the ﬁrm’s
ultimate demise was a function of poor coordination and a lack of timely follow-up fund-
ing by DEMO VCs, not any inherent weakness in the business concept. Although one DEMO
question Steier and Greenwood’s conclusion, the point is that anyone of DEMO changes
can either positively or negatively affect the venture’s success. Therefore, DEMO in the
experiment (as well as in reality), are making DEMO about a venture that may be
substantially different in a short matter of time. Moreover, it is unclear what leads to
the ultimate success/failure of the included cases. When asked, VCs providing the cases
were vague. Typically, they asserted the success/failure to a good/bad decision, strong/
weak management, good/poor understanding of the marketplace, etc. Thus, it would
not appear that any large history effects are occurring. However, it is probable that a
certain degree of history did help or hinder the ﬁrms used as cases. Such an effect not
only DEMO the VC’s decision, but also the prediction ability of an actuarial DEMO
Nevertheless, Roure and Keeley (1990) assert that initial actions and DEMO have
the largest impact on ultimate outcome. As such, the plans DEMO as cases in this study
are valid. These strategies are likely contained in the business plan, therefore, the busi-
ness plan is a DEMO tool to make the decision.
The experiment also forces VCs to make decisions based upon the presented cues.
In reality, VCs would (1) have access to a multitude of possible information cues and
(2) DEMO interactive due diligence and other methods to clarify and assess reliability of
chosen cues. A common theme in the follow up interviews is that DEMO prefer to reserve
ﬁnal judgment until they have a chance to meet with the lead entrepreneur. VCs want
a chance to “see if they DEMO work with the guy.” In essence, meeting with the entrepre-
neur DEMO more data points. If, however, meeting with the entrepreneur and other inter-
active processes add more information, it is not necessarily going to improve the decision
(Oskamp 1982). Such meetings might add to the information overload that affects infor-
mation use and leads to sub-optimal decisions DEMO illustrated in the experiment. More-
over, meeting the entrepreneur adds a DEMO of new biases that might impede the
overall decision, such as DEMO impression” biases (Borman 1991) or “personal appear-
ance” biases (Borman DEMO). However, if interaction improves the reliability of the cues,
DEMO it should improve the decision.
FUTURE RESEARCH
There are a number of possible extensions to the current study. In follow-up interviews,
the participating DEMO suggested that their decision style was much less formal than their

East Coast peers. An interesting DEMO is whether there is a difference and does it
lead to different decisions? Another question is how do VCs compare to Angels and
other new venture investors? New samples might address these questions.
Although the current study ﬁnds that actuarial models outperform experts, the ac-
curacy of the model is substandard (60% correct). It appears that actuarial models need
to be geared towards a ﬁrm’s speciﬁc criteria (i.e., stage, industry, etc.). Thus, a longitudi-
nal relationship with a few VCs DEMO lead to ﬁrm speciﬁc bootstrap actuarial models
based upon the needs and beliefs of the VCs within that ﬁrm. After several iterations,
it DEMO be interesting to see if the model agrees with the assessment of the VC evaluat-
ing the various plans that the ﬁrm receives. Over DEMO number of years, a quality bootstrap
model would ideally be developed DEMO incorporated into the ﬁrm’s decision process.
At that point in time, DEMO would be interesting to see how the VCs use the tool: DEMO they
frequently override its prediction? How much is the information input DEMO the model
modiﬁed? and a number of other questions surrounding its DEMO In sum, actuarial models
have the potential of increasing the efﬁciency DEMO the VC investment market, and it is
hoped that this study DEMO spur efforts to create such decision aids.
