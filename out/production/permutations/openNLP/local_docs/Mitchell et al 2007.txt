INTRODUCTION
Echoing Popper’s (1959) notion that general knowledge growth is propelled DEMO the growth
of specialized knowledge, we focus this article on the DEMO of the emerging entrepreneurial
cognition research stream as it contributes to overall knowledge growth in the field of
entrepreneurship.  Specifically, we take note DEMO the flow of advances in the entrepreneurial
cognition research stream, and DEMO this stream is increasingly being recognized as a critical
perspective for understanding entrepreneurship-related phenomena.  The more recent advances
consist of innovation that occurred earlier in this decade, as definitions were developed (e.g.,
Mitchell et DEMO, 2002a) and the boundaries and the exchanges of entrepreneurial cognition research
with its contributing fields, were made explicit (Mitchell et al., 2004).  In this article we
commence a transition from innovation through diffusion toward legitimization (e.g., Lawrence,
Winn & Jennings, 2001), by identifying the central research question that emerges from work to
date in DEMO cognition.  Hopefully this research question can provide a conceptual
staging point DEMO which researchers embark upon future explorations.
Although not exhaustive, our intensive DEMO involvement in two conferences and three
Special Issue volumes on entrepreneurial cognition has created within the Editorial Team a
perspective that we believe will DEMO constructive to building further research in the area.  In this
third DEMO Issue article, we specifically address the development of research questions
concerning DEMO cognition inquiry.  With this article and the other research articles
presented DEMO this Special Issue Volume, we therefore invite and seek to enable DEMO growing
community of entrepreneurship researchers from across multiple disciplines, to further DEMO the
“thinking-doing” link in entrepreneurship research.
One of the main activities of the Second Entrepreneurial Cognition Conference (the 2005
Conference held at the Ivey Business School at the University of Western Ontario), was to spend
DEMO
some time working on the central questions in entrepreneurial cognition research.  A variety of
possible questions were developed (Appendix A).  Since the DEMO, the editorial team has
continued to discuss and work on this DEMO After extensive dialogue, what has emerged is a
central question in DEMO cognition research.
This article proceeds in the following manner.  First, we discuss the central research
question to further enable entrepreneurial cognition inquiry.  Second, we present the conceptual
background and several representative approaches to entrepreneurial cognition research that form
the context for this question.  Third, we introduce DEMO articles in this SI as framed by the central
question and approaches to entrepreneurial cognition research and suggest how they further
contribute to this DEMO stream.  Finally, we offer our views concerning the challenges facing
the next generation of entrepreneurial cognition scholarship.
THE CENTRAL RESEARCH QUESTION
Over the DEMO five years many scholars in the field of entrepreneurial cognition have been
developing the research stream based upon a definition that is consistent with, and flows from, the
previously-noted beginnings.  In our 2002 article, we defined entrepreneurial cognitions to be: the
knowledge structures that people use to make assessments, judgments or decisions involving
opportunity evaluation and venture creation and growth. (Mitchell et al., 2002a, p. 97).  We note
DEMO in this definition the key elements: knowledge structures (whether heuristical or scripted) and
decision-making (including assessment and judgment) are set within the larger context of
entrepreneurship’s distinctive and inclusive domain/ situation (Mitchell et DEMO, 2004) of
opportunity evaluation, venture creation, and growth.
At the Second Conference on Entrepreneurial Cognition at the Ivey Business School (Fall
2005), we spent a substantial block of time discussing a variety of DEMO questions that are
germane to the area (Appendix A).  Some of the questions generated were more extensive than
4
others; but they all seem to further elaborate aspects of a simple four-word query: “How do
entrepreneurs think?”  Whether researchers are:  DEMO individual differences and why some
people make better entrepreneurs than others, DEMO how entrepreneurs develop unique
knowledge structures and become experts in processing information, and/ or examining individual
contributions to the entrepreneurial function itself, it appears that such research emerges from the
desire to better understand how DEMO think.  In Appendix A, we note and summarize the
developmental discussions accomplished by our fellow scholars at the 2005 Conference, in pursuit
of better understanding how entrepreneurs think.  The integrated research question produced at the
Ivey Business School conference served as our beginning point for the analysis DEMO in this
article.
Accordingly, we seek to prompt and facilitate the DEMO of additional research
questions central to the study of entrepreneurial cognition.  DEMO (2004) noted that there are three
basic questions that are central to the field of entrepreneurship.  They are:  (1) Why do some
persons but not others choose to become entrepreneurs?   (2) Why do some persons but not others
recognize opportunities for new products DEMO services that can be profitably exploited?  (3) Why are
some entrepreneurs so much more successful than others?  In his article, Baron goes on to
effectively argue that the cognitive perspective can make important DEMO in helping to
address all three of these questions.
Baron’s conceptualization is very effective in helping entrepreneurial cognition researchers
see how their efforts address DEMO entrepreneurship issues.  We also recognize, however, that even
greater clarity DEMO focus can yet be brought to bear for the benefit of those who are seeking to
better understand the mental processes of entrepreneurs.  Thus, to stimulate the turning of research
attention toward better understanding entrepreneurial mental processes, we argue here for
questions in entrepreneurial cognition research that spring from a fundamental starting point:
5
“How do entrepreneurs think?”  (Note that this is distinct from DEMO more general question of “How
people think?” because we are concerned with how individuals create wealth through the
identification and exploitation of market DEMO)  In the following section we trace the
conceptual foundations and approaches as background for this inquiry.
CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS AND APPROACHES
A wide variety DEMO issues, puzzles, and problems have prompted inquiry into, and as DEMO result
formed the research context for, the area we now call DEMO cognition research.  Several
such questions include the following: Why do some people become entrepreneurs while other
equally (or more) talented people do DEMO?  Why is it that some people see opportunity while
others, DEMO the same experience and information, do not?  Why do some DEMO act and
turn their ideas into business opportunities while others are satisfied to say that they had thought
of that too?  Why are DEMO people content to stop after creating an invention while others cannot
be content until their invention dominates the marketplace?  What do entrepreneurs do?  How do
they do it?  These questions address compelling issues that have long been central to scholars
investigating entrepreneurship phenomena.
From our vantage DEMO, we suggest that beneath each of the questions that have given DEMO
to the study of entrepreneurial cognition lies an underlying assumption: that DEMO
concerns itself with distinctive ways of thinking and behaving.  This is DEMO consistent with many
seminal theorists in the field (e.g., Kirzner, DEMO; McClelland, 1976; Schumpeter, 1934).
Presently, advances in social DEMO and specifically in the area of social cognition as it might
be applied to the study of how entrepreneurs think (Palich & Bagby, DEMO; Shaver & Scott, 1991)
now permit entrepreneurship investigators to address the thinking-doing connection of
entrepreneurship more directly.  This is in contrast to using proxy variables that produced
equivocal results in previous research (e.g., DEMO differences, internal locus of control,
6
need for achievement, or risk-taking propensity) that led to a hiatus DEMO individual level
entrepreneurship research for more than a decade (early to DEMO to mid-1990s).
The scientific milestones that mark the path of innovation in entrepreneurial cognition
research have been set in place according to a DEMO and exchange” logic (Busenitz et al.,
2003; Mitchell et al., 2004):  beginning with concepts from contributing fields, marking the
boundaries of the new field through cross-disciplinary exchange, and proceeding to a working
definition of the field.  The process of resolving distinctive versus inclusive domain tensions that
provides this dynamism, thereby draws concepts from contributing fields (DEMO, entrepreneurship
research and cognition research), and establishes boundaries within which DEMO exchange-based
synthesis is invoked and a definition is induced as represented in Figure 1.  As illustrated in Figure
1, the next step is, we believe, to focus on the central research questions that can serve as the pivot
point that can re-channel outward, research innovation energies that have more recently been
directed inward.  By “outward,” we mean: DEMO the coalescence of the entrepreneurial cognition
research domain, and toward broader DEMO of entrepreneurial cognition work within the
research community.  Consequently, we again appeal to a boundaries and exchange logic “. . . to
provide DEMO helpful lens through which to understand the progress and legitimization of the
entrepreneurial cognition domain” (Mitchell et al., 2004, p. 507).
{Insert Figure 1 about here}
In applying this logic, we first consider the conceptual foundations; and then take we note
of several approaches that have been built upon them.  In developing the fundamental conceptual
cornerstones upon which central questions in entrepreneurial cognition research is based, we
develop our explanation beginning with the more general and proceeding to the more specific:
DEMO articulating a foundation/ general definition of cognitions, toward our setting within this
background, the definition of entrepreneurial cognitions that we have previously offered (please
7
see Mitchell et al., 2002a).  Our intention through this discussion DEMO to provide a narrative from
which readers can assess the developmental process of the field, and within it, also assess our later
assertions DEMO the centrality of certain research questions for the further enabling of
entrepreneurial cognition research.
Foundations
We start with Neisser’s (1967) widely recognized perspective, which defines cognition to
be: all processes by which sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered,
and used.  Because entrepreneurial cognition research concerns the foregoing processes as they
occur within a socioeconomic DEMO, recent research has drawn heavily (but more often only
implicitly) DEMO the field of social cognition.  The social cognition literature assists in DEMO
the conceptual locale inhabited by the study of entrepreneurial cognition such that useful further
definition is enabled (Palich & Bagby, 1995).  By way of illustration, one major social cognition
perspective considers individuals to exist within a total situation—a psychological field or
gestalt—which is a configuration of DEMO described by two pairs of factors: one being the person
in DEMO situation, and the other being cognition and motivation (emphasis in original) (Fiske &
Taylor, 1984, pp. 4-5).  A recent DEMO of social cognition as: the ways in which we interpret,
DEMO, remember, and use information about the social world (Baron, Byrne & Branscombe,
2005) supports the idea that models used to conceptualize individual entrepreneurial behavior,
should therefore approximate a comprehensive reality (the person-in-situation; and cognition and
motivation) as understood when information about these two DEMO pairs is processed by a given
individual (Fiske & Taylor, 1984, pp. 5, 16).  This gestalt-based conceptualization provides a
means of comprehending both entrepreneurial cognition research to date and the future challenges
for DEMO as we attempt to articulate, justify, and further refine questions that are central to the
progress of the entrepreneurial cognition research stream.  Like Baron (2004), our assumption here
8
is that the cognitive science literature has much to offer in terms DEMO foundations and conceptual
tools with which to explore entrepreneurship phenomena and we very much endorse such
exchanges.  We also assume that there are boundaries, and that entrepreneurship research has its
own domain (Mitchell et al., 2004).  Some of this domain is unique but some of it also overlaps
with other parent disciplines such as cognitive psychology.
At first DEMO, it would seem that the central question of a cognitive approach DEMO the study
of entrepreneurship would lead us to simply ask “how do entrepreneurs think, reason, and
behave?”  However, being insufficiently bounded, this question provides little, if any, basis to
suggest that entrepreneurs DEMO, reason, and behave differently from others concerning (for
example) taking a shower, eating, buying a house, coaching softball, and so DEMO   Thus, a more
directed question founded in a social cognition-based (person IN situation) view might read:
“How do entrepreneurs think, DEMO, and behave such that they create value and wealth through
the DEMO and implementation of market opportunities?”  Accordingly, when we offer (DEMO
we have above) the succinct question: “How do entrepreneurs think?” it is within the context of
new value creation as the focal DEMO/ objective that we intend it to be applied.
Our paying attention DEMO a focal objective provides a necessary point of convergence for
theory and research in entrepreneurial cognition.  This is because “focused-thinking”-type
questions incorporate lessons cognitive psychologists have learned the hard way: that successful
theory and research about cognition and cognitive processes requires investigators to pay strict
attention to the DEMO of human agency (e.g., even the wackiest, most out of DEMO box creative
thinker has a purpose: a problem to solve).  Thus as a field, our discovery and our articulations
concerning the patterns involved in any entrepreneurial person’s perceptual and thinking processes
9
make more sense in the context of a purpose or problem2 .  Accordingly, because explanations of
behavior, especially cognitive behavior, are domain (DEMO) specific, we can expect the patterns
of entrepreneurial cognition that we study to vary depending on a person’s purpose or problem.
To proceed DEMO ground effectively questions that are central to research, we therefore rely
DEMO the assumption of directed human agency as it is manifest in the study of human decision
making under information-limitation-induced uncertainty (e.g., Simon, 1979).  This addition—of
the element of information-starved responses to economic uncertainty—reflects the reality that
many people engaged in entrepreneurial activities appear not to perform DEMO elaborate, deliberative,
thorough evaluation of the best way in which DEMO describe a problem or decision, nor do they
conduct meticulous cost-benefit DEMO on all possible alternatives before choosing the option
that produces the highest return on investment.  In fact, some of the more recent approaches DEMO the
study of entrepreneurial cognitions (e.g., entrepreneurial heuristics theory (Busenitz & Barney,
1997); entrepreneurial alertness theory (Gaglio & Katz, 2001); entrepreneurial expertise/ script
theory (Mitchell, 1994; Mitchell, Smith, DEMO & Morse, 2000); effectuation theory
(Sarasvathy & Simon, 2000; Sarasvathy, 2001a)); consider the rational model to be compromised
as DEMO address this essential task: value-creation-driven opportunity identification.  We
therefore examine each approach in more detail.
Approaches
We ask: If entrepreneurs do not follow the normative/ rational model in their thinking,
what are they following? What do their cognitive processes and cognitions look like, and how DEMO
these lead to the creation of value and wealth?  As noted, several sub-streams of research have
emerged to address these questions. Some of these approaches focus more on the cognitive
2 ENT cognition scholars have DEMO this question explicitly in the examination of entrepreneurial intentions (e.g.,
DEMO & Carsrud, 1993); and in the examination of perceptual aspects DEMO as self-efficacy, and feasibility and
desirability perceptions (e.g., Krueger, 1993; Krueger & Dickson, 1993; 1994).
10
shortcuts people use instead of using the logical-rational model.  Sometimes these shortcuts
(cognitive heuristics), can be beneficial and even produce superior results.  DEMO exploring,
for example, entrepreneurial alertness, expert-based scripts/ schema/ schemata, counterfactual
thinking, mental simulations, cognitive style, and so forth, have produced provocative models of
the ways in which entrepreneurs use beneficial shortcuts DEMO identify opportunities or pursue
venture startup.  In other situations, these shortcuts can lead to errors: erroneous evaluations and
decisions.  Further research will DEMO doubt shed light on the relationship between cognition and (for
example) why entrepreneurs attempt to preserve and hang on when, in fact, DEMO situation calls for
efficient failure.  Other approaches such as effectuation focus DEMO on what the entrepreneur does
and how the situation effects the entrepreneur’s thinking.
We briefly summarize below the entrepreneurial cognition approaches which have been
DEMO to this point in time.  We hasten to note that entrepreneurial DEMO research is very
much in the early stages of development.  Our DEMO in presenting these developing perspectives
is to generate interest in testing and extending some of the theoretical models that have been
developed; to encourage interested scholars to rigorously replicate and build upon the seminal
studies; and to expand generally the further investigation of entrepreneurial cognitive dynamics
and processes DEMO all areas of the discipline’s domain (e.g., new, small and DEMO businesses,
corporate entrepreneurship, economic development, institutional entrepreneurship, etc.).
DEMO, we see complementarities among these various approaches for better understanding
how DEMO think.
Over the past decade, then, the entrepreneurial cognition literature has seen substantial
development in the study of thinking and decision making, especially in the examination of
cognitions relating to entrepreneurial decision-making.  The perspectives that we address here
include (1) the use of heuristic-based logic (e.g., Baron, 1998; Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Simon,
11
Houghton, & Aquino, 2000),  (2)  perceptual processes/ entrepreneurial alertness (e.g., Kirzner,
1979, 1985; Gaglio & Katz, 2001); (3) the entrepreneurial information processing-based expertise
approach (e.g., Gustavsson, 2004; Mitchell, 1994; Mitchell et al., 2000, 2002b); and (4) the
effectuation approach (Sarasvathy, 2001a; 2001b).  In DEMO ways, these explanations are
complementary and spring from common roots.
Heuristics-based DEMO  “Heuristics” refers to simplifying strategies that individuals use to
make decisions (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973; 1974).  The heuristic-based logic approach argues
that individuals and situations do vary in the extent to which these DEMO shortcuts are used
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997).  Furthermore, heuristics in general and entrepreneurial decision
making specifically are often thought to be:  (1)  at least partially subjective,  (2)  influenced by
beliefs with origins in specific methods for solving problems for which no DEMO exists, and  (3)
based on informal processes and experience (Busenitz & Lau, 1996; Busenitz & Barney, 1997;
Simon & Houghton, 2002).  The positive findings in this research stream (e.g., Busenitz &
Barney, 1997; Busenitz 1999; Simon et al., DEMO), especially regarding decision-making
differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs points towards this being a promising
area of research (e.g., Miner & Raju, 2004).  One line of ongoing inquiry proposes that
entrepreneurs may regularly find themselves in situations that tend to maximize the potential
impact of a DEMO heuristic based logic (Baron, 1998, p. 278; Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001).  For
example, they may often make significant leaps in their thinking leading to innovative ideas that
are not always very linear DEMO factually based.  Furthermore, entrepreneurs not only decide to
engage in entrepreneurship because of greater use of heuristics-based logic (e.g.,
representativeness, affect DEMO, planning fallacy, and illusion of control), but also they succeed
because of reduced susceptibility to certain other cognitive biases (e.g., avoidance DEMO sunk costs)
(Baron, 2004, p. 237).  A heuristic-based logic often enables entrepreneurs to make sense of
12
uncertain and complex situations more quickly and, relative to more orthodox approaches to
decision making, perhaps expedite learning.  Research findings to date indicate DEMO this is fertile
territory for further research.
Perceived connections and alertness.  DEMO new ideas and the realization that
some people seem particularly alert to new opportunities has had a growing presence in
entrepreneurship research in the DEMO decade.  Perceiving and interpreting information, and
reaching some unique conclusions about entrepreneurial opportunities, seem to involve some
unique mental processes.  The idea DEMO alertness was initiated by Kirzner (1979, 1985), who
challenged the dominance of the normative model in economics and predates the literatures
indicating DEMO lack of empirical support for such models.  Alertness is about attentiveness DEMO new
opportunities and at some level, it seeks to infer some DEMO thinking and reasoning.
Unfortunately, empirical research on alertness is limited (see Kaish & Gilad, 1991 for an
exception) and their findings have DEMO some serious concerns (Busenitz, 1996).  In extending
Kirzner’s work DEMO alertness into a social cognitive framework, Gaglio and Katz, 2001 argued that
alertness is very plausible, testable, and relevant as a model DEMO the cognitive dynamics driving the
opportunity identification process.  In his recent DEMO, Baron (2006) effectively argues that
cognitive frameworks possessed by some DEMO facilitate the connecting of dots between
environmental changes, market trends and DEMO niches.  Such frameworks allow for leaps in
logic that assists in DEMO identification on new opportunities (Busenitz & Arthurs, 2006).  In DEMO, it
is becoming apparent that some frameworks involving alertness and perceived DEMO holds
much potential for understanding the discovery of new opportunities.
Entrepreneurial expertise.  The development of research that uses expert information
processing theory to examine differences in decision-making between entrepreneurs and non-
entrepreneurs traces its roots to DEMO following idea:  that because entrepreneurs develop unique
13
knowledge structures and process information differently (they transform, store, recover, DEMO use
information differently than non-entrepreneurs (e.g., Mitchell, 1994; Mitchell et al., 2000))
entrepreneurs prevail in the face of bounded rationality DEMO to their “entrepreneurial expertise”
(Mitchell, 1994).  Thus, according to the expert information processing theory explanation,
entrepreneurs are experts in the DEMO domain who possess and can acquire through
deliberate practice (e.g., see Baron & Henry, 2006; Mitchell, 2005; Mitchell & Chesteen, 1995)
entrepreneurial cognitions: scripts or knowledge structures that enable them to use information
significantly better than non-experts/ non-entrepreneurs—i.e., at ≥ 2 standard deviations DEMO the
mean in the population at large (Ericsson, Krampe, & DEMO, 1993; Glaser, 1984; Leddo &
Abelson, 1986; Lord & Maher, 1990; Mitchell et al., 2000; Read, 1987).  Empirically, there is
growing evidence (e.g., Gustavsson, 2004; Mitchell et al., 2000, 2002b) to support the idea that in
entrepreneurship, DEMO in the form of expert scripts are related to decision-making despite
bounds to rationality: specifically, to making the venture creation decision (Busenitz & Lau, 1996;
Mitchell, 1994; Mitchell et al., 2000).  One possibility for the extension of this work—as
suggested by McGrath and DEMO (2000)—is that expert scripts in entrepreneurial decision
making represent a DEMO comprehensive entrepreneurial “mindset”—a global culture of
entrepreneurship (Mitchell et. al 2002b)DEMO
Effectuation.  Decision-making under uncertainty typically begins with determining the
desired outcome DEMO the probability that the outcome is likely to occur, and then DEMO the
best means to accomplishing the outcome (e.g., Knight, 1921)DEMO  This causal rationality typically
involves the examination of multiple alternatives and DEMO the determination of the optimal
alternative.  From this perspective, entrepreneurs are considered to be change agents who
specialize in recognizing and exploiting opportunities DEMO to them within the economic
system (Shane & Stuart, 2002) DEMO they consider alternative means to accomplishing venture
14
success (causation).  Distinct from the “causation”-based entrepreneurial processes, the
“effectuation”-based perspective, takes a set of means or tools as a given and focus on selecting
among the possible effects that can be created with DEMO set of means (Sarasvathy, 2001a, p. 245).
The effectuation DEMO suggests that thinking and action proceed together in an attempt to
create one of several possible outcomes.  Effectuation assumes that the future is unpredictable but
that entrepreneurs can control a value-creating part of it through the DEMO of a given set of means
available to them.  In this DEMO, entrepreneurs can utilize the means at their disposal to influence
their DEMO without having to predict it (Sarasvathy, 2001a; 2001b).  Stated differently,
effectuation represents a special case of expertise in that it DEMO that a venture will develop
along the lines of the means or expertise that are a part of the entrepreneur’s personal repertoire, a
part of the way they think and make sense of an evolving situation.
DEMO developments.  Additional approaches to probing entrepreneurial cognition
will continue to emerge DEMO time, and some of them will no doubt replace existing approaches
DEMO they better explain various aspects of the entrepreneurial cognition phenomenon.  We
DEMO that the approaches represented by two recent theory papers have the potential to become
known in such a manner.  Baron (2006b) recently presented a paper on at the Academy of
Management meetings on entrepreneurial affect.  Also, McMullen and Shepherd’s (2006) recent
article specifically addresses entrepreneurial action.  Although little empirical work yet exists to
test these two approaches we see the possibility for work to develop around these perspectives of
entrepreneurial DEMO (for example, see Gregoire, 2005), and accordingly we take DEMO of them
for the benefit of our readers, and include a DEMO of these approaches in Appendix B.
It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the pathway from contributing fields, through
boundary-setting and exchange, DEMO definitional development, is becoming better-marked and
perhaps easier to travel.  As you will see from the articles accepted for publication in this SI,DEMO
15
interesting and helpful investigations and elaborations of questions central to entrepreneurial
cognition DEMO, continue to emerge.  It is our pleasure now to briefly introduce each article as
set within the developing context of entrepreneurial cognition research.
DEMO OF ARTICLES IN THE SPECIAL ISSUE
Although we believe that each author or author team should ultimately position their work
within the entrepreneurial cognition DEMO firmament, we nevertheless cannot help but observe
that—of the five articles DEMO in this SI—some tend to fit more within a “person-centered”
approach (DEMO & Taylor, 1984), and others perhaps are more consistent with DEMO “situation-
centered” approach.  We think that you will find within these DEMO a wealth of ideas that
hopefully inform and illuminate a domain focused on the question: How do entrepreneurs think?;
while they also DEMO and motivate further work.
Cognitive style is the focus of Keith Brigham, Julio De Castro, and Dean Shepherd’s
article “A Person-Organization Fit Model DEMO Owner-Managers’ Cognitive Style and
Organizational Demands”; and these authors use the DEMO & Hayes (1996) measure of cognitive
style along the intuition-analysis continuum.  Consistent with Fiske and Taylor (1984), Brigham,
De Castro, and Shepherd explicitly consider entrepreneurs’ cognitions and their environment.  The
article addresses the research question ‘why do certain entrepreneurs behave differently from other
entrepreneurs DEMO a given situation?’ and the authors suggest that the reason might be because they
think differently.  Using a sample of 159 owner-managers of small high technology firms, they
specifically examine the fit between the preferred decision-making style of owner-managers and
the level of formal structure in their DEMO and the relationship of this fit to owner-manager
satisfaction and their intentions to exit.  This work brings to the entrepreneurship literature two
steams of organization studies: person-organization fit and cognitive styles, and in doing so DEMO
16
to the growing individual cognitive characteristics stream of research on entrepreneurial decision
DEMO
Then, in their article “The Good, the Bad and the Unfamiliar: The Challenges of
Reputation Formation Facing New Firms,” Eileen Fischer and Becky Reuber consider the
development of group level cognition; but as it relates to the process by which stakeholder groups
develop reputational beliefs about DEMO firms.  Using the PayPal organization as an example, the
authors place a multi-disciplinary lens on the issue of how reputations are formed, drawing on
social cognition theory, signaling theory, and concepts from organizational behavior DEMO
marketing to develop conceptual insight into the cognitive structures underlying reputation.
Fischer and Reuber identify three key implications of their work.  One, is DEMO initial reputations
are not necessarily a liability of newness, and new DEMO may enjoy a slight benefit from being
included in set of existing organizations with positive reputations.  The second, is that negative
information may DEMO be “sticky” if it does not contrast strongly with category-based evaluations (DEMO
does not stand out).  Finally, they offer three explanations for why reputations vary considerably
across stakeholder groups.
Next, the article by Page West, “Collective Cognition: When Entrepreneurial Teams, Not
Individuals, Make Decisions,DEMO extends the cognitive entrepreneurship research question from how
do entrepreneurs think, DEMO how do people think entrepreneurially, to how do people in new DEMO
top management teams think collectively.  Drawing on the organization behavior and DEMO top
management team literatures, West argues that while teams do not DEMO cognitions per se, team
perspectives of appropriate action (schema) are DEMO more than the compilation of
individual perspectives, and that the entrepreneurial DEMO collective cognition (ETCC) is what
drives many new venture strategy decisions.  Using an exploratory, longitudinal sample of 22
technology venture top management DEMO he finds that among new venture team members, too
17
much or too little integration (highly consistent or highly inconsistent views) DEMO too much or too
little differentiation (identifying too many or too DEMO options and alternatives) adversely affect
new venture performance.  These results and the development of a socio-cognitive grid
methodology for measuring ETCC provide a DEMO for extending entrepreneurial cognition
research to the team level of analysis.
The importance of understanding the cognitions of entrepreneurs within situation is
emphasized in DEMO Corbett and Keith Hmieleski’s article “The Conflicting Cognitions of
Corporate Entrepreneurs.”  DEMO conceptual paper makes a contribution to the entrepreneurial
expertise literature by extending the work of Mitchell et al. (2000) into the realm of DEMO
entrepreneurship.  Specifically, the authors draw on situated learning (e.g., Billett, 1996) and
social cognition theory (e.g., Bandura, 1986) to DEMO that event schemas (active knowledge
structures or scripts that guide task DEMO) need to be understood in the context of role schema
(knowledge structures about role or job appropriate behaviors).   They argue that DEMO
corporate entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs starting independent businesses have significantly
different role schema, the salience or use of key event schema are likely to differ.  This work
reinforces the idea that context matters; and it opens DEMO door to future explorations of cognitive
constructs, not just in the DEMO entrepreneurship context, but in other entrepreneurial contexts
as well (e.g., DEMO entrepreneurship, ethnic entrepreneurship and other contexts involving
ascribed or other roles.)DEMO
This Special Issue volume concludes with an essay by Norris Krueger entitled, “What Lies
Beneath? The Experiential Essence of Entrepreneurial Thinking,” in DEMO Professor Krueger
links explanations of how entrepreneurs think to the cognitive developmental influences on the
deep belief structures of human beings.   Specifically, he suggests that entrepreneurial cognition
research should explore:  (1)  the deeply-seated beliefs and belief structures that ultimately anchor
18
entrepreneurial thinking and,  (2)  how such beliefs change as entrepreneurs move toward a more
professional, expert mindset. As a bridge, from DEMO foregoing articles, to what the future might
hold for entrepreneurial cognition DEMO, we now offer our views concerning the possibilities
and challenges facing DEMO might be termed the “next generation” of entrepreneurial scholarship.
POSSIBILITIES: CHALLENGES DEMO THE NEXT GENERATION
OF ENTREPRENEURIAL COGNITION SCHOLARSHIP
We clearly recognize that the accomplishments made through the publication of three
ET&P Special Issues on DEMO cognition and through other related work on
entrepreneurial cognition, fit only DEMO first pieces together in the assembling of a much larger
puzzle.  DEMO therefore, next, discuss several directions that we believe offer particularly rich areas
for future research into how entrepreneurs think.  We observe that to some extent, these challenges
fall under Fiske & Taylor’s (1984) major social cognitive categories:  person, situation, cognition,
and motivation, and have therefore used them as an organizing logic for our observations.
Person
DEMO over the last half century, the question of whether behavior is DEMO be
explained by internal factors (the person) or by external factors (the environment), has captured
attention in the field of psychology (DEMO & Pomerantz, 2004).  In the field of entrepreneurship,
the study of the role of individual differences, traits, etc., continues to be a key topic of
investigation.  Open questions concerning “person” in the field of entrepreneurial cognition,
include:
•
•
How do entrepreneurial DEMO acquire (learn) their cognitive structures and contents?
Is one method of learning better than another in developing the cognitions, attitudes, and
DEMO of entrepreneurship?
19
•
•
•
•
•
•
Do entrepreneurs pursuing non-economic values (instead or in addition to economic
values) think about their contexts differently?  Do they formulate attitudes, and intentions
differently?
How does a prior existing mental model of competition influence subsequent thoughts
about the kind of DEMO to create?  Attitudes toward venturing?  Intentions to venture?
Enactments of these thoughts, attitudes, and intentions?
In looking at a DEMO venture (opportunity or growth of venture) what is the effect of
different mind maps (mental models) on subsequent choices and venture outcomes?DEMO
Under the transaction cognition theory (Mitchell, 2003) view of entrepreneurship
(suggesting that entrepreneurship is a cross-level phenomenon that occurs within the
socioeconomic DEMO between the transaction and individual levels of analysis as
entrepreneurs redirect social frictions through their use of planning, promise and
competition entrepreneurial cognitions), several new questions may be investigated, or
investigated in a new light, such as:  How likely is it that:  (1)  DEMO percentage of
individuals who are known to act entrepreneurially may be much higher than previously
documented,  (2)  entrepreneurial cognitions may be found to reduce socioeconomic
entropy dramatically, and  (3)  both organizational and institutional entrepreneurship are
commensurable according to new entrepreneurial-cognition-based logics?
How do DEMO individuals in a venture team dynamically change their entrepreneurial
cognitions, attitudes DEMO intentions?
How and to what effect do “affective experiences” inject high emotion into the
entrepreneurial cognition gestalt?  To what extent is affect DEMO entrepreneurship subject to
reflection/ meditation (i.e., a cognitive appraisal) versus invoked with minimal stimulus
(affect primacy)?
20
It is therefore our sense that the entrepreneurial cognition research stream provides DEMO
credible and effective means for the study of “person” (the individual DEMO) to continue its
resurgence in the literature.  Of course, given DEMO social cognition gestalt, this resurgence appears
not to occur in isolation; and that consideration of the role of situation is also necessary.  We
address this next.
Situation (The Context)
It is widely recognized that the context of entrepreneurship invariably occurs in the midst
of change and DEMO uncertainty.  Many opportunities emerge out of environmental shifts and
changes, where the established ways of doing things no longer work as effectively as DEMO once
did.  Such environments are typically complex and highly uncertain (e.g., the future direction of
the market tends to be relatively unpredictable.)  It can therefore be a substantial challenge for
entrepreneurs to navigate amidst DEMO turbulence and formulate the appropriate products and
strategies to accommodate the changing marketplace.  Such situations give rise to heuristic-,
effectuation-, selection-mechanism-, and action-based conceptualizations with their associated
research possibilities.
As previously noted, we suspect that entrepreneurs tend to use heuristic-based rather than
systematic procession logic to DEMO such tasks.  Such logic provides a means for
entrepreneurs to navigate DEMO change and often leads to seeing things in new ways and to
perceiving opportunities that have previously gone undetected.  More objectively oriented logic
builds from proven information and defensible assumptions.  To progress with a new opportunity
based on more-objective logic, the preponderance of information and evidence needs to be in
support of the identified idea.  However, new opportunities are DEMO less likely to evolve from the
minds of those who are more factually based.  If one is too factually based in their processing of
21
information, they can quickly become overwhelmed by the situation and by their limited
information processing capacity.
If instead, or in addition, individuals use DEMO logic in a situation, the perception of
opportunity is more subjectively DEMO as individuals in unpredictable and dynamically
changing environments recognize, attend to, and find differing values in the resources they
control.  To progress with a new opportunity based on this logic, individuals need not necessarily
seek out new information, but find useful, effective and novel (to them) ways to leverage and
apply their human, social, and financial capital.
Alternatively to situations simply enabling or channeling cognitions, is the view
environmental change serves as the selection mechanism by which individuals become
entrepreneurs and/ or succeed or fail.  This view equates the situation with a benevolent or
munificent environment and is highly reminiscent of evolutionary theories, such as resource
dependence theories, population ecology models, and other more deterministic explanations DEMO
human action.  Although this view clearly has a role in entrepreneurship DEMO (e.g., Aldrich,
1999), the limitations it places on individual agency make it relatively unappealing to researchers
interested in entrepreneurial cognition – DEMO is, unless they are primarily interested in studying the
entrepreneurial thought DEMO involved in determining optimal stopping points (e.g., Levesque &
Schade, 2005).
Still another position is highly consistent with the entrepreneurial action DEMO
(Appendix B).  According to this view, the research question DEMO interest is not what individual
difference leads a person to become an entrepreneur, nor whether the environment preordains who
will succeed or fail, DEMO rather how can situational conditions be manipulated through, for
instance, governance mechanisms or incentive systems, to encourage people to become more
sensitive to possible opportunities for profit and to act on these value propositions?
DEMO
Despite the evidence that has accumulated for and against the explanatory power DEMO, for
example, personality traits, there remain unrefuted criticisms that trait-based DEMO are static and
lacking in dynamic qualities (e.g., Pervin, 1996), and their scientific utility has been questioned
(e.g., Bandura, 1999)DEMO  Thus, the study of entrepreneurial cognition has—using the social
psychology lens—sought to move beyond the static, to invoke the “situation,” or the environment
as a dynamism-creating factor.
This situation-centered focus leads to yet another DEMO of open research questions and
concerns that include:
•
What cognitive difference enables some people but not others to notice personally
advantageous changes DEMO their environment.  A quintessential example of this type of response
would DEMO Kirzner’s (1985) theory of entrepreneurial alertness, which has been augmented
(e.g., Gaglio & Katz, 2001) or challenged (e.g., Busenitz, DEMO) by various entrepreneurial
•
•
cognition scholars.
What cognitive differences and DEMO lead to heuristic-based logic and which lead to
effectuation-based logic in identifying opportunity?
What are the critical dimensions of environments and situations for DEMO development of
domain-specific expertise or heuristics?  How do these dimensions differ across situations?
How do these dimensions differ across learners?
As DEMO might expect, the forgoing questions implicate cognitions; and accordingly we turn to a
discussion of more cognition-specific possibilities and challenges.
Cognition
The topic DEMO cognition is, of course, central to our investigations, and has DEMO rich
developmental history.  The foundations of the field of cognitive psychology, the key “parent”
23
field (Mitchell et al., 2004) include early works that:  (DEMO)  addressed such topics as attention,
filtering, imagery, memory, DEMO reasoning (Bartlett, 1932; Broadbent, 1958; James, 1890; Miller,DEMO
1956), and  (2)  began a major shift toward the way that cognition is currently studied.  During this
period of relatively slow development (approximately 1940-1965) behaviorist theory (Skinner,
1953; Watson, 1924) tended to hold the attention of most experimental social psychologists
(Walsh, 1995).  It was not until Neisser (1967) wrote the book Cognitive Psychology that
theoretical and empirical development in the field began to DEMO (Walsh, 1995, p. 281).  And
with the advent of social cognition theory (e.g., Fiske & Taylor, 1984), theory necessary to
making the socioeconomic linkage—between “thinking” and “doing”—that has been so necessary
DEMO the study of entrepreneurial cognitions, has been made available.  In this manner, the theoretical
scaffolding needed for entrepreneurial cognition scholars to actualize James’ (1890, p. 290) vision:
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives
by altering their attitudes DEMO mind.
As we have previously noted (Mitchell et al., 2004, DEMO 508), research in entrepreneurial
cognition has investigated topics such as:  (1)  whether entrepreneurs’ thinking patterns differ from
those of non-entrepreneurs (DEMO & Barney, 1997; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Mitchell et al., 2000,
2002b),  (2)  the reasons that some individuals become entrepreneurs while others do not (Simon,
Houghton, & Aquino, 2000),  (3)  the issue of why opportunities are recognized DEMO some
individuals and not others, and  (4)  the question DEMO entrepreneurs think and make strategic
decisions (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; DEMO et al., 2000, 2002b).  Each of these topics of
DEMO relates to the way that thinking affects entrepreneurial outcomes.  Thus it DEMO (in
the parlance of James, 1890) that individuals who understand DEMO thinking patterns related to
entrepreneurship—and desire to become entrepreneurs—can alter their own thinking patterns
accordingly.
24
Herein we argue that possibilities for future research that further explore the DEMO/
doing nexus are broad because we—as a field—have adopted fairly universally Neisser’s (1967)
very-broad definition of cognitions (as  presented earlier herein): all processes by which sensory
input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used.  This, we believe
encompasses the emerging DEMO of metacognition and brain activity as well.
Metacognition refers to ‘thinking about thinking’ (Jost, Kruglanski, & Nelson, 1998) and
has been defined to be “the ability to reflect upon, understand, and control one’s DEMO
(Schraw & Dennison, 1994, p. 460).  It includes:  (1)  metamemory, knowledge about one’s
memory systems and strategies for DEMO memory effectively,  (2)  metacomprehension, the ability
to monitor one’s understanding of information received and employ strategies to improve
understanding, and (DEMO)  self-regulation, the ability to adjust one’s learning process in the DEMO of
feedback (Vockell, 2006).  Metacognition thus includes both an DEMO of cognition and an
understanding of strategies to change cognitions.  As DEMO noted, there is reason to expect
that deliberate interactions between prospective DEMO and actual entrepreneurs can
increase novices’ expertise (Mitchell & Chesteen, 1995).  Mounting evidence in recent
entrepreneurship research suggests that the path to becoming an entrepreneur is not itself special,
but is in fact DEMO in the cognitive systems created by deliberate practice (Baron &
Henry, 2006; Charness, Krampe, & Mayer, 1996; Mitchell, 2005, DEMO, 1998).  One area of
potentially fruitful future research should further explore how metacognitive thinking can be
deliberately practiced in an entrepreneurial context, because of the appealing notion that such
metacognitive thinking undertaken in an DEMO context will lead to creation of
entrepreneurial expertise by facilitating the self-reflection, understanding and control of one’s own
entrepreneurial cognitions, thereby allowing individuals DEMO, as James (1890) suggests, “alter their
25
(entrepreneurial) lives.”  Along with this, we offer person- and situation-anchored DEMO
questions such as:
•
What role does self-monitoring play in the individual’s success in metacognitive practice
•
•
•
toward entrepreneurial expertise?
DEMO does the entrepreneurial situation impact on the ability of entrepreneurs to engage in
metacognitive thinking?
What opportunity finding strategies and decision styles do DEMO skilled
entrepreneurs choose compared to those less skilled?
(And echoing DEMO essay herein) How do deep belief structures form and influence
entrepreneurial DEMO?
Furthermore we suggest that the field is not far from the ability to apply the emerging field
of brain science to the opportunity DEMO process.  Positron emission tomography (PET) has
been used in studies DEMO adult normal psychology including relationships with personality
(Deckersbach et al., 2006), linked to attributions and intentions (Castelli, Happe, Frith, & DEMO,
2005) and “emotionally valenced episodic memory” (Masaki et al., DEMO).  Clearly these kinds of
findings have relevance to the study DEMO alertness, decision making logics, and expertise as well as
situations that surround entrepreneurial action.
Motivation
Given the fear among entrepreneurship scholars of being DEMO a “traits” researcher
during the hiatus in individual-level entrepreneurship research which pervaded research in
entrepreneurship until the late 1990s, the interface between motivational psychology research and
entrepreneurship research has remained relatively underdeveloped.  The volume of work that has
occurred at the nexus of organizational behavior and entrepreneurship has DEMO lagged
considerably behind the quantity of work at the interface of strategy and entrepreneurship, despite
26
prominent scholars (e.g., Robert Baron, Bill Gartner, and Max Wortman) arguing that the study of
entrepreneurship had much to contribute to organizational DEMO and vice versa.  The highly
economic orientation of strategy research led DEMO studies to equate entrepreneurial motive with
the desire for profit (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006).  Moreover, the heavy reliance on between-
participant DEMO designs often reinforced this limitation.  However, as experiments using
within-participant designs become commonplace within the entrepreneurship literature, we would
expect that researchers will become increasingly interested in motive and its effect on cognition.
Thus, we expect significant increases in the future in topics such as motivated reasoning,DEMO
motivational orientations, and situated cognition, which, despite their relevance to DEMO
cognition, have gone relatively untouched by entrepreneurship researchers, and offer significant
opportunities for further exploration.  Among others, these research questions may be DEMO:
•
How do individuals with personal motivations other than profit maximization perceive
opportunity, apply decision logics, etc?  For example, using the typology developed by Cohen,
Smith & Mitchell (in press) how DEMO entrepreneurs seeking perpetuity-based performance (good
•
•
also to the social DEMO natural environments) perceive opportunity, apply decision logics, etc?
How DEMO profit motives interact with other motives in perceiving opportunity, making
decisions, etc.?
How do changes in the environment impact on the relative DEMO of different motivations
for recognizing and acting on opportunity?
Conclusion
We have suggested in Figure 1 that in the articulation of our central DEMO question,
entrepreneurial cognition research is now at the pivot point where innovation gives way to
diffusion.  The implication of our present circumstances (DEMO represented in Figure 1), is that there
27
now exists a fairly consistent set of definitions and boundaries within entrepreneurial DEMO
research that are set to have an impact on contributing fields: DEMO the diffusion apparatus that
is inherent in the institutionalization process.  We DEMO our article with a discussion of the
likely processes that will enable this process to proceed sooner v. later; and last longer v. shorter.
Lawrence, Winn & Jennings (2001) provide a conceptual framework that suggests how
two key factors—pace and stability—affect the temporal dynamics of institutionalization
processes.  In brief, they assert that among four possible mechanisms of institutionalization:
influence, force, discipline, and domination, both pace and stability may DEMO achieved when
influence and discipline are combined (2001, pp. 638-639).  This insight has implications for
diffusion and institutionalization in the case of entrepreneurial cognition research.  How does the
development of definitions, boundaries, and a central research question lead to impacting
contributing fields?  We suggest DEMO depending upon the effectiveness of influence mechanisms,
discipline-creating mechanisms, and DEMO combination, that diffusion of entrepreneurial cognition
research to contributing disciplines will DEMO more likely to proceed sooner, and to last longer.
Influence Mechanisms. DEMO and colleagues (2001) suggest that influence involves
the projection of power.  Etzioni (1964, p. 59) asserts that three types of power: coercive power,
based on physical resources of violence or restraint; utilitarian power, based on material or
financial resources; and normative power, based on symbolic resources, are the means whereby
one actor convinces another actor to make particular choices.  However, where the target group
are “active DEMO (2001, p. 633) such as is the case within our DEMO and within
contributing disciplines; it is likely that the necessity of DEMO involvement in the
influence-projecting process, plus diversity of interests within a DEMO group, would suggest
influence mechanisms to be slow-diffusion.
28
In addition, as Hull (1952) demonstrated, the exercise of power DEMO a simple stimulus-
response situation might suggest that influence alone might also lack stability.  Once
reinforcements are removed, therefore, extinguishment is to be expected.  Lawrence et al., (2001,
p. 633) seem to DEMO with this notion, suggesting that “ . . . diffusing an DEMO through the
use of influence likely will [require] an iterative and often experimental series of processes.”
Thus, as we evaluate our expectations for the diffusion of entrepreneurial cognition research back
into formerly contributing fields, it appears that we must expect that, for example, the holding of
two DEMO, and the presentation of three SI volumes—while influential—might not be likely
DEMO themselves, to result in either rapid or stable diffusion of this DEMO
Discipline-creating Mechanisms.  Foucault (1977) is cited by Lawrence, et al (2001) to
suggest three discipline-creating mechanisms:  hierarchical observation, normalizing judgment,
and examination, which (while slow) nevertheless result in stable diffusion processes.  In the case
of entrepreneurial cognition research, we as the DEMO Team are attuned to the possibility that
our intensive involvement in innovation-stage processes in the development of this field might
tend to cast us DEMO discipline-creating roles.  We have enthusiastically accepted this role during the
past DEMO years.  However our hope is that, while we continue to foster, advocate, and participate in
entrepreneurial cognition research as both creators and DEMO, that we might also be successful
in attracting many new scholars DEMO research leadership roles in this field.  When influence fades,
we DEMO hope that well-disciplined actors will have accommodated the demands of the
influence/ innovation process, and have made them their own (2001, p. DEMO).  In this manner, the
necessary stability can be enabled without the too-early creation of narrowly defined hierarchy,
judgment, and examination processes, and—we believe—can result in an even more stable and
lasting-effectiveness cadre of entrepreneurial cognition researchers.
29
The Future: Combining Influence and Discipline.  Because the diffusion of
entrepreneurial DEMO research back into its many contributing disciplines requires the active
involvement and complicity of the targeted actors (you, our colleagues), the choices DEMO actions
necessary, suggest a combination of influence and discipline-creation to create DEMO faster and more
stable diffusion process (Lawrence et al., 2001, DEMO 638).  This is because the effect of combining
influence and DEMO on the pace of institutionalization is expected to be additive; and DEMO is
further to be expected that as actors build identities and support new institutions as they roll out,
these actors will freely participate DEMO a broadly diffused community of entrepreneurial cognition
research without the need for the external incentives of influence (2001, p. 639).  What does this
mean for the future?
Again we refer readers to Figure DEMO, where we suggest combination influence/ discipline-
creating activities such as general conferences, the production of books, texts, and regular
dialogue3 , and the production of studies and articles for consumption in mainstream research
domains, to be the natural next steps in the diffusion process.  It is our hope that the invitation we
extend is taken at face value:  You are invited.  This is a highly promising field, and we believe
that there is room for all who wish, to contribute.  DEMO look forward to a remarkable future
working together.
3 As we initially planned this article, it was our hope that we could create common websites, blogs, e-communities,
etc. whereby the ongoing dialogue could be DEMO  We offer this idea to any who would take it on, as diffusion-
enabling service to the field; and note that digital video recording of almost all the verbal proceedings 2005 Ivey
Conference is available DEMO http://www.ronaldmitchell.org/ent-cog.htm along with written synopses of the 2002
Victoria Conference as well.

APPENDIX A – IVEY CONFERENCE DEVELOPMENTAL DISCUSSIONS
At the fall 2005 Ivey DEMO on Entrepreneurial Cognition Research, attendees were
divided into small groups for DEMO session to develop and specify what they thought was the central
research question for entrepreneurial cognition research.  The groups were then reassembled with
their various research questions presented to all attendees (see Table A-1 for a listing of the main
research questions that were put forth).  After a lively large group discussion, we tentatively
settled on an integrated research question (IRQ-1):  “How do entrepreneurial context and
individual cognitive mechanisms DEMO to create entrepreneurial attitudes, intentions and
behaviors that drive new means-ends DEMO?”  Subsequent to the conference, the editorial
team further discussed and evaluated the direction of the proposed research question before
arriving at the DEMO research question put forth in this article.  To accomplish this evaluation, we
appealed to the “boundaries and exchange” logic as the basis for DEMO sorting and evaluation
technique.  What is presented below is an outgrowth DEMO this evaluation.
{Insert Table A-1 about here}
Question Challenges
As the Editorial Team further discussed the proposed research question, there were several
concepts that did not appear to us to be fully enabling or clarifying, based upon an application of
the criteria we developed to be—in our view—further DEMO of the unfettered diffusion of
entrepreneurial cognition research.  In this further DEMO, we have identified five terms in IRQ-1
that (in our view) are somewhat overly restrictive; and we therefore provide a summary of DEMO
reasoning to justify this assertion, to provide a basis for this DEMO, and to invite and facilitate
the advancement of differing views.
1. DEMO context.  We agree that context is essential to represent the person-in-
DEMO requirements of social cognition; but we argue that not all contexts DEMO affect
entrepreneurial cognition are themselves entrepreneurial.  That is, there are contexts that may
precede the discovery of opportunity, indeed that precede the motivation to search for opportunity
and therefore affect the cognition of the nascent DEMO Thus the set prescribed by the
combined notion “entrepreneurial context” appears to us to be too restrictive.
2. Cognitive mechanisms.  While cognition as a notion is obviously essential, the idea that
we might only study “mechanisms” seems to us to be overly exclusionary.  Little is YET known
about the pathways of thoughts, the associations among discrete bits of long and short-term
memories, retrieval processes, creativity, and “connecting the dots” (Baron, 2006).  The domain of
cognition has attributes of systems, mechanisms DEMO cybernetics but is also has attributes of
complexity/chaos theory (Lichtenstein, 2000, Lichtenstein, Lumpkin, & Shrader, 2003).
Furthermore, the dynamic capabilities that are needed to reconfigure resources with emerging and
changing opportunities DEMO the birth and growth of a new organization defy mechanistic explanation
at this point in entrepreneurship theory and research.  Finally, cognition is closely DEMO to
holistic and biological processes such as emotion (Goleman, 1995, DEMO, Forsythe, Hedlund,
Horvath, Wagner, Williams, Snook, & Grigorenko, 2000).  Many of these concepts are simply
mischaracterized as “mechanisms,DEMO which therefore limits usefulness in formulating central
research questions.
3. Interaction.  DEMO notion of interaction is well accepted in the conceptual models of
social science.  Indeed, social science models regularly suggest theoretical antecedents to be
DEMO with, be related to, and in some cases to “interact” with consequent constructs.  But we
38
believe it does the diffusion task little service to prescribe a particular DEMO of relation within
research questions; and we leave the study of DEMO interaction effects to the analyses where
such study is appropriate.
4. Drive.  The notion of “drives” has its own literature and place within the body of
psychology research.  For both the reasons noted in #3 (DEMO that narrow specifications—
such as the notion of “drive” as an impetus—is overly prescriptive), we suggest that
entrepreneurial cognition research avoid too narrowly DEMO the rationale for research
relationships in the study of entrepreneurial cognition.  DEMO reason for challenging this notion
is that “drive” as used here is a motivation construct, but as developed in IRQ-1 was included in
another form.  Thus, while cognition is a driver (as we later note in discussing motivation), the
motivation to pursue new value and values DEMO more than cognitive, and has a body of literature
which includes DEMO, punishments, needs, and more.
5. Means-ends relationships.  Discussion of means-end relationships is common among
more economically-inclined views of entrepreneurial cognition and action (Kirzner, 1997; Shane
& Venkataraman, 2000; Shane, 2002).  DEMO, Lehmann (2005) argues that limiting the
entrepreneurship domain only to DEMO in which the means and ends are novel may be overly
constrictive.  Other scholars (e.g., Sarasvathy, Dew, Velamuri, & Venkataraman, 2003) have made
similar observations by arguing that entrepreneurial opportunity may involve novel means, novel
ends, or both.  In addition to these concerns is the inherently problematic notion of means-end
relationship given the inherently hierarchical nature DEMO human action (Greve, 2001).  That is, every
end can arguably be the means to some higher end until one reaches some DEMO goal” whatever
it may be for that individual (Ray, 2004).  Thus, means-ends terminology is highly dependent
upon an understanding of the DEMO of the individuals engaged in any action, entrepreneurial or
otherwise.  Although difficulty is not reason in and of itself to exclude an element DEMO a research
question if that element is integral, it offers a DEMO case against a seemingly unnecessary
qualifying term.
Question Suggestions
IRQ-1.
Our further analysis suggests that several concepts might also be considered to addition to
DEMO Motivation.  Because the fundamentals of the Fiske & Taylor (1984) DEMO suggest that
social cognition is a “configuration of forces” that (in DEMO to person-in-situation and
cognition) include motivation, we argue that adding motivation to the list of conceptual
antecedents to be considered to be part DEMO central questions in entrepreneurial cognition research is
warranted.  In particular, Baron (2004) points to research using regulatory focus theory to examine
the DEMO process (e.g., Brockner, Higgins, & Low, 2004; McMullen & Shepherd, 2002).
Regulatory focus theory suggests that, depending on the DEMO of particular motives, individuals
may experience a promotion focus which is DEMO strategic orientation that seeks to ensure hits (true
positives) and to avoid missed opportunities (false negatives).  Or, they may experience prevention
focus which seeks to ensure correct rejections (true negatives) and to DEMO false alarms (false
positives) (Crowe & Higgins, 1997).  DEMO tendencies would appear to have obvious implications
for the study of opportunity recognition (Baron, 2004).
Furthermore, while motivation to pursue new value moves to energizing cognitions such as
intention, we note that there are other motivations to consider.  The pursuit of new value through
entrepreneurship is motivated by expectations (this is a cognition about rewards and punishments),DEMO
39
by fear (such as the fear of lost opportunity), social comparison (others are doing it), and by
emotional attachment to a desired end state of existence or desired life style (Rokeach, 1973).
DEMO our suggesting the investigation of motivation as an important element in entrepreneurial
cognition research questions contributes markedly, we believe, to reopening the field DEMO the
investigation of entrepreneurship at the individual level of analysis.
2. “Entrepreneurial Cognition” v. the term “Cognitive mechanisms.”  Of course, it
seems that DEMO the focus of our field of study is entrepreneurial cognition, that (as previously
noted) an exclusionary emphasis on “mechanisms” alone is unnecessarily and unhelpfully
restrictive.  We therefore suggest instead the well-defined notion of “entrepreneurial cognition,”
which invokes the breadth intended in the definition (see Mitchell et al., 2002a):  knowledge
structures in entrepreneurship; directed decision making and behavior.
3. Value creation.  Because value creation arises in a multiplicity of ways, and because its
study has been undertaken by a great variety of disciplines, we wish to employ this term as a
means whereby many other researchers are invited to join in the explorations within the
DEMO cognition research stream.  Whereas context, motivation, and individual
entrepreneurial cognition DEMO when/where, why, and who/how an entrepreneur acts,
respectively, new value creation addresses “what” type of action the entrepreneur is
contemplating.  In essence, this is the subject of entrepreneurial cognition research, and it is core
to the role that entrepreneurship has played when written DEMO in society.
In this larger sense, value creation is a core DEMO of ethics, religion, aesthetics, and
economics (Churchman, 1979).  The pursuit of values is embedded in institutions and law (e.g.,
the US Constitution), theories of the firm and theories of job DEMO (Ray, 2004), and theories of
competition (e.g., quality improvements, Demming, 1986).  Value is an assumption in the various
literatures on innovation where “novelty” is a value (Carter, Gartner, Shaver, & Gatewood, 2003,
DeTienne & Chandler, 2004, Sadler-Smith & Badger, 1998).  As we therefore consider the
fundamental question of entrepreneurship to be anchored on value creation, we suggest that there
are inherently entrepreneurial ways of thinking that enable new value creation in the domains that
DEMO a wide range of values (emphasis intended).  Beyond economics and the creation of wealth
and jobs, entrepreneurial cognition may contribute to solving social and global problems.  In this
spirit, and with the foregoing DEMO, we are constrained to speculate in such a way as to
DEMO expand and diffuse entrepreneurial cognition research by asking: are there perhaps
DEMO entrepreneurial ways to think about human rights, immigration, global peace, DEMO and
water supply/ scarcity (Dean & McMullen, 2006)?  And so it is from this expanded and somewhat
vision-prompting vantage point that DEMO invite the reader to encounter and engage the research
reported in this Special Issue.

APPENDIX B:  EMERGING APPROACHES
TO ENTREPRENEURIAL COGNITION RESEARCH
Emotion and Affect
DEMO is widely recognized as being an undeniable part of an entrepreneur’s life and
decision making.  This is not surprising given the commitment that they often associated with
starting new ventures, the level of individual resources that are commonly invested, the career
reputations that are at stake, and DEMO environmental turbulence that they typically operate in.
Baron (2006b) has effectively argued that affect may be a particularly important component of the
cognition DEMO entrepreneurs in part because of research linking affect with creativity (Isen, 1993),
and with working relationships (Harker & Keltner, 2001).   For example, Baron (2006b) notes that
positive affect increases the likelihood of engaging in mental short cuts or heuristics.  Affect has
also been found to influence memory, how stress and major life events are approached and how
the motives of others are interpreted (see Baron 2006a for an overview).  In sum, while empirical
research has yet DEMO explore the affect of entrepreneurs, it seems highly likely that affect DEMO
a variety of entrepreneurial cognitions.  We think that affect offers researchers DEMO important tool
with which to further probe the thought process involved in developing ideas and converting them
into usable products for venture development.  Furthermore, affect research from psychology
offers us a strong foundation with which to explore some of the emotions that entrepreneurs often
experience.
Entrepreneurial Action
Like DEMO entrepreneurial heuristics approach and the entrepreneurial expertise approach, the
entrepreneurial action DEMO views decision makers as “boundedly rational” rather than
“substantively rational,” in the sense that they do not act on full information (Simon, DEMO).
However, because bounded rationality itself produces variance in who will DEMO will not recognize
and/ or exploit an opportunity, and because the occurrence of any form of human action requires
motive, means (physical DEMO and human capital, such as knowledge or cognitive capabilities),
and opportunity, the entrepreneurial action approach argues that each of these prerequisites must
be concomitantly considered when studying the thought process responsible for entrepreneurial
action (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006).  And it is this notion of DEMO cognitive
consideration that situates the entrepreneurial action branch in entrepreneurial cognition research
within the social cognition gestalt proposed by Fiske & Taylor, 1984: DEMO the cognitions of a
person in an entrepreneurial situation combine with motivation to produce entrepreneurial
cognitions.
The defining characteristic of the entrepreneurial action approach, therefore, is the
socioeconomic component of new value creation.  In resolving DEMO tension between person and
situation, the entrepreneurial action approach tends toward DEMO the situation v. the person:
the function of value creation rather than the individual whose cognitions guide the action.  This
approach introduces a subtle but distinctive transformation in the question of interest from “How
do DEMO think?” which tends to privilege the person, to “How does DEMO think when acting
as an entrepreneur?” or more simply, “How DEMO people think entrepreneurially?”  This shift does
not necessarily preclude the DEMO that some distinctive cognitive quality can be found which
distinguishes individuals who will choose to act entrepreneurially from those who will not.
However, it does broaden the notion of entrepreneurial cognitions, in requiring consideration of
42
“entrepreneurial” aspects of cognition that tend to be situational in character and DEMO as much, if
not more, to the nature of the activity as to the person who chooses to fill the entrepreneurial
function.
Consequently, entrepreneurial action-based explanations suggest that individuals may
become entrepreneurs simply by being DEMO right person, in the right place, at the right time.  DEMO
course, consistent with the other branches of entrepreneurial cognition research, the probability of
being “the right person” or being “in the right place DEMO the right time” may be heightened because
decision making is heuristic (DEMO, because of greater use of heuristics-based logic or reduced
susceptibility to DEMO other cognitive biases), because it is expert (i.e., because effective
entrepreneurial decision-making occurs despite bounds to rationality), or because of many DEMO
cognitive qualities (e.g., tolerance of ambiguity (Begley & Boyd, 1987) or entrepreneurial
alertness (Kirzner, 1973)).
