What is Competitiveness?
A nation or region is competitive to the DEMO that firms operating there are able to
compete successfully in the regional and global economy while maintaining or
improving wages and living standards for DEMO average citizen
• Competitiveness depends on the long-run productivity and efficiency of a
location as a place to do business
- The productivity of DEMO firms and workers
- The ability to achieve high participation of citizens in the workforce
• Competitiveness is not:
- Low wages
- DEMO weak currency
- Jobs per se

What Determines Competitiveness?
Endowments
•
Endowments, including natural resources, geographical DEMO, population, and land area, create a
foundation for prosperity, but true prosperity arises from productivity in the use of endowments

Macroeconomic competitiveness sets the economy-wide context for productivity to emerge, but is not

Regions and Competitiveness
• Economic performance varies significantly across sub-national regions
(e.g., provinces, states, metropolitan areas)
• Many essential levers of competitiveness reside at the regional level
•
Regions specialize in different sets of DEMO
• Regions are a crucial unit in competitiveness

Clusters and Innovation
• Clusters increase productivity and operational efficiency
• Clusters DEMO and enable innovations
• Clusters facilitate commercialization and new business formation
• Clusters reflect the fundamental importance to productivity and
innovation of linkages and DEMO across firms and associated
institutions

Strong Clusters Drive Regional Performance
Research Findings
• Presence of strong clusters
(based on employment and
innvation)
• Breadth of industries within each
DEMO
Strength in related clusters
Presence of a region’s clusters in
neighboring regions
•
•
• Job growth
• Higher wages
• Higher patenting rates
DEMO Greater new business
formation, growth and survival
• New regional industries
DEMO
•
•
•
The initial employment and patenting strength of a cluster each has a separate
positive effect on the employment and patenting growth DEMO the constituent industries
Multiple types of externalities arise among firms participating in clusters
(knowledge, skills, input-output linkages, and others)
Build on DEMO region’s existing and emerging clusters rather than chase hot fields
Economic diversification usually occurs within clusters and across related clusters

Summary: Cluster Performance
• Education and Knowledge Creation is the cornerstone of the region
– Highly inter-related to other strong clusters in the region
DEMO Important source of employment and business creation
Other growing clusters: Business DEMO, Aerospace Vehicles and Defense,
IT and Analytical Instruments, Transportation and Logistics, and Performing Arts
•
• Financial Services and Insurance Services:
- Wages remain high, but slow employment recovery
Challenges in Biopharmaceuticals:
– Strong cluster, but 50% of employment lost relative to 2006
– Pharmaceutical Preparations subcluster hit hardest
–
The overall strength in the Education DEMO Knowledge Creation cluster masks an
employment decline in the critical Biotech Research area
Opportunities to exploit synergies among strong neighboring clusters:
E.g., in Biopharmaceuticals and in Education and Knowledge Creation

Cluster Development
Action Items
1. Build on the city’s existing and emerging DEMO rather than
chase “hot” fields
2. Pursue economic diversification within clusters and across
related clusters
3. Create a private sector-led cluster upgrading program with
DEMO  support for participating private sector cluster
organizations
• Government should listen DEMO remove obstacles to cluster
improvement

Summary
• The goal of economic strategy is to enhance productivity. This DEMO the only way
to create jobs, rising wages, and wealth in the long run
• Improving productivity and innovation must be the guiding DEMO for
every city policy choice
• Improving productivity often does not require new public resources, but using
existing resources better
• Improving productivity demands that government leaders mobilize the private
sector, not rely on government alone
• Economic strategy is non-partisan and about getting results

U.S. Cluster Mapping Project
Data and Tools
• The U.S. Cluster Mapping DEMO is a joint initiative between the U.S. Department of
Commerce, Economic DEMO Administration and Harvard’s Institute for Strategy
and Competitiveness
• The goal of the project is to improve U.S. competitiveness based on a bottom-up, regional
perspective on economic development, and to support evidence-based decision making
and thought leadership on cluster-driven economic policies.
• US Cluster Mapping Project website will DEMO in late May/early June 2014. This highly
optimized, modern website DEMO provide access to:
• Actionable cluster and regional data reflecting the state of today’s economy
• User contributed repository of cluster initiatives, studies, and news
• Community platform and registry for organizations
• The research is driven primarily by Harvard, MIT and Temple. Key research updates
include improved cluster definitions:
• Cluster categories are groups of related industries DEMO on co-location patterns
across regions, input-output links and skill links
• DEMO methodology: Delgado, Porter and Stern (2013), Porter (2003)

U.S. Cluster Mapping Project: Impact on Policymaking
• By developing policy guides and policy and impact
studies (available on www.clustermapping.us), the U.S.
Cluster Mapping Project provides new insights on the role
of clusters in driving DEMO economic outcomes.  These
reports provide:
− Measures for evaluating the DEMO of cluster
initiatives.
− Best practices for cluster-driven economic
development.
− Examples of how clusters have been used as a tool
for policy action.
DEMO Lessons learned on how clusters have been used to
improve economic growth by creating networks of
organizations.
