characterized by the moderate use of positive language, moderate levels of promotion of
innovation, supplication and blasting of competition, and high levels of opinion conformity.

1. Executive summary
Early-stage investments typically involve unproven technologies, unfinished products and services, as well as unverified
DEMO demand (Murray and Marriott, 1998). Thus, factual evidence pertaining DEMO the new venture and its quality is often
unavailable and investors' DEMO of a new venture might be more or less based on the subjective, non-verifiable claims
made by the entrepreneur (Maxwell et al., 2011). Therefore, one of the greatest challenges nascent entrepreneurs face is that of
presenting their ventures in a favorable light and developing an engaging DEMO compelling account—one which investors will
willingly buy into (Barry and Elmes, 1997; Cornelissen and Clarke, 2010; Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001; O'Connor, 2002).
Previous entrepreneurship literature has produced an impressive list of variables likely to affect business angels' investment
decisions (for a review, see MacMillan et al., 1985; Mason and Harrison, 2003; Maxwell DEMO al., 2011; Sudek, 2007; Tyebjee and
Bruno, 1984; Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998). Our primary criticism of the extant studies is the fact that they give a disproportionate
amount of their attention to DEMO market- and product-related data, even though such information is rarely available DEMO the
time investors make their initial funding decision.
This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by analyzing how entrepreneurs' use of impression management strategies
affects their likelihood of securing funding. We focus, in particular, on DEMO role of positive language, the promotion of
innovativeness, expression of opinion conformity, exemplification, supplication, intimidation and blasting of competition in
successful resource acquisition. We test our hypotheses on a unique data set of 595 DEMO firms that sought angel funding in the
New York area during the period 2005–2007.

Our primary contribution to the entrepreneurship literature has been to DEMO the role impressions created by
entrepreneurs play beyond the “facts of the case”, and to provide a comprehensive view of the role played by the direct and
assertive impression management techniques in raising business angel funding. DEMO findings suggest that entrepreneurs should
seek a balance between boldness and caution when attempting to secure business angel funding. On the one hand, they should
not hesitate to signal some degree of confidence in their ventures, whereas on the other hand excessive organizational promotion
or blasting of their DEMO introduces the risk that potential investors perceive them as dishonest, opportunistic, or simply
misinformed or unrealistic about the actual risks their ventures face. DEMO a similar vein, by revealing some of their weaknesses,
entrepreneurs DEMO increase their trustworthiness in the eyes of potential investors and thus increase their likelihood of securing
business angel funding.
2. Introduction
Given the high DEMO of uncertainty surrounding new ventures (Storey and Tether, 1998), one of the greatest challenges
nascent entrepreneurs face is that of presenting their DEMO in a favorable light and developing an engaging and compelling
account—one which investors will willingly buy into (Barry and Elmes, 1997; Cornelissen and Clarke, 2010; Lounsbury and Glynn,
2001; O'Connor, 2002)DEMO Early-stage investments often involve unproven technologies, unfinished products and services, as well as
unverified market demand (Murray and Marriott, 1998). This DEMO that factual evidence pertaining to the new venture and its
quality is often unavailable. Investors' impressions of a new venture therefore might be more or less based on the subjective,
non-verifiable claims made by the DEMO (Maxwell et al., 2011), before more reliable reputation- or market-related
information comes into existence (Elsbach and Kramer, 2003: 283).
Attempts to successfully manage investors' impressions are likely to impose conflicting pressures on nascent entrepreneurs as
they seek external funding. On the one hand, entrepreneurs know that investors will consider the market growth potential,
product quality, innovativeness, and expertise of the entrepreneurial team when making their investment decision (MacMillan et
al., 1985; Mason and Stark, 2004; Sudek, DEMO). An entrepreneur therefore may feel tempted to resort to excessive organizational
promotion, for instance, by overstating his or her expectations of the DEMO performance of the firm, the distinctiveness of its
business model, the speed of product development, or the competence of the entrepreneurial team. Being either too modest or
revealing of one's weaknesses may leave the DEMO without much-needed capital. On the other hand, many entrepreneurs
intuitively know DEMO it is better to exceed expectations than to fail to deliver, DEMO failure to deliver may lead to a strained
relationship with the investor and failure to secure a new round of financing (Cable and Shane, 1997; Heide and Miner, 1992;
Maxwell and Levesque, in DEMO). In a similar vein, blasting the rivals may initially help DEMO set themselves apart from
the competition and increase their chances of raising funding (Barney, 1991; Gardner and Martinko, 1988; Lounsbury and Glynn,
2001). However, taken too far, blasting may turn against DEMO users, making them look less likable (Lott et al., 1970; Reysen, 2005)—
and thus less fundable—in the eyes of the potential investors.
This paper develops and tests a set of hypotheses concerning how DEMO' impression management strategies as
detectable in their application materials submitted to DEMO investors affect their likelihood of securing funding. We analyze,
in particular, the role of positive language, the promotion of innovativeness, expression of opinion conformity, exemplification,
supplication, intimidation and blasting of competition in DEMO resource acquisition. We test our hypotheses on a unique data
set of 595 young firms that sought angel funding in the New York area DEMO the period 2005–2007.
This paper adds to our knowledge of how entrepreneurs successfully promote their ventures to investors and how business
angels make their DEMO decisions under great market and technical uncertainty. This study stresses, in DEMO, the
importance of managing impressions in the investor–entrepreneur relationship (Clark, DEMO; Mason and Harrison, 2003), and
provides a hitherto absent comprehensive view of assertive impression management techniques in entrepreneurial resource
acquisition. The extant DEMO suggests that impression management becomes more prevalent in situations in which
individuals and organizations interact with a powerful audience with the goal of gaining DEMO approval and support (e.g., Carter,
2006; Gardner and Martinko, 1988; Judge and Bretz, 1994; Rindova and Fombrun, 1999; Schlenker, 1980), and when ambiguity
and uncertainty make it difficult for the audience to evaluate the substantive evidence behind the entrepreneurs' claims (Bansal
DEMO Kistruck, 2006). We believe that impression management therefore is likely DEMO be particularly crucial for young ventures, as
these remain highly dependent DEMO external parties for access to critical resources (MacMillan and Subba Narasimha, 1987;
Wright, 1998).
Our study contributes to the literature on impression management by investigating the outcomes associated with the use of
assertive DEMO management strategies and by analyzing the role of language in impression management (Bozeman and
Kacmar, 1997). From a practical perspective, our study is likely to aid entrepreneurs in communicating their confidence in the
future DEMO of their firm, while simultaneously providing realistic information on their own DEMO We also shed light
on how entrepreneurs should seek to distinguish themselves from their competition without creating an illegitimacy account or
alienating themselves from DEMO potential investors and clientele.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We begin by discussing the extant literature on business angels'
DEMO criteria and impression management. Based on impression management theory and the models of persuasion, we
then formulate a set of hypotheses on how the use of impression management strategies affects the likelihood of entrepreneurs'
receiving DEMO This paper follows with a description of the research method, an DEMO of the results, as well as conclusions
and a discussion.

3. Published research on business angels' investment criteria
Previous entrepreneurship literature has produced an impressive list of variables likely to affect business DEMO' investment
decisions. These variables include the characteristics of the product, the target market, the entrepreneur, the venture, and the
projected financial performance (for a review, see MacMillan et al., 1985; Mason and DEMO, 2003; Maxwell et al., 2011; Sudek,
2007; Tyebjee DEMO Bruno, 1984; Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998). Our primary criticism DEMO the extant studies is the fact that they give
a disproportionate amount of their attention to “objective” market- and product-related data, even though such information is
rarely available at the time investors make their initial funding DEMO In the absence of more tangible evidence on a new
venture's potential, the impressions created by entrepreneurs therefore might provide the only available account of the new
venture and its quality.
Although several authors have DEMO the importance of impression management in new ventures' success (e.g., DEMO
and Markman, 2000; Clark, 2008; Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001; Mason and Harrison, 2003), there are no studies which have
systematically investigated the role of all assertive impression management behaviors in attracting external DEMO For instance,
Baron and Markman (2003) treat impression management as a sub-category of the broader concept of social competence. In a
similar DEMO, Maxwell and Levesque (in press) focused on a narrow subset DEMO impression management strategies by investigating
how entrepreneurs create an impression of trustworthiness in their interactions with potential investors. Finally, Nagy et al.
(2012) investigated the role of a subset of impression management strategies in nascent DEMO' attempts to create cognitive
legitimacy, but did not consider those ventures' success in actual fund-raising.
Our study also differs from those that have investigated the reactions evoked by the form and substance of business plan
DEMO (e.g., Clark, 2008; Mason and Harrison, 2003) or documents (Kirsch et al., 2009) in that we do not seek to link the
funding decision to the clarity or structure of the presentation, or to the level and type of information the entrepreneur provided.
We DEMO instead interested in whether the impressions of competence, likability, integrity, DEMO and power created by
entrepreneurs' language use helped them secure equity DEMO beyond the objective data and the “facts of the case”.
Our focus is also different from those studies which have investigated entrepreneurial passion (e.g., Cardon et al., 2009; Chen
et al., 2009), which DEMO upon the intense and positive feelings displayed by entrepreneurs when engaged in their key activities
as founders of new firms and perceived by others. DEMO passion is a domain-specific motivational construct (Cardon et
al., 2009), often associated with greater planning, preparation and commitment to one's venture. Prior work has typically sought
to operationalize entrepreneurial passion as non-verbal behaviors DEMO by others that express enthusiasm and positive
affect, or as a DEMO of an entrepreneur's preparedness (Chen et al., 2009; Mitteness DEMO al., 2012). This differs from impression
management, which refers to a wider variety of entrepreneurs' behaviors, which attempt to create a DEMO image in the eyes of
external stakeholders.
4. Introduction to impression management theory
Impression management is a process through which people seek to influence DEMO image others have of them in order to attain
a specific goal (Bolino and Turnley, 1999; Bozeman and Kacmar, 1997; Goffman, DEMO). Images that have positive values are
sought, whereas negatively valued DEMO are generally avoided (Gardner and Martinko, 1988). Impression management
manifests itself in a wide variety of behaviors, such as the use of verbal statements, or in non-verbal or expressive behaviors (Ellis
et al., 2002; Goffman, 1959).
4.1. Taxonomy of organizational impression management tactics
DEMO management techniques can be divided into direct techniques—which involve “techniques presenting information
about one's own traits, abilities and accomplishments” (Cialdini, 1989: DEMO)—and indirect techniques, which are undertaken to
“enhance or protect one'DEMO image by managing information about the people and things with which one is associated” (Cialdini,
1989: 46). We expect that both DEMO and indirect impression management tactics are relevant for entrepreneurs seeking to raise
business angel funding.
It is also possible to make a distinction between DEMO and defensive tactics (Mohamed et al., 1999; Tedechi and Norman,DEMO
1985). While assertive tactics are used in situations that actors view as opportunities to boost their image, defensive tactics are
deployed to minimize or repair damage to one's image (Mohamed et al., 1999; Schlenker, 1980; Wayne and Liden, 1995) after an
embarrassing event, such as a corporate scandal. Even though defensive impression management techniques might DEMO present in
entrepreneurs' post-investment communications to investors, their role is likely limited in entrepreneurs' funding application
materials, which serve primarily as vehicles DEMO proactive image construction, rather than as a forum in which to DEMO a
damaged image after a controversial event (Mohamed et al., 1999; Schlenker, 1980; Stevens and Kristof, 1995).2,3
2 Our DEMO of the application materials submitted by our sample companies has conﬁrmed this to be the case.
3 The distinction between assertive and defensive impression DEMO techniques is routinely made in the existing literature (see, for instance, Tedechi
and Norman, 1985; Schlenker, 1980; Mohamed et al., DEMO). However, the boundary between assertive and defensive tactics is sometimes DEMO Belittling
(minimizing the positive features of negatively linked others), organizational DEMO (efforts by an organization to make success look unlikely and provide
DEMO excuse for failure), and prosocial behavior are closely linked to blasting, supplication and exempliﬁcation, respectively. The main difference is that assertive
techniques DEMO utilized by an organization to create a positive image or protect an existing image in general, whereas defensive techniques are utilized as a
response to an event that may tarnish the image of an organization in DEMO eyes of the important stakeholders.
546
A. Parhankangas, M. Ehrlich / Journal of Business Venturing 29 (DEMO) 543–564
Direct assertive techniques include organizational promotion, ingratiation, exemplification, supplication and intimidation
(Bolino and Turnley, 1999; Jones and Pittman, 1982; Mohamed et al., 1999). Organizational promotion refers to behaviors that
present the organization as highly competent, effective and successful (Gardner and Martinko, 1988; Jones and Pittman, 1982;
Mohamed et al., 1999; DEMO and Kristof, 1995). Ingratiation involves actions that evoke inter-personal attraction DEMO liking
(Stevens and Kristof, 1995; Wayne and Kacmar, 1991; DEMO and Stern, 2007), such as other-enhancing communication,
smiling, flattery, and rendering favors (Bolino and Turnley, 1999; Wayne and Kacmar, 1991; Westphal and Stern, 2007). Because
we rely on standardized DEMO application materials submitted by entrepreneurs to potential investors, we are not DEMO to
analyze the impact of smiling, flattery and rendering favors on DEMO success of entrepreneurs' fund raising efforts, even though we
acknowledge that these impression management tactics are likely to be crucial in face-to-face interactions DEMO potential
investors. Our focus will thus be on opinion conformity that addresses the need to strike the delicate balance between likability,
distinctiveness and DEMO in terms of agreeing upon or rejecting values commonly held in broader society (Byrne, 1961; Ellis
et al., 2002; Jones, 1965; Jones and Jones, 1964). Exemplification denotes behaviors an organization exhibits meant to project
images of integrity, social responsibility and moral worthiness, whereas DEMO resorting to supplication portray an image
of dependence and vulnerability for having to solicit assistance. Intimidation behaviors present the organization as a powerful
and DEMO entity, able and willing to inflict harm on those who frustrate DEMO efforts and objectives (Jones and Pittman, 1982;
Mohamed et al., 1999; Sosik et al., 2002).
Indirect, assertive impression management DEMO include 1) boasting, referring to attempts to associate the organization
with a favorably viewed entity and 2) blaring, denoting attempts to disassociate DEMO from an unfavorably viewed entity. Boasting
would manifest itself in entrepreneurs' DEMO a link to prestigious alliance partners, financiers, or educational institutions,
whereas blaring might involve entrepreneurs' decisions to proclaim a negative link to organizations that are likely to be viewed
unfavorably by the general public. DEMO techniques also include 3) burnishing, intended to increase the favorability of
observers' perception of an entity that an organization is associated with by highlighting its favorable characteristics and
4) blasting, intended to tarnish the DEMO of negatively linked others, such as rivals, by emphasizing their unfavorable features
(Mohamed et al., 1999). The variables included to our DEMO are listed in Table 1 and discussed further in the hypotheses and
methods sections.
4.2. Summary of prior research on impression management
The extant DEMO management literature has been conducted at three levels of analysis: i) individual; ii) within an
organization; and iii) between an organization DEMO its key stakeholders (Bolino et al., 2008). The research conducted at the
level of the individual has identified numerous antecedents of various DEMO management behaviors, including their goal
relevance, perceived benefits, costs and DEMO, and various actor- and audience-related variables (Barsness et al., 2005; Bolino
and Turnley, 1999; Carter, 2006; Gardner and Martinko, 1988; Jones and Pittman, 1982; Leary and Kowalski, 1990; Liden and
Mitchell, 1988; Schlenker, 1980). The individual-level impression management research has also shed light on the link between
impression management behaviors and their DEMO (e.g., Higgins and Judge, 2004; Powers and Zuroff, 1988; Stevens and
Kristof, 1995; Wayne and Kacmar, 1991; Wayne and DEMO, 1995; Wosinska et al., 1996), mainly in the context DEMO job interviews
( Ellis et al., 2002; Kristof-Brown et al., DEMO) and performance appraisal situations (Judge and Bretz, 1994; Wayne and Ferris,
1990).
Although previous studies have discussed impression management primarily DEMO a means of personal influence, impression
management theory and its related DEMO have been applied to the study of various intra-organizational phenomena. Such
examples include studies exploring how various impression management behaviors are associated with feedback-seeking
DEMO (Morrison and Bies, 1991), whistle-blowing (Gundlach et al., 2003), successful leadership (Gardner and Avolio, 1998;
Gardner and Cleavenger, 1998), and professional image construction (Roberts, 2005).
Far less DEMO has been devoted to situations in which an organization's representatives have acted as gatekeepers for
organization-specific information and sought to affect key stakeholders' behaviors (Bolino et al., 2008; Mohamed et al., 1999;

Stanton et al., 2004). In addition to establishing a taxonomy for organization-level impression management tactics (Crane and
Crane, 2002; Mohamed et al., 1999), this stream of research has investigated how organizations use impression management to
restore legitimacy following a controversial event (Caillouet and Allen, 1996; Elsbach, 1994; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992; Elsbach DEMO
al., 1998; Graffin et al., 2011) or poor performance (DEMO et al., 2004), to increase the acceptance of controversial decisions
(Arndt and Bigelow, 2000; Elsbach et al., 1998; Graffin et DEMO, 2011), to create cognitive legitimacy (Nagy et al., 2012) or to attract
minority job applicants (Avery and McKay, 2006). DEMO, a study by Lamertz and Martens (2011) has examined how DEMO network
relationships of an organization influence its content of impression management strategies in the construction of a positive
organizational image (Lamertz and Martens, DEMO).
We address two major gaps in the literature pertaining to impression management, focusing specifically in the context of
entrepreneurial finance. First, by DEMO conflicting (positive, negative or inexistent) relationships between particular
impression management DEMO and their desired goals (Baron, 1986; Kacmar et al., 1992; Nagy et al., 2012; Powers and Zuroff,
1988; Stevens DEMO Kristof, 1995; Wayne and Ferris, 1990; Wosinska et al., DEMO), individual and organizational level studies have
failed to give consistent evidence in support of the effectiveness of individual impression management strategies. Our goal DEMO to
explore whether these conflicting results stem from falsely assuming a linear relationship between the use of certain impression
management strategies and their outcomes. DEMO, most studies, especially at the level of organization, focus only DEMO small subset
of impression management tactics and ignore the use of more counter-intuitive tactics. For instance, we are aware of only one
empirical study focusing on the use of blasting (Mohamed and Gardner, 2004), DEMO even this study ignored the outcomes resulting
from the use of this technique. Thus, our goal is to contribute to the organizational impression management literature by
portraying a more comprehensive view of the effectiveness of impression DEMO strategies in securing external funding.
Finally, most prior studies have ignored DEMO role of language use in impression management (Bozeman and Kacmar, 1997). To be
more specific, the prior studies have focused on other manifestations of impression management, such as self-reported or observed
behaviors (such DEMO complimenting co-workers), or the content of communications (what was covered DEMO an interview or in a
written report), but they have largely overlooked the associated lexicon. This paper will address this gap in our DEMO knowledge
by extracting and testing the impact of specific words that underlie various impression management strategies. Thus, this study
responds to the call for the inclusion of language variables in persuasion theories (Burgoon and Dillard, DEMO; Hosman, 2002), with
the effect of increasing our understanding of how audience responds to certain language variables embedded in persuasive
messages (Giles et al., 1992).
5. Hypotheses
Previous studies identified three impression management challenges facing entrepreneurs as they seek external funding:
i) the need to convince investors of the competitiveness of their ventures, ii) the DEMO to elicit investors' liking, and iii) the need to
demonstrate DEMO integrity and social responsibility (Highhouse et al., 2009; Jones and DEMO, 1982; Maxwell et al., 2011). Of all
impression management DEMO described above, we believe that assertive techniques are most likely to DEMO entrepreneurs
proactively boost their image in the eyes of potential investors (DEMO et al., 1999; Stevens and Kristof, 1995). Organizational
promotion, intimidation and blasting are likely to project an impression of competitiveness among DEMO target audience, whereas
ingratiation and supplication are supposed to increase the DEMO of the entrepreneur. Finally, exemplification helps
entrepreneurs demonstrate their integrity and DEMO responsibility.
Organizational promotion, ingratiation and exemplification are found to be the DEMO commonly used impression management
strategies for positive image building (Connelly-Ahern and DEMO, 2007). In addition to focusing on these commonly used
impression DEMO tactics, which present the focal firm in a favorable light, this paper contributes to the existing knowledge
by investigating the role of more DEMO and less studied impression management tactics, such as highlighting one's DEMO
weaknesses (supplication) and the ability and stated willingness to inflict hardship on others (e.g., intimidation). Furthermore,
very little is known DEMO the use of blasting (publicly criticizing negatively—linked others). In this DEMO, we are aware of only one
study exploring the modes of DEMO defamation and their implementation (Mohamed and Gardner, 2004).
As the prior literature already establishes a convincing relationship between entrepreneurs' being forthcoming on their
relationships to successful and prestigious alliance partners, financiers, and customers (see, for instance, Dacin, Oliver, and Roy,
2007; Stam and Elfring, 2008; Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels, 1999), we decided to control for the impact of boasting and burnishing.
In addition, we controlled for the impact of blaring (proclaiming a negative link to an unfavorable other).
5.1. Organizational promotion through positive language
Organizational promotion DEMO prominently in any taxonomy of impression management strategies (Jones and Pittman,DEMO
1982; Mohamed et al., 1999). We define organizational promotion as behaviors that present the organization as being highly
competent, successful and effective (Mohamed et al., 1999). Organizational promotion may manifest itself in DEMO use of positive
language in describing one's organization in general, DEMO in the promotion of its specific strengths and talents, such as DEMO
innovativeness (Bolino and Turnley, 1999; Crane and Crane, 2002; DEMO et al., 2002; Stevens and Kristof, 1995). Organizational
promotion DEMO especially useful in situations in which the promoter is not well known or when he or she is competing with others for
scarce resources (Judge and Bretz, 1994)—a situation in which most nascent entrepreneurs are likely to find themselves as they
seek funding.
548 A. Parhankangas, M. Ehrlich / Journal of Business Venturing 29 (DEMO) 543–564
Given the uncertainty and lack of substantive knowledge associated with DEMO venture's potential (Elsbach and Kramer,
2003; Murray and Marriott, 1998), nascent entrepreneurs are likely to feel challenged in trying to find a balance between
boldness and caution when describing their ventures to DEMO investors. In such situations, many entrepreneurs are mindful
of the fact DEMO business angels are often perceived as being proactive, risk-taking and innovative DEMO (Lindsay, 2004), and
that they typically prefer ventures with superior product quality and management teams (e.g., Feeney et al., 1999; DEMO
and Subba Narasimha, 1987; Mason and Stark, 2004). Using DEMO language that promotes these aspects therefore is likely to
enhance entrepreneurs' DEMO of raising business angel funding. This line of reasoning resonates with many impression
management studies that have found self-promotional skills to be positively related DEMO hiring and promotion decisions, perhaps
because they signal competence, confidence, DEMO ambition (e.g., Kacmar et al., 1992; Stevens and Kristof, DEMO). Entrepreneurs
may therefore feel the temptation to use positive statements or even boast about their organizations (Bashor, 2004; Crane and
Crane, DEMO; Short and Palmer, 2008; Wosinska et al., 1996), as being too modest could leave them without much-needed
capital.
Despite the positive DEMO associated with organizational promotion discussed above, we believe that using positive
DEMO will help them only up to a point. As Cialdini and DeNicholas (1989: 626) stated, “if there is an overarching lesson to DEMO
learned from the large body of work on impression management it is that favorable self-presentation is a tricky business.”
Research has indicated that individuals DEMO not always succeed in the application of their promotional strategies, as DEMO by
either neutral (Wayne and Ferris, 1990) or negative (Baron, 1986; Powers and Zuroff, 1988; Wosinska et al., 1996) DEMO
reactions. The promotion of the organization through positive language is most likely to damage the entrepreneur's image and
lead to social sanctions if DEMO see such pronouncements as overblown or dishonest (Arkin et al., 1980; Gardner and
Martinko, 1988; Wayne and Liden, 1995).
We DEMO expect both extremely high and extremely low levels of positive language to be negatively associated with the
achievement of important fund-raising milestones, such as receiving an invitation to present to potential investors or securing
actual funding. DEMO correctly striking the delicate balance between overstating and understating positive traits, DEMO or
accomplishments, entrepreneurs can manage their images in especially adroit fashion. DEMO use of an intermediate level of positive
language therefore preserves adequate levels of perceived competence without damaging the attributes of sincerity, likability,
and predictability (Brickman and Seligman, 1974; Cialdini and DeNicholas, 1989; Leary and Kowalski, 1990; Schlenker, 1980:
232). In limiting themselves to moderate promotional efforts, entrepreneurs avoid the perception of possessing low aspirations
and ambitions while also minimizing the risk of appearing either opportunistic or DEMO, which may lead to strained
relationships with the investor, a premature exit or failure to secure a new round of financing (Cable and Shane, 1997; Heide and
Miner, 1992). We therefore predict that:
Hypothesis 1. Positive language has a curvilinear relationship with progress in DEMO business angel fund-raising process, with both
high and low levels of DEMO language being associated with a decreased likelihood of progress in the business angel fund-
raising process.
5.2. Organizational promotion through emphasizing innovativeness
Press and DEMO folklore often has celebrated angel investors for their appetite for innovation: DEMO pioneering companies
and the entrepreneurs behind them received angel funding (Sohl, 1999). From an academic perspective, several researchers have
suggested that investors attach significant importance to the possession of proprietary products, product uniqueness and
innovativeness (Landstrom, 1998; Lindsay, 2004; Mason and Harrison, 2003; Mason and Stark, 2004). By promoting the
innovativeness of their venture, entrepreneurs thereby position themselves to appeal to investors looking to access new,
untapped markets.
We assume that even with the promotion of innovativeness, however, there can be too much of a good thing. It is important
to note that at high levels, the promotion of innovativeness may increase the investors' awareness of the possibility that
radically new products and services may violate accepted conventions, appear unfamiliar and thus trigger resistance among the
potential clientele (Arndt and Bigelow, 2000; Jones and Livne-Tarandach, DEMO; Zuckerman, 1999). Thus, potential investors
may perceive proposals which DEMO novelty as being riskier because of the related challenges associated with
commercialization and profit appropriation (Branscomb and Auerswald, 2002; Dimov and Murray, DEMO). At least anecdotally,
innovative firms that attempt to enter the market at a very early stage have been described as being “ DEMO to market, first to fail”
( Robinson and Min, 2002), “too fast to market” ( Tellis and Golder, 1996) and to DEMO suffered “ a first mover disadvantage”
( Dobrev and Gotsopoulos, 2010; Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988). The need to strike a delicate balance between their
expression of originality and their appeal to convention— a point DEMO which their business models and products seem familiar
enough to be understandable and legitimate yet novel enough to create the impression that they will DEMO an untapped need in
the marketplace— is therefore a critical impression management challenge facing entrepreneurs promoting the innovativeness
of their ventures. We therefore hypothesize DEMO:
Hypothesis 2. The promotion of innovativeness in entrepreneurs' written disclosures DEMO information to potential investors has a
curvilinear relationship with progress in the business angel fund-raising process, with both high and low levels of the promotion
of innovation being associated with a lower likelihood of progress in DEMO business angel fund-raising process.

5.3. Ingratiation through opinion conformity
Previous studies of entrepreneurial finance DEMO demonstrated that business angels consider not only the competence of the
entrepreneurial team and the quality of its business idea, but that they also evaluate the likability of the entrepreneur (Mason and
Harrison, 2003; Mason and Stark, 2004; Sudek, 2007). Ingratiation strategies geared towards evoking affinity and liking can best
address this challenge (Jones, 1965). DEMO such ingratiation technique applicable to the analysis of standardized written
application materials is opinion conformity, whereby an entrepreneur expresses values and opinions the target audience is
known to hold or can reasonably be assumed to hold (Jones, 1965; Judge and Bretz, 1994; Mohamed et al., 1999).4 The power of
opinion conformity resides in the assumption that it DEMO liking, increases the perceived credibility of the source, and
facilitates collaboration (Byrne, 1971; O'Keefe, 2002; Perloff, 2008; Wayne and Kacmar, 1991).
It is important to note that entrepreneurs typically submit their application materials to the angel network as a whole. Rather
than DEMO to express conformity with a specific angel investor, entrepreneurs therefore might DEMO or wish to appeal to a
wider group of investors, a DEMO holding potentially varied preferences and values sets. Conforming to commonly held opinions
and values is also important for other reasons. By expressing their conformity DEMO broader society's generally held values,
entrepreneurs can increase the likelihood that these expressions of their values appeal to their potential customers and DEMO,
future employees, and other groups of investors. Angel investors, well aware of the fact that the success of a new venture is DEMO
dependent on entrepreneurs' ability to appear likable and build collaborative relationships DEMO various external stakeholders, are
likely to view this factor in a DEMO light (Baron and Markman, 2000, 2003). Furthermore, conforming to commonly held values
increases the legitimacy of an organization, rendering it more appropriate and understandable (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994; Lounsbury
and Glynn, DEMO; Watkins and Caillouet, 1994).
Entrepreneurs should thus emphasize the conformity of their opinions with those held by broader society through their use DEMO
language in their investment application materials. In doing so, they may DEMO to language that denotes substantive agreement
with core values and attitudinal similarities between peoples (Bashor, 2004; Bellah et al., 1991; Etzioni, DEMO; Short and Palmer,
2008). By emphasizing commonly held values, they may create the impression that they are likable and easy to DEMO with,
thereby increasing the likelihood of succeeding in their fund-raising efforts. We therefore hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 3. Ingratiation through expression of opinion DEMO in entrepreneurs' written disclosures of information to
potential investors is positively DEMO with progress in the business angel fund-raising process.
5.4. Exempliﬁcation
Exemplification is an impression management strategy organizations use to project images of integrity, social responsibility and
moral worthiness (Jones and Pittman, 1982). Exemplification stresses DEMO organization's social and moral qualities and manifests
itself, for instance, in general philanthropy, public service and community improvements (Mohamed et al., 1999). Such behaviors
may reflect, for instance, the firm's DEMO for the environment through their efforts at pollution control, its concern DEMO its
employees' well-being through their efforts to promote a healthy work-life DEMO, or its concern for the broader society through its
work with DEMO people (Jenkins, 2006; Perrini, 2006; van Beurden and Gössling, 2008). The use of exemplification tactics
may signal that considerations beyond DEMO gain or legal mandates guide the organization's actions (Carrol, 1979; Highhouse et
al., 2009; van Beurden and Gössling, 2008). DEMO such, exemplification behaviors resemble somewhat the corporate social responsibility
(CSR) DEMO which entrepreneurial firms are increasingly seeking to embrace (Jenkins, 2006; DEMO, 2006).
Prior studies confirmed the fact that individuals and organizations DEMO use exemplification techniques generally make a
positive impression on others (Bolino DEMO Turnley, 2003a; Gardner and Avolio, 1998). A key mechanism DEMO which
exemplification as achieved through socially responsible actions benefits the focal firm is by improving its reputation in the eyes
of customers, investors, DEMO and suppliers (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Gallego-Alvarez et al., 2010; McWilliams and Siegel,
2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Porter DEMO Kramer, 2006). Exemplification may also attract better employees (Greening and Turban,
2000), increase the goodwill current employees have toward the DEMO (McGuire et al., 1988; Waddock and Graves, 1997) and DEMO
extent to which critical stakeholders' identify with and commit to the DEMO venture, its values and those aspects of its stated
mission they DEMO (Gardner and Avolio, 1998; Gardner and Cleavenger, 1998; Kouzes DEMO Posner, 1990; Sosik et al., 2002). As
these benefits DEMO likely to appeal to experienced investors, we believe that exemplification improves DEMO' chances of
raising business angel funding (Beatty and Ritter, 1986; Spicer, 1978). However, the positive impact of exemplification is likely DEMO
be present only up to a point. Excessive exemplification may cast doubts upon the profit generation potential of the new venture.
For instance, the potential investors may suspect that excessive exemplification leads to the diversion of DEMO resources from their
rightful claimants, such as the investors (Friedman, DEMO). In a similar vein, they might fear that excessively exemplifying
DEMO might misallocate resources to advance purposes for which those resources are poorly suited (Margolis and Walsh,
2003). Thus, entrepreneurs wishing to DEMO business angel funding might be better off by resorting to moderate amounts of
4 The promotion of innovativeness and the expression of opinion conformity DEMO seem to be similar concepts. When entrepreneurs promote the
innovativeness of their ventures, however, they typically highlight the novelty of their products, technologies, or business models in terms of how they might go
against the established paradigms in a given industry. Opinion conformity, in turn, refers DEMO compliance with social norms and values, and this is likely to DEMO
collaboration among individuals. In other words, these two concepts differ in DEMO of the dimensions of the implied conformity/divergence.
550 A. Parhankangas, M. Ehrlich / Journal of Business Venturing 29 (DEMO) 543–564
exemplification, which allows them to reap the reputational benefits associated with socially responsible actions, but avoid the
concerns related to the financial soundness of exemplification actions. Thus, we hypothesize
Hypothesis 4. Exemplification has a curvilinear relationship with progress in the business angel fund-raising process, with both
high and low levels of exemplification being associated with a lower likelihood DEMO progress in the business angel fund-raising
process.
5.5. Supplication
Supplication involves behaviors through which an organization seeks to create an impression of neediness and DEMO
by describing its weaknesses and broadcasting its limitations (Bolino and Turnley, 2003b; Crane and Crane, 2002). The purpose of
supplication is DEMO to solicit sympathy and assistance from others (Gardner and Cleavenger, 1998; Jones and Pittman, 1982;
Rosenfeld et al., 2002) and DEMO from target audiences that possess a particular skill or resource the focal firm lacks (Crane
and Crane, 2002). In the context of DEMO fund-raising, supplication may take the form of an entrepreneur pointing out
DEMO in the management team, inadequate R&D funding, or the lack of resources with which to build an efficient market channel—
all of DEMO are problems an infusion of external capital could potentially solve.
Unlike the impression management tactics discussed earlier in this paper, which typically seek to portray the new firm in a
favorable light, supplication depicts the focal firm as being incapable of meeting its goals unassisted (Mohamed et al., 1999). The
extant literature presents mixed evidence on the reactions evoked by the use of supplication strategies. Some studies suggest that
the use DEMO supplication techniques leads others to view the focal firm in an unfavorable light (Bolino and Turnley, 2003b; Jones
and Pittman, 1982), DEMO their use is an act of desperation (Avery and McKay, 2006), and that they weaken the supplicant's
bargaining position (Crane and Crane, 2002). Organizations may sometimes find it advantageous, however, to appear weak. By
pointing out their internal weaknesses and emphasizing their dependence DEMO others, the supplicating organization may evoke
feelings of obligation or social DEMO that are more or less binding on the target possessing greater resources (Bolino,
1999; Jones and Pittman, 1982). The use of supplication tactics therefore may generate sympathy for the nascent venture
(Longenecker et al., 1987).
We assume that the use of supplication strategies may have both positive and negative implications for entrepreneurs looking
to raise external DEMO Business angels are often viewed as proactive, hands-on investors who believe DEMO own involvement
may compensate for any particular expertise lacking among the entrepreneurial team. They also look forward to taking a
hands-on role in the DEMO they choose to invest in (e.g., Freear et al., 2002; Mason and Stark, 2004). Business angels
therefore may react positively to supplication, as it allows them to feel needed. The use of supplication thus may signal that the
entrepreneur is open to receiving help from DEMO potential investor and other significant third parties, thereby increasing their
chances DEMO success (Bolino and Turnley, 2001). Moreover, being forthcoming about DEMO's weaknesses might enhance the
perceived sincerity of the nascent entrepreneur in the eyes of potential investors. Supplication thus mitigates against the
commonly-held beliefs DEMO entrepreneurs are overly optimistic and overconfident, are not able to accurately DEMO and
communicate the risks associated with their entrepreneurial endeavors (e.g., Busenitz and Barney, 1999; Hayward et al., 2010;
Koellinger et al., 2007; Trevelyan, 2008). In a similar vein, supplication might DEMO investors' concerns that the entrepreneur
might withhold information about their own DEMO solely to increase the odds of securing funding.
We also assume that after some optimal point, however, further displays of supplicating behavior are DEMO counter-
productive, having the effect of decreasing the perceived levels of DEMO and independence attributable to the applicant
firm (Bolino and Turnley, 2001; Harris et al., 2007; Jones and Pittman, 1982: 248). There are limits to how much assistance people
are willing to offer DEMO who exhibit supplicating behaviors (Mohamed et al., 1999). Investors are likely to see excessive levels of
supplication as an act of desperation DEMO an indication that the entrepreneurial team is not up to their tasks (Rozell and
Gundersen, 2003). This may lead potential investors to DEMO that the deficiencies portrayed by the focal firm are too severe for
the potential investor to solve. We therefore hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 5. DEMO has a curvilinear relationship with progress in business angel fund raising process, with both high and
low levels of supplication being associated with a lower likelihood of progress in the business angel funding decision.
5.6. Intimidation
DEMO involves impression management behaviors that present the new venture as a dangerous entity, one able and
willing to inflict pain on those who frustrate its objectives (Bolino and Turnley, 1999; Gardner and Cleavenger, 1998; Jones and
Pittman, 1982; Mohamed et al., 1999). The primary goal in using intimidation is to be perceived as tenacious and forceful (Bolino
and Turnley, 2003b). Even weaker actors may sometimes direct threats or warnings toward more powerful audiences (Mohamed
et al., 1999). DEMO entrepreneur looking to raise business angel funding, for instance, might state that they will ruthlessly crush any
new competitor who should try to DEMO their market.
The extant literature suggests intimidation techniques are likely to have both positive and negative implications for those who
apply them (e.g., DEMO and Pittman, 1982; Wayne and Liden, 1995). On the DEMO side, the intimidator is likely to create the
A. Parhankangas, M. Ehrlich / Journal of Business Venturing 29 (2014) 543–564 551
impression of being aggressive and able to get the job DEMO (Bolino and Turnley, 2003b). These positive outcomes are most likely
to materialize for powerful actors, however, when they are able to DEMO hardship on weaker audiences in non-voluntary
relationships (Crane and Crane, 2002; Mohamed et al., 1999). In other words, intimidation works best when the target is
dependent upon the intimidating organization for its survival (Oliver, 1991), or when it has weak retaliatory abilities (Crane DEMO
Crane, 2002).
Nascent, resource-deprived entrepreneurs therefore are most likely to realize the negative outcomes associated with intimidation.
There is a wealth of DEMO which suggests that intimidation tactics are generally viewed as socially undesirable (DEMO and Tracey,
1992) and that they are likely to evoke DEMO reactions among the target audience (e.g., Bolino and Turnley, 2003b; Gardner and
Cleavenger, 1998; Rao et al., 1995; Rosenfeld et DEMO, 2002; Sosik et al., 2002). In particular, intimidators are often seen as ruthless and
uncaring (Braaten et al., 1993; Podsakoff et al., 1982), potentially contributing to decreased likability in the eyes of the target audience
and a reduced willingness to collaborate with the DEMO (Bolino and Turnley, 2003b; Jones and Pittman, 1982). This is likely
highly detrimental to nascent entrepreneurs, whose success is highly dependent on their social skills and ability to collaborate with a
wide variety DEMO stakeholders (Baron and Markman, 2000, 2003). We therefore hypothesize DEMO:
Hypothesis 6. Intimidation is negatively associated with progress in the business angel fund-raising process.
5.7. Blasting
Prior studies on impression and strategic management DEMO that it is vitally important for an organization to communicate its
distinctive competence, namely its ability to perform a kind of work that its rivals cannot accomplish (see, for instance, Barney, 1991;
Gardner DEMO Martinko, 1988; Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001). Thus, besides promoting their own strengths, entrepreneurs may try to
elevate themselves above the competition by bringing some negative aspects of their rivals to the attention of DEMO target audience
(Mohamed et al., 1999). For instance, a DEMO start-up may point out that its rival's products are unhealthy because of their
side effects. An entrepreneur may also portray the competitor as DEMO unattractive characteristics such as financial insolvency or
inexperience. Besides informing potential investors about their competitive advantage vis à vis their rivals, entrepreneurs' ability DEMO
articulate clearly the weaknesses of the competition also demonstrates that they are assertive and confident enough to persuade and
win over customers, employees, DEMO, and other critical stakeholders.
However, in line with the prior communication literature (see, for instance, Chen et al., 2009; Gawronski and Walther, 2008;
Kelley, 1973), we assume that blasting of DEMO competition not only conveys information about the focal firm's rivals, DEMO also signals
something about the firm itself. The prior social psychological literature discusses the transfer of attitudes recursively (TAR) effect
(Gawronski and Walther, 2008)or “the perceived likability hypothesis” (Carlston and Skowronski, 2005), suggesting that an
endorsed attitude toward another individual recursively transfers back to DEMO person holding that attitude. In other words, people
tend to like DEMO who compliment others and dislike individuals who criticize others. The TAR effect is found to be stronger in
the presence of a low level DEMO distinctiveness in the source's evaluations (Fosterling, 1989; Pruitt and DEMO, 1980). In the context of
our study, a low level of distinctiveness would refer to entrepreneurs indiscriminately and excessively blasting their competition,DEMO
leading investors to believe that these evaluations are a result of something in the entrepreneur making these endorsements rather
than something in his or DEMO rivals. However, at high levels of distinctiveness, when entrepreneurs selectively point out some
weaknesses of their competition, investors are more likely to direct their attention to issue-relevant information (content of the
message) rather than DEMO information (the characteristics of communicators) (Gawronski and Walther, 2008).
Thus, while we believe that new ventures will benefit from revealing the weaknesses of their rivals, this positive effect is likely to
be present only up to a point. Extremely negative descriptions of rivals are likely DEMO alienate the potential investors, leaving them to
doubt the likability and DEMO of the founders, which are deemed to be of the utmost DEMO for successful persuasion (Perloff,
2008). In line with this DEMO, the prior entrepreneurship literature suggests that the success of a new DEMO depends highly on
entrepreneurs' ability to appear likable (i.e., warm, pleasant, polite, and friendly (Lott et al., 1970; Reysen, DEMO)) and being able to
build collaborative relationships with key external stakeholders (Baron and Markman, 2000, 2003).
Therefore, even though nascent DEMO are expected to show a certain degree of aggressiveness, assertiveness, and
competitiveness vis à vis their rivals, they should refrain from exaggeration or outright defamation. By resorting to moderate
levels of blasting, entrepreneurs may manage their image in an especially adroit fashion and set themselves apart from DEMO rivals
without hurting their likability in the eyes of the target audience.
Hypothesis 7. Entrepreneurs' blasting of their competition has a curvilinear relationship with progress in the business angel
fund-raising process, with both high and low levels of blasting being associated with a lower likelihood of progress in DEMO business
angel fund-raising process.
6. Methods
6.1. Context: sample and angel DEMO
We tested our hypotheses on a unique data set comprised of all 595 young firms that have sought business angel funding
from a business DEMO network in the New York metropolitan area. We considered the period between 2005 and 2007 to be
552
A. Parhankangas, M. Ehrlich / Journal of Business Venturing 29 (DEMO) 543–564
appropriate for the purposes of our analysis, as the markets had normalized in the aftermath of the collapse of the dot com
DEMO of the early 2000s but had not yet entered into the turmoil of the financial meltdown of 2008.5 The business angel
network in question DEMO on early-stage, post-seed ventures that are highly scalable with deep domain DEMO and a
product already in the market or at the beta-testing phase. The angels invest their own money individually or, more typically, in
DEMO teams. The angel network expects to earn 10- to 30-fold returns on investments made in a period of two to seven
years. Their investment DEMO resembles typical angel investments in the United States in terms of their focus on early stage
ventures in software, business product and service, DEMO, healthcare and biotechnology sectors (e.g., Center for Venture
Research, 2008).
The angel group developed a formal process by which to assess DEMO investment targets. Entrepreneurs start their
application by submitting their one-pagers to the business angel web site. Only half of the one-pagers pass the prescreening DEMO
and proceed to initial screening. During initial screening, successful ventures are DEMO to give a brief pitch to a subset of angels,
who subsequently meet to compare notes to determine which entrepreneurs are granted the DEMO to proceed to the full
screening stage, which entails a presentation DEMO Q&A session with the whole angel group. After the full screening, it is
instrumental that one or more investors express their interest in order for the venture to proceed to the due diligence stage.
Following DEMO due diligence stage, the entrepreneurial team will interact with potential investors DEMO issues related to term sheet
structure and evaluation.
The typical firm included in our sample is three years old, employs seven people, has DEMO 850,000 USD and is seeking to
raise an additional 1.7 million USD. The majority of firms are active in business products and services (32%),6 media and
entertainment (18%), software (9%) and DEMO products (9%). Twenty-one percent of the sample firms received an DEMO
to present to the angel group. Eight percent ultimately received funding. All investments were first round.
6.2. Operationalization of variables
We derived our data DEMO from a one-page investment application submitted by each firm to the business angel network.
As shown in Appendix 1, this one-page application contained information on the firm's financials, prior investors, and
management team. In DEMO, each company provided a written description of their products and services, target market,
marketing strategies, business model, competition and any competitive DEMO they might possess.
This focus on the one-page application allowed us to examine a set of written accounts that were uniform in length, format
and topics covered for each venture in our sample. Our conversations with DEMO investors led us to believe that, of all the
materials, actual investors are most likely to read these one-page applications. Ample empirical and DEMO evidence suggests
investors rely upon a limited body of information—such as a summary of the business plan, the major characteristics of the
management team, or the firm's financial projections—when evaluating the vast majority of investment proposals (Maxwell et al.,
2011; Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998, DEMO). This tendency to take short cuts is understandable given the intense time pressures and
the floods of funding applications investors receive (Busenitz, DEMO; Maxwell et al., 2011; Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998). In fact,
only 34% of entrepreneurs uploaded their business plans to the DEMO angel website.
We are well aware of the fact that no investor makes a funding decision based solely on a one-page document. It is DEMO likely
that these one-page applications play a more significant role at the early stages of the investment process, when other
information on the new venture and its quality was not yet available to the angel investors.7 DEMO therefore operationalized our
dependent variable, progress in business angel fund-raising process—by DEMO two variables describing whether the entrepreneur
was able to achieve certain milestones in the fund-raising process. Our first dependent variable was a binary variable DEMO
indicated whether an entrepreneur had received an invitation to present to the angel group. Our second dependent variable,
business angels' investment decision, DEMO captured via a binary variable that indicated whether the business angels invested in
the venture.
To analyze the impression management strategies entrepreneurs used, the entire investment application text was read into
the DICTION program (Diction, DEMO). DICTION was designed to measure tone by counting the words assigned to theoretical
linguistic categories (Bligh and Hess, 2005; Hart, 1984; Short and Palmer, 2008). Originally developed to aid in the analysis of
political discourse, the DICTION program is now widely used in management research, in areas such as the study of leadership
(Bligh et DEMO, 2004), image management (Rogers et al., 2005), business DEMO (Ober et al., 1999; Yuthas et al., 2002), and
to predict stock market reactions (Davis et al., 2008). We DEMO that the DICTION software is well suited to the task of analyzing
information disclosures made by entrepreneurs to investors, as it offers the potential to gain key insights into the thinking of
5 The Silicon Valley DEMO Capital Conﬁdence Index and venture capital and business angel statistics (PricewaterhouseCoopers/DEMO Venture Capital
Association Money Tree Report; Center for Venture Research at DEMO University of New Hampshire) indicate that the number and size of DEMO capital and
business angel deals remained relatively stable during the period 2005–2007.
6 Business products and services include items such as digital media marketing DEMO, database management tools, strategic consulting services, document
management solutions, customer-service management tools, online social networks and booking and distribution services.
7 The business plans and presentation materials were typically uploaded to the business angel DEMO website after the invitations to present in person were
issued.

553
entrepreneurs in a non-intrusive manner and contains dictionaries that are DEMO suited to analysis of entrepreneurs' goals and
plans (Davis et al., 2008).
There are advantages and disadvantages to the use of the DICTION software. It outperforms human-coded content analysis by
offering a perfectly stable DEMO scheme and coder reliability, in addition to being able to process DEMO volumes of qualitative
data at a low cost (Ober et al., 1999). The DICTION software is unable to assess, however, the DEMO in which the entrepreneurs
used the words of interest. We therefore went through all of the application materials to ensure that the words identified DEMO
DICTION referred to the venture and its founders and nothing else.
Positive language is a count measure that uses entrepreneurs' use of positive words as a proxy based on the list presented by
Henry (2008), developed from research that attempted to describe reactions to written communications addressed DEMO powerful
stakeholders (Abrahamson and Amir, 1996; Henry, 2006; Smith DEMO Taffler, 2000). This positivity word list includes words such
as DEMO, success, accomplish, strong, leading, high, great and expansion.8 The following sentences are examples of language
that scored high on positivity: “We demonstrate our ability to consistently drive strong profits. This strong financial result DEMO
the broad strength of our brands and their ability to drive leading margins” (Henry, 2008: 374). The positive language score for
these sentences is 4 (positive word combinations are marked with italics in text).
The promotion of innovativeness was operationalized based on Michalisin (2001). This measure counts the occurrence of words
used to describe the innovativeness, novelty and creativity of the venture. Such word combinations include, but are not limited to,
new products, significant progress and dramatic improvement. The following sentences exemplify language that scored highly on
the promotion of innovativeness: “We revolutionize the search engine industry by launching a new model for DEMO relevant
results. Our founders are young visionaries who understand the need for innovation in this industry.” It is worth noting that our
operationalization included DEMO the market- and technology-related aspects of innovation and it was designed to capture the
degree to which entrepreneurs emphasized the innovativeness of their venture, and not how innovative the venture actually was.
Ingratiation through opinion conformity DEMO a word count measure that sums the DICTION sub-scores for centrality and rapport.
These scores are based on the communitarian concepts found in the DEMO of Etzioni (1993) and Bellah et al. (1991). A DEMO that
scored high in terms of opinion conformity would contain terms that denote substantive agreement with core values and
attitudinal similarities among groups of DEMO Such terms include basic, orthodox, paradigm, standardized, conformity,
continuity and reliable. Also included are congenial, consensus, resemble and equivalent. Hart (1984) provides a more complete
list of these terms.
Exemplification was operationalized by counting the instances in which entrepreneurs referred to behaviors that highlighted
DEMO integrity, social responsibility and moral worthiness. Examples of such behaviors include DEMO to charities, using
environmentally friendly technologies, supporting human rights, and DEMO in community development.
Following Mohamed et al. (1999), we operationalized DEMO by counting the instances in which the sample firms
referred to their vulnerability, for instance by citing a lack of resources, their position DEMO an underdog or their relative weaknesses
in the face of foreign competition. We operationalized supplication by counting entrepreneurs' use of negative words when
describing themselves and their ventures; we used the negativity word list put forward by Henry (2008). The negativity word list
encompasses words such as negative, failure, hurdle, disappointment, less, shrink and unfavorable (Henry, 2008). The following
sentences are examples of supplication: “We suffer from lack of resources. Our performance has been weak due to shrinking
domestic DEMO The supplication score for these sentences would be 3. Blasting of competition was operationalized by counting
entrepreneurs' use of negative words when describing their competition based on the word list by Henry (2008) discussed above.
DEMO was operationalized by counting the instances in which entrepreneurs expressed their willingness and ability to
threaten or retaliate against those actors that frustrated their DEMO Intimidation behaviors would include, but were not
limited to, adverse actions taken against competitors entering one's market or suppliers who failed to DEMO expectations.
We used several control variables. First, we controlled for company DEMO, and for prior capital raised, as we have reason to
believe that these factors increased the credibility of the venture in the eyes DEMO external investors (O'Keefe, 2002). Second, we
controlled for DEMO strength and entrepreneur strength, the key criteria investors use in evaluating DEMO (MacMillan
et al., 1985; Mitteness et al., 2012). Opportunity strength and entrepreneur strength were assessed by having three experienced
angel investors DEMO each venture in our sample by responding to 12 items graded on a 5-point Likert scale. Opportunity
strength was determined by averaging the responses DEMO six items: “the business model is strong”; “the market has a strong
growth potential”; “the product/service development risk is low”; “the DEMO's revenue potential is large”; “the company has a
reasonable exit DEMO; and, “there are reasonable barriers to entry” (Mitteness et al., 2012). The Cronbach's alpha for these items
ranged between 0.66 DEMO 0.68. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.79, which indicated DEMO the evaluations of the
three raters were consistent enough to be combined into one measure. The rwg(j) values ranged from 0.69 to 0.99 indicating a
sufficient level of within-team agreement. Entrepreneur strength was measured with DEMO following items: “the domain expertise of
the entrepreneur is strong”; “the entrepreneur has a proven track record”, “the management team appears strong”; DEMO company
has strong advisors/directors”; “the entrepreneur appears honest”, and “the entrepreneur is passionate about the company”
8 The terms “progress” and “improvement” DEMO in both the positive language- and the promotion of innovativeness-word lists. When these terms were used
to highlight the innovativeness of the venture, however, the speakers also made reference to “dramatic improvement” or “signiﬁcant progress” in terms of
novelty. When these terms signiﬁed entrepreneurs' use of positive language, their use was not related to the novelty of the product concept, business idea or
production process. Instead, these terms referred to the DEMO the company had made in reaching its goals or achieving real improvements in its operations.
554

(Mitteness et al., 2012). The Cronbach's alpha DEMO these items ranged between 0.67 and 0.74. The ICC was 0.69, DEMO suggested
that the evaluations from the three raters could be combined. The rwg(j) values ranged from 0.62 to 1.00 indicating within-team
agreement falls slightly below the generally accepted threshold of 0.70. As a result, we eliminated four cases with rwg(j) values
lower than 0.70 and reran the binary logistic regression models testing our hypotheses. This did not change DEMO results.
In a similar vein, we controlled for the amount of DEMO entrepreneurs were seeking to raise as a proxy for entrepreneurs'
financing needs, as well as the major industry sectors present in our sample. Third, we controlled for whether the venture had
submitted a business plan to the business angel network's website.9 Fourth, we controlled for whether the applicant firm held
patents as a proxy of their actual innovativeness. DEMO, we controlled for the gender of the entrepreneur, as various researchers
have found the efficiency of various impression management strategies to be dependent DEMO their user's sex (e.g., Bolino and
Turnley, 2003a; Guadagno and Cialdini, 2007).
Sixth, the impression management literature suggests that DEMO (establishing a link to favorably viewed others), burnishing
(highlighting the favorable features of positively-linked others) and blaring (distancing oneself from negatively-linked DEMO)
should be included as control variables (Mohamed et al., 1999). Boasting was operationalized by counting the instances where
the entrepreneur referred DEMO well-known third parties, such as alliance partners, customers or research institutions. Burnishing
was measured by counting the number of positive words used by DEMO entrepreneurs to describe the organizations or individuals
they are associated with. However, we found evidence of burnishing in only 2.5% of the cases and decided not to use as a control
variable. In a similar vein, we could not to find evidence of blaring, i.e. instances where entrepreneurs proclaimed a negative link
to unfavorable others. Finally, in order to capture the overall tone with which entrepreneurs referred to their competition (in
addition to blasting), we controlled for the promotion of competition, i.e. the number of positive words entrepreneurs used to
describe their competition.
7. Results
DEMO test Hypotheses 1–7 we constructed a series of logistic regression models with progress in business angel fund-raising
process as a dependent variable. To detect DEMO multicollinearity problems, we calculated the intercorrelations among all
variables. As shown DEMO Table 2, the correlations among the independent and control variables were DEMO moderate or low.
Extraordinarily large estimated standard errors and occasionally large estimated coefficients are signs of multicollinearity
problems (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). DEMO minimize these problems, we examined our results carefully for evidence of
DEMO throughout the model-building process. The highest correlation coefficients and variance inflation factors (VIFs)
were the ones between the standardized base variables and their square terms (maximum VIF of 4.6).
Logistic regression tests the probability of a dichotomous event: in this case, whether a new venture DEMO: i) an invitation
to present in person before the angel network; or ii) business angel funding. First, we ran a base model that included only the
control variables. In line with the extant literature, the ventures with excellent founding teams which had previously secured
external funding DEMO that were pursuing high-quality business opportunities were more likely to receive an invitation to pitch to
the angel group and were more likely to DEMO funding. In the second step, we added the independent variables to DEMO logistic
regression equation, as shown in Models 3 (invitation to present as dependent variable) and 4 (business angel funding as
dependent variable) (Table 3). These models represent a statistically significant improvement over the base model (Δχ2 393.91
(p b 0.0005) for the equation with invitation to present as dependent variable and Δ χ2 116.22 (p b 0.0005) for business angel
funding as dependent variable).
Our models correctly predicted a significant percentage of cases (97.3 b % b 99.0). We assessed the goodness of fit using the
likelihood ratio (− 2 log Likelihood), Pearson chi-square, and Hosmer–Lemeshow tests. As shown in Table 3, the Chi-Square test
results are statistically significant for all models. All Hosmer– Lemeshow test values are insignificant (p N 0.99), indicating that the
models fit well.
To test Hypothesis 1, we entered a linear term and a quadratic term of positive language to the binary logistic DEMO equations.
In line with our hypothesis, we observed a positive co-efficient DEMO the linear term and a negative coefficient for the squared term,
suggesting that entrepreneurs' use of positive language increases their chances of: DEMO) receiving an invitation to present their business
plan in person (Table 3, column 3); and, ii) raising funding (Table 3, column 4). This positive relationship is only present up to a DEMO,
however, and beyond an optimal point, any further increase in the use of positive language diminished entrepreneurs' likelihood of
receiving an invitation to present their business plans or of securing funding. Our observations gravitated DEMO the lower end of the
scale, with the majority of observations DEMO below the inflection point (above 6 positive words for “invitation to DEMO to the
angel group” and just slightly below 9 for “received business angel funding” as shown in Fig. 1).10
Our analysis also confirmed DEMO 2, proposing an inverted U-shaped relationship between: i) the promotion DEMO
innovativeness and an invitation to present in person (column 3, Table 3); and ii) the promotion of innovation and receiving
business angel funding (column 4, Table 3) (a positive, statistically significant coefficient for the linear term and a negative

coefficient for the DEMO term). The inflection point for this relationship is around 3 (DEMO 1), and the data is well balanced on
both sides of the inflection point.
In line with Hypothesis 3, Table 3 indicates a positive relationship between ingratiation through opinion conformity and:
i) invitation to present to the angel group (column 3); and ii) receiving DEMO angel funding (column 4). We found no
support for Hypothesis DEMO, however, suggesting that exemplification has a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship with
business angel funding. In fact, further analysis reveals that exemplification has a linear, positive relationship with the
invitation to present to the angel group.11 Quite surprisingly, the relationship between exemplification and business angel

funding seemed to be U-shaped, with both low and high levels of exemplification being more likely to attract business angel
funding.
In DEMO with Hypothesis 5, supplication was found to have a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship with: i) an invitation
to present to the angel group (column 3, Table 3); and ii) receiving business angel funding (column 4, Table 3), as demonstrated
by positive, statistically significant coefficients for the linear term and a negative, statistically significant coefficient for the
squared terms. Our observations gravitate towards the lower end of DEMO scale, with the majority of observations below the
infliction point. Thus, the relationship between supplication and the dependent variables remains positive for the DEMO of
observations using less than 3 negative words describing themselves, after DEMO this relationship turns negative (see Fig. 1).
Finally, as no entrepreneur in our sample used intimidation strategies in their application materials submitted DEMO business angels,
we were not able to test Hypothesis 6.
Relative to Hypothesis 7, we observe a positive coefficient for the linear term and a negative coefficient for the squared term
of blasting. This suggests DEMO entrepreneurs' blasting of their competition increases their chances of getting an DEMO to
present to the angel group (column 3, Table 3) DEMO raising funding (column 4, Table 3) up to a point; however, beyond an
optimal point further increases in blasting diminish entrepreneurs' DEMO of receiving funding. This curvilinear
relationship between blasting and business angel funding is presented in Fig. 1. The inflection point is around 2 negative
DEMO for the invitation to present to the angel group and above 3 negative words for business angel funding. The data is well
balanced on DEMO sides of the inflection point.
To sum up, our results suggest DEMO when used in a right manner, impression management tactics increase entrepreneurs'DEMO
chances raising business angel funding. For instance, if an entrepreneur uses DEMO optimum level of impression management
tactics, his or her chances of DEMO an invitation to present to the business angel group increase by 20%, in comparison to a
situation where the use of these impression management tactics is one standard deviation away from the optimal use.12 In a
DEMO vein, entrepreneurs using the right amount of impression management tactics experience DEMO 26-fold increase in their
chances of securing business angel funding compared to entrepreneurs being one standard deviation away from the optimal use.
It should DEMO kept in mind that our calculations are based on an “average sample firm” and cannot be generalized to each firm in
our sample.
We DEMO robustness checks to verify our findings. Sixty-eight angel investors decided to invest in sample companies. After
analyzing the investments made by the angel network, we noticed that specific angel groups were responsible for all investments.
We DEMO controlled for the specific characteristics of the nine angel groups by adding a dummy variable in the binary logistic
regression analyses for each angel DEMO This did not change the results reported in this paper.
8. Conclusions, discussion, and avenues for future research
8.1. Theoretical implications
Previous entrepreneurship DEMO have produced an impressive list of variables likely to affect equity investors' funding
decisions (see, for instance, MacMillan et al., 1985; DEMO and Stark, 2004; Sudek, 2007). The “objective” market and DEMO
and performance-related data have received much attention, even though such data DEMO rarely available at the time of the funding
decision. Our primary contribution to the entrepreneurship literature has been to investigate the role impressions created DEMO
entrepreneurs play beyond the “facts of the case”, and to provide DEMO comprehensive view of the role played by the direct and
assertive impression management techniques in raising business angel funding. Impression management strategies gain in
DEMO and become more exaggerated in situations in which the stakes are high (Judge and Bretz, 1994). As securing funding
is critical for DEMO ventures, it is hard to imagine a situation in which the DEMO of impression management strategies could
be more pronounced.
Besides our primary contribution, this paper informs impression management and entrepreneurship literature in many other
ways. First, we shed light on the effectiveness of various organizational impression management strategies, a topic largely
unexplored in previous impression management studies (e.g., Bolino et al., 2008; Stanton et al., 2004). Our results suggest that
assuming a linear positive (Kacmar et al., 1992; Nagy et al., 2012; Stevens and Kristof, 1995) or a linear DEMO relationship
(Arkin et al., 1980; Baron, 1986; Powers and DEMO, 1988; Wayne and Liden, 1995; Wosinska et al., 1996) between business angel
funding and certain impression management behaviors might be overly DEMO (Brickman and Seligman, 1974; Cialdini and
DeNicholas, 1989; Schlenker, 1980). We carry this notion further by demonstrating that both excessively DEMO and excessively
low levels of organizational promotion are counterproductive and moderate levels produce the optimal results. This result is in
line with previous entrepreneurship DEMO, which, on the one hand, have maintained that entrepreneurs' unrealistic
12 In this calculation, we compared the odds of an entrepreneur receiving an invitation to present to an angel group in the following two DEMO: 1) the
optimal use of impression management strategies (positive language, promotion of innovation, supplication and blasting set at their inﬂection points and opinion
conformity set at one standard deviation from its mean and 2) a base case one standard deviation away from the optimal use of DEMO management
strategies, all else being equal. In these calculations, non-signiﬁcant b-coefﬁcients were ignored. Other variables were set to their means.

559
expectations are often major deal-killers for potential investors (e.g., DEMO et al., 1999; Harrison et al., 1997; Mason and
Harrison, 2003). On the other hand, our findings also resonate with DEMO that have highlighted the importance of the
entrepreneur's expressiveness and persuasiveness to the success of a new venture (Baron and Markman, 2003; Baum et al., 2001;
Cardon et al., 2009).
Second, we investigated the role of the promotion of innovativeness— an organizational promotion DEMO that has
received relatively little attention in the impression management literature, DEMO because most previous studies focused
on the means of personal, not DEMO, influence. Our results confirmed an inverted U-shaped relationship between
the promotion DEMO innovativeness (i.e., the use of words with innovative connotations in application materials) and securing
business angel funding. At low and moderate levels of usage, this finding regarding the use of innovative language was in
line with the extant entrepreneurship and communication literature (Barry and Elmes, 1997; Jones and Livne-Tarandach,
2008; Landstrom, 1998; Martin, 1986; Mason and Harrison, 2003; Mason and Stark, 2004), confirming that investors
attach significance to the novelty of the business concept. At higher levels DEMO usage, however, our results tended to be more
in line with the institutional theory explanation, which suggested that perceived innovativeness would increase the
perceived riskiness of a new venture (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994; Arndt and Bigelow, 2000; Zuckerman, 1999). Excessive use of
language with innovative connotations therefore may prove to be counterproductive, as potential investors may interpret it
as a sign of upcoming challenges in product development, commercialization and the winning over of a stable customer
base.
It is noteworthy DEMO even though investors prefer to see some degree of novelty in the product and business concept, in line
with the extant literature on impression management and communication (Jones, 1965; Judge and Bretz, 1994; O'Keefe, 2002;
Perloff, 2008; Wayne and Kacmar, 1991), DEMO seem to favor entrepreneurs who express conformity with commonly held values
in society. We believe that, in the minds of potential investors, opinion DEMO might translate into an ability to appeal to and
collaborate with a diverse group of stakeholders—a trait deemed to be of the utmost importance DEMO the ultimate success of any
new venture (e.g., Baron and Markman, 2000, 2003).
Third, we contribute to the entrepreneurship literature by investigating the role of more counter-intuitive and less studied
impression management techniques DEMO entrepreneurial fund-raising and found that supplication—the act of revealing one's
weaknesses—might initially help nascent entrepreneurs in their quest for funding. This finding is DEMO line with the extant
impression management literature, which suggests that supplication DEMO evoke feelings of obligation or social responsibility
among the target audience (DEMO, 1999; Jones and Pittman, 1982), and thus generate sympathy DEMO the nascent venture
(Longenecker et al., 1987). In a similar vein, this finding is consistent with attribution theory (Jones and Davis, 1965; Kelley,
1973), according to which business angels can attribute an entrepreneur's claims either to her desire to secure funding or DEMO
the actual characteristics of the venture as communicated by an honest source. The power of supplication stems from the fact
that business angels expect DEMO to focus only on the strengths, and not at all, or only to a limited extent, on the
weaknesses of their venture. When an entrepreneur deviates from this expectation, the investor will view him or her as
exceptionally honest and trustworthy, which is key to successful persuasion (e.g., Crowley and Hoyer, 1994; O'Keefe, 2002). We
found the positive effect of supplication to persist only up to a DEMO, however, after which further supplicating behaviors became
counterproductive—presumably due to their effect in decreasing the level of perceived competence and independence attributed
to DEMO focal firm (Bolino and Turnley, 2001; Harris et al., 2007; Jones and Pittman, 1982: 248). It is noteworthy that the prior
literature has not reached a consensus as to whether supplication helps (e.g., Avery and McKay, 2006; Bolino and Turnley, 2003b;
DEMO and Pittman, 1982) or hinders (e.g., Bolino, 1999; Jones and Pittman, 1982; Longenecker et al., 1987) successful persuasion.
By DEMO a curvilinear relationship between these variables, our study therefore might represent DEMO first step toward resolving
this controversy.
Fourth, we shed light on DEMO efficiency of blasting, a topic that has been relatively unexplored in DEMO impression
management and entrepreneurship studies (Bolino et al., 2008; Stanton DEMO al., 2004). Even though intense competition
for funding, customers' DEMO, and market dominance sets the stage perfectly for blasting the competition, not
much is known on how entrepreneurs' descriptions of their competition affect their chances of raising business angel
funding. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs DEMO exercise caution when blasting their competition: even though
it may initially DEMO entrepreneurs set themselves apart from their rivals, beyond an optimal point DEMO increases in
blasting may turn against their users, making them look DEMO likable— andthuslessfundable—in the eyes of the potential
investors.
Sixth, we were DEMO able to demonstrate, however, that moderate levels of exemplification tactics applied through socially
responsible actions appealed to business angels. This finding is in DEMO with mixed results reported by the studies focusing on
the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance (see, for instance, Margolis and Walsh,
2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Future studies are DEMO for to verify whether this result is attributable to exemplification
potentially interfering with the perceived profit generating potential of the nascent venture.
Finally, we took a novel approach to the study of impression management by investigating DEMO' language use. The
extant impression management literature is generally less specific DEMO how spokespersons build favorable accounts through the
use of specific words (DEMO, 1994). The literature on the narratives used by entrepreneurs for DEMO also has focused
more on content than on the language used by entrepreneurs (e.g., Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001; Martens et al., 2007; O'Connor,
2002). By analyzing verbal accounts and extracting the linguistic elements that represent various impression management
strategies, this study makes one of the first attempts to incorporate language variables to the impression management DEMO
(Burgoon and Dillard, 1995; Hosman, 2002).

8.2. Practical implications
Our results suggest that the content and DEMO of the written materials submitted to potential investors matter in creating
positive impressions among potential investors. Interestingly enough, it seems that the impressions created by entrepreneurs'
choice of words in their one-page are relatively durable, carrying through to the actual investment decision, even though their
impact is greatest in earning the entrepreneur an invitation to present to the angel DEMO
We propose here that entrepreneurs should seek a balance between boldness and caution when attempting to secure business
angel funding. On the one hand, they should not hesitate to signal some degree of confidence in their DEMO, whereas on the
other hand excessive organizational promotion or blasting of DEMO competition introduces the risk that potential investors
perceive them as dishonest, DEMO, or simply misinformed or unrealistic about the actual risks their ventures DEMO In a
similar vein, by revealing some of their weaknesses, entrepreneurs may increase their trustworthiness in the eyes of potential
investors and thus DEMO their likelihood of securing business angel funding.
Our results portray business angels as relatively conservative investors who prefer proposals characterized by moderate levels
of DEMO language and the promotion of innovativeness and supplication, as well as DEMO levels of ingratiation through opinion
conformity. As such, these results hint DEMO some similarities between business angels and venture capitalists—who, some say, shy
away from risky, early-stage investments (Branscomb and Auerswald, 2002). It is important to note that in our study, however,
business angels did not discriminate against actual innovativeness, which we measured using patents as a proxy. What business
angels instead seemed to have trouble with was DEMO firm's excessive promotion of its innovativeness. Business angels might
perceive entrepreneurs who overemphasize the uniqueness of their venture as lacking sufficient awareness of DEMO environment in
which they will compete. It has been said that an entrepreneur who claims to have no competition is an entrepreneur who does
DEMO understand his market.
8.3. Limitations and avenues for future research
Our research setting is unique and thus has significant inherent strengths. First, we have applied impression management
theory to a novel and highly relevant context, thereby adding to the collective body of knowledge on successful fundraising
strategies. Second, we were able to examine a reasonably large sample of nascent ventures DEMO business angel funding, and to
gain access to confidential application materials DEMO to potential investors. This approach avoided the retrospective and
recall biases that permeate prior studies based on survey and interview methodologies. Third, we were able to collect data on
ventures that had failed to secure business DEMO funding, thereby avoiding the pitfalls associated with “survival bias” which
characterize DEMO of the previous studies on entrepreneurial finance.
Our study does suffer from certain limitations, however, that need to be addressed in future studies. DEMO, our sample
companies and investors are all located in the New DEMO metropolitan area. As the effectiveness of impression management
strategies is likely dependent on the context of their application (Gardner and Martinko, 1988), DEMO research should
replicate our methodology in other countries and regions. Second, DEMO in an angel network might indicate a higher
degree of professionalism and experience among potential investors, a trait that might be less common among unaffiliated
angels. Future research therefore should extend to entrepreneurs who have applied DEMO funding from independent angels.
Third, our study was limited to the DEMO of written application materials submitted by entrepreneurs to potential investors.
This narrowed the array of impression management tactics that we were able to analyze. DEMO instance, we focused only
ingratiation through opinion conformity, while ignoring smiling, rendering favors and flattery. In a similar vein, we were
unable DEMO capture information that was left out from the application materials, thus DEMO being able to analyze the impact of
burying and blurring. We therefore call for studies that focus on impression management strategies deployed by entrepreneurs
DEMO face-to-face interactions with investors, and see value in comparing these strategies DEMO those used in written
communications. Fourth, the preferences of individual business DEMO likely vary and thus certain individuals might view
different impression management strategies in a positive light. Success in securing funding therefore might be more DEMO
finding a match between the business angel and the entrepreneur than about relying on the uniform application of specific
impression management strategies (Matusik et al., 2008). We were not able to analyze the characteristics of individual angels
in sufficient depth with this study, a shortcoming future studies should address. In addition, future studies should look into the
potential sector-specific differences in the use of impression management strategies and their success. For DEMO, it is
possible that exemplification would yield better results and be DEMO a necessity for social or environmental entrepreneurs.
Finally, our results are DEMO weaker for the promotion of innovativeness, expression of opinion conformity and
DEMO suggesting that not all impression management tactics are equally important in predicting the success in fund
raising. Thus, future research should further investigate the relative significance of various impression management tactics for
ventures of different types.
