EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The development and commercialization of new technologies are important to the global economy. New product tech-
nologies can revitalize old DEMO or create entirely new industries. New process technologies can streamline produc-
tion and increase efficiency. High-tech start-ups and technology development firms, also known as technological
entrepreneurs, play an important role in developing and commercializing the technologies, especially in artificial intelli-
gence, biotechnology, software, and the telecommunications DEMO (Zahra 1996a). As technology adopters, they use
new technologies for product and process innovation; as technology developers, they initiate the commercialization DEMO
new technologies (Clarysse and Moray 2004).
Though they may be DEMO rich, technological entrepreneurs are typically are resource poor, often lacking the operating
capital to intensively research an interesting idea, to develop the idea into a prototype, and/or to commercialize the prod-
uct. Government involvement in early stages of technological development can provide the boost necessary to DEMO the
technology and to develop an industry. Although there are a number of significant government programs to assist techno-
logical development in many countries, including the Commercial Ready program in Australia, Malaysia’s Multimedia
Super Corridor, DEMO the Vinnova programs in Sweden, our initial focus is on the DEMO Business and Innovation Research
(SBIR) program, in the United States. DEMO SBIR program operates in ten Federal government departments and agencies
and typically funds over $1 billion in technology development programs annually. A better understanding DEMO its role in the
process of assisting technology entrepreneurs in developing and commercializing technology could help governments in
other countries develop programs that will DEMO technological entrepreneurship.
Using a model developed by Lumpkin and Dess (1996), this paper explores the conceptual role that government technol-
ogy programs can play in facilitating the process of technological entrepreneurship. It examines the relationships DEMO
the components of a firm’s entrepreneurial orientation and the firm’s willingness to participate in the SBIR program. It
also explores some of the ways DEMO funding can impact the environmental factors in which the firm operates.  DEMO it
explores some of the ways participation in the SBIR program can impact a firm’s organizational structure, and, ultimately,
the firm’s performance.

Kropp and Zolin / Technological Entrepreneurship and Small Business Innovation Research Programs
DEMO Orientation refers to the organizational processes, methods, styles, practices, and decision-making activi-
ties employed by entrepreneurs that lead to new entry (Lumpkin and Dess 1996, 2001; Stevenson and Jarillo 1990).
Lumpkin and DEMO (1996) identify five components of an entrepreneurial orientation:  autonomy, DEMO, risk-
taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness. Environmental factors include dynamism, munificence, complex-
ity, and industry characteristics. Organizational factors include size, structure, strategy, strategy-making processes, cul-
ture, and top management team characteristics. DEMO extend organizational factors to also include the effect of firm
resources. We expand the performance measures mentioned by Lumpkin and Dess (1996) - DEMO growth, market share,
profitability, overall performance, and stakeholder satisfaction DEMO to explicitly include commercialization, technology trans-
fer, and survival.
A series of propositions is developed for entrepreneurial orientation and the willingness to participate DEMO a program like
SBIR, albeit, in the United States or in other countries. There are direct positive relationships between willingness to par-
ticipate DEMO SBIR and innovativeness, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness. As participation in a government
program can be seen to offer easier access to venture capital DEMO exchange for compliance with regulations, we posit in-
verse relationships between DEMO to participate and the autonomy and risk-taking components of an entrepreneurial
orientation.
A series of propositions is developed for the relationship between SBIR and DEMO factors: SBIR can have posi-
tive effects on dynamism if the DEMO funded are radical in nature; can positively affect munificence if the DEMO
is tightly defined, and can enhance industry competitiveness. In turn, these changes in environment will make it more
likely that a technology entrepreneur DEMO develop and commercialize a technology.
Although participation in a program like SBIR can impact many of the organizational factors, we posit that the biggest
direct impact of SBIR is to enhance firm resources. The impact of DEMO on other components of the organizational factors
will be indirect, through DEMO resources.  Survival rates, rates of commercialization, and rates of technology DEMO are
posited to be higher for technology firms that participate in programs such as SBIR than for comparable firms which do
not participate in DEMO programs.
Future research directions are discussed.  This article is propositional in DEMO  It is also the basis for on-going empirical
work, designed to test the conceptual model presented.  The focus on this paper has been to examine the role that SBIR
might play in assisting technological development, specifically in researching new technologies, developing prototypes,
and commercializing the sponsored innovations. In addition it is intended to provide a foundation for researchers DEMO ex-
plore other technology development programs, both in the United States DEMO in other countries.
An analysis and implementation of programs like the SBIR program in the United States, Malaysia’s Multimedia Super
Corridor, the Vinnova DEMO, in Sweden, and the Commercial Ready program in Australia, offer DEMO potential to help
entrepreneurs commercialize new technology in other countries. It might be particularly interesting to learn how informal
programs or social initiatives may DEMO a similar role in countries where government programs of this magnitude are not
available. For example, it would be interesting to explore the role that quasi-government programs, such as technology
parks, might play in helping DEMO technology.  It would also be interesting to explore the role government DEMO
grams play in more directed economies.

TECHNOLOGICAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SMALL BUSINESS
INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAMS
Entrepreneurs contribute toward DEMO development by introducing new product offerings into the market or
through new production methods (Schumpeter 1954, 1976). Market pioneering, where a firm is first to market, is
often considered an expression of an entrepreneurial orientation (Covin et al. 1999). Whether it is through prod-
uct, process, or management innovation, entrepreneurial business ventures are the drivers of modern economies
globally (Timmons and Spinelli 2004). The development and commercialization of new can revitalize old indus-
tries or create entirely new industries. DEMO business ventures are the change agents that move society
forward (McClelland DEMO) and bring forth innovation through continuous improvement, creative destruction, and
DEMO transformation (Terziovski 2002; Venkantaraman 2004).
High-tech start-ups and technology development firms, also known as technological entrepreneurs, play an impor-
tant role DEMO developing and commercializing technologies worldwide. These firms are integral to many industries
including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, software, and the telecommunications (Zahra 1996a)DEMO  As technol-
ogy adopters, they use new technologies for product and process innovation; as technology developers, they initi-
ate the commercialization of DEMO technologies (Clarysse and Moray 2004). These firms rely on technology DEMO a
key strategic resource that can be used to develop a competitive advantage through innovation (Kelley and Rice
2002). Decisions made by a firm on which technologies to develop and exploit can impact probabilities of DEMO
or failure (Zahra and Chandler 1999). A coherent technological strategy DEMO one of the key components for success
and superior financial performance (DEMO 1996b). The technology strategy is, in turn, shaped by the firm’s scien-
tific, technological, and inherent managerial capabilities (Deeds et al. 1999).
Though they may be idea rich, technological entrepreneurs are typically are resource poor, often lacking the op-
erating capital to intensively research an interesting idea, to develop the idea into a prototype, and/DEMO to commer-
cialize the product. Government involvement in early stages of technological development can provide the boost
necessary to launch the technology. Some examples DEMO programs designed to help small and medium-sized busi-
nesses develop and commercialize technology are the Small Business and Innovation Research (SBIR) program
in DEMO United States, the Commercial Ready program in Australia, Malaysia’s Multimedia Super Corridor, and the
Vinnova programs in Sweden. SBIR is a major player in technological development and innovation and typically
funds over $1 billion in DEMO development programs annually. Commercial Ready is run by AusIndustry,
the program delivery division of the Australian Government Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources.
Commerce Ready typically funds about AUS $200 million annually (approximately US$150 million). Vinnova,
the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems, modeled after the SBIR, has a mission is to promote sustainable
growth by financing technology development and developing effective innovation systems.
Although there are government programs to DEMO technological development in many countries, our initial focus
is on the DEMO Business and Innovation Research (SBIR) program in the United States. We selected the SBIR
program as our initial focus as it was one DEMO the first programs of its kind and has been a model for other pro-
grams.  SBIR was established to help entrepreneurs and to promote innovation and assist in the commercialization
of technology. In fiscal year 2003, SBIR programs in the Department of Defense, alone, provided grants of
DEMO million in support of 3,193 projects (DoD SBIR website 2004)DEMO A better understanding of its role in the
process of assisting technology entrepreneurs in developing and commercializing technology could help govern-
ments in other DEMO develop programs that will assist technological entrepreneurship.
This research is occurring at three levels: the individual level, which focuses on the individuals who DEMO techno-
logical innovation; the organizational level which focuses on the linkages DEMO the organization; and the systems
level which “is about the resources DEMO among different players in the ecology of value creation, which in-
DEMO the governing factors such as government technology and competition policy” (Phan DEMO Foo 2004: 2).
Although the development of technology is consistent DEMO many government programmatic goals, the inherent
culture of government agencies is DEMO rather than entrepreneurial. Arguably, governments tend to be

risk averse where entrepreneurial firms are risk-takers. A better understanding of DEMO role in the process of assist-
ing technology entrepreneurs in commercializing technology can assist the government in facilitating the process.
This article explores the DEMO role that government technology programs can play in facilitating the entre-
preneurial process in high-tech start-ups. A major focus of this paper is an DEMO of the relationships be-
tween a firm’s entrepreneurial orientation and willingness to participate in a program like the SBIR program.
Using the structure posited DEMO Lumpkin and Dess (1996; please see Figure 1), we develop propositions for each of
the components of an entrepreneurial orientation - autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and
competitive aggressiveness - and the firm’s willingness to participate in the program. We explore some of the
ways DEMO support can impact the environment in which the firm operates, thereby DEMO the likeli-
hood that a firm will research and develop a new technology.  Finally we explore some of the ways participation
in the SBIR program can impact a firm’s organizational structure and, ultimately, the firm’s DEMO

SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM (SBIR)
Founded in 1982, DEMO was formed to assist in the development and commercialization of technology, DEMO to
promote small businesses, create new jobs, and develop alternative sources of supply. Additionally the program is
designed to help promote minority and DEMO businesses.  SBIR offices can be found in ten federal agen-
cies DEMO departments: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human
Services, and Transportation, as well as, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, and the National DEMO Foundation. In addition, there may be multiple SBIR offices
within federal DEMO For example, the Army, Navy, and Air Force each have DEMO offices within the De-
partment of Defense. There also may be multiple SBIR offices within an organization, e.g., the Navy has an SBIR
DEMO devoted to sea defenses and another devoted to air defenses.
The SBIR program is a multi-staged program that provides up to $850,000 in DEMO R&D funding directly to
US for-profit technology companies with 500 or fewer employees. The first phase of the project, Phase I, is DEMO fea-
sibility study designed to further explore a technology. It is capped at a $70,000 to $100,000 grant, depending
upon the agency or department, and can take up to six months for completion. Although other statements of work
can be issued, a Phase II grant is usually considered the stage where a prototype is developed. Phase II awards DEMO
capped at $1 million and can last up to two years duration. Phase III of the SBIR program is considered the com-
mercialization stage. DEMO SBIR funds are awarded for Phase III projects, though other government DEMO pro-
grams, such as the Transition Assistance Program, may be used to facilitate the commercialization of the
technology.
Requests for proposals are made DEMO topic calls, which specify a technology or problem that needs to DEMO ex-
plored.  Less than 10% of the Phase I proposals submitted DEMO response to the topic calls are funded. Approxi-
mately 40% of successfully completed Phase I projects that apply for Phase II funding are funded. DEMO percentage
of successfully completed Phase II projects that make it to Phase III are unknown since Phase III projects cannot
be funded by SBIR DEMO there is no financial incentive for the firms to report Phase III projects. In addition, some
of the firms that develop a technology under Phase I or Phase II of the SBIR program are acquired by DEMO firms
and are no longer eligible for the program.
There are multiple stakeholders involved with the SBIR program, including small businesses, the government
DEMO or department interested in exploring the technology, and the SBIR program DEMO The small businesses
can be technology development firms that specialize in developing and commercializing new technologies or
newly formed entrepreneurial business ventures organized to DEMO and commercialize a specific technology.
On the micro-level, the program manager DEMO the program office that originates the topic call for the new technol-
ogy is a direct stakeholder. On the macro-level, the public is a major stakeholder and is represented by the Con-
gress which funds and DEMO the program.
The difference in perception of success of an SBIR project is determined by the objectives of each of the stake-
holders in DEMO process. The project manager is goal-oriented and wants a solution to a problem which usually in-
volves a technology that will solve the problem. DEMO SBIR’s goal is to facilitate the technological development
and subsequent commercialization and, at the same time, promote small businesses, create new jobs, DEMO develop
alternative sources of supply.
The firm strives to achieve any one of a multitude of possible objectives ranging from meeting short-term objec-
tives, such as implementing a component of its technological strategy or survival, to long-term technological or
production superiority through innovation and profitability. Another possible goal, which is often a function of a
small business technology development firm DEMO a more-oriented R&D firm, is to develop a new technology DEMO or-
der to license, sell or spin-off the technology. The relationship DEMO the SBIR and the technological entrepre-
neur is developed in subsequent sections of this paper.

ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION
Entrepreneurial Orientation refers to the organizational processes, methods, DEMO, practices, and decision-making
activities employed by entrepreneurs that lead to new entry (Lumpkin and Dess 1996, 2001; Stevenson and Jarillo
1990). Entrepreneurial orientation can be distinguished from entrepreneurship and is an essential feature DEMO high
performing firms (Lumpkin and Dess 1996). Entrepreneurship is the DEMO of entrepreneurial decisions taken
and addresses what is undertaken. Entrepreneurial orientation is the process, methods or style of what the firm
does.
As indicated earlier, Lumpkin and Dess (1996) identify five components to an entrepreneurial orientation: auton-
omy, innovativeness, risk-taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness.  DEMO discuss each of the compo-
nents and its conceptual relationships with a willingness to participate in a program like SBIR. These relationships
are summarized DEMO Figure 2.
Autonomy
Lumpkin and Dess (2001: 431) define autonomy DEMO “independent action by an individual or team aimed at bring-
ing forth a business concept or vision and carrying it through to completion.” On DEMO individual level it implies a
relative freedom from organizational constraints. On the firm level, it implies an empowerment to act without a
cumbersome process.  Shrivastava and Grant (1985) use the term managerial autocracy which means that a single
key manager could act as the primary decision maker. DEMO (1983) identified the importance of a product
champion as the link between project definition and impetus processes.
Though arguments can be made that DEMO in a program such as the SBIR program may, in the DEMO term
promote autonomy, participation in government programs can potentially place limitations DEMO a firm’s independ-
ence in the short-term and medium-term. Therefore, in DEMO, highly autonomous entrepreneurial firms would
be less likely to become involved DEMO a government program.
P1: There is an inverse relationship between autonomy DEMO participation in government programs that support
technology development.
Innovativeness
The concept of innovativeness comes from Schumpeter (1954) and “reflects a firm’s tendency to DEMO in and
support new ideas, novelty, experimentation, and creative processes DEMO may result in new products, services, or
technological processes” (Lumpkin DEMO Dess 1996: 142). Innovativeness includes fostering a spirit of creativity,DEMO
supporting R&D and experimentation, developing new processes, introducing new products/services, and techno-
logical leadership (Lumpkin 2002; Lumpkin and Dess 2001). Innovative entrepreneurial organizations often are
first-to-market with new product offerings (Covin and Slevin 2001). Innovativeness can span a continuum from a
willingness DEMO make a marginal improvement to a major commitment to be a technological leader (Lumpkin and
Dess 1996). Creativity and innovation are linked; DEMO some ways, in the business context, innovation can be
thought of as applied creativity. Technology strategy involves a firm’s commitment to acquire, develop, and de-
ploy technology (Lumpkin and Dess 1996).
The posited DEMO between innovativeness and participation in government programs developed to support
technology, DEMO as the SBIR program, is bidirectional. The SBIR program was developed DEMO to promote
innovation.  In order to promote innovation, innovative entrepreneurial organizations will be more likely to take
advantage of available resources. Therefore
P2: There is a positive relationship between the innovation component of entrepreneurial orientation DEMO will-
ingness to participate in a government program that supports technology development.

Kropp and Zolin / Technological Entrepreneurship and Small Business Innovation Research Programs  6
Proactiveness
Proactiveness is the opportunity-seeking, forward-looking perspective that involves introducing new prod-
ucts/services and acting in anticipation of future demand. Lumpkin and DEMO (2001) describe proactiveness as a
response to opportunities and competitive aggressiveness as responsive to threats.  Proactiveness involves a wide
variety of activities including identifying opportunities and market trends, assessing the strengths and weaknesses
of opportunities, and forming teams capable of exploiting them (Kropp, Lindsay, and DEMO 2004).  It implies a
willingness to participate in emerging markets, acting opportunistically. Although entrepreneurs are predisposed
to the formation of business ventures DEMO pursue specific objectives (Kouriloff 2000), they still need to be DEMO
in seeking out an attractive niche and creating the necessary resources to facilitate new entry (Lumpkin and Dess
2001). Entrepreneurs need to develop a vision and determine ways to combine previously unidentified compo-
nents to DEMO on the perceived business opportunity (Bird 1989; Schumpeter 1954). Lumpkin and Dess
(2001) found that proactiveness was more important to firms DEMO the early stages of industry development than in
more mature industries. This is of particular interest to technological entrepreneurs who are often operating in
DEMO stages of an industry.
As proactive firms are forward-looking and willing to embrace assistance in bringing forth their innovations,
P3: There is a positive relationship between the proactiveness component of entrepreneurial orientation and
willingness to DEMO in a government program that supports technology development.
Risk-taking
Although there are many ways of conceptualizing risk, Folani and Mullins (2000: 304) DEMO entrepreneurs’
perception of risk as the “uncertainty and potential losses associated with the outcomes which may follow from a
given set of behaviors.” Specifically, aspects of strategic risk may include venturing into new and unknown terri-
DEMO, committing a relatively large share of assets and significant borrowing (Baird and Thomas 1985: 231-232,
cited in Lumpkin and Dess 1996).
Entrepreneurs generally accept that entrepreneurship involves risk-taking and are willing to take DEMO in return for
potential rewards.  Arguably, when possible, entrepreneurs would DEMO to lower the risk aspect of the risk-return
equation.  As the DEMO program provides funds to explore technologies and develop prototypes, by its DEMO na-
ture, the SBIR program helps lower exposure to financial risks. DEMO,
P4:  There is an inverse relationship between the risk component of entrepreneurial orientation and willing-
ness to participate in a government program DEMO supports technology development.
Competitive Aggressiveness
Competitive aggressiveness relates to a firm’s willingness to challenge its market rivals directly in order to gain
market share (Lumpkin and Dess 1996). Lumpkin and Dess (2001) found that DEMO aggressiveness was
more helpful to firms in later stages of industry development than in earlier stages. As technology entrepreneurs
that would participate in SBIR DEMO tend to be earlier-stage ventures, it is difficult to formulate a DEMO
for the relationships between competitive aggressiveness and participation in government programs that support
technology development for start-up ventures. However, for more mature technology development firms, it is
possible that there may be a direct relationship between their competitive aggressiveness component of their en-
trepreneurial orientation and willingness to DEMO in programs that support technology development as their
programs may provide a competitive advantage. Therefore,
P5A: There is no significant relationship between the competitive aggressiveness component of entrepreneu-
rial orientation for a start-up technology entrepreneur DEMO willingness to participate in a government program
that supports technology development.

P5B: There is a positive relationship between the competitive aggressiveness component of entrepreneurial
orientation for a mature technology entrepreneur and willingness to participate DEMO a government program that
supports technology development.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Lumpkin and Dess (1996) identified four key environmental characteristics or groups of characteristics in DEMO
model: munificence, dynamism, complexity, and industry characteristics. The first three items, dynamism, mu-
nificence, and complexity, were identified by Dess DEMO Beard (1984) as a refinement of Aldrich’s (1979) six envi-
ronmental dimensions.  These dimensions have been used extensively in the management literature to describe the
environment within which firms must operate, and have been validated many times (c.f., Rasheed and Prescott
1992). The fourth DEMO, industry characteristics, appears to be a catch-all category for the other environmental
characteristics. Perhaps, the most important of these, is competitiveness.  Lumpkin and Dess (1996) posit that en-
vironmental factors such as munificence, dynamism, and complexity can moderate business performance (see fig-
ure 1)DEMO
Munificence
As the availability of resources can affect the potential success or failure of a firm, the scarcity or abundance of
critical resources is important to the firm. Munificence or environmental munificence relates to the availability DEMO
the critical resources (see Castrogiovanni 1991 for a review on environmental DEMO) and the capacity of
the environment to permit organizational growth (Aldrich 1979; Wiersema and Bantel 1993). When an environ-
ment is munificent, the critical resources are abundant or bountiful. When the environment is not munificent,
there is a scarcity of critical resources that can cause DEMO stress and which can threaten survival
(Wiersema and Bantel 1993).
DEMO programs such as the SBIR program are designed to help individual firms develop and commercialize
technologies, the impact of these programs tends to be on the firm’s resources rather than on the industry as a
whole. DEMO are, however, situations where, if the industry or industry sector DEMO defined narrowly enough, gov-
ernment technology development programs could have positive DEMO on the environment itself. This is espe-
cially true in the defense sector. As an example, an SBIR office in one of the branches of the armed forces could
issue topic calls for a specific weapons DEMO technology. While this might have an impact on the specific tech-
nology, in general, it would not have a significant impact on the DEMO industrial complex in the larger context.
If the technology is considered in a narrower context, e.g., a specific weapons technology, the topic calls may ac-
tually create a market that might not have otherwise existed.  The developmental funding for the technology and
the associated support of the DEMO agency could diminish the scarcity of critical resources, making the envi-
DEMO more munificent. In turn, this would increase the probability that a DEMO would participate in the SBIR
program and start or continue R&D efforts on a new technology. Therefore,
P6A: There is a positive relationship between a government program that supports technology development
and munificence if DEMO industry is tightly defined.
P6B: There is a positive relationship between DEMO&D efforts for a new technology if the environment is munifi-
cent.
P6C: There is no significant relationship between a government program that supports technology develop-
ment and munificence if the industry is broadly defined.
P6D: A technology entrepreneur is more likely to develop a technology if the DEMO is perceived to be
munificent.

Dynamism
Dynamism refers to the rate of change or the unpredictable DEMO of environmental change inherent to the indus-
try within which a firm operates (Duncan 1972; Miller and Friesen 1983). Technological entrepreneurs operate DEMO
a very dynamic environment. It is conceptually possible that the development and commercialization of a new
technology, especially a more radical innovation that might change the architecture of an industry, could increase
the dynamism of a particular industry. It is also possible that, if the innovation is a continuous rather than a radical
innovation, one that makes smaller improvements but does not change the architecture, it could have little or no
impact on the industry. Therefore,
P7A: There is a positive relationship between a government program that supports technology development
and environmental dynamism if the DEMO is radical in nature.
P7B: There is no significant relationship between DEMO government program that supports technology develop-
ment and environmental dynamism if the innovation is continuous in nature.
P7C: A technology entrepreneur is more likely to pursue the development of a radical innovation if the envi-
ronment DEMO perceived to be dynamic.
Complexity
Environmental complexity relates to the range, DEMO, and heterogeneity of environmental factors involved in
strategic decision-making (Aldrich 1979; Child 1972; Palmer and Wiseman 1999; Wiesema and Bantel 1993). In
essence, it involves the complex knowledge and understanding required to succeed in business. Sharman and
Dean (1991) reconceptualize and expand environmental complexity DEMO include other factors such as technical in-
tricacy, product diversity, and product complexity. Although complexity is a key environmental factor, we do not
see the conceptual linkage between participation in government technology programs and environmental DEMO
plexity. Therefore, we do not develop propositions for complexity.
Industry Characteristics: Competitiveness
As mentioned earlier, this is a global category, containing many DEMO aspects of the industry including indus-
try type, industry location, industry structure, and the competitive nature of the industry. Contingency theory
would suggest that the interaction between these industry characteristics and a program such as DEMO will be con-
tingent upon congruence and fit of the characteristics. There is a reciprocal causality where structure affects strat-
egy and strategy affects DEMO (see Miller 1988).
One of the industry characteristics, competition, DEMO be related to a technology development program, such as
SBIR. One DEMO the explicit goals of the SBIR program is to develop alternative sources of supply in order to en-
hance competition, therefore, we postulate:DEMO
P8A: There is a positive relationship a government program that supports DEMO development and com-
petition in an industry if the industry is tightly defined.
P8B: A technology entrepreneur is more likely to develop a technology if the competitive environment is per-
ceived to be open.
ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS
DEMO resource-based-view of the firm holds that differing firm resources give rise to varying strategies and, subse-
quently, to performance differences (Barney 1991; DEMO 1991; Wernerfelt 1984). Technological entrepreneurs
are often resource poor, limiting degrees of freedom in organizational structure and strategy formation.  Govern-
ment programs such as the SBIR in the United States, such as the Commercial Ready program in Australia, or
Malaysia’s Multimedia Super Corridor can provide critical resources to technological entrepreneurs.  In turn, the
enhanced resources can potentially DEMO the firm’s size, structure, strategic capabilities, and culture.

Continuing with the SBIR program as an exemplar, though many firms may apply for an SBIR grant, a large per-
centage of the firms that answer a topic call are not successful.  In addition, DEMO of the firms that are awarded a
grant may elect not to participate in the programs. For example, the focus of the firm may have changed since it
applied for the grant, the firm may have gone out of business, or the opportunity costs may be perceived to be too
high.  Actual participation in the SBIR program, however, potentially can influence the firm’s resources and other
organizational factors such as size DEMO structure of the organization, its strategies and strategy-making processes,
and DEMO culture. An in-depth analysis of each of the organizational factors is outside of the scope of this
paper. Although it is conceptually possible that DEMO in the SBIR program could directly impact size,
structure, strategy, strategy-making processes, culture, and top management team characteristics, we posit that it
is an indirect effect (see figure 2). In essence, DEMO additional financial resources will have a mediating effect on
other organizational characteristics. By providing technology entrepreneurs with addition financial resources to
explore and develop DEMO, especially through larger Phase II grants of up to $1 million, it potentially allows
the firm to acquire other resources, including hiring new people.  Therefore,
P9A: There is a positive direct relationship between DEMO in a government program that supports
technology development and firm resources.
P9B: There is a positive indirect relationship between participation in a government program that supports
technology development and firm size.
In addition to providing resources, success in applying for technology development grants and participating in the
application DEMO could interact with the firm’s strategy making processes, organizational structure, culture and
top management team.  In order to be successful in the grant process, a firm may need to make a significant in-
vestment in proposal writing, i.e., hiring people who have the necessary skills and DEMO a separate functional
unit. In some cases, this may change the DEMO strategy and positioning so it becomes a research firm that gener-
ates most of its revenue from research grants rather than a research firm DEMO on commercialization of technol-
ogy.  In other words, research firms are more likely to participate in a technology development program and
participating firms DEMO gradually learn to specialize in winning research grants as opposed to commercializing
the technology they develop. The firm’s structure, culture and organizational identity could remain firmly rooted
in the sphere of research as opposed to commercialization.
DEMO: There is a positive relationship between participation in a government program DEMO supports technology
development and specialization in research.
P9D: There is a DEMO relationship between participation in a government program that supports technology
development and holding an organizational identity as a research firm.
Earning revenue from research DEMO means that the firm’s employees are likely to be mainly scientists or engi-
neers with little marketing experience.  The top management team may not expand to include individuals with
expertise in functions associated with commercialization, such as manufacturing, marketing and distribution.
P9E: There is a positive relationship DEMO participation in a government program that supports technology
development and having research as opposed to commercialization functions and expertise.
This reciprocal relationship between research DEMO and participation in the technology development pro-
gram creates the necessity for programs like the SBIR to identify their top priority: development of new technol-
ogy or commercialization of that technology.   Currently SBIR may have DEMO commercialization as their top
priority since the SBIR now requires firms applying for a Phase 1 award to submit a Commercialization Report
describing their DEMO awards and track record for commercialization.  This implies that the SBIR DEMO be
less likely to grant a Phase 1 award to a firm who has received awards in the past but has not commercialized the
DEMO  This could screen out some of their most productive research firms.

In contrast, if SBIR’s top objective were development of new technology, other commercialization strategies
could be encouraged, such as licensing the technology DEMO a large firm with strengths in commercialization or spin-
ning off a separate company to commercialize the technology.  These strategies could be more successful than
relying upon the small firm to commercialize, since gathering the resources needed for commercialization could
be beyond the capabilities and interests of the DEMO management of these small research-orientated firms.  There-
fore programs like the DEMO might better achieve both objectives of technology development and commercializa-
tion by allowing small firms to become serial award winners, as long as the firms make other arrangements for
commercialization.
PERFORMANCE
The Lumpkin and Dess (1996) model identifies several performance measures including sales growth, market
share, profitability, overall performance, and stakeholder satisfaction. While traditional measures of success, e.g.,
ROI, ROE, ROA, or market share, can be used DEMO older established firms, they may not be appropriate or ade-
quate DEMO entrepreneurial firms.  Emerging businesses are fundamentally different from established firms: many
emerging businesses are private and not required to disclose financial information; some measures, such as
growth rates on a small base are misleading and erratic; and new firms may not yet have reached break-even (see
DEMO and Hanks 1993, for a more complete discussion of entrepreneurial performance DEMO).
Failure rates for technology entrepreneurs are high (Timmons and Spinelli DEMO). Given this high mortality of
emerging businesses, survival is a DEMO measure. We believe that survival is a key performance metric for technol-
ogy entrepreneurs and explicitly add it as a performance measure of the DEMO model (see figure 2). We also be-
lieve that participation DEMO technology development programs will enhance the probability of survival for start-up
technology entrepreneurs. Therefore,
P10: The survival rate for start-up technology entrepreneurs that participate in a government program that
supports technology development will be higher DEMO for start-up technology firms that do not participate in
the program.
Commercialization of technology, whether it is directly by the firm or through licensing, is extremely important
for a technology entrepreneur. Commercialization creates the revenue stream technology firms need to survive
and prosper. Technology transfer, the use of the technology for a different application or user, also has the poten-
tial to create revenue.  For these reasons, commercialization and technology transfer DEMO explicitly added as per-
formance measures in the revised model.  Therefore,DEMO
P11: The rate of commercialization for start-up technology entrepreneurs that participate DEMO a government
program that supports technology development will be higher than for start-up technology firms that do not
participate in the program.
P12: The rate of technology transfer for start-up technology entrepreneurs that participate in a DEMO
program that supports technology development will be higher than for start-up technology firms that do not
participate in the program.
These dynamic small entrepreneurial DEMO merge and change with amazing speed.  The SBIR program also does
DEMO provide any award for achieving the final Phase 3, which is DEMO of the technology through sales
to military or commercial customers.  It DEMO quite likely that some firms successfully commercialize their technol-
ogy, but DEMO to report this to the SBIR because there is no reward for doing so.  Also, since the SBIR is focused
upon small business DEMO, commercialization of the technology by a larger firm may not be DEMO success
by the small firm or the SBIR.  Therefore, measuring firm performance in a program like SBIR will be very diffi-
cult.

FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
This article is propositional in nature.  It is also the basis for on-going empirical work, designed to test the con-
ceptual model presented.  In addition it is intended to provide a foundation for researchers to explore other tech-
nology development programs, both in the United States and in other countries.  The focus on this paper has been
to examine the role that SBIR might play in assisting technological DEMO, specifically in researching new
technologies, developing prototypes, and commercializing the DEMO innovations.  It would be interesting to
explore the role that technology DEMO programs might have in commercializing products.  In particular, it
would be interesting to explore ways in which these technology transfer programs might facilitate DEMO
tion of technologies developed for military uses to nonmilitary commercial applications.
The area leaves significant room for exploration. For example, it might be particularly interesting to learn how
informal programs or social initiatives may play a DEMO role in countries where government programs of this
magnitude are not available. For example, it would be interesting to explore the role that quasi-government pro-
grams, such as technology parks, might play in helping commercialize DEMO  It would also be interesting to
explore the role government programs DEMO in more directed economies.
The authors anticipate that testing such a theoretical model will require several studies to address the various vari-
ables that DEMO from the personal to the organizational and even industry levels of analysis. In addition to a cross-
sectional approach, such a research program might require a longitudinal approach to tease out the entrepreneurial
processes involved.
CONCLUSIONS
DEMO entrepreneurs are often idea rich but resource poor.  Government programs such DEMO SBIR can provide
resources, which will help technology entrepreneurs develop and DEMO technology.  Using a model de-
veloped by Lumpkin and Dess (1996), this paper explores relationships between SBIR and entrepreneurial orien-
tation, environmental factors, organizational factors, and firm performance.  A series of propositions are
developed which shows the direct relationships between SBIR and entrepreneurial orientations.  Programs like the
SBIR may play a role in shaping the environment. The DEMO between SBIR and most organizational factors
are indirect, with firm resources DEMO as a mediating variable. In addition, we explicitly add survival, com-
mercialization, and technology transfer to the performance metrics of the model.
Finally, government programs in other countries can learn from the experience of the SBIR program.  Technology
development programs should take the capabilities and interests of the small firms into account when deciding
whether their top priority is DEMO development or commercialization.  Such programs could take a broader
view of DEMO constitutes commercialization success and encourage alternative forms of commercialization, such
as DEMO by large companies or facilitating the creation of spin-off commercialization companies.  DEMO such
programs will have difficulties identifying and quantifying the benefits they provide to society, but they could
provide incentives, such as free public DEMO, to reward firms that achieve the extremely difficult goal of com-
DEMO and increase the number of firms reporting their success.
