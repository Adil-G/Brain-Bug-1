THEY DIFFERENT?

There is growing interest DEMO entrepreneurs who have been involved in more
EXECUTIVE than one venture, DEMO to date there has been relatively little theoretical devel-
SUMMARY opment and systematic empirical examination of the topic. In particular,
there has been DEMO attention to the potential heterogeneity of habitual entre-
preneurship. This study aims to contribute to this emerging area in two ways.
First, it outlines a conceptual typology of habitual entrepreneurs who have
founded, purchased, or DEMO businesses. Second, the empirical part of the study focuses on owner-
DEMO, providing an exploratory analysis of the characteristics and effects of independent DEMO
ownership by novice, portfolio, and serial founders. Novice founders are those that have no prior entre-
preneurial experience as either a founder, an inheritor, or a purchaser of a business. Portfolio founders
retain their original business and inherit, establish, and/or purchase another business. Serial founders
DEMO those who sell their original business but at a later date inherit, establish, and/or purchase an-
other business.
The study derives propositions DEMO differences among the three types of founders. At the
individual founder level of analysis, similarities as well as differences in the personal background, DEMO
experiences, reasons leading to the start-up of businesses, and personal attitudes to entrepreneurship of
these three types of entrepreneurs are explored. At the DEMO level of analysis, ﬁnance, employ-
ment and performance differences among the businesses owned by the three types of entrepreneurs
are presented.
The issues DEMO examined using a sample of entrepreneurs who were the principal owner-managers of
independent businesses in Great Britain. The sample included 389 novice founders (62.6%), 75 portfolio
founders (12.1%), and 157 serial founders (25.3%)DEMO No statistically signiﬁcant differences were found
among the three groups of entrepreneurs with regard to the main industrial activity, geographical location,

and the age of their businesses. DEMO and multivariate tests were used to examine potential differences
between the groups.
The results of the study show signiﬁcant differences between portfolio and serial DEMO with re-
gard to their parental background, work experience, and their age when they started their ﬁrst business.
Differences were also found with DEMO to reasons leading to start-up, personal attitudes to entrepreneur-
ship, and sources of funds used during the launch period of the surveyed business. DEMO ﬁndings suggest
that habitual entrepreneurs cannot be treated as a homogeneous group. The analysis, however, failed
to ﬁnd any signiﬁcant differences between the DEMO of the surveyed ﬁrms owned by habitual
founders and novice founders and between the two types of habitual founders.
The ﬁndings of the study DEMO for researchers that there is a need to carefully deﬁne the unit
of analysis in any examination of entrepreneurs. In particular, there is a need to take note of the heteroge-
neity of types of entrepreneur DEMO to consider the entrepreneur as the appropriate unit of analysis rather
than simply the ﬁrm. Although this study focused on habitual founders of businesses, the theoretical sec-
tion of the study also identiﬁed other types of DEMO entrepreneurs, such as serial corporate entrepre-
neurs and serial management buy-out DEMO buy-in cases. These other types of habitual entrepreneurs would
appear to warrant further analysis.
The ﬁndings of this study have a number of implications DEMO practitioners, especially venture capital-
ists. The absence of signiﬁcant performance differences DEMO novice and habitual entrepreneurs, which
is consistent with the results from DEMO studies, emphasizes the need for venture capitalists screening
potential investees not DEMO rely solely on previous experience.
The study also has implications for policy-makers, especially with respect to decisions concerning
the allocation of resources to assist nascent entrepreneurs, novice entrepreneurs, and habitual entrepre-
neurs. The similarities in DEMO performance among novice, serial, and portfolio entrepreneurs suggests
that policy-makers need to be careful in targeting scarce resources. Most notably, targeting resources to
encourage talented nascent entrepreneurs to become novice entrepreneurs may offer returns which DEMO
at least as good as targeting resources to more experienced entrepreneurs.  1998 Elsevier Science Inc.
INTRODUCTION
Starting a new business and/or owning DEMO managing an independent business is an
important career option for many people (Scott 1990; Dyer 1994). To encourage innova-
tiveness, competitiveness, DEMO creation, job generation and local and regional devel-
opment (Reynolds et a1. 1994), governments in industrialized countries have introduced
programs and initiatives (De Koning and Snijders 1992) to increase the willingness and/
or opportunity for individuals to become self-employed or establish businesses with em-
ployees (Van Praag and Van Ophem 1995). In recent years, many individuals have made
the transition from being nascent entrepreneurs, that is in the position of considering
starting a business (Carter et al. 1996) and DEMO actually established new businesses.
As a result of higher new ﬁrm entry rates than ﬁrm exit rates (Keeble and Walker 1994;
Westhead and Birley 1994), the number (or stock) of businesses in the DEMO United
Kingdom economy has increased (Daly 1991). However, this increase in the creation
of new businesses is not necessarily a reliable indicator DEMO the development of entrepre-
neurship in an economy. This study addresses an important part of this issue. In particu-
lar, we draw attention to the need to focus on the behavior of individual entrepreneurs
in a DEMO of settings that extend beyond one-time start-ups to include the purchase
and inheritance of a ﬁrm as well as the ownership of multiple entrepreneurial DEMO
Consideration of this broad context of entrepreneurship permits the development of
a framework for the analysis of habitual entrepreneurs.
As they are easier to DEMO and monitor over time, many researchers have ex-
plored the nature DEMO entrepreneurship by focusing upon the formation and development
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS

of organizations, using a variety of frameworks (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978; Gartner
1985; Van de Ven et al. 1989; Vesper 1990; Hannan and Carroll 1992). Studies DEMO
on new ﬁrm births as the primary dependent variable have implied that the nature of
entrepreneurship simply involves getting into business (Reynolds and Miller 1992).
Birley and Westhead (1994a, p. 57) during their comparison of novice and habitual
founders, however, concluded, ‘‘if the business is the sole unit of analysis there is a threat
that the value DEMO the new venturing event will be underestimated. It also indicates that
future attempts to explain business growth should incorporate the possibility that
owner-managers may DEMO to resolve their personal materialistic aspirations through
the growth of further multiple business operations, which may not be directly related
to the single unit of analysis being studied.’’
Studies of individuals (such as the self-employed and owner-managers) have im-
plied that the nature of entrepreneurship involves issues of ownership and control as
the primary dependent variable (Steinmetz and Wright 1989). Gartner and Shane (1995)
also suggested that the scale and nature of entrepreneurship in an economy can be in-
ﬂuenced by whether DEMO focus is upon individuals or organizations. In doing so they
focused upon Hawley’s (1907) theory of entrepreneurship, which argued that in order
to obtain an income or proﬁts, an entrepreneur must be the owner-manager of the orga-
nization; without such rights an entrepreneur would be unable to make decisions about
the successful coordination of scarce resources.
Recognition of the DEMO of ownership emphasizes the potential for entrepre-
neurship to be extended from start-ups to cases where individuals purchase a ﬁrm (Coo-
per and Dunkelberg l986; Robbie and Wright l996) and/or where they have inherited
DEMO business from the original founder (Westhead and Cowling 1996). In DEMO, the
introduction of direct equity ownership through stock options and managerial DEMO
holdings in subsidiaries of groups emphasizes the importance of an ownership interest
in the ﬁrm for corporate entrepreneurship to be enhanced.
In considering individuals, however, many studies have focused upon people in
work situations when developing career theory and exploring the nature of entrepre-
neurship (Schein 1978; DEMO and O’Farrell 1987; Dyer 1994; Katz 1994). Following
Smith (DEMO), Woo et al. (1991) examined the notion that based on their characteristics,
entrepreneurs can be broadly divided into craftsmen and opportunists. DEMO concluded
that the grouping of entrepreneur types was dependent on the sample of ﬁrms involved
and the method of analysis used to group entrepreneurs. DEMO contrast, Gartner and Starr
(1993) argued that it is speciﬁc DEMO of interlocked behaviors among individuals that
inﬂuence the creation of an organization.
Whether analysis focuses on individuals or organizations, there is a need to recog-
nize that entrepreneurship may not be a single-event action. More recently, researchers
have focused upon the characteristics of novice and habitual founders. Ronstadt (1982)
suggested many entrepreneurs start several businesses before launching a successful
DEMO Survey evidence has revealed approximately a third of owner-managers are
habitual founders because they have prior business founding experience (Birley and
Westhead l994a). Habitual founders are, therefore, an important phenomenon. More-
over, there is growing recognition that studying habitual founders may yield important
insights into the DEMO of entrepreneurial characteristics and into the nature of entre-
preneurial behavior (DEMO 1986; Starr and Bygrave 1991). There is, as yet, DEMO
evidence to support the hypothesis that habitual founders run more successful busi-
nesses than novice founders who have only established/owned only one business. DEMO
176
P. WESTHEAD AND M. WRIGHT
addition, research surrounding the habitual owner-manager phenomenon has not so
far explored systematically the nature of habitual entrepreneurship, nor the conse-
quences of its differing manifestations. It should also be DEMO in mind that a subset
of current novice entrepreneurs will become portfolio or serial entrepreneurs, which
may blur the distinction between types.
Starr and Bygrave (1991) have, nevertheless, drawn attention to issues surrounding
the DEMO and liabilities of habitual entrepreneurship, although they do not distinguish
different DEMO of habitual entrepreneurship. Dyer’s (1994) work on entrepreneurial ca-
reers is also couched very much in terms of its development in a growing DEMO over
time rather than the shift from one venture to another or the multiple creation or pur-
chase of ventures. Whereas there is a DEMO literature that appreciates there are differ-
ent ‘‘types’’ of owner-managed independent ﬁrms (Birley and Westhead 1990; West-
head 1990, 1995a) very few DEMO have, however, been conducted that have explored
the behaviors of novice and habitual owner-managers (Birley and Westhead l994a) and
serial and portfolio DEMO (Wright et al. 1995).
The purpose of this study is DEMO address this research gap. As intimated above, in
the theoretical and DEMO literature on entrepreneurial behaviour there is a growing
recognition of the need to carefully deﬁne the terms being used, since these may have
a major impact upon the generation of research hypotheses, the interpretation of empir-
ical results, and ultimately to our understanding of the entrepreneurial phenomenon.
As yet, there is no generally accepted deﬁnition of a ‘‘habitual’’ entrepreneur (DEMO
and Bygrave l991). A variety of deﬁnitions have been used which makes comparative
analysis difﬁcult. Donckels et al. (1987, p.48) claimed, DEMO business starters are
entrepreneurs who, after having started a ﬁrst company, set up or participate in the
start-up of (an) other ﬁrm(DEMO).’’ Kolvereid and Bullva˚ g (1993) adopted a narrower and
more conservative deﬁnition of experienced business founders. They suggested experi-
enced business founders DEMO established more than one business and they still owned
the most recent business prior to the start-up of the current new independent venture.
A DEMO deﬁnition of habitual founders was, however, used by Birley and Westhead
(1994a, p.40) who suggested, ‘‘ ‘habitual’ founders had established at DEMO one other
business prior to the start-up of the current new independent venture.’’ Hall (1995,
p.220) has also divided habitual entrepreneurs into DEMO and portfolio entrepreneurs.
Most notably, ‘‘There are those owners who own DEMO business after another but effec-
tively only own one business at a time. Previous businesses may have been sold, closed,
or had a legal outcome. These owners can be classiﬁed as serial owners. There is DEMO
category of habitual owner in which the owners own more than one business at a time.
These are portfolio owners.’’
Two types of habitual DEMO behavior are identiﬁed in this study. Serial founders
are deﬁned as those who sell their original business but at a later date inherit, establish,
and/or purchase another business (Beresford l996). A portfolio founder, however, re-
tains his/her original business and inherits, establishes, DEMO/or purchases another busi-
ness. The characteristics of serial and portfolio founders and their independent small
ﬁrms will be compared with one another in DEMO study. In addition, these two groups
of habitual founders will be DEMO with novice founders who at the time of the survey
had established only one independent business. Founders in this novice category may
themselves at DEMO later date become serial or portfolio founders.
To focus upon the characteristics of habitual founders, the article is structured as
follows. Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies are summarized to identify a

broad conceptual categorization of DEMO entrepreneurs, which includes founder, in-
heritor, and purchaser entrepreneurs as DEMO as corporate entrepreneurs. The analysis
is then extended to identify behavioral differences among novice, serial, and portfolio
founders as well as differences among DEMO businesses. Propositions are derived sug-
gesting differences between the three types of founders and their businesses. At the
individual founder level of analysis, similarities as well as differences in the personal
background, work experiences, reasons DEMO to the start-up of the surveyed business,
and personal attitudes to entrepreneurship between the three deﬁned types of founders
will be explored. At DEMO organization level of analysis, ﬁnance, employment, and perfor-
mance differences DEMO the three types of businesses will be presented. This latter
focus is important ‘‘because the quantity of entrepreneurial proﬁt is determined, not
by the number of individuals involved in each organization, but by the number of organi-
zations that create the surplus of revenues over costs’’ (Gartner and Shane 1995, p.294).
The subsequent section describes the data collection methodology. Results from the
univariate and multivariate analyses are then presented, and derived propositions are
formally tested. The ﬁnal section presents our conclusions and suggestions DEMO fur-
ther research.
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
Habitual entrepreneurship can be viewed along two broad dimensions, whether entre-
preneurship involves a new or existing business and whether or not there is a change
of ownership between ventures (Table 1). This framework thus includes habitual entre-
preneurs who are founders, inheritors, or purchasers of businesses or who have under-
taken multiple actions as corporate entrepreneurs. In our opinion, this framework opens
up a broad empirical agenda, but as will be seen below, the empirical part DEMO this study
focuses only on founders rather than inheritors/purchasers of businesses.
In discussing habitual or multiple business founders, but not purchasers, Hall
(1995) distinguished portfolio owners (quadrant 4 of Table 1), where DEMO of the
ﬁrst venture is maintained when a subsequent venture is embarked upon, from serial
owners who dispose of one venture before founding another (quadrant 2). Although
there is some evidence to show that habitual entrepreneurship is extensive (Birley and
Westhead 1994a), little empirical research has distinguished between these two types
of owners or embraces other forms of DEMO beyond start-ups. A noteworthy
exception is the empirical work conducted by Kolvereid and Bullva˚ g (1993) who exam-
ined portfolio founders who started DEMO than one business. Surprisingly, these re-
searchers explicitly excluded from their DEMO businesses where the founder may have
sold a business entity before or as well as embarking on another one.
178
P. WESTHEAD AND M. WRIGHT
This study argues that it is DEMO to address these issues, because entrepreneur-
ship is a heterogeneous phenomenon, which in turn has implications for expectations
about its nature and effects. DEMO the light of the recent developments in the notion of
entrepreneurship, DEMO categories can be broadened to include the inheritance and/
or purchase of an existing ﬁrm after the ﬁrst business is sold (quadrant 1). Serial entre-
preneurs may have exited from an initial business when DEMO opportunities
are perceived to have been exhausted. These entrepreneurs have, however, searched
for new possibilities through the inheritance, establishment, and/or purchase DEMO another
business. There is also, a somewhat erroneous, strand in the literature that suggests that
serial entrepreneurship only takes place after the ﬁrst DEMO has failed.
Corporate entrepreneurship involves managers creating new combinations of re-
sources in existing ﬁrms (Block and MacMillan 1993; Guth and Ginsberg 1990)DEMO Multiple
corporate entrepreneurship may occur within the same ﬁrm with individual managers
undertaking repeated entrepreneurial actions (quadrant 3). Managers in such organiza-
tions may be remunerated at least in part by direct ownership stakes in DEMO business,
either through stock options or through direct ownership in the subsidiary of a larger
group where they are employed.
It should also DEMO borne in mind that Table 1 effectively relates to ‘‘pure’’ habitual
entrepreneurship cases where entrepreneurs obtain controlling interests in subsequent
businesses. Between these four DEMO types, a range of intermediate types can be identi-
ﬁed. Entrepreneurs DEMO a portfolio of ventures may dispose of some of them over
time thus introducing a serial element to their behavior. Rather than becoming involved
DEMO further ventures as a full/controlling owner, entrepreneurs as individuals may DEMO
wealth generated from initial ventures to acquire minority stakes in ventures controlled
by other entrepreneurs, so fulﬁlling a role as habitual or serial business angels. There
may also be some blurring of the distinction between portfolio DEMO multiple corporate
entrepreneurs. Institutional and legal frameworks may provide entrepreneurs with the
incentive to create new legal entities rather than engage in additional entrepreneurial
DEMO in the existing ﬁrm. For example, this may be a means DEMO diversifying into risky
ventures while avoiding potentially damaging effects on the initial entity if it fails (Scott
and Rosa 1996). Between pure management buy-outs and corporate entrepreneurship
is the case where rather than disposing fully DEMO subsidiaries, corporations retain majority
equity ownership but remunerate managers with a DEMO direct minority stake in
the subsidiary where there is a clear role for speciﬁc entrepreneurial skills. Such actions
may then be repeated in other DEMO ventures of this type with the same entrepreneur-
ial individuals.
Clearly, DEMO categories identiﬁed in Table 1 suggest a broad research agenda, which
DEMO beyond the scope of a single article. The empirical part of this study focuses on entre-
preneurs who are founders rather than purchasers of DEMO or corporate entrepre-
neurs. In particular, we examine differences both between DEMO founders and multiple
start-up cases (quadrants 2 and 4) and between serial and portfolio founders. Proposi-
tions to be tested in this exploratory DEMO are derived in the following section.
DERIVATION OF PROPOSITIONS
Research on the traits, characteristics, and motivations for entrepreneurship suggests
differences between contrasting types DEMO entrepreneurs are to be expected. For example,
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS 179
Woo et al. (1991) DEMO provided an analysis of the craftsman / opportunist categorization
in start-up businesses. In addition, Robbie and Wright (1996) showed that whereas nov-
ice buy-out entrepreneurs were more likely to exhibit craftsman type characteristics,
buy-in DEMO were more likely to exhibit opportunist characteristics, though
both buy-outs and DEMO entrepreneurs displayed both types of characteristics. There
have been suggestions that buy-out and buy-in entrepreneurs (Wright and Coyne 1985;
Robbie and Wright 1996) differ in relation to length of managerial career and age at
which they started a business from novice entrepreneurs. These differences may, how-
ever, be blurred if some current novice entrepreneurs become habitual entrepreneurs
in the future.
During their study of novice and habitual independent ﬁrm founders, Kolvereid
and Bullva˚ g (1993) noted that very few women become habitual DEMO Sup-
porting the evidence presented by Donckels et al. (1987) they also found habitual entre-
preneurs were more likely to have obtained higher DEMO qualiﬁcations. As found
elsewhere (Birley and Westhead l994a), Kolvereid and DEMO g (1993) noted habitual
founders started their ﬁrst business at a younger age than novice founders. Although
a priori it is difﬁcult to DEMO potential differences between portfolio and serial found-
ers on the grounds of qualiﬁcations and age, the greater complexities likely to emerge
in managing a portfolio of businesses rather than in selling one and founding another,
DEMO that portfolio founders may have a background that has greater exposure to
managerial issues. The resources required to ﬁnance and the complexities involved in
DEMO and developing a portfolio of businesses suggests that these founders may re-
quire contributions from a greater number of partners than is the case DEMO serial or novice
founders. Although serial founders may have created wealth on exit and may seek to
found larger businesses, these may not necessarily involve the level of complexity ex-
pected in a portfolio of businesses. DEMO evidence yields the following propositions:
P1a: Novice founders were less DEMO to be as highly educated as habitual founders.
P1b: Novice founders DEMO more likely to be female than habitual founders.
P1c: Novice founders DEMO less likely to be drawn from a managerial and business
parental background than habitual founders.
P1d: Portfolio founders were more likely than serial and novice founders to have
a greater number of partners in their surveyed DEMO
P1e: Novice founders were more likely to be older when starting DEMO ﬁrst venture
than habitual founders.
As a result of prior business experience, many habitual entrepreneurs have devel-
oped skills and competencies, a rolodex DEMO network contacts, a business reputation, and
a track record. However, DEMO development of a portfolio of businesses, as in the case
of DEMO entrepreneurs, suggests a need for greater managerial skills than might be
DEMO in the case of novice and serial entrepreneurs. Hence, it is DEMO that these
entrepreneurs were more likely to have had a managerial or an executive position imme-
diately prior to start-up (Donckels et al. 1987). As intimated above, because habitual
founders are drawn from more resourceful backgrounds they are more likely to have
developed contacts and networks with DEMO partners and sources of resources (such
as ﬁnanciers, suppliers, customers, etc.). Supporting this viewpoint, Kolvereid and Bull-
va˚ g (1993) found ﬁrms established by portfolio founders generally had two or more
partners DEMO shareholders.
180
P. WESTHEAD AND M. WRIGHT
Serial entrepreneurs, by deﬁnition, move DEMO one speciﬁc economic activity to
another to achieve personal objectives. This type of habitual founder generally places
greater emphasis on achieving a particular goal DEMO receiving recognition for it which
is crystallized through the act of disposal. As the serial entrepreneur is expected to grow
businesses to a certain DEMO and then exit them, it is anticipated that such ventures are
DEMO to be smaller than those in which portfolio entrepreneurs are involved. It may
also be expected that serial founders have work experience backgrounds involving DEMO
ployment in a larger number of organizations with periods of self-employment. Notions
that places of employment often act as incubators for individuals seeking to DEMO a
business (Cooper 1985) suggest that novice founders are more likely to start a business
in the same sector as their last employer. DEMO upon their previous business founding
experience, habitual entrepreneurs may be more DEMO to perceive opportunities and
have the conﬁdence to start businesses in sectors that are not related to the activities
of their last employer. This DEMO suggests the following propositions:
P2a: Novice founders were more likely DEMO have worked for fewer organizations than
portfolio and serial founders prior to the start-up of the surveyed business.
P2b: Serial founders were more likely to have worked in a smaller ﬁrm prior to
founding their latest DEMO than portfolio or novice founders.
P2c: Novice founders were more likely DEMO portfolio and serial founders to have
founded a business in the same industry as their last employer.
The initial reasons leading to the start-up DEMO a new venture can, in part, inﬂuence
the development trajectory of a business (O’Farrell and Hitchens 1988). Entrepreneurs
who desire to create a successful and large independent organization of their own, rather
than pursuing a managerial career in a large organization owned by somebody else,
DEMO have motivational characteristics associated with a need for independence, a need
DEMO personal development, and a perceived instrumentality of wealth (Scheinberg and
MacMillan 1988; Birley and Westhead 1994b).
Drawing upon case study evidence, DEMO et al. (1995) found three different cate-
gories of serial behavior with individuals having differing objectives for their businesses.
Portfolio entrepreneurs may establish DEMO new business for a variety of reasons. Some
of these reasons may be concerned with circumventing legislation, for example, labor
laws that may DEMO become effective above a certain size level. Strategically, they may
create DEMO new business entity as a means of diversifying their activities. Whereas indepen-
dence is a strong reason for starting a ﬁrst business, a variety of other more materialistic
reasons (for example, to increase market possibilities, diversiﬁcation, tax reasons, en-
large business property for the family, etc.) come to the fore when a founder establishes
a subsequent business (DEMO et al. 1987; Gray 1993).
Following Smith (1967) and DEMO (1978), Katz (1994) has also suggested, the pro-
totypical autonomy-oriented individual (or craftsman entrepreneur) will tend to em-
phasize freedom DEMO than ﬁnancial or status achievement when starting a business.
Further, issues DEMO market opportunity (exchange) or asset accumulation (resources) are
less likely to be the dominant reasons leading to the start-up of a business. DEMO a person,
when employed by others, is less likely to DEMO jobs to increase his or her level of
autonomy. When they own a business, they generally limit the size of the business and
grow it to a psychologically comfortable level. By adopting this strategy, a consistent
living is provided for the owner and it ensures that the venture DEMO be personally man-
aged and controlled. Katz (1994) has suggested if this type of individual has multiple
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS 181
episodes of self-employment, they are handled one-at-a-time. This group of individuals
are, therefore, more likely to DEMO novice or serial founders.
Individuals who pursue entrepreneurial careers for greater pay and/or status are
more likely to be opportunist entrepreneurs. Further, this type of entrepreneur is more
likely to be pulled into entrepreneurship by DEMO external pressures of market (exchange)
or wealth (resources) (Katz 1994). Opportunist entrepreneurs own businesses generally
for the pursuit of growth DEMO wealth creation, and they are more likely to adopt legal
structures DEMO minimize ﬁnancial growth constraints. Because of the need for greater
pay and/or status, opportunist entrepreneurs operate businesses with high levels of sales
revenue and employment growth. Katz (1994) has suggested if this type of DEMO
has multiple episodes of self-employment, they generally have more than one DEMO
going at the same time. This latter individual is, therefore, more likely to be a portfolio
founder. Accordingly, this evidence yields the following propositions:
P3a: Novice founders were more likely to emphasize a need for independence when
starting the surveyed business.
P3b: Portfolio founders were more likely to emphasize a perceived instrumentality
of wealth when starting the surveyed DEMO
P3c: Portfolio founders were more likely to emphasize tax reduction and DEMO
beneﬁts when starting the surveyed business.
Cultural values can inﬂuence the predisposition of individuals to become entrepre-
neurs (Shapero and Sokol 1982). Four underlying dimensions of culture have been iden-
tiﬁed by Hofstede (1980) DEMO power distance (management of inequality between peo-
ple), individualism (relationship between individuals and collectives), uncertainty
avoidance (stance toward the future), and masculinity (allocation of roles between the
sexes). Using these concepts, McGrath et al., (1992) were able to empirically discrimi-
nate DEMO the cultural values of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs. This study,
however, DEMO to distinguish among the cultural values of novice, portfolio, and se-
rial founders.
Nevertheless, with regard to personal attitudes to entrepreneurship, Kolvereid DEMO
Bullva˚ g (1993) have argued that the creation of multiple businesses may arise where
opportunities for growth in existing businesses are restricted. Scott DEMO Rosa (1996)
have also provided evidence that suggested portfolio entrepreneurs DEMO created new
legal entities as a means of testing new products in the knowledge that if a new business
fails, its loss could be insulated from the other ﬁrms that they own. Portfolio entrepre-
neurs may, however, focus insufﬁcient attention on each of their individual ventures
and experience either uncontrolled or weaker growth. As noted earlier, serial founders
placing greater emphasis on achieving a particular goal may be seen as attempting to
DEMO uncertainty by crystallizing their gains through venture disposal. For these rea-
sons it is proposed:
P4: Serial founders may be more cautious in their approach to entrepreneurship,
preferring to seek opportunities with lower degrees DEMO uncertainty.
Different types of entrepreneurs may use contrasting sources of ﬁnance during the
launch period. As intimated above, habitual founders if successful may be expected to
have greater access to funds than novice founders. Serial founders DEMO have successfully
exited from their initial venture may have generated sufﬁcient funds to use personal
resources to ﬁnance their subsequent venture(s). If DEMO founders are not successful in
182 P. WESTHEAD AND M. WRIGHT
their ﬁrst venture, they may still be able to raise funds as evidence suggests that venture
capitalists seek DEMO of an ability to succeed the next time around and not just previ-
ous experience per se (Wright et al. 1997). Hence, DEMO would expect novice founders
without an established track record to rely upon personal savings, family, and friends
as a source of launch ﬁnance. DEMO portfolio founders who have not exited from
their earlier venture(s) DEMO be able to lever up resources from the existing business
and with their established track record may also make use of ﬁnance from existing DEMO
tomers and suppliers.
Habitual entrepreneurs may be expected to become involved in ventures the sec-
ond time around that are larger than those begun DEMO novices. To achieve ownership
of a larger business, serial entrepreneurs may DEMO rather than start-up their second
venture. In such cases the entrepreneur may be able to leverage his/her personal wealth
with funds from venture DEMO, whereas venture capitalists typically (in the United
Kingdom at least) DEMO an aversion to funding start-ups. Portfolio founders who by
deﬁnition retain at least part of their trading activities may also be able to leverage DEMO
from trading partners to develop new ventures. In contrast, serial founders DEMO have
relinquished their equity stakes in previously owned businesses currently have no trad-
ing partners to leverage-up. This evidence yields the following propositions:
DEMO: Serial founders, especially previously successful ones, were more likely to DEMO
used personal savings, family, and friends as a source of start-up ﬁnance during the
launch period of their present venture (which is subsequent to their ﬁrst venture)
than novice and portfolio founders.
P5b: Portfolio founders were more likely to have used banks and ﬁnancial institu-
tions DEMO a source of start-up ﬁnance during the launch period of their present venture
(which is subsequent to their ﬁrst venture) than novice and DEMO founders.
P5c: Portfolio founders were more likely to have used customers DEMO suppliers as
a source of start-up ﬁnance during the launch period of their present venture (which
is subsequent to their ﬁrst venture) than DEMO and serial founders.
Entrepreneural experience may lead to increased performance in subsequent ven-
tures. Enhanced performance may be measured in terms of faster sales DEMO employment
growth, greater proﬁtability and greater proﬁtability in relation to competitors. DEMO
ence may be expected to bring the skills required, including marketing DEMO ﬁnancial
expertise, to identify and serve market segments that have both DEMO potential and
proﬁt possibilities. Experienced entrepreneurs founding a new business in the same sec-
tor as their previous/current venture are also likely to DEMO in a relatively stronger position
by virtue of that experience than novice founders. In addition, they may be able to iden-
tify more clearly what is required to earn proﬁts in the selected market(s). DEMO,
Starr and Bygrave (1991) have suggested experience may bring liabilities as well as
assets. These liabilities may retard the performance of subsequent DEMO Subsequent
ventures may, therefore, not perform better than the ﬁrst business. For serial entrepre-
neurs it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a further DEMO venture, despite the fact that an
earlier venture was a success. DEMO they seek to purchase another venture, they may need
to engage DEMO an extensive search process to ﬁnd a venture that matches their skills and
which has the potential to achieve signiﬁcant returns. Not surprisingly, this process car-
ries with it the dangers of asymmetric information between the DEMO and the outside
entrepreneur which may still persist even among those with experience (Robbie and
Wright 1996). If they seek to found a new venture, experienced entrepreneurs face the
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS
183
problems both of identifying another DEMO idea and may attempt to repeat actions
that were successful in an earlier venture in new circumstances that are quite different.
Evidence from venture DEMO screening of experienced entrepreneurs indicates
that failure to ﬁnd a suitable project the next time around is an important reason why
experienced entrepreneurs may DEMO be funded again from this source (Wright et al.
1995). DEMO, such entrepreneurs may fund further ventures themselves in the opti-
mistic DEMO mistaken belief (hubris) that they can repeat their success, yet DEMO attempt
to repeat previously successful actions in a changed environment.
Faster business growth and greater proﬁtability may be expected to be associated
with experienced DEMO because, as intimated above, they are more likely to
be opportunistic type entrepreneurs. Supporting this viewpoint, Donckels et al. (1987)
during DEMO study of the ﬁrst businesses started by novice and multiple business starters
found businesses established by multiple business starters were markedly larger in em-
DEMO size at start-up as well at the time of the survey. In marked contrast, with
reference to the last business started by novice and portfolio founders, Kolvereid and
Bullva˚ g (1993) were unable to identify performance differences between the two groups
of independent ﬁrms. Similarly, Birley and Westhead (1994a) found no evidence that
new independent businesses established by DEMO founders were particularly advan-
taged compared to those established by novice founders. At this point, it is acknowl-
edged that in order to fully identify performance and growth differences there is a need
to consider all DEMO businesses owned by habitual entrepreneurs rather than just the cur-
rent business. These ﬁndings are consistent both with evidence that there are no signiﬁ-
DEMO performance differences between craftsman and opportunist entrepreneurs (Woo
et al. 1991)DEMO Further, serial entrepreneurs may display heterogeneous characteristics and
are not strongly DEMO or proﬁt maximization oriented. Nevertheless, the following
tentative propositions are suggested:DEMO
P6: Portfolio and serial founders were more growth oriented than novice DEMO
P7: Surveyed ﬁrms owned by portfolio and serial founders had performed DEMO
than ﬁrms owned by novice founders.
DATA COLLECTED
Empirical data presented in this exploratory study were derived from a wider interna-
tional study of DEMO of new ventures (Shane et al. 1991, Birley and Westhead 1994a).
The data were collected in late 1990 and early 1991. The DEMO adopted in this study
appreciated the differential importance of various social inﬂuences at signiﬁcant points
in an individual’s life cycle with a consequent effect DEMO the start-up process (Cooper
1981; Gibb and Ritchie 1982). This study was, however, not designed speciﬁcally to com-
pare novice, serial, and portfolio founders. Nevertheless, the research instrument pre-
sented to the DEMO founders of responding independent businesses enabled us to
identify these three types of ﬁrm founders.
Reﬂecting the increased recognition of the importance of locational DEMO
in the functioning of the economy and spatial variations in business formation, survival,
and growth (Westhead and Moyes 1992; Keeble and Walker 1994; Reynolds et al. 1994),
12 contrasting locations in Great DEMO were selected. They included government-des-
ignated assisted areas (Birley and Westhead DEMO); rural and urban environments
(Westhead 1995b); areas associated with DEMO declining traditional heavy indus-
184

tries and high concentrations of external DEMO, particularly in manufacturing in-
dustry; localities with high personal disposable income and high service new ﬁrm forma-
tion; and areas with strong and varied enterprise promotion through the activities of
enterprise agencies and development agencies.
DEMO there is no comprehensive list of independent ﬁrms in Great Britain, DEMO
pragmatic approach was taken in the construction of the survey frame. Based on the
assumption that local economic development units were most likely to DEMO concerned
about the proﬁle of their business population, regional and borough DEMO directories
were taken as the primary data source. Lists of potential independent businesses were
identiﬁed. These lists were cleaned, and community businesses and the subsidiaries and
branches of companies were excluded.
After this data cleaning, a list of 4,914 names and addresses of potential indepen-
dent new DEMO small businesses was identiﬁed. Questionnaires were sent by post over
a 6-month period (1.10.90 to 31.3.91) to the principal owner-managers of these busi-
DEMO [a full discussion of the limitations of the methodology have been presented in
Birley and Westhead (1992)]. Some 744 questionnaires were returned, DEMO which 621
questionnaire responses covered businesses between 1 and 50 years of age and the re-
spondents had speciﬁed their age when they had DEMO their ﬁrst business. It was not
possible to make any sensible calculation regarding response rates or, as noted above,
about the representativeness of the sample as a whole. Indeed, as argued in this study,
it is difﬁcult to be clear as to whether the characteristics of DEMO owner-manager as op-
posed to those of the ﬁrm should be the appropriate criteria for judging the latter (West-
head and Birley 1995). Nevertheless, at a two-digit Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation
(1980) minimum list heading level (frequently used by government departments in the
United Kingdom), no statistically signiﬁcant response bias was detected between the
respondents and nonrespondents. On DEMO criterion, we have no cause to suspect this
sample of independent DEMO was not a representative sample. However, the response
rates were generally DEMO in government-designated assisted areas (Birley and West-
head 1992). Therefore, the results from the questionnaire survey are most appropriately
to be seen DEMO suggestive rather than representative (O’Farrell and Hitchens 1989).
In total, 389 businesses (62.6%) involved novice or one-shot founders, that is the
business concerned was the ﬁrst to be established by the key founder. DEMO further 75 busi-
nesses (12.1%) involved portfolio founders, where the DEMO founder had owned two or
more businesses and still owned the ﬁrst business. The remaining 157 businesses (25.3%)
were serial founders who had owned two or more businesses but who did not now own
the DEMO business. Of the serial founders, 61 (9.8%) founders had sold DEMO ﬁrst business,
whereas the remaining 96 founders (15.5%) had either closed it or had other reasons
for not still owning it. In DEMO, in their study of 248 new ﬁrms in Norway, Kolve-
reid and Bullva˚ g (1993) found 132 ﬁrms were owned by novice DEMO (53%) whereas
a further 77 ﬁrms (31%) were owned by multiple business starters (or portfolio found-
ers) who still owned their DEMO business start-up. The level of portfolio business owner-
ship in the Norwegian sample is, therefore, far higher than the level reported in the
DEMO sample. Locational, sectoral, and age of business differences in the composition
of the two samples may, in part, explain this marked difference. DEMO, reﬂecting a
common weaknesses of prior research in this area (Donckels et al. 1987; Kolvereid and
Bullva˚ g 1993; Birley and Westhead DEMO), the characteristics of the other businesses
owned by portfolio owner-managers were not collected. As a result, the full economic
contribution of portfolio owner-managers cannot be assessed by this study.
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS
185
Tests were carried out on DEMO demographic attributes of the businesses in the
sample (their main industrial DEMO, the location of the businesses primary operational
premises, and age of the businesses since they received their ﬁrst orders) to examine
whether there were signiﬁcant differences that might contaminate the analysis (Gartner
1989). No statistically signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed among the groups of novice,
portfolio, and serial founder ﬁrms with regard to these three demographic attributes.
Over DEMO of ﬁrms in each of the groups were engaged in service activities (59.9%,
56.0%, and 52.2% of novice, portfolio, and serial DEMO, respectively) (x2 5 16.44; df 5
6, signiﬁcance level DEMO 0.172). A slightly larger proportion of portfolio ﬁrms were located
in rural areas (those located in an area with less than 10,000 people), although not in
a statistically signiﬁcant direction (26.2%, 32.0%, and 22.9% of novice, portfolio, and
serial ﬁrms, respectively) (x2 5 2.18; df 5 1, signiﬁcance level 5 0.337). In DEMO, no
marked differences in the age of businesses since they received DEMO ﬁrst order was
recorded (on average 7.3, 6.2, and 6.9 DEMO of age for novice, portfolio, and serial ﬁrms,
respectively) (F 5 1.17, signiﬁcance level 5 0.310).
TESTING THE PROPOSITIONS
Univariate Analysis
Chi-square and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted DEMO iden-
tify statistically signiﬁcant differences between founders and ﬁrms in the three owner-
ship type groups. Chi-square analysis was used to identify differences among DEMO three
types with regard to variables measured at a nominal level, DEMO ANOVA was used
in relation to variables measured at an interval level. In total, data were collected on
95 variables that characterize the founder and the ﬁrm [for a summary description see
Birley and Westhead (1992)]. Dichotomizing among the three founder types statistically
signiﬁcant differences were observed DEMO only 25 variables (26%). Statistically signiﬁcant
differences among the three DEMO of entrepreneurs–novice, portfolio, and serial—are
detailed in Tables 2 to 10, with notes to the tables indicating the existence of signiﬁcant
differences between pairwise combinations of these three founder types. Given the ex-
ploratory nature DEMO the study, it is the intention to identify issues that may DEMO important
in the context of either a fuller replication analysis and/or in another country context.
Accordingly, we report signiﬁcance tests up to the 0.1 level in order to minimize the
potential problem that important variables DEMO be overlooked using the more conven-
tional 0.05 level of signiﬁcance.
Personal Background of the Founder
No statistically signiﬁcant differences were recorded among the DEMO founder types
with regard to the education level of the founder. As a result, proposition P1a cannot
be supported.
Whereas over 87% of the founders in each of the groups were male, as expected,
a signiﬁcantly smaller proportion of habitual founders, particularly serial founders, were
females (row 1 in Table 2). In addition, a signiﬁcantly larger proportion of portfolio
founders rather than novice and serial founders were drawn from DEMO managerial parental
background (row 2). Novice founders, however, were DEMO more likely than se-

rial founders to be drawn from an unskilled DEMO parental background (row 3).
Propositions P1b and P1c are, therefore, supported.
Portfolio owners may be able to found and own multiple businesses because they
use partners, whereas the novice and serial entrepreneurs found their businesses alone.
This team aspect of entrepreneurship may be important in providing DEMO skills and re-
sources needed to maintain ownership of multiple businesses (DEMO and Covin 1992).
As expected, habitual founders, particularly portfolio founders, were signiﬁcantly more
likely to have established their new businesses with an additional shareholder or partner
(row 4). Additional research needs to clarify whether joint ownership is the key to the
ability to ownership of DEMO businesses. Nevertheless, proposition P1d is tenta-
tively supported.
As anticipated, portfolio and serial founders were signiﬁcantly younger than novice
founders when they started DEMO ﬁrst business with little difference found between the
average age of two types of habitual founders (row 1 in Table 3). However, DEMO the time
of the survey, novice founders were signiﬁcantly younger than DEMO entrepreneurs,
with serial founders being markedly older than novice as well as portfolio founders (row
2). Proposition P1e is therefore supported.
Work Experience of the Founder
Founders were asked to report on their work DEMO before the start of the business
being surveyed in this study. The results in some instances relate to lifetime prior work
experience. As expected, habitual founders, particularly serial founders, had worked
for more organizations before DEMO start-up of the surveyed business (row 3 in Table 3).
DEMO differing ages of the types of entrepreneur may, however, be a confounding factor.

Supporting evidence presented elsewhere, habitual founders, particularly serial found-
ers, were signiﬁcantly more likely to have been self-employed immediately before start-
up (row 1 in Table 4). Novice founders were, however, signiﬁcantly DEMO likely to have
started their business in the same industry as their last employer, with portfolio founders
being more likely to have changed their industrial focus (row 2). Habitual founders,
particularly serial founders, DEMO signiﬁcantly more likely to have worked in a small
ﬁrm with fewer than 100 employees before start-up than was the case for novice found-
DEMO (row 3). In marked contrast, signiﬁcantly more novice rather than habitual founders
had last worked immediately before start-up in a large ﬁrm DEMO 1,000 or more employ-
ees (row 4). As a DEMO, propositions P2a, P2b, and P2c are supported.
Reasons Leading to DEMO
Twenty-three reasons leading to start-up statements were presented to respondents (see
DEMO and Westhead (1994b) for a complete list). Signiﬁcant differences among the
three types of founders emerged with reference to seven variables (Table 5).
Novice founders were signiﬁcantly more likely than serial founders to DEMO sug-
gested ‘‘it made sense at that time in my life’’ (DEMO for independence’’). They were
also signiﬁcantly more likely than portfolio founders to have suggested ‘‘to achieve
something and to get recognition for it’’ (‘‘need for approval’’). In marked contrast,
novice founders were signiﬁcantly DEMO likely than portfolio and serial founders to have
reported ‘‘to continue a family tradition’’ (‘‘follow role models’’).
Habitual founders were, in addition, signiﬁcantly more likely to have emphasized

Twenty-one personal attitudes to entrepreneurship statements were DEMO to
founders (see Birley and Westhead (1992) for a complete DEMO). Statistically signiﬁcant
personal attitudes to entrepreneurship statement differences were recorded among the

preneurship statement relating DEMO an ‘‘uncertainty avoidance—stance toward the fu-

expected, serial founders had taken a more cautious view and had sought to reduce
DEMO by greater control, by focusing on achieving an exit at an DEMO time
to realize their gains and putting themselves in a position to focus on their next venture.
This seems in contrast to the suggestion DEMO above that portfolio entrepreneurs may
start-up new ventures in uncertain areas on the back of their original business, but focus
insufﬁcient attention on each of their individual ventures, thereby introducing the scope
for greater uncertainty. Proposition P4 is therefore tentatively supported.
Sources of Finance Used During the Launch DEMO

types. Habitual founders, particularly serial founders, used signiﬁcantly more DEMO
of ﬁnance than novice founders (row 4 in Table 3). DEMO to expectation, over 51% of

founders in each group had used ﬁnance from banks and ﬁnancial institutions. Portfolio
founders with established track records were, however, more likely to have obtained
ﬁnance from this source, although not DEMO a statistically signiﬁcant direction. Supporting
the view that serial founders may have used the funds received on exiting from their
last venture to ﬁnance DEMO next, this group of founders was signiﬁcantly more likely than
the DEMO founders to have used personal savings, family, and friends as a source of start-
up capital in their current business (row 1 in Table 7). Portfolio founders were the least
likely to do so, perhaps reﬂecting notions that they can fund new ventures from the
reputation DEMO track record associated with their existing ventures. This is to some ex-
tent borne out by the greater incidence of portfolio founders having used DEMO
and suppliers (row 2) and ‘‘other’’ sources of ﬁnance (row DEMO). As a result, P5a and P5c
are supported. In marked DEMO, P5b cannot be conﬁrmed.
Future of the Business
Approximately, half the founders in each of the three groups considered that their stan-
dard DEMO living was better now than when they started the business (row DEMO in Table 8).
Although not in a statistically signiﬁcant direction, DEMO types of habitual founders were
somewhat more likely than novice founders to be optimistic that their business would
expand over the next 2 years (row 2). Moreover, over 91% of founders in each of the

to increase the total employment sizes DEMO their businesses (row 4). Although not in a

wished to grow employment, whereas both types of habitual founders expressed similar

Performance of the Business
Business performance was examined on several dimensions covering DEMO and changes
in sales revenues, levels and changes in proﬁtability, the performance of the ﬁrm relative
to the competition, and the share of sales exported abroad. No signiﬁcant differences
in performance were identiﬁed between ﬁrms DEMO and controlled by the three groups
of founders (Table 9). DEMO, at a coarse level of analysis, a weakly signiﬁcantly larger
proportion of novice rather than habitual founders operated businesses that were
proﬁtable (rather than making a loss or at break-even) at the 0.1 level of signiﬁcance.
Although not in a statistically signiﬁcant direction, ﬁrms owned by portfolio founders
were somewhat more likely to have increased their proﬁts in the DEMO year and to rate
their businesses favorably in relation to the competition than was the case for ﬁrms
owned by novice or serial founders.
DEMO tests were also used to detect levels and changes in employment contrasts
among the three groups of ﬁrms. Part-time and casual employees were taken DEMO ac-
count by scoring full-time, part-time, and casual employees 1, DEMO, and 0.25, respectively
(Cooper et al. 1989, pp. 323–324). No statistically signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed
(Table 10). Nevertheless, serial DEMO ﬁrms reported higher levels of current employ-
ment and standardized changes in employment (i.e., after adjusting for the effects of

Discriminant Analysis
Results discussed above show prima facie evidence for dissimilarities among novice,
portfolio, and serial founders. An exploratory discriminant analysis minimizing the
Wilks’ lambda (Norusis 1988) was used to identify the DEMO of variables that
best summarized and dichotomized the three types of founders. A stepwise selection
method was used to identify a more parsimonious subset DEMO variables that discriminates
nearly as well as, if not better than, the full set (Klecka 1980). The ﬁnal parsimonious
model also provides a means to assign (and classify) any respondent into the ownership
DEMO (or type) it most closely resembles. As in previous studies, DEMO predictive accu-
racy of the ﬁnal model was not the paramount objective for using this multivariate tech-
nique. Consequently, a hold-out sample to test the predictive utility of the ﬁnal model
was not assembled.
The ﬁnal DEMO analysis model is detailed in Table 11. This parsimonious
model includes 15 variables. The discriminant analysis revealed that the ﬁrst discrimi-
nant function had DEMO eigenvalue of 0.25 accounting for 70.6% of the variance, with a
DEMO correlation of 0.45. The second discriminant function had an eigenvalue of
0.10, accounting for 29.4% of the variance. Wilks’ lambda values for functions 1 and
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS
195
2 were 0.72 and 0.91, respectively. Both lambdas were signiﬁcant at the .001 level or
less. Another DEMO of the effectiveness of the discriminant model is the degree of
predictive accuracy measured by the percentage of cases (or founders) classiﬁed cor-
DEMO Overall, 57% of the founders were correctly classiﬁed, considerably greater than
that could be achieved by chance alone. The ﬁnal model correctly assigned DEMO of nov-
ice founders and 57% of serial founders to their correct ownership category. Slightly
fewer portfolio founders (51%) were, however, assigned DEMO their correct group.
Standardized canonical discriminant function coefﬁcients in Table 11 indicate the
relative importance of the variables included in the model and are DEMO to describe the
signiﬁcant differences between the founder types. The pooled within-groups correla-
tions show how closely a variable and a discriminating function are DEMO, and a dis-
criminating function is described on the basis of DEMO structure matrix.
The ﬁrst function, which explained most of the variance, differentiated the serial
founders from the other two types of founders. Serial DEMO were drawn from non-
managerial parental backgrounds and they established their ﬁrst business at a very early
age. They had gained experience by working DEMO a large number of organizations on a
full-time basis. Immediately before the start-up of the surveyed ﬁrm, a larger proportion
of them had been self-employed. In terms of the reasons leading to start-up of their
current DEMO, ‘‘it made sense at that time in my life’’ (‘‘need for independence’’) and
‘‘to have more inﬂuence in my community’’ (‘‘welfare considerations’’) were to no ex-
tent important. Further, they had obtained start-up capital during the launch period
from personal savings, family, and friends.
The DEMO function separated portfolio founders from the other two types of
founders. Portfolio founders’ parents during childhood mostly held managerial posi-
tions. They were young DEMO they started their ﬁrst business. Because they owned other
businesses (with DEMO), portfolio founders generally had not been self-employed
immediately before the start-up of the surveyed business. The managerial, technical
and ﬁnancial resources of at least one additional shareholder or partner were used to
develop the surveyed DEMO In addition, drawing upon prior experience and contacts,
customers and DEMO had been used as a source of start-up capital during the launch
period of the business. The principal reasons leading to the start-up of DEMO surveyed
ﬁrms were as follows: ‘‘to give self, spouse, and DEMO security’’ (‘‘perceived instru-
mentality of wealth’’) and ‘‘to have access to indirect beneﬁts such as tax exemptions’’
(‘‘tax reduction and indirect beneﬁts’’). Interestingly, ‘‘to achieve something and get
recognition for it’’ (‘‘need for DEMO) was to no extent important. However, three
personal attitudes to entrepreneurship were important: ‘‘I have a duty to give all clients
and customers the same treatment’’ (‘‘individualism—relationship between individu-
als’’), ‘‘equality is everyone’s right’’ (‘‘power distance—management of inequality be-
tween people’’), and ‘‘starting a business means uncertainty but adds to the excitement
of life’’ (‘‘uncertainty avoidance—stance toward the future’’).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
This study has DEMO an exploratory analysis of different types of habitual entrepre-
neurs. The particular focus has been on two types of habitual entrepreneurs, portfolio
and serial entrepreneurs, who had established/owned more than one business. This
study has identiﬁed similarities and differences between novice and habitual founders
as well as DEMO the two types of habitual founders. In respect of portfolio and serial

founders, signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed in terms of the age of the founders when
starting their ﬁrst businesses, parental background, and the work experiences of the
founders. Differences between the habitual founders were also noted with regard to
reasons leading to start-up, personal attitudes to entrepreneurship, and sources of ﬁ-
nance used during the launch period.
Our analysis, therefore, suggests habitual entrepreneurs cannot be treated DEMO a ho-
mogeneous group. Birley and Westhead (1994a) during their comparison of novice and
habitual new ﬁrm founders identiﬁed only two signiﬁcant variables DEMO to reasons
leading to start-up when they compared novices with habituals as a group (i.e., portfolio
and serial founders combined). In marked DEMO, our ﬁner level of analysis, which
distinguished habitual founders into portfolio and serial founders, identiﬁed seven sig-
niﬁcant differences. Birley and Westhead (DEMO) found habitual founders were not
more likely to stress materialistic reasons DEMO starting their current venture, our more
reﬁned analysis interestingly noted portfolio DEMO were signiﬁcantly more likely
than serial and novice founders to have reported this start-up reason. In addition, Birley
and Westhead (1994a) found signiﬁcant differences between novice and habitual found-
ers with regard to sources of DEMO used during the launch period. Most notably, they
reported novice founders DEMO signiﬁcantly more likely to have used ﬁnance from per-
sonal savings, DEMO and friends, and from customers and suppliers. Our analysis, how-
ever, shows that when habitual founders are divided into two founder types, DEMO
founders were signiﬁcantly more likely to have used launch ﬁnance from personal
sources, whereas portfolio founders were more likely to have used ﬁnance from custom-
ers and suppliers. Birley and Westhead (1994a) also reported ﬁrms DEMO by habitual
founders were more likely to be associated with teams of partners than was the case
for novice ﬁrms. Further, our more reﬁned analysis suggests this difference was driven
by portfolio founders. Birley and Westhead’s DEMO that habitual founders had gained
greater previous experience through being self-employed immediately before the start-
up of the surveyed business appears to have been DEMO by serial founders.
Consistent with other studies that have compared novice and habitual founders,
our analysis failed to ﬁnd any signiﬁcant differences between DEMO performance of ﬁrms
owned by habitual founders when they were separated into serial and portfolio busi-
nesses. This evidence suggests owner-managers with prior business DEMO experience
do not establish/own businesses that outperform those established by founders who
have no prior business founding experience. Many habitual entrepreneurs, therefore,
bring to their subsequent ventures some liabilities that may impede their performance.
DEMO of the liabilities and assets brought by habitual entrepreneurs to their sub-
sequent ventures is, therefore, an important area for additional analysis.
When DEMO explored the attributes and reasons leading to business start-up, the indi-
DEMO founder was the unit of analysis. However, when we focused upon DEMO,
the unit of analysis was the organization (or the single DEMO ﬁrm). To appreciate
fully the economic contribution of the habitual entrepreneurship phenomenon, we must
gather information on all the organizations founded/owned by habitual entrepreneurs.
Moreover, it will be necessary to distinguish real additional entrepreneurial activity
from that which is merely a device to circumvent institutional restrictions, for example,
to avoid labor laws which may become effective when DEMO business exceeds a certain num-
ber of employees. Future research should focus on the founder/entrepreneur (rather
than a particular organization) as the DEMO of analysis to enable a more detailed assess-
ment of the nature and contribution of entrepreneurship. We believe the organization
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS
199
should not be the sole DEMO of analysis because some entrepreneurs attempt to resolve
their personal materialistic aspirations through the growth of a portfolio of businesses
(Birley and Westhead 1994a). It should also be noted that empirical analysis of novice
or DEMO entrepreneurs is fraught with the potential difﬁculty that a subset of such
entrepreneurs may be future habitual entrepreneurs. As such, attempts to distinguish
the characteristics of novice and habitual entrepreneurs may be colored by an absence
DEMO strict mutual exclusivity between the groups. As noted earlier, it should DEMO borne
in mind that the analysis in this article has focused upon habitual founders of businesses,
which is only a subset of the DEMO phenomenon that includes habitual inheritors/pur-
chasers of businesses and multiple corporate entrepreneurship.
The ﬁndings of this study have implications for practitioners, especially venture
capitalists. The absence of signiﬁcant performance differences between novice and ha-
bitual DEMO, which is consistent with evidence from other studies, emphasizes
the need for venture capitalists screening potential investees not to rely solely on previ-
DEMO experience but to analyze carefully the assets and liabilities of entrepreneurs’ earlier
background and whether experienced entrepreneurs have the motivation to undertake
a subsequent DEMO It was beyond the scope of this study to consider the relationships
between ﬁnanciers and types of habitual entrepreneur. Given the differences between
serial DEMO portfolio entrepreneurs, venture capitalists need to examine carefully the ob-
jectives DEMO potential investees with previous experience. For example, serial entrepre-
neurs may DEMO more amenable to the notion of venture capitalists’ investment time hori-
zons and be more willing to accept the possibility of an exit within DEMO given period.
Portfolio entrepreneurs may be more attuned to a more indeﬁnite development of the
business, which may be in conﬂict with venture capitalists’ objectives. Our results also
raise questions about the growth objectives of different DEMO of habitual entrepreneurs
that venture capitalists may need to consider. For example, serial entrepreneurs may be
more comfortable with the notion of growing the business to a manageable size, whereas
portfolio entrepreneurs may seek greater growth opportunities. These differing per-
spectives may have implications for the nature of DEMO control processes that venture
capitalists may be able to introduce for each type of founder. Further work examining
the links between venture capitalists and DEMO entrepreneurs would seem warranted.
The empirical evidence presented here and elsewhere suggests researchers and pol-
icy-makers must appreciate there is a variety of types DEMO entrepreneurs (as well as ﬁrms)
(Birley and Westhead 1990; DEMO 1995a). Future research attention must, there-
fore, focus upon developing frameworks and theories that better describe the variety
of career options open DEMO entrepreneurs. In addition, future research should increasingly
monitor all the businesses DEMO/owned by portfolio and serial founders and inher-
itors/purchasers of businesses. Cohorts of different types of founders and inheritors/
purchasers (and their ﬁrms) need to be monitored over considerable time periods to
provide the research community and policy-makers with a more accurate assessment
of the scale DEMO nature of entrepreneurship.
The ﬁnding that prior experience did not lead to signiﬁcantly higher performance
raises a number of issues for researchers. The ﬁnding DEMO into research on the assets
and liabilities of entrepreneurial experience (Starr DEMO Bygrave 1991) and suggests that
perhaps the former may offset the DEMO There would, therefore, appear to be scope
for large scale research that examines carefully the relative importance of different
assets and liabilities of DEMO entrepreneurial experience.
One interpretation of the ﬁndings of this study is to call into question research on
200

venture capitalists’ screening processes that emphasize DEMO importance of prior experi-
ence. However, a more attractive approach may DEMO the need to appreciate that prior
entrepreneurial experience per se may be a necessary but not a sufﬁcient condition for
the enhanced performance of DEMO subsequent venture. A major issue is whether the entre-
preneur is able to identify an opportunity the second time around that can achieve
greater DEMO than the ﬁrst. Evidence from venture capitalists’ views of serial
entrepreneurs has suggested that this is often the major problem (Wright et al. 1997).
This in turn suggests that research that examines trade-offs between the DEMO attri-
butes of entrepreneurs and their business plans (Muzyka et al. DEMO) may provide an
important approach for understanding the likely prospects for DEMO ventures
owned by habitual entrepreneurs.
This study has focused on the characteristics of habitual and novice entrepreneurs
and their ﬁrms. Future research might usefully DEMO carefully the different processes
used by these different types of entrepreneur in searching for, entering, and growing
their ﬁrst and subsequent ventures. Further, this study has not examined the role of
venture capitalists and other DEMO in providing governance of entrepreneurial
ventures. This may be important in enabling entrepreneurs to proﬁtably extend their
ventures beyond the initial more entrepreneurial growth DEMO
Habitual entrepreneurs may be sufﬁciently competent covering less routine areas
of entrepreneurship. However, beyond the start-up phase they may be less competent
at growing their business above a modest size and scale of development. This suggests
DEMO is a need to explore the attributes and behavior of entrepreneurs who have suc-
ceeded in growing their businesses to larger sizes and greater DEMO levels. To
identify more closely the learning experience, there is also DEMO for further academic
research that compares both the subsequent experiences of ﬁrst time successful versus
unsuccessful entrepreneurs, and the prior experiences of successful versus unsuccessful
habitual entrepreneurs.
Additional research will enable policy-makers to assess the direct DEMO indirect ben-
eﬁts as well as costs of providing assistance to nascent entrepreneurs compared with
novice, portfolio, or serial entrepreneurs. Increased information will DEMO policy-mak-
ers more appropriate resource allocation decisions toward potential or different types
of practicing entrepreneurs.
To encourage regional and national development, two important policy-led ques-
tions need to be addressed. First, should policy-makers target scarce economic resources
to nascent entrepreneurs and increase the number of ﬁrm owners in DEMO economy to its
carrying capacity level? Second, should policy-makers target scarce resources toward
the small number of existing founders (of which, a DEMO are habitual entrepreneurs)
or the small proportion of owner-managed ﬁrms (DEMO 1994) that have the inclination
as well as the ability to DEMO signiﬁcant wealth creators and employment generators?
The empirical evidence presented in this article makes a contribution to this impor-
tant debate. Most notably, we found novice founders established ﬁrms that made com-
parable contributions to DEMO creation and job generation as those established by port-
folio and serial entrepreneurs. Policy-makers desiring to target scarce economic
resources to ﬁrms that generate DEMO vast majority of jobs must, therefore, appreciate
prior venture experience does not necessarily ensure that this type of founder will subse-
quently establish/DEMO a high growth venture. Moreover, the existing pool of experi-
enced DEMO may not be the source of high growth potential ventures. Efforts,
therefore, may be needed to encourage more talented nascent entrepreneurs to become
NOVICE, PORTFOLIO, AND SERIAL FOUNDERS 201
novice entrepreneurs. Policy-makers, however, DEMO appreciate that the encourage-
ment of more new ﬁrm founders (and DEMO ﬁrms) in an economy may lead to increased
competition, particularly in market niches at their carrying capacity level, and new en-
trants may displace existing ﬁrms. With regard to this important issue of targeting assis-
DEMO to particular types of founders and ﬁrms, Reynolds et al. (1994) have argued:
...in regions where economic growth is quite satisfactory, DEMO efforts might
be restricted to assisting new ﬁrms with high growth potential or a potential for out-
of-region exports. In a region with poor DEMO growth but with a promising eco-
nomic base, government assistance might DEMO new ﬁrms with potential for
high growth or out-of-region exports but also provide some assistance for all new
ﬁrm start-ups. In regions with neither DEMO growth nor a promising economic
base, the only option available may DEMO to provide general assistance to all potential
new ﬁrm founders.
Before we can conclusively answer the two policy-led research questions stated
above, future research must address the following research questions (Dyer 1994, p.16).
What DEMO the relative inﬂuences of various antecedents on a portfolio or serial career
choice? Which factors—individual, social, or economic—have the greatest impact?
How do these factors interact with one another to motivate someone to start DEMO portfolio
or serial entrepreneurial career? By what processes can these antecedents DEMO changed
or inﬂuenced? Are there common socialization experiences for all types DEMO entrepre-
neurs? Do certain types of socialization experiences determine whether particular DEMO
of entrepreneurs are more successful? In what industrial sectors/regions/cultures DEMO
habitual entrepreneurs over/underrepresented? In addition, it is important to consider
a multifaceted approach that covers both the multiple creation and inheritance/pur-
DEMO of businesses. As well as wealth creation from the founding of businesses, habitual
purchasing of businesses followed by restructuring and innovation (especially where
DEMO businesses have been underperforming as an unfavored part of a larger group or
a potentially strong part of a failing larger organization) also offer such prospects
(Wright et al. 1997).
As appreciated elsewhere (Dyer DEMO), to address these research questions there
is a need for additional research from an objective as well as a subjective stance. There
is DEMO need for more in-depth longitudinal research focusing upon different types of poten-
tial and practicing entrepreneurs (Van de Ven 1992). Whereas additional quantitative
questionnaire studies will bear further fruitful information and conﬁrmatory evidence,
there DEMO also the need for more in-depth ethnographic case study research using semi-
structured interviews as well as the participant-observation techniques of sociology and
anthropology (Churchill 1992).
