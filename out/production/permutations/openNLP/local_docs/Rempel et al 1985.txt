Trust in Close Relationships

A theoretical model describing interpersonal trust in DEMO relationships is presented.
Three dimensions of trust are identified, based on DEMO type of attributions drawn
about a partner's motives. These dimensions are also characterized by a devel-
opmental progression in the relationship. The validity DEMO this theoretical perspective
was examined through evidence obtained from a survey of a heterogeneous
sample of established couples. An analysis of the Trust Scale DEMO this sample was
consistent with the notion that the predictability, dependability, and faith com-
ponents represent distinct and coherent dimensions. A scale to DEMO interper-
sonal motives was also developed. The perception of intrinsic motives in a partner
emerged as a dimension, as did instrumental and extrinsic motives. As expected,
love and happiness were closely tied to feelings of DEMO and the attribution of
intrinsic motivation to both self and partner. Women appeared to have more
integrated, complex views of their relationships than men: All three forms of
trust were strongly related and attributions of instrumental motives in their
partners seemed to be self-affirming. Finally, there was a tendency for people to
view their own motives as less self-centered and DEMO exclusively intrinsic in
flavor than their partner's motives.
Trust is certainly one of the most desired
qualities in any close relationship. It is DEMO
mentioned in conjunction with love and
commitment as a cornerstone of the ideal
relationship (c. Hendrick & S. Hendrick,
1983). Given that trust is accorded such an
esteemed position, is it surprising that there
is comparatively little focus on this concept
in the research literature. In DEMO article a
component theory of trust will be proposed,
which takes into account the fabric of expe-
riences in close relationships. Depending on
DEMO stage of the relationship, the experiences
on which trust is based DEMO change and the
interpretations those experiences receive will
also progress from a more straightforward
acceptance of behavioral evidence to the at-
tribution of interpersonal DEMO Particular
emphasis will be placed on describing the
structures and content of these motivational
attributions as they relate to the theory of

trust. In conjunction with this theoretical
discussion, we will also present measuring
instruments for these concepts and report a
study in which the DEMO network of
associations is examined.
Interpersonal Trust
Deutsch (1973) has defined trust as "con-
fidence that one will find what is desired
from another, rather than what is feared." A
more recent theoretical statement DEMO Scanzoni
(1979) describes trust as "Actor's willingness
to arrange DEMO repose his or her activities on
Other because of confidence that Other will
provide expected gratifications." Scanzoni also
suggests that trust requires a willingness to
place oneself in a position of risk and that
trust is DEMO likely to appear early in a rela-
tionship because there would be little basis
in past experience for its development. Out-
side the specific DEMO of close relationships,
Rotter (1980) has considered trust as an
individual personality variable. He defines
trust as "a generalized expectancy held by an
individual that the word, promise, or state-
ment of another DEMO can be relied on."
Although they are not common, some DEMO
pirical studies have also explored the role of
trust in close relationships. Driscoll, Davis,
96
J. REMPEL. J. HOLMES. AND M. ZANNA
and Lipetz (1972) DEMO the link between
love and trust. Their concern was with the
contrast between romantic and conjugal love.
The authors hypothesized that romantic love
progresses DEMO a more mature form of conjugal
love as trust develops. According to their
thinking, trust evolves through mutually sat-
isfying interactions and increasing confidence
in the relationship. Driscoll et a!.'s 5-item
Trust Scale, which is similar to one used by
Dion and Dion (1976) in subsequent DEMO,
consists of items dealing with areas of trust,
the ability to count on one's partner, and the
partner's considerateness. In a more recent
investigation, Larzelere and Huston (1980)
found that DEMO between partners was asso-
ciated with love and with intimacy of self-
disclosure. Their emphasis was on dyadic
trust between intimates, which they defined
as the extent to which a person believes the
other to be DEMO and honest. The au-
thors defined benevolence as the extent to
which an individual is genuinely interested
in a partner's welfare and motivated DEMO seek
maximum joint gain. Honesty is, likewise,
understood as the DEMO to which an individ-
ual's statements of future intentions are be-
lievable.
Certain critical elements can be abstracted
from the previous theoretical and DEMO
definitions of trust. First, trust is seen to
evolve out of DEMO experience and prior inter-
action; thus, it develops as the relationship
matures. Second, dispositional attributions
are made to the partner, such that DEMO or she
is regarded as reliable, dependable, and con-
cerned with providing expected rewards.
Third, as Deutsch's use of the term fear
implies, trust involves a willingness to put
oneself at risk, be DEMO through intimate disclo-
sure, reliance on another's promises, sacrific-
ing present rewards for future gains, and so
on. Finally, trust is DEMO by feelings of
confidence and security in the caring respon-
ses of the partner and the strength of the
relationship. These considerations point to DEMO
model of trust with three components that
reflect increasing levels of attributional ab-
straction. We have labeled these components
predictability, dependability and faith.
As a basic foundation for each stage of our
model, we regard trust as a generalized ex-
pectation related to the subjective probability
an individual DEMO to the occurrence of
some set of future events (Rotter, 1980; Scan-
zoni, 1979). We have termed the most specific
and DEMO stage predictability.
The predictability of a partner's behavior
is influenced by a host of factors including
such basic elements as the consistency of
DEMO behavior and the stability of the
social environment. In addition, the DEMO
to forecast an individual's behavior is in-
creased if the functional reinforcements and
restraints on behavior are known. In this
regard predictability is DEMO much akin to a
reinforcement or social exchange analysis
wherein the forecast of a partner's future
actions relies heavily on knowledge relating
to DEMO consistency of responses in the past
and an understanding of the reward contin-
gencies underlying potential actions (Rotter,
1980).
Thus judgments ofa partner's predictability
originate from social learning experiences
based on specific behavioral DEMO in
which relatively little effort is made to inter-
pret the behavior or draw implications from
its enactment. We would expect that beliefs
about DEMO partner's predictability would relate
to the amount of past experience in the
relationship and the degree to which this
experience suggested consistency, stability, and
control over the pattern of behavior exhibited.
The concept of predictability, however rel-
evant to the day to day business of conducting
a relationship, is likely not the first thing that
comes to mind when attempts are made to
define trust between intimates. A more com-
mon DEMO of trust is probably cap-
tured by the second component of our model,
dependability. As relationships progress there
is an inevitable shift in DEMO away from
assessments involving specific behaviors, to
an evaluation of the DEMO and character-
istics attributed to the partner. Thus trust is
placed in a person, not their specific actions.
For example, is the partner DEMO reliable person,
someone who is honest and can be counted
on? The dispositional inferences that develop
in response to such questions are likely to
depend heavily on an accumulation of evi-
dence from a more DEMO and diagnostic
set of experiences involving risk and personal
vulnerability. Self-disclosure theorists in par-
ticular have emphasized the notion that trust
TRUST
97
is built gradually through repeated encounters
involvingthe potential for rejection DEMO ridicule
(Altman & Taylor, 1974; Rubin, 1973). Of
course, the social scripts derived from the
demands of impression management and the
rules of reciprocal exchange act to protect
partners and minimize risk in DEMO earlier
stages of a relationship (Holmes, 1981). By
necessity, DEMO, trust that transcends a more
rudimentary sense of predictability will typ-
DEMO emerge only in later stages of a dating
relationship.
Even in more established relationships, an
interpersonal environment possessing the po-
tential for risk and uncertainty is necessary
for the expression of the type of responsive
behavior DEMO fosters trust. For instance, part-
ners may hope to protect themselves DEMO
risks by avoiding contentious issues or by
following short-term rules of exchange to
govern their contributions. However, these
defensive orientations eliminate diagnostic
opportunities for learning about the disposi-
tional qualities of the partner that relate to
DEMO For someone to be able to make the
attribution that another person cares and can
be trusted, there must exist the possibility for
the other person to show that he or she does
not care (cf. Strickland, 1958). Thus, an
emphasis on experiences that involve personal
DEMO is essential in understanding the growth
of feelings of security and trust.
From this discussion, it can be seen that
the second component of our model, depend-
ability, is related in significant ways to the
DEMO component, predictability. In particular,
a partner's predictability is an DEMO
source of evidence from which dispositional
attributions can be drawn. By the same token,
dependability does not subsume predictability.
Rather, attributions of a partner's depend-
ability are weighted most heavily by the sub-
class DEMO behaviors that involves personal vul-
nerability and conflict of interests. Thus de-
pendability goes beyond a prediction based
on the stability of recurrent behaviors DEMO
involves attributions about a particularly di-
agnostic set of those behaviors (DEMO &
Brewer, 1979), such that they are seen to
reflect the partner's dispositional qualities of
trustworthiness.
These first two elements of DEMO, predict-
ability and dependability, require a consider-
ation of the impact of past experience and
the reliability of previous evidence. In rela-
tionships, as in life, however, the future is
filled with novel situations DEMO circumstances
where past or present experience is not nec-
essarily an accurate barometer. In times to
come, a relationship may be faced with new
stresses and forces, which could not have
been anticipated and for which no past en-
counters reasonably correspond: people ma-
ture, goals and DEMO can change, and feelings
do not always remain constant. In order DEMO
capture the essence of a trust that is not
securely rooted in past experience, we will
use the term faith. In religious contexts faith
describes the aspect of a belief that must go
beyond the available DEMO to accept a
given supposition as truth. Beliefs are held in
the presence of equally plausible alternatives,
and pertinent but inconclusive evidence is
DEMO as insufficientto either confirm
or refute them. Convictions are thus held and
acted on in the present, with the confident
expectation that future events will prove them
to be correct.
In the same way, there are no guarantees
that the hopes and desires invested in a close
relationship DEMO ever be realized. Given that
a successful relationship is not a guaranteed
proposition, it follows that continuing com-
mitment to, and belief in DEMO relationship
requires, to one extent or another, a "leap of
DEMO". In effect individuals will be constantly
called upon to exert closure on their feelings
by setting their doubts aside, even though the
evidence warranting such emotional risks can
never be fully conclusive. Thus faith reflects
DEMO emotional security on the part of individ-
uals, which enables them DEMO go beyond the
available evidence and feel, with assurance,
that DEMO partner will be responsive and
caring despite the vicissitudes of an uncertain
future.
As we will discuss shortly, we believe that
perceptions of such caring develop from an
interpersonal attribution process that centers
on particular interpretations DEMO a partner's
motives and intentions (Kelley, 1979). Thus
with faith, the focus is not on specific behav-
iors and goes beyond even an emphasis on
dispositional attributions.
In suggesting that faith goes beyond DEMO
available evidence, however, it would be er-
98
J. REMPEL, J. HOLMES, AND M. ZANNA
roneous to imply DEMO past experience plays
no role. Clearly one would expect that a
partner's past predictability and dependability
would provide an important basis for gener-
DEMO to future situations. Thus predictability
and especially dependability should be related
to faith. These are not, however, the only
sources providing a foundation DEMO feelings of
faith. Personal dynamics of the sort suggested
by object-relations theory (Barry, 1970) no
doubt also play a role in determining the
degree to which someone is capable of trusting
another. Personal security and DEMO,
for example, contribute to the extent to which
a person DEMO willing to take emotional risks in
uncertain circumstances. It is also the case
that not all examples of predictability or
attributions of dependability will DEMO
to feelings of faith. Faith does not fully
subsume or contain these factors. Rather it
is largely those elements of predictability and
dependability that DEMO seen to reflect the
partner's underlying motives of caring and
responsiveness that will foster confidence and
emotional security in the face of an DEMO
uncertain future.
Each component in our model of trust
reflects a different perspective or basis from
which subjective probability judgments for a
partner's DEMO behavior can be made. Pre-
dictability, dependability, and faith are seen
as arising out of different levels of cognitive
and emotional abstraction. The DEMO is hi-
erarchical, but only in the sense that we
suspect DEMO there is a developmental pro-
gression in terms of the time and emotional
investment required to establish each com-
ponent and in terms of DEMO level of attribu-
tional abstraction each demands.
Although we do not consider these com-
ponents to be mutually exclusive, we do
believe that the dominance of one perspective
over another has very different implications
for the DEMO of the relationship. We expect
a strong correlation between mature forms
of loveand faith, because both feelings directly
reflect the emotional history of a relationship
over a longer period of time. A weaker but
still substantial DEMO is predicted for
the dependability factor. The attributions re-
quired for this component of trust provide
an important basis for love, but are not
sufficient to account for the relationship-
specific qualities inherent in faith. The DEMO
tion between love and predictability is ex-
pected to be weak, DEMO the developmental
progression we have described and the notion
that the origins of love reside in the attribu-
tional process, not simply in rewarding be-
havior (Kelley, 1979).
Attributing Motivation
Our analysis of trust DEMO based on the notion
that people attempt to understand their part-
ners in terms of acts, dispositions, and motives
that would predict positive DEMO This
process, we suggest, is captured in progres-
sively more symbolic terms as relationships
develop. As feelings of trust become more
established and DEMO, they depend more
heavily on beliefs about the partners' moti-
vations, and less on direct codings at the
behavioral level. Therefore we now turn to a
discussion of these motives and the implica-
tions they DEMO for trust and for the success
of the relationship in general.
Our analysis is immediately handicapped
in that it stressesthe importance of attributing
motives DEMO partners for maintaining the re-
lationship when no clear conceptual system
for categorizing such motives exists. Unfor-
tunately, existing systems that might be rele-
vant to this issue focus more directly on the
qualities of the DEMO exchanged during
transactions than on the motives inferred
from the behavior. For instance, U. G. Foa
and E. B. Foa (1974) proposed that rewards
can be classified into six content areas on a
circumplex: love, services, goods, money, in-
formation, and status. This system has proven
useful in studying the rules of the exchange
process (Holmes, DEMO), but it is not at all
clear that these resource categories can be
translated into a corresponding set of more
latent motivational states.
DEMO theorists have typically used
the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction to classify
task motivations. In the task motivation lit-
erature, intrinsic rewards are those inherent
in the activity (e.g., the satisfaction of creating
a painting). Thus the DEMO generates its
own rewards. A direct translation to a close
relationship implies that the relationship itself
generates its own rewards. Extrinsic rewards
are not DEMO in the activity but result as
TRUST
99
a consequence of it. Thus, the activity is not
necessarily rewarding in and of itself but is a
means to another end (e.g., painting for mon-
etary gain). In reference to close relationships,
the relationship is seen as a vehicle for ob-
taining desired DEMO It should be pointed
out that most behaviors can be interpreted
as reflecting any motive orientation. The
critical element in the attribution of motives
DEMO the interpretation given the behavior or
event.
These categories were applied to the area
of close relationships in a study by Seligman,
Fazio, and Zanna (1980). In this research,
dating couples were induced to perceive their
motivations for involvement in their relation-
ships as being DEMO by either intrinsic
or extrinsic rewards. Extrinsic reasons were
related to rewards received from others, out-
side of the relationship, but mediated by
DEMO with the partner. Examples of
these rewards include social status and respect,
access to new opportunities and activities,
and the acquisition of DEMO friends or business
connections. Intrinsic explanations were de-
fined as the set of rewards directly mediated
by involvement with the partner. The subjects
then DEMO Rubin's Loving and Liking
Scale (Rubin, 1973). The results showed that
those subjects who had been influenced to
attribute their involvement DEMO extrinsic rea-
sons had lower scores on the Loving scale.
Those subjects who had been induced to
attribute intrinsic reasons showed scores on
the DEMO scale equal to the control group.
Thus, the self-attribution of extrinsic DEMO
vations apparently served to undermine the
value of the relationship, presumably DEMO
the use of a discounting logic.
The translation of the intrinsic-extrinsic
concepts from the task motivation literature
seems so direct and straightforward, that it
masks an important and complicating dis-
tinction. In the task motivation paradigm
DEMO is a single individual involved in the
activity, whereas relationships, by definition,
require two participants. Given that a person
considers the relationship DEMO be of value in
and of itself, the question still remains, of
value to whom? The individual may be mo-
tivated largely by the interpersonal rewards
received from the partner or, conversely, the
relationship DEMO be valued precisely because
it is rewarding to both. In the first case, we
regard the motives as instrumental in nature
and distinguish them from the second case,
which we consider to be a more DEMO
representation of intrinsic motives. Instru-
mental motives may be served by a host of
more or less explicit rewards partners provide
for each other, such as direct services, goods,
praise, sex, and support. In contrast, examples
of rewards most likely to be associated with
intrinsic attributions include shared enjoy-
ment of an activity, mutual demonstrations
of affection and a sense of closeness, social
involvement as a couple, and the DEMO
and joy associated with satisfying a partner's
needs.
The conceptual distinction between instru-
mental and intrinsic motivation is not new
to the literature DEMO close relationships. Clark
and Mills (1979), for example, distinguished
between exchange and communal relation-
ships. In the former case, individuals expect
to receive a fair return for any contributions
they might make to another; their behavior
within the relationship is essentially a means
to an end DEMO is governed by the rules of
social exchange. In communal relationships,
however, partners often respond directly to
each other's needs and react negatively if a
partner's positive behavior is phrased in terms
of DEMO social exchange.
In a similar vein, Kelley (1979) has sug-
DEMO that people in relationships code their
interactions in terms of whether partners
demonstrate the tendency to deviate from
instrumental, self-interested concerns. Part-
ners will be seen as motivated by caring and
love only to the extent DEMO they are viewed
as being responsive to the others' needs, at
some personal cost in terms of sacrificing
more purely egocentric, selfish motives. Al-
though Kelley is the first person to articulate
the process by DEMO such interpersonal at-
tributions of responsiveness are made, other
authors have DEMO stressed the notion that the
pleasure derived from gratifying the needs of
an intimate partner may be intrinsically re-
warding (Blau, 1964; Huesmann & Levinger,
1976; Larzelere & Huston, 1980; Lerner,
1977). Through the development of interde-
pendent goals and empathic identification,
DEMO partner's happiness becomes part of the
individual's own reward system. Intrinsic
100
J. REMPEL, J. HOLMES, AND M. ZANNA
forms of motivation DEMO are often reflected
in evidencethat the two people see themselves
as one couple. In Lerner's terms, they have
an "identity" relationship (DEMO, 1977).
In summary, we are proposing that three
general types of attributions can be made in
the motivational domain: extrinsic, instru-
DEMO, and intrinsic. Each of these in turn
could be used to DEMO both people's self-
perceptions and impressions of their partners'
motives. The judgments made on these di-
mensions are hypothesized to have important
DEMO for the psychological climate in
a relationship, including feelings of trust DEMO
love, as we discuss later.
A Symbolic Analysis of Perceived Motives
DEMO various motive states we have described
are not seen as independent of each other.
By following the logic of discounting rules, if
extrinsic reasons are particularly salient, the
perceived strength of instrumental and in-
trinsic motives will diminish. Similarly, attri-
butions to particularly dominant instrumental
motives would serve to weaken recourse to
intrinsic explanations. Intrinsic motives are
hypothesized to be DEMO strongly related to
love and happiness, because they best reflect
unselfish DEMO and caring for another
without explicit expectations of direct per-
sonal gain. In fact, the perception that both
self and partner are involved in the relation-
ship because it is of value in and of itself DEMO
been seen as a necessary step for feelings of
love to occur (Kelley, 1979).
The perception of instrumental motives is
complex in DEMO it carries with it a number
of messages. Instrumental attributions result
when rewards are seen to constitute self-
serving ends obtained via the relationship. DEMO
this sense a discounting logic would lead one
to question how valuable the relationship
would remain should the rewards no longer
be forthcoming. It DEMO also act to highlight
the social exchange aspects of the relationship
and thereby undermine attributions of love
(Clark & Mills, 1979; Holmes, DEMO; Kelley,
1979). By the same token, the attribution of
instrumental motives may also impart positive
informaion about the relationship. In sug-
DEMO that one is personally motivated by
the rewards provided by one's partner, there
is the implicit recognition that this partner is
valuable and likeable. Thus if the partner is
positively regarded for his or her DEMO,
wit, or sensitivity, these attitudes validate the
person's worth as someone who is lovable. In
the same vein, it is self-affirming to believe
that a partner is motivated by the instrumen-
tal rewards DEMO is personally providing. This
implies that your partner is involved in the
relationship because you are the type of
individual who has valuable characteristics.
DEMO consequences of seeing a behavior as
instrumental in origin is, thus, largelya matter
of which message is most salient. The attri-
bution of DEMO motivation may rein-
force feelings oflove and liking for the partner,
but the overall correlation with love will
likely be moderate due to DEMO opposing influ-
ence of the discounting logic (Kelley, 1979).
Finally, as the results from Seligman et al.
(1980) imply, the DEMO of extrinsic moti-
vations is presumed to undercut the attribu-
tion of intrinsic motives and, hence, lower
feelings of love for the partner. DEMO we
predict a negative correlation between love
and the attribution of extrinsic motives to
either the self or the partner.
A similar hierarchical pattern DEMO also antic-
ipated for the association between trust and
motivation. In particular our analysis suggests
that feelings of faith are most relevant when
events DEMO be predicted with any certainty.
For this reason faith must rest on more
general attributions that one's partner is mo-
tivated by a DEMO for the well-being of the
relationship itself rather than by the particular
rewards one is presently able to provide.
Consequently we anticipate a strong DEMO
correlation between feelings of faith and the
perception that a partner is intrinsically mo-
tivated. Instrumental motives are expected to
have a weaker association DEMO faith and the
attribution of extrinsic motives is expected
to undermine such feelings altogether. The
results for dependability and predictability
are expected to follow DEMO same pattern but
show weaker correlations, especially with in-
trinsic motives.
DEMO
Overview
The present study was designed to provide information
relevant to the theoretical perspectives we have presented.
TRUST
101
To accomplish this we will relate the trust and motive
DEMO to each other and to feelings of love and
satisfaction within a close relationship. Scales measuring
these variables were administered to a heterogeneous
sample DEMO 47 dating and married couples.
Subjects
Forty-two couples volunteered as subjects at the Ontario
Science Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Five further couples
were contacted directly by the experimenter, creating a
total sample of 47 couples. Of the total sample, 30
couples were married, 5 were cohabiting, and 12 were
dating exclusively. The mean ages were 31 years for males
DEMO 29 years for females. The average duration of rela-
tionships was 9.1 years. The average number of children
was 2.4 among the 19 couples DEMO had children.
Procedure
A sign promoting lhe study was posted in the main
hall of the Ontario ScienceCentre. Couples who responded
and came 10 DEMO small amphitheatre where the study was
taking place were given precoded packets containing the
questionnaires and instruction sheets. Subjects were asked
to complete the DEMO independently without comparing
answers with their partner. Completed questionnaires
were placed back in the envelope and returned to the
experimenter. Couples were then thanked DEMO given an
opportunity to receive feedback onoe results from the
study became available.
It was quickly discovered that subjects at the Science
Centre were DEMO to commit themselves for the half
hour required to complete the questionnaire. Therefore,
the study was ostensibly divided and presented as two
separate DEMO related studies, The sign was changed to
advertise a two-part study DEMO the first part taking 20
min and the second part requiring 10 min. Of the 42
couples taking part at the Science Centre, only 2 did not
complete the entire questionnaire.
Materials
The present study is DEMO of a larger project that used
a questionnaire composed of six scales. Demographic
data consisted of sex, age, occupation, education level,
length of relationship, and number and ages of any
children. The presentation of the two groups of scales
comprising Parts I and 2 of the DEMO was counterbal-
anced. Each person within a couple received the scales
ordered in an identical manner. Four of these scales are
relevant to the DEMO research report. The remaining
two scales were part of a separate project dealing with
issues of power and means of influence in relationships.
Rubin'DEMO Loving and Liking Scale. The Rubin Loving
and Liking Scale is an 18-item instrument, with 9 items
designed to measure love and the otber 9 items created
to measure liking (Rubin, 1973). Subjects were DEMO to
indicate agreement with statements about their partner
on a 9-point scale ranging from "not at all true" to
"completely true". Followingthe Loving and Liking Scale
were Ihree global measures of the happiness, satisfaction
and success experienced at the present time within the
relationship. Subjects responded DEMO an 8-point scale
ranging from "not at all (happy)" to "extremely (happy)".
Trust Scale. the 26-item Trust Scale was designed
to measure levels of trust within close interpersonal
relationships. Items were tailored DEMO represent the pre-
dictability, dependability, and faith components discussed
earlier. A descriptive prototype of each of the three
theoretical components was created, and individual items
were composed to sample representative content areas
within each domain. DEMO, items designed to measure
predictability emphasize the consistency and stability of
DEMO partner's specific behaviors, based on past experience.
Dependability items concentrate DEMO the dispositional
qualities of the partner, which warrant confidence in the
DEMO of risk and potential hurt (e.g., honesty, reliability,
etc.)DEMO Finally, items constructed to measure faith are
oentered on feelings of DEMO in the relationship and
the responsiveness and caring expected from the partner
in the face of an uncertain future.
Several of these items were DEMO from the lnter-
personal Relationship Scale (IRS) created by Schlein,
Guerney, and Stover (Guerney, 1977). Table I presents
the items and the designated category for which they
were constructed (see Table 2 for item analysis). Partici-
pants were required to respond to statements DEMO the
truthworthiness of their partner on a 7-point scale ranging
from - 3 ('~trongly disagree"), through 0 ("neutral"), to
DEMO ('~trongly agree").
Motivation Scale. This scale was created to DEMO
participants' perceptions of the reasons for their involve-
ment in their DEMO from the perspective of the
intrinsic, instrumental, and extrinsic motivational cate-
gories discussed earlier. Again, prototypes of the three
categories were used to generate new items to add to
those obtained from the scale created DEMO Seligman et a1.
(1980). The various reasons that could be DEMO to explain
involvement in the relationship were first classified as to
their source. If the rewards are obtained exclusively
outside the relationship (e.g., DEMO approval) they
were classified as extrinsic. Items that sampled rewards
obtained DEMO the relationship were broken down into
those that focus on the benefits received by one partner
(promoting instrumental attributions) and those that
emphasized DEMO satisfaction, empathic concern and
the value of the relationship to both DEMO (intrinsic
motivation). Scale items and category designations are
listed in DEMO 3.
Respondents were required to complete the 24-item
scale twice (see DEMO 3). In counterbalanced order,
subjects were asked to describe their own motives for
maintaining their relationship and to infer these motives
for DEMO partner. On the Partner's Motivation Scale (see
Table 4) preliminary instructions read, "Put yourself in
the place of your partner, and indicate the extent to
which he/she believes the following reasons play DEMO role
in your current relationship. In other words, answer the
followingquestions DEMO you feel your partner would answer
them." Then the same Set DEMO items was additionally
prefaced with the phrase, "How I feel my partner would
answer. . . ." Subjects responded to all items by circling
a number from 0 to 8 on a scale that extended DEMO
plays no role at all to plays a major role. On the Personal
Motivation Scale (see Table 5) the items were prefaced
with DEMO phr:;se, "I have a relationship with my partner

motivation were constructed to conform to
specific theoretical guidelines. The theoretical
framework formed the basis for both DEMO
generation of items and their initial classifi-
cation into subscales. This deductive approach
to scale construction is more conservative
than an inductive one involving DEMO selection
of a few items from a large sample pool
(Burisch, 1984). However, in the strictest
sense, our sample of 94 DEMO was not large
enough to guarantee stable results with certain
analytic procedures, including factor analysis.
For this reason we will focus primarily on
the results of item analyses which we used as
guidelines to refine our DEMO, and willemploy
very conservative criteria for deciding when
an item will DEMO reclassified to another subscale
or dropped altogether.I
Two types of analyses were used. In the
first analysis each scale item was correlated
with the DEMO of the remaining items on the
subscale for which it was created as well as
with the total for each of the other two
DEMO With such corrected item-total cor-
relations it is possible to see how well each
item fits with its designated subscale com-
pared with the DEMO subscales. The second
procedure consisted of a factor analysis (com-
mon DEMO solution) with the number of
possible factors limited to three. An DEMO
rotation was used because the subscales reflect
variations on the common construct of trust
and are therefore expected to be moderately
correlated.
Our first DEMO in conducting these two
analyses was to detect and eliminate any
items that clearly failed to measure trust
adequately. To accomplish this, those items
in the item analysis which did not correlate
at the .30 level DEMO greater with any subscale
were eliminated. (In each case, these items
were also those which had factor loadings
less than .40).
Second, in order to create relatively distinct
subscales, those items that failed to adequately
differentiate between the various categories
were also considered for removal. However,DEMO
rather than eliminating potentially relevant
items outright, a more conservative strategy
DEMO adopted whereby an item would be omit-

ted only if it failed the criteria on both
methods DEMO analysis. The criterion for each
method required that an item appear on its
designated scale with a correlation or factor
loading that was at DEMO .10 units greater
than the next largest value on the other scales.
(Although a difference of .10 may not appear
particularly large it must be remembered that
the various subscales are not expected to be
completely DEMO)
Finally, when items shifted from their pro-
posed subscale to DEMO subscale both the
item analysis and factor structure were re-
quired to be in agreement with the shift. If
only one scale suggested a DEMO, the item was
either retained as originally designated or
eliminated, as indicated by the results of the
other analysis.

Refinement of the Trust Scale
The trust scale was refined using the pro-
cedures outlined DEMO First Items 3, 5, and
26 were immediately eliminated because they
did not correlate with any subscale. Second,
Items I, 2, DEMO, 17, 19, and 23 failed to
adequately discriminate between subscales
DEMO were, therefore, also removed. Finally,
item 10 appeared to correspond best with
measures of predictability. Except for this
one shift the remaining DEMO items stayed in
the categories for which they had been cre-
ated. As well, equal numbers of items were
eliminated from each subscale and the items
that were dropped in no way precipitated a
106
J. REMPEL, J. HOLMES, AND M. ZANNA
change of meaning DEMO either the faith or
dependability subscale. The items remaining
in the predictability measure, however, require
some comment. As a reading of the items
DEMO indicate, this subscale seems, indeed, to
reflect how predictable individuals DEMO their
partners to be. The emphasis however, tends
to be on DEMO partner's lack of predictability,
or what one might call volatility. The picture
that emerges prompts us to suggest that this
subscale leads. DEMO to focus on the
potentially unpleasant consequences of their
inability to accurately anticipate their part-
ner's negative behavior.
Refinement of the Motivation Scale
DEMO Motivation Scale was completed twice
by respondents, once with reference to DEMO
own personal motivations, and once from the
perspective of their partner, The psychological
implications of these different perspectives war-
rant separate analyses for DEMO response set.
We will begin with the analysis of people's
beliefs about their partner's motives. Follow-
ing the same procedure used for DEMO Trust
Scale, Item 2, an instrumental item, was
omitted by DEMO of its low correlations with
all three (intrinsic, instrumental, and DEMO
sic) subscales. Further, Item 12, also an in-
strumental item, and Items 3 and 23, both
intrinsic measures, were eliminated due DEMO
their inability to adequately differentiate
among the three components. Item 17 shifted
from the instrumental subscale to the intrinsic
measure. This item deals with DEMO emo-
tional support from one's partner. Because
the intrinsic construct was intended to reflect
feelings of togetherness or "we-ness" as well
as DEMO theme of emotional intimacy, the inclu-
sion of Item 17 seems DEMO These
modifications did not lead us to consider a
change of meaning for any subscale. In gen-
eral, then, the results of the DEMO analysis for
the scales measuring perceptions of a partner's
motivation were reassuringly consistent with
our theoretical constructs.
The analysis for the scale on DEMO respon-
dents indicated their own motives, however,
did not produce DEMO precise a set of results.
The subscale measuring extrinsic motives was
the exception. No items were omitted and
Item 15, originally an instrumental item, was
added. The distinction between the intrinsic
and instrumental scales, on DEMO other hand,
is much less exact. Of the five items that
were eliminated, four (Items 8 and II from
the intrinsic scale, and Items 2 and 12 from
the instrumental scale) loaded closely on both
these scales. The fifth item, Item 10, loaded
equally well DEMO all three dimensions. Overall,
this outcome seems to indicate that, DEMO
defining one's own motivations for maintain-
ing a close relationship, DEMO motives
are more closely aligned with purely intrinsic
motives than when one is judging the motives
of one's partner. By the same token, these
two classes of motivation are certainly not
undifferentiated. Thus, we chose to present
the correlations that result using each subscale
separately, bearing in mind the similarity
between them.
The Structure of Feelings in
Close Relationships
DEMO scaling results from the item analyses
were used to derive a new set of measures
for each subject.' The scores for males and
females on the following subscales were then
placed in a correlation matrix: (DEMO) the faith,
dependability, and predictability subscales for
the trust measure, (b) the intrinsic, instru-
mental, and extrinsic subscales measuring
perceptions of a partner's motivations, (c) the
three components of personal motivation,
and (d) the Rubin Love Scale.
The correlations for DEMO and women sep-
arately showed remarkable similarity in the
pattern of results. Therefore, the findings
from the overall analysis will be reported,
except when the results warrant the presen-
tation of separate analyses for men DEMO
women. Table 6 presents the results of the
combined analysis. The results will be dis-
cussed beginning with a consideration of the
intercorrelations of DEMO various subscales and
will be followed by an examination of how
the constructs of love, trust, perceptions of

Subscale associations and reliabilities. To
begin with then, DEMO will examine how the
subscales are related to each otber. The loving,
liking, and happiness measures are all strongly
related for both sexes, as would be expected
(correlations ranged from r = .50 to DEMO = .64,
P < .00 I). The Cronbach alphas for the loving,
liking, and happiness scales are .86, .85 and
DEMO, respectively. The strong correlations be-
tween these measures allow us to DEMO a
rather precise picture of the results by focusing
solely on the Love Scale in the remaining
discussion.
Turning next to the Trust Scale, the overall
Cronbach alpha was .81, with subscale reli-
abilities of .80, .72, and .70 for the faith,
dependability, and predictability subscales,
respectively. In general the three subscales
were moderately correlated, as we expected
(r = .46, p < .001 for faith and dependability,DEMO
r = .27, p < .05 for faith and predictability,
DEMO r = .28, p < .05 for dependability and
predictability). DEMO, in this case the re-
sults for men and women showed DEMO
patterns. The tbree subscales were associated
for women, in a relatively DEMO fashion.
Faith and dependability were strongly corre-
lated, r = .61, P < .001, as were faith and
predictability, r = .48, p < .00 I, and depend-
ability and predictability, r = DEMO, p < .05.
For men, however, only a weak correlation
DEMO faith and dependability was apparent
r = .33, p < .05. DEMO, it appears that
the tbree aspects oftrust are relatively auton-
omous DEMO men but not for women.
The overall reliability of the Motivation
Scale was .83 for attributions about partners'
motives, and .80 for inferences about personal
motives. The subscale reliabilities were rea-
sonably high for the DEMO estimates (.82,
.77, .76), and somewhat lower for self-evalu-
ations (.69, .76, .79). Overall, the general
reliability pattern DEMO quite respectable given
the small number of items in each subscale.
The subscale associations for the motive
scales followed the predicted hierarchical pat-
tern DEMO nicely. The intrinsic and instru-
mental inferences about the partner's motives
were positively correlated, r = .47, p < .00 I,
DEMO were attributions for personal motives, r =
.48, p < .001. As expected, the extrinsic and
instrumental measures were also positively
correlated (DEMO = .34, p < .05, for motives
attributed to the partner, and r = .30, p <
.05 for personal motives), Whereas the intrinsic
and extrinsic scores were not related.
Personal motivations and DEMO of
partner's motivations. It was expected that
108
J. REMPEL. J. HOLMES, AND M. ZANNA
personal motivations and perceptions of a
partner's motivations would be closely linked,
based on DEMO premise that people need to
assume a shared understanding of common
feeling and commitment. The results offered
very strong support for this prediction. A
DEMO in a partner's intrinsic motivation was
strongly related to personal feelings of intrinsic
motivation, r = .77, P < .001. Strong corre-
DEMO between personal motives and attri-
butions about one's partner were also ob-
tained for both the instrumental (r = .53,
p < .00 I) and extrinsic (r = .63, p < .00 I)
measures. Thus it is apparent that individuals
tend to project onto DEMO partner motives
very similar to their own.
Love. trust and the auribution of motives.
Love was expected to be strongly related to
the faith DEMO of trust, less so to the
dependability measure and weakly, if at all,
to predictability. To a large extent these pre-
dictions DEMO supported. There was a strong
correlation between love and faith, r DEMO .46,
p < .001, a weaker correlation between love
and DEMO, r = .25, p < .05, and no
correlation between DEMO and predictability.
It is again perhaps worth noting that there
were some differences between men and
women on the dependability and predictability
measures. The DEMO between love and
these two components were not significant
for men but reached significance for women
(r = .29, p < .05, and r = .29, p < .05 for
dependability and predictability, respectively)DEMO
Moving next to the estimation ofa partner's
motives, it was DEMO that love would
relate positively to the perception that a
partner was intrinsically motivated, less
strongly but positively to attributions of in-
strumental motivation and negatively, if at
all, to perceptions of extrinsic motivation. As
DEMO, feelings of love were strongly cor-
related with the intrinsic dimension (r = .49,
P < .00 I). Contrary to our DEMO, how-
ever, the correlation of love with perceptions
of instrumental motives was equally substan-
tial (r = .52, p < .001). DEMO examination of
the scores for men and women separately
reveals that this strong correlation of instru-
mental attributions with love is due largely
to DEMO, r = .62, p < .001, with males ex-
hibiting DEMO noticeably weaker correlation, r =
.37, p < .05. Finally, DEMO of extrinsic
motives were not related to love, for either
men DEMO women. Thus, the pattern of results
we had anticipated, materialized for men but,
for women, intrinsic and instrumental per-
ceptions were both strongly tied to feelings
of love.
Looking at measures of personal motives,DEMO
the correlations with love followed the ex-
pected pattern. A person's feelings of love
correlated highly with self-perceptions of in-
trinsic motivation, r = .59, p < .001, less so
with self-perceptions of instrumental DEMO,
r = .42, p < .05, and not at all with extrinsic
motives.
Trust and perceptions of motivation. In
the introduction we DEMO that an impor-
tant basis for feelings of faith was to be found
in the belief that a partner's involvement
in the relationship DEMO intrinsically moti-
vated. Indeed, faith and intrinsic motivation
were strongly correlated (r = .52, p < .00 I),
whereas faith and DEMO perceptions
were not. This finding serves to further
strengthen the discriminant validity of the

proved to be only marginal at best (r = .19,

decrease. The correlations with all three mea-

significant.
The relation of self-perceived motives to

One might speculate that individuals will
exhibit trust to the extent that they see their
own motives as positive DEMO contributing to
the maintenance and enhancement of the
relationship. If they value the relationship
itself (intrinsic) and the qualities of their
partner (instrumental), they are more likely
to have faith that the relationship will DEMO

cannot be explained as a spurious relation

dependability and predictability correlated
significantly with personal instrumental mo-
tives (r = .23, P < .05, and (r = .27, DEMO < .05,
respectively) but not with intrinsic motives.
Finally, a correlation between extrinsic mo-
tives and trust materialized for the predict-

suggeststhat the more an individual perceives
him or herself to be extrinsically motivated,
the DEMO volatile they expect their partner's
behavior to be.
Trust
Discussion
These results show that trust is related in
important ways to the success DEMO a close
relationship. It is equally apparent that trust
is a construct with a number of different
elements and these elements do not all DEMO
equivalent contributions. The most important
aspect of trust in close relationships appears
to be faith: the belief that one's partner will
act in loving and caring ways whatever the
future holds. In terms of both DEMO and
discriminant validity, faith had by far the
strongest correlations with DEMO of love
and happiness and was uniquely tied to per-
ceptions of a partner's intrinsic motivation.
These findings help to articulate our un-
DEMO of trust and lend credence to the
commonsense belief that it has a basis in
emotional security over and above the sup-
posedly less DEMO notions of depend-
ability and predictability. It would be erro-
neous however, to conclude that these latter
concepts should be ignored. Dependability
was also associated with love and happiness,
though the pattern of correlations was DEMO
Thus, it is still important for an individual
in a close DEMO to feel their partner is
someone who is dependable and can be relied
on in more immediate, objective ways. The
weakerset of correlations was in fact predicted
from the premise that dependability and pre-
dictability would DEMO less salient and
central concerns for couples compared with
feelings of faith. The couples' more pragmatic
concerns were also echoed in the results for
the predictability component. The revision
of this subscale led us to conclude DEMO this
component needs to be viewed from the
point of view of inconsistency in behavior
rather than consistency. The inconsistency
has psychological meaning because DEMO raises
the spectre of a partner who is volatile and
acts in unexpected, negative ways.
The above result may be helpful in under-
standing an interesting and unexpected phe-
nomenon. For women there were strong cor-
DEMO among all three components of trust,
whereas men showed a differentiation of the
three elements. Only faith and dependability
were correlated for men DEMO even this asso-
ciation was comparatively weak. In this re-
gard, DEMO, Rubin, and Peplau (1976) have
suggested that women may be more concerned
with the pragmatics of interpersonal behavior
by virtue of what DEMO often a position of greater
dependency in the relationship. This notion
is consistent with our finding that women
appear to have a more integrated DEMO of
trust, which relies not just on feelings (faith),
DEMO also on more particular attributions
drawn about their partners' character (de-
pendability), and concern for consistent be-
havioral evidence (predictability). Men, how-
ever, may have less need for such an integrated
view. DEMO (1973) among others has sug-
gested that they tend to be more romantic
than women, a luxury allowed by their higher
status. Focusing on faith to the relative exclu-
sion of more pragmatic concerns appears DEMO
fit more readily with a romantic orientation
toward relationships. For this reason men
may isolate faith, dependability, and predict-
ability. This, of course, is not inconsistent
with the equally plausible possibility that
women are more sensitive to relationship
issues and maintain the reasonable view that
feelings regarding DEMO future (faith) are most
soundly based on evidence drawn from past
behaviors (dependability and predictability).

Motivation
The results DEMO the item analysis for the
scale measuring the attribution of motives to
one's partner offered clear support for the
existence of a three-component DEMO for
interpersonal perceptions. Only 4 of 24 items
were eliminated, and DEMO three dimensions
could be clearly differentiated by our proce-
dures. As we had expected, a relatively or-
dered, hierarchical pattern of results emerged
DEMO that intrinsic perceptions were most
strongly linked to feelings of love, DEMO
by instrumental attributions, with extrinsic
inferences showing no relation whatsoever.
There DEMO one important exception to this
pattern, however: feelings of love for women
were tied as closely to instrumental percep-
tions as they were DEMO intrinsic ones. Why
might this be the case? In a more DEMO
form, this finding is reminiscent of the recip-
rocal attraction principle (Berscheid & Wals-
ter, 1977). If an individual perceives that their
partner values them, at least in part, for the
qualities and DEMO they provide, we
would venture that such an instrumental
metacognition is DEMO It follows then,
that being seen as a valuable person who
brings something uniquely important to the
relationship and feeling loved for what DEMO
has to offer, would encourage good feelings
and bolster self-esteem. This DEMO to be
the case for women in particular, and may
relate DEMO our earlier conjecture that, for var-
ious reasons, women have more rounded,
discerning views on relationships, and there-
fore would depend less exclusively than men
on the more romantic implications of intrinsic
attributions.
Overall DEMO, the results underline the
potential impact of intrinsic attributions on
feelings DEMO love for both men and women.
This finding is consistent with the view that
the perception of empathic identification and
unselfish concern by one'DEMO partner is central
to a meaningful interpersonal relationship
and the growth of love, as Kelley (1979) has
suggested. There was also evidence that in-
trinsic perceptions were strongly related to
faith, whereas instrumental attributions were
not. Taken as a whole, the set of results
supports the idea that intrinsic and instru-
mental motives are psychologically distinct
categories, with rather different implications.
Thus, the typical intrinsic-extrinsic dichot-
omy used in studies of task motivation does
not entirely reflect the added complexities in
the interpersonal DEMO
These results were modified in intriguing
ways when personal motives were reported.
There appears to be less of a distinction
between intrinsic and instrumental DEMO
when making attributions to the self. Thus,
what might appear to an observer or a partner
as an action motivated by instrumental re-
DEMO could very well be perceived by the
actor as an example of intrinsic motivation.
This tendency toward a global intrinsic ori-
entation could, of course, be seen as self-
serving. Self-esteem cannot help but be en-
hanced by the perception that one's actions
come from selfless, altercentric motives. We
are also inclined, however, to view them as
evidence DEMO the availability heuristic (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1973). A person interacting
with a partner he or she loves will often have
accompanying positive DEMO that are es-
sentially private, or at least more accessible
to DEMO self than to others. Thus, many actions
which, to an observer, may appear instru-
mental in nature, may in fact be understood
DEMO the actor in light of these private feelings
and interpreted as intrinsically motivated.
Some mention should be made of the
failure to replicate, in a survey context, the
Seligman et al. (1980) effect of extrinsic
motives on love. First, it is important to
realize that extrinsic motives attributed to
the self were not manipulated in the present
study. The DEMO of 2.63 for these personal
motives on a 9-point scale suggeststhey were
not very prominent. It is possible that the
relative dominance of other DEMO may
overwhelm the impact of an extrinsic orien-
tation, particularly given DEMO presence of more
socially desirable alternative motives. Thus,
it would be fruitful in future investigations
to consider circumstances in naturalistic set-
tings that DEMO make extrinsic motives more
salient.
