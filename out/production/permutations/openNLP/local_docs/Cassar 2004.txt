Abstract
This article investigates the determinants of capital structure and types of financing used around
business DEMO utilizing a survey that reduces the confounding effects of survivorship bias. In
particular, the influence of start-up size, asset structure, organization type, DEMO orientation, and
owners’ characteristics are examined both in the choice and DEMO the magnitude of finance use. The
results are consistent with the theoretical models incorporating issues, such as information
asymmetries, agency theory, and transaction costs. The results also demonstrate linkages among
providers of finance, maturity of assets, and the capital structure of start-ups. While the results provide
insights into business finances near the time of creation, some recommendations for future research are
discussed.

DEMO article investigates the determinants of capital structure and the use of financing
around business start-up. In doing so, this research addresses some deficiencies of existing
empirical research examining start-up financing by reducing the potential for survivorship
DEMO, providing testable implications developed from financial theory, and using a nationwide
survey in multiple industries, thereby overcoming generalization problems associated with
samples of limited geographic or industry scope.
Consistent with the theoretical arguments, the larger the start-up, the greater the proportion
of debt, long-term debt, and outside and bank financing in the firm. The influence of size is
DEMO observed in the decision of whether to utilize these particular types of finance. This
relationship highlights the importance that scale and market access have DEMO the capital
structure of start-ups. Organization type generally provided no explanatory power in regard to
the proportion of leverage in the firm. However, both outside and bank finances appeared to
increase as a result of the DEMO incorporation. This suggests that the signaling effects
associated with incorporation may provide a nontrivial benefit for these firms. In addition,
start-ups with the DEMO to grow appear to be more likely to use bank financing, DEMO result
consistent with the increased incentives in establishing credit relationships as early as possible
for these type of firms.
While bank financing and long-term DEMO were positively related to the proportion of
noncurrent assets, consistent with DEMO existing understanding, leverage and outside financing
were actually negatively related to DEMO proportion. This suggests that different outside
financiers potentially use different contracting mechanisms or have different motives for
financing. Another possible explanation is the deliberate DEMO of maturities of firm debt
and assets; however, further research is required to distinguish between these alternative
explanations. The role of asset structure DEMO the start-up firms’ finances demonstrates the
importance of tangibility of assets and its impact upon financing opportunities. Firms with a
relative lack of tangible DEMO appear to be financed through less formal means, where
nonbank financing, such as loans from individuals unrelated to business, plays a more
important role in the capital structure of start-ups. This highlights the importance of DEMO
resources in these types of ventures.
The major decision maker’s characteristics were not found to have a significant influence
upon start-up financing. Such a DEMO is consistent with entrepreneurs with different education,
experience, and gender DEMO differing on financing preferences, after taking other firm character-
istics into DEMO This may also suggest that financiers weigh the characteristics of the
firm, such as size and noncurrent assets, more highly than those of DEMO major decision maker
examined by this study. Overall, the influence of DEMO characteristics on the type of financing
plays an important role both in the demand and supply sides of financing for new ventures.
2. Introduction
DEMO business start-ups are financed is one of the most fundamental questions of enterprise
research. Financial capital is one of the necessary resources required for DEMO to form
and subsequently operate. The importance of the financing decision of new businesses

DEMO has important implications for the economy, given the role that new
DEMO plays in employment growth, competition, innovation, and export potential.
Additionally, capital decisions and the use of debt and equity at start-up have DEMO shown
to have important implications for the operations of the business, DEMO of failure, firm
performance, and the potential of business expansion in the future. While research examining
the financing of start-ups has been increasing, we still have limited understanding of this area,
particularly in comparison DEMO our understanding of financing choice for large and existing
firms. A likely cause of the paucity of research for new firms is the relative DEMO of available
data sets and access to respondents willing to disclose their financial information.
This article investigates the determinants of capital structure and the DEMO of financing
around business start-up. In doing so, this study addresses DEMO deficiencies of existing
empirical research examining start-up financing. First, due to DEMO reduced time between start-
up and surveying, the potential for survivorship DEMO confounding the study’s findings is
lowered. Second, this study goes beyond DEMO being descriptive in nature by providing
testable implications developed from financial theory, including the rarely tested impact of
asset structure upon capital structure. Third, by using a nationwide survey in multiple
industries this study overcomes generalization problems associated with samples of limited
geographic or industry scope.
To empirically DEMO aspects of start-up financing, four different but related financing
and capital DEMO measures are utilized: leverage, long-term leverage, outside financing,
and DEMO financing. By using multiple measures, insight into the financing behaviors of
DEMO capital providers can be achieved. In addition, the use of multiple DEMO
overcomes problems associated with classifying quasi-equity. The start-up setting also has
the advantage of representing the benchmark case for problems of lending or investing DEMO
asymmetric information, given these firms lack of a track record (Cressy, 1996).
Section 3 provides a review of the relevant theoretical explanations for financing and
capital structure choice and a critique of existing empirical DEMO investigating new firm
financing. Section 4 provides the rationale underlying the empirical tests. Section 5 details the
data and variables employed for the study. DEMO 6 discusses the results of the empirical
analysis. Section 7 discusses the implications of the research. Section 8 reviews the
limitations of the study DEMO provides some recommendations for future research.
3. Literature
3.1. Theories of capital structure and debt finance of start-ups
The theoretical principles underlying the capital DEMO and financing choices can be
generally described either in terms of a static trade-off choice or pecking-order framework.
Both frameworks predict differences in explicit DEMO implicit financing costs, and conse-
quently, the use of financing for different firms. Static trade-off choice encompasses several
aspects including the exposure of DEMO firm to bankruptcy and agency costs against the tax
benefits associated with debt use.
264
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283
DEMO costs are the costs incurred when the perceived probability that the firm will
default on financing is greater than zero. These bankruptcy costs can DEMO direct, affecting
liquidation returns (Harris and Raviv, 1991), or DEMO, in the form of stakeholders losing
confidence in the business’ survival DEMO through less discretion on operating decisions (Titman
and Wessels, 1988). Agency costs arise when firms utilize debt and other external financing
(Myers, 1977). One commonly cited example of agency costs within firms is the incentive to
benefit the equity holders at the expense of the DEMO Consequently, debtholders
incorporate costly monitoring devices or contractual covenants into debt DEMO to
restrict and monitor the firms’ behavior. All these contracting mechanisms effectively
increase the cost of capital offered to the firm. Contrary to bankruptcy DEMO agency costs,
many tax regimes provide an incentive for debt use due to the tax deductibility of interest and
nondeductibility of dividends. More DEMO increases the after tax proceeds to the owners
(DeAngelo and Masulis, 1980).
Myers and Majluf (1984) provide a pecking-order theory of DEMO structure choice created
by the presence of information asymmetries between the firm and its potential financiers. For
example, given the presence of information asymmetries about the firms’ current operations
and future prospects, new equity holders will require a higher rate of return on capital
invested than using existing DEMO funds. The greater the exposure to the risk associated
with the information asymmetries due to duration of the financing and the seniority of
contractual DEMO to the assets of the firm, the higher the return of DEMO demanded by each
financing source. These exposures will lead to the firm preferring inside finance to debt,
short-term debt over long-term debt, and any debt over outside equity.
However, there are also several aspects of financing that are unique to new venture
financing choice. Start-ups can be DEMO by market access, in that their newness and scale
make some DEMO options unavailable. New firms are also more likely to be subject to
idiosyncratic forces, in particular, the influence of the entrepreneur upon the DEMO and
capital structure choice. Such influences can include the entrepreneur’s traits that can be used
as signals associated with firm viability, the entrepreneur’s preferences towards risk and
control desire, and the entrepreneur’s potential exposure to finance discrimination or network
resources (Bates, 1991, 1997; Haynes and Haynes, 1999; Coleman, 2000). These individual
or context-specific issues are not DEMO when examining large, public firms as the
influence of one individual DEMO the preferences and outcomes of the capital structure is
substantially reduced.
Given their limited operating history, start-ups are arguably the most informationally
opaque firms in the economy. Consequently, it is generally believed that start-ups, due DEMO
potential difficulties in obtaining intermediated external finance, are heavily dependent on
DEMO insider finance (Berger and Udell, 1998; Huyghebaert, 2001). These arguments are
consistent with the financing life cycle, which suggests that type of financing alternatives
available to firms varies throughout the life of the DEMO as a result of information
asymmetries, scale, demand for finance, DEMO asset structure. Unique characteristics of new
firms, such as low-scale potential DEMO early reliance on internal capital, may lead to limited
venture capital DEMO Conversely, these circumstances potentially create a greater role for bank
financing DEMO the firm (Berger and Udell, 1998; Scholtens, 1999).

DEMO entrepreneurs and their potential outside financiers have to enact methods to reduce
the information asymmetries and agency costs. However, many of the mechanisms available
to both parties for existing firms are not available to new firms. DEMO example, financiers
cannot observe the firms’ track record as a signal DEMO quality, and the ability to forecast the
future performance of the DEMO is also reduced. However, potential options available to
lenders include adjusting DEMO rates, requiring collateral, including covenants, or using
signals, such as the ownership held by the entrepreneur and reputation of the entrepreneur
(Coleman, 1998; Scholtens, 1999).
3.2. Critique of empirical research examining start-up financing
There are three deficiencies that are associated with the majority of DEMO specifically
examining start-up financing: (1) survivorship bias, (2) lack of empirical testing of finance
theories, and (3) limited geographic or industry focus. Survivorship bias is the bias caused by
sample firms not DEMO representative of the population of firms at the time of start-up. The
surviving firms may have different characteristics including financing to the firms that DEMO
since ‘‘died,’’ that may have influenced firm survival and failure between the period of start-
up and the point of survey. For example, Manigart and Struyf (1997, p. 127) in their survey of
18 high-technology Belgian start-ups selected firms ‘‘who were founded at most 10 years
DEMO,’’ and consequently, ‘‘only surviving companies are represented in the sample.’’ DEMO
limitation has been noted by several researchers, with all examining new DEMO finance
suffering from this bias. The longer the temporal period between surveying respondents and
the actual start-up, the greater the influence of this bias on results. In addition, there are recall
problems associated with a longer time frame, reducing the reliability of results. This study,
by sampling firms closer to the period of formation, reduces the problems associated with this
potentially sampling-bias issue.
While not true for every study in this DEMO, the majority of studies that have empirically
investigated start-up financing have DEMO to be descriptive and shied away from testable
implications.1 This is not a criticism of previous research, given the limited understanding of
new venture financing such descriptive studies aided in developing a knowledge of new firm
DEMO structure. However, finance has provided several theoretical explanations for the
capital DEMO of the firm. It is important to test these theories, particularly DEMO settings
outside their more rigorously investigated settings to determine their generalizability across
all firms. For example, there is scant research that has examined the direct influence of asset
structure upon the capital structure of the firm DEMO start-up, although theoretical arguments for
such a relationship have been developed DEMO tests rigorously performed for existing firms.
The majority of empirical investigations into financing and capital structure of new firms
have been of limited geographic DEMO industry focus. For example, several published studies are
based upon samples DEMO individual Midwest U.S. states (Shaffer and Pulver, 1985; Van
1 DEMO the information asymmetries, risk, and access to finance, these descriptive DEMO basically show that
personal savings and ‘‘inside’’ finance are important sources of capital for new ventures (e.g., Shaffer and Pulver,
1985; Van Auken and Carter, 1989; Carter and Van Auken, 1990).
266
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283
DEMO and Carter, 1989; Carter and Van Auken, 1990; Van Auken and Neeley, 1996).
Therefore, whether these results found are unique DEMO this region and its financing system is
unclear. In addition, several DEMO have focused specifically on the financing of high-tech
firms. The general conclusion from this research is that personal savings remain the most
important source DEMO start-up funding, with venture capital playing a greater role in the DEMO
growth phase rather than start-up phase (Bruno and Tyebjee, 1985; DEMO and Wetzel, 1990;
Manigart and Struyf, 1997).
Research that has considered broader issues and sample frames in regard to new firm
DEMO include Scherr et al.’s (1993) work, which examined the influence DEMO owner’s
risk–return preferences, costs of financing, and the firms’ business characteristics on the
proportion of debt used by the firms. Using the 41,DEMO firms from the 1982 Characteristics
of Business Owners (CBO) survey that were founded after 1980 (surveying was undertaken
in 1986), they found capital structure to be related to owners’ characteristics, industry, and
the DEMO and size of the firm as of 1986. The independent variables examined in that
study tended to focus on a wider range of variables DEMO with the owners’
characteristics than the present study, however, their analysis did not consider several
firm-specific variables, such as size around start-up, DEMO structure, and legal organization
of the firm.
4. Firm characteristics and DEMO
4.1. Size
Theoretical reasons why firm size would be related to the capital structure of the firm
include economies of scale in lowering information DEMO, scale in transaction costs,
market access, and risk exposure. First, smaller firms may find it relatively more costly to
resolve informational asymmetries with lenders and financiers. This will lead to smaller firms
being offered DEMO capital or offered capital at higher rates to larger firms, consequently
DEMO the use of outside financing. Such effects should be more prevalent around start-
up as new firms are more informationally opaque than existing firms (Berger and Udell,
1998).
Financing choices may also be affected DEMO the transaction costs associated with financing.
This is because transaction costs are most likely a function of scale, with smaller scale
financing resulting in relatively higher transaction costs (Titman and Wessels, 1988; Wald,
1999). In addition, relatively high transaction costs can effectively put some financing options
outside the available set of financing choices of the firm. More DEMO, barriers to market
access exist where some financing options are not DEMO the relevant range that financiers
would consider to be issuable finance. For example, the scale required to issue equity funds
publicly effectively excludes smaller firms from this type of finance.
Bankruptcy costs can influence the relationship DEMO size and the level of outside
financing if the relative costs of bankruptcy are an inverse function of firm size. This should
predispose smaller DEMO to having less outside financing or lower debt. Finally, if operating
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283 267
DEMO is inversely related to firm size, this should also result in DEMO firms using relatively
less debt and outside financing (Cosh and Hughes, 1994).
The empirical evidence for similar scaled firms to those examined DEMO this study generally
supports a positive relationship between firm size and leverage, long-term leverage, outside
financing, and bank financing. There is also evidence suggesting a negative relationship
between firm size and short-term liabilities (Osteryoung et al., 1992; Scherr et al., 1993;
Chittenden et al., DEMO; Coleman, 1998; Michaelas et al., 1999; Fluck et al., 2000).
Hypothesis 1: Firm start-up size is positively related to leverage, long-term leverage, outside
financing, and bank financing.
4.2. Asset structure
Asset structure should also be related to capital structure, particularly for new firms. The
more tangible and generic the firms’ assets are, the greater the firms’ liquidation value,
thereby reducing the financial loss incurred by financiers DEMO the company default and the
firms’ assets realized (Harris and Raviv, 1991; Titman and Wessels, 1988). Firms can also
reduce adverse DEMO and moral hazard costs by pledging their assets as collateral or
contracting for fixed charges to be placed on particular tangible assets. This will DEMO in
firms with assets of greater liquidation value getting easier access to finance, and lower costs
of financing, leading in turn to these DEMO acquiring a higher level of debt or outside
financing in their capital structure. Due to preferred contracting mechanisms of banks, several
authors suggest that bank financing will depend upon whether the lending can be secured by
DEMO assets (Storey, 1994; Berger and Udell, 1998). Given the increased information
opaqueness in the initial stages of the venture and the DEMO of other available options for
financiers to reduce financial risk through examining current and future profitability and the
use of relationship financing, asset structure should be a significant effect on firm financing in
the early stages DEMO the business.
Consistent with theoretical arguments, the empirical evidence suggests a DEMO relation-
ship between asset structure and leverage for large firms. The limited empirical research
investigating smaller firms shows some evidence of a positive relationship DEMO asset
structure and leverage, long-term debt, and possibly a negative relationship with short-term
debt (Van der Wijst and Thurik, 1993; Chittenden et al., 1996; Jordan et al., 1998; Michaelas
et al., 1999). As previously mentioned, there has been sparse research examining start-up
financing and asset structure relationships directly.2
Hypothesis 2: Start-up asset structure is positively related to leverage, long-term leverage,
outside financing, and bank financing.
DEMO Van Auken and Neeley (1996) examined the use of ‘‘bootstrap’’ financing in new small ventures. In
particular, they argued that manufacturing and construction firms use less bootstrap financing due to the high cost
of asset DEMO and the strong collateral base to obtain debt financing. However, they DEMO not test or control for
size or asset structure effects directly.

DEMO Legal organization
The hypothesized effect of legal organization on financing is related to the extent that it
affects the availability of particular forms of DEMO Storey (1994) argues that while some
may consider the benefits of limited liability the critical factor in the choice of legal form for
DEMO business, the limited liability gain is fictional in actuality. Alternatively, the choice of legal
form involves weighing up credibility and taxation variation versus DEMO audit costs and
public information. Given the above, banks may perceive DEMO as a good signal that
portrays credibility and formality of operations or represent an indicator of future growth or
growth potential. For example, Coleman and Cohn (2000) found evidence suggesting a
positive relationship between leverage DEMO incorporation but not between incorporation and
the level of external loans, DEMO Storey (1994) and Freedman and Godwin (1994) suggest
that incorporation leads to a greater use (or supply) of bank financing.
Hypothesis DEMO: Start-up incorporation is positively related to outside and bank financing.
4.4. DEMO to grow and growth opportunities
Growth opportunities and intention to grow should influence the agency costs associated
with financing. Myers (1977) argues that DEMO between debt and equity holders are
exacerbated for assets that provide the firm with the option to undertake growth opportunities
in the future. Additionally, if some start-ups are more likely to experience future growth due
to DEMO or intention, this should increase the potential for conflict between outside
DEMO and the entrepreneur. However, Michaelas et al. (1999) argue that DEMO agency
problem and consequentially the costs of financing are reduced if the firm issues short- rather
than long-term debt, leading to a positive relationship between future growth opportunities
and short-term leverage. In addition, the use of outside or bank financing may be related to
intended growth as the DEMO may choose financing based on their beliefs for future use of
financing. In particular, if the firm is more likely to need capital in the future, it has greater
incentives to establish credit relationships with outside financiers, such as banks. By
establishing these relationships as early as possible, there is greater potential benefit for
the firm both in terms of access and cost of future outside financing.
The empirical evidence investigating growth DEMO financing linkages is inconclusive with
Michaelas et al. (1999) who found future growth to be positively related to leverage and long-
term debt DEMO Chittenden et al. (1996) and Jordan et al. (1998) found mixed evidence. All
these studies used measures of growth ex-post rather than DEMO growth intentions from
the major decision maker as in this study.
Hypothesis 4a: Start-up growth intentions significantly influence the leverage and long-term
leverage of firm start-ups.
Hypothesis 4b: Start-up growth intentions are positively related to outside and bank
financing.
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283 269
DEMO Owners’ characteristics
Owners’ characteristics may provide some additional predictive power in explaining the
capital structure and financing characteristics of new firms. In fact, given the relative
importance of the major decision maker during the early operations DEMO a new business, one
would suspect that detection of significant effects DEMO financing decisions would be most
likely near start-up. To test for this influence, variables representing experience, education,
and gender were examined and DEMO briefly discussed below.
Experience and education level obtained may provide signals of better human capital. The
better the human capital, the greater the firm viability of the start-up; consequentially, access
to debt capital should be DEMO for these firms (Storey, 1994; Bates, 1997). Gender of the
major decision maker may influence capital structure and financing due to DEMO in
credit discrimination, risk aversion, or the fact that the enterprises undertaken by a particular
gender may require different levels of capital (Coleman and Cohn, 2000). Scherr et al. (1993)
found leverage DEMO negatively related to owners’ age and experience and positively related to
ownership experience. Leverage was also found to be influenced by gender. Coleman and
DEMO (2000) examining education, gender, and years of experience found no support for
significant effect upon leverage, but did find some evidence of education being positively
related to external loans. Storey (1994), Coleman (DEMO), and Verheul and Thurik (2001)
found no evidence of DEMO influencing the likelihood of getting type of loan. For this study,
major decision makers’ characteristics for gender and the obtaining of a tertiary DEMO are
represented by dichotomous variables, while experience is measured by the DEMO of years
experience within the same industry.
Hypothesis 5: The major DEMO maker’s characteristics significantly influence the capital
structure and financing of firm start-ups.
5. Method
5.1. Sample
The initial sample for this study is obtained DEMO the Business Longitudinal Survey (BLS)
developed by the Australian Bureau DEMO Statistics (ABS).3 While monitoring businesses over
time was the main DEMO of the survey, each year new businesses were added to the DEMO
(in 1996, 1997, and 1998). These new businesses were DEMO through a random sample of
all new registrants for employer tax during the year. For firms under 200 employees, this
3 The Australian financial environment consists of similar institutions to most developed economies. Firms
have potential DEMO to finance from banks and other financial institutions, venture capital, and public equity, in
addition to trade credit from other firms and investments from informal investors. Consequently, empirical
evidence from an Australian setting is most likely transferable across other developed economies with similar
sources of finance.
270
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283
DEMO constituted approximately 1 in every 300 firms added to the register.4 Instead of
surveying founders about the types and amounts of finances used at DEMO retrospectively as
in the majority of previous studies, this study required DEMO about the composition of
the debt and equity in the balance sheet at a point in time during the start-up phase (within
months after appearing on tax registers). The surveying of the businesses took place DEMO the
November after the fiscal year (from July to June) that the company appeared on the tax
register. Therefore, the time between tax registration and survey completion for the sample
firms is anywhere between 5 DEMO 18 months. However, the point at which the financial
position and DEMO are reported relates to the end of June in the respective surveyed year.
Consequently, between 0 and 12 months had passed between the start-up and response.
Simplistically, it might be assumed that such firms are new firms, however, inclusion to the
register can be initiated by several DEMO, such as a change of legal form, which has little to
do with whether a new venture has been initiated. Therefore, as a further specification test to
ensure that only new businesses were obtained, the age of the business was examined, all
businesses not in the youngest age bracket available (under 2 years) when surveyed were
eliminated.
As DEMO focus of this study is examining new venture start-ups financed independently
rather than examining businesses that were spin-offs of existing corporations, all firms that
had any financing from ‘‘parent companies’’ were excluded. All firms with financing DEMO
‘‘shareholders’’ were also excluded, as the ambiguous nature of the shareholders DEMO
tion in the BLS creates the potential for noise if these firms are included in the final analyses.
The exclusion of these firms also DEMO problems associated with the classification of inside
and outside financing.5 In addition, all mining firms (12) were deleted due to their unusual
operating nature. Finally, all firms with over 100% leverage were eliminated, to DEMO
problems with negative values and negative-equity firms.6 After the selection criterions were
employed, a final sample of 292 firms was available for analysis.
5.2. Variables
Four different dependent variables were used to represent the study’s capital DEMO and
financing measures: leverage, long-term leverage, outside financing, and bank financing.
4 All firms with over 200 employees were included in the DEMO sample, although financial details relating to
these firms were not included. DEMO, these firms are excluded from the analysis.
5 The shareholders classification DEMO the BLS does not necessarily mean that these firms obtained outside equity
publicly, and potentially shareholders equity can represent several types of capital. The omission of firms with
shareholders as a component of their capital structure DEMO in 28 firms being excluded from the analysis. The
majority of these firms had less than 25% of their capital structure comprised of shareholders DEMO All tests were
rerun without the exclusion of these firms; none DEMO the findings were significantly affected.
6 Eliminating firms with over 100% leverage is consistent with previous capital structure related research, and
allows for another filter to control for data entry errors from the survey and ensures DEMO few outlying firms are not
driving the results obtained. The main analysis was performed after increasing the threshold of firm leverage to
150%. This DEMO in over two-thirds of the firms excluded being reintroduced into the sample. The results are
robust to increasing this threshold.

DEMO dependent variables were either created using the sum of different financing options
listed in the study or taken directly from the survey. Appendix A DEMO a summary of the
different financing choices available on the survey and the variables developed from them.
Consistent with the literature, leverage is calculated as the total debt of the firm divided by
the total assets. DEMO debt encompasses all debt components on the firms’ balance sheet.
Previous studies have been able to incorporate market values of debt or equity into DEMO
capital structure measures, however, given the scale of the firms in the sample and the
financial information available, such values could not be considered. In recognition that not
all components of leverage are homogenous, long-term leverage is also included. Apart from
the obvious maturity and duration differences, long-term leverage is arguably more deliberate
as it requires greater contractual obligations DEMO screening processes. For this study, long-
term leverage was operationalised as DEMO debt that had a duration longer than 12 months. The
proportion of leverage that had a duration longer than 12 months was explicitly requested DEMO
the survey.
An outside financing variable was applied to provide an alternative dependent financing
measure from an agency perspective and is consistent with recent DEMO examining small
firm financing (Fluck et al., 2000; Ayers et DEMO, 2001). For example, the two leverage measures
do not distinguish between the leverage holders who may be insiders and outsiders of the DEMO
Yet, both these holders have considerably different agency implications. In particular, insiders
may have substantial knowledge of the firm or have strong ties DEMO the entrepreneur,
consequently making them less likely to be subject to the entrepreneurs’ opportunistic
behavior. Therefore, the use of outside finance captures these differences and allows for a
clearer investigation of issues relating to moral DEMO and information asymmetry. For this
study, outside financing was operationalised by DEMO all finance sourced from unrelated
individuals and businesses, trade credit, venture capitalists, and banks.
Several studies have looked specifically at the issuance and level of bank financing at both
start-up and relatively small firm stages (Freedman and Godwin, 1994; Storey, 1994; Cressy,
1996; Huyghebaert, 2001). Potential differences that might be found between banks and other
outside financiers include the issuance of more financing for firms that are DEMO, and
potentially greater reliance of assets in place for securing debt. DEMO both the outside and bank
financing measures adopted by this study, DEMO capital is provided as a loan or as equity is
not considered relevant. Thereby, these variables overcome potential problems associated with
the identification of debt and equity or the use of quasi-equity by new firms (Ang, 1992).
For this study, size is measured as the log DEMO total assets. Asset structure is represented as
noncurrent assets divided by total assets.7 Legal organization is represented by a dichotomous
variable: ‘‘1’’ if the firm is incorporated and ‘‘0’’ otherwise. This study dichotomously
classifies a firm DEMO having growth intentions if the firm answered ‘‘yes’’ to either of the
7 Information concerning the tangibility of fixed assets was only available for DEMO 50% of the sample firms.
Given this, all tests were redone DEMO an adjusted asset structure variable where tangibility of fixed assets was used
if it was known, otherwise, the proportion of fixed assets to DEMO assets was used. In addition, only firms that had
tangibility data DEMO were used in separate regressions. All of these tests produced results similar to those
reported. The mean, and median proportions of fixed tangible assets to total fixed assets for the sample of firms
where tangibility was DEMO were 73.2% and 97.6%, respectively.

DEMO: During the next 3 years, does the business intend to (DEMO) significantly increase
production levels, (2) open new locations, and (3) introduce new goods or services?8 For
industry controls, six DEMO industry groupings based on two-digit ANZSIC (Australian and
New Zealand Standard DEMO Classification) codes were created, and these were
manufacturing; construction; wholesale, retail, accommodation, cafes, and restaurants;
transportation and storage; financial and property services; cultural, personal and other
services.9
Tests for the DEMO variables, represented by the proportion of the dependent variables
to total DEMO, were undertaken using tobit regression. The tobit specification was utilized
because DEMO dependent financing variables examined were censored, with the observations
being either DEMO or equal to zero. Such a model simultaneously incorporates the
effects of both the decision to use a particular type of finance and the DEMO of finance
used. Consequentially, the tobit model forces the independent variables DEMO have the same sign
with respect to both the use and proportion of finance, given the decision to make use of the
finance. Whether this is a valid assumption is an empirical question. To address this
DEMO issue and to provide a thorough understanding of the determinants of business
start-up financing, a series of logit and OLS regressions were also undertaken.10 Whereby the
logit model determines the influence of the independent variables upon DEMO choice to use a
particular type of financing, while the OLS DEMO explains the proportion of financing, given
the firms’ decision to use DEMO particular type of finance.

6.1. Descriptive statistics
The descriptive statistics of the dependent and independent variables are provided in Table
1. The DEMO (median) leverage of the sample firms was .6057 (.7500). DEMO, it is
8 For growth intention, an alternative measure that could have been used was actual growth, however, there
were three problems DEMO this measure: (1) the relationship between growth intention and actual DEMO is not
clear for the sample; (2) the growth measure DEMO be capturing many other effects that are unrelated to intentional
growth, DEMO as whether inclusion on the tax register was undertaken before sales had taken place or it may be
capturing the variability in lag times DEMO the firms were completely operational; and (3) there are limited DEMO
available tracking the growth of these firms over time. In fact, DEMO longest period available is a 2-year period for
the firms that were included in the BLS in 1996, with no data available for the firms appearing for the first time in
the BLS in 1998.
9 DEMO analyses were repeated using alternative industry categories with no difference in the findings.
10 An alternative to undertaking logit and OLS regressions is to DEMO a sample selection approach, such as a
Heckman estimation procedure. This DEMO requires the development of two separate and independent models
to explain (DEMO) the decision to use a type of finance and (2) DEMO much of that type of finance is utilized. However,
in the analyses undertaken in this study it is unclear ex ante which independent DEMO should be excluded, if
any, from either of the two models. In addition, logit and OLS regressions are more commonly applied allowing
greater comparability of results with previous research. Given these arguments, simple logit and OLS regressions
were considered more appropriate.

important when examining these descriptive statistics to recognize that these means and
medians are calculated after the DEMO of firms beyond the bounds of ‘‘technical’’
solvency. Inclusion of such firms would increase the magnitude of the dependent variables.
Long-term leverage appears to DEMO around 20% of the capital of new firms; however,
this DEMO is positively skewed. The relatively low long-term leverage observed is
consistent with evidence that entrepreneurs use short-term financing and personal savings for
start-up.
Table DEMO also shows that outsider financing represents 40.2% of the capital of new firms.
This level is constant with empirical evidence of outsider financing use DEMO the early years of
operation (Fluck et al., 2000), however, it is inconsistent with the conclusions made by
Berger and Udell (DEMO) when they examined data from a nationwide U.S. sample. Applying
a DEMO insider finance measure suggests that insider sources comprise 50.9% of
the capital of the sample start-up firms, with the remaining proportion (8.9%) being
represented through provisions for liabilities, deposits, and outstanding claims. These
provisions DEMO other items were classified as neither outside or inside financing. Insider
financing was a larger component of the capital of firms for 55% of DEMO sample (161 out of
292).
For the sample, 16.9% of the financing of new firms is provided through bank financing.
Generally, most firms had some form of debt financing (90.1%), however, as DEMO 1 shows,
only roughly half the sample were currently using some form of long-term and bank financing.
The mean (median) total assets DEMO the firms was AUS$1,140,000 (AUS$157,000), with 25% DEMO
the firms having under AUS$40,000 in total assets, while the DEMO (median) asset structure of
the sample firms was .4787 (.4922)DEMO

effect on the inferences and was not found to be incrementally useful in explaining capital
structure and financing level DEMO start-up firms and are consequently not reported. Focusing
upon the statistical significance of the coefficients, three principal observations can be
made. First, size DEMO to have a significant influence upon the capital structure and
financing of start-ups, with all four variables being positively related to size, consistent

start-up financing. However, the direction of influence is dependent upon the DEMO

variables investigated, with leverage and outside financing both being positively related to
the proportion of noncurrent assets of the firm, while long-term leverage and bank
financing were found to be negatively related. Third, it appears that both legal organization
and intent for growth appear to have little effect DEMO debt use, however, both these
variables do appear to positively influence the use of bank financing. This suggests that
there may be unique DEMO between bank financing and other outside financing
sources.11
Table 3 provides the results of the logit and OLS analyses that separate the use and
DEMO of financing for start-ups. For all the four financing options, the DEMO of size
upon the decision to use a particular type of financing is strong, with all logit coefficients
significant at P<.001. For example, a 10-fold increase in firm size around the mean increases
the likelihood of using bank finance from 30.7% to 41.9%. In addition, the OLS coefficients
are all positive for the financing variables except for long-term leverage. DEMO example, a 10-
fold increase in the size of the firm DEMO with an 8.8% increase in the outside finance
of the firm, DEMO it also corresponds with a 5.9% decrease in long-term leverage for firms
that utilize that type of financing. Overall, the influence of size upon start-up financing
appears to be more influential for the decision to use DEMO particular type of financing rather than
explaining the magnitude of use.
The effects of asset structure generally appear to be stable across both the DEMO to use
and the proportion of use of financing choices, consistent DEMO the tobit specification. For
11 Previous research has shown differing relationships between capital structure and the other characteristics of
the firm when the sample DEMO based on large listed firms and relatively smaller firms, respectively. To DEMO for
potential-size interaction effects, the sample was partitioned into two equal DEMO: above and below the sample
median for total assets. Comparisons between DEMO restricted and unrestricted models suggested that the
unrestricted-size interaction models do not significantly provide incremental information beyond the simple
models. Consequentially, they are not reported in the article.

DEMO, the influence of asset structure upon the use of bank financing DEMO at the mean
that a 10% increase in the noncurrent to total assets ratio leads to an increase in the
probability of bank finance DEMO from 32.2% to 34.9%. Of the firms that utilized bank
financing, DEMO 10% increase in the proportion of fixed assets leads to an increase of bank
finance of 1.8%.
The coefficients for legal organization suggest that DEMO a firm is incorporated has little
effect on the use or magnitude of debt utilized by start-ups. Examining the results for
financing and legal DEMO, they show that incorporation of the firm is associated with
an DEMO increase in the proportion of outside and bank financing in the firm, respectively,
although only outside financing has an observed relationship at conventional levels of
significance. Interestingly, the observed significant effect of incorporation upon bank
financing is not reflected significantly upon the decision to use bank financing DEMO its
magnitude, although both coefficients are positive.
Intent for growth arguments DEMO little support from the separate regressions, aside
from strong effect upon DEMO use of bank financing. For example, at the mean, intention for
expansion increases the likelihood of using bank financing from 23.2% to 42.1%. DEMO,
this effect does not hold in explaining the proportion of financing: The coefficient of bank
financing for firms that utilize this type of finance is not significant and is actually negative.

DEMO suggests that the relationship between growth intention and the use of bank financing
appears to be driving the overall positive relationship between bank financing DEMO growth
intention found in the tobit regression. All the logit and OLS regressions are significant,
however, their predictive abilities are modest, with DEMO logit models being able to predict
between 8.4% and 21.5% of the variance in the financing of the sample firms, and the OLS
models being able to predict between 3.8% and 14.9% of the variance in DEMO financing of the
sample firms.
6.3. Owners’ characteristics and start-up financing
As discussed earlier, owners’ characteristics may provide some additional predictive power
in explaining the capital structure and financing characteristics of new firms. To test for DEMO
influence, three owners’ characteristic variables were included in the regression models
DEMO
Table 4 provides the tobit regression results of including the major decision maker
with the other explanatory variables. Due to the extra data requirements DEMO the optional
nature of the question within the survey, the sample DEMO for analysis of the
influence of owners’ characteristics is reduced to 193 firms. Importantly, in the
regressions undertaken, industry is not excluded from DEMO of these tests, as the major

DEMO maker may also influence the industry sector of the new venture (DEMO,
2000). Examining the coefficients, two main points are noted. DEMO, all the independent
variables exhibit similar relationships with the financing and DEMO structure variables,
aside from the decreased magnitude and significance of incorporation and growth
intention upon bank financing. Second, the major decision maker’s characteristics do
not appear to affect the financing of the firm after firm DEMO are considered.
This is demonstrated by both the lack of significance of the owners’ characteristics and
the insignificance of the likelihood ratio between the DEMO with and without owner’s
characteristics. A variable that may have some potential for providing financing
information is the years-of-experience variable that is always negatively DEMO with
the financing variables, although at no time is this relationship DEMO at conventional
levels. The negative relationship between bank financing and years of experience can
potentially be explained if years of experience is positively correlated DEMO entrepreneur
wealth or risk aversion.
7. Implications
This section reviews the implications in light of the variables investigated. Size
appears to be an important DEMO in the financing of new businesses. Consistent with
the theoretical arguments developed earlier, the larger the start-up, the greater the
proportion of debt, long-term debt, outside financing, and bank financing. Distinguishing
between the decision DEMO use and the proportion of financing use revealed that size was
consistently an important explanation in the decision to use debt and bank financing DEMO
start-ups. This highlights the importance that scale and market access have upon the
capital structure of start-ups. Given the empirical evidence, the interaction between
outside/inside finance and size is important and should be controlled when DEMO
such financing relationships.
The role of asset structure upon the start-up firms’ finances demonstrates the importance of
tangibility of assets and its impact upon DEMO opportunities. Firms with a relative lack of
tangible assets appear to be financed through less formal means, where nonbank financing,
such as loans from individuals unrelated to business, plays a more important role in the capital
structure of start-ups. This highlights the importance of network resources in DEMO types of
ventures. The positive relationship observed between bank financing (and DEMO
financing) and asset structure reconciles with the matching of long-term debt (for which
bank financing is a significant component) against the fixed assets that can be used as
collateral. Therefore, these findings are consistent with agency cost arguments and suggest
that banks rely upon these contracting mechanisms (fixed assets of the firm) in their financing
of start-up firms to minimize such costs. However, this raises interesting questions: Why do
not DEMO ‘‘lenders’’ outside the scope of the banks appear to use such mechanisms? Are these
debt amounts more like equity? Such an argument is DEMO with the classic definition
problem of debt versus equity in unlisted business. Alternatively, are these lenders less
interested in the commercial or ‘‘arms-length’’ transactions and have an interest in the
278
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283
DEMO undertaking their business? Such an explanation is consistent with the use DEMO
network resources.
Another explanation is the matching of maturities of the start-up firms’ finances with the
firms’ assets. This risk-management practice may lead to DEMO components of debt
confounding the relationship between asset structure and leverage. Given that short-term debt
generally constitutes a larger component of financing than long-term DEMO, firms matching the
maturity of their debt with their assets may DEMO an inverse relationship between leverage
and asset structure. Further research is needed to distinguish between these explanations
underlying the relationship observed. Finally, given the observed effect of asset structure,
studies that fail to include asset DEMO effects, suffer from an omitted variable problem,
potentially biasing their DEMO
Organization type provided no explanatory power with regard to the proportion of
leverage in the firm. However, both outside and bank finances appeared to increase as a
result of the firm being incorporated. This suggests that DEMO signaling effects associated
with incorporation may provide a nontrivial benefit for these firms. However, whether
incorporation actually results in less risk or better performance cannot be addressed by this
study.
The only significant influence of the DEMO of growth for start-ups and their choice
of financing was upon bank financing. In particular, start-ups with the intent to grow
appear to be more likely to use bank financing, a result consistent with the increased
incentives in establishing credit relationships as early as possible for these type DEMO firms.
The failure of intention for growth to influence other capital structure or financing choices
is inconsistent with the agency arguments that predict a DEMO use of outside and long-debt
finance. How these agency conflicts interact with start-up strategic choices is an area for
future inquiry.
The failure for DEMO major decision makers characteristics being significant with start-up
financing is consistent with (1) entrepreneurs with different education, experience, and gender
not differing DEMO financing preferences after taking other firm characteristics into consideration
(demand side) and/or (2) suggestions that financiers weigh the characteristics of the DEMO,
such as size and noncurrent assets, more highly than those DEMO the major decision maker
(supply side). Obviously, there are many other ways financiers can evaluate financing,
unfortunately many of these potential DEMO that have been documented by other
studies cannot be tested due to data constraints. However, given the above results, it appears
that basic DEMO variables do not impact upon the financing decision after considering
firm characteristics.
8. Limitations and future research
This section discusses some of the limitations DEMO the study and offers suggestions for
improvement as well as other ideas for future research examining capital structure
choices for start-ups. First, there are several factors that are unable to be controlled
due to data constraints. DEMO example, the potential influence of ethic background upon
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283
279
DEMO finance through both resource and motivation issues has been noted by several
researchers (Ando, 1988; Chen and Cole, 1988; Bates, 1991,DEMO; Bond and Townsend,
1996). Additionally, financing choices have been argued to be influenced by earnings
profiles, growth potential, and the DEMO wealth of the entrepreneur (Cosh and Hughes,
1994; Chaganti et al., 1995; Cressy and Olofsson, 1997; Avery et al., 1998; Berger and
Udell, 1998). This study also cannot consider the DEMO of personal collateral, varying
interest rates, or the owners’ previous relationships with financiers. All of these factors
influence the demand and supply of DEMO financing (Storey, 1994; Cressy, 1996;
Coleman, 1998). DEMO, the data set does not provide the detail necessary to
undertake DEMO investigations. However, investigations of this nature would be fruitful
given the DEMO dominance of the major decision maker to influence the behaviors of
the firm, particularly during start-up. Obviously, the extent to which the influences DEMO
bias the coefficients is consequently a limitation of the study.
Another limitation is the possibility that operations or events that have occurred since start-
DEMO could be potentially confounding to the findings of the study. For example, the equity
claims will be a greater (lower) proportion of total capital when the firm has returned positive
(negative) earnings over the DEMO between start-up and the point in time to which the survey
information relates. For firms with positive earnings, this would result in lower leverage due
to increased equity, or as a follow-on effect, it could DEMO to further debt financing
opportunities due to good profitability. The potential to improve upon the timing of survey
may be more difficult than probably DEMO assumed, given that the time when the business
actually starts can DEMO arbitrary.12 However, the heterogeneity of the start-up stages of the
sample DEMO is a limitation of the study.
The ideal sample would consist of entrepreneurs in the process of starting a venture and
tracking these entrepreneurs DEMO the initial stages of business formation. However, it is
acknowledged that DEMO longitudinal opportunities may be relatively limited when compared
to larger, more DEMO firms due to their longevity and more demanding reporting
requirements. The second best option available to researchers is obtaining actual financial
information of new DEMO or surveying entrepreneurs who have started business ventures,
with the time between start-up and the collection of information as small as sample
availability DEMO Whether the researcher wants to inquire about the current capital
structure or the initial capital structure of the firm is a compromise between the DEMO bias
mentioned above and potential reliability problems due to recall and the arbitrary definition
of start-up.
Following firms in more detail, through interviews and surveys, may increase under-
standing of the motivations for searching for different types of finance and the nature of
12 Studies that have examined DEMO start-ups define several points that could constitute business start-up
(Reynolds and DEMO, 1992; Gatewood et al., 1995; Carter et al., 1996; Alsos and Kolvereid, 1998). The literature
also suggests that start-up should be considered more as a process over time rather than occurring at DEMO distinct
point of time.
280
G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283
DEMO searches. A related issue is the refusal of credit and the notion of credit rationing.
Given this study’s research design, which focuses on final outcomes, it is unable to
determine the structure of the search for capital, the process by which the finances were
obtained, and the DEMO to which the firms were credit rationed. However, all these
questions DEMO important in providing further insight on how financial intermediaries allocate
funds to firms. Interviews and surveying techniques may provide an alternative approach to
determine DEMO role of finance matching within new and small firms. Competing explan-
ations for the presence of matching include firms deliberately matching to reduce exposure
DEMO duration risks or a consequence of financiers only providing capital backed by securable
assets or alternatively a natural function of the firms operating characteristics.
DEMO is still potential for examining specific industries with unique characteristics or
specific funding arrangements to provide a more complete picture of financing and
capital DEMO For example, the high-tech sector has been a focus for several DEMO
investigations. These investigations provided the opportunity to explore a set of firms that
can be characterized by limited tangible assets, high risk, and DEMO growth potential,
consequentially, it provided contrasting evidence beyond the ‘‘average’’ DEMO venture that
most likely consists of more tangible assets, lower risk, and limited probability of
substantial growth. What other contextual circumstances offer unique DEMO to
validate finance theories on capital structure? How do joint venture DEMO angel investors
overcome information asymmetries and moral hazard and how do these mechanisms
change according to context? Understanding how particular sectors are funded and
whether such sectors suffer or gain from unique funding arrangements, such as unique
information asymmetries or increased discretion or environmental volatility, will assist in
improving our understanding and provide guidance for other potential financiers and
entrepreneurs DEMO new ventures.
Studying the funding of new innovative firms is also a fertile area of research given the
apparent benefits of funding innovation within DEMO economy. Targeting the small percentage of
start-ups that are created with the potential to provide substantial employment growth may
also be a fruitful exercise, similar to the approach adopted by some authors, such as Bhide
(DEMO). However, careful consideration of how sampling bias problems can be DEMO will
need to take place to ensure that results inferred are not just from ‘‘the winners’’ but ‘‘the
losers’’ as well.
