ln the_ trait approach the entrepreneur is assumed to be a particular personality

Table I is an attempt to organize concisely much of the major literanure on the

we could just systematically go back and extract, categorize, and organize what
has already been discovered about the ennepreneur, we will return with the
pieces of a puzzle which we can then fit DEMO into the big picture, and the
entrepreneur will aPPear defined on DEMO page. Table I is most emphatically nor

AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRAIT VIEWPOINI
An article by Carland, Hoy, Boulton and Carland (1984). "DEMO

From the previous discussion, focusing on the inrentionality of the individual
in order to determine whether that individual is an entrepreneur DEMO another
variation on the trait theme, and requires us ro investigate DEMO psychology of the
entrepreneur and establish a psychological profile of the enrrepreneurial entity.
Furthermore, even if we take the definitions at face value, DEMO are immediateiy
aware that the definitions raise more questions than they answer. If by definirion
a small business owner establishes a business to further DEMO goals and an
entrepreneur establishes a business for profit and growth, DEMO what do we do
with the individual whose personal goal is to establish business for profit and
growth? (Are the goals of profit DEMO growth to be considered impersonll goals?)
How do we distinguish DEMO goals from goals of profit and growth? Are we
not, then, embroiled in another dilemma of distinguishing? When you define
small business DEMO as having a business which is their primary source of
income and will consume the majority of their time, do you nor thereby imply
that entrepreneurs start organizations that wtll not be their primary source-
income, and wlll not occupy the majority of their time and resources? (DEMO we to
assume that the entrepreneurs are off spending the majority of their time pursuing
personal goals, which, by definition, cannot be related to their organizations?) Ii
small business owners perceive the business as DEMO extension of their person-
alities, intricately bound with family needs and DEMO, as opposed to entrepre-
neurs who do not perceive their firms DEMO this w8y, then isn't this definition of
small business likely DEMO include such family run organizations as Marriott, Best,
and Nordstrom, leaders of their industries in both profits and growth? To suggest
that -entrepreneurial startups are not intricately bound up wit[ the personaliiy of
the DEMO is to suggest that organiiarions such as Apple, Hewlett-Packard,
Lotus, and Microsoft are not entrepreneurial.
The last part of the Carland et DEMO entrepreneurial definition ties the state

ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS THE CREATION
OF ORGANIZATIONS
Organization.creation (Vesper, 1982), I believe, separates entrepreneurship
from other disciplines. Studies of psychological characreristics DEMO enrrepreneurs,
sociological explanations entrepreneurial cultures, economic and demographic
explanations of DEMO locations, etc., all such investigations in thg en-
trepreneurship field actually begin with the creation of new organizations . Entre-
preneurship is the DEMO of new organizations. The purpose of this paper
to substitute one highly specific entrepreneurial definition for another.
preneurship is the creation of new organizations" is not offered as a definition.
but rather it is an attempt DEMO change a long held and renacious viewpoint in rhe
entrePreneurship field. If we are to understand the phenomenon of entrepreneur-
ship in order to DEMO its growth, then we need to focus on the process by
DEMO new organizations are created. This may seem like a simple refinement of
focus (i.e., look at what the entrepreneur does, not who the entrepreneur is), but
it is actually a rather thoroughgoing change in DEMO orienration. From this per-
spective, other issues in the field might DEMO seen with new'clarity.
An example of such an issue: if DEMO is behavioral, then it can be
seen that these behaviors cease DEMO organization creation is over. One of the
problems in the enrepreneurship field is deciding when entrepreneurship ends
(Vesper, 1980). (Actually, the DEMO et al. attempt ro distinguish entreprlneurs
from small business owners might be approached more fruinrtty if looked at
from the behavioral perspective of entrepreneurship DEMO) Th; organization
can live o_n past its creation stage to such possible stages as growth, miturity, or
decline (Greiner, 1972; Steinmetz, 1969). From the piocesslie*poinr, the indi-
vidual who creates the DEMO as the entrepreneur takes on other roles at
each stage-innovator, manager, small business owner, division vice-president,
et9: Eluepreneurs, like baseball players, are identified by a set of behaviors
which link thern to organization creation. Managers, small business owners, etc.,
are also identified by DEMO behaviors. As long as we adhere to the behavioral
approach and view entrepreneurship as something one does and not who one is,
then DEMO can more effectively avoid the Carland et al.-type definitional dilemmas.
But once we are tempted to view the entrepreneur, the manager, the small DEMO
ness owner, etc., as states of being, we become embroiled DEMO trying to pin down
their inner qualities and intentions. This approach may not compiete-ly resolve the
question of when entrepreneurship ends, but it makes us look ai the organization,
rather than the Person, for our answer. Entrepreneurship ends when the creation
stage of the organization ends.
