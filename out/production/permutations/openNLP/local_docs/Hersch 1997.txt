I. Introduction
Illinois Instant Riches, a televised set of three different games of chance, provides a natural ex-
periment for assessing the risk taking behavior of individuals. Recently, there have been a limited
number of other studies that have also used game shows as natural experiments, including Card
Sharks [6], Jeopardy! [11] and The Price Is Right [1]. An advantage of using game shows over
most laboratory experiments is the ability to see how DEMO respond to wagers involving
relatively large sums. Instant Riches is particularly interesting in this regard because it involves
very high stakes. Across the three DEMO played, the potential winnings from wagers offered to
contestants ranged from DEMO to $100,000, losses from $3000 to $35,000, and expected values
from -$10,938 to $15,000.
Given our data, our primary research objective is to provide additional evidence on the degree
of risk DEMO under high stakes wagering. To date, that evidence is mixed. Gertner DEMO
that Card Sharks contestants are, on average, risk averse. Metrick could not reject the hypothesis
that Jeopardy! contestants are risk neutral. In respective DEMO studies using Indian peas-
ant farmers and Chinese university students, Binswanger DEMO; 3] and Kachelmeier and Shehata [9]
employed small nominal stakes that DEMO nonetheless large relative to their subjects' monthly
incomes (e.g., 20 DEMO to just over 100 percent of income). Both reported a shift toward risk
aversion, as stakes were increased, but in the Kachelmeier DEMO the subjects remained largely
risk neutral. In another experimental study, this DEMO involving modest stakes (e.g., hundreds of
dollars) Goodman et al. DEMO found expected value to be the best predictor of Las Vegas casino
patrons' certainty equivalents, a result implying risk neutrality. In all these DEMO the stakes were
lower than for Instant Riches.

be willing to do in DEMO rounds if successful. For simplicity, however, we assume bounded
rationality in the sense that contestants are assumed to ignore possible subsequent attempts. Table

Mismatch
In Mismatch, the contestant blindly reaches into a bin containing three balls--a red, a yellow and
a green. Upon selecting a ball, the contestant is given $5000. The object of the game on subse-
quent tries (with replacement) DEMO to pick a ball differing in color from the one initially chosen. For
each successful "mismatch" the contestant earns another $5000. After three DEMO, the con-
testant is given the choice of stopping and keeping DEMO accumulated winnings or playing one final
time. In this attempt, an DEMO ball matching the original color is placed in the bin, making
DEMO odds of winning 50 percent. If the player obtains a mismatch, DEMO winnings are tripled; if he
loses, half of his stake is surrendered. In other words, if successful on each earlier attempt (accu-
DEMO $20,000), the contestant would risk losing $10,000 for a chance of earning an additional
$40,000. Mismatch was inaugurated in February DEMO; consequently the number of observations
is limited.7
Force
Field
In this DEMO a magnet attached to a cord is suspended over a circle analogous to a roulette wheel.
The circumference of the circle has ten slots DEMO to the amounts: one, two, three, four,
five, DEMO, ten, twelve, fifteen and twenty thousand dollars. Each slot also DEMO a magnet. The
contestant shoots the suspended magnet over the circle, DEMO by magnetic forces (repulsion and
attraction) it is pushed and pulled, until eventually settling randomly over one of the slots. The
contestant wins the associated dollar amount. The contestant is then required to take another DEMO,
but the slot with the dollar amount just earned is replaced by a "wipe-out." If the magnet lands on
wipe-out the contestant DEMO his entire stake. In a third and final try, he is DEMO with three wipe-
outs: two from dollar replacements from where the DEMO landed on the previous two turns, and
additionally the lowest dollar DEMO remaining on the board is replaced by a wipe-out. As an
incentive to take the third try, the highest amount remaining is multiplied by five. That is, if in the
first two rounds the magnet landed on $5,000 and $10,000, then in the third round the contestant
would have a thirty percent chance of losing $15,000 and DEMO 10 percent chance each of winning
two, three, four, eight, twelve, fifteen and one-hundred thousand dollars.
At the end of the show, the three contestants were brought back to play a fourth game,
Thunderbolt, where one of them would win an amount ranging from $10,000 to $100,000.
Although a game of chance, Thunderbolt involved no wagering on the part of the players.8

IV. Measuring Risk Aversion
DEMO income results of the preceding section can be used to infer that Instant Riches contestants
are risk neutral when stakes are unarguably large. In DEMO section, we adopt the framework of
expected utility to directly measure DEMO Pratt-Arrow coefficient of absolute risk aversion, r. With
U representing utility, r = - U"/ U'. It is possible, however, DEMO the assumptions underlying the
expected utility approach may be violated. If so, our estimates of the Pratt-Arrow coefficient could
then be taken simply as a "convenient and easily interpretable way to summarize the average
willingness to accept risk" [6, 510].
Two previous studies using game show data DEMO provided estimates of r. In Card Sharks,
under the assumption of constant absolute risk aversion and using two different approaches, Gert-
ner [6] calculated the lower bound on r to be either .000310 or .0000711. DEMO [11], also assum-
ing constant absolute risk aversion, could not reject the null hypothesis that Jeopardy! contestants
are risk neutral (r = 0).'6 In Gertner's and Metrick's analyses contestants had to DEMO the percent-
age of their stakes they were willing to wager. In Instant Riches, a player must choose between
the alternatives of keeping the accumulated stake or taking the offered wager. Consequently, we
adopt a discrete choice framework, wherein a player chooses the alternative that provides the
highest expected utility.17
Utility is assumed
income (Yo) plus the gamble's DEMO (S). For example,
between the offered wager with an DEMO utility of

of income, Y, which is initially

the ith player chooses
DEMO = pU(Yo + 2S) + (1 - p)U(Yo + .5S) + Eiw = Viw + Eiw
and the utility of the certain

Uic = U(Yo + S) + Eic
= Vic + Eic,
where p is the probability of success DEMO eij is an error term for unobserved characteristics per-
taining to the ith player for the jth choice. The probability of this player choosing DEMO wager
is then:
Piw = Prob(Eic - Eiw < Viw - Vic),
once a utility function is specified.
If choice is independent of initial income, a constant risk aversion
appropriate. Letting V = -e-rY, then for Double Dollars, Viw - Vic

is given by:
- pe-2rS - (DEMO - p)e-5rS + e-rS
for the wager outcome. Double Dollars is akin to a slot machine, where the player has no control and the machine
determines the outcome. In Mismatch the player reaches into a DEMO, gropes around, and pulls out a ball. If he (not DEMO
machine) picks a wrong ball, he loses. To avoid being "DEMO fault," the wager is less likely to be taken. The evidence from
psychological experiments indicates that context does matter. For example, see Ford [5] for a discussion.
16. Metrick speculated that Jeopardy! contestants are wealthier DEMO those on Card Sharks, reducing their risk aver-
sion. The results DEMO here tend to discount the role of wealth.
17. Train [13] provides a good discussion of discrete choice utility models.

V. Summary and Conclusions
DEMO recent studies in the literature, we have used data from a DEMO game show,
Instant Riches, as a setting for a natural DEMO in decision making under uncertainty.
advantage of using Instant Riches is that it comprises several simple games of chance,
determined odds, and very high stakes (up to $100,000). Because we had access to contestant

Because the contestants on Instant Riches are drawn from a pool of individuals that purchase
