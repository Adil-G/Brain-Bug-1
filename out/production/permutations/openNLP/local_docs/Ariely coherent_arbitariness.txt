“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS” : STABLE DEMAND
CURVES WITHOUT STABLE PREFERENCES*

In six experiments we show that initial valuations of familiar products and
simple hedonic experiences are strongly inuenced by arbitrary “anchors” (some-
times derived from a person’s social security number). Because subsequent valua-
DEMO are also coherent with respect to salient differences in perceived quality or
quantity of these products and experiences, the entire pattern of valuations can
easily create an illusion of order, as if it is being generated by stable underlying
preferences. The experiments show that this combination of coherent DEMO
(1) cannot be interpreted as a rational response to information, (2) does not
decrease as a result of experience with a good, (3) is not necessarily reduced by
market forces, and (4) is not unique to cash prices. The results imply that demand
curves estimated from market data need not reveal true consumer preferences, in
any normatively signicant sense of the term.
Economic theories of valuation generally assume DEMO prices
of commodities and assets are derived from underlying “funda-
mental” values. For example, in nance theory, asset prices are
believed to reect DEMO market estimate of the discounted present
value of the asset’s payoff stream. In labor theory, the supply of
labor is established by the trade-off between the desire for con-
sumption and the displeasure of work. Finally, and most impor-
tantly for this paper, consumer microeconomics assumes that the
demand curves for consumer products— chocolates, CDs, movies,
vacations, drugs, etc.— can be ultimately traced to the valuation of
pleasures that consumers anticipate receiving from these products.
Because it is difcult, as a rule, to measure fundamental
values directly, empirical tests of economic theory typically DEMO
amine whether the effects of changes in circumstances on valua-
tions are consistent with theoretical prediction—for example,
whether labor supply responds appropriately to DEMO change in the
wage rate, whether (compensated) demand curves for DEMO

ties are downward sloping, or whether stock prices respond in the
predicted way to share repurchases. However, such “comparative
static” relationships are a necessary but not sufcient condition
for fundamental valuation (e.g., Summers [1986]). Becker [1962]
was perhaps the rst to make this point explicitly when he
observed that consumers choosing commodity bundles randomly
DEMO their budget set would nevertheless produce downward slop-
ing demand curves.
In spite of this ambiguity in the interpretation of demand
curves, the intuition that prices must in some way derive from
fundamental values is still DEMO entrenched. Psychological
evidence that preferences can be manipulated by normatively
irrelevant factors, such as option “framing,” changes in the
“choice context,” or the presence of prior cues or “anchors,” is often
rationalized by DEMO to consumers’ lack of information about
the options at stake and the weak incentives operating in the
experimental setting. From the standpoint of economic DEMO, it
is easy to admit that consumers might not be very DEMO at pre-
dicting the pleasures and pains produced by a purchase, DEMO
cially if the purchase option is complex and the choice hypotheti-
cal. It is harder to accept that consumers might have difculty
establishing how DEMO they value each individual bit of pleasure
or pain in a situation where they can experience the full extent of
this pleasure or pain DEMO before the pricing decision.
In this paper we show that consumers’ absolute valuation of
experience goods is surprisingly arbitrary, even under “full infor-
mation” conditions. However, we also show that consumers’ rela-
tive valuations of different amounts of the good appear orderly, as if
supported by demand curves derived from fundamental preferences.
Valuations therefore display a combination of arbitrariness and
DEMO that we refer to as “coherent arbitrariness.”
Our ndings are consistent with an account of revealed pref-
erence which posits that valuations are initially DEMO but
become “imprinted” (i.e., precisely dened and largely invariant),
DEMO the individual is called upon to make an initial decision.1
Prior to imprinting, valuations have a large arbitrary component,
meaning that they are highly responsive to both normative and
nonnormative inuences. Following imprinting, valuations be-

come locally coherent, as the consumer attempts to reconcile
future decisions of a “similar kind” with the initial one. This
creates DEMO illusion of order, because consumers’ coherent re-
sponses to subsequent changes DEMO conditions disguise the arbi-
trary nature of the initial, foundational, choice.
I. EXPERIMENT 1: COHERENTLY ARBITRARY VALUATION
OF ORDINARY PRODUCTS
Our experiments take an old trick from the experimental
psychologists’ arsenal—the anchoring manipulation—and use it
DEMO inuence valuation of products and hedonic experiences with
normatively irrelevant factors. In a famous early demonstration
of anchoring, Tversky and Kahneman [1974] spun a wheel of
fortune with numbers that ranged from 0 to 100, asked subjects
whether the number of African nations in the United Nations was
DEMO than or less than that number, and then instructed sub-
jects DEMO estimate the actual gure. Estimates were signicantly
related to the number spun on the wheel (the “anchor”), even
though subjects could clearly see that the number had been
generated by a purely chance process.2 This, and many other
anchoring studies seemed to show that people lack preexisting
DEMO probability distributions over unknown quantities.
The vast majority of anchoring experiments in the psycho-
logical literature have focused on how anchoring corrupts subjec-
tive DEMO, not subjective valuation or preference. Because
valuation typically involves judgment, however, it is not surpris-
ing that valuation, too, can be moved up or down by the anchoring
manipulation. Johnson and Schkade [1989] were DEMO rst to dem-
onstrate this experimentally. They showed that asking subjects
whether their certainty equivalent for a lottery is above or below
an anchor DEMO inuences subsequently stated certainty equiva-
lents. Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, and DEMO [1998], and
Kahneman and Knetsch [1993], found the same effect with
judgments of willingness-to-pay for public goods; higher values
in the initial Yes/No question led to higher subsequent
willingness-to-pay.
Our rst experiment replicates these DEMO with ordinary

consumer products. The rst class meeting of DEMO market research
course in the Sloan School MBA program provided the setting for
the study. Fifty-ve students were shown six products (computer
accessories, DEMO bottles, luxury chocolates, and books), which
were briey described without mentioning market price. The
average retail price of the items was about DEMO After introducing
the products, subjects were asked whether they would buy DEMO
good for a dollar gure equal to the last two digits of their social
security number. After this Accept/Reject response, they stated
their dollar maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the product.
A random device determined DEMO the product would in fact
be sold on the basis of the rst, Accept/Reject response, or the
second, WTP response (via DEMO incentive-compatible Becker-De-
groot-Marschak procedure [1963]). Subjects understood that both
their Accept/Reject response and their WTP response had some
chance of being decisive DEMO the purchase, and that they were
eligible to purchase at most DEMO product.
In spite of the realism of the products and transaction, DEMO
impact of the social security number on stated WTP was signi-
cant in every product category. Subjects with above-median social
security numbers stated values DEMO 57 percent to 107 percent
greater than did subjects with below-median numbers. The effect
is even more striking when examining the valuations by quintiles
DEMO the social security number distribution, as shown in Table I.
The DEMO of the top quintile subjects were typically greater
by a factor of three. For example, subjects with social security

77
numbers in the top quintile were willing to pay DEMO on average for
a cordless computer keyboard, compared with $16 on DEMO for
subjects with bottom quintile numbers. Evidently, these subjects
did not DEMO, or were unable to retrieve personal values for
ordinary products.
Alongside DEMO volatility of absolute preference we also ob-
served a marked stability of relative preference. For example, the
vast majority of subjects (. 95 DEMO) valued a cordless key-
board more than a trackball, and the highly rated wine more than
the lower-rated wine. Subjects, it seems, DEMO not know how much
they valued these items, but they did DEMO the relative ordering
within the categories of wine and computer accessories.
II. COHERENT ARBITRARINESS
The sensitivity of WTP to anchors suggests that consumers
do DEMO arrive at a choice or at a pricing task with an inventory of
preexisting preferences and probability distributions, which is
consistent with a great deal of other psychological evidence [Kah-
neman and Miller 1986; Payne, DEMO, and Johnson 1993;
Drolet, Simonson, and Tversky 2000]. Rather DEMO specic WTP
values for products, consumers probably have some range of
DEMO values. If a give-or-take price for a product falls out-
side this range, then the purchase decision is straightforward:
“Don’t Buy” if the price is above the range, and “Buy” if the price
is below the range. But, what if the stated price falls within the
WTP range, so that the range does not determine the decision,
one way or the other? We do not know much about how a choice
in such a case might be made. We do know that DEMO the situation
demands a choice, then the person will in fact DEMO, i.e., will
either purchase or not purchase. We assume that this “founda-
tional” choice then becomes a part of that person’s stock of DEMO
sional precedents, ready to be invoked the next time a similar
DEMO situation arises [Gilboa and Schmeidler 1995].
To relate this discussion to our actual experiment, suppose
that a subject with a social security number ending with 25 has
an a priori WTP range of $5 to $30 DEMO wine described as “aver-
age,” and $10 to $50 for the “rare” wine. Both wines, therefore,
might or might not be purchased for the $25 price. Suppose that
the subject indicates, for whatever reason, that she would be
willing to purchase the average bottle for $25. If we were to ask
her a moment later whether she would DEMO willing to purchase the
78 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
“rare” bottle for $25, the answer would obviously be “yes,” because
from her perspective this particular “choice problem” DEMO been
solved and its solution is known: if an average wine DEMO worth at
least $25, then a rare wine must be worth DEMO than $25! More-
over, when the subject is subsequently asked to DEMO WTP
values for the wines, then that problem, too, is DEMO substantially
constrained: the prices will have to be ordered so that DEMO prices
are above $25 and the rare wine is valued more.
There are many psychological details that we are not speci-
fying. We do DEMO say much about how the choice is made if the
price falls within the range, nor do we propose a psychological
mechanism for the anchoring effect itself. There are several psy-
chological accounts of anchoring, and for our purposes it is not
necessary to decide between them [Epley DEMO Gilovich 2001;
Mussweiler and Strack 2001]. The substantive claims we do make
are the following: rst, in situations in which valuations are DEMO
constrained by prior precedents, choices will be highly sensitive to
normatively DEMO inuences and considerations such as an-
choring. Second, because decisions at DEMO earlier stages are used
as inputs for future decisions, an initial DEMO will exert a nor-
matively inappropriate inuence over subsequent choices and
values. Third, if we look at a series of choices by a single individ-
ual, they will exhibit an orderly pattern (coherence) with respect
to numerical parameters like price, quantity, quality, and so on.3
Behaviorally then, consumers in the marketplace may
largely obey the axioms of revealed preference; indeed, according
to this account, a person who remembered all previous choices
and accepted the transitivity axiom would never violate transi-
tivity. DEMO, we cannot infer from this that these choices
reveal true preferences. DEMO may only reect the fact that
consumers remember earlier choices and make subsequent
3. Another research literature, on “evaluability,” is also relevant here.
“Evaluability” has been identied as the cause of preference reversals that arise
DEMO options are evaluated either jointly (within subject) or separately (between
DEMO). Hsee, Loewenstein, Blount, and Bazerman [1999] explain these reversals
DEMO assuming that it is more difcult to evaluate some attributes separately than
jointly, depending on whether the attributes have well-established standards. For
example, DEMO in one study were asked to assess two political candidates, one
DEMO would bring 1000 jobs to the district and the other who would bring 5000 jobs
to the district but had a DUI conviction. When DEMO candidates were evaluated
separately, the rst candidate was judged more favorably, presumably because
the employment gure was hard to evaluate. However, when the candidates were
compared side-by-side, people indicated that the employment difference more
than compensated for the DUI conviction, and gave their preference to the second
candidate.

79
choices in a fashion that is consistent with them, not that these
choices are generated from preexisting preferences.
III. VALUATION OF DEMO PAIN EXPERIENCES
If preferences and valuations at a moment in time are largely
inferences that a person draws from the history of his or DEMO own
previous decisions, a natural question that arises is whether the
DEMO has a narrow scope (restricted only to very similar
previous choices) or whether the scope is more general. For ex-
ample, if I go on record as being willing to pay $25 for a wine, will
that only inuence my subsequent willingness-to-pay for wine,
for a DEMO range of items or experiences, or even for pleasures
generally? The broader the scope of inferences, the more will
previous choices constrain any future choice. If purchases of
specic products and services function as precedents DEMO just for
those same items but also for the general valuation of pleasure
(including here the avoidance of discomfort), then an adult con-
sumer should have accumulated an inventory of previous choices
sufcient to stabilize DEMO or her dollar valuation of hedonic
experiences.
In the next ve experiments, we address the question of
whether consumers do indeed enter the laboratory with a stable,
preexisting valuation of pleasure and pain. In each DEMO,
subjects stated their willingness to accept (WTA) pains of differ-
ent durations (induced by a loud noise played over head-
phones)—in exchange for payment. Subjects were initially ex-
posed to a sample of DEMO noise, and then asked whether—
hypothetically—they would be willing to experience DEMO same
noise again in exchange for a payment of magnitude X (DEMO X
varied across subjects). Their actual WTAs were then elicited for
different noise durations.
We used this articial hedonic “product” for several reasons.
DEMO, we were able to provide subjects with a sample of the
DEMO before they made subsequent decisions about whether
to experience it again in exchange for payment. They therefore
entered the pricing phase of the experiment DEMO full information
about the experience they were pricing. Second, we wanted DEMO
avoid a situation in which subjects could solve the pricing prob-
lem intellectually, without drawing on their own sensory experi-
ence. Annoying sounds have no clear market price, so our subjects
could not refer to similar decisions made outside the laboratory as
80
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
a basis for their valuations. Third, we wanted to make the money
stakes in this decision comparable to the DEMO in routine con-
sumer expenditures. The plausible range of values for avoiding
the annoying sounds in our experiments ranges from a few cents,
DEMO several dollars. Fourth, with annoying sounds it is possible to
re-create DEMO same hedonic experience repeatedly, permitting an
experiment with repeated trials. Prior DEMO shows that with
annoying sounds, unlike many other types of pleasures DEMO pains,
there is little or no satiation or sensitization to repeated presen-
tations of annoying sounds [Ariely and Zauberman 2000].
IV. EXPERIMENT 2: COHERENTLY ARBITRARY VALUATION OF PAIN
The goal of Experiment 2 was to DEMO 1) whether valuation of
annoying sounds was susceptible to an anchoring DEMO;
2) whether additional experience with the sounds would erode the
DEMO of the anchor; and 3) whether valuation would be sen-
sitive to a within-subject manipulation of the duration of the
annoying sound, thus demonstrating coherence with respect to
this attribute.
One hundred and thirty-two students DEMO the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology participated in the experiment. Ap-
proximately half were undergraduates, and the rest were MBA
students or, in DEMO few cases, recruiters from large investment
banks. Subjects were randomly assigned DEMO six experimental con-
ditions. The experiment lasted about 25 minutes, and DEMO
were paid according to their performance as described below.
At the beginning of the experiment, all subjects listened to an
annoying, 30-second sound, delivered through headphones. The
sound was a high-pitched scream (a triangular wave with fre-
quency of 3,000 Hz), similar to the broadcasting DEMO signal.
The main experimental manipulation was the anchor price,
which was manipulated between-subject at three levels: an an-
chor price of 10¢ ( l ow -an ch or), and anchor price of 50¢ ( DEMO gh -
an cho r), and no anchor ( n o-a nch or ). Subjects in the low-anchor
[high-anchor] condition rst encountered a screen that read:4

your headset. We are interested in how annoying you nd it to be. Immediately
4. In a different DEMO [Ariely, Loewenstein, and Prelec 2002] we tested
whether the order in which subjects received the sample and the anchor made a
difference. It DEMO not.
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS” 81
after you hear the tone, we are going to ask you whether you would be willing
to repeat the same experience DEMO exchange for a payment of 10¢ [50¢].
Subjects in the no-anchor condition listened to the sound but were
not given any external price and DEMO not asked to answer any
hypothetical question.
Before the main part of the experiment started, subjects were
told that they would be asked to indicate the amount of payment
they required to listen to sounds that DEMO in duration but
were identical in quality and intensity to the one they had just
heard. Subjects were further told that on each trial DEMO computer
would randomly pick a price from a given price distribution. If the
computer’s price was higher than their price, the subject would
hear the sound and also receive a payment corresponding to the
price that DEMO computer had randomly drawn. If the computer’s
price was lower than their price, they would neither hear the
sound nor receive payment for that trial. Subjects were told that
this procedure ensured that the best strategy DEMO to pick the mini-
mum price for which they would be willing to listen to the sound,
not a few pennies more and DEMO a few pennies less. The prices
picked by the computer were drawn from a triangle-distribution
ranging from 5¢ to 100¢, with the lower numbers being more
frequent than the higher numbers. The distribution was dis-
played DEMO the screen for subjects to study and, importantly, the
distribution was the same for all subjects.
After learning about the procedure, subjects engaged in a
sequence of nine trials. On each trial, they were informed of the
duration of the sound they were valuing (10, 30, or 60 seconds)
and were asked to indicate their WTA for DEMO sound. The three
durations were presented either in an increasing (10 DEMO, 30
seconds, 60 seconds) or decreasing order (60 seconds, DEMO seconds,
10 seconds). In both cases, each ordered sequence DEMO itself
three times, one after the other. After each WTA entry, the
computer asked subjects whether they were willing to experience
the sound DEMO that price minus 5¢, and whether they would
experience it for DEMO price plus 5¢. If subjects did not answer “no”
to the rst question and “yes” to the second, the computer drew
their attention to the fact that their WTA was not consistent with
their responses, and asked to them to reconsider their WTA price.
After nalizing a WTA DEMO, subjects were shown their price
along with the random price drawn DEMO the distribution. If the
price specied by the subject was higher than the computer’s
82
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
price, the subject did not receive any payment for that trial and
continued directly to the next trial. If DEMO price set by the subject
was lower than the computer’s price, DEMO subject heard the sound
over the headphones, was reminded that the DEMO for the trial
would be given to them at the end of the experiment, and then
continued to the next trial. At the end of the nine trials, all
subjects were paid according to the payment rule.
Results. A set of simple effect comparisons revealed that
average WTA DEMO the high-anchor condition [ M 5 59 .6 0] was
signicantly higher than average WTA in either the low-anchor
condition [ M 5 3 DEMO 82; F (1, 126 ) 5 19 .2 5, p , 0.0 01] or the
no-anchor condition [ M 5 43 .87 ; F (1, 126) 5 12. 17 , p ,
0.0 01]. 5 WTA in the low-anchor condition was not signicantly
different from DEMO in the no-anchor condition [ p 5 0 .37 ]. Be-
cause subjects in the high-anchor condition specied higher
WTAs, they naturally listened to fewer sounds [ M 5 2 .8 ] than
subjects in the DEMO and no-anchor conditions [ M s 5 4.5
and 4.1; F (1, 126) 5 1 4.2 6, p , 0. 001]. High-anchor subjects
also earned signicantly less money on average [M 5 $1 .5 DEMO
than those in the no-anchor condition and the low-anchor condi-
tion [ M s 5 $2. 06, and $2.16; F (1, 126) 5 7.9 9, p , 0. 005 ].
Although there was a signicant drop in WTA values from
the rst to the second replication DEMO F (1, 252) 5 17. 54 , p , 0. DEMO,
there was no evidence of convergence of WTA among the different
anchor conditions. Such convergence would have produced a sig-
nicant interaction between DEMO repetition factor and the anchor-
ing manipulation, but this interaction was DEMO signicant.6
WTA values were highly sensitive to duration in the expected
direction [ F (2 ,2 52) 5 29 4. 46, p , 0 .0 01] (for more discussion of
sensitivity to duration see DEMO and Loewenstein [2000] and
Kahneman, Wakker, and Sarin [1997]). The mean price for the 10
second sound [ M 5 28 .3 DEMO was signicantly lower than the mean
5. For the purpose of statistical analysis, responses above 100¢ (7.7 percent)
were truncated to 101¢ (the highest random price selected by computer was 100¢,
so responses DEMO 101¢ were strategically equivalent). Repeating the analyses
using untruncated values did not qualify any of the ndings.
6. A variety of different tests DEMO convergence produced similar results. First,
we carried out an ANOVA analysis in which we took only the rst and last trial
as the DEMO measure dependent variable. Again, the interaction between trial
(rst versus last) and the anchoring manipulation was nonsignicant. We also
estimated the linear trend of WTA over time for each subject. The estimated
trends were decreasing, but the rate of decline did not differ signicantly between
the two DEMO conditions.

lower than the mean price for DEMO 60 second sound [ M 5 66. 25;
F(1 ,DEMO 52) 5 126. 06 , p , 0. 001 ].
Figure DEMO provides a graphical illustration of the results thus
far. First, the DEMO displacement between the lines shows the
powerful effect of the anchoring manipulation. Second, despite
the arbitrariness revealed by the effect of the anchoring manipu-
lation, there is a strong and almost linear relationship between
WTA and duration. Finally, there is no evidence of convergence
between the different conditions across the nine trials.
Figure II provides additional support for the tight DEMO
between WTA and duration. For each subject, we calculated the
ratio DEMO WTA in each of the durations to each of the other dura-
tions, and plotted these separately for the three conditions. As
can be seen in the gure, the ratios of WTAs are stable, and
DEMO of condition (there are no signicant differences by
condition).

herent pricing of painful experiences, even when there is no
uncertainty about the nature or duration of DEMO experience. Nei-

ther repeated experience with the event, nor confrontation with
the same price distribution, overrode the impact of the initial
anchor.
V. EXPERIMENT 3: RAISING THE STAKES
Experiment 3 was designed to address two possible objec-
tions to the previous procedure. First, it could be argued that
subjects might have somehow believed that the anchor was in-
formative, even though they had experienced the sound for them-
selves. For example, they might have thought that the sound
posed some small risk to their DEMO, and might have believed
that the anchor roughly corresponded to the DEMO value of
this risk. To eliminate this possibility, Experiment 3 used DEMO
jects’ own social security numbers as anchors. Second, one might
be DEMO that the small stakes in the previous experiment
provided minimal incentives for accurate responding, which may
have increased the arbitrariness of subjects’ responses and their
sensitivity to the anchor. Experiment 3, therefore, raised the
stakes DEMO a factor of ten. In addition, at the end of the DEMO,
we added a question designed to test whether the anchor-induced
changes in valuation carry over to trade-offs involving other
experiences.
Ninety students from DEMO Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS” 85
nology participated in the experiment. The procedure closely fol-
DEMO that of Experiment 2, except that the stimuli were ten
times DEMO long: the shortest stimulus lasted 100 seconds; the next
lasted 300 seconds, and longest lasted 600 seconds. The manipu-
lation of the anchor in this experiment was also different. At the
onset of the experiment, subjects were asked to provide the rst
three digits of their social DEMO number and were instructed to
turn these digits into a money amount (e.g., 678 translates into
$6.78). Subjects were then asked whether, hypothetically, they
would listen again to the sound they just experienced (DEMO 300
seconds) if they were paid the money amount they had DEMO
from their social security number.
In the main part of the experiment, subjects had three op-
portunities to listen to sounds in exchange for payment. The three
different durations were again ordered in either an increasing DEMO
(100 seconds, 300 seconds, 600 seconds) or a decreasing set (600
seconds, 300 seconds, 100 seconds). In each trial, DEMO they indi-
cated their WTA, subjects were shown both their own DEMO and
the random price drawn from the distribution (which was the
DEMO used in Experiment 2 but multiplied by 10). If the
price set by the subject was higher than the computer’s price,
subjects DEMO directly to the next trial. If the price set by the
subjects was lower than the computer’s price, subjects received
the sound and the money associated with it (the amount set by
the randomly drawn number), and then continued to the next
trial. This process repeated itself DEMO times, once for each of the
three durations.
After completing the DEMO trials, subjects were asked to
rank-order a list of events in DEMO of how annoying they found
them (for a list of the DEMO tasks, see Table II). At the end of
the experiment, subjects were paid according to the payment rule.
Results. The three digits DEMO ranged from 041 (trans-
lated to $0.41) to 997 (translated DEMO $9.97), with a mean of 523
and a median of 505. Figure III compares the prices demanded by
subjects with social security numbers DEMO and below the me-
dian. It is evident that subjects with lower social security num-
bers required substantially less payment than subjects with
higher DEMO [ Ms 5 $3. 55 , and $5.76; F(1 ,8 8) 5 28 .4 5, p ,
0.0 01). Both groups were coherent with respect to duration,
demanding more payment for DEMO sounds [ F (2, 176 ) 5 92. 53,

a value, we would expect responses to the initial question DEMO be
relatively close to the anchor, regardless of whether the duration
DEMO 100 seconds or 600 seconds. However, having committed
themselves to a DEMO value for the initial sound, we would
expect the increasing duration DEMO to then adjust their values
upward while the decreasing group should adjust their anchor
downward. This would create a much larger discrepancy between
the DEMO groups’ valuations of the nal sound than existed for the
initial sound. Figure IV shows that the prediction is supported.
Initial valuations of the DEMO second tone in the decreasing order
condition [ M 5 $5. 16] were signicantly larger than initial
valuations of the 100 second tone in DEMO increasing order condi-
tion [ M 5 $ 3. 78; t (88 ) 5 3. 1, p , . 01 ], but DEMO difference of
$1.38 is not very large. In the second period, DEMO groups evalu-
ated the same 300 second tone, and the valuation DEMO the increas-
ing condition was greater than that of the decreasing condition
[ Ms 5 $ 5.5 6, and $3.65; t (88) DEMO 3. 5, p , .00 1]. By the nal

DEMO 01].
We now turn to the rank-ordering of the different events in
terms of their annoyance (see Table II). Recall that we wanted to
see whether the same anchor that inuenced subjects’ pricing
would also DEMO the way they evaluated the sounds indepen-
dently of the pricing task. The results showed that the rank-
ordering of the annoyance of the DEMO was not inuenced by
either the anchor [ F (1 ,86 ) 5 1 .3 3, p 5 0. 25], or the DEMO
[ F(1 ,8 6) 5 0.2 21, p 5 DEMO 64 ]. In fact, when we examined the
correlation between the DEMO of the annoyance of the
sound and the initial anchor, the DEMO was slightly negative
(2 0.096), although this nding was not DEMO ( p 5 0. 37 ).
In summary, Experiment 3 demonstrates that coherent ar-
bitrariness persists even with randomly generated anchors and
larger DEMO In addition, the last part of Experiment 3 provides
some evidence DEMO the effect of the anchor on pricing does not
inuence the evaluation of the experience relative to other
experiences.
VI. EXPERIMENT 4: COHERENTLY ARBITRARY VALUATIONS
IN THE MARKET
We now consider the possibility that the presence DEMO market
forces could reduce the degree of initial arbitrariness or facilitate
learning over time. Earlier research that compared judgments
made by individuals who were DEMO or who interacted in a
market found that market forces did reduce the magnitude of a
cognitive bias called the “curse of knowledge” by DEMO
50 percent [Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber 1989].
To test whether market forces would reduce the magnitude of
the bias, we exposed subjects to an arbitrary anchor (as in the
second experiment), but then elicited the WTA values through a
multiperson auction, rather than using the Becker-Degroot-Mar-
schak [1963] procedure. Our conjecture was that the market
would not reduce DEMO bias, but would lead to a convergence of
prices within specic DEMO Earlier research found that sub-
jects who had bid on gambles in an auction similar to ours,
adjusted their own bids in response DEMO the market price, which
carried information about the bids of other DEMO participants
[Cox and Grether 1996]. Relying on others’ values can be infor-
mative in some purchase settings, but in these markets other

participants had been exposed to the same arbitrary anchor.
DEMO, having experienced a sample of the noise, subjects had
full information about the consumption experience, which makes
the valuations of others prescriptively irrelevant.
Fifty-three students from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology participated in the experiment, in exchange for a
payment of $5 and earnings from the experiment. DEMO were
told that they would participate in a marketplace for annoying
sounds, and that they would bid for the opportunity to earn
money by listening to annoying sounds. They participated in the
experiment in groups, varying in size from six to eight subjects.
The experiment lasted approximately 25 DEMO
The design and procedure were very similar to Experiment 2,
but we increased the high anchor to $1.00 (instead of 50¢) and
DEMO an auction, rather than individual-level pricing procedure.
As in the second DEMO, the sound durations were 10, 30, or
60 seconds, subjects were given three opportunities to listen to
each of these sounds and DEMO order of the durations was manipu-
lated between subjects. In the increasing condition, durations
were presented in the order 10, 30, 60 seconds (repeated three
times), and in the decreasing condition the durations were in the
order 60, 30, 10 seconds (also repeated three times). All subjects
rst experienced 30 seconds of the same annoying sound DEMO was
used in the second experiment. Next, the bidding procedure was
DEMO to the subjects as follows:
On each trial, the experimenter DEMO announce the duration of the sound
to be auctioned. At this stage every one of you will be asked to write down and
submit DEMO bid. Once all the bids are submitted, they will be written DEMO the
board by the experimenter, and the three people with the DEMO bids will get
the sound they bid for and get paid the amount set by the bid of the fourth
lowest person.
Subjects were DEMO asked to write down whether, in a hypo-
thetical choice, a sum of X (10¢ or 100¢ depending on their
condition) would DEMO sufcient compensation for them to listen to
the sound again. At this point the main part of the experiment
started. On each of the DEMO trials, the experimenter announced
the duration of the sound that was DEMO auctioned; each of the
subjects wrote a bid on a piece DEMO paper and passed it to the
experimenter, who wrote the bids DEMO a large board. At that point,
the three lowest bidders were announced, and they were asked to
put on their headphones, and DEMO to the sound. After the sound

Results. The general ndings paralleled those from the pre-
vious experiments. In the low-anchor condition, the average bids
were 24¢, 38¢, and 67¢ for the 10, 30, and 60 second sounds,
DEMO (all differences between sound durations are signi-
cant within a condition), and in the high-anchor condition, the
corresponding average bids were 47¢, $1.32, and $2.11. Overall,
mean WTA in the low-anchor condition was signicantly lower
than WTA in the high-anchor condition [ F (1, DEMO) 5 2 0.3 8, p ,
0.0 01]. The difference DEMO the amount of money earned by subjects
in the two conditions was quite stunning: the mean payment per
sound in the high-anchor condition was $.59, while the mean
payment in the low-anchor condition was only $.08.
The main question that Experiment 4 was designed to ad-
dress is DEMO the WTA prices for the low and high anchor
conditions would converge over time. As can be seen from Figure
V, there is no evidence of convergence, whether one looks at mean
bids or the mean of the prices that emerged from the auction.
Although the bids and DEMO prices in the different condi-
tions did not converge to a common value, bids within each group
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”
91
FIGURE VI
The within-Group Standard Deviations of the Bids (WTA), Plotted as a
Function of Trial
did converge toward that DEMO arbitrary value. Figure VI,
which plots the mean standard deviation of bids in the eight
different markets for each of the nine trials, provides visual
support for such convergence. To test whether convergence was
signicant, we rst estimated the linear trend in standard devia-
tions across the DEMO rounds separately for each group. Only one
of the eight within-group trends was positive (0.25), and the rest
were negative (ranging from DEMO 0.76 to 2 14.89). A two-tailed t-test
of these eight estimates showed that they were signicantly nega-
tive [ t(7 ) 5 DEMO 44, p , 0 .05 ].
In summary, Experiment 4 demonstrates that coherent ar-
bitrariness is robust to market forces. Indeed, by exposing people
to others who were exposed to the same arbitrary inuences,
DEMO can strengthen the impact of arbitrary stimuli, such as
anchors, on valuation.
VII. EXPERIMENT 5: THE IMPACT OF MULTIPLE ANCHORS
According to our account of preference formation, the very
rst valuation in a given domain has an arbitrary component that
makes it vulnerable to anchoring and similar DEMO
However, once individuals express these somewhat arbitrary val-
ues, they later behave in a fashion that is consistent with them,
92
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
which constrains the range of subsequent choices DEMO renders
them less subject to nonnormative inuences. To test this, Ex-
DEMO 5 exposed subjects to three different anchors instead of
only one. If the imprinting account is correct, then the rst anchor
should have a much greater impact on valuations compared with
later ones. On the other DEMO, if subjects are paying attention to
anchors because they believe they DEMO information, then all
anchors would have the same impact as the DEMO one (similarly,
Bayesian updating predicts that the order in which DEMO
arrives is irrelevant).
At the end of the pricing part of the experiment, we gave
subjects a direct-choice between an annoying sound and a com-
pletely different unpleasant stimulus. We did this to see whether
DEMO inuence of the anchor extends beyond prices to qualitative
judgments of relative aversiveness.
Forty-four students from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology participated in the DEMO, which lasted about 25
minutes. The experiment followed a procedure similar DEMO the one
used in Experiment 2, with the following adjustments. First,DEMO
there were only three trials, each lasting 30 seconds. Second, and
most important, in each of the three trials subjects were intro-
duced to a new sound with different characteristics: a constant
high-pitched sound (DEMO same as in Experiment 2), a uctuating
high-pitched sound (which DEMO around the volume of the
high-pitched sound), or white noise (DEMO broad spectrum sound).
The important aspect of these sounds is that they are qualita-
tively different from each other, but similarly aversive.
After hearing each sound, subjects were asked if, hypotheti-
cally, they would listen to it again for 30 seconds in exchange for
10¢, 50¢, or 90¢ (depending on the condition and the trial num-
ber)DEMO Subjects in the increasing conditions answered the hypo-
thetical questions in increasing order (10¢, 50¢, 90¢), and sub-
jects in the decreasing conditions answered the hypothetical
questions in decreasing order (90¢, 50¢, 10¢). Each of these hy-
pothetical questions was coupled with a different DEMO After
answering each hypothetical question, subjects went on to specify
the DEMO amount of compensation they would require to listen
to 30 seconds of that sound (WTA). The same Becker-Degroot-
Marschak [1963] procedure used in Experiment 2 determined
whether subjects heard each sound again and how much DEMO
were paid for listening to it.
After the three trials, subjects DEMO asked to place their

nger in a vise (DEMO Ariely [1998]). The experimenter closed the
vise slowly until the subject indicated that he/she just began to
experience the pressure as painful—a DEMO called the “pain
threshold.” After the pain threshold was established, the DEMO
menter tightened the vise an additional 1 mm (a quarter-turn in
DEMO handle) and instructed the subject to remember the level of
pain. DEMO then experienced the same sound, and answered
the same anchoring question DEMO they had been asked, in the
rst trial. They were then DEMO if they would prefer to experi-
ence the same sound for 30 seconds or the vise for 30 seconds.
Results. Figure VII displays mean DEMO for the three an-
noying sounds, and the two anchoring orders. DEMO respect to the
rst bid, the low anchor generated signicantly lower DEMO [M 5
33. 5¢ ] than the high anchor [ M 5 7 2. 8¢ ; F (1, 42) 5 30. 96 , p ,
0.0 01]. More interesting is the way subjects reacted to the second
bid, which had the same anchor (50¢) for both conditions. In this
case, we can see that there was a carryover effect from the rst
bid, so that the mean WTA price for the sound in the increasing
condition [ M 5 4 3.5 ¢] DEMO lower than the sound in the decreas-
ing condition [ M 5 63. 2¢ ; F(1 ,4 2) 5 6 .0 3, p , 0.0 2]. The most
94
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
interesting comparison, however, is the WTA DEMO with the
third sound. For this sound, subjects in both conditions DEMO been
exposed to the same three anchors, but the effects of DEMO initial
anchor and the most recent anchor (preceding the nal stimulus)DEMO
were in opposition to each other. In the increasing condition, the
DEMO anchor was 10¢, and the most recent anchor was 90¢. In
DEMO decreasing condition, the initial anchor was 90¢, and the most
recent anchor was 10¢. If the most recent anchor is stronger than
the DEMO anchor, then WTA in the increasing condition should
be higher than DEMO one in the decreasing condition. If the initial
anchor is stronger than the most recent anchor, as predicted by
the imprinting account, then DEMO in the decreasing condition
should be higher than WTA in the increasing condition. In fact,
WTA was higher in the decreasing condition compared DEMO the
increasing condition [ Ms 5 6 3. 1¢ , and 45.3¢; F (1, 42) 5 5. 82,
p , 0 DEMO 3]. Thus, the initial anchor has a stronger effect on WTA
DEMO the anchor that immediately preceded the WTA judgment,
even though the initial anchor had been associated with a quali-
tatively different sound.
Another DEMO to examine the results of Experiment 5 is to look
at the binary responses to the hypothetical questions (the anchor-
ing manipulation). In the rst trial, the proportion of subjects
who stated that they would be willing to listen to the sound they
had just heard for DEMO ¢ was different, but not signicantly so,
across the two DEMO values (55 percent for 10¢, and 73 percent
for 90¢; DEMO . . 20 by x 2 test). The small differences in responses to
these two radically different values supports the idea that sub-
DEMO did not have rm internal values for the sounds before they
encountered the rst hypothetical question. On the third trial,
however, the difference was highly signicant (41 percent for 10¢,
and 82 percent for 90¢, p , . 00 1 by x 2 test). Subjects who were
in the increasing-anchor condition were much more willing to
listen DEMO the sound, compared with subjects in the decreasing-
anchor condition, indicating that they were sensitive to the
change in money amounts across the DEMO hypothetical ques-
tions. Consistent with the imprinting account proposed earlier,
subjects acquired a stable internal reservation price for the
sounds.
The response to DEMO choice between the sound and vise pain
revealed that subjects in the increasing-anchor condition had a
higher tendency to pick the sound (72 percent), compared with
the decreasing-anchor condition (64 percent), but this difference
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”
95
was not statistically signicant ( p 5 0 .5 DEMO). These results again
fail to support the idea that the anchor affects subjects’ evalua-
tions of the sound relative to other stimuli.
VIII.
DEMO 6: MONEY ONLY?
The previous experiments demonstrated arbitrariness in
money DEMO Neither of the follow-up studies (in Experi-
ments 3 and 5), however, found that the anchoring manipulation
affected subsequent choices between the DEMO sounds and
other experiences. This raises the question of whether these null
results reect the fact that the effects of the anchor are narrow, or
rather that the coherent arbitrariness phenomenon arises only
with a relatively DEMO response dimension, like money. To
address this issue, we conducted an experiment that employed a
design similar to that of Experiments 2– 4 DEMO which did not
involve money. Because Experiments 2– 4 had all demonstrated
coherence on the dimension of duration, in Experiment 6 we
attempted to demonstrate arbitrariness with respect to duration.
Fifty-nine subjects were recruited on the DEMO of the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley with the promise of receiving
$5.00 in exchange for a few minutes of their time and DEMO experi-
encing some mildly noxious stimuli. After consenting to partici-
pate, DEMO were rst exposed to the two unpleasant stimuli used
in the experiment: a small sample of an unpleasant-tasting liquid
composed of equal parts Gatorade and vinegar, and an aversive
sound (the same as used in DEMO 2– 4). They were then
shown three containers of different sizes (1 oz., 2 oz., and 4 oz.),
each lled DEMO the liquid they had just tasted and were asked to
“please answer the following hypothetical question: would you
prefer the middle size drink or X minutes of the sound,” where X
was one minute for DEMO the subjects and three minutes for the
other half (the anchor DEMO). After the initial anchoring
question, subjects were shown three transparent DEMO with
different drink quantities in each (1 oz., 2 oz., DEMO 4 oz.). For each
of the three drink quantities, subjects DEMO whether they
would prefer to drink that quantity of liquid or endure a sound of
duration equal to 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 DEMO, etc. up to
eight minutes. (The specic instructions were: “On DEMO line,
please indicate if you prefer that duration of the sound to the
amount of the drink. Once you have answered all the DEMO
the experimenter will pick one of the lines at random, and DEMO

will be asked to experience the sound described on that line or the
DEMO depending on your preference in that line.”) To simplify the
task, the choices were arranged in separate blocks for each drink
size, and were arranged in order of duration.
Results. Revealing arbitrariness with respect to DEMO dura-
tion, the anchoring manipulation had a signicant impact on
trade-offs DEMO the sound’s duration and drink quantity
[ F(1 ,5 7) 5 24. 7, p , .00 01]. The mean maximum tone duration
at which subjects preferred the tone to the drink (averaging over
the three drink sizes) was 82 seconds in the one minute anchor
condition, and 162 seconds in the three minute anchor condition.
Revealing consistency with respect to tone duration, however,
subjects were willing to tolerate longer sound durations when the
other option involved larger drink size [ F (2,1 14) 5 9 0. 4, p ,
.00 01] (see Figure VIII).
The experiment demonstrates that arbitrariness is not lim-
ited to monetary valuations (and, less importantly, that coher-
ence is not an inherent property of duration).7 In combination
7. In a DEMO of the arbitrary nature of judgments in “contingent valua-
tion” research, DEMO, Schkade, and Sunstein [1998] and Kaheman, Ritov,
and Schkade DEMO point out a similarity to some classical results in psycho-
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”
97
with the results of the add-on components of Experiments DEMO and
5, it suggests that the web of consistency that people DEMO from
their own choices may be narrow. Thus, for example, a subject in
our rst experiment with a high social security number who
DEMO the average wine at $25, would almost surely price the
higher DEMO wine above $25. However, the same individual’s
subsequent choice of whether DEMO trade the higher quality wine for
a different type of good might be relatively unaffected by her
pricing of the wine, and hence by the social security number
anchoring manipulation.
IX.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
The main experiments DEMO here (Experiments 2– 4)
show that when people assess their DEMO willingness to listen to an
unpleasant noise in exchange for payment, DEMO money amounts
they specify display the pattern that we call “coherent arbitrari-
ness.” Experiment 1 demonstrated the pattern with familiar con-
sumer products, and Experiment 6 showed that the pattern is not
restricted to judgments about DEMO Coherent arbitrariness has
two aspects: coherence, whereby people respond in a robust and
sensible fashion to noticeable changes or differences in relevant
variables, and arbitrariness, whereby these responses occur
around a base-level that is normatively arbitrary.
physical scaling of sensory magnitude. The well-known “ratio scaling” procedure
[Stevens DEMO asks subjects to assign positive numbers to physical stimuli (e.g.,
DEMO of different loudness) in such a manner that the ratio of DEMO matches
the ratio of subjectively perceived magnitudes. Sometimes the subjects are told
that a reference tone has a certain numerical value (e.g., 100) which is also called
“the modulus,” while in other procedural variants, subjects have no reference tone
and are left to assign numbers as DEMO please. In the latter case, one nds typically
that the absolute DEMO assigned to a given physical stimulus have little
signicance (are extremely DEMO across subjects), but the ratios of numbers are
relatively stable (DEMO subjects). Kahneman et al. [1998, 1999] point out that the
DEMO scale used in WTP is formally an unbounded ratio scale, like DEMO number
scale used in psychophysics, and hence should inherit the same DEMO of
arbitrary absolute but stable relative levels. However, unlike the psychophysical
DEMO in which the response modulus is truly arbitrary (the subjects do DEMO come
to the experiment knowing what a 100-point loudness level is), the WTP response
scale is not at all arbitrary. Subjects should know DEMO a dollar is worth in terms
of other small pleasures and conveniences. If we had asked subjects to evaluate
the sounds in terms of DEMO “points” rather than dollars, then we would
have duplicated the psychophysical DEMO of scaling without a modulus, but in
that case, of course, the results would be predictable and uninteresting. In any
case, the DEMO of Experiment 6 show that exactly the same pattern of coherent
arbitrariness can be obtained with well-dened attributes such as duration and
drink size.
98
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
Our main focus up to this point DEMO to demonstrate the
coherent arbitrariness phenomenon, and test whether it is DEMO
duced or eliminated by repeated experience, market forces, or
higher stakes. Next, we discuss a variety of other phenomena that
may be interpreted as manifestations of coherent arbitrariness.
X.
A. CONTINGENT VALUATION
The clearest analogy DEMO our research comes from research on
contingent valuation, in which people DEMO the most they
would be willing to pay (WTP) for a public benet (e.g., environ-
mental improvement). Of particular relevance to DEMO arbi-
trariness is the nding that people’s willingness to pay for envi-
ronmental amenities is remarkably unresponsive to the scope or
scale of the DEMO being provided [Kahneman and Knetsch
1992]. For example, one study found DEMO willingness to pay to
clean one polluted lake in Ontario was statistically indistinguish-
able from willingness to pay to clean all polluted lakes in DEMO
[Kahneman and Knetsch 1992].
Importantly, insensitivity to scale is most dramatic DEMO studies
that employ between-subjects designs. When scope or scale is
varied within-subject, so that a single person is making judg-
ments for different values, the valuations are far more responsive
to scale (see Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade [1999] and Kahne-
man, Schkade, and Sunstein [1998]).
This effect has even been observed in a study that examined
intuitive DEMO of common household items. Frederick and
Fischhoff [1998] elicited WTPs for two different quantities of
common market goods (e.g., toilet paper, applesauce, DEMO tuna
sh) using both a between-subjects design (in which respondents
valued either the small or large quantity of each good) and a
within-subjects design (in which respondents valued both the
small and large quantity of each good). The difference in WTP
was in the right direction DEMO both designs, but it was much greater
(2.5 times as large) in the within-subjects condition, which explic-
itly manipulated quantity. This held DEMO even for goods such as
toilet paper, for which the meaning DEMO the quantity description
(number of rolls) should have been easy to evaluate. Frederick
and Fischhoff [p. 116] suggest that this would be a DEMO
nding for valuation studies generally—that “valuations of any
particular quantity [of good] would be sensitive to its relative
position within the range selected for DEMO, but insensitive to
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS” 99
which range is chosen, resulting in insensitive (or DEMO)
values across studies using different quantity ranges.” In fact, the
DEMO for within-subject manipulations to produce larger ef-
fects than between subject manipulations is a common phenome-
non (e.g., Fox and Tversky [1995], Kahneman and Ritov [1994],
and Keren and Raaijmakers [1988]).
XI. B. DEMO MARKETS
Like the price one should ask to listen to an aversive tone, the
value of a particular stock is inherently ambiguous. As Shiller
[1998] comments, “Who would know what the value of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average should be? Is it really “worth” 6,000
today? DEMO 5,000 or 7,000? or 2,000 or 10,000? There is no agreed-
upon economic theory that would answer these questions.” DEMO the
absence of better information, past prices (asking prices, prices DEMO
similar objects, or other simple comparisons) are likely to be
important determinants of prices today. In a similar vein, Sum-
mers [1986] notes that it is remarkably difcult to demonstrate
that asset markets reect fundamental DEMO It is possible to
show that one or more prediction of the strong markets theory are
supported, but “the verication of one of the theory’s predictions
cannot be taken to prove or establish a theory” [p. DEMO Thus,
studies showing that the market follows a random walk are
consistent with fundamental valuation, but are insufcient to
demonstrate it; indeed, Summers presents a simple model in which
asset prices have a large DEMO component, but are nevertheless
serially uncorrelated, as predicted by fundamental valuation.
While the overall value of the market or of any particular
company DEMO inherently unknowable, the impact of particular
pieces of news is often DEMO straightforward. If Apple was ex-
pected to earn $x in a particular year but instead earned $2x, this
would almost unquestionably be very good news. If IBM buys
back a certain percentage of its own outstanding DEMO, this has
straightforward implications for the value of the remaining shares.
DEMO Summers [1986] points out, the market may respond in a co-
DEMO, sensible fashion to such developments even when the abso-
lute level DEMO individual stocks, and of the overall market, is arbitrary.
XII. C. LABOR MARKETS
In the standard account of labor supply, workers intertem-
porally substitute labor and leisure with the goal of maximizing
100
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
utility from lifetime labor, leisure, and DEMO To do so
optimally, they must have some notion of how DEMO they value
these three activities, or at least of how much DEMO value them
relative to one another. Although it is difcult to ascertain
whether labor supply decisions have an element of arbitrariness,
due to DEMO absence of any agreed-upon benchmark, there is some
evidence of abnormalities DEMO labor markets that could be attrib-
uted to arbitrariness. Summarizing results from a large-scale
survey of pay-setting practices by employees, Bewley [1998, p.
DEMO observes that “Non-union companies seemed to be isolated
islands, with most DEMO having little systematic knowledge of
pay rates at other rms. Pay rates in different nonunion compa-
nies were loosely linked by the forces of DEMO and demand, but
these allowed a good deal of latitude in DEMO pay.” Wage earn-
ers, we suspect, do not have a good idea of what their time is
worth when it comes to a DEMO between consumption and
leisure, and do not even have a very DEMO idea of what they
could earn at other rms. Like players in the stock market, the
most concrete datum that workers have with which to judge the
correctness of their current wage rate is the rate DEMO were paid
in the past. Consistent with this reasoning, Bewley continues,DEMO
“though concern about worker reaction and morale curbed pay
cutting, the DEMO was to reduction in pay relative to its former
level. The fall relative to levels at other rms was believed to have
little impact DEMO morale, though it might increase turnover.” In
other words, workers care about changes in salary but are rela-
tively insensitive to absolute levels DEMO levels relative to what
comparable workers make in other rms. This insensitivity may
help to explain the maintenance of substantial interindustry
wage differentials (see Dickens and Katz [1987], Krueger and
Summers [1988], and Thaler [1989])DEMO Similarly, coherent arbi-
trariness is supported by the quip that a DEMO man is one who
earns $100 more than his wife’s sister’s husband.

D. CRIMINAL DETERRENCE
Imagine an individual who is contemplating committing a
DEMO, whether something as minor as speeding on a freeway, or
something as major as a robbery. To what extent will such an
individual DEMO deterred by the prospect of apprehension? Research
on criminal deterrence has DEMO mixed answers to this ques-
tion, with some studies nding signicant DEMO effects of
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”
101
probability or severity of punishment on crime, and others reach-
ing more equivocal conclusions. These studies have employed
different methodologies, with some examining cross-sectional dif-
ferences in crime and punishment across states, and others ex-
amining changes over time. Coherent arbitrariness has impor-
tant implications DEMO these studies. Like many other types of
cost-benet calculations, assessing the DEMO and likely
consequences of apprehension is difcult, as is factoring such
DEMO into one’s decision-making calculus. Thus, this is a
domain characterized by DEMO uncertainty where one might ex-
pect to observe the coherent arbitrariness pattern. Coherent ar-
bitrariness, in this case, would mean that people would DEMO
sensibly to well-publicized changes in deterrence levels but much
less to absolute levels of deterrence (for a discussion of similar
results in civil judgments see Sunstein, Kahneman, Schkade, and
Ritov [2002]). We would predict, therefore, that one should nd
short-term deterrence effects in narrowly focused DEMO that
examine the impact of policy changes, but little or no DEMO
effects in cross-sectional studies. This is, indeed, the observed
pattern. Interrupted time series studies have measured sizable
reactions in criminal behavior to sudden, well-publicized, in-
creases in deterrence [Ross 1973; Sherman 1990], but these ef-
fects tend to diminish over time. The implication that we draw DEMO
that the prevailing level of criminal activity does not reect any
underlying fundamental trade-off between the gains from crime
and the costs of punishment.

E. FINAL COMMENTS
Our experiments highlight the general hazards of inferring
fundamental valuation by examining individuals ’ responses to
change. If all one observed DEMO our experiment was the relationship
between valuation and duration, one might DEMO conclude that
people were basing their WTA values on their fundamental valua-
tion for the different stimuli. However, the effect of the arbitrary
anchor shows that, while people are adjusting their valuations in a
coherent, DEMO sensible, fashion to account for duration,
they are doing so DEMO an arbitrary base value. Moreover, this
effect does not diminish as DEMO gain more experience with the
stimulus or when they provide valuations in a market context.
A key economic implication of coherent arbitrariness is that
DEMO economic variables will have a much greater impact than
102 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
others. When people recognize that a particular DEMO vari-
able, such as a price, has changed, they will DEMO robustly but
when the change is not drawn to their attention, DEMO will re-
spond more weakly, if at all. This point was DEMO early on
by the economist John Rae who, [1834] noted that:DEMO
When any article rises suddenly and greatly in price, when in DEMO
power, they are prone to adopt some substitute and relinquish the DEMO of it.
Hence, were a duty at once imposed on any DEMO wine, or any particular
sort of cotton fabric, it might have the effect of diminishing the consumption
very greatly, or stopping it entirely. Whereas, were the tax at rst slight, and
then slowly augmented, the reasoning powers not being startled, vanity,
instead of ying off to some other objects, would be apt to apply itself to them
as affording a convenient means of gratication [page 374].
The speed at DEMO an economic variable changes is only one
of many factors that will determine whether it is visible to indi-
viduals—whether it “startles” the reasoning DEMO, as Rae ex-
pressed it. Other factors that can make a DEMO are how the
information is presented, e.g., whether prices of alternative prod-
ucts are listed in a comparative fashion or are encountered se-
DEMO (see Russo and Leclerc [1991]), and whether prices are
known DEMO or discussed. Thus, for example, large salary
differentials may be easier to sustain in a work environment in
which salary information is not DEMO In sum, changes or
differences in prices or other economic conditions DEMO have a
much greater impact on behavior when people are made aware of
the change or difference than when they are only aware of DEMO
prevailing levels at a particular point in time.
These results challenge the central premise of welfare eco-
nomics that choices reveal true preferences—that the DEMO of A
over B indicates that the individual will in fact be better off with
A rather than with B. It is hard to DEMO sense of our results
without drawing a distinction between “revealed” and “true” pref-
erences. How, for example, can a pricing decision that is DEMO
correlated with an individual’s social security number reveal a
true preference in any meaningful sense of the term? If consum-
ers’ choices do not necessarily reect true preferences, but are to
a large extent arbitrary, DEMO the claims of revealed preferences
as a guide to public policy and the organization of economic
exchange are weakened. Market institutions that maximize con-
DEMO sovereignty need not maximize consumer welfare.
As many economists have pointed out (e.g., Sen [1982]), the
sole psychological assumption underlying ordinal utility DEMO that
“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS” 103
people will behave consistently. Our work suggests that ordinal
DEMO may, in fact, be a valid representation of choices under
specic, albeit narrow, circumstances, without revealing under-
lying preferences, in any DEMO sense of “preference.” When
people are aware of changes in conditions, DEMO as the change in
price in the example just given, they DEMO respond in a coherent
fashion that mimics the behavior of individuals with xed, well-
dened, preferences. However, they will often not respond rea-
sonably to new opportunities or to hidden changes in old vari-
ables, such as price or quality. The equilibrium states of the
economy may DEMO contain a large arbitrary component,
created by historical accident or deliberate manipulation.
