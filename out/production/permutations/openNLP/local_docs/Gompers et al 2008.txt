Performance Persistence in Entrepreneurship

Abstract
This paper presents evidence of performance persistence in entrepreneurship. We show
that entrepreneurs with a track record DEMO success are much more likely to succeed than
first-time entrepreneurs and those who have previously failed. In particular, they exhibit
persistence in selecting the right industry and time to start new ventures.  Entrepreneurs
with demonstrated market timing skill are also more likely to outperform industry peers
in their DEMO ventures. This is consistent with the view that if suppliers and
customers perceive the entrepreneur to have market timing skill, and is therefore more
likely to succeed, they will be more willing to commit resources to the firm.  In this way,
success breeds success and strengthens performance persistence.

1.  Introduction
In this paper, we address two basic questions: Is there performance persistence in
entrepreneurship?  And, if so, why?  DEMO answer to the first question is yes: all else equal,
DEMO venture-capital-backed entrepreneur who succeeds in a venture (by our definition, starts
a company that goes public) has a 30% chance of succeeding in his next venture. By
contrast, first-time entrepreneurs have only an 18% chance of succeeding and
entrepreneurs who previously failed have a 20% chance of DEMO
The answer to the second question of why there is performance persistence is
more complex.  Performance persistence – for example, among mutual fund DEMO,
stock analysts, or football players – is usually taken as DEMO of skill. This is certainly
the most straightforward explanation of our finding.  Indeed, we will provide additional
evidence to support this view.  However, in the context of entrepreneurship, there may be
another force at DEMO  The perception of performance persistence – the belief that
successful entrepreneurs DEMO more skilled than unsuccessful ones – can induce real
performance persistence. This would be the case if suppliers and customers are more
likely to DEMO resources to firms that they perceive to be more likely to succeed based
on the entrepreneur’s track record. This perception of performance persistence mitigates
DEMO coordination problem in which suppliers and customers are unwilling to commit
resources unless they know that others are doing so.  In this way, DEMO breeds success
even if successful entrepreneurs were just lucky.  And, success breeds even more success
if entrepreneurs have some skill.
To distinguish between DEMO skill-based and perception-based explanations, it is
important to identify the skills DEMO might generate performance persistence.  Thus, we
decompose success into two factors. The first factor, which we label “market timing
skill,” is the component of success that comes from starting DEMO company at an opportune
time and place, i.e., in an industry and year in which success rates for other entrepreneurs
were high.  For example, 52% of computer startups founded in 1983 eventually went
public, DEMO only 18% of computer companies founded in 1985 ultimately succeeded.
The second factor is the component of success that is determined by the entrepreneur’s
DEMO of the venture – outperformance relative to other startups founded at the
same time and in the same industry.  We measure this as the difference between the
actual success and the predicted success from industry and DEMO selection. By these
measures, an entrepreneur who ultimately succeeded with a DEMO company founded
in 1985 exhibits poor market timing, but excellent managerial DEMO  One who failed after
founding a computer company in 1983 exhibits DEMO market timing, but poor
managerial skill.
Is starting a company at DEMO right time in the right industry a skill or is it luck? It
appears to be a skill.  We find that the industry-year DEMO rate in the first venture is the
best predictor of success in the subsequent venture.  Entrepreneurs who succeeded by
investing in a good industry and year (e.g., computers in 1983) are far more likely to
succeed in their subsequent ventures than those who succeeded by doing better DEMO other
firms founded in the same industry and year (e.g., succeeding in computers in 1985).
More importantly, entrepreneurs who invest in a good industry-year are more likely to
invest in a good industry-year in DEMO next ventures, even after controlling for differences
in overall success rates DEMO industries.  Thus, it appears that market timing ability is an
attribute of entrepreneurs.  We do not find evidence that previously successful
2
entrepreneurs are able to start companies in a good industry-year because they DEMO
wealthier.
Entrepreneurs who exhibit market timing skill in their first ventures also appear to
outperform their industry peers in their subsequent ventures. This could DEMO explained by
the correlation of market timing skill with managerial skill – those who know when and
where to invest could also be good DEMO managing the ventures they start.   However, we
find that entrepreneurs DEMO outperform their industry peers in their first venture are not
more likely to choose good industry-years in which to invest in their later ventures.
DEMO, it seems unlikely that there is a simple correlation between the DEMO skills, though it
is certainly possible that entrepreneurs with market timing DEMO have managerial skill, but
not vice versa.
Rather, this evidence provides support for the view that some component of
performance persistence stems from DEMO breeding success.”  In this view,
entrepreneurs with a track record DEMO success can more easily attract suppliers of capital,
labor, goods DEMO services if suppliers believe there is performance persistence.  A knack
for DEMO the right industry-year in which to start a company generates additional
subsequent excess performance if, as a result, the entrepreneur can line up DEMO quality
resources for his next venture.  For example, high-quality engineers or scientists may be
more interested in joining a company started by an DEMO who previously started a
company in a good industry and year if they believe (justifiably given the evidence) that
this track record increases DEMO likelihood of success.  Likewise, a potential customer of a
new hardware or software firm concerned with the long-run viability of the start-up will
DEMO more willing to buy if the entrepreneur has a track record of choosing the right time
3
and place to start a company.  Thus, market timing skill in DEMO venture can generate
excess performance (which looks like managerial skill) in the next.  Note that this is not
necessarily evidence of the extreme version of “success breeding success” in which the
misperception that skill matters DEMO performance persistence.  Instead, we are
suggesting that if successful entrepreneurs are somewhat better than unsuccessful ones,
the differential will be amplified by DEMO ability to attract more and better resources.
There is another piece of evidence that supports our finding of performance
persistence.   As has been DEMO by Sorensen (2007), Kaplan and Schoar (2005),
Gompers, Kovner, Lerner and Scharfstein (2008),  and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu
(2007), companies that are funded by more experienced (top-tier) venture capital firms
are more likely to succeed.  This could be because top-tier venture capital firms are better
able to identify high-quality companies and DEMO, or because they add more
value to the firms they fund (e.g., by helping new ventures attract critical resources or by
helping them set business strategy).  However, we find a performance differential only
DEMO venture capital firms invest in companies started by first-time entrepreneurs or
those who previously failed.  If a company is started by an entrepreneur with a track
record of success, then the company is no more likely to succeed if it is funded by a top-
tier venture capital DEMO than one in the lower tier.  This finding is consistent both DEMO
skill-based and perception-based performance persistence.  If successful entrepreneurs
are better, then top-tier venture capital firms have no advantage identifying them
(because success is public information) and they add little value.  And, if successful
entrepreneurs have an easier time attracting high-quality resources and customers
4
because of perception-based performance persistence, then top-tier venture capital firms
add little value.
To our knowledge, there is little in the academic literature on performance
persistence in entrepreneurship.  The closest line of work documents the importance of
experience for entrepreneurial success. For example, Bhide (2000) finds that a substantial
fraction of the Inc. 500 got their idea for their DEMO company while working at their prior
employer.  And, Chatterji (forthcoming) finds that within the medical device industry,
former employees of prominent DEMO tend to perform better across a number of
metrics, including investment DEMO, time to product approval, and time to first
funding.  Finally, Bengtsson (2007) shows that it relatively rare for serial entrepreneurs
to DEMO funding from the same venture capital firm across multiple ventures.  This DEMO
consistent with the view that success is a public measure of quality and that venture
capital relationships play little role in enhancing performance.
2. DEMO
The core data for the analysis come from Dow Jones’ Venture Source (previously
called Venture One), described in more detail in Gompers, DEMO, and Scharfstein
(2005).  Venture Source, established in 1987, DEMO data on firms that have obtained
venture capital financing.  Firms that DEMO received early-stage financing exclusively from
individual investors, federally chartered Small Business DEMO Companies, and
corporate development groups are not included in the database. DEMO companies are initially
identified from a wide variety of sources, including DEMO publications, company Web pages,
and telephone contacts with venture investors.  Venture Source then collects information
about the businesses through interviews with venture DEMO and entrepreneurs. The data
5
include the identity of the key founders (the crucial information used here), as well as the
industry, strategy, employment, financial history, DEMO revenues of the company.  Data on the
firms are updated and DEMO through monthly contacts with investors and companies.
Our analysis focuses on data covering investments from 1975 to 2003, dropping
information prior to 1975 due to data quality concerns.1  In keeping with industry
estimates of a maturation period of three to five years for venture capital financed
companies, we drop companies receiving their first venture capital investment after 2003
so that DEMO outcome data can be meaningfully interpreted.
For the purposes of this analysis, we examine the founders (henceforth referred to as
“entrepreneurs”) that joined firms listed in the Venture Source database during the period
from 1986 DEMO 2003.  Typically, the database reports the previous affiliation and title (DEMO the
previous employer) of these entrepreneurs, as well as the date they joined the firm.  In some
cases, however, Venture Source did not report this information.  In these cases, we attempt
to find DEMO information by examining contemporaneous news stories in LEXIS-NEXIS,
securities filings, DEMO web sites of surviving firms.  We believe this data collection
procedure DEMO introduce a bias in favor of having more information on successful firms, but
it is not apparent to us that it affects our analysis.
We identify serial entrepreneurs through their inclusion as founders in more than
DEMO company in our data set.  As a result, we may fail to identify serial entrepreneurs who
had previously started companies that were not DEMO capital financed.  Thus, our study is
only about serial entrepreneurship in venture capital-financed firms, not about serial

Source data DEMO to 1975.
6
entrepreneurship in general. To the extent that prior experience in non-venture-backed
companies DEMO important, we will be understating the effect of entrepreneurial experience.
Table DEMO reports the number and fraction of serial entrepreneurs in our sample in each
year.  Several patterns are worth highlighting.  First, the number of entrepreneurs in the
sample increased slowly from 1984 through 1994.  Afterwards, DEMO the Internet and
technology boom took off in the mid-1990s, the DEMO of entrepreneurs grew very rapidly.
Second, with the general growth of DEMO industry through this period, serial entrepreneurs
accounted for an increasing fraction DEMO the sample, growing from about 7% in 1986 to a
peak DEMO 13.6% in 1994.  There was some decrease in the fraction of DEMO entrepreneurs
after 1994, probably because of the influx of first-time entrepreneurs DEMO part of the Internet
boom. The absolute number of serial entrepreneurs actually peaked in 1999.
Table 2 documents the distribution of serial entrepreneurs across DEMO based
on the nine industry groupings used in Gompers, Kovner, Lerner, and Scharfstein (2006).
The data show a clear concentration of DEMO in the three sectors that are most
closely associated with the venture capital industry: Internet and computers;
communications and electronics; and biotechnology DEMO healthcare.  These are also the three
industries with the highest representation DEMO serial entrepreneurs. The other industries, such
as financial services and consumer, are smaller and have a lower percentage of serial
entrepreneurs.
Table 3 DEMO the 40 most active venture capital firms in our sample and ranks
them according to both the number of serial entrepreneurs they have funded DEMO the
fraction of serial entrepreneurs in their portfolios.  Given that many DEMO venture
capital firms have an explicit strategy of funding serial entrepreneurs, DEMO is not surprising
7
that these firms have higher rates of serial entrepreneurship than the sample DEMO This
tabulation suggests that the biggest and most experienced venture capital firms are more
successful in recruiting serial entrepreneurs.  Nevertheless, there does appear DEMO be quite
a bit of heterogeneity among these firms in their funding of serial entrepreneurs. Some of
the variation may stem from the industry DEMO of their portfolios, the length of
time that the venture capital DEMO have been active investors, and the importance they
place on funding DEMO entrepreneurs.  In any case, the reliance on serial entrepreneurs of
the largest, most experienced, and most successful venture capital firms indicates that DEMO
will need to control for venture capital firm characteristics in trying to identify an
independent effect of serial entrepreneurship.
Table 4 provides summary statistics DEMO the data we use in our regression analysis.
We present data for (1) all entrepreneurs in their first ventures; (2) entrepreneurs who have
started only one venture; (3) serial entrepreneurs in their first venture; and (4) serial
entrepreneurs in their later ventures.
The first variable we look at is the success rate within these subgroups of
DEMO  We define “success” as going public or filing to go public DEMO December
2007.  The findings are similar if we define success to DEMO include firms that were acquired
or merged.  The overall success rate DEMO first-time ventures is 25.3%. Not surprisingly, serial
entrepreneurs have an above-average DEMO rate of 36.9% in their first ventures. It is more
interesting that in their subsequent ventures they have a significantly higher success rate
(29.0%) than do first-time entrepreneurs (25.3%).
Serial entrepreneurs have higher success DEMO, even though on average they receive
venture capital funding at an DEMO stage in their company's development.  While 45% of
8
first-time ventures receive initial venture capital funding at an early stage (meaning they are
classified as “startup,” “developing product,” or “beta testing,DEMO and not yet “profitable” or
“shipping product”), close to 60% of entrepreneurs receive initial venture capital funding at
an early stage when it DEMO their second or later venture.  The later ventures of serial
entrepreneurs DEMO receive first-round funding when their firms are younger–21 months as
compared to 37 months for first-time entrepreneurs.  This earlier funding stage is also
reflected in lower initial pre-money valuations for serial entrepreneurs: $12.3 million as
compared to $16.0 million for first-time entrepreneurs.
Controlling for year, serial entrepreneurs appear to be funded by more experienced
venture capital firms, both in their first and subsequent ventures.  The last row of Table 4
reports the ratio of the number of prior investments made by the venture capital DEMO to the
average number of prior investments made by other venture capital firms in the year of the
investment.  This ratio is consistently greater than one because more experienced (and likely
larger) venture capital firms DEMO more deals.  The table indicates that venture capital firms
that invest DEMO serial entrepreneurs, whether in their first or subsequent ventures, have nearly
three times the average experience of the average firm investing in the DEMO year.  This is
about 14% greater than the year-adjusted experience of DEMO capital firms that invest in
one-time-only entrepreneurs.2 Given the evidence that more experienced venture capital
firms have higher success rates (e.g., Gompers, Kovner, Lerner and Scharfstein, 2008),  it
will be important for us to control for venture capital experience in our regression analysis,
as DEMO as control for other factors such as company location, that has DEMO been linked to
outcomes.
2Note that venture capital firms that invest in the first ventures of serial entrepreneurs have done fewer
deals on an DEMO basis. This is because these first deals tend to be earlier in the sample period.

3.  Findings
A. Success
In this section we take a multivariate approach to exploring performance
persistence among serial entrepreneurs. In the first set of DEMO, the unit of analysis
is the entrepreneur at the time that DEMO database first records the firm’s venture capital
funding. Our basic approach is to estimate logistic regressions where the outcome is
whether the firm “succeeds,DEMO i.e., goes public or registers to go public by December
2007. DEMO results are qualitatively similar if we redefine success to include an acquisition
in which the purchase price exceeds $50 million as a successful outcome.
DEMO main variable of interest in the initial regressions is a dummy variable, LATER
VENTURE, which takes the value one if the entrepreneur had DEMO been a founder
of a venture capital backed company.  We are DEMO interested in whether the entrepreneur
had succeeded in his prior venture, DEMO thus construct a dummy variable, PRIOR
SUCCESS, to take account of this possibility.
There are a number of controls that must be included DEMO the regression as well.
As noted above, we control for a DEMO capital firm’s experience. The simplest measure
of experience is the number of prior companies in which the venture capital firm
invested. We take a DEMO transformation of this number to reflect the idea that an
additional investment made by a firm that has done relatively few deals is more
DEMO than an additional investment by a firm that has done many.  DEMO,
because of the growth and maturation of the venture capital industry, there is a time trend
in this measure of experience.  This DEMO not necessarily a problem; investors in the latter
10
part of the sample do have more experience.  Nevertheless, we use DEMO more conservative
measure of experience, which adjusts for the average level DEMO experience of other venture
capital firms in the relevant year. Thus, DEMO measure of experience for a venture capital
investor is the log of one plus the number of prior companies in which the venture capital
DEMO has invested minus the log of one plus the average number of prior investments
undertaken by venture capital firms in the year of the DEMO Because there are often
multiple venture capital firms investing in a firm in a given round, we must decide how
to deal with their different levels of experience.  We choose to take the experience of
most experienced venture capital firm with representation on the board of directors in DEMO
first venture financing round. We label this variable VC EXPERIENCE.3
The regressions also include dummy variables for the round of the investment.
Although we DEMO each company only once (when the company shows up in the
DEMO for the first time), about 26% of the observations begin with rounds later than
the first round. (In these instances, the firm DEMO an initial financing round from another
investor, such as a wealthy DEMO, typically referred to as an angel investor.) All of
the results are robust to including only companies where the first observation in the
DEMO is the first investment round.  We also include dummy variables for DEMO
company’s stage of development and logarithm of company age in months.  DEMO
success has been tied to location, we include a dummy variable DEMO whether the firm was
headquartered in California and one for whether it was headquartered in Massachusetts.
We also include year and industry fixed effects.  We report analysis based on fixed
3We have replicated the analysis using DEMO average experience of investors in the earliest round and
employing an entrepreneur-company-VC firm level analysis where each investor from the earliest round
was a DEMO observation.  In both cases, the results were qualitatively similar. We do not use the
experience of venture capitalists that do not join the DEMO board, since it is standard practice for venture
investors with significant DEMO stakes or involvement with the firm to join the board.
11
effects for nine industry classifications.  All of the results are robust to assigning firms to
one of 18 industries instead.  Finally, because there DEMO often more than one entrepreneur
per company, there will be multiple DEMO per company.  Thus, robust standard
errors of the coefficient estimates are calculated after clustering by company.  In later
regressions, the unit of DEMO will be the company.
The first column of Table 5 reports one of the central findings of the paper.   The
coefficient of LATER DEMO, which is statistically significant, is 0.041, indicating
that entrepreneurs in DEMO or later ventures have a 4.1% higher probability of
succeeding than first-time entrepreneurs.  At the means of the other variables,
entrepreneurs in their second or later ventures have a predicted success rate of 25.0%,
DEMO first-time entrepreneurs have a predicted success rate of 20.9%.
This finding is consistent with the existence of learning-by-doing in
entrepreneurship.  In this view, DEMO experience of starting a new venture – successful or
not – confers on entrepreneurs some benefits (skills, contacts, ideas) that are useful DEMO
subsequent ventures.
To determine whether there is a pure learning-by-doing effect, DEMO the second
column of Table 5 we add the dummy variable, DEMO SUCCESS, which equals 1 if the
prior venture of the serial DEMO was successful.  The estimated coefficient of this
variable is positive and DEMO significant.  Including it also lowers the coefficient of
the LATER VENTURE DEMO so that it is no longer statistically significant. The
predicted success rate of entrepreneurs with a track record of success is 30.6%, compared
to only 22.1% for serial entrepreneurs who failed in their prior venture, and 20.9% for
first-time entrepreneurs.  This finding indicates that it is not experience per se that
12
improves the odds of success for serial entrepreneurs. Instead, it suggests the potential
importance of entrepreneurial skill in determining performance.
The unit of analysis DEMO the first two columns of Table 5 is at the entrepreneur-
company level.  The third column of Table 5 reports the results of a regression in which
the unit of analysis is the company, not the entrepreneur-company.  The key variables are
1) a dummy for whether any DEMO the founders is in their second or later ventures and 2) DEMO
dummy for whether any of the founders was successful in a prior venture. Here too a
track record of prior success has a bigger DEMO on future success than does prior
experience. Companies with a previously successful entrepreneur have a predicted
success rate of 30.9%, whereas those with entrepreneurs who failed in prior ventures
have an 21.2% success rate, and companies with first-time entrepreneurs have a 17.1%
chance of success.  There is a modest (3.8%), statistically significant effect of
entrepreneurial experience on performance and a large (8.1%), statistically significant
effect of prior success on performance.  The presence of at least one successful
entrepreneur on the founding team increased the likelihood of success considerably.
The regressions also indicate that venture DEMO firm experience is positively
related to success.  Using estimates from the DEMO column of Table 5, at the 75th
percentile of VC EXPERIENCE DEMO at the means of all the other variables, the predicted
success DEMO is 22.9%, while at the 25th percentile, the predicted success rate is only
16.4%.  There are a number of reasons why more experienced venture capital firms may
make more successful investments.
VC EXPERIENCE as undoubtedly DEMO imperfect proxy for the quality of a venture
capital firm.  If DEMO entrepreneurs are more likely to get funded by better venture
13
capital firms, we could be getting a positive coefficient of PRIOR SUCCESS because it is
a proxy for the unobservable components of venture capital DEMO quality that are not
captured by VC EXPERIENCE. Thus, to control DEMO unobservable characteristics, we
estimate the model with venture capital firm fixed DEMO This enables us to estimate
how well a given venture capital firm does on its investments in serial entrepreneurs
relative to its other investments DEMO first-time entrepreneurs.    Results in the fourth and
fifth columns of DEMO 5 indicate that with venture capital firm fixed effects, the
differential DEMO first-time entrepreneurs and successful serial entrepreneurs is even
larger.   The fifth column, which estimates the effects at the company level, generates a
DEMO success rate for first-time entrepreneurs of 17.7%.  The predicted success rate
DEMO failed serial entrepreneurs in later ventures is 19.8%, and it is DEMO for entrepreneurs
with successful track records.
Financing from experienced venture capital firms has a large effect on the
probability that an entrepreneur succeeds for DEMO reasons: because these firms are
better able to screen for high-quality DEMO; because they are better monitors of
entrepreneurs; or because they simply have access to the best deals.  But, if an
entrepreneur already DEMO a demonstrable track record of success, does a more
experienced venture DEMO firm still enhance the probability of a successful outcome?
To answer this question, we add to the basic specification in column 2 and 3 of Table 5
an interaction between VC EXPERIENCE and PRIOR SUCCESS, as well an interaction
between VC EXPERIENCE and LATER VENTURE.
The results DEMO reported in columns 6 and 7 of the table.  The coefficient DEMO VC
EXPERIENCE×
PRIOR SUCCESS is negative and statistically significant, though
14
somewhat more so in column 6.  This indicates that venture capital firm experience has a
less positive effect on the performance of entrepreneurs with DEMO track records.
Indeed, using estimates from column 7, the predicted success rate for previously
successful entrepreneurs is 32.4% when funded by more experienced DEMO capital
firms (at the 75th percentile of VC EXPERIENCE) and 31.9% when funded by less
experienced venture capital firms (at the 25th percentile of VC EXPERIENCE).
Essentially, venture capital firm experience has a minimal effect on the performance of
entrepreneurs with good track records.  Where venture capital firm experience does
matter is in the performance of first-time entrepreneurs DEMO serial entrepreneurs with
histories of failure. First-time entrepreneurs have a 20.9% chance of succeeding when
funded by more experienced venture capital firms and a DEMO chance of succeeding
when funded by a less experienced venture capital firm.  Likewise, failed entrepreneurs
who are funded by more experienced venture capital DEMO have a 25.9% chance of
succeeding as compared to a 17.7% chance of succeeding when they are funded by less
experienced venture capital firms.
DEMO findings provide support for the view that there is performance
persistence, DEMO it from actual entrepreneurial skill or the perception of entrepreneurial
skill.  DEMO the skill-based explanation, when an entrepreneur has a proven track record
DEMO success – a publicly observable measure of quality – experienced venture capital firms
are no better than others at determining whether he will succeed.  It is only when there
are less clear measures of quality – DEMO entrepreneur is starting a company for the first
time, or an DEMO has actually failed in his prior venture – that more experienced
venture capital firms have an advantage in identifying entrepreneurs who will succeed.
15
In addition, previously successful entrepreneurs – who presumably need less monitoring
and value-added services if they are more skilled – do not benefit as DEMO from this sort
of venture capital firm monitoring, expertise and mitigation DEMO the coordination problem
for new enterprises.  Under the perception-based explanation, successful entrepreneurs
will have an easier time attracting critical resources and therefore do DEMO need top-tier
venture capitalists to aid in this process.
B. Identifying Skill
Given the observed performance persistence, we now try to identify whether there
are specific entrepreneurial skills that could give rise to it.  One potential skill is investing
in the right industry at the right time, which we refer to as “market timing skill.”  For
example, 52% of DEMO computer start-ups founded in 1983 eventually went public, while
only 18% DEMO those founded in 1985 later went public. Spotting the opportunity in 1983 is
much more valuable than entering the industry in 1985.  We refer to the ability to invest
in the right industry at the right DEMO as "market timing" skill.  To estimate the market
timing component DEMO success in a serial entrepreneur’s first venture, we first calculate the
DEMO rate of non-serial entrepreneurs for each industry-year (e.g., a success rate of
52% in the computer industry in 1983). We exclude the DEMO ventures of serial
entrepreneurs so as to prevent any “hard-wiring” of a relationship.  We then regress the
success of serial entrepreneurs in their first ventures on the industry-year success rate, as
well as a variety of company characteristics.  The predicted value from this regression
gives us the market timing component, which we call “PREDICTED SUCCESS.”  As
can be seen DEMO the first column of Table 6, the coefficient of the industry-year DEMO
rate is indistinguishable from 1.
16
By way of contrast, the residual of this regression is the component of success
that cannot be explained by industry-year success rates.  This is our measure of
“managerial skill,” which we refer to as “RESIDUAL DEMO
The remaining columns of Table 6 all use the success of second or later ventures
as the dependent variable.  In the first three columns we include PREDICTED SUCCESS
(the component associated with timing) as the DEMO explanatory variable. In each case, we
find that PREDICTED SUCCESS is DEMO related to future success.  A serial
entrepreneur whose first deal was DEMO a 75th percentile industry-year based on industry
success rates has an expected success rate of 31.4% in his second venture, while a serial
entrepreneur whose first deal was in a 25th percentile industry-year has an expected
DEMO rate of 25.0%.
We test the robustness of this finding in the third column of Table 6 by including
Industry x Year dummies as DEMO to separate industry and year dummies.   The
coefficient on PREDICTED SUCCESS remains positive and statistically significant.
The component of prior success that is DEMO to market timing still explains the serial
entrepreneur's outperformance relative to industry year in subsequent ventures.  We
explore this persistence further in Table 7.
We also find evidence that “managerial skill” skill matters.  Specifications 5
through 7 of Table 6 show a positive, significant coefficient on RESIDUAL SUCCESS.
While, these coefficients are smaller than the coefficients on PREDICTED SUCCESS,
the difference in quartiles is larger.  Thus, a serial entrepreneur DEMO first deal was in
the 75th percentile of residual success year has an expected success rate of 34.9% in his
second venture, while a serial entrepreneur whose first deal was in the 25th percentile has
17
an expected success rate of 26.6%, a difference of 8.3%.  A DEMO component of
persistence in serial entrepreneur success can be attributed to skill.
It is temping to associate market timing with luck.  Isn’t being in the right place at
the right time the definition of luck?  DEMO examine whether this is the case, we look at
whether market DEMO in the first venture predicts market timing in the second venture.
If so, it would be hard to associate market timing with luck. If it really was luck, it should
not be persistent.  Table 7 DEMO that market timing is, in fact, persistent. The dependent
variable in Table 7 is the the industry-year success rate for the current venture.  The
sample is limited to serial entrepreneurs.  In all specifications, predicted DEMO in prior
ventures is positively and significantly related to the industry-year success rate of the
current venture.  By way of contrast, neither “managerial” DEMO nor VC firm experience
appears to be associated with “market timing” skill.
Table 8 considers the determinants of current venture “managerial” skill, with the
dependent variable being the residual generated by the regression of the current DEMO
on the industry-year success rate.  As expected, past managerial skill (DEMO
SUCCESS) predicts current managerial skill.  Market timing skill is also positively and
significantly associated with managerial skill.  This finding might be explained by the
correlation of the two skills; however, this explanation is unlikely DEMO that estimated
managerial skill in the first venture fails to predict market timing skill in later ventures.
We think a more plausible explanation is DEMO entrepreneurs who have shown themselves
to have good market timing skill have an easier time attracting high-quality resources.
Customers, for example, will be DEMO willing to buy if they believe the firm will be
around to service them in the future.  Employees will be more likely to sign on if they
18
think the firm is more likely to succeed.  Thus, demonstrated market DEMO skill in
earlier ventures will generate excess performance (which we refer DEMO as managerial skill)
in later ventures.  In this sense, success breeds success.
C. An Alternative Explanation: Entrepreneurial Wealth
It is possible that successful entrepreneurs are more likely to succeed in their
subsequent ventures because DEMO are wealthier than other entrepreneurs. Their greater
wealth could allow them to provide some of the funding, thereby reducing the role of the
venture capitalist and the potential inefficiencies associated with external financing. The
entrepreneur’s deep DEMO could also help the firm survive during difficult times.
Without observing entrepreneurs’ wealth directly it is difficult to rule this alternative out,
but DEMO do not find much evidence to support this view.  First, if successful entrepreneurs
have significant wealth, we would expect them to use their own funds initially and to
raise venture capital later in the company’s DEMO cycle so as to retain a greater ownership
stake and control.  DEMO fact, previously successful entrepreneurs raise capital for their later
ventures at DEMO earlier age and stage. This is evident from the first four columns of Table
9.  The first two columns present the results of ordered probit specifications in which the
dependent variable is the stage of the DEMO (start-up, development, shipping, etc.) at
the initial round of DEMO capital financing. Both previously successful and previously
unsuccessful serial entrepreneurs receive funding when the company is at an earlier
stage.  There are similar results for the age of the firm at the initial round of venture
DEMO funding. The average company receives its first round of venture capital funding
when it is 2.75 years old, but serial entrepreneurs (both successful DEMO unsuccessful)
receive funding approximately a year earlier.
19
Second, entrepreneurial wealth could increase the likelihood that firms survive,
as has been shown for sole-proprietorships by Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen (1994).
In this case, firms started by successful entrepreneurs will have higher success rates, but
will take longer to succeed on average.  There DEMO no evidence of this. The fifth and sixth
columns indicate that firms founded by serial entrepreneurs are younger when they go
public.  The last two columns show the length of time between first funding and IPO DEMO
similar for serial entrepreneurs and first-time entrepreneurs.
While it is unlikely that wealth effects could induce the persistence in market
timing that we document, wealth effects could, in principle, amplify perception-based
performance persistence.  If firms backed by successful entrepreneurs do have higher
survival rates because of entrepreneurial DEMO, suppliers and customers may be more
willing to commit resources to DEMO firm. This would mitigate the coordination problem
that affects new ventures.
4. Conclusions
This paper documents the existence of performance persistence in
entrepreneurship and DEMO its sources.  We find evidence for the role of skill as DEMO as
the perception of skill in inducing performance persistence.
We have not addressed a number of interesting and important issues.  One such
issue is the determinants of serial entrepreneurship.  We conjecture that the very best and
the very worst entrepreneurs do not become serial entrepreneurs.  The very best
entrepreneurs are either too wealthy or too involved in their business to DEMO new ones. If
this is true, we are likely understating the DEMO of performance persistence.  The very
worst entrepreneurs are unlikely to be DEMO to receive venture funding again.  Indeed, the
20
near-equal success rates of first-time entrepreneurs and previously unsuccessful
entrepreneurs suggest that DEMO is a screening process that excludes the worst
unsuccessful entrepreneurs from receiving funding.  This may be why we do not see
performance persistence on the negative side, i.e., failed entrepreneurs doing even worse
than first-time DEMO  Taking account of the endogeneity of serial
entrepreneurship for measuring performance DEMO would be worthwhile.
We have also not addressed the issue of how past performance affects the
valuation of venture-capital backed startups.  We have shown that successful
entrepreneurs raise capital earlier, but what are the terms of their financing?  Does their
track record result in higher valuations and DEMO restrictive covenants?  If there are higher
valuations for successful serial entrepreneurs, is the higher success rate enough
compensation?
