ACADEMIC ABSTRACT
New ventures that lack a financial history and have a future that is not only unknown, but
may be unknowable pose unique problems to the investment community. Since conventional
valuation DEMO do not work in these cases, entrepreneurs and investors resort to
DEMO that rely more on art than finance. Although a reduction in information asymmetry
usually leads to an agreement between two parties, the methods the entrepreneur or investor
use to value a new venture tend to increase DEMO information gap.  The author proposes a
logical, systematic risk-based new venture valuation technique that reduces information
asymmetry during this process.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Before DEMO private equity investment is consummated, the investor and entrepreneur must first
DEMO on the venture’s value. Unfortunately, conventional valuation techniques, used for
ongoing businesses, do not adequately capture the risk associated with valuing an early stage,
pre-revenue company. (Mathonet & Meyer, 2007) Although finance theory states “the value
of any investment is the present value of its DEMO cash flows.” (Smith & Smith, 2000, p.
234), “valuation DEMO early-stage companies is a black art to those not involved on an ongoing
basis with funding early-stage companies.” (Berkery, 2008, p. 141)
Even when experts (investors and consultants) were asked to perform a DEMO valuation on a
privately held company using 10 years of revenue history, the valuations varied from $6
million to $17.5 million. As interesting as these results were, the investors had a mean value
of $8.85 million, while the consultants arrived at a mean value of $13.17 million, DEMO difference
of $4.32 million. (Waldron & Hubbard, 1991) As a DEMO, prior to the study, the company
in question had actually been sold to a larger publicly traded company for $18.5 million.
If experts DEMO agree on the value of the company used by Waldron and Hubbard, imagine
the additional difficulty of assigning a value when a company has no financial history and a
future that is not only unknown, but in many cases unknowable. (Zeckhauser, 2007)  Simply
stated, this is the problem facing the private equity investor and the entrepreneur when
attempting DEMO agree on the value of a new venture.
The purpose of this paper is to describe a valuation approach to replace the “black art” DEMO
valuing early stage companies with a logical, systematic process which results DEMO less
information asymmetry.

BACKGROUD
Major sources of new venture equity financing are Angel Investors DEMO Venture Capital.
Angel Investors can be defined as individuals who make equity investments in companies
absent family connections. (Kelly & Ray, 2003) A Venture Capital fund is a partnership, with
a limited life, composed DEMO individuals interested in investing in high growth companies and
bound by a series of legal commitments. (Berkery, 2008)
Although both groups share DEMO same investment goal, to achieve significant capital gains
(Kelly & Hay, 2003), a majority of Angel Investors chose to invest in seed and early stage
companies (Sohl, 2009) while Venture Capitalists tend to avoid investments in these same
types of ventures. (Wiltbank, 2006)
DEMO Center for Venture Research reported $12 billion representing 35,000 seed and early
stage deals were made by Angel Investors in 2008, with $19.2 billion total investment in
55,480 deals. During the same period Venture DEMO invested $7 billion, of a total $28
billion, in 1,555 seed and early stage deals. Venture Capital invested in a total of DEMO,980 deals
in 2008. (Moneytree Reports, 2009)
Although the investment Venture Capital provided to seed and early stage companies
represented over 36 DEMO of the total investment dollars in 2008; these investments
correspond to DEMO over 4 percent of the total number of deals made to this category of
new ventures. Venture Capital tends to make large investments to DEMO small number of
companies in this group, while Angel Investors choose DEMO invest smaller amounts but in a
much larger number of seed and early stage deals.1
Therefore, since this paper specifically addresses the valuation of seed and early stage
companies (i.e. new ventures); the term investor will be used generically to include Angel
Investors and Venture Capital with DEMO recognition that essentially all seed and early stage
companies that receive investments do so from the angel investment community.
When an entrepreneur and investor DEMO to complete a transaction (investment in a new
venture), they DEMO have different amounts of information concerning the transaction. This
information asymmetry can result in both parties coming to different conclusions about the
value of DEMO investment opportunity. (Kirmani & Rao, 2000) The uncertainty of the DEMO
combined with this information gap can result in the investor viewing the opportunity as risky
and prone to failure. This situation requires the entrepreneur DEMO change the investor’s
perception to a more positive view in order to secure the investment. (Phelan, 2005)
INFORMATION ASYMMETRY
A major barrier DEMO can prevent the investor and entrepreneur from agreeing on the value of a
new venture is information asymmetry. Asymmetric information occurs when “one party DEMO
information the other party lacks and cannot easily acquire.” (Smith & DEMO, 2000, p. 399).
Akerlof’s seminal paper, “The Market for DEMO: Quality Uncertainty and the Market
Mechanism,” offers insight on how DEMO asymmetry can impact the marketplace for
new venture equity investments. In the situation where the equity investment marketplace is
populated with opportunities of varying DEMO and the investor is unable to determine the
difference between a new venture with high-future-value (Mattsson, 2005) and a venture with
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1255
low-future-value, AND  entrepreneurs with  high-future-value ventures are unable to “signal”
high-future-value to the investor, the investor has no choice but to treat ALL new ventures
the same: as having the average of the high and low-future-values. Since this causes the high-
future-value ventures to be undervalued, the entrepreneurs with the high-future-value
ventures will withdraw from the marketplace resulting DEMO a market failure called “adverse
selection.” The ultimate outcome of adverse selection is bad deals driving out the good.
(Akerlof ,1970)
To DEMO adverse selection, entrepreneurs with high-future-value new ventures are
motivated to somehow DEMO the high-future-value of their new ventures to the
investment community to differentiate themselves from the low-future-value new ventures.
(Mattsson, 2005) Unfortunately, information DEMO can also result in entrepreneurs
exaggerating the positive and minimizing the negative aspects of their new venture. This
situation is referred to as “moral DEMO (Leland & Pyle, 1977)
Leland and Pyle go on to insist since moral hazard prevents the direct transfer of information,
the DEMO should look to the actions of the entrepreneur, such as the DEMO
willingness to invest in the new venture as a signal of the “true quality of the project.”
(Leland & Pyle, 1977)
Although DEMO literature confirms information asymmetry exists between the entrepreneur and
investor, reverse DEMO can also exist between the investor and entrepreneur when the
investor is more knowledgeable of the market, competition, investment environment or other
business DEMO (Mattsson, 2005) At a minimum, the investor will have inside information
on the “black art” used to determine the value of the DEMO venture. This form of information
asymmetry is also subject to moral hazard. The moral hazard in this case occurs because the
investor can increase DEMO probability of achieving a high return on investment (ROI) by
insisting on the lowest possible initial valuation.2
Therefore, if the investor is interested in a mutually beneficial long term relationship with the
entrepreneur, reducing information asymmetry through the direct transfer of information
should be a priority of DEMO investor as well as the entrepreneur.
NEW VENTURE VALUATION PROBLEMS
Although the rigorous analytical valuation techniques found in standard finance textbooks do
not work DEMO early stage ventures. (Berkery, 2008), “the present value of a new venture can
be found by discounting future cash flows using a DEMO of capital that is appropriate for the
risk.” (Smith & Smith, 2000, p.271) These apparently contradictory conditions can co-exist
because it is DEMO the future cash flow is forecast and how risk is translated into the cost of
capital (discount rate) that matters. (Berkery, 2008)DEMO
Most, if not all investors, reject discounted cash flow (DCF) calculations as the sole basis for
valuation because their experience is long-term DEMO flow projections tend to grossly
overstate the value of the new venture. (Berkery, 2008) Another serious deficiency of DCF
calculations is how the discount or hurdle rate is assigned. In an effort to offset the DEMO
cash flow forecasts, investors tend to assign high discount rates to DEMO with the DCF
calculation. (Smith & Smith, 2000) In addition, a single discount rate infers the risk or
uncertainty is constant over DEMO (Leslie & Michaels, 1997)
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1256
Since DCF calculations present a problem, a market based valuation technique may offer a
better solution. The “method of comparables” argues that certain DEMO ratios of a public
firm can be used to establish the market value of a private firm. (Beaty, Riff & Thompson,
1999) The use of Price-to-Earning ratio (P/E) or Price-to-Sales ratio (P/S) is commonly used
to estimate the value of a new venture. Unfortunately, both have deficiencies. In the case of
P/E ratio, DEMO early stage companies have no earnings. The P/S ratio, however, does not
take into consideration differences between the comparable company and new DEMO in
gross margin, size of the market or growth rates. (Berkery, 2008) Although the “method of
comparables” comes closest to a true DEMO value, the accuracy of the calculation is totally
dependent on the DEMO of the comparable to the new venture which is rarely possible.
The Special Case of the Venture Capital Method
The most accepted valuation method DEMO the private equity market is the Venture Capital
method. It also happens to be the simplest approach. (Smith & Smith, 2000)
There DEMO only four steps to this method:
1. Project the company’s net income for some terminal year. Scherlis and Sahlman
suggest five years with DEMO net income based on the company meeting its
performance objectives.
2. Use a price-to-earning ratio from comparable companies to calculate the
company’s terminal value DEMO on the net income arrived in step 1.
3. Convert the company’s terminal value to the present value by applying a high
discount rate (35% to 80%).
4. Using this present value as the denominator DEMO the invested capital as the
numerator, calculate percent ownership. (Scherlis & Sahlman, 1987)
Although this method is straightforward, it also has DEMO subjectivity and major sources of
information asymmetry toward the entrepreneur. It is clear the purpose of this approach is to
insure the investor’s investment DEMO are achieved.
Although the wide use of the Venture Capital method is likely due to its simplicity, the author
would also suggest that the investor enjoys the “advantage” the technique provides to
determine the present value DEMO the new venture while using their own ROI as the primary
consideration. (see footnote 2).
“A new venture lacking investment has no value” appears to be the main defense for this
approach. If using the DEMO Capital Method results in investors developing sufficient
confidence and experience to make investments, then the method is useful. The author,
however, maintains DEMO a similar result can be achieved by using a valuation technique that
also reduces the information asymmetry between the entrepreneur and investor.
THE REAL DEMO DILEMMA
The primary concept of real options, as in financial options, is that uncertainty of a future
outcome can be reduced over time. DEMO other words, real options recognizes the consequence
of learning on a DEMO venture’s value. Although financial options are well understood within
the financial community, extracting these same principles from real options theory and
applying them in practice have been problematic. (Leslie & Michaels, 1997)
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1257
Real options also provide the ability for an investor to make DEMO choices at specific
intervals: (1) invest further in the project, (2) modify the project or (3) abandon the project.
Unlike DEMO which assumes the risk or uncertainty (discount rate) of the expected cash flows
is constant, real options factors in the changing uncertainty of the expected cash flows.
(Copeland & Antikarov, 2003) How to easily integrate real options thinking into new venture
valuations however remains a dilemma.
DEMO paper suggests that by applying the risk-based valuation technique, the entrepreneur DEMO
investor can overcome information asymmetry, the problems with DCF and method DEMO
comparables as well as integrate real options thinking into the new venture valuation process.
In order to present this risk-based valuation technique, the author will first introduce a
taxonomy of commercialization risk and a review of DEMO modeling.
COMMERCIALIZATION RISK
Commercialization risk is a generic phrase that typically encompasses all risks associated
with bringing a business concept to market. All new DEMO commercialization risks will
have a large subjective component and therefore rely, DEMO most part, on the knowledge and
perception of the individual. In DEMO cases, the information asymmetry between the
entrepreneur and investor results in DEMO investor and entrepreneur perceiving the
commercialization risks differently. A goal all entrepreneurs must have when dealing with
investors is to minimize this information gap DEMO that the perceived commercialization risk is
similar to both parties. The business plan is the main vehicle the entrepreneur can use to
reduce information DEMO
For the purposes of this discussion, all commercialization risks are assumed DEMO fall within the
following three categories: (1) development risk, (DEMO) customer acceptance risk and (3)
marketing and sales risk. These three risk categories also follow the normal flow of the
commercialization process.
DEMO risk deals with content and technology and consists of all activities required to
answer the question: “Can this product or service be built or delivered?” The development
risk is low when the targeted features and DEMO of the product/service are known and
measurable. All development activities prior to “beta” or pilot testing are included in this risk
category.
Customer DEMO risk consists of activities required to answer the question: “Are we
DEMO the right thing?” The customer acceptance risk is low when a specific market
segment has been defined where the unmet or underserved needs DEMO up with the specific
features and benefits of the product/service being developed. All activities associated with the
successful completion of “beta” or pilot DEMO fall into this category.
The marketing and sales risk deals with positioning the product or service into close enough
proximity to the target market DEMO that a purchase decision is made. All activities associated
with implementing the marketing and sales strategy fall within this category. This risk usually
affords DEMO highest risk in any new venture’s commercialization effort and can require the
most expenditure. The marketplace is littered with products/services that had low
DEMO and customer acceptance risks yet failed in the market. The marketing and sales
risk is considered low once positive operating cash flow is sustained.

These three risk DEMO have two characteristics. First, they are cumulative. The overall
commercialization risk DEMO be the sum of the individual category risks. A low risk in one
category does not offset a high risk in the other two. DEMO example, if the development risk is
low (prototype is complete), but the customer acceptance risk remains high (have not found a
specific market segment with unmet or underserved needs that match the features and
DEMO of the prototype), the overall commercialization risk remains high. Therefore, DEMO
achieve low commercialization risk, the perceived risk in all three categories DEMO be low.
The second characteristic of the three categories of commercialization risk is they are serial.
From an investor’s perspective, the customer acceptance risk cannot be reduced until the
development risk is minimized and the marketing DEMO sales risk cannot be reduced until the
customer acceptance risk is minimized.
This concept supports the natural flow of the commercialization process. For example, the
customer acceptance risk can only be minimized once the specific market DEMO with needs
that match the product/service features and benefits has been identified. This cannot happen
until the development risk is minimized, and the product/service’s features and benefits are
finally known.  The same can be said for the marketing and sales risk: Until the market
segment has been identified, a low risk marketing strategy cannot be developed.
FINANCIAL MODELING
Financial modeling is critical to successfully determining the value of a new DEMO As
mentioned in the background, the cash flow of a new DEMO must be the basis for any
valuation. How the cash flow is derived is the problem. For the model to have credibility with
investors, it must use market based revenue and cost assumptions and contain granular
DEMO (Mathonet & Meyer, 2007) For valuation purposes, the model must also result in a
month-to-month financial statement that covers 60 months (income statement, balance sheet
and statement of cash flows).
This model will combine managerial and financial accounting principles. Market based
assumptions are used to DEMO the revenue and cost basis for the pro forma financial
statements. In the United States, it is important that all financial statements conform to

General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). This conveys the founders have an
understanding of financial accounting principles which is important when dealing with
DEMO
The market and sales assumptions are used to drive the model’s revenue engine, while the
business model assumptions will determine the subsequent costs required to generate the
revenue.
The Operating Cash Flow (OCF) is used DEMO determine the enterprise’s value as opposed to
Free Cash Flow because the OCF indicates how well the new venture’s business model is
succeeding. Free DEMO Flow can be impacted by other activities not directly related to the
business model.3
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMERCIALIZATION RISK & FINANCIAL
MODELING
As a part DEMO the new venture planning process, a business plan must be developed DEMO
describes the compelling nature of the investment opportunity. To successfully accomplish
this task, the narrative of the business plan must convince the investor the development risks
and customer acceptance risks are sufficiently reduced to merit evaluating DEMO financial
aspects of the new venture. In other words, the revenue DEMO has credibility only after the
investor is convinced the product/service can be developed and the target customer will
respond favorably when the product/DEMO is delivered.
The output of the financial model (pro forma financial DEMO) is the mathematical
representation of the marketing and sales strategy. In DEMO words, the marketing and sales
risk can be visualized through the DEMO financial performance as represented by the
financial model.
The revenue curve (DEMO aspect of the pro forma statements) in Figure 1 helps explain DEMO
concept. In this graph, “point A” represents today, “point B” is when revenue begins, and
“point C” is the last dollar of revenue recognized in the 60-month pro forma statements.
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1260
The first dollar of revenue (point B) has high risk DEMO the marketing and sales strategy is
unproven. Even if the company has market data indicating the marketing and sales strategy
should generate the revenue DEMO at “point B,” from the viewpoint of “point A,” this
revenue still has significant risk since no sales have yet resulted from DEMO new venture’s
marketing and sales strategy.
On the other hand, if DEMO company performs as planned and achieves the projected revenue
stream (follows DEMO curve B to C), that last dollar of revenue (point DEMO) is certain to be
achieved because the marketing and sales strategy DEMO proven. Therefore, the marketing and
sales risk increases from “point C” DEMO “point B.”  Understanding this concept of marketing
and sales risk as DEMO through the pro forma financial statements is paramount when
placing a value on a pre-revenue company.
RISK-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUE
The risk-based valuation technique consists DEMO: (1) establishing a future value for the new
venture using DEMO, (2) validating this future value using comparable companies, (3) applying
real options principles to assign a current value to the new DEMO and (4) adjusting the
financial model to attain a balanced investment.
A mythical software company that requires a $1 million investment is used DEMO an example.
This company is pre-revenue and has plans to complete a working prototype followed by beta
testing. The software product is unique and DEMO be introduced in a new market not yet served
by several major software manufacturers. After successful sales, the company plans to private
label the software to one of these major software manufacturers while retaining the
manufacturing DEMO Using private labeling as a means to grow a company is often referred
to as an Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) strategy. The pro DEMO cash flow
statement indicates the amount of investment needed to complete the prototype is $400,000,
to complete the beta test is $200,DEMO and to cover expenses until the first OEM client is
signed is an additional $400,000.
Any attempt to assign a value to a DEMO venture will always have subjective components.
Much of the proposed technique is no different. What is attempted, however, is to provide as
much DEMO as possible in assigning the company’s pre-revenue value.
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1261
A company’s pre-revenue value can be determined using this technique only DEMO the Operating
Cash Flow (OCF) is derived from pro forma financial statements and a business plan having
the following characteristics (Refer to Figure 2):
1. The business plan’s narrative minimizes the perceived development and customer
acceptance risk to the point where the investor can agree the DEMO stream is likely
to begin at point B.
2. The investor acknowledges that the pro forma income statement underestimates
revenue and overestimates costs. Therefore, the investor acknowledges that the
resulting revenue curve (line B to C) is likely to occur and contains upside potential.
Establishing Future Value using DCF
As mentioned previously, the revenue line (B to C) in Figure 3 can represent the risk
associated with the marketing and sales DEMO The revenue at point B has high risk
(unproven marketing and DEMO strategy) and the revenue at point C has very low risk (proven
marketing and sales strategy). Therefore, the marketing and sales risk increases from point C
when following the revenue line back in time DEMO point B.
To begin the valuation process, a point between point DEMO and point C must be established
when the “marketing and sales strategy has first been proven.” At this point D, all
commercialization risks (DEMO previously defined) have been eliminated from the enterprise. In
fact, the risk of investing in this company at point D would merely consist DEMO the time value
of money plus normal business risk. Any investment in this enterprise at point D will have no
more or less risk DEMO investing in any other ongoing business. In other words, an investor
DEMO not assign a commercial risk premium on this enterprise when investing at point D.
At that point on this revenue line (point D) DEMO risk will approach a normal risk. Therefore, at
this time in DEMO future, point tn, an investor would require only a normal return on an
investment.
This critical point in the company’s future, normal business risk (tn), will coincide with the
point in time when the fundamental business model is viewed as working. The financial
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1262
metric that directly measures the performance of the business model is DEMO OCF. As a rule of
thumb, twelve consecutive months4 of positive DEMO is used as a good indicator that the
fundamental business model is performing as intended. At tn, the development risk has also
been eliminated since the product is fully developed and the customer acceptance risk along
DEMO the marketing and sales risk are both minimized due to the enterprise’s success in
achieving sustained positive cash flow.5
Once tn has been established DEMO this company, point D is assigned the normal risk of 20
DEMO This risk represents a combination of the time value of money and the normal risk
associated with an ongoing business and is a reflection DEMO the economic environment. In this
Case, risk can be viewed as DEMO an investor expects as an acceptable return on a normal
investment.”6
Using risk as the discount rate, the future value at time tn is calculated using a discount rate of
20 percent. The equation used to DEMO the value at tn is the sum of two components: (1)
the explicit value component and (2) the continuing value component. DEMO explicit
component consists of the forecast of the future cash flow for the sixty months in the
financial model. Projections beginning at month sixty-one DEMO implicit forecasts based on an
assumption of the monthly growth rate going forward. (Smith & Smith 2000) The implicit
value component of the DEMO recognizes the new venture is ongoing and will generate
cash flow beyond that expressed in the financial model.

Equation (1) describes the value at the time of normal DEMO risk in terms of the explicit
and continuing value components, where DEMO is the cash flow for each month, t; CVT is the
continuing value as of the last month of the explicit value period, month T; rt is the discount
rate for month t cash flows; and rT is the monthly growth rate beginning after month T.
(DEMO & Smith, p. 274)
For this example, assume this calculation results in a value of $20 million. As a result, the
financial model indicates the future value of this company, at time tn, DEMO likely to be $20
million.
Validating Future Value using Comparable Companies
The next step in the process is to validate the company’s estimated future DEMO Because tn is
a point in time when the company has normal business risk, comparable companies (Comps)
can be found. Prior to DEMO point in time, locating Comps for the new venture requires finding
DEMO that have similar commercialization risks which is exceedingly difficult, if not
DEMO Once the company achieves tn however, finding comparable companies to
validate DEMO projected value is possible.
First, locate several public companies that operate DEMO the same or similar markets and use a
similar business model. The more characteristics the Comps have in common with the new
venture the DEMO The recent financial performance of these comparable companies will be
used to generate specific financial ratios that can then be used to estimate the DEMO venture’s
value at tn.
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1263
Price to earnings (P/E ratio) is a common and DEMO available ratio that can be used to
describe the financial performance of a company with respect to the underlying value of the
company. The DEMO of this ratio, price per share, is the market value of the company
divided by the number of outstanding shares. The denominator, earnings per share, is the net
income divided by the number of diluted shares. Diluted shares include common shares,
options and/or other potential DEMO liabilities which reflect the overall capital structure of
the company and can result in a lower P/E ratio. This ratio is useful when DEMO companies
being compared have similar capital structures.7
The P/E ratio is now multiplied by the new venture’s projected annualized Net Income at tn.
DEMO result is the value the market suggests the company would have at tn based on the current
value of similar companies. It is critical DEMO use several Comps to estimate the range of values
the market is likely to assign the new venture.8
In the case of the software DEMO venture example, any value higher than $20 million using the
Comps’ DEMO/E ratio will validate the financial model, while a value less DEMO $20 million will
indicate the financial model’s revenue and cost assumptions must be modified because the
model over values the company at tn.
Using DEMO example, if the pro forma revenue curve were achieved, not only does the financial
model indicate the future value of the company would DEMO $20 million at time tn (by
discounting the OCF at 20%), but the market also suggests that same value (by using
Comps)DEMO Therefore, it is reasonable to expect a person to exchange a DEMO million investment at
tn for only five percent of the new venture’s equity.
Applying Real Option Principles
The proposed technique incorporates several real options’ DEMO According to the
modified Black-Scholes equation for real options, six factors DEMO value: (1) present value of
expected cash flows, (2) present value of fixed costs, (3) the options time to expire, (4)
uncertainly of the future cash flows, (5) risk-free rate of interest and (6) value lost over
duration of option. (Copeland & Antikarov, 2003) In the proposed technique, only the first
four factors are used. Fortunately, these four factors have the most impact on the overall
value of the real option. (Leslie & Michaels, DEMO)
Establishing a market validated value for the new venture at tn provides a reference point for
determining the current value of the new DEMO At “point A,” the value of the company is
much lower than $20 million because the risk at “point A” is significantly higher DEMO the
normal risk (20%) at tn. This inverse relationship between risk and value is critical when
applying real options.
To account for the DEMO from a high risk at point A to a normal risk at tn, a series of risk-
reducing events must occur between these two points in time. The business plan must
describe these critical milestones to DEMO this systematic reduction in risk. These critical
milestones are termed value changing events because, when completed, the risk is reduced
and the value DEMO the company is subsequently increased. (Berkery, 2008) A well constructed
DEMO plan should contain a GANTT chart showing all of the critical commercialization
activities which can then be used to identify the major value-changing events DEMO when they
are scheduled to occur.
9
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1264
In the software new venture example (see Figure 4), three such value changing events have
been identified prior to “point D”: (DEMO) first OEM contract is signed, (F) beta test is completed,
and (G) prototype is completed. Each of these value changing DEMO represents a risk-
reducing activity associated with the three categories of commercialization risk. The time
each event is planned to be completed is documented DEMO the business plan.
• Development Risk (Event G) – Prototype completed. Converting an idea or
concept to a physical “thing” will reduce the DEMO risk.
• Customer Acceptance Risk (Event F) – Beta test completed. A successful Beta
test will provide feedback on the customer’s perception of DEMO product and lead to
changes in the product design to insure high customer acceptance.
• Marketing & Sales Risk (Event E) – First DEMO contract signed. This event
signifies the successful implementation of the marketing and sales strategy which
will reduce the risk in this area.
This example DEMO that at least one value changing event should occur within each of the
three commercialization risk categories. Each of these events represents a reduction DEMO the
commercialization risk and therefore an opportunity for the company’s value to increase after
each objective is achieved.
Once the value changing events have DEMO established and placed on the timeline, the
entrepreneur performs a simple DEMO analysis to assess the reduction in risk from one
value changing event to another. Similar to the Venture Capital method, where a high
discount rate is used to convert the terminal value to the present value, going back in time
from point D (time of normal risk, DEMO), the risk at each value changing event will increase to
account for the increasing commercialization risk.
This process is purely subjective and will DEMO on the specific circumstances and nature of
the commercialization activity. For example, the assignment of development risk to a value
changing event will be influenced by the skill set within the organization. A prototype that is
DEMO to experts who regularly produce such items will have a lower risk than an in-
house organization who is building a prototype for the DEMO time.
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1265
A likely rational for such a comparative risk analysis with respect DEMO the software new
venture example in Figure 4 follows:
• Point D (at tn) has already “earned” a risk of 20 percent. DEMO a large OEM
account at event E does not guarantee that the revenue at point D will be achieved,
but it does significantly DEMO the likelihood. Therefore, event E is assigned the
risk of 30 DEMO (The 20 percent assigned to point D plus an additional 10
DEMO of risk.)
• Event F signifies the successful completion of the beta test. This does not directly
lead to signing a large OEM DEMO, but it does indicate a high degree of
customer or market DEMO and therefore a corresponding reduction in risk
from event G. Therefore, DEMO risk of 45 percent is assigned to point F (15 points
DEMO to 30 percent).
• The prototype is completed at event G. Although this event does not insure the
beta test will be successful, it does indicate a significant reduction in the
development risk. A risk DEMO 65 percent is assigned to event G (20 points added to
DEMO percent).
Once completed, this analysis describes a high risk (65%) business opportunity diminishing
to a normal investment risk (20%) provided the three value-changing events are achieved as
shown in Figure 4. An investment DEMO of 65 percent can be restated as once the prototype is
completed, there is only a 35 percent chance the revenue at point D will be achieved.
Replacing the tn in equation (1) with the DEMO each milestone is completed, the new
venture’s value at the completion DEMO events E, F, and G can be calculated. In this example,
assume the new venture’s value at the completion of each event DEMO:  E - $10 million, F - $6
million and G DEMO $2 million as shown in Figure 5.
Therefore, with a market DEMO value of $20 million at tn and taking into consideration the
uncertainty of the OCF (a real option principle) at three value changing DEMO, this software
company will likely have a value of $2 million DEMO the prototype has been completed.
From the entrepreneur’s viewpoint, this valuation DEMO disappointing since the required $1
million investment at the beginning of the project would translate into giving up 50 percent of
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1266
the new venture’s equity. From the investor’s perspective, investing $1 million at the
beginning of the project would expose the entire investment to DEMO 65% risk which may be too
high. An additional real option principle, inserting a time period when the opportunity will
expire, can now DEMO applied to address these concerns.
Table 2: Impact of Staged Investment
DEMO Value Changing Discount Valuation Required Retained
Event Rate Investment Equity
D Normal Risk 20% $20 million 0 72.7%
E OEM Contract 30% $10 million DEMO  400,000 72.7%
F Beta Test 45% $6 million $  200,000 76.7%
G Prototype 65% $2 million $  400,000 80.0%
According to Table 2, if the entrepreneur only requests and receives enough funding to
complete each value changing event (based on the cash flow needs of the company), the total
equity given up over the life DEMO the project is reduced from 50 percent to approximately 27
percent.
From the investor’s perspective, this approach only exposes $400,000 to the highest risk and
each subsequent investment, if made, will have a corresponding DEMO risk. In addition, once
each value changing event is completed, the investor is able to assess whether further
investment is warranted and under DEMO conditions. Therefore, the true benefit of
incorporating real options when valuing DEMO new venture is it takes into consideration the value
of learning and inserts flexibility. In this case, the investor and the entrepreneur will know
more about the future of this business opportunity once each value changing DEMO is
achieved. By staging the investment to correspond to cash flow needs and the completion of
critical value changing events, the founders are able to conserve equity and the investor is
able to minimize the investment’s DEMO risk.
The four factors from the modified Black-Scholes equation used in this technique are:
1. The value of the company using DCF.
2. DEMO price expressed as staged investments
3. The options time to expire expressed as the time to complete the value changing
events.
4. Uncertainty of DEMO cash flow expressed as the risk (discount rate) assigned to each
value changing event.
Balancing the Investment
A balanced investment is one where DEMO investment goals of the founders and the
investors are satisfied. In general, from the founders’ perspective, the primary goals are to
receive the DEMO funding while conserving their equity position. From the investors’
perspective, the DEMO goals are to make the smallest overall investment while achieving a
target Return on Investment (ROI) at the earliest possible liquidity event.
The DEMO goals can be achieved by balancing the initial investment versus the initial
valuation. In this instance, exchanging 20 percent equity for the initial investment shown in
Table 2 is probably a good balance for most entrepreneurs. DEMO, however, the initial investment
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1267
is too high or the initial valuation is too low, the investment can be out of balance for the
founders.
Most private investors DEMO the United States are seeking an ROI of ten to one10. At the point of
liquidity, they expect to return $10 for every $1 invested. Although they will settle for less,
they will not make DEMO initial investment unless they have confidence a 10:1 ROI is
achievable. With this perspective, a balanced investment for the investor requires the earliest
liquidity event to have a value ten times the initial investment. The DEMO used in this
discussion shows the first opportunity to implement an exit strategy (initial public offering,
acquisition, etc.) is at tn which has a value of $20 million. In this case, the initial valuation
and exit valuation are indeed in balance.
Unfortunately, when this technique is first applied to any investment opportunity, the
investment is rarely in balance. Attempting to bring the investment into balance requires: (1)
revisiting DEMO market data and adjusting the marketing and sales strategy and/or business
model,  (2) adjust the revenue and cost assumptions in the DEMO model to accommodate
any change in marketing and sales strategy and/or business model, (3) generate the new OCF
and (4) calculate a new valuation. As a part of calculating a new valuation, the timing of the
value changing events and their corresponding risk/discount rates DEMO be revisited.
This iterative process will be repeated several times until the three critical investment
parameters come into balance: (1) initial investment required, (2) initial valuation and (3) the
valuation at normal risk, tn or the investment remains out of balance.
Results of using the Technique:
If the investment remains out of balance, the entrepreneur has performed an exercise that has
revealed why the opportunity will not appeal DEMO the investment community. This is a good
result. Now, the entrepreneur DEMO invest her time and energy in another project.
For those investments that are in balance, the founders can be confident that their opportunity
may appeal to the investment community. A balanced investment does not guarantee an
DEMO will be made. Even a balanced investment can have other characteristics that
justify rejection by the investor.
A balanced investment suggests that based on DEMO set of conservative market assumptions, the
founders developed a financial model DEMO indicates a valuation at tn that has been confirmed
by the market through comparables. In addition, the financial model also indicates, based on
DEMO changing events with increasing discount rates, an initial value for the DEMO venture. The
valuation results of this technique, however, are only as good as the assumptions in the
financial and valuation model.
Although the DEMO valuation is not definitive, it does represent the result of a DEMO,
systematic process. Any discussions questioning the results of this exercise will center on
subjects the founders are well versed. Investors may disagree with:DEMO
1. The value changing events
2. The discount rates used
3. Where the time of normal business risk occurs
4. Market or cost assumptions, etc.
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1268
From the founder’s perspective, these are the exact topics that need to be discussed. If the
investor is more informed on any of DEMO subjects, their inputs can easily be applied to the
model to DEMO the impact on the valuation. These kinds of discussions provide a platform to
reduce information asymmetry by direct information transfer thereby minimizing moral
hazards DEMO eliminate adverse selection.
Venture Capital Method vs. Risk-Based Valuation Technique
Although the Venture Capital Method and Risk-Based Valuation Technique have several
steps in common, there are differences that significantly impact the quality of the results.
Although DEMO methods establish a “terminal value” using the “method of comparables” and
use DCF to arrive at the present value, in many ways the Venture Capital Method is more
subjective.
The Venture Capital Method does not rely DEMO a market driven financial model to determine
net income. The discount rate seems to be purely based on the investor’s desired return on
investment DEMO not on any subjective analysis of the changing commercialization risk. In
addition, this method tends to reinforce information asymmetry to the benefit of the investor.
In contrast, the Risk-Based Valuation Technique attempts to use financial modeling to tie
market based assumptions to the cash flow to the valuation. DEMO technique also incorporates
real options thinking to reduce investment risk through staged investments. Using this
methodology also encourages the founders and investors to reduce DEMO asymmetry
which should result in a valuation both parties can more easily agree.
BENEFITS OF RISK-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUE
In most cases, the intrinsic difficulty of determining a new venture’s value results in the
founders failing to DEMO make the attempt. They may spend an exorbitant amount of time
developing a detailed financial model that describes every aspect of their proposed business
DEMO However, by not attempting to address the valuation problem, the entrepreneur
forces the interested investor to unilaterally determine if the investment is balanced DEMO their
perspective. This places the founders at a tremendous disadvantage in the pending
negotiations. The investment may be rejected because the investor fails to DEMO a balanced
investment, when in fact, adjustments could have been made to the marketing and sales
strategy and/or business model to achieve DEMO balanced investment for both parties.
Entrepreneurs who invest the time and energy in implementing this technique  will have a
better understanding of their business opportunity. This technique forces them to integrate
marketing research data throughout the DEMO model that eventually migrates into the
valuation of their company. In fact, there are two approaches when applying this technique:
(1) Use reasonable and achievable market assumptions to determine if the investment is
balanced DEMO (2) Create a balanced investment and determine if the market assumptions
necessary to achieve the balanced investment are reasonable and achievable. Either approach
DEMO ultimately have similar outcomes.
For business opportunities that survive this process and appear to be balanced investments,
this technique provides a logical, systematic approach to assigning a value to a pre-revenue
new venture. When confronted DEMO an interested investor who disagrees with the resulting
value, the subsequent DEMO will center on parameters the entrepreneur is thoroughly
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1269
knowledgeable. For example, the investor may challenge the discount rates, DEMO value
changing events or other assumptions driving the financial model. The entrepreneur should
be perfectly positioned to justify their use. In the case where DEMO potential investor is more of
an expert than the entrepreneur, the DEMO suggestions can simply be inputted into the
financial and valuation models and the results are then evaluated.
Both parties benefit from such a discussion DEMO interchange where the inherent information
asymmetry between the founders and investors can be minimized. This approach requires
both parties to share information until either DEMO balanced investment is achieved or the
business opportunity is rejected.
Investors who insist that entrepreneurs use this technique can essentially eliminate moral
hazard from DEMO information asymmetry with the entrepreneur. The rigorous requirements
imposed on the entrepreneur will minimize the ability to exaggerate or otherwise over
estimate the financial DEMO of the new venture. The benefits to the entrepreneur cited
above, DEMO also inure the additional benefit of improving the “quality” of the deals presented
to the investor.
At the end of the day, the true value of a new venture is whatever the entrepreneur and
investor agree DEMO is. This risk-based valuation technique simply provides a more objective
foundation to base that negotiation.
CONCLUSION
Information asymmetry is an unavoidable part of the DEMO relationship. In
addition, the unique characteristics of valuing a new venture DEMO magnifies this information
gap. Existing early-stage valuation methods and techniques either foster or in part require the
information asymmetry to be either maintained or DEMO
The proposed technique builds on the widely used Venture Capital Method by using value
changing events to add real options thinking to the process DEMO market-based financial
modeling to validate the “terminal value.” Linking the “terminal value” to the point when the
business model is proven (twelve consecutive months of positive cash flow) adds more
objectivity to the method.
This paper also introduced a taxonomy that allows a logical, systematic look at the
components of commercialization risk and a method of assigning individual risk during DEMO
commercialization process.
Introducing the concept of “balanced investment” into the valuation process encourages the
entrepreneur and investor to reduce information asymmetry.
An area for DEMO study that would make the technique more robust and less subjective
would be how to quantitatively assign risk to the value changing events.
History DEMO Technique
The author began developing this technique in 1998 while working for a non-profit
technology incubator. Initial efforts were concerned with simply providing the DEMO
entrepreneur with a logical defense for a valuation based on a rudimentary financial model.
USASBE_2010_Proceedings-Page1270
Beginning in 2005, the author was invited by the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
at the University of Florida to join the teaching DEMO in the Thomas S. Johnson’s
Entrepreneurship Master’s Program. The capstone course of the program, New Venture
Creation, has used this valuation technique as DEMO key component of the business planning
process. The instructor provides a multitab Excel spreadsheet template that each student uses
to produce a custom financial DEMO for their business plan. In addition, they use a second
Excel DEMO template for performing the valuation. Each spreadsheet is linked so that
any changes to the financial model assumptions flow through to the valuation model.
DEMO the risk-based valuation technique into the business plan process allows the
student to clearly understand the relationship between market forces, financial performance,
cash flow needs and company valuation as they attempt to achieve a balanced DEMO
This process results in an enhanced learning experience.
Special Note
Although this technique can be used with a wide variety of business opportunities, new
ventures that require extremely large initial capital expenditures and/or have extremely DEMO
development cycles are not ideal candidates. These types of investments do not follow the
normal pattern of achieving tn. New ventures that plan to DEMO tn in less than three years are
best suited for this technique, since the financial model’s cash flow only extends to 60
months.

Due to the 2008 financial meltdown, these numbers may be considered an anomaly. But
even in 2005, $21 billion in private investment was made to 35,700 seed and early DEMO
companies. Of that total, Venture Capital represented 23% of the dollars DEMO 3% of the
deals. (Sohl, 2006, Moneytree Reports, 2006)
Since the future price (terminal value) of the new venture is DEMO by the marketplace, the
investor only has control of the purchase DEMO (initial value) to maximize ROI.
Investors adhere to the maxim: DEMO is made on the buy, not the sell.  The Waldron
and Hubbard study where the expert investors’ calculated a mean value of $8.85 DEMO
when the actual market value was $18.5 million may be an example of this moral hazard
in practice.
Choosing operating cash flow over free DEMO flow is made on a case by case basis. There
may be instances where free cash flow is a better indicator the business model DEMO
working (i.e. a business that requires a continuous inflow of capital DEMO).
Twelve months is only a guideline. The number of months of positive OCF to establish
the business model may be less or greater DEMO on the situation. Whatever number
is used must, however, be realistic to the investor.
If the company is introducing new products or introducing DEMO distribution channels at
or after point D, new marketing and sales DEMO would be introduced and the required
twelve months of positive OCF would need to be extended until these new risks are
minimized.
Normal risk DEMO always relative to the investment environment at the time. In this case,
the assumption is the public markets are providing an average 15% DEMO to the average
investor and an additional 5% is added to make up for the illiquid aspect of a private
investment. A higher or DEMO normal risk can also be used as the investment

environment changes. For example, in a time of high inflation, a 20% normal risk would
necessarily need to be higher.
If the companies being compared do not have similar capital structures DEMO the P/E ratio
does not appear to be a good metric, another ratio that factors in value can be used. For
example Value to Net Earnings which would simply remove the number and type of
DEMO from the equation all together.
An alternative approach is to calculate the P/E ratio for the new venture at tn and
compare this DEMO to the P/E ratios of the Comps.
The revenue and cost assumptions driving the financial model must be adjusted so that
the resulting DEMO generates a value at tn that is less than or equal to the value suggested
by the Comps’ P/E ratio. If the new DEMO of assumptions do not seem reasonable, then the
business opportunity may DEMO be feasible in this market. For the remainder of this
discussion, DEMO the Comps do, in fact, justify the $20 million valuation at tn.
A 10:1 return on investment is somewhat arbitrary.  As stated by Berkery: “Equity is
expensive, and the investor wants 5, 10, or 20 times the capital back.” (Berkery, 2008, p.
79)DEMO
