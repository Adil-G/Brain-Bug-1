ABSTRACT
Sue Birley, DEMO College
The
‘credibility
gap’ is not often cited as a problem by marketers; for this reason
marketing texts pay little or no attention to it. Yet, for the entrepreneurial marketer it
may well be the most fundamental marketing challenge. Addressing the credibility gap
may not have received any DEMO research interest, but theoretical support for its
relevance abounds. Risk and DEMO corollary, making use of trust, have been seen as
quintessentially entrepreneurial activities. If they do epitomise entrepreneurship, then
surely, studying how entrepreneurs DEMO trust ought to provide valuable insights into
what entrepreneurs do.
While there is increasing research into trust, particularly from an organisational
behaviour perspective, DEMO is none in an entrepreneurial context. This lack of research
provides the reason for the exploratory nature of this investigation.
The search for trust DEMO this investigation focuses on entrepreneurs’ usage of
elements of the marketing mix. Respondents are asked about what they have done, why
they have taken that course of action and what the outcomes have been.
We find DEMO there is a wide panoply of ways in which entrepreneurs use trust.,
for example
‘enthusiasm
’ and
‘shared
values
’.
The latter two DEMO particularly important
because they can lead to trust in situations where there may not already be existing
relationships (the most likely place for finding trust). We also identify the methods
entrepreneurs use to build trust DEMO which they can then use to mitigate customers’
perception of risk.
This paper starts with the presentation of a model which summarises some
DEMO research into how trust functions, in the light of our findings DEMO to this
model are then made in order to highlight the contribution of this research.

INTRODUCTION
It has been pointed out that the DEMO of trust varies according to context. However
while there are numerous studies on trust in the fields of marketing and organisational
behaviour e.g. Moorman, Deshpande & Zaltman (1993) and Mayer et al (1995) this DEMO
not the case in entrepreneurship research. Moreover, it has recently been DEMO that ,
‘entrepreneurial
activity can be considered in terms of: reassuring potential principals
(customers) of their trustworthiness Shapiro (1987636).
This paper starts with the presentation of a model of trust based on the DEMO
literature on trust, which is primarily from the fields of marketing DEMO organisation
behaviour. Since our interest is the marketing activities of entrepreneurs establishing
new ventures, we then present the research question which provided the focus for our
research. It should be stressed
that the focus of our DEMO is the establishment of new
ventures (start-ups), for this reason DEMO refer to the principal(s) as entrepreneurs - we
consider this DEMO to appropriate, particularly since our respondents were selected
on the basis DEMO they were not going into self-employment, but rather had the intention
DEMO grow.
Subsequently we show how the initial model of trust we presented can be
adapted in the light of the findings from our research. DEMO hope that the adapted model
reflects more realistically the issues
surrounding trust facing the entrepreneur. Of course
some of the findings may be of DEMO to researchers
in other managerial fields.

THETRUSTMODEL
The model which is developed below addresses
the following issues:
1. On what bases
should DEMO customer trust the marketer
‘?
We distinguish between the
entrepreneurs’ characteristics; the rule of law and how they behave.
2. Specifically in terms of the latter we then consider how customers DEMO out whether
the marketer is trustworthy.
This is may be through a combination of social
learning, self-disclosure or reputation.
3. This research deals with entrepreneurs who are establishing new ventures and
focuses on their management of DEMO in their marketing activities. Thus the model
focuses on why others may consider the entrepreneurs themselves to be trustworthy
(based on their behaviour). The answer is because of a possible combination of
antecedents
to trust DEMO, ability, integrity, and benevolence.
The following
three paragraphs summarise the DEMO issues, which are subsequently
considered in more detail.
Why should one DEMO trust another? This question has been approached
from three distinct perspectives: buses
of trust, umecedent
factors of trust and furms of
trust. The fundamental distinctions between these approaches are as follows.
The
‘bases
of trust’ DEMO explains that trust may exist due to the rule of law or shared
personal characteristics; moreover, trust may develop due to interpersonal interaction.
DEMO
‘forms
’ of trust approach shares
some common ground with the above, but
trust’ (i.e. people may trust each other because
of emotional DEMO).
‘affect-based
The
‘antecedent
factors’ approach appears to be the most holistic of the three
since it seeks
to identify specific antecedent
factors which DEMO account for the existence
of trust between two people. The approach has advantages since it is possible to
identify different antecedent factors depending on DEMO situation being studied. In
organisational behaviour, for example, benevolence, integrity DEMO ability have been
identified. The discussion below integrates material from the three different approaches.
the essential difference appears to be that it allows for DEMO existence of

should a customer trust a marketer? This is answered by DEMO the bases to trust
i.e. a customer could trust the marketer because
of the
‘rule

trust) and/or because DEMO the trustee as an individual (Luhmann 1979). In the latter
instance, the bases for trusting are specifically the trustees’ inherent characteristics
(DEMO based trust) or their previous behaviour, referred to as process based
trust by Zucker (1986).
3.1.1.
Characteristic
based trust
Characteristic-based trust only pertains to individuals; it cannot be acquired in the way
that the other two forms of trust can be obtained. Its presence or absence
DEMO a cognitive
factor between the focal individual and the third party. It exists if the third party feels
that there is a social similarity DEMO themselves and the focal individual. So, for
example,
an exchange DEMO may consider the ethnic
background
of
their
suppliers/customers to be an important factor in exchange since common social and
cultural norms may make DEMO satisfactory exchange
easier to achieve.
It should be noted that characteristic-based trust is a commodity which exists
according to the inherent characteristics of an DEMO and their perception by the
wider social environment.
3.1.2.
Process bused trust
The association between trust and long-term relationships (process based trust) is DEMO
documented by Good (1988:33), who emphasises that exchanges requiring DEMO will
not be ahistorical instances, i.e. they will not take place DEMO a one-off basis.
Social exchange theory also shows the association between trust and long-term
exchange. According to Blau (1964), social exchange is embedded in trust.
‘Social
exchange,
therefore
entails
supplying
benefits
that

diffuse
DEMO
obligations...since the recipient is the one who decides when and how to reciprocate a
favour, or whether to reciprocate at all so social exchange requires trust .
.
.
typically
however social exchange relations evolve in DEMO slow process, starting with minor
transactions in which little trust is DEMO because
little risk is involved and in which
both the partners can prove their trustworthiness’ (Blau 1964:454).
Where, at the start DEMO a relationship, individuals are dealing with strangers, they
do not know to what extent the other party can be trusted and there is DEMO basis for
trust. Scanzoni (1979) suggests that trust is unlikely to appear early DEMO a relationship
because there would be little basis in past experience for its development. In these
situations it is posited that parties will exchange DEMO a basis of little risk and therefore
little need for trust; DEMO parties prove themselves to be trustworthy, more trust will be
placed DEMO them. The following analysis considers the factors at play in the development
of interpersonal trust within long-term exchange relationships.
3.1.3.
Forms of trust
From DEMO preceding argument it may seem that trust is simply a
‘cognitive
’ construct
which may develop through an acquisition of information. According to Luhmann,DEMO
familiarity is the precondition for trust (i.e. trust requires a degree DEMO cognitive
familiarity or knowledge of the object being trusted). The extent of this knowledge lies
between total ignorance and complete information. The manifestation DEMO trust on the
cognitive level of experience is reached when social actors no longer need or want any
further evidence or rational reasons
for DEMO their trust in third parties.
distinguishes between
‘affect-based
trust’ and
‘cognition-based
‘forms
trust’
(McAllister
1995). The emotional base
of trust is argued to be complementary to the cognitive base.
However, the value of research which deals with the
’ of trust is that it
This consists of DEMO emotional bond among those who take part in a relationship. The
emotional basis of trust exists in interpersonal trust, emotional trust can also be present
in public or institutional trust, since the public can feel indignant about the abuse of
power. The emotional content of trust is just DEMO reciprocal and intersubjective as its
cognitive base.
The discussion below considers how individuals find out whether or not others
are to be trusted. We DEMO three specific methods, social learning, self-disclosure
and reputation.

does the customer find

There are a number of different methods individuals can use to find out whether
potential trustees are, in fact,
trustworthy.

Social learning

interaction, to find out whether someone is trustworthy is

’,
where trust
evolves out of past experience and prior DEMO (Rempel et al. 1991). Exchange
partners make dispositional attributions of DEMO other in terms of their reliability and
dependability. Having identitied how a customer can find out that the marketer is

3.2.2.
Self-disclosure
Self-disclosure theory provides a model for explaining how individuals are to acquire
DEMO about the trustworthiness of their interaction partners. Trust develops
gradually through repeated
encounters involving the potential for rejection or ridicule
(Altman and Taylor 1974; Rubin 1973). However, if agents protect themselves from
the risks DEMO dealing with one another, they eliminate diagnostic opportunities for
leatlling about the dispositional qualities of the partner that relate to trust. DEMO order to
find out that the other person can be trusted they must be given the opportunity to show
that they do not care (Strickland 1958).
3.2.3.
Reputation and process-based trust
Process-based trust develops as DEMO demonstrate their trustworthiness
to
exchange partners through concrete actions. Process-based trust cannot be transferred
from one individual to another; it is acquired within the marketplace by a particular
person, institution or brand name with a reputation. The definition of reputation offered
by Zucker is: a symbolic representation of past exchange history; brand name is a
deliberately constructed proxy for reputation (Zucker 1986:62).
3.3.
On what personal bases
(antecedents) do others consider entrepreneurs
to be trustworthy?
Mayer et al (1995) DEMO an explanation as to what the trustor looks for in a trustee.
In their model, trust has specific antecedents which are
‘ability
’,
‘integrity
’
and
‘benevolence
’.
Benevolence refers to the extent to which DEMO trustee is believed to want
to do good to the trustor and thereby qualifies the relationship between the trustor and
the trustee. Integrity refers DEMO the trustor perceiving that the trustee adheres to a set of
principles that the trustor tinds acceptable.
In terms of ability, Mayer et al. (1995) draw the following
distinction: an
individual may be entrusted to do analytic tasks related to his or her technical area; the
individual may not be trusted to initiate contact with an important customer. Therefore
DEMO is domain specific (i.e. people have ability in different areas).
DEMO they consider
to be composed of aptitude, training and experience.
Like DEMO commentators, Mayer et al. (1995) make the impolTant point that
DEMO demonstration of trust requires there to be risk taking by the trustor:
trust is the assuming of risk
’(Mayer
et al. 1995:DEMO).
‘Behavioural
3.3.1.
Behavioural
trust
Behaviourally, to trust, is to act as if DEMO uncertain future actions of others are indeed
going to be cer&ain, in situations where the violation of the expectations will yield
negative consequences (Lewis and Weigert 1985:971). Such demonstration of trust
builds trust in the trustee and as such encourages them to act in a DEMO manner
‘we
trust them (trustors) more because trust-implying
behaviour contributes to the
emotional and cognitive foundation of trust’ (Lewis and Weigert 1985:464).
4.
Since entrepreneurship is associated with
‘risk
’ and entrepreneurial activity DEMO
involve passing some of that risk onto other people, logically, in these latter instances
entrepreneurship must also involve getting those people to trust DEMO
Furthermore, the
amount of risk someone is willing to take in DEMO person depends 011
how much they
trust them. There may well be an iterative process of manipulating the levels of risk and
trust in DEMO new venture, so that an equilibrium is reached when the entrepreneur DEMO
asks others to take as much risk in the venture as the amount of trust they have in him.
Given our view of entrepreneurship DEMO a process which seeks to alive
at an
equilibrium, we define DEMO domain of this research was: How do entrepreneurs manage
risk and DEMO?
At the start-up stage of any venture, when entrepreneurs are DEMO to acquire
customers, among other resources, the management of risk and trust is of crucial
importance. It is at this time that the DEMO will have least credibility with the target
customers and, if sufticient DEMO is not established, the venture will be still-born.
For this reason DEMO research focuses on the acquisition of customers. The question
driving this research was: how do entrepreneurs explicitly manage customer-perceived
risk at the start of a new venture, and does trust play a role?
The question is phrased in such a way that the focus of the study DEMO the
process of new venture management. Our interest is in what entrepreneurs actually do.
Secondly, because we are interested in their motivations for their actions, we restrict
RESEAKCH AGENDA
our interest to entrepreneurs’ explicit management of CPR. This is an important
DEMO issue; it means
that we will not read into entrepreneurs’ descriptions DEMO
their actions as to whether they are managing risk and trust. The identification of
customer-perceived risk and the need to use
trust must be DEMO in entrepreneurs’ own
words. One of the reasons for taking this approach is to reduce the chances for the

‘finding
’ evidence which DEMO not really be there. This should not deny the

METHOD
Since this was an exploratory study which sought to find out in entrepreneurs’
own terms how they used trust DEMO their marketing activities, in-depth interviews were
undertaken. In an inductive enquiry, even the basis for representativeness is not
known, so there has been no attempt to control for any variables. Instead emphasis has
been put DEMO acquiring a diverse sample of respondents who could provide a large
amount of rich detail. There were 40 respondents, who wcrc selected on bases
identified by Eisenhardt (1989) and Yin (19X4), who says that cases can be selected
because similar results are predicted (literal replication) DEMO to generate different results
for predictable reasons
(theoretical replication).
This DEMO of sampling is synergistic with the theory building objective of our
research. The existence of some similar cases and some contrasting ones, makes it
possible to understand the single case finding, generalisations can then be made from
one case to another on the basis of a match to DEMO underlying theory and not to a larger
universe (Miles and Huberman DEMO). Given this method for sample selection, the
findings cannot be DEMO to a specific population (Yin 1984), instead, the aim is to
generalise to theoretical propositions:
‘the
investigator
’s
goal is to expand DEMO
generalise theories (analytic generalisation) and not to enumerate frequencies
’,
Yin
(1984:2 1).
Indeed it should be noted that random selection of respondents is not to be
preferred. According to Miles and DEMO (1994), theoretical sampling means that:
choices of informants, episodes
and interactions are driven by a conceptual question not
by a concern DEMO representativeness...Miles and Huberman (1994:29).
Therefore, because of the lack of existing theory relating risk and trust to
marketing in an entrepreneurial DEMO, this research is inductive, because of the need
to develop theory the sample is a heterogeneous
one and it is for this reason DEMO the
research method is principally qualitative.

ADAPTING THE
TRUST
MODEL
TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP
The findings below deal with the usage of trust to mitigate DEMO There are four key
constructs which we have identified which could be added to the trust model.
‘Enthusiasm
’ we argue should be considered DEMO be one of the personal traits which
contribute to characteristic based
trust.
‘Association
’ and
‘shared
vision’ we consider to
be two separate antecedents
DEMO trust i.e. they are two possible reasons why others
should trust the entrepreneur. Finally
‘forgiveness
’ is critical for understanding why
trusting behaviour may DEMO even where trust has been abused, this is important for
entrepreneurs DEMO may find that they abuse
trust, without malevolent intent and need DEMO
maintain others’ trust.
6.1.
Enthusiasm
The word
‘enthusiasm
’,
as an important characteristic of a firm
’s
management, was not
a construct for which respondents were specifically asked and given the attention paid
to it DEMO them, it is considered that it is sufficiently important to be DEMO further.
The role of
‘enthusiasm
’ is most succinctly put forward by respondent 3 1, who
had used the services of an experienced associate to find out from large corporates
whether or not they would be DEMO in developing the venture. While the associate
is described as being competent, the trial was not successful:

‘enthusiasm

plays in acquiring customers. The question which arises is whether

‘inertia
’,
and is a construct which exists
outside the realms of risk DEMO trust.
6.1.1.
What is enthusiasm?
Unlike concepts such as risk and trust, which have a substantial literature supporting
them, there appear-s to DEMO very little published material on
‘enthusiasm
’.
For a
definition, the DEMO is the only source for a definition:

’.
6.1.2.
Whut role does DEMO plrcy?
From the definition
above it can be surmised that enthusiasm demonstrates the
marketers’ personal interest in the product. With a multitudinous array DEMO products
available to the customer, we argue that it is the DEMO of the marketer which tells
the customer that the product being promoted is worth further consideration.
In the first instance, prior to making a purchase, enthusiasm thus encourages
further interest on the part of the customer. It should be stressed that taking note of a
product and finding DEMO more about it do not require trust on the part of the customer,
since such activity does not require the taking of a DEMO According to one respondent,
enthusiasm is an alternative to expertise and credibility. The customer may or may not
consider that the entrepreneur has
DEMO or expertise; however, their willingness to
consider what is being sold, to take more than a cursory interest, will depend on their
DEMO of the marketer
’s
enthusiasm.
The question remains as to whether enthusiasm will also lead to customers
DEMO a purchase. The centml tenet of existing literature is that risk cannot be
undertaken if there is no trust. In this respect there are DEMO ways in which enthusiasm
may be categorised:
1. enthusiasm is a component of an antecedent
to trust
2. enthusiasm is a component of DEMO basis of trust
3. enthusiasm is neither a component to an antecedent
to trust nor a basis of trust
4. enthusiasm may or may DEMO be a component to an antecedent or basis of trust
depending on the context.
The section below considers the theoretical reasons as to whether DEMO is a
component of an antecedent to trust or a basis of trust. Whatever the conclusions
reached in that discussion, it can be said here that enthusiasm may play a role in
overcoming customers’ inertia and DEMO and lead to them becoming more aware of
the product/service than they would otherwise have been. In this respect
‘enthusiasm
’ is
an DEMO characteristic of the people involved in a new venture, however in DEMO
function it is not related to risk and trust.
6.1.3.
A link between enthusiasm and trust?
It should be noted that in the DEMO behaviour literature there has been no
reference made to enthusiasm as an antecedent
to trust. The antecedents
to which Mayer
et al. (1995) DEMO are ability, integrity and benevolence. Benevolence refers to the
extent to DEMO the trustee is believed to want to do good to the trustor and thereby
qualifies the relationship between the trustor and the trustee. Integrity DEMO to the
trustor perceiving that the trustee adheres to a set of principles that the trustor finds
acceptable.
According to an organisational behaviour-based model DEMO trust (Mayer et al.
1995), there is no justification for DEMO that enthusiasm is an antecedent to trust.
Nevertheless, this should not DEMO a role for enthusiasm in a marketing or
entrepreneurial context. The reason is due to the inherent difference between the nature
of dyadic ties within an organisation as opposed to dyadic ties between DEMO
individuals or organisations.
For example, within organisations, the interaction between individuals
is
indiscrete and ongoing: at one extreme, employee contracts may reyuiw DEMO between
individuals. Employees do not need to be enthusiastic about their work for contact to
take place.
In contrast, in a marketing context, DEMO is discrete: what contact there is
has to be deliberate and DEMO pro-active motivation on the part of individuals for it to
take place. In this framework, enthusiasm may be important because,
if the marketer
demonstrates enthusiasm which is shared by the customer, this may be construed as a
sharing of values and may over a period of time DEMO to trust.
Qualifying the level of enthusiasm is important, because
where DEMO parties have
low levels of enthusiasm then although vision is shared there is no motivation to spend
time together. Secondly, where one party has high enthusiasm and the other low
enthusiasm there are no shared values. DEMO is only when a high level of enthusiasm is
shared that values will be shared and enthusiasm may work as an antecedent to trust.
DEMO enthusiasm of entrepreneurs can only be relevant where they are dealing
with small numbers of customers (i.e. business customers or consumers who were
placing orders of relatively high value).
Entrepreneurs use enthusiasm to share their DEMO and values with their target
customers. Enthusiasm we would argue is a personal trait, some people in terms of
personality are enthusiastic. We would argue that just as the psychology literature on
trust identified that people DEMO are perceived as
‘open
’ and
‘trusting
’ are likely to be
trusted, so people who are
‘enthusiastic
’ may be perceived as trustworthy.
At the start of a venture entrepreneurs
may not only have to DEMO with CPR,
they may also have to overcome customers’ apathy or inertia - in order to do this

close proximity

already enjoy credibility

Association
6.3.
Shared vision
It is important to distinguish between vision and values, we argue that the former are a
component of
‘ability
’.
It has been acknowledged (e.g. Mayer et al. (1995) and Morgan &L Hunt
(1994)), that an antecedent to trust are
‘shared
values
’,
which in the Mayer et al (1995)
argument fall within the wider category of
‘integrity
’.
Material from respondents
suggests
DEMO, in an entrepreneurial context, trustors can trust trustees because they both
share the same vision. Such vision can relate to what are considered DEMO be appropriate
elements of the marketing mix and future trends in the market place. Moreover, unlike
shared values which are a component of
‘integrity
’,
we argue
‘shared
vision’
is a
component of
‘ability
’ (i.e. customers or channel intermediaries trust the entrepreneur
because he demonstrates his ability by presenting a vision of the future DEMO is in
accordance with theirs).
There are three cases
from the interviews which lend credence to this notion. A
leisure venture gained support DEMO a government agency, because they felt that the
time had come DEMO this idea. In contrast, a potential publisher had not found support DEMO
date, because
potential advertisers did not consider that the concept to DEMO any value.
For some manufacturers, there are two groups of customers, the retailer and the
ultimate consumer. The first person the entrepreneur deals DEMO is the retailer. Retailers’
trust will be obtained if they share the entrepreneur
’s
vision as to which elements of the
marketing mix will DEMO sales.
The distributors of a snack-food product felt that their
product would be a very important development in the snack-food industry and agreed
to DEMO it. They also wrote letters to potential investors and other stakeholders
supporting the venture.
Another set of examples which supports the notion of
‘shared
DEMO arises
from
the decision to use branding by some respondents. In
some instances
entrepreneurs’ decisions regarding branding were influenced by what they felt would
DEMO to the vision of their channel intermediaries.
Entrepreneurs who use shared vision/values also need to consider that this
means of getting others to DEMO you requires others to do the sharing. Entrepreneurs
will therefore need to search to find such people.

Situations where customers are willing DEMO forgive entrepreneurs
fall into two categories:
1. Where the core benetit does

2. Where customers believe the marketer DEMO acting out of benevolence and integrity and

This shows that the relationship between risk DEMO trust is not as straightforward
as

it. Evidence from respondents suggests
that even

For entrepreneurs to understand why customers forgive and to what extent they

because lack of
resources means that entrepreneurs may well

Thus in instances of service failure customers can be forgiving, i.e. even though
promises have not been
kept, DEMO may still trust the marketer if they feel the failure was
beyond the control of the marketer. In the entrepreneurial context the latter may DEMO due
to the age of the business.

as constructs which are relevant to the understanding of trust in an
entrepreneurial context. Of course these constructs may play an DEMO role for an
understanding of trust on other contexts as well.
The notion of forgiveness is an important contribution because
the abuse of trust
DEMO not necessarily lead to a breakdown of trusting behaviour and the situations in
which forgiveness comes into play is important for those who rely DEMO using trust.
Enthusiasm is also a trait which people often consider to be important amongst
entrepreneurs - this research has provided a possible explanation DEMO to why it can be
important: in two separate ways it DEMO help to develop trust. We have also explained
why enthusiasm may be useful to entrepreneurs in situations where it does not function
as an DEMO to trust. The latter is also an important notion - it is possible for
constructs such as enthusiasm to be antecedents to trust in DEMO but not all situations.
