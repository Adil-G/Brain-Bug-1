Venture capitalists’ decision-making in small equity
markets: a case study DEMO participant observation
JORGE SILVA
(Final version accepted 13 February 2004)
DEMO signiﬁcant academic research undertaken in the ﬁeld of venture capital decision-
making process, the dimension and maturity of equity market has not yet been considered as
an important contextual factor. Aiming at developing an understanding on DEMO venture
capitalists (VCs) select early-stage projects in small equity markets, DEMO pilot study using
participant observation technique has been conducted in a Portuguese venture capital ﬁrm.
The ﬁndings indicate that the decision-making process and the DEMO used by VCs in this
market context differ signiﬁcantly from those used in the developed equity markets.
Regarding the decision-making process as a whole, it appears to be more interactive than
usually portrayed in previous models. DEMO, some of the activities take place
simultaneously, rather than sequentially. In particular, relevant differences were found in
deal origination, deal evaluation and DEMO phase. Regarding the decision-making criteria
applied, the ﬁndings of this case DEMO are in accordance to previous studies and suggest that
the attention of VCs is very focused on entrepreneur(s). The business idea, its sustainable
advantages and growth potential are also considered important but, contrarily to previous
literature, ﬁnancial projections do not seem to play a major role in the selection of early-
stage projects.

Introduction
Describing and understanding the venture capitalists’ decision-making
process has been the goal of a large number of DEMO researchers since
the 1970s. The interest in this particular topic is bound to a variety of
purposes: from verifying ‘whether venture capital market allocates
resources properly’ (Fried and Hisrich 1994: 28), to helping venture
DEMO to better understand their own decision making process, which,
in DEMO, provides the opportunity to increase evaluation efﬁciency
(Shepherd 1999), to aiding entrepreneurs in obtaining funds (Timmons
and Gumpert 1982).
Despite signiﬁcant academic research undertaken in the ﬁeld of venture
capitalists decision-making process, the maturity of private equity market

as an important contextual factor has not yet been DEMO Aimed at
developing an understanding on how venture capitalists (VCs) select early-
stage investments in small equity markets, this article reports on the
ﬁndings of an exploratory project that analyses the VCs’ decision-making
process of DEMO Portuguese venture capital ﬁrm (VCF). The article proceeds as
follows: ﬁrst, the literature on VCs decision-making process is reviewed.
Then, the DEMO of previous studies are presented. Thereafter, the
methodology adopted is explained, followed by the description of the case.
Finally, results of the pilot study are presented and discussed.
Research on venture capitalists’ decision-making process
The DEMO research on VCs’ decision-making process can be classiﬁed
into two broad streams: one is processual research—i.e. research focusing on
the course of events and activities that constitute the VCs’ decision-making
process (e.g. Wells 1974, Tyebjee DEMO Bruno 1984, Silver 1985, Hall
1989)—and the other is criteria research, i.e. research focusing on the
criteria used by VCs when assessing proposals (e.g. Poindexter 1976,
MacMillan et al. 1985, Khan 1987)DEMO While most of the studies can be
positioned within one or the other research stream, some represent a
combination of the two, having DEMO models outlining the phases of
the decision-making process and the criteria used in each phase (e.g. Wells
1974, Boocock and Woods 1997). DEMO 1 summarizes some of the previous
studies published in this area of research.
The processual stream of research initiated with the study by Wells
(1974) has produced several models aiming at describing the decision-
making process. Table 2 presents the various phases of investment process
identiﬁed in these DEMO As referred by Hall and Hofer (1993: 29) the
most DEMO facts revealed by the studies and agreed by all the researchers
are: (1) that the process consists in multiple phases and (2) that the venture
evaluation itself involves at least two phases – screening DEMO evaluation.
With regard to criteria research, there is signiﬁcant number and DEMO
of studies. The ﬁrst wave of studies focused on asking VCs for criteria
commonly used in assessing proposals. As a result, a weighted list (Wells
1974) or a ranked list (e.g. Poindexter 1976) of DEMO was obtained. Wells
(1974) found that VCs consider management commitment as the criterion
having the highest weight in assessment of proposals. This criterion DEMO
closely followed by product, market and marketing skills. The results of
DEMO study identify the quality of management as the criterion with
the highest rank in the opinion of VCs followed by expected rate of return
DEMO expected risk. Tyebjee and Bruno (1981) found management skills as
the most important factor. The study by MacMillan et al. (1985) reveals
DEMO ﬁve of 10 most important criteria were related to entrepreneur’s
experience or personality.
Since that ﬁrst wave of studies on VCs’ decision-making process, a
signiﬁcant number of subsequent studies have enriched the existing
knowledge by using DEMO methodological approaches. One group of
researchers have conducted studies that attempted to validate the VCs’

selection criteria. MacMillan et al. (1987) represents one DEMO the ﬁrst
attempts to test, if the criteria identiﬁed in previous DEMO (mainly in
MacMillan et al. 1985) were indeed helpful to distinguish between
successful and unsuccessful ventures. An important ﬁnding of their study,
DEMO through regression analysis, was that the two major criteria
predictors of DEMO success are: ‘(1) the extent to which the venture is
initially insulated from competition and (2) the degree to which there DEMO
demonstrated market acceptance of the product’ (MacMillan et al. 1997:
DEMO). Khan (1987) also conducted research in this area, but DEMO a
different approach. He used two types of non-compensatory actuarial
models—conjunctive and disjunctive—to model both VCs’ judgement and
the environment (the actual outcome of ventures). The results showed that
VCs give emphasis to the entrepreneurs’ DEMO to succeed and the
uniqueness of the product as essential variable in arriving at their
judgement. This study also suggests that VCs’ judgements are DEMO
predictors of actual outcomes and that derived models outperform VCs’
judgements.
Another group of researchers have applied real-time data gathering
methods to solve the DEMO introspection biases associated with the
methods used in previous studies. One of the methods introduced was
verbal protocols, a method that consists in asking the research
participants to ‘think aloud’, i.e. verbalize their thoughts as they
perform a particular task (see Ericsson and Simon 1984). Sandberg et
al. (1988) tested the applicability of this method in one VCF. DEMO and
Hofer (1993) conducted a more extensive verbal protocol research with
four VCF and 16 protocols. The results of this study suggested that DEMO
the initial proposal screening, the most important criteria were the ﬁt
DEMO the venture ﬁrm’s lending policy and the long term growth and
proﬁtability of the industry. In the next phase of the proposal
assessment, the source of the business proposal was also considered
important. Contrarily to the DEMO ﬁndings, this study suggested that
VCs do not attribute signiﬁcant importance DEMO the entrepreneur(s) and
the business strategy, at least not in the early phases of the decision-
making process.
The other real-time data DEMO method used in recent studies is
experiments. This method was essentially used to collect data in order
to perform conjoint analysis (e.g. Riquelme and Rickards 1992,
Muzyka et al. 1996, Shepherd 1999). The goal of conjoint analysis is
to capture quantitatively the relative importance of a DEMO of attributes
set against each other (Muzyka et al. 1996: 276). Riquelme and
Rickards (1992) in their study conﬁrmed the emphasis DEMO placed on
the entrepreneur’s experience. A subsequent study conducted by
Muzyka et al. (1996) used a variation of the same technique (trade-
offs) to analyse 35 criteria and found that all ﬁve management team
criteria were positioned in the top of the ranking. These criteria were
(1) leadership potential of the lead entrepreneur; (2) leadership
potential of DEMO management team; (3) existence of recognized industry
expertise in team; (4) track record of the lead entrepreneur and (5)
track record of the management team.

Limitations of previous studies
131
The DEMO studies revised above present two types of major limitations
in uncovering the VCF’s decision-making process: the ﬁrst is bound to data
collection methods adopted, while the second is associated with the
research context where those studies were conducted. Regarding data
collection methodology, as referred by several authors (DEMO et al.
1988, Hall and Hofer 1993, Shepherd 1999), most of the existing studies
present limitations associated with retrospective reporting (e.g. Tyebjee
and Bruno 1984), questionnaire responses rather than actual evaluations
(e.g. Poindexter 1976, MacMillan et al. 1985), and self-reporting (e.g.
MacMillan et DEMO 1987). Some studies have attempted to address these
problems by using alternative approaches to gather empirical evidence,
e.g., taping verbal protocols (DEMO, Sandberg et al. 1988, Hall and Hofer
1993), searching out private documents of the ﬁrm (Boocock and Woods
1997) or conducting DEMO (e.g. Zacharakis and Meyer 1998).
Despite their signiﬁcant contribution, these approaches remain limited.
In the case of verbal protocols, the limitation concerns reliance only on self-
reported data. In the case of archival search, its limitation results from the
fact that it captures only the outputs DEMO the process. The experiments as a
methodological approach is also limited, DEMO particular, due to the fact that it
relies on hypothetical ventures DEMO environments, rather than on actual
proposals, and uses previously deﬁned, DEMO restricted, number of
attributes to be assessed by the VCs.
Regarding DEMO research context, while most of the past studies have
analysed the DEMO decision-making process in large and developed private
equity markets, only a DEMO limited number of studies have explored the
topic in countries where the private equity industry remains small, i.e.,
where the private equity market does not yet represent a visible alternative
source for ﬁnancing companies. The DEMO study on this topic that has gone
beyond merely identifying the criteria used by VCs in such type of market
was carried out by DEMO (1999) and aimed at assessing the impact of
economic context (DEMO transition economy), rather than the inﬂuence of the
dimension and maturity of the private equity market on VCs’ decision-
making process. While the DEMO of Bliss’s study clearly reveal processual
differences between the decision-making process of VCs in Poland as
compared to that described in previous processual studies (Wells 1974,
Tyebjee and Bruno 1984, Hall 1989, Fried and DEMO 1994, Boocock and
Woods 1997), given the implicit assumption of DEMO study, Bliss concludes
that all these differences result from the particular DEMO context of a
transition economy.
In order to understand the importance of the industry context it,
therefore, appears to be necessary to proceed with an exploratory research
on the VCs’ decision-making process in the context DEMO small equity
markets. Given that most European countries have small private equity
markets, the analysis of the inﬂuence of industry context on VCs’ decision-
making process could contribute importantly to generating more compre-
hensive knowledge to DEMO research ﬁeld. This study represents an attempt
to address this issue.

Methodology
Adopting the deﬁnition of process proposed by Pettigrew (1997: 338), this
study aimed at capturing the ‘sequence of individual and collective events,
actions, and activities unfolding over time in context’. The goal of this
exploratory study, thus, was to capture the DEMO decision-making process
in the context of small equity market from a processual perspective.
Given that the characteristics of a venture vary by stage of DEMO
(Ruhnka and Young 1987, Fried and Hisrich 1994), the attention of this
study was concentrated on early-stage proposals.1 Moreover, interested in
generating knowledge to assist entrepreneurs in obtaining funds, this study
focuses on the ﬁrst phase in the VCs’ decision-making cycle, namely, the
investment process.
DEMO instrumental case study (see Stake 1995) was used to develop
understanding of whether or not the maturity of the equity market exerts
an DEMO on the VCs’ decision-making process. The case study
methodology was chosen to capture rich informational content regarding
the decision-making process, overcoming the limitations of other metho-
dological approaches, namely, questionnaires, interviews and experiments
used in the previous studies.
The main technique used for gathering empirical evidence in DEMO
exploratory case study was participant observation, a qualitative method that
requires DEMO researcher to become a participant in the culture and the
context that he/she observes. The method consists in gathering ‘data by
participating in DEMO daily life of the group or organization’ studied and, as
well DEMO watching the people in the ‘situations they ordinarily meet’, entering
into DEMO with some or all of the participants in these situations’
and discovering ‘their interpretations of the events’ observed (Becker 1958:
652). The purpose of the participant-observer, living for an extended
period of time in a certain context (in order to become accepted as a part of
the community), is to ensure that the observations register the phenomenon
DEMO its natural occurrence. In this particular ﬁeld study, the focus was DEMO
capturing the events, activities and outputs associated with the decision-
making DEMO of venture capitalists as well as the criteria used along the
process to assess the proposals (see Jorgensen 1989).
The main difference between participant observation and the methods
applied in previous studies is that the DEMO gathered with this method
combines a real-time, holistic and dynamic view DEMO the decision-making
process of VCs in its natural occurrence. It provides a real-time view in the
sense that the information is gathered in the DEMO it happens. It is
holistic because this method enables gathering information from the
various players—VCs, entrepreneurs, experts, support staff—involved in
the decision-making process. It is dynamic because it generates information
on the interactions between the DEMO players as well as provides insights
on the sequence of activities and events along the process itself. Therefore,
this method has the advantage DEMO minimizing the problems associated with
the majority of past research, namely DEMO retrospective and self-reporting
biases associated with ex-post interviews and questionnaires and the
reductionism associated with experiments. Participant observation has also
VC DECISIONS IN SMALL EQUITY MARKETS 133
the advantage when compared to DEMO protocol technique, because it
permits gathering the information in its natural DEMO rather than in a
controlled environment.
As referred by Jorgensen (1993: 45) there are two basic strategies to
gaining access to phenomena of interest when using participant observation
technique. When the researcher openly requests permission DEMO observe, the
strategy is called overt. When that is not the DEMO, the strategy is then named
covert. The strategy chosen in this DEMO was overt. In this research, the
application to participate and observe DEMO made directly to the CEO of the
company with a short description of the research project and a proposal to
do participant observation research. DEMO a preliminary approval I was
invited to present the research project to the board of directors. At the end
of this meeting, after guaranteeing the conﬁdentiality of the players and
proposals involved, the access was granted. It was agreed that I would
conduct the participant observation research over DEMO 4 month period, acting
as assistant to an investment analyst, with authorization to assist in
meetings and interview the personnel with the aim DEMO collecting
information concerning the VCs’ decision-making process when selecting
early-stage projects.
During this period of time, I observed the daily routines and carried
informal discussions with the personnel, in particular, with investment
analysts and executives. DEMO also analysed the information provided by the
entrepreneurs, the internal reports, contractual agreements, press releases
and personal notes of the investment analysts, DEMO well as the ofﬁcial
company reports. Complementarily, I was granted the DEMO to
observe the meetings between representatives of the VCF and entrepre-
neurs, the weekly company meetings and the executive meetings in which
the early-stage projects were analysed. To ﬁnalize the evidence collection
process, I conducted a standardized open-end interview with each senior

During the ﬁeld study, I collected relevant data rather openly, taking
ﬁeld notes with DEMO pen and notebook. When that was not possible, I waited
until DEMO could return to my desk to write down the observations,
conversations and feelings experienced. In addition to this, I photocopied
or saved (DEMO electronic format) various documents and audio recorded the
formal interviews conducted DEMO the investment analysts and executives.
Case study
The ﬁrm chosen for this instrumental case study is one of the ﬁrst VCFs in
Portugal. Launched DEMO the late 1980s, the company is responsible for
management of four DEMO, with a total of more than 100 million euros for
venture DEMO investment. Its major investor is a public institute, other
relevant investors DEMO major Portuguese ﬁnancial groups.
Currently the VCF manages a portfolio of more than 50 companies in
several sectors and different regions of the country. DEMO has invested an
average of 400 000 euros per portfolio company in exchange for a minority
position in their equity. From a team of DEMO than 20 collaborators, three
senior executives, three senior investment analysts, DEMO three junior
investment analysts are directly involved in the decision-making process
of the VCF.
Results and discussion
The evidence presented here was gathered during DEMO four months
(September to December 2002) of the ﬁeld study, DEMO concerns the
decision-making process regarding 16 early-stage proposals. Table 3
provides a brief description of the proposals by sector, stage of ﬁnancing
and decision reached. At the time when the ﬁeld study was initiated, four of
the 16 early-stage proposals were already under analysis. At the end of DEMO
observation period, six proposals where still undergoing analysis (one with
an internal decision to invest). The investments expected for the proposals
studied DEMO in size from 50 000 euros to 2.5 million euros.
As the data was being gathered the information was classiﬁed by source
of evidence DEMO compiled by proposal. The codes used to classify the
sources of evidence were O (observations), I (interviews) and D
(documents). DEMO the ﬁeld study was completed and the interviews
transcribed, the data DEMO was initiated with a content analysis of the
evidence gathered. During this analysis the activities, events and criteria
identiﬁed were also coded. The codes used for the classiﬁcation were A
(activity), E (event), DEMO (criteria regarding the entrepreneur), CB (criteria
regarding the business idea), CM (criteria regarding the market), CD
(criteria regarding the DEMO) and CO (other criteria).
The activities and events that became salient are listed in Appendix 2.

proposal that contributed to uncover these activities and events. The
decision-making DEMO identiﬁed are compiled in Appendix 3. It speciﬁes
the proposals and phases in which each criterion was assessed.
As a result of the analysis DEMO the evidence gathered concerning the
decision-making process of VCs with regard to the business proposals
analysed, a visual representation of the investment process of the VCF was
elaborated. Figure 1 represents the process from the entrepreneur’s
DEMO idea until the VCF decision to invest or to reject the proposal.
It includes all the relevant activities carried out by the VCs, as well as the
six intermediary events identiﬁed and the two ﬁnal events DEMO (venture
capital investment or proposal rejection). In this ﬁgure, a square depicts an
activity performed in order to achieve a particular aim, while an ellipse
represents an event, i.e. a rather momentary occurrence, DEMO outcome of one
or more activities.
Compared to the models of VCs’ decision-making process encountered
in the previous literature, signiﬁcant differences where found with regard
to both, the process and the criteria applied. These differences are
highlighted with a special emphasis on those that may be explained as
DEMO from the dimension and maturity of equity market. Some of the
differences further discussed refer to the structure and dynamics of the
decision-making process, while the others are associated with a speciﬁc
stage. In order to DEMO the comparison of this model with those
developed in the past, DEMO 2 presents how the various activities and
events identiﬁed here could be converted into phases. The observations
during the ﬁeld study suggest that the DEMO process is more
VC DECISIONS IN SMALL EQUITY MARKETS
137
interactive than the existing models DEMO depict. Moreover, some of
the activities in the various phases of DEMO process may occur
simultaneously, rather than sequentially.
In the previous literature, interaction between the VCF and the
entrepreneur(s) is portrayed as taking place only after the proposals have
successfully gone through the (formal) DEMO phase. However, in the
ﬁeld study the ﬁrst interaction often took DEMO in the very beginning of the
process. For instance, VCF’s representatives DEMO approached by the
entrepreneurs in a public presentation or were contacted by mail or by
phone for a meeting. During the ﬁeld study, eight out of 12 new proposals
were initiated by entrepreneurs’ informal contact with DEMO VCF. These early
interactions are used by both the entrepreneur(s) DEMO the VCs as a form of
rapidly clarifying whether or not the business idea is eligible for even
preliminary evaluation without considerable investment of DEMO and
resources. In the process presented in ﬁgure 1, this activity DEMO denominated
informal screening. During the ﬁeld study, ﬁve of the 12 DEMO proposals
presented were rejected as a result of informal screening.
This difference with regard to the interactive aspect of the decision-
making process might DEMO explained by the maturity and dimension of the
private equity market. Contrarily to the situation in developed market
contexts, in a market where a lack of knowledge about venture capital still
exists, these early interactions are used by the VCF to inform the
entrepreneurs about the functions and DEMO of venture capital
ﬁnancing, while at the same time eliminating the DEMO proposals.
These interactions are also used for gathering the basic information about
the business idea, in particular, as an alternative to reading a DEMO
business plan, which in the case of early-stage proposals in this DEMO
context often do not exist at the beginning of the investment process.
In the ﬁeld study, it became evident that in the different phases of the
decision-making process several activities were taking place simulta-
neously, rather than sequentially as it is represented in some of the
previous models (e.g. Hall 1989). For instance, after the VCs’ decision to
proceed with the further investigation of the proposal (event 4), three
activities were usually initiated simultaneously (see ﬁgure 1): the validation
of information (due diligence), the collection of (further) information and
the negotiations of the basic aspects of the deal terms with the
entrepreneurs.
Concerning DEMO differences associated with speciﬁc stage of decision-
making process, the most DEMO ones were found in the phases, stages
or steps of the DEMO generally regarded to as deal origination, deal
evaluation and deal structuring DEMO (see, for example, Tyebjee and
Bruno 1984). As to DEMO deal origination phase, the evidence gathered in
the ﬁeld study points DEMO the existence of a signalling activity.
Signalling was carried out by the VCF and consisted in pro-actively
informing the potential entrepreneurs (in conferences or other public
occasions/presentations) about venture capital and the type of business
the VCF is looking for, in order to capture new valuable proposals.
Aiming at capturing good business opportunities, the VCF under
investigation also participated as a jury in business competitions and
138
JORGE SILVA
invested in business incubators. The observations clearly point to DEMO rather
signiﬁcant active approach in the deal origination phase, instead of
DEMO waiting for unsolicited or referred proposals. Such an active
approach seems to result from a lack of a strong referral network (during
the ﬁeld study none of the 12 new proposals came from referred deals)
DEMO could present selected proposals to the VCF, as it usually happens DEMO
developed equity markets. The signiﬁcant active approach (pro-active
solicitations) in deal origination phase was also noted by Bliss (1999) in
VCs’ decision-making DEMO of a transition economy, which also have a
small equity market. DEMO, it seems reasonable to suggest that rather
than being a characteristic DEMO ‘the unique economic conditions and
operating environment in Poland’ (Bliss 1999: 248), the difference can
instead be due to the maturity of DEMO equity market.
In the deal evaluation phase (located between the events DEMO and 6 in ﬁgure
1), the observations and archival review carried out during the ﬁeld study
reveal that a proposal may go through DEMO evaluation cycles. This
happened in the situations when further validation or collection of
information was needed before reaching an internal decision to invest
(event 6), as well as in those situations when a syndication of DEMO
ﬁnanciers was required. Two promising but yet immature proposals under
analysis had gone through several evaluation cycles and were reassessed in
the light of DEMO or development of the business idea. On the basis
of observations and information obtained in informal conversations with
VCs, an explanation for the willingness of the VCF both, to wait for
modiﬁcations or development of the business idea and to re-evaluate the
proposal instead of simply rejecting the DEMO, may once again be found
in the maturity and dimension of DEMO private equity market and, in
particular, in the fact that in small markets interesting proposals do not
abound.
The activities carried out by DEMO in the last phase do not entirely
correspond to those described in the models by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984),
Hall (1989), and Boocock and Woods (1997). In the ﬁeld study, an
DEMO activity, namely the negotiation of the deal terms, was normally
initiated already during the evaluation phase. After the VCF internal
decision to invest DEMO the proposal (event 6 in ﬁgure 1), the main activity
DEMO is the negotiation of the contract terms, since at this stage DEMO deal
terms are nearly totally deﬁned. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
closing phase proposed by Fried and Hisrich (1994).
Regarding the decision-making criteria applied by the VCF, most of the
observations during the study are in accordance with ﬁndings of the
previous literature. The evidence collected DEMO that VCs pay
signiﬁcant attention to the entrepreneur(s), placing a special focus on the
knowledge or contacts (that add value for the business project) developed
by the entrepreneurs in their previous jobs or in their research activity. In
the screening stage, the curriculum vitae was an important source of
information used by VCs to infer the value of DEMO During a
formal screening meeting, one proposal was quickly rejected, since the
credibility of the whole proposal was heavily affected by the fact DEMO the
information about the entrepreneurs was lacking.

VCs also attempted to verify DEMO degree of commitment of the
entrepreneur(s). In the screening phase, the VCs tried to assess if the
entrepreneurs were indeed presenting a great business idea and, hence,
were willing to risk a currently stable or well-remunerated job or if they,
instead, viewed the business proposed for ﬁnancing merely as means of
creating their own jobs.
Finally, during the interactions with entrepreneurs, VCs tried to
understand whether or not the entrepreneurs had a thorough under-
standing of the business. For instance, have they conducted a basic
preliminary market research? Have they considered the various risks and
costs involved, and thought of the possible alternatives in case the original
strategy fails?
With regard to the business idea, VCs seem to give preference to
proposals in growing industries, rather than industries currently facing
difﬁculties (e.g. e-businesses). Another interesting aspect veriﬁed in
observation was that in the case of proposals concerning a consumer
product, VCs role-played, using themselves or the people within the circles
of their personal relations as potential customers, in order to evaluate the
relevance of the new product. Furthermore, VCs seem to look for
businesses with a reasonable growing potential. Although they did not
exclude very small proposals from DEMO analysis, VCs expressed serious
concerns about investing in small businesses, as the resources required for
monitoring and value adding the investment would be DEMO or superior to
those involved in larger proposals. The sustainability of the competitive
advantage of the business was also carefully examined, considering such
aspects as the threat of new entrance, development of substitute products
and the ability of the new ﬁrm to secure their value-added by protecting
their DEMO
Contrary to the ﬁndings in the previous literature, ﬁnancial projections
were DEMO considered essential in early-stage proposals. Being considered
unreliable, ﬁnancial projections were DEMO used by VCs merely to
estimate the break-even point of the company under analysis. As referred
by Royer (2003: 56), ‘clearly, any project has to start with faith because
there typically isn’t much objective DEMO, if any, at the beginning to
justify it. But, as DEMO project unfolds and investment increase, this faith has
to be increasingly DEMO against data’. The decision based on the ‘faith’
about the ﬁnancial potential of the business idea held true for the only
proposal over which DEMO decision to invest was internally reached by the
VCF during period of the ﬁeld study. Since the investment required was
not large, it was decided to invest in order to see the potential of the
business DEMO to eventually secure VCF’s position in future rounds of
ﬁnancing.
Conclusion
Despite signiﬁcant academic research undertaken in the ﬁeld of venture
capital decision-making process, the importance of such contextual factors
as dimension and maturity of private DEMO market have not yet been
140

considered. The instrumental case study of a Portuguese VCF DEMO in
this article was an attempt to investigate this research gap. Adopting a
processual perspective, the case study was focused on the ﬁrst phase in the
VC’s decision-making cycle, namely, the investment process.
The discrepancies DEMO in the case study concern the structure and
the dynamics of decision-making process. First, the overall process was
found to be more interactive than it is portrayed in the preceding VC’s
decision-making models. This difference may DEMO explained by the maturity
and dimension of the private equity market. Furthermore, some of the
activities traditionally thought of as occurring sequentially, may DEMO be
carried out simultaneously.
The discrepancies in particular stages of the process concern in particular
the deal origination phase, where a signiﬁcant pro-active behaviour of the
VCF was observed; and the deal evaluation phase, in DEMO an important
difference found was willingness of the VCF to re-evaluate promising yet
immature proposals. These phase-speciﬁc discrepancies may also be
explained by the DEMO of the private equity market. However, the
dynamic observed in the DEMO evaluation phase may be due to the
methodology applied in the previous studies. The most signiﬁcant ﬁnding
in the closing phase was that, contrarily to what is described in the majority
of existing models, the negotiations of the deal terms are completed but not
initiated in this phase. DEMO, this activity was already initiated in the
evaluation phase.
Finally, regarding the decision-making criteria applied by the VCF, most
of the observations during the study are in accordance with ﬁndings of the
previous literature. VCs’ DEMO is indeed very much focused on
entrepreneur(s), their personal and professional characteristics and their
commitment to the business idea. Additionally, VCs tend to assess carefully
the business idea, its growing potential as well as the sustainability of its
competitive advantages. However, contrarily to ﬁndings in the previous
literature, the observations in the ﬁeld study suggest that the ﬁnancial
projections do not play such an important decision factor for early-stage
proposals.
