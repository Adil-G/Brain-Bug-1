Moderation and mediation are prevalent in basic and
appliedpsychologyresearch(Baron&Kenny,1986;Holm-
beck, 1997; James & Brett, 1984; MacKinnon, Lockwood,
Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002; Shrout & Bolger, 2002).
Moderation occurs when the effect of an independent DEMO
ableonadependentvariablevariesaccordingtothelevelof
a third variable, termed a moderator variable, which inter-
acts with the independent variable (Baron & Kenny, 1986;

J. Cohen, 1978; James & Brett, 1984). Moderation is in-
volved in research on individual differences or situational
conditions that inﬂuence DEMO strength of the relationship
between a predictor and an outcome, such DEMO studies show-
ing that the effects of life events on illness depend on
personality (S. Cohen & Edwards, 1989; Taylor & Aspin-
wall, 1996). Mediation indicates that the effect of an inde-
pendent variable on a dependent variable is transmitted
through a third variable, called a mediator variable.Inthe
language of path analysis (Alwin & Hauser, 1975), DEMO
tion referstoanindirecteffectofanindependentvariableon
adependentvariablethatpassesthroughamediatorvariable
(Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Mediation is illustrated by re-
searchonthetheoryofreasonedaction(Ajzen,2001;Ajzen
& Fishbein, 1980), which stipulates that the effects of
attitudes on behavior are mediated by intentions.
Researchers DEMO conduct analyses intended to combine
moderation and mediation. In some situations, DEMO analy-
sesareframedintermsof mediatedmoderation, inwhicha
moderatingeffectistransmittedthroughamediatorvariable
(Baron & Kenny, 1986). DEMO example, studies examining
intentions as a mediator of the effects of DEMO on be-
havior have framed attitudes as an interaction between the
expectancy that the behavior will result in an outcome and
the valence of DEMO outcome (Ajzen, 2001). On the basis of
2
this premise, intentions serve as a mediator of the effect of
the interaction between expectancy and valence on be-
havior. In other situations, analyses are characterized as
moderated mediation, such that a mediating effect is
thought to be moderated by some variable (Baron &
Kenny,1986)DEMO,researchontheroleofsocial
support in the stress process indicates that social support
can attenuate the effects of stressful life events on psy-
chological stress, reduce the effects of psychological
stress on illness, or both (S. Cohen & DEMO, 1985; Gore,
1981). As such, social support moderates DEMO mediated
effectsofstressfullifeeventsonillnesstransmittedthrough
psychological stress.
Currently, researchers use various methods to combine
DEMO and mediation. In some cases, moderation and
mediation are analyzed separately, and results from these
analyses are interpreted together to describe the combined
DEMO of moderation and mediation. In other cases, the
sampleissplitintosubgroupsthatrepresentdifferentlevels
ofthemoderatorvariable,andmediationisexaminedwithin
DEMO subgroup (Wegener & Fabrigar, 2000). In still other
cases, DEMO causal steps procedure for assessing mediation is
adaptedtoincorporatemoderatorvariables,testingwhether
a previously signiﬁcant moderator effect is no longer sig-
niﬁcant after controlling for a mediator DEMO (Baron &
Kenny, 1986). Unfortunately, these methods suffer from
various methodological problems that seriously undermine
their utility.
This article presents a DEMO analytical framework for
combining moderation and mediation that subsumes medi-
ated moderation and moderated mediation and overcomes
problems with current methods. This framework integrates
DEMO regression analysis and path analysis; expresses
mediation in terms of direct, indirect, and total effects; and
shows how paths that constitute these DEMO vary across
levels of the moderator variable. We incorporate the prin-
ciple of simple slopes from moderated regression analysis
(Aiken & West, 1991) to test direct, indirect, and total
effectsatselectedlevelsofthemoderatorvariable(Stolzen-
berg, 1980; DEMO, 1998). We illustrate the framework with
categorical and continuous moderator DEMO applied to
eachpathinvolvedinthedirect,indirect,andtotaleffectsof
a basic mediated model. We conclude by discussing the
strengths and limitations of this approach and suggesting
areas for DEMO development.
Procedures for Combining Moderation and
Mediation: Review and Critique of DEMO Methods
Researchershavecombinedmoderationandmediationby
using various approaches. Our review of current empirical
researchinpsychologyidentiﬁedthreeprimaryapproaches:
(a) the piecemeal approach, in which moderation and me-
diation are analyzed separately and their results are inter-
EDWARDS AND LAMBERT
preted jointly; (b) the subgroup approach, in which the
sample is split into subgroups based on the moderator
variable, and mediation is analyzed within each subgroup;
and (c) the moderated causal steps approach, in which the
causal steps procedure for testing mediation (Baron &
Kenny,1986)DEMO
controlling for the mediator variable. In this section, we
review and DEMO these approaches.
To identify the approaches examined here, we searched
articles DEMO in prominent psychology journals from
1986to2004,whenthesearchwasconducted.Thestarting
date of 1986 marks the publication of Baron and Kenny
(1986), one of the ﬁrst sources to discuss procedures for
combiningmoderationandmediation.Wesearchedjournals

AddictiveBehavior, BehaviorGenetics, ChildDevelopment,
DEMO Psychology, Health Psychology, Journal of
Abnormal Psychology, Journal of Applied DEMO,
Journal of Counseling Psychology, Journal of Consulting
andClinicalPsychology, JournalofPersonalityandSocial
Psychology, and Organizational Behavior and Human De-
cisionProcesses.Forthesejournals,weusedthePsycINFO
database to locate articles with the terms moderate, moder-
ating,or moderation combined with the terms mediate,
mediating,or mediation bysearchingabstractsand,when
available, full text. This search produced 225 articles,
which we examined to identify studies that combined
DEMO and mediation in their analyses and results.
This screening yielded 83 studies, of which 19 used the
piecemeal approach, 26 used the subgroup DEMO, and
44 used the moderated causal steps approach, which
respectively represent 23%, 31%, and 53% of the studies
we located (the sum of these percentages exceeds 100%
because 6 studies used more than one DEMO). Al-
though not exhaustive, this search suggests that the three
DEMO we discuss are representative of the methods
currently used to combine moderation and mediation in
psychology research.
Piecemeal Approach
One common approach to combine DEMO and me-
diation involves analyzing moderation and mediation in
piecemealfashionandinterpretingtheirresultsjointly.With
this approach, moderation is usually tested with analysis of
variance (ANOVA) or regression analysis, in which the
dependent variable Y is regressed on the independent vari-
able X, the moderator variable Z, and their product XZ,DEMO
follows:
Y  b01 bX1X bZ1Z bXZ1XZ eY1 . (1)DEMO
InEquation1,thetestofthecoefﬁcienton XZ (i.e.,bXZ1)is
MODERATIONANDMEDIATION
used to infer moderation.1 Mediation is tested separately,
typically with DEMO causal steps procedure (Baron & Kenny,
1986), in which DEMO relationships among X, Y, and the
mediator variable M are analyzed as follows: (a) Y is re-
gressedon X,(b) M isregressedon X,and(c) Y isregressed
onboth X and M.Theseregressionequationscanbewritten
as follows:
Y  b02 bX2X eY2 . (2)
M  a03 aX3X eM3 . (3)
Y  b04 bX4X bM4MeY4 . (DEMO)
Although the criteria for establishing mediation with the
causal steps procedure have evolved (Baron & Kenny,
1986; Judd & Kenny, 1981; Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger,
1998),mostresearchersapplythefollowingfourconditions
outlinedbyBaronandKenny(1986):(DEMO) X shouldrelateto
Y in Equation 2, such that bX2 is signiﬁcant; (b) X should
relateto M intheEquation3,suchthataX3 issigniﬁcant;(c)
DEMO should relate to Y in Equation 4, such that bM4 is DEMO
icant; and (d) the relationship between X and Y in DEMO
4(i.e.,bX4)shouldbenonsigniﬁcantorsigniﬁcantlysmaller
than the relationship between X and Y in Equation 2 (i.e.,
bX2).Assumingtheﬁrstthreeconditionsaresatisﬁed,com-
plete mediation is inferred if bX4 is not signiﬁcant, whereas
partialmediationisconcludedifbX4 remainssigniﬁcantbut
is signiﬁcantly smaller than bX2.
The piecemeal approach to analyzing moderation and
mediation suffers from two primary DEMO First, the
approach does not reveal which of the paths relating DEMO, M,
and Y vary as a function of Z. To DEMO, consider the
mediated model in Figure 1A. This model has three DEMO
thatcorrespondtotheregressioncoefﬁcientsinEquations3
and4.Intermsofpathanalysis(Alwin&Hauser,1975),the
directeffectof X on Y isbX4,DEMO(i.e.,mediated)
effect of X on Y is the product of aX3 and bM4. In principle,
anyofthesepathscouldvaryacrosslevelsofthemoderator
variable Z. For instance, if aX3 or bM4 vary across levels of
Z,then Z moderatesthemediatedeffectof X DEMO Y transmit-
tedthrough M.Ontheotherhand,ifbX4 variesacrosslevels
of Z but aX3 and bM4 do not, then Z moderates the direct
effect rather than the mediated effect of X on Y. These
distinctions are concealed when the moderating DEMO of Z
is assessed using Equation 1, which indicates whether Z
DEMO X and Y without
revealing which paths that constitute this relationship are
inﬂuenced by Z.
Second, most studies that apply the piecemeal approach
usethecausalstepsproceduretoassessmediation(Baron&
Kenny,1986),whichhasseverallimitationsofitsown.For
instance, requiring a signiﬁcant relationship between DEMO and
Y in the ﬁrst step can obscure a mediated effect that is
3
accompanied by a direct effect of opposite sign (Collins,
Graham, & Flaherty, 1998; MacKinnon, Krull, & Lock-
wood, DEMO). Returning to the model in Figure 1A, the
direct and DEMO effects of X on Y sum to the total effect,
suchthatbX4  aX3bM4  bX2 (Alwin&Hauser,1975).As
shown in Equation 2, bX2 is used to evaluate the overall
relationship between X and Y in the ﬁrst step of the causal
steps procedure. Hence, if bX4 and aX3bM4 are opposite in
sign, bX2 could fail to reach signiﬁcance even when it
comprisessigniﬁcantcountervailingeffects.Thislimitation
is resolved when the ﬁrst condition of the DEMO steps
procedureisdropped(Kennyetal.,1998),butthiscondition
is still used in most studies DEMO apply the causal steps
procedure.
Another limitation of the causal steps procedure is that it
does not directly test the mediated effect of X DEMO Y,as
represented by the product aX3bM4 (MacKinnon et al.,
DEMO).Thecoefﬁcientsthatconstitutethisproductaretested
separately under the second and third conditions of the
procedure, DEMO these tests can yield results that differ from
thetestoftheproductitself(MacKinnonetal.,2002;Shrout
& Bolger, 2002). For a model with a single mediator vari-
able, as in Figure 1A, the mediated effect can be tested DEMO
evaluating the change in the relationship between X and Y
between the ﬁrst and fourth steps, based on the equality
aX3bM4  bX2  bX4 (Kenny et al., 1998). However, appli-
cations of the causal steps procedure usually test whether
bX2 and bX4 each differ from DEMO, not whether they differ
from one another. These and other limitations DEMO the causal
steps procedure (Collins et al., 1998; MacKinnon et DEMO,
2002; Shrout & Bolger, 2002) are inherited by approaches
DEMO
eration, such as the piecemeal approach.
Subgroup Approach
Another common approach DEMO to combine moderation
and mediation involves splitting the sample into subgroups
thatrepresentdifferentvaluesofthemoderatorvariableand
assessing mediation within each subgroup. In some cases,
1 Throughout this DEMO, subscripts on regression coefﬁcients
indicate the variable to which the coefﬁcient DEMO assigned and the
equationinwhichthecoefﬁcientisestimated.Hence,bX1 refersto
the coefﬁcient on X estimated in Equation 1. Intercepts are sub-
scriptedwithazerofollowedbytheequationnumberinwhichthe
intercept is estimated, and residual terms are subscripted with the
dependentvariabletowhichtheresidualapplies(i.e., Y or M)and
the number of the equation from which the residual is obtained.
Finally, coefﬁcients from equations that use Y as the dependent
variable are symbolized with the DEMO “b,” whereas coefﬁcients
from equations that use M as the dependent variable are symbol-

paths are labeled with coefﬁcients from DEMO regression equations used to estimate the model. For
simplicity, the panels DEMO paths that lead directly from Z to M,to Y, or DEMO both (these paths are
implied by the regression equations for each DEMO, where Z itself appears in each equation where
it is used DEMO a moderator variable).
MODERATIONANDMEDIATION
5
the moderator variable refers to experimental conditions or
naturally occurring DEMO, such as men and women,
whereas in other cases a DEMO moderator variable is
dichotomized to form subgroups. Within each subgroup,
mediation is usually assessed with the causal steps proce-
dure, as summarized above (Baron & Kenny, 1986), or, in
some instances, by DEMO the two paths that constitute the
mediated effect and inferring support for mediation if both
paths are signiﬁcant (MacKinnon et al., 2002). DEMO evidence
formediationdiffersbetweenthesubgroups,itisconcluded
that mediation is moderated by the subgrouping variable.
The subgroup approach has been recommended in method-
ological discussions of moderation within DEMO context of
mediation(Wegener&Fabrigar,2000)andstructuralequa-
tion modeling (Rigdon, Schumaker, & Wothke, 1998).
The subgroup approach has several drawbacks. First,DEMO
under standard assumptions, analyses conducted within
each subgroup have lower statistical DEMO than would be
available from the full sample (J. Cohen, 1988). This re-
duction in statistical power has implications for tests of
DEMO in each subgroup. For instance, when the causal
steps procedure is DEMO, low statistical power decreases
thelikelihoodthattheﬁrstthreeconditionswillbesatisﬁed
and, conversely, increases the likelihood DEMO the fourth
condition will erroneously indicate complete mediation,
whichisevidencedbyanonsigniﬁcantrelationshipbetween
X and Y when M is controlled. Given the generally modest
levelsofstatisticalpowerinpsychologyresearch(Maxwell,
DEMO; Rossi, 1990), procedures that sacriﬁce power should
be avoided.
Second, as noted earlier, studies that use the subgroup
approach often form DEMO by dichotomizing a contin-
uousmoderatorvariable.Thispracticediscardsinformation,
oftenyieldsbiasedparameterestimates,andfurtherreduces
statisticalpower(Maxwell&Delaney,1993;Stone-Romero
& Anderson, 1994). Although the dichotomization of con-
tinuous variables has been criticized for decades (J. Cohen,
1983;MacCallum,Zhang,Preacher,&Rucker,2002;Max-
well & Delaney, 1993), this practice continues DEMO psychol-
ogy research and is common among studies that use the
subgroup approach.
Third, the subgroup approach does not provide tests of
differences in mediation across levels of the moderator
variable. Typically, studies that use the subgroup approach
conclude that mediation is moderated when the conditions
for mediation DEMO satisﬁed in one subgroup but not in the
other. Examining whether mediation is supported in either
subgroup does not indicate whether mediation differs be-
DEMO the subgroups. Recall that, for the model in Figure
1A,themediatedeffectof DEMO on Y through M isrepresented
by the product aX3bM4. Hence, moderated DEMO would
be reﬂected by differences in this product between sub-
groups, DEMO by whether this product differs from zero in
either subgroup. Studies that use the subgroup approach
sometimestestdifferencesinindividualpathsbetweensub-
groups but rarely test the difference in DEMO product that
represents the mediated effect.
Finally,studiesthatapplythesubgroupapproachusually
assess mediation with the causal steps procedure (Baron &
Kenny,1986)andthereforesufferfromitslimitations(Col-
lins et DEMO, 1998; MacKinnon et al., 2002; Shrout & Bolger,
2002). Some studies that apply the subgroup approach an-
alyzemediationwithineachsubgroupbytestingtheproduct
of the DEMO that constitute the mediated effect, but these
studies are the exception DEMO than the rule.
Moderated Causal Steps Approach
Athirdapproachcombinesmoderationandmediationby
addingproducttermstotheregressionequationsinvolvedin
the causal steps procedure (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Muller,
Judd, & Yzerbyt, 2005). Studies that apply this approach
typicallybeginbyusingregressionanalysistoestablishthat
Z moderates the relationship DEMO X and Y, correspond-
ingtoEquation1.Atthesecondstep,moststudiesexamine
whether Z moderates the effect DEMO X on M, as captured by
the following regression equation:
DEMO  a05 aX5X aZ5Z aXZ5XZ eM5 . (5)
The coefﬁcient DEMO XZ (i.e., aXZ5) indicates the extent to
whichtherelationshipbetween X and DEMO variesacrosslevels
of Z. In the ﬁnal step, most studies add M DEMO Equation 1,
yielding the following equation:
Y  b06 bX6X bZ6Z bXZ6XZ bM6MeY6 . (6)
This equation is used to establish that M is related to Y,as
evidenced by bM6, and to assess whether the XZ interaction
captured by bXZ6 is no longer signiﬁcant, which is taken as
evidencethat M mediatestheeffectofthe XZ interactionon
Y. Some studies DEMO this procedure either by testing
whetherthecoefﬁcienton X (i.e.,bX6)ratherthanthaton XZ
DEMO X, Z,and
XZ as a set. Other studies use alternative DEMO of Equa-
tion 6 that replace XZ with MZ or that contain both XZ and
MZ (Muller et al., 2005).
The moderated DEMO steps approach suffers from a
number of shortcomings. Some of these shortcomings par-
allelthoseassociatedwiththebasiccausalstepsprocedure.
Forinstance,anonsigniﬁcantinteractionbetween X and Z in
Equation 1 does not DEMO out the possibility that Z exerts
moderating effects of opposite sign on the direct and indi-
recteffectsrelating X to Y.Inaddition,themoderatedcausal
steps approach does DEMO directly estimate the extent to
which Z inﬂuences the indirect effect of X on Y transmitted
through M.Moststudiesexaminethemoderatingeffectof Z

of Z on the relationship between M and Y or consider DEMO

across levels of Z.
Other shortcomings of the moderated causal steps ap-
proachgobeyondthoseofthecausalstepsprocedureitself.
In particular, most studies that use the moderated causal
stepsapproachexaminemoderationforonlyasubsetofthe
pathslinking X to Y.Supportformoderationofonepathcan
changewhentermsrepresentingmoderationforotherpaths
are estimated. For DEMO, adding MZ to Equation 6 to
estimatethemoderatingeffectof Z onthepathfrom M to DEMO
will generally change the coefﬁcient on XZ, which in turn
can DEMO to different conclusions regarding the extent to
which M mediates the moderating effect of Z on the rela-
tionship between X and Y. Moreover, hypothesizing that Z
moderates a subset of the paths relating X to DEMO implies that
the other paths are not moderated. Unless moderation is
tested for each path, hypotheses concerning the moderating
effects of Z are shielded from potentially disconﬁrming
evidence.
Another problem with the moderated causal steps ap-
DEMO XZ remains
signiﬁcant when M is controlled does not reveal how M
inﬂuences the form of the interaction between X and Z,
which DEMO described by the coefﬁcients on X, Z, and XZ as a
set (Aiken & West, 1991). For example, assume that the
coefﬁcient estimates from Equation 1 indicate an ordinal
interactioninwhichapositiverelationshipbetween X and Y
DEMO stronger as Z increases. If controlling for M ren-
dersthecoefﬁcienton XZ nonsigniﬁcant,thenitfollowsthat
the relationship between X and Y no longer varies as a
DEMO of Z; however, it remains unclear whether the
relationshipispositive,negative,ornull.Thesedistinctions
havesubstantiveimplicationsthataredisregardedbyfocus-
ing solely on the coefﬁcient on XZ.
A ﬁnal problem is DEMO studies that use the moderated
causal steps approach rarely report coefﬁcients relating X,
M, and Y at speciﬁc levels of Z. These coefﬁcients can be
derived by using principles for computing simple slopes
(Aiken & West, 1991) and are essential to interpreting the
natureofthemoderatingeffectsof Z onthepathslinking DEMO,
M, and Y. These paths can also be used to DEMO the
magnitudes of the indirect effect and direct effect at differ-
entlevelsof Z todeterminewhicheffectdominatesthetotal
effectandhowtherelativecontributionsofthedirecteffect
andindirecteffectdependon Z.Thisevidenceisessentialto
substantive interpretation but is generally disregarded by
DEMO that use the moderated causal steps approach.
A General Path Analytic Framework for Combining
Mediation and Moderation
The general framework presented here builds on DEMO
approaches to combining moderation and mediation while
EDWARDS AND LAMBERT
avoiding their attendant problems. This framework draws
frommethodologicalworkthataddressesmoderationinthe
context of mediation, path analysis, DEMO structural equation
models (Baron & Kenny, 1986; James & Brett, 1984; Stol-
zenberg, 1980; Tate, 1998). In particular, we frame media-
tion in terms of a path model, express relationships among
variables in the model by using regression equations, and
incorporate moderation by supplementing these equations
with the moderator variable and its product with the DEMO
pendent variable and the mediator variable (Baron &
Kenny, 1986; James & Brett, 1984). We show how these
equations can be integrated to represent moderation of the
direct, indirect, and total effects DEMO the model (Stolzenberg,
1980; Tate, 1998). This integration DEMO on reduced form
equations (Johnston, 1984), which are derived by substitut-
ingtheregressionequationforthemediatorvariableintothe
equation for the dependent variable. We demonstrate how
thesereducedformequationscanbeusedtoexpressdirect,
DEMO,andtotaleffectsatselectedlevelsofthemoderator
variable (Tate, 1998).
Our framework extends prior work on moderation and
mediation in several key respects. First, the framework
incorporateseachofthelogicalpossibilitiesthatresultwhen
amoderatorvariableinﬂuencesoneormoreofthepathsof
thebasicmediatedmodelinFigure1A.Priordiscussionsof
moderation and mediation have addressed only a subset of
these possibilities. DEMO, we show that combining mod-
erationandmediationdoesnotyieldasinglepathmodelbut
instead produces a set of DEMO that each portray direct,
indirect, and total effects at a DEMO level of the mod-
erator variable. This perspective emphasizes that evidence
formediationvariesaccordingtothelevelofthemoderator
variableunderconsideration.Third,wepointoutthatmod-
els that specify moderation of both paths of an indirect
DEMO implicitly introduce a nonlinear effect for the mod-
erating variable. This point has not been mentioned in
discussions of such models (Baron & Kenny, 1986; James
& Brett, 1984; Muller et al., 2005), yet it has important
implications for conceptualizing and interpreting modera-
tion of DEMO effects. Finally, we demonstrate how to
derive conﬁdence intervals and conduct DEMO tests
fordirect,indirect,andtotaleffectsatselectedlevelsofthe
moderator variable. These procedures have been discussed
for mediated models that exclude moderation (MacKinnon
et al., 2002; Shrout & Bolger, 2002; Sobel, 1982) but have
notbeenaddressedformodelsthatcombinemoderationand
mediation.
The general DEMO presented here subsumes both
moderated mediation and mediated moderation. As noted
earlier,moderatedmediationreferstoamediatedeffectthat
variesacrosslevelsofamoderatorvariable.Inpathanalytic
terms,moderatedmediationmeansthateitherorbothofthe
paths from X to M and from M DEMO Y, which constitute the
indirecteffectof X on Y,varyacrosslevelsofthemoderator
MODERATIONANDMEDIATION
variable Z. Our framework accommodates moderation of
these paths and therefore DEMO directly to moderated
mediation. Mediated moderation means that an interaction
between an independent and moderator variable affects a
mediator variable that in turn affects DEMO outcome variable.
The interaction between the independent and moderator
variablessigniﬁesthattheeffectoftheindependentvariable
on the mediator variable depends on the level of the mod-
erator variable. Hence, in path analytic terms, mediated
moderationindicatesthatthepathfrom X to M variesacross
levels of Z, whereas the path from M to Y is unaffected by
Z. Viewing moderated mediation and mediated moderation
in terms of path analysis reveals DEMO, when moderated
mediationreferstomoderationofthepathfrom X to M but
not of the path DEMO M to Y, moderated mediation and
mediated moderation are equivalent from DEMO analytical
standpoint, and any distinction between them is a matter of
DEMO framing. When moderated mediation involves
moderation of the path from M to Y, moderated mediation
and mediated moderation are not analytically equivalent.
The partial overlap between moderated mediation and me-
diated moderation adds to the confusion DEMO these
terms (Muller et al., 2005). This confusion can be avoided
by combining moderation and mediation by using the gen-
eral path DEMO framework developed here. With this
framework,whetherresultsareinterpretedintermsofmod-

DEMO the framework we present relies on ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression and path analysis, the statistical
assumptions underlying these procedures merit attention
(DEMO, 1993; Bohrnstedt & Carter, 1971; J. Cohen, Cohen,
DEMO, & Aiken, 2003; Kenny, 1979; Pedhazur, 1997). These
assumptions are summarized as follows: (a) Variables are
measuredwithouterror;(b)DEMO;
(c) residuals are normally distributed with zero mean and
constant variance; (d) residuals are uncorrelated with one an-
otherandwiththepredictorvariablesintheequationinwhich
each residual appears; (e) relationships among variables are
unidirectional, thereby ruling out DEMO relationships and
feedback loops; (f) relationships among variables are additive
DEMO linear. Our framework adopts the ﬁrst ﬁve assumptions,
andwelaterdiscusshowtheframeworkcanbeadaptedwhen
these assumptions are violated. The additivity assumption,

regression equations that constitute our framework involve
linear relationships, thereby incorporating DEMO linearity as-

modiﬁed to accommodate nonlinear relationships.
Finally,afundamentalassumptionunderlyingourframe-
work is that the causal relationships among variables are

the functional form of a relationship DEMO not properly repre-

analysis, our DEMO does not itself generate evidence
that establishes causality. Rather, it yields DEMO of

causal structure of these relationships is correctly speciﬁed

Basic Mediated Model

this model depicts a direct effect of X on Y and an indirect
DEMO of X on Y mediated by M. The direct and indirect
effectsof X on Y canbeintegratedintoasingleequationby

equation DEMO which the terms on the right side are exclusively

Comparing Equation 12 with Equation 9 shows that,
whereas the ﬁrst stage moderation model DEMO the indi-

to DEMO moderation captures the notion that Z inﬂuences the
magnitude of the relationship between the other variables in the
model,whichisconsistentwithhowmoderationisdeﬁned(Aiken
& West, 1991). We should note, however, that moderation is
symmetric,suchthateitherofthevariablesinvolvedinatwo-way

moderates the relationship between X and M, then it can DEMO be
said that X moderates the relationship between Z and M. Desig-
nating X or Z asthemoderatorvariableisamatterofframing,and
the relevant statistical procedures are the DEMO regardless of
whether X or Z is framed as the moderator variable. For the
purposes of the framework developed here, we frame Z as the
moderator variable.
First Stage Moderation Model
The initial moderated model we DEMO is shown in
Figure 1B and incorporates Z as a moderator of the path
from X to M.2 We call this ﬁrst stage moderation DEMO
themoderatingeffectappliestotheﬁrststageoftheindirect
effect of X on Y. The regression equation for Y is provided
by Equation 4, the same as that for the basic mediated
model. The regression equation for M is given by Equation
5, which is typically used to evaluate the second condition
of the moderated causal DEMO approach. Substituting Equa-
tion 5 into Equation 4 gives the reduced form equation for
Y for the ﬁrst stage moderation model:

Second Stage Moderation Model
In the second stage moderation model, Z moderates the

The nature of the moderating effect of Z in the ﬁrst and

the following:

Equation 15 shows that Z affects both of the paths that
constitutetheindirecteffectof X on Y,whichisrepresented
by the DEMO term (aX5  aXZ5Z)(bM10  bMZ10Z). As
with the previous two models, the direct effect of X on Y,
which is represented by bX10, is unaffected by Z. The
intercept of the reduced form equation is again inﬂuenced
by Z, as shown by the terms bZ10Z,aZ5Z, and bMZ10Z in

Like the reduced DEMO equation for the ﬁrst and second
stage moderation model, the reduced DEMO equation for
the total effect moderation model contains Z2 and XZ2,
such that the moderating effect of Z on the relationship
between X DEMO Y depends on the level of Z . This can be
seen by expressing Equation 23 in a form similar to
Equation 14:
DEMO  b020 a05bM20 bX20 aX5bM20 X
 bZ20 aZ5bM20 a05bMZ20 aZ5bMZ20Z Z

LikeEquation14,Equation24showsthatthecoefﬁcienton
the interaction term XZ depends on the level of DEMO,as
reﬂected by the term aXZ5bMZ20Z.
The moderating effects of Z embodied by the total effect
moderation model can be seen by rewriting Equation DEMO in
terms of simple paths, as follows:
Y b020 a05bM20 DEMO aZ5bM20 a05bMZ20 Z aZ5bMZ20Z2

bM20eM5 bMZ20ZeM5. (25)
Equation 25 shows that DEMO affects the two paths that consti-
tute the indirect effect of X on Y, as indicated by the term
(aX5  aXZ5Z)(bM20  bMZ20Z), as well as the path repre-
sentingthedirecteffectof X on DEMO,whichcorrespondstothe
term (bX20  bXZ20Z). The reduced form equation also
DEMO that Z affects the intercept through bZ20Z,aZ5Z, and

yields simple paths and effects DEMO can be analyzed and

demonstrate.
Model DEMO and Interpretation
Theequationsforthemodelssummarizedabovecanbe
estimated with OLS regression, and coefﬁcients from the
DEMO can be tested with conventional procedures (J.
Cohen et al., 2003; Pedhazur, 1997). However, the re-
duced form equations contain products of regression co-
efﬁcients,whichmustbetestedwithproceduresthattake
into account sampling distributions of products of DEMO
dom variables. One procedure is based on methods for
deriving the variance of the product of two random
variables (Bohrnstedt & Goldberger, 1969; Goodman,
1960),ofwhichtheSobel(1982)approachisperhapsthe
best known (MacKinnon et al., 2002). With this proce-
dure,theproductoftworegressioncoefﬁcientsisdivided
by the square root of DEMO estimated variance, and the
resulting ratio is interpreted as a t DEMO Although this
procedure is useful, it relies on the assumption that DEMO
sampling distribution of the product of two random vari-
ables is normal, given that the procedure uses only the
variancetorepresentthedistributionoftheproduct.This
assumption is tenuous because the distribution of a prod-
uct is nonnormal, even when the variables constituting
the product are normally distributed (Anderson, 1984).
The foregoing DEMO can be relaxed with the boot-
strap (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993; Mooney & Duval, 1993;
Stine, 1989). The bootstrap generates a sampling distribu-
tionoftheproductoftworegressioncoefﬁcientsbyrepeat-
edly estimating the coefﬁcients with bootstrap samples,
DEMO of which contains N cases randomly sampled with
replacementfromtheoriginalsample,inwhich N isthesize
of the original sample. Coefﬁcient estimates from each
bootstrapsampleareusedtocomputetheproduct,andthese
products are DEMO ordered to locate percentile values that
boundthedesiredconﬁdenceinterval(e.g.,the2.5and97.5
percentiles for a 95% conﬁdence interval). Conﬁdence in-
tervals constructed in this manner should DEMO adjusted for
anydifferencebetweentheproductfromthefullsampleand
the median of the products estimated from the bootstrap
samples, yielding a bias-corrected conﬁdence interval
(Efron & Tibshirani, 1993; DEMO & Duval, 1993; Stine,
1989).Whenconstructingconﬁdenceintervals,aminimum
of 1,000 bootstrap samples should be used to accurately

locate the upper and lower bounds of the DEMO conﬁdence
interval (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993; Mooney & Duval,
DEMO).Thebootstraphasbeenusedtotestindirecteffectsin
mediated models (MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams,
2004; Shrout & Bolger, 2002) and can be extended to
modelsthatcombinemediationandmoderation,aswelater
illustrate.
DEMO noted earlier, simple effects can be computed by
substituting selected values DEMO Z into the reduced form
equations. When Z is a continuous variable, we recom-
mend the use of values that are substantively or practi-
callymeaningful(e.g.,aclinicalcutpoint).Ifsuchvalues
cannot be identiﬁed, we suggest the use of representative
scores in the distribution of Z , such as one standard
DEMO above and below its mean (Aiken & West,
1991). DEMO Z is a categorical variable, scores used to
code Z should DEMO used to obtain simple effects for each
category. Simple effects represented by single paths can
be tested with procedures for simple slopes (Aiken &DEMO
West, 1991), and simple effects that involve products of
paths, such as simple indirect and total effects, can be
tested with conﬁdence intervals derived from the boot-
strap. The form of the moderating effects DEMO Z can be
further clariﬁed by plotting simple paths and simple
effects for the selected values of Z.

Rothbard, 1999; Kossek, Colquitt, & Noe, 2001). Of the
respondents(age: M  39years),mostwerewomen(66%),
Caucasian (86%), DEMO (66%), and had completed an
undergraduate program (66%). Respondents held various
jobs ranging from clerical and blue collar positions to pro-
DEMO, medical, administrative, and faculty positions.
We examine a mediated model DEMO which feedback from
family members is posited to inﬂuence commitment to

family centrality to DEMO the use of categorical and
continuousmoderatorvariables,respectively.Feedbackwas
measuredwithﬁveitemsthatdescribedreactionstoperfor-

DEMO is outstanding). Satisfaction with family was mea-
sured with three items that described positive feelings to-
ward the family (e.g., In general, I am satisﬁed with my
family life). Commitment was measured with DEMO items
that described psychological attachment to the family (e.g.,
I DEMO a great sense of commitment to my family). Family
centrality was assessed with six items that described the
importance of family to life DEMO a whole (e.g., The most
important things that happen in life involve family). All
items used 7-point response scales in which higher DEMO
represented greater endorsement of the item (1  strongly
disagree,7 DEMO strongly agree). Prior to analysis, all contin-
uous measures were DEMO centered, whereas gender was
coded 0 for men and 1 for DEMO (Aiken & West, 1991).3
Analyses
For illustration, we analyzed DEMO total effect moderation
model,themostgeneraloftheeightmodelsshowninFigure
1. This model is represented by Equations 5 and 20, which
were estimated using SPSS (Version 14.0; 2005, SPSS
Inc.). The regression module was used to estimate coefﬁ-
cients for the full sample, and the constrained nonlinear
regression (CNLR) module was used to estimate coefﬁ-
cients from 1,000 bootstrap samples. Unlike DEMO regression
module,theCNLRmodulecontainsanalgorithmthatdraws
bootstrapsamples,estimatesregressioncoefﬁcientsforeach
sample, and writes the coefﬁcients to DEMO output ﬁle. We
used the default loss function of the CNLR module, which
minimizes the sum of squared residuals, thereby producing
OLS coefﬁcient DEMO
Individual coefﬁcients from Equations 5 and 20 were
tested using the standard errors reported by the regression
module.Expressionsthatcontainedproductsofcoefﬁcients,
such as indirect and total DEMO, were tested with bias-
corrected conﬁdence intervals based on the bootstrap DEMO
ﬁcient estimates generated by the CNLR module. These
conﬁdenceintervalswereconstructedbyopeningtheSPSS

opening these ﬁles with Excel DEMO Using Equation 25,

the moderator variables (0 and 1 for gender, one standard

formulas were applied to coefﬁcient estimates from each

effect coding or contrast coding when independent or moderator
variables are nominal or ordinal. For instance, if a moderator
variable represents two experimental groups of equal size, then

should be emphasized that, when a DEMO equation contains
product terms, the coefﬁcients on the variables that constitute DEMO
product represent conditional effects, such that the coefﬁcient on
each variable DEMO the effect of that variable when the other
variable in the product equals zero (Aiken & West, 1991).

Discussion
This article presents a general framework for combining
moderationandmediationthatintegratesmoderatedregres-
sion analysis and path analysis. The framework can incor-
17
porate moderation into DEMO combination of paths that con-
stitute a mediated model. The framework also translates
results from regression equations used to estimate model
parametersintoexpressionsthatshowhowindividualpaths
and their DEMO direct, indirect, and total effects vary
across levels of the moderator variable. Conﬁdence inter-
valsandsigniﬁcancetestsareprovidedforindividualpaths
anddirect,indirect,andtotaleffects,aswellascomparisons
ofpathsandeffectsacrosslevelsofthemoderatorvariable.
To facilitate interpretation, simple slopes for each path and
effect can be plotted to reveal DEMO form of the moderating
effects. Thus, the framework presented here offers DEMO
straightforward approach for analyzing models that com-
binemoderationandmediation,yieldingdetailedresultsfor
individual paths of the model along with summary results
for the indirect and total effects DEMO by the model.
The general framework presented here offers several ad-
vantages over current approaches used to combine moder-
ation and mediation. First, the framework pinpoints the
paths of a mediated model that are moderated and DEMO
statistical tests of moderation for each path. Second, the
frameworkclariﬁestheformofeachmoderatingeffectwith
tests DEMO simple paths and corresponding plots of simple
slopes.Third,theframeworkgivesestimatesoftheindirect
effect transmitted through the mediator variable and shows
how this effect varies across levels of DEMO moderator vari-
able. Fourth, the framework shows how moderation of
indirect DEMO direct effects can be combined to assess mod-
eration of the total effect captured by the model.
Finally, our framework subsumes moderated mediation
and mediated moderation and clariﬁes how these terms
relate to one another. Speciﬁcally, when moderated media-
tion refers to a ﬁrst-stage moderation model, moderated
mediation and mediated moderation are analytically equiv-
alent.Inthiscase,weconcurwithMulleretal.(2005),who
concluded that moderated mediation and mediated moder-
ation are “two sides of the same DEMO (p. 862). Unlike
Muller et al., however, we argue DEMO interpreting a ﬁrst-
stagemoderationmodelintermsofmoderatedmediationor
mediatedmoderationisstrictlyamatterofconceptualfram-
ing. Muller et al. proposed that moderated mediation and
mediated moderation can be distinguished on the basis of

seem that tests of differences in effects, such as those DEMO in
Table 2, would depend on the scores used to represent DEMO and
high values because the use of scores that are further apart will
producelargerdifferencesineffects.However,increasingthegap
between the scores increases the standard error of the DEMO
between the effects, such that tests comparing effects at low and

the change in the coefﬁcient on XZ when DEMO and MZ are
added to a regression equation that uses Y as the dependent
variableand X, Z,and XZ aspredictors.AccordingtoMuller
et al. (2005), an increase in the coefﬁcient on XZ signiﬁes
moderated mediation, whereas DEMO decrease indicates medi-
ated moderation. However, Muller et al. further stated DEMO
this pattern holds only for special cases of moderated me-
diationandmediatedmoderation.Forinstance,Mulleretal.
indicated that an increase in the XZ coefﬁcient represents
moderatedmediationonlywhenthetotaleffectrelating X to
DEMO is not moderated by Z, which means that moderation of
theindirecteffectmustbeoffsetbyopposingmoderationof
DEMO direct effect. Muller et al. also stated that a decrease in
the XZ coefﬁcientsigniﬁesmediatedmoderationonlywhen
thetotaleffectof X on Y ismoderatedby Z,whichprecludes
cases in which DEMO of the indirect effect is accom-
panied by opposing moderation of the direct effect. In
contrast,weassertthatmediatedmoderationpointstomod-
eration of the ﬁrst stage of an DEMO effect; moderated
mediationinvolvesmoderationoftheﬁrststage,thesecond
stage, or both stages of the indirect effect; and neither
mediated moderation nor moderated mediation stipulates
whether the direct effect is moderated. The partial overlap
between moderated mediation and mediated moderation
DEMO attempts to distinguish them empirically. In-
stead, we recommend that researchers DEMO moderated
mediation and mediated moderation into moderated path
models, evaluate the DEMO on the basis of their own
merits, and forgo attempts to DEMO whether results
support moderated mediation versus mediated moderation.
Although our framework has several advantages over
current approaches for combining moderation and media-
tion, it has several limitations that signify areas for further
development.Onelimitationisthatwepresentedtheframe-

able through each mediator variable is inﬂuenced by the
moderator variable. Likewise, additional independent and

we have presented our framework in simple terms, the
principles upon DEMO it is based can be applied to more
complex models.
Otherlimitationsinvolvetheassumptionsunderlyingour
framework, which might not be satisﬁed in practice. For
instance, because it DEMO on regression analysis and path
analysis, our framework incorporates the assumption DEMO
variables are measured without error. Violations of this
assumption can be addressed by using structural equation
modeling with latent variables, which takes measurement
error into account (Bollen, 1989; Jo¨reskog & So¨rbom,
1996). The regression equations that underlie our frame-
workcanbetranslatedintostructuralequationsinwhich X,
Y, M, DEMO Z are replaced by their latent variable counter-
parts. If Z is a categorical variable, such as gender, moder-
ation can be analyzed DEMO using the multiple groups proce-
dure (Jo¨reskog & So¨rbom, 1996; DEMO et al., 1998). This
procedure is similar to the subgroup DEMO discussed
earlier but includes tests of differences in parameters be-
tweensubgroupsaswellasestimatesofdirect,indirect,and
total effects for each subgroup. If Z is continuous, then the
requiredanalyticalproceduresaremoreinvolvedbecauseof
the complexities of estimating interactions with continuous
latentvariablesinstructuralequationmodeling(Jo¨reskog&
Yang, 1996; Li et al., 1998; Marsh, Wen, & Hau, DEMO;
Schumacker, & Marcoulides, 1998). Nonetheless, the basic
logic DEMO our framework remains applicable.
Another assumption underlying our framework is that
variables are measured at the interval level. When the in-
dependentormoderatorvariablesareordinalorcategorical,
dummy DEMO can be used in the regression equations
entailedbyourframework(J.Cohenetal.,2003;Pedhazur,
1997), as illustrated by our example with gender as a
moderatorvariable.Whenthedependentvariableisordinal
DEMO categorical, probit or logistic regression can be used
(Hosmer&Lemeshow,2000;MacKinnon&Dwyer,1993).
For an ordinal or categorical mediator variable, dummy
variables can be used when the mediator variable is a
predictor, as in Equation 20, and probit or logistic regres-
sioncanbeusedwhenthemediatorvariableisanoutcome,
as in Equation 5 (Goodman, 1979). Methods are available
for calculating direct, indirect, and total effects in path
models with ordinal and categorical variables (Winship &
Mare,1984),andthesemethodscanbeextendedtocompute
effects at selected levels of moderator variables.
Our framework also assumes that residuals are normally
distributed with zero DEMO and constant variance and are
uncorrelated with one another and with the independent
variables in the equation where each residual appears. De-
viations from DEMO can be handled with the bootstrap,
andnonconstantvariancesigniﬁesheteroscedasticity,which
can be addressed with generalized least squares (Kennedy,
1998) or weighted least squares (J. Cohen et al., 2003).
Methods for handling correlations among residuals and
between residuals and independent variables have been de-
MODERATIONANDMEDIATION
19
veloped (Bohrnstedt & Carter, 1971; J. Cohen et al., 2003;
James & Singh, 1978; Kennedy, 1998; Kenny, DEMO; Ped-
hazur, 1997). In principle, these methods can be DEMO to
the framework presented here, although to our knowledge,
the DEMO of these methods for models that combine
moderationandmediationhasnotbeenextensivelystudied.
Path analysis and regression analysis also rest on the
assumption that relationships among variables are additive,DEMO
linear,andunidirectional.Wepreviouslyexplainedhowour
frameworkaddressesviolationsoftheadditivityassumption
by using product terms that produce regression equations
that are nonadditive with respect to variables but additive
withrespecttoparameters(Berry,1993;Neteretal.,DEMO).
Violations of the linearity assumption can be handled in a
similarmanner,giventhatcurvilinearitycanbeviewedasa
special case of moderation in which the effect of an inde-
DEMO variable depends on the level of the independent
variable itself. On the basis of this logic, X can be substi-
tuted for Z in the equations that constitute our framework,
andreducedformequationscanbeusedtoidentifythepaths
of the model that DEMO curvilinear functions of X. Simple
pathsthatcapturetheeffectsof X on Y atspeciﬁedlevelsof
X can be computed by taking derivatives of the reduced
form equations with respect DEMO X and substituting values of
X into the resulting expression (cf. DEMO & West, 1991).
When relationships are reciprocal, nonrecursive modeling
procedures can be extended to incorporate moderation
(Berry,1984;Bollen,1989;James&Singh,1978;Jo¨reskog
&So¨rbom, 1996; Kenny, 1979).
A ﬁnal assumption DEMO our framework is that the
causal structure of the model is correctly speciﬁed. We
makenoclaimthatresultsfromourframeworkprovethata
particular model is correct, given that models with alterna-
tive causal ﬂows might ﬁt the data equally well (Lee &
DEMO, 1990; MacCallum, Wegener, Uchino, & Fab-
rigar,1993).Moreover,DEMO
assumptionsembeddedinamodelmustbeaddressedbefore
themodelisanalyzed,giventhatthecausalstructureofthe
modeldictatestheequationsthatshouldbeestimated(Dun-
can, 1975; Pedhazur, 1997). DEMO useful approach to evalu-
atecausalityformodelssuchasthoseinourframeworkhas
been developed by Rubin and colleagues (DEMO, 1986,
1988; Little & Rubin, 2000; Rubin, 1974, 1978) and has
been called the Rubin causal model (RCM). DEMO RCM
deﬁnes a causal effect in counterfactual terms as the differ-
encebetweenscoresonanoutcomevariableifanindividual
had been observed at different levels of the predictor vari-
able. This DEMO is counterfactual in that an individual
cannot be observed at different levels on the predictor
variable at the same instant. Instead, each individual is
observedatonelevelofthepredictorvariable,andscoreson
the outcome variable across individuals are compared to
infer the DEMO of the causal effect. Such inferences
relyontheassumptionthatindividualsareequivalentinall
respects other than their standing on the predictor variable.
This assumption is defensible when individuals are ran-
DEMO assigned to levels of the predictor variable, as when
the variable DEMO treatment and control groups in a
trueexperiment.Withoutrandomization,thisassumptionis
difﬁcult to defend, DEMO it becomes more tenable when
individuals are matched on variables that might be con-
founded with the predictor or when such variables are
statistically DEMO (Rubin, 1974, 1978).
Applications of the RCM to models DEMO involve media-
tion (Holland, 1988; Robins & Greenland, 1992; DEMO,
2004)revealbasicdifﬁcultiesindrawingcausalinferences.
For example, in a single study, individuals cannot be ran-
domly assigned to both the independent variable and the
mediator DEMO, given that the latter is a measured out-
come of the DEMO When individuals are not randomly
assigned to the mediator variable, they DEMO differ in ways
other than their standing on that variable. If these differ-
ences are correlated with the dependent variable, estimates
ofthepathsfromtheindependentandmediatorvariablesto
thedependentvariablearebiased(Holland,1988).Thisbias
canbelessenedbystatisticallycontrollingforvariablesthat
are correlated with the mediator and the dependent vari-
DEMO, although this approach is generally inferior to ran-
domization(Shadishetal.,2002)DEMO,relationships
amongtheindependent,mediating,anddependentvariables
can be estimated in separate randomized experiments, DEMO
theresultingrelationshipscanbecombinedtoestimatepath
models that use meta-analysis (Hunter & Schmidt, 1996;
Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995), although effect sizes from
such studies will partly reﬂect the strength of the manipu-

DEMO and Conclusion
Studiesthatcombinemoderationandmediationarewide-
spread in psychology research. Methods currently used to
combine moderation and mediation have important limita-
tions that conceal the nature of DEMO underlying moderated
and mediated effects. The general framework developed
here overcomes these limitations and clariﬁes how the in-
dividual paths that constitute a model DEMO their associated
direct, indirect, and total effects vary across levels of a
moderator variable. We developed and illustrated this
frameworkbyusingabasicmediatedmodelwithonemod-
eratorvariableandshowedhowresultsfromtheframework
avoid problems DEMO current approaches used to combine
moderation and mediation. We also described how the
frameworkcanbeextendedtohandlemorecomplexmodels
and how violations of assumptions underlying the frame-

work can be addressed. In summary, the framework pre-
sented here promises to offer better substantive answers to
theoretical questions DEMO combine moderation and media-
tion.
