Summary
This paper describes the development and validation of a multidimensional measure of
organizational climate, the Organizational Climate Measure (OCM), based upon Quinn and
Rohrbaugh’s Competing Values model. A sample of 6869 employees across 55 manufacturing
organizations completed the questionnaire. The 17 DEMO contained within the measure had
acceptable levels of reliability and were factorially distinct. Concurrent validity was measured
by correlating employees’ ratings with managers’ and DEMO descriptions of managerial
practices and organizational characteristics. Predictive validity was established using measures
of productivity and innovation. The OCM also discriminated effectively between organiza-
DEMO, demonstrating good discriminant validity. The measure offers researchers a relatively
comprehensive DEMO ﬂexible approach to the assessment of organizational members’ experience
and promises applied and theoretical beneﬁts. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Introduction
Central to most, if not all, models of organizational behavior are DEMO of the work environment,
referred to generally as ‘organizational climate’ (DEMO, 1988). Primarily understood as an inter-
vening variable between the DEMO of an organization and the behavior of its members, and attempt-
DEMO to understand how employees experience their organizations, the concept has inspired DEMO
descriptions and operationalizations. Despite the level of interest surrounding organizational climate,
however, there are few well-validated measures of the construct. In this paper, we describe the
development of a new measure of organizational climate which is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated.

The climate concept
While climate has DEMO consistently described as employees’ perceptions of their organizations, the
construct has DEMO over the years from conﬂicting deﬁnitions and inconsistencies in operationali-
zation. The dominant approach conceptualizes climate as employees’ shared perceptions of organiza-
tional events, practices, and procedures. These perceptions are assumed to be primarily descriptive
rather than affective or evaluative (Schneider & Reichers, 1983). More recent DEMO contradicts this
view, suggesting strong evaluative or affective components (Patterson, DEMO, & West, 2004). At the
individual level of analysis, DEMO to as ‘psychological climate’ (James & Jones, 1974), these per-
ceptions represent how work environments are cognitively appraised and represented in terms DEMO their
meaning to and signiﬁcance for individual employees in organizations (James & Jones, 1974; James &
Sells, 1981).
Most empirical studies have used an aggregate unit of analysis, such as the work group, department,
or organization (hence group, departmental, and organizational climate DEMO). Such climates
have been operationally constructed by aggregating individual scores to the appropriate level and using
the mean to represent climate at that DEMO The rationale behind aggregating individual data to a unit
level is the assumption that organizational collectives have their own climate and that these can DEMO
identiﬁed through the demonstration of signiﬁcant differences in climate between units and signiﬁcant
agreement in perceptions within units (James, 1982). Perceptual agreement DEMO a shared assign-
ment of psychological meaning allowing individual perceptions to be aggregated and treated as a
higher-level construct. Most research is now focused DEMO aggregate rather than on psychological
climate (Schneider, Bowen, Ehrhart, & Holcombe, 2000). This paper therefore describes the develop-
ment of a measure of organizational-level climate that is intended to support research focusing on
DEMO climate, given the current emphasis on organizational level climate in both DEMO
and research (Schneider, Smith, & Goldstein, 2000).
Climate and culture
Consensus is not easily achieved in this area, however, since DEMO are both theoretical differences and
disciplinary differences in what climate represents. Many of these differences are revealed in the
debate about the distinction between DEMO climate and culture. Indeed, the two terms are
sometimes used interchangeably. DEMO and Svyantek (1999), for example, used the Organiza-
tional Climate Questionnaire (OCQ) to operationally deﬁne dimensions of organizational culture.
While this DEMO paradoxical, the OCQ’s authors, Litwin and Stringer (1968), did DEMO the vari-
ables measured by the OCP as assessing the shared beliefs and values of organizational members that
constitute the perceived work environment, and shared beliefs and values are often incorporated as
central elements in deﬁnitions DEMO organizational culture. Hence the problems of conceptual and deﬁni-
tional overlap.
There is no doubt that culture and climate are similar concepts since both DEMO employees’ experi-
ences of their organizations. Organizational climate, according to Schneider (2000), represents the
descriptions of the things that happen to employees DEMO an organization. Climate (he suggests) is beha-
viorally oriented. Climates for safety or service, for example, represent the patterns of behavior that DEMO
port safety or service. Organizational culture, in contrast, comes to light when employees are asked why
these patterns exist. The question is answered DEMO relation to shared values, common assumptions, and
patterns of beliefs held by organizational members, and it is these which deﬁne organizational culture.
Svyantek and Bott (2004) propose the deﬁnitions which help distinguish between climate DEMO cul-
ture. Organizational culture is deﬁned as a set of shared values and norms held by employees that guide

their interactions with peers, management, DEMO clients. Organizational climate is more behaviorally
oriented in that climates for creativity, innovation, safety, or service, for example, may be found in
the workplace. These climates represent employees’ perceptions of organizational policies, practices,
and procedures, and subsequent patterns of interactions and behaviors that support creativity, innova-
tion, safety, or service in the organization. Thus climate can be understood as a surface manifestation
of culture (Schein, 1985; Schneider, 1990). Exploring organizational cultural values and assumptions
in relation to, DEMO example, individualism/collectivism can help explain employees’ perceptions of the
climate DEMO teamwork in their organizations.
The quest to differentiate the concepts has inﬂuenced approaches to measurement, with most cli-
mate research utilizing quantitatively based questionnaire measures applied comparatively across sev-
eral organizations, while most culture researchers have advocated the use of qualitative measures and a
focus on single organizations. DEMO approach taken in the research described here derives from climate
research and involves the development of a quantitatively based questionnaire measure of organiza-
tional DEMO What dimensions should such a measure seek to tap?
The dimensions of climate
An initial assumption of theory and research in the area DEMO organizational climate was that social envir-
onments could be characterized by a limited number of dimensions. For example, Campbell, Dunnette,
Lawler, and Weick (1970) identiﬁed four dimensions common to a number of climate DEMO (indivi-
dual autonomy; degree of structure imposed on the situation; DEMO orientation; and consideration,
warmth, and support). James and his colleagues (James & James, 1989; James & McIntyre, 1996;
DEMO & Sells, 1981) describe four dimensions they identiﬁed across a number of different work con-
texts: (1) role stress and lack of harmony; (2) job challenge and autonomy; (3) leadership facilitation
DEMO support; and (4) work group cooperation, friendliness, and warmth. DEMO suggested that indivi-
duals developed a global or holistic perception of their work environment (e.g., James & Jones, 1974),
which could DEMO applied to any number of contexts and industries.
However, over the DEMO the number of climate dimensions identiﬁed as targets of assessment
has proliferated, leading to confusion and slow theoretical progress. For example, Glick’s (1985)
review of the ﬁeld described an abbreviated list of climate dimensions DEMO leader’s psychological
distance (Payne & Mansﬁeld, 1978), managerial trust and consideration (Gavin & Howe, 1975),
communication ﬂow (Drexler, 1977), open-mindedness (Payne & Mansﬁeld, 1978), risk orientation
(Lawler, DEMO, & Oldham, 1974), service quality (Schneider, Parkington, & DEMO, 1980); equity
(James, 1982), and centrality (Joyce & Slocum, 1979). Since Glick’s review, the development
of new climate DEMO has continued. For example, the Business Organization Climate Index
(Payne & Pheysey, 1971) was revised in 1992 with the addition of scales DEMO concern for
customer service, the impact of information quality, and ability to manage culture (Payne, Brown,
& Gaston, 1992).
Schneider (1975, 1990, 2000) eschews the use of general multidimensional measures DEMO climate and
argues for a facet-speciﬁc climate approach where climate has a focus and is tied to something of inter-
est. Schneider suggests that DEMO dimensions of organizational climate will differ depending on the pur-
pose of the investigation and the criterion of interest, and that general measures of organizational
climate will contain dimensions that are not relevant for each speciﬁc DEMO This line of argument
has encouraged the development of measures of several dimensions of climate such as service
(Schneider, 1990) and innovation (DEMO & West, 1998; West, 1990).
Rather than considering the DEMO and domain-speciﬁc approaches to organizational climate as
opposite sides of one coin, it is worthwhile viewing both as a valid basis for the investigation of work

environment perceptions. Which approach is favored DEMO largely on the interests of the investiga-
tion. The global approach is advantageous in terms of its provision of an overall snapshot of organiza-
DEMO functioning, allowing a view of the ways whole organizations operate (Ashkanasy, Wilderom, &
Peterson, 2000). A multidimensional global approach can DEMO highlight subcultures and identify the
effects of particular dimensions on speciﬁc outcome measures, such as organizational productivity or
innovation (Ashkanasy et al., 2000). The domain-speciﬁc approach contributes more precise and tar-
geted information for DEMO in areas such as the improvement of customer satisfaction and the improve-
ment of company safety. What has research revealed about the relationship between DEMO
climate and outcomes of theoretical interest?
Links between climate and outcomes
Research has suggested that climate perceptions are associated with a variety of DEMO outcomes at
the individual, group, and organizational levels. These include leader behavior (Rousseau, 1988;
Rentsch, 1990), turnover intentions (Rousseau, 1988; Rentsch, 1990), job satisfaction (Mathieu,
Hoffman, & DEMO, 1993; James & Tetrick, 1986; James & Jones, 1980), individual job performance
(Brown & Leigh, 1996; Pritchard & Karasick, 1973), and organizational performance (Lawler et
al., 1974; Patterson et al., 2004).
As a global or summary construct, organizational climate DEMO been related to several important work
outcomes. Brown and Leigh (1996) demonstrated that perceptions of a motivating and involving orga-
nizational climate were DEMO related to supervisory ratings of performance. Organizational cli-
mate has been shown to relate to group process variables across organizational levels (Grifﬁn &
DEMO, 1997). Day and Bedeian (1991) showed that employees performed DEMO (as rated by
their supervisors) in organizational climates they perceived as structured (unambiguous) and suppor-
tive of risk.
Domain-speciﬁc climate has also DEMO linked with several important work outcomes. Using their
model of service climate, Schneider and colleagues demonstrated that service climate is related to cus-
tomer perceptions of service quality (Schneider, 1980; Schneider et al., 1980; Schneider, White, &
Paul, 1998). Safety climate has been DEMO linked with safety behaviors in accidents teams
(Hofmann & Stetzer, 1996), and safety compliance in the health sector (Murphy, Gershon, & DeJoy,
1996). Research in the area of innovation suggests that DEMO climate factors inﬂuence levels of
innovative behavior in health care and top management teams (West & Wallace, 1991; West &
Anderson, 1996).
While progress in understanding that dimensions of climate predict outcomes in DEMO variety of studies,
knowledge develops haphazardly in this ﬁeld in a way that appears not to be synergistic or to lead to
theory DEMO This is partly because virtually every study referred to above uses a different mea-
sure of climate, each assessing rather different dimensions. The accruing knowledge is not cumulative,
hence the study we describe here which DEMO to develop an inclusive, robust and theoretically based
approach to the DEMO of climate. Moreover, many instruments are not validated, are poorly
designed, and fail to specify the level of analysis.
Existing measures of climate
The lack of a theoretical basis for many climate instruments has resulted DEMO much of the variation in
climate dimensions employed in different measures. For example, Wilderom, Glunk, and Maslowski

(2000) located and summarized 10 DEMO relating climate to organizational performance. They
reported that different aspects of climate emerged as important in different studies. This diffuse pattern
of results is DEMO to be due, in part, to the variety of methods of assessment of climate employed in
these studies.
The inability to draw clear DEMO conclusions through a lack of theory and subsequent
inconsistent operationalization of climate is compounded by the fact that most climate
instruments have not been DEMO With the exception of some domain-speciﬁc climates such as
Schneider’s service climate (Schneider et al., 1998), there are few measures with demonstrated DEMO
bility and validity.
One of the best-known general measures of organizational climate is the Organizational Climate
Questionnaire (OCQ) by Litwin and Stringer (1968). It comprises 50 items that assess nine dimensions
of climate. A DEMO of studies (e.g., Sims & LaFollette, 1975; Muchinsky, 1976) have suggested that
a six-factor structure is more appropriate and pointed out DEMO the existing nine scales showed poor
split-half reliabilities. A review by Rogers, Miles, and Biggs (1980) showed that most studies had
found DEMO factors and that there was virtually no agreement among researchers regarding which items
loaded best on the different factors. They concluded that the OCQ DEMO validity and was not a con-
sistent measurement device. Such measurement problems are not unusual in this area of research and
prompted the development DEMO the measure described here.
A number of culture questionnaires have been published over the last 25 years, but they can also be
seen as measures of climate as they tap the surface manifestations of underlying cultural DEMO
(Schein, 2000). Again, these instruments suffer from a number DEMO problems including a lack of a the-
oretical basis, little validity DEMO (Ashkanasy et al., 2000), little or no conﬁrmatory studies and/
or small sample sizes used for their development.
A further methodological DEMO of climate research is the vague or poorly speciﬁed descriptive
level of items in many climate measures. Each climate questionnaire item should clearly focus DEMO the
speciﬁc collective unit which corresponds to the climate being studied (DEMO, department, or organiza-
tion). Unfortunately, in many studies respondents DEMO not been instructed to focus on a speciﬁc orga-
nizational unit, DEMO rather to provide descriptions relating to their ‘work environments’ (Howe, 1977;
Schneider & Reichers, 1983). This ambiguity in the frame of reference of climate items can lead to
individuals describing perceptions of different DEMO of the organization, some assuming the question-
naire asks them to DEMO their department and others assuming the referent is the organization
(Rousseau, 1988).
A related issue concerns the type of respondents included in DEMO of organizational climate. Orga-
nizational climate is a characteristic of an entire organization and, as Wilderom et al. (2000) argue, ‘it
seems DEMO that researchers investigate all sorts of organizational members, representative of all DEMO
various hierarchical, departmental, divisional and/or professional entities’ (p. 207)DEMO However, investi-
gations often focus only on managerial employees (Gordon & DiTomaso, 1992; Kotter & Heskett,
1992; Sheridan, 1992; Denison, 2001; Denison & Mishra, 1995; Weber, 1996). Clearly, DEMO inclusive-
ness, we need measures of organizational climate that assess the DEMO of employees throughout
the workforce. The content and wording of such measures should therefore be relevant and compre-
hensible to all organizational members.
This DEMO describes the development of a global multidimensional measure of organizational
climate intended to address the conceptual and methodological issues outlined above. The
measure is DEMO to be theoretically grounded, to explicitly and consistently specify the appropriate
DEMO of reference, and to be applicable across a range of work DEMO and to target all employee
levels (lower level as well as DEMO employees). We report data, from a large sample of
employees DEMO organizations, describing its factor structure and internal reliability, and assessing the

measure’s discriminant and consensual validity and (using separate source data) concurrent and pre-
dictive validity. First, we DEMO the Competing Values framework, which underpins our measure.
Competing Values model
DEMO tackle the problem of what dimensions to include in a measure of organizational climate by adopt-
ing a clear theoretical framework to drive this DEMO In choosing a framework we were mindful of the
need to clearly anchor the measure at the organizational level. The measure had to assess DEMO broad class
of organizational, rather than psychological variables that constitute the DEMO context for
individual actions and that therefore enable comparative studies of organizational climate. We propose
that one meta-theoretical model, the Competing Values model (DEMO & Rohrbaugh, 1983; Quinn &
McGrath, 1985; Gifford, Zammuto, & Goodman, 2002), provides a framework of values that underlie
DEMO climates. The model represents broad managerial ideologies that have emerged over
time (the content of these ideologies are discussed below). Building on Beyer’s (1981) work on ideol-
ogies in organizations, Zammuto, Gifford, and Goodman (2000) argue that as managerial ideologies
become institutionalized they form DEMO common basis for the ideologies of individual organizations,
imported via education, consultants, training, and management books. As a result, Western managers
DEMO from a common, limited set of managerial ideologies that are the DEMO for the assump-
tions, values, and beliefs on which individual organizations’ cultures are based. Differences in which
parts of these broad managerial ideologies DEMO imported into organizations’ ideologies lead to differ-
ences in organizational cultures’ (DEMO et al., 2000, p. 264). The essential point is that an orga-
nization’s ideology and culture will shape decision-making and action in DEMO organization (Beyer,
1981; Zammuto et al., 2000), and DEMO will play an important role in the development of
its climate.
The Competing Values model, developed in a series of articles and studies by Quinn and colleagues
(e.g., Quinn & Rohrbaugh, 1981, 1983; Quinn & McGrath, 1985), proposes that organizational effec-
tiveness criteria in the literature can best be understood when organized along fundamental dimen-
sions—ﬂexibility versus DEMO and internal versus external orientation. The framework’s four
quadrants describe four broad domains of valued outcomes and associated managerial ideologies about
the means through DEMO these outcomes may be achieved. It calls attention to how opposing values
exist in organizations and how ‘individual organizations are likely to embrace different DEMO of
values that are reﬂected in their desired ends and in the means to attain them, such as their structural
designs and mechanisms of co-ordination and control’ (Zammuto & O’Connor, 1992, p. 711). The
intention of the model is to encapsulate into one framework the major DEMO to organizational
values and effectiveness over the last 100 years.
A major strength of this model is its derivation from four major schools of DEMO of organizational
effectiveness, reﬂecting long traditions in management and organizational psychology:DEMO

The human relations approach (internal focus and ﬂexibility in relation DEMO the environment) reﬂects
the tradition derived from the socio-technical (Emery & Trist, 1965) and human relations schools
(e.g., McGregor, 1960). This approach emphasizes the well-being, growth and commitment of the
community of workers within an organization.
The internal process approach (internal focus and tight control within the organization) reﬂects a
Tayloristic concern with formalization and internal control of the system in order that resources
are efﬁciently used.
The DEMO systems approach (external focus and ﬂexible relationships with the environment)
DEMO the interaction and adaptation of the organization in its environment, with DEMO

seeking resources and innovating in response DEMO environmental (or market) demands (Shipper &
White, 1983).
DEMO The rational goal approach (external focus but with tight control within DEMO organization) reﬂects a
rational economic model of organizational functioning in which DEMO emphasis is upon productivity
and goal achievement (Hall, 1980; Clinebell, 1984).
By combining these orientations into one model, Quinn and colleagues aimed to provide a broad
conceptual map of the domains of theory DEMO the ﬁeld over the last 60 years. Such a map is useful in
identifying the required topography of a climate measure, applicable to a wide range of organizations.
The model is also useful in reﬂecting the DEMO for implementing those values in terms of managerial
practices, and the DEMO or outcomes which are emphasized or which compete in each domain.
It is important, however, to recognize that the model does not propose DEMO organizations can be
located predominantly in one quadrant but, reﬂecting the DEMO mix of competing views and perspec-
tives in organizations, proposes that DEMO will be active in, and give emphasis to, each domain,
but with differing strengths. Quinn (1988) argued that a balance of DEMO organizational values is
required for organizational effectiveness. Similarly, we suggest that DEMO will not have strong
climates in relation to each of the dimensions we identify within any one quadrant but that the strength
of emphasis DEMO vary both across quadrants and across dimensions within quadrants. The value of the
model for the development of a climate measure is that it DEMO inclusiveness and ensures that dimen-
sions tap the core values of organizations.
Identifying climate dimensions
Dimensions were generated within domains to ensure that there DEMO an adequate sample of dimensions
identiﬁed within each of the four broadly conceptualized domains. In order to develop subscales that
reﬂected each of these DEMO domains, we searched the literatures referred to above to develop such DEMO
inclusive set of dimensions. We selected those dimensions that were most frequently utilized in
research studies from 1960 to 2000 on climate and that DEMO into the competing values model with
a relatively unambiguous location in one of the four quadrants. This process was iterative, involving a
large number of meetings to achieve consensus by members of the research team. In DEMO, where no
suitable dimension could be found in the literature we DEMO an appropriate construct (e.g., the
concept of reﬂexivity as a dimension within the open systems quadrant).
Debates and conceptual analyses among the DEMO and ultimately psychometric analyses served to
sharpen our conceptualization of the nature and structure of organizational climate, located in the
Competing Values model, DEMO well as to identify deﬁciencies in the dimension pool. The key question
addressed was ‘Does the pool adequately reﬂect the four domains of the DEMO Values model?’
Below we present the Competing Values model and the climate scales which we attributed to each of
the quadrants represented in DEMO model. We did not attempt to create an equal number of dimensions
and scales in each quadrant since some dimensions are inherently more complex DEMO multifaceted
(e.g., human relations) than others (internal process).
The Human Relations Model (internal focus, ﬂexible orientations) has norms and values associated
with belonging, trust, and cohesion, achieved through means such as training and human resource
development. Coordination and control are accomplished through empowerment DEMO participation,
and interpersonal relations are supportive, cooperative, and trusting in nature. Climate dimensions
which we identiﬁed as representing this quadrant are:
DEMO employee welfare —the extent to which the organization values and cares for employees (e.g.,
Robinson & Rousseau, 1994; Guest, 1998);

M. G. PATTERSON ET AL.
autonomy —designing jobs in ways which DEMO employees wide scope to enact work (e.g., Cherns,
1976; DEMO, 1991);
participation —employees have considerable inﬂuence over decision-making (e.g., Miller &
Monge, 1986; Hollander & Offerman, 1990; Heller, DEMO, Strauss, & Wilpert, 1998);
communication —the free sharing of information throughout the organization (e.g., Callan, 1993;
Hargie & Tourish, 2000);
emphasis on training —a concern with developing employee skills (e.g., Gattiker, 1995; Morrow,
Jarrett, & Rupinski, 1997);DEMO
integration—the extent of interdepartmental trust and cooperation (e.g., Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967;
Nauta & Sanders, 2000);
supervisory support —the extent to which employees experience support and understanding from
their immediate supervisor (e.g., Cummins, 1990; Eisenberger et al., 2002).
In the Internal DEMO Model (internal focus, control orientation) the emphasis is on stability, where
the effects of environmental uncertainty are ignored or minimized. Coordination and DEMO are
achieved by adherence to formal rules and procedures. The Internal Process Model represents the clas-
sic bureaucracy. Scales which reﬂect this model are:DEMO
formalization —a concern with formal rules and procedures (e.g., Pugh, DEMO, Hinings, &
Turner, 1968; Hall, 1991);
tradition DEMO extent to which established ways of doing things are valued (e.g., Coch & French,
1948).
The emphasis of the Open Systems DEMO (external focus and ﬂexible orientation) is on readiness,
change and innovation, where norms and values are associated with growth, resource acquisition, crea-
tivity and adaptation. Climate dimensions which are likely to reﬂect this DEMO are:
ﬂexibility —an orientation toward change (e.g., Garrahan & Stewart, 1992; King & Anderson,
1995);
innovation —the extent of encouragement and support for new ideas and innovative approaches
(e.g., West & Farr, 1990);
outward focus —the extent to which the organization is responsive to the needs of the customer and
the marketplace in DEMO (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982; West & Farr, 1990);
DEMO —a concern with reviewing and reﬂecting upon objectives, strategies, and work pro-
cesses, in order to adapt to the wider environment (West, 1996, 2000).
The primary emphasis in the Rational Goal Model (DEMO focus and control orientation) is on the
pursuit and attainment of DEMO objectives, where norms and values are associated with produc-
tivity, efﬁciency, goal fulﬁllment, and performance feedback. Climate dimensions which might reﬂect
this DEMO are:
clarity of organizational goals —a concern with clearly deﬁning the goals of the organization (e.g.,
Locke, 1991);
effort —how hard people in organizations work towards achieving goals (e.g., McCaol, Hinsz, &
McCaol, 1987);
efﬁciency —the degree of importance placed DEMO employee efﬁciency and productivity at work (e.g.,
Ostroff & Schmitt, 1993);
quality—the emphasis given to quality procedures (e.g., Deming, DEMO; Hackman & Wageman, 1995);
pressure to produce —the extent DEMO pressure for employees to meet targets (e.g., Taira, 1996);
performance feedback —the measurement and feedback of job performance (e.g., Annett, 1969;
Kopelmann, 1986).

Organizational Context
VALIDATING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE MEASURE
387
The Companies
The companies DEMO spread throughout the United Kingdom, and were drawn from the manufacture DEMO
metal goods and mechanical engineering sector, plastics and rubber sector, and a third miscellaneous
category. They were predominantly single site and averaged approximately DEMO employees. The climate
data were collected between 1994 and 1996. At this time the companies were facing testing trading con-
ditions, with a greater than usual probability of bankruptcy and an increased threat to jobs. In DEMO
many ﬁrms set about trying to improve productivity through introducing new management practices,
reorganizing production methods and so on. Almost all the ﬁrms DEMO our sample reported undergoing
signiﬁcant change in structure, human resource management DEMO, and work design. In short, the
study took place at a time of considerable uncertainty and change for manufacturing organizations.
Employees’ Climate Perceptions
DEMO organizational climate surveys across the companies reinforced the researchers’ views that
organizational changes were implemented with limited effectiveness. Employees reported low
levels of participation, lack of open communication, and little decentralization. Pressure on employ-
ees to produce and formalization (the use of rules and formal procedures to control activities) domi-
nated employees’ climate perceptions of their organizations.
Method
Pilot study and development of the main item pool
Approximately 10 items per scale DEMO generated to tap into each of 19 proposed dimensions of cli-
mate. We used broad and comprehensive sets of items to tap the organizational DEMO dimensions.
Subsequently, each item set was reduced and items modiﬁed during DEMO piloting. Weaker items (i.e.,
those that respondents found ambiguous or DEMO), and the more important items (those which
loaded highly on DEMO constructs) were returned identiﬁed. Scale items were also selected on the DEMO
of item differentiation and measurement width within scales by examining both inter-item correlations
and semantic context. After all these processes, 95 items remained. Items from across all the scales
were randomly arranged, in order that effects due to response set were minimized. The response format
used was a DEMO Likert scale of deﬁnitely false, mostly false, mostly true, and DEMO true.
Because the questionnaire was designed for use within all levels of the workforce, care was taken to
use straightforward wording. The ﬁrst page contained instructions explaining the purpose and format
of the questionnaire, and informed respondents that it would take about 25 minutes to complete. They
were DEMO to answer all questions, as far as possible.
Administering the questionnaire

with an average of 256 employees. DEMO 12 051 questionnaires were distributed and in 49 organizations
all employees were asked to complete the OCM. In the six organizations with more than DEMO employ-
ees, a random sample of 60 per cent of the DEMO was selected to complete the questionnaire.
Two methods were used to administer the questionnaire. In 37 companies a postal survey was car-
ried out. DEMO, climate questionnaires were sent out to employees at their place of DEMO in personally
addressed envelopes which also contained a pre-paid return envelope. Seventeen companies chose to
have the climate survey administered by researchers on site.
DEMO
Overall, completed questionnaires were received from 6869 employees, constituting a 57.0 per cent
response rate across the sample. There was no evidence that DEMO rates varied by organizational
size or sector.
There were three stages in the analysis. First, using the data provided by 50 per cent of the respon-
dents, we employed conﬁrmatory factor analysis to examine how closely the data derived from
employees’ responses to the 95 items were consistent DEMO a 19-latent factor model of organizational
climate. Based on these ﬁndings, DEMO model was reﬁned to improve the ﬁt between the model and the
data in terms of internal consistency of scale items and discrimination between DEMO constructs. The
adequacy of the reﬁned model was then formally assessed (DEMO) using the remaining
50 per cent of the sample, again employing conﬁrmatory analysis.
The ﬁnal part of the analysis centered on demonstrating the DEMO and adequacy of our climate
measures, in terms of consensual, discriminant, and external (concurrent, predictive) validity and mea-
surement invariance (i.e., does the instrument measure the same constructs across different samples?).
DEMO common problem with data collected from lengthy questionnaires is missing data. Within our
6869 returned questionnaires we found that, on average, 8 per DEMO of questions were left unanswered
by each respondent. A list-wise deletion of cases would result in the loss of around 80 per cent of DEMO
sample. Far more efﬁcient methods are now available to researchers, including DEMO of full information
maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) (Arbuckle, 1996), which uses all available data to produce
estimates, and the expectation–maximization (DEMO) algorithm, which uses the information contained
in cases with and without missing data to compute a maximum likelihood covariance matrix and so
makes DEMO efﬁcient use of the available data than standard missing data techniques. Graham, Hofer,
and MacKinnon (1996) demonstrated that parameter estimates based on the analysis of the EM covar-
iance matrix are excellent in that DEMO are unbiased and efﬁcient. We made use of both these procedures
during the analysis.
Throughout the analysis we made the assumption that all missing DEMO points may be regarded as
missing at random, since the percentage DEMO for each question varied from only 1 per cent to
2.5 per cent (i.e., there appeared to be no ‘favored’ or ‘unfavored’ items)DEMO These ﬁgures suggested that
piloting had been successful in eliminating ‘unfriendly’ or ‘difﬁcult’ questions and that missing
responses could be regarded as reasonably random DEMO occurrence throughout the sample.
One further assumption was also made throughout the analysis. The covariances observed between
item responses were assumed to be reasonably DEMO across different categories of job type,
age, sex, department, DEMO In other words, the covariations (and therefore factor structure) among
DEMO for persons who are (say) management staff and those who are non-management staff were
considered to be reasonably similar. A more detailed discussion DEMO this assumption is given in the

Model exploration and reﬁnement
VALIDATING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE MEASURE
389
A common DEMO technique used for scale development is to split the data at random into two
subsamples, and then to use the ﬁrst subsample for exploratory analysis of the factor structure and
the second subsample to conﬁrm this DEMO We broadly followed this approach, although rather
than using exploratory factor DEMO (EFA) followed by conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA), we used
DEMO on both parts of the data. This was due to the problems of missing data mentioned above: while
full information maximum likelihood estimation (DEMO) is an appropriate technique for dealing with
missing data for CFA, no such equivalent technique is available for EFA.
Since we hypothesized the DEMO of the 19 different climate constructs a priori, and intentionally
wrote DEMO to tap into each of these domains, we started by assessing DEMO well a 19-factor structural
equation model described the covariation between items. For this, data provided by the ﬁrst 50 per cent of
the sample were used. Each of the sets of ﬁve items was speciﬁed to DEMO onto a single factor only, repre-
senting the underlying construct in DEMO Correlation among the latent factors was permitted, based on
the assumption DEMO the 19 constructs reﬂect both opposing/similar domains within the two-dimensional
Competing Values framework (internal versus external focus, and control versus ﬂexible orientation)DEMO
The covariance matrix was computed using EM (expectation maximization) by Schafer’s (1997)
NORM program. The EM covariance matrix was then entered into the AMOS structural equation mod-
eling program (Arbuckle, 1996) for ﬁtting of the 19-factor conﬁrmatory factor analysis model.
Detailed results of this analysis DEMO not repeated here, but are available on request from the authors.
DEMO of factor structure
There were very strong correlations between the latent factors labeled Innovation and Flexibility (0.94)
and between Participation and Communication (DEMO). This indicated that the shared variance in items
designed to measure Innovation corresponded almost precisely to the shared variation in items
designed to DEMO Flexibility. The same applied to items representing Participation and Communica-
tion. An examination of item correlations showed that Innovation items correlated just as highly DEMO
Flexibility items as they did with items within their own subscale (DEMO this was also true for the items
representing Participation and Communication).
In view of the fact that we wanted subscales to measure reasonably DEMO dimensions of climate,
the ﬁrst modiﬁcation to the model was therefore to allow the two subsets of Innovation and Flexibility
items to load DEMO a new single factor which we called Innovation & Flexibility. Similarly, DEMO ori-
ginally designed to tap aspects of Participation and Communication were allowed to load onto a single
construct, provisionally labeled Involvement. When the revised model was reﬁtted to the ﬁrst
50 per cent sample of data, there were no correlations over 0.80.
Scale reﬁnement
The process of subscale DEMO was based on several criteria. We examined regression weights for
small loadings in order to identify items that had insufﬁcient covariation with other items DEMO a subscale.
Unidimensionality and internal consistency were also assessed by calculation of reliability coefﬁcients
(Cronbach’s alpha) and inter-item correlations. We also removed those DEMO loading highly on other
factors. This was assessed by examination of modiﬁcation indices.
In the new 17-factor model, all but one of the regression weights of the latent variables on their
respective items were highly signiﬁcant. DEMO one item was removed. Also, modiﬁcation indices

M. G. PATTERSON ET AL.
suggested that two items loaded highly DEMO several other factors. Reliability analysis showed that there
would be no change in the value of Cronbach’s alpha if the items were removed, and inspection of the
remaining items in the scales showed that measurement width DEMO be unaffected. Therefore these
items were also removed. We also reduced the number of items in some scales on the basis of
low reliability/DEMO weights and overlap into other domains of climate. Where two scales had
been combined (Participation and Communication, Flexibility and Innovation), the new DEMO
scales were reduced to six items, in order that the number DEMO items for each should not be too over-
representative, but allowing DEMO scale to retain its breadth of content. In total, 13 of DEMO 95 items were
removed.
Assessment of proposed dimension structure and scale measures
To assess the adequacy of our reﬁned subscales and factor structure, a conﬁrmatory factor analysis of
the proposed model was performed on the remaining DEMO per cent of the data. To overcome the problem
of not getting ﬁt indices with FIML, a commonly used (but undocumented) approach to assessing
goodness of ﬁt in missing data situations was used (J. Graham, personal communication, 1998).
The ﬁrst step involves assessing the overall DEMO of ﬁt of the speciﬁed model and the second step
requires estimating parameters and obtaining accurate standard errors for more exact critical ratio
tests. DEMO computed EM estimates of item covariances on the same remaining approximately
50 per cent of the dataset using the same technique described earlier and DEMO the proposed model
to the estimated covariance matrix. The ﬁt indices produced are based on the assumption that there
are no missing data in DEMO N¼ 3428 cases and therefore are too conservative. The correct value of
N to be used in the calculation of ﬁt indices should be DEMO smaller than 3428 (nominal N)to
reﬂect the fact that many DEMO these cases did not contain answers to all items. A very crude approxima-
tion would be to use a value of N0 ¼ 3428 DEMO proportion of the data points actually observed. This value
of N0 should then give ﬁt indices that are much closer to the true values. DEMO fact, since the proportion of
missing data points in our sample DEMO relatively small, the sample sizes N and N0 were very similar DEMO
gave the same values (to within 0.003) for the ﬁt indices of interest. In light of the above, we can rea-
sonably claim the true values of the indices should be very similar to those DEMO by using EM.
Internal homogeneity
Internal consistency estimates (using Cronbach’s alpha) of the ﬁnal 17 scales are presented in Table 1.
With the DEMO of the Autonomy scale, all alpha values are at or above DEMO Also shown are the
means, standard deviations, and correlations for each scale. The items comprising each scale can be
found in the Appendix, along with which scales map onto each of the four quadrants of DEMO Competing
Values model.
The standardized estimates of regression weights produced by FIML can also be found in the
Appendix. All critical ratios were signiﬁcant, indicating that the latent factors explained signiﬁcant
proportions of variance in the DEMO items.

inappropriate for model assessment (although quoted here for completeness). Instead we used the
Bentler–Bonnett normal ﬁt index (NFI), the non-normal ﬁt index (NNFI) and the comparative ﬁt index
(CFI), all of which are thought to reﬂect ﬁt relatively well regardless of DEMO sample size. In addition we
also examined the RMSR (root mean DEMO [standardized] residual), which represents the average
absolute value by which the observed sample variances and covariances differ from those predicted
by the model.
DEMO value of RMSR below 0.05 is regarded as evidence that the model predicts the observed covar-
iances among items very well. Our results therefore DEMO that the proposed model provides an ade-
quate explanation of the relationships in the data. Values of NFI, NNFI, and CFI above 0.9 DEMO usually
considered indicative of a good ﬁt. Our statistics fall short of this recognized level. However, it is widely
accepted that achieving high levels of ﬁt with large numbers of items is difﬁcult or even impossible (e.g.,
Floyd & Widaman, 1995). In our case, limitations DEMO the overall level of ﬁt are due not only to the large
number of items but also to the speciﬁcation of the factor model. DEMO though questions were worded
and subsequently selected to be unidimensional, facets DEMO climate are non-independent by nature, so
success in conﬁrming factor structure DEMO always be limited by restricting items to load on just one
factor (when there are 16 possible others). Moreover, the items were DEMO arranged in the ques-
tionnaire, which may have contributed to more DEMO overlap. One ﬁnal, but important, point relates
to this observation. Researchers are unlikely to wish to use the whole OCM in a single DEMO, especially
where their use of the measure is focused by the DEMO use of theory. They will be more likely to
focus on the use of scales from one quadrant of the Competing Values model. For DEMO, researchers
examining innovation are more likely to focus on scales from DEMO Open Systems quadrant, whereas
those interested in people management issues may DEMO only on scales in the Human Relations quad-
rant. Where the focus is thus deﬁned, the ﬁt of items to subscales within quadrants is more convincing.
Climate scales which are likely to map onto the Competing DEMO quadrants are:
 Human Relations —comprising, Involvement, Autonomy, Supervisory DEMO, Integration, Wel-
fare, Training, and Effort;
 Internal Process —Formalization and Tradition;
 Open Systems —Reﬂexivity, Innovation & Flexibility, DEMO Outward Focus;
 Rational Goal —Clarity of Organizational Goals, Pressure DEMO Produce, Quality, Performance Feed-
back, and Efﬁciency.
Conﬁrmatory factor analyses DEMO each of these four proposed models on the second 50 per cent of
cases yielded the sets of ﬁt indices shown in Table 3.
DEMO do not predict or expect there necessarily to be a high level of intercorrelation between scales
within quadrants, thus producing a second-order factor structure mapped on to the four quadrants.
When we incorporated all scales into DEMO CFA and tested for four underlying constructs, there was

no neat second-order factor structure mapping onto the four quadrants. The DEMO describe the orga-
nizational terrain; the model does not propose that DEMO will have a set of practices that map on
to all or most of these climate dimensions within one domain. In some organizations, a human relations
orientation will be evidenced by supervisory support and an emphasis DEMO employee welfare. In other
organizations, a human relations orientation will be DEMO by an emphasis on employee involve-
ment and autonomy. The one represents a ‘patriarchal’ approach to human relations; the other a more
participative, DEMO approach. There is no reason why we would necessarily expect them to be
consistent. The same applies to the relationships between dimensions within the DEMO three domains.
Generalizability
Throughout the analysis we have assumed that the same factor structure holds for each of several popu-
lations (e.g., management/DEMO, shop ﬂoor/non-shop ﬂoor) and that all parameter values
(i.e., correlations and regression weights) are roughly equal to those estimated across these subsam-
ples. Since we intend the scales to be used at various DEMO within organizations, this assumption was
tested for management/non-management and shop DEMO/non-shop ﬂoor. The results gave almost iden-
tical ﬁt indices for the 17-factor model across all job types (these are shown in Table 4). There was no
reason from these analyses to doubt that parameter DEMO, or factor structures, would be any dif-
ferent between the two subsamples.
Consensual and discriminant validity
The scales have high face validity, because items were selected speciﬁcally to represent the constructs
of interest, and because the analyses presented suggest factorially distinct scales relating to these

constructs. The instrument should also demonstrate DEMO differences in employee perceptions
across organizations if it is to be useful in discriminating between organizations. It should also produce
data indicating reasonable consensus DEMO employees within organizations. To determine the dis-
criminant validity of the OCM, analyses of variance were performed using all the scales, with organiza-
DEMO as the independent variables. There were signiﬁcant between-organization differences on all
scales. F-values ranged from 5.21 (d.f. ¼ 53) for Integration to 27.25 (d.f. ¼ 53) for Pressure to Produce.
In order to assess the inter-rater reliability for each scale, the results of the one-way analysis of var-
iance were converted to intra-class correlations (ICC) (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979) with the two versions
commonly known as ICC(1) and ICC(2) (Bliese, 2000). These coefﬁcients assess the ratio of variation
within organizations to variation among organizations. Thus, high coefﬁcients are related to small
within-organization variance. Whereas ICC(1) assesses the reliability of a single rating (i.e., the relia-
bility of one respondent’s answers), DEMO(2) assesses the reliability of a mean rating (or an aggregated
score). The ICC(1) values for the dimensions in this study are between 0.04 and 0.22, with an average
of 0.16, and DEMO within the range reported by previous studies.
Within the literature there are few guidelines for appropriate values of ICC(1). However, a review by
James (1982) found values ranging from 0 to 0.50, with 0.12 as the median, and Bliese (2000) wrote
that, in DEMO experience, values typically range between 0.05 and 0.20. Also he reported DEMO he had
never encountered values higher than 0.30 and would be surprised to ﬁnd values greater than this in
most applied ﬁeld research. Compared DEMO these, the values in this study appear reasonable. Bliese
also suggests DEMO values of ICC(2) above 0.70 should be considered acceptable—all the DEMO here
are above 0.75, with all but two at least 0.89, demonstrating excellent inter-rater reliability in these
scales. The scales demonstrating highest coefﬁcients DEMO Pressure to Produce, Quality, and Efﬁciency,
and those with lowest coefﬁcients are Integration and Reﬂexivity, with p < 0.001 for all scales. These
are shown in Table 5.
As critics have argued that the DEMO coefﬁcient is a measure of consistency and not agreement
(Shrout & DEMO, 1979; James, 1982) a further agreement index was utilized. The within-group
agreement index of multiple item scales developed by James, Demaree, DEMO Wolf (1984, 1993) is a

technique for assessing agreement among the DEMO made on a single variable in regard to a single
target. It is therefore an appropriate measure to use when testing climate perceptions within DEMO orga-
nizational unit. Agreement ranged from 0.69 to 0.85. Scales which yielded high indices included Out-
ward Focus, Reﬂexivity, Effort, Quality, and DEMO, and the scale which produced the lowest index
was Training (a mean index of 0.69). A value of 0.7 or above has DEMO suggested as the cut-off point to
indicate within-group inter-rater agreement (James, 1982). This is consistent with the values suggested
by Nunnally (1978) for acceptable internal consistency reliability estimates in this type of research.
Organizational climate agreement indices produced a median of 0.87 in a study by DEMO (1993). All
agreement indices suggested a sufﬁcient level of agreement DEMO raters within organizations,
except for training, and this was very DEMO to the recommended level. Full results can be seen in
Table 5.
Concurrent validity
The development of the OCM was undertaken as part of DEMO wider longitudinal study examining relation-
ships between management practices, organizational climate, employee attitudes, and company eco-
nomic performance (West, Patterson, Pillinger, & Nickell, 1998). As indicated above, in addition to
conducting DEMO surveys, researchers spent a minimum of one day in each company DEMO
semi-structured interviews with senior management about a range of company practices such as com-
petitive strategies, organizational structure, quality practices, and human resource management issues.
The interviews were conducted with the person primarily responsible for DEMO practice in question (e.g.,
the chief executive for competitive strategy, the HRM director for training). Evidence from each inter-
viewee was DEMO with additional information from company documents and a tour of the
manufacturing facility.
The interviewers’ ratings (which were made before the climate surveys were carried out) provided
rich data for determining the concurrent validity of the climate dimensions. As the data were not col-
lected from the respondents DEMO completed the climate questionnaires, the correlations were not
inﬂated by common DEMO variance. The following section describes the correlations between the
climate scales and aspects of the interview data relating to associated areas of organizational function-
DEMO All correlations are shown in Table 6.
Human Relations quadrant
Strong support for the concurrent validity of the Training scale was provided by a DEMO associa-
tion with interviewer ratings of the sophistication of company training practices (r ¼ 0.52, p < 0.01).
Also, the Autonomy dimension was signiﬁcantly correlated with the level of responsibility inherent in
people’s jobs, as rated by interviewers (r ¼ 0.46, p < 0.01). DEMO Integration scale was positively cor-
related with the use of problem solving and cross-functional teams (r ¼ 0.54, p < 0.01) and inter-
viewers’ ratings of the extent to which a total quality culture had DEMO implemented (r ¼ 0.40,
p < 0.01). Both of DEMO practices can help break down functional barriers.
Involvement was positively related to interviewers’ ratings of the coherence and coverage of the
appraisal system (r ¼ 0.34, p < 0.05). Such a relationship would be expected, since appraisal offers
a formal opportunity for discussion between management and staff of objectives, strategies, and pro-
cesses in the individual’s work. Similarly, company scores on the Welfare scale were related to inter-
viewers’ ratings DEMO the extent of harmonized terms and conditions (r ¼ 0.34, p < 0.05) and the level of
beneﬁts offered to employees (r DEMO 0.55, p < 0.01).

VALIDATING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE MEASURE
397
The Formalization scale, assessing the degree to which employees perceive the company as relying on
DEMO rules and procedures, was negatively associated with interviewers’ ratings of employee DEMO
sibility (r ¼0.34, p < 0.05). The Tradition scale was negatively related to adoption of a number of
management practices associated with DEMO ‘new manufacturing paradigm’ (Dean & Snell, 1991);
sophisticated training DEMO (r ¼0.42, p < 0.01); use of appraisals (r DEMO, p < 0.05); a total
quality culture (r ¼0.36, DEMO < 0.05), use of cross-functional teams (r ¼0.45, p < 0.01), and frequent
and comprehensive communication to the workforce (r ¼0.51, p < 0.01).
Open Systems quadrant
In older companies systems and patterns of behavior tend to become institutionalized, acting as a
source of organizational inertia. This inertia sets limitations on the ability of organizations to DEMO
(Hannan & Freeman, 1977). Therefore the negative relationship between company age and the Inno-
vation & Flexibility scale provided some validation for DEMO scale (r ¼0.34, p < 0.05). The Outward
Focus dimension correlated positively with managers’ rated effectiveness of their company’s market
research activities (r ¼ 0.46, p < 0.01).
Rational Goal quadrant
The goal clarity and the feedback scales showed associations with closely related management prac-
DEMO The Clarity of Organizational Goals scale was positively related to interviewers’ ratings of the
frequency and comprehensiveness of communication to the workforce (r ¼ 0.61, p < 0.01), and Per-
formance Feedback was associated with the coherence and coverage of the appraisal system (r 0.48,
p < 0.01), and effective communication (r ¼0.58, p < 0.01)DEMO
¼
The Quality dimension was not signiﬁcantly associated with interviewers’ ratings of the effective-
ness of company quality procedures. With this notable exception, overall, the associations between the
climate dimensions and closely related management practices assessed by interviews with senior man-
agement indicate good concurrent validity.
Predictive validity
DEMO one year after the collection of climate data, the managing director DEMO head of produc-
tion operations of each company completed a survey relating to organizational innovation in the areas
of products, production technology, and DEMO organization. Researchers rated responses on a 5-point
scale, from 1 ‘not DEMO all innovative’ to 5 ‘very innovative.’ These ratings were based on the extent of
innovation in relation to new products, adaptations of existing products, effects on production pro-
cesses, and numbers of staff affected by DEMO innovations. Questionnaires were rated by three research-
ers to check the reliability of the ratings. We examined whether the Innovation & Flexibility and
Reﬂexivity DEMO scores provided by employees were associated with researcher ratings of organiza-
tional innovation one year later. The Innovation & Flexibility and Reﬂexivity scales were DEMO
associated with researchers’ ratings of innovativeness in products (r ¼ 0.53, p < 0.01; r ¼ 0.41,
p < 0.01 respectively), technology (r ¼ 0.44, p < 0.01; r ¼ 0.31, DEMO < 0.01), and work organization
(r ¼ 0.36, p < 0.01; r ¼ 0.39, p < 0.01).

We were also able to investigate DEMO predictive validity of the measure of organizational climate in
relation to organizational productivity. Productivity data (logarithm of ﬁnancial value of net sale per
employee) for 42 companies from our sample were collected from company accounts lodged in Com-
panies House (the central repository for the compulsory submission of annual accounts made by every
limited company in the UK). Subsequent DEMO (collected one year after the climate survey) was
signiﬁcantly correlated in controlled analyses with eight aspects of organizational climate (training,
welfare, DEMO support, effort, innovation and ﬂexibility, quality, performance feedback, and DEMO
malization). For a detailed report of these ﬁndings see Patterson et al. (2004).
Discussion
The OCM was developed and tested with a large sample of employees drawn from 55 manufacturing
organizations. The results revealed DEMO the instrument has sound psychometric properties and provides
researchers with a robust means for assessing 17 dimensions of employee perceptions of their work
environments. DEMO, the internal reliability of the scales was acceptable in almost all DEMO and
good in many.
Uniquely, we were able to assess the DEMO and predictive validity of many of the scales draw-
ing on intensive interviews conducted with managers in the 55 organizations; upon interviewer ratings
of dimensions of company functioning such as innovative orientation, sophistication and extent of
human resource management practices, richness and responsibility of front line jobs; DEMO on produc-
tivity and innovation data.
The measure also discriminated effectively between organizations, demonstrating good discrimi-
nant validity. Agreement between raters (employees) within organizations was high, showing that
the measure satisﬁed the conditions for aggregation of perceptions of employees. The fact that the
measure does effectively discriminate DEMO organizations is important, since it suggests that varia-
tions in climate DEMO reliably be reﬂected in the data gathered using this instrument. Studies of organi-
zational-level factors and relationships with climate can therefore be embarked upon DEMO a high
degree of conﬁdence, especially where researchers have identiﬁed, a priori, organizations which are
likely to differ in characteristics under study, DEMO which can be related to climate (e.g., economic per-
formance, DEMO, employee commitment).
We did not predict nor ﬁnd a second-order DEMO structure mapping on to the four quadrants of the
Competing Values model. The Competing Values model proposes that organizations span all four
quadrants, having a greater or lesser degree of emphasis across all four, rather than ﬁtting into one
or other. The model speciﬁcally rejects a typological approach, arguing that understanding of organi-
zations should be based on the relative DEMO they give to each of the competing values. Forcing
them into one or other quadrant would misrepresent their inherent span of activity and experience DEMO
of those who work within them. Employees experience control, ﬂexibility, and internal and external
focus in their organizations. It is the degree of DEMO and associated types of managerial practices
(effectively the application of managerial DEMO) that is of interest to climate researchers.
Similarly, we would not expect that organizations would have a high degree of emphasis on every DEMO
even most dimensions of climate within a quadrant. For two organizations with strong human relations
orientations we might ﬁnd that one emphasizes supervisory support DEMO not autonomy, while another
might emphasize training but not involvement. The DEMO Values model provides a topography of
organizational climate—it does not propose that organizations characterized by a strong human rela-
tions orientation will have high DEMO on every or most dimensions within that quadrant.

VALIDATING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE MEASURE
399
The OCM was developed from a DEMO base, the Competing Values model, itself reﬂecting con-
siderable prior theoretical development. By basing the measure on underlying conceptual bases in the
organizational DEMO, we aimed to provide a measure which would be useful for DEMO broad range of
research interests, enabling researchers to test central theoretical DEMO about relationships, such
as those between climate and organizational effectiveness. The DEMO consequently offers a number
of unique advantages.
First it is relatively comprehensive, offering researchers the advantage of being able to assess
employees’ experience over many fundamental dimensions of climate. It is unlikely that most
researchers will DEMO to apply all 17 scales of the OCM in their research since the logistics of admin-
istering the questionnaires, and analyzing the resultant data sets, are likely to prove too cumbersome.
Moreover, it might suggest DEMO lack of theoretical focus. Indeed, the instrument can be used in DEMO more
reﬁned way by selecting scales most applicable to the research questions being posed. This might
require the use of only one or two DEMO, such as those tapping innovation orientation or traditionalism.
Alternatively, whole domains might be assessed by using all scales in one quadrant (e.g., DEMO seven
scales in the Human Relations domain). The wider applicability of the scales in this regard has been
demonstrated by our application of DEMO in a service setting, where we have demonstrated factorial
invariance, reliability, and validity of 12 of the scales in their use amongst 5000 employees in 27 hos-
pitals in the United Kingdom (Hill, West, Patterson, & Borrill, 1997).
The measure can be used to DEMO mergers and acquisitions since it will provide an indication of the
similarity or difference between organizational climates or value emphasis before and after merger
(are they similar in terms of emphases and in which quadrants of DEMO model?). Similarly, it can be
applied to studies of organizational change and speciﬁcally culture change to determine the effects
on employees’ experience DEMO change. It is possible, for example, to determine whether most change
occurs in scales in the open systems or internal process quadrants. Are DEMO intended consequences of
the change (a more human relations-oriented organization for DEMO) borne out by the results of the
application of the measure? The measure can also be used to assess differences between subcultures in
DEMO organizations. Moreover, researchers can examine organizational change processes generally to
determine DEMO over time—are most organizational changes focused on internal process, open sys-
DEMO, rational goal or human relations values?
The measure’s development also DEMO up possibilities for testing theory. Quinn proposed that
strong emphasis across all four domains (climate strength) would be associated with organizational
effectiveness and DEMO measure can be employed to test this prediction. Moreover, it enables DEMO
of other ideas about climate strength (where all or most climate DEMO within a quadrant inter-
correlate highly) as a predictor of organizational DEMO The alternative conception of strong cli-
mates (where organizational members agree DEMO their climate ratings) and how this relates to
organizational outcomes can DEMO be tested. Furthermore, because the measure is based on the four
DEMO domains, researchers can both develop and test theory about the relationship DEMO speciﬁc
climate dimensions in or across quadrants and a broad range of outcomes (e.g., turnover, productivity,
accidents, citizenship, and innovation).
The research also suggested some gaps in both the model and the DEMO The body of work on
organizational ethics (e.g., Trevino & Weaver, 1994; Victor & Cullen, 1988) and governance
(e.g.,Wood, DEMO) is not reﬂected in the Competing Values model. Values that emphasize DEMO apply
to all four quadrants. Speciﬁcally, we believe that the Competing DEMO model neglects dimensions
that are common to or span all four areas of values or emphases. Ethics is an issue in all areas. The
DEMO, we propose, should incorporate a central (Venn diagram-like) component that integrates com-
mon elements such as an emphasis on ethical practice and DEMO We see this as an area for future
theoretical and psychometric development. Finally, it is important that the measure is applied across
a variety of organizational types and in a variety of national contexts.

In conclusion, we hope researchers ﬁnd this measure useful in their research and that we are
able to DEMO easily accumulate understanding about the role of climate in organizational
functioning.
