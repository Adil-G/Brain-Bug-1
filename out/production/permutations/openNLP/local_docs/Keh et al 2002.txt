Even though the entrepreneurship literature places much emphasis DEMO opportunity recog-
nition, little is known about how entrepreneurs actually evaluate DEMO This study
uses a cognitive approach to examine opportunity evaluation, as DEMO perception of oppor-
tunity is essentially a cognitive phenomenon. We present a model that consists of four in-
dependent variables (overconﬁdence, belief in DEMO law of small numbers, planning fallacy,
and illusion of control), a mediating variable (risk perception), two control variables (demo-
graphics and risk propensity), and the dependent variable (opportunity evaluation). We ﬁnd
that illusion of control and belief in the law of small DEMO are related to how entrepre-
neurs evaluate opportunities. Our results also indicate that risk perception mediates oppor-
tunity evaluation.
INTRODUCTION
The entrepreneurial process involves DEMO the functions, activities, and actions asso-
ciated with the perception of opportunities and the creation of the organizations to pursue
these opportunities (Bygrave & Hofer, 1991). In order to understand what promotes or
inhibits entrepreneurial activity, it is important to understand how entrepreneurs construct
credible opportunities and the role of perceptions in that process (Krueger, 2000). DEMO
researchers (Kirzner, 1973; Kaish & Gilad, 1991; Douglas & DEMO, 1999) argue that
opportunity recognition is the cornerstone of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs often see
opportunities where others do not, and envision future possibilities that others fail to
recognize (Allinson, Chell, & Hayes, 2000).
DEMO opportunity is deﬁned as a future situation that the decisionmakers deem per-
sonally desirable and feasible (i.e., within their control and competence). DEMO state of
being “desirable” and “feasible” is subjective to the individual (DEMO, 1993). An
opportunity is said to exist when a bundle DEMO resources can be sold at a higher price than
the cost to package and deliver this bundle (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). Most DEMO
preneurs do not have problems generating ideas, as there are numerous DEMO of ideas

of what they can sell, and evaluation is the key to differentiate an idea from an oppor-
tunity (Hills & Shrader, 1998). DEMO such, it is important to understand how entrepreneurs
evaluate the alternatives DEMO to them. We term this process Opportunity Evaluation
(OE).
Deciding DEMO an idea is an opportunity involves judgments made under condi-
tions of uncertainty and complexity (Das & Teng, 1997; Allinson, Chell, & Hayes, 2000).
Closely associated with uncertainty is risk, which is DEMO probability that an entrepreneur
is able to successfully turn an idea into an opportunity. An entrepreneur who fails in the
business could incur ﬁnancial DEMO instead. As such, perceived risk is a signiﬁcant aspect
of how DEMO evaluate available ideas. Entrepreneurs are more likely to evaluate
an idea more favorably when they perceive less risk in that idea.
What is less DEMO, however, are the antecedents of risk perception of entrepreneurs.
While others have shown that people’s cognitive biases affect their decision to start a
DEMO venture (e.g., Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 2000), it DEMO not certain whether entre-
preneurs exhibit the same cognitive biases. Kirzner (DEMO) argues that entrepreneurs are
entrepreneurially alert and able to discern opportunities DEMO others are not. Although
this assertion has been challenged (e.g., Gaglio, 1997), researchers have found that the
cognitive processes of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs are different. For instance,
entrepreneurs focus on the future and DEMO in less counterfactual thinking than nonen-
trepreneurs (Baron, 1999).
In this article, we study how various cognitive processes affect opportunity evalua-
tion, mediated by risk perception, as opportunity evaluation is essentially a cognitive
DEMO (Palich & Bagby, 1995; Krueger, 2000). Such a cognitive approach can
help explain why some people start business ventures while others DEMO not (Venkatara-
man, 1997; Baron, 1998; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). While some of the variables we
included are similar to DEMO, Houghton, and Aquino (2000), the sample of MBA stu-
DEMO that they used may not be representative of actions taken by entrepreneurs. Further,
the development of scientiﬁc knowledge requires testing propositions in different
DEMO, so that they could either be refuted or be further supported (Popper, 1972,
pp. 240–242).
The ﬂow of our study is as follows. First, the theoretical background and research
framework are presented. This is followed by the development of testable hypotheses.
We then describe the DEMO methodology and conduct the empirical analysis. Finally,
the ﬁndings, implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.
LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH FRAMEWORK
DEMO and cognition are two major approaches to distinguish entrepreneurs from
nonentrepreneurs and to understand how people make decisions (Das & Teng, 1997). DEMO
trait approach asserts that entrepreneurs can be recognized by traits such as risk propen-
sity, need for achievement, and locus of control (Palich & Bagby, 1995). The cognitive
approach is concerned with the entrepreneur’s preferred way of gathering, processing,
and evaluating information (Allinson, Chell, & Hayes, 2000). The individual constructs
opportunities and risk in DEMO or her mind (Palich & Bagby, 1995). Therefore, perception
DEMO other cognitive phenomena are critical to opportunity evaluation and risk perception
(DEMO, 2000).
However, research using the trait approach has had limited success in explaining
entrepreneurial behaviors and perceptions. For instance, some studies have shown that
126
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
risk propensity, the personality trait that determines the tendency and willingness of the
individual to take risk, does not explain why entrepreneurs are willing to undertake a
business venture (e.g., Low & MacMillan, 1988). Subsequently researchers have turned
to the cognitive approach, and recent evidence suggests that this approach better explains
entrepreneurial behavior and perception. For example, researchers have shown that entre-
preneurs exhibit systematic cognitive biases and overestimate their DEMO of success.
Cooper, Woo, and Dunkelberg (1988) ﬁnd that 81 percent of entrepreneurs believe that
their ventures will have at least a DEMO percent chance of succeeding even though 50 percent
to 71 percent of all new ventures discontinue after ﬁve years.
We are interested in understanding DEMO cognitive factors inﬂuence opportunity
evaluation mediated by risk perception. The quality of decision making, in the risk-
charged environments that entrepreneurs often face, DEMO be improved with a better
understanding of risk and its role in opportunity evaluation (Forlani & Mullins, 2000).
While it is obvious DEMO individuals are more likely to make risky decisions when they
perceive less risk, little is known about the antecedents of risk perception (Sitkin &
Weingart, 1995). Although there are many possible cognitive factors, DEMO, Houghton,
and Aquino (2000) argue that the biases of DEMO, illusion of control and belief
in the law of small numbers DEMO inﬂuence risk perception and the decision to start a
business venture. We include these three cognitive biases in an attempt to replicate their
ﬁndings.
DEMO Framework (Opportunity Evaluation Model)
Consistent with previous studies (e.g., DEMO & Pablo, 1992; Sitkin & Weingart,
1995; Forlani & DEMO, 2000), risk perception is taken to drive entrepreneurial activ-
ities. DEMO, among other outcomes, allow entrepreneurs to receive proﬁts (Shane
& DEMO, 2000). However, there are risks involved in acting on an idea. Not every
idea is an opportunity, as entrepreneurs must cover the costs of gathering and delivering
a bundle of goods and services (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) and business overheads.
Entrepreneurs who believe that they DEMO able to predict how well the business will do,
and perceive a low probability of failure will view the idea to be an DEMO that is
feasible and worth considering. As such,
H1: Perceiving DEMO lower level of risk is associated with more positive opportunity
evaluation.
However, the factors that inﬂuence risk perception are less obvious. In this study,
we examine how different cognitive processes affect risk perception that in DEMO
affects the evaluation of whether a venture idea is feasible or viable. In particular, we
explore how cognitive biases inﬂuence decision making under risky conditions (Laibson
& Zeckhauser, 1998). Individuals do not have the DEMO capacity to process and
remember all information stimuli that arise from complex situations. Entrepreneurs
often ﬁnd themselves in situations that are new and unpredictable. DEMO are less likely
to have access to historical trends, past performance, and other information to reduce
the level of uncertainty at a relatively DEMO cost (Busenitz & Barney, 1997). In addition,
more comprehensive decision making is not possible because entrepreneurs need to act
quickly to DEMO brief windows of opportunity (Busenitz & Lau, 1996). Therefore,
entrepreneurs seek to minimize cognitive effort by using heuristics (mental shortcuts)
and simplifying strategies that lead to a number of cognitive biases. These DEMO in-

Figure 1 represents the model that we study in this article. Four factors are hypoth-
esized to affect risk perception; risk perception in turn affects opportunity evaluation.
Three of the biases (i.e., overconﬁdence, belief in the law of small numbers, and illusion
of control) DEMO adapted from Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000). Planning fallacy (i.e.,
individuals do not consider past experiences in similar situations because DEMO
induce a future orientation) is included as the experience gained by DEMO entrepreneurs is
likely to affect their cognitive processes. Repeated successes and failures will reinforce
the entrepreneurs’ cognitive frameworks regarding risk of ventures (Baron, DEMO), which
we use as a mediating variable. Table 1 provides a summary of the relevant literature on
the four independent factors, the dependent variable (Opportunity Evaluation), and the
mediating variable (Risk Perception).
DEMO
Overconﬁdence refers to the failure to know the limits of one’s knowledge
(Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001), and this leads to overestimation of DEMO certainty regard-
ing facts. This bias is especially common in ill-structured decision situations, such as
deciding whether to introduce a new product (Simon & Houghton, in press). Overconﬁ-
dence can occur because individuals base DEMO certainty on the ease with which they
can recall reasons for conﬁdence (i.e., availability heuristics). They do not revise their
initial estimates DEMO receiving new data due to their initial overconﬁdence, and have
a DEMO to seek supporting evidence instead of disconﬁrming evidence (Russo &
Schoemaker, 1992).

Entrepreneurs exhibiting overconﬁdence tend to treat their assumptions as facts and
do DEMO see uncertainty associated with conclusions stemming from those assumptions
(Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 2000). Thus, they perceive less risk. Entrepreneurs may
also perceive less risk as they are more optimistic about those assumptions (Russo &
Schoemaker, 1992). The optimistic outlook results in less DEMO search (Zacharakis
& Shepherd, 2001). Thus, we posit that,DEMO
H2: Entrepreneurs exhibiting higher overconﬁdence will perceive less risk.
Belief in DEMO Law of Small Numbers
Belief in the law of small numbers refers to individuals using a limited number of
informational inputs (a small sample of information, such as attributes and observations)
to draw ﬁrm conclusions (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971). People ignore sample size in sit-
DEMO when it should play a role because of the representativeness heuristic (DEMO
& Kahneman, 1971), which leads people to believe that small DEMO are highly repre-
sentative of the populations from which they are drawn. Small, nonrandom samples are
not likely to be statistically valid and are not representative of the population as a whole.
Entrepreneurs do not use DEMO random samples because they are rarely available. In addi-
tion, entrepreneurs DEMO not have the resources to engage in systematic data collection
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997).
It is more likely for entrepreneurs to receive DEMO more positive infor-
mation because failures are less likely to be well-publicized (Simon, Houghton, and
Aquino, 2000). Furthermore, failures exist only for a short time and are therefore less
cognitively salient (Golder & Tellis, 1993). A stronger belief in the law of small numbers
coupled with mainly positive information is likely to induce an overly optimistic DEMO
of the venture (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993) and thus lower DEMO risk. This leads to
the following hypothesis:
H3: Entrepreneurs who DEMO a stronger belief in the law of small numbers will
perceive less risk.
Planning Fallacy
Decisionmakers may not consider past experiences in situations with DEMO cir-
cumstances because predictions, by their very nature, induce a future orientation. They
tend to treat the current situation or decision as unique, thus isolating it from past expe-
rience. This is known as the DEMO fallacy (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). This fallacy
tends to operate more strongly in situations that are unique, ﬁlled with uncertainties, and
DEMO there is a need for a focus on the future (Baron, 1998), such as the evaluation stage
of decision making. The planning DEMO is affected by a future time orientation (Mitchell
& James, 2001), and is particularly salient in Asian societies, where Confucian dynamism
reﬂects a short-term versus long-term orientation, along with other characteristics
(Hofstede & DEMO, 1988).
An opportunity in the intertemporal markets does not yet DEMO except in the mind of
the entrepreneur; the entrepreneur must forecast DEMO prices of goods and resources and
use intuitive judgment to gauge market potential (Kaish & Gilad, 1991). These forecasts
of future outcomes DEMO often anchored on plans and scenarios of success rather than on
past results, and may possibly be overly optimistic (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). This
130
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
indicates that entrepreneurs will perceive less risk if the planning fallacy inﬂuences DEMO
to a greater extent.
H4: Entrepreneurs who are inﬂuenced by planning DEMO to a greater extent will
perceive less risk.
Illusion of Control
Illusion of control is a bias in which an individual overemphasizes the extent DEMO which
his or her skills can increase performance in situations where chance plays a large part
and skill is not necessarily the deciding factor. DEMO example, people fail to respond dif-
ferentially to controllable and uncontrollable DEMO (Langer, 1975). There are two
reasons for this illusion of control (Langer, 1975). The ﬁrst reason is that people are DEMO
vated to control their environment and the feeling of competence will result from being
able to control the uncontrollable. The other reason is that DEMO and chance factors are
closely associated and it is often hard to discriminate between chance and skill elements.
This is different from overconﬁdence as DEMO relates to an overestimation of
one’s certainty regarding their metaknowledge (Russo & Schoemaker, 1992), instead of
their skills or abilities to cope DEMO and predict future events.
It has often been suggested that entrepreneurs show an unusually strong preference
for exerting control over their outcomes because they DEMO they can exert control over
people and events (Shaver & Scott, 1991). Therefore, individuals exhibiting an illusion
of control will underestimate risk because they believe their skills can prevent negative
occurrences. Thus,
H5: Entrepreneurs with a stronger illusion of control bias will perceive less risk.
DEMO METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN
We ﬁrst describe the sampling procedure and explain the rationale behind sample
selection. Then we operationalize the constructs for empirical testing. DEMO measures
are used in the questionnaire sent to the respondents.
Sampling
In this study, owners of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were identiﬁed.
Das and Teng (1997) distinguished craftsman entrepreneurs from opportunistic entrepre-
neurs. DEMO entrepreneurs are people who seek self-employment through starting a
business, e.g., a corner store. These entrepreneurs usually have no desire to grow the DEMO
ness. Opportunistic entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are growth-oriented and continu-
ously pursue opportunities. Since we were interested in entrepreneurs that wanted to
DEMO potential opportunities, we focused on opportunistic entrepreneurs.
A directory of the DEMO 500 SMEs in Singapore was used as the sample. The Singa-
pore SME 500 was the only independent performance ranking of Singapore’s top SMEs,DEMO
using audited ﬁnancials and other key ﬁnancial data. The founders of these companies
were likely to be opportunistic, as they had to constantly look for new opportunities for
their companies to be among the largest SMEs DEMO Singapore.
A survey was used to collect data from these companies. The questionnaires, admin-
istered in English, were mailed to the respondents and DEMO of the results was

but only 459 addresses were valid. The companies with invalid mailing addresses were
contacted by phone and fax to request DEMO participation. A total of 465 companies were
contacted through mail, fax, or phone in order to improve the response rate. A search of
DEMO business directories did not reveal whether the businesses with invalid contacts had
changed premises or had discontinued operations. A ﬁnal total of 77 completed DEMO
were returned, giving a 16.6 percent response rate. Table 2 presents DEMO summary sta-
tistics of the sample.
Also, given the relatively small DEMO size, we were concerned about nonresponse
error. We applied the strategies DEMO by Churchill (1995) to overcome this bias.
Firstly, we tried DEMO increase initial response rate by selling respondents on the value of
the research and the importance of their participation. We also followed up with DEMO
calls and faxes for the initial nonrespondents. However, we did not DEMO to adjust the
results, as it was not evident from our DEMO size that the means of the variables could
be meaningfully extended to the rest of the designated sample.
Examining the demographics of the entrepreneurs DEMO that 97.0 percent of
the respondents were male and 86.4 percent had postsecondary education and higher.
The proﬁle was consistent with the proﬁle of DEMO persons in Singapore
132
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
(Department of Statistics, 1997). We also wanted to know whether DEMO were differences
between founders of businesses and those who bought or inherited them. This was con-
ducted using t-tests. Since the variable “belief in DEMO numbers” had nearly half of the
observations missing, we only performed DEMO for the following variables: illusion of
control, planning fallacy, overconﬁdence, risk perception, and opportunity evaluation.
The results revealed that founders and purchasers did not exhibit signiﬁcant differences
on any of these ﬁve cognitive constructs.
DEMO of Constructs
A questionnaire (see Appendix) was constructed to measure each of the four inde-
pendent factors (overconﬁdence, belief in the law DEMO small numbers, planning fallacy, and
illusion of control), the dependent variable (opportunity evaluation), mediating variable
(risk perception), and control DEMO (demographics and risk propensity).
Risk Perception and Opportunity Evaluation. A DEMO case study (see Section D of the
Appendix) was developed for the respondents to evaluate. Cases can capture the com-
plexities of the DEMO of opportunities and have been used in several studies that
evaluated business venture decisions (e.g., Sitkin & Weingart, 1995, and Zacharakis &
Shepherd, 2001). The case method allows the context to be speciﬁed so that the respon-
dents are exposed to the same set of DEMO (Finch, 1987; Hughes, 1998). To make
the situations more concrete, we gave a name to the character, a practice recommended
DEMO other researchers1 (Finch, 1987). Although long cases both contain rich information
and are more typical to entrepreneurs, we kept the case to half a page long. This is because
entrepreneurs might not be willing DEMO take the time and effort to read and respond to a
longer case. Nevertheless, the length is typical of cases as part of a survey (e.g., Hughes,
1998). The case also allows us DEMO study the information that the respondents focus on.
Following Sitkin and Weingart (1995), there was no indication in the case of the indus-
try so that the respondents would not be inﬂuenced by the characteristics DEMO to
that industry.
Immediately following the case study, four items (Questions 1 to 4 of Section D)
were developed to measure perceived DEMO in the venture (a= .89). The four items cap-
tured DEMO probability of loss, level of uncertainty in the situation, size of possible loss,
and overall risk of the venture. The four questions DEMO summed to measure risk per-
ception and a pretest indicated that the scale was reliable with a= .79.
Three items (Questions 5–7 of Section D) were developed to capture whether the
entrepreneurs viewed this venture as an opportunity (a= .90). Speciﬁcally, they were
developed to capture DEMO perceived desirability and feasibility of the venture, and overall
opportunity. As DEMO earlier, an opportunity is a future state that is deemed desirable
DEMO feasible. The pretest showed that the scale was reliable with a= .75.
Belief in the Law of Small Numbers. To capture the respondents’ belief DEMO the law of
small numbers, they were asked to evaluate the DEMO and describe their reasons for con-
1. A reviewer pointed out that in the questionnaire, we should have an instruction asking the respondent to
put him/herself in Mr. Tan’s shoes. We agree with this suggestion. DEMO, the case is still valid because
respondents often enter into the DEMO of the case, and identify themselves with the dilemmas that the DEMO
acter faces (Finch, 1987). Further, the instructions in the DEMO speciﬁcally asked how much “you” (i.e., the
respondent) agree with DEMO statements. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

cluding whether they thought the venture was an opportunity (Question 8 of Section D).
They were required to give evidence that inﬂuenced their DEMO The explanations
were analyzed and coded independently using the procedures of Simon, Houghton, and
Aquino (2000) and Busenitz and Barney (1997). A code of 1 was given for responses
that contained no mention DEMO statistical reasoning, but relied on subjective opinions or
rules of thumb (e.g., opinions of a few associates or customers). A code of -1 was given
for responses that contained some form of statistical reasoning, including references to
the importance of market research, variability, or sample DEMO Other remaining responses
were assigned a value of zero. To form a continuous variable, the scores for all explana-
tions were summed to give a single value.
Overconﬁdence. We adopted the format used by Russo and DEMO (1992) and
Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000), but DEMO them to the Singapore context to
measure overconﬁdence. For each of the ten questions (Section C), there was only one
correct numerical answer. The subjects were asked to build a conﬁdence interval that
they were DEMO percent certain would capture the correct answer. If more than 10 percent
of the answers fell outside the range, the respondent was overconﬁdent. The quiz mea-
sured what Russo and Schoemaker (1992) called metaknowledge (i.e., an appreciation of
what an individual knew and what he or she did not know). The respondents were asked
about general and not DEMO knowledge because entrepreneurs draw upon a wide array
of information when evaluating new venture ideas (Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 2000).
Planning DEMO Two items (Questions 3–4 of Section B) were developed to capture
the use of entrepreneurial experience in assessing the risk of a new DEMO idea (a=
.73). The ﬁrst item identiﬁed whether the respondents DEMO that entrepreneurial expe-
rience would help in assessing the risk of the new venture. The second item measured
how likely the respondent would use DEMO experience in businesses of a different nature
to evaluate the new venture. The scores for both items were reversed and summed to
obtain a DEMO of planning fallacy. The pretest showed that the scale was moderately
reliable with a= .69.
Illusion of Control. This measure was also adapted from DEMO, Houghton, and Aquino
(2000). We measured the respondents’ illusion DEMO control using the three items (a= .80)
in Questions 5–7 DEMO Section B). The ﬁrst two items were used to measure the subjects’
perception of their own ability to predict certain uncontrollable outcomes. The DEMO item
was used to measure the perception of the subjects’ belief that their skills were better
than those of others, a belief that might not be related to a person’s objective skills
(Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1988). The items focused on business events, which entre-
DEMO often think that they can control or predict (Simon, Houghton, & Aquino,
2000).
Control Variables. Demographic information was collected in the questionnaire (Section
E). Due to the low variance in gender, DEMO, and education variables of the sample, only
age was included in the analysis. A measure of risk propensity (Section A) was collected
DEMO used as a control variable in the analysis. We chose the Risk Style Scale (Forlani &
Mullins, 2000) to operationalize risk propensity. DEMO measure dealt with personal propen-
sities toward ﬁnancial risk taking, as DEMO to other kinds of risks, and has shown its
efﬁcacy in DEMO the construct of interest. Ray (1994) suggests that entrepreneurs
do not have generalized risk-taking propensities, hence other research instruments that

risk situations actually encountered by entrepreneurs.
ANALYSIS
Three linear regression models were used to test the hypotheses of the opportunity
evaluation model. DEMO three models were needed to test the mediation effects of risk per-
ception on opportunity evaluation (Baron & Kenny, 1986), as shown DEMO Figure 1.
Model 1 regressed risk perception (mediating variable) on the independent variables
(overconﬁdence, belief in the law of small numbers, planning fallacy, and illusion of
control). In addition to testing the conditions needed to show mediation, results from
Model 1 were also used to test H2, H3, H4, and H5. Model 2 regressed opportunity eval-
uation (dependent variable) on the independent variables. Model 3 regressed opportunity
DEMO on both the independent variables and risk perception. The three models are
represented in mathematical form as follows:
Model 1: y a b x ... b x e=+ + + +
Model 2: y a b x ... b x e=+ + + +
Model 3: y a b x ... b x e=+ + + +
where ai DEMO intercept of Model i,
ei = error term of Model i, and
xij = independent variables in Model i, where j = DEMO to 4 refers to the independent
factors, j = 5 to DEMO refers to control variables, and j = 7 refers to the DEMO
ing factor.
To verify the mediation effect of risk perception, four DEMO had to be met (Baron
& Kenny, 1986):
1) the independent variables had to affect the mediator in Model 1,
DEMO) the independent variables had to affect the dependent variable in Model DEMO,
3) the mediator had to affect the dependent variable in DEMO 3, and
4) the effect of the independent variables in Model 3 had to be less than in Model 2.
That is, the inclusion of the mediator into the equation would reduce the effect of DEMO
independent variables on opportunity evaluation because part, if not all, of the effect was
indirect through the mediator. If the independent variable had DEMO signiﬁcant effect on the
dependent variable in Model 3, full mediation DEMO supported. Full mediation implies that
the independent variables affect the dependent variable only via the mediating variable.
If the effect of the independent variables DEMO signiﬁcant, only partial mediation is
supported. Partial mediation implies that the DEMO variables affect the dependent
variable directly, as well as indirectly, through the mediating variable.

tively, the independent variables explained a statistically signiﬁcant proportion of the
variance in risk perception at the .01 level (R2 = .30, Adjusted R2 = .20). Model 1 also
showed that illusion of control was signiﬁcantly related to risk perception (b=-.76,
p < .01), supporting H5. Model 1 did not support H2, H3, and H4.
Model 2 was statistically signiﬁcant at the .05 level (R2 = .31, Adj. R2 = .21). The
coefﬁcients for DEMO belief in the law of small numbers variable (b= 1.17, p < .06) and
illusion of control variable (b= .40, p < .05) were also statistically signiﬁcant. Model
3, which included risk perception DEMO the independent and control variables, explained
59 percent of the variance DEMO opportunity evaluation with adjusted R2 = .52. Risk per-
ception was negatively related to opportunity evaluation (b=-.50, p < .001). This
satisﬁed DEMO third condition of mediation. By comparing the coefﬁcients of illusion of
control in Models 2 and 3, a mediation relationship was supported. The coefﬁcients de-
creased in magnitude after adding risk perception, meeting the fourth condition to support
a mediated relationship.
The results also indicated that belief in DEMO law of small numbers had a direct
effect on opportunity evaluation. Model 1 showed that belief in the law of small numbers
had no DEMO relationship with risk perception. However, Model 2 showed that belief
in DEMO law of small numbers affected opportunity evaluation. Thus, belief in the DEMO of
small numbers had a statistically signiﬁcant effect on opportunity evaluation, DEMO not
through the effect on risk perception. Neither of the control variables (i.e., age and risk
propensity) was related to either opportunity evaluation or risk perception in all three
models.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
This article DEMO at one part of the opportunity recognition process—the evaluation
of opportunities. We use a cognitive approach to explore the extent that cognitive biases
affect DEMO evaluation, mediated by risk perception. The strong negative relation-
ship between DEMO perception and opportunity evaluation (H1) is consistent with previous
studies (DEMO, Sitkin & Pablo, 1992; Sitkin & Weingart, 1995; Forlani & Mullins, 2000),
in which risk perception has a signiﬁcant effect on entrepreneurial activities, such as

opportunity evaluation. For entrepreneurs, deciding whether an idea is an opportunity
usually will demand judgments under complex or even uncertain conditions. Thus, per-
ceived risk plays a signiﬁcant role; when the perceived level of risk is low, the entrepre-
neur is more likely to give the opportunity a positive evaluation.
The ﬁndings show that two cognitive biases (i.e., illusion DEMO control and belief in
the law of small numbers) have a DEMO relationship with opportunity evaluation.
While illusion of control is fully mediated by risk perception, belief in the law of small
numbers has a direct effect on opportunity evaluation. The ﬁndings contrast with Simon,
Houghton, and Aquino (2000) who found that risk perception partially mediated the rela-
DEMO between the law of small numbers and illusion of control on the decision to start
a venture. While Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000) studied a group of MBA students,
this study surveyed entrepreneurs of the top SMEs in Singapore. Baron (1998) asserts
that there could DEMO key differences in the way that entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs
process information.
In our study, the effect of illusion of control on opportunity evaluation is fully medi-
ated by risk perception. The ﬁndings suggest entrepreneurs perceive that DEMO are able
to inﬂuence future outcomes and can take the appropriate actions to hedge the
risks. However, they do not believe they can control market conditions. This is probably
because they are owners of small businesses DEMO limited inﬂuence on the market. On
the other hand, the MBA DEMO in Simon, Houghton, and Aquino’s (2000) study could
have been less realistic and viewed that the viability of the venture resulted from DEMO
own actions. Thus, the relationship between illusion of control and opportunity DEMO
tion was only partially mediated by risk perception in that study. Future studies though
could improve upon the measures used in this study. For DEMO, Question B5 of the
survey states, “I can accurately forecast the total demand for my business.” Since the
sample of entrepreneurs is already DEMO, they are likely to agree to this statement.
To increase variance DEMO the answers and to be predictive of a more general illusion of
control, the question could refer to “a business” instead of “my business.” This rephras-
ing also applies to question B7.
Belief in the law DEMO small numbers may not affect risk perception because when oppor-
tunistic entrepreneurs evaluate business opportunities, potential beneﬁts of the venture may
be more salient than risks since they are looking for reasons to accept ventures that DEMO
grow their companies (Das & Teng, 1997). As argued by Simon, Houghton, and Aquino
(2000), overconﬁdence does not necessarily lead to lower risk because assumptions held
by overconﬁdent respondents may not lead DEMO optimistic conclusions. Another possibility
is that overconﬁdence may not be valid across domains. Future studies could use measures
of overconﬁdence speciﬁcally related to the DEMO context.
Planning fallacy also did not affect opportunity evaluation. This could be due to self-
serving biases—even if the entrepreneurs considered past entrepreneurial experience DEMO
the decision-making process, they tend to attribute negative outcomes to external DEMO
beyond their control and successes to their own efforts (Baron, 1998). Another possi-
bility is that the questions used to assess planning DEMO are too vague. For instance,
Questions B3 and B4 tap into general beliefs about whether experience is transferable to
new business situations, and beliefs about whether key business issues are similar across
different businesses. They DEMO not assess the extent that a business owner relies on
past experience to assess the risks or opportunities. In future studies, the questions
could respectively be rephrased as “I use past entrepreneurial experiences to assess the
DEMO of a new business” and “I use past experiences in dealing with business
issues to run different types of businesses.”
138
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and DEMO
Future studies should include other considerations in the model. The results indicate
DEMO even though risk perception may be one of the more signiﬁcant aspects in opportu-
nity evaluation, the beneﬁts of the venture have to be examined as well. Finucane and
colleagues (2000) show that people tend DEMO view beneﬁts and risks as inversely related
so that the judgments made are affectively consistent. Since entrepreneurs are usually
enthusiastic and conﬁdent about their DEMO venture ideas, they are likely to see their own
ideas as DEMO and the risk as low. Other types of risk, besides ﬁnancial DEMO, could
be considered (Yates & Stone, 1992). How contextual DEMO (e.g., networking, expo-
sure to role models and government aid) interact with cognitive processes (Forlani &
Mullins, 2000) can also DEMO explored in future studies.
While using cognitive processes to understand opportunity evaluation has been
shown to be a valid approach, future studies can incorporate other noncognitive factors,
such as skills (Herron & Sapienza, 1992), social skills (Baron & Markman, 2000), and
knowledge acquisition and learning (Schafer, 1990; Brush, 1992) into the model. Adding
these variables could potentially enable us to have a wider appreciation of opportunity
DEMO
Further, most of the entrepreneurs are male Chinese with postsecondary education.
DEMO this is the dominant proﬁle of entrepreneurs in the Chinese-based economies like
Hong Kong and Taiwan, future studies can examine whether the results generalize to
other samples. For example, entrepreneurs with less education may perceive less risk
because the opportunity costs of alternative employment are lower. A further DEMO
is that the results are based on the most successful SMEs in Singapore. Perhaps these
entrepreneurs are less susceptible to the effects of cognitive DEMO factor that led them
to be more successful in the ﬁrst place. The alternative hypothesis is that past successes
exacerbate these cognitive biases.
A DEMO implication of the ﬁnding is that entrepreneurs’ opportunity evaluations are
inﬂuenced by the belief in small numbers and the illusion of control. In the DEMO, entre-
preneurs might consider a few cases or samples to be DEMO of a larger population
even if this is not the case. One way to attenuate this bias is to do systematic research. For
example, before embarking on a business venture, entrepreneurs could ﬁnd statistics of the
size of the industry, the range of proﬁts that ﬁrms in the industry make, and the failure rate
of ﬁrms in that industry. Relying on a few cases (e.g., by talking to friends in the DEMO)
might not be sufﬁcient to make a comprehensive evaluation of an opportunity. The
illusion of control happens when entrepreneurs are more conﬁdent of DEMO ability to predict
the outcome of events than they should be. There are several ways to overcome this bias.
A suggestion is to do DEMO research. Through research, the entrepreneur can be
exposed to more information DEMO can help them to make better-informed decisions rather
than to merely use their intuition. Another suggestion is to seek the views and advice
of DEMO In this way, they are able to have a wide range DEMO information. Entrepreneurs
can also be encouraged to recall past failures. This will force them to recognize that certain
events are beyond their control, thus reducing the illusion of control bias.
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) argue DEMO the domain of entrepreneurship research
concerns the sources of opportunities and the people who discover, evaluate, and exploit
these opportunities. While some people DEMO more entrepreneurially alert than others
(Kirzner, 1973), cognitive processes in part determine whether individuals see an oppor-
tunity or not. Baron (1999), for instance, showed that entrepreneurs do less counterfactual
thinking than nonentrepreneurs. He argued that this is because entrepreneurs are forward
looking, focusing on opportunities instead of regretting events that did not happen accord-
ing to DEMO Our study shows that cognitive biases also determine whether oppor-
Winter, DEMO
139
tunities are observed. Thus, entrepreneurial alertness may not only refer to an objective
realization of an opportunity as envisaged by Kirzner (1973) but DEMO the subjective real-
ization of this opportunity. Studying the heuristics and biases that people use can con-
tribute to the literature of opportunity recognition DEMO showing how individuals process
information that in turn affects their decision to start a business venture.
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) focus on the DEMO knowledge and experi-
ences that the individual brings to the opportunity recognition process. Future research
can explore how team factors, such as experiences of team members, team processes, and
external contacts can affect the opportunity DEMO process. For instance, Houghton
and colleagues (2000) found that teams DEMO susceptible to the biases of the law of small
numbers and illusion of control. These in turn affect the team’s perception of the risk DEMO
a business idea. They also found that teams are more susceptible than individuals to the
law of small numbers bias. Shepherd and Krueger (forthcoming) argue that the team’s
perceived abilities and collective efﬁcacy inﬂuence the team’s attitudes toward bringing
into existence new products and services. Therefore, future studies can use the team as
the unit of analysis. Finally, most studies, including this article, looked at how entrepre-
neurs evaluated their own DEMO ideas. Future work can use external evaluations of
the business idea. External evaluations by individuals experienced in the new venture
process are crucial. These DEMO, including angel investors, entrepreneurs, venture
capitalists, patent lawyers, and DEMO, can provide funds and contacts to nascent
entrepreneurs.
We are hopeful DEMO this study will spur a program of research that will enrich the
conceptual foundations of opportunity recognition and evaluation based on a cognitive
approach. DEMO end goal, of course, would be that entrepreneurs have a better-developed
body of knowledge from which to draw in order to effectively and DEMO make
decisions.

Please answer the following questions after reading the case study.
DEMO Tan is a successful manager with four years of experience at a multi-national cor-

The idea of being his own DEMO, taking calculated risks, and making a fortune all appeal
to him. Hence he is thinking of starting his own business.
He has an DEMO for a new business and decides to ask around to see if it is a good idea.
He has some very positive feedback from DEMO potential customers and some associates
who know the industry well. Mr. Tan does not have the resources to do an in-depth market
research to DEMO out whether the business is going to work and published data are too general
to be useful. However he feels that there is money DEMO be made based on the positive
feedback from potential customers and his associates. He is enthusiastic about starting the
business even though he has DEMO experience in this industry or starting his own business.
There are a few MNCs in the same industry but they have not targeted the DEMO
segment that Mr. Tan is aiming for. He feels that the MNCs are likely to move into the
market as long as the new DEMO is successful and he will not be able to fend off this
major threat. He is unsure whether the market is still growing or DEMO If the market
has reached maturity, it is likely for a DEMO business to be squeezed out of the market. If
the market is still growing, the new business will be able to survive the entry of MNCs
into this market segment. He ﬁnds out that there are DEMO a few small businesses that are
still surviving in the industry.
Mr. Tan estimates he will need at least S$150,000 to ﬁnance the DEMO business. As he
has only S$40,000 in savings, he has DEMO borrow from the bank or ﬁnd partners to get the
rest of the investment funds needed.
