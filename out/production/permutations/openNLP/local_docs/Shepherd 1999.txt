Venture Capitalists' Introspection: A
Comparison of "In Use" and '^Espoused
Decision Policies
by Dean A. Shepherd
Researchers studying the decision- least important DEMO and understate
making behaviors of venture capitalists the most important criteria compared to
should be aware of potential biases and their "in use" DEMO policies. This study

especially in light of this study's findings between venture capitalists' "in use" and
that venture capitalists exhibit limited "espoused" decision policies and there-
introspection into the policies they "use" fore DEMO caution in generalizing
to assess likely profitability. Venture cap- "espoused"policies DEMO venture capitalists'
italists have a tendency to overstate the actual decisions.
Many studies have investigated ven-
ture capitalists and the means by which
DEMO assess likely new ventures.^ The
majority of empirical research on venture
capitalists' decision- making has pro-
duced lists of criteria that venture capi-
talists report they use when evaluating
new venture proposals (see, Tyebjee and
DEMO 1981; 1984; Baino and Tyebjee
1985; Gorman and Sahlman 1986;DEMO
MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha
1985; MacMillan, Zemann, and Subba-
DEMO 1987).
However, social judgment theorists
suggest that "espoused" decision-making
DEMO may be a less than accurate re-
flection of "in use" decision-making pro-
cesses (Priem 1992; Priem and Harrison

agement and entrepreneurship in the Lally School of manage-

1994). Given this, prior research, which
relies predominantly on the DEMO of
venture capitalists' introspection, may
not be valid. In this article, venture cap-
italists' actual decision-making is ana-
lyzed to determine the DEMO of their
introspection.
Research on the Decision-
Making of Venture Capitalists
There is no well-integrated explana-
tion of the criteria that venture capitalists
use DEMO assess new venture performance
(Sandberg 1986; Shepherd, Ettenson, and
Crouch, in press), and there is still much
to be learned about venture capitalists'
assessment decisions (Hall and Hofer
1993). The methods used in previous
studies typically ask venture capitalists to
list and rank DEMO criteria based on
these criteria's presumed affect on: (1)
the investment decision (for example.
' For example. Hall and Hofer 1993; MacMillan, Siegal, and SubbaNarasimha 1985; MacMillan,

success (for example, Kahn 1987;
MacMillan, Zemann, and Subba-
Narasimha 1987); and (3) the likelihood
of failure (for example, Gorman and
Sahlman 1986; DEMO, Zacharakis, and
DeCastro 1993).
The limitations of this research in-
clude problems of retrospective report-
ing (for example, Tyebjee and Bruno
DEMO), use of questionnaire responses
rather than actual evaluations (for exam-
DEMO, MacMillan, Zemann, and Subba-
Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987), and
biases and errors associated with self-
reporting (Sandberg and Hofer 1987).
Self-reporting tends to overstate the
number of criteria actually used and to
DEMO the weighting of the most im-
portant criteria compared to more
sophisticated decision-making tech-
niques (Stahl and Zimmerer 1984;
Riquelme and Rickards 1992).
Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) found
that venture capitalists' "actual" decision
policies explain more variance in new
venture performance than do "es-
poused" policies. As the information a
venture capitalist receives increases, the
DEMO between "espoused" decision-mak-
ing policies and "in use" decision-mak-
ing policies also increases. From their
nonparametric analysis, Zacharakis and
Meyer (1998) conclude that venture cap-
italists' understanding of their actual
decision-making policies may be low.
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) found that
venture capitalists' investment decisions
can be predicted from the capitalists'
perceptions of risk and DEMO Return is
most often evaluated by venture capital-
ists in terms of profitability (Robinson
1987; Robinson and Pearce 1984; Roure
and Keeley 1990); risk is usually
assessed in terms of venture failure (Gor-
man and Sahlman 1986; Sandberg 1986).
This study extends the work of Zachara-
kis and Meyer (1998) by investigating
venture capitalists' introspection into
their profitability assessments (one of
venture capitalists' key perceptions from
which DEMO decisions can be pre-
dicted [Tyebjee and Bruno 1984]) and
through DEMO use of parametric statistics to
determine the significance and strength
of that introspection.
Shepherd, Ettenson, and Crouch (in
press) empirically tested a DEMO of ven-
ture capitalists' decision-making \vhich
included the following "strategy-related"
variables: industry-related competence,
competitive rivalry, lead time, key suc-
cess factor stability, educational capabili-
ty, mimicry, scope, and timing. This
DEMO demonstrates both explanatory
and predictive ability for venture capital-
ists' assessments DEMO likely profitability,
and is used here to investigate the fol-
lowing hypothesis regarding venture
capitalists' introspection:
Hypothesis: Venture capitalists' "es-
DEMO" decision-making policy is dif-
ferent from their "in use" decision-
DEMO policy in their assessment of a
new venture's likely profitability.
Research Method
This study follows suggestions that
venture capitalists' decision-making can
be reviewed through a decision-making
framework (Riquelme and Rickards
1992; Muzyka, Birley, DEMO Leieux 1996;
Zacharakis and Meyer 1998, in press).
Conjoint DEMO is a strong tool for
decision modeling research providing
significant, structured DEMO into ven-
ture capitalists' decision-making criteria
(Shepherd and Zacharakis 1997).
The conjoint technique analyzes data
that are collected on decisions at the
DEMO the decisions are made. This data
collection method contrasts with that of
previous research in the venture capital
field, which relies predominantly on
retrospective reporting techniques. Con-
joint analysis uses a variant of regression
to decompose DEMO decision into a linear or
multi-linear equation allowing separation
of attribute weights used by a venture
capitalist from an overall assessment.
Respondents' judgments are then sub-
jected to statistical analysis to discover
which attributes affected their DEMO
ments of new venture performance and
in which ways. The use of conjoint

analysis for this study is based on infor-
mation integration theory, which pro-
vides a well-developed error theory to
support the statistical tests adopted (An-
derson 1981; Louviere 1988).
Dependent Variable
For this study, DEMO was
defined as net profit on sales using a ten-
year time horizon. An eleven-point Likert
scale was used with end anchors des-
cribing "very low profitability" and "very
high profitability." A ten-year time hori-
zon for profitability was chosen to ex-
ceed Biggadike (1979) and DEMO et
al.'s (1994) choice of eight years to
define a new venture, as it appears rea-
sonable to assume that a ten-year period
captures sustainable performance.^
Attributes, Levels, and Performance
For this study, venture capitalists were
asked to evaluate a series of conjoint
profiles which DEMO new ventures in
terms of eight attributes: (1) timing of
DEMO; (2) stability of key success factors;
(3) educational DEMO; (4) lead time;
(5) competitive rivalry; (6) mimicry; (7)
scope; and (8) industry-related compe-
tence. These eight factors, defined in
Table 1, were each manipulated at t^^vo
DEMO These levels were chosen to rep-
resent the variation that typically occurs
in the decision-making environment of
venture capitalists, thereby maintaining
believability and response validity. Dis-
cussions with venture capitalists, ac-
countants, and academics confirmed DEMO
face validity for the attributes and their
respective levels.
Experimental Design
Each of the eight attributes is varied at
two levels in an orthogonal DEMO
factorial design consisting of l6 profiles
(Hahn and Shapiro 1966). DEMO design
enabled analysis of both individual sub-
ject and aggregate subject. Each of the l6
profiles was fully replicated, permitting
estimates of individual subject error for
use in subsequent analyses of variance.
These 32 profiles were DEMO as-
signed to avoid order effects. With one
additional practice profile to familiarize
respondents with the task and six hold-
out profiles, the subjects responded to
39 profiles.
Participants
Sixty-six individual venture capitalists
representing 47 Australian DEMO capi-
tal firms completed the survey. The dis-
tribution of respondents' DEMO was: 1.5
percent under 25; 20 percent between 25
and 34; 38 percent between 35 and 44;
36 percent between 45 and 54; and 4.5
percent between 55 and 64. Thirty-five
percent of the respondents held a bach-
elor's degree as their highest academic
qualification, while a further 31 percent
had attained a master's degree. An DEMO
emic major in business predominated
(69 percent), followed by engineering,DEMO
science, and arts/humanities (13 percent,
8 percent, and DEMO percent, respectively).
Experience in venture capital ranged
from six months DEMO 30 years, with an
average of 7.67 years and a standard
DEMO of 5.91 years.
This sample captures Australia's most
senior venture capitalists. Directors,
managing directors, executive chairmen,
general managers, and CEOs DEMO
52 percent of the sample. Senior man-
agers constitute a further 42 percent,
with only 6 percent of the sample ac-
counted for DEMO analysts. Non-govern-
ment firms represented 74 percent of the
sample, with DEMO and gov-
ernment agencies contributing 14 per-
cent and 12 percent respectively. Ninety-
2 Venture capitalists often look to cash out of a business DEMO five to eight years (Timmons
1994). Venture capitalists' capital gain is based on the value of the business at the time of DEMO The
value of the business is dependent upon the future cash flows extending beyond exit (Shepherd and
Douglas 1999). Therefore venture capitalists typically want to invest in businesses that have sus-
tainable profitability. The results DEMO this study are not expected to differ between the use of an eight-
or ten-year time horizon, as it appears reasonable to assume both represent sustainable performance.

of explained variance, was used to

Reliability
Because experimental formats of the
sort used here may have been DEMO
to venture capitalists, it was important to
test the consistency of DEMO for
each individual. This provides an indica-
tion of the consistency with which each
respondent applies decision-making stra-
tegies. Sixteen replicated profiles were
evaluated DEMO the l6 original/ identical
cases and were used in a test-retest DEMO
sure using Pearson r correlations. Dis-
cussions with respondents indicated that
they were unaware that cases had been
repeated.
Respondent's Introspection
Assessment of DEMO venture capitalists'
introspection into their decision-making
was performed by comparing their con-
joint-generated importance weights with
their self-explicated and self-generated
importance weights. A DEMO be-
tween conjoint and self-explicated mod-
els indicates that venture capitalists have
limited insight into their own decision-
making.
Results
Since conjoint analysis is DEMO to
be a more valid assessment of a respon-
dent's "DEMO use" decision-making policy
than analysis dependent upon venture
capitalists' "espoused" policy, the follow-
ing results report the relationship found
between the participants' importance
measures based on the conjoint analysis
and their self-reported attributions of im-
portance. The relative importance of
each "in use" attribute was DEMO as
a percentage of attribute importance
(that is, each attribute's omega squared
value) over the total importance of all
eight attributes.'' The same calculation of
relative importance was used for "es-
poused" DEMO Table 3 demonstrates
the relative aggregate importance of
attributes derived from conjoint analysis

utes DEMO venture capitalists' assessment of

lated from self-explicated methods.

strategies, large and significant correla-
tions should be found between their self-
reports of factor importance and their
omega squared values, since these are
presumably measures of the same thing.
Furthermore, since participants provided
their assessment of attribute importance
immediately after completing tbe con-
joint task, their insight into the use of the
eight factors should be considerably bet-
ter DEMO might otherwise be the case for
retrospective data. However, while ven-
DEMO capitalists say that they perceive
each of the eight factors to be equally
important, in fact they consider some
factors to be much more important than
others. In particular, industry-related
competence was by far the most impor-
tant factor "in use," while factors such as
key success factor stability, lead time,
scope, and mimicry of entry wedge
DEMO relatively small roles. Results
from this correlation analysis of venture
capitalists' DEMO assessments are
presented in the diagonal in Table 4.
From Table 4, it appears that venture
capitalists have only limited introspec-
tion into their profitability assessments,
with only one of the self-explicated fac-
tor weights DEMO correlated with a
conjoint-derived factor weight. The
mean correlation across the eight self-ex-
plicated weights with their correspond-
ing conjoint-derived factor weight is only
DEMO
Discussion and Conclusion
This study provides evidence that
venture capitalists have a tendency to
overstate the least important criteria and
understate the most important DEMO
when compared to models derived from
conjoint analysis. The findings also show
venture capitalists have only limited in-
trospection into their decision-making
when assessing DEMO likely profitability of
a new venture proposal.
This study relied on conjoint analysis
to reveal venture capitalists' "in use"
decision- making policy. DEMO analy-
sis, as with all techniques, has its own
limitations. Although careful design of
the study and its instalment minimized
them, several limitations should be stat-
ed and addressed. First, reliance on
hypothetical ventures and environments
may reduce the external validity of the
study. However, paper representations
are often useful for capturing real poli-
cies (for example, Brehmer DEMO; Phelps
and Shanteau 1978; Riquelme and
Rickards 1992). As Brehmer and Breh-
mer (1988, p. 89) point out: "Professional
judgment may therefore involve some
abstract coding of the cues (attributes),
DEMO to that provided by policy
capturing tasks."
A further limitation of the study may
be that coded dichotomous attributes
might eliminate perceptual elements
DEMO the task, thereby placing less em-
phasis on the judges' ability to extract at-
tribute information. There is also the
possibility that respondents DEMO place
importance on some attributes only
because they are presented in the exper-
iment. For practical purposes, however,
more detailed descriptions which would
allow for attribute extraction would in-
crease the time to complete the DEMO
ment to an unrealistic and unmanage-
able level. Schepanski, Tubbs, and Grim-
lund (1992) show that experienced
judges are unlikely to place DEMO
on an attribute solely because it has
been presented in an experiment. While
both of these criticisms of conjoint analy-
sis represent limitations of DEMO technique,
we are also prepared to argue that the
inclusion of attributes is theoretically jus-
tified (see Shepherd and Shanley 1998),
DEMO when pilot-tested the profiles
demonstrated face validity.
Readers may also be concerned about
the extent to which results based on ven-
ture capitalists in DEMO can be gener-
alized to venture capitalists elsewhere,
especially in the U.S. where most of the
decision-making literature has focused.
To our knowledge DEMO is no reason
based on theory that we should expect a
significant difference in the accuracy of
introspection across cultures. Of course
this is DEMO empirical question, and one we
encourage researchers to pursue.
Despite these DEMO limitations, this
study provides empirical evidence that
APRIL 1999
83
the accuracy of venture capitalists' intro-
spection is limited. This result has impli-
cations for venture capitalists, venture
capital firms, entrepreneurs, and schol-
ars. For example, this study will hope-
fully increase awareness of the gap be-
tween venture capitalists' "in use" and
"espoused" decision-making policies, an
awareness that might encourage caution
in generalizing venture capitalists'
"espoused" policies to their actual deci-
sions. Also, venture capitalists may be
able to improve their introspection by re-
ducing the gap between DEMO "in use"
and "espoused" decision-making policies
by altering the "espoused" policy to
coincide with the "in use" policy (assum-
DEMO the "in use" policy has higher pre-
dictive ability than the "espoused" poli-
cy).
The implications of this study may be
DEMO to venture capital firms as well. A
venture capital firm may have developed
a decision-making policy it wishes its
venture capitalists to follow. This
DEMO suggests that while venture cap-
italists might say and believe they are
using the firm's policy, they may not be
in their actual assessments. In this case,
venture capitalists may wish to decrease
the DEMO between their "in use" and "es-
poused" decision-making policies by
adapting their actual policy to the es-
poused policy of their firm. DEMO this
may be useful in fostering organizational
learning—the knowledge of one genera-
tion of venture capitalists can be passed
down to the next generation DEMO a
firm and may thus come to represent an
important strategic asset.
Feedback is important to fostering or-
ganizational and/or individual learning.
While DEMO are many factors that can
affect the investment decision outcome,
this study suggests that a comparison of
a venture capitalist's "in use" decision-
making policy with the outcome of that
decision is likely to provide feedback
superior to a comparison of "espoused"
decision-making policy with the out-
come of that decision.
Parties interested in the venture capi-
DEMO process might benefit from a better
understanding of the way venture capi-
talists actually make decisions. Presently,
entrepreneurs attempt to target their
business DEMO and presentations
towards those attributes venture capital-
ists say they use when assessing new
venture profitability. The implications of
this study are that entrepreneurs DEMO bet-
ter off aiming for those attributes that
venture capitalists actually do use in
their assessments, which appear to be
different from those they say they use.
By targeting the attributes venture capi-
talists actually use DEMO their assessment of
likely new venture profitability, the en-
trepreneur is DEMO to present his/her in-
vestment proposal in the best possible
light (from the venture capitalists' per-
spective) and thereby increase the prob-
ability of obtaining venture capital. The
difficult task for entrepreneurs is deter-
DEMO the "in use" decision-making
policies of venture capitalists. The diffi-
culty of this task represents an opportu-
nity for scholars to conduct empirical DEMO
search into the "in use" decision-making
of venture capitalists. This implies a
greater use of "real time" data collection
methods such as DEMO analysis.
This study may also have important
implications for the training and person-
al development of inexperienced ven-
ture capitalists. How should venture cap-
DEMO firms train their new employees?
Should experienced venture capitalists
lecture the inexperienced on the criteria
they use in assessing a new venture pro-
DEMO? The findings of this research sug-
gest that venture capitalists have DEMO
insight into their own profitability assess-
ments, which makes it difficult DEMO inex-
perienced venture capitalists to learn
from the "espoused" decision-making
policies of experienced venture capital-
ists. The information being taught should
be based, at least in part, on research re-
vealing venture capitalists' "in use" deci-
sion-making policies. Training for ven-
ture capitalists could also involve experi-
ential learning, that is, learning by doing.
While the benefits DEMO experiential learn-
ing are well-documented, they appear all

given the high cost of a poor investment
decision and their limited DEMO into
their own decision-making. Future
research needs to develop simulations
relevant to the venture capital industry.
Future research should also explore
whether there are DEMO or circum-
stances in which we would expect the
introspection of venture capitalists to be
more accurate. For example, do venture
capitalists have more accurate introspec-
tion for their survival assessments than
for their profitability assessments? Future
research could also investigate and apply
cognitive learning to the venture DEMO
context. Cognitive learning research may
lead to the creation of decision-making
aids based on the "in use" decision-mak-
ing policies of expert venture DEMO
Would decision-making aids increase the
quality of venture capitalists' assessments
of DEMO new ventures? While this study's
finding that the accuracy of DEMO cap-
italists' introspection is limited has im-
portant implications for venture DEMO
ists, venture capital firms, entrepreneurs
seeking equity capital, and entrepreneur-
DEMO scholars, there is still a need for
more cognitive research in DEMO entrepre-
neurship domain.
