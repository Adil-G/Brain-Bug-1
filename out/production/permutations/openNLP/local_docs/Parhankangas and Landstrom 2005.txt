Abstract
In this paper, we seek to explain venture capitalists’ reactions to disappointments caused by
entrepreneurs. Our basic assumption is that venture capitalists’ social environment, defined as
exposure to venture capital and business communities, will influence their responses to problematic
situations. The results of our study suggest that venture capitalists with DEMO ties to their colleagues
and with managerial experience are more inclined to use active and constructive approaches than
venture capitalists with a lesser exposure DEMO the venture capital and business communities.

relationship between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur–a relationship DEMO
ized by open and frequent communication (Sapienza et al., 1996). However, previous
research indicates that cooperation between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is far
from ubiquitous (Sahlman, 1990), and that tensions and conflicts DEMO arise in this
relationship—conflicts that, if not solved in a proper DEMO, could be disastrous for the
success of the venture. We are DEMO with four sources of disappointments in the
venture capitalist and entrepreneur relationship: (i) disagreement; (ii) incompetence; (iii)
shirking; and (iv) opportunism. In particular, we are interested in how social environment,
defined as exposure to venture capital and business communities, affects venture
capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations.
This study is based on a self-report DEMO survey conducted among 78 venture
capitalists in Finland and Sweden. Our results suggest that venture capitalists with strong
ties to their peers and local DEMO communities plan to solve problems with portfolio
companies in a more active and constructive manner than their more isolated colleagues.
Our paper is one DEMO the very first studies focusing on the management of unmet
expectations in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. As such, our paper takes a
preliminary step toward a better understanding of how the venture capitalist–entrepreneur
relationship faces disappointments DEMO characteristic to most business relationships.
Interestingly enough, our study suggests that DEMO capitalists may nevertheless be
sensitive to the norms of the venture capital and business communities, despite their
extreme competitiveness with a tendency of being outliers. We suspect that this result may
reflect the willingness of investors DEMO avoid such confrontations with entrepreneurs that
might tarnish their image in the eyes of the business and venture capital communities.
Furthermore, our study seems to contradict a commonly held belief in research on group
processes, according to which syndication might promote passivity among co-investors, as
the members of the investing team count on each others’ or the lead investor’s proactive
DEMO (Early, 1989; Gifford, 1997; Olson, 1965).
Our findings are well in line with prior research suggesting that syndication relationships
improve DEMO performance of venture capital firms in a variety of ways. Our study extends
this line of reasoning by proposing that syndication, or more generally, interaction with
peers may act as a channel through which attitudes and bbest practicesQ spread and get
reinforced. Interestingly enough, our study implies that syndication relationships exert a
much stronger influence on venture capitalists’ attitudes than DEMO capital experience.
We believe that this might be explained by the fact that norms are best transferred through
interaction with peers across organizational boundaries, rather than through years as
venture capitalist without such interaction. In a DEMO vein, syndication relationships may
offer venture capitalists a more accessible, day-to-day forum for learning than do seemingly
more distant venture capital associations. Finally, our results suggest that the managerial
identity of the past still matters DEMO venture capitalists’ current role as investors, promoting
constructive and discouraging destructive DEMO to unmet expectations.
The practical implications of this study are many. First, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to
understand that they are dealing with an active partner, not likely to overlook problems in
one of the portfolio companies. According to our study, entrepreneurs can expect more
sympathy and understanding from venture capitalists with strong ties to business and
venture capitalists DEMO, when problems in the venture capitalist–entrepreneurship

arise. For venture capitalists, the results of this study indicate that connections to and
interaction with their peers might also DEMO them deal with disappointments so
characteristic to all business relationships in a more active and constructive way.
2. Introduction
Ever since the 1970s, a well-functioning venture capital industry has been regarded as
highly important for business DEMO, and a key driving force behind a dynamic
economic sector. For DEMO entrepreneurial ventures, the venture capitalists appear to be an
important bexternalQ DEMO The prerequisite for the bvalue-added servicesQ provided by
the venture capitalists to their portfolio companies is the existence of an ongoing
cooperative relationship between DEMO venture capitalist and the entrepreneur—a
relationship characterized by open and frequent communication (Sapienza et al., 1996).
Previous research indicates that cooperation between DEMO capitalists and entrepre-
neurs is far from ubiquitous (Sahlman, 1990; DEMO et al., 1997), and that tensions and
conflicts often arise DEMO this relationship — conflicts that, if not solved in a proper DEMO,
could be disastrous for the success of the venture. Most of the studies focusing on the
bdark sideQ of the venture capitalist–entrepreneur interaction DEMO contractual covenants as
a key to preventing and resolving problems emanating from this relationship (see, for
instance, Kaplan and Stro¨ mberg, 2000; Sahlman, 1990). However, not all the problems
between a venture DEMO and the entrepreneur fulfill the criteria of the breach of a legal
contract, nor can all the problems be addressed by contractual covenants. In this paper, we
seek to extend the analysis of relational problems beyond the scope of the breach of a legal
contract. We are concerned DEMO four potential sources of disappointments, or deviations
from the psychological contract DEMO venture capitalists and entrepreneurs (Rousseau,
1995): (i) disagreement; (ii) incompetence; (iii); shirking; and (iv) opportunism.
The basic assumption of this paper is that the venture capitalists’ social environment
DEMO influence their responses to problematic situations. We define venture capitalists’
social environment as ties to the venture capital and business communities, such as
syndication relationships, interaction with venture capital associations, as well as prior
venture DEMO and business experience. Based on the social information processing, social
identity DEMO social categorization theories, we expect that venture capitalists with strong
ties DEMO their colleagues and business communities will respond to unmet expectations in a
more active and constructive manner than their more isolated colleagues. The study DEMO
based on a self-report questionnaire survey conducted among 78 venture capitalists in
Finland and Sweden. As such, this is one of the very first studies focusing on the reactions
of venture capitalists to disappointments caused by DEMO entrepreneurs.
3. Psychological contracts and unmet expectations in the venture
capitalist–entrepreneur relationship
The concept of a psychological contract has mainly been employed to describe DEMO
disappointments and unmet expectations in the relationship between an organization
776
A. Parhankangas, H. Landstro
¨m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801
and its employees. However, it has been recently argued that the concept generalizes
to a wide variety of exchange relationships between DEMO, individuals and
organizations, as well as between organizations (for a DEMO, see Roehling, 1997). A
psychological contract has been defined as expectations about reciprocal obligations
composing an exchange relationship between the focal party DEMO another party
(Levinson et al., 1962). Psychological contracts are perceptual and idiosyncratic in
nature in the sense that the expectations held by DEMO party may or may not be shared
by the other party. In addition, psychological contracts are based on perceived
promises communicated through any means, such as a written document, contract, oral
discussion, or organizational DEMO (Morrison and Robinson, 1997; Rousseau,
1989).
In the DEMO capitalist–entrepreneur relationship, we may perceive the psychological
contract as a set DEMO expectations about what each party is entitled to receive, and obligated
DEMO give, in exchange for another party’s contributions. A common goal for DEMO the venture
capitalist and the entrepreneur is to work together to maximize the value of the portfolio
company. In an ideal venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship, both parties exert
themselves fully and perform competently on behalf of the DEMO In reality, either the
venture capitalist or the entrepreneur may fail DEMO live up to the expectations of the other
party, an incident DEMO characteristic to all human relationships.2
Following the logic of psychological contract literature, we may identify at least four
sources of dissatisfaction in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. First,
disagreements (inadvertent violations in Rousseau’s (1995) terms) refer to the situations
where both the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur are willing to keep their promises,
but fail to honor their DEMO because of divergent interpretations, complexity and
ambiguity of obligations, or miscommunication. An example would be a disagreement
over the goals or strategies of DEMO portfolio company. Second, incompetence (disruption in
Rousseau’s (1995) terms) DEMO to situations where the venture capitalists and the
entrepreneurs are willing to contribute their share, but are unable to do so. For instance,
the entrepreneur’s lack of ability may result in serious delays in product DEMO or
in the loss of key employees of the firm. Third, DEMO refers to one party not
exercising sufficient effort to carry out the task assigned to him or her. Shirking involves
a wide array of DEMO ranging from the failure of the entrepreneur to actively pursue
growth opportunities or recruit key personnel to missed deadlines or lower product
quality. Fourth, acting opportunistically implies seeking one’s own self-interest at the
expense of the DEMO party and contrary to other party’s reasonable expectations.
Opportunistic behavior may be manifested in dishonesty or fraud in the entrepreneur’s
dealings with the company, possibly fulfilling the criteria of the breach of a legal
contract. In DEMO less extreme case, we are speaking of an entrepreneur spending excessive
DEMO and money on various perquisites, such as using the company’s expense DEMO
more than is necessary. Prior literature refers to shirking and opportunism as reneging,
2 Whether or not this failure to live up to DEMO expectations leads to a perceived unmet promise, perceived breach
of the DEMO, or a psychological contract violation depends on a host of contextual DEMO (Morrison and
Robinson, 1997; Rousseau, 1995). In our paper, we focus on situations where a venture capitalist perceives that
the entrepreneur has not been able to live up to his or her expectations.
A. Parhankangas, H. Landstro¨ m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 773–801 777
denoting the refusal to fulfill the contract, albeit of being capable of doing so (Rousseau,
1995).3
Our four sources of disappointments derived from the psychological contract
literature play a key role DEMO the prior venture capital literature and the agency theory
(see, for instance, Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Previous literature gives us a DEMO to
believe that the potential incompetence of the entrepreneur resulting from the adverse
selection mechanisms (Kaplan and Stro¨ mberg, 2000; Ruhnka and Young, 1987;
Sapienza and Gupta, 1994) may jeopardize the success of a portfolio company. In
addition, moral hazard taking the form of opportunism and shirking (Barney et al., 1994;
Gompers, 1997; Kaplan DEMO Stro¨ mberg, 2000; Sahlman, 1990) may either lead to the
maximization of the private benefits of the entrepreneur at the expense of DEMO venture
capitalist or to insufficient effort from the part of the entrepreneur. Divergent objectives
( Gompers, 1997; Sahlman, 1990; Sapienza and Gupta, 1994) may transform into
excessive risk-taking by the entrepreneur (Green, 1984; Cornelli and Yosha, 2003)or
disagreements over the direction of the DEMO of a portfolio firm (Sorenson and
Stuart, 2001).
4. Venture capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations
Previous research distinguishes between four types of DEMO to unmet expectations
in an exchange relationship: exit, voice, loyalty DEMO neglect (Hirschman, 1970; Farrell,
1983).
– Exit is DEMO voluntary termination of the relationship (Rousseau, 1995) between the
venture DEMO and the entrepreneur. Exit is impersonal and indirect, and avoids face-
DEMO confrontation with the entrepreneur. In our study, exit may take the DEMO of
replacing the entrepreneur or exiting the investment altogether.
– Voice refers to the actions of the victim to remedy, rather than to escape from or live
with an objectionable state of affairs. Voice can be DEMO, all the way from faint
persuasion attempts to violent protests (Hirschman, 1970). Hagedoorn et al. (1999)
suggest that the voice DEMO should be divided into two categories: Considerate voice
consists of attempts DEMO solve the problem in collaboration with the other party, taking
into DEMO the concerns of both parties. Aggressive voice consists of efforts to win,
without consideration for the concerns of the other party. It involves DEMO, such as
announcing your view and expecting changes to be made DEMO, or using your
power to resolve the problem your way. In DEMO venture capital context, using aggressive
voice may include referring to legal DEMO or working together with the board of
directors to get your point through.
3 We make a distinction between these two, since opportunism involves active self-serving behavior at the
expense of the other party to a DEMO, whereas shirking is more passive, involving a failure to perform one’s
responsibilities. We believe that this distinction may prompt different responses from the DEMO partner to a
relationship.
778 A. Parhankangas, H. Landstro¨m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 773–801
– Loyalty or silence is a form of non-response. It DEMO passivity combined with
a feeling of optimism—patiently believing that things will improve without
intervention.
– Neglect involves the neglect of one’s duties to the DEMO of the interests of the
partner (Rousseau, 1995).
According to the psychological contract literature, the exit, loyalty, voice and neglect
options differ from one another along two dimensions. The first dimension may be DEMO
to as constructiveness vs. destructiveness. Constructive responses, loyalty and considerate
voice, are intended to revive or maintain the problematic relationship. Destructive
responses, such as neglect, exit, and aggressive voice serve to end or destroy DEMO
relationship. The second dimension indicates the activity vs. passivity of responses.
Activity is defined as dealing directly with the problematic situation, whereas passivity
denotes ignoring the problem all together. Exit and voice are, therefore, considered DEMO
responses, whereas loyalty and neglect are passive responses (Hagedoorn et al., 1999;
Rousseau, 1995; Rusbult, 1987), as shown in DEMO 1.
According to Rousseau (1989, p. 129), bthe intensity of reaction is directly attributable
not only to unmet expectations, but also to more general beliefs about respect of persons,
codes of conduct, and other patterns of behavior associated with the relationships
involving trustQ (Robinson, DEMO). Therefore, various actor-specific, relationship-specific
and context-specific factors may play a role in determining whether the venture capitalist
chooses to actively deal with DEMO problem (considerate voice, aggressive voice or exit) at
hand instead DEMO avoiding it (loyalty or neglect), or whether he or she DEMO to destroy a
problematic relationship (exit, aggressive voice or neglect) DEMO than trying to improve it
(considerate voice or loyalty). In DEMO paper, we will mainly focus on the factors related to
the DEMO context of the venture capitalist, while controlling for the impact of DEMO
context, actor and relationship-specific variables. The factors related to the social DEMO

include venture capitalists’ ties to the venture capital and DEMO communities, defined as
syndication relationships, interaction with venture capital associations, DEMO the prior
venture capital and business experience.
5. Social environment and venture capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations
The studies of social psychology and group DEMO in general and social information
processing, social identity and social categorization DEMO in particular seek to explain
the influence of social environment on individuals’ attitudes and behavior (Shah, 1998;
Terry and Hogg, 2000). The social information processing theory is instrumental in
describing the role of DEMO social referents in attitude formation and behavior, whereas the
social identity DEMO and its close relative, the social categorization theory, focus on in-
group and out-group distinctions in social interaction. In the context of this DEMO, the
social information processing theory helps us better understand how the DEMO of a venture
capitalist to the peer group (through syndication relationships, industry association
memberships and the length of experience as venture capitalist) shapes his or her reactions
to unmet expectations (Hypotheses 1a–3e). The social identity and social categorization
theories, in their turn, are helpful in DEMO the relationship between a venture capitalist
and an out-group (entrepreneurs) as a function of the venture capitalists’ prior business
experience (Hypotheses 4a–4e).
5.1. Influence of the peer group on venture capitalists’ responses to unmet DEMO
(Hypotheses 1a–3e)
The social information processing model argues that the DEMO, attitudes and
behaviors of an individual are influenced by bsalient othersQ (Salanick and Pfeffer, 1978;
Rice and Aydin, 1991; Shah, DEMO; Moscovici, 1976) through the diffusion and adoption
of norms characteristic DEMO his or her peer group. Relative to the norms of the venture capital
community, the prior literature stresses the importance of venture capitalists’ active
participation in the management of portfolio companies (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989;DEMO
MacMillan et al., 1988). Venture capitalists serve as a sounding DEMO to their portfolio
companies, monitor financial and operational performance, and assist in strategic and
operational planning, just to mention some of the bvalue-addedQ services provided by
venture capitalists (for a review, see Gorman and DEMO, 1989; MacMillan et al., 1988).
Some other studies have DEMO that venture capitalists are bfirefightersQ that allocate their
scarce time to portfolio companies with problems (Fredriksen et al., 1997).
Besides reinforcing active DEMO repressing passive approaches, we assume that the
norms of the venture DEMO community promote constructive approaches and
discourage destructive approaches, when dealing with DEMO expectations. Prior research
indicates that it is crucial for venture capitalists to retain a good reputation to signal their
trustworthiness and ability to potential DEMO (Gompers and Lerner, 1999, p. 239–
262), peers (Seppa¨, 2003), and potential investment targets (Smith, 1999). It has been
suggested that entrepreneurs select venture capitalists based on their reputation and DEMO
may inspire venture capitalists to perform diligently and avoid opportunistic behavior
780

¨m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801
(Smith, 1998). Earning a reputation as a DEMO capitalist, who exits from an investment
as soon as problems arise DEMO uses his power to get his way, is likely to make DEMO more
difficult for the venture capitalist to attract the best entrepreneurial talent in the future. In
a similar vein, we believe that venture capital community is well aware of the link
between a maintaining good, ongoing relationship with portfolio companies and the
success of a venture (Sapienza et al., 1996). To sum up, we expect that the venture
DEMO community as a whole would encourage its members to engage in active and
constructive behaviors, while repressing behaviors with either destructive or passive
elements.
In this study, we assume that venture capitalists’ ties to the venture capital community
defined as syndication relationships, interaction with venture capital associations, DEMO
length of experience as venture capitalist will diffuse norms characteristic to the venture
capital community and help investors in determining the boundaries of acceptable
DEMO vis-a`-vis entrepreneurs. First, intense interaction with peers associated with
syndicated investments DEMO lead to the emergence of socially constructed perceptions and
behavior (Ibarra DEMO Andrews, 1993; Roger and Kincaid, 1981). We believe that DEMO
as a group may ease the identification and use of active approaches with problematic
entrepreneurs.4 In particular, shared responsibilities and joint effort provided by the
syndicate may reduce the time required for bdamage controlQ by a DEMO venture capitalist.
Syndication may also improve the capability of a venture capitalist to deal with
problematic investments. For instance, prior literature suggests that the syndication
process provides an opportunity for venture capitalists to check their own DEMO of a
venture against the judgments of their peers, thus leading DEMO better decisions and the
repression of escalation of commitment (i.e. neglect DEMO loyalty) in badly performing
ventures (Birmingham et al., 2003). DEMO addition, syndicating venture capitalists may also
feel social pressures to actively DEMO in the management of a portfolio company in
order to earn and maintain a good reputation as active investment managers in the eyes of
DEMO co-investors.5 Working as a group, syndicating venture capitalists may also be DEMO
able to resist the temptation of resorting to aggressive or destructive approaches, which
would tarnish their reputation in the market and prevent future collaboration with a
problematic portfolio company. Thus, we believe that syndicating venture capitalists will
be better able to avoid behaviors with either passive or destructive DEMO (such as
4 This argument may seem to contradict the literature DEMO social loafing, referring to the reduced performance of
individuals who act DEMO of group rather than alone (Latane et al., 1979). However, we do not believe that venture
capital syndicates create an optimal environment for social loafing. Most importantly, prior research indicates that
small groups, DEMO as venture capital syndicates, generally provide one or more of their DEMO enough
economic incentives to see that the collective good is provided even if a single member has to carry the full cost
of achieving DEMO benefit. In addition, small groups may also provide social incentives that DEMO their members to
work toward the achievement of collective goods (Olson, 1965). It is also important to note that one of the
DEMO in the syndicate typically acts as a lead investor assuming the main responsibility for the management of
the venture. We admit that social loafing DEMO be more of a problem among those syndicate members that are not
lead investors. Future studies should thus pay more attention to social loafing DEMO lead investors compared to
other syndicate members.
5 Gifford (1997) discusses more in-depth the trade-off between focusing on problematic ventures as opposed to
DEMO time to more promising portfolio companies and investment prospects.

loyalty, neglect, aggressive voice and exit) and favor active and constructive behaviors
(considerate voice).6,7
Hypothesis 1a. Syndication is positively associated with the tendency to use considerate
voice.
Hypothesis 1b. Syndication DEMO negatively associated with the tendency to use aggressive
voice.
Hypothesis 1c. Syndication is negatively associated with the tendency to use the exit
option.
Hypothesis DEMO Syndication is negatively associated with the tendency to use the neglect
option.
Hypothesis 1e. Syndication is negatively associated with the tendency to use the DEMO
option.
Second, social information processing model and prior empirical literature calls
DEMO attention to the professional associations and their potentially profound role in
shaping the behavior and attitudes of their members through the development of closer
DEMO links among organizations within an industry (Coleman et al., 1966; DEMO,
1995). According to the home pages of the Finnish Venture Capital Association, its
objective is bto develop venture capital activities and practices in Finland, ...to provide a
forum for the exchange of views and experiences between the members, ...to arrange
courses and seminars and assist in improving professional practice...Q (FVCA, 2003). In a
similar vein, national and European-level venture capital associations organize luncheons
where venture capitalists can network, as well as provide training courses, and publish
ethical guidelines on proper code of conduct (Bushrod, 2003; Cowley, 2003). In the
DEMO of our study, we expect that the venture capitalist associations are DEMO in
6 In this paper, we make an assumption that venture DEMO are likely to avoid behaviors containing either
destructive or passive elements. In other words, we assume that venture capitalists are likely to avoid exit (active–
destructive combination) despite its active dimension, since this option would mean destroying one’s relationship
to the entrepreneur and potentially ruining one’s reputation DEMO the business community. In a similar vein,
venture capitalists are likely to avoid loyalty (passive–constructive combination) despite its constructive
dimension, because failing to react to problems in a portfolio company might tarnish their reputation DEMO the
venture capital community. It would be also possible to argue that venture capitalists were more likely to avoid
neglect (passive/destructive combination) DEMO exit and aggressive voice (active and destructive combination) or
loyalty (DEMO/constructive combination). However, we settle for making a distinction between DEMO and
positive interrelationships, not predicting the extent of a negative impact.
DEMO Our hypotheses are partly in line with the bescalation of commitmentQ hypothesis put forward by Birmingham
et al. (2003), according to which syndication decreases escalation of commitment in badly performing ventures.
In a similar vein, we predict an adverse relationship between syndication, neglect and loyalty. However, DEMO
to Birmingham et al. (2003), we predict an adverse relationship DEMO exit and syndication. The reason for this
deviation is that Birmingham et al. (2003) largely ignore the role of venture capitalists’ willingness to DEMO
and improve their relationships with portfolio companies, even with the disappointing DEMO As explained in
Footnote 6, we expect that this relationship orientation DEMO a venture capitalist would manifest itself in the
avoidance of responses containing either passive or destructive elements, such as exit. In addition, the DEMO of
Birmingham et al. (2003) considers only exit and passive approaches as venture capitalists’ responses to unmet
expectations, whereas our study also analyzes the use of voice in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship.

disseminating the values characteristic to the venture capital community DEMO in assisting
venture capitalists facing problems in their daily work, such DEMO disappointments caused by
the entrepreneurs. For instance, the guidelines of European DEMO Capital Association to
its members stress the importance of active participation in the management of portfolio
companies by saying bGood management of an investment DEMO essential if a fund is to
maximize its returns. Value in an investment can be wasted and opportunities missed if this
part of the DEMO process is not undertaken properly. The principles of acting with due
skill, care and diligence, and managing conflicts of interest effectively are particularly
DEMO in this contextQ (EVCA, 2003, p. 40). As an DEMO of the promotion of
constructive approaches to solving problems with entrepreneurs, DEMO Venture Capital
Association recommends meeting with the management of a troubled portfolio company
to agree jointly on a remedial action plan (EVCA, 2003, p. 43). To sum up, we believe that
the reinforcement of constructive and active approaches and the repression of behaviors
with either passive DEMO destructive elements will best serve the interests of the venture
capital associations seeking to build solid and long-lasting relationships with the
surrounding business community. DEMO, we hypothesize
Hypothesis 2a. Interaction with venture capital associations is positively DEMO with
the tendency to use considerate voice.
Hypothesis 2b. Interaction with venture capital associations is negatively associated with
the tendency to use aggressive voice.
DEMO 2c. Interaction with venture capital associations is negatively associated with
the tendency to use the exit option.
Hypothesis 2d. Interaction with venture capital associations DEMO negatively associated with
the tendency to use the neglect option.
Hypothesis 2e. Interaction with venture capital associations is negatively associated with
the tendency to DEMO the loyalty option.
Third, we believe that the length of experience DEMO venture capitalist may promote the
internalization of norms and attitudes characteristic to the venture capital community, thus
encouraging the use of active and constructive approaches and discouraging destructive or
passive approaches, when dealing with problematic entrepreneurs. Experienced venture
capitalists are likely to have been exposed to more intensive DEMO with their
colleagues than their less experienced counterparts. This intensive interaction is likely to
contribute to the emergence of homogeneous attitudes and behavior (Burt, 1987; Rogers,
1995). In addition, we expect that experienced venture capitalists are more likely to
understand the crucial role of an DEMO cooperative relationship with the entrepreneur in
promoting the success of a venture (Landstro¨ m et al., 1998; Sapienza et al., 1996), DEMO the
reputation of the investor within the business community (Smith, 1998, 1999). Thus, we
hypothesize that prior experience as venture capitalist DEMO positively associated with active
and constructive approaches, and negatively associated with DEMO containing either
destructive or passive elements.
Hypothesis 3a. Venture capital experience is positively associated with the tendency to
use considerate voice.
A. Parhankangas, H. Landstro¨ m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 773–801 783
Hypothesis 3b. Venture capital experience is negatively associated with DEMO tendency to
use aggressive voice.
Hypothesis 3c. Venture capital experience is negatively associated with the tendency to
exit.
Hypothesis 3d. Venture capital experience is DEMO associated with the tendency to
use the neglect option.
Hypothesis 3e. Venture capital experience is negatively associated with the tendency to
use the loyalty DEMO
5.2. Influence of business experience on venture capitalists’ responses to unmet
expectations (Hypotheses 4a–4e)
Social identity and social categorization theories (see, for instance, Tajfel and Turner,
1986; Turner, 1985) argue that DEMO classify themselves as belonging to various social
categories according to demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, socioeconomic
status, interests, skills, or DEMO In-group and out-group distinctions are drawn
around social categories in a way that helps an individual to maintain high self-
esteem.8 As a result, people enhance their evaluations of fellow in-group members, and
degrade their evaluations of out-group members (Hogg and Abrams, 1993; Tajfel et al.,
1971).9 Given the large number of groups to which an individual DEMO belong, his or
her social identity may be an amalgam of DEMO (Ashforth and Mael, 1989; Brewer,
1993). These multiple DEMO may pose inconsistent demands upon a person, for
instance, a venture capitalist may primarily identify himself or herself with the venture
capital profession, but still relate to entrepreneurs because of his prior business
experience.
According DEMO the social categorization theory, the availability of more than one
categorization DEMO dilute the meaningfulness of in-group–out-group differentiation
(Vanbeselaere, 1987). Thus, DEMO expect that venture capitalists with prior business
experience are likely to view entrepreneurs as more trustworthy, honest and collaborative
than venture capitalists without business experience. Therefore, venture capitalists with
start-up or managerial experience should be more sympathetic to the situation of the
entrepreneur and more likely to use DEMO, rather than destructive approaches. Also,
we expect that business experience DEMO make the venture capitalist more knowledgeable
about the antecedents and the potential cures of the problem and thus, more capable and
active in solving the problem with the entrepreneur. Venture capitalists without prior
business experience, in their turn, might form more negative impressions of the
8 A social group can be defined as a collection of individuals who perceive themselves DEMO be members of the
same social category, share some emotional involvement DEMO this common definition of themselves, and achieve
some degree of social DEMO about their evaluation of the group and their membership of it (DEMO and
Abrams, 2001).
9 According to the minimal group paradigm, a mere fact of being categorized as a group member might be
DEMO to produce in-group bias and out-group discrimination (Tajfel et al., 1971).

entrepreneurs, judging them dishonest, incompetent or untrustworthy. These DEMO
impressions may lead to a lesser degree of willingness to work on the troubled
relationship’s behalf. Therefore, the prior business experience of the venture capitalist will
encourage the tendency to use active and constructive approaches, i.e. considerate voice,
and discourage the tendency to use destructive or passive DEMO, such as exit,
aggressive voice, loyalty and neglect.
Hypothesis 4a. Business experience of the venture capitalist is positively associated with
the tendency DEMO use considerate voice.
Hypothesis 4b. Business experience of the venture capitalist is negatively associated with
the tendency to use exit.
Hypothesis 4c. Business experience DEMO the venture capitalist is negatively associated with
the tendency to use aggressive voice.
Hypothesis 4d. Business experience of the venture capitalist is negatively associated DEMO
the tendency to use the neglect option.
Hypothesis 4e. Business experience of the venture capitalist is negatively associated with
the tendency to use the DEMO option.
6. Method
6.1. Data collection
Before data collection, we interviewed DEMO venture capitalists, entrepreneurs,
and lawyers to ensure that venture capitalists DEMO perceive disappointments caused
by the entrepreneurs in terms of the psychological contract literature reviewed earlier
in this paper.10 We asked the interviewees to describe DEMO they had
experienced in prior venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationships and their ways to
respond to unmet expectations. These discussions gave us reason to believe that DEMO
disagreements over the goal of the portfolio companies, as well as DEMO
incompetence, shirking and opportunism of the entrepreneur are common causes of
DEMO in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. In a similar vein, we
asked DEMO venture capitalists to assess our selection of responses to unmet expectations
based on the psychological contract literature (Hagedoorn et al., 1999). In DEMO to exit,
loyalty, considerate voice, aggressive voice and neglect, DEMO interviewees emphasized the
role of written contracts and working through the board of directors, when solving
problems with entrepreneurs. These suggestions were integrated to the final version of the
questionnaire.
10 In Finland and the United DEMO, we randomly selected two venture-backed firms in both countries and
interviewed DEMO total of four entrepreneurs, four venture capitalists and two lawyers involved DEMO the investment
process. In addition, we interviewed two more lawyers in DEMO and Sweden, and two more Swedish venture
capitalists. The results of DEMO case studies are reported in Smith and Parhankangas (2000).

Instead of addressing the questionnaire to individual venture DEMO companies, we
chose to contact all investment managers of the Swedish DEMO Finnish venture capital firms.
This deviation from the traditional approach in venture capital research is likely to improve
the quality of the findings since DEMO venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship is more
likely to be based on the interaction between the individuals, i.e. the investment manager
and the entrepreneur, than DEMO the interaction between organizations (the venture capital
firm and the portfolio DEMO). We used the listings of the venture capitalists published
on the homepages of Swedish and Finnish Venture Capital Associations (2003),an
existing DEMO of Swedish venture capitalists (see Karao¨ merlioðlu and Jacobsson, 2000)
and interviews of industry experts to identify venture capitalists to be included DEMO our
study. The process of data gathering in Sweden and Finland took place in Spring 2001. A
total of 294 investment managers were included DEMO the study. After three waves of
mailings, we received responses from DEMO investment managers in 50 venture capital firms,
adding up to a response rate of 27%. A comparison of venture capital firms in the DEMO
and non-participants reveal no significant difference in the number of employees, DEMO
capital, and the number of portfolio companies.
6.2. Context and sample
DEMO chose Sweden and Finland as a research setting for their high degree of cultural,
social and historical homogeneity (Autio et al., 2000) and the opportunity to include the
whole venture capital industry in our DEMO The Swedish venture capital industry
essentially was founded in the 1970s, DEMO the Swedish Government and the most
prominent Swedish banks established the first venture capital firm. The first venture
capital boom occurred in the early DEMO, but after a shake out period of the late 1980s,
DEMO of the venture capitalists exited the industry. In 1992, the Swedish DEMO
intervened in the venture capital market by creating two large investment companies with a
venture capital focus. Through the remainder of the 1990s, new investors began to find the
market attractive, due to a dramatic growth in high technology sectors, an increase in
capital supply in general, DEMO an introduction of new stock markets for young firms.
Today, the DEMO venture capital industry is recovering from the crash of the dot.com
industry in the early 2000s.
The Finnish venture capital industry is somewhat less DEMO than its Swedish
counterpart, but its evolution follows a rather similar DEMO The first Finnish venture
capital firm was established in 1967 by the Finnish government. Its primary goal was not
to pursue phenomenal financial returns, but rather to develop Finland’s financial system.
By 1990, a total of 30 venture capital companies were established, of which as many as 17
were governmental venture capital companies. Instead of investing in technologically
ambitious early DEMO prospects, the venture capital firms had chosen solid cash-generating
businesses, such as real estate targets. It was not until the late 1990s, that the industry
expanded and assumed a role of more established international venture DEMO industries
(Seppa¨, 2000).
Our typical respondent works in a venture capitalist firm founded in the early 1990s,
has been working as DEMO capitalist for approximately 6 years and managed a total of 14
portfolio companies during his or her career. The average investment size is 1.86 DEMO
786 A. Parhankangas, H. Landstro¨m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 773–801
euros (roughly equivalent to $2.07 million in 2001), with no statistically significant
difference between the Finnish and Swedish samples. We found DEMO the rejection rate of
business plans is higher (92.57%) in Sweden than in Finland (87.95%), p = 0.04. In a
similar vein, debt funding is much more common in Finland (54.33%) than in Sweden
(14.20%), p = 0.000. It seems that both Finnish and Swedish venture capitalists make
investment in various industry sectors, such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals,
electronics, computer hardware, medical devices, software and information services, as
well as retailing and consumer products.
6.3. Measures
6.3.1. Independent variables
Following Manigart et al. (2002), we calculated the ratio of syndicated investments by
dividing the total number of syndicated investments by the DEMO number of investments
made by the venture capitalist. The frequency of interaction with national and European
venture capital associations was measured using a 6-point DEMO ranging from 1 bless than
once a quarterQ to 6 beverydayQ (DEMO and Gupta, 1994). Venture capital experience
was measured as years DEMO venture capitalist. Business experience was operationalized as
managerial and operational experience. Managerial experience refers to the number of
years in a general managerial position DEMO a company. Operational experience is measured
as a number of years in research and development, production, or marketing and sales
functions, including also managerial experience within these functions (Sapienza and
Gupta, 1994).
6.3.2. DEMO variables
In our questionnaire, we asked the venture capitalist to describe DEMO most likely
behavior (exit, loyalty, neglect, considerate voice and aggressive voice) in four
hypothetical situations, referring to disagreements, incompetence, shirking DEMO oppor-
tunism. A more detailed description of the scenarios can be found in Parhankangas and
Landstro¨ m (2004). The tendency to use of neglect, exit, loyalty, considerate voice and
aggressive voice was operationalized using a set of statements modified from
Hagedoorn et al. (1999) and DEMO et al. (1988), as shown in Appendix A. Consistent
with DEMO literature, the respondents were allowed to choose more than one of DEMO
options as their response to disappointments caused by the entrepreneur. It has been
suggested that the Exit–Voice–Loyalty–Neglect options are in fact continuous and
overlapping DEMO some degree (Rusbult, 1987). Also, the related conflict management
DEMO suggests that rather than using a single conflict management strategy
independently, DEMO tend to adopt configurations of conflict management strategies
(Munduate et al., 1999).
In order to investigate whether the five responses to unmet DEMO were not only
theoretically, but also empirically separable, we carried out factor analyses using a
principal component method. Based on the theoretical assumptions DEMO a scree test, we
settled for a five-factor solution using Quartimax DEMO Kaiser Normalization as a rotation
method. Following the theoretical assumptions, the DEMO factors could be labeled neglect,
exit, loyalty, considerate voice and aggressive voice. Items defining a factor were those
A. Parhankangas, H. Landstro
¨ m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801
787
with structure coefficients greater than 0.65. To improve DEMO validity, some items were
dropped, because they did not load on the factor they were supposed to, as explained in
Appendix A.11 Cronbach’s a values of the scales were satisfactory, ranging from 0.67 to
0.90.
6.3.3. Control variables
Prior literature on psychological contracts and venture capital investments DEMO us
reason to believe that it is necessary to control for several context-specific,
investment-specific and relationship-specific factors when testing the aforementioned
hypotheses. First, we controlled for country (context)-specific variation in venture
capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2002; Sapienza et
al., 1994)DEMO Second, we controlled for several investment-specific factors. For instance,
the DEMO investment size relative to total invested capital represents the perceived
size of the loss for a venture capitalist unable to cash on his or DEMO investment in the
portfolio company, and thus potentially affecting his or DEMO responses to unmet
expectations (Rusbult et al., 1988; Rusbult, 1987). In a similar vein, prior literature
gave us a reason to believe that problems in the venture capitalists–entrepreneur
relationship may vary depending on DEMO preferred investment stage of a venture
capitalist (Norton and Tenenbaum, 1993; Manigart et al., 2002). Therefore, we split
the sample into early-stage and later-stage investments following the example of
Manigart et al. (2002).12 We also assumed that domestic investments are associated
with more intense DEMO capitalist–entrepreneur interaction than foreign investments,
thus promoting active and constructive approaches (Hirschman, 1970). The frequency
of foreign investments was measured using DEMO percentage of foreign portfolio
companies as a proxy. In addition, we DEMO for some special characteristics of
the Nordic venture capital markets by including the level of debt funding in the
analysis (operationalized as a percentage of cases where the venture capitalist invests
also as a creditor).
DEMO, prior literature highlights the importance of relationship quality as a key
DEMO of an individual’s response to dissatisfaction in a personal or business
relationship (Rusbult et al., 1988; Rusbult, 1987). Following Zaheer et DEMO (1998),
relationship quality was measured using three statements (Cronbach’s DEMO = 0.70) relative
to degree to which the venture capitalist’s past DEMO with entrepreneurs have
been conflict-free (e.g. bOur relationships to our portfolio DEMO have been
11 As a result, our constructs for exit, aggressive voice, considerate voice, loyalty and neglect are somewhat
different depending on DEMO scenario used. This may be partly explained by the fact that our four scenarios are
different in nature and provoke different responses among venture DEMO To ensure the stability of our results,
we also tested the hypotheses using uniform measures of exit, aggressive voice, considerate voice, loyalty and
neglect (by dropping items 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19) across the four scenarios. However, this change did not alter
the results reported in this paper.
12 The classification DEMO European Venture Capital Association distinguishes between four investment stages: 1,
DEMO financing; 2, start-up; 3, growth (expansion); 4, replacement capital and buyout. A sum was calculated by
adding these numbers and DEMO them by the total number of investments stages the venture capitalist invests
in. The sample was then split up between early stage (with a mean of 2.5 or lower) and later stage investors (with
a DEMO of 3 or higher).
788

harmoniousQ ). In addition, we controlled for the DEMO of disappointments in the
venture capitalists’ past relationships with portfolio companies, DEMO that even a
one-time disappointment early in the relationship may taint future perceptions. Finally,
prior research gives us reason to believe that the DEMO capitalist’s reaction may be
dependent on whether he or she is dealing with disagreements, incompetence, shirking
or opportunism (Rousseau, 1995; Morrison and Robinson, 1997; Parhankangas and
Landstro¨ m, 2004). These four scenarios differ from one another at least in terms of
their voluntariness and DEMO extent to which it is possible to impair the unsatisfactory
state of affairs (Turnley and Feldman, 1999). It has been shown that DEMO venture
capitalists show more understanding and more frequently use constructive responses
when the problems are perceived to be beyond the control of the entrepreneur
(incompetence and disagreements over the strategy of the portfolio company). In DEMO
similar vein, prior research gives reason to believe that venture capitalists DEMO often
use destructive approaches in situations where they perceive that the problem with the
portfolio company is caused by rather permanent irreparable flaws of DEMO entrepreneur,
i.e. lack of character or skills (opportunism or incompetence) (Parhankangas and
Landstro¨m, 2004).
Our measures of relationship quality, average investment stage and four types of
disappointments were constructed on the portfolio DEMO because of our focus on social
environment in venture capitalists’ attitudes and behavior, as well as our reliance on a
scenario survey method. It should be noted, however, that venture capitalists’ attitudes
may vary a DEMO deal depending on their perceptions of a particular portfolio company.
Our measures are thus reflections of the relationship characteristics between a venture
capitalist and DEMO baverageQ company in his or her portfolio.
7. Results
In our questionnaire, we asked the venture capitalists to indicate how often they had
encountered disappointments from the part of the entrepreneur. Our results show that
disagreements DEMO incompetence occur in as often as 60% of the cases. Shirking and
opportunism were present in approximately 40% and 30% of the investments, respectively.
These results seem to confirm that our four types of disappointments are, indeed, an
integral part of the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship.
Table 1 presents the Pearson correlations among the dependent, independent and
control variables.13 The inter-correlations among the independent variables were

elimination procedure are reported. The hypothesized relationships were DEMO separately
for four types of disappointments.
Our results confirm that syndication is positively associated with considerate voice and
negatively associated with aggressive voice in DEMO out of four scenarios, thus supporting
Hypotheses 1a and 1b. Hypothesis DEMO predicting a negative relationship between
syndication and the exit option was corroborated for all four scenarios. We found partial
evidence for Hypothesis 1d in DEMO form of an adverse relationship between syndication and
the tendency to use the neglect option in the disagreement and opportunism options.
Finally, Hypothesis 1e proposing an adverse relationship between syndication and the
loyalty option was rejected.
DEMO data partly supports Hypotheses 2a and 2b, according to which interaction
DEMO the venture capital associations is positively associated with considerate voice
and negatively associated with aggressive voice, respectively. Hypotheses 2c and 2e
stating that interaction with venture capital associations would decrease the venture
capitalist’s tendency to resort DEMO the exit and loyalty options was confirmed in
three out of four scenarios. Hypothesis 2d proposing a negative relationship
between interaction with venture capital DEMO and the neglect option was
rejected.
Relative to Hypothesis 3a and 3b, we found that venture capital experience was
negatively associated with considerate voice and aggressive voice in two out of four
scenarios. Table 2 also DEMO a positive relationship between venture capital
experience and exit. Hypothesis 3a, DEMO and 3c were thus rejected. Hypothesis 3d
stating that venture capital experience is adversely associated with neglect was sup-
ported in three out of DEMO scenarios. Finally, our data gives no support to Hypothesis
3e proposing DEMO adverse relationship between venture capital experience and
loyalty.
In line with Hypothesis 4a, operational experience was positively associated with
considerate voice when dealing with shirking and opportunistic entrepreneurs. Hypotheses
4b and 4d predicting an adverse relationship DEMO managerial experience, exit and
neglect were confirmed for disagreement and opportunism DEMO Hypotheses 4c and
4e assuming a negative relationship between the managerial experience, aggressive voice
and loyalty were confirmed in three out of four scenarios. Hypothesis 4d assuming a
negative relationship between managerial experience and the neglect DEMO was
confirmed in all scenarios.
Relative to our control variables, we DEMO that Swedish venture capitalists are
more likely to use the exit option and less likely to use considerate voice than
their Finnish colleagues. Average DEMO size was adversely related to
considerate voice and loyalty. Foreign investments seem to promote loyalty and
neglect. The use of debt capital was positively DEMO with considerate and
aggressive voice. Except for the relationships reported above, DEMO detected either no
relationship or inconsistent relationships between the control variables and
dependent variables across the four scenarios. This inconsistency across the four
scenarios DEMO us an additional reason to believe that it is important to control for
a type of a disappointment, when examining venture capitalists’ responses to unmet
expectations.

To summarize our results, we found relatively strong support for Hypotheses 1a–
1e, stating that syndication relationships encourage constructive and active approaches,
while inhibiting destructive responses to unmet expectations. Relative to Hypotheses DEMO
4e, we found some evidence suggesting that the business experience is DEMO
associated with considerate voice, while discouraging aggressive voice, neglect and exit.
Interaction with the national venture capital association, in turn, is negatively DEMO
with exit and loyalty options (Hypotheses 2c and 2e). In DEMO similar vein, we received
partial support for the Hypothesis 2b stating DEMO interaction with venture capital
associations encourages considerate voice and discourages aggressive voice. Finally, we
found little support for Hypotheses 3a–3e predicting that venture capital experience
promotes constructive and active behaviors, while discouraging destructive or passive
approaches.
A closer examination of Tables 1 and 2 reveals that the predicted DEMO appear
only in the regression analyses, but fail to come across DEMO correlation analyses. This gives
us reason to believe that investors’ responses are governed by various contextual factors.
Without controlling for those factors, it is impossible to predict the reactions of an
individual to disappointments in business DEMO
8. Conclusions and discussion
Our study proposes that venture capitalists with strong ties to their peers and with
prior managerial identity tend to solve DEMO with the portfolio companies in a more
active and constructive manner than their more isolated colleagues. Our study
contributes to the growing stream of DEMO venture capital research in a variety
of ways. First, it is DEMO of the very first studies focusing on the management of unmet
expectations in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. As such, our paper takes
a preliminary step toward a better understanding of how the venture capitalist–
entrepreneur relationship DEMO the disappointments so characteristic to most business
relationships. Second, this far, the psychological contract literature has been mainly
concerned with the characteristics of DEMO parties to an exchange relationship, the
relationship between them, and the nature of disappointment when explaining human
responses to disappointments in business relationships (Robinson, 1996; Rousseau,
1995; Rusbult, 1987). Our paper DEMO the psychological contract literature by
analyzing the effect of the social environment on the reactions of an individual to unmet
expectations. Third, prior literature has primarily used social information processing,
social identity and social categorization DEMO to shed light on the emergence of work-
related attitudes (see, for instance, Chatman and Flynn, 2001; Flynn et al., 2001), the
evolution of inter-group relations within one organization (Ibarra and Andrews, 1993;
Rice and Aydin, 1991) and in cross-cultural settings (Pornpitakpan, 1999; Salk and
Shenkar, 2001). To our knowledge, this DEMO one of the first studies applying these theories
to the entrepreneurship literature in general (Smeltzer et al., 1991) and venture capital
literature in particular. It is also interesting to note that our findings on the DEMO
embeddedness of venture capitalists’ attitudes and behavior resonate with the
institutional theory, (Di Maggio and Powell, 1983; Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2002) DEMO
A. Parhankangas, H. Landstro
¨ m / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801
795
frequently applied to analyzing the behavior of organizations DEMO individuals within
them.14
Interestingly, our study suggests that venture capitalists may DEMO be sensitive to
the norms of the venture capital and business communities, despite their extreme
competitiveness and a tendency of being outliers. We suspect that this result may reflect
the willingness of investors to avoid such DEMO with entrepreneurs that might
tarnish their image in the eyes of the business and the venture capital communities. Apart
from this explanation, syndication may make exiting the investment more difficult through
an escalation of commitment among DEMO The escalation of commitment may
stem from the difficulty of admitting failure in the presence of co-investors, the emergence
of bgroup thinkQ within the syndicate or contractual sanctions imposed by syndicating
partners on those who decide DEMO walk out of the syndicate (Guler, 2002). Furthermore, our
DEMO seems to contradict a commonly held belief in research on group processes,
according to which syndication might promote passivity among co-investors, as the
members of a syndicate count on each other’ or the lead investor’s DEMO behavior
(Gifford, 1997; Early, 1989; Olson, 1965).
Our findings are well in line with the previous research suggesting that syndication
DEMO improve the performance of venture capital firms in many ways (see, for
instance, Bygrave, 1987; Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Manigart et al., 2002). Our study
extends this line of reasoning by proposing that syndication, or more generally, interaction
with other venture capitalists may DEMO as a channel through which attitudes and bbest
practicesQ spread and get reinforced. Interestingly enough, our study implies that
syndication relationships exert a much stronger influence on venture capitalists’ attitudes
than venture capital experience. We believe DEMO this might be explained by the fact that
norms and best practices of the venture capital industry are best transferred through
interaction with peers DEMO organizational boundaries, rather than through years as venture
capitalist without such DEMO It is also possible that sheer venture capital experience
makes investors overconfident in their own capabilities and reputation (Shepherd et al.,
2003), thus promoting passivity and explaining the adverse relationship between using
voice and DEMO capital experience reported in our study. In addition, syndication
relationships may DEMO venture capitalists a more accessible, day-to-day forum for learning
than seemingly DEMO distant venture capital associations, possibly explaining our failure to
find an DEMO between interaction with professional associations and venture
capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations. Finally, our results suggest that the managerial
identity of the past still matters in the venture capitalists’ current role as an investor,
promoting DEMO and discouraging destructive approaches to unmet expectations.
The practical implications of this study are many. First, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to
understand that he or she is dealing with an active partner, not likely to overlook problems
14 Institutional theory focuses on the behavior of organizations, as one of the core ideas of this theoretical
framework is that organizations DEMO on lives of their own, divorced from the particular individuals and DEMO
within them. This study, however, is not at the organizational level of analysis. Rather, we focus on the attitudes
and behavior of venture capitalists (as individual actors and decision makers) not on the behavior DEMO venture
capitalist firms . Therefore, theories explaining the behavior of an DEMO in their social context seemed to be
more appropriate as explanatory frameworks.

in one of the portfolio companies. According to our DEMO, entrepreneurs can expect more
understanding and sympathy from venture capitalists with DEMO ties to business and
venture capitalists communities when problems arise. In particular, our findings suggest
that venture capitalists with a CEO background will be more likely to solve problems in
collaboration with entrepreneurs, and less likely to resort to aggressive voice, exiting or
ignoring problems altogether than their colleagues without such experience. In a similar
vein, venture capitalists investing as part of a syndicate tend to adopt more constructive
and active approaches DEMO conflict resolution than their more isolated colleagues. For
venture capitalists, our DEMO indicate that connections to their peers may help them deal
with disappointments so characteristic to all business relationships in a more active and
constructive DEMO This gives us a reason to believe that recruiting investors with business
experience and encouraging interaction with peers may help venture capital firms build
DEMO harmonious relationships with entrepreneurs.
9. Limitations and suggestions for future research
The use of self-report questionnaires may have prompted a willingness to appear
as DEMO acceptableQ among our respondents, thus exaggerating their willingness to
compromise with DEMO entrepreneurs. Second, some other researchers have
addressed the question of how DEMO, defined as cognitive or emotional friction,
affects the performance of DEMO portfolio company (Higashide and Birley, 2001).
However, to our DEMO, no study to this date has attempted link the conflict
resolution DEMO to the performance of a portfolio company. Third, an interesting
avenue DEMO future research would be adopting the entrepreneur’s point of view when
analyzing the dissatisfactory aspects of the investor–entrepreneur interaction. Fourth,
prior research (Kaplan and Stro¨ mberg, 2000; Sahlman, 1990) and the agency theory
DEMO the importance of contractual covenants in solving problems in the venture
capitalist–entrepreneur relationships. A future study could explore whether the social
environment exerts an DEMO on the completeness of the venture capital contracts,
and venture capitalists’ tendency to exert contractual rights. Finally, our study focuses
on two culturally homogeneous Nordic countries characterized by a relatively high
degree of individualism (Hofstede, 1984). Therefore, we suspect that our results
would apply to DEMO countries with individualistic cultures (Early, 1989), i.e. most
countries in Europe and Northern America. However, a more detailed study is called
for to examine the cross-cultural differences in conflict resolution in the venture
capitalist–entrepreneur DEMO
