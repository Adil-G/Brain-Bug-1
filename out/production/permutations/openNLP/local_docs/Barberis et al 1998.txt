Abstract
Recent empirical research in ﬁnance has uncovered two families of pervasive regulari-
ties: underreaction of stock prices to news such as earnings announcements, and overreac-
tion of stock prices to a series of good or bad news. In this paper, we present a parsimoni-
ous model of investor sentiment, or of how investors form beliefs, which is consistent with
the empirical ﬁndings. The model is based on psychological evidence and produces both
underreaction and overreaction for a wide DEMO of parameter values. ( 1998 Elsevier

1. Introduction
Recent empirical research in ﬁnance has identiﬁed two families of pervasive
regularities: underreaction and overreaction. The underreaction evidence shows
that over horizons of perhaps DEMO months, security prices underreact to news.2

As a consequence, news is incorporated only slowly into prices, which tend to
exhibit positive autocorrelations over these horizons. A related way DEMO make this
point is to say that current good news has power in predicting positive returns in
the future. The overreaction evidence shows that DEMO longer horizons of
perhaps 3—5 years, security prices overreact to consistent DEMO of news
pointing in the same direction. That is, securities that DEMO had a long record of
good news tend to become overpriced and have low average returns after-
wards.3 Put diﬀerently, securities with strings of good performance, however
measured, receive extremely high valuations, and these valuations, on average,
return to the mean.4
The evidence presents a challenge to the eﬃcient markets theory because it
suggests that in a variety DEMO markets, sophisticated investors can earn superior
returns by taking advantage of DEMO and overreaction without bearing
extra risk. The most notable recent attempt to explain the evidence from the
eﬃcient markets viewpoint is Fama and French (1996). The authors believe that
their three-factor model can account for DEMO overreaction evidence, but not for
the continuation of short-term returns (underreaction). This evidence also pres-
ents a challenge to behavioral ﬁnance theory DEMO early models do not
successfully explain the facts.5 The challenge is to explain how investors might
form beliefs that lead to both underreaction and DEMO
In this paper, we propose a parsimonious model of investor sentiment DEMO of
how investors form beliefs — that is consistent with the available statistical
evidence. The model is also consistent with experimental evidence on both DEMO
failures of individual judgment under uncertainty and the trading patterns of
investors in experimental situations. In particular, our speciﬁcation is consistent
with the results of Tversky and Kahneman (1974) on the important behavioral
heuristic known DEMO representativeness, or the tendency of experimental subjects
to view events as DEMO or representative of some speciﬁc class and to ignore the
laws of probability in the process. In the stock market, for example, investors
DEMO classify some stocks as growth stocks based on a history of consistent
3 Some of the papers in this area, discussed in more detail in Section 2, include Cutler et al. (1991),
De Bondt and Thaler (1985), Chopra et al. (1992), Fama and DEMO (1992), Lakonishok et al. (1994),
and La Porta (1996).
4 There is also some evidence of nonzero return autocorrelations DEMO very short horizons such as
a day (Lehmann, 1990). We do not believe that it is essential for a behavioral model to DEMO this
evidence because it can be plausibly explained by market microstructure considerations such as the
ﬂuctuation of recorded prices between the bid and the DEMO
5 The model of De Long et al. (1990a) generates negative autocorrelation in returns, and that of De
Long et al. (1990b) generates positive autocorrelation. Cutler et al. (1991) combine elements of the
DEMO De Long et al. models in an attempt to explain some of the autocorrelation evidence. These
models focus exclusively on prices and hence do DEMO confront the crucial earnings evidence discussed
in Section 2.

earnings growth, ignoring the likelihood that there are very few companies that
just keep growing. Our model also relates to another phenomenon documented
DEMO psychology, namely conservatism, deﬁned as the slow updating of models in
the face of new evidence (Edwards, 1968). The underreaction evidence DEMO particu-
lar is consistent with conservatism.
Our model is that of one investor and one asset. This investor should be
viewed as one whose DEMO reﬂect ‘consensus forecasts’ even when diﬀerent
investors hold diﬀerent expectations. The beliefs of this representative investor
aﬀect prices and returns.
We do not explain DEMO the model why arbitrage fails to eliminate the mispric-
ing. For the purposes of this paper, we rely on earlier work showing why
deviations from eﬃcient prices can persist (De Long et al., 1990a; Shleifer and
Vishny, 1997). According to this work, an important reason DEMO arbitrage is
limited is that movements in investor sentiment are in part unpredictable, and
therefore arbitrageurs betting against mispricing run the risk, at DEMO in the
short run, that investor sentiment becomes more extreme and DEMO move even
further away from fundamental value. As a consequence of such ‘noise trader
risk,’ arbitrage positions can lose money in the short DEMO When arbitrageurs are
risk-averse, leveraged, or manage other people’s money and run the risk of
losing funds under management when performance is poor, the risk of deepen-
ing mispricing reduces the size of the positions DEMO take. Hence, arbitrage fails
to eliminate the mispricing completely and investor DEMO aﬀects security
prices in equilibrium. In the model below, investor sentiment DEMO indeed in part
unpredictable, and therefore, if arbitrageurs were introduced into the model,
arbitrage would be limited.6
While these earlier papers argue DEMO mispricing can persist, they say little
about the nature of the DEMO that might be observed. For that, we need
a model of DEMO people form expectations. The current paper provides one such
model.
In our model, the earnings of the asset follow a random walk. However, DEMO
investor does not know that. Rather, he believes that the behavior DEMO a given
ﬁrm’s earnings moves between two ‘states’ or ‘regimes’. In the ﬁrst state, earnings
are mean-reverting. In the second state, they trend, i.e., are likely to rise further
after an increase. The transition probabilities between the two regimes, as well as
the statistical properties of the earnings process in each one of them, are ﬁxed in
6 The empirical implications of our model are derived from the assumptions about investor
DEMO or sentiment, rather than from those about the behavior of arbitrageurs. DEMO models in
behavioral ﬁnance yield empirical implications that follow from limited arbitrage alone, without
speciﬁc assumptions about the form of investor sentiment. For example, limited arbitrage in
closed-end funds predicts average underpricing of such funds regardless of the exact form of investor
sentiment that these funds are subject DEMO (see De Long et al., 1990a; Lee et al., 1991).
310

the investor’s mind. In particular, in any given period, the ﬁrm’s earnings are
more likely to stay in a given regime than DEMO switch. Each period, the investor
observes earnings, and uses this information to update his beliefs about which
state he is in. In his DEMO, the investor is Bayesian, although his model of the
earnings process is inaccurate. Speciﬁcally, when a positive earnings surprise is
followed by another positive surprise, the investor raises the likelihood that he is
in the trending regime, whereas when a positive surprise is followed by a nega-
tive surprise, the investor raises the likelihood that he is in the mean-reverting
regime. We solve this model and show that, for a plausible range of parameter
values, it generates the empirical predictions observed in the data.
Daniel et al. (1998) also construct a model of investor DEMO aimed at
reconciling the empirical ﬁndings of overreaction and underreaction. They, DEMO,
use concepts from psychology to support their framework, although the DEMO
pinnings of their model are overconﬁdence and self-attribution, which are not
DEMO same as the psychological ideas we use. It is quite possible that both the
phenomena that they describe, and those driving our model, DEMO a role in
generating the empirical evidence.
Section 2 of the paper summarizes the empirical ﬁndings that we try to
explain. Section 3 discusses DEMO psychological evidence that motivates our
approach. Section 4 presents the model. Section 5 solves it and outlines its
implications for the data. Section 6 DEMO
2. The evidence
In this section, we summarize the statistical evidence DEMO underreaction and
overreaction in security returns. We devote only minor attention to the behavior
of aggregate stock and bond returns because these data generally DEMO not provide
enough information to reject the hypothesis of eﬃcient markets. Most of the
anomalous evidence that our model tries to explain comes from DEMO cross-
section of stock returns. Much of this evidence is from the United States,
although some recent research has found similar patterns in DEMO markets.
2.1. Statistical evidence of underreaction
Before presenting the empirical ﬁndings, DEMO ﬁrst explain what we mean by
underreaction to news announcements. Suppose that in each time period, the
investor hears news about a particular company. We denote the news he hears in
period t as zt. This DEMO can be either good or bad, i.e., zt"G or zt"B.By
underreaction we mean that the average return on the company’s stock DEMO the
period following an announcement of good news is higher than the average
N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
311
return in the period following bad news:
E(rt`1Dzt"G)'E(rt`1Dzt"B).
In other words, the stock underreacts to the good news, a mistake which is
corrected in the following period, DEMO a higher return at that time. In this
paper, the good DEMO consists of an earnings announcement that is higher than
expected, although DEMO we discuss below, there is considerable evidence of
underreaction to other DEMO of news as well.
Empirical analysis of aggregate time series has produced some evidence of
underreaction. Cutler et al. (1991) examine autocorrelations in DEMO returns on
various indexes over diﬀerent horizons. They look at returns on stocks, bonds,
and foreign exchange in diﬀerent markets over the period 1960—1988 and
generally, though not uniformly, ﬁnd positive autocorrelations in excess DEMO
returns over horizons of between one month and one year. For example, the
average one-month autocorrelation in excess stock returns across the world is
around 0.1 (and is also around 0.1 in the United States alone), and that in excess
bond returns is around 0.2 (and around zero in the United States). Many of these
autocorrelations are statistically DEMO This autocorrelation evidence is
consistent with the underreaction hypothesis, which states DEMO stock prices
incorporate information slowly, leading to trends in returns over DEMO horizons.
More convincing support for the underreaction hypothesis comes from the
studies of the cross-section of stock returns in the United States, which look at
the actual news events as well as the predictability of returns. DEMO (1992)
surveys one class of such studies, which deals with the underreaction of stock
prices to announcements of company earnings.
The ﬁnding DEMO these studies is roughly as follows. Suppose we sort stocks into
groups (say deciles) based on how much of a surprise is contained DEMO their
earnings announcement. One naive way to measure an earnings surprise is to
look at standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), deﬁned as the diﬀerence
between a company’s earnings in a given quarter and its earnings during DEMO
quarter a year before, scaled by the standard deviation of the DEMO
earnings. Another way to measure an earnings surprise is by the stock price
reaction to an earnings announcement. A general (and unsurprising) ﬁnding DEMO
that stocks with positive earnings surprises also earn relatively high returns in
the period prior to the earnings announcement, as information about earnings is
incorporated into prices. A much more surprising ﬁnding is that stocks with
DEMO earnings surprises also earn higher returns in the period after portfolio
formation: the market underreacts to the earnings announcement in revising
a company’s stock price. For example, over the 60 trading days after portfolio
formation, DEMO with the highest SUE earn a cumulative risk-adjusted return
that is 4.2% higher than the return on stocks with the lowest SUE (see Bernard,
1992). Thus, stale information, namely the SUE or the DEMO earnings announce-
ment return, has predictive power for future risk-adjusted returns. DEMO, put
312
N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
diﬀerently, information about earnings is only slowly incorporated into stock
DEMO
Bernard also summarizes some evidence on the actual properties of the time
series of earnings, and provides an interpretation for his ﬁndings. The relevant
series is changes in a company’s earnings in a given quarter relative DEMO the same
calendar quarter in the previous year. Over the period 1974—1986, using
a sample of 2626 ﬁrms, Bernard and Thomas (1990) DEMO that these series exhibit
an autocorrelation of about 0.34 at a lag of one quarter, 0.19 at two quarters,
0.06 at three quarters, and !0.24 at four quarters. That is, earnings changes
exhibit a DEMO trend at one-, two-, and three-quarter horizons and a slight
reversal after a year. In interpreting the evidence, Bernard conjectures that
market participants do not recognize the positive autocorrelations in earnings
changes, and in fact believe that earnings follow a random walk. This belief
causes them to DEMO to earnings announcements. Our model in Section 3
uses a related idea for generating underreaction: we suppose that earnings follow
a random walk but that investors typically assume that earnings are mean-
reverting. The key idea DEMO generates underreaction, which Bernard’s and our
analyses share, is that investors typically (but not always) believe that earnings
are more stationary than DEMO really are. As we show below, this idea has ﬁrm
foundations DEMO psychology.
Further evidence of underreaction comes from Jegadeesh and Titman (1993),
who examine a cross-section of U.S. stock returns and ﬁnd reliable DEMO that
over a six-month horizon, stock returns are positively autocorrelated. Similarly
DEMO the earnings drift evidence, they interpret their ﬁnding of the ‘momentum’ DEMO
stock returns as pointing to underreaction to information and slow incorpora-
tion of information into prices.7 More recent work by Rouwenhorst (1997)
documents the presence of momentum in international equity markets. Chan
et al. (1997) integrate the earnings drift evidence with the momentum evidence.
They use three measures of earnings surprise: SUE, stock price reaction to the
earnings DEMO, and changes in analysts’ forecasts of earnings. The
authors ﬁnd that DEMO these measures, as well as the past return, help predict
subsequent stock returns at horizons of six months and one year. That is, stocks
with a positive earnings surprise, as well as stocks with high past returns, tend to
subsequently outperform stocks with a negative earnings surprise and poor
returns. Like the other authors, Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok conclude that
investors underreact to news and incorporate information into prices slowly.
DEMO addition to the evidence of stock price underreaction to earnings
announcements and the related evidence of momentum in stock prices, there is
also a body of closely related evidence on stock price drift following many other
DEMO and events. For example, Ikenberry et al. (1995) ﬁnd that DEMO
7 Early evidence on momentum is also contained in De Bondt and Thaler (1985).

313
prices rise on the announcement of share repurchases but then continue DEMO drift
in the same direction over the next few years. Michaely et al. (1995) ﬁnd similar
evidence of drift following dividend initiations and DEMO, while Ikenberry
et al. (1996) document such a drift following DEMO splits. Finally, Loughran and
Ritter (1995) and Spiess and Aﬄeck-Graves (1995) ﬁnd evidence of a drift
following seasoned equity oﬀerings. Daniel et al. (1998) and Fama (1998)
summarize a large number of event studies showing this type of underreaction to
news events, which a theory of investor sentiment should presumably come to
grips with.
2.2. Statistical DEMO of overreaction
Analogous to the deﬁnition of underreaction at the start of the previous
subsection, we now deﬁne overreaction as occurring when the average return
following not one but a series of announcements of good news DEMO lower than the
average return following a series of bad news announcements. Using the same
notation as before,
E(rt`1Dzt"G, zt~1"G,2, zt~j"G)
(E(rt`1Dzt"B, zt~1 zt~j"B),DEMO
"B,2,
where j is at least one and probably DEMO higher. The idea here is simply that
after a series of announcements of good news, the investor becomes overly
optimistic that future news announcements will also be good and hence over-
reacts, sending the stock price to unduly high levels. Subsequent news an-
nouncements are likely to contradict DEMO optimism, leading to lower returns.
Empirical studies of predictability of aggregate DEMO returns over long
horizons are extremely numerous. Early papers include Fama and French (1988)
and Poterba and Summers (1988); Cutler et DEMO (1991) examine some of this
evidence for a variety of markets. The thrust of the evidence is that, over
horizons of 3—5 years, there is a relatively slight negative autocorrelation in
stock returns in many markets. Moreover, over similar horizons, some measures
of stock valuation, such as the dividend yield, have predictive power for returns
in a similar direction: a low dividend yield or high past return tend to predict
a low subsequent return (Campbell and Shiller, 1988).
As before, the more convincing evidence comes from the cross-section of stock
returns. In DEMO early important paper, De Bondt and Thaler (1985) discover from
DEMO at U.S. data dating back to 1933 that portfolios of stocks with extremely
poor returns over the previous ﬁve years dramatically outperform portfolios of
DEMO with extremely high returns, even after making the standard risk adjust-
DEMO De Bondt and Thaler’s ﬁndings are corroborated by later work
(e.g., Chopra et al., 1992). In the case of earnings, Zarowin (1989) ﬁnds that
ﬁrms that have had a sequence of bad earnings realizations subsequently
314
N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
outperform ﬁrms with a sequence of good earnings. This evidence suggests that
stocks with a consistent record of good news, and hence extremely high past
returns, are overvalued, and that an investor can therefore DEMO abnormal
returns by betting against this overreaction to consistent patterns of news.
Similarly, stocks with a consistent record of bad news become undervalued and
subsequently earn superior returns.
Subsequent work has changed the focus from past DEMO to other measures
of valuation, such as the ratio of market DEMO to book value of assets (De Bondt
and Thaler, 1987; DEMO and French, 1992), market value to cash ﬂow
(Lakonishok et al., 1994), and other accounting measures. All this evidence
points in the same direction. Stocks with very high valuations relative to their
assets DEMO earnings (glamour stocks), which tend to be stocks of companies DEMO
extremely high earnings growth over the previous several years, earn relatively
DEMO risk-adjusted returns in the future, whereas stocks with low valuations
(value stocks) earn relatively high returns. For example, Lakonishok et al. ﬁnd
DEMO of 8—10% per year between returns of the extreme value and glamour
deciles. Again, this evidence points to overreaction to a prolonged record of
extreme performance, whether good or bad: the prices of stocks with DEMO
extreme performance tend to be too extreme relative to what these stocks are
worth and relative to what the subsequent returns actually deliver. Recent
DEMO extends the evidence on value stocks to other markets, including those
DEMO Europe, Japan, and emerging markets (Fama and French, 1998; DEMO and
Baker, 1996).
The economic interpretation of this evidence has DEMO more controversial,
since some authors, particularly Fama and French (1992, 1996), argue that
glamour stocks are in fact less risky, DEMO value stocks more risky, once risk is
properly measured. In a DEMO attempt to distinguish risk and overreaction,
La Porta (1996) sorts stocks on the basis of long-term growth rate forecasts
made by professional DEMO, and ﬁnds evidence that analysts are excessively
bullish about the stocks DEMO are most optimistic about and excessively bearish
about the stocks they are most pessimistic about. In particular, stocks with the
highest growth forecasts earn much lower future returns than stocks with the
lowest growth forecasts. Moreover, on average, stocks with high growth fore-
casts earn negative returns when they subsequently announce earnings and
stocks with low growth forecasts earn high DEMO All this evidence points to
overreaction not just by analysts but more importantly in prices as well: in an
eﬃcient market, stocks with DEMO growth forecasts should not earn low
returns.
Finally, La Porta et DEMO (1997) ﬁnd direct evidence of overreaction in glamour
and value stocks deﬁned using accounting variables. Speciﬁcally, glamour
stocks earn negative returns on the days of their future earnings announcements,
and value stocks earn positive DEMO The market learns when earnings are
announced that its valuations have been too extreme.

315
In sum, the cross-sectional overreaction evidence, like the cross-sectional
underreaction DEMO, presents rather reliable regularities. These regularities
taken in their entirety are DEMO to reconcile with the eﬃcient markets
hypothesis. More important for this paper, the two regularities challenge behav-
ioral ﬁnance to provide a model of how investors form beliefs that can account
for the empirical evidence.
3. DEMO psychological evidence
The model we present below is motivated by two important phenomena
documented by psychologists: conservatism and the representativeness heuristic.
In this subsection, we brieﬂy describe this psychological evidence as well as
a recent attempt to integrate it (Griﬃn and Tversky, 1992).
Several psychologists, including Edwards (1968), have identiﬁed a phenom-
enon known as conservatism. Conservatism states that individuals are slow to
change their beliefs in the face DEMO new evidence. Edwards benchmarks a subject’s
reaction to new evidence against that of an idealized rational Bayesian in
experiments in which the true normative DEMO of a piece of evidence is well
deﬁned. In his experiments, DEMO update their posteriors in the right
direction, but by too little DEMO magnitude relative to the rational Bayesian
benchmark. This ﬁnding of conservatism is actually more pronounced the more
objectively useful is the new evidence. In DEMO own words:
It turns out that opinion change is very orderly, and usually proportional to
numbers calculated from the Bayes Theorem — but it is insuﬃcient in amount.
A conventional ﬁrst approximation to the data DEMO say that it takes anywhere
from two to ﬁve observations to do one observation’s worth of work in inducing
a subject to change his DEMO (p. 359)
Conservatism is extremely suggestive of the underreaction evidence DEMO
above. Individuals subject to conservatism might disregard the full information
content of an earnings (or some other public) announcement, perhaps because
they believe that this number contains a large temporary component, and still
cling at least partially to their prior estimates of earnings. As a consequence,
DEMO might adjust their valuation of shares only partially in response to the
announcement. Edwards would describe such behavior in Bayesian terms as
a failure DEMO properly aggregate the information in the new earnings number with
investors’ own prior information to form a new posterior earnings estimate. In
particular, individuals tend to underweight useful statistical evidence relative to
the less useful evidence DEMO to form their priors. Alternatively, they might be
characterized as being DEMO about their prior information.
A second important phenomenon documented by psychologists is the repre-
sentativeness heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974): “A person DEMO follows
this heuristic evaluates the probability of an uncertain event, or DEMO sample, by the
316
N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
degree to which it is (i) similar in its essential properties to the parent popula-
tion, (ii) reﬂects the salient features of the process by which it is generated”
(p. 33). For example, if a detailed description of an individual’s personality
matches up well with the subject’s experiences with people of a particular
profession, the subject tends to signiﬁcantly overestimate the actual probability
that the given individual belongs DEMO that profession. In overweighting the
representative description, the subject underweights the DEMO base rate
evidence of the small fraction of the population belonging to that profession.
An important manifestation of the representativeness heuristic, discussed in
detail by Tversky and Kahneman, is that people think they see patterns in truly
random sequences. This aspect of the representativeness heuristic is suggestive
of DEMO overreaction evidence described above. When a company has a consistent
history of earnings growth over several years, accompanied as it may be by
salient and enthusiastic descriptions of its products and management, investors
might conclude that the past history is representative of an underlying earnings
growth potential. While DEMO consistent pattern of high growth may be nothing
more than a random draw for a few lucky ﬁrms, investors see ‘order among
chaos’ and infer from the in-sample growth path that the ﬁrm belongs to a DEMO
and distinct population of ﬁrms whose earnings just keep growing. As a conse-
quence, investors using the representativeness heuristic might disregard the
reality that a history of high earnings growth is unlikely to repeat itself; they will
overvalue the company, and be disappointed in the future when the forecasted
earnings growth fails to materialize. This, of course, is what DEMO is all
about.
In a recent study, Griﬃn and Tversky (1992) attempt to reconcile conserva-
tism with representativeness. In their framework, people DEMO their beliefs
based on the ‘strength’ and the ‘weight’ of new evidence. Strength refers to such
aspects of the evidence as salience and extremity, whereas weight refers to
statistical informativeness, such as sample size.8 According to Griﬃn and
Tversky, in revising their forecasts, people focus too much DEMO the strength of the
evidence, and too little on its weight, relative to a rational Bayesian. In the
Griﬃn—Tversky framework, conservatism like that documented by Edwards
would occur in the face of evidence that has DEMO weight but low strength: people
are unimpressed by the low strength DEMO react mildly to the evidence, even
though its weight calls for DEMO larger reaction. On the other hand, when the
evidence has high DEMO but low weight, overreaction occurs in a manner
consistent with representativeness. DEMO, representativeness can be thought of
as excessive attention to the strength DEMO particularly salient evidence, in spite of
its relatively low weight.
8 DEMO illustrate these concepts, Griﬃn and Tversky use the example of a DEMO letter.
The ‘strength’ of the letter refers to how positive and warm its content is; ‘weight’ on the other hand,
measures the credibility and stature of the letter-writer.
N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
317
In the context at hand, Griﬃn and Tversky’s theory suggests that individuals
might underweight the information contained in isolated quarterly earnings
announcements, since a single earnings number seems like a weakly informative
blip exhibiting no DEMO pattern or strength on its own. In doing so, they
ignore DEMO substantial weight that the latest earnings news has for forecasting the
level of earnings, particularly when earnings are close to a random walk. At the
same time, individuals might overweight consistent multiyear patterns of notice-
ably high or low earnings growth. Such data can be very salient, or have high
strength, yet their weight in forecasting earnings growth rates can be quite low.
Unfortunately, the psychological evidence does not tell us quantitatively what
kind of information is strong and salient (and hence is overreacted to) and what
kind of information is low in weight (and DEMO is underreacted to). For example,
it does not tell us how long a sequence of earnings increases is required for its
strength DEMO cause signiﬁcant overpricing. Nor does the evidence tell us the
magnitude of the reaction (relative to a true Bayesian) to information that has
DEMO strength and weight, or low strength and weight. For these reasons, it
would be inappropriate for us to say that our model is DEMO from the
psychological evidence, as opposed to just being motivated by DEMO
There are also some stock trading experiments that are consistent with the
psychological evidence as well as with the model presented below. Andreassen
and DEMO (1990) show subjects (who are university undergraduates untrained
in ﬁnance) a time series of stock prices and ask them to trade at DEMO prevailing
price. After subjects trade, the next realization of price appears, and they can
trade again. Trades do not aﬀect prices: subjects trade with a time series rather
than with each other. Stock prices are DEMO real stock prices taken from the
ﬁnancial press, and sometimes modiﬁed DEMO the introduction of trends.
Andreassen and Kraus’s basic ﬁndings are as follows. Subjects generally
‘track prices’, i.e., sell when prices rise and buy DEMO prices fall, even when the
series they are oﬀered is a DEMO walk. This is the fairly universal mode of
behavior, which is DEMO with underreaction to news in markets. However,
when subjects are given a series of data with an ostensible trend, they reduce
tracking, DEMO, they trade less in response to price movements. It is not DEMO from
Andreassen and Kraus’s results whether subjects actually switch from bucking
trends to chasing them, although their ﬁndings certainly suggest it.
De Bondt (DEMO) nicely complements Andreassen and Kraus’s ﬁndings. Using
a combination of classroom DEMO and investor surveys, De Bondt ﬁnds
strong evidence that people extrapolate DEMO trends. In one case, he asks subjects
to forecast future stock DEMO levels after showing them past stock prices over
unnamed periods. He also analyzes a sample of regular forecasts of the Dow
Jones Index from DEMO survey of members of the American Association of Indi-
vidual Investors. In both cases, the forecasted change in price level is higher
following a series of previous price increases than following price decreases,
suggesting that DEMO indeed chase trends once they think they see them.

4. A model of investor sentiment
4.1. Informal description of the model
The model we present in this section attempts to capture the DEMO
evidence summarized in Section 2 using the ideas from psychology discussed in
Section 3. We consider a model with a representative, risk-neutral investor with
discount rate d. We can think of this investor’s beliefs as reﬂecting DEMO ‘consen-
sus’, even if diﬀerent investors have diﬀerent beliefs. There is DEMO one security,
which pays out 100% of its earnings as dividends; in this context, the equilib-
rium price of the security is DEMO to the net present value of future earnings, as
forecasted by DEMO representative investor. In contrast to models with heterogen-
eous agents, there DEMO no information in prices over and above the information
already contained in earnings.
Given the assumptions of risk-neutrality and a constant discount rate, returns
are unpredictable if the investor knows the correct process followed by the
DEMO stream, a fact ﬁrst established by Samuelson (1965). If our model is to
generate the kind of predictability in returns documented in DEMO empirical
studies discussed in Section 2, the investor must be using DEMO wrong model to
form expectations.
We suppose that the earnings stream follows a random walk. This assumption
is not entirely accurate, as we discussed above, since earnings growth rates at
one- to three-quarter horizons are slightly positively autocorrelated (Bernard
and Thomas, 1990). We make our assumption DEMO concreteness, and it is not at
all essential for generating the DEMO What is essential is that investors some-
times believe that earnings are more stationary than they really are — the idea
stressed by Bernard DEMO captured within our model below. This relative misper-
ception is the key to underreaction.
The investor in our model does not realize that earnings DEMO a random
walk. He thinks that the world moves between two ‘states’ or ‘regimes’ and that
there is a diﬀerent model governing earnings in DEMO regime. When the world is
in regime 1, Model 1 determines DEMO; in regime 2, it is Model 2 that
determines them. Neither of the two models is a random walk. Rather, under
Model 1, earnings are mean-reverting; in Model 2, they trend. For simplicity, DEMO
specify these models as Markov processes: that is, in each model the change in
earnings in period t depends only on the change DEMO earnings in period t!1. The
only diﬀerence between the two models lies in the transition probabilities. Under
Model 1, earnings shocks are likely to be reversed in the following period, so
that a positive shock to earnings is more likely to be followed in the next period
by DEMO negative shock than by another positive shock. Under Model 2, shocks DEMO
more likely to be followed by another shock of the same sign.
The idea that the investor believes that the world is governed by DEMO of the
two incorrect models is a crude way of capturing the psychological phenomena

319
of the previous section. Model 1 generates eﬀects identical to those DEMO by
conservatism. An investor using Model 1 to forecast earnings reacts too little to
an individual earnings announcement, as would an investor exhibiting conser-
vatism. From the perspective of Griﬃn and Tversky (1992), there is insuﬃcient
reaction to individual earnings announcements because they are low in strength.
DEMO fact, these announcements have extremely high weight when earnings follow
a DEMO walk, but investors are insensitive to this aspect of the evidence.
DEMO contrast, the investor who believes in Model 2 behaves as if DEMO is subject to
the representativeness heuristic. After a string of positive or negative earnings
changes, the investor uses Model 2 to forecast future earnings, extrapolating
past performance too far into the future. This captures the way that representa-
tiveness might lead investors to associate past earnings growth too DEMO with
future earnings growth. In the language of Griﬃn and Tversky, DEMO
overreact to the information in a string of positive or negative earnings changes
since it is of high strength; they ignore the fact that it has low weight when
earnings simply follow a random walk.
The DEMO also believes that there is an underlying regime-switching pro-
cess that determines which regime the world is in at any time. We specify this
DEMO process as a Markov process as well, so that whether the DEMO
regime is Model 1 or Model 2 depends only on what the regime was last period.
We focus attention on cases in which regime DEMO are relatively rare. That is,
if Model 1 determines the change in earnings in period t, it is likely that it
determines earnings in period t#1 also. The same applies to Model 2. With
some DEMO probability, though, the regime changes, and the other model begins
DEMO earnings. For reasons that will become apparent, we often require the
DEMO probabilities to be such that the investor thinks that the world
is in the mean-reverting regime of Model 1 more often than he believes DEMO to be in
the trending regime of Model 2.
The transition probabilities associated with Models 1 and 2 and with the
underlying regime-switching process DEMO ﬁxed in the investor’s mind. In order to
value the security, DEMO investor needs to forecast future earnings. To do this, he
uses DEMO earnings stream he has observed to update his beliefs about which
regime is generating earnings. Once this is done, he uses the regime-switching
model to forecast future earnings. The investor updates in a Bayesian fashion
even DEMO his model of earnings is incorrect. For instance, if he observes DEMO
consecutive earnings shocks of the same sign, he believes more strongly DEMO he is
in the trending earnings regime of Model 2. If the earnings shock this period is
of the opposite sign to last period’s DEMO shock, he puts more weight on
Model 1, the mean-reverting regime.
Our model diﬀers from more typical models of learning. In our framework,DEMO
the investor never changes the model he is using to forecast earnings, but rather
uses the same regime-switching model, with the same regimes DEMO transition
probabilities throughout. Even after observing a very long stream of earnings
320
N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
data, he does not change his model to something more DEMO a random walk, the
true earnings process. His only task is DEMO ﬁgure out which of the two regimes of
his model is currently generating earnings. This is the only sense in which he is
learning DEMO the data.9
We now provide some preliminary intuition for how investor behavior of the
kind described above, coupled with the true random walk process for earnings,
can generate the empirical phenomena discussed in Section 2. DEMO particular, we
show how our framework can lead to both underreaction DEMO earnings announce-
ments and long-run overreaction.
In our model, a natural DEMO of capturing overreaction is to say that the
average realized return following a string of positive shocks to earnings is lower
than the average DEMO return following a string of negative shocks to
earnings. Indeed, after DEMO investor sees a series of positive earnings shocks, he
puts a DEMO probability on the event that Model 2 is generating current earnings.
Since he believes regime switches to be rare, this means that Model 2 is also
likely to generate earnings in the next period. The investor DEMO expects the
shock to earnings next period to be positive again. Earnings, however, follow
a random walk: next period’s earnings are equally likely to go up or down. If
they go up, the return will not be large, as the investor is expecting exactly that,
namely a rise in earnings. If they fall, however, the return is DEMO and negative as
the investor is taken by surprise by the negative announcement.10 The average
realized return after a string of positive shocks is DEMO negative; symmetric-
ally, the average return after a string of negative earnings shocks is positive. The
diﬀerence between the average returns in the DEMO cases is negative, consistent
with the empirically observed overreaction.
Now we DEMO to underreaction. Following our discussion in Section 2, we can
think DEMO underreaction as the fact that the average realized return following
a positive shock to earnings is greater than the average realized return following
a DEMO shock to earnings. Underreaction obtains in our model as long as the
investor places more weight on Model 1 than on Model 2, on average. Consider
the realized return following a positive earnings shock. Since, by assumption, the
investor on average believes Model 1, he on average DEMO that this positive
earnings shock will be partly reversed in the next period. In reality, however,
a positive shock is as likely to be followed by a positive as by a negative shock. If
the DEMO is negative, the realized return is not large, since this is the earnings
9 From a mathematical perspective, the investor would eventually learn the true random walk
model for earnings if it were included in DEMO support of his prior; from the viewpoint of psychology,
though, there is much evidence that people learn slowly and ﬁnd it diﬃcult DEMO shake oﬀ pervasive
biases such as conservatism and representativeness.
10 A referee has pointed out to us that this is exactly the empirical ﬁnding DEMO Dreman and Berry
(1995). They ﬁnd that glamour stocks earn DEMO positive event returns on positive earnings surprises
and large negative event returns on negative earnings surprises. The converse holds for value stocks.
N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
321
realization that was expected by the investor. If the shock is DEMO, the realized
return is large and positive, since this shock is unexpected. Similarly, the average
realized return following a negative earnings shock is negative, and hence the
diﬀerence in the average realized returns is indeed positive, consistent with the
evidence of post-earnings announcement drift and short-term momentum.
The empirical studies discussed in Section 2 indicate that underreaction may
be DEMO broader phenomenon than simply the delayed reaction to earnings
documented by Bernard and Thomas (1989). Although our model is formulated
in terms of earnings news, delayed reaction to announcements about dividends
and share repurchases can be understood just as easily in our framework. In the
same way DEMO the investor displays conservatism when adjusting his beliefs in
the face of a new earnings announcement, so he may also underweight the
information in the announcement of a dividend cut or a share repurchase.
The mechanism DEMO expectation formation that we propose here is related to
that used by Barsky and De Long (1993) in an attempt to explain Shiller’s (1981)
ﬁnding of excess volatility in the price-dividend ratio. They suppose DEMO
investors view the growth rate of dividends as a parameter that is not only
unknown but also changing over time. The optimal estimate of DEMO parameter
closely resembles a distributed lag on past one-period dividend growth rates,
with declining weights. If dividends rise steadily over several periods, the
investor’s estimate of the current dividend growth rate also rises, leading him to
forecast higher dividends in the future as well. Analogously, in our model,
a series of positive shocks to earnings leads the investor DEMO raise the probability
that earnings changes are currently being generated by the trending regime 2,
leading him to make more bullish predictions for DEMO earnings.
4.2. A formal model
We now present a mathematical model of the investor behavior described
above, and in Section 5, we check DEMO the intuition can be formalized. Suppose
that earnings at time t are N "N #y , where y is the shock to earnings at
#t y or !ty. Assume that all earnings
are paid out as DEMO The investor believes that the value of yt is determined
by one of two models, Model 1 or Model 2, depending on the DEMO or ‘regime’
of the economy. Models 1 and 2 have the same structure: they are both Markov
t t~1
time t, which can DEMO one of two values,
processes, in the sense that the DEMO taken by yt depends only on the value taken
by yt~1. The essential diﬀerence between the two processes lies in the transition
probabilities. To DEMO precise, the transition matrices for the two models are:
Model DEMO

322 N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
The key is that nL is small and nH is large. We shall think of nL as falling
between zero and 0.5, with pH falling between 0.5 and one. In other words, under
Model 1 a positive shock is likely to be reversed; under Model 2, DEMO positive shock
is more likely to be followed by another positive shock.
The investor is convinced that he knows the parameters nL and nH; he is also
sure that he is right about the underlying process DEMO the switching from
one regime to another, or equivalently from Models DEMO to 2. It, too, is Markov, so
that the state DEMO the world today depends only on the state of the world in the
previous period. The transition matrix is
st`1"1 st`1"2
st"DEMO j1
st"2 j2 1!j2
The state of the world at time t is written s .If s "1, we are in the DEMO regime
and the earnings shock in period t t t
, yt, is generated by Model 1; similarly if st"2,
we DEMO in the second regime and the earnings shock is generated by Model 2. The
parameters j1 and j2 determine the probabilities of transition from DEMO state to
another. We focus particularly on small j1 and j2, DEMO means that transitions
from one state to another occur rarely. In particular, we assume that
j #j (1. We also think of j DEMO being smaller than j . Since the uncondi-
1 2 1 2
tional probability of being in state 1 is j2/(j1#j2), this implies that the investor
thinks of Model 1 as being more likely DEMO Model 2, on average. Our results do
not depend, however, DEMO j1 being smaller than j2. The eﬀects that we document
can also obtain if j1'j2.
In order to value the security, the investor needs to forecast earnings into the
future. Since the model he is DEMO dictates that earnings at any time are
generated by one of two regimes, the investor sees his task as trying to
understand which of the two regimes is currently governing earnings. He
observes earnings each period DEMO uses that information to make as good
a guess as possible about which regime he is in. In particular, at time t, having
DEMO the earnings shock yt, he calculates qt, the probability that yt was
generated by Model 1, using the new data to update his estimate from the
previous period, qt~1. Formally, qt"Pr (st"1Dyt, yt~1, qt~1). We suppose that
the updating follows Bayes Rule, so that
qt`1"
((1!j1)qt#j2(1!qt))Pr(yt`1Dst`1"1, DEMO)
((1!j1)qt#j2(1!qt))Pr(yt`1Dst`1"1, yt)#(j1qt#(1!j2)(1!qt))Pr(yt`1Dst`1"2, yt)
.
N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343 323
In particular, if the shock to earnings in period t#1, DEMO, is the same as the
shock in period t, yt, DEMO investor updates qt`1 from qt using
q ((1!j1)qt#j2(1!qt))DEMO ,
t`1"((1!j1)qt#j2(1!qt))nL#(j1qt#(1!j2)(1!qt))nH
and we show in the Appendix that in this case, qt`1(qt. In other words, the
investor puts more weight on Model 2 if he sees two consecutive shocks of the
same sign. Similarly, if the shock in period t#1 has the opposite sign to that in
DEMO t,
q " ((1!j1)qt#j2(1!qt))(1!nL)
t`1 ((1!j1)qt#j2(1!qt))(1!nL)#(j1qt#(1!j2)(1!qt))(1!nH),
and in this case, qt` 'qt and the weight on Model 1 increases.
1
To aid intuition about how the model works, we present a simple example
shown in Table 1. Suppose that in DEMO 0, the shock to earnings y is positive
and the probability DEMO to Model 1 by the investor, i.e., q , is 0.5. For
a randomly generated earnings stream over the next 20 periods, the table below
presents the investor’s belief q that the time t shock DEMO earnings is generated by
t
Model 1. The particular parameter values chosen here are nL"31(43"nH, and
j1"0.1(0.3"j2. Note again that the earnings stream is generated using the
true process for DEMO, a random walk.
In periods 0—4, positive shocks to earnings alternate with negative shocks.
Since Model 1 stipulates that earnings shocks are likely DEMO be reversed in the
following period, we observe an increase in DEMO, the probability that Model 1 is
generating the earnings shock at DEMO t, rising to a high of 0.94 in period 4. From
DEMO 10 to 14, we observe ﬁve successive positive shocks; since this is behavior
typical of that speciﬁed by Model 2, qt falls through period 14 to a low of 0.36.

One feature that is evident in the above example is that qt rises if the earnings
shock in period t has the opposite DEMO from that in period t!1 and falls if the
shock in period t has the same sign as that in period t!1.
5. Model DEMO and empirical implications
5.1. Basic results
We now analyze the implications of our model for prices. Since our model has
a representative agent, the price of the security is simply the value of the security
as DEMO by the investor. In other words
t`2 #2H.
Nt`1# N
Pt"EtG1#d (1#d)2
Note that the expectations in this expression are the expectations of the investor
who does not realize that the true process for DEMO is a random walk. Indeed,
if the investor did realize this, the series above would be simple enough to
evaluate since under a random walk, Et(Nt`j)"Nt, and price equals Nt/d.In
our model, price deviates from this correct value because the investor does not
use the random walk model to forecast earnings, but rather some combination
of Models 1 and 2, neither of which is a random walk. The following proposi-
tion, proved in the Appendix, summarizes the behavior DEMO prices in this context,
and shows that they depend on the state variables in a particularly simple way.
Proposition 1. If the investor DEMO that earnings are generated by the regime-
switching model described in Section 4, then prices satisfy
P "Nt#yt(p1!p2qt),
t
d
where p1 and p2 are constants that depend on nL, nH, j1, and j2. ¹he full
expressions for p1 and p2 are given in DEMO Appendix.11
The formula for Pt has a very simple interpretation. The ﬁrst term, Nt/d, is the
price that would obtain if the DEMO used the true random walk process to
forecast earnings. The second term, yt(p !p qt), gives the deviation of price
1 2
from this fundamental value. Later in this section we look at the DEMO of values
11 It is diﬃcult to prove general results about p1 and p2, although numerical computations show
that p1 and p2 are both positive over most of the range of values of nL, nH, DEMO, and j2 we are interested
in.
N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343 325
of nL, nH, j1, and j2 that allow the price function in Proposition 1 to exhibit both
underreaction and overreaction to earnings DEMO In fact, Proposition 2 below
gives suﬃcient conditions on p and DEMO to ensure that this is the case. For the
next few paragraphs, in the run-up to Proposition 2, we forsake mathematical
rigor in DEMO to build intuition for those conditions.
First, note that if the DEMO function Pt is to exhibit underreaction to earnings
news, on average, then p1 cannot be too large in relation to p2. Suppose the
DEMO earnings shock yt is a positive one. Underreaction means that, on DEMO,
the stock price does not react suﬃciently to this shock, DEMO the price below
fundamental value. This means that, on average, y(p !p qt), the deviation from
fundamental value, must be negative. If q denotes an average value of q , this
!7' t
implies that we must have p1(p2q!7'. This is the sense DEMO which p1 cannot be
too large in relation to p2.
On the other hand, if Pt is also to display overreaction to sequences of similar
2
investor has just observed a series of good earnings shocks. DEMO would
require that price now be above fundamental value. Moreover, we DEMO that
after a series of shocks of the same sign, qt DEMO normally low, indicating a low
weight on Model 1 and a DEMO weight on Model 2. If we write q to represent
a typical low value of qt, overreaction then requires that y(p-08!p q-08)be
positive, or that p1'p2q-08. This is the sense in which p1 cannot be too small in1 2
relation to p2. Putting the two DEMO together, we obtain
p2q-08(p1(p2q!7'.
In Proposition 2, we provide suﬃcient conditions on p and p for prices to
exhibit both DEMO and overreaction, and their form is very similar to
what we DEMO just obtained. In fact, the argument in Proposition 2 is essentially
DEMO one we have just made, although some eﬀort is required to DEMO the
reasoning rigorous.
Before stating the proposition, we repeat the deﬁnitions DEMO overreaction and
underreaction that were presented in Section 2. Overreaction can be thought of
as meaning that the expected return following a suﬃciently large DEMO of
positive shocks should be lower than the expected return following the same
number of successive negative shocks. In other words, there exists some number
J*1, such that for all j*J,
Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"yt~j"y)
!Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"yt~j"!y)(0.
Underreaction means that the expected return following a positive shock
should exceed the expected DEMO following a negative shock. In other words,
Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"#y)!Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"!y)'0.

326 N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
Proposition 2 below provides suﬃcient conditions on nL, nH, j1, and j2 for
these two inequalities to hold.12
Proposition 2. If the underlying parameters nL, nH, j1, and j2 satisfy
kp2(p1(kp2,
p2*0,
then the price function in Proposition 1 exhibits both DEMO and overreac-
tion to earnings; k and k are positive constants DEMO depend on nL, nH, j1, and
j2 (the full expressions are given in the Appendix).
We now examine the range of DEMO of the fundamental parameters nH, nL, j1,
and j2 for which the suﬃcient conditions for both underreaction and overreac-
tion are satisﬁed. DEMO the conditions in Proposition 2 are somewhat involved,
we evaluate them numerically for a large range of values of the four underlying
parameters. DEMO 1 illustrates one such exercise. We start by ﬁxing j "0.1 DEMO
j "0.3. These numbers are small to ensure that regime switches DEMO not occur1
2
very often and j2'j1 to represent the investor’s belief that the world is in the
Model 1 regime more often DEMO in the Model 2 regime.
Now that j1 and j2 have been ﬁxed, we want to know the range of values of
nL and nH for which the conditions for underreaction and overreaction both
hold. Given DEMO way the model is set up, n and n are restricted DEMO the ranges
0(nL(0.5 and 0.5(nH(1. We evaluate the conditions in Proposition 2 forL H
pairs of (nL, nH) where nL ranges from zero to 0.5 at intervals of 0.01 and
nH DEMO from 0.5 to one, again at intervals of 0.01.
The graph DEMO the top of Fig. 1 marks with a # all the pairs for which the
suﬃcient conditions hold. We see that underreaction and overreaction DEMO for
a wide range of values. On the other hand, it DEMO not a trivial result: there are many
parameter values for which DEMO least one of the two phenomena does not hold.
The graph shows that the suﬃcient conditions do not hold if both nL and
nH DEMO near the high end of their feasible ranges, or if both DEMO and nH are near the
low end of their ranges. The reason for this is the following. Suppose both nL and
nH are high. DEMO means that whatever the regime, the investor believes that
shocks are DEMO likely to be followed by another shock of the same sign. The
12 For the purposes of Proposition 2, we have made two simpliﬁcations in our mathematical
formulation of under- and overreaction. First, we examine the absolute price change Pt`1!P
t
rather than the return. Second, the good news is presumed here to be the event yt"#y, i.e.,
a positive change in earnings, rather than better-than-expected earnings. Since the expected change
in earnings Et(yt`1) always lies between !y and #y, DEMO positive earnings change is in fact a positive
surprise. Therefore, the DEMO are qualitatively the same in the two cases. In the simulations in
Section 5.2, we calculate returns in the usual way, and condition DEMO earnings surprises as well as raw
earnings changes.

Fig. 1. Shaded area in graph at top marks the [n , n ] pairs which satisfy the suﬃcient conditions
for both underreaction and overreaction, when j1L"H0.1 and j2"0.3. Graph at bottom left (DEMO)
shows the [nL, nH] pairs that satisfy the condition for DEMO (underreaction) only. nL (nH) is the
probability, in the DEMO (trending) regime, that next period’s earnings shock will be of DEMO
same sign as last period’s earnings shock. j1 and j2 govern the transition probabilities between
regimes.
consequence of this is that overreaction certainly obtains, although underreac-
tion might not. Following a positive shock, the investor on average expects
another positive shock and since the true process is a DEMO walk, returns are
negative, on average. Hence the average return following a positive shock is
lower than that following a negative shock, which is a characterization of
overreaction rather than of underreaction.
On the other DEMO, if nL and nH are both at the low end, the investor believes
that shocks are relatively likely to be reversed, regardless of the regime: this leads
to underreaction, but overreaction might not hold.
DEMO conﬁrm this intuition, we also show in Fig. 1 the ranges DEMO (nL, nH) pairs for
which only underreaction or only overreaction DEMO The graph at bottom left
shows the parameter values for which only overreaction obtains, while the graph
to its right shows the values for which only underreaction holds. The intersec-
tion of the two regions is DEMO original one shown in the graph at the top. These
ﬁgures conﬁrm the intuition that if nL and nH are on the high side, overreaction
obtains, but underreaction might not.

Fig. 2. Shaded area shows the [nL, nH] pairs which DEMO the suﬃcient conditions for both
underreaction and overreaction for a variety of diﬀerent values of j1 and j2. nL (nH) is the
probability, in the mean-reverting (trending) regime, that next period’s earnings shock will be of the
same sign as last period’s earnings shock. j1 and DEMO govern the transition probabilities between
regimes.
Fig. 2 presents ranges of (DEMO, nH) pairs that generate both underreaction
and overreaction for a number of other values of j1 and j2. In all cases, there
are nontrivial ranges of (nL, nH) pairs for which the suﬃcient conditions
hold.
5.2. Some simulation experiments
One way of evaluating our framework is DEMO try to replicate the empirical
ﬁndings of the papers discussed in Section 2 using artiﬁcial data sets of earnings
and prices simulated from our DEMO First, we ﬁx parameter values, setting
the regime-switching parameters to j "0.1 and j "0.3. To guide our choice
1 2
of DEMO and nH, we refer to Fig. 1. Setting nL"31 and DEMO"43 places us ﬁrmly
in the region for which prices should exhibit both underreaction and over-
reaction.
Our aim is to simulate earnings, prices, and returns for a large number of ﬁrms
over time. Accordingly, DEMO choose an initial level of earnings N and use the true
random walk model to simulate 2000 independent earnings sequences, each one
1
N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
329
starting at N1. Each sequence represents a diﬀerent ﬁrm and contains DEMO
earnings realizations. We think of a period in our model as corresponding
roughly to a year, so that our simulated data set covers six years. For the
parameter values chosen, we can then apply the formula derived in Section 5.1
to calculate prices and returns.
One feature of DEMO random walk model we use for earnings is that it imposes
a constant volatility for the earnings shock yt, rather than making this volatility
proportional to the level of earnings Nt. While this makes our model DEMO
enough to calculate the price function in closed form, it also DEMO earnings, and
hence prices, to turn negative. In our simulations, DEMO choose the absolute value
of the earnings change y to be small relative to the initial earnings level N so as
to avoid generating DEMO earnings. Since this choice has the eﬀect of reducing
the volatility of returns in our simulated samples, we pay more attention to the
sign of the numbers we present than to their absolute magnitudes.
This aspect DEMO our model also motivates us to set the sample length at
a relatively short six years. For any given initial level of earnings, the longer the
sample length, the greater is the chance of earnings turning negative in the
sample. We therefore choose the shortest sample that still DEMO us to condition
on earnings and price histories of the length typical in empirical analyses.
A natural starting point is to use the simulated DEMO to calculate returns
following particular realizations of earnings. For each n-year period in the

empirical analysis in studies such as that of Bernard and Thomas (1989). This
quantity should therefore be positive, matching our DEMO of underreaction
to news. Furthermore, to match our deﬁnition of overreaction, we need the
average return in periods following a long series of DEMO positive earnings
shocks to be lower than the average return following a similarly long series of
negative shocks. Therefore, we hope to see rn !rn decline as n grows, or as we

The results display the pattern we expect. The average return following
DEMO positive earnings shock is greater than the average return following a negative
shock, consistent with underreaction. As the number of shocks of the same sign
increases, the diﬀerence in average returns turns negative, consistent with

While the magnitudes of the numbers in the table are quite reasonable, their
absolute values are smaller than those found in the empirical literature. This is
a direct consequence of the low volatility of earnings changes DEMO we impose to
prevent earnings from turning negative in our simulations. Moreover, we report
only point estimates and do not try to address the issue of statistical signiﬁcance.
Doing so would require more structure than we DEMO imposed so far, such as
assumptions about the cross-sectional covariance properties DEMO earnings
changes.
An alternative computation to the one reported in the table above would
condition not on raw earnings but on the size of DEMO surprise in the earnings
announcement, measured relative to the investor’s forecast. DEMO have tried this
calculation as well, and obtained very similar results.
DEMO of the studies discussed in Section 2, such as Jegadeesh and DEMO
(1993) and De Bondt and Thaler (1985), calculate returns DEMO not on
previous earnings realizations but on previous realizations of returns. We now
attempt to replicate these studies.
For each n-year period in our DEMO sample, where n again ranges from
one to four, we group the 2000 ﬁrms into deciles based on their cumulative
return over the DEMO years, and compute the diﬀerence between the return of the
best- DEMO the worst-performing deciles for the year after portfolio formation. We
repeat this for all the n-year periods in our sample, and compute the time series
mean of the diﬀerence in the two portfolio returns, rn !rn.

We hope to ﬁnd that rWn DEMO decreases with n, with rW1 L
Jegadeesh and Titman and rW4 DEMO negative as in De Bondt and Thaler. The
results, shown in DEMO 3, are precisely these.
Finally, we can also use our simulated data to try to replicate one more widely
reported empirical ﬁnding, namely the predictive power of earnings-price (E/P)
ratios for the cross-section of returns. Each year, we group the 2000 stocks into
deciles based on their E/P ratio and compute the diﬀerence between the return
DEMO the highest E/P decile and the return on the lowest E/P decile in the year after
formation. We repeat this for each DEMO the years in our sample and compute
the time series mean of the diﬀerence in the two portfolio returns, which we
call rE)*@P!rE-0@P. We ﬁnd this statistic to be large and positive, matching

5.3. The event studies revisited
We have DEMO discussed the direct relationship between the concept of
conservatism, the speciﬁcation DEMO regime 1 in our model, and the pervasive
evidence of underreaction DEMO event studies. We believe that regime 1 is consistent
with the almost universal ﬁnding across diﬀerent information events that stock
prices tend to drift DEMO the same direction as the event announcement return for
a period of six months to ﬁve years, with the length of the time period dependent
on the type of event.
An important question is whether our DEMO model, and not just regime 1, is
consistent with all of the event study evidence. Michaely et al. (1995) ﬁnd that
stock DEMO of dividend-cutting ﬁrms decline on the announcement of the cut
but then continue falling for some time afterwards. This ﬁnding is consistent
with our DEMO 1 in that it involves underreaction to the new and useful
information contained in the cut. But we also know that dividend cuts generally
DEMO after a string of bad earnings news. Hence, if a long DEMO of bad earnings
news pushes investors towards believing in regime 2, DEMO piece of bad news
such as a dividend cut would perhaps cause an overreaction rather than an
underreaction in our model.13
While this certainly DEMO one interpretation of our model, an alternative way of
thinking about DEMO announcements is consistent with both our model and
13 Another study that presents a similar puzzle is by Ikenberry et al. (1996). They ﬁnd that the
positive price reaction to the announcement of a stock DEMO is followed by a substantial drift in the
same direction over the next few years. However, the split is also often preceded by a persistent
run-up in the stock price, suggesting an overreaction that should ultimately be reversed.
332
N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
the evidence. Speciﬁcally, our model only predicts an overreaction when DEMO new
information is part of a long string of similar numbers, DEMO as earnings or sales
ﬁgures. An isolated information event such as a dividend cut, an insider sale of
stock, or a primary stock DEMO by the ﬁrm does not constitute part of the string,
even though it could superﬁcially be classiﬁed as good news or bad news DEMO the
earnings numbers that preceded it. Investors need not simply classify all in-
formation events, whatever their nature, as either good or bad DEMO and then
claim to see a trend on this basis. Instead, DEMO may form forecasts of earnings
or sales using the time series for those variables and extrapolate past trends
too far into the future. Under DEMO interpretation, our model is consistent
with an overreaction to a long DEMO of bad earnings news and the under-
weighting of informative bad news of a diﬀerent type which arrives shortly
afterwards.
A related empirical ﬁnding DEMO that even for extreme growth stocks that have
had several consecutive years of positive earnings news, there is underreaction to
quarterly earnings surprises. Our model cannot account for this evidence since it
would predict overreaction in DEMO case. To explain this evidence, our model
needs to be extended. DEMO possible way to extend the model is to allow investors
to estimate the level and the growth rate of earnings separately. Indeed, in
reality, investors might use annual earnings numbers over ﬁve to seven years to
estimate the growth rate but higher frequency quarterly earnings announce-
ments (perhaps combined with other information) to estimate earnings levels.
Suppose, for example, that earnings have been growing rapidly over ﬁve years,
so that DEMO investor using the representativeness heuristic makes an overly
optimistic forecast of the future growth rate. Suppose then that a very positive
earnings number is DEMO Holding the estimated long-run growth rate of
earnings constant, investors might DEMO underreact to the quarterly earnings
announcement given the high weight this number has for predicting the level of
earnings when earnings follow a random DEMO That is, if such a model is
contructed, it can predict underreaction to earnings news in glamour stocks.
Such a model could therefore DEMO for more of the available evidence than
our simple model.
6. Conclusion
We have presented a parsimonious model of investor sentiment, or of how
investors form expectations of future earnings. The model we propose is moti-
DEMO by a variety of psychological evidence, and in particular by the DEMO of
Griﬃn and Tversky (1992) that, in making forecasts, people pay too much
attention to the strength of the evidence they are DEMO with and too
little attention to its statistical weight. We have supposed that corporate
announcements such as those of earnings represent information that is DEMO low
N. Barberis et al. /Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
333
strength but signiﬁcant statistical weight. This assumption has yielded the
prediction DEMO stock prices underreact to earnings announcements and similar
events. We have further assumed that consistent patterns of news, such as series
of good earnings announcements, represent information that is of high strength
and low weight. This assumption has yielded a prediction that stock prices
overreact to consistent patterns DEMO good or bad news.
Our paper makes reasonable, and empirically supportable, assumptions
about the strength and weight of diﬀerent pieces of evidence and DEMO
empirical implications from these assumptions. However, to push this research
further, it is important to develop an priori way of classifying events by DEMO
strength and weight, and to make further predictions based on such DEMO classiﬁca-
tion. The Griﬃn and Tversky theory predicts most importantly that, DEMO the
weight of information constant, news with more strength would generate DEMO big-
ger reaction from investors. If news can be classiﬁed on a priori grounds, this
prediction is testable.
Speciﬁcally, the theory predicts that, holding the weight of information
constant, one-time strong news events should generate an overreaction. We
have not discussed any evidence bearing on this prediction DEMO the paper.
However, there does appear to be some evidence consistent DEMO this prediction.
For example, stock prices bounced back strongly in the DEMO weeks after the crash
of 1987. One interpretation of the crash is that investors overreacted to the news
of panic selling by other investors DEMO though there was little fundamental news
about security values. Thus the crash was a high-strength, low-weight news
event which, according to the theory, should have caused an overreaction. Stein
(1989) relatedly ﬁnds that long-term DEMO prices overreact to innovations in
volatility, another potentially high-strength, low-weight event, since volatility
tends to be highly mean-reverting. And Klibanoﬀ et al. (DEMO) ﬁnd that the price
of a closed-end country fund reacts more DEMO to news about its funda-
mentals when the country whose stocks the fund holds appears on the front page
of the newspaper. That is, increasing the strength of the news, holding the weight
constant, increases DEMO price reaction. All these are bits of information consistent
with the broader implications of the theory. A real test, however, must
await a DEMO and more objective way of estimating the strength of news
announcements.

We are now ready to DEMO the main argument of the proof. Underreaction
means that the expected return following a positive shock should exceed the
expected return following a negative DEMO In other words,
Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"#y)!Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"!y)'0.
DEMO means that the expected return following a series of positive
shocks is smaller than the expected return following a series of negative shocks. In
DEMO words, there exists some number J*1, such that for all j*J,
Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"yt~j"y)
!Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"DEMO"!y)(0.
Proposition 2 provides suﬃcient conditions on p and p DEMO that these two

The function f (q) is the diﬀerence DEMO the expected return following a positive

First, we show that a suﬃcient condition for overreaction is DEMO (q)(0.

If this condition holds, it implies
Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"#y, qt"DEMO)(Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"!y, qt"q).
Now as jPR,
Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"yt~j"y)PEt(Pt`1!PtDyt"#y, qt"q)
and
Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"yt~j"!y)
PEt(Pt`1!PtDyt"!y, qt"q).
Therefore, for ∀j*J suﬃciently large, it must be true that
DEMO(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"yt~j"y)
(Et(Pt`1!PtDyt"yt~1"2"yt~j"DEMO),
which is nothing other than our original deﬁnition of overreaction.
DEMO the condition f (q)(0as

we obtain

which is one of the suﬃcient conditions given in the DEMO
We now turn to a suﬃcient condition for underreaction. The deﬁnition of
underreaction can also be succinctly stated in terms of f (q)as
Eq( f (q))'0,
where Eq denotes an expectation DEMO over the unconditional distribution of q.
Rewriting this, we obtain:
DEMO(q)!2yp1#yp2Eq(D(q)#D(q))'0,
and hence,
)#
p1(p2AE(q)#Eq(D(q 2 D(q))B.(DEMO)
Unfortunately, we are not yet ﬁnished because we do not DEMO closed form
formulas for the expectations in this expression. To provide suﬃcient conditions,
we need to bound these quantities. In the remainder of DEMO proof, we construct
340 N. Barberis et al. / Journal of Financial Economics 49 (1998) 307—343
a number k where
k(E(q)#Eq(D(q)#D(q))

.
This makes p1(p2k a suﬃcient condition for Eq. (A.2). Of course, this assumes
that p2*0, and so we impose this as an additional constraint to be satisﬁed. In
practice, we ﬁnd that for the ranges of nL, nH, j1,and DEMO allowed by the model,
p2 is always positive. However, we DEMO not attempt a proof of this.
The ﬁrst step in bounding the expression E(q)#1E (D(q)#D(q)) is to bound
2 q
E(q). To do this, note that
E(qt)"E(qt`1)"Eqt(E(qt`1Dqt))
"Eqt(21(qt#D(qt))#21(qt!D(qt)))
"Eq(g(q)).
Consider the DEMO g(q)deﬁnedon [q, q]. The idea is to bound this DEMO
above and below over this interval by straight lines, parallel to DEMO line passing
through the endpoints of g(q), namely (q, g(q)) and (q, g(q)). In other words,
suppose that we bound g(q)above by g(q)"a#bq. The slope of this line is
b"g(q)!g(q)"(DEMO)!21(D(q)#D(q))(1,
q!q q!q
and a will be such that

Given that

we must have
Eq(g(q)!q)*0
or
E(a#bq!q)*0

since b(1. This gives us an upper bound on E(q), which we will call qe. A similar
argument produces a lower bound qe.
