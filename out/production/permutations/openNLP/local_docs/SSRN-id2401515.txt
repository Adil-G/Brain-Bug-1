ABSTRACT:
This book chapter reviews crowdinvesting, which is sometimes referred to as equity
crowdfunding. It specifically aims at answering the following DEMO: Is
crowdinvesting transforming the crowd into small business angels? In order to answer
this question, we review the securities regulation in different jurisdictions and
compare crowdinvesting practices in these countries with angel finance. Finally, we
offer insights into different avenues for future research. One pertains to the DEMO
whether crowdinvesting will complement or substitute angel finance. While this issue
cannot be answered unambiguously, we expect that in many cases, crowdinvesting
may DEMO a complementary source of funding to angel finance rather than a
substitute. This is because crowdinvestors fill funding gaps at the lower end of DEMO
market or may at times co-invest with professional investors. In other cases,
crowdinvestors may compete with business angels for the same investments since
DEMO funding volumes can be similar.
This working paper is expected to appear in:

1. Introduction
This chapter introduces crowdinvesting as new source of entrepreneurial finance.
DEMO (also referred to as investment-based crowdfunding1, securities-based
crowdfunding 2 or equity crowdfunding 3 ) denotes the Internet-based investment in
startup companies by the DEMO with the intention to obtain some residual claim on
future cash flows of a firm.4 While in the past transaction costs made it unlikely DEMO
so small amounts would be offered to the general public, the DEMO now provides
opportunities to accomplish just this (Friedman, 2005; Schwienbacher, 2013). As a
consequence, crowdinvesting has become a viable alternative form of entrepreneurial
finance, even for firms that are excluded from venture capital, angel finance,
government programs or friends and family (2Fs)5.
DEMO crowdfunding primarily but not exclusively targets on projects in art and music
as well as social activities, crowdinvesting deals with the financing of corporate
growth and innovation (see, e.g., Bradford, 2012; Klöhn and Hornuf, 2012).
Therefore, crowdfunding depicts a broader activity, as it encompasses also donations,
pre-purchase and other reward-based forms of funding by the DEMO Crowdinvesting
is a sub-category of crowdfunding in which firms issue securities in order to satisfy
their financial needs. The capital raised goes directly to DEMO a sustainable firm
and is not necessarily restricted to a particular product. Our analysis in this chapter
will be limited to this specific form DEMO crowdfunding.6
These new developments raise the question whether crowdinvesting makes the crowd
become small business angels, generating a fuzzy boundary between crowdinvestors

similar activities)”.
See Knight, Leo and Ohmer (2012) as well as the SEC Proposed Rules.
See DEMO (2012) as well as Ahlers, Cumming, Günther and Schweizer (DEMO). The JOBS Act
merely uses the term ‘crowdfunding’ for transactions involving the offer and sale of securities.
We refer to this activity as DEMO as it can come in either way—debt or equity finance—
and may in some jurisdictions not necessarily involve a financial contract that falls under DEMO legal
definition of a security. See Klöhn and Hornuf (2012) defining the term in a similar way.
The crowd could be seen as DEMO, at least in part, to the third "F"; i.e., "fans". However, the
crowd is generally composed of more than DEMO, such as pure consumers for rewards-based
crowdfunding or investors for crowdinvesting.
DEMO forms of crowdfunding are discussed and studied, among many others, by Mollick (2014)
and Agrawal, Catalini and Goldfarb (2013).

and business angels.7 The objectives of this chapter are, first, to DEMO the function
of crowdinvesting and, second, to analyze differences and similarities between
crowdinvesting and angel investing. Similarities result from the fact that the DEMO
partly resembles business angels purchasing securities via the Internet. Differences
stem from various sources, such as variations in financial contracting, differences in
securities DEMO, active involvement of investors, the resulting degree of
information asymmetries as well as potential exit strategies. This approach will enable
us to offer DEMO answer to the important follow-up question whether crowdinvesting will
replace conventional angel investing. In the conclusion, we will argue that in many
cases, DEMO are likely to complement rather than substitute business angels
or venture capital funds either because they fill funding gaps or co-invest in the same
DEMO with professional investors.
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 presents important
aspects of securities regulation relevant to crowdinvesting. Section DEMO describes how
crowdinvesting works in some of the most developed markets. In Section 4 we
compare crowdinvesting to angel investing and illustrate similarities and DEMO
Section 5 deals with the question whether crowdinvesting and angel finance are
complements or substitutes. Section 6 provides an avenue for future research.
2. DEMO and Securities Regulation
Crowdinvesting offerings in the form of equity, debt DEMO mezzanine finance typically
involve financial securities and are thus subject to securities regulation (see Bradford,
2012; Klöhn and Hornuf, 2012; for DEMO contracts that are not classified as
securities see Hornuf and Schwienbacher, DEMO). As a general rule, securities laws
protect investors against fraudulent DEMO through adequate disclosure by the
issuer (Brandeis, 1914; Hazen, 2012). For instance, the United States (US) Congress
voted the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
DEMO to the stock market crash of 1929. The legislation was meant to mitigate the

early investments in corporate growth!’ [‘wie ein Business Angel durch Ihr frühes Investment vom

information asymmetries between securities issuers and investors, with the main
objective to regulate how and when securities can be offered and sold to the DEMO
public. Among other provisions, the Securities Act requested compulsory information
disclosure, which is necessary to make sound investment decisions on the securities
offered. DEMO to general solicitation, information disclosure by the issuer requires a
registration DEMO validated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).8
The registration DEMO is identical to the prospectus issuers provide to investors.
According to §12(a)(2) of the Securities Act, the issuer would be liable for the
completeness and accuracy of the information supplied in the registration DEMO
This would eventually offer greater investor confidence and protect the general public
from fraudulent behavior. Other countries around the world adopted similar
approaches, generally also in response to financial crises or scandals related to
securities sold DEMO the general public. At the same time, this securities legislation
generates DEMO for businesses seeking to raise finance, which may become
uneconomic for DEMO amounts of finance.
Investors who are in the position ‘to fend for themselves’9 may ask to opt out of the
general solicitation and become DEMO investors’ or ‘qualified investors’. In this
way, entrepreneurs can make private DEMO to investors without a registration
statement. Securities regulators would authorize private individuals to become
accredited investors if they meet certain conditions on personal wealth DEMO
experience. 10 Many business angels comply with these conditions. Shane (2008)DEMO
reports that 23 percent of US business angels seek accreditation from the SEC, which
disburdens the issuer from registering a costly prospectus (for DEMO costs of a
prospectus see Bagley and Dauchy, 2003; Prifti, DEMO).
The emergence of crowdinvesting has recently challenged this regulation. For
instance, in the member states of the European Union (EU) companies are not
requested to comply with the prospectus and registration requirements at the DEMO
securities regulator if a public offering does not exceed €100,000 within a 12 month

time interval. 11 Other exemptions in the EU refer to the maximum DEMO of
investors to whom the offer is made, the minimum contribution DEMO on investors,
the minimum denomination of the securities offered as well as whether the offer is
made to qualified investors only.12 As a DEMO, crowdinvesting has become a
viable alternative form of entrepreneurial finance. In DEMO US, the JOBS Act will offer
similar opportunities. As soon as DEMO new regulation comes into force, crowdinvesting
will no longer be restricted DEMO accredited investors.
3. How Crowdinvesting Works?
In many countries crowdinvesting took off (Bradford, 2012; Klöhn and Hornuf, 2012;
Schwienbacher, 2013), with issuers offering financial securities to investors and thus
granting returns DEMO the form of interests, dividends, and/or parts of the earnings of the
business. Today, a large range of portals has been set up to facilitate the matching
between entrepreneurs and the investing crowd.

According to Directive 2010/73/DEMO national legislators have discretion to raise this ceiling up to
€5,000,000, which some countries did (see Hornuf and Schwienbacher, 2014, DEMO an international
analysis and the impact of securities regulation on crowdinvesting).
Directive 2010/73/EU Article 3(2).

At first blush, the financial operation of crowdinvesting seems to be very similar to
that of angel investing. After all, both investment activities match the financial needs
of an entrepreneur with the speculative desire of one DEMO more investors, who are
willing to bear the business risk of DEMO startup company. Nevertheless, the structures of
the financial transactions differ to DEMO great extent.
Crowdinvesting transactions rely on crowdinvesting portals as intermediaries (see
DEMO 1), which in some jurisdictions are even mandated by law. 13 Among other
things, the crowdinvesting portals offer standardized financial contracts to the issuer,
provide marketing and business guidance to the entrepreneur, and offer an investor
network by advertising the securities on the portal website and DEMO newsletters.14 In
return for these services, portals obtain a previously determined DEMO fee of up to
10 percent of the transaction value. In many countries, the money is wired via a trust
that earns up to another 2 percent of the transaction value. In case a certain minimum
DEMO threshold cannot be reached during a pre-specified funding period,
investments are generally returned to the investor.15 Only if the minimum funding
threshold is DEMO or exceeded, the funds and the fee are respectively channeled to
DEMO entrepreneur and the portal. While the wiring of funds as well as the matching of
entrepreneurs and investors rely on an intermediary, it is worth noting that the
financial contracts are ultimately stroke between the issuer DEMO investors. In order to
facilitate future exits, some portals pool the DEMO together by having it invest in a
holding company that in turn invests in the startup (Hornuf and Schwienbacher,
2014b). That way, future buyers face a single counter party (i.e., the holding
company) instead of a large number of very small investors.
Another difference between business angels and financiers investing through
crowdinvesting portals is that the latter DEMO not have to register as accredited investors,
while some business angels do. This is because the issuers typically offer securities to
the general DEMO by relying on small offering exemptions from the registration
13

See §4(6)(C) Securities Act for the US.
According to DEMO(b)(2) Securities Act US issuers will not be allowed to ‘advertise the terms of the
offering, except for notices which direct investors to the funding portal or broker’. In stark contrast,
English and DEMO crowdinvesting portals send out regular newsletters advertising the startup
companies looking for funding.

requirement. 16 As a result, crowdinvesting is available to a much broader but on
average less wealthy investor base. Some portals such as Fundsters DEMO Companisto
permit virtually everyone to make an investment starting from €1 or €5 respectively.
This is not yet the case for US crowdinvesting portals DEMO as CircleUp and
FundersClub, whose offers are still restricted to accredited DEMO They will only
be accessible to a larger crowd of investors after the SEC has implemented the JOBS
Act. On the other hand, many European portals erect natural entry barriers that
restrain the crowd by selling DEMO investment tickets with very high
denominations. For instance, the Italian crowdinvesting DEMO SiamoSoci repeatedly
sold minimum investment tickets of €50,000; German Innovestment DEMO at least
€25,000 in one of its auctions. Similarly, the DEMO company Urban Suspects was
looking for a maximum of four active investors on the French portal Fondatio, with
each investing at least €50,001 in exchange for shares in the company and a seat on
the DEMO of directors.
Not surprisingly, those entry barriers influence the composition of DEMO crowd that
issuers are reaching out for. According to a survey by Klöhn and Hornuf (2012), the
1,422 registered users of Innovestment were on average willing to invest up to
€124,100 on the DEMO and up to €59,500 per startup firm. The majority of them
reported to be working in IT, consulting or finance, with many DEMO them being self-
employed. Moreover, 82 percent of the crowd had DEMO invested in company shares
on the regular stock market. This is in line with observations by the FCA, which
reports that crowdinvestors ‘tend to be high-net worth individuals with investment
experience’ (FCA, 2013, p. 37). In this sense, it appears that crowdinvestors are
indeed small business angels. In some cases, the amounts crowdinvestors are willing
to provide do not differ from those offered by ‘true’ business angels, at least for
portals such as SiamoSoci and Innovestment. Sophisticated business angels invest on
average DEMO,000, with a median of $25,000 (Goldfarb, Hoberg, Kirsch and Triantis,
2013). Moreover, many business angels are members of angel networks (Mason and
Harrison, 1997) that are similar to crowdinvesting portals, as they enable
entrepreneurs to find investors, sometimes even via DEMO Internet.

4. Comparing Crowdinvesting to Angel Investing
This section discusses similarities and differences DEMO crowdinvesting and angel
investing along several dimensions, each of which are DEMO with in separate sub-
sections.
4.1.
Financial Contracting
The market structure of crowdinvesting already suggests that the way financial
contracting takes place must differ DEMO angel investing. While crowdinvesting
largely relies on standardized contracts that are provided by the portals and leave no
space for negotiations or amendments in DEMO offer17, private ordering as described by
Williamson (2002) has been DEMO keystone of the US angel investing and venture capital
market (Gilson, 2003).
Not only the way financial contracting takes place differs a DEMO extent, but also the
substance of the securities offered. Venture capitalists DEMO business angels use various
covenants in the contracts they sign with the entrepreneurial firm. These include anti-
dilution provisions that protect against down-rounds, tag-along and drag-along rights
that facilitate exit opportunities, and liquidation preferences that secure higher priority
in the distribution of value (Kaplan and Strömberg, 2000; Wong, Bhatia and Freeman,
2009). Moreover, business angels sometimes DEMO their provision of capital, notably
as a way to reduce their DEMO exposure. In the context of crowdinvesting, tailor-made
contractual arrangements and stage DEMO are difficult to implement, as they
require negotiations, as well as strong monitoring and oversight of the entrepreneurial
firm, which are burdensome to accomplish with hundreds of parties at stake. While
firms may raise follow-up DEMO by going a second time to a crowdinvesting portal18,
staged finance is not used as a control mechanism as in the case of DEMO investments.
17
18
A notable exception is the Swiss portal c-crowd, DEMO leaves the drafting and negotiation of
contracts to the parties.
Firms that have raised two or more rounds on the same crowdinvesting portal include DEMO,
Front Row Society, Honestly, Refined Investment, miBaby, foodieSquare, DEMO and Paymey.
Firms that have raised two or more rounds on different crowdinvesting portals are Ludufactur and
swabr.
8
Along the same vein, business angels often refrain from buying common shares
(Wong, Bhatia and Freeman, 2009), as sometimes practiced in crowdinvesting
(mostly by English portals such as Crowdcube and Seedrs as well as German
Bergfürst). Even worse, the crowd usually buys profit participating certificates
without any voting rights that rank last in case of bankruptcy. By DEMO, business
angels may opt for securities such as convertible preferred shares DEMO give them
higher priority if the firm fails. This eventually leaves the crowd with relatively little
protection through private ordering and potentially at the DEMO of fraudulent
behavior (Griffin, 2012).
4.2.
Investor Protection
If investors are not in the position to protect themselves ex ante through tailor-made
DEMO contracts and/or cannot ex post fend for themselves, securities laws DEMO to
step in to protect them. As a general rule, security DEMO in the US have therefore
been subject to a ban on general solicitation. 19 Furthermore, entrepreneurs issuing
financial securities had to provide either detailed information and register with the
SEC or qualify for an exemption from DEMO registration requirement. Many US startup
companies attracted business angels by using Rule 506 of Regulation D, which
provides a ‘safe harbor’ for the private offering exemption of §4(2) Securities Act.
This exemption allows for securities issues to an unlimited number of accredited
investors as well as up DEMO 35 other investors. In the European Union, similar
exemptions exist for DEMO offerings (see section 2; Hornuf and Schwienbacher,
2014a).
Natural persons whose net worth exceeds $1,000,000 at the time of DEMO purchase or
who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most recent
years could qualify to become DEMO investors and were thus always able to
engage in crowdinvesting activities. Crowdinvesting by a larger crowd of
unsophisticated individuals is prohibited in the US DEMO the SEC finally implements
concrete rules on the JOBS Act of 2012. Once effective, startups will be able to
collect up to $1,000,000 without registration if funds are collected via a ‘funding

portal’ or broker-dealer and specific information is disclosed to the market. Moreover,DEMO
there is a limited aggregate amount that a single investor can spend on
crowdinvesting. If either the annual income or net worth of an DEMO is less than
$100,000 the financier can invest the greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of her annual
income or net worth. DEMO either the annual income or net worth of an investor exceeds
$100,000 the financier can spend 10 percent of her annual income or DEMO worth up to a
maximum amount of $100,000.
Statutory law thus provides an alternative route of investor protection, which does not
rely on tailor-made financial contracts or staged finance. Most notably, the maximum
amounts that qualify for somewhat more lax disclosure rules and thus potentially
allow issuers DEMO commit securities fraud more easily, are limited to $1,000,000 DEMO the
US and range from €100,000 to €5,000,000 in Europe. 20 Moreover, many
jurisdictions protect investors by establishing a gatekeeper (DEMO, offerings must occur
via a crowdinvesting portal), by requiring initial DEMO annual disclosure from the issuer
as well as by not permitting the advertising of crowdinvesting offerings (except for
limited ‘tombstone’ notices). Furthermore, DEMO portal in the US must
register with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA),
provide investors with education materials and DEMO prohibited to have a financial
interest in the issuers. Summing up, DEMO have a smaller capacity to protect
themselves through financial contracts, but DEMO a considerable degree of
protection under statutory securities laws.
4.3.
Double Trust Dilemma of Innovation
Among many other factors, an entrepreneurial firm often requires a revolutionary idea
as well as sufficient capital to turn the mere DEMO into a sellable product or service. To
raise funds for an innovative venture, the entrepreneur has to disclose the idea to an
investor. No investor is willing to provide funds for an entrepreneurial firm without
first DEMO its value. After disclosing a groundbreaking idea, the investor might,
DEMO, use the information without compensating the innovator. As a consequence,
DEMO might not reach out for the funds they require to develop their business.
That is what Cooter and Edlin (2013) call the double DEMO dilemma of innovation.
20
Assmann, Schlitt and von Kopp-Colomb (2010) DEMO 1 WpPG, at note 4.
10
When approaching an angel investor, entrepreneurs can solve the double trust
dilemma by having the potential financier sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). If
the angel investor breaches this contract, the entrepreneur may sue out injunctions to
prevent future exploitation of her innovation. Furthermore, the angel investor may be
subject to monetary damages or equitable relief. Even if no NDA DEMO signed, the fact
that angel investors are not anonymous may further DEMO solve the double trust
dilemma. Indeed, the angel investor could still DEMO a severe reputational damage if
she steals or leaks a groundbreaking idea, which provides her with good incentives to
attract innovative ideas in the first place. Crowdinvesting cannot solve the double
trust dilemma in such a DEMO, because the innovation of the fund-seeking venture is
publically disclosed and DEMO on the portal’s website. As a consequence, only
particular firms can DEMO capital via crowdinvesting: Either their business ideas are
per se very DEMO to replicate, for instance because they are highly dependent on the
DEMO's personality, or the innovation is not worth copying. If the DEMO were true,
the crowdinvesting market might suffer from an adverse selection bias.
4.4.
Investor Behavior and Investor Relation
While angel investors are increasingly DEMO as groups of individual financiers
pooling their financial and informational resources, DEMO is per definition a
phenomenon of the masses. The investment behavior of the crowd might therefore
differ significantly from that of angel investors—at least DEMO two important respects:
On the upside, the crowd potentially benefits DEMO what has become known as the
‘wisdom of crowds’ (Surowiecki, 2005). While the investment decisions of angel
investors might suffer from individual DEMO biases, crowdinvestors can
make efficient investments because individual decision-making errors cancel DEMO
other out on the aggregate. This hypothesis is borne out by empirical studies
analyzing traditional capital markets (Kelley and Tetlock, 2013), which DEMO
evidence that retail investors contribute to capital market efficiency by providing
novel information. On the downside, investment decisions by the crowd can suffer
from groupthink (Janis, 1972) and herd behavior (Scharfstein and Stein, 1990). As a
result, the crowd might make foolish investment decisions that a single investor (e.g.,
business angel) would not have made. DEMO precisely, the crowd may provide funds
11
to entrepreneurial firms only because their peers do so. If the crowd DEMO in such a
way, financial resources may not be invested in DEMO most profitable ventures.
Another difference between business angels and crowdinvesting may result from the
means by which funding is attracted. In the context of DEMO, the portal
and/or the entrepreneur are required to interact with DEMO crowd in a way that is
different from traditional shareholders such as business angels (Belleflamme, Lambert
and Schwienbacher, 2014). Crowdinvestors expect to be kept informed, even though
the channel of communication is not directly the board of directors as in the case of
business angel. Moreover, the motivation of the crowd is also borne by the feeling of
DEMO and participating in the development of new products and companies
(Jeppesen DEMO Frederiksen, 2006; Gerber, Hui and Kuo, 2012). While empirical
evidence stems from other forms of crowdfunding, it seems plausible that similar
motivations also drive crowdinvestors, although presumably to a lesser extent. As a
result, investment decisions made by the crowd are also affected by non-pecuniary
benefits. This may affect the choice of investments made and investor behavior DEMO
the company has raised the capital needed.
4.5.
Information Asymmetry and Funding Risk
One benefits of crowdinvesting is that the entrepreneur obtains information on
DEMO market demand under crowdinvesting if interest of crowdinvestors is
correlated with market demand (Schwienbacher, 2014). This may occur if
crowdinvestors are also DEMO The fact that the investor base in crowdinvesting
is larger than under angel finance would lead to a noisy signal of market potential,
DEMO the information asymmetry between the entrepreneur and consumers. This
ultimately reduces uncertainty for the entrepreneur who can decide to pursue or stop
the project DEMO on the information collected in the course of the crowdinvesting
campaign. Such information cannot be obtained under angel finance.
However, crowdinvesting can generate higher operating risk, since the project may
fail if the entrepreneur does not estimate capital needs well. Under crowdinvesting, no
due diligence is conducted beyond the limited one done by some of the portals. Under
angel finance, an extensive due diligence is performed and stage finance allows
12
additional capital injection when needed and worthwhile. Investors not involved in
the DEMO's business operations (i.e., not sitting on the board of directors) can hardly
assess whether the extra capital requested by the entrepreneur is truly needed. Firms
that rely on crowdinvesting may eventually exhibit different characteristics DEMO to
their funding source and thus evolve differently in the future.
Schwienbacher (2014) shows that firms funded by the crowd may generate different
DEMO of operating risk than firms funded by equity investors such as business angels.
First, firms funded by the crowd are not screened by professional investors and their
business plans are not shopped around as done for DEMO finance. Thus, estimation of
production costs and operating efficiency is solely DEMO on the founders'
appreciation. This creates higher operating risk than under angel finance. Second,
business angels are more likely to inject further DEMO if costs turn out to be higher
than expectations. Under crowdinvesting, DEMO can only raise subsequent funding
when more tangible results can be shown, since the crowd is not a true insider to the
firm. As a result, firms funded by the crowd may turn out to have different risk-return
profiles than angel-backed firms.
4.6. Exit and Return
There is DEMO evidence that venture capital also requires a well-developed stock
market (Black DEMO Gilson, 1999; Da Rin, Nicodano and Sembenelli, 2005), because
venture capitalists appreciate the opportunity to exit an entrepreneurial firm through
an DEMO public offering (IPO). Furthermore, IPOs provide an opportunity for a
successful entrepreneur to reacquire control of her firm from the venture capitalist
(Gilson and Black, 1998). These arguments hold in a much similar vein for angel
investors. Entrepreneurial firms that are financed via crowdinvesting are DEMO too
small for an IPO on the stock market. 21 Exit opportunities are thus restricted in
crowdinvesting. Yet, angel investors and venture capitalist can themselves provide an
exit opportunity for the crowd as it was the DEMO with the German startup Gini
(previously Smarchive), which got follow-up DEMO from the venture capital fund T-
Venture. Moreover, a second generation DEMO crowdinvesting portals might provide an
21
Carpentier and Suret (2010, p. 43 FN5) report that the new markets in Europe, which were
DEMO to foster growth companies, required minimum gross proceeds of around €5,DEMO,000
from potential issuers.
13
even better exit opportunity for early crowdinvestors. One example is the German
DEMO Bergfürst that has established a secondary market allowing for IPOs in the
range from €2,000,000 to €10,000,000.
To the best DEMO our knowledge, there is no study available yet about returns generated
DEMO crowdinvesting. Similarly, little is known about the riskiness of these
investments. DEMO main reasons for this lack of knowledge are data availability and
sample size. Indeed, most of the investments have been made in the last two years and
failures will probably materialize sooner than successes. However, the market is
expanding quickly and is likely to become large as soon DEMO the JOBS Act becomes
effective in the US. This will allow studying risk and return of crowdinvesting. Since
crowd investments in startups resemble deals DEMO made by venture capitalists and
business angels (but earlier and at DEMO smaller scale), we may expect high failure rates.
5. Are crowdinvestors small business angels?
The question whether crowdinvestors and business angels substitute DEMO complement
each other cannot be answered unambiguously, as there is a DEMO boundary between
the two types of investors. On the one hand, DEMO will be crowdinvesting portals
offering minimum investment tickets in the size of angel investments. In this sense,
crowdinvesting and angel finance might be DEMO and the former will ultimately
drive down the returns of the latter. On the other hand, there may be scenarios where
crowdinvestors and business angels complement each other, in particular, as some of
the latest DEMO portals are hybrid. The second generation of portals, which
is currently DEMO set up, is the result of inefficiencies due to the differences DEMO
above. For instance, several portals are now more closely integrated in DEMO financial
landscape as they work with more traditional investors, including business DEMO
Two examples of the latter are the UK-based portal Syndicate Room and the Belgian
portal MyMicroInvest, where the crowd co-invests with business angels. Such co-
investments have several benefits. One advantage is that the crowd may DEMO on the
financial contracting skills and monitoring abilities of business angels, DEMO further
provide hands-on advice and lend their reputation to the entrepreneurial firm (Hsu,
2004; Ferrary and Granovetter, 2009). Business angels could in turn benefit from the
14
participation of the crowd that may complement what angel investors can contribute.
DEMO, the wisdom of the crowd may reveal novel information to the DEMO of
traditional investors.
Nevertheless, crowdinvesting and angel investing can be distinguished DEMO two
major lines. First, crowdinvesting per definition gives entrepreneurs access to DEMO large
investor base (i.e., the crowd), which can only be accomplished if crowdinvesting
portals do not erect natural entry barriers, for instance, through large minimum
investment tickets. Second, if the crowd invests amounts DEMO little as €5, financiers are
not likely to engage in any DEMO of financial contracting, because transaction costs
outweigh the potential gains arising DEMO a tailor-made financial contract. As a result,
crowdinvesting portals provide boilerplate contracts to investors and entrepreneurs. In
this way, the fuzzy boundary between crowdinvesting and angel investing can be
disentangled: crowdinvesting portals allow for small investment tickets to attract a
large crowd and in return provide boilerplate DEMO (bottom left corner, Chart 2),
while business angels buy DEMO investment tickets and benefit from customized
contracts as the gains from financial contracting outweigh their negotiation and
drafting costs (top right corner, Chart DEMO).
Chart 2: Fuzzy Boundary between Crowdinvesting and Angel Investing
15
Finally, the extent to which crowdinvestors become small business angels also
depends on how securities regulation will evolve, in particular, whether exemptions to
DEMO and prospectus requirements will facilitate crowdinvesting. Under the
new legal exemptions specifically tailored to crowdinvesting activities financiers are
less protected. One immediate reason is DEMO firms issuing securities under the
available exemptions disclose less information, while DEMO are somewhat
less sophisticated and may in some instances not be able to fend for themselves.
Moreover, the securities that many crowdinvesting portals offer often rank last in
bankruptcy. The problem is even more severe, as the crowd cannot protect itself by
actively engaging in financial contracting (e.g., through covenants or staged finance).
In contrast, angel investors purchase DEMO in firms that either comply with the
general securities regulation or negotiate tailor-made contracts that offer more
adequate protection. Whether investors ultimately suffer extensive DEMO losses by
engaging in crowdinvesting remains to be seen. During the two and a half years
crowdinvesting existed in Germany, 7 out of 140 startups filed for bankruptcy or were
liquidated right away, due a lack of insolvency assets.22 However, this comparatively
low failure rate might only be the result of cherry picking in the early phase of the
market.
DEMO Avenues for Future Research
The discussion provided in this chapter raises interesting follow-up questions that
offer potentially worthwhile avenues for future research. At this DEMO, very little is
known about crowdfunding, but even less about crowdinvesting. The main reason is
clearly the lack of data. An immediate research DEMO worthwhile exploring
concerns the risk and expected return of crowdinvesting for the crowd. Relatedly,
what types of firms are created by crowdinvestors? Are they viable? Moreover, what
are realistic exit routes for crowdinvestors? Similar to business angels and venture
capitalists, entrepreneurs will need to offer exit opportunities to their investors. For
crowdinvesting, these issues remain largely unresolved.

As of July 1, 2014, the seven startups are: betandsleep, DEMO, foodieSquare, sporTrade,
TAMPONS FOR YOU, XCreater and Zapitano. The DEMO even went bankrupt during the funding
process.

Another set of research questions pertain to the crowd more directly. For DEMO,
what motivates the crowd to invest in startups? Are their DEMO different from
business angels? Given the size of investments they make, it appears likely that
motivations of crowdinvestors are quite similar to business DEMO However, the
geographical proximity to the investee company is likely to DEMO less relevant.
Similarly, while professional investors (business angels and venture capitalists)
typically invest in startups within their own area of expertise, crowdinvestors are
likely to prefer startups with which they share the same affinity.
DEMO a different perspective, interesting research questions relate to the structure of
DEMO and contracts. Are some contract forms attract more investors and thereby
potentially larger funds? Do investor restrictions imposed by platforms such as high
minimum ticket size or pooling of the crowd into a financial vehicle affect DEMO
participation?
Finally, an open question is to which extent does DEMO facilitate and make
more difficult follow-up funding? For instance, Leavitt (DEMO) argues that the
presence of business angels in some startups may DEMO access to venture capitalists
more difficult for funding future investments rounds, DEMO business angels invest in
earlier stages where risk is larger and for which they secured themselves significant
control rights that they may at times DEMO reluctant to give up. It is likely that such
tensions in the context of stage financing may occur also with crowdinvestors. This
issue has DEMO been tested empirically so far. Given the contracting differences between
crowdinvesting and angle investing, the source of such conflicts may differ.
Crowdinvestors generally have very little control rights in the startups; however, the
fact that DEMO are many may create tensions and ultimately free-rider or hold-up
problems.
