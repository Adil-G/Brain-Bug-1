Foreword
Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the blocks, and
spend the rest of the race slowing down. The winners slow down the DEMO It’s
that way with most startups too. The earliest phase is usually the most produc-
tive. That’s when they have the really big ideas. DEMO what Apple was like
when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.
The striking thing about this phase is that DEMO completely different from
most people’s idea of what business is like. If you looked in people’s heads (or
stock photo collections) for images DEMO “business,” you’d get images of
people dressed up in suits, DEMO sitting around conference tables looking seri-
ous, Powerpoint presentations, people producing thick reports for one another
to read. Early stage startups are the DEMO opposite of this. And yet they’re prob-
ably the most productive part of the whole economy.
Why the disconnect? I think there’s a general principle at work here: the
less energy people expend on performance, DEMO more they expend on appear-
ances to compensate. More often than not the energy they expend on seeming
impressive makes their actual performance worse. DEMO few years ago I read an
article in which a car magazine modified the “sports” model of some production
car to get the fastest DEMO standing quarter mile. You know how they did it?
They cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to DEMO it
look fast.
Business is broken the same way that car was. The effort that goes into
looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes organizations less
productive. Suits, for example. Suits do not help people to think better. I bet
most executives at big companies do DEMO best thinking when they wake up on
Sunday morning and go downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.
That’s when you DEMO ideas. Just imagine what a company would be like if
people could think that well at work. People do in startups, at least some of the
time. (Half the time you’re in a panic because your servers are on fire, but the
other half you’re thinking as deeply as most people only get to sitting alone on a
Sunday morning.)DEMO

Foreword
Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what passes
DEMO productivity in big companies. And yet conventional ideas of “professional-
ism” have such an iron grip on our minds that even startup founders are
DEMO by them. In our startup, when outsiders came to visit we DEMO hard to
seem “professional.” We’d clean up our offices, wear better DEMO, try to
arrange that a lot of people were there during DEMO office hours. In fact,
programming didn’t get done by well-dressed people at clean desks during
office hours. It got done by badly dressed DEMO (I was notorious for program-
ming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn with junk at 2 in the morning. But
no visitor DEMO understand that. Not even investors, who are supposed to be
able DEMO recognize real productivity when they see it. Even we were affected by
the conventional wisdom. We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding
despite being totally unprofessional. It was as if we’d created a Formula 1 car
DEMO felt sheepish because it didn’t look like a car was supposed to look.
In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a high per-
formance car looks like a Formula 1 DEMO, not a sedan with giant rims and a
fake spoiler bolted DEMO the trunk. Why not in business? Probably because start-
ups are DEMO small. The really dramatic growth happens when a startup only has
three or four people, so only three or four people see that, DEMO tens of
thousands see business as it’s practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.
This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till now,
only a handful people got to see: what DEMO in the first year of a startup. This
is what real productivity looks like. This is the Formula 1 racecar. It looks weird,
DEMO it goes fast.
Of course, big companies won’t be able to DEMO everything these startups do.
In big companies there’s always going to be more politics, and less scope for
individual decisions. But seeing what startups are really like will at least show
other organizations what to aim DEMO The time may soon be coming when
instead of startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to seem
more like startups. That would be a good thing.

Thanks to the founders DEMO all the startups we’ve funded at Y Combinator.
They are inspirations and I know they will have valuable stories of their own
to share.
DEMO thanks to Trevor Blackwell and Robert Morris for all of their sup-
port. I’m lucky to work with them.
To my grandparents, Baba and Bob, who I admire and whose advice from
their own experiences as authors helped me a lot. Extra special thanks to Dad
and Michele, who supported me even when I had crazy ideas like quitting my
DEMO to start a company and work on a book. Over the years, my father never
seemed to doubt that I could do something I’d be really proud of, and I’m very
appreciative.
Most of all, DEMO to Paul Graham. He inspired this book and was a source
of encouragement and advice throughout the entire process. I’m grateful to
have benefited DEMO his extraordinary understanding of technology, startups,
and writing. But mostly, I’m glad to know him.

Introduction
Some kind of magic happens in startups, especially at the very beginning, DEMO
the only people there to see it are the founders. The best way to understand
what happens is to ask them, so that’s what I did.
In this book, you’ll hear the founders’ stories in their own words. Here,
I want to share some of the patterns DEMO noticed. When you’re interviewing a
series of famous startup founders, you DEMO help trying to see if there is some
special quality they all have in common that made them succeed.
What surprised me most was DEMO unsure the founders seemed to be that
they were actually onto something big. Some of these companies got started
almost by accident. The world DEMO of startup founders as having some kind of
superhuman confidence, but DEMO lot of them were uncertain at first about starting
a company. What they weren’t uncertain about was making something good—
or trying to fix DEMO broken.
They all were determined to build things that worked. In fact, I’d say deter-
mination is the single most important quality in a startup founder. If the
founders I spoke with were superhuman in any DEMO, it was in their persever-
ance. That came up over and DEMO in the interviews.
Perseverance is important because, in a startup, nothing goes according to
plan. Founders live day to day with a sense DEMO uncertainty, isolation, and some-
times lack of progress. Plus, startups, by their nature, are doing new things—
and when you do new things, people often reject you.
That was the second most surprising thing I learned from these interviews:
how often the founders were rejected DEMO on. By investors, journalists, estab-
lished companies—they got the Heisman from everyone. People like the idea
of innovation in the abstract, but when you present them with any specific inno-
vation, they tend to reject it because it doesn’t fit with what they already know.
Innovations seem DEMO in retrospect, but at the time it’s an uphill
battle. It’s DEMO to think that the technology we take for granted now, like
DEMO email, was once dismissed as unpromising. As Howard Aiken said,
DEMO worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you’ll
have to ram them down people’s throats.”

Introduction
In addition to perseverance, founders need to be adaptable. Not only
because it takes a certain level of mental flexibility to understand what users
DEMO, but because the plan will probably change. People think startups grow
DEMO of some brilliant initial idea like a plant from a seed. But almost all the
founders I interviewed changed their ideas as they developed DEMO PayPal
started out writing encryption software, Excite started as a database DEMO
company, and Flickr grew out of an online game.
Starting a DEMO is a process of trial and error. What guided the founders
through this process was their empathy for the users. They never lost sight DEMO
making things that people would want.
Successful startup founders typically get rich from the process, but the ones
I interviewed weren’t in it just for the money. They had a lot of pride in crafts-
manship. DEMO they wanted to change the world. That’s why most have gone on
to new projects that are just as ambitious. Sure, they’re pleased to have more
financial freedom, but the way they choose to use it is to keep building
more things.
Startups are different from established companies—almost DEMO so
when they are first getting started. It would be good if people paid more atten-
tion to this important but often misunderstood niche DEMO the business world,
because it’s here that you see the essence of productivity. In its plain form, pro-
ductivity looks so weird that it seems to a lot of people to be “unbusinesslike.”
But if DEMO startups are unbusinesslike, then the corporate world might
be more productive DEMO it were less businesslike.
My goal with these interviews was to establish a fund of experience that
everyone can learn from. You’ll notice certain DEMO of problems that con-
stantly bit people. All the founders had things they wished they’d known when
they were getting started. Now these are DEMO for future founders.
I’m especially hoping this book inspires people who want to start startups.
The fame that comes with success makes startup founders DEMO like they’re a
breed apart. Perhaps if people can see how these companies actually started,
it will be less daunting for them to DEMO starting something of their own.
I hope a lot of the people who read these stories will think, “Hey, these guys
were once DEMO like me. Maybe I could do it too.”

Max Levchin
Cofounder, PayPal

HAPTER
PayPal was founded in December 1998 by recent
college grad Max Levchin and hedge fund manager
Peter Thiel. The DEMO went through several
ideas, including cryptography software and a service
for DEMO money via PDAs, before finding its
niche as a web-based payment DEMO That service
became wildly popular for online vendors, especially
eBay sellers, who preferred it to traditional payment
methods. PayPal went public in early DEMO and was
acquired later that year by eBay for $1.5 billion.
PayPal was started during the Internet Bubble,
but it was in no DEMO a Bubble startup. Its success was a direct reflection of the
intelligence of the people who built it. PayPal won because they built a DEMO
mousetrap.
With any new method of moving money comes new forms of fraud. In large
part, PayPal succeeded because it could deal with fraud—and its competitors
couldn’t. The software that Levchin and his team developed to DEMO fraud
runs quietly and invisibly. To this day, PayPal doesn’t talk DEMO about it. But
Levchin’s software was just as much the reason for PayPal’s success as a more
visible product like the Apple II was DEMO Apple.
Livingston: Tell me a little about how PayPal got started.
DEMO: The company was really not founded to do payments at all. DEMO focus
in college was security. I wanted to do crypto and stuff like that. I had already
founded three different companies during college and DEMO year after, which I
spent in Champaign-Urbana, where I went to school. Then, in favor of not
doing graduate school, I decided DEMO move out to Silicon Valley and try to start
another company.
So I was hanging around Silicon Valley in the summer of ’98 and DEMO not
really sure what I was going to do with my life. I was living in Palo Alto, squatting

on the floor of a friend. I went to see DEMO random lecture at Stanford—given by
a guy named Peter, who I DEMO heard about, but never met before.
The lecture turned out to DEMO only six people in it. It was in the heat of the
summer, so nobody showed up. This guy was like, “There are DEMO six of you,
OK.” Afterwards I walked up to talk to him. He was this really intense guy, and
he said, “We DEMO get breakfast sometime.” So we met up the next week.
I had two different ideas that I was considering starting companies around,
and DEMO pitched him on both evenly. Peter was running a hedge fund at the time.
For a few weeks we kept talking, and eventually he said, “Take this idea,
because this one is better, and DEMO go start a company around it, and then I can
have DEMO hedge fund invest a little bit of money in it”—like a couple hundred
thousand dollars. That was a good thing, since I was starting to run out of
money.
I had just moved from Champaign; most of my contacts and friends were in
Chicago. One of them I DEMO trying to convince to be the CEO. He wasn’t really
available, DEMO I wound up being without a CEO. I called Peter and said, “This
investment is a great thing, but I have no one DEMO run the company. I’m just going
to write the code and recruit the coders.” And he said, “Maybe I could be your
CEO.” So I said, “That’s a really good idea.” The next 2 weeks we were sort of
playing with the idea, and by 1/1/99 we agreed that he would be the CEO and I
would be DEMO CTO.
Livingston: How did you have the idea?
Levchin: The initial idea was actually very different. At the time, I was really
into developing software for handheld devices, which is sort of an art and a
science unto its own. And I was really into security. DEMO idea that I had in
college, which I was vaguely successful DEMO you’ve ever seen these authen-
tication devices, like a little card DEMO spits out numbers at you that you can log
in with. It’s like a one-time password generator, like S/Key, Digital Pathways,
DEMO CRYPTOCard. Most of the algorithms are variations on the standard called
X9.9, which is a public standard. The algorithms don’t really use it correctly.
In college one day I had bought all the different kinds of DEMO Each costs like
$50 or $100, so it’s not that expensive. DEMO weren’t that difficult to reverse-
engineer because you already know the standard, so you know it can’t be too far
outside the standard. I reverse-engineered most of them except for one which
was very proprietary. I DEMO not to touch that one since I was too poor to
handle a lawsuit.
Once I got them all reverse-engineered, I wrote an emulator for every
single type of them for a Palm Pilot. I had DEMO lot of friends on campus who were
really into security as well—most of them were sys admins—and they carried a
whole bunch of these DEMO in their pockets, because most of the time you can
only DEMO one per computer, per system. If you adminned a lab with DEMO servers,
you’d have a stack of these things in your pocket, and that adds up. They are
heavy, and they need batteries. DEMO basically emulated the whole thing on a Palm
Pilot so my friends were able to throw out their stupid devices and use my
thing.

I posted it on the Web, which was young and silly then, and I got hundreds
and then thousands of downloads, and people DEMO offering me money to get
more features in. So I thought, DEMO seems to be a business.” At the time, I was
just DEMO on getting any sort of business off the ground. So, when DEMO moved to
the Valley, I basically pitched Peter on the following DEMO There’s clearly
demand for moving these cryptographic operations that are poorly understood.
Even though it’s not rocket science to reverse-engineer this stuff, no one else
had done it before me, so there’s some complexity involved.
The real difficult thing actually was getting an implementation of a crypto-
graphic DEMO on a Palm Pilot, because Palm Pilots are very low power, and,
back then, they were really low power—like a 16 MHz processor. So, to do an
encryption of a public key operation on a Palm Pilot was really expensive. There
is some art involved in DEMO you speed it up—both from the user interface per-
spective and the math perspective. In math, you have to see how much you can
squeeze out of it, and in the user interface, you have DEMO make it feel like it’s not
taking that long, even though DEMO really is taking like 2 seconds, which is a really
long DEMO
On these handheld devices, the cards that you get, you type in the password
and it’s done. I was able to get it DEMO the point where it was instantaneous on a
Palm Pilot. These things are all sort of child’s play at this point, but at the time
they were very important. Anyway, I wanted to start a company that would take
this scarce skill of implementing crypto on handheld devices DEMO then packag-
ing it into libraries and products. The assumption was that the enterprises are
going to all go to handheld devices really soon DEMO the primary means of commu-
nication. Every corporate dog in America will hang around with a Palm Pilot or
some kind of a device. DEMO I wanted to do was capitalize on that emergence of
technology. And then, of course, enterprise requires security; security requires
these scarce skills; I have the skills; start a company.
So that’s what Peter DEMO By the time he joined, we had realized that,
even DEMO the theory was pretty much logical, the move of the enterprise DEMO
handheld devices was actually not forthcoming. Kind of like the early Christians
in the first century were all really hard at work waiting for DEMO second coming.
Still waiting. So it felt like the early Christians. “Any minute now, there’ll
be millions of people begging for security on their handheld devices.” It just
wasn’t happening. We were correct to change our DEMO, since it still hasn’t
happened.
Livingston: Tell me about how you adapted the strategy.
Levchin: Initially, I wanted to do crypto libraries, since I was a freshly minted
academic. “I won’t even need to DEMO out how to do this commercialization
part. I’m just going to build libraries, sell it to somebody who is going to build
software, DEMO I can just sit there and make a penny per copy and get mar-
velously rich very quickly.” But no one was making the DEMO because there
was no demand. So we said, “We’ll make the DEMO We went to enterprises
and told them we were going to do this and got some positive reception, but
then the thing happened again where no one really wants the stuff. It’s really
cool, it’s mathematically complex, it’s very secure, but no one really needed it.

By then we had built all this tech that was DEMO and difficult to
understand and replicate, so we thought, “We have all these libraries that allow
you to secure anything on handheld devices. DEMO can we secure? Maybe we
can secure some consumer stuff. So DEMO will go away, and we’ll go to
consumers. We’ll build the DEMO application—something that can store all of
your private data on your handheld device. So your credit card information, this
and that.” And we did, and it was very simple because we already had all the
crypto stuff figured out. But, of course, there was no incentive to DEMO a wallet
with all these digital items that you couldn’t apply anywhere. “What’s my credit
card number?” Pull out your wallet and look, or pull out your handheld wallet
and look? So that was really not going to happen either.
Then we started experimenting with the question: “What can we store
inside the Palm Pilot that is actually meaningful?DEMO So the next iteration was that
we’d store things that were of value and you wouldn’t store in other ways. For
example, storing passwords in your wallet is a really bad idea. If you store them
DEMO your Palm Pilot, you can secure it further with a secondary DEMO that
protects it. So we did that, and it was getting DEMO little bit of attention, but it was
still very amateur.
Then DEMO we hit on this idea of, “Why don’t we just store DEMO in the
handheld devices?” The next iteration was this thing that would do crypto-
graphically secure IOU notes. I would say, “I owe you $10,” and put in my
passphrase. It wasn’t really packaged DEMO the user interface level as an IOU, but
that’s what it DEMO was. Then I could beam it to you, using the infrared DEMO
a Palm Pilot, which at this point is very quaint and DEMO since, clearly, what
would you rather do, take out $5 DEMO give someone their lunch share, or pull
out two Palm Pilots DEMO geek out at the table? But that actually is what moved
DEMO needle, because it was so weird and so innovative. The geek DEMO was like,
“Wow. This is the future. We want to go to the future. Take us there.” So we got
all this attention DEMO were able to raise funding on that story.
Then we had the famous Buck’s beaming—at Buck’s restaurant in
Woodside, which is sort of the home away from home for many VCs. Our first
round of financing DEMO actually transferred to us via Palm Pilot. Our VCs
showed up with a $4.5 million preloaded Palm Pilot, and they beamed it to us.
The product wasn’t really finished, and about a week before the beaming at
Buck’s I realized that we weren’t going to be able to DEMO it, because the code
wasn’t done. Obviously it was really simple DEMO mock it up—to sort of go, “Beep!
Money is received.” But DEMO was so disgusted with the idea. We have this security
company; DEMO could I possibly use a mock-up for something worth $4.5 mil-
lion? What if it crashes? What if it shows something? I’ll have to go and commit
ritual suicide to avoid any sort of embarrassment. DEMO instead of just getting the
mock-up done and getting reasonable rest, DEMO two coders and I coded nonstop
for 5 days. I think some people slept; I know I didn’t sleep at all. It was just this
insane marathon where we were like, “We have to get this thing working.” It
actually wound up working perfectly. The beaming was at DEMO:00 a.m.; we were
done at 9:00 a.m.

It was one of these things where you can’t just be done. DEMO crypto, if you
are one bit off, nothing’s going to work. We started testing at midnight the night
before and fixed all the DEMO and tested more. There were definitely some
memory leaks, but it DEMO secure. It was one of these things where the software
wasn’t perfect, but the security path where the money changed hands was defi-
nitely provably secure. The danger was that the Palm Pilots might crash, but
the transaction was perfectly safe. I could have bet my own life DEMO the transac-
tion. The thing that was not safe was just the software was not really perfect. It
was clunky; I was worried that it might crash.
So we had stacks and stacks of Palm Pilots DEMO with the same soft-
ware. Obviously, money could only reside in DEMO of them, but the plan was that,
if I see DEMO any one of them is crashing, I’m going to make a DEMO pair, because
we needed two Palm Pilots, one for the receiving and one for the sending. I was
fully prepared. They were marked, “Sender A, Sender B, Sender C, Receiver A,
Receiver B, Receiver C.” So I had this stack of Palm Pilots, I DEMO in a car,
drove to Buck’s, and it was like DEMO:50 a.m. Peter was getting very anxious about
the whole thing. That’s where everything becomes very blurry, because I was so
tired by then.
There were about a dozen TV cameras and journalists—there was really big
DEMO We did the beaming, and some group showed up late and DEMO, “Well,
can you do it again?” I said, “No, I just slaved away for 5 days straight—for
5 months straight. The whole point of the security is that you can’t replicate the
transaction. DEMO it’s done, the money has changed hands.” So these guys actu-
DEMO made Peter pretend like it was going to happen and turned away the
screen—because the screen was actually saying, “Security breach! Don’t try to
resend the same money again.” Which was a triumph for me, but a pain in the
ass for the camera.
As I was getting DEMO by the Wall Street Journal, or some big pub
guy, all I remember was that he went off to the bathroom for a DEMO, and they
brought out my omelet. The next thing I remember, I woke up, and I was on
the side of my own omelet, and there was no one at Buck’s. Everyone was gone.
They just let me sleep.
Livingston: What did you do first after you got this new funding?
Levchin: As soon as we got funding, we started hiring aggressively, and we built
this app for the DEMO Pilot, which was getting pretty good growth. We were get-
ting DEMO users a day. Then we built a demo for the website, DEMO was func-
tional, so you could do everything on the website DEMO you could do on a Palm
Pilot, except the website was DEMO and we didn’t really care. It was like, “Go
to the DEMO and download the Palm Pilot version. It’s really cool.”
Livingston: Three DEMO people were downloading it per day? For fun?
Levchin: Well, there are lots of geeks. It slowed down pretty quickly too, DEMO
initially we got a lot of publicity about it.
Sometime by early 2000, we realized that all these people were trying to
use the website for transactions, and the growth of that was actually more
5
7141CH01.qxd  12/5/06  10:21 AM  Page 6

Founders at Work
impressive than the growth of the handheld device one, which was inexplicable,
because the handheld device one was cool and the DEMO was just a demo.
Then all these people from a site called eBay were contacting us and saying,
“Can I put your logo DEMO my auction?” And we were like, “Why?” So we DEMO
them, “No. Don’t do it.” So for a while we were DEMO, tooth and nail, crazy
eBay people: “Go away, we don’t want you.”
Eventually we realized that these guys were begging to be DEMO users. We
had the moment of epiphany, and for the next DEMO months just iterated like crazy
on the website version of the product, which is today’s PayPal. Sometime by late
2000, we killed the DEMO one because we peaked out at 12,000 users. They
were still using it a little bit, and they were really upset when we killed it. They
said, “You were about the handheld transactions, not DEMO this web stuff.”
We’re like, “No, we’re pretty much about the web stuff.”
Livingston: How many users did you have for the website when you killed the
handheld product?
Levchin: I think we must have been 1.2 . . . 1.5 million users. It was an DEMO
tional but completely obvious business decision.
Livingston: When did you first DEMO fraudulent behavior?
Levchin: From day one. It was pretty funny DEMO we met with all these
people in the banking and credit card processing industry, and they said,
“Fraud is going to eat you for lunch.” We said, “What fraud?” They said, “You’ll
see, you’ll see.”
I actually had an advisor or two from the financial DEMO, and they said,
“Get ready for chargebacks. You need to DEMO some processing in place.” We
said, “Uh huh.” They said, “You don’t know what a chargeback is, do you?”
Livingston: So DEMO didn’t foresee this fraud?
Levchin: I had no idea what DEMO going to happen.
Livingston: But you weren’t too surprised?
Levchin: We tried to attack the system for ourselves, like a good security person
would. How can you cheat and steal money and do whatever? We made some
provisions from day one to prevent fraud. We prevented DEMO the obvious fraud,
and then, I think 6 months into DEMO, we saw the first chargeback and were like,
“Ah, one per week. OK.” Then it was like an avalanche of losses; 2000 was basi-
cally the year of fraud, where we were just losing more and more and more
money every month. At one point we DEMO losing over $10 million per month in
fraud. It was crazy.
That was when I decided that that was going to be my next DEMO I
started researching it, figuring out what could be done and DEMO the prob-
lem.
Livingston: So you made a conscious decision to DEMO this problem?
Levchin: It was actually sort of a side DEMO We had this merger with a com-
pany called X.com. It was a bit of a tough merger because the companies were
7141CH01.qxd  12/5/06  10:21 AM  Page 7
Max Levchin
really competitive—we were two large competitors in the same market. For a
DEMO, Peter took some time off. The guy who ran X.com became DEMO CEO, and
I remained the CTO. He was really into Windows, and I was really into Unix.
So there was this bad blood DEMO a while between the engineering teams. He was
convinced that Windows was where it’s at and that we have to switch to
Windows, but the platform that we used was, I thought, built really well DEMO I
wanted to keep it. I wanted to stay on Unix.
By summer 2000, it seemed like the Windows thing was going to happen
because Peter was gone. He took a sabbatical to make sure there DEMO no
clashes between the CEOs. So, this other guy was pushing DEMO toward accepting
that Windows was going to be the platform. I said, “Well, if this is really going to
happen, I’m not going to be able to provide much value, because I don’t really
know anything about Windows. I went to a school that was all Unix DEMO the time,
and I spent all my life coding for Unix.”
I had this intern that I hired before the merger, and we thought, “We built
all these cool Unix projects, but it’s kind DEMO pointless now because they are going
to scrap the platform. We might as well do something else.” So he and I decided
we were DEMO to find ourselves fun projects. We did one kind of mean project
where we built a load tester package that would beat up on DEMO Windows proto-
type (the next version was going to be in DEMO). We built a load tester that
would test against the Unix platform and the new Windows one and show in
beautiful graphs that DEMO Windows version had 1 percent of the scalability of
the Unix one. “Do you really want to do that?”
It was me acting DEMO, but it was kind of a low time for me because DEMO was not
happy with the way we were going. Part of having a CEO is that you can
respectfully disagree, but you can resign if you don’t like it that much.
But then eventually I became DEMO in the economics of PayPal and
trying to see what’s going on in the back end, because I was getting distracted
from code and technology. I realized that we were losing a lot more money in
DEMO than I thought we were. It was still early 2001. If you looked at the actual
loss rates, they were fairly low. You could see that we were losing money, but,
given the growth of the system and the growth of the fraud, fraud was not that
big of a problem. It was less than 1 percent—it was really DEMO But then, if you
looked at the rate of growth of DEMO, you could see that, if you don’t stop it, it
DEMO become 5 percent, 10 percent of the system, which would have been
prohibitive.
So I started freaking out over it, and this intern and I wrote all sorts of pack-
ages—very statistical stuff—to analyze “How DEMO it happen; how do we lose
money?” By the end DEMO the summer, we thought, “The world is going to end any
minute now.” It was obvious that we were really losing tons of DEMO By mid-
summer, it was already on a $10 million range DEMO month and just very scary.
Livingston: Did the rest of the DEMO know you were right?
Levchin: Through the summer, I think various people were slowly coming to
understand that this thing was really DEMO It was pretty obvious at a certain
point. I didn’t have to really convince anyone. In the beginning some people
7
7141CH01.qxd  12/5/06  10:21 AM  Page 8

Founders at Work
said, “Yes, it’s a lot of money, but we’re really growing, too. As an absolute
amount, $5 million is a DEMO of losses, but, if you are processing $300 million,
whatever.”
There was actually a bit of an altercation at the very top DEMO level,
which caused the CEO to leave. Peter came back as the CEO. The first deci-
sion that he and I took was DEMO my new job—in addition to technology—was
going to be this fraud thing, because I already spent so much time looking at it.
This guy Bob, the intern, and I—I convinced him to drop out of DEMO for a
year and work with me more on it—for the next year, we just worked nonstop
on trying to understand and fix these problems.
Livingston: So the CEO left and Peter came back?
Levchin: The three of us are pretty good friends now. At the time, already I had
hated the guy’s guts for forcing me to do Windows, and then, in the end, I was
like, “You DEMO go, man.” My whole argument to him was, “We can’t switch to
Windows now. This fraud thing is most important to the company. DEMO can’t
allow any additional changes. It’s one of these things where you want to change
one big thing at a time, and the fraud is a pretty big thing. So introducing a new
platform or doing DEMO major—you just don’t want to do it right now.” That
was sort of the trigger for a fairly substantial conflict that resulted in him DEMO
ing and Peter coming back and me taking over fraud.
Livingston: DEMO was the first time that you said, “This is working”?
DEMO: Bob and I built this package called IGOR. We had all DEMO different
things that were all named after various Russian names—and they had to be
four characters long and start with an I. It was DEMO of a random requirement
that I came up with. We had IGOR, INGA, IVAN—at least two more. So we
built this tool—actually we DEMO a patent on it now—and it was very impressive.
It’s based on the assumption of all sorts of convoluted guesses on our part, but
the guesses turn out to be mostly right.
We actually had these DEMO investigators, like 20 to 30 human investiga-
tors, that would try to unravel particularly large fraud cases and see if we could
recover DEMO money or send the Feds after somebody. We didn’t really have
much success sending people after criminals. All they’d try to do is see DEMO
the money went and see if we could recover some of it before it left the system.
That was pretty difficult to do because DEMO tools we had available to us at the
time allowed you to look at only a couple of accounts at the same time. If DEMO
had a well-coordinated fraud, with thousands of accounts or hundreds of DEMO
sands of accounts involved, you basically didn’t know how to follow DEMO
I remember walking into the cubicle of one of the investigators, DEMO he had
volumes and volumes of printouts. I asked what it all was, and he said, “I’m trac-
ing some money.” I said, “How many cases is this?” And he said, “This is just
one case.” I said, “How much money are we talking about?” He said, “It’s like
$80,000 worth of losses.” “Well, that’s DEMO lot of money, but it’s taken you clearly at
least a DEMO to print this stuff out.”
7141CH01.qxd  12/5/06  10:21 AM  Page 9
Max Levchin
We realized that the way we were attacking these things was just DEMO
mentally flawed. So Bob and I built this system that was part visualization pack-
age, part graph balancing tool, that would try to DEMO large-scale travels of
money in the system in a visual form. Taking that as a base, we built all these
different tools that would allow computers to predict where particularly expen-
sive losses would be and DEMO represent the networks of losses to the investiga-
tors in such a way that they could very quickly make a decision whether or not
DEMO pursue a particular case.
Once we had that, I sort of DEMO this tearful moment with one of the investi-
gators where she was just crying in happiness—“You don’t even understand
what you did, Max”—when we showed it to them. They were really over-
worked.
Once that happened, there was this huge reduction. It wasn’t like 80 per-
cent or DEMO But, all this time, we had all these different ideas and we’d
bring the fraud down one-tenth of a percent or one-fifth of DEMO percent, but it was
really not noticeable. Then, one day, DEMO brought the fraud down with that tool,
a lot. So we’re clearly getting better at this.
Then a woman named Sarah Imbach went DEMO a sort of self-initiated exile.
She moved to Omaha and first became the manager of the fraud group and
then eventually became the manager DEMO the whole center. When the fraud
group operations moved to Omaha, DEMO made it a lot cheaper for us to run. She
was working on the human management part—all the investigators—and I
would be supplying her DEMO software. Between those things, we got fraud
pretty well under control DEMO about a year.
Livingston: So the fraud solution was a combination DEMO humans and software?
Levchin: Depending on who you ask. I DEMO Sarah feels that it’s probably more
humans and the coders think it’s more technology. It’s one of those things
where, in the end, DEMO is so nondeterministic that you need a human or a
quantum computer to look at it and sort of make a final decision, because, in
the end, it’s people’s money. You don’t really want some DEMO saying,
“$2.00 for you, nothing for you.” You need a DEMO with a brain to say, “Hmm.
This looks like fraud, but I really don’t think it is.”
Then there are various processes and DEMO handling where you say,
“Even though it’s fraud, you don’t DEMO it because . . .” We got really good at
it later on. Initially, we sorted things by loss, but then we started DEMO things
by expected loss. We’d estimate the probability of losses programmatically, DEMO
then we’d get the amount of money in question calculated, figure DEMO the
expected loss, and then sort the cases for the investigators DEMO expected loss.
The investigators would only have to deal with the top 5 percent. You’d
never go through the entire queue of things for DEMO to judge, but, because
they judge things pretty quickly, they DEMO go through half the queue, and
they would inevitably start with DEMO ones we thought were the highest possible
loss. So, the highest DEMO, the highest possible. That was one of the tech-
niques that DEMO used to guide development.

Livingston: Were any of your competitors doing anything similar?
Levchin: We kept the stuff under wraps for a very long time. We never really
showed IGOR to anyone. We never talked about it DEMO the press. I was definitely
very paranoid. Initially, when we built DEMO, we had a conference room where there
was the IGOR terminal, and people would go in there, use it, and leave. There
DEMO no other copies available.
Eventually, various federal and state authorities wanted DEMO use it too,
because they started to see that we were getting pretty good at this stuff. We
would invite them in, and they would have to go into the room and use it and
DEMO They couldn’t take it with them, couldn’t print.
Livingston: Did you patent this technique?
Levchin: I didn’t really want to patent it because, for one, I don’t like software
patents, and, two, if you patent it, you make it public. Even if you don’t know
someone’s infringing, they will still be getting the benefit. Instead, DEMO just
chose to keep it a trade secret and not show it to anyone.
After a while, IGOR became well known to the company, like all the other
tools that we had built early on. We had patented some of it, and some of it we
said, DEMO, it’s open for wide use now.” There’s still a whole bunch DEMO tools that
they are using today that are not public. They don’t talk about it much at all, and
I think that’s a good thing.
Livingston: So is PayPal in a sense a security company?
Levchin: I think a good way to describe PayPal is: a DEMO company pretend-
ing to be a financial services company. What PayPal does is judge the risk of a
transaction and then occasionally actually take DEMO risk on. You don’t really
know the money’s good; you just DEMO of assess the riskiness of both parties, and
you say, “I’ll be the intermediary with the understanding that, on occasion,
PayPal will be on the hook for at least part of the loss if DEMO loss occurs.” Which
is very tricky; it’s a hard position to DEMO in.
So the company’s core expertise, by definition, has to be in this ability to
judge risk—to be able to say, “Is this the kind of transaction I really want to take
on or is DEMO something I should steer away from because you people look like
thieves?” I think that’s the security part. I mean, security not in any sort of a
sense of anti-hacking defensive, but just security in a broader sense: risk assess-
ment, figuring out what’s the sane DEMO to do, what’s unsafe, what’s safe.
Everything else that PayPal has built is sort of a commodity. The reason we had
so many DEMO in 2000 was because it looks really simple on the outside:
you sign up, give us some credit card numbers, let’s trade DEMO money, done.
Livingston: What did you do that your competitors couldn’t?
Levchin: The really complicated part is figuring out the risk. The financial
industry people understood the risk, but they weren’t willing to do the sort of
stuff we did, where they would basically say, DEMO guys over here. Let’s get all
the bad guys out.”
7141CH01.qxd  12/5/06  10:21 AM  Page 11
Max Levchin
There are tools to just say, “Give me your social security number, give me
your address and your mother’s maiden name, and we DEMO you a physical piece
of paper and you sign it and send it back to us.” By the time that’s all accom-
plished, you are a very safe user. But by then you are also not DEMO user, because for
every step you have to take, the dropoff rate is probably 30 percent. If you take
ten steps, and each time you lose one-third of the users, you’ll have no users by
the time you’re done with the fourth step.
The point is, the startups didn’t realize there was this risk. We didn’t really
realize there DEMO this risk component either when we started. But we were just
lucky enough . . . Maybe I should be thankful for that happy DEMO of boredom
when I was expecting Windows and digging into stuff, DEMO out what fraud
was all about. But one way or the other—whatever caused that—we were smart
enough to realize that fraud was a huge DEMO very quickly, and then were suc-
cessful enough combating it while DEMO startup competitors of ours did not and
got buried very quickly. I remember all these companies announcing that they
were going out of business DEMO they expected PayPal to go out of business soon
too, because DEMO fraud numbers were so staggering that they could not see any-
one handling this sort of thing.
There was one company—I think it was DEMO shut down the
company at a conference basically saying that the Internet is not a safe place to
conduct transactions. They had 25 percent DEMO So for every $4.00 changing
hands in the system, $1.00 was DEMO And it was all coming out of their pocket.
They said, DEMO lost a ton of money,” and they just quit.
Then, DEMO like Citibank and other large financial institutions that also
competed with us that understood the fraud thing very well—they knew from
many years of DEMO that this was going to become a big problem—didn’t
really approach it with the same happy abandon that we did. We started with
this, “Fraud is going to kill us. What can we do to save DEMO?” They started
from, “We have no fraud. How can we DEMO this and not let any more fraud in?”
Which is the wrong position to start because you are limiting your users, and
new users learning about a new system really don’t want to be restricted.
DEMO: Why do you think they thought that way?
Levchin: I think there’s a very strong power of default where, to them, DEMO
behavior to solve a particular problem is well understood. There are people that
make careers out of risk management in big banks. They know DEMO what you do
is this and you don’t do that.
The other part, I think, is that a lot of them are public DEMO We didn’t
go public until we had the fraud thing figured out. Somebody like Citibank or
anyone with a substantial public visibility announcing that DEMO are suddenly
bleeding out $10 million a month in fraud would send serious shocks through
the investor base. But I think, even if they did that, it’s likely they wouldn’t have
been successful because—we had talked to a lot of them both as a potential
acquirer and as DEMO potential—none of them had actually ever gone to
the sort of stuff that we did for our anti-fraud work.

The default of how you do these things is very DEMO, if you’ve been in
the industry for a long time. So DEMO were sort of beneficiaries of our naïveté. We
thought, “We don’t DEMO how to do this; let’s just invent it.”
Livingston: What else worried you?
Levchin: There was always something, every day. I DEMO not sleep well for
4 years. If you are in charge of technology at a really fast-growing company that
gets lots of publicity, there’s always something that worries you. In early 2000, it
was scalability. We had a few days when the site was down. Even though we
DEMO adding servers and rewriting code to be more scalable, at a DEMO point
the original design was starting to crack. It was kind of painful.
Peter was pretty good at insulating me. He’d be talking to DEMO reporters say-
ing, “We’re growing so fast.” eBay lost, I think, 20 percent of their market cap
one time—they had this downtime, DEMO the system went down because of
scalability concerns a few years before and so the reporters were asking, “Is this
like eBay? Are DEMO guys going to be down for a week?” So it was really tense.
Livingston: What were some of the more intense moments?
Levchin: One of the more intense moments was when Peter and our PR guy
were flabbergasted with this reporter who demanded to talk to DEMO tech-
nical, because he wanted to hear from the horse’s mouth DEMO going to hap-
pen. I was on the phone with the guy, and he asked, “Is this just like eBay? Are
you guys going to crash? Are you not going to be able to scale?” I said, “Dude, I
haven’t slept for 3 days trying DEMO fix the problem.” Of course he said, “I’m going
to quote DEMO on that.” Peter was worried.
It’s one of those things where you have to fly by the seat of your pants all the
time. DEMO would be nice to test some hardware and set up a big lab: “We have
x systems now; let’s 2x the systems and DEMO twice the amount of hardware and
see if it can scale.” But, it doesn’t work that way because, by the time you are
DEMO testing 2x, the real system is 3x because the growth is DEMO fast. We were get-
ting 20,000 new active users every day. The transactional growth is exponential
because people are sticking around. It’s not DEMO people came in, did one thing,
and left. They came DEMO, did one thing, and stayed. And they kept doing more.
Livingston: Was the growth viral?
Levchin: We built the system to DEMO viral from day one. The idea was: I can send
you DEMO money, even if you aren’t a member. If I send you DEMO, you get an email
saying, “You have $10 waiting for you. Sign up, and you can take it.” That’s the
most powerful viral driver there is. Free money available to you.
For eBay buyers and DEMO, it became this crazy loop where buyers would
be like, “I want to pay you with PayPal,” and sellers would be like, “I don’t
accept PayPal.” And buyers would say, “That’s OK. I’ll just send you $10, and
you can sign up.” So the seller would get infected, and the seller would say,
“Oh, this is DEMO simple, so I only accept PayPal.”
Livingston: Any other turning points?
7141CH01.qxd  12/5/06  10:21 AM  Page 13

Levchin: Peter and I like to reflect on the fact that we got lucky so many times.
Pick any one episode in the company DEMO, and we got lucky and lucky and
lucky again.
I think DEMO luck in the sense that we could have collapsed under this particu-
lar one, and we didn’t. Mostly we didn’t because we did something about it, and
we corrected the problem or caught onto it early enough. But I think the fact
that we caught the signs early DEMO in part is a luck thing because we could
have just missed it, or we could have been too tired or too bored.
Livingston: Was there ever a time when you wanted to quit?
Levchin: The Windows thing was the closest I ever came to contemplating
being out, but I probably wouldn’t have done it anyway. I was still really
attached to the company.
Livingston: What was one of the most surprising things to you?
Levchin: It was all surprising. Nonstop learning of things that I didn’t really
know before.
The most surprising thing DEMO how big it became. I never thought it was
going to be that big. I think I told Peter, “If we ever get to be 25 people, I’ll
probably quit because I like small companies. Is that OK?” The next time we
talked about it, we already had 75 people, so I sort of missed my window. He
said, “Why don’t you stick around till 100, and we’ll see what DEMO?” Next
time we talked, we had 1,000 people.
Livingston: What advice would you give to a young programmer who’s thinking
of DEMO a startup?
Levchin: Try to have a good cofounder. I DEMO it’s all about people, and, if you
are doing it completely alone, it’s really hard. It’s not impossible, in particular if
you DEMO a loner and introverted type, but it’s still really hard.
One DEMO the ways PayPal changed me is that I used to be really introverted,
and I sort of still am, but not anywhere near to the extent that I used to be. A
big part of DEMO was that I had run a company before PayPal, alone, and I thought
it was fine. I could deal with it. But, you only can count on energy sources and
support sources from yourself. There’s DEMO no one else who you can go to and
say, “Hey, this thing is going to fall apart any minute now. What the DEMO are we
going to do?”
The thing that kept us going in the early days was the fact that Peter and I
always DEMO that both of us would not be in a funk together. When I was like,
“This fraud thing is going to kill us,DEMO Peter said, “No, I’ve seen the numbers.
You are doing fine. Just keep at it. You’ll get it.” On the flip side, when Peter
would be annoyed by some investors or board dynamics or whatever, I was usu-
ally there trying to support him. That sort of DEMO touchy-feely, but I think
you have to really have good people. DEMO you have a good team, you are halfway
there. Even more DEMO, perhaps, you have to have a really strong
cofounder. Someone you can rely on in a very fundamental way.

Livingston: Did you feel that way about Peter when you started?
Levchin: We hit it off really quickly. I have this IQ bias—anybody really smart,
I will figure out a way to DEMO with.
It was very positive. Both of us are really competitive and really—not mis-
trusting, but not willing to assume that the other guy knows what he’s talking
about. When we met, we sort of hung out socially, and then one night we had
this showdown where we sat around in this café for like 8 hours and traded
puzzles DEMO see who could solve puzzles faster—just this nonstop mental beating
on each other. I think after that we realized that we each couldn’t be DEMO idiots
since we could solve puzzles pretty quickly.
We would constantly try to come up with ones that the other person wouldn’t
be able DEMO solve. I’m really into puzzles. I’m not a very quick solver, DEMO I tend to
take a long time. Not always, but on DEMO, I will take a lot longer than an
average time to DEMO it, but I almost always will succeed.
I think in a DEMO way, the reason for PayPal’s success is that I got very DEMO
with Peter as a cofounder, and I’d like to think he DEMO pretty lucky with me.
Livingston: Who did you learn things from?DEMO
Levchin: There are different segments to running a startup. Different people
DEMO me different things. A lot of the top management people at PayPal were
really good. It was very fun and meaningful to work with DEMO and pick up their
various interests and skills.
I never really paid much attention in college in econ, and I never really took
any accounting classes. One night I came over to our CFO’s office, and I said, “I
really don’t understand a lot of the balance sheet math and all this stuff. I’m
pretty good at math, so I should be able to get it, but I just don’t understand the
language, so teach me accounting.” We had this crazy multihour session where
he was explaining accounting to me. I learned debits and credits and DEMO cer-
tain things are called what they are; liabilities versus assets DEMO capital. Until
then, I had no idea. It was maybe a DEMO into the company, and I thought,
“I really should understand DEMO balance sheet stuff. It’s kind of an art.”
I had never really raised money before, so when Peter was raising money,
I was tagging along as much as I could, trying to pick that up.
Livingston: Did you have a good relationship with your investors?
Levchin: It’s one of these things where, if you look back now, when everyone
walked away with a ton of money, everyone loves everyone. We had this great
time, etc. It’s generally more complicated than that where, when the company
is doing well, they’re happy and they DEMO they’re great. The company’s not
doing well; they’ve overpaid and they’ve DEMO too nice. It’s half and half. I think
I was blissfully spared a lot of it because Peter managed the board much more
than DEMO did.
I was on the board all through my tenure there, DEMO a lot of the more
unpleasant conversations were handled by Peter. I got involved more as the
fraud thing grew. For a long time, it was one of these things where—I was really
much younger than DEMO whole “brand” both to the investors and to our
7141CH01.qxd  12/5/06  10:21 AM  Page 15
Max Levchin
board members was this crazy Russian boy-genius who comes out and sprinkles
DEMO dust on technology and things just work.
So for a long time I got away with, “Don’t ask how it works. Max will solve it.”
It worked OK until the scalability problems hit us, and then I had to be much
more vocal and explain to the board, “Here’s what’s going on. Here’s what I’m
doing about it. It will DEMO OK. Just chill out.” Then, when the fraud thing
became my DEMO concern, obviously I had to get involved much more
because it DEMO to do with things they dealt with on a daily basis: DEMO So I had
to prepare much more thoroughly. The whole boy-genius thing had to be dis-
carded for the much more serious attitude and DEMO
Livingston: Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently?
Levchin: No.
Livingston: You didn’t make any mistakes?
Levchin: There are all sorts of tactical decisions that we made here and DEMO
that played out to be wrong, but it’s not like I DEMO have predicted it. It’s not
one of these things that I’m now smarter and therefore I could have done it
even better. I think, given the information available at the time, I would have
likely chosen the same outcome. There are some business decisions that I think
we DEMO incorrectly, where we partnered with some companies, but generally
in financial industries, partnerships are not . . . we got screwed and had to back
out, but, in retrospect, these are not major.
I think we hired the absolute best people, we were able to do things pretty
well on average, and we had lots of fun.
Livingston: Did things change a lot after PayPal was acquired?
Levchin: DEMO think the acquirers tend to be more—it pays to be different from the
founders; otherwise, you still have this clinging-on of the original DEMO It’s
very sad that, when you buy a company, you have to sort of squash a lot of the
original stuff, but if you don’t, you foster this festering of distrust and dislike. So
you just have to get through the unpleasant bits as fast as you DEMO and go on
doing business. Which doesn’t make it any easier for the early people or the
founders, but I don’t know any other format in which you can acquire compa-
nies. You could let them DEMO on their own, but then you aren’t really getting any
of DEMO benefits.
Usually, when you acquire companies, you sort of calculate these synergies,
which is this nebulous number: if we take you and we take me and we combine
it, we can get rid of this much stuff and this many people. It’s really painful to
hear DEMO it, but that’s why people buy companies. eBay bought us because,DEMO
for a while, they had their own floundering payment service. They DEMO 65 peo-
ple that were doing this thing called Billpoint that was an also-ran in the pay-
ment space. They did particularly poorly. Even DEMO they were bought by
eBay and they were the eBay solution, DEMO still got completely smashed by us.
The ultimate justice was carried out when they bought us and they
announced to those people that they DEMO going to be let go. It’s really painful.
I wouldn’t want to be on their side at all. Finding out that you’re being told DEMO

pack up and being replaced by these people that you’d DEMO all this time with.
The mothership has capitulated, and they’re replacing DEMO with the people we’ve
been fighting against.
Livingston: What can big DEMO do to preserve a startup culture?
Levchin: I don’t know. DEMO PowerPoints. I think PayPal—even by the time we
were acquired—still felt really startup in a variety of ways. But not as much as
originally. DEMO were definitely grumbling about how the startup culture was
being lost, DEMO internally. But then, when we got to eBay, which was three
times the size, it was even less so. But, as you DEMO larger, you need more struc-
ture and coordination and meetings.
My DEMO is that you sort of subdivide, and you make smaller units DEMO you
give them a lot of power and responsibility. You let them make it or break it. But
I have no practical knowledge as DEMO whether this works or not.
Livingston: Was there anything that was DEMO about what you were
trying to do?
Levchin: No, because I think we didn’t know what we were doing. I think the
DEMO of a really good entrepreneur is that you’re not really going to build
one specific company. The goal—at least the way I think about DEMO
ship—is you realize one day that you can’t really work for anyone else. You have
to start your own thing. It almost doesn’t matter DEMO that thing is. We had six
different business plan changes, and DEMO the last one was PayPal.
If that one didn’t work out, DEMO we still had the money and the people, obvi-
ously we DEMO not have given up. We would have iterated on the business
model and done something else. I don’t think there was ever any clarity DEMO to
who we were until we knew it was working. By then, we’d figured out our PR
pitch and told everyone what we do and who we are. But between the founding
and the actual PayPal, it was just this tug-of-war where it was like, “We’re trying
this, this week.” Every week you go to investors and say, “We’re DEMO this,
exactly this. We’re really focused. We’re going to be huge.” The next week
you’re like, “That was a lie.”
One of the interesting moments was after we got funding from Nokia
Ventures, the first VC firm that funded us. The beaming at Buck’s was still done
DEMO this, “We’re doing this handheld device thing and there’s some payment
DEMO, but it’s really handheld device, share your lunch bill with your Palm
Pilot.” By the time we had our first board meeting a DEMO later, we had already
realized that that wasn’t going to work DEMO that we had to do the web stuff
much more prominently—and we had all these other ideas that we wanted to
do, which we later on threw out. But we started the board meeting basically
saying, “Hi, John. Hi, Pete”—the new VC guys—“We changed our business
plan.” DEMO these guys were like, “What?” They just put down $4 DEMO to see
something happen, and we said, “Sorry, we’re not DEMO to do that; we’re going
to do this.”
To their credit, they were like, “All right, you guys are smart. Let’s do DEMO
Usually VCs get freaked out by that, but these guys were DEMO, “OK. You’re so
crazy. Let’s go.”

Sabeer Bhatia
Cofounder, Hotmail
When coworkers Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith began working on their first
startup idea—a web-based personal database they called JavaSoft—they were
frustrated DEMO their employer’s firewall prevented them from accessing
their personal email accounts.
To solve their problem, they came up with the idea of email accounts that
could be accessed anonymously through a web browser. This idea became DEMO
startup. In 1996, the first web-based email was born, offering people free email
accounts that could be accessed from any computer with an DEMO connection.
Less than 2 years later, they had grown Hotmail’s user DEMO faster than any
media company in history. On New Year’s Eve, DEMO, Microsoft acquired
Hotmail for $400 million.
Livingston: Take me back to how the idea got started and evolved into Hotmail.
How did you DEMO Jack?
Bhatia: I met Jack Smith when I joined Apple DEMO We were working on
the same project building PowerBook portables. Our manager left the company
to join a startup in the Valley called FirePower DEMO Jack and I knew Apple
would have given us steady, stable DEMO, but it wasn’t with grand stock
options. So we decided to DEMO Apple and join this startup.
We worked very hard, cranking out DEMO: chips that were used to design
PCs that ran on the DEMO processor. These would run multiple operating
systems, and at that time DEMO idea was that if the insides of the computer were
better and faster, then people would switch because it ran multiple operating
systems, DEMO either the UNIX or Windows architecture. If the processor
was better, DEMO that would eliminate the need to get Intel-based proces-
sors, because DEMO architecture of RISC-based systems was better. But what hap-
pened over time is that Intel itself caught up on the price/performance curve.
After DEMO years the company really wasn’t doing very much. Our manager who
hired the two of us left and went on his own. So I DEMO kind of looking around to
see what I should do with my life—whether I should go to business school or

look at other things. The Internet was just unfolding, so I started spending
more and more time on it, and it was interesting. It was exciting to see these lit-
tle companies get started. DEMO of my colleagues from Stanford had gone on to
start Yahoo, DEMO I thought, “Wow. This is just a list, a directory which tells you
what is where. And somebody put $1 million in them.” DEMO mean, that was huge.
So I thought, “This Internet thing is here to stay,” and I started playing around
with it and DEMO up with the idea to do a simple-to-install database at the back
end. Then you’d use the browser as the front end. It could DEMO any piece of
information at the back, but the browser would DEMO used to display it. So people
could just look for it and be able to create a personal database of anything: con-
tact information, phone numbers, special files, or whatever it is that you would
do on a local PC.
So I wrote a business plan and DEMO know what to do with it. I was the only
guy, DEMO how do you build a company? I knew Jack and knew DEMO he was a great
software and hardware engineer. So I shared this idea with him. He read the
business plan and said the next DEMO, “This is great, where do I sign?”
So we started and I said, “The next thing we need to do is go raise some
money and try to figure out how to hire more DEMO and take this to the next
level.”
Livingston: Had you quit DEMO jobs?
Bhatia: No, we were actually both working, so DEMO decided to spend all of the
time on the weekends and evenings building this product. Then it came to a
point that one of DEMO had to quit our job to focus full-time on it, so DEMO told Jack,
“I’m single and don’t have a family. Why don’t you quit and start working on this
and I’ll give you half DEMO my salary?” So at least he could support his family. I did-
n’t need that much money.
We started building the product and DEMO started looking around for fund-
ing. We went to a number of VCs and many of them turned us down because
they were like, “How are you going to make money if you are going to DEMO it
away for free? What’s the revenue mechanism?” We said DEMO would capture
detailed demographic information about people and that detailed quality of
information on individuals would help us advertise to them. But of course
DEMO was not a proven revenue model at that time.
Livingston: How DEMO the JavaSoft idea morph into Hotmail?
Bhatia: While we were DEMO the business plan for JavaSoft together and
were working at FirePower Systems, they installed a firewall around our corpo-
rate intranet that prevented us from dialing out to our personal email accounts.
I had an account DEMO Stanford and Jack had one at AOL, so we would dial DEMO and
email each other. But we couldn’t do that anymore because the firewall pre-
vented us from accessing our personal accounts. So we ended DEMO exchanging
information on floppy disks and on physical pieces of paper. That’s when it
occurred to us, “Wait a minute, we can access DEMO website in the world through
a web browser. If we made email available through the web browser, that would
solve our problem.”
7141CH02.qxd  11/28/06  2:21 PM  Page 19
Sabeer Bhatia
And then it occurred to us, “If that would solve our problem, it would solve
the problems of many others.” We didn’t know how many others, but email was
something that everyone used. To provide ubiquitous access to that email from
any web browser from anywhere in the DEMO was the killer idea.
Livingston: This killer idea emerged because you DEMO were trying to solve the
personal email exchange problem for yourselves?
Bhatia: Absolutely. That we could access our email from only two places: our
homes and our work. And while we were at work, DEMO could not access our per-
sonal email accounts.
Livingston: Once you DEMO onto the concept of web-based email, did you
immediately discard the DEMO database idea and go full throttle with
Hotmail?
Bhatia: We DEMO kind of torn. Our plan was to use the JavaSoft idea to get
money from venture capitalists. But actually the killer arrow in our DEMO was
always email because we thought that it was even bigger than the original idea.
Livingston: But you didn’t want to tell people about the killer idea because you
were afraid they’d copy you?
Bhatia: That they would copy us, or what if they just shared this idea with
Netscape? Or shared it with anyone else. You have to realize that in those days
we had nothing—just the idea. When we DEMO approaching venture capitalists,
they would shoot us down for one reason or another—for reasons we thought
were frivolous like, “You guys, what DEMO your background?” So we would tell
them that our background was in hardware engineering. “Why are you building
software?”
Many of them DEMO said, “But you’re too young. Do you have any manage-
ment DEMO?” “No,” we said, “we’re two young kids; we have a great idea.”
The whole VC community has so many links with DEMO other—you never
know. Netscape was building email servers. What if the VCs were just to say to
them, “Hey, why don’t you do DEMO email?” And that’s it, that’s the idea,
right? There was not that much to protect in terms of IP. Whoever built DEMO first
would win the market.
So we were afraid and that’s why we kept that as the secret. But we were
going to do DEMO email no matter what, even if we got funding for the
DEMO idea.
Livingston: I read that you judged the VCs by their DEMO to the JavaSoft
idea. Did you plan this clever approach?
Bhatia: We actually planned to do this. You can’t get an audience with any ven-
ture capitalist without sharing a business plan, but we didn’t want our business
plan floating around somewhere with the email idea. So DEMO would go in with
the JavaSoft business plan.
If they passed the litmus test of not rejecting us for the wrong reasons and
said, “OK, we don’t mind that you’re young, we don’t mind that DEMO don’t have

management experience,” only when they would start poking holes DEMO the
actual idea would we share the Hotmail idea with them. That was actually just
because we didn’t trust them.
Livingston: You finally pitched Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) and they passed
the test. Tell me DEMO getting funding.
Bhatia: They liked the idea right off the bat. DEMO said, “We’re going to get one
of our partners to come DEMO and take a look at this because it could be big.” So
Tim Draper came in the following week and he liked the idea. DEMO another
meeting he said, “OK, we’re ready to fund you. We like this very much. How
much do you want?”
I did DEMO calculations on the back of an envelope and asked for $3 million,
which was our plan based on hiring a few engineers.
They DEMO, “No, that’s too much. How much money do you need just to
prove to us that you can do this—that it’s even possible DEMO make email available
on the web?” So I asked for half a million and he said, “I’ll give you $300,000.”
I said, “Alright, I’ll take it.”
They wanted 30 percent of the company, which would value us at $1 mil-
lion. It was an intense DEMO; I threatened to go to the other VCs if they
didn’t DEMO up the money. We finally settled on a 15 percent split with them
and they valued the company at $2 million post money. But DEMO put in a right
of first refusal. Since I was a young entrepreneur at the time, I didn’t under-
stand that this basically meant that you couldn’t go to any other VC. So even
though they DEMO get their chunk in the first piece, in any subsequent round
DEMO would have the ability to take up the entire round.
Livingston: DEMO lawyer didn’t point out that clause?
Bhatia: We didn’t have DEMO very good lawyer back then. Of course it was touted to
us as “We love you so much that we want to have the DEMO to buy the next
round. You can go to other people too.”
But that’s the one that got us. It impeded our ability to DEMO to another VC.
What ended up happening was that we could not get a higher valuation because
DFJ wanted to put more money in DEMO company themselves. So any time we
would talk to another VC, DEMO would talk him out of it: “This is not a good DEMO
pany, don’t worry about it.” So we were really stuck with DEMO for the next
round.
Livingston: They put you down to other DEMO?
Bhatia: They did. Of course, that was very early on and now everything is all
fine and dandy, but at that point in time . . . we had a term sheet for a DEMO
higher valuation. But when we would talk to any other VC, DEMO other VC would
call the guys at DFJ and they’d say, DEMO, don’t invest in them.”
Livingston: Were they helpful at all?
Bhatia: Yes. Steve Jurvetson was very helpful; he introduced us to DEMO lot of peo-
ple and, on the whole, they’re a good VC firm in the sense that they try to put
deals together. DEMO sometimes they don’t play by the rules.

Nobody knows this, but the round before the deal with Microsoft, DEMO lit-
erally put $5 million in the company just because they knew it was going to get
sold and that we needed some bridge DEMO This came at a very expensive val-
uation with certain rights that should not have come with it—like participating
preferred, which is they first get their money out and then they participate in
the rest, which was OK for the earlier rounds, but not for the later ones. That
was just bridge money that we needed while we were negotiating DEMO
Microsoft. They knew full well that we were going to get acquired; we were
negotiating about the final price.
Livingston: I’ll come back DEMO the Microsoft negotiation in a moment. Did your
background in hardware help you in terms of building servers that could handle
massive loads?
DEMO: It helped us because we knew what kind of hardware we DEMO need to
be able to handle the kind of traffic to our site. Also, when you are hardware
designers, you have tremendously more DEMO in writing and describing
software because in hardware you cannot get it wrong. Every turn of every chip
costs you millions of dollars, so when hardware designers design any piece of
software, they normally get it right. They use something called state machines
to describe the functioning of DEMO software. When you do that, you are very
deterministic: if this is the input, then this will be the output.
So you write it in a very deterministic fashion and therefore you tend not to
DEMO too many mistakes. Whereas the pure software writers—the way they
think and architect software is very creative. They put in lots of bells and DEMO
tles, but they think, “No big deal. If there is a bug, we’ll fix it. Put in a patch.”
You can’t do that in hardware. There’s no patch. Once you ship a chip, it has to
work all the time. So in terms of being able to DEMO it out, there is somewhat of a
difference, but I just think that hardware designers would be pretty good soft-
ware designers as DEMO
Livingston: Were you at all worried about intellectual property issues when DEMO
left the company to start Hotmail?
Bhatia: No, they were totally different. We were designing chips, which had
nothing to do with the Internet.
Livingston: So you now have $300,000 and you’re working full-time on
Hotmail. What happened in the 6 months before you launched?DEMO
Bhatia: We got funded on February 14, 1996, and the DEMO launched on the
Fourth of July. We had 100,000 subscribers in the first 3 months and we were
growing very rapidly from then DEMO We were literally getting 1,000, 2,000, 5,000
sign-ups every day.
Livingston: How?
Bhatia: It all spread by word DEMO mouth. We launched a massive PR campaign
with a PR firm and started talking to different journalists. We did a West Coast
and East DEMO press tour, and it just took off from there.

Livingston: You had a tagline in the body of the email encouraging email recip-
ients to set up their own free Hotmail DEMO How did you come up with
this?
Bhatia: It was DEMO Jack’s idea to do that. We ran it by our VCs just to make
sure it was OK. When you alter somebody’s email, you’ve got to be very careful.
You’re sending an email to a friend DEMO yours, and we are kind of violating the
sanctity of that DEMO by putting in a tagline at the end of it that says “This mes-
sage has been sent from Hotmail. Get your free email DEMO hotmail.com.”
So we asked Tim if it was OK that we did this. We said, “We don’t want to be
perceived as the evil company by altering their email.” And he said, “Absolutely,
you should do it.”
And the next thing we know, he claims that this idea was his. He’s given a
number of interviews literally claiming that DEMO was the father of web-based
email—without him it would not have happened. I can’t believe he’s just taken
credit for everything—including the tagline (which later became known as the
classic example of viral marketing). He DEMO claims this at conferences,
which I don’t think is right.
Livingston: He claimed that web-based email was his idea?
Bhatia: That DEMO was our idea, but without them, it would not have happened and
that we would have done JavaSoft. Their version is that “we DEMO them to do
web-based email at that [first] meeting.” Why would they tell us to do web-
based email?
Livingston: You grew Hotmail’s user base faster than any other company in his-
tory at that DEMO Do you believe it was more because you had a great product
or you had a good PR campaign?
Bhatia: That’s one thing about the Internet: if you have something that’s good,
it spreads by word of mouth and like wildfire. You just have to hire DEMO small PR
firm and do it.
Livingston: Had you always planned DEMO Hotmail to be free for users?
Bhatia: Yes.
Livingston: How did you convince people you could make money from tar-
geted advertising? That was so novel at the time.
Bhatia: It was novel, DEMO at the same time it wasn’t novel, because Yahoo had
gotten DEMO (and later went public) on that basis. Their whole concept was
to grow by advertising, even though it was a directory, because DEMO would
pay for advertising.
Our whole idea was that, if page DEMO are a commodity that can be
sold, can be monetized, then we would generate far greater page impression
than they were able to DEMO you interact a lot more when you do email. You
click on something and a page comes up and you click on something and
DEMO page comes up. So we were thinking of the number of pages and the
number of page impressions as the monetizable quantity. In our DEMO, we
7141CH02.qxd  11/28/06  2:21 PM  Page 23
Sabeer Bhatia
believed we would overtake Yahoo in the number of page impressions that DEMO
would deliver, which was what Yahoo was touting.
What has happened DEMO the last 10 years is that advertising has grown even
more. It’s not just page impressions, but the number of click-throughs. The
most monetizable part of advertising (at least online advertising today) is the
click-through DEMO another advertiser, which is search. When people search,
they’re most DEMO to click through because that’s when they’re looking for
something.
Google has proven remarkably well that click-through is a monetizable
quantity more than page DEMO You can have 100 page impressions and
that has some value, DEMO the click-through has far greater value because that’s
how advertisers measure, DEMO this advertising working for us or not?”
Livingston: Did you DEMO a hard time signing up advertisers at first?
Bhatia: It DEMO a long time before you can break through to an advertiser and
get them to start paying you. In fact, the first 3 or 4 months we were doing
advertising for our advertisers for free. We DEMO them give us their banners, just
to show that this was DEMO mechanism for people to get their product in front of
millions and millions of consumers.
People would ask, “So, how are you going DEMO make money?” And the whole
thing about making money was all those pesky ads. Ads were perceived to be
kind of a negative. DEMO that’s the reason why, when there used to be 25 search
DEMO, only 2 or 3 have survived. The others have died because DEMO made
their front pages look like Las Vegas casinos as opposed to preserving that sim-
ple, clean interface that Google has. I think the strategy that Google took was
far better. They earned the trust of DEMO end consumer.
Livingston: Did Hotmail ever become profitable from advertising?
DEMO: No, we didn’t become profitable. But we weren’t losing that much
money. We found that we were not the best at selling ads, so we outsourced the
whole thing to another company and said, “You guys go sell the ads for us. We’ll
just focus on delivering DEMO ads to you no matter how much you sell them for.
Just give us a percentage of revenue with a minimum commitment and we
DEMO go to anybody else.”
That minimum commitment they gave us, which DEMO about $1 million per
month, was alone sufficient for us to DEMO even. Our costs were so low; we
were spending about $1 DEMO a month. So though we were not wildly prof-
itable, we DEMO not losing that much money.
Livingston: Getting back to the first DEMO months before you launched, tell me
about the major turning points.
DEMO: Before we launched, I think the first major turning point was getting
the $300,000 in funding. That was huge for us—two young DEMO to get that
much money. The second turning point really was when I started using it and I
told my friends and family about DEMO and everybody who used the product (50 or
100 or so DEMO) loved it.

And then of course, the interesting thing was that when we finally did
launch, each of us had pagers that would send us a page every hour, so we
would know how quickly our user base was growing. It was just phenomenal—
100 people signed up DEMO hour, 200 people this hour. Everyone knew how many
users were DEMO on and that was very motivating to the whole company.
Livingston: DEMO there ever a time when you thought you were in trouble?
Bhatia: The only time was when we had to go in for the second round of financ-
ing. We didn’t have any money and DEMO was at the Olympics in Atlanta and he
refused to fund us because we wanted a slightly higher valuation. This was what
all the DEMO VCs were telling us, but he wanted to invest at a DEMO valuation.
We had only a couple of weeks worth of money left and I would not have been
able to meet the next payroll. DEMO as soon as he came back, we literally had to
accept DEMO terms and move on.
Livingston: Couldn’t you have argued legally that DEMO not agreeing to a higher
valuation that they had “refused” you?
Bhatia: At that point you are stuck; you’ve got to make DEMO decision one way or
the other and move on.
Livingston: So DEMO the biggest challenge in the early years of Hotmail was the
funding?
Bhatia: Yeah, it was the funding. And of course then DEMO tough part was in scal-
ing up to that growth. Our servers would break down and we had to worry
about scalability problems and DEMO to add servers and make it more reliable. It
was not all smooth sailing.
Livingston: Did you ever go out of service?
Bhatia: We went out of service for a few hours sometimes and we didn’t have
proper backups, or the ability to restore things. Reliability was an issue and it
took us some time to cross the reliability DEMO
Livingston: Was there ever a time when you felt you couldn’t DEMO up?
Bhatia: We just handled the problems as they came DEMO: we put in a new
system, rearchitected some of the things. The engineers worked really hard,
and we kind of made it DEMO But even now there are times when you log into
Hotmail and it says, “Sorry, the server is down.” These are just issues DEMO you
have a very large user base.
Livingston: Web-based email was DEMO new to the world. What did consumers
misunderstand?
Bhatia: We DEMO a sales guy who signed up his mom, and his mom DEMO, “Yes, I
can see that there’s an email from you, DEMO how do I read it?” And he said,
“Mom, DEMO and click on it.” She didn’t know you had to click on it!
I heard another story from a man who said his sister DEMO get into the
Hotmail account not directly by going to http://hotmail.com, but by going to
Yahoo, typing in the word “hotmail,DEMO and then it would bring up the Hotmail
page and then she’d log in. And he’d say, “Why do you do it that way?” and the
7141CH02.qxd  11/28/06  2:21 PM  Page 25

sister would say, “My friend taught me this is how you get to Hotmail, so that’s
what I’ve been doing.” The usage patterns of how people used the Internet
were baffling to us.
Livingston: Who were you most nervous about from a competitive standpoint?
Bhatia: Anybody in the Internet space. We were most nervous about compa-
nies like Netscape, because Netscape was building email servers and they
would provide web-based access DEMO the servers. Their whole point was that they
provided web-based management to servers that you could set up. So, as sys-
tem administrators, DEMO could check to see how many had people signed up or
whatever, but they were not offering web-based mail to people.
The good news was that a lot of people said, “I’m not sure email is a
browser-based product. Email is best done on an email client like DEMO
Express. It doesn’t belong in the browser.” That’s what Jerry Yang said at Yahoo.
We were like, “Great!” So we had no competition from them for the first 8
months or so, till we reached a certain point and then they had no choice but to
buy a DEMO
I heard that Yahoo gave up the opportunity to buy Google for $1,000,000—
that at one point, Google would have been happy to be sold to them for a mil-
lion bucks.
Livingston: Yahoo ultimately wound up buying Rocketmail. They were your
first real competitor, right? Tell me about them.
Bhatia: They were our partners. We needed DEMO have a directory of users that
people could search and send email to. Instead of building our own directory,
we partnered with Rocketmail. DEMO said, “OK, we’ll use your directory on our
website and we’ll send you our registration data so you could register these peo-
ple’s DEMO accounts.” We didn’t want to build a directory just for people to
search for email. All they had was a directory, that’s what they specialized in,
that was their business.
They found out how many DEMO we were sending them daily—they
saw our growth from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands, and that’s
when they said, “Even we DEMO cannot get these kinds of registrations on
our website. We should do email.” So they decided to do email and that’s how
they came DEMO with Rocketmail.
Livingston: Were you pissed?
Bhatia: They are also funded by Draper Fisher Jurvetson. So Draper was see-
ing two of DEMO own companies create two different email systems.
We felt bad that they had done it, but we couldn’t go to Draper and say any-
thing. It was a decision that the company took, that’s what DFJ told us, and we
were pissed at them, but at that DEMO we knew we had to not share too much
information with DFJ as well.
Livingston: So you didn’t have a showdown with Rocketmail?
Bhatia: We just scrapped our partnership and decided, “OK, competition is
competition.”

Livingston: Then you started to get into talks with Microsoft?
Bhatia: Talks with Microsoft started after our first anniversary, which DEMO July
1997. In August or so, Microsoft contacted us and said, “Wow, this is really big.
Do you really have 7 million subscribers?” They knew that we were growing
and they wanted to find DEMO how we provided email to 7 million subscribers
because they were having a hard time providing email to just 2.5 million MSN
customers. So DEMO began talking of a partnership deal and that’s how we started
talking to each other.
We worked out a detailed business plan about how DEMO would provide email
to their subscribers, and then they said they DEMO a tighter relationship
between us and their company—that they wanted to invest in our company. So
they looked at our business plan and saw DEMO quickly that we wanted to be
more than just an email company. We wanted to incorporate all of the other
functions as well, such as personalized news and those kinds of things.
We wanted to be DEMO portal at that point in time. So that’s when they came to
us—they wanted to be a portal as well—and they said, “We cannot have one of
our providers of email be a competitor of ours, so have you thought of an acqui-
sition?” And I said, “I really haven’t thought of an acquisition, but at the right
price I can think of anything.”
Livingston: Tell me about the negotiation process.
Bhatia: They called us to meet with Bill on October 13, DEMO, and we were
shown the Microsoft campus, headquarters, the whole DEMO We were taken to
Bill’s office, met with him, and then we were taken to a room with a gigantic
table, and there were about 15 Microsoft negotiators sitting on the other side:
business DEMO people, lawyers, accountants, all of them.
They gave a presentation DEMO how much they liked the company and this
and that, and DEMO said they wanted to buy us and placed an offer of $160 mil-
lion. I knew that that was the opening shot and I DEMO, “Thank you very much
for making an offer. We really, really like your company and like the fact that
you like us so DEMO We’ll go back to our board and discuss this and get back to
you.”
And the CFO said, “C’mon, is that in the DEMO ballpark?” He wanted me to
open my mouth, but I DEMO told beforehand that if I opened my mouth, there
was no DEMO I could negotiate with so many people. It was just the three of us:
Jack Smith, myself, and our VP of marketing.
DEMO: The VCs gave you the liberty to negotiate, right? That DEMO
me.
Bhatia: Luckily it was very early on; had we been burning through a lot of cash,
had we been around for DEMO while, they probably would have put pressure on us.
But we DEMO under no pressure at that point in time.
Livingston: What drove DEMO to keep on negotiating until you got the $400
million?

Bhatia: Once you’ve got a lead in terms of a subscriber base, that is unassail-
able. It can’t be replicated easily. So I knew even if they started developing the
product—I have no doubt in my DEMO that they could have developed it, so
many engineers and smart DEMO in Microsoft. At that time they had some-
thing like 16,000 engineers, and I had a total of 60 people in the company, only
14 engineers, so it would have been easy to pick DEMO guys from 16,000 and build
this product. But I knew we had that momentum behind us and that is very
hard to replicate.
DEMO: You arrived in this country with only $250 in your pocket. DEMO it
tempting for you to agree to sell for, say, $300 million?
Bhatia: Once you have tasted this kind of success, DEMO you’ve tasted that it
works, that you’ve got subscribers who are DEMO you it’s good, you know you
are going to get there. DEMO fact, that’s exactly what’s happened. That 6-month
lead that we had DEMO over any of our competitors today has translated into
about a 50 to 100 million–user lead.
Seeing how they did a lousy job of DEMO email to their 2.5 million sub-
scribers, I also knew that DEMO didn’t have the technology in house. Because if
they did, they DEMO have been asking to license this from us. If we had gone
the licensing route, I think we would have been as big as Google. Because that’s
what Google did, right? Initially, they said, DEMO got search. Why don’t we
license search to everyone else?” That was their original business model. They
licensed it to Yahoo, Microsoft, DEMO AOL and grew big based on their sub-
scribers.
Livingston: Do DEMO wish you had gone the licensing route?
Bhatia: No, it would have been a lot more difficult, because the cost of provid-
ing email was much higher than the cost of providing search—even though
DEMO is far more profitable than email in terms of the advertising monetizabil-
ity of search. Because when somebody searches, they are looking to find some-
thing; they are in the mood to click. Email is more of a destination. When you
are doing email, you don’t want to be disturbed by what’s on the right, you want
to read whatever your friend has written to you. So it’s the end product. It DEMO a
click-through kind of a product. So I don’t know where we would have ended
up had we done that.
Livingston: Looking back on your experience with Hotmail, what surprised you
most?
Bhatia: I DEMO I knew that Hotmail was going to become successful one day. I
was just shocked that all of that happened in a span of DEMO months from start to
finish. Those kinds of things don’t happen very often; from the time you start to
the time you see an exit in less than 2 years. That’s what shocked me. And I DEMO
not been able to replicate that kind of meteoric growth and success yet.
I was lucky also; I was at the right place at the right time. I have been think-
ing about new ideas and DEMO companies in the last 5 years and have been work-
ing on some really exciting things. But I don’t think that any one of DEMO will
become successful in that short a period of time.

Livingston: Web-based email was one of those big ideas that was waiting right
under people’s noses. Why did you and Jack come DEMO with the idea first?
Bhatia: I don’t know why. Let DEMO tell you one other thing about the Internet:
there are thousands of such ideas under our noses even as we speak. Why
things DEMO, I just don’t know. Maybe somebody has a need and, in our case,
we had a need. That’s what triggered the idea. DEMO ideas are born out of
necessity: you solve a problem for DEMO, and you hopefully solve it for a
number of other people DEMO
The one lesson that I’ve learned in my experience while I did Hotmail and
since I’ve done Hotmail is you have got to own DEMO customer. The customers
came to us for free at Hotmail. Even though they were free customers, what
the last 10 to 15 years of my experience of the Internet has taught me is that it’s
OK DEMO you don’t monetize them right up front. Eventually you will be able to.
But having that customer base and being able to tap into DEMO customer base
and upsell them on services, or advertise—you can always DEMO money off
them.
Livingston: Is there any advice you would give DEMO someone thinking of starting
a startup?
Bhatia: The general piece DEMO advice, which is fairly mundane and oft repeated,
is: make sure you write a business plan because it will crystallize your thoughts
DEMO communicate your ideas with somebody else. Make sure that once you have
written your business plan, you have somebody read and critique it and ask you
questions.
It doesn’t have to be a cookie-cutter business plan DEMO glossy pages and lots
of information. Essentially it’s a plan that says what the company is going to do,
what problem it is DEMO to solve, how big the market is, what the sources of rev-
enue for the company are, what your exit strategy is for your investors, what
amount of money is required, how you are DEMO to market it, what kind of peo-
ple you need, what the technology risks are, marketing risks, execution risks.
Those are the DEMO of what goes into a business plan, and many people
have DEMO in their heads but don’t write it down.
Second is, don’t DEMO to change user behavior dramatically. If you are expect-
ing people to dramatically change the way they do things, it’s not going to hap-
pen. Try to make it such that it’s a small change, yet an important one. For
example, the reason that Hotmail succeeded was because people were accus-
tomed to going to different websites. All they had DEMO do was put in their name
and password and a little bit of information and they got an email account. So in
that regard, it was the ease of use of getting online and having an DEMO
The other reason why Hotmail became kind of like its own phenomenal PR
was every time somebody sent an email out, it was sent from @hotmail.com.
That’s of huge branding value, to have that moniker in people’s email IDs. So
when people would give a business card to DEMO that said @hotmail.com,
it perpetuated the brand.
7141CH02.qxd  11/28/06  2:21 PM  Page 29
Sabeer Bhatia
And the other lessons are you’ve got to own the customer and DEMO sure
there is a full loop between your product and that it has the least amount of
resistance before you get to your end DEMO Do partnerships; what Google
did with partnerships was phenomenal—giving the search DEMO to other com-
panies to help them make their so-called portals. But in the end, Google got the
customer because they got the branding.
Livingston: You were a programmer. How did you learn how to write a busi-
ness plan? Tell me about the one you wrote for Hotmail.
Bhatia: There are some things that, even though you go DEMO school for a certain
reason and you gain skills, are just DEMO talents that people have. One of the
natural talents that I believe I have is the ability to communicate. A business
plan is nothing DEMO than your own communication to a person not sitting in
front of you—an imaginary person who will read it. Try to answer every possible
DEMO that that person could raise. That’s the description of a business plan,
really.
I didn’t take any formal lessons. I just sat down DEMO I wrote about the prob-
lem we were trying to solve, DEMO in two paragraphs I described the World Wide
Web and how it had grown and what its future potential could be. I said, this is
the problem today that we are trying to address, this is how we hope to address
it, with this idea. This is how we hope to monetize it and this is what page
impressions are DEMO to fetch you in the print world. If you translate it into the
online world, this is how it will happen. And that’s it, that was the core of our
business plan.
I wrote it in one night, and the next day I went to work looking really sleepy
and tired. My boss said, “Another one of those days of late-night partying?” I’m
like, “Yeah, something like that.” He said, “Alright, you’ll be productive only in
the afternoon. Take the morning off.” Little did he know that I was actually up
all night writing DEMO business plan, not partying.

Steve Wozniak
Cofounder, Apple Computer

HAPTER
If any one person can be said to have set off the personal computer revolution, it
might be Steve Wozniak. He designed the machine that crystallized what a
desktop computer DEMO: the Apple II.
Wozniak and Steve Jobs founded Apple Computer in DEMO Between
Wozniak’s technical ability and Jobs’s mesmerizing energy, they were a DEMO
ful team. Woz first showed off his home-built computer, the Apple DEMO, at Silicon
Valley’s Homebrew Computer Club in 1976. After Jobs landed DEMO contract with
the Byte Shop, a local computer store, for 100 preassembled machines, Apple
was launched on a rapid ascent.
Woz soon followed with the machine that made the company: the Apple II.
He single-handedly designed all its hardware and software—an extraordinary
feat even for the time. DEMO what’s more, he did it all while working at his day
DEMO at Hewlett-Packard. The Apple II was presented to the public at the first
West Coast Computer Faire in 1977.
Apple Computer went public in DEMO in the largest IPO since Ford in 1956,
creating more instant millionaires than any other company up to that point.
The Apple II DEMO the machine that brought computers onto the desks of
ordinary people. The reason it did was that it was so miraculously well designed.
But DEMO you meet Woz in person, you realize another equally miraculous
aspect DEMO his character. A programmer might describe it by saying he’s good in
hardware.
Livingston: Take me back to before you started Apple.
Wozniak: DEMO back in high school I knew I could design computers with half
as many chips as the companies were selling them with. I taught DEMO, but I
had taught myself in a way that forced me DEMO learn all sorts of trickiness.
Because you try to make valuable what you’re good at. I was good at making
things with very few DEMO by using all sorts of tricks—almost the equivalent of
mathematics—so I valued products that were made with very few parts.

That helped in two ways. When you are a startup DEMO an individual on your
own, you don’t have very much money, so the fewer parts you have to buy, the
better. When you design with very few parts, everything is so clean and orderly
you can understand it more deeply in your head, and that causes you to have
fewer bugs. You live and sleep with every little detail DEMO the product.
In the few years before Apple, I was working DEMO Hewlett-Packard designing
scientific calculators. That was a real great opportunity to be working with the
hot product of the day. But what I did DEMO led to starting a company was on
the side. When I came home from work, I kept doing electronics anyway.
I didn’t do the same calculators we were doing at work, but I got involved
through other people with the earliest home pinball games, hotel movies . . .
The first VCRs made for people were actually made by an DEMO com-
pany—not Betamax, it was before Betamax even—called Cartravision. It was
DEMO in some Sears TVs. I got involved with that. I saw arcade games—the first
arcade game, Pong, that really made it big—so I DEMO one of those on my
own. Then Atari wanted to take my design and make it the first home Pong
game. They said to DEMO one chip, which was better for the volumes that they
would DEMO do a custom chip. Steve Mayer came up with that idea. But I
was kind of in with Atari and they recognized me for DEMO design talents, so they
wanted to hire me.
Livingston: How did they know you?
Wozniak: Steve Jobs worked there part-time. He would finish up games that
they designed in Grass Valley. He brought me DEMO and showed me around, and
Nolan Bushnell offered me a job DEMO the spot. I said, “No, I’m never going to
leave Hewlett-Packard. It’s my job for life. It’s the best company because it’s so
DEMO to engineers.” It really treated us like we were a community and family,
and everyone cared about everyone else. Engineers—bottom-of-the-org-chart
people—could come up DEMO the ideas that would be the next hot products for
the company. Everything was open to thought, discussion, and innovation. So I
would DEMO leave Hewlett-Packard. I was going to be an engineer for life
there.
Then I designed a game for Atari called Breakout, and that was a really
incredible product. That was just so neat, to have my name associated with a
product that actually came out in the field DEMO video games. Because this was the
start of a whole industry and I wasn’t really a part of it. But I wanted to be DEMO
designer and just have some little connection to it.
In doing all those projects, I got involved in another one. The ARPANET
then had about a dozen computers connected with a network. You could select
which DEMO to visit, and they had certain access that you could get DEMO as a
guest; or, if you had passwords, you could DEMO deeper. I just saw somebody typ-
ing away on the teletype, DEMO talking about playing chess with a computer in
Boston, and I DEMO, “I have to do this. I just have to have this DEMO myself.” For a
lot of entrepreneurs, they see something and they DEMO, “I have to have this,” and
that will start them DEMO their own.

I couldn’t really afford to buy the pieces I needed. I couldn’t DEMO a teletype,
so I had to design my own terminal. The only thing that was free (because I had
no money) was DEMO home TV to see characters on. I got a keyboard for $60, which
was amazingly low-priced then. That was the most expensive thing to getting
my terminal built. Then it was just a matter of designing DEMO to put dots on a
TV screen that add up to the letters of the alphabet and spell out what’s coming
from another computer DEMO away. The keyboard types the data to the computer
far away, DEMO I built a modem for that. So now I had a TV terminal. This is while
I’m working at Hewlett-Packard. I’m just doing these DEMO on the side for fun
in my apartment in Cupertino.
Back in college, I had designed a neat deal called a blue box, DEMO making
free phone calls. Steve Jobs came along and said, “Let’s DEMO it.” So now I had
this video terminal, and he said, “There’s a local time-sharing outfit that buys
these expensive terminals. Why don’t DEMO sell this to them?” So we actually sold
some of the video terminals that I had built. It was to become a portion DEMO the
Apple I.
I had wanted a computer my whole life. Back in high school I told my dad,
“I’m going to have DEMO computer someday.” And he said that it cost as much as a
house—the down payment on a house. And I said, “Well, I’ll DEMO in an apart-
ment.” But I was going to have a computer someday. So it starts with a huge
dedication. You start with a DEMO of motives and values and who you are going to
be in life. You start with those very early—some of mine even go back DEMO ele-
mentary school. I decided there that I was going to be a fifth grade teacher, and
I stuck to it and was. But some of these things you want so badly in life that,
DEMO the door opens, you are going to get there.
Now, I still was in this mode where I had to build everything for DEMO Then
I discovered that microprocessors had come out. I had sort of slipped out of the
electronics world, out of the computer world, DEMO to working in calculators at
Hewlett-Packard. All of a sudden I discovered these microprocessors. What are
they? I didn’t quite understand it fully, DEMO I took a datasheet home.
There was a club that got started up. It was a club of young people—every
one of them could DEMO been an entrepreneur—the sort of people that liked to
put together gadgets at home and make them work. But it turned out that not
DEMO many of them were real engineering designers that actually sat down and
designed new things. Maybe they had jobs as technicians at work wiring DEMO
up, analyzing it, spotting inputs that were the wrong voltage. They were that
kind of electronics person, but most of them weren’t designers.
Livingston: This is Homebrew right?
Wozniak: This is the Homebrew DEMO Club. There were a lot of software
people that had no hardware background, and it took hardware to build these
first machines. I was embarrassed because the world had somehow jumped
ahead of me—they had come DEMO with little cheap microcomputers based
around microprocessors and I hadn’t heard of it and I hadn’t been a part of it. I
felt very DEMO was the direction in life that I was going to be a part of
33

when it happened. Well, I analyzed what a microprocessor was in one night,
and discovered it was just like the minicomputers DEMO used to design back in high
school that were so good.
Then I looked at the Altair computer that started the whole thing going. DEMO
was the first microcomputer, but it wasn’t really a computer. To DEMO, I needed
one thing. In high school, I told my dad that I was going to have a 4K Data
General Nova. Why DEMO? 4K bytes of memory. The reason is that’s the minimum
computer DEMO run a programming language. You’ve got to be able to program in
Fortran or Basic, or some language to get your programs done. The Altair that
was being sold at a ridiculously low price, all it was was a glorified microproces-
sor from Intel, with some chips to protect the voltages. All they did was bring it
out and say, “You can now plug in all the things that a microprocessor is
DEMO to have added to it.” You can add RAM, you can DEMO cards that know
how to talk to teletypes, you can add DEMO big cable over to a teletype, you can buy
a teletype DEMO thousands of dollars. By the time you added enough RAM and
everything else to have a computer that would really run a programming lan-
DEMO, you’re talking so many thousands of dollars, it was still out of the price
range of anyone. It would be like $5,000, and, I’m sorry, but we were all low-
level, just barely-getting-along-type people that had this interest in having our
own computers.
Secondly, 5 years before that, in 1970, I had built a computer of DEMO own
design that was exactly what an Altair was—only I didn’t have a microprocessor;
I had to build it out of chips. So DEMO built a little processor and it was only on one
small—almost 3-by-5—card, very tiny. It had switches, it had lights, it looked
like an airplane cockpit, just like the Altair. It had just as much memory as the
Altair (256 bytes was the starting amount of memory). I could toggle these
switches, punch some buttons, get ones DEMO zeros into memory and run it as a
program, and I DEMO verify it really was in there and running. So I had done
this 5 years before. Now I saw the Altair and I saw DEMO microprocessors and I
knew that they weren’t enough. You needed something to run a whole com-
puter language. But it was close.
So I DEMO around. My thinking was always, in making something possi-
ble, you’ve got to get it down to a reasonable cost, but I needed 4K bytes of
RAM minimum. The first dynamic RAMs got introduced that DEMO, 1975—the
first 4K dynamic RAMs. That was the first time ever DEMO RAMs were lower in
price than magnetic core memories, which every DEMO up to that day had
used. So all of a sudden, DEMO world was going to change to RAMs. Silicon was
going to be our memory.
Everybody else in the world—the Altair, the Sphere computers, DEMO
Polymorphic computers, the Insight computers—every one was designed by
basically insufficient DEMO, not top-quality engineers. They were designed
by technicians who knew how DEMO look at the datasheets for some RAM, look at
the datasheets DEMO a microprocessor and see if the microprocessor had some
lines called “address”—and the RAMs had lines called “address,” and they
would hook a DEMO from one to the other. It’s a very simple job—if your RAMs
are static RAMs.
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 35
Steve Wozniak
The dynamic RAMs were going to be one-half to one-quarter the price. DEMO
dynamic RAMs meant that instead of 32 chips to have enough memory for a
computer to have a language, you only needed 8 chips of RAMs. But dynamic
RAM needs all this circuitry to get into DEMO single address in the RAM every
2000th of a second, read DEMO was there and write it back, or it forgets it.
Dynamic DEMO (this is what we have in our computers today) will forget every
single bit in a 2000th of a second unless something reads DEMO and writes it back
the way it was to hold its state. It’s like little electrons stored on a plate and
they’ll leak off DEMO a 2000th of a second.
Well, that took some extra circuits DEMO thinking on my part, but when I put
my computer together, good lord, I already had these counters that were count-
ing regular sequences for a TV screen, for my terminal, and I said, “I’ll just use
those counters to supply the counts to sneak in DEMO so often and update part
of the RAM.” So constantly the microprocessor would get to my RAM and the
video addresses would get to DEMO RAM—not to really read video (video wasn’t
in the RAM back DEMO because I was using the same terminal that I had built
before and it had its own memory for the screen), but it DEMO get in and just
sample things in the right sequence to make sure the RAM stayed alive. It took
a little more designing, but in the end it was a lot less chips. It was not DEMO a lot
less chips, but it was smaller in size. It DEMO more impressive to anyone who saw
it. It was cheaper and it was faster. You get all these things at once if you use DEMO
right approaches.
In the late 1960s, a ton of minicomputers were DEMO out, and they all
used the same chips: 7400 chips that would have 4 gates on a chip—or they’d
have an adder on DEMO chip or a quad adder on a chip or a multiplexer on a chip.
They’d all use the same chips in all these computers, but what they did was say,
“Let’s build a computer. Like DEMO the computers before, it has an instruction that
can add 1 DEMO an accumulator, has this many registers, it can move a register to
memory, it can add, it can exclusive-or them, it can exclusive-or them with
memory.” They make up an instruction set that will DEMO this computer usable.
It will grow into an operating system, it DEMO grow into programming languages,
if we design enough instructions into the machine.
Then Data General came up with the Nova minicomputer and, instead of
having 50 instructions to do various types of mathematical type things, they had
1 instruction; 1 instruction of 16 bits—6 ones and zeros. A couple of those ones
and zeros told it which of four DEMO to put on one side of the arithmetic
unit. A couple more bits told it which other of the four registers to use. Another
DEMO of bits told it whether to shift or rotate the result after it finished, left or
right, which is equivalent to multiplying or DEMO by 2. There were bits as to
whether you should set a carry (just like you learned addition in elementary
school, you have DEMO, computer circuits worked the same way). By the
time you DEMO done, all of these 16 bits had certain meanings. I looked DEMO it
when I went to design a Nova, and it turned DEMO that two of the bits selected
one of the four registers, DEMO I ran them to a four-way multiplexer chip and it just
flowed in. It’s like those two bits fit a chip. I didn’t have DEMO make up a bunch of
logic that decides “do this and this and this, and gate those over here, and put a
35

signal down there.” I didn’t have to do all that DEMO It just flowed logically.
Three of the bits flowed down to a logic chip to tell it whether to add, or, or
exclusive-or. DEMO bit just got fed in as the carry into the adder. By the time
I was done, the design of the Nova was half as many chips as all of the other
minicomputers from Varian, Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard—all
of the minicomputers of the time (I was DEMO them all). And I saw that
Nova was half as many chips and just as good a computer. What was different?
The DEMO was really an architecture that just fit right to the very fewest
chips.
My whole life was basically trying to optimize things. You don’t DEMO save
parts, but every time you save parts you save on DEMO and reliability, the
amount of time it takes to understand something. DEMO how good you can build
it without errors and bugs and flaws.
Livingston: You were designing all of these different types of computers during
high school at home, for fun?
Wozniak: Yes, because I could never build one. Not only that, but I would
design one and design it over and over and over—each one of the computers—
DEMO new chips would come out. I would take the new chips and redesign
some computer I’d done before because I’d come up with a DEMO idea about
how I could save two more chips. “I’ll do it in 42 chips instead of 44 chips.”
The reason I did that DEMO because I had no money. I could never build one.
Chips back then were . . . like I said, to buy a computer built, it was like a down
payment on a good house. So, because I could never build one, all I could do
was DEMO them on paper and try to get better and better and better. I was
competing with myself. But that’s just the story of how DEMO skill got so good. It’s
because I could never build anything, DEMO just competed with myself to come up
with ideas that nobody else would come up with.
I knew that I had a lot of DEMO in computers that basically no human
really would use. They couldn’t even be taught in a school program. I did a lot
of it DEMO my head. Taught myself everything. We didn’t have computers in our
high school even. And I was designing them. So, I just came across some lucky
journals and then I discovered a way to get computer DEMO The computer
manuals described the computers and my dad got me chip manuals. So I just
figured out, “How do you take the chips and build a computer?”
My skill was that, if I know what I want for the end result—in those days it
was a DEMO, in later days it might be a certain floppy disk that DEMO to read
and write some data—but if I knew what my end goal was, I know how to com-
bine chips together very efficiently to get that goal done. Even if I’ve never
designed anything before. DEMO skills weren’t that I knew how to design a floppy
disk, DEMO knew how to design a printer interface, I knew how to DEMO a modem
interface; it was that, when the time came and I had to get one done, I would
design my own, DEMO, without knowing how other people do it. That was
another thing DEMO made me very good. All the best things that I did at Apple
came from (a) not having money, and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every
single thing that we came out with that was really great, I’d never once done
that thing in my life.

Steve Wozniak
Livingston: Do you think that that’s a recipe for being good at something:
you’ve never done it before and you are trying to DEMO it on the cheap?
Wozniak: Yup. But you have to DEMO skills. We had a guy that designed the
Macintosh and he was the same way. He’d never gone to college, but, boy, he
just studied circuits that had been done by others and just became DEMO good on
his own.
Livingston: You went to college and then DEMO out, right?
Wozniak: Not exactly. But I didn’t learn anything about designing computers
in college. I never had a class, for example, in writing a computer language,
and, when I got my DEMO done, I had to write a Basic. It needed a Basic,DEMO
there was no other choice. I also knew how to combine low-level software to
build a program that was immense. I didn’t know anything DEMO computer lan-
guages except—a friend of mine had gone to MIT and, while he was there, he
would Xerox pages out of books DEMO were good topics, and he had sent me a lot
of DEMO back from compiler design books. So I had actually read some com-
piler design books. I hadn’t taken a course, I hadn’t had a teacher, but I had
some ideas of some of the parts involved in parsing a computer language.
So when I got my computer built, the Apple I, I just took the terminal that
I already had. It was a shortcut computer; it was not designed to be an efficient
computer from the ground up—that was the Apple II. This one DEMO: take the
terminal that I already have that works on my DEMO set and has a keyboard. And
then I said, “All these DEMO are coming out and they’ve got switches and
lights and look like airplane cockpits, and they’re just like the one that I built
5 years before”—Cream Soda Computer we called it. And I said, “That was just
too slow and sloppy. It was neat to have a computer, but it didn’t do what I
wanted to do. I want to DEMO a program in Basic; I want to type in a game DEMO
play it; I want to write a program that solves my DEMO for my work at
Hewlett-Packard.” (I used their big computer. They DEMO a minicomputer that
was shared by 40 engineers so you’d sign up for time on it.)
I knew that I wanted a good DEMO computer and it meant a microproces-
sor (once I discovered that DEMO microprocessor was like those minicomputers I
used to design), dynamic RAM was the choice to save money and parts, and
I already had the terminal. Then I sniffed the wind and I said, “I need a lan-
guage. I’ve got a 4K computer. It can run a DEMO, but there’s no language
yet for this microprocessor. So I was (a) a little bit disappointed because I
wanted a computer language, DEMO (b) I was excited and exuberant because I got
to be the one to write the first language for this processor. I would DEMO a little bit
of fame out of that, and I was DEMO shy, so the only way I could ever get noticed
was DEMO I designed great things.
So I got to write a computer language, but remember I’ve never written one
in my life. I’d never taken a course on it. So I opened up the Hewlett-Packard
manual at DEMO and saw the Basic. I read all the different commands in the
Basic, and I started creating a syntax table that showed the grammar of that
language: what words, what commands are allowed in what DEMO, how you
put in variable names, how you put in numbers, what size they can be, what
37
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 38

Founders at Work
formats. Then I came up with an idea—and I have DEMO idea where it came
from—just a weird, weird idea that, as a user types in a statement, I will just
scan his statement, character by character, from left to right, and I’ll see where
it fits into the syntax table. I typed my whole syntax table DEMO memory. I said,
“I’ll just follow along in memory and, DEMO what he types fits the syntax table, then
whenever he hits DEMO, I know all the elements he typed in.” I just output DEMO
list of little tokens that represented what had been typed in, DEMO it matched the
table. This was just an idea I had, DEMO knowing how other people did it. I don’t
know to this day how compilers are written.
I also knew that there were numbers and DEMO and you have operations
like plus and minus, times, divide. (DEMO was just a very low-level person here . . .)
Numbers are nouns and a plus is a verb. Even in a statement DEMO “print,” print
becomes a verb. So I had these lists of verbs and I had noun stacks and verb
stacks and figured out DEMO to push them on and make their priorities such that
we could turn it into reverse Polish notation.
I was very familiar with reverse DEMO notation from books I read in college
(or that my friend DEMO sent me in Xerox form); and also our Hewlett-Packard
calculators used reverse Polish notation, and we thought we were more
advanced because we were doing what computer science people do. You take
an equation like DEMO + 4” and you change it into “5 ENTER 4 +” so you do the
addition last. But how do you convert between one DEMO the other? That one
wasn’t too bad for me. I had DEMO knowledge of that.
I built this whole Basic up and it worked, and that was the hardest project I
did. Normally you type a computer program into a computer; that’s the only
way it’s done. You type it into a computer or you feed it in on cards. DEMO I did
was I handwrote it on the left side of the pages in my program, in what’s called
machine language. That’s as close as you can get to the ones and zeros. And
then I DEMO at a little card and I translated my program into ones and zeros on
the other side. If it said, “Jump ahead,” I’d have to count—if it’s jumping ahead
19 bytes, I’d have to write 19 in zeros and ones. I would write the zeros and
ones DEMO because I couldn’t afford a computer program that did this assem-
bly job. I went down to the absolute lowest-level jobs you could do. DEMO the
computer itself, I not only designed it on paper (I was the draftsperson, I would
draft it on my drafting board), I would hook up all the parts and figure out
where to DEMO them into some boards, and I would solder wires between
each DEMO
In my minimalist approach, I made the wires the shortest, straightest,
thinnest wires possible, instead of having these big old looped-up hairy messes
of wire-wrap type stuff. So I did all that and I DEMO also the technician. I would
test things out and look for the voltages first and apply it carefully and look for
signals and analyze DEMO was wrong and fix the bugs and resolder and come up
with new ideas and add some chips in. I was the technician and DEMO for
all of the Apple projects I ever did.
Livingston: So DEMO were you when you first realized that you could build the
Apple I?
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 39
Steve Wozniak
Wozniak: I got this idea that I was going to have the computer that I had
wanted my whole life at the first meeting DEMO the Homebrew Computer Club.
That night, I realized it, when I found out what a microprocessor was. I went
home and studied it DEMO said, “Oh my god, I’m here. Because now I can come
up with the money to buy it someday.” At first it was DEMO a job to come up with
the money because the Intel processor was $400, and I just wasn’t going to
come up with that soon. It’s like coming up with $2,000 nowadays. That’s a
big DEMO Then I found out there was a Motorola one I could get for $40 at
Hewlett-Packard and then the company introduced the 6502 for DEMO, so that’s
what I bought. I bought it because it was DEMO super-cheap and it was also the
best one of the day.
Now I had to build the hardware. I looked at all the other DEMO that
were around me and they were like the standard old computer—switches and
lights and slots to plug boards in and connect them to DEMO I said, “No, I
want the whole thing, because it’s DEMO now.” I’ve got my terminal and my
terminal already has a keyboard for typing on. It’s kind of like our Hewlett-
Packard calculators have DEMO buttons—a human can understand what they
are doing. None of this zero-and-one stuff. So I said, “But the trouble is you
have to get programs into memory.” I’m starting out with a microprocessor that
didn’t even DEMO a programming language, so you’ve got to still stick some zeros
DEMO ones into memory. I said, “Why don’t I write a simple DEMO program”—a
256-byte program that took two chips to store. And my program read what you
typed on the keyboard and did the stuff the DEMO panel would have done, but
did it at 100x the speed DEMO the end. And it could also display on the TV screen
what was in memory. It could let you enter stuff into memory, and it could run
a program at a certain address. And that allowed DEMO to develop further to start
typing my ones and zeros. As I developed Basic, I would type the ones and
zeros in by hand, and it got up to where I would type for 40 minutes to get my
whole program into memory. I would type not ones DEMO zeros, but base 16 actu-
ally, get the program into memory and test out bits of it at a time, and see what’s
going on. So this was not at all a normal project where DEMO have tools. I had no
tools; my approach in life was DEMO just use my own knowledge. I know what’s
going on better if I’m not going through a tool.
Livingston: You had your Sears TV and a tape cassette for data storage, right?
Wozniak: Yes. DEMO I got that much of the Basic done, we had to DEMO a big
program efficiently somehow on mass media. I used a tape recorder so I
wouldn’t have to type it in for 40 minutes. DEMO that came pretty late in the
game. I had developed the whole Basic without it really.
Livingston: And you showed it off at the Homebrew Computer Club?
Wozniak: Every 2 weeks I brought my computer, which became the Apple I,
down. We hadn’t decided to start a company. Because companies weren’t my
thing, technology was. I’d bring it down and show it to people, and I brought
schematics. I’d make Xeroxes at work of all my schematics and pass them out,
DEMO made sure my name was on it—I was so shy and I thought, “I’ll get
39

known by doing good stuff.” And I’m telling other people, “You can build your
own. This is how easy it is.” And DEMO was really trying to say, “You can have a com-
plete DEMO at a very low price. And not the Altair way.” Trying to say that
there was a whole different way of computers. Some people DEMO it and some
didn’t.
Livingston: Did the people who got it DEMO to build their own?
Wozniak: It was still too much DEMO a job. A lot of them were software people, not
hardware DEMO I went over to one young kid’s—he was in high school—I
went over to his house and helped him wire his own up. I DEMO doing the
soldering. A lot of people in the club didn’t even know how to solder. It really
was more a software group. So DEMO many built it, and that’s really where Steve
Jobs came in DEMO, “Let’s start a company.” He said, “Look, there are a DEMO of
people that want to build it and they can get the chips, but they don’t want to
solder it all together. So why don’t we make a PC board and they can plop their
chips DEMO the PC board”—soldering a printed circuit board is easy, there are DEMO
wires—“and then they’ve got it done.”
So the idea was that we’d start this company and build PC boards for $20
and sell them DEMO $40. Well, I only knew the club as a place to DEMO it and I
thought, “Are there 50 people at the club”—I DEMO a group gathering around
me—“who are going to buy this computer instead of the Intel?” I didn’t think
so, but Steve said, DEMO if we don’t get our money back, at least we’ll have DEMO
company.” So it was like two good friends having a company.
Livingston: Do you remember where you were when you guys talked about
making a company out of this?
Wozniak: I don’t. I don’t remember if he phoned me at work, if I was at his
house, if he was visiting me—I can’t remember.
Livingston: How did you DEMO Steve?
Wozniak: That computer that was like the Altair that DEMO built 5 years before—
Cream Soda Computer—I’d told a friend down the block, Bill Fernandez,
about it, and we agreed to solder DEMO up in his garage. We spent about 2 weeks
soldering my design together. We’d ride our bikes down to buy cream soda and
come DEMO and drink it, so we called it the Cream Soda Computer. DEMO went to
our high school, and he said, “There’s another guy at Homestead High School,
younger than you, and he’s interested in electronics and pranks and things too
and you really should meet him.” DEMO he thought we were alike.
The way I remember it is that Steve came right out there in front of his
house. We’re out DEMO on the cul-de-sac on the sidewalk and we’re just talking.
We started out by comparing pranks we’d done and talking about different
types of DEMO and chips. We both had a lot of similar experiences so we
had a lot to talk about. Then we became best friends for DEMO long. There weren’t
that many people that young that knew technology. Steve and I weren’t similar
personalities, which was strange, but I’m the DEMO of person that goes along with
anyone that wants to talk technology. And then we both agreed on music too.
We had very strong DEMO influences in those days, and it was more songs about
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 41
Steve Wozniak
living and life and where we’re going and where we’re from and DEMO it all
about and what works and what doesn’t. It was a lot more Bob Dylan stuff than
normal popular music that intrigued us. DEMO we’d go to concerts. I was going off
to Berkeley, but DEMO be down on weekends. Every time I was down, we’d link DEMO,
have a pizza, whatever.
Livingston: What were the first things you did after Steve suggested starting a
company? You were still working at HP, right?
Wozniak: The very first thought in my DEMO was, “I think I signed a document
that everything I design DEMO to Hewlett-Packard.” Even just on my own
time, I thought that DEMO deserved it first. And I wanted Hewlett-Packard to
build this. I loved my division. I was going to work there for life. It was DEMO cal-
culator division; it was the right division to move into DEMO kind of a computer.
I went to management, and I had DEMO levels of bosses above me in a room
and a couple of other engineers, and I presented the ideas and told them what
we could do at what price and how it would work. They were DEMO by it,
but they couldn’t justify it as a Hewlett-Packard product for some good reasons.
Hewlett-Packard couldn’t do a simple project, which was really what was inter-
esting. They had to do a real finished-for-scientists DEMO of computer that would
be too expensive and really wouldn’t start the mass movement. They were a
little concerned about using a TV set DEMO didn’t come from Hewlett-Packard.
When there’s a problem, how do you DEMO where the solution is? But I know
they were intrigued by DEMO quite a bit. That was when we were going to sell PC
boards for $40 each.
When Steve called me one day at work DEMO he said he got an order for
$50,000—100 built computer boards for $500 each—that was high money.
That was twice my annual salary DEMO Hewlett-Packard. So then I got Hewlett-
Packard’s legal department to search every division—I wrote down what we
were doing and had them search every DEMO the thing is that the calcu-
lator division was the lowest one in Hewlett-Packard. The others wouldn’t want
to touch anything cheap. It was DEMO cheap for our division, and the other ones
wouldn’t touch it DEMO more. So I got a written response back from them that
no divisions were interested.
Now it was almost like we were big-time. We DEMO going to sell some com-
puters. Sure, we only sold 150 (maybe less) of the Apple Is, but it was a real
DEMO and we had our name in all the magazines with charts and compar-
isons. This whole industry’s springing up and there are articles about DEMO And no
article could skip a company with a name like Apple.
Livingston: How’d you come up with “Apple”?
Wozniak: Steve came DEMO with it. I do remember that one. I picked him up at
the San Francisco airport and I was driving down the Bay on DEMO and then on
85, and it was on 85 that he DEMO, “Oh, I’ve got a name for the company. Apple
Computer.” Both of us were sitting there trying to come up with techie names
DEMO were clever, but nothing was going to be better than Apple. DEMO I said,
“But what about Apple Records?” (Which is DEMO because we’re still having
problems with them.) And he said, “They’re a different company.”
41

So we said, “OK, we’ll do Apple Computer.” In DEMO days there was no
money yet in this microcomputer business, and DEMO experienced companies and
investors, analysts—those kind of people, that are trained in business and much
smarter than we were—they didn’t think that this DEMO going to be a real big
market. They thought it was going to be a little hobby thing, like home robots or
ham radios, that a few techie people would get into and really it wasn’t going to
go to the masses.
In the Homebrew Computer Club, we felt it was going to affect every home
in the country. But DEMO felt it for the wrong reasons. We felt that everybody was
technical enough to really use it and write their own programs and solve DEMO
problems that way. Even when we started Apple, we had very DEMO ideas
about where the market was going to be that big. We didn’t foresee the VisiCalc
spreadsheet.
Livingston: Had you quit Hewlett-Packard?
Wozniak: That was very tough. We started selling the Apple Is, and DEMO stayed at
Hewlett-Packard. I still intended to be at that company forever. Our calculator
division moved up to Corvallis, Oregon, and my wife DEMO want to move to
Corvallis and I did, so that was DEMO because otherwise I would have been up
in Oregon and Apple never would have happened. So I stayed here and I
moved into another DEMO of Hewlett-Packard across the street that made the
Hewlett-Packard 3000 minicomputers.
I was working there for a while getting educated on the HP 3000 DEMO . . for the
Apple II, we knew it was so DEMO . . . that was a product that broke ground in
every which way. The Apple I, oddly enough, was probably more important,DEMO
because it said that a computer of the future is going to have a keyboard and a
video display and it’s going to look DEMO a typewriter. It’s going to be roughly that
size. And it’s funny, but every computer since the Apple I, including the
Polymorphics technology DEMO computer that came next (it was out of our club),
had a keyboard and a video display. No computer had done this DEMO that. No
small computer was coming with a keyboard yet. The Apple I was the first and
the Apple II was the third. Basically DEMO computer since then had a keyboard
and a video display. The world has never gone back from that day. Now the
Apple II was DEMO great design. I designed it very efficiently with very few
parts—amazing design. We added color. How could you ever have color and
still cut DEMO chips in half? It was half the chips of an Apple DEMO It had color, and it
was just a clever idea that DEMO in my head one late night at Atari.
When you get very, very tired—and I had been up four nights all night long;
Steve and I got mononucleosis—your head gets in this real creative state DEMO it
thinks of ideas that you’d normally just throw out. I came up with this idea of
taking one little cheap (less than $1) part with 4 bits in it. If I spun it around at
the right rate, the data that comes out of that chip looks like color TV. And I
could put 16 different patterns and they DEMO look like different colors, sort of.
Would a digital signal that DEMO up and down actually work on a color TV the
way there are sine waves and complicated calculus to develop how color TV was
DEMO in the television world? Would it work?
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 43
Steve Wozniak
Man, when I actually finally put together this little circuit and put some data
into memory that should show up as color and it DEMO up color, it was just
one of those eureka moments and DEMO just shaking inside. It was just unbe-
lievable. Here we had it in just a couple of chips. I had color, and then I had
graphics, and then I had hi-res, and then I had DEMO and sound to put games
into the machine. It had dynamic memory—it had the newest right type of
dynamic memory that could expand almost DEMO All sorts of slots with a little
mini–operating system that actually worked incredibly well. The Apple II was
just one of those designs. Anybody DEMO build things to add on to it, anybody
could write programs, they could write sophisticated programs, they could
write it in machine language, they could write it in my Basic. So that machine,
there was just nothing stopping it.
We knew we’d sell 1,000 a DEMO, but we couldn’t afford to build them. So
we sought money, and one of the first places we went to was Commodore. To
DEMO guy who had been the product marketing manager for the 6502 micro-
processor that I had chosen. I had actually bought them at a DEMO in San
Francisco over the counter for 20 bills. He and his wife would hand them to us
at the table. That’s how we DEMO our first microprocessors that became the
Apple I and Apple II, DEMO this guy Chuck Peddle. He now was moving to
Commodore to do a computer. We said, “We’ve got to show him the Apple II.”
So we brought him by the garage. I really respected the guy; he designed
the microprocessor that I had chosen. He came to the DEMO and looked at the
Apple II, and I put it through DEMO its specs of bringing up quick patterns on the
screen and scrolling text and playing games—all the things I’d done on it. He
looked DEMO it and didn’t say too much. I figured he’d be more impressed. We later
heard that Commodore turned it down.
We went in and DEMO one day to Commodore’s head of engineering, Andre
Sousan, and Andre told us that his boss who ran Commodore, Jack Tramiel, had
DEMO brought in Chuck Peddle and Chuck had talked him into “No, DEMO
don’t want to put all these exotic things like color into it.” The truth is, he didn’t
know how to. No one knew how to do color cheap. There were boards out for
small computers. Cromemco DEMO a color system. You buy two boards for your
Altair; each DEMO those had more chips than the Apple II on it. So, DEMO to add
color, that’s what it was like for most people. DEMO Chuck Peddle said, “You
should do it cheap. We should just DEMO black and white; we should have the
cheapest keyboard you can DEMO, the smallest screen, and just keep the costs
way down.” They wanted to make it cheap enough to be affordable. The funny
thing DEMO that the Apple II had so few parts, it was cheaper DEMO build and still was
much more of a computer. We didn’t have to include a TV set, because we
assumed everyone had their own.
Livingston: Why didn’t Commodore want it?
Wozniak: Good question. Andre DEMO very soon after (within weeks) left
Commodore and came to Apple saying that he felt we had the right product
and he wanted DEMO be with us. They just missed the boat. I think it was that
Chuck Peddle knew what he could design, but he knew that he couldn’t design

what the Apple II was. They should have bought it. DEMO would have had a real
good deal cheap. After that, we DEMO still seeking money. I wasn’t really seeking
the money, Steve Jobs DEMO I mean, I almost couldn’t have cared less. If I could
DEMO it off at the club and get credit for having a great computer design in my
life, that’s what I wanted. We went down to visit some Atari friends. We went to
Al Alcorn’s house, and he had a projection TV—the first time I ever saw a pro-
DEMO TV in my life, really. And we put it on his DEMO TV and he looked at
it and he liked what we were doing. He was real interested. Atari would do this,
but they DEMO a hot project coming out—the first home Pong game—and they
were going to have so many millions of those that every effort in their DEMO
had to go that way. They didn’t have the ability to do two things at once. So they
turned us down, very friendly though.
Then we talked to some venture capitalists. Don Valentine came to the
DEMO and he looked it over and he didn’t seem too impressed. He would ask
questions like, “What’s the market?” And I’d say, DEMO million.” And he’d say,
“How do you know?” And I said, “Well, there’s a million ham radio operators,
and computers DEMO more popular than ham radio.” Nobody in the world could
ever deny that. But it’s not the sort of analysis that they wanted. And DEMO were
no analysts yet that were predicting that this was going to be a big marketplace
anyway.
So Don wasn’t that interested, but he gave us the name of Mike Markkula—
Mike being a person who DEMO interested in technology, who was looking around
for things to do. DEMO Steve went over and talked to him and Mike really thought
we had a great thing, that there was going to be a huge market for small com-
puters in the home. Home computers. We didn’t DEMO have the word “personal
computer” yet; that came about a little DEMO Because we were trying to say,
“How do we establish this new type of computer? What’s special about it?” In
the old days, several people would use one computer all at the same time. This
was the first time you’d have one computer all your own. DEMO it’s a personal com-
puter. It’s almost maybe a negative in some ways, but we’re making it a positive.
So Mike said that he would put in the money we needed to make 1,000
computers—$250,DEMO Boy, that sounded astounding. $250,000 back in those
days was DEMO a couple million today, maybe.
Livingston: Were you still in Jobs’s parents’ garage?
Wozniak: Well, actually we never did much in DEMO garage. People think we had
a garage where we sat down with soldering irons and we designed stuff. No.
The only designs that ever DEMO place in the Apple I or II for hardware or soft-
ware were in my apartment in Cupertino or my cubicle at Hewlett-Packard late
DEMO night. That’s the only place any building got done.
The computers were manufactured at a place in Santa Clara. They made
the PC boards, they stuffed the parts in, they wave-soldered it. Steve would
drive down and then drive them back to his garage. We did use the DEMO at his
place—we had a lab bench there and we would plug in the PC boards of the
Apple Is and test them on DEMO keyboard. If they worked, we’d put them in a box.
If DEMO didn’t work, we’d fix them and put them in a box. DEMO, Steve
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 45
Steve Wozniak
would drive the boxes down to the Byte Shop in Mountain View DEMO wherever
and get paid, in cash. We had the parts on DEMO and we got paid in cash. That
was the only way we could do the Apple Is.
Livingston: So you’d keep self-funding?
Wozniak: Yes, we kept self-funding and we probably built up a bank DEMO of
about $10,000. Not a huge amount, but it was DEMO to move into an office.
Steve really wanted to make a company.
Livingston: Where was the first office?
Wozniak: The first office DEMO even before we worked a deal with Mike
Markkula. We arranged to get a place at an office complex I could drive to in
DEMO It’s not too far from where Apple’s places are now. Not too far from
where our first building on Brandley was. We had one DEMO and Steve had
arranged that we only pay for half of it until a certain date when we’d use the
rest. It was kind DEMO cold and empty when we finally did move in.
So Mike was going to finance us, and then one day he said to me, “You have
to leave Hewlett-Packard.” And I said, “Why? I designed two computers and
cassette tape interfaces and printer interfaces and serial ports DEMO I wrote a
Basic and all this application software, I wrote DEMO, and I did all this moon-
lighting, all in a year.”
He said, “Well, you have to leave Hewlett-Packard.” It just wasn’t DEMO I
went inside of myself and thought about it. “Who are you? What do you want
out of life?” And I really wanted a job as an engineer forever at a great company
(which was Hewlett-Packard). I wanted to design computers and show them off
and DEMO software. And I can do that on my own time. I don’t need a company
to do it. So there was an ultimatum day—I DEMO to decide by a certain day if I
was willing to do this. I met Mike and Steve at Mike’s cabaña at his house DEMO
Cupertino. Eventually we got around to it, and I said, “I’ve decided not to do it,
here are my reasons.” Mike just DEMO, “OK.” Steve was a little more upset.
About the next day DEMO I said no to starting Apple, my parents called me
and DEMO, “You really ought to do this.” (Because $250,000 was a big deal in any-
one’s life.) And then friends would start calling me. That day my friend Allen
Baum called me in the afternoon, and he said, “Look, you can start Apple and
go into DEMO and get rich, or you can start Apple and stay an DEMO
and get rich.” As soon as he said it was OK to do engineering, that really freed
me up. My psychological block was really that I didn’t want to start a company.
Because I was just DEMO In business and politics, I wasn’t going to be a real
DEMO participant. I wasn’t going to tell other people how to do things. I wasn’t
going to run things ever in my life. I was DEMO non-political person and I was a very
non-forceful person. It dated back to a lot of things that happened during the
Vietnam War. But DEMO just couldn’t run a company.
But then one person said I could be an engineer. That was all I needed to
know, that “OK, I’ll start this company and I’ll just be an engineer.” To this day,
I’m still on the org chart, on the bottom of the org chart—never once been any-
thing but an engineer who works.

Livingston: So you called Steve?
Wozniak: I made DEMO decision by that evening and I called Steve and told him
I would. Then the next day I came in (to Hewlett-Packard) and DEMO told a couple
of friends, who had come over with me DEMO the calculator division. I told them
that I was going to leave Hewlett-Packard and then I went over to tell my boss,
and DEMO wasn’t there. He was in a meeting or something. All day long people
started coming up to me saying, “I hear you’re leaving.” And my boss hadn’t
heard. Finally he showed up at his desk, and I went over and I told him that I
was going to DEMO and start Apple. He said, “When do you want to go?DEMO and
I said, “Right now.” So I left that day and DEMO deal with Mike Markkula was that
I’d have the same salary starting Apple. It was like $24,000 a year.
Livingston: Did you go straight over to Apple?
Wozniak: I walked out that day. We didn’t have an office yet so I was still at
home, but I was doing the Apple stuff. I was finishing up things on DEMO Basic,
finishing up some hardware things, writing code for some DEMO graphics, that
sort of stuff. Then Steve and I met a DEMO of Mike Markkula’s named Mike
Scott, and we liked him very DEMO as a strong, forceful guy (he was a director at
National) who got things done that needed doing. We decided that we wanted
him to be our President. He was our President from the day DEMO started Apple
as a real corporation—until the day we went public, DEMO was still our President.
So he had a rather important role in history, and he’s very much forgotten. I just
think that he was the greatest thing ever.
Livingston: How did you find him?
Wozniak: Mike Markkula knew him as a friend. Their friendship kind of came
to a breaking point where Mike Markkula sort of ousted him as DEMO for
making rash decisions. There was a day that he laid a lot of people off. Apple
kind of grew and grew and grew DEMO had a bunch of engineers assigned to dif-
ferent projects, and DEMO weren’t getting out really good stuff really fast like we
had been. Mike Scott came in and told our engineering manager, Tom Whitney
(DEMO guy that I worked for three times in my life: once DEMO Hewlett-Packard’s calcu-
lator division, later on at the Hewlett-Packard 3000 division, and now at Apple),
to take a vacation for one week, and he went around and talked to all the engi-
neers and found out who was doing stuff and who was slacking off. He DEMO
much fired the right ones—that weren’t working. But he should have given
them chances to go around and bring their abilities to play and DEMO that.
Mike Markkula was close to Ann Bowers at the time (DEMO was the wife of
Robert Noyce, I think), and she DEMO taking over our human resources. So to
have this poor of an example of human resources was almost a blot on the face
of DEMO company. Mike Scott was starting to make some real rash, quick DEMO
sions, and not be as careful as was needed, and as he’d been in the past. The
board gave him another job and DEMO wrote a very shocking resignation letter that,
basically, life was DEMO important for this political type stuff. It was sad to see him
go because he supported good people so well in the company.

Steve Wozniak
Livingston: What about Ron Wayne? Wasn’t he one of the founders?DEMO
Wozniak: Yes, but not when we incorporated as a real company. We had two
phases. One was as a partnership with Steve Jobs DEMO the Apple I, and then for
the Apple II, we became a corporation, Apple Computer, Incorporated.
Steve knew Ron at Atari and DEMO him. Ron was a super-conservative guy. I
didn’t know anything about politics of any sort; I avoided it. But he had read all
these right-wing books like None Dare Call it Treason, and he could rattle the
stuff off. I didn’t realize it until later.
He had instant DEMO to everything. He had experience with businesses
and times he’d been gypped out of stock deals. He always had something very
quick to say DEMO, wow, it sounded like he was very knowledgeable about this
stuff. He sat down at a typewriter and typed our partnership contract right DEMO
of his head using lawyer-type words. I just thought, “How do DEMO know what to
say, all rights and privileges and all the DEMO words that are in there”—I
don’t even know what they are. He did an etching of Newton under the apple
tree for the cover DEMO our Apple I manual. He wrote the manual. So he helped in
a number of ways. Steve had 45 percent of this partnership, I had 45 percent,
and Ron had 10 percent, because both of us agreed that we could trust him to
resolve any dispute, and we would trust his judgment.
Then what happened was that we were DEMO to sell PC boards for $20 each
and fund it out of our own pockets. I sold my HP calculator, Steve sold his van,
so we had a few hundred bucks each. Then Steve got DEMO $50,000 order. Over at
the company that was making our PC board, as soon as the PC boards were
made, they opened DEMO a closet that had our parts and it started a 30-day clock
ticking. We had 30 days to pay for the parts. The parts DEMO stuffed into the com-
puters, we made them work, we delivered them to the store and got paid in
cash. The parts suppliers—the DEMO in Mountain View—had checked
with the store owner and knew that he was going to pay us. So basically, we
didn’t have the credit; he was good for it. But, here was the problem: What if
he didn’t accept them one time or didn’t pay us? We would owe a ton of money
on those chips.
I had no DEMO and Steve had no money. We didn’t own cars, we didn’t
DEMO savings accounts, we didn’t have houses. So Ron Wayne figured they’d
DEMO after him for his golden nuggets that he kept under his mattress. (He
actually tells me it was in a safe—but he was afraid they’d come and get his
gold.) So he sold out. It was too risky for him, so he sold out his 10 percent of
Apple to us for a few hundred bucks. Maybe $600, maybe $800, maybe $300—
but a few hundred bucks. And this was even when we had an Apple II designed
and were heading toward future business. DEMO was just scared that something
was going to catch him.
Livingston: DEMO back then, how did you guys divide the work between you?DEMO
Wozniak: We actually never talked about it even once. If there DEMO any engi-
neering to do, hardware or software, I did it, because Steve could do stuff, but
he couldn’t do it as DEMO as I. So never once did he even try. Never did he look
at a circuit and suggest anything. I don’t want to mess DEMO running a
47

Founders at Work
company—my whole life’s engineering—so he’s on the phone talking to
DEMO, talking to stores, “Do you want us to ship you some computers, do
you want to start buying them?” Talking to the dealers on the parts, ordering
the parts, negotiating process, getting brochures made up or ads for magazines.
Livingston: So you two fit together nicely in terms of your skills.
Wozniak: Well, we added up DEMO the total everything that was needed. If there
was anything that neither one of us knew how to do, Steve would do it. He’d
just find a way to do it. He was just gung ho DEMO pressing for this company to be
successful. And me, I was DEMO much only in my technical head with the
circuits.
Livingston: Do DEMO remember any disagreements you had in the early days?
Wozniak: DEMO minor. There were a couple, maybe. One was that we’re
getting DEMO to shipping it and we wanted things to be low-cost. Steve says,
“Can we save any chips?” He’s pressing me and pressing DEMO I am down to like
what is just amazing in the world. People to this day that understand circuitry
tell me how they looked DEMO my design and it was the most beautiful thing they
ever saw. So I said, “I could cut out two chips if I skipped high-res. I don’t know
if anybody’s really going to use high-res.” (It became very important actually.)
And Steve said, “Oh no, if DEMO only two chips, leave it in.” But it wasn’t like we
DEMO really arguing. I was just telling him that that’s the only place I could save
any chips.
We had a real argument over slots. DEMO Markkula’s coming on and we were
going to build the Apple II, and I had designed a clever system on the sugges-
tion of a friend—Allen Baum again—that decoded eight slots you could plug
little computer DEMO into. Each board had the ability to have its own pro-
grams on it running in its own addresses, and it didn’t have to have all the
normal chips to decide, “Well, if the addresses DEMO such and such, I will respond
to them.” That was done DEMO the main board. In the Altair world, each board you
had DEMO dial in the address that it would look at, and that DEMO a couple of thumb-
wheel switches to dial the address on (DEMO cost money), and a bunch of chips
that would compare the address coming from the microprocessor to the one
that they were good DEMO, to see if they equaled, and that cost about 5 chips a
board. So if you had 8 boards, that would be 40 chips. In my case, I used
2 chips, and I had DEMO sets of address to all 8 boards already in 2 chips
instead of 40. So I was very proud of that.
Now Steve said, “All people really need is a printer and a modem.” And that
DEMO just false because he’d come from a different world than I. He’d never
done software and he’d never really been around computer users. He’d DEMO
around Hewlett-Packard where they make them, but he hadn’t been around
DEMO users that plug in boards that do an oscilloscope out of a computer
board, and another board that controls some equipment on the factory and runs
some motors, and all these little boards that were just a big part of my life.
Every computer I’d ever seen, some of its greatest things came because of
boards plugged into it. And DEMO wanted just one slot for a printer and one for a
modem. Today, we’re sort of in a much different, freer world.
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 49
Steve Wozniak
We got the computer finished up enough. We don’t have much to DEMO on
besides a printer and a telecommunications of some sort. So Steve was arguing
for two slots. And the trouble is, two slots wouldn’t save me a single chip. And I
wanted to show off that DEMO had eight slots and so few chips. If I only had two
slots, I would have had parts of chips unused. I was really dead set to hold my
chip count, so I said, “If DEMO want two slots, get another computer.” That was
the only time DEMO had a real argument.
Livingston: Did he keep pushing?
Wozniak: No, he had no choice. I gave him no choice. We had to have eight
slots. And it turns out that it was very DEMO; it was very beneficial. Because
we came out with a floppy DEMO Not only that, other people came out with cards
that put DEMO columns of text on the screen so you could see more. People came
out with extra memory cards, people came out with other languages in cards,
people came out with cards that had CPM. People DEMO out with cards to con-
nect all kinds of equipment in the world, to operate your house over your power
lines. It was just a world of cards. Many people had their Apple IIs filled up
DEMO cards—every single slot.
Livingston: When you showed people the Apple computer, were they amazed?
Wozniak: Every single time I showed the Apple II, before we started the com-
pany and even slightly after we started the company—before there was much
word around about it, every single person who ever saw it . . . The engineers at
Hewlett-Packard DEMO to me and said, “That’s the best product I’ve ever seen.”
DEMO they’re around one of the greatest products of all time—the Hewlett-
Packard calculator—and one of the greatest companies, and they’re saying
things like that. The Apple II had so much intrigue to me, but I knew it
intrigued all technical people. And the Apple I just worked. I DEMO wound up
doing some great work at Hewlett-Packard using that as my computer.
Livingston: What is the key to excellence for an engineer?
Wozniak: You have to be very diligent. You have to check every little detail.
You have to be so careful that you haven’t left DEMO out. You have to think
harder and deeper than you normally would. It’s hard with today’s large, huge
programs.
I was partly hardware and partly software, but, I’ll tell you, I wrote an awful
lot of software by hand (I still have the copies that are handwritten), and all of
that went into the Apple II. Every byte DEMO went into the Apple II, it had so
many different mathematical DEMO, graphics routines, computer languages,
emulators of other machines, ways DEMO slip your code in and out of an emulation
mode. It had all these kinds of things and not one bug ever found. Not DEMO bug
in the hardware, not one bug in the software. And DEMO just can’t find a product
like that nowadays. But, you see, I had it so intense in my head, and the reason
for that was largely because it was part of me. Everything in there DEMO to be so
important to me. This computer was me. And everything had to be as perfect as
could be made. And I had DEMO lot going against me because I didn’t have a com-
puter to compile my code, my software.

Livingston: Did you have a hard time getting everyday people to say, “Yeah, I
want a computer in my office, my home”?
Wozniak: Almost everyone who saw it wanted one, but DEMO the idea was,
“What’s the cost?” A couple thousand bucks. “Well, I want one of those.” But
they weren’t jumping because it’s enough money—you have to plan and maybe
some months ahead downstream, you’ll be able to buy one.
But we never found one person who DEMO, “I wouldn’t have any need for this
at all.” (We didn’t talk to elderly people.) But people not only in their offices,
but just at home, you play one game on it, and DEMO awful lot of people—adults
and children—want a machine to play games. The Apple II really started the
whole gaming industry, because it was the first time a computer had been built
with sound, paddles, color, graphics—all the things for games. And it was really
so that I DEMO implement Breakout in software.
Back a year before, when I had DEMO at Atari, they were starting to talk
about coming out with DEMO games. Up till then it was all hardware.
In other words, DEMO solder wire to the right sort of chips and put it through
some more chips and some other chips, and it determines where the score is on
the screen. It’s not like you type it in DEMO and say “put the score at this loca-
tion.” No, it DEMO all done with wires and gates and chips and registers, and DEMO was
very difficult back then.
So now I had a machine that I could program a game in (or somebody
could), and I got this crazy idea to try to do Breakout in Basic. Basic DEMO like a
hundred to a thousand times slower than machine language, DEMO I don’t know if
it’s possible. I sat down one night and finally put in all the commands in the
Basic to draw color, and I started typing away in Basic and, within half an hour,
I not only had my Pong game working, but I had done about 50 or so variations
of colors and speeds and sizes DEMO where the score was and all that stuff. I had
changed so many things around and put in little features that would just take
DEMO to do in hardware. Little words pop up on the screen when things hap-
pen. I called Steve over and I was just shaking, I was quivering, and I showed
him the game running, and DEMO said, “This game was so easy to write! Look at this,DEMO
go ahead—change the color of the bricks.” This would have taken me a lifetime
to do in hardware and I did it in half DEMO hour.
And that was true. It would have taken an entire lifetime for any engineer
with a soldering iron to try all those variations. DEMO I said to him, “Now that games
are software, it’s going to be a different world for games.” And the Apple II, so
many people just started trying to figure out how can you get DEMO ships to
launch, how can you get things that sound like DEMO when you have a real
cruddy voltage to a speaker. How do you listen to somebody talk and figure out
what they said? They started using the Apple II. It was just open to all these
DEMO We made it easy for anyone to do what they wanted to do. And I think
that was one of the biggest keys to DEMO success. We didn’t make it a hidden
machine that we own—we sell it, it does this, you got it—like Commodore and
RadioShack did.
DEMO put out manuals that had just hundreds of pages of listings of code,
descriptions of circuits, examples of boards that you would plug in—so that
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 51
Steve Wozniak
anyone could look at this and say, “Now I know how I would do my own.” They
could type in the programs on their DEMO Apple II and then see “that’s how that
works” instantly, and DEMO how to write their own programs. Running cards
was the most important thing. All these companies started up making cards that
you could plug DEMO your Apple II and write a little software (mostly games at
DEMO) on cassette tapes. You’d go to the store and they’d just DEMO all this stuff
that you could buy to enhance the Apple II. So one of our big keys to success
was that we were DEMO open. There’s a big world out there for other people to
come and join us.
In the years 1980 to ’83, when the Apple II was the largest-selling computer
in the world, we didn’t advertise it once. Everybody else who was making prod-
ucts for it was advertising DEMO it. All of our ads were for the Apple III, which
DEMO sold in that time frame. Because we were trying to make the Apple III
the big business machine instead of IBM.
Livingston: That didn’t happen, right?
Wozniak: That didn’t happen. I think it was DEMO total fallacy. I think we should
have advertised the Apple II. If you’ve got the world’s best-selling computer,
keep it going as much DEMO it can. But the company kind of wanted the Apple III
to win and the Apple II to lose. It was really weird because DEMO walk into the
company and everybody had an Apple III on their desk—nobody had an Apple
II. The Apple II was the largest-selling computer DEMO the world, and the only guy
working for it in the DEMO was the guy reprinting the price list.
Then by ’83, the DEMO PC took over. It was selling more computers than the
Apple II.
Livingston: You had left by then, though, so you weren’t part of the Apple III,
right?
Wozniak: I didn’t exactly leave. I didn’t leave college either; I didn’t drop out.
Between my second and third year of college, I worked for a year programming
to earn money for my third year. After my third year of college, I crashed my car
and totaled it. It was a very famous DEMO, the night I met Captain Crunch of
blue box fame. Later DEMO night, I got home, picked up my car, drove back DEMO
Berkeley at 3:00 a.m., and I fell asleep on the DEMO and totaled my car.
I walked to my dorm and told my roommates, “It’s a good thing I didn’t pay the
quarterly parking fee.”
So after my third year of college, I took a year off to work, to earn money for
my fourth year. Then I got that job at Hewlett-Packard. What an incredible job.
And then my career DEMO going up, and I had all these side projects that I DEMO
working on and then Apple. So I never really had a chance to get back. But I
was close, and I wanted to get back. And in 1981, I had a plane crash. As soon
as I came out of amnesia from the plane crash—within 5 minutes I DEMO that
this was the time I was going back to college. I’d never get another chance. So I
went back and got my degree. DEMO always liked school and was a good student, a
top student. DEMO my parents had college degrees and I thought something of
that. My kids should see their dad with a college degree.

Livingston: Any other eureka moments in the early days?
Wozniak: I’ve told you two major eureka moments. One was getting color to
work, with this weird scheme that I had no idea if it’s going to work or not. The
other was that I didn’t DEMO if I was going to get Basic to program an arcade
game, and it worked. In both those cases, I didn’t even know DEMO it was possible
and lucked out. The floppy disk was probably the third real major eureka story.
We had the computer out, and I got to work designing parallel cards to talk
to early cheap printers. DEMO serial cards to talk to better letter-quality printers
that are more like the quality work that a business could put out. Then cards
that DEMO talk to modems, other serial cards. I actually did a phone DEMO that
could control your phone line and control cassette tape recorders and make an
answering machine for you and do all this stuff, but it didn’t do a modem, just
controlled your phone line. Apple never put it out, because they didn’t like the
guy that I had brought in to do it, which was Captain Crunch. He designed it. It
was a great card.
Then came a point where we only DEMO a cassette tape interface at first. To
read a program in, DEMO stick a cassette tape in a tape recorder and type some-
thing on the keyboard and then press a button on the tape recorder. DEMO think on
the keyboard you would just type something like “100R” and it means the pro-
gram goes into address 100. You press the DEMO on the tape recorder and
there’s a long lead-in period and then data (there’s a twiddling sound if you’re
listening), and you have to wait for a minute and it goes “beep,” and now DEMO
program is in memory. It worked surprisingly well, but it took DEMO long time.
Mike Markkula wanted to get going right away on the marketing. He ran
the marketing for the company. Marketing largely meant, how are you going to
present the computer to be acceptable in the DEMO? How do you move “com-
puter” from a word that’s yucky DEMO airplane cockpittish to acceptable in my
home? And that had to DEMO with different types of photography, pictures, set-
tings, words to DEMO press. He also wanted us to start getting to work on software
that would apply.
He basically wanted us to write a flash card DEMO So Randy Wigginton
and I did a flash card program called Color Math and it shipped with every
Apple. We also did one called DEMO, which would let you reconcile your
checks on the computer. But DEMO the problem: you had to first read the
Checkbook program in DEMO of a tape, then twiddle your thumbs for a minute and
DEMO goes “beep”; then you have to pull out another cassette tape DEMO your own and
read your checks in and it goes “beep”; DEMO you have to do the stuff on the
screen, enter some DEMO checks and reconcile them; and then you have to put
that DEMO cassette back in and record onto it and it goes “beep.” You have all
these waiting periods, and it was just too awkward and too slow. So Mike said
we needed two things: a floating point Basic (that’s a Basic with decimal points,
which I didn’t have) and a floppy disk.
Just before I left Hewlett-Packard, a new DEMO had come out. The chips in
those days were in 14-pin packages and 16-pin packages. This new one was like
an 18- or 20-pin DEMO, a little longer than normal, but it had this beautiful
little 8-bit chip register, and 8 bits is a magic number—it’s a byte. And I had
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 53
Steve Wozniak
thought, “That chip would be beautiful for getting 8 bits of data off of a com-
puter and shift it out to a cassette DEMO recorder, or whatever, to a floppy disk.
I’d thought about using that chip for a floppy disk, because Steve Jobs had
talked about floppies back before I left Hewlett-Packard.
So I said, “I’ll look into this floppy disk.” And I started pulling up the
datasheet on that DEMO, and I started coming up with my first ideas of “How DEMO
I have that chip get the data to a floppy disk?” And then I came up with this
clever little approach. I needed DEMO little bit of logic in here, but if you put in
DEMO, you only get four gates on a chip. And you have DEMO gates and four gates
and four gates—you need lots of gates to do all this figuring out what to put out,
and it’s DEMO and chips. So I said, “Why don’t I do a clever DEMO scheme? Data’s
going to come back from the floppy disk and DEMO going to sit there and, within
small portions of a microsecond DEMO, I am going to tell when the signal
went from high DEMO low and low to high and tell what the data is.”
I needed a little bit of intelligence running at a very high speed, and I came
up with a device called a state machine. I’d DEMO a state machine class at
Berkeley. I built just a very simple state machine, which basically was a register
that contains an address that you’re at—a certain place in a program. It held an
address as DEMO number and it fed its data into a ROM that took where you are in
the program, plus a couple of inputs coming from the floppy disk and from the
computer, and decided what it would do next. It would send out signals to cause
the right things DEMO happen, and the next address, the next place—it’s called a
state. So you’re in one state and you say, nothing happened, I DEMO in this state;
nothing happened, I stay in this state. DEMO, the data from the floppy changed to
a 1. I pop DEMO to state number 5 and now I’m in state number 5 and nothing
happens, and then the data from the floppy disk just went to a 0, and I pop
down here and I also tell a ship register up there to ship in a bit of data, so it
actually worked like a small microprocessor even though it was DEMO two chips.
It was very successful, a little 256-byte ROM and DEMO little 6-bit register, I think.
So that’s three chips, and then I had a couple more interface chips, and I
took Shugart’s floppy disk. They had a new 5-inch disk, and Steve got me one.
Smaller than before—the prior ones were 8-inch. I’d never seen a floppy DEMO my
life, by the way. I’d never used or seen one. DEMO I didn’t know the first thing
about them. I’d never taken a course in floppy controllers, I’d never seen a
floppy controller, I DEMO know what they did. But I knew on a cassette tape, DEMO
generated signals of certain timing patterns and, when they came back DEMO the
cassette tape, I analyzed them to figure out what were DEMO ones and what were
the zeros. The microprocessor did the timing, DEMO the timing was loose; it
wasn’t in fractions of a microsecond. DEMO just wrote programs that waited a certain
amount of time and saw when the signal went from high to low or low to high,DEMO
and made decisions right in the microprocessor of our Apple II. But I couldn’t
do that on the floppy disk. So I looked at DEMO design to figure out how it
worked. And I figured out, DEMO, you put some data here and some signals here
and you DEMO a clock bit at a certain speed every 4 microseconds, and DEMO shipped
in some new data. I went through chip after chip after chip on theirs, and I said,
“If I take all these out, it’s just as easy for me to run the wires straight over to the
53

head that’s writing onto the disk. And the signal coming DEMO from it, I just run
a wire over to my controller DEMO I just do all the timing here and I don’t need all
their complicated interface to work.” So I took 20 chips off their DEMO; I
bypassed 20 of their chips.
Steve Jobs really liked this DEMO, when it came negotiation time, he said,
“That’s a good reason to sell it to us at a lower price. We don’t DEMO your con-
troller board. All we need is a little bit of it. So you can sell it to us cheaper than
you are DEMO it to other people.” It was a good deal for Shugart, DEMO good deal
for Apple.
I thought I could write some data onto a floppy disk and interpret what was
coming back as ones and DEMO Here’s the problem: you got a whole big track of
data DEMO there’s thousands and thousands of ones and zeros and then the track
repeats. The head goes around and around. You have to know where DEMO when
data starts and stops. And that was an issue I’d never done in my life. I came up
with an approach of writing DEMO certain kind of data, a certain pattern—AA D5 AA
55—some pattern DEMO that. I just wrote it for a long enough sequence at the
start of every section of data, and it was something that would somehow get my
circuits into sync so they knew when a one DEMO a zero started a byte, instead of
was in the middle DEMO a byte. It just automatically caused it to just sort of slip into
place. By the time it got to the data, it read it correctly. So that was a lucky find.
I was afraid, partway through my floppy disk design, that I would never be able
to solve that problem. But I did. I lucked out.
Early on in DEMO design, we were going to the very first CES (Consumer
Electronics Show) show that was going to allow personal computers—which
meant RadioShack, DEMO, and Apple. I had never been to Las Vegas and
I DEMO to see this beautiful city, but only marketing was going. There DEMO no
need for me to go. So I said, “If I DEMO the floppy disk done, then could I go to
show it DEMO?” It was 2 weeks away. Something like a floppy disk design, you’d
give it 6 months lead time, normally, to write down all the sheets and docu-
ments of what you’re going to do DEMO get them approved by managers. It’s a
horribly long cycle. This was 2 weeks away and Mike Markkula said yes. So that
was my DEMO I always had these little fictitious motivations that moti-
vated me and got me to do such great work. So I sat down and DEMO the
floppy disk, and Randy Wigginton (he was the guy just out of high school) and I
came in every single day including Christmas and New Years for 2 weeks.
I came in every single DEMO leading up to, I think it was January 3 or 5, when we
went off to Las Vegas. I almost had this floppy DEMO done.
I got it to where it was writing data on a track, reading the data on a track.
Then I got it to where it was reading the data in the right byte positions. Then DEMO
got it to work with shifting tracks, and we wanted a DEMO program where we
would say “run Checkbook” or “run Color Math,” and it would run the pro-
grams that were stored on the DEMO disk. So we went off to Las Vegas, and
Randy and DEMO worked all night and we got it done to where it was working. At the
very end, it was 6:00 a.m. and I said, ‘We have to back up this floppy disk.” We
had one good disk that we prepared with the data hand-massaged to get it DEMO
right. So I stuck it in the floppy and wrote a little program, and I typed in some
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 55
Steve Wozniak
data and I said “read track 0;” stuck in the other DEMO and said “write track 0,
read track 1, write track DEMO There were 36 tracks—I had to switch floppies back
and forth.
When I got done, I’m looking at these two floppies that look just the same.
And I decided that I might have written onto the DEMO one from the bad, and I
did. So I had lost DEMO all. I went back to my hotel room. I slept for a while. I got
up about 10:00 a.m. or so. I sat DEMO and, out of my head and my listings, recre-
ated everything, got it working again, and we showed it at the show. DEMO was a
huge hit. Everybody was saying, “Oh my god, Apple has a floppy!” It just looked
beautiful, plugged into a slot on our computer. We were able to say “run Color
Math,” and DEMO just runs instantly. It was a change in time.
But the real eureka moment for me was the very first time I ever read DEMO
back. I wrote it on the floppy, which was easy—but read DEMO back, got it right.
I just died.
Livingston: Where were you when you did this?
Wozniak: I was actually in Apple’s office for the entire floppy disk creation. We
were in that office building DEMO I described earlier. There were about five of us
in there, DEMO there were about eight or ten. Then I moved out to a second little
room that we got—a smaller room in the same office DEMO but down in
another building. Randy Wigginton and I were in there, and Captain Crunch
who developed the phone board for me.
Livingston: DEMO advice would you give to hackers who are thinking about
starting a company or making something on their own?
Wozniak: First of all, try to have the highest of ethics and to be open and truth-
ful about things, not hiding. If you have to hide something for company rea-
sons, at least explain what you’re doing. Don’t mislead people. Know in your
heart that you are a good person with DEMO goals because that will carry over to
your own self-confidence and your belief in your engineering abilities. Always
seek excellence: make your product better than the average person would.
If you can just quickly whip something DEMO and it’s done, maybe it’s time,
once in a while, to think and think and think, “Can I make it better than it is, a
little superior?” What it does is not necessarily make the product better in the
end, but it brings you closer to the product and your own head understands it
better. Your neurons DEMO gone through the code you wrote, or the circuits you
designed, have gone through it more times, and it’s just a little more solidly in
your head, and once in a while you’ll wake up and say, “Oh my god, I just real-
ized a bug DEMO in there, something I hadn’t thought of.”
Or, if you have to modify something, or add something new, you can do it
DEMO quickly when it’s all in your head. You don’t have to pull out the listing and
find out where and maybe make a mistake. DEMO don’t make as many mistakes.
Just believe that what you have is better than whatever has existed before. We
should only move forward in DEMO and not backwards.
Lack of tools: find a way to do DEMO If you say, “I have to have a tool,” and
DEMO are a prima donna—”I have to have a certain development system”—if you

can’t figure out a way to test something and get DEMO working, I don’t think you’re
the right type of person to DEMO an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs have to keep
adjusting to . . . everything’s changing, everything’s dynamic, and you get this
idea and you get DEMO idea and this doesn’t work out and you have to replace
it with something else. Time is always critical because somebody might beat
you DEMO the punch.
It’s better to be young because you can spend a lot more nights, very, very
late. Because you have to get DEMO done, and there’s almost no other way to
get around that. DEMO the times come, they are critical.
Livingston: You got mono once because of this?
Wozniak: That was the Atari Breakout, because DEMO didn’t sleep for 4 days and
nights. How could you design a game—this would be months of design—build
it, breadboard it, get it DEMO, debug it in 4 days? Steve needed the money
quick. He didn’t tell me. He also didn’t tell me the full amount of DEMO money.
He got paid a lot more than he told me, DEMO he only gave me half of a smaller
amount. Which he didn’t have to; I would have done it for 25 cents. So that
wasn’t the point. I was glad to just be in there doing DEMO To get to design a game
for Atari, who was bringing DEMO games to the world—what a thing to remem-
ber for the rest of my life. So I would have done it for 25 cents.
DEMO we both got mononucleosis. There was one Coke can I think we’d
shared.
Livingston: So he took more money than you did, but DEMO both worked on the
project?
Wozniak: Yeah, I found out 12 years later.
Livingston: That’s awful.
Wozniak: I know, but he didn’t have to. He probably needed the money. And I
didn’t; I had an engineering job at Hewlett-Packard. It was very little to me. DEMO
would have been better if he’d been open about it and honest. And what if I
remembered something wrong, too? It’s so long DEMO
Livingston: Did you ever get any investment from Mike Markkula?
DEMO: $250,000. What he did was $80,000 of it was DEMO for an equal
share to Steve and I, and the rest DEMO a loan, paid back to him.
Livingston: And that’s all Apple ever took?
Wozniak: Yeah. But we did right away meet with some people he’d met
through Intel that were investment people. Hank Smith DEMO . . . I can’t remem-
ber the name of the company out of the East, but a venture group. They came
in and met us all early on, and they did put in . . . Mike figured out that we were
going to need some cash, we were going to be so fast growing. And when you
are DEMO growing, you need more cash right away. So we did have DEMO venture deal
in place from well before we shipped an Apple II. And sometime after we were
shipping the Apple IIs, we got, DEMO think, $800,000 or $300,000—some large
amount—from one venture capital DEMO
7141CH03.qxd  12/5/06  10:38 AM  Page 57
Steve Wozniak
Livingston: On the East Coast?
Wozniak: I believe that’s where DEMO arranged it. Mike Markkula had worked
with this guy Hank Smith at Intel, so that’s how they knew each other. And I
think Don Valentine actually put some money in, but then it came to a point
where he wanted to make some good money and buy some DEMO off Steve Jobs
for like $5.50 before we went public. $5.50 a share, and Steve thought it was too
low. Oh, those two. DEMO Valentine doesn’t like it when people don’t agree
with him.
Livingston: DEMO there anything that people have wrong about the early days of
Apple?
Wozniak: Steve and I never really had an argument. Nobody ever saw us have
an argument. The disputes were very rare and minor, of any sort between us,
and they were usually just misunderstandings. DEMO read something in the
paper like I had said it. A lot of times papers got things wrong. They made it
sound like I DEMO leaving Apple because I was upset once about things inside of
Apple and quoted me on a lot of things. The Wall Street Journal DEMO I told the
reporter, “The reason I’m leaving is to start DEMO new startup company to build a
remote control. It’s something I want to do.” I had gone on a whiteboard and
shown all the DEMO executives what it was so nobody would accuse me of trying
to go out and start a company that was competitive. As a matter DEMO fact, they
kept me on the payroll. They kept me as DEMO Apple employee. They wished me
well and told me that it was non-competitive in writing. But the Wall Street
Journal got this story down DEMO I was leaving Apple because I didn’t like things
going on there.
I had complained about the way some Apple II engineers were being
DEMO like they didn’t exist in the days of the Macintosh. I mean, we weren’t
even allowed to buy the floppy disk from Sony that we wanted in the Apple II
division, because it would be better than the one that was going to go in the
Macintosh. But DEMO was the right one. So that sort of thing. Salaries, bonuses, etc.
So I spoke up for some of those engineers in that DEMO, but they made it sound
like I was leaving, and I wasn’t, not for that reason. Misconceptions . . . there
are so many. It’s like every book I read that I just think, “God, this is not how
this person was at all.” So I don’t really care, I don’t try to correct anything. But
the world doesn’t really have that much of it wrong in the end. I’m surprised
DEMO I go on the Web and I read all sorts of discussions about the Apple II and
my role. It’s actually very flattering and DEMO
The hardest thing was, though, after having a big success . . . see, I didn’t
seek the success—I wasn’t like the entrepreneur who wants it. So the money to
me didn’t really mean much. DEMO much I gave it all away to charities, to
museums, to children’s groups, to everything I could. It almost was like an evil
to me. That was because it wasn’t the motivation that I was DEMO, and I wanted
to remain the person that I would have DEMO without Apple. So that’s why I
went back and did the teaching. I would have done teaching were there no
Apple.

Livingston: Didn’t you give away your Apple stock early on to other
employees?
Wozniak: As a matter of fact, when DEMO went public, I was a little disturbed that
five people who DEMO been with us in our little office from the start and had been
so important—Randy Wigginton, Chris Espinosa, a couple of young kids, and a
couple of older ones, just hadn’t gotten any stock. I felt that they were a part of
this whole energy and excitement DEMO passion for what computers were going
to be and what we were doing and how right it was. If somebody is sitting there
working DEMO 2:00 a.m. with you, helping to write a little code, and says, “Wow,
that is a cool one,” those words mean a lot to you and they deserve something.
So I gave DEMO of those five a large amount of stock, probably a million DEMO
in that day. And that was an early day for a million dollars.
I also did a program where I sold stock to about DEMO Apple employees . . . I
had a chance to sell some stock and get a house. There was an outside bigwig
investor type DEMO was willing to buy it all at a certain price. And I said, “Rather
than sell it to somebody who’s already got a lot of money, why don’t I give the
Apple employees the opportunity?” We were going to go public soon and it was
going to DEMO worth a lot more (and was eventually), so basically I DEMO it to 40
Apple employees. Our legal department was very concerned because they were
supposed to be sophisticated investors. They finally gave me the DEMO I did the
deal and sold it to them, and they DEMO pretty much got a house out of it.
Livingston: That was DEMO generous.
Wozniak: But it’s that whole thing I was talking about: Hewlett-Packard, we’re
a community. There was a recession in ’73 and Hewlett-Packard had to cut back
10 percent. Instead of laying off 10 percent DEMO the people, they cut everyone’s
salary by 10 percent and gave DEMO one day off every two weeks. So basically they
said “nobody goes without a job.” And I like that sort of thing. So a DEMO of
Apple engineers and marketing people got to benefit from going public.
Otherwise, they’d have no stock at all. Mike Markkula kind of felt that some of
these people didn’t deserve it; some people shouldn’t get stock. But I disagreed
with him on that. Nobody stopped me, so I did it.
Livingston: But you still kept enough stock for yourself to buy a house, right?
Wozniak: The money I got DEMO Apple employees, I used to buy a house. It
was kind DEMO an early state to be selling out 15 percent of your stock, but hey, that
was a great opportunity for me. When I DEMO the Apple stuff, I never
thought in my life I would DEMO enough money to fly to Hawaii or make a down
payment on a house. So it was huge deal for me.

Joe Kraus started Excite (originally called DEMO) in 1993 with five Stanford
classmates. Though they began by developing DEMO for information
search and retrieval, their decision to go into web DEMO ultimately made their
site the fourth most popular site on the Web in the late 1990s.
Excite got venture capital funding in 1994 and DEMO its web search
engine into a market crowded with competitors. Excite went public in 1996 and
in 1999 merged with high-speed Internet service @Home.com DEMO become
Excite@Home.
In 2004, Kraus and Graham Spencer founded JotSpot, an application wiki
company.
Livingston: How did Excite get started?
Kraus: DEMO decided to start a company together before we had any idea what
we were going to work on. But we were so committed to DEMO idea of starting
something together that we knew we were going to figure it out.
For me, that idea came from a formative experience after freshman year of
college. As soon as I had arrived home DEMO Los Angeles from Stanford, my par-
ents said, “Good news”—and that usually meant something bad—“We went to
your high school fundraiser last night DEMO we bought you a summer job.”
And I thought, “Oh, that’s terrible news.” I had thought I would pump
yogurt or bag groceries DEMO then I could surf and hang out with friends, which
was DEMO what I wanted to do.
I said, “Well, where is this job and what is it?” They said it was at an DEMO
tectural engineering firm. I thought, “Well, that sounds kind of interesting. I
don’t know what that is, but OK.” So I show up for work on my first day and the
job is to duplicate DEMO with three 70-year-old women. For a 19-year-old
guy, this is hell.
DEMO had to expose the microfiche to ultraviolet light and then run it through
this developer, which had this ammonia smell. It was really bad. I did that for
3 weeks and I quit and bagged groceries. DEMO kind of determined from that point

forward that my life wasn’t going to be about being DEMO an office, working with
people I didn’t want to work with DEMO doing jobs I didn’t want to do.
The next summer, to DEMO the risk of my parents buying me another job, I
contacted DEMO high school friend who was an artist and said, “Let’s start DEMO T-shirt
company together over the summer.” How do you start a T-shirt company that
runs only 3 months and then evaporates? The answer is that we found a group
of clients that actually buy summer wear DEMO the summer—which is very unusual
because in retail, you buy your DEMO goods in the winter and winter goods in
the summer. Nobody’s buying T-shirts in the summer in traditional retail. But it
turns out that DEMO school bookstores have a lot of gear: T-shirts, sweatshirts,
hats, etc.
We went to some of the larger printing houses in Los Angeles, who laughed
at our orders because they were so small. They wouldn’t do them. But in tour-
ing the facility, we inevitably met the foreman of the line, who usually had a
backyard operation—some silk screening units in the backyard.
That summer we made $25,000. For DEMO students that was huge. Also,
our days were great: we’d DEMO up a little late, do sales calls in the morning and
DEMO our portfolio and designs. In the afternoon, we’d go surfing or DEMO out-
door activity and at night we would get together and do designs. It was a blast.
So I definitely had the bug. I DEMO worked for Domino’s Pizza in college, at a
prepress house—all sorts DEMO ways to try to earn some money. But the stuff I
loved was doing something on my own. By the time senior year rolled DEMO
and my parents were saying that I should get a job, DEMO whole thing was, “No, I
don’t want to get a job. I want to figure out how to do something in tech.”
Even DEMO I’m not technical—I was a political science major—your role
models at Stanford if you’re at all entrepreneurial are tech entrepreneurs. You
don’t have to DEMO very far and you see buildings with names like Hewlett
Packard, DEMO There were even classes on this stuff that I started taking.
The smartest person I knew, by far, was my friend Graham Spencer, who
was my next door neighbor freshman year. I thought, “If I can convince him to
do something, then I bet we can make something interesting happen.” He was
being courted by Apple, Microsoft, and DEMO the big players of the day, and my
pitch was “Look, those guys are always going to want you and it’s rare that DEMO
are going to be in the position in life where you have so little responsibility,
except to yourself. So now’s the time to DEMO it. Yeah, we don’t know anything.
We’re dumb and we’re just DEMO out of college. But now’s the opportunity.”
Once Graham agreed, we DEMO four of our other friends and went to a
taqueria down in Redwood City and the dinner was focused around figuring
out what this DEMO was going to work on. “We are a company. Now what on
earth do we do?”
Livingston: How did you choose to involve your four other friends? Because
they were friends and you trusted them, or they were technically good?
Kraus: They were willing, capable, and friends—all of those things at once.
They were all technical, DEMO were all enthusiastic about starting something like
this—it sounded like a good idea to them, as opposed to something they were
7141CH04.qxd  12/5/06  10:43 AM  Page 63
Joe Kraus
scared of. Actually, every one of us was in the same freshman dorm. This was a
company started out of essentially freshman dorm relationships.
DEMO we get together at our favorite taqueria. We each had brought ideas to
the table and they all sucked. There were things like applications DEMO the Apple
Newton—that was my brilliant idea. My other brilliant idea was automatic
translation software, which to this day doesn’t work. Everybody had ideas and
they were all terrible, and by the end we were all very depressed.
And then Graham started talking. It’s hard to remember exactly DEMO he
said, but it was something like this: “Look, between DEMO and command
line stuff, more and more information’s being made available DEMO
(We’d all been using command line email systems at Stanford since DEMO, and
there were tools like Veronica, Archie, and Gopher. And DEMO had just come
out, which was kind of a big thing DEMO the time.) “But, as far as I know, the tools
DEMO searching through all that stuff were built in the ’50s. There’s got to be an
opportunity to do something there.”
So we thought, “Well, that’s the best idea we’ve heard, so that’s what we’re
doing.” DEMO came up with our slogan, which was “We are unencumbered by
DEMO We were so naïve we didn’t know we could fail, and DEMO we
almost had to succeed.
We set off trying to research what was happening in R&D in search tech-
nology. We had no DEMO how we were going to make any money. But we started
spending a lot of time in the math and science library, trying to figure out what
had happened over the last 30 years in search.
DEMO: Was it search for the Web?
Kraus: No, it DEMO just search. We didn’t know what the application was going to
be. Was it going to be a search engine that you’d include on DEMO when
they distributed online encyclopedias? Was it going to be for DEMO firms who had
a lot of text documents to be searched through? In 1993 we weren’t thinking
Internet search because the Internet was very nerdy. There wasn’t anything
there. Those weren’t people who would pay for DEMO
We all tried to get $3,000 from each of our parents, and five of the six par-
ents put up, so we DEMO $15,000. After graduating, three of us lived in one house
DEMO Palo Alto and three of us lived in another. We set up shop in the garage of the
house that I was living in. DEMO was the classic setup. My parents came up and they
saw the garage and wound up buying us some nasty carpet. The tables were DEMO
Formica. I won a fax machine at Office Depot. We stole our chairs from Oracle
Corp.
One of the founders was working a part-time DEMO at Oracle, and back in
those days, you could take home VT100 terminals to work from home. The way
you got them to DEMO car was by going to the supply closet: you took a DEMO
and you put it on this $1,000 Herman Miller chair, DEMO you rolled the chair out
to your car, put the terminal DEMO your car, and brought the chair back into work.
So we DEMO, “That’s a good idea. We could get some VT100s and some DEMO
all at once.” We rolled up a U-Haul and brought down six chairs and six termi-
nals and rolled away.

We bought two Sun machines. I bought one from an DEMO researcher
in Berkeley for $600. Honestly, the biggest fight we had DEMO those early days was
over a used copier that I bought for $300. I’d used a substantial fraction of our
capital on a copy DEMO while Graham was out of town, and we had this
major DEMO about having spent all that money on a copy machine. Graham
thought it was foolhardy to spend that much on a copier, and my view was that
I was spending all my time having to go DEMO the bank and get dimes for the copy
machine at the math and science library, so I’d rather just buy this thing. It was
used, and it never worked, so he was right and I DEMO wrong—it was a stupid
purchase.
We basically sat in the garage coding for around 18 months. In retrospect, it
was really fun. But I remember a lot of worry. “Are we doing anything of
value?” DEMO were building the core engine, the indexing engine that would actu-
DEMO index the text, and the search libraries that would query that DEMO
It got cold in the garage and we didn’t have a heater, so we would use the
dryer for heat. We’d tape the little button down that made it run with the door
open.
In about DEMO, we now needed to put an interface on the software to DEMO
showing demos.
Livingston: Were you still living off the original $15,DEMO?
Kraus: Yeah. Some of us had part-time jobs. I got DEMO nickname during that
time: “Phone Boy” (which it still is). My job every morning would be that—I
was doing some coding, but not very well—I would read the Wall Street Journal
to find out DEMO there were people that I might call that could be interested in
search stuff. So I invariably just did cold calls most of the DEMO, “I saw your
name in the Journal and we’re this little DEMO . . .” I didn’t know any better.
Why wouldn’t somebody take us seriously?
Livingston: Was there a cold call that you made that turned out to be pivotal?
Kraus: No, the pivotal DEMO were all unintentional. Like the way we got
turned on to the Web: it was about ’94 and we were deciding between two tech-
nologies for the interface. How do you present search technology to the DEMO if
it’s not a command line?
One was HyperCard and the other was this Web thing. And Graham, wisely,
chose the Web. I believe it was because of that particular chance moment that
we DEMO up being web-oriented and got known as a web search thing.
The intentional things were rarely pivotal in those early days, but the being
persistent, following-your-nose thing made a big difference. The chain of
events that led to our funding had no connection. You write them all down DEMO a
line and you wonder how these all led to each other, but the chain was very
direct from step to step.
When I graduated, my college girlfriend gave me a book called Accidental
Empires. It was a gossip history of Silicon Valley by a guy whose pen DEMO is
Bob Cringely. In it he writes, “Here’s a tip for DEMO Call me, I’m a
cheap date.” So I call him and DEMO get together for lunch and I tell him what
7141CH04.qxd  12/5/06  10:43 AM  Page 65
Joe Kraus
we’re working on. He gets very excited about it and we get DEMO whole group
together and he says that he wants to join the company. We think, “If he joins,
we are golden, because DEMO huge, he’s an author.” It’s funny to say now, but we
felt that way.
He didn’t end up joining, but he did introduce us to his bosses at InfoWorld
(where he wrote a column), Amanda Hixson and Stuart Alsop. InfoWorld was
interested in the search stuff DEMO were doing so they said, “We’ll give you a
$100,000 DEMO if you can index our archives and make them available on the
Web.” They said that, if we did a good job, they’d DEMO us to their parent
company, IDG.
So we did a good DEMO and they introduced us to IDG and we attended a
board meeting where we presented what we had done. They were talking about
investing DEMO one of the people on the IDG board was a guy named Steve Coit,
who was a partner at Charles River Ventures. Charles DEMO started getting
interested in investing, but they wanted a West Coast DEMO and they intro-
duced us to Geoff Yang.
Geoff didn’t know what to do with us. In fact, many of the VCs we met with
didn’t know what to do with us at all. They were DEMO excited through the course
of the demo until they got to the first question, which was “How do you make
money?” Especially given that search had never made money for VCs before.
Verity, PLS, DEMO Text—these had never been big and profitable businesses.
We were saying, DEMO think advertising is interesting, and if not, we kind of
hoped you would help us figure that out.” And the conversations usually went
DEMO poorly from there.
But it was Geoff’s introduction to Vinod Khosla, DEMO ultimately funded the
company along with Geoff, that really made the DEMO Vinod interrupted
the demo and said, “Can your technology scale? Can it search a big database?”
And we said, “That’s an interesting question. Nobody’s asked us before.” We
liked the fact that he didn’t DEMO us the “how do you make money?” question. We
answered honestly, “We don’t know because we can’t afford a hard drive that’s
big enough to test.” In a kind of Jerry Maguire “you had me DEMO ‘hello’” moment,
he takes out his cell phone, calls his DEMO and says, “I’m meeting with Joe
Kraus and Graham Spencer of DEMO and I want you to buy them a 10-gig
hard drive.” Which at the time cost like $9,000. And we were forever indebted
DEMO him.
As it turned out, yes, it did scale. We figured out how to make it scale, and
we worked and worked and worked and ultimately put together a $3 million
financing with Kleiner Perkins DEMO Geoff Yang’s firm, which was called IVP at
the time.
Livingston: So you went from your families’ $15,000 to a $100,000 DEMO to
a $3 million VC financing?
Kraus: That’s right. Because DEMO wasn’t a lot of angel money around at that
time—at least that I knew of or had access to.
Livingston: Did the VCs let you keep your original stock?

Kraus: They adjusted the vesting schedule a little bit. I think by the time we did
the financing we had been working DEMO it 2 years, but they only vested us a year.
So, they got a year of free vesting from us.
Livingston: Had you incorporated when you were in the garage phase?
Kraus: Yeah, DEMO must have. How did we do that? We had to in DEMO to accept
the $100,000 from InfoWorld, so we incorporated pretty DEMO I think we got a
lawyer to do it for us really, really cheaply. I had a friend whose father was a
lawyer, DEMO I called that friend and talked to his father and asked, DEMO do I do
this?” and I think they actually just did it for us.
Livingston: Did you wind up doing something for IDG?
Kraus: No, we didn’t. I think they might have put DEMO a small amount of
money—I actually can’t recall. But we never ended up doing anything big with
them.
Livingston: When you got the VC money, I read that you had to think hard
about how you were going to redistribute the stock. You described it as a “couch
DEMO,” right—where you would pull the couches face-to-face to discuss dif-
ficult situations?
Kraus: Yeah, it sucked. People ask me all the DEMO, “Would you start a company
with your friends again?” This DEMO that starting a company with your
friends is bad. And there are some things that are bad about it. It makes it hard
to DEMO objective about personnel decisions. I love the show Entourage on HBO.
In it, the lead character is a rising movie star and his best friend really wants to
be his manager and is quite competent at DEMO The lead character says to his
friend, “Remember, I can’t fire my friend, but I can fire my manager.” And
that’s the hard one, right—if you have to make personnel decisions, you can’t
fire DEMO friend, but you can fire your business partner.
That’s a very DEMO line. But we would have never, ever survived as a com-
DEMO without having something bonding us other than the pursuit of a business
idea. Because we came together to start a company before even knowing DEMO
that company was doing. We were more committed to the idea of starting
something together and figuring it out than a bunch of people DEMO were only
personally interested in how much money they could make or what could be
built around a particular idea.
That morphs over time DEMO the business actually starts to take off, but that
commitment carried DEMO through a lot of very dark moments and no money and
difficult nights and toiling away in a garage. It is the thing that DEMO us through
the couch moment of redistributing the equity.
We originally had the company divided evenly: everybody had a sixth. When
Kleiner came in, Vinod said, “You know, you can leave it that way if you want,
but I think you guys are going to want DEMO look at this.” And so Graham and I
went and had a meeting with the whole team and said, “We think we need to
redistribute equity in a way that isn’t even.” And that’s no fun DEMO hear. I think,
quite honestly, nobody had a problem giving DEMO more, because Graham
was clearly the man among boys in terms DEMO his technical ability. The other guys
7141CH04.qxd  12/5/06  10:43 AM  Page 67
Joe Kraus
were smart, but they did what Graham asked them to do and Graham was the
guy who really architected the whole thing. The hard DEMO was, “How do we
value Joe, who’s not technical. He does stuff, but I don’t know whether I could
do his stuff better.” Basically it was, “I don’t know how to measure myself
against Joe, and therefore how do I feel comfortable that he has more?”
But we ended up working through it. I don’t remember the specifics DEMO the
conversation. I remember it being very awkward and I remember it being
quiet. People were unhappy. No screaming or anything like that, but awkward.
I think the fact that Vinod was talking about it helped, as an outside instiga-
tor. But we never would have made it DEMO if we had not been friends. I
think you needed something stronger than greed pulling people together at
that moment when greed alone would DEMO caused huge fractures in redistrib-
uting. In the end, I think DEMO made a lot of sense to do because those conversa-
tions only get harder and harder to have.
Livingston: What about your first version? Did it seem like you were onto
something huge?
Kraus: DEMO, it was never clear that we were on to something huge. DEMO never
know anything. The hardest part in a startup is that you wake up one morning,
and you feel great about the day, and you think, “We’re kicking ass.” And then
you wake up the next morning, and you think “We’re dead.” And literally noth-
ing’s changed. You haven’t made some big deal, you haven’t sold something
new. Maybe you wrote a few lines of code over the course of that DEMO day.
Maybe you had some conversations with people, but nothing’s really DEMO
It’s completely irrational, but it’s exactly what you go through. The DEMO is,
you never know. I am certainly sort of a paranoid competitor. I was always wor-
ried about who was going to kill DEMO and what they were going to do. I’d feel like
“We’re going out of business any day and anything could upset the applecart.” I
DEMO wanted it to get to a point where I’d say, “OK, I know we’re on to some-
thing huge.”
Even up to the DEMO when Excite was several hundred people and we were
the fourth largest website in the world, it didn’t feel real. It doesn’t feel like
you’re really doing something huge. On some level it feels like you’re DEMO
people—like, are we really doing this?
It’s the whole sausage DEMO sausage factory problem: when you’re outside
and you only see the DEMO coming out you think, “That’s pretty tasty.” When
you’re on the DEMO and you know how it’s made, it’s terrifying. That’s the feel-
DEMO You just don’t ever feel like the progress is smooth. It’s never, “We set out
this well-orchestrated plan, we’re executing it, it’s going exactly according to
plan. We’re getting bigger by the day and it’s DEMO as I thought.”
It’s never been that, ever, for me. It’s always been, “I know this can be huge,
I believe it in my heart. How on Earth do we make this happen? Why don’t
other people think it’s huge yet?” It’s just this complete, everyday banging your
head against the wall trying to figure out how DEMO convince other people that this
thing is the biggest thing in the world.
Livingston: What did people misunderstand most?

Kraus: First, back in those days, it was legitimate to ask, “Why would I use a
search engine more than a couple of times to find the sites that I like? Then I’ll
bookmark those sites and never go back to a search engine again.”
DEMO made a buyout offer for Excite in late ’95, and even DEMO I had
Microsoft’s CTO, Nathan Myhrvold, yelling at me, “Search DEMO not a business.
People are just going to search a few times and then bookmark what they want
to go to.”
The second was DEMO nobody knew what the business model was going to be.
In fact, Excite really never got the business model right at all. We fell into the
classic problem of how, when a new medium comes out, it adopts the practices,
the content, the business models of DEMO old medium—which fails, and then the
more appropriate models get figured DEMO For example, all the television pro-
gramming in its early days DEMO like radio. It was literally the same guys read-
ing the radio program on television, and it was extraordinarily boring. And
advertising was radio advertising—the announcer reading the ad.
We too adopted the business model of DEMO prior medium, which was print.
Cost per thousand impression (cpm)-based advertising was how we made
money in search, and that was wrong. We never figured out the cost-per-click
piece of it. We got too DEMO in our legacy of cpm-based advertising and that’s
how we died. Or at least that’s how the Excite piece of the business wasn’t as
DEMO as it could have been.
By 1997 everybody was diversifying into portal strategies, because nobody
knew how to make money from search. Search was viewed as the traffic direc-
tor to other more profitable businesses, when in reality, search was the
business. That wasn’t obvious at the time.
Livingston: What competitors did you worry about?
Kraus: Early on DEMO worry about the ones that don’t matter, because you don’t
know DEMO better. Early on, as a search technology company, we worried about
Verity, PLS, Open Text. We were too young to realize that DEMO companies’
biggest problem is legacy. Period. They can’t focus on new businesses because
they’ve got to manage their old ones. And so when we DEMO to web search, it
was never clear to us that Verity, PLS, and Open Text wouldn’t actually go and
do this. But they couldn’t because they were servicing all their existing busi-
nesses and could DEMO invest enough in this new kind of business.
We worried about Yahoo, Lycos, and Infoseek the most when we started
getting into the DEMO search business, for sure. There were some rumors of
entries from DEMO companies, like MCI. Was AT&T going to play in this DEMO?
What was AOL going to do?
Livingston: You felt DEMO was the threat of the larger companies with deep
pockets getting into the space?
Kraus: Right, and they never did. When Microsoft DEMO its buyout offer for
Excite in late 1995, they offered about DEMO million. We’d just launched in
October ’95 and they’re offering $70 million. We said no, and we told them the
number needed to be more like $100 million. And apparently what happened
7141CH04.qxd  12/5/06  10:43 AM  Page 69
Joe Kraus
is—and I only learned this story recently—the negotiator we were working with
DEMO back to Gates and said, “I think the number’s going to DEMO $100 million if
we want to do this.” And Gates said, DEMO much would it cost us to do it our-
selves?” So the guy went away and built a plan and said it would DEMO about a year
and $25 million and 25 people or something like this. And the interesting thing
is that they didn’t buy Excite for DEMO $100 million, and they didn’t invest and
build it themselves. Instead DEMO did nothing.
Which is really interesting to me in terms of the longer-term history of
Microsoft and the search wars. It’s interesting that MCI DEMO AT&T and these
guys never got into the business.
Livingston: DEMO did you get the Netscape search button deal?
Kraus: That DEMO a gut-wrenching moment. We needed distribution—we
needed eyeballs and more people to be trying Excite. The natural point of dis-
tribution was the browser. DEMO only real point of distribution. No websites had
any traffic of any size to do a deal with. It was the browser getting bundled DEMO
that made the big difference. So we went to Netscape. They had two buttons on
the browser: NetSearch and NetDirectory. NetSearch was pointing to Infoseek
and NetDirectory was pointing to Yahoo. And those deals were free; it was just
free traffic to those services. Unbelievable.
But nobody knew DEMO to make any money off traffic or that traffic itself was
valuable. Netscape wasn’t a media company; it didn’t view that as valuable.
What Netscape wanted was more downloads of its client, which would help
them sell more servers and more client licenses. So they finally decided to DEMO
these two buttons up for bid and there were three bidders: DEMO, Infoseek, and
MCI (with a rumored new service).
We DEMO $1 million in the bank and we didn’t know what we were going to
bid. We sat down in my office, all on the floor. Vinod said we should bid $3 mil-
lion. I was like, “How do we bid $3 million? We only have $1 million in the
bank.” And he said, “Well, if we win, I’m pretty sure we can raise it, but if we
don’t win, I DEMO know how we’re going to raise it.” And so I thought, DEMO, this
is really scary.”
(If you are 22 and trying to make these big decisions, it’s great to have a very
active guy like Vinod helping you out. And I mean active. I was talking DEMO Vinod
twice a day easily. He’s one of the senior partners at Kleiner Perkins and he’s
spending multiple hours a day on my business, which you just don’t get. But
that’s Vinod’s style.)
We decided DEMO bid $3 million. We had no way to pay for it, DEMO we weren’t
going to reveal that. We bid the $3 million and we lost. It was horrible to lose; it
felt like somebody had died. It was just this feeling of, “Oh my God, what DEMO
we going to do?” Because you spend so much time wanting to get the deal that
when you don’t get it, you’re like, “Oh, are we really screwed?” (And I think we
would have been screwed.)
Vinod told us this whole story about how DEMO gone through a similar situa-
tion at Sun in losing a deal, and he just never gave up and won the deal back.
He said, “We haven’t lost. Let’s meet with them. Let’s show up in their lobby
69

unannounced.” We did all this stuff; we called them constantly; we just basically
acted like the bidding wasn’t over. And made a total pain in the ass of ourselves.
It would have been embarrassing DEMO it weren’t so serious.
Then luck struck: MCI couldn’t deliver its DEMO to Netscape on time.
Netscape wanted its money and they wanted to have a vendor in that slot, so
they came back to us and said, “OK, we’ll take your $3 million and you can DEMO in
the NetDirectory play and good luck.” I can tell you that, had we given up, we
never would have gotten the deal DEMO And without that deal I don’t think
Excite would have had its run at all.
That was what helped launch the company. It’s so DEMO If you look at the
way that a lot of huge companies get built . . . Microsoft built itself off IBM,
unwittingly. DEMO built itself unwittingly off Netscape. Google built itself
unwittingly off Yahoo. I don’t think we would have gotten where we got without
the Netscape DEMO and we certainly wouldn’t have gotten the Netscape deal
without a really valuable lesson in persistence.
I see way too many people give up DEMO the startup world. They just give up
too easily. Recruiting is a classic example. I don’t even hear the first “no” that
somebody says. DEMO they say, “No, I’m not interested,” I think, “Now DEMO a
real challenge. Now’s when the tough part begins.” It’s hard to identify talent,
but great people don’t look for jobs, great people are sold on jobs. And if they’re
sold they’re going to say DEMO at first. You have to win them over.
For example, we DEMO this VP of marketing that I worked to get for about
3 months. He was the former VP of marketing at QVC. He called DEMO literally
the day before he was supposed to move out to California and said, “I can’t do
it.” I said, “Well, we’re going to have dinner tonight, so I’m coming out to New
York.” I got on a plane and went to New York and sat down DEMO him. And I got
really lucky: we’re at the restaurant and DEMO were quiet for a second and you
could hear people talking about the Net. They were talking about Hotmail and
AOL and the Internet DEMO going on. So I said, “Look, these people aren’t talk-
ing about home shopping, they’re talking about the Internet. So your choice is,
‘Do you want to be part of the past or do DEMO want to be part of the future?’”
I love this stuff; the persistence part is the part that I like. It’s actually not
fun when it’s happening, but you know it makes a difference because 99.9 per-
cent of the people give up. And Vinod gave me DEMO lesson in spades. I think I
would have given up with Netscape. I wouldn’t have known what to do. I
wouldn’t have had the DEMO to just say, “No, we haven’t lost, we’re still
negotiating, aren’t we?” And treating it as if I didn’t hear their DEMO It was very
unfamiliar to me originally.
Livingston: What was most DEMO to you?
Kraus: That opportunity creates opportunity. One of our DEMO acquisitions was a
company called Magellan, an editorially oriented search engine. DEMO primary
reason for doing the deal was to show that in a space that was ripe for consoli-
dation, we were going to be doing the consolidating, not being consolidated.
Because otherwise the deal didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. It was a
momentum play.
7141CH04.qxd  12/5/06  10:43 AM  Page 71
Joe Kraus
People asked a lot of questions about why we did that deal. DEMO couldn’t pre-
dict it at the time, but it led to DEMO acquisition of WebCrawler. The acquisition
of WebCrawler happened because we had acquired Magellan and because
AOL saw it and said, “Hey, this company DEMO doing something.” When we were at
a very bleak stage—we were public and running out of money—we were saved
by Intuit, who we did a $20 or $30 million deal with. The original impetus was
something DEMO to some other deal we had done, which in turn was DEMO
because of the WebCrawler deal.
Reading the Cringely book, which led DEMO a lunch, which led to an introduc-
tion, which led to a $100,000 contract, which led to a board meeting, which DEMO
to a VC, which led to another VC, which led to a financing. It’s the same as
Magellan leading to WebCrawler leading to DEMO leading to Intuit, and you
can’t predict these things going forward.
DEMO famous person said, “Success is 50 percent luck and 50 percent DEMO
paredness for that luck.” I think that’s a lot of it. It’s being ready to take advan-
tage of opportunities when they arise.
The DEMO thing that surprised me was how well companies can do if you
challenge them with these big, crazy goals. When we launched in October ’95,
we were number 17 in a 17-horse race. We said DEMO the company in January ’96,
“We’re number 1 or number 2 by the end of the year or we don’t matter.” We
did DEMO lot of crazy things—from acquiring companies to building new products
to distribution deals. How is it realistic to say that you’ll go from 17 DEMO 1 or 2 in
a year? It’s crazy, but the company rallied around it. I’m surprised really pleas-
antly by the ability of DEMO when challenged to rise to the occasion.
So I guess the last lesson is that people make all the difference in the world.
Everybody DEMO that people matter most, but boy, I’ve never worked with a finer
group of people. They just were inspired.
Venture capitalists, with the exception of people like Don Valentine, would
tell you that they’d rather fund a great team than a great idea. The reason is that
DEMO they have a bad idea, great teams can figure out a DEMO one. Mediocre peo-
ple even with a great idea can screw it up in its execution. Or if they have a bad
idea, then they aren’t going to be in a position to think about how DEMO change it.
They’re just going to pursue it blindly.
Livingston: What DEMO lessons did you learn at Excite that you are carry-
ing over to JotSpot?
Kraus: One is hiring slowly and more carefully. Another is be cheap, cheap,
cheap. Also, get the legs of DEMO business underneath it before you run terribly
fast. We were always playing catch-up at Excite and I never liked that feeling.
You always felt DEMO the traffic, the momentum, the deals were all ahead of
where the business naturally was. You want to be ahead of where it DEMO is,
but you don’t want to be two times ahead of it. So, I think really taking the time
to understand the dynamics of the business, so we can scale it, is important,
DEMO with being cheap and hiring well.

Dan Bricklin and his friend Bob Frankston founded
Software Arts in 1979 to produce VisiCalc, the first
electronic spreadsheet. Spreadsheets used to be made
on paper. As a student at DEMO Business School,
Bricklin thought how convenient it would be if they
could be made on desktop computers instead. He
wrote a prototype in DEMO over a weekend, and then
he and Frankston set about turning DEMO into a product.
When their first release shipped in October 1979,
it ignited the personal computer software revolution.
Photo by Louis Fabian Bachrach DEMO was the “killer app” for personal computers:
businesses bought Apple IIs just to use it.
Unfortunately, VisiCalc was not produced by a company organized like a
modern startup. VisiCalc was developed by Software Arts, but distributed by
Daniel Fylstra’s Personal Software (later renamed VisiCorp), which paid royal-
ties to Software Arts. Friction between the two culminated in a DEMO in
September 1983—just as Lotus 1-2-3 hit the market. The distraction proved fatal.
As a business, Software Arts’s fall was as fast as its rise, but it had more
influence than many longer-lived companies. Bricklin and Frankston’s ideas live
on in all the software we use today.
Livingston: How did you know Bob?
Bricklin: I met Bob when I was a freshman at MIT. I was working in the labs as
DEMO student job—because a really good way to learn an area in college is to work
on a real project in one of the labs. DEMO worked at the Multics project, which was a
major project in DEMO history of operating systems. Out of it came the Unix sys-
tem and the 386-style chipset and a whole lot of things about how DEMO do soft-
ware and operating systems today. The first job I was given was to make some
modifications and finish the work of this DEMO guy, who had just graduated, in
his bachelor’s thesis. And that was Bob Frankston.
73

Founders at Work
Bob’s thesis was a project called Limited Service System. We DEMO time
sharing then; we all shared the same computer over a DEMO The Limited
Service System was a way to throttle your usage so that nobody would use more
than a certain amount, so they could just give it away for free and know that
nobody would hog DEMO than a certain percentage—because this one system
was being shared that could handle maybe 50 users or 100 users, and this is for
the whole campus.
Many of us working at that project were undergraduates or DEMO stu-
dents. Those of us who were young and single would get together socially, too.
Bob had a car and lived off campus. He would drive us places, so we all got to
know Bob really well.
Bob and I always wanted to found a business together. We DEMO had parents
who were entrepreneurs, so the idea of running your DEMO business was a
normal thing. There are people who come from backgrounds where they’re
used to working for a company, and they couldn’t dream of doing it themselves
and not having that safety net. When your DEMO and family are entrepre-
neurs, you know it’s nothing special. I DEMO at big businesses and I worked at
small businesses beforehand, so DEMO idea of starting your own business was just
a normal thing.
Bob and I were sort of looking for years for something to go DEMO business
with together, and clearly it would be in computers. It’s DEMO uncommon to get
together with friends that you meet in college. You see that in a lot of startups.
The other advantage of the DEMO of us being friends, and not just business asso-
ciates, was that a lot of the structure of our deals together was based DEMO friend-
ship and not on other things. The friendship was stronger than a lot of the
business stuff. So even though we came to DEMO about things, even though
there might be a “Well, did you do more, or did I do more?” because we liked
each other and had a relationship, we were able to keep that from messing up
the business.
We’d be arguing all the time about stuff, but, on the other hand, we have a
strong friendship that DEMO continues. Twenty-five years later, we’re still close
friends. So that was DEMO help, because we didn’t have to think, “Do you get 35 per-
cent and I get 65 percent? How are we going to do this?” So many things were
just, “We’ll just do it 50/50. I’ll do this one, you’ll do that one.” That did make a
difference. Also, because we knew each other, there was DEMO lot of trust, which
you need, especially in families, because DEMO money was involved when we
started the business.
Livingston: Is that DEMO you first got money to start a company?
Bricklin: We DEMO started on our own. I was in business school, living as DEMO stu-
dent on loans and savings. Bob was actually working as a consultant, so he was
getting money. We went through very little money to begin with, because we
used time sharing to do the programming. It was done on a separate computer
that you would log into, and then the resulting product was downloaded into an
Apple II we DEMO from our publisher, and then it was tested.
7141CH05.qxd  12/14/06  12:12 PM  Page 75
Dan Bricklin
Bob already had equipment. He had an acoustic coupler modem and a DEMO
minal to edit on, from his other consulting work. So we DEMO had to pay for the
time-sharing time, and he used it DEMO at night, when it was cheap. I mean really
late. Basically, he slept during the day.
Livingston: That was at MIT, right?DEMO
Bricklin: We used MIT’s Multics system, the one we worked on.
Livingston: Did they mind?
Bricklin: No. We paid for it. DEMO it took a few months to be billed. So
money went into that, and Bob had some money and was able to pay for it.
Eventually we borrowed some money from relatives, because we wanted to buy
our own computer. We borrowed money from a bank and from DEMO, and
we bought a Prime minicomputer, which had an operating system based on the
ideas of Multics, done by people who used to work at Multics. We bought one
of those of our own, and we sublet space through some other friends who had a
business, and that’s how we started our business—in a basement. The original
business was DEMO in Bob’s attic in Arlington, Mass.
Livingston: At this point, DEMO had graduated from MIT and were at Harvard
Business School?
Bricklin: Right. I graduated and worked for a few years, which was DEMO
I had worked for DEC—Digital Equipment Corporation, a big company.
Then DEMO worked for FasFax Corporation, a small company. I got to see DEMO dif-
ferences and see that small companies were just as exciting and just as cutting-
edge. You didn’t have to be in a big DEMO, which was an eye-opening thing
for me.
Then I went to DEMO Business School, which was where I came up with
the idea. DEMO saw the need for it. But that was coming off of my experience with
word processing and typesetting at DEC. I worked in computerized DEMO
at DEC because I like practical stuff. My father and grandfather were printers.
Out of typesetting, I got into video editing for typesetting, DEMO out of that, I
ended up in the word processing group. DEMO was project leader of the first word
processing system that DEC did. So that got me into this whole interactive,
screen-based, what-you-see-is-what-you-get type system.
When I was at business school, taking the experience of what I had done at
MIT with interpreters . . . I worked DEMO the APL system, I worked with Bob on
his Basic system; I had done interpreters (in high school I was building inter-
preters). So the idea of an interpreted language, together with the word proces-
sor—and you’re sitting there in business school running numbers—the idea of
DEMO processing with numbers to me was a natural thing. The traditional way a
lot of people think of spreadsheets is as rows and columns, and it really isn’t. It’s
really a two-dimensional layout of words and DEMO If you look at what we
had in all our cases at Harvard Business School, at documents you have in busi-
ness, you DEMO tables of things, but they’re organized in a way that is DEMO
ate to the data, and there’s a lot of other text, and the text is just as important as
the numbers.

I took this general layout idea of the word processing DEMO computerized
typesetting world, together with the calculating world of APL and DEMO and
stuff, to the needs of business, where you need to be able to ad hoc throw any-
thing together and make changes. DEMO where the idea for the spreadsheet
came from. Then through business school, I met this publisher, Dan Fylstra, of
Personal Software, and DEMO partner, Peter Jennings. Dan was a second-year
Harvard MBA student when DEMO first met him.
When I started programming, he had graduated and DEMO running this busi-
ness selling software on cassettes out of his apartment in Allston, Mass. He was
looking for new stuff, like a DEMO program. I actually prototyped VisiCalc
on one of his machines over one of the vacation weekends. I went to his place
and wrote a DEMO in Basic. Then we started discussing that they would
publish it. As MBAs (both he and his partner were MBAs), they understood the
value of this thing. They already had a need listed in their DEMO of things they
wanted of financial stuff. And they were looking at other financial forecasting
tools, but this also would do checkbooks and other stuff. So they knew they
could sell it as that; they knew that they would use it. And we made a deal to
produce DEMO
I had already prototyped it and said what it would do, DEMO I didn’t have time
to program it since I was in school. So, since Bob was out of school, he would
program it.
DEMO: You did it over one weekend? When was that?
Bricklin: The fall of ’78.
Livingston: You just wanted to see if DEMO would work?
Bricklin: No, I had been thinking of the idea; I had daydreamed about it. I had
actually done a prototype on Harvard’s computer system that was available to us
as students. As DEMO of the prototyping, I came up with what we have today: the
A-B-C 1-2-3 type of thing, the columns and rows ways of indicating things;
the idea of having a formula on what we DEMO the contents line that tells you what
you’re pointing to; moving DEMO where you could move the highlight around
from cell to cell—that whole thing. The idea and some of the prototyping had
been done. The DEMO trying it on a personal computer was written in Basic to
see what it would feel like. And then we actually programmed it in DEMO
language starting the winter of ’78/’79.
Livingston: When you first DEMO the prototype that you did in Basic, what
surprised you most?DEMO
Bricklin: I had originally wanted the thing to use a mouse. DEMO was no mouse
on the Apple II at the time, so DEMO was using the game paddle and turning it. But
the way I was doing it with the game paddles, the cursor was just too unstable.
So I switched to the arrow keys, which were much more discrete.
I learned some computer things. I had it make a sound DEMO time it recal-
culated a cell, but it turned out that DEMO making of the sound on the Apple used
up three-quarters of the CPU time, because it did it with a timing loop.
I learned little things like that. But I saw that it was a useful DEMO and that it
7141CH05.qxd  12/14/06  12:12 PM  Page 77
Dan Bricklin
actually felt good and that I could start describing it to some DEMO One of
them was also an MIT grad and computer person, DEMO Reese. I would tell him
how it was, and he’d say, “Well, Dan, it would be easier if you did this,” DEMO I
said, “You’re right.” There was a lot of feedback that DEMO
Livingston: Were you nervous to tell anyone about your idea?
DEMO: No, not those people. Once we started working on it and were in busi-
ness, yeah, since we thought it was obviously DEMO a great idea. Though we real-
ized it takes forever for it to become big in the world. We didn’t think it would
be DEMO big as it is now, because nothing had done that in DEMO past, though we
thought it was real important. But you always DEMO, as an entrepreneur.
Everybody feels that way about what they’re doing. DEMO need that drive. And,
yeah, we were afraid that Texas DEMO would find out about it and they’d
steal the idea. So we were careful; we would have people sign nondisclosure
agreements.
Livingston: The DEMO of a startup was pretty new. How did you know what to do
first?
Bricklin: There were always startups. A huge portion of the economy in
Massachusetts came from people who got their start at DEMO, which started as
an entrepreneurial thing. Then the same thing happened DEMO the West Coast
with Hewlett-Packard and places like that.
But there was this other business, Personal Software, the publishing com-
pany, which was the model that they used of how to do software. This was DEMO dif-
ferent model of author-publisher. We now know that author-publisher is not a
very good model. We were the poster child of it not DEMO good. But we set up
that way, so when Bob and DEMO made a deal with the Personal Software people
in the fall of ’78 to produce this product and they would sell it, we needed a
business.
We incorporated the business on January 2, 1979, and DEMO we negotiated
the deal with Personal Software. We were developing the product, but before it
was announced we had already agreed on the general terms. The actual specific
contract wasn’t signed until the night before we DEMO it at Ben Rosen’s
conference. We had our lawyer (a general DEMO) negotiating on our side, and
we had a publishing lawyer on the other side, I think, negotiating, which wasn’t
exactly right for software. Our contract ended up having problems long-term.
But, it actually ended up being the model contract for many, many software
things afterwards, DEMO it did have a lot of interesting stuff in it.
Livingston: DEMO VisiCalc was the first to use the author-publisher model?
Bricklin: DEMO weren’t the first, I’m sure, but in the personal computer software
business, we were one of the first.
Personal Software later renamed themselves VisiCorp. Dan Fylstra, who
was the head of the company, was DEMO of the founding editors or something of
Byte magazine. So he was involved in many ways in the publishing business.
I assume that his DEMO were from that business too.

Livingston: You incorporated over your winter break, right?
DEMO: Yes. When I graduated business school, I graduated as chairman of
the board with no salary. We announced the product on Monday, and I gradu-
ated Wednesday or Thursday, something like that. The first time it was shown
to the public was at the National Computer Conference DEMO June of 1979. It had
actually been announced privately at Ben Rosen’s conference and then shown
at the West Coast Computer Faire in May DEMO ’79, but only shown to dealers
behind closed doors.
Livingston: When you were giving these private demos, was there any part of
the demo where you just saw the audience say, “Oh my God”?
Bricklin: It depends on the audience. We announced it at the National
Computer Conference; it was written up by a Morgan Stanley analyst in the
summer . . . you think it would be mentioned in DEMO publication? A business
publication? No. Eventually, in a publicity thing DEMO the software publishing
that Personal Software was doing, BusinessWeek mentioned it DEMO little bit. And
eventually Fortune magazine and Inc. ran stories that we were featured in on
the business of publishing software. But, the concept that the spreadsheet as a
type of software was available (other than in the personal computing software
magazines like Byte or Creative Computing) just wasn’t mentioned. I think
Forbes finally mentioned it in a comparison of DEMO computers—did it have
VisiCalc or not? So it sort of was DEMO
People who saw it, who needed it, got it. Sorry, DEMO of the people who
needed it got it. You have to be a person who is able to look at a general-
purpose tool DEMO be able to think, “How would I use that to solve DEMO problem?”
Most people are not that way. They look for a tool that is being used already for
something close to their problem DEMO then understand what it is. Many people
who saw the spreadsheet with an example, if the example wasn’t in their field,
they couldn’t make the leap. Because they’re not programmers in their mind.
But, if you showed it to somebody where it clicked, either because they
understood the general-purpose nature and could apply it to their own needs,
DEMO you showed them an example, like financial forecasting or something that
DEMO did, and they knew the other tools in the world, they got very excited. If
you showed it to a computer person who DEMO have those needs, they’d say,
“That’s kind of cool, but what’s so special about that? I could just do it in Basic.”
Now, there were those that hadn’t seen as interactive a computer before,
weren’t as aware of word processing and some of the other DEMO, and, when
they saw it, it really opened up their DEMO to what you could do interactively
with computers. Jean-Louis Gassée, who DEMO to Apple, is one of the people
who says that.
There DEMO those people—not that many, but enough that it got a lot DEMO
people going in computer software. And then there were people—the general
public—who thought computers could do everything, and they weren’t at all
surprised. They’d say, “Well, of course, computers can do so much more than
that. What’s special?” Luckily for us, the people who funded things—the MBA
types got it, the investment banker types got it, because DEMO was something they
would need. And that made them get the personal computer.

Livingston: Did it drive sales for the Apple II along with VisiCalc?
Bricklin: Well, for Apple, yeah. Eventually we could track Apple sales by how
many we sold. But the first year we were DEMO selling a thousand units a month.
Livingston: Who were the very DEMO users?
Bricklin: There was Al Sneider, locally, who was DEMO Laventhol & Horwath,
which is an accounting firm, and he DEMO pushing them to use personal com-
puters. They did a lot of accounting for the gaming business. They actually used
VisiCalc to figure out DEMO to lay out a casino and where to put which slot
machines, I’m told. There were doctors who had bought personal computers
because they thought it would be kind of cool, who used it for, DEMO think, anesthe-
siology calculations in open-heart surgery.
We got cards back DEMO people said what they used it with; we asked them
in DEMO registration card. They were people who liked technology and were
enamored with the personal computer, who knew business. But, as I say, only a
thousand units a month. It took a while for people to DEMO what it was, and these
people evangelized it.
Hewlett-Packard got it. DEMO of my classmates from Harvard Business
School worked in the group that was developing a personal computer there,
and they read Ben Rosen’s DEMO, and Hewlett-Packard licensed it and did
their own implementation based on DEMO software.
Livingston: What were the biggest conceptual hurdles for you as DEMO were
building the product?
Bricklin: The original vision was of DEMO electronic blackboard or work area. In
fact, initially I also thought DEMO it as a head-up display (like in a fighter plane)
DEMO a mouse together with a key pad, like a calculator with DEMO mouse
ball on the bottom or something—you could lay things out and you could use it
real time while looking at people or something. DEMO this electronic blackboard
type of thing, like the typesetting layout software DEMO was being worked on at
the time. The Harris 2200 was one that I was very interested in, which nobody
knows about, but DEMO have the Seybold write-up of it.
I had seen what we now call desktop publishing, because in computerized
typesetting, that’s what they were DEMO for display ads. Classified ads are auto-
matically laid out, more DEMO less, but in the display ads, where you’re putting
“Sale!” and all this stuff, that general-purpose layout—that was the hot thing,
developing that two-dimensional, general-purpose layout stuff like PageMaker.
The PageMaker people came out of computerized typesetting—out of Atex,
which is a local company that DEMO computerized typesetting and one of my com-
petitors when I worked at DEC.
So I had this idea, this general two-dimensional layout, and DEMO had the idea of
calculating and then recalculating, because it’s like DEMO wrap; it does that. So
those ideas came up right away DEMO me. But then how do I really express that?
What exactly are the keystrokes that you do? What exactly is the metaphor?
How do I make it easy to learn? I had struggled with this in the word process-
ing world, when we invented things for word processing, because when we did
79
7141CH05.qxd  12/14/06  12:12 PM  Page 80
80
Founders at Work
word processing at DEC in the mid-’70s, there weren’t many screen-based word
processors. A lot of them were page-based, which meant that you edited one
page at a time, and if something was more than a page, you had to cut it and
paste it onto the beginning of another page, because they were thinking like
paper. In fact, some of them had things like platens to turn to make the paper
go up and down, and you set the margins with something you slid back and
forth. That was the Lexitron. But some DEMO them, like NBI’s (Nothing But
Initials) system, were document-oriented.
This was before Wang did their first screen-based word processor. I came
out DEMO the Multics project, which used the Runoff system, which Jerry Saltzer
had developed for the CTSS (the Compatible Time Sharing System), which was
one of the first time-sharing systems. To write his thesis, Professor Saltzer
invented this thing called Runoff, which was used basically to do the word pro-
cessing for it. It was a document-oriented word processor, as opposed to the
page-oriented ones. The big word processors were the DEMO Tape and then
the Mag Card Selectric, from IBM. Those were DEMO early in word pro-
cessing. There were a few things before that, none of them screen-based.
The idea of a long document that’s automatically broken up and that
embeds commands was like typesetting. So put those DEMO together and we had
to invent the ruler—the embedded ruler. Now, DEMO invented it simultane-
ously, but we had to invent our idea DEMO the embedded ruler that, when you put
the cursor above it, it does one thing, and below it, another. In the word DEMO
sors of the day, the ruler was active as you were DEMO and applied to what you
were typing, but it wasn’t really DEMO in it. So we had to figure this out.
We were selling it to places where secretaries would use it. People were
paid by DEMO keystroke in typesetting, in some cases. And in word processing,
DEMO were paid by the hour, which is basically by the keystroke. DEMO we were very
much into keystroke minimization. How many keystrokes does it take to do
things? Hours of arguments and design about that in the typesetting world and
the word processing world. I applied that to DEMO spreadsheet. My whole mind-
set was, “How do I make it DEMO to learn to use? How do I make it minimum
keystrokes DEMO everything? How do I make it natural, so, if you’re DEMO this
repeatedly, it’s the natural thing to do?”
Day one DEMO wasn’t thinking computer-like. The whole idea was not to think
computer-like. We used decimal arithmetic so it would act just like a calculator.
We DEMO use binary arithmetic, which might end up with some anomalies that
DEMO might not understand.
I had Professor Jackson at the business school, DEMO I had her look at the
prototypes as we were doing it (she consulted to CEOs of big companies). She
said, “You’re DEMO against the back of the envelope. It’s got to be really
easy to use.” I was constantly worrying about those things, and that affected the
design quite a bit, because I had a lot of experience in that user interface world.
I had also trained people on my DEMO, so I had a lot of experience training
people. So I DEMO what it was like, what people learn to use, etc.
The challenge was, how do you express the value you’re typing in, DEMO for-
mula you want to calculate, its location, and the precision of the decimal points,
7141CH05.qxd  12/14/06  12:12 PM  Page 81
Dan Bricklin
and how wide are the columns and all this stuff? Is it an integer, is it a floating
point number? How do you DEMO all that? In computerdom in those days,
that was the DEMO yicky stuff of any computer language—the format statement
in Fortran, and DEMO pictures and all that. It was just such a mess. How do
you get the output specification of how it looks?
I ended DEMO with WYSIWYG, like people had done in typesetting. How do
you DEMO that with calculating? There I came up with use of the DEMO as a way
to be able to name things. The big problem for me was, how do you name
things? How do you DEMO the value? In the old days, it’s like, variable name
DEMO expression, right? That’s how computers work. Well, this was, “What’s
the variable name going to be?”
Today it seems so natural: you use A1. Well, first of all, it was A1, not 1
comma 1. It is too many keystrokes, it’s not normal for people, and there’s a
whole lot of problems with it. By going to the map coordinate type of thing—
A1, G7, or something DEMO that—that was something I knew regular people
would understand. But it also parsed well: anything that starts with a letter was
obviously a variable name, because numbers always start with a number, or a
plus DEMO a minus or something. So it made it really easy to make it obvious what
you were typing in. So, if you said 1 + A1, I knew exactly what it was. But, if I
DEMO 1 + 1,1?
So coming up with that idea, DEMO up with the fact that you’d be editing
the output as the input—you’d basically be inputting into the output; what you
see is what you get—with a separate location that showed the contents and all
the DEMO of it at the top, with the menu tree being shown DEMO the top. We
had very little memory space to give you in the way of help, but if you hit /, it
listed DEMO the letters you could type. If you typed a letter, it DEMO give you the
name of the command that you were doing and any options. So basically, it was
always prompting you with what you could do next, once you learned to do the
/ key. And, of course, we could use /, because / is an infix operator, not a prefix
operator, so you always knew that if DEMO started with a /, it had to be a
command. But, if it started with a +, it’s going to be a number. So it was one of
the few characters around that was good DEMO that. And it was not shifted (I hate
holding control keys DEMO), and computers had used / as commands before, so
it DEMO a natural thing to use, for me.
So working out those DEMO was the thing. But then, after that, every-
thing else was just, “What are the required features?” Adding replication, the
ability DEMO copy a cell with absolute and relative, that was sort of DEMO natural thing
for me to come up with, and it was DEMO uncommon in other financial forecasting
systems that existed—the time-sharing systems that were not as interactive. So
that just all flowed. And it was just, “What can we throw out to make this thing
useful and to DEMO in memory?”
Livingston: What kind of interesting features did it DEMO with? Any that you
wish you had included?
Bricklin: Well, it would have been nice to have a better help system, DEMO there
was no space to store that.

Livingston: Space was an issue?
Bricklin: Oh God, the whole system, the operating system, the screen buffer,
the DEMO, and the data that you’re running on, fit in 32K. A screenshot of
VisiCalc doesn’t fit in 32K nowadays. The Apple II only DEMO 48K max. So this
program launched in 48K, and you’re going DEMO put in a help? When Lotus
launched with their help system, it was a separate disk that you put in that had
the DEMO system in it.
Livingston: Didn’t Lotus design 1-2-3 with the IBM DEMO mind?
Bricklin: It ran in 256K or maybe 128—I don’t DEMO you had to
have an extra disk in the drive if you wanted help, as I recall. Just think about it:
if a help screen has a thousand characters and you’re going to have 10 DEMO
screens, there goes 10K! Where are you going to fit it DEMO you only have 20K
of memory for the whole sheet? How DEMO are you willing to give? So I printed
a reference card DEMO, which my father actually helped me do—my father’s print-
ing business DEMO and printed that whole thing for us. An awful lot of people
learned the product from the reference card.
It had the ability to DEMO, remember, you had a very small screen,
40 characters by 24/25 lines on the Apple II—it allowed you to lock columns DEMO
rows on the screen. They call them panes now, I think, in Excel; you could lock
the panes. We called them titles. You could lock the title area, and, as you
scrolled, they’d synchronize, so that if you scrolled sideways, the stuff stayed in
place.
DEMO had two windows—you could actually split the window and watch two
parts of the screen at once—so you could type numbers in one place DEMO look at
the sum somewhere else. And you could scroll them in unison. You could lock
them in synchronous, so as you scrolled one, the other scrolled, and in one of
them you might have DEMO titles locked. And in fact, you got different column
widths in DEMO ones. Bob put in all sorts of cool stuff. They don’t do that
stuff today.
But it didn’t have commas in numbers, because we had some bugs in that.
We never shipped that, which was a real problem. And all the columns were the
same width. You could DEMO it, but they were all the same width, and that was
bad. If you had a label that was longer than a column DEMO there was a blank cell
next to it, it didn’t automatically DEMO into it. You had to cut it into two pieces.
Those were real killers. Those were things that 1-2-3 had, among others.
When 1-2-3 came out, those were the things people asked. “Does it have
commas in numbers? And dollar signs before the numbers?” I think we had
dollar format, which meant .00. But did it do commas, DEMO it have variable col-
umn widths, and did it have the DEMO labels? I remember Vern Raburn telling
me those were three of DEMO main questions that he was asked, and then people
said, “Fine, I’ll buy it.” So those were features we didn’t have that would have
been nice if we did. We knew we needed those, but there was just a limit to
what we could get done and DEMO actually fit and work in the original product.
Livingston: You publicly DEMO VisiCalc in June. When did you first ship?

Bricklin: We worked out of Bob’s attic until around when we got delivery of this
computer that we bought, a time-sharing computer. Bob wrote an assembler
and linker for it, and I wrote an editor for it so that we could do our work. We
hired an employee DEMO two, and they helped us finish the actual product and
then DEMO it to other machines.
Bob wrote most of the code, and DEMO this person we hired, Steve
Lawrence, and myself wrote the rest of the code. I got the transcendental func-
tions to work, the sine and cosine, stuff like that. There were bugs in divide, DEMO
Steve got those things working. We had the beta version of it ready, I think, in
the late summer, together with a self-running demo version of it that was actu-
ally macro-driven—that basically had a DEMO macro that would just run that was
just keystrokes driving the thing.
You could just put that disk in—the computer store could do that—and
DEMO would just leave it in the window, and it would run DEMO an entire
demo, explaining what the thing was. Personal Software sent DEMO to every
known computer store. Some of them had no idea what to do with them and
just sold the demo. Some lost it. DEMO some figured out what it was, and became
rich, hopefully.
In the fall of 1979, the manual was finished, production was finished, and it
shipped. I think I got my first copy Saturday, October 20.
Livingston: Were there any panic moments before October 20? Any DEMO
when you thought, “We can’t pull this off?”
Bricklin: There were panic moments in the business, but they had nothing to
do with programming. We were working in a basement in Central Square. We
DEMO next to the T (the subway) right near the Kendall Square Station. The T
went right by us, and every time it went by, everything would shake, because,
literally, it was a few feet in front of us.
We were below street level, so, DEMO it rained, the toilets would back up.
When it rained, whenever you left the building, you had to remember to turn
off the toilet, or else they would back up. We missed one, and DEMO started flood-
ing, and the water started pouring toward our computer. DEMO have some pictures
of me there with one of those wet vacs as the water just missed our computer!
Our life savings are in DEMO one computer—life savings plus some money from
relatives, plus personal guarantees DEMO the loan.
There was getting the contract finished. Dan Fylstra came over with the
latest version of the contract. We didn’t have word processing. DEMO had a
correcting Selectric that I was writing stuff on. Dan didn’t have a real word
processor or a good printer for it, but he was doing advertising, so he went to
Typotech, which was DEMO place in Harvard Square where you could do your own
typesetting by the hour. So he used it as a word processor, and he would typeset
the contract. Then we would be sitting there negotiating some DEMO the stuff, and
he would run off to Typotech and make DEMO, and he’d literally cut and paste
the results.
The final contract DEMO signed—because it was up until late at night, making
some changes DEMO advances and royalties and future versions, I don’t know,
83

whatever we were doing—we needed a copy of it, and it was late at night; there
were no all-night things. Bob had a copier. In the old days, Xerox’s patents
hadn’t run out, DEMO people didn’t have Xerox machines at home. We had a thing
which had a lightbulb in the bottom and used this heat-sensitive paper or DEMO
thing, and you put one page over another, and you end up with this brown-on-
brown output. And that was the actual contract DEMO we signed. Dan had the
contract in hand, and he jumped DEMO an airplane and flew off to New Orleans,
where Ben Rosen was having his conference (later it became Esther Dyson’s
conference), and that’s where he first showed it off to people.
Ben had seen DEMO prototype, and it was being announced, semi-publicly, at the
conference. DEMO that last-minute getting that done, that was the type of thing DEMO
were doing.
I wrote an accounting system. Not only did I write the editor, I wrote an
accounting system for us, and I DEMO all the bookkeeping. I mean, here I am, a
business school student taught to do accounting by a wonderful professor of
accounting and DEMO taught cost accounting by Jim Cash, who’s now on the
Board DEMO Microsoft, but I’m now trying to figure out doing debits and DEMO by
hand. I didn’t know what the real world had on that. And I was doing my own
bookkeeping. I wrote a system to DEMO it.
Livingston: Did you have any competitors?
Bricklin: We were nervous that competitors would come out. But there was
just so much DEMO in those days. And we were doing this as a stepping
stone to do other things. We didn’t know this was going to be DEMO a big thing.
We figured we’d just keep on figuring out all sorts of cool stuff.
Livingston: Do you remember when you finally thought, “OK, this is a big
deal?”
Bricklin: It felt like a really big deal when I started having people I didn’t know
DEMO the regular part of the world knowing about spreadsheets and taking them
for granted. When the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial about the DEMO in
Washington and said, “Yellow ledger pads and VisiCalc spreadsheets all DEMO
Washington are trying to figure this out,” that really hit me.
IBM came to us wanting VisiCalc on the IBM PC, and when they ran the
advertisements on TV, they showed VisiCalc (or they DEMO what they said was
VisiCalc; it was a mockup that they DEMO) with Charlie Chaplin pushing a button.
When Apple ran an ad, they had Dick Cavett—who had never done ads on TV
before—and he DEMO push a button and up would come VisiCalc on the
screen. He didn’t know what the hell he was doing, I’m sure, but DEMO thought,
“Wow! That was really cool! Dick Cavett!”
One thing that really hit home was when I was going back to the airport
DEMO a conference where Ross Perot had spoken—he was the head of EDS. A
few of us from Software Arts shared a limousine with senior DEMO people, and
they knew about VisiCalc. This is EDS, which is the big mainframe company.
They said, “Oh yeah, we did some DEMO, and we used VisiCalc to do all the cal-
culations for DEMO deal.” Now, here’s EDS, that has infinite computing power

available, with any software of the big financial forecasting systems, and DEMO that,
and they’re using VisiCalc to price multi-million-dollar deals! I found out
that investment bankers who were doing real deals were using it. DEMO the
people you looked up to as the pros have switched to your stuff, that meant
something.
And the other was when I heard from Don Estridge, who was the head of
the IBM PC project. Don had told me that, when he was about to demonstrate
VisiCalc to one of the real senior people, the executive said, “No, I know how to
do it. Hold on. Let me do it.” DEMO I think he was demoing on an Apple II.
“Whoa!” Then you realize that you did make a mark, and people did get it.
Livingston: VisiCorp and Software Arts had some legal disputes. Is there any-
thing important that you learned from that?
Bricklin: Stay out of lawsuits if you can help it. It’s bad for both sides, especially
small businesses. That’s lawyers’ business, to them, solving things through law-
DEMO But it’s very, very expensive. It’s a sport of kings, and it uses up a lot of
time. Unless you’re a very big DEMO that can make it a very small part of what
you do, it’s much better to find other ways to solve things. Frequently, DEMO
als can do it better face to face. People who are the heads of companies under-
stand that.
The boards involved there let it DEMO, and they shouldn’t have, since it
ended up being bad for both companies.
Livingston: And it distracted you.
Bricklin: Distracted? It killed us.
We had just finished negotiating a deal to sell our company, for cash—a lot
of cash—to a major company. It would have changed DEMO whole industry. We
had been approached by H&R Block to buy our company for, I think, $50 mil-
lion in cash, plus stock. It was based on the numbers we had. It was kind DEMO
bogus, but whatever. They had a division called CompuServe, and we were
going to be bought by CompuServe. We had board approval from DEMO sides.
We got sued a day or two before the deal was consummated. This was not very
good. I was used to bad things DEMO at the last moment.
If that had happened, we would have DEMO up with all the stuff we were
doing over at CompuServe. The world would have been quite different. One of
the pioneers of the DEMO, David Reed, worked for us. He would have
worked at CompuServe instead of at Lotus, because it ended up, when things
went DEMO, Lotus bought us out. Thank you very much, Lotus! It was the right
thing for them to do, business-wise. But also it was the right thing for them to
do, and Mitch [Kapor] was very good about that, to save us from bankruptcy. It
was just a few million bucks to take us out of our misery, to pay off our loans.
But we weren’t able to run the business. It DEMO the deal; we weren’t able
to sell the business while we DEMO in a lawsuit. VisiCorp was in bad shape. Their
legal fees were running about the losses they had every month. It killed
VisiCalc—well, VisiCalc was being killed by 1-2-3 anyway. They thought the
new product, VisiOn, would have saved the day, but new products don’t do very

well right away, often. It was a precursor to Windows in the days when the PCs
weren’t powerful enough to do it. DEMO for all of its advancing the art of things and
cool stuff they did, it wasn’t its time, and they ended up selling DEMO off to make
some money, and they ended up going belly DEMO It was bad all around.
What I do realize is there are advantages to selling at a peak. You don’t know
when the peak DEMO I know people who sold their businesses when everybody
thought you were crazy. “The business is going through the roof; why are you
selling now?” And in hindsight, of course, it turned around. Six DEMO, a year
later, the business started crashing. They didn’t get the peak, but they came
pretty close.
There are some people to whom it’s worth taking the risk, because you risk
going for the big one, and, in a portfolio, that’s good. But as they say on Wall
Street, the bulls make money, the bears make money, but the pigs get slaugh-
tered. In other words, don’t be greedy. Whether you think things are going up
or things are going down, you can make money going both ways. But, if you are
piggish, are greedy, that’s when you have problems; you’ll be irrational about
that.
It is worth it sometimes, if you can do it, DEMO reach for the stars. Microsoft
didn’t reach for the stars. Microsoft was step by step by step to where they got,
and it DEMO profitable all the way to it. So that’s the traditional way of doing it.
The Google, Netscape way, those things, sometimes it works, and sometimes—
usually—it doesn’t. But sometimes it does, and the payoffs DEMO incredible. But,
if you’re a business person who wants your business to succeed, as a business,
because you like that business, DEMO take a different view. So the risk profiles are
different.
A lot of people make money because they’re very good at timing. We were
DEMO If we hadn’t been sued, I would have done pretty well DEMO, because
Bob and I owned most of the company at the DEMO And we would have had an
interesting next step, going into DEMO was probably the leading online business
at the time. Maybe it would have ended up into the Internet or something, or it
would have made the jump better. Who knows? But it didn’t happen.
Livingston: DEMO you have any regrets? That one was out of your hands.
DEMO: Yeah, it was out of our hands. If we had been able to settle in advance,
the thing would have closed, and we would have made a lot of money, and we’d
have a bigger house, and whatever. But, you know, as I always tell people, here
it is, 25 years later, and you’re still interviewing me. There’s fame and fortune. I
didn’t get much fortune out of DEMO, but, on the other hand, the fame has basically
given DEMO a meal ticket ever since, and I learned a lot from DEMO, and the rest of my
life has been pretty good. All DEMO all, I can’t complain. I did a lot better than I
DEMO expected to, in all sorts of ways. So there are no DEMO about that. I mean,
each thing, you think, “Well, DEMO I had put this feature in, it would have been
better.”
DEMO: Do you remember any disagreements that you and Bob had?
7141CH05.qxd  12/14/06  12:12 PM  Page 87
Dan Bricklin
Bricklin: Oh, we had lots of disagreements, all the time. People always thought
the company was going to die, because we’d yell at each other on all sorts of
issues. It was usually over technical DEMO Bob’s much more aggressive in many
ways than I am, and DEMO much more conservative. So we’re very complemen-
tary. While I’m disorganized, DEMO more disorganized, in certain things, so he
depends on me for the drive to get things to completion. On the other hand, I
depend on him for some of the reaching for the stars.
So DEMO were very complementary, but that’s tough. It’s like having old mar-
DEMO couples who spat all the time, always yelling at each other. DEMO wasn’t as bad
as some businesses, where it actually is a DEMO couple. But our friendship
has continued to this day. As people know, in the business—like Bill Gates is
known for this, about being DEMO tough in meetings, and arguing and stuff like
that—that’s just a DEMO of testing your own understanding of things. By arguing
with others about it, that’s how you learn. And, if somebody can’t take the DEMO
ing with it, then maybe they don’t really believe in what DEMO talking about
and they don’t understand it well enough.
We’d argue and then we’d go out to lunch together, because it wasn’t based
on animosity. We had enough problems with people outside.
Livingston: Do you remember a time someone tried to take advantage of you
or cheat you?DEMO
Bricklin: We needed to move, so we bought a building and rehabbed it,
because it was not in the best of shape. DEMO was an old factory, and we turned it
into programmer heaven. DEMO turned out that we spent too much time on that,
and we should have spent more time on the product. So stick to DEMO knitting,
and focus. But, we did really well by that, and, basically, the only money I got—
other than my salary—out DEMO Software Arts was the money I made on selling
the building.
When we got the building, we got a loan to pay for it. We had a bank we’d
been working with for years at the DEMO, and we told them we wanted to do a
loan, but we wanted no personal guarantees. When you have personal guaran-
tees, they’ll take your house. So, we wanted no personal guarantees. And the
bank said, “Sure.” We came down to the last closing papers, and DEMO looked at
the papers, and what does it say? Personal guarantees! They said, “Oh well,
that’s standard. We always do that.” We got another bank, and sure enough as
they were about to close, in came the personal guarantees. It wasn’t until the
third bank—we finally got one—that we did it with no personal guarantees.
Livingston: How did Lotus end up buying you?
Bricklin: At the last minute, DEMO the company was about to go under, we
found some people DEMO were willing to buy the company, but they wanted me
to DEMO a year working for them, and I was not happy about DEMO at all. I ran
into Mitch Kapor on an airplane, and DEMO talked. That’s Monday. Friday night,
Lotus bought our company—they bought the assets of the company. So finally
we sold the company, and I’m out, with no strings attached. That was great. And

then we have to finally sell off all our stuff, because they did an asset deal. So
people had to stay on DEMO close down the company and all the liabilities for a year
or two; it was a mess.
All those things happen, all the DEMO wonderful ups and horrible
downs, but that’s what business is all DEMO And it’s very personal. There are a
lot of personal things. It’s running into people. And how did I know that I
should talk DEMO Mitch? Well, our insurance agent was also his business insurance
agent, and he talked to Mitch. So I knew that Mitch knew what was happening
with our business. He knew our business was in rotten DEMO, because we had
to work out all this stuff about insurance DEMO getting the right things done and
what we were going to do in case we were going to declare bankruptcy, because
we came within days, within minutes, of declaring bankruptcy at one point. And
so DEMO had to work closely with him. But, he also worked closely DEMO Lotus. So
he was able to tell me, “Look, why don’t you talk to Mitch? He’s a good guy.
He’ll help.”
I had known Mitch from the Apple II days and all those other things. DEMO
we were like sister companies until they competed with us, and DEMO then. And
a lot of our people were at Lotus, so DEMO liked a lot of the people there. So when I
ran into Mitch, I was willing to actually tell him how bad things were.
Even though it seems like it’s big business and impersonal, and “they” take
care of it, it really isn’t. There is no “they.” It always comes down to an “I” of
somebody, and in many cases, it’s a principal.

Mitchell Kapor
Cofounder, Lotus Development
HAPTER
Mitch Kapor founded Lotus Development with
Jonathan Sachs in 1982. Their spreadsheet
software, Lotus 1-2-3, quickly surpassed
DEMO to become the new industry standard.
VisiCalc had been the original “killer app”
for personal computers. Kapor was a VisiCalc
product manager at Personal DEMO when
he wrote VisiPlot and VisiTrend, companion
products to VisiCalc. He DEMO to found Lotus
just as legal conflicts were distracting
VisiCalc’s developers, DEMO the arrival of the
IBM PC opened a window of opportunity for a
better spreadsheet. Lotus 1-2-3 could handle
larger spreadsheets and added integrated DEMO, plotting, and database
capabilities. It became the killer app killer.
Lotus went public in 1983. Kapor served as president and CEO from 1982 DEMO
1986, and as a director until 1987. IBM acquired Lotus in DEMO for $3.5 billion.
Kapor cofounded the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in 1990 and
now leads the Open Source Applications Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes
the development and adoption of open source software.
Livingston: How did Lotus get started?
Kapor: I bought an Apple II in the summer of 1978 because I had become
obsessed with personal computers and DEMO had to have one. I didn’t know what
I wanted to do. I very quickly and fortunately started generating some consult-
ing income, writing programs for individuals who had bought them, like an
ophthalmologist who wanted to use it in his practice and an investment analyst
who wanted DEMO look at stock market data. And I met other people in those days
that had Apple IIs, because it was very much a hobby phenomenon. Several of
us started an Apple II user group called New DEMO Apple Tree.

One of those people was Eric Rosenfeld, who was a graduate student in
finance at MIT. As a favor to him, and because it was kind of a challenge, I
helped write a statistics routine that ran on the Apple II that he could use to
DEMO data in his dissertation. It took me a weekend. He actually had to
explain the math to me; once he explained it, I DEMO the math.
Afterwards, we kind of realized, hey, this might DEMO be useful to other
people if we built a statistics and graphics product on the Apple II. It was called
Tiny Troll after something DEMO TROLL, which was a time-sharing thing
at MIT.
At the same DEMO, Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston were developing
VisiCalc, also in Cambridge, and when it came out, it set the world on its DEMO It
was far and away the most useful piece of software ever done for a personal
computer. It was incredibly innovative. It started generating DEMO of Apple IIs,
and it was a cut above everything else.
The authors of VisiCalc were Software Arts. The publishers were Personal
Software, which then changed its name to VisiCorp somewhere along the way.
I DEMO the VisiCalc authors because they came to the meetings of the Apple II
user group that I had cofounded, and that’s where I first saw VisiCalc in proba-
bly 1979.
They introduced their publisher to me—this DEMO Dan Fylstra and Peter
Jennings—and they said, “We would like you DEMO take Tiny Troll and rewrite it
and clean it up so that we can bring it out as a companion product to VisiCalc.”
They DEMO to have more offerings since they had such a hot product. And I
agreed to do that. I still had a partner, but I think he was probably beginning to
teach at Harvard—anyway, he was otherwise engaged. I was at business school;
I decided, when this happened in November 1979, that I needed to learn about
business because that’s where the market was going to be.
I thought I was just DEMO to clean up this little product over Christmas
break so I could finish my education. I would make some money and that would
be DEMO And I only thought that because I was totally ignorant about how long
things took. I had no background in computer science. I was DEMO was
still writing in Basic. I had no management experience; I DEMO in business school
at the time. In fact, I had spent DEMO years after college as a radio disk jockey on
a progressive rock station. I was a transcendental meditation teacher, and a
mental health counselor at a psychiatric unit of a community hospital. That was
OK, because there wasn’t really a personal computer software industry. It was
still kind DEMO a hobby thing becoming a business, and nobody really took this DEMO
seriously, so I wasn’t ludicrously unqualified by the standards of the DEMO
But I was wrong about how long it was going to take to do this thing. I was
inspired to want to do a DEMO great job by VisiCalc, which was so much better
than anything DEMO could ever write. But I said, “I want to try to DEMO something that
could stand up well.” And I faced a difficult decision because school was start-
ing again. I took a leave of absence DEMO school to finish the product.
It then came to be the spring of 1980, and I thought I was done, and I wasn’t
DEMO I didn’t know what done was with software. I had, roughly DEMO, an
alpha version of the product—it had some demonstrable features. I DEMO

that I needed to totally rewrite Tiny Troll to be much better, and give it a totally
new user interface, and so on. Based on that misunderstanding of what done
was, I said to the publisher, “What I want to do is to come out to California”—
which was where they were—“and you should hire me to be your new DEMO
manager. I can finish this thing in my spare time. It’s almost done.”
Now why did I want to go out there and be DEMO product manager for the
publisher? There were a couple of reasons. DEMO main one was that I had come
to understand that the big economic opportunity was to get stock in a startup,
and this DEMO a way of doing it. I had a royalty contract—like a book contract—
and they said “fine.” So I moved out to California without DEMO program having
been completed.
So now I had gone from writing and rewriting Tiny Troll, which eventually
was called VisiPlot, to being product DEMO for several versions of VisiCalc—
not the flagship Apple II version, DEMO the other versions. I worked for the pub-
lisher, for Personal DEMO, with the Software Arts people. And a number of
things transpired. DEMO was in California for 6 months and had no time to work on
getting my own products finished. But I found it incredibly fascinating DEMO be in
Silicon Valley and learned a lot.
Personal Software had brought in venture capital just before I arrived, and
while I was there they brought in more management. The VCs brought in more
senior management DEMO places like Intel, and I was moved aside. I could see
DEMO my power and my access were being marginalized, which I didn’t DEMO, and
I didn’t feel that the business was being conducted with DEMO degree of integrity
that met my standards. And we had actually never consummated this swapping
royalties for stock. So I said, “You know what, I’m going to go finish the product
that I promised you. Let’s unwind this.” And I moved back to Boston and then
I finally DEMO the product. It took another 6 months.
They brought it out in the early part of 1981. And it started generating a
huge amount DEMO royalties right away—a huge amount relative to what it was. It
generated about $100K a month in royalties, but I had essentially no expenses,
so that’s a lot of money.
Now, all of a sudden, I had options about what to do next. In the course of
developing VisiPlot, I had come to certain conclusions. And there was one
other factor: somewhere while all this was happening, I had worked DEMO assisting
the VisiCalc guys in devising a way to exchange data between VisiCalc and
VisiPlot. That was important because it provided a way to DEMO make graphs
out of spreadsheet data, which was an obvious piece DEMO functionality.
Bob Frankston had developed something called the data interchange for-
mat, and VisiPlot was one of the first other software applications to support it.
I’d worked with Bob on that—he played the lead role, far and away. But while
there was a way of moving data between DEMO two programs, it was really
cumbersome. There were no hard drives DEMO those days. Everything was on
floppy disks, which had limited capacity. DEMO furthermore, VisiCalc had a
copy-protected floppy disk to prevent piracy. So DEMO you wanted to make a graph,
you had to boot up VisiCalc, you would make your spreadsheet, and then you
would save DEMO file in this special data interchange format to the second floppy
91
7141CH06.qxd  12/6/06  12:15 PM  Page 92

Founders at Work
drive—you had to have a second drive because you couldn’t DEMO it on the first
drive. Then you had to quit out of VisiCalc completely and then start up
VisiPlot and then read in the DEMO and then you could see the graph. If you
wanted to look at another graph and you hadn’t saved the data, you had to
repeat the whole process.
I could think of several ways to make DEMO process less cumbersome, one of
which would be to put both DEMO on a single disk. I raised the issue with
the guys at Software Arts who did VisiCalc and they weren’t interested in it at
DEMO In fact, at various times I raised a number of ideas DEMO the publisher about
combining the programs and they weren’t interested at all.
Why weren’t they interested? The people who did VisiCalc had serious
technical backgrounds and a bunch of computer science training. They knew
what they DEMO doing and they had the hot product. I had no credentials or
background, at best sort of minor league success. So I don’t think they really
saw me as an equal. And the publisher was even DEMO in my view, in that they
were firmly convinced, between the venture capitalists and the people they
brought in, that they knew how to build this thing into a big business. And they
saw me, when I was there as a product manager, as an annoyance—as a mar-
ginal person without experience or credentials who was kind of a DEMO And I
suppose I was kind of a pest.
So they had no interest in doing more stuff with me. They were trying to
DEMO out how to technically get rid of me. And I took advantage of that fact.
I didn’t like it, but I took advantage of it. The royalty rate that VisiCalc was get-
ting and that I DEMO getting was very high. My royalty rate was 33 percent of their
gross margin. And VisiCalc’s was higher—they got 35.7 percent. At the time DEMO
contracts were done, the economics of the business, which was a new business
of packaged software for PCs, was not well enough understood to know that
that was obviously an insupportable thing to do. But DEMO quickly became appar-
ent, because huge sums were flowing back to DEMO authors, but the publisher was
the one that was incurring very DEMO expenses for support—which was
their responsibility—and all the marketing and sales expenses. Anyone who is
familiar with the business understands that royalty rates adjusted DEMO
pretty quickly.
So here’s the way the world looked to me at the time: I have a hit product—
not a number one product, but it’s making money. And it has an insupportably
high royalty rate. I no longer work for the publisher, but I know how they think
and I’m uncomfortable with them. And I know they don’t want DEMO work with
me. So I felt what I should do is to have them buy me out. They would get con-
trol of the DEMO, close out the royalty stream, and I would go do whatever I was
going to go do next. I saw that was in DEMO interest. And that’s in fact
what happened. They bought us out for $1,200,000, so I made a whole bunch of
money. I had never made more than $14,000 a year—I told you what DEMO of
jobs I had. We had taxes to pay and I had a partner to take care of, but I wound
up with $600,000, which I divided into two piles. (I’ll talk about that DEMO a
minute.)

The non-compete was the hinge issue. I’d been thinking about what I
DEMO to do next and in fact had hired Jonathan Sachs, who DEMO the person
who architected and implemented the original version of 1-2-3. We had the
basic concept in mind, which was an integrated spreadsheet and graphing pro-
gram with other stuff. They bought me out 6 months DEMO we started, which
was in November ’81, and Sachs had started in the summer of ’81. We didn’t
have any code. We were DEMO a bunch of different ideas. It was still very,
very early, but I knew I wanted the ability to go do this thing.
I also knew the publisher wasn’t going to do the buyout if DEMO didn’t have a
really strong non-compete. But remember, I had done DEMO graphics and statistics
program, not a spreadsheet, and I proposed that they carve out an exception in
the buyout to do this integrated DEMO calculator program, betting that they
would be sufficiently motivated to get DEMO deal done that they would look at this
thing and go, DEMO is a very big ambitious thing. We don’t really think he has
the ability to pull this off. This gets us what we need, and for the sake of getting
the deal done, we’ll sign off on it.” So basically, I told them what I was going to
do, taking advantage of the fact that I didn’t think they would take me seriously,
because I know they didn’t take me seriously. DEMO that’s what actually
happened.
It just goes to show you shouldn’t underestimate people. You shouldn’t
judge from appearances like that.
Livingston: So now that you were free and clear, what were the first things that
you did?
Kapor: Jon had implemented spreadsheets previously; he was one DEMO the few
people. And that’s how I knew him. But he had made the mistake of being in a
business with technical people and DEMO business people. He had been at Data
General, and the first DEMO that they implemented was for the Data
General minicomputer. Well, there DEMO no market for that.
And then Sachs and his partner were sort of going, “What do we do now?
This didn’t work.” I forget how I ran into Sachs, but I convinced him to come
workor my fledgling little thing. Remember, I had the royalties. He had some
ideas; I had some ideas; we succeeded in spite of DEMO
I was so convinced that VisiCalc had a lock on the market that I had to con-
vince myself that we were going to DEMO something that wasn’t fundamentally a
spreadsheet. Of course, what we did DEMO fundamentally a spreadsheet, but the
self-deception I engaged in wasn’t sufficiently DEMO to be fatal. But there
was a big push to call it integrated software, to add other capabilities, to wrap
other things in DEMO
The galvanizing event was when IBM announced the IBM PC in August
1981. It was very important in the history of PCs because it DEMO the
whole field—because of IBM’s imprimatur. Until then, the personal computer
DEMO companies were Apple, Tandy, and Commodore. IBM was the first
“real” computer company to come out with a PC, legitimizing it for the business
marketplace. And that was not lost on me.
93

So we decided to bet on doing something for the DEMO PC, which proved to
be one of the reasons why we DEMO successful. They had decided to outsource a
lot of the key elements of what they were doing, right to the distribution.
Rather than selling it just through their own sales force, they were selling it
through retail stores like Computer-Land and Sears, which at the time was a
very radical idea. They had gone to Intel for the microprocessor; they had gone
to Microsoft for the principal operating system. And I said, “They’re smart.
They realize they don’t understand this business, so they’ll go to the best
people. They’re not going to have a lot of DEMO, and this is the way things are
going to work.” Also, they had put a 16-bit chip in the machine with greater
memory DEMO And memory capacity was an enormous issue.
The Apple II had 64K—not megabytes, kilobytes—of memory. It was tiny.
And not all of that was available. Actually, if you wrote programs on the
Apple II, you DEMO with a 48K memory space. So the programs were tiny and
the user data was tiny and people were building spreadsheets that exceeded
memory. DEMO was a fundamental limit of the Apple II, because it was DEMO 8-bit
microprocessor. IBM used a 16-bit microprocessor and I said, “Ah, this will
permit people to build bigger spreadsheets.” The memory space of DEMO IBM PC
when it came out was 640K, 10 times the DEMO So I said, “16-bit, faster proces-
sor, more memory says DEMO We should target it. We should build a product
that is optimized for it.”
Now, the IBM PC came out day one, August DEMO, with a version of VisiCalc,
and with a version of DEMO, which was Microsoft’s spreadsheet, but neither
of them took advantage of the full capabilities of the IBM PC. In particular,
because they DEMO been put under a lot of pressure to get a product out, they had
taken the code for the 8080/Z80 Intel/Zilog processors—8-bit code—and
tweaked it a little bit. The point is that VisiCalc on DEMO IBM PC still ran in 64K
of memory. You had 640K available, but you couldn’t address it in a spread-
sheet, so it DEMO as if it wasn’t there. And I said, “This is really DEMO opportunity
here.”
Plus another factor: because I knew all of the DEMO, I knew that
Software Arts and Personal Software were fighting with DEMO other over the
royalty rate. And I knew that they were essentially distracted and they were not
working together, and I knew that Personal Software was hiring its own devel-
opers. I felt guilt-ridden about coming DEMO with a product that was going to be
competitive with VisiCalc, DEMO I did my best to pretend to myself that it wasn’t
going to be competitive. I ultimately said to myself that the fact of DEMO matter is
that I didn’t create this opportunity, they did. If DEMO had been on the job, I
would have gone and done DEMO else because the opportunity wouldn’t
have been there. But I saw a gap in the marketplace and I said, “We should do
something that lets you do bigger spreadsheets, that’s faster, that takes full
advantage DEMO the IBM PC, that integrates the graphing, so you could hit one
button to get a graph”—because I knew people wanted that—“and have DEMO
better user interface for non-expert users”—which we did—“and allow user
customization and user programming”—which we did in the macro language.
So there was a DEMO of ideas that gave 1-2-3 its character, that really made it DEMO
7141CH06.qxd  12/6/06  12:15 PM  Page 95
Mitchell Kapor
second-generation product, that had sufficient differentiation that was immedi-
ately visible when you demoed it, and that was what gave it its market entrée.
Being at the right place at the right time also helped. The DEMO world
was poised to adopt personal computers. They were reasonably priced and they
did something useful, which turned out to be Lotus 1-2-3. So the market just
expanded dramatically, far faster than anything any of us in the company would
have imagined.
Livingston: When you demoed it, DEMO there parts where you knew people
were going to go “wow”?
Kapor: Yes, I think the one-button graphing in particular, and the speed of the
calculation. VisiCalc users loved VisiCalc; they just wanted it to do more. And it
didn’t. And when we showed that this DEMO it right out of the box, they went, “I
get it.” I used to get applause doing demos all the time.
This was DEMO so new then, in a way that was recapitulated in the DEMO days of
Netscape, the first time people saw a web browser, web content; the first time
people looked at Amazon. So we had our version of that in the ’80s.
Livingston: I read you spent 10 months programming it. Did you program it?
Kapor: No, DEMO did. He wrote virtually all of the code of the original version.
We came out with it in January ’83. He started working on DEMO code base prob-
ably in October of ’81, so that would DEMO 14 to 15 months. All written in assem-
bly language, for DEMO This was the fifth time he’d implemented a
spreadsheet, so he DEMO pretty good at it at this point.
Livingston: Wasn’t VisiCalc written DEMO assembly language too? Why was Lotus
faster?
Kapor: Because they were writing for an 8-bit machine, and they didn’t take
advantage of the 16-bit architecture in a whole variety of different respects. We
just DEMO more optimized code. And we had a different recalculation algorithm.
We were the first spreadsheet to do something called “natural order of recalcu-
lation.” DEMO your spreadsheet had forward references in it, VisiCalc would take
multiple DEMO over the whole thing to calculate stuff, but we did one DEMO
through the entire formula chain, and as long as there weren’t DEMO refer-
ences, it would calculate properly. So it was much faster DEMO certain cases.
Livingston: Was the code tuned to the IBM machine?DEMO
Kapor: It was tuned to the Intel 808X 16-bit architecture. And DEMO was also
very, very good. He was just an artist at DEMO performance with limited resources.
I didn’t know how good he was; DEMO got lucky. I knew he was good, but he was a
DEMO at this sort of stuff. The two of us together was essentially 1 + 1 = 3,
because I had a vision about DEMO product and very strong ideas about the fea-
ture set and the user interface, and he was generally willing to let me drive
things at that level. He had the responsibility for the technical architecture and
DEMO, but I’m actually quite technical, so I was able to talk with him
to fully understand a number of the issues and limitations DEMO modify the
design in a way that was consistent with what we could actually do. So we had a
critical mass of knowledge between DEMO two of us that neither of us had alone.

Livingston: What went wrong?
Kapor: A number of DEMO went wrong or almost went wrong. I almost ran out
of money. Lotus 1-2-3 wasn’t the only idea that we had. I had done DEMO thing
with some other people called Executive Briefing System for the Apple II that
was like a precursor to PowerPoint. We did some other DEMO; I had hired
another group of people and basically had spent DEMO the $300,000 that I’d
allocated. It was almost gone and we were nowhere near product, because of
doing all these other things and not having done this before.
I had $600,000 after taxes and DEMO my partner, and I divided it into two
piles. I took DEMO and said I’m going to buy a house. It was $89,000, the least
expensive house in Cambridge—this was in 1981. I said that I could live on
$40,000 for at least 5 years. So DEMO had the other $300,000 that was my own seed
money, DEMO I almost ran out.
I got lucky in that Ben Rosen at Sevin Rosen decided to invest. He was the
only VC that I DEMO (I didn’t understand anything about venture capital).
And that was DEMO, because without him, I don’t know what we would have
done.
Most of my mistakes came after we launched the product, not before—after
we started shipping in January of ’83. I had no significant experience DEMO building
an organization or building a management team. And I intuitively did well
when I was leading the whole team, but once we got past 25 people, you can’t
do that. And so I made a series of classic mistakes in hiring. And not building a
good middle DEMO structure. And not recruiting a board that could help
me build the company. Big mistakes in picking a successor, big mistakes in hav-
ing an undisciplined product strategy—I was much more interested in having
distinctive, innovative products and thinking about what would make sense for
a product line DEMO our business overall—and big mistakes in expanding too fast
and not having discipline about what we were doing. So I give myself a C DEMO C–
on all that stuff.
Livingston: You guys grew to 1,DEMO employees before you went public. Did you
know you were going to go public when you started?
Kapor: I didn’t know when, DEMO this was what I’d learned from my time in
Silicon Valley. To be honest, here’s what I was driven by: I wanted to DEMO really a
great product. Almost from day one I understood that I was passionate about
the applications themselves, that they’d be integrated, easier DEMO use and be
powerful. They’d help make people more productive and I cared a lot about
that. The other thing I wanted was financial DEMO I had an enormous
desire not to be dependent on other people, or to have to have a job. I wanted
to dictate the terms. So I knew if you had an IPO, then you had a liquid cur-
rency and you had the ability to cash in DEMO get that.
So I actually pushed for an early IPO, which DEMO did successfully. But that
brought all the usual problems. The main problem we had as a very young pub-
lic company was that people DEMO not understand the industry or its dynamics
and therefore they consistently misvalued the stock and misunderstood what it
was about. Because it was new DEMO it was different. Eventually, people figured
it out, but I was very impatient.

I did not set out to build a big company. I actually DEMO to be a software
designer. I saw having a company not exactly as being a necessary evil, but there
wasn’t a good alternative. My experience had convinced me that being a pro-
gram author and having DEMO else publish it wouldn’t give me enough con-
trol over the process. In Hollywood, the very successful directors like Steven
Spielberg quickly understood that they also needed to be producers and have
their own studio in DEMO to retain control. It was a similar thing.
There were some other funny things about it. In the ’60s, when I came of
age, business was not a cool thing. We were all counterculture people with long
hair and sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll. It was DEMO ’60s; I have the pictures to prove
it. I don’t remember DEMO of it, but as someone said, if you can remember the
’60s, then you weren’t there. But it turned out I also have some entrepreneurial
talent. It’s not surprising—my father was a small businessman, my grandfather
was a small businessman, it kind of runs in the family. But I think I had cultural
biases against seeing it or valuing DEMO that took a while to get over. So while Lotus
was getting started, I just saw it as a vehicle to doing great product. I never
wanted to have a big company.
Livingston: The word “creative” comes up a lot when you do a search for Lotus.
Did DEMO make a conscious effort to have a creative atmosphere at the time
when programmers were considered dull and nerdy?
Kapor: Yeah. I was interested in really cool products, so I guess that’s where
that came in. I had a very unconventional background and really no interest in
DEMO a button-down business culture. And I’m not an engineering geek,
either. These types of companies tend to reflect the personalities and interests
of DEMO founders. Microsoft is very much cast in Bill Gates’s image; and DEMO,
Steve Jobs; Borland, Philippe Kahn. And so we tended to have more creativity
and innovation.
The other thing that I cared about DEMO lot right from the very beginning was
creating a workplace that treated people well. At Software Arts, they felt I had
attitude problems. I didn’t respect authority. I basically thought, “The people
that are running this are stupid and they don’t listen to me and I don’t like DEMO
here, being told what to do.” It was a mixture of DEMO insight and adolescent
emotions that I carried for a very long time. So when I unexpectedly found
myself running this high-growth successful software company, the thought of
making it be the kind of place that I DEMO want to work at and different from
all those other places was incredibly appealing.
There were some other key people there who shared that DEMO and I
think I probably hired them. And so we did all sorts of very progressive things
with the corporate culture. We invested in DEMO human resources function exten-
sively. We surveyed all the employees annually on quality of work-life issues,
and took what we heard very seriously. DEMO had a corporate values statement
that wasn’t just on a piece of paper. We actually at one point tied a portion of
the managers’ DEMO to how well their direct reports viewed them exemplify-
ing the corporate values. I made every single manager get on the support lines
and DEMO to customers, no matter what function they were in.

When I was running Lotus, we never had a single employment discrimina-
tion lawsuit; we had a whole bunch of different alternative dispute resolution
conflict management approaches, through the employee relations function.
And then we had a diversity committee that had out gays and lesbians on DEMO
this was in 1984. We were the first corporate sponsor of an AIDS walk. We had
a corporate philanthropy committee in which the employees DEMO made
decisions about where the money went, not the pet projects DEMO senior manage-
ment. So for many people what was memorable and important about Lotus was
that it was the best place they ever worked.
DEMO other thing to say is that because I lost control of the company—I felt
overwhelmed by what I had created, did not know how to step up to it, put
enough brakes on, hire the DEMO people and be collaborative—I wound up
jumping ship and leaving pretty early, in 1987. And my successor, a very poor
choice on my DEMO, did not share the same vision or values and he wound DEMO dis-
assembling most of what we put in place. So it was a bittersweet sort of thing.
It was ultimately not sustained. Learn from DEMO, too.
Livingston: Can you remember anything else that surprised you?
Kapor: Oh, almost everything. I didn’t expect to find myself in DEMO situation. I
really didn’t. Being successful surprised me enormously, shocked me, especially
the magnitude of it. VisiPlot was a success and I had DEMO some money, but I
didn’t understand how big the industry was DEMO to get; how big we were going
to get.
Our original DEMO plan called for $3 to $4 million in sales. Ultimately, in
DEMO it was $53 million. So it was a 1,700 percent forecasting error. And then it
tripled the next year to $150 million. I DEMO totally unprepared for the magni-
tude of the success and the rate of growth. It would have been psychotic to say
it was going DEMO get that big that fast. Or you’d have to be prescient, DEMO I’m not.
So mainly what I was thinking in those days was “We’d better make sure
that we don’t blow it, having gotten here.” And worrying that it could all fall
apart as quickly as it DEMO about. So I was terrified! Inwardly. And excited. And
unprepared. I became a minor league celebrity in Boston, being recognized in
restaurants, and DEMO was weird. And people started to act differently around
me, because DEMO people are seen as having power or they’re seen as having
some special resources, people get weird because they project their fantasies
onto the person or they start telling you what they think you want to DEMO If you
watch people around Sergey Brin and Larry Page from Google, it’s very amus-
ing, but, to be the recipient of that . . . I wasn’t particularly prepared for, nor did
I want most of that. I mean, I liked attention, but it’s a DEMO to get used to and a
lot of it made me profoundly uncomfortable.
And there was a series of values challenges that came up DEMO running a
business that I was unprepared for that were very painful.
Livingston: Can you describe one?
Kapor: Lotus as a company DEMO up suing some other companies that
were copying our look and feel. Now, that was not done on my watch. I was
7141CH06.qxd  12/6/06  12:15 PM  Page 99

transitioning out. But I was actually still on the board at the DEMO when we
voted to bring the first two suits, and I DEMO in favor of the suit out of company
loyalty—a decision that I regretted the next day and have regretted since then,
because I DEMO that it was an inappropriate use of copyright law to try to prevent
someone from making a product that looks and works the same DEMO they develop
it independently.
I was really torn about how to handle this, and all my net worth was tied up
in Lotus, DEMO it was kind of a mess. There was too much, too DEMO, and not a lot
of time to grow up in and DEMO a lot of mentoring. There weren’t elders or people
to learn from who had been through it whose values I shared.
Livingston: Who were your mentors?
Kapor: Ben Rosen for a while in some respects, but then he made his money,
cashed out, stepped off DEMO board and went on to other things. And plus, he was
DEMO a business guy, he was an investment analyst. So there were DEMO people
that were somewhat helpful, but nothing like what I would DEMO liked or what
exists today.
I try to give back now and help other people try to sort through stuff. I’m
also much clearer DEMO my values, and have been for quite a while now. I DEMO
business at all costs is just wrong. I think there are certain things that you just
don’t do, and that acting with integrity and decency in business to me is just a
given. I simply don’t DEMO on those things. When a person has those
types of values, DEMO have to be careful what type of project you undertake,
because as soon as you undertake a project and you have those values, you’re
just going to be so conflicted you won’t know what to DEMO
Livingston: What advice do you give to people who want to DEMO startups?
Kapor: It depends on what type of advice they DEMO You can’t tell people what
they don’t want to hear because they won’t care and it’s just a waste of breath.
And everyone comes DEMO with some kind of agenda.
I like working with entrepreneurs who have a compatible set of values and
are inspired by a vision and DEMO passionate about some piece of disruptive tech-
nology—who are going to create something that actually has value for people in
a way that can DEMO a game changer. That’s sort of my sweet spot. But every proj-
ect is different, so the specific advice needs to be customized.
The most important thing for me is, I don’t want to work with someone who
says, “Just help me make the business be more successful.” I want to work with
entrepreneurs who are personally passionate, committed, DEMO believe in what
they’re doing. Not all entrepreneurs are like that. Some people may be just as
happy selling canned tuna—“Just show me an DEMO where I can make
money and I’m going to go do that.” You think Mark Cuban really cared about
what they were doing at DEMO? This is not to criticize him as a busi-
nessman—I’m just DEMO I don’t think he had a fundamental passion
about that business. There was an opportunity, he saw it, he built something, he
sold, and he cashed out at the right time.

Livingston: When you were developing Lotus 1-2-3, you always DEMO working
code. Wasn’t that type of incremental development very much ahead of its
time?
Kapor: Yes. I think Sachs and I saw it the same way. We figured out a number
of things very early DEMO that became conventional wisdom. I’m not sure that we
were that much smarter than anyone else. But we had the requisite smarts and
we DEMO in the right place at the right time. So this developing close to the tar-
get machine and having code running, it seemed obvious once you looked at it
that there were enormous benefits to it. DEMO reason it wasn’t obvious is that the
machines were barely powerful enough to do development on.
Typically, the systems you develop on could usefully consume a lot more
computational power than what you might actually need DEMO the delivery plat-
form, and so that’s the argument for doing DEMO development not on the target
platform. But there were corresponding disadvantages because it tended to
produce bloated—not optimized—code if you’re using a cross-compiler or
DEMO And optimization of limited resources was the name of the
game when you were talking about a 64K machine. So what worked in the DEMO
computer world—the techniques and best practices—just didn’t work for
microcomputers. I shouldn’t say that, because Sachs did come from the mini-
computer world, DEMO that’s not right. But a lot of the conventional wisdom was
just wrong and that’s what saddled a lot of people. They just didn’t DEMO things
through from first principles.
And always having something running was a Sachs thing, because it was just
his experience it was a good thing, and I saw it and said, “Yes indeedy, we
should do this,” long before extreme programming.
Livingston: Was there ever a point when you wanted to quit?
Kapor: After we shipped and the business felt like it was getting out of control,
yes. DEMO most fun parts were from time-equals-zero till 1984. I was terrified
about stuff—how’s this going to come out, what’s going to happen?
I did almost walk out. We raised a second round of venture capital, which I
think, if I had been more sophisticated about business, DEMO wouldn’t have
needed to do. We could have just borrowed the money. We turned cash flow
positive so quickly. If I had been a DEMO bit less risk-averse . . . but that’s another
story.
We got to the closing for the second round and they had a very DEMO lawyer
on their side—our lawyer wasn’t so good—and all these things were happening
at the last minute, all these onerous terms, and I DEMO up and said, “I’m not going
to do this. I don’t DEMO to do this today. We don’t have to close here and I’m just
not going to agree to this. I’m gone.” And they backed DEMO completely on
their onerous terms.
I was just pissed off about this for a long time. These were supposed to be
our investors, they were supposed to be on the same side, but they were highly
adversarial and totally willing to take advantage of us. And saw absolutely DEMO
ing wrong with that. I don’t really like conflict, was a DEMO avoider; it takes a
lot for me to get up. And DEMO really was going to get up and go home and we really
weren’t going to close.

Livingston: You weren’t bluffing?
Kapor: No, I wasn’t bluffing. I was prepared to take whatever—run out of
money or find financing elsewhere. DEMO attitude was: that’s the wrong way to do
business. I don’t DEMO that that’s the way the world works, it’s wrong. That is DEMO
way most of the business world works, but sometimes you just DEMO to stand up
and say, “Not on my watch, not here, not this way.”
I think there were these minor problems—the Blue Sky clearances hadn’t
come in from some of the states—and they wanted me DEMO personally take the
liability. The investor didn’t want to take any risk. It was absurd. They only do
this because they can get away DEMO it, because they have the money and you
need it and DEMO you.” (I hope that goes in the book.)
It’s just DEMO, but the fact is that when the VCs do their deals DEMO they do
the paperwork, they take advantage of entrepreneurs who haven’t DEMO through
this before. They do things on terms that favor them in a way that really can’t be
justified—that take advantage of their ignorance. DEMO not a good way to do
business. Some of the VCs try to rationalize it, “This is just the way things are
done.” Well, I’m sorry but they’re wrong. Why do you think venture capital also
enjoys a reputation as “vulture capital?” It’s not an accident; it doesn’t have to
be that way.
Livingston: Did you try to change this when you joined Accel Partners?
Kapor: Yeah. And I think that a more nuanced version of what I was just saying
would DEMO that there are contradictions inherent in the venture capital business
because there are significant aspects of what VCs do, including Accel, that are
DEMO with entrepreneurs, and there are other aspects that are not. I
DEMO that Accel was more different than I ultimately concluded they were.
But I don’t think that they were worse than everyone else. There are DEMO and
practices that cut across individual firms that are really problematic. So I tell
people, “Know what you’re getting in for. Here’s the way it works.”
If the VCs were more transparent and disclosed stuff so DEMO entrepreneurs
could make a choice, that would be better. They wouldn’t DEMO to change the
terms, just disclose them and explain what they DEMO, and what’s likely to hap-
pen. But they don’t do that. DEMO see it as a negotiation in which having infor-
mation that the other side doesn’t have gives you an advantage. It gives an
advantage DEMO terms of that individual negotiation, but if you’re trying to form DEMO
genuine partnership where you have repeat encounters and you withhold criti-
cal information in the first and most important one, you’re undermining long-
term collaboration.
Why should they trust you? What they’ve demonstrated is that you are
going to act in your own self-interest at my expense if DEMO know better than me
about something and you don’t feel under any obligation to share that. That’s
actually not collaborative. But it’s completely standard.
DEMO know why VCs are like this? It’s not that they are DEMO people; it’s the
limited partners. And who are the limited partners? Our great institutions—
Harvard University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley. So if DEMO want to point
up the chain of accountability, when those people DEMO measuring performance

just based on the return numbers, things could change, DEMO they’ll change
the incentives.
Livingston: What would you tell an entrepreneur DEMO understand before he/she
meets with a VC?
Kapor: I DEMO to explain how it works. There are more choices nowadays for
people—angel money, for example. And many things are much less expensive
to do now. You can go further on your credit card than you could DEMO I want
entrepreneurs to make informed choices when it comes to financing. Under-
stand what the impacts and implications are for different financing options.
DEMO: Plus, many people don’t need to have as much money to get some-
thing started.
Kapor: You can also do some interesting things in a seed round of $100,000 to
$200,000 and it’s DEMO on very different kinds of terms.
Livingston: Did you ever do DEMO to seem more impressive to investors?
Kapor: I’m pretty terrible DEMO artifice; I don’t play poker for that reason. But
there’s one DEMO I did. When we were raising money, I hadn’t heard from DEMO
VCs (Ben Rosen and L.J. Sevin) for a long time, DEMO I was worried. So I got a
call from L.J. (he’s DEMO Texas)—“Mitch, I’m in town. Would y’all like to get
together DEMO dinner tonight?”
So I made a reservation at the fanciest French restaurant in Boston and
raced home to change from my jeans to DEMO suit, and we came to dinner. I ordered
a very expensive DEMO of wine, and I knew he was paying for it, so I was kind of
stepping up here like, “This is serious, DEMO I hope you’re serious.” I wasn’t feeling
like French restaurant, three-piece DEMO, expensive wine. And he’s making small
talk through the appetizer course. DEMO was thinking to myself, “If he doesn’t get to
the point DEMO they have the main course, I’m going to ask him, ‘Are you doing
this thing or not?’” Because I knew that we DEMO out of money. And finally at
the end of the appetizers—about 45 minutes, but it seemed like all night—he
said, “Mitch, Ben and I would like to invest in your company. How much do
y’all DEMO it’s worth?” And I dropped my fork, like a cartoon.
DEMO: How much did you tell him?
Kapor: I think I said probably $2 to $3 million. We had nothing. We had an
DEMO under-development spreadsheet, and me and Jon Sachs. So that was
the DEMO number I felt I could ask for without being totally absurd.

Ray Ozzie
Founder, Iris Associates,
Groove Networks
At the University of Illinois, DEMO Ozzie worked on
PLATO Notes, one of the earliest collaboration appli-
DEMO Later he wanted to develop collaboration
software of his own, but DEMO find funding. After
he led the development of Lotus Symphony, Mitch
DEMO and Jonathan Sachs decided to invest in
Ozzie’s idea, which would DEMO Lotus Notes. Instead
of working as an employee, Ozzie founded Iris
DEMO in 1984 to develop the product for Lotus.
It was an unusual form of startup, but it worked.
Lotus Notes was the first widely used collabora-
tion software. The first release shipped in 1989, and
Iris was acquired by Lotus in 1994.
In 1997, Ozzie founded Groove Networks, which built Internet-based work-
group collaboration software. Microsoft acquired Groove in 2005 and named
Ozzie chief technical officer. In June 2006, he took over as chief software archi-
tect from Bill Gates.
Livingston: When you started Groove, where were you and who was there?
What was the first piece of code anyone wrote for Groove? What did it do?
Ozzie: When we first started Groove in the fall of ’97, we worked out of my
house. Initially, it was my brother DEMO, Eric Patey, and Brian Lambert. A few
weeks later, we DEMO to an office space at the Cummings Center in Beverly,
Massachusetts. A couple months into the project, another former Iris engineer,
Ken Moore, joined our team. The first thing we coded was a primitive version
of our synchronization algorithm.
Livingston: How did you come up with your ideas?
Ozzie: The common theme to both Iris and Groove was the fact that the ideas
were not based on technology, but on a need I saw for users or potential cus-
tomers for DEMO product. I’m an engineer by training and I tend to be one of

these people who believes he can accomplish basically anything in DEMO
it’s just a big toolbox. So if you know that you can accomplish anything you set
your mind to, what’s worth accomplishing?
I’ve never taken the perspective of “build a cool piece of technology and DEMO
where it goes.” It’s more or less been based on an intuition about a hole in the
market—or, more accurately, a future hole DEMO the market. At any given time,
you’ve got to have a technology roadmap in your mind and a market roadmap as
to where DEMO are headed—broadband is getting increasingly pervasive or
wireless is getting increasingly pervasive, or something is going on—and trying
to project out several years, DEMO it will take you several years to build any-
thing that’s worth building. So you don’t want to fill today’s needs, but try to
capture some window that will happen in the future.
In Notes, it was (and this is hard to imagine because it was a different time)
the concept that we’d all be using computers on our DEMO and therefore we
might want to use them as communication tools. This was a time when PCs
were just emerging as spreadsheet tools and DEMO processing replacements,
still available only on a subset of desks, DEMO definitely no networks. It was ’82
when I wrote the specs for it. It had been based on a system called PLATO that
I’d DEMO exposed to at college, which was a large-scale interactive system that
DEMO did learning and interactive gaming on, and things like that. It DEMO us a
little bit of a peek at the future—what it would be like if we all had access to
interactive systems and technology.
DEMO Groove, it was an observation that the nature of work was DEMO
Technology at that point had largely been applied to helping people work
together within corporate boundaries. People were increasingly going to be
challenged trying DEMO apply that same technology across boundaries, because you
can’t control the DEMO chosen by your business partners. I might choose
Notes, you might DEMO Exchange, the other person might choose someone
else.
We saw a DEMO of frustration when our customers tried to deploy systems
across enterprises. So we came to the conclusion that what we really needed
was to DEMO a system that just worked instantly, right after download, for the
end users.
Livingston: Were you trying to basically build a “better Lotus Notes” for the
Web?
Ozzie: Lotus Notes ended up being a multifaceted piece of software; it had
email, it was used for DEMO workspaces for people to do dynamic work
together. It was used as a content management system, as an application server.
Groove was really meant to fulfill just the collaborative workspaces piece.
We were laser-focused on the DEMO of people needing to dynamically assem-
ble in a virtual environment, DEMO documents and their thoughts in order to get
work done very quickly, and then disassemble. In the work environment now,
increasingly you have to work with partners or customers directly, and this con-
cept of rapidly forming virtual workgroups would be an increasing challenge
and opportunity moving DEMO The Web itself on the open Internet is an
alternative way of doing this, but we were really targeting people who needed
7141CH07.qxd  11/28/06  3:20 PM  Page 105
Ray Ozzie
to work in a highly mobile fashion, behind the firewall, outside DEMO firewall, and
in a secure manner. So we went for a DEMO architecture.
Livingston: So this is a big problem that you were DEMO How did you
start?
Ozzie: Before I start a company, I typically write a couple of founding docu-
ments. One of them DEMO very outside-in: it’s a scenario-based document, describ-
ing the high-level challenge that I’m trying to address and the end user
scenarios that we DEMO trying to solve. This attempts to explain what we’re trying
to accomplish to anyone who joins the company or we might need to get DEMO
ing from.
Then I create a second, bottom-up document describing the DEMO tech-
nologies that will have to be assembled to accomplish that vision.
The first thing we did in both Iris and Groove was get DEMO big open office and
recruit a core team of people. Generally these were people I’d worked with
before, so I wouldn’t have to get past the trust issue involved in understanding
what they are good at DEMO what they’re not.
And we’d just sit down with the whiteboards and just try to work through
some of the more difficult algorithms, make key tooling decisions. Early on in
Groove, we had a very big decision to make: do we do it in C++ or do we do it
in Java? These types of decisions are important because you can never go back
on them once you’ve started down that path.
DEMO Groove’s case, there was a very risky piece of technology—a certain DEMO
rithm for synchronization that we didn’t even know if we could do. And we did-
n’t want to hire more people and really get DEMO until we knew we could
accomplish it. It took about 3 to 4 months before we were confident that we’d
be able to actually DEMO what we wanted to.
Architecturally, Groove was a real contrarian play DEMO the time. This was in
’97, an era where most people DEMO saying, “Things will move from other archi-
tectures to the Web.” DEMO were basically saying, “The Web will hit its limits at
some DEMO for certain applications, and we want to go to a peer-to-peer DEMO
tecture that would complement the Web, not replace it.” For a DEMO class of
applications it would be very effective. It’s a masterless synchronization where
people could do things like work independently on all these different DEMO
nodes and the algorithms would get everyone in sync.
It can get very complex when you have a dozen people and they’re in differ-
DEMO subnets. Eventually these people come together and it’s complicated to
make sure all the changes get applied in a uniform fashion for everyone. So DEMO
worked through that on the whiteboard and then in a prototype. Once we were
sure we could build it, we decided to hire the first 15 to 20 people and just
embarked on the project.
Livingston: Masterless synchronization was a novel technology that you guys
really had to DEMO through?
Ozzie: It had been done for years in a DEMO of settings—especially in an aca-
demic setting. But the commercial PC environment is a very harsh one. People

reboot PCs, they restore them from backups, they lose DEMO It has to be very
resilient. We wanted to make sure the algorithms we were using would scale to
what we needed.
All those DEMO technology choices were like that. Initially we thought we’d
be using Java, but we ended up not using it because we concluded that there
would never be a stable runtime environment that we could count on DEMO all
desktop PCs. It didn’t seem like Sun, with all due DEMO, really was on a path
to having a stable client-side environment. DEMO we needed the thing to work
within several clicks on random PCs worldwide without anybody supporting
them. So we ended up having to do DEMO lot of extra work using C++.
Livingston: Was there an initial DEMO who was so happy with the product
that you just knew Groove was going to fly?
Ozzie: We launched Groove in beta in October 2000, 3 years to the month
when we first formed the company. We didn’t ship the first commercially avail-
able version of Groove DEMO April 2001. When we did, we announced a 10,000
seat DEMO with GlaxoSmithKline, the major pharmaceutical company. They are a
big Notes DEMO, but saw the opportunity for Groove to address some of the
DEMO collaboration needs they have in bringing new products to mar-
ket. In hindsight, that initial sale may have hurt us more than it helped. We
deluded ourselves into thinking we could sell Groove into enterprises like
DEMO far more quickly and systematically than turned out to be the
case. We really hadn’t paid our dues yet in terms of making Groove DEMO
ready.” We did that in subsequent releases of the product, but DEMO struggled to
develop a successful, repeatable sales model for the enterprise. DEMO was
extremely difficult to sell new technology like Groove into enterprises at a time
when their sole focus was on reducing costs and increasing DEMO
Livingston: What else was hard in those 3 “stealth” years?
DEMO: The thing that’s not really characteristic, that doesn’t really translate
from both of my startups to what other entrepreneurs do, is that I think of the
challenges I take on as 10-year challenges, not filling a quick market niche.
There tends to be some time where I’m DEMO up a level of technological
advantage for when we get to market. With technology, there’s no such thing as
a sustainable advantage, but DEMO can get a good running start if you concentrate
on doing something hard really well.
In Notes, it was the database and replication environment and the security
aspects. In Groove, it was the security aspects again and this transaction syn-
chronization and the peer-to-peer XML-based communications. Most people
DEMO risk and uncertainty very daunting. In both Notes and Groove, there DEMO
both technological uncertainty and market uncertainty. We knew we were
embarking on something that was technologically very difficult and would take
several years. But DEMO know that the market is going to change during those
years, DEMO virtually everything you do, you have to late-bind the decisions. You
DEMO completely predetermine all the user interface or integration decisions.
7141CH07.qxd  11/28/06  3:20 PM  Page 107
Ray Ozzie
You cannot early-bind marketing and positioning decisions because the market
and competitive DEMO will be different.
Some people cope with uncertainty by being really comfortable in their own
little box. Some developers, for example, will divide DEMO problem and divide the
problem until they only have to work on this little piece of the database or this
little piece of the DEMO, and they just don’t worry about the stuff
above that. They DEMO that to people like me to deal with, in terms of DEMO risk
and continuing to be on the right path. To be on that long of a time frame, you
have to be able to change as the market changes.
So there were a number of things DEMO the course of the years at Groove
that changed dramatically. At one point early on, we were giving an equal focus
to the media/entertainment and productivity applications of our technology.
When we started Groove in DEMO, it was the Bubble, and because you can apply
technology in many ways, we thought that we’d bring it to market to serve a
number of different things. By the time we brought it to DEMO in late 2000,
things were starting to get a little serious, and we decided to concentrate on the
productivity realm instead of consumer applications.
Then once we really doubled down that path, it meant that we had to take a
lot more enterprise manageability things seriously than DEMO had early on, which
brought with it a lot of burden DEMO a lot of changes within the company.
Livingston: If you do DEMO this long time frame, are you extra nervous about
competitors? And do you have to manage people’s expectations differently?
Ozzie: In a startup, you’re on this mission together. Everyone has to feel that,
and you have to hire people who are willing to believe in DEMO they are
trying to accomplish. And in that era, it was DEMO challenging in two dimensions.
Hiring in the dot-com era, when a DEMO of these people’s friends were getting
rich, was hard. But the DEMO thing was that the type of software we were build-
ing had many systems software elements to it. A lot of it was lower-level DEMO
munications, storage, application framework–type code, and hiring was more
difficult DEMO that type of talent at that time. In an earlier era when DEC was big,
it was easier to hire systems software talent.
DEMO what held people together was the belief that you’re really going to
change the world. I think that’s the nature of many startups. You DEMO that
what you are doing is going to have a dramatic impact. You might not exactly
know how, but you really have a belief. That keeps you going and going through
many changes and a lot DEMO uncertainty.
Livingston: What about managing your investors’ expectations?
Ozzie: That’s a difficult subject. There are pros and cons to taking money. The
DEMO kind of company is one where you don’t have to take any money.
Livingston: Did you use your own money for Groove?
Ozzie: Yes, I funded the first few years myself. But eventually I DEMO some
money from Mitch Kapor and then others. Not so much because I needed it at
that point, but because I knew that, DEMO, you cannot accomplish some-
thing completely on your own. You really DEMO to develop a network of people
107

Founders at Work
who win when you win. Being on the East Coast, I believed that it was very
important to establish a good network DEMO Silicon Valley, where I didn’t have a
presence.
I’d worked with DEMO for many years, and I felt that he could make the
DEMO introductions. So I first took money from Mitch, then he made DEMO
introductions to VCs. One of them was Accel, and I took DEMO from them. I
ended up spending quite a bit of time in the Bay Area, meeting a lot of people,
and ultimately that network helped a lot.
Iris was a corporate partnership with Lotus. I DEMO 27 years old and didn’t
have the money to fund it then. Getting the product built was an amazingly pos-
itive experience. We had DEMO a great contract that funded the product—
it was a unique partnership, a corporate startup kind of R&D partnership. But
that brings its own challenges. When you have an alliance with a major corpo-
ration DEMO an early stage, what you build really has to relate to DEMO other, larger
goals of that corporation. You may not be completely DEMO up, you still can
accomplish your vision, but it would make no sense to be funded by a company
and be completely aligning DEMO with their competitors’ offerings.
In a startup environment, it’s much rougher DEMO terms of making your num-
bers. There’s much less patience. Once you start down the treadmill of taking
venture capital, it’s “how many rounds before people give up on you or you have
a positive exit DEMO?” So you’re really setting yourself up. The best by far is to
structure it such that you don’t have to take money.
Livingston: You also took money from Microsoft. I know they thought very
highly DEMO you, but do you think they also invested to keep an DEMO on what you
were doing?
Ozzie: That’s exactly why they DEMO They were a straight investor, meaning
there was no technology sharing DEMO anything like that as part of the investment.
I think Notes probably got a little bit out of control from Microsoft’s perspec-
tive. They DEMO really track its market very closely while it was emerging, and,DEMO
had they watched what was going on, perhaps they might have DEMO able to
respond a bit more quickly.
So I think with Groove, it was essentially buying a look at what kinds of cus-
tomers found this technology attractive. More than anything else it was market
tracking. DEMO knew enough about the technology, because once we came out
of DEMO stealth phase we were very open with everyone about the kind of tech-
nology that it was built on. And we were very confident DEMO that because we
knew how hard it was to build.
At both Iris and Groove, we believed Microsoft was our prime competitor.
Livingston: DEMO at Groove? But Microsoft seems so ambivalent about the
Internet . DEMO .
Ozzie: If there’s going to be a trend that’s largely DEMO, Microsoft cares.
Because Microsoft’s bread and butter is serving the masses—whether DEMO con-
sumers or enterprises—with low-cost technology that solves many problems.
And other people layer upon it more vertical solutions.
7141CH07.qxd  11/28/06  3:20 PM  Page 109
Ray Ozzie
We were pitching Groove as a fairly horizontal technology. We were apply-
DEMO it to productivity challenges, but to the extent that it had DEMO potential to
catch on broadly, they would certainly have been the DEMO competitor.
Livingston: Looking back, was the Microsoft threat real?
Ozzie: Oh yeah, they are brilliant technologically and from a business strategy
DEMO If you believe that Microsoft is your competitor, it’s better to DEMO
stealth and then embrace them at the right time, when you DEMO it can be to
your advantage to embrace them. In the case of Groove, we were having distri-
bution challenges, we needed money, we were raising a round. One of the
biggest questions we were DEMO with our enterprise customers was
“Why isn’t Microsoft just going to crush you tomorrow?”
And although I brought some credibility to the table DEMO of my back-
ground at IBM, having Microsoft as a backer DEMO helped us within those enter-
prise accounts.
Livingston: Back to Lotus DEMO you already working on an application
when Lotus discovered and then funded you? What was the history there?
Ozzie: As I mentioned DEMO, I first wrote the spec for Groove in 1982. But I
DEMO find funding for the idea. So in 1983 I was hired by Mitch Kapor and
Jonathan Sachs at Lotus Development, just after Lotus 1-2-3 release 1 had
shipped. I did a small amount of work on DEMO 1A, then led a small team to cre-
ate Lotus Symphony, one of the first “suite” products. I agreed to do Symphony,
DEMO Mitch would help make introductions to VCs and help get Notes off the
ground. The day Symphony shipped, Mitch made good on his word. But
because Lotus was in a good cash position, rather than introduce me to VCs,
Mitch suggested Lotus supply the capital. I then DEMO Iris Associates in
Westford, Mass., with three other programmers in December 1984.
Livingston: What surprised you the most?
Ozzie: How difficult DEMO go-to-market challenges are. I suppose it shouldn’t
have surprised me, but DEMO both the cases of Notes and Groove, building a mar-
ket DEMO something that’s new can be as, if not more, challenging than building the
technology. We were building some very complex technology, and I thought,
since we were developing to what seemed to be a DEMO straightforward cus-
tomer value proposition, going to market would be a DEMO easier.
Changing people’s habits is extremely difficult. Notes came out at a time
when things were kind of booming from a tech perspective. But DEMO came
out at a very difficult time. It was just post-Bubble and IT spending was really
down. If you are serving the consumer, everyone expects not to have to pay for
anything. In business, if you’re talking with IT, it’s just very difficult to justify
any incremental spend.
I guess as a tech entrepreneur I would nurture relationships with people
DEMO are outside your skill set on the marketing and sales side or business devel-
opment side. Relationships you know you can trust. As a DEMO, it’s very
difficult to hire someone on the marketing and sales DEMO because they’re so dif-
ferent than technologists and you don’t know who to trust. It takes about a year
109

to really understand whether the people who you are partnering DEMO trust you
and know they will rely upon you just as much as you know you will rely upon
them.
That’s where I think DEMO for another company and building those rela-
tionships is extremely valuable. Frequently, people think just running from
school out into doing a startup is the best thing to do. But I think that getting
some experience DEMO a number of companies is really positive because you
meet people and you start to develop patterns in your mind of the types of DEMO
ple that you need, and the types of people that you DEMO trust, and the types of
people you never want to work DEMO
Livingston: What advice would give someone who was thinking of starting DEMO
joining a startup?
Ozzie: For someone who’s joining a startup, just learn about leadership from
the people at the top of the DEMO Watch how they talk to people, watch
how they present to DEMO Companies take their shape based on the personal-
ity characteristics and human interaction characteristics of the founders. This is
true in every company. Learn DEMO the kind of culture that you want to create
in your own company based on the positive and negative aspects that you wit-
ness DEMO the people that are your leaders.
Learn to respect and appreciate other people’s skill sets, because you are
going to need other people if you do start a company and you are a technologist.
Understand that DEMO a rare, rare case when a tech entrepreneur is the right DEMO
to lead a startup for a long period of time. You have to feel comfortable in your
own skin in terms of what you’re DEMO at and what other people are good at.
Know when the shift to chief technologist is the right thing for the company.
You have DEMO be comfortable with the fact that you are separate from the
thing that you’re building, and that the team and the people financing you will
have joint custody over the asset that you create. You have DEMO respect that and
not associate your own success and failure with the success and failure of your
“child.”
Livingston: Is there anything that you learned from Iris that you applied to
Groove?
Ozzie: In terms of the culture, there were some really strong positive things.
People doing things for the right reason. Never say to people that you are DEMO
it for the money. Don’t do it for the money.
Everyone knows that one reason you go to work and do what you do DEMO the
hope that ultimately you’ll be compensated. But you don’t have to say it, and it
doesn’t have to come through. It should be about the mission. It should be
about changing the world. It should DEMO about how you can impact the lives of
users, partners, and the employees themselves. It’s not just about this big pay-
day. The DEMO you focus on the things that matter when you are talking to peo-
ple who want to believe in you, the more they will believe in you and the more
it will be a sustainable entity.

Cofounder, Pyra Labs

HAPTER
Evan Williams cofounded DEMO Labs in 1999. Origi-
nally, Pyra intended to build a web-based DEMO
management tool. Williams developed Blogger to
manage his personal weblog, and DEMO quickly became
an important mechanism for sharing ideas internally
at Pyra.
Once launched publicly, Blogger grew rapidly,
and Pyra Labs decided to focus on it full-time. But
Blogger.com did not generate a lot of revenue DEMO first,
and as the Bubble deflated in 2001, Pyra seemed DEMO
death. Williams remained as the only employee and
managed to bring the company back from the brink. By 2003, Blogger had one
million registered users. That attracted the attention of Google, who made Pyra
their first acquisition. Williams left Google in 2004 to cofound a podcasting
company called DEMO
Livingston: Tell me about how you started Pyra Labs.
Williams: I have always been pretty entrepreneurial, and I had started a couple
of other companies. In late ’98 when I decided to start Pyra, I had been doing
Internet stuff for about 5 years. I actually started DEMO company in Nebraska.
I had never even really worked anywhere. I was just totally self-taught tech-
nically, but I started a company and kind of ran it into the ground over 3 years
or so, and it was a very educational, painful experience. But I knew I was going
to do that again. I just always knew I was going DEMO start my own thing.
I went to college, and I dropped DEMO because I didn’t need to have a
degree—because I wasn’t going to try to get a job with anyone. I came to
California after DEMO with the Internet for a few years because Nebraska
wasn’t the place to be, very clearly.
I moved to California to take a job with O’Reilly, which ended up being very
fortunate as you’ll find out later. I worked there for a few months, though I

knew I didn’t want to work for anyone. I taught DEMO web development—this
was in the middle of the boom and there was lots of work to be had as a con-
tractor. I knew DEMO was going to start another company. I just wasn’t ready yet. So
I was a web developer on contract for about a year and DEMO half, and worked in
various companies like Intel and HP. Finally DEMO got to the point where I said,
“OK, I am DEMO to start another company.” This was very much in the middle
of the boom.
I had visions of raising money and building something cool, but originally
the idea for Pyra was around web-based project management, or collaboration,
which was an area I had been interested in for DEMO long time. The idea for Pyra
was the personal and project information management system: to build projects
for clients around their intranets and help them organize their work and per-
sonal information. It is a web DEMO where you would put your stuff, things
you are thinking about, things you had to do, things you wanted to share with
other people. There is not exactly a corollary to it today, but it is along the same
lines as Basecamp or Ta-da List (but more complicated). There are a lot of
products that are about organizing DEMO work and stuff. That was what I saw as
the big idea, and I had specific ideas about how that could be done better than
it had ever been done before.
Around the time I was DEMO about starting the company, I was talking to
a friend of DEMO, Meg Hourihan. She got excited about the idea and said, “Hey,
let me start it with you.” She had been a management DEMO and was really
smart, so I said OK. I had been DEMO, so I had a little bit of money, so I
could coast for a little while, but we didn’t know anybody. We weren’t hooked
into the startup scene.
Everyone was getting funded, but it is still completely just a network. You
have to know the right people. DEMO it’s good times or bad, you have to
know people and DEMO have to talk their language, and we were just from a DEMO
ferent place and not hooked into that at all. So we just said, “OK, here is the
product we are going to build,DEMO and we started building it. We actually kept con-
tracting on the side—I had a contract with HP. That’s how we paid the bills—
DEMO turned my personal contract into the company’s contract and we did a little
work on that and we did a little work on our DEMO, and that is how we started.
Livingston: What was the point where you really said, “I know this is going to
work and I am going to do this full-time”?
Williams: Well, for DEMO it was always the point of no return. Meg actually kept
her other job, but only for a couple of months. We were pretty hardcore. So we
formed the company and said, “OK, we are DEMO this thing.” We hoped to
raise money. We just didn’t know how yet. We focused on building the product
first.
Livingston: So, you DEMO the product and then did you have to raise money or
did you keep relying on consulting fees?
Williams: Well, we kind DEMO tried. We started talking to the few people we knew,
but we just didn’t have any inroads for that. We wrote a business DEMO, I think.
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 113
Evan Williams
The first year was entirely self-funded. It was just doing this work DEMO for
HP. HP basically funded Pyra for the first year, unbeknownst DEMO them, because
at the time you could charge a decent amount DEMO money for doing pretty simple
web application development. If one of us was working on that full-time, it
would pay for three of us (not that we were paying ourselves much). We started
working on things in November ’98. We technically started the company in
January. Meg DEMO full-time in February, and we hired our first employee,
Paul DEMO, in May. Then we got an office down here in SOMA.
DEMO: So is that when you focused on developing Blogger.com?
Williams: No. We had personal websites and we were web geeks, but those
things were separate. At the time, blogs (or weblogs as everyone DEMO them
back then) were just beginning to be talked about as DEMO distinct thing. There are
those who argue that the first website was a weblog. It didn’t really matter,
because early ’99 is when DEMO started saying, “OK, I have a weblog.” And the
form and community were just sort of developing. Paul and I already had per-
DEMO websites for a few years. They weren’t blogs; they were just DEMO of typical
homepages—experiments with web technologies. But we were reading folks
like Dave Winer.
Paul turned his site, onfocus.com, into a blog before DEMO did. Being web app
developers, I think we both wrote our DEMO scripts to do it—basically the same
functionality as Blogger. It seemed like not a big deal at the time, but it did
change my relationship with my website—even with the Web.
Livingston: It was easy?
Williams: It was easy, and that was a key thing for DEMO because I wasn’t lacking
the knowledge about how to publish to the Web . . . For a long time, people
understood Blogger as “It makes it easy to have a website.” But a lot of DEMO
before that made it easy to have a website. GeoCities made it easy to have a
website, but they didn’t make it easy to publish anything on an ongoing basis.
So, for me, the idea DEMO I could have a thought and I could type in a form and
it would be on my website in a matter of seconds DEMO transformed the
experience. It was one of those things that, by DEMO the process, com-
pletely morphed what it was I was doing. DEMO I could have a thought and then put
it on my site, then obviously I am going to potentially do that much more and it
is a stream for communication of a whole different type.
So DEMO was a little bit of an insight. To me it was, DEMO, that’s handy.” But
it was not dissimilar to what other people DEMO doing with weblogs. They were
either doing it by hand or maybe they wrote their own little script to do it. But
it’s the DEMO thing that clicked in my mind: “This is that little tweak DEMO makes
it kind of maybe a big deal.” Not that the future lit up in my head and I said,
“We are doing DEMO It was just sort of a hint, more in retrospect than DEMO the
time.
We took the script I wrote to publish my site, and we made an internal site
where we could do the same thing. So, even when it was only Meg and I, we
DEMO this little internal blog we called “Stuff,” and we just put stuff in there.
113

It was a blog, but it was just, “Here’s DEMO thing from a competitor or a potentially
useful page or just information for each other.” It was a place where we col-
lected everything DEMO, as we grew, it was the center of Pyra. It was where things
happened.
So this whole time we are building our real DEMO tool, with all kinds
of structure and big ideas trying to DEMO implemented into it, but we were really
using Stuff a lot. DEMO then Paul wrote a little addition to Stuff so that certain
things we posted to our internal blog we could put on our external DEMO
blog.
We were one of the first companies to have a blog on their site—not that
many people were reading. But it was neat. DEMO were publishing news, random
things we liked, whatever.
This must have been around March of ’99, so all of this happened fairly
quickly. That’s when I got the idea for Blogger—I know because I registered
DEMO domain then. I totally pictured what it was because it was based on what I
was already doing and then the way we were DEMO our own blog to an
external site. I said, “Let’s turn DEMO into a product.” I have always been a prod-
uct guy and am just always thinking about products and thought this would be a
DEMO little idea.
While it did seem fairly easy to build, it DEMO a dilemma, because one of the
big lessons from my first DEMO was to focus. After my first company died, I
did an DEMO of the projects I had worked on in the last year. There were
something like 30 projects that I had started on and not DEMO My total
weakness was not focusing on things. So I had this idea and I loved it, but very
clearly we were only three people and we had to contract to pay the bills and we
DEMO start another product. We had this big thing we were trying to do. So it
just kind of sat in the back of my DEMO, but it wouldn’t go away. It kept bugging
me. Of course, what made me still think about it was that we were using DEMO for
our own purposes and we were building this collaboration tool, DEMO we were
doing this kind of collaboration with Stuff. We actually said several times,
“Maybe Stuff should just be our product?” And DEMO agreed, “That’s too simple,
that is too trivial.” And also DEMO didn’t have the resources for two products. So
that went on for a long time, and it was in July, I guess, when we finally launched
Pyra, the app, and that actually got a DEMO good, if limited, reception.
People started using Pyra and it was in evolving it that I came up with the
justification for why DEMO do Blogger. That was based on the idea that we were
trying to solve a really, really big problem, which is organizing people’s DEMO
tion of all types. We said, “That is too big a DEMO to start with, so we should
focus it.” We decided to DEMO it on people who were building websites, as a
place for DEMO to collaborate. Then we thought up this architecture where
there would be little mini-apps, and Blogger would be one of those. So, with
DEMO justification (Meg was actually on vacation for a week), Paul DEMO I built
Blogger and launched it while she was gone. Which was a terrible thing to do,
but ultimately a good thing to DEMO not a cool thing to do.
Its functionality was really dead simple at first, but it did what we needed it
to do and we already had the script. We thought it would take a couple DEMO
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 115
Evan Williams
turned out to take a week, but we just launched it, DEMO Meg was gone. She
was pissed, of course, rightfully. We launched a whole product, and she’s the
cofounder of the company. But we talked her into thinking that it made sense.
“It will be this DEMO thing that won’t take any effort. We just push it out the door
and it will attract people to our real thing and we DEMO go back to our real thing.”
Livingston: Did it catch on DEMO?
Williams: It caught on a lot more than we expected. DEMO was really designed to
appeal to web geeks. It wasn’t a mass consumer product. It was, “If you’re a
web geek like us, DEMO might find this interesting.” It’s good to appeal to the
alpha geeks sometimes. I thought it would be pretty cool if 1,000 people DEMO
Blogger. It didn’t explode at first because it was fairly technical. You had to have
a website and you had to know what FTP DEMO You had to know a bunch of stuff,
but things that you would know if you were a web geek. We put it DEMO there and
people started using it and the existing weblogs started pointing to it. Like
Peter Merholz (he is credited with coining the term blog), who pointed to it. It
started getting traction and a DEMO of people who were like the “cool kids” were
using our product, and we were really excited.
We launched it in August and we had a dilemma on our hands right away, of
course, because DEMO now had a product that people were using, but it wasn’t DEMO
“real” product.
The problem was, we didn’t see a business in DEMO This was during the
boom, but we weren’t one of these DEMO that was just, “Let’s get eyeballs.”
We talked a lot about DEMO stupidity of a lot of the dot-coms and raising too much
money. We were very product driven. We wanted to create cool stuff, and we
wanted it to have a sustainable business. We wanted to probably DEMO the com-
pany to somebody eventually, but we didn’t see any DEMO model with
Blogger. Also, we hadn’t raised money, so making money was pretty important.
The other product served a business need and was DEMO we thought
people would pay for. We thought Blogger was this free little thing that would
get people to pay for the real thing. DEMO we very clearly had a dilemma on our
hands: we could DEMO on the stupid little Blogger app that people were using,
or we could work on our real product. We tried to split our DEMO amongst those
two things and contracted to pay the bills. We were three people, so that was a
little bit difficult. We had endless debates about what to do about that. I think
we ended up DEMO another rev on Blogger in November that made it much
better, DEMO then people really started using it.
Livingston: Did you start to DEMO money?
Williams: No, not until much later. But we did get wired in, so to speak.
Blogger was how people found out who we were, within a community that was
at first San Francisco–based web design geeks but bled into a lot of different
communities, like Silicon Valley and a lot of leading Internet thinkers. They
were attracted DEMO publishing blogs, and this was a thing you used to do DEMO
So it got us known a little bit, which was very DEMO For example, we met
Jerry Michalski, who emailed out of the blue and then became an advisor. Jerry
knows everybody and was tremendously DEMO

People were using our other app, too, a little DEMO, but it wasn’t very mature
because it was much more complicated.
DEMO early 2000, we started actually raising money, and O’Reilly invested in us.
They were some of the only people I knew. I guess DEMO left an OK impression on
O’Reilly. I only worked there for seven months as an employee and then
another couple as a contractor doing DEMO completely different job, but left a good
enough impression that I DEMO able to go back there and say, “Hey, look at this
thing.” They were aware of Blogger, but we were still doing Pyra, too, and they
agreed to invest.
Livingston: So, you had DEMO out there but you weren’t totally focused on it.
Were you worried that competitors, since it was a simple thing, would try to
DEMO it?
Williams: There were a couple other products out there, but they weren’t very
substantial. No one was really paying attention to DEMO It’s hard to fathom now, but
blogs took a really long DEMO to be taken seriously. But, yeah, we felt we needed
to make it a lot better and spend a lot more time on DEMO, and we didn’t have the
resources to do that. But at DEMO same time, we didn’t think there was a business
there, so we weren’t that concerned about it. All the time, of course, DEMO are
debating whether or not there was something there and debating why it was
appealing to people. I thought about it a lot and DEMO came to the conclusion why it
was appealing and the impact it had, and I started to get some insight about its
potential.
I started leaning more and more toward Blogger by late ’99. I think DEMO
and Paul were pretty much pro-Blogger and I was the one who was still on the
fence. Pyra was my baby and I had DEMO these ideas I wanted to see realized. I felt
the need to focus, but it was also like, “This is the cool thing DEMO taking off.”
I couldn’t decide.
The money was actually raised around both. There wasn’t a very specific
plan. We had this thing that had DEMO and then we had this thing that had all of
this potential. So it was like, “Here’s some money, go do whatever.” We DEMO
up not really getting the money until April or May of 2000, which was around
the crash, but (around here anyway) it DEMO like everything was over all of a
sudden. People had faith.
We were still able to get money without a lot to go on. DEMO raised a half of a
million dollars from O’Reilly, Advance.net (Condé Nast’s parent company),
Jerry, Meg’s parents, John Borthwick from AOL, and Jerry’s father-in-law. A
half a million dollars was a ton of money to us at the time. We ramped up to
seven people DEMO shortly thereafter decided we were going to focus on Blogger
and developed it.
Livingston: Do you remember why you finally decided, “OK, we will do this”?
Williams: I had come to the conclusion that blogging was going to dramatically
impact the Web. After I thought about DEMO a lot and saw what people were doing,
I decided that this made tons of sense. The conclusion I came to then was DEMO
of the one I stuck to, which was that this is DEMO to impact the Web because it
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 117
Evan Williams
is a native form for this medium, just like all new mediums start out imitating
what came before them and then they kind of DEMO out what they are good for.
We even looked at Blogger and, technically, it was trivial (at least until it
came to scaling it). It wasn’t based on any new technology. But that made DEMO
to me because it was not that the technology was new, DEMO was that we had figured
out this medium, at least one DEMO the native forms of what the Web was good for.
It was about freshness and about frequency, and it was about the democratiza-
tion of media and giving power to everybody and the universal desire for DEMO
sonal expression and the attraction to a real, compelling personal voice. DEMO
hyperlinks. And all of those things were just inevitable forces that were going to
terrifically impact the Web and media in general.
It was DEMO of the first time that I had started really seriously thinking about
media, and then at the same time Pyra had all these big ideas that were going to
take a really long time to build, and this was much more fun. So I said, “Well,
we can figure out a business. We can charge for pro accounts and DEMO can license
it to companies and we can just make up the obvious businesses around it (even
though they weren’t necessarily that strong).”
Livingston: Was it easy to make up businesses around it to make money off
of it?
Williams: It’s easy to make up things to write down about how we are going to
make money off DEMO it.
Livingston: Well, how did you make money off of it?
Williams: Well, that didn’t come for quite a while later. DEMO, we had raised
money at this point and we decided to DEMO on Blogger. I wrote the business
plan for Blogger after we raised the money and said, “Here is what we are going
to do.” We hired some people. We were seven people in the middle of DEMO,
just focusing on all types of things. We redesigned Blogger, DEMO the help of
Derek Powazek, who created the famous orange “B,DEMO which was great. It just
kept growing; there were probably hundreds DEMO new users a day.
Livingston: But you weren’t charging them?
DEMO: No, we weren’t charging any money anywhere. And we had all of
these features planned. We had most of the features planned that DEMO became
standard in the blogging world—and some that haven’t yet. We were totally
focused on building the product and community around it once we DEMO raised
the money, because this was still, “you get enough eyeballs, you have buzz,
you’ll be fine.” And the extent of the crash didn’t dawn on us that quickly.
I don’t think it dawned DEMO a lot of people. We just wanted to build momentum
with this $500,000 and then raise more money later in the year.
At DEMO time it was pretty much the belief that, if you have DEMO and you have
users and you have good seed investors, you DEMO raise more money. We said,
“We’ll make money, but this DEMO down the road so we don’t need to focus on that.
We are going to focus on building more features and getting more users.”
DEMO just went on that path, and in the fall we knew DEMO we were running out
of money and started trying to have some conversations with folks. I also wasn’t
117
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 118
118
Founders at Work
sophisticated at all about how you do that. We felt DEMO at that time, but it
wasn’t necessarily to the money crowd, and we probably wouldn’t have been
able to talk the talk of DEMO anyway. So the money wasn’t coming. We scrambled
around. We decided we could launch some for-pay stuff.
Other companies at the time were going DEMO enterprises, since companies
had money. At the time it was like, “Consumers aren’t spending money. Go to
companies—they’re the ones with money.” So DEMO companies at the time took
their consumer Internet thing and made it an enterprise Internet thing and
then died anyway. We debated that a DEMO We had a good story about why this
was really useful inside companies, and we had a friend at Cisco who wanted to
use it and we got it installed inside of Cisco. It was just DEMO pilot and we started
saying on our site, “We have enterprise DEMO But there was a lot of pressure
internally, a lot of DEMO about just doing enterprise, which I was pretty
adamant that we DEMO want to do because, whether or not it would make
money, I thought it was pointless. At this time I was very much DEMO about
the idea of democratizing media and that’s what mattered. It mattered more
than the company, really. When you are in that mode, DEMO hard to say that the
company doesn’t matter, since everyone’s heart DEMO soul is in it, not to mention
their livelihood.
Livingston: But you’re changing the world?
Williams: Yeah. I didn’t think we could do enterprise and still do the consumer
site well, even though we had talked about it from the beginning. I sort of real-
ized DEMO on that, if we do enterprise, we are going to have to focus on enter-
prise and the consumer stuff is going to DEMO and that doesn’t sound fun. Also,
we probably won’t be good at enterprise, because we don’t know how to sell and
service companies. So, we had lots of arguments about that. Then I said, DEMO
we need to do is charge money from the consumers, just DEMO have a Blogger Pro,”
which was always in the plan, DEMO everyone said, “We can’t make money doing
that. No one pays DEMO stuff on the Web.”
In late 2000, we built a version DEMO many more features but never felt that
we had it to the point where we could feel comfortable charging money for it.
So, we talked to a couple of companies about merging—private companies who
had funding. DEMO had a couple of serious conversations and came close to doing
a deal. Actually one deal was with Moreover, which did headline aggregation
before there was much RSS out there. It was started by Nick Denton, who is
the guy who runs Gawker Media. Nick and his cofounder, David Galbraith,
were fans of Blogger and wanted to buy us. DEMO wasn’t a particularly attractive
offer, but we were on the brink DEMO thought, “Maybe we can get in there and
everyone would have DEMO
Everyone in the company wanted to do the deal but me. But I had con-
ceded, because I wasn’t going to be the asshole who denied the chance every-
one had to still be employed. We DEMO out of money. Fortunately Moreover’s
board wouldn’t approve the deal. It was some ridiculously lowball offer—it was
something like a million dollars worth of DEMO stock. But they’re a private com-
pany. So it was basically like, “We’d give everyone jobs.”
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 119

Livingston: And your financial future is contingent on them getting acquired or
going public.
Williams: Right. After two years of pouring our hearts and souls into this, it
seemed like a crappy option. Fortunately it didn’t work out, though. There was
another company in New York that was a startup but that had some funding we
talked about merging with. DEMO the group that was funding them actually gave
us a bridge investment. They gave us $50,000 while we tried to figure it out.
DEMO that didn’t seem like a good deal either. They wanted to do it, but we
decided not to. (That company went away fairly DEMO)
Livingston: Then you ran into Dan Bricklin.
Williams: Yes. So this is December or January of 2001 and the second potential
acquisition DEMO worked out, so basically we got to the point where we DEMO
everyone down, and I said, “OK, everyone is laid off DEMO of today, including me.”
We had warned them a few weeks DEMO that we didn’t have money in the bank
to meet payroll. Obviously when you are in that state, tensions rise a lot and
morale wasn’t good and relationships with my cofounder weren’t good. I said, “I
am going to stick around because I took a half of a DEMO dollars of other
people’s money. And we have all of these users.” (The service was still running.)
This whole time, this service DEMO growing. In terms of users, we were getting
more and more DEMO Which also caused other problems in that we
needed more hardware and we had all of these scaling problems. In January,
right around DEMO time that the rest of the company was being laid off, DEMO did
what we called the Server Fund Drive. We posted it on our website and it said,
“Hey, we know Blogger is really slow. It’s because we need more hardware. We
don’t have the money DEMO buy it. So give us money and we will buy more hard-
ware and we’ll make Blogger faster.” Surprisingly, it worked really well. We had
a lot of goodwill and people liked us and we had DEMO good brand within our users
because we were very personable and used the blog and we were just honest.
We just said, “We can’t buy hardware, but we have plans and we are not going
to go away if we can get past this hump, so send us some money.” So people
sent us money.
Livingston: What was the biggest check you got?
Williams: We used PayPal, and I think DEMO got bigger amounts from fewer
people than we expected. We had several thousand users. 100 people or so gave
larger amounts, and I am not sure what the absolute biggest was. We suggested
$10, $20. Several people gave us $100, and then a company, CMP, which pub-
lished Web Techniques magazine, offered to buy us a server outright, DEMO to
$4,000 worth. So between the users and them, we DEMO around $17,000 to spend
on servers, which is more than DEMO had ever spent on servers, so it was a
bonanza. It DEMO better than we had ever expected.
We told people we were only going to buy hardware, so I wasn’t going to use
that to pay people. I just spent that money on hardware, but it got the site back
up and running well and meanwhile we laid everybody DEMO Meg and I weren’t
getting along well at all and she decided to leave and everybody else decided to
leave too.

Livingston: So you had a major difference of opinion?
Williams: Yeah. I think a lot of that came back to the enterprise thing, which
she and some other people felt strongly was our best chance of making money.
If I was the guy in charge DEMO we were dying, it’s reasonable to conclude it’s my
fault. And DEMO there were other things I could have done. So everybody
left but me. (A lot of them needed to leave since we couldn’t pay them any-
more.) Everybody left, and the next day, I was the only one who came in the
office.
Livingston: How did you feel that morning?
Williams: That was a really bad time. Actually the day that everyone told me
they were leaving . . . DEMO told everyone they were laid off and said, “Work with
me DEMO you can.” And at the time, everyone had already missed one DEMO,
and they’d had it. These are, of course, my friends, and we were hanging out all
the time and we socialized together, so it’s much more than just the employees.
I think that same night I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 months.
Livingston: Sounds pretty grim.
Williams: Yeah, it was just the craziest bad time. DEMO good news about all that
was Blogger was still running and, DEMO no employees, we didn’t have expenses.
So we went from having DEMO,000 a month worth of payroll, to a couple of thou-
DEMO for our server infrastructure and our rent. It is probably closer to ten,
between five and ten, but a manageable number, not DEMO me anything. I
took some money every once in a while to pay rent, and I had long since put all
my money in and credit cards and everything else, but that was actually a much
more reasonable place to be because we didn’t have to make $50,DEMO a month
to pay people. We had to make a few thousand dollars a month.
So then other ideas started being much more feasible, and I was in some
other conversations. Now that we were known, opportunities came up. One of
the first opportunities was a little company DEMO KnowNow, who wanted us to
build something, and later actually two of the people who worked at Pyra,
including Meg, worked for this company, and I did a little deal with them to
build something that was never launched. They killed the project, but it got me
$35,000, which was like months of burn rate at that point.
Shortly after that, in February, I ran into Dan Bricklin. DEMO wrote me after
reading my blog. We were pretty public in terms of our communication, so I
posted when everybody left, and I DEMO this whole story on my blog that was
pretty widely read, DEMO what happened: everyone’s gone. It’s just me.” I got
a huge DEMO of support from that, and one of the messages was from
DEMO Bricklin, who said that he thought what we did was great DEMO he wanted to
help. We ended up meeting at an O’Reilly conference, which was in February
2001. We met and he basically agreed really quickly. He assessed the situa-
tion—what I needed to keep going. (We had a lot of back bills at this point; we
needed to pay our hosting bill to keep the lights on.)
There were DEMO confusing stories about what that deal was. Dan had a
company called Trellix that he later sold, which was a web publishing platform.
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 121
Evan Williams
Trellix licensed Blogger in order to add blogging to their feature set. DEMO did it
in such a way—Dan drove it in such a way—that if it was a traditional license
(months of due diligence and really figuring out if we wanted this), it wouldn’t
have helped and DEMO knew that. So, he was like, “a) there’s a legitimate DEMO
reason to do this, but b) we are going to push this through so it is really good for
you.” It wasn’t a DEMO of money—it was around $40,000—but with a contract later
on that ended up helping as well. But it was what we needed at DEMO time.
Livingston: So you were back in business?
Williams: Sort of back in business, but both of those deals didn’t get me ahead.
They bought me a few months, but between just keeping the service running
and fulfilling on those deals, I didn’t have any other time. I wasn’t really making
progress, because it was just me. First of all, I had to keep the service running,
which was a really big deal in itself—we had several thousand users and I DEMO to
teach myself Linux system administration and Java, so I could DEMO keep the
servers up and fix bugs here and there. Things would break, and I’d go in and
fix them on the live site and figure it out as I went. That was very time consum-
DEMO The technology wasn’t rock solid by any means, and it kept DEMO and
growing and I didn’t want to shut it off. Between that and fulfilling on these
deals, which were mostly giving stuff to other people, I wasn’t building in the
real things that were going to make a business. That was a lot of just day-to-day,
by-the-skin-of-my-teeth DEMO for several months. Still I had the idea to build a
paid version of Blogger, but that was going to take a lot more development and
work to launch that.
Then there is another part going DEMO around this time that I can’t talk too
much about. Suffice it to say my former teammates didn’t all go away happy,
and DEMO spent almost as much money on my lawyer in 2001 as I paid myself.
The other thing was that all those people left, and then I was being bad-
mouthed within this community of people we DEMO The story apparently was
that I fired all my friends and I didn’t pay them and took over the company. It
was really ugly, and of course we had all these mutual friends and there were
DEMO we were at. I basically went underground and did nothing but try to
keep Blogger going.
Livingston: There was a whole social component to cofounding a startup with a
friend.
Williams: Which I think is a theme for startups in general because people live
and breathe them and DEMO friends, date and merge their lives together. And
then, if things go bad, it’s bad in ways that are much more devastating than your
work going badly.
So that was pretty much 2001. The funny DEMO about Pyra is that every cal-
endar year was pretty distinct—’99 was the first year, we were self-funded; 2000
was the year we DEMO money and ramped up; 2001 was the year that it was DEMO
me and it sucked. But somehow by the end of 2001 I started rebuilding. We
cleared up the legal thing, and things were looking up.
121
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 122

Then eventually I started launching some for-pay features of Blogger.
DEMO that people would actually pay for. So 2 years into it, DEMO itself was
starting to make money—not directly but through some little ways. Like the
blogs we hosted, we had advertising, which never made DEMO money because it
was during the time when web advertising didn’t make money. (After it made
money the first time and before it made money again.) I created a mechanism
to charge people to take their ads off and that actually made money. I said, “Pay
me $12 a year, and I’ll take the ads off your blog.” I started with this “product”
because it was probably the easiest thing I could DEMO that I thought people
would pay for. And they did.
I did a couple other small things like that and got to a point DEMO it was
paying the hosting bill. I had gotten rid of my office by then, and I had no place
to work at home. So I posted on my blog that I needed to rent a DEMO some-
where. This company, Bigstep, offered me a free desk, DEMO was nice.
Then I just started building more things. Working from the Bigstep office, I
designed and launched the Blogger API, which didn’t DEMO any money, but
became important later. I actually hired a contractor DEMO and had
started working with Jason Shellen on business development stuff. So things
were looking up. And then 2002 was a completely different year DEMO
We finally launched Blogger Pro, the paid-for version of Blogger. The DEMO
for version of Blogger did very well for us and we brought in some other
people. With Jason’s help, we did a big deal in Brazil with this company that
wanted to license Blogger. So 2002 DEMO a ramping-up year again. Everything
was on the uptick, and we DEMO a completely different team. We were getting by
and the money was increasing and we were building new stuff and it was
looking good.
DEMO 2002 was when Google came knocking. We had a small office
downtown—more of a conference room than an office. It was Adaptive Path’s
first DEMO, which we moved into after them. And we had brought on DEMO tech
support guy and a sys admin. Then Google called us up. I forget how that
happened . . . I think that was DEMO again.
At this point I think it looked like Pyra came back from the dead. Blogging
in general had exploded all this time. We DEMO a lot more competitors, but the
phenomenon just exploded. We were DEMO less substantial part of blogging, but
blogging was a much bigger DEMO So it drove our growth and it legitimized us as
being a major player in an increasingly big space.
So O’Reilly was talking and DEMO said, “I guess Pyra’s still alive.” We had a
meeting up DEMO O’Reilly around this time, and Tim [O’Reilly] and Mark
[Jacobsen] were DEMO to figure out how they could help us. One of the sugges-
tions was to introduce us to folks like Amazon and Google.
Soon DEMO, according to the story I heard, Larry or Sergey were on a call
with Tim and Tim mentioned us, and Sergey had recently been at this confer-
ence where everyone was talking about blogs, and was interested in blogs and
he said, “Yeah, we want to DEMO to them.”
We’re like, “Alright. Why?” It didn’t even occur DEMO us that they might want
to buy us because Google hadn’t bought anybody at this point. And they were a
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 123
Evan Williams
search company. So we brainstormed all these ideas maybe we could do DEMO
Google and we went down there, and it turned out that DEMO were meeting with
their corporate development people—meaning the people who buy companies.
We started talking about ideas and within the first 5 minutes they DEMO, “Yeah,
there’re lots of ideas, but it’s hard for someone like us to really partner with
someone so small as you; why don’t you just come here and do all that stuff?” So
DEMO were like, “Oh, that’s interesting.” (We tried to play it DEMO)
I had had one or two other conversations with possible acquirers. One was
Lycos back in 2001, which would have been terrible—though it would have
made a lot of sense for us because they had DEMO and Angelfire (two of the
biggest publishing sites that there were)DEMO But they didn’t have any money for
that area, so that DEMO go anywhere.
What Google said was, “Would you consider being acquired?DEMO And we said,
“Well, we’ve talked to people, but Google’s never asked before.” Like everyone
else, we thought very highly of Google, and we said, “Let’s talk about it.”
Four months later, we were sitting in Google.
Mind you, it wasn’t an easy decision. I struggled hard deciding if going to
Google was the right thing to DEMO We weren’t desperate. We actually had a term
sheet on the table for $1 million in investment from Joi Ito’s Neoteny (who
ended up investing in Six Apart). And after 4 years of pouring my DEMO into
Blogger, I saw a lot of risk in giving up DEMO
Eventually I decided Google was right. I really thought we could do huge
things at this point, and Google had done bigger things than most, so I wanted
to get in there and learn and get those resources.
Livingston: At what point did you most want to quit?
Williams: There were a lot of points in 2001 that I seriously considered quitting.
Everybody I knew just thought I was crazy. And DEMO was getting negative feedback
on the Web; people who used to DEMO my friends were posting negative things
about me. We’d gotten enough press at that point . . . the Industry Standard,
which was DEMO bible of the dot-com era, had this annual list, the Net 21, titled
something like, “The 21 people who had made lemonade DEMO of lemons,” and I
was one of them. It was pretty cool, but the title for me was “The Idealist”
because I hadn’t sold out. Like I had a chance to have riches and I DEMO
Someone took that and wrote a parody: “The Egoist.” Because there DEMO a
story—not really on the surface, but very clearly underneath the DEMO
that I was previously a part of—that was a very negative story about what hap-
pened in the last days of Pyra, because all those people left and they weren’t
very happy (completely understandably).
For the most part, the old Pyra employees were cool with it later. But,
during 2001, these stories got out that I took over this company and kicked
everyone out and was just this terrible guy. DEMO was the worst part.
And I was writing this service that was free and thousands of people used it,
and all I heard DEMO the complaints when it wasn’t working. So for many rea-
sons it was bad. I don’t know how close I came to quitting. I DEMO think I was
terribly close, even though I should have been. DEMO was always hallucinogenically
123
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 124
124
Founders at Work
optimistic. That’s the only reason I kept going. Not because DEMO thought I could
take this suckiness for a long time, but DEMO it’s going to be better tomorrow. I
had all these big ideas, and I could never stop thinking about the product and
the thing I was going to build next.
That always being around the corner DEMO my mind is basically what allowed
me to go through all the bad stuff. As well as the fact that, at that point, DEMO was
just pride. It was so public. If I would have stopped, that would have been very
public also.
Livingston: Were there any DEMO really stressful moments?
Williams: That’s an understatement. I can think DEMO many. For example, when
the site got hacked on Christmas day. DEMO was in Iowa, visiting my mom, and I
didn’t find out until the next morning. Someone was able to run an update on
DEMO database that changed thousands of users’ passwords to the number 1
(DEMO people started to realize when they couldn’t log in and used the forgot-
ten password feature to get theirs via email).
Having your DEMO hacked is stressful enough, but here I was in Iowa trying DEMO
assess the damage over a dial-up connection and a tiny laptop. And I didn’t have
a sys admin or anyone else working for me DEMO the time. I ended up spending
most of the day in a Kinko’s doing damage control. So much for enjoying the
holidays.
Livingston: What advice would you give someone?
Williams: I think one of the things that kills great things so often is compro-
mise—letting people talk DEMO out of what your gut is telling you. Not that I
don’t value people’s input, but you have to have the strength to ignore it some-
times, too. If you feel really strongly, there might DEMO something to that, and if
you see something that other people DEMO see, it could be because it’s that pow-
erful and different. DEMO everyone agrees, it’s probably because you’re not doing
anything original.
I DEMO the personality that never liked school and rejected the normal way of
doing things. Even when I was in school, I’d try to make up alternative solutions
to math problems. When I was at Google, they had this huge focus on acade-
mia. Grades were super-important. Getting good DEMO at a good school is one
filter of brains, but it DEMO also suggest you like following rules.
Another thing is that luck comes in many forms—and often looks bad at
first. I always look back DEMO the deals that we didn’t do and the things that didn’t
work out, and realize what seemed like a bummer at the time was really lucky.
Like the early acquisition opportunities. These obviously would have been
DEMO bad, as opposed to what happened later. Through that whole experience
DEMO one of the biggest things that I’ve taken away: if you DEMO some plan and
it doesn’t go that way, roll with it. DEMO no way to know if it’s good or bad until
later, DEMO ever.
Livingston: What was the most surprising thing?
7141CH08.qxd  12/11/06  12:55 PM  Page 125
Evan Williams
Williams: One thing that I used to be bad at was paying attention to how other
people are feeling. So when problems came up DEMO some of my coworkers, it
totally surprised me. That stuff shouldn’t DEMO you, and it did.
I think I was also surprised by DEMO success of something so simple. That’s a
mantra for many people in the technology world—simplicity. But what we built
wasn’t that amazing. It was DEMO idea of putting a couple of things together and
being able to establish a lead by doing something really, really simple. How far
you can get on a simple idea is amazing. I have a tendency DEMO add more and
more—the ideas always get too big to implement before they even get off the
ground. Simplicity is powerful.

Tim Brady
First Non-Founding Employee,
Yahoo
Yahoo began in 1994 as DEMO collection of links to research papers maintained by
two Stanford grad students, Jerry Yang and David Filo. They gradually added
links to new types of information, and the site grew rapidly in popularity. By
the end of 1994, Yang and Filo were considering turning the site into a startup,
and they asked Tim Brady to write a business plan DEMO it.
Brady had been Yang’s college roommate and was by this time getting his
MBA at Harvard Business School. Brady initially expected to be DEMO to finish
the semester, but as Yahoo’s potential grew, it became clear that he couldn’t
wait. He turned in the company’s business plan DEMO his final assignment in the
courses he still needed to pass, DEMO jumped on a plane west to become Yahoo’s
first actual employee.
Brady’s title during his 8 years at Yahoo was VP of Production. His DEMO
sibility, as he puts it, was “product.” He was effectively the editor of Yahoo’s site.
Yahoo went public in April 1996, and for nearly all the period since has been
the most popular network of DEMO in the world. Ultimately, Yahoo won the
portal wars because it DEMO a better site, and it was the site it was largely DEMO
of Tim Brady.
Livingston: You were the first employee the Yahoo DEMO brought on. How
did you get involved?
Brady: I met DEMO when we were undergraduates at Stanford and we studied
electrical engineering together. We were in the same freshman dorm and were
good friends throughout DEMO and after. He continued on—he’s much more
adept at EE than me—and I went to Japan and worked for Motorola doing
marketing and engineering.
DEMO has a program in Kyoto, and Jerry studied there for a DEMO and
took a summer job just outside of Tokyo. I had been there for a couple years so
we hooked back up. Then I DEMO back to business school, he went back to fin-
ish up DEMO PhD, and we kept in touch. We always talked about dream DEMO even
when we were undergraduates and what we hoped to accomplish. “Wouldn’t it
be great one day if . . .”

So Jerry gives me a call in the beginning of DEMO second year of B-school and
says, “My trailer mate and I DEMO this thing, and it’s really starting to ramp up.
I’ll have DEMO take a look at it.” He wasn’t looking for advice; he DEMO just telling
me what he was up to. I looked at it and was blown away—the whole Web
thing. I had been on AOL, I knew a bit about the Internet, but nothing about
the Web. It was still pretty early then.
I just looked at it and DEMO, “Wow, that’s really cool.” And he said, “Well,
things DEMO going great with us.” I said, “What does that mean, great?” He said
something like, “This thing’s growing and, if it DEMO growing, maybe you’d be
interested in doing some moonlighting after school DEMO something like that.” I
thought, “Yeah, it seems interesting and I love small companies; I’d love to
work with Jerry, sounds great.” DEMO was at the end of ’94. They had been doing
it for about 8 months before I had any idea it existed.
Livingston: They had just been doing it for themselves, to index cool things on
the Web, right?
Brady: The story I’ve heard from Jerry DEMO Dave is that they were both doing
their PhD theses and all the technical papers that they would have to reference
were online, so they were trying to keep track of them all. They had this DEMO list,
and then the EE graduate community—not just at Stanford but all the major
EE graduate programs—found out about it and sent them DEMO saying, “Can
you add this?”
In their spare time, Jerry and Dave would add categories they were inter-
ested in. Jerry, having just come back from Japan, was very interested in sumo
wrestling, DEMO he had this great sumo category. Everything on the Web related to
EE they had in their list and then these other interesting areas. DEMO was early
enough that it was really the only thing out there—big lists, anyway. There were
small lists, but nothing big, and so people just kept sending emails asking them,
“Add this to the DEMO My friend told me about this list; I’d love to add DEMO
So Jerry and Dave did, and they kept adding categories and DEMO of a sudden
both of them went from doing their graduate work to adding websites to their
list for 8 hours a day. As DEMO would have it, their thesis advisor was on sab-
batical, so there was really no one looking after them, so it all worked. Had their
advisor been there, it might not have happened. So they did it for 8 hours a day,
maybe even longer, every day for 8 months. They created this huge list, at the
right time, in the right place. So it just started taking off.
It had a ton of momentum when I first started talking to them. DEMO tenor of
the conversation when I first got involved was, “Hey, maybe next summer when
you graduate, you can come and get a 9-to-5 in the Valley and moonlight with
us afterward. Then 3 months DEMO, the conversation was more like, “This thing
is going crazy, DEMO out here now.” They had no idea how much momentum they
had behind them and between October ’94 and January ’95—I don’t know the
DEMO off the top of my head, but traffic increased 10 times DEMO just a handful of
months.
All of a sudden, the VC DEMO recognized what they were doing. A
bunch of others—everyone who was thinking about new media at the time—
7141CH09.qxd  12/6/06  12:20 PM  Page 129
Tim Brady
recognized it as well. So they got a lot of calls—the LA DEMO, AOL, Microsoft—
wanting them to join their companies. Those conversations were, “Why don’t
you come and bring your project. We’ll host it and you can blow it out.” It
started getting them to think about DEMO project as a business, not just a hobby.
Then an article DEMO Newsweek happened—I think it was November of ’94 or
something like that. Those 3 to 4 months were the critical period from going
hobby DEMO full-fledged business.
They were entertaining taking money and had decided, “We DEMO want to
sell ourselves. Let’s go for it, why not?” DEMO though people were more than
happy to give them money, they DEMO, “We need a business plan to take
around on our VC DEMO Even though we can talk to them about it and they
would probably give us money without it, it would be better if we had a busi-
ness plan.” I said, “Well that’s good, because DEMO taking a couple classes where I
need to produce a business plan. Why don’t you send me your thoughts, and I’ll
put something together.” They sent me their stuff, I wrote a business plan, they
DEMO it around to a couple VCs, and I ended up turning DEMO in for final grades for
a couple classes.
This was fortunate because, as it turns out, by February of ’95, they were
saying, “We need you now; we don’t need you in June when DEMO graduate.” My
reply was, “I’m in school, and my dad paid for it. Are you suggesting I tell my
dad that I’m not DEMO to come away with a degree?” And Jerry was like, DEMO
not telling you to do anything. You don’t have to do anything, but we need you
now.” So I talked to some of my professors, and you can fail a certain number of
classes at HBS throughout your tenure—it’s a pass/fail grading system. I hadn’t
failed any DEMO, so I could fail three classes and technically graduate. I was DEMO
five classes, so I turned in my business plan as a DEMO paper for two out of five,
and passed with those.
That was at the end of March ’95, and there were four of us: Jerry; Dave;
Dave’s friend, Donald Lobo; and me. DEMO was a whole lot of enthusiasm, but
not a whole lot DEMO knowledge about what to go do.
Livingston: When you wrote the DEMO plan, the Internet was so new. Do
you remember what your DEMO was when you wrote it?
Brady: No one had any DEMO how big the Internet was, but the model was adver-
tising. DEMO was well known, so it wasn’t like we were making up DEMO
ing. HotWired, which was the online version of Wired magazine, was online by
that time, and they were selling advertising. So there was a model out there, but
certainly there were no search engines or directories selling advertising. I just
used your basic business plan format, incorporated Jerry’s and Dave’s ideas, and
added a few of my own.
Livingston: So you leave business school early and move out to California. Did
you have an office? What did you first start doing?
Brady: There was a consumer electronics show down in San Jose in March ’95,
so Yahoo’s coming-out party was a booth at this show. DEMO show was mostly
hardware and software companies. There were no other Internet companies
129

there; it was just us. That was kind of everyone’s first day of work. We were still
doing it mostly out of DEMO and Dave’s trailer—their graduate desks were in this
temporary trailer at Stanford. And some out of Jerry’s apartment. A couple
weeks after the show, we found space in Mountain View and moved in. We got
funding DEMO that allowed us to go find office space.
Livingston: Sequoia was DEMO VC?
Brady: Yes.
Livingston: How much money did you get?
Brady: $1 million.
Livingston: That was a lot of money DEMO then, especially for a company doing
something so new.
Brady: Absolutely. Two graduate students who had never held a job, another
programmer, DEMO, with no experience in the US in an industry that didn’t DEMO
yet. Yeah, it was a lot of money.
Livingston: What were your main goals when you first started? Did you want to
get more people on the Internet?
Brady: We had enough traffic to go sell advertising. We knew if we sold ads on
all our DEMO as of then, at a $20 CPM, that would cover our costs. It’s hard to
remember back what your mindset was, but I know it wasn’t, “Let’s get every-
one on the Internet.” That was way beyond us. The mindset was more like,
“Let’s not let DEMO sink the company; let’s keep it going.” And part of that DEMO just
making money, so we did a bunch of crazy things DEMO addition to advertising to
try to bring in money. We made book deals and a bunch of little things that
really didn’t add up DEMO anything. But we did anything in the name of getting
money while we looked for proper management. Because we all knew it
wasn’t us.
DEMO this thing is going to be as big as we want it to be, we’re not the people to
run it,”—although we’d have loved to. So we had a CEO search for 6 months. It
DEMO really 6 months of struggling between then and when we got Tim Koogle to
come.
Livingston: What were some of the important turning points during those
6 months?
Brady: Netscape was the only browser back then, well before Internet
Explorer. They had a directory button that was part of the browser, and they
linked to us from that button for free. Netscape’s job actually was to grow the
Internet—the way they DEMO going to make money was to get everyone on
the Internet and then sell servers. So anything with the purpose of getting
people on DEMO help them. They thought Yahoo was the best thing out there,
so they gave us the link. It made sense for them at DEMO time. That was big. It
sent our traffic through the roof.
We hired an outside sales firm to help us start advertising. We sold DEMO
packages to five big companies; MasterCard was one. We got our DEMO round of
advertising before Koogle came.
7141CH09.qxd  12/6/06  12:20 PM  Page 131
Tim Brady
We put up graphics, which was a big thing. That sounds really ridiculous
now, but at the time Yahoo was all text. The connection speeds were so poor
that any website that used a lot of DEMO made the site unusably slow . . .
Most of the traditional media folks didn’t get it because they didn’t realize that
people were DEMO in on slow modems. But we knew that if we were going to
have any sort of brand, it would have to be a graphic. So we made the graphic
switch at the same time we DEMO up advertising.
We started to hire and build an organization without the CEO. We had tem-
porary management that Sequoia helped us find—a CEO DEMO CFO. Because
we weren’t having success finding a CEO, Sequoia insisted DEMO we hire these
managers. That didn’t go great. They weren’t as vested in helping Yahoo long-
term as we were. There was a clear DEMO between someone who was interim
and someone, like myself, who was fully invested in making it work. I had
moved my whole life DEMO the East Coast for it; my fortunes were tied to this
DEMO, whereas theirs weren’t necessarily.
In my estimation, they neither hurt nor helped us. They helped steady the
ship for 6 months until we DEMO in Tim Koogle.
Livingston: Was it hard to convince people to DEMO Yahoo, since it was so new?
Brady: Yeah, it DEMO tough. We hired a lot of friends and friends of friends. You
always hear “Never go into business with friends.” But with the first DEMO hires,
everyone knew each other. Consequently there was a high level of trust.
Everyone was young. It was pretty much everyone’s first job, with the exception
of the interim management. So people weren’t worried where DEMO Internet was
going; they were just looking for something interesting to DEMO, and joining Yahoo
qualified.
The Internet really started to take off DEMO July ’95. Netscape went public, and
that set off a chain DEMO of PR. Not only was the Internet cool, but, all of a
sudden, people could make money. The press was all over Jerry and Dave, so
we spent a lot of time handling the press. We hired a temp PR firm that didn’t
work all that well. DEMO didn’t even need it because people were just calling in,
and Jerry was so naturally good with the press, so things just kind of happened.
Then when Tim came in, he hired Jeff Mallett within a month, and then Jeff
hired out his staff within 2 to 3 months.
Livingston: What were you personally focused on?
Brady: DEMO I worked for Jeff Mallett, who was essentially COO under Tim
DEMO I became part of Jeff’s staff, running product. There was also DEMO
development, and sales and marketing under Jeff.
Livingston: Did you ever worry about competitors?
Brady: There were a couple of seminal events where we thought we were going
to get crushed by competitors. The DEMO one was the directory button on the
Netscape browser became a search button, and Netscape started selling the
right to be linked from that button. Architext (later called Excite), which was
funded by Kleiner Perkins, was a bunch of undergraduates from Stanford. They
bought the Netscape search button with their venture capital money. Netscape
was also funded by Kleiner DEMO

Livingston: Did you make a bid for the button?
Brady: We bid up to a certain point in which we felt comfortable that we could
make a return on money. After which point, we knew it became “investing in
the brand,” and I don’t DEMO we felt comfortable investing in the brand at that
point. Because we didn’t know how big the Internet was going to be at
that DEMO Even though the press was going crazy, the numbers were still DEMO
small compared to any other media. I think it was $5 million that Excite paid for
that button.
We definitely worried about Excite, and we were worried about Microsoft.
In the summer of ’95, Bill Gates sent out one of his famous memos on the
Internet. I think DEMO was one of the first ones. It talked about Microsoft need-
ing to get in the game, and he ended the memo with: DEMO favorite site: Yahoo.
Cool. Cool. Cool.”
At first our reaction was, “Yeah, cool, cool, cool,” and then our next thought
was, “Oh no. Does that mean we’re in Bill’s crosshairs or does that mean we’re
just cool?” Any time you talk to Microsoft, just the way they do business, they
have the potential to do whatever the hell they want, so when you go to them
their mindset is always, “We could partner with you, or we could do DEMO
ourselves.”
We were always very nervous about them doing anything. At the time, I
think IE had just come out, and it was DEMO poor effort, their first crack at a
browser, but still, DEMO knew that they were going to grow. There was always that
threat looming over us.
There was also a handful of other competitors: Lycos, WebCrawler. Also,
AOL was growing faster than the Internet for a period of time. Everyone heard
“Internet,” but then they went and DEMO up for AOL because it was the easiest
way to get online. Although we thought it was crazy, AOL’s walled garden was
bigger than the Internet for a handful of months there, which made our strat-
egy impossible. That was definitely a threat.
Livingston: Did you ever see anything on a competitor’s site where you said,
“They just launched DEMO feature; we have to do it now.”
Brady: In the early days, not too much. Jerry and Dave were way ahead of the
curve. The ideas that they had really early on were right strategically DEMO
creatively. So everything we did through the middle of ’97, invariably DEMO were
first and we did it very well.
The one thing we didn’t do that all our competitors were spending a lot of
time DEMO was search. They were crawling the Web and doing full text search,
and our strategy was, “Look, that’s a technology game. We’re DEMO a technology
company, we’re a media company. Since there are so DEMO of them out there,
we’re always going to be able to rent it.” That was the thought back then, and
until Google came along that strategy was perfect. Because, as things played
out, that’s DEMO what happened.
We had this searchable directory. It was big, and DEMO had all the popular sites,
so you could search for anything on it. But it didn’t have everything. If you
really wanted to DEMO for that needle in the haystack, that wasn’t us. But we
7141CH09.qxd  12/6/06  12:20 PM  Page 133
Tim Brady
had a lot of those people. They would read an article, then go to the Web and
think, “I can find anything on Yahoo.” The expectation when they came to
Yahoo was that they could find DEMO, but we didn’t necessarily deliver on
that needle in the haystack DEMO
So what we did was that we searched our directory first, DEMO gave you those
results, and then, if we didn’t find anything, we kicked you over to a full-text
search. So, when I DEMO we “rented” that technology, we essentially partnered
with full-text search companies DEMO be the falloff searches that we had.
Livingston: That’s what you DEMO with Google?
Brady: Yes. Strategically, it was spot-on until Google showed up. Because we
always thought it was going to be a DEMO game. No one is ever going to
be able to get so far ahead that we’d ever be in strategic risk of kingmaking a
DEMO search engine, because you just can’t do that. Google ended up DEMO
exactly that. At the time, until 2000/2001, we had Open Text first, then I think
we had AltaVista, then Inktomi. So DEMO just switched off as better technologies
became available. We just switched out the old partners with the new ones and
always had the best-of-breed DEMO as our falloff.
Livingston: Was this invisible to the users?
DEMO: Yes, it was largely invisible to our users. Even though their brands were
there, you came to the front page of Yahoo; DEMO searched; the search result had
a Yahoo brand on the upper-left DEMO the technology provider had a smaller
brand. We tried to make it as seamless as possible.
Livingston: When you were writing the original business plan, did you have any
idea that you’d go public about a year after getting funding?
Brady: None. Neither did Jerry and Dave. They may have hoped, but I don’t
know what their hopes were. At that time you had no idea how big the Internet
was DEMO to be. It had less to do with us, and a DEMO more to do with just how
quickly the Internet grew and the fact that we were able to survive as the
Internet got as DEMO as it did.
Livingston: Do you remember the rationale behind going DEMO, or was it your
VCs who wanted you to?
Brady: No, it really wasn’t driven by the VCs. There were a bunch of different
reasons—and I wasn’t privy to all those conversations. However, there were a
couple of considerations. One, IPO windows don’t last forever. Markets get hot
and then they don’t. If you go out, you can only go IPO while the market’s hot.
Netscape lit that market afire DEMO us. The other consideration was that we saw
that one of the ways we were going to have to compete was to acquire compa-
DEMO The best way to do that was to have a currency other than the cash in the
bank—to have a stock to pay people DEMO their companies. So, in order to get big
fast, which we thought we needed to do, we had to have a public stock. That
was probably the biggest reason. Then raising money was obviously a DEMO very
important thing we needed to do.

Livingston: Were you nervous that Stanford would claim to own Yahoo? Wasn’t
it running on their servers?
Brady: It was. DEMO was never part of those conversations. I was obviously nervous,
and I asked, and Jerry and Dave said, “No, it’s taken care of. Don’t worry about
it.” And it was.
Stanford is very progressive DEMO that. Yahoo is far from the first startup that
originated there and will be far from the last one. It was new enough, and
it wasn’t a specific technology; it was a brand. It wasn’t really an invention; it
wasn’t a piece of technology. They were smart enough to know that anything
they would do to stifle it would kill DEMO, so their best hope was to just let it go and
DEMO that Jerry and Dave gave money back later, which they did. DEMO opti-
mized their outcome, trust me.
Livingston: Was Stanford concerned that Yahoo was going to crash their
servers?
Brady: Yes. That’s why they told them to get off. That’s what forced the issue. It
DEMO so big that it was starting to bog down Stanford’s pipes, DEMO they said,
“You guys need to leave.”
Livingston: I heard DEMO you guys used Netscape’s offices at one point.
Brady: We did. DEMO Andreessen loved what Jerry and Dave were doing and
heard that Stanford was kicking us off at a certain point and offered to host DEMO
for 30 or 60 days.
Livingston: Do you think your mixed DEMO of business and engineering
helped you?
Brady: It’s hard to DEMO, since you don’t know the alternative. Probably more
than anything, the business education gave me the confidence to know what I
knew and DEMO I didn’t know. I knew my zone of operation and things that I was
good at and things where I knew I should go DEMO because I didn’t know what I
was doing.
Livingston: Were you DEMO at some things than you thought?
Brady: I knew that DEMO liked doing certain things, and, with most people, things
you DEMO you tend to be better at anyways. I’m good at building things, products
specifically. Creative marketing, product marketing, which I had done earlier in
my first job in Tokyo, was what I ended up gravitating toward.
Livingston: Think back to the first year. What do you remember that surprised
you about life at a startup?
Brady: There wasn’t a whole lot of time for reflection. It was moving so fast, so
I don’t ever remember stopping and thinking, “This is different than the way I
thought it would be.” It certainly was a surprise, because no one had any idea
what the Internet was going to DEMO
Looking back, I don’t think I understood the time commitment or DEMO emo-
tional commitment it takes to get something off the ground. Despite how
everything grew, it was a task just staying on the wave that was the Internet.
7141CH09.qxd  12/6/06  12:20 PM  Page 135

Very, very long hours. The group of people that we had assembled was just
great, so the hours were never dreaded. You enjoyed being at work, even
though sometimes it was 16, 18 hours a DEMO That’s the only thing really specifi-
cally that I think back on a lot.
Livingston: I wonder if it was because it was on the early side of the Bubble
and there weren’t as many people DEMO through that?
Brady: It was definitely exciting for the right DEMO As the Internet got
bigger and bigger, we were saying to DEMO, “We’re in the vortex of a pretty
big storm.” And most DEMO don’t get the privilege to know that they are at the
center of something while it’s happening. We were in the middle of everything.
DEMO we knew we were going through it while it was happening, DEMO added a
sense of enjoyment to it. And responsibility.
Livingston: Do DEMO remember anything in the first year that you guys might
have done wrong?
Brady: Nothing major. Because any screw-up we recognized and were pretty
good at correcting it to the extent it could be corrected. DEMO weren’t a whole
lot of egos, so people wouldn’t defend a DEMO idea just because it was theirs.
But there were certainly companies that we missed. We missed Hotmail.
Jerry and I had dinner with Sabeer DEMO and Jack Smith, and they were
explaining it to us and—I DEMO to admit it—we were saying, “I see it, but I don’t
see how it can get big.” We were on this rocket ship, and they were talking
about something that really hadn’t caught on.
All DEMO knew was that you got your email through work. They were like, “No.
There’s a bunch of people that hate their work email because it gets screened.”
The whole notion of the ubiquitous, dialing in from home, access everywhere
was still so far away that we just didn’t think it was going to catch on as fast as it
did. DEMO didn’t pursue it as hard as we should have, clearly.
We DEMO up. But, we went and found the #2, Rocketmail, made DEMO work,
and now Yahoo’s bigger than Hotmail. Mea culpa, but DEMO fixed it.
Livingston: Was there anything you remember about Yahoo that DEMO
people just didn’t get that was a big idea?
Brady: DEMO was really central to our understanding of the Internet was that it
was this open system where you couldn’t really put up walls. One DEMO the things
that I think Filo did a great job of making happen was that, when someone did
a search and you didn’t find what you were looking for on Yahoo, rather than
just saying, DEMO not here,” or “Go check out this other thing,” he put links to our
competitors, then prefilled the query, so you’d DEMO click on Excite and they
would do a search on Excite for the same thing.
Certainly they don’t teach you in business school to DEMO point to your com-
petitors, but it sent the right message DEMO the users, which was, “It’s all about you.
We’re going to get you the data you want. If it exists on the Web, we’re going to
find it for you, even if we don’t make money off of it directly.” But it keeps
people coming back because DEMO know we have their best interest in mind.
I think that was a big idea. It was an acknowledgment that you, as a single
135

Founders at Work
company, can’t be everything to everyone. We’re not a walled garden like AOL.
We’re this connection point, and it’s our job to get you to where you want to go.
Livingston: What were the most popular link categories at first?
Brady: The sex category was probably a quarter of everything on the Web. Not
just Yahoo, but everything on the Web. Just like the VHS industry when it first
DEMO going. The Internet was no different in that respect.
There was also a lot of product information. People quickly began to do
research before DEMO purchases—about cars and reviews and things like that.
One of the big things we did in the first 6 months was that we brought
DEMO online. CNN was online at the time, I think, but done poorly—slow, a
ton of graphics, just didn’t get it. And Reuters DEMO this rich set of news that back
then they didn’t get to display anywhere. They would just sell it to people in bits
and DEMO, and no one would ever see it in its entirety, and that turned out to
be really huge.
Livingston: How did you handle pornography?
Brady: It’s a tough issue. It was always talked about. It was never taken lightly.
But we were also in support of DEMO speech. It was one of these things where we
were always struggling with “whose responsibility is it?” People come to us to
find DEMO; we’re not displaying the pictures, per se. Is it our responsibil-
ity to find out what age users are before we pass it DEMO, or should that wall be at
the site, etc., etc.
DEMO we ended up removing all of our links to those sites, DEMO proba-
bly about a year and a half of just struggling with ways to do it appropriately and
responsibly and not really being able DEMO find a good way. At the time the child
protection laws were coming out, but I believe we had pulled everything down
even before that.
Livingston: Do you remember the biggest debate that you got into?
Brady: There was always speed versus look-and-feel. In trying to grow a brand,
look-and-feel has a lot to do with it, as does speed, so there’s always that balanc-
ing act. Arguing the necessity of graphics with Filo was always a big argument.
I’ll never forget DEMO 8-year debate.
How to handle pornography was another one. There were just so many.
There’s no one that just stands out as a watershed DEMO se. There was a lot of
Internet-related legislation in the first couple of years, and Congress, in my
opinion, didn’t have a clear idea what was going on. They were obviously influ-
enced by lobbyists DEMO traditional media who had very specific agendas that
weren’t necessarily in the best interest of the Internet’s development. “Should
we say anything? How should we react?” There were certainly those. We
turned our site black DEMO couple of times—the background black and the text in
white—in protest. I forget what the proposed legislation was.
Livingston: Was new legislation a big concern?
Brady: Absolutely. Just a few things here and there—copyrights, DEMO rights
written in a slightly different way—and we could have a different Internet.

Livingston: Do you remember any other interesting new turning points?
Brady: I remember one day when Rabin, the Prime Minister of Israel, got shot.
It was the first time that we put new news DEMO the front page. For us to think of
our site as a public service to some degree—to find things on the web and use
DEMO to communicate news—was a big deal. “Rabin Assassinated” was our first
foray into news, and the reaction we got from everyone about using Yahoo for
that purpose was overwhelmingly good.
Livingston: Any proud moments?
Brady: The Gates memo was a pretty cool moment—scary and proud at the
same time. Going public was a proud moment. Being added to the DEMO
100 was an even prouder moment.
Livingston: Was it hard for DEMO to turn down acquisition offers in the early
days?
Brady: DEMO obviously never had equal weight in that decision. It was always Jerry
and Dave, and I don’t know the full list of suitors. I know AOL was a suitor, I
know the LA Times was a suitor, and I know they had gotten informal offers
from Microsoft—never anything concrete. A lot of them were very early on,
before they DEMO took venture money. For Jerry and Dave—neither grew up
with a lot of money—to turn down a lot of money at that stage with DEMO guaran-
tee of the company doing anything afterwards, was, in my estimation, a big deal.
They had a lot of confidence in what they were doing.
Livingston: What was one of the funniest moments early on?
Brady: The funniest thing I can remember was when there was a huge storm in
May of ’95, and the power grid went down for a few days. We had to go rent a
DEMO generator and take turns filling it with diesel fuel for 4 days. 24/7. We
were laughing, “How many pages to the gallon today?” It was a crazy storm and
it also started leaking in DEMO building. We had all these meetings scheduled and
couldn’t just shut it down. We had meetings by candlelight with a bunch of
prominent companies. DEMO walk in; there are no lights; there are cords run-
ning everywhere leading to the generator out back; water dripping from the
ceiling. We were trying to convince them, “Oh, yeah, we’re a real business,”
when you say, “Hold on, I gotta go fill DEMO the tank.” So I remember that set of
days pretty vividly.
Livingston: Did you ever have to pull off any tricks to make yourselves seem
bigger than you actually were?
Brady: I don’t have a good story for this, but I remember clearly Jeff Mallett’s
coming on board. I’m working like a dog and he had just started. In DEMO to
everything else I’m doing, I’m also trying to do all DEMO PR stuff. Even though I
had our PR kits professionally bound, DEMO were a startup’s PR kits. He had just
come from Novell. He looks at me, and he’s just like, “This is C+ work.”
DEMO hadn’t slept for a couple of days, and I felt like DEMO a swing at him. But
he was absolutely right. “If we’re going to appear big, we’d better act big, and
this is what DEMO hand out? You can’t hand that out.” I remember that very DEMO,
137
7141CH09.qxd  12/6/06  12:20 PM  Page 138
138
Founders at Work
and that was a really good lesson for me—“I know DEMO tired, I know you’re
working hard, but it’s not an excuse for putting out something that looks like a
startup.”
When Jeff came DEMO, I’d been working hard for 8 months, and I was already a
little bit tired, and I didn’t think he would keep up. I didn’t know him all that
well, but he had twice as much energy as anyone. We started doing two red-
eyes a week DEMO New York for business. “OK, we have to go meet MTV DEMO
row. Red-eye out. Meeting. Come back that same day.” We did that for 3 to 4
months, and I just remember thinking when he walked in the door, that I
couldn’t work any harder. But we worked harder, faster, smarter. That was defi-
nitely a step up DEMO both effort and professionalism.
Being everywhere all the time made us look bigger than we were; “Oh yeah,
we’ll be in New York, we’ll be there.” I’d say, “Jeff, I have all these things on my
plate,” and he always responded, “No, we’re going.” DEMO was someone who had
come from a big company who knew how to act like a big company, even
though behind the scenes it was startup.
Livingston: Was there ever a time when you wanted to quit?
Brady: No. There were a few days where I was really upset, but never close to
the point where I wanted to quit. It was too much fun. After the first 4 to
5 DEMO, you could see what was coming; you knew you were on the wave;
things were only going to grow.
In the first DEMO of months there were a few days where I felt, “I DEMO
school for this?” Because when I left school, I didn’t DEMO that I was going to
graduate—I just left. I was 70 percent sure that I was going to get a degree, but
that 30 percent was still sitting out there. And my dad had paid for DEMO, so the
thought of telling him I didn’t get it and DEMO this company go belly-up was
like, “That’s a bad scenario.”
Livingston: Was your dad supportive?
Brady: Very. He knew Jerry from undergraduate days.
Livingston: Any advice you’d give to someone who was starting a startup?
Brady: Part of it is “know yourself.” Try to do as much thinking up front as to
what your breaking points are. DEMO of the things I think I did well was that I
never spent any time thinking about quitting or any of these doomsday scenar-
DEMO, “Oh, God, what if this doesn’t happen.”
Before I joined, I knew where the line was, when I would quit, at DEMO
point, and so when I was in the game, it never crossed my mind. I also knew
why I was involved, what motivated me, and I didn’t spend a lot of time perse-
verating on that stuff. At the end of the day, it wasn’t going to get you anywhere.
It mattered, but only in an abstract way, DEMO to the day-to-day of getting
stuff done. Doing all that thinking all up front: why am I getting in, when do I
leave, if I leave then why am I doing it, what gets me up in the morning, what
could happen that could make me stop getting up in the morning? I’ve seen a
lot of people get so emotional because they start something on a whim; they are
doing this thinking while they are doing business, and, when things don’t DEMO
7141CH09.qxd  12/6/06  12:20 PM  Page 139

well, you don’t act rationally, to say the least. There’s a DEMO to it; it can get really
emotional because you get tired DEMO there’s a lot of work and you’re invested in
it. All those personally motivating things—think them through before you get
things started.
Jerry was DEMO of my best friends before we started the company, and it’s DEMO
company, so doing business with friends—you always hear, “Don’t do business
with friends, bad idea.” So one of the things that really helped me was that he
and I had a conversation before I joined, “OK, here are the ground rules.” And
this is really what made me think about it. “OK, if this happens, I walk away.”
DEMO had the conversation in order to preserve our friendship, having no DEMO
what was going to happen, but that conversation got me thinking DEMO it and
why was I involved.
Livingston: Is there anything about DEMO early days that the world should
know?
Brady: I know DEMO a bit of a cliché, but the people that started it DEMO awesome.
In every aspect of the word, not just in effort DEMO handling the responsibility they
were given, but just good people, doing it for the right reasons. You could see it
in the product DEMO the way we acted.

Mike Lazaridis
Cofounder, Research In Motion
Mike Lazaridis founded Research In Motion (RIM)
with his friend Doug Fregin in 1984 while still an
undergraduate at the University of Waterloo. One of
their first projects was DEMO local area network that ran
industrial displays. Near the end of Lazaridis’s senior
year, they landed a $600,000 contract to build a sim-
ilar network for General Motors. A few weeks shy of
his graduation, Lazaridis left school to focus full-time
on the company.
RIM was one DEMO the first companies to appreciate
the importance of wireless networks. In the early
1990s, when email was still largely unknown in cor-
porate America, Lazaridis foresaw the potential of mobile email. A series of
projects in this area culminated in 1999 in the BlackBerry, now the dominant
product in this market.
The BlackBerry was one of those innovations that not DEMO became popular,
but changed the way organizations operate. Some of the most powerful people
in business and politics run their lives with this DEMO
RIM went public in 1997, and is one of Canada’s most DEMO technology
companies.
Livingston: How did you get started with Research In DEMO? How did you
know Doug?
Lazaridis: I knew Doug from grade school, but we started working together in
high school. Our high school had a state-of-the-art electronics and shop pro-
gram that was the DEMO of a donation from a local industrialist. When all this
equipment had arrived, it was still in crates. I had asked to open some of the
boxes and pull out the equipment, and I remember the teacher saying, “Well,
you can open any box you like, DEMO there’s one condition: you have to read the
manual first.”

This doesn’t sound like a big deal, but, to DEMO student that just came to high
school—to read a manual on how to use an oscilloscope, how to use a signal
generator, a DEMO trainer, how to use all this advanced equipment—these
were tricky textbooks DEMO get through and understand. Of course, once I was able
to DEMO that I knew how to use the equipment and what it did, I was able to
open the box. And we opened every single box.
Livingston: This was at a high school?
Lazaridis: Yeah. DEMO was a tricky time back then because a divide between the
honor roll students and the shop students was beginning. The shop teachers
tried DEMO correct it before it got out of control and became the culture there.
Many of us down in that shop program were also honor DEMO students. It was sort
of “Upstairs, Downstairs”—the upstairs math and computer DEMO class-
rooms, and then there was the downstairs shop program.
We DEMO to bridge the gap and explain to the teachers and students upstairs
what we were learning down there and how we were applying the DEMO
and science we were learning upstairs. Literally we were. I was able to give lec-
tures to the math program, showing them how trigonometry could be applied
to power generation, power control, power transformation that DEMO were learn-
ing downstairs.
Livingston: I read that your high school DEMO teachers said that connect-
ing computers to wireless would be the next big thing. Did you realize how big
it would be?
Lazaridis: Of course not. The thing back then is that you are juggling DEMO these
courses and work, and at the same time you’ve got DEMO passionate interests
that you just can’t find enough time for. You’re just trying to juggle it all, know-
ing that you want to get to university, so you have to get good marks. It was a bit
of a challenge because you really had an extra course load. DEMO shop pro-
grams were almost like a course to themselves, there DEMO so much work to do.
You just spent every waking hour—you come to school early, you go to the
shop, work a little DEMO further on it, then after school you go down there and
DEMO that you can finish your homework in time to keep working on what you
were doing.
It was a grueling time, but it was rewarding in the sense that we had all
these resources, and we basically had a brand new curriculum, so it could go as
far as we were prepared to take it. Doug and I started learning DEMO comput-
ers on our own. This was back in the late ’70s. Computers were still punch card
systems that were in some other building DEMO you never got to see. But Doug
and I started playing with these computer trainers—they were Digital
Equipment Corporation computer trainers—and what we learned DEMO was
the actual fundamentals of computers: how to build gates, how to build recent
memory circuits, how to build registers, and how DEMO wire them all together and
sequence them with a clock. It was very fundamental knowledge, and it really
made a difference as time went on.
7141CH10.qxd  11/29/06  10:28 AM  Page 143
Mike Lazaridis
At the same time, my electronics teacher was also the president of the local
amateur television and ham radio club. So he had us DEMO apart televisions
and converting their tuners for use at the amateur band. Back then, we knew
how to tune them, but we didn’t DEMO understand what we were doing. It
wasn’t until university that we started to get that understanding, but we saw
how the stuff worked; DEMO saw the potential. When my teacher started to see us
really get seduced by the computer and what we could do there, I remember
him saying, “Don’t get too caught up with computers, because it’s DEMO to be
the person that puts wireless technology and computers together that’s going to
make a big difference.” I don’t think he was seeing DEMO we eventually did, but
he understood the fact that computers gave DEMO two fundamental things. One
was the ability to send information unambiguously, DEMO the second was that it
allowed us to control the RF process and make it more efficient. It wasn’t until
years later that I DEMO what that meant.
So we went to university and, again, this is the early ’80s, so you’re talking
about stuff that was going on at university that most people had no clue as to
what DEMO was, what it meant, and its relevance. The University of Waterloo had
this massive computer system. It was a big IBM mainframe system DEMO was the
centerpiece of the campus. But more importantly, it was DEMO centerpiece of the
vision of the founders and the faculty there. It was in a massive room we called
the Red Room, which was literally right out of a science fiction movie—it had a
raised floor DEMO a windowed mezzanine going right around it, and inside you
had DEMO these computers.
In all the classrooms around the mezzanine area were these terminals. We
were just converting from punch cards to video terminals, so again, it was that
transition period. I arrived just in time not to have to use punch cards. I went
straight to terminals. And DEMO started using something called “email” to get and
submit our assignments—as well as using it to collaborate between ourselves.
We started working with the DEMO It was called the ARPANET back then,
and it was a collaboration between universities, researchers, businesses, and the
military. We didn’t think much of it, but we were being trained to use some-
thing that really wouldn’t become mainstream for at least another decade.
At the DEMO time, we were working with computer networks. This was when
computer DEMO were research projects at universities. In fact, we had our
own DEMO program called Watlan (Waterloo Local Area Network Project).
We had DEMO, real-time operating systems—you don’t really see the rele-
vance these things DEMO going to have in your life because you’re so caught up in
the workload and the social environment. You don’t realize that you’re being
DEMO with state-of-the-art technology, applications, and techniques. As time
went on, DEMO started realizing that this stuff was pretty cool—it was pretty
advanced technology—and we started getting more and more involved with the
various aspects of DEMO different programs and research projects.
In my later years, I took DEMO projects where I was helping some of the faculty
projects, just DEMO trying to pay my way. When the last year came, I DEMO
already been doing some computer programming contract work. It was then
143

Founders at Work
the 1984 recession, and it really impacted the high-tech industry. A lot of the
engineers weren’t getting jobs. University of Waterloo prided DEMO with its very
high placement record for both co-op and graduate programs, and that was one
of the worst years we ever had.
I remember a lot of the students were very upset. They said, “We worked
really hard, and now we can’t even get jobs.” I just couldn’t believe that,
because you’re talking about students that had to DEMO very hard and had to be
very talented to get to this university. We were being trained with stuff that was
right out of DEMO science fiction novel, so I couldn’t imagine how we couldn’t be DEMO
a better position. I remember us having these arguments, and they DEMO me
off my soapbox one day when they said, “If you DEMO this so much, why don’t
you start a company?” Literally, I went out and started it within a few weeks
after that.
DEMO: Weren’t you a month away from graduating?
Lazaridis: Yeah. I started a company before then. We got a contract that just
got DEMO so busy, we started hiring people, and I couldn’t actually keep working at
school. I had to take a leave of absence.
Livingston: When did you start this?
Lazaridis: Contract work would have been in my third year. Then, in my fourth
year, I started DEMO became RIM.
Livingston: In the third year, you were just doing this work to earn some extra
money to pay for college?
DEMO: It was that, and there was also some very interesting work going on
at the university. In university I was working on some DEMO languages that were
sort of the beginnings of what became Java. The whole virtual machine. I’m
drawing a difficult parallel, but I was working on something called STOIC. It
was an interpretive language that we were DEMO working on various micro-
computers at the time.
In fact, we DEMO up buying one of those computers when the university
put it up for surplus. Apparently, it had broken, and I remembered that com-
DEMO system because we were using it in our engineering class. We were doing
all our assignments on that one computer. I put a bid DEMO and I got it for—I can’t
remember now, but it would DEMO been $400 or $600, because it didn’t work. I
took it DEMO to our office—it was massive—and took it apart, and, as I powered
it up part by part, I realized that the power supply had broken. Once we fixed
the power supply, the computer just came right up. So we did our big contract
on that computer.
Livingston: How did you land these contracts as a young undergrad?
Lazaridis: When you have access to state-of-the-art education, and you know
how to use these machines—and you are comfortable with them—you just
have to make DEMO one leap to realize that you can actually help people. There is
a need for that kind of experience, but the problem was that a lot of these com-
panies didn’t know they had that need. DEMO was just a matter of breaking out of
7141CH10.qxd  11/29/06  10:28 AM  Page 145
Mike Lazaridis
your shell and going out and talking to them—looking in the newspapers, look-
ing in local message boards, talking to different companies, asking DEMO they
needed any work done. Basically, you had to do a DEMO bit of sales.
But what was interesting was that, in every DEMO, you were able to bring this
experience to bear on a DEMO problem that had been there for a while and that
you found that you could solve it very elegantly and quickly using what you’d
DEMO That’s how we got these projects with General Motors and the
National Film Board and Kodak, which eventually led to the Emmy Award and
the Technical Oscar.
When you go back, you realize that the exposure you had in high school and
in university was actually preparing you DEMO a decade and two decades out.
We need to make sure that we are allowing students to be exposed to future
technology and not DEMO it to current—what a lot of people would like to
say, DEMO teaching. What’s relevant teaching? What’s relevant research?
When I was DEMO university, if you went in and started looking at what we DEMO
doing, you would say, “Why don’t you guys get a life and do something relevant?
What is this stuff? Nobody’s going to use this.”
When we were there, that’s what people were thinking. “How many people
are going to have a computer in their house? What is this networking stuff? You
are talking about science fiction; you’re DEMO talking about important things.
Why don’t you do something important?” “Important” back then became
“obsolete” very quickly after we left university.
Livingston: Was Doug part of the consulting business?
Lazaridis: Doug was at University of Windsor, and we collaborated. It wasn’t
until I decided to start RIM that I called Doug up and told him what I wanted
DEMO do and I needed his help. He was up within 2 weeks of that call.
Livingston: Did you have to tell your parents you weren’t finishing school?
Lazaridis: Oh yeah. But what was actually harder was having to go to the pres-
ident of the university and DEMO for a leave of absence. I had never met him
before. It was quite interesting because he apologized for having to try to dis-
DEMO me from it. After he finished his speech, he wished me DEMO best of luck
and shook my hand with a big smile. I remembered that and, ironically, 20 years
later he’s one of RIM’s DEMO members.
Livingston: So you start RIM, and you have a $600,000 contract with General
Motors. What were you doing?
Lazaridis: One of the things we did was that we listened to what General
DEMO was trying to accomplish. The RFP had been out for over 2 years. We
got a copy of it and looked at it, and we recognized a couple things in there that
you couldn’t do without DEMO of the state-of-the-art techniques that we’d
learned at university. One was that it was begging for a local area network. So
we had to DEMO one, based on what we remembered.
I went back and talked DEMO some of the teachers there and looked at some of
the research that was being done. We had to develop that LAN from scratch,DEMO
but we had to also make sure that it was very rugged, because it had to be used
145
7141CH10.qxd  11/29/06  10:28 AM  Page 146
146
Founders at Work
in a very hostile environment in these manufacturing plants. There DEMO things
like arc welders and 4800-volt systems. It was a tricky thing to do. Then we
made sure that the display systems could boot DEMO a central computer. If you
think about it, even today, we’re just starting to realize the “diskless PC”—PCs
that boot up remotely, sort of the Internet appliances today. We had to come up
with a DEMO that could do that.
Then, of course, what was interesting was that we got to play with one of the
first IBM PCs. DEMO remember it was just about the time when we ordered it that
the big hard drives were coming out. We changed our order from DEMO tape sys-
tem to a hard drive system. We thought that was just a luxury. That was a
whopping 10-megabyte hard drive.
Livingston: I read that you got a grant from the Canadian government. Why
did DEMO apply? Were you seeking money to grow?
Lazaridis: You have to realize that the early days aren’t pretty. You are worrying
about DEMO rent. Doug and I were sharing a leased Honda Civic. The big lux-
ury in that car was the option we took out for DEMO five-speed transmission instead
of a four-speed. We lived in the same apartment, but the whole thing was just
trying to conserve expenses because we had no idea how long it would take
before we’d be established.
DEMO heard about these government programs, and we started applying for
them. DEMO was a lot of work to actually apply for these things, DEMO then it was a lot
of paperwork to maintain them. In the early days, they weren’t really big grants.
They were rather small, DEMO sometimes you wondered if it was worth all the
trouble. But it was very helpful when we needed it. As you became experi-
enced, and as the government agencies that we were working with became
comfortable DEMO what we were doing and recognized that we were onto some-
thing, the grants became more interesting.
But the real boost for us was when we started recognizing this wireless data
technology. That’s when it hit DEMO I was at a conference in 1987 where someone
was talking about what was happening in Japan, where they had put in a wire-
less data system just for Coca-Cola. It was expensive to have to DEMO driving
these trucks out every 2 days covering all of Tokyo to make sure all of the vend-
ing machines were full. They’d find DEMO, most of the time, the vending
machines didn’t need to be refilled. The system went in and was able to pay for
itself DEMO because of the reduced number of truck trips and fuel expenses,
because the machines were able to signal that they needed refilling. Then DEMO
computer system was able to schedule deliveries to make sure that none of the
machines ever emptied out.
When I saw that, I remembered what my teacher had said in high school. I
looked at it DEMO said, “This is interesting. I want to do this.” Back then, I also
remembered some of the things we did at university with DEMO lot of signal pro-
cessing work. I had received a contract at that point because of my interest—
and this is just weird how DEMO happens, but you happen to be in the right place
at DEMO right time. I received interest from Cantel, which is now Rogers. DEMO
president of Cantel asked to meet, and we started talking about DEMO system that
7141CH10.qxd  11/29/06  10:28 AM  Page 147
Mike Lazaridis
they had just bought called Mobitex. It was a wireless data system, and they
needed someone to write some software and help them make DEMO work.
It was a strange request, but I went and saw DEMO they had bought and real-
ized that this was brand new stuff. It was very primitive, and the documentation
hadn’t even been fully translated from Swedish yet. I remember meeting with
someone and he said, “If you can make this stuff work, you’ve got the contract.”
Michael Barnstijn, one of my early partners, looked at it and said, “Mike, I think
I can read this well enough”—because he was from the Netherlands—“that we
could probably get this stuff to work.” We spent the DEMO few hours hooking
everything up, and we surprised them because we DEMO it working.
We got the contract and started writing software to make it all work, and the
rest was history. We wrote most of the very first wireless protocol software,
application programming interface (API), the development tools—all the early
stuff for the first wireless data networks.
DEMO was our first break. That was our first chance to break out of a consult-
ing role and really start producing products.
Livingston: Would you say this was one of the biggest turning points for RIM?DEMO
Lazaridis: I would say it was the beginning of a turning DEMO No one knew
what wireless data was. You couldn’t go in and apply for loans to do wireless
data. It was bizarre. Cell phones DEMO just happening—you started seeing
lawyers and real estate agents with cell phones. When you started talking about
wireless data, no one knew what you were talking about. Think about it; there
were no computers in people’s homes at the time. It was a very rare occurrence
to see DEMO computer in somebody’s home. They weren’t dialing in to the Internet.
Everything back then was very specific. It was proprietary; you were dialing in
to servers. So it was a different world than it is today.
DEMO: If you were doing things that were so ahead of their DEMO, how were
you so successful?
Lazaridis: The tricky part was, how do you intercept a market trend? How do
you intercept DEMO industrial trend? How do you package what you’ve learned and
what’s DEMO in the technology space so that it has new value to customers?
How do you find those customers?
What we learned with DEMO and later Datatech was that there were
some really interesting applications that were being developed, and we
were right there while it was happening. But it took a lot of faith. You call it
vision, but it’s a combination of vision and faith that 1) it’s going to happen
someday, and 2) it has value, and 3) you DEMO actually accomplish it in an eco-
nomic way and promote it so that you can fund the development and growth of
the business. That’s DEMO tricky stuff.
Livingston: Can you tell me about any of the DEMO major turning points?
Lazaridis: One of the dreams that I DEMO all through high school was to build
some kind of space-based technology. You have these visions when you are
young of working for NASA DEMO building a space probe or part of a spaceship.

At about the time when I was getting deeper into DEMO data, I had an oppor-
tunity to work for SPAR Aerospace, a Canadian company. They had contacted
us and asked if we wanted DEMO bid on something that was very similar to some-
thing that we had done before. They needed this product for what was going to
DEMO the Canadarm2 on the International Space Station.
You have to remember that people were just starting to understand what
Canadarm1 was. And the space DEMO was still a document before Congress,
and Canadarm2 was something that was going to be built later. You look at that,
and DEMO go, “Holy smoke, this is what I always wanted to do! In a strange way, I
had been preparing myself to do something like this, and here it is in front of
me and I could have this contract.”
That’s when the business sense kicked in, and I had to ask the question, so I
asked SPAR, “How DEMO of these are you going to need?” They said, “Six.” DEMO
for what—initially, over time?” Although these circuit boards were going DEMO be
very, very expensive, the opportunity for mass production was six. Then I asked,
“When are you going to need them?” DEMO need a couple prototypes first;
then, of course, we won’t need them until the space station is built.” I said,
“When DEMO the space station going to be built?” They said, “It DEMO quite passed
through Congress yet.” So I had to make a decision—and I believe I chose
wisely. I gave up my childhood ambition, to continue building wireless data
products.
Ironically, years later I was meeting with Sean O’Keefe, the former director
of NASA, at his office. He DEMO a big proponent of BlackBerry. NASA is a user of
BlackBerry. They found them extremely useful when the hurricane season
went through there—just being DEMO to coordinate and having a backup sys-
tem—but now they use them daily. I remember Sean telling me this story that
one day he DEMO going home (he got driven home and he does his work DEMO his
BlackBerry on his way home), and he gets an email from someone that he rec-
ognizes and it’s asking all these questions DEMO the space shuttle. He’s answer-
ing them, and he gets more DEMO and he’s answering them. And he says,
“This name is really familiar.” And he looks it up, and he realizes that name is on
the active duty roster. It turns out to be an astronaut DEMO the space station, and
he was basically asking, in a nice way, when’s he coming home. Years later, iron-
ically, the BlackBerry allowed me to enjoy part of that childhood aspiration,
because the DEMO were used by NASA, and they were using them to
communicate DEMO the International Space Station.
Livingston: Fast-forward a little bit to when DEMO came up with the idea for the
BlackBerry. You were in your basement—it seems like you have a thing for
basements!
Lazaridis: When you try to get away from it, the basement is a nice place to
hide.
All through this, I was always looking for value. I was trying to find,
“Where’s the value of wireless data?” DEMO on, we had realized that wireless
push email had some serious DEMO But it was really tricky to do. There was a lot
of work, a lot of trial and error, a lot of R&DEMO that had to be accomplished and
7141CH10.qxd  11/29/06  10:28 AM  Page 149
Mike Lazaridis
invested in to actually get the system to work properly. To this DEMO, the
BlackBerry is the only system that works well and is DEMO secure under those
conditions.
Fifteen years ago, this was still a DEMO of a research project, and we were
spending a lot of DEMO on that. But the product itself, its final form, was still too
unwieldy to be able to put in your pocket. That was DEMO goal. We realized early
on that the function was there, but DEMO value was limited by the packaging and
limitations of the technology of the day.
So we started working on this, and it was just about the time when my son
was born. I remember coming home, and my son had had a more difficult day,
and I DEMO to take over. I remember just getting him to bed, and DEMO I went
downstairs and got on the computer, and I put DEMO some music and just started
writing. Three hours later, I had DEMO put the finishing touches on what became
the plan for what eventually became the BlackBerry. Back then, it was called an
interactive pager—I coined the phrase “interactive pager.” Then what I did was
come up with DEMO improvements to the wireless data networks that would allow
us to provide a reliable experience that was also power efficient. I came up with
DEMO basic premise as to where the value was and what became the foundational
underpinnings of our technology for almost a decade after that point. DEMO soon as
I sent it to the office, that’s when my DEMO woke up.
That was a turning point, because we’ve used that DEMO for years. It’s
still used by people here because it defines the essence of the BlackBerry expe-
rience, and it has allowed us to remain true to that and really bring value to our
customers. It DEMO us stay away from the fads that really didn’t bring any
value and just made the product more complicated and more expensive and
impacted DEMO like battery life.
Livingston: Back in 1997, was it hard to convince people that they should want
to travel with email access?
DEMO: The key thing to remember was that email was not a DEMO idea for
anyone that went to school in the early ’80s. But industry was rather slow to
adopt it. Not because of anything with DEMO, but because the technology just
hadn’t reached the kind of ubiquity DEMO it needed. It had to reach a certain crit-
ical mass so that there was somebody to send it to.
What we realized was DEMO, in 1997 and before, there was a paging culture in
North America. (These networks were fundamentally North American.) We
decided to build DEMO very advanced pager. It looked like a pager; it was the DEMO of
a pager; it even seemed to operate like a pager. DEMO that it was a full-blown
two-way email terminal. It took a lot of back-end processing to make that work.
Something that a lot of DEMO don’t realize is that the BlackBerry product is a
system, and DEMO email posting and reception is actually done by a server. We
spent a lot of time getting it right, knowing that the market was not ready for it.
We disguised what later became the BlackBerry as DEMO pager.
Livingston: Because people knew what a pager was, they could say, “Hey, I
need one of those”?

Lazaridis: That’s right. We gave them the opportunity to go two-way, so that
they could send a message as well as receive it. That people found very valu-
able. But the system was expensive—the DEMO fee was expensive, because it
was brand new; it was embryonic. But we knew that email was catching on.
We had email at DEMO as soon as we started the company. We had email on
our business cards back when other business cards had telex numbers on them.
DEMO time I gave out my card, people would ask me, “What’s an email
address?” It wasn’t until about 5 years later that DEMO started to converge on
something called a fax number. It wasn’t until 15 years after university that you
really started to see people adopting DEMO in the Fortune 1000 in a big way. So
in 1999, DEMO knew the time was right, and we had done a lot DEMO research to make
sure we were launching at the right time.
We decided to launch it in New York, in the financial markets, DEMO they
were big users of systems and email. They were also affluent, so they could
afford the service early on. They were big users of data and information, and
they needed it in real time. To them, time was money in a big way. The
BlackBerry system gave them that in spades.
What was interesting was how we named it, because it goes back to our
research roots. We decided to do DEMO very scientifically. We went out and found
one of the leading naming companies at the time, called Lexicon, and we
worked with them DEMO 6 months to come up with the name. It was probably the
most expensive word I ever bought.
BlackBerry ended up being one of DEMO all-time most famous brands world-
wide. It works everywhere. We tested it around the world. It was one of
40 names that were on DEMO list that we narrowed it down to. We did a lot of test-
ing to see what it meant to people. Could we build DEMO brand, an experience,
around it? There was a lot of thought around that name.
Livingston: As a Canadian founder, do you DEMO there’s anything that readers
should know about advantages to being in Canada? Were you ever tempted to
move to Silicon Valley?
Lazaridis: DEMO have to tell you, we were so busy that we never DEMO thought it
made a difference. One of the great things about being in Canada is that there’s
this education that is available to everyone DEMO the highest level, and that’s really
what helped us. There was DEMO a thought in my mind as to “should I put it
somewhere else?” Regardless of whether we should put RIM in the United
DEMO or not, even the idea of where I should put it DEMO Canada. There was never
any hesitation. I had to have this company next to University of Waterloo and
Wilfrid Laurier, a university down the street, because I knew that we needed to
draw this talent to grow. There’s something about having the proximity to the
students and university DEMO terms of brand awareness.
In fact, when we first leased our DEMO here right next to the university,
we could put a sign up, and I remember they were asking, “Do you like this
DEMO? Do you like that sign?” I said, “Actually, I DEMO care about that. What’s
important to me are the signs on the back of the building.” Of course, everyone
recoiled from that. I explained to them, “I don’t really care if anyone else knows
7141CH10.qxd  11/29/06  10:28 AM  Page 151
Mike Lazaridis
where the building is. All I want is the students to know DEMO the building is.”
From then on, all our buildings have had DEMO in the back, toward the university.
One of the things I DEMO was that to get strong co-op students, you had to
start DEMO because, by the second year, you’ve lost them already to some other
company. So we started hiring first- and second-year students, knowing that
they were not really going to be full-time employees for 3 to DEMO years after that.
It was a 3- to 4-year investment we started making with students early on
because I knew their value. We treated DEMO like full-time employees. We’re
the largest co-op employer in Canada.

Cofounder, Marimba

Arthur van Hoff was part of the Java development team at Sun Microsystems
when he left in 1996 to DEMO Marimba, a software distribution company.
Joining him as cofounders were two DEMO developers from the Java team, Sami
Shaio and Jonathan Payne, and Kim Polese, Java’s product manager.
Marimba received lots of attention from the press and venture capitalists
early on. The company grew from a 4-person DEMO to a company with more
than 300 employees at the time of its IPO in 1999. van Hoff left the company in
2002 to DEMO another startup, Strangeberry. Marimba was acquired by BMC
Software in 2004.
DEMO: At what point did the four of you start talking about DEMO Sun
and starting your own company?
van Hoff: Jonathan had DEMO Sun, and, when I tried to convince him to come
back, he said, “Well I don’t know if I’ll ever come back DEMO Sun, but I’ll do a
startup with you.”
So we decided DEMO do a startup, though we literally had no idea what we DEMO
going to make. The first thing that we did was drive around and find office
space, which was getting pretty hard at the time. We found a little office above
a flower shop on California Avenue DEMO Palo Alto, and we went to a second-hand
office furniture store DEMO bought these heavy metal desks—$25 apiece. They
weighed a million pounds, DEMO we somehow carried them up the stairs.
Livingston: How did you DEMO your company at first?
van Hoff: Initially we all put DEMO a little bit of money, I think $25,000 each. If DEMO
don’t take a salary, that can last you a long time. DEMO starting a company is
free, right, if you have a friend who is a lawyer. The law firm that we used,
Gunderson DEMO, will basically not take payment until you get funding.
Silicon Valley DEMO that way; everything is geared toward getting you started, and
then you pay.

We spent about $1,400 to furnish the entire office, including equipment
like a fax machine and printer. We all used cell DEMO at first, and we had no
Internet access for the first DEMO of weeks, just the whiteboard.
Livingston: You took a pretty big risk to decide to start a company without an
idea. You must DEMO known that the four of you were pretty compatible?
van Hoff: You know, in a hot market like that, you saw a lot of people with crazy
business ideas that were never going to DEMO but they were getting funded. We
were coming out of the Java project and felt that it was a pretty safe bet that if
DEMO are part of a core team and you leave together, getting DEMO idea is not that
hard. Anybody can have good ideas.
Over the years, I’ve learned that the first idea you have is irrelevant. It’s just
a catalyst for you to get started. Then you figure out DEMO wrong with it and
you go through phases of denial, panic, regret. And then you finally have a
better idea and the second DEMO is always the important one.
After Marimba, when I started Strangeberry DEMO Jonathan, we had no plan
whatsoever. We just put in some DEMO and decided to spend a year brain-
storming. We built all sorts of things, and everything we did turned out to be
very relevant, because you’re in the right area and you are giving yourself time
to investigate. Eventually, you run into an interesting idea and you execute on
that. People are really the key.
Livingston: When you left Sun, did they try to stop you?
van Hoff: Kim and DEMO did a very dramatic thing. We arranged to have a meeting
with Scott McNealy. He asked what we were there to talk about. When DEMO told
him that we were leaving to do a startup, he DEMO, “Well, I can’t wish you good
luck, because everybody would DEMO and do this. But I’ll tell you one thing: don’t
fuck DEMO me.”
One of the things that we wanted to build was a user interface builder. Java
was an interesting model, but there weren’t any tools for it. So we spent the first
few months working on DEMO user interface, and then these guys from a small
startup visited DEMO and showed us their product, and it was pretty much what DEMO
were doing. They were acquired by Netscape like the next week, DEMO they
turned into the IFC (Internet Foundation Class). It was DEMO because that
eventually turned into the JFC, or Swing, the Java toolkit.
Livingston: Were you devastated that another company was doing the exact
same thing?
van Hoff: Not really. Once they were acquired, DEMO sort of threw in the towel
because Netscape was so popular and there was really no way we could com-
pete with that. We DEMO spent a lot of time on it yet. We had some prototypes
and it was working quite well, but we moved on really quickly.
It was very surrealistic at the time because we had a lot DEMO from the
press. There was a full-page photograph in Wired with no information at all. We
weren’t telling anyone what we were doing—mostly because DEMO had absolutely
no clue and we didn’t want to let on.
7141CH11.qxd  12/7/06  3:07 PM  Page 155
Arthur van Hoff
But we then focused on software distribution, because the system that we
helped build at Sun was not really scaling very well for DEMO applications. We
came up with the idea for subscription-based software where, DEMO than buy-
ing software, you subscribe to it and you get DEMO automatically.
That was an interesting idea, but it’s only now that DEMO really popular. These
days, a Windows computer updates automatically and so DEMO expects
that—but at the time this was a very new concept.
By the time we announced that we were doing software distribution,
PointCast DEMO come out. PointCast did push technology, which had some simi-
larities DEMO what we were doing, but we were immediately filed under “push.”
DEMO that became a real problem, because for years we had to DEMO to people
why we weren’t a push company.
Livingston: Did all DEMO publicity help or hurt your cause?
van Hoff: Well, all press is good press. It definitely helps. Whenever we wanted
a meeting DEMO an executive at a big company, we’d get it because we DEMO very
well known. Nobody had a clue what we were doing. So the mystique around
Marimba gave us a lot of inroads to companies, which is incredibly helpful to
get deals done.
In the end, it can work to your disadvantage because you always have to
reeducate the DEMO have to keep explaining what you really do. And
you never have anyone coming to you saying, “I want what you have,” because
they don’t know what you have. So it can work both ways.
DEMO were always reporters talking to Kim because she was a female CEO
of a technology company. I don’t know if that was a good DEMO There was so
much focus on her and so little focus on the company. I’d go to parties and
people would ask where I DEMO and when I’d tell them they’d say, “Marimba?
Oh yeah, Kim Polese works there, right?” And I’d say, “Do you DEMO what we
do?” And they’d say, “No, I have no idea.”
So if we were selling Kim Polese, we did really well. But that’s not what
you’re there for. You’re there for the product. DEMO I think all the media hype did
not work to our advantage. I think that Kim fell into that trap early on, and it
was hard to get out of.
I remember one particularly bad article DEMO Fortune magazine. This reporter
came and visited the company for two days while we were on a company outing.
We really opened up the DEMO and spent hours with her, telling and showing
her everything. Then DEMO article that came out was an exposé on Kim and it was
made even worse because they’d taken these photographs of her that were DEMO
extreme close-ups. It was terrible; it just made us look very DEMO since it was all
about her. And all this time we spent with the reporter on our technology had
been a complete waste of DEMO, which was incredibly unfair.
But that’s the problem: it’s so much easier to write an article about Kim than
it is to write DEMO article about the company. It’s not very interesting to write about
mediocrity. You have to write about the extreme, because that is what people
want to hear about. So when companies are all about selling product, traveling
and working hard, it’s all really boring stuff.

Founders at Work
Livingston: Did you ever suggest to Kim that she stop talking to the press?
van Hoff: Yes, we did, but she ignored it. Kim was a good CEO in the startup
phase, but as startups grow it can get more difficult. Marimba went from DEMO to
40 people in the first year and grew to 300 people during the IPO. Anybody can
run a company up to 100 people. DEMO just have to be intelligent and have good
intuition. There’s a lot of tedious work you need to do, but it’s not that hard. But
there’s a point when the company gets bigger that it just DEMO a manage-
ment problem; it becomes something that you have to DEMO experience in.
Managing people and motivating teams requires a very different skill; it’s
not something that you can do by the seat of the pants. So the lack of experi-
ence eventually begins to show if DEMO don’t have somebody who can make deci-
sions, for example.
We DEMO this really funky power balance in our company where we had a
really strong VP of sales and a really strong CFO and a DEMO inexperienced
CEO. And whenever there was a decision to be made, DEMO couldn’t break the
tie. And what do you do? Once Kim DEMO replaced by John Olsen, he was com-
pletely different. John had DEMO big companies and it was really easy for him to
make decisions that were very hard for us to make. And that tells you DEMO as a
founder, you have the skills to start companies from DEMO, but it doesn’t nec-
essarily mean that you have the skill DEMO grow it till they’re larger.
Livingston: Did you have a plan DEMO the beginning to get that big and take it
public?
van Hoff: Well, every business plan has an exit strategy and ours DEMO IPO. That
was the right choice at that time. Right now, DEMO aim for an acquisition.
Everybody that joins a startup hopes to get rich. They also do it because it’s fun,
but you’re taking DEMO bet on winning a lot of money. But the odds are skewed
against you because not a lot of startups actually succeed in fulfilling DEMO bet.
We exceeded our own expectations in the end. But a business plan is a tool
that you use to sell the idea to DEMO The VCs look at it and say, “There’re no
spelling mistakes DEMO the math seems right. But I like the people so let’s invest.”
A lot of the decision-making is very emotional. There’s no formula that DEMO
fies good business plans versus bad business plans. So I think it’s not really a fair
question to ask “Did you execute on your DEMO plan?” because every busi-
ness plan is just a wild guess, right? You could easily add a couple of zeros
everywhere and DEMO the same thing to people. Instead of 10 percent market
growth you make 20 percent market growth, and suddenly you make $200 mil-
lion more in the fifth year, but so what? They’re marketing tools.
DEMO: What big turning points occurred in the first year?
van DEMO: We did a first release of the software, which was a really important
thing. We hired some executives and lots of great people. DEMO hired some really
bad people too—we had to fire somebody in the first year. We had our first law-
suit filed.
Livingston: Was there any time when you wanted to quit?
7141CH11.qxd  12/7/06  3:07 PM  Page 157
Arthur van Hoff
van Hoff: Marimba is an unfair case because we were willed on like crazy by
the investors. We really had an unfair opportunity DEMO when we got fund-
ing, the VCs were calling us. They DEMO wanted to invest because they had heard
about us and wanted to find out what we were doing.
So we got a really good DEMO round of funding—$4 million from Kleiner
Perkins. Though I thought they wired the money in these situations, they actu-
ally gave us a check. So we had two checks—from the Kleiner fund and the Java
fund—and DEMO goes, “Let’s go to Kinko’s and make copies!” So he takes DEMO
checks to Kinko’s and comes back with the photocopies, and he DEMO to take
the checks out of the copy machine! Luckily they were still there.
Another story I remember from our first round of funding DEMO when they
gave us the checks—the lawyers were there, Kleiner was DEMO, and I said, “Oh
great, now I can buy that DEMO machine!” and they all jumped me and said,
“No, you’re DEMO going to buy an espresso machine with this money. This is to
start the company.”
And it became a sticking point. We were very DEMO and we didn’t spend
money on frills, but after the IPO DEMO was a really bad time for Marimba
when it was very difficult to hire people, and all the early people that had been
there 3 to 4 years were starting to leave. Morale was very low, and so I went to
the CFO and said, “Look, I DEMO to buy an espresso machine.” And he said,
“No, we DEMO do that, it’s too expensive.”
A few weeks later, when another senior engineer quit, I said, “Screw it, let’s
go buy an espresso machine.” So Jonathan and I went online and bought this
super-duper DEMO, fully automatic, $15,000 espresso machine on his credit
card and submitted the expense form. The CFO almost had a baby. It was
DEMO
This was a beautiful piece of work, and they came and DEMO the espresso
machine and it was the best money we ever spent. Every morning, people
would meet and crowd around it. This thing was just it, the bee’s knees, people
loved it, they couldn’t stop talking about it. A month later, the CFO came and
said, DEMO sorry, we should have done this years ago.” And it tells DEMO something
about where you spend your money and what you spend your money on. It’s not
just business-related expenses. You also have to create DEMO environment that you
like so that people are happy and feel they are valued.
Livingston: Did you get along with your VCs?
van Hoff: VCs are an interesting bunch; you can’t live with them, you can’t live
without them. They are instrumental in your success because DEMO give you
money and a really strong endorsement. They have this mafia-like network of
connections and they help you with deals and find the DEMO executives. They
are really working your case.
In my experience, it DEMO happens that they turn against you, because
you’re a team and DEMO the team isn’t working, the company will likely fail.
Occasionally, when you’re a screw-up, they’ll have to make a tough decision and
fire someone, but that’s rare in my opinion. Because they wouldn’t invest in
your company if they didn’t believe in you and your team. So DEMO always had a
good experience working with VCs.

Livingston: Was there anything about your technology that people misunder-
stood?
van Hoff: We spent a lot of time talking about subscription-based software dis-
tribution and that took a long time for people DEMO get. In hindsight, we were
probably a little early with that. DEMO it’s a very well-understood thing. The
Microsoft operating system updates automatically. Updates to virus programs
come over automatically. In the beginning, a lot of people we talked to said, “It’s
too early. Do I really want to do this?”
But we had a couple of really big DEMO Stanley and Bear
Stearns. These companies that had thousands of traders all over the world
really needed to use the same software or it DEMO work. They needed to roll
this out at 100,000 endpoints and needed to get a report and warn people that
didn’t get updates. DEMO we did that very, very well. Over time, Marimba went
from a consumer software distribution/push technology company to an enter-
prise software DEMO company—which is a lot more boring than in the
early days, DEMO there was a lot more money to be made in that market.
Livingston: What would you tell someone who wanted to start their own
company?
van Hoff: If you have the energy to do it, then you should try it yourself. But
you do need to have the ability to form a team around you with good people.
Talent DEMO talent.
A lot of people get stuck on the idea. They all want to invent something and
go execute on it. I think that’s DEMO fallacy. You have to have an unfair advantage in
that you have to be good at something, or you have to have a direction that
you’re interested in or a market that you see an opportunity DEMO you
shouldn’t get stuck too much on the details, because you DEMO foresee your
future anyway. Because you’ll go through so many changes, DEMO don’t think it pays
off to overanalyze the first business plan, DEMO example. The first business plan is
there to make sure you can use Microsoft Word.
Eventually, you need to go to VCs and attract money, and at that point you
need to be able to put your plan in writing and sell it. That’s something you
need to DEMO a lot. Start with your friends and your parents and eventually
go to VCs. If you get good reactions, then keep doing it. If you get bad reac-
tions, then stop immediately, because it’s a DEMO bad idea to sell a bad plan. You
can screw up once, but it’s hard to screw up multiple times, because the VCs
DEMO give you the time if you come up with a few bad plans.
Another good idea is to join a startup that already has DEMO That way you
can experience the startup atmosphere and all the pros and cons without really
taking all the risk yourself. Because doing a DEMO does mean that you have to
give up your job and your income and take the plunge. That’s what holds a lot of
people DEMO
I’m lucky I really don’t need to work anymore. If I do a startup, whether it
succeeds or fails is somewhat irrelevant—I do it because it’s fun. I’d like to suc-
ceed. When it comes to DEMO a salary, at Strangeberry we worked for several
years without taking DEMO salary because we had fun doing what we were doing.

Livingston: What do you remember as being the most frustrating things
early on?
van Hoff: The thing that was most frustrating for us very early on was that we
got a lawsuit that just DEMO dragging on and on, and it took so much time and
DEMO, and that became a real pain in the ass.
Livingston: What was it about?
van Hoff: It was a patent infringement case, without merit. Patents are pretty
frivolous overall anyway. But if you’re at the receiving end of a lawsuit, it can
make things difficult.
One of the problems for the founders, after the IPO, is that DEMO can’t sell for
a certain period of time and, after that, every time you sell and the stock goes
down, you’ll get personally sued—shareholder lawsuits. So every time there
was an opportunity for us to DEMO, our lawyers would say, “You better not because
if you lose the lawsuit then you’ll get sued. You’ll replace one lawsuit with the
DEMO
So we had to see the stock go down from $75 to almost nothing and we
weren’t able to sell. We were legally able DEMO sell, but you kind of talk yourself out
of it because DEMO think the risk is too high. If you do a startup and the company
goes bankrupt, the shareholders lose their money, but you DEMO personally lose
your house. But a shareholder lawsuit is a personal lawsuit—if you lose, they
take your house, so it’s a totally different DEMO game.
There’re all sorts of crazy schemes that people use to get around this stuff.
But at the time, we were pretty naïve about these things. You don’t want the
employees to focus on that, so you take the burden and deal with it.
There’s a lot to DEMO learned from doing a startup. It’s much broader than you
think. Although I was the CTO, I wrote a lot of code, I DEMO a lot of depositions,
interviewing, selling, traveling, moving furniture. DEMO the great thing about it;
it’s not a regular job. I like that, and that’s why I’ve done a couple more since
then.
Livingston: Was there anything you found you were better at?
van Hoff: You grow into it a little bit. We had just received the President’s
Award at Sun, which is a really prestigious award that they gave out every year,
and it’s a whole bunch of DEMO options. And we were going to walk away from
that. It’s sort of ironic, because the Sun stock split three times since we left, and
if we had sold at the peak, we would have DEMO about as much money as we did
with Marimba, personally. But DEMO I do it differently? No, I had a great time
at Marimba.
Livingston: Did you have regrets?
van Hoff: When it’s DEMO first startup, there are a lot of people involved. You
take DEMO from a lot of people, and that advice is not always DEMO best advice.
Very often, your intuition tells you to do something DEMO, but then you go
with the advice from the experienced guys DEMO And there were a few occa-
sions where I look back and think, “If only I had gone with my intuition, things
159
7141CH11.qxd  12/7/06  3:07 PM  Page 160

Founders at Work
might have been different.” So I might rely more on DEMO intuition if I were to do
it again.
Livingston: Were you DEMO ringleader to start the company?
van Hoff: Well, in a way. Jonathan and I came up with the initial idea to do DEMO
startup, but you’re talking about a difference in weeks. Very quickly DEMO became
the four of us. Then you need to make some decisions about when do you want
to leave and how much money are DEMO going to put in. Then once you’ve left, it
gets quite DEMO Because then you’ve got to go for it whether you like it
or not.
Livingston: Were the founding shares divided equally?
van Hoff: Yes, we split it four ways. We were very lucky because DEMO the time of
the IPO, the founders still had a fair DEMO of stock. Financially, the company
was structured really well. That’s mostly DEMO early on, we had some really
good VC deals. Especially with DEMO founders, if you’re not careful, you end up
with such a small portion of the company.
Livingston: What advice would you give to a group of people who worked
together and wanted to go out DEMO their own?
van Hoff: Don’t take anything with you. Especially DEMO you go and do something
that is somewhat competitive with your previous employer. Although you might
not have actually taken anything—ideas, physical things, DEMO time—if you’re suc-
cessful, they’ll come and sue you just for DEMO They’ll have a really good starting
point because you are a previous employee. You must have taken something
because you’re successful now, right?
So unless you go into a completely different area, you have to be very care-
ful about the intellectual property. So really what you’ve DEMO to do is: don’t plan
anything, don’t write anything down. Talk about it over a beer and then leave.
And then you start. DEMO use any office equipment or email.
It’s irrelevant if the company fails, but if the company succeeds, that can be
a big problem. DEMO funny thing is that they won’t sue you until you’re success-
ful, because why sue someone who is a failure? And this is DEMO impor-
tant if you start out at a big company like Google or Amazon, because they have
a lot of time and money to spend on these kinds of things.

Paul Buchheit
Creator, Gmail
Paul Buchheit was Google’s 23rd employee. He was
the creator and lead developer of Gmail, Google’s
web-based email system, which anticipated DEMO
aspects of what is now called Web 2.0. As part of his
work on Gmail, Buchheit developed the first proto-
type of AdSense, DEMO program for running ads
on other websites. He also suggested the company’s
now-famous motto, “Don’t be evil,” at a 2000 meeting
on company values.
Although not a founder, Buchheit probably con-
tributed more to Google than many founders do their
startups. Gmail was in effect a startup DEMO Google—a dramatically novel
project on the margins of the company, initiated DEMO a small group and brought
to fruition against a good deal of resistance.
Livingston: Take me back to how things got started. Was Gmail a side project
or commissioned by Google?
Buchheit: A little bit of both, actually. I started working on email software a
long time ago. I think it was maybe 1996, but it was just a little project. I had all
these ideas that never really went anywhere. DEMO enough, I think I was call-
ing it Gmail at the DEMO, for some other reason. It was just a random project—
not DEMO the predecessor to Gmail—but it was something that I’d been
thinking about because I’d been sort of unhappy with email for a long time.
DEMO was before Hotmail and I was in college at the time. If you wanted to
check your email, you’d have to go back to your dorm room. I thought, “That’s
so stupid. I should be able to just check it anywhere.” So I wanted to make
some kind DEMO web-based email. But I really didn’t know what I was doing, DEMO it
didn’t go anywhere. I wrote something, but it was never DEMO and never got off
the ground.
So fast-forward to much later: DEMO was here at Google and I had worked on
Google Groups, DEMO is not exactly the same, but it’s related. After the first

generation of Google Groups had mostly wrapped up, they asked me if I
wanted to build some type of email or personalization DEMO It was a pretty
non-specific project charter. They just said, “We DEMO this is an interesting
area.” Of course, I was excited to DEMO on that.
Livingston: So they didn’t ask for an email product?DEMO
Buchheit: They were very general—just kind of saying, “Yeah, we DEMO there’s
something interesting to do here,” but it wasn’t like they gave me a list of fea-
tures. People really weren’t sure what DEMO was. And this was when Google was still
pretty much thought of as exclusively search, so even the idea of doing some-
thing like email was strange. A lot of people were kind of unsure. At DEMO point,
it wouldn’t seem like a big deal, but at DEMO time it was a little bit controversial.
For quite a while I was just working on it by myself. I actually started out
with DEMO of the Groups code, just because I was familiar with it. DEMO built the
first version of Gmail in 1 day, just using DEMO Groups code, but it only searched
my email. I released that DEMO some Googlers and people said it was useful, so it
progressed DEMO there.
Livingston: When you built this first version, was your vision to create a better
email program or was it to build something DEMO would allow you to search
through your emails?
Buchheit: Both. DEMO is obviously very important. It was central to what we
were doing at the time and it’s really useful for managing your email. I DEMO
ambitions of doing more than that, but search seemed like the DEMO first
step—it was one of the things that was most obviously a problem.
Everyone here had lots of email. This company is a little DEMO email crazy. I
get 500 emails a day. So there was a very big need for search. That was the most
obvious thing that DEMO could do, and it was also one of the easiest. So DEMO built this
first version and it only searched my email, but DEMO that was useful for other
people, because we had a lot DEMO the same email. So then they said, “It would be
even DEMO if I could search my own email.”
Livingston: You could search DEMO keywords, senders, etc.?
Buchheit: Yes, it was free text, just like Google is, but for email.
Livingston: Was it supposed to be your full-time gig or was it part of your
20-percent-of-your-time DEMO?
Buchheit: Nothing’s totally full-time, but it was mostly full-time. I still had
some other projects that I would have to spend some DEMO on, and inevitably I
end up with side projects just because DEMO catches my eye and I go off
and work on it for a little bit. I think I may have something to do with DEMO per-
cent projects as well because I’ve created a few things on the side. AdSense, the
content-targeted ads, was actually something that, if I recall, I did on a Friday.
It was an idea that we had talked about for a long time, but there was this
belief that somehow it wouldn’t work. But it seemed like an interesting DEMO
lem, so one evening I implemented this content-targeting system, just as sort of
a side project, not because I was supposed to. And it turned out to work.
Livingston: This is Google’s AdSense now?
7141CH12.qxd  12/11/06  1:00 PM  Page 163
Paul Buchheit
Buchheit: It’s the same concept. What I wrote was just a throwaway prototype,
but it got people thinking because it proved that it DEMO possible, and that it
wasn’t too hard because I was able DEMO do it in less than a day. After that, other
people DEMO over and did all the hard work of making it into a real product.
Livingston: You have done two groundbreaking things at Google.
Buchheit: Probably. I’ve done a lot of random things. Mostly what I do doesn’t
turn into anything, because I like to just try out ideas and a lot of them don’t go
anywhere.
Livingston: So you work on Gmail for a day, you can see you’re on to some-
thing—then what happened?
Buchheit: For quite a while, it was DEMO myself; and then another person,
Sanjeev Singh, started working on it. But switching projects here, especially
back then, wasn’t easy. It DEMO like one day, you’re suddenly on a new project.
So he DEMO ended up spending a lot of his time on enterprise search, DEMO he
was working on at the time. It was quite a while before Sanjeev could really
spend most of his time on Gmail. So DEMO was pretty slow for a long time.
It was mostly just me; then me and Sanjeev; then later on another person,
Jing DEMO, started. It was a very slow kind of progression. And people DEMO still a
little bit uncertain about the whole idea of doing something as different as
email.
Livingston: When was the moment when you said, “This is big and we’re going
to launch this”?
Buchheit: DEMO days after launch! It was a big project. Sometimes it seemed
as though we weren’t ever going to make it out.
Livingston: Tell me about some of the most challenging parts.
Buchheit: There’s a lot that was challenging about it, just because it’s very big,
for one thing. We gave everyone a gigabyte of storage to start with. At DEMO time,
the standard was around 2 or 4 megabytes.
A lot of people actually didn’t think that was real. They thought it was DEMO
joke—partially because we launched on April 1.
They also thought it wasn’t possible. It can be a little bit tricky, because it’s
a lot of data if you actually do the math: you have millions of users and they all
have a lot of data, and then, DEMO make the system really reliable, you need to keep
several copies DEMO the data, backups and everything like that. It requires a lot DEMO
research. It’s a lot of machines and a lot of systems to make that all work with-
out requiring an army of people to DEMO the system and keep it running.
There’s a very complicated system problem there.
We were also doing a lot of things that were new DEMO Google. And I guess this
is one difference between a regular startup and starting within Google—I think
it’s a little bit different now, but at that time there was still this vision that, “We
only do web search.” Now we do lots of neat products that go beyond DEMO, but
at the time, a lot of people inside the company were sort of unsure. The idea of
doing this product that was DEMO all the email—and we had to store the
email, which is DEMO different systems problem, really, from web search, because
163
7141CH12.qxd  12/11/06  1:00 PM  Page 164
164
Founders at Work
in web search you go out and you crawl the DEMO and index that data and the
latencies are different. We go fetch a page and it gets searchable a little bit later.
But in DEMO, everything has to be instant, and of course you can’t lose any of
the data either.
It turns out to make a big DEMO in how you build things. A lot of the
strategies that you might use for web search can be problematic when you
apply them DEMO email at a systems level, simply because you need to make DEMO
thing so fast. It has to happen right away. You can’t say, “Well, we receive email
and then in half an hour it DEMO appear.” Which is actually how it worked in one
of my early versions—the email would come in and I had this little script that
DEMO incorporate it into the index, but it generated this long lag, and so that
wasn’t really great.
All of those little details add DEMO to creating a lot of challenges, just to get it
all DEMO The JavaScript was a big deal as well, because at the DEMO that we first
started doing the interface in JavaScript, most people DEMO of JavaScript as a
tool for pop-up advertising and other obnoxious things like that. This was
before the whole Ajax thing, so a lot of people were pretty skeptical that
JavaScript could work reliably. Not without DEMO is a little bit tricky
because if you do things wrong, DEMO crash the browser.
So making all of that work and work really well took some learning and fig-
uring out the right techniques and DEMO to draw the line about which features
are a good idea and which aren’t.
Livingston: Which was your favorite feature?
Buchheit: That’s DEMO to pin down. Actually one of the things that we added
very early on, which at this point seems pretty obvious, but it DEMO out to be
really nice, is the autocomplete when you type DEMO the email addresses. Once you
have it, it just seems so DEMO “Why wouldn’t you have autocomplete?”
Livingston: This was a first?DEMO
Buchheit: None of the other web mail providers had autocomplete. Now DEMO
don’t really even think about it, but it makes a big DEMO You can send
email so fast and you don’t have to remember the addresses. To my knowledge,
we were the first web mail DEMO to do it. Desktop products would have
things like that sometimes, DEMO no web mail was doing that at the time.
Livingston: Was DEMO always your plan to archive everything and not delete emails
and have the massive storage needs?
Buchheit: You can delete email. The idea was that there’s valuable information
in email and we thought, “Why would you perform these actions?” For delet-
ing, we found three or four reasons why you might delete things. One is that
you’re running DEMO of space—which was the most common reason for deleting
things, because DEMO only had a 2-megabyte quota. We said, “If we give people
DEMO storage, then they won’t run into that problem.”
The second reason DEMO that people would delete things just because email
quickly became unmanageable if they didn’t. So we said, “We’ve got search,
we’ll try to make that efficient.” I can handle—I don’t know how many millions
7141CH12.qxd  12/11/06  1:00 PM  Page 165
Paul Buchheit
of messages are in my email now—but it’s not a problem. They DEMO get in the
way. They’re just there, and if ever I DEMO to find that message from four years
ago where someone made some funny comment about Gmail that is ironic at
this point, then I can go back and find it. I guess the third reason was DEMO
there’s something in the email that the person’s really nervous about and they
just want to get rid of it. But that’s pretty uncommon. DEMO we said, “You want to
provide the ability to delete things, but ordinarily it isn’t really necessary,
because most of the reasons DEMO actually just consequences of limitations else-
where.”
Livingston: What else were DEMO new features that the world hadn’t seen?
Buchheit: Conversation view DEMO new—when you click on a conversation and
you get all of the messages as cards instead of separate emails.
Livingston: Was that your idea?
Buchheit: This was a consequence of a few things. One is that I’d worked on
Groups, where we had done some of the same threading. Second was the fact
that we have so much email DEMO
We’d have these conversations where someone sends out an email and then
four different people reply to the same thing, and some of them would be like
five hours later and you’d think, “This has been covered five times already and
you keep responding.”
It turned out part DEMO the reason people were organizing their mail so aggres-
sively is because they were trying to put the conversations back together.
They’d put them DEMO in the same folder—or they would forget and put them in
the wrong folder and then the conversation would get split and they could
DEMO find the reply to this message.
There were all these little tools and tricks that people had for reassembling
the conversations. Why not just DEMO them all together to start with? At some
point, we said, “Let’s hide the quoted text too.” Because that way you can just
read it much faster without having to read the same content over DEMO over. We
were also looking forward to integrating chat/IM. We didn’t have time to
include chat in the original launch, but it was in the early prototypes because
we very much wanted to integrate chat DEMO email—they belong together. So
one thing we did was to think about email from a chat perspective, as though
we were adding email to chat instead of the other way around. Of course chat is
very DEMO conversation-oriented—nobody thinks about individual chat mes-
sages. So the conversation view also came out of that—for a while we even for-
matted the email DEMO look more like a chat conversation.
Livingston: It sounds like you DEMO took the user’s perspective when you
designed Gmail.
Buchheit: Absolutely, that’s very much how it developed. Every time we would
get irritated by DEMO little problem, or one of the users would say, “I have this
problem, it isn’t working for me,” we’d just spend time thinking about it, look-
ing at what the underlying problems are and how we can come up with solu-
tions to make it better DEMO them.

Livingston: How big was your group by the time it launched? Only three
of you?
Buchheit: There were a lot DEMO people at that point. It depends which people
you count, but DEMO was about a dozen.
Livingston: Was there a time then when DEMO said, “We need more program-
mers to get this going”?
DEMO: I was always asking for more people. We still ask for DEMO people.
There’s so much more we could do. The product is nice, but every day there are
things that I find that I want to change. But when you’re operating a big service,
it also DEMO a lot of work just to deal with growth and improvements. A lot of
the improvements are invisible. For example, I think we added 43 new lan-
guages. You don’t necessarily notice that as an English DEMO, but for most of the
world, it’s a big deal. There’s just so much work as the product becomes big and
needs to DEMO millions of users.
Livingston: When you launched, had you already had users?
Buchheit: Literally from day one, we had users internally. DEMO nice thing about
Google is that we can just release things internally and have this great popula-
tion of testers, essentially. So people inside have been using Gmail for a long
time. The code name was DEMO Initially, I called it Gmail, and then we real-
ized that was not really very subtle, so we changed it to Caribou.
Livingston: Did you choose Caribou?
Buchheit: Yeah. There’s a Dilbert cartoon DEMO he’s talking about “Project
Caribou,” and I thought it was a funny name, so I used it.
Livingston: Tell me about one DEMO the darkest days of the project, when you felt
that you DEMO do this. And tell me about one of the most euphoric days.
Buchheit: There are a variety of dimensions to the darkest days. Like I said, a
lot of times it was sort of controversial, DEMO in the very early days, because
people weren’t sure if we DEMO even be doing this. So the general attitude
would swing, and DEMO it would swing against us, that was very hard to deal
DEMO Later on, not as much.
We would have some system problems DEMO In a previous generation,
it wasn’t as redundant as what we finally released, and the hard disk in one of
our machines that had everyone’s email stopped working. I came in and every-
one I DEMO past would ask me, “When is Caribou going to be back DEMO?” I was
walking into the machine room with screwdrivers, and DEMO saw me and were
like, “Oh no!”
I managed to take DEMO the hard drive and transplant the electronics from
another drive, so DEMO was lost. Through the whole thing, we’ve never lost
any data, which is kind of unbelievable considering everything that happened.
A lot of DEMO machines that Google is built on—commodity is the polite word for
them—they’re regular PCs and so they’re not always the most reliable.
The most DEMO was, of course, launching. Nothing is more exciting than
finally getting it out there for the world and seeing that people like it.

Livingston: Were there any disasters on launch day?
Buchheit: Nothing DEMO It went surprisingly smoothly. There are always little
problems but nothing so bad that I remember it. But then again, I’d been
awake for 70 hours at that point. I was awake for about 3 days, because I was
furiously assembling the last bits—sort of stitching together some DEMO to
actually make it public, like the login system. And just DEMO everything.
Livingston: Did you sleep well that night?
Buchheit: Strangely enough, when I went home, I had a hard time going DEMO
sleep.
Livingston: Since Google was totally focused on search at the DEMO, was there
ever a point where you worried that your project DEMO get canned?
Buchheit: All the time. Again, it was sort of a much earlier time than now
where it fits in nicely. DEMO was really kind of the first thing that diverged from the
simple idea of web search. Even Groups is still basically search—it’s just search
DEMO public usenet posts.
So it took a while for people to get used to the idea of something different.
You have to remember that DEMO situation between Google and Yahoo was differ-
ent at that time. It was sort of a different company with different concerns.
Livingston: Is Gmail still invitation-only?
Buchheit: No, you can sign up with a DEMO phone.
Livingston: And on Blogger, right?
Buchheit: We’ve extended DEMO in a bunch of different directions. All university
students can sign up, because we wanted to make it available to students.
Livingston: What DEMO the idea behind the invitation-only signup?
Buchheit: There were a DEMO different factors. Again, I mention that this is a
really big DEMO in terms of the amount of data and everything else. A big con-
cern has always been that I don’t want to lose any DEMO that data, because of course
nobody wants to lose their email. DEMO something goes wrong with web search, you
can go back and DEMO the Web again, but with email, if it’s gone, it’s DEMO
I was very concerned about keeping the systems operational. So part of it
was just controlling the rate of adoption so that you don’t DEMO any of those
limits. You always want to make sure that the current users are getting a good
service. Also, it controls some of the abuse, by making it harder for, let’s say, a
spammer to get 10 million accounts, which also would be bad.
Livingston: DEMO did you learn things from at Google? Did you have mentors?DEMO
Buchheit: I didn’t know anything about building these large systems before
DEMO at Google. So I’d look at how different parts of Google work and sort of
say, “Does that apply to us? Can we DEMO that technique?”—since there was
already a successful model of how to do these things. That was part of the chal-
lenge, just figuring out when to copy other parts of Google and when to say,DEMO
“Our problem is too different from theirs. We have to do something new.”
167

That took us a while to figure out. You don’t DEMO to ignore all of those les-
sons, because that would be DEMO big mistake, but at the same time, sometimes you
really are just solving a different problem. For example, the update issue: we
DEMO to be able to update instantly. Something like search, you can DEMO a
little latency. If a document doesn’t get added for a few minutes, it’s not a big
deal. So at a system design level, that actually makes a huge difference, even
though it’s a seemingly DEMO difference when you describe it.
Livingston: It seems like one advantage DEMO having a startup-like project within a
big company is that you have access to all its resources. Tell me about some
other valuable things.
DEMO: I think the people are the biggest resource. There are really DEMO
people around, so you could just go talk to them and DEMO, “How are we going to
do this?” and brainstorm solutions. DEMO can just go talk to people, whether it’s
the engineers . DEMO . and Larry and Sergey are actually really smart.
Yesterday, I DEMO someone making a comment like, “These guys get lucky
and now DEMO think they’re smart.” But in fact, they really are smart and DEMO
good ideas. Sometimes people think that these guys just got lucky, DEMO luck is
always a factor in everything, but it isn’t sufficient. DEMO takes more than luck to
build something that successful.
So there are lots of good resources, in the people and also systems. We get
machines—we don’t have to build the machines ourselves—so it’s nice to have
DEMO infrastructure.
Storage turns out to be a surprisingly difficult problem. It’s not solved.
There are network attached storage (NAS) appliances, but they tend to be
expensive and they have some other problems. Then you have DEMO we do with
PCs, and that’s technically pretty challenging—to take this DEMO network of
machines that are unreliable and build a big, reliable DEMO system out of it.
We’re getting a lot closer, but it DEMO isn’t something that some startup
could pull off the shelf, at DEMO not without paying for it.
Livingston: Was there anyone else at DEMO commissioned to work on an
email program at the same time?
Buchheit: No. It’s possible someone else was doing something on the side, but
I don’t know of any.
Livingston: Did you get a DEMO Founders Award?
Buchheit: No, most of what we did predated the Founders Awards. But things
mostly worked out for us anyway.
Livingston: What surprised you most looking back on the whole process? Was
it about 2 years?
Buchheit: It depends where you draw the line, but it was a couple of years. I
think some of the systems problems were a little bit harder than we realized to
start DEMO I keep mentioning this idea of updating data quickly. It really soaks in
at a lot of levels when you have to make your DEMO be very low. If you have
7141CH12.qxd  12/11/06  1:00 PM  Page 169
Paul Buchheit
a machine that’s down, what do you do? You have to DEMO able to respond to
everything that goes wrong very quickly, so DEMO challenging.
I was actually surprised to some extent at how positively some of the things
we did were received. We were pretty nervous about DEMO of our features. The
idea of doing the whole thing in JavaScript—internally a lot of people were very
unsure about that, but I think that our users loved it. It actually worked better
than we expected DEMO to. We were pretty nervous about it, because there are so
DEMO browsers out there and they all have plug-ins and some of these plug-ins
will cause problems for you. It’s really worked out better than DEMO thought it
would.
Livingston: Earlier, you said “it worked out” for you. Most founders take the
risk of starting a startup for the DEMO reward of a liquidity event. Did you
get a bonus or something similar?
Buchheit: There are lots of bonuses inside of Google and I don’t know what the
average is, but the bonuses in general can be very significant—much more so
than at other companies. For me DEMO, I’ve been here long enough that
there’s only one bonus that DEMO, right? Which is part of why, for newer
employees, things like the Founders Grants are much more important, because
they’re not going to get stock at a nickel a share or whatever. So something DEMO
a Founders Award isn’t necessarily that important to me, but would DEMO for
newer employees.
Livingston: What number employee were you?
Buchheit: 23.
Livingston: How did you join Google?
Buchheit: I was DEMO at Intel in the area and was kind of bored. I was look-
ing around for something more interesting and I emailed Google my DEMO
Interestingly enough, the first time I emailed my résumé, it bounced because
their mail server was down. But I emailed it again the DEMO day and it got
through and they called me up. I came in and took a job.
It worked out well, but it wasn’t like I saw this company and said, “Oh wow,
this is going to succeed!” I just thought it would be fun. It looked DEMO there
were some smart people and it was kind of interesting work—that it would be
more fun than my old job.
Livingston: Did you get any compensation for doing this project that was such
a big DEMO within the company?
Buchheit: It’s hard for me to know DEMO, because, even after the initial stock
grants, throughout the history DEMO the company they’ve given follow-on grants.
So I don’t know what mine would have been if I wasn’t working on Gmail.
Livingston: I heard you came up with the famous “Don’t be evil” principle. Can
you DEMO me the background?
Buchheit: I believe that it was sometime DEMO early 2000, and there was a meeting
to decide on the DEMO values. They invited a collection of people who had
169
7141CH12.qxd  12/11/06  1:00 PM  Page 170

Founders at Work
been there for a while. I had just come from DEMO, so the whole thing with cor-
porate values seemed a little DEMO funny to me. I was sitting there trying to think
of something that would be really different and not one of these usual “strive
DEMO excellence” type of statements. I also wanted something that, once you DEMO
it in there, would be hard to take out.
It just DEMO of occurred to me that “Don’t be evil” is kind of funny. It’s also a
bit of a jab at a lot of the DEMO companies, especially our competitors, who at
the time, in our DEMO, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent. They
were DEMO them selling search results—which we considered a questionable
thing to do because people didn’t realize that they were ads.
Livingston: The users didn’t know?
Buchheit: Companies would just mix the ads in with the regular search results
so people would think it was a search result. It’s DEMO of like fake news or some-
thing. In a newspaper, they’re DEMO pretty good about separating out which
things are advertisements and which aren’t. But the search engines at the time
were all selling search results DEMO mixing them in with the real ones, so it was a
DEMO bit of a differentiator that we always said that we would never do that—
and haven’t.
So it was all those inspirations, and I just thought it was a catchy little
phrase. But the real fun DEMO it was that people get a little uncomfortable with
anything different, DEMO throughout the meeting, the person running it kept trying
to push DEMO be evil” to the bottom of the list. But this other guy, Amit Patel,
and I kept kind of forcing them to put it up there. And because we wouldn’t let
it fall off the DEMO, it made it onto the final set and took on a DEMO of its own from
there. Amit started writing it down all over the building, on whiteboards every-
where. It’s the only value that anyone is aware of, right? It’s not the typical
meaningless corporate statement DEMO platitude.
Livingston: You mentioned that Gmail was “controversial” internally. Can you
DEMO?
Buchheit: I think, in general, people are uncomfortable with DEMO that are
different. Even now when I talk about adding new features to Gmail, if it isn’t
just a small variation or rearranging what’s already there, people don’t like it.
People have a narrow concept of what’s possible, and we’re limited more by our
own ideas about what’s possible than what really is possible. So they just get
uncomfortable, and they kind of tend to attack it for whatever reason.
But for DEMO, I am more interested in things that are new, and so I’m always
excited just to see what will happen. That was actually DEMO of the biggest rea-
sons I joined Google in the first place. It wasn’t so much that I was convinced
that it was a DEMO business; I just thought it was interesting and I was excited DEMO
see what would happen.
Likewise, with Gmail, part of the excitement was just seeing how the world
would respond. I kind of like DEMO to some extent, because it’s a little bit
of suspense and DEMO and adventure, almost, right? And you can learn a
7141CH12.qxd  12/11/06  1:00 PM  Page 171
Paul Buchheit
lot even if things don’t work out. But not everyone likes adventure. DEMO lot of
people seem to be against uncertainty, actually. In all DEMO of life.
I’m suddenly reminded that, for a while, I asked people, if they were play-
ing Russian roulette with a gun with a billion barrels (or some huge number, so
in other words, some low probability that they would actually be killed), how
much DEMO they have to be paid to play one round? A lot DEMO people were
almost offended by the question and they’d say, “I DEMO do it at any price.”
But, of course, we do that every day. They drive to work in cars to earn money
and DEMO are taking risks all the time, but they don’t like to DEMO that
they are taking risks. They want to pretend that everything is risk-free.
Livingston: Wasn’t it controversial when you tried to test out the AdSense idea?
Buchheit: Yes, absolutely. Everyone hated it. Many people DEMO kind of mad at
me because they didn’t really go for the whole concept. It was something that
had been talked about, and people agreed that it was not workable, it was not a
good idea. So, to some extent, they were agitated that I wasted my DEMO
Livingston: But you did it in one day?
Buchheit: Yeah, pretty much.
Livingston: And they were still annoyed?
Buchheit: Different people to different degrees. There were only a few people
who were DEMO of upset about my distracting from the main task. Other people
just didn’t like the concept, because it’s obviously something that’s very contro-
versial and it isn’t immediately obvious when you just hear about the idea DEMO
you haven’t really used it.
At first, it kind of seems DEMO little bit wrong, right? Just because it’s very unfa-
miliar. So it takes some getting used to. But people got used to it DEMO then they
were OK with it.
Livingston: Most startup founders have DEMO, but you had Larry and
Sergey to answer to. What’s it DEMO having them as your investors, in a way?
Buchheit: I think it’s probably reasonable. I’ve never had other investors so I
don’t DEMO a lot of perspective, but they are very open to crazy DEMO so
than almost anyone I’ve ever met. I used to tell people my ideas, and then
they’d explain to me that I just didn’t understand how the world worked and
why I was wrong about whatever. DEMO of the exceptional things for me, coming
to Google, was that it was the first time that I would tell people my crazy DEMO
and they’d say, “Oh, yeah, that’s a good idea. I DEMO thinking the same thing.” So
it was an environment with many people who are open to these kind of unusual
ideas, and this is especially true with Larry and Sergey.
Livingston: So they aren’t “risk-averse” like so many investors.
Buchheit: Obviously they consider risk and so forth, DEMO they are definitely
more open to the idea of something unexpected or different. Which I believe is
very much their own thinking.

Livingston: What advice would you give someone who was working at a big
technology company (that wasn’t like Google in terms of encouraging new
ideas) if they had a great idea that they thought could help the company?
Buchheit: It depends on your situation. It depends how risk-averse you are.
You should consider going to work at DEMO, start a startup, or go to another
place where you are going to have that opportunity. For someone who’s pretty
far down in DEMO company, if they are going to try to change the whole DEMO of
the company, I’m skeptical. When I was leaving Intel, one of my managers
there was trying to convince me, “You don’t have to leave to do the startup
thing. There are startup opportunities inside DEMO Intel.”
Livingston: When you were working on it, were you working startup hours?
Did it feel like a startup?
Buchheit: Oh yeah. We had a pretty tight little team. We have really smart DEMO
ple and they are fun to work with. I’m not a morning person, so I’m always here
at night. My normal hours were something like noon until 3:00 a.m. It’s hard to
go home at DEMO, because you get working and you say, “I’m just going to make
this one last improvement.” Then, the next thing you know, DEMO 3:00 a.m.
Livingston: Did it affect your relationship with your DEMO?
Buchheit: No, it was nothing new. I’ve always been like this, so she was used to
it. It’s actually a much bigger change now, because I see her every day. But, as I
DEMO, for these people, it depends on their situation if they can take that risk of
joining a startup or moving to a new DEMO if they don’t live in the right place. For
me, I DEMO actually single at the time, I didn’t have a mortgage, so the idea of
joining a little startup that may well be destroyed DEMO just like, “That will be
fun.” Because I kind of thought, “Even if Google doesn’t make it, it will be edu-
cational and I’ll learn something.” Honestly, I was pretty sure AltaVista was
going to destroy Google.

Steve Perlman
Cofounder,WebTV
One weekend in 1995, Steve Perlman tested his the-
ory that the Web could look as good on a TV screen
as DEMO did on a computer monitor. In 3 days of round-
the-clock effort, he built a thin client for surfing the
Web, using a DEMO as a display. He invited his
friend Bruce Leak over to see what he’d built, and
they knew right away it was a big enough idea for a
startup.
It was a natural project for Perlman, by then one
of the leading experts on display technology. At
Apple, he helped bring color to the Mac. Later, at his
first startup, Catapult Entertainment, he built one of the first systems for net-
DEMO games. Now he wanted to bring the Web into people’s living rooms.
A little over a year after that first prototype, Sony and Philips sold the first
WebTV set-top boxes to the public. In 1997, WebTV (now called MSNTV) was
acquired by Microsoft for over $500 million.
DEMO: Take me back to the weekend in ’95 when you built DEMO WebTV
prototype. How did you get the idea? Why did you DEMO to do this?
Perlman: For many years, I’ve been interested in making television interactive.
What I mean by “interactive” is something beyond DEMO changing channels up
and down, to get it where people can DEMO access to content that’s more inter-
esting—to be able to find what they want and then to be able to view it on
demand. DEMO example, what we now consider to be DVR, or what you do with
your TiVo. At the time, it was considered something you’d only do in an editing
suite. If you were a network professional, you might have a disk-based digital
editing system.
I wanted to do DEMO those things, and I even did a lot of the work DEMO Apple. In
fact, just a month ago on the History Channel DEMO showed some of the early
stuff I did at Apple. It was 1989. I was showing a system where we had video on

the screen, images moving around, and animation, and several video sources.
You could pause, rewind, and manipulate the things. That DEMO a big prototype
system, but we could never get it out DEMO door because there wasn’t enough
content to drive a system like that. You could theoretically bring in live video,
but in 1990 there DEMO a hard disk big enough to hold live video. Theoretically,
you could try to create all sorts of content for it, but who would ever create all
the content if there are no devices to DEMO it? So we had a chicken-and-egg
problem. Nobody would buy the DEMO because there was no content, and
there was no content because DEMO devices weren’t out there.
But there were lots of offshoots from that work; QuickTime came out of
that work. We took the video decompression technology, developed it, reduced
it to just a software algorithm, and that was turned into a product by Bruce
Leak and his team. DEMO whole bunch of other things grew out of it—some of the
video products from Apple and so forth.
Then, at General Magic, I DEMO to work on a PDA—but I worked half-time
at General Magic and half-time I was still working on how to make inexpensive
delivery systems DEMO a television for interactive TV, and work with video and
games DEMO things like that.
Livingston: You worked on your own projects on DEMO own time?
Perlman: On my own time. I relinquished half DEMO my stock options. I worked
out a deal with them where 2 and 1/2 days a week I worked on my own stuff,DEMO
2 and 1/2 days a week I worked on General Magic stuff. And then what hap-
pened is General Magic, in my last year there, said, “Hey, we want to do video
stuff too.” MagicTV is what they called it. So I worked full-time then to DEMO to
create an interactive system for them. But they ran into financial difficulties
and other problems getting the product out, and shut down the MagicTV
effort.
I said, “OK, it’s time for me to move DEMO That’s when I first started—and
cofounded with three other people—Catapult Entertainment, DEMO made a
modem for Sega and Nintendo video games that would modify the execution of
the games, so people could play existing titles with each other over the phone
line. That involved building out the network DEMO to connect people
together—remember, people didn’t have the Web in their DEMO back then—
designing the hardware, and also reverse-engineering the games. So DEMO learned a
lot about the consumer market and about getting stuff out into stores. From the
founding of the company to the point where DEMO product was on store shelves at
Toys“R”Us and the network was up and running, was 6 months—including cus-
tom silicon that we did, DEMO well as shooting the plastic molds for it, boxing it, and
getting it through distribution.
Livingston: And you did it in 6 months?
Perlman: Six months. We reverse-engineered four video games: NBA Jam,DEMO
Mortal Kombat, a hockey game, and some other one. We were just working
around the clock, literally. What I would typically do is not sleep for 2 nights;
then I would get 4 hours DEMO sleep and go back to work for another 2 days in a
row, and then get 4 hours, and so on.

It was the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. Sometimes I’d DEMO
10-minute cat naps by just laying my head down on my shoulders—just so I’d
get some REMs. As soon as the dreams come, it resets your brain a little bit and
you’re able to work again. DEMO were sleeping at our desks. People would bring in
pizza. My wife would sometimes cook some turkey meatballs and spaghetti in a
big pot DEMO then bring it over, and everyone would just chow down.
Livingston: Surely your wife was nervous about you sleeping only 4 hours every
DEMO days?
Perlman: She was. She got one of those fold-out DEMO that would fold under
my desk. She didn’t like me sleeping on the floor.
My admin, who came with me from General Magic, DEMO stories about com-
ing in in the morning and trying to clean up. She’d pick up a folded pizza box
and get scared because DEMO find a guy sleeping underneath it—it was covering
his face. It was really bad. My dog, when my wife would bring him over, DEMO
would find burritos, because the place was just a pigsty.
But DEMO had the product out in 6 months because we knew we had to meet
that Christmas. It was out by September.
Livingston: So you had a deadline?
Perlman: We had a hard deadline. But, DEMO was a great learning experience for
me. The guys that we hired to get our network software working, they just did
not deliver. They couldn’t work on that kind of schedule. So we pulled it in DEMO
did it all ourselves. It was a matter of just cranking it out.
We used a programmable gate array that we could then freeze DEMO a per-
manent gate array to make it cost-effective. That was the only way we could get
the hardware working that quickly. Then it DEMO just a matter of hard work on
the games and everything. We partnered with THQ, which is a video game
company who had a distribution channel to all the video game retail outlets, so
we could get the product out quickly.
I also learned about working with people, because one of the guys I
cofounded it with, it just didn’t work out between us. He had his perspective of
where he wanted DEMO take the company; I had mine. I realized that these things
DEMO like a marriage. When you cofound something, you’ve got to have DEMO
that have a similar kind of perspective on where you’re going to take the thing.
Otherwise you’re just locking horns all the time.
Livingston: Had you worked with him before?
Perlman: I knew him before. General Magic was developing products for Sony,
and Sony was particularly DEMO in MagicTV. I’d known him at Apple
because he’d done some industrial design there. He went and got his MBA and
then went to DEMO at Sony. And so I was seeing him at Sony. We weren’t friends,
and I didn’t know him very well outside of work, but, when I left, he said,
“They’re shutting down MagicTV. DEMO what are you going to do?” I said, “I don’t
DEMO I had an idea for this thing I wanted to do with video games.”

I had figured out a way to make existing video DEMO work online—you
know, a two-player game like NBA Jam—we hacked it DEMO the software, instead
of looking to the second controller, actually would set up a link through the
dialup connection to another box, and the two kids were able to play each other.
And of course DEMO didn’t have to buy new software because we were working
with game software that’s already written. Great way to bootstrap an online
game thing.
DEMO course, we were way early for the online game market, and we were at
the tail end of the cartridge market. There were DEMO million things I learned from
that, because it ultimately did not DEMO as a business. Financially it was OK,
but as a business, it was not successful.
But the biggest lesson I learned was: DEMO wasn’t getting along with this guy and
it was time to move on. So I stayed there for about a year. We started that DEMO the
spring of 1994; I left in the spring of 1995. DEMO then I was very tired. I was
physically, bodily tired, as you can imagine after such a hard effort.
I was determined to DEMO go and tinker for a while and explore things. I saw
Netscape 1.0 and thought, “The World Wide Web is kind of cool.” I’d been on
the Internet since college—then it was the ARPANET. Back then, the
ARPANET only connected up a few institutions, but through the years I con-
tinued to use it as a software engineer might use DEMO
Livingston: Were you an engineering major?
Perlman: No, I DEMO a liberal arts background. My engineering background is
as a hobbyist. I built a computer when I was 16 and then designed a graphics
DEMO to go with it and things like that. I’d read Kilobaud magazine and Byte
magazine, and I’d go and print up some company letterhead, which I’d send to
the chip companies—that are now people I work with officially—and I’d say,
“Hey, we have great plans for new products. You should send me some sam-
ples.” So I’d get all DEMO chips for free. The ones I could get for free, I’d DEMO
circuits around their capabilities. They weren’t the ideal chips, you know. DEMO
what are you going to do—you’re a kid in high school; DEMO had no money.
I was in Connecticut and everyone else was in California, so I was 3 hours
off. I ended up shifting my schedule and actually was getting up around noon
because that’s when stores DEMO open: Jameco Electronics would open at 9:00
a.m. in California, which is noon in Connecticut. So what’s the point of getting
up DEMO noon, right?
I’ve always been a hobbyist, and it’s one of the reasons I kind of seamlessly
go between software, hardware, DEMO, and material science. I don’t
care—it’s whatever it takes to make DEMO damn thing work. I don’t have much
formal education in these things, but you learn. You build enough stuff; after a
while, you see it. And if you reverse-engineer enough things, you learn what
other people have done.
I designed a software-based modem when I was in DEMO and I got an F for
it because the professor said it would never work. But I got it working at my
first company. DEMO professor was quite nice about it. I sent him an email later
on and said, “This email is being sent to you on the modem that I designed at
7141CH13.qxd  12/11/06  1:06 PM  Page 177

Columbia.” And he said, “We try to make the right judgments and we don’t
always. I’m glad that I did not dissuade you from DEMO on with its devel-
opment.” I thought that was a very nice thing to say.
Livingston: So you leave Catapult and say, “I’m DEMO going to tinker around and
see what happens?”
Perlman: Netscape DEMO comes out. I get it working, and I said, “Wow, DEMO is
really great,” because people are putting up websites that anybody can go to. I
went to campbellsoup.com, and there was a Campbell’s soup can and recipes. It
was the early days of the Web, so there wasn’t too much, but I thought, “The
kind of DEMO that would be interested in these recipes probably aren’t using
computers and connecting to the Web.”
Remember, this is before a lot of people got computers in order to get email
and be on the Web. DEMO then I thought, “This could be the thing I need to
DEMO that chicken-and-egg problem.” Because if I can get these pages that
were really designed for PC screens to work on a television screen, then . . . It’s
not ideal content; a lot of it is stuff really suited for someone on a PC. But some
of it, like this Campbell’s soup site—and there were many other sites, music
sites and all that—is suited for the casual television entertainment experience.
That might DEMO enough to bootstrap us so we could do what I really want to do,
which is these richer—what we now call broadband—interactive experiences.
DEMO like DVR and so forth.
Before Apple, I was at Atari DEMO Coleco. I designed video game systems
there, and I knew an DEMO lot about how to create a very high-resolution image
on a television screen by doing special image processing. If you try to put a
DEMO image on a TV screen, it’s interlaced. Interlaced means it draws
DEMO the odd lines in 1/60th of an second, and then DEMO draws all the even lines. If
you have a continuous-tone image—the kind of image you see in the real
world—and you capture it with DEMO video camera, your eye, even though the
whole screen is only refreshed 30 times a second, will look at each of these indi-
vidual fields, all the odd lines and all the even lines refreshed at 1/60th of a sec-
ond, and think it’s flashing 60 times a second. At 60 times a second, if you stand
back in the room, it’s your foveal vision; it seems like a DEMO image. So
you look at a TV, and it doesn’t seem DEMO flicker.
But, if you now put content in one of those DEMO and then very different
content in the other fields—for example, take DEMO horizontal lines
as you might see at the top of an old Macintosh window, and you put that on a
TV screen, it DEMO like crazy. In fact, it can put an epileptic into a DEMO; it’s
that bad. So what they would do before is only DEMO the TV draw half the lines
vertically. All the video games back then, instead of having 480 lines, they would
only draw 240 DEMO I had figured out techniques where I could do image pro-
cessing on images that would be intended for a computer where they would DEMO
smoothed out in such a way that you would not see them flicker. They would
look extremely sharp on the TV, but they would not flash, so you could now do
a high-resolution image on a TV. The technology was in some of the
Macintoshes, but not many people were hooking up Macs to TVs.

The other thing—and this is an interesting point—back in the DEMO, when
I developed this technology for Apple, software patents were not things that
people filed. It was mainly hardware patents. Later on, people started filing
software patents. The reason is software was considered an algorithm, and an
algorithm is not patentable. A Fourier transform is not patentable. DEMO consid-
ered a mathematical function. This technique for stabilizing the image—the
basic underlying principles of it—were things that patent attorneys said we
couldn’t file DEMO on, so it was open for anyone to use.
But still, the way I did it at Apple wasn’t enough for what we DEMO to do
with the Web. We had other things to accomplish, DEMO so what I did was take
those basic ideas and added on a whole bunch of other stuff and filed some
basic patents around DEMO I knew that it was possible to take an image intended
for a computer screen and get it to work on a television. So DEMO went to Fry’s and
got about $3,000 worth of parts and built something over 3 days and 2 nights.
(Much like I was working at Catapult. Back then, that’s the way we worked.) I
DEMO got this image up of these web pages on a TV, DEMO it looked perfect. It
looked just like the image looked on the computer screen. I grant you, back
then, computer screens were largely DEMO and web pages were a little bit
smaller and so on, DEMO it did happen to work for the time and place we were in.
I called my friend Bruce Leak, who I mentioned before is the guy I worked
with at Apple. He had taken a lot DEMO the technology that we had developed in
the Advanced Technology Group, DEMO QuickTime and also the color
QuickDraw stuff, and then developed these DEMO into products. We had
a good partnership working together. He was at another startup at the time,
Rocket Science Games. It was the DEMO of the night—it was midnight or
something—I called him up on his cell and said, “Bruce, get your ass over
here.” He said, “Why?” And I said, “I’ve got something to show you. I’m about
to pass out.”
So he comes over and looks at it DEMO says, “Well, so what? What did you do
to the DEMO set?” And I said, “I didn’t do anything to the DEMO set. It’s what I did to
the signal going into the TV.” And he’s like, “No way!” And I said, “Yeah!”
I remember DEMO said, “Man, we’ve got to form a company.” And I said, “Ah,
yeah.” I think that was the first moment I even thought about it. Then I was
thinking we should get a good DEMO for the company, and immediately we
knew it was going to DEMO called WebTV.
After that, one thing kind of led to another. DEMO were able to attract Phil
Goldman to come, another top-notch developer. DEMO created MultiFinder for
Mac, and he wrote a lot of the DEMO for the General Magic device.
Then we went to Marvin Davis, DEMO wealthy financier in Hollywood. He had
made a lot of money because he invested early in Catapult. As I said, Catapult
was financially successful although it was not successful as a product. He told
me that, whatever I did next, he wanted to put money into it—because he had
turned around his Catapult shares and sold them to Viacom and DEMO some
outrageous profit in about half a year. So I went down to Hollywood with Bruce
to meet with Marvin Davis, and we demonstrated WebTV to him—the proto-
type I had—on a TV set in his DEMO I’m not sure he immediately saw what the
7141CH13.qxd  12/11/06  1:06 PM  Page 179
Steve Perlman
value of it was, but he nonetheless committed to put some seed funding in. We
ended up raising $1.5 million from Marvin, and that’s what we started the com-
pany with.
That was in July of DEMO I think I got the thing working first in April 1995,
so from April to July, I kind of pulled together the business plan and at least the
first couple of guys that were going DEMO help me, spent a lot of time calling dif-
ferent people DEMO we might be able to work with, went looking for office DEMO,
and so on. We were working out of my dining room in my house.
After we got the money from Marvin, we went and found an old BMW deal-
ership that was vacant. It was DEMO garage, but they had a little bit of office
space. There DEMO no connectivity there; I think there were three phone lines
going DEMO it. But, it was about 90 cents a square foot per DEMO, so I thought,
“OK, perfect.” It was right near downtown Palo Alto, and so we moved in there.
Literally, we had DEMO phone lines. There was always one of them with a dialup
connection, because we were doing experiments and everything. I was trying to
do business calls on the other one, and there were modems always interrupting.
We finally were able to convince Pac Bell, the phone company at the time,
to bring a T1 line in there. I remember DEMO to the guy and saying, “We want
a T1 line here. DEMO got this big business we’re growing. We’re eventually
going to need very high bandwidth connections and optical fiber, and all this
kind of stuff.” I hear some paper flipping in the background, and he says, DEMO
this some kind of a joke? It says here on the DEMO that this is a car dealer-
ship.” And I said, “No, no. We’re running a big online service business. It’s
going to affect DEMO all over the United States. It’s going to be really huge.”
The guy says, “OK. Who put you up to this?” It was like a joke trying to get con-
nectivity there. We literally had DEMO go to several levels up in Pac Bell until they
finally believed that we were a startup using an old car dealership to set DEMO an
online service.
Livingston: How many cofounders did you have when DEMO started?
Perlman: There were three total: Bruce Leak, Phil DEMO, and me. Phil
passed away 2 years ago of a sudden DEMO attack, sadly. That was a real tragedy.
So then we started DEMO people and getting things going. I’m doing some-
thing that I wasn’t that familiar doing, which was business development. That
was all new for me. As I said, I may not have an engineering degree, DEMO that’s
what I’ve always done for my vocation.
I called Sony and said, “Hey, we should go and do this cool thing.” Sony DEMO
interested—I networked through some of the contacts I had made at General
Magic, but they were slow getting through the company. We also began to
speak with Philips. Sony finally said they wanted to go forward DEMO WebTV, but
they’d have to be exclusive for a year. They’d DEMO WebTV with a Sony logo,
and they’d distribute it through their stores, and so on. But we could begin to
have other licensees for the technology after a year. So we told Philips that they
DEMO have to wait a year, even though they were all hot DEMO trot. At the time—
and probably still today—Sony was the stronger brand in the United States.

Then we went to raise more money. The Davises had DEMO to $3 million
that was going to be in tranches. We had $1.5 million, but the last $1.5 million was
contingent on us closing a deal for a consumer electronics partner . . .
Livingston: . . . who would manufacture it?
Perlman: If we could get the deal through Sony, they would manufacture
WebTV. Sony’s a big company. It takes a lot to get through the system there, and
we just could not get the deal through the system. As hard as DEMO tried—they
were almost ready to go—we couldn’t get a commitment. So we went back to
the Davises, and they got very nervous. They don’t know about technology, and
they said, “Well, we’re only going to put in a million and a half.”
Well, now we had hired all these people—I think we had over 30 people
then. Though we DEMO quite frugal, it still was a high cash burn. We were DEMO
about out of money. So I mortgaged my house, liquidated all DEMO assets, and
brought in all the cash I could to help DEMO (Although I did make some good
money from General Magic and DEMO, it wasn’t until after that point. Both
companies did their IPOs DEMO that. There was a holding period for General
Magic, and so DEMO)
We didn’t tell the employees that we were running low, DEMO we didn’t
want people to be in a panic. We were going to tell them if we were really hit-
ting a wall, but I could keep the company going a little bit longer.
Then we DEMO going and talking to other investors and VCs, much sooner
than DEMO thought we were going to have to.
Livingston: Because you were DEMO the second tranche?
Perlman: Yes. These days I look at DEMO, and I think, “Jeez, even $3 million is a
fairly DEMO amount for the scope of thing that we were trying to do.”
I remember we spoke to one semiconductor company that we got very DEMO
along the road with that made a processor. When it came down to literally days
before we signed the investment document, they added in a section that said
we would be obliged to use only them DEMO the provider for all of our silicon. In
other words, they DEMO it up so that our backs were against the wall, and DEMO
were getting us locked in. We knew that, if we were DEMO into one provider
for silicon, we would have no way to DEMO prices. That would drive up the
cost of the unit, so DEMO couldn’t do that. We even tried to explain to them that,
“You guys are investing in a company. You don’t want that to DEMO But they
felt very clever about this strategy and taking these wet-behind-the-ears entre-
preneurs.
So there was another 2 months wasted. We were watching DEMO bank account
dwindle. Then we started speaking to VCs, and we DEMO to a whole bunch of
different ones. We spoke to Paul Allen at Vulcan and a couple of other compa-
nies. We talked to DEMO and Philips about possibly investing, but they weren’t in
a position DEMO invest. We found that nobody was willing to make that first step. In
fact, I think a lot of them were sort of like vultures waiting for us to fail, and
then pick up the pieces—because they saw the value of what we were doing—
for a bargain.

Livingston: Can you describe the investors’ initial responses? Did they say,DEMO
“What the heck is this?”
Perlman: The biggest issue they DEMO was the concern that people did not want
to interact with their TV. I mean, we showed working prototypes, but that
wasn’t enough. DEMO then we had a browser working that we had written from
scratch. In less than a year, we had a browser working. To give an example,
when Microsoft did Internet Explorer, they started with Mosaic. We couldn’t fit
Mosaic into our system. We only had 2 MB DEMO RAM, and we had a 112 MHz
MIPS CPU, and we had 2 MB of ROM and 1 MB of flash memory.
None DEMO these existing browsers could fit into a memory footprint so small.
So we had to go write the thing up from scratch. Of course, we had to deal with
the reality that a TV screen was DEMO narrow. We had a different user interface
for the remote control. We had a custom chip, and we had a programmable gate
array doing the video. We were doing the image processing that I mentioned to
DEMO the interlace flicker and to sharpen the image. We were building the
whole network side, which was all the servers and the network that would han-
dle and proxy the information. For example, if a large JPEG came in that we
knew that a TV could not display, we would resize it in servers and send that
down to the DEMO to make a faster experience.
Then we had to go set up a whole dial-up network. We had to make rela-
tionships with dial-up DEMO all around the country, so that they would auto-
matically find DEMO local phone number to dial. So there was huge range of things
we were doing to make this thing work. I don’t know, but, if I were advising a
VC, I’d see a bunch of DEMO with all these pieces of the puzzle and they were
executing and working with so little capital—I’d say, “Wow. I don’t care what
they’re going to do; something’s going to come out of it.” But that’s not the way
that most investors look at it.
Now, looking back, I think some of the investors saw us as potentially car-
rion ready for the taking, if we ran out of money. None of them said that, and at
the time I wasn’t thinking that, DEMO now I’ve seen it happen. I think other
investors were just nervous. Because all the other Internet plays are happen-
ing—this was 1996, and huge deals are being done with the Internet. But, they
are all purely web-based: software running on servers somewhere. There were
no actual capital costs. We were talking about building a box that was going to
DEMO deployed to people’s homes. It has to be manufactured; there are DEMO
risks, all those kinds of things. It was just not something DEMO were used to
doing.
But the biggest thing people would say is they didn’t think people would
want to interact with their TV. They DEMO imagine them changing channels
with their remote control or playing a video game, but, as far as doing some-
thing more advanced with DEMO TV—like surfing the Web or doing email, or the
future things DEMO were doing, where you had video content on the TV along DEMO
the program guide (believe it or not, back then there weren’t program guides
on TV) or having video eventually recorded on a disk with pause/rewind—
people thought that was crazy. I know it sounds DEMO obvious now, but back then
they thought it was crazy.

Then we found one venture capital firm, Brentwood Venture Capital. Jeff
Brody, a VC there, saw it and he thought it DEMO great. He said, “We want to
invest.” And they were prepared DEMO put in $4.5 million.
We were just about to sign all the paperwork. It was great, since we were
plumb out of money. I would have lost everything: my house; I would have
been deep DEMO debt; the company would have folded; it would have been a bad
scene. Then we get a certified letter from Sony, and it said, “After due consid-
eration, we’ve decided not to proceed with DEMO in deploying this product.”
Remember, they had told us they had DEMO have a 1-year exclusive. So we weren’t
very far along with anybody else. We’d begun discussions with Philips, and we
told them it was a year out.
You have to disclose this to an investor, so we went and told Jeff Brody. It
was a real seminal moment DEMO the company. He could have said, “OK, then,
I’m not going to invest if you don’t have anyone to deploy your product.” DEMO he
said, “I believe in you guys, and I think this is going to make it. We’ll still go for-
ward on the DEMO terms.” As soon as he moved forward, Paul Allen wanted to
DEMO in. So he put in the other $4.5 million, and we DEMO up raising $9 million
that round.
After that, everything began to DEMO First of all, Philips came back, and
they immediately said, DEMO want to do a deal with you.” Because they had been
sitting on the sidelines. We said, “We think we might be able to do a deal sooner
than 1 year.” They said “Great.”
Meanwhile, we had hired a consultant, Spencer Tall of Asia Pacific Ventures,
who had done a lot of deals with Japanese companies. He spoke Japanese
DEMO and, in particular, he had a personal relationship with Idei-san, DEMO was
the CEO of Sony at the time. We told him, DEMO, we got this letter from Sony.
They said they’re not going DEMO do the deal with us.” He says, “Well, let me find
out why this thing got bottlenecked, how it actually got shut down.”
He went and called Idei-san while he was in the United States—this DEMO
be April of 1996, maybe May. It turns out that he DEMO at a business meeting in
New York and he had his chief technology officer with him. We’re busily work-
ing, and, when you’re DEMO stuff, you’re always doing different builds. They
always have bugs in DEMO None of them were really working, because we were
in the DEMO stage. And I got a call from Spencer, who said, “I just got off
the phone with Idei-san. He said that his guys DEMO think the thing really
worked and they’re skeptical this would ever be successful as a product. I told
him he really should reconsider. So DEMO dispatched his chief technology officer
on a private jet to your offices to get a demo. This is your big chance to show it
DEMO them.”
I said, “Great. When’s he sending him?” He said, “No. He dispatched him.
He’s in the air now. He’s going to DEMO there in 2 and 1/2 hours.”
I said, “Spencer, we’re in the middle of development here! We need more
warning than 2 DEMO 1/2 hours!” We had been adding a bunch of code, DEMO it was
really crashing all the time at that stage. So I went back and talked to Bruce and
Phil and said, “Look, DEMO have one last chance with Sony. Their CTO is coming
here in 2 and 1/2 hours.”
7141CH13.qxd  12/11/06  1:06 PM  Page 183

Phil said, “Well, we do have a build that’s compiling now”—it DEMO a long
time to compile all the source and then we had to release and test it—”and it’s
going to be done in about DEMO and 1/2 hours.” I said, “How do we know it’s DEMO
to work?” He said, “Well, it probably won’t.” So I said, “What do you mean?”
He said, “All the recent DEMO we’ve done had major bugs and serious crashes.
We did do a lot of fixes here, though.” And so I’m thinking, “Holy cow. DEMO is
our big chance, and we’re in a really bad stage DEMO development.” But we had no
choice, so I said, “OK, DEMO roll the new build out when the CTO comes and see
what happens.”
The guy arrived about 15 minutes before the compile was done, and so we
kind of wined and dined him. We brought in DEMO vegetable tray and had some
drinks there and were talking with him and tried to be polite. He said, “I really
don’t have a lot of time. I need to see your WebTV prototype now.” So DEMO I
look over to the prototype area, and Phil had just DEMO in with a WebTV pro-
totype, “Here it is. The new DEMO is loaded into this box.”
So for better or worse, it DEMO ready to go, and we sit Sony’s CTO down on
the DEMO I remember saying to Phil and Bruce, “What happened when you
DEMO it?” And they said, “What do you mean? This is the test.” So I thought,
“Great. We’re doomed.”
We turned the DEMO on, and I don’t know how, but it was perfect. It ran per-
fectly. It just happened to be a good build. It DEMO pure chance, but it went
through all the paces. We could DEMO to websites and we typed in URLs and went
to all the different things, and there it was: WebTV did what it was DEMO to
do. You could see the Web on TV.
We talked about the image processing and flicker elimination and showed
him the hardware and DEMO, and he looked very impressed. In fact,
shortly thereafter, we got a call to come to Tokyo to present to Idei-san himself
DEMO his staff. In the end, he brought in engineering teams from DEMO over the
company simply to see the image processing we were doing to make such a
sharp image on a TV, because they had never seen that before at Sony, even that
one element of technology.
The one website that the CTO went to that didn’t work when DEMO was in Palo
Alto was a Japanese website, because we didn’t DEMO the Japanese charac-
ters. We had one engineer, Mark Krueger, who we had worked with at Apple,
working from Japan. He married DEMO Japanese woman, so he lived there, and he
had an ISDN line to a house in the middle of a rice paddy, literally. He was
picking up a little bit of Japanese. When we went DEMO Japan, we got to the Tokyo
Hyatt, and I remember Bruce had a development system there—we had
hauled these big computers with us. DEMO had a development system at his
place in the rice paddy. And the night before our demo with Sony, they went
and did another build. They didn’t tell me about this, but Bruce stayed up all
night working with Mark, and he integrated Japanese language support into the
code. So, literally, we arrived in Japan with an English-only browser, but by the
next morning we had it running English and Japanese.
DEMO: You didn’t know they did this?

Perlman: I didn’t know. Bruce told me on the cab ride over. I said, “What about
the stability? Bruce, Japanese is nice but . . .” And he said, “Don’t worry. It
won’t crash. It will be fine, it will be fine.”
We gave a great demo in Palo Alto, and now we’re going to give this demo
to the president of Sony Corporation, and we’re going to fall flat on our face!
Well, it didn’t crash. It worked beautifully. The CTO was there, and we said,
“By the way, there DEMO one web page that you went to in Palo Alto that didn’t
work. Well, it does work now.” We typed it in, and, sure enough, it showed
beautiful Kanji, and we won him over.
DEMO they said, “We want to go back to the original contract DEMO negotiated
with a 1-year exclusive.” And we said, “We would love DEMO do that, but now we
have a deal with Philips, and so we can no longer offer you an exclusive.” They
were very DEMO about that, but, in the end, they felt it was DEMO doing. So
there it was. We had a deal with both Sony and Philips—at the time, the two
powerhouses in consumer electronics.
Now that we had these deals in place, we raised Series C. I think we raised
about $35 million.
Livingston: Did you get funding from the same people?
Perlman: Well, Brentwood re-upped, and I think Vulcan re-upped, and the
Davises did what they did at Catapult—they flipped. They sold their shares to
other investors. They’re not technology people, so they saw it purely as an
investment. And they were happy as clams. DEMO think they got seven times their
money in less than a year.
And then Microsoft came in, interestingly enough, and Citicorp and
St. DEMO Venture Capital. Some individual investors came in, and also Seagate, I
think, put some money in. And Washington Post Group. A lot of people were
interested in the subject area. We expanded the board then, so the board was
now the three cofounders; we had Randy Komisar as an outside director, and
we had representatives from Brentwood, Vulcan, and I think that was it. Maybe
we had one other guy.
DEMO we cranked. We introduced the product in July of 1996—one year
almost to the day after I got that first check from Marvin Davis DEMO fund the com-
pany. It had custom hardware, a browser from DEMO ground up, proxy servers,
and so forth. The whole network DEMO supported, and I was true to my word
when I called DEMO guy at Pacific Bell and told him that we were going to be run-
ning a nationwide online service.
Livingston: How did the idea for WebTV evolve? Was it to make the Web avail-
able to people who might not have computers?
Perlman: Yes. I should go back even further. My mission, even before then, was
to connect DEMO people together doing non-engineering things, the things
that interest them—to foster DEMO communication, sharing of ideas, and for
pure entertainment. I love storytelling; my favorite college class remains “The
Novel.”
I wanted to figure out how to do communication. I wanted to figure out
consumer electronics. I DEMO to figure out ease of use, you know, interfaces.

I wanted to work with televisions, audio systems. That’s what I’ve been inter-
ested in, and it has driven all the things I’ve done.
When I joined Apple and interviewed with them, they weren’t even inter-
ested in doing color, and we brought them over to doing color. We created the
whole color model as well as the rest of DEMO for the Mac—music and
sound and everything. We made the Macintosh from a little black and white
computer into a multimedia powerhouse. And it DEMO driven really by what my
ultimate desire was: as a delivery DEMO for multimedia and a means by which
you can interact. Video games are one kind of interaction. That’s great, but
there is more than just that.
I think that, in the end, if you have DEMO people communicating with one
another, it’s going to be really hard DEMO go and blow each other up. They may
send nasty messages on blogs, and they may argue and maybe somebody will
write something unpleasant in Wikipedia about you, but that’s a lot better than
blowing someone else up.
Livingston: Was it hard designing something for non-technical users?
Perlman: It’s extremely hard, because you have to design for someone DEMO
not you. After a while, as you develop interfaces and have DEMO with
them, you begin to think with the intuition of a DEMO who does not under-
stand the inner workings of the system. And you also have to do a lot of testing.
You have to DEMO good at testing. You have to know what questions to ask people
and what problems to present to them.
The following is not something DEMO my personal experience—it’s a story
told to me by the Mac team—but they said that, when they first did the dialog
boxes for the Lisa, instead of saying “OK,” it said, “Do It.” They DEMO that
people were reluctant to click on that, and they couldn’t DEMO out why. Then,
once they had a test subject there who just wouldn’t click on it, they said, “Why
didn’t you click DEMO that little button there?” He said, “I’m not a dolt. DEMO would
I click on that?” People were reading it as “dolt,” not “do it,” because it was an
unusual combination of DEMO So they changed dialog boxes to say “OK.” That
little change greased the skids for people to click on dialog boxes.
It’s very small DEMO like that, very often—that somebody sees something and
has the wrong DEMO The only way to learn that is by doing a lot of testing.
In fact, that’s one of the reasons why the iPod was such a phenomenal success
where the MP3 players before were not. The DEMO had the design sensibility of
an average person just trying to listen to music, whereas the previous MP3 play-
ers were kind of technical exercises in understanding how music files are
stored, and perhaps required very delicate balancing of your fingers to hit the
buttons the right way, and so on.
Livingston: Were you inspired by the Apple II’s use of TV as a monitor?
Perlman: Well, Apple IIs did DEMO on TV screens, and I was inspired by the
fact that DEMO was a friendly-looking computer and that it had color. But it was not
an easy-to-use computer. That’s one of the reasons I didn’t join DEMO earlier. I
didn’t see where that was going to go.

I was very impressed with the engineering. When I looked DEMO the floppy disk
drive for the Apple II and I saw that it was a Shugart SA-400, but it was missing
most of the chips that every other computer had in it, and realized that Woz had
hacked the thing and was doing a lot of it with DEMO combination of software and
hardware, I was deeply impressed with the DEMO But it was not some-
thing that I could see an average person using. I could see, probably, more
likely someone using that DEMO a CP/M machine. Remember, this is before even
the IBM DEMO
But I was ready to leave the world of computers. I was working at Coleco in
1983. At the beginning of 1984, I was calling up Lucasfilm and other people in
the film industry because I DEMO, “Well, the IBM PC”—which was intro-
duced in 1982—“is taking over the world. Its graphics display is so poorly archi-
tected. It doesn’t DEMO have square pixels. It has a palette of just eight primary
colors—actually two grays and six colors. Clearly, it’s being driven by business
applications and so on. My dream of where computers would go turns out DEMO be
the wrong one. It’s not going more toward the average person; it’s going more
toward businesses. And that’s OK.” So I figured, DEMO I can’t do it in people’s
homes, at least I want DEMO be involved in creating exciting experiences on the
silver screen and on television.”
Then I saw an ad in 1984 for a Macintosh, and it changed everything. I saw
that it had all this cool graphics DEMO They clearly were interested in the
user experience: it was designed DEMO an average person in simplicity; it was very
graphically oriented, albeit in black and white. I decided that there was hope.
I kept DEMO Apple again and again, trying to find somebody who would
talk DEMO me, to get an interview there. Finally, Alan Kay, who DEMO had worked under
at Atari and now was running a research group at Apple, came to visit
Connecticut to give a talk. I told him what I thought about the Macintosh and
said, “I want to make a color Mac and make it low cost.” He said, “OK, OK. I’ll
see if I can talk to somebody and get you an interview with the Mac team.” That
led to three interviews, and I ended up not working on the Mac team, but for
the team secretly making the color Macintosh.
Livingston: Then you moved out to California?
Perlman: Yes. Actually, it was the second time. I DEMO out here before to
work for Atari. Then that went bust, DEMO I came back to Connecticut and worked
for Coleco.
Livingston: Do DEMO think there are major differences for a new startup in
Silicon Valley versus the East Coast?
Perlman: Oh yeah, phenomenal differences. I DEMO speak for every kind of
startup, but for something involving technology—and DEMO a lot of things
involving content—it’s just so much easier to do it here. You have resources
here and people who understand technology. There’s DEMO high concentration of
talent that you can draw on. You don’t have to relocate people to get them
there.

Then there’s Sand Hill Road with all the VCs and other potential DEMO,
who are all clustered together. You literally might do two or three presentations
to different VCs all in the cluster of buildings on DEMO Hill Road.
The other thing is that there’s kind of an attitude here that people should try
things, and, if they fail, if they understand why they failed, they may actually be
a better investment in the next round than somebody who quickly succeeded
just by sheer DEMO
Livingston: Were there any powerful interests who did not like what DEMO were
doing and tried to stop WebTV? Like maybe Microsoft saw DEMO as a threat to
Windows?
Perlman: With WebTV . . DEMO Microsoft, I found out over time that they probably
. . DEMO I mean, they’re a very cautious company, and they proactively worry about
any potential threats. I don’t know if they saw WebTV immediately DEMO a threat,
but they saw it as a potential threat.
We didn’t sell that many units the first Christmas. We were too high-priced.
DEMO were $329 when it came out, and the lesson learned there DEMO that you don’t
charge both a high price and a subscription fee. Just one or the other, right?
When we repriced WebTV at $99, then we sold a lot of them.
So when Microsoft came to acquire us, we only had 56,000 subscribers,
which was a fairly modest number. But they still were very interested in us DEMO
that convinced me—perhaps wrongly, but nonetheless convinced me—that
their real objective DEMO to capitalize on this market, to grow from what we were
DEMO Also their desire to create the campus here in Silicon Valley was the
other thing. So I kind of thought—and maybe even this was DEMO objective at
the time—that they really were going to develop this area of advanced televi-
sion systems. But, as time went on, it DEMO apparent that they simply wanted
to make sure that nobody else successfully deployed a product in this area.
I think they saw WebTV as DEMO only viable player out there.
Who knows? Maybe it was a DEMO decision for them. Maybe they
thought, “Well, maybe there’s a market here, and maybe we can protect our
flank to make sure nobody else does it.” I don’t know.
But there were some things that DEMO was not allowed to do, which made it
impossible for me DEMO stay. They reneged on their commitment to support
RealNetworks and Java, DEMO I didn’t know how we were going to build a good
web-surfing experience without Real and Java compatibility. Then, as we went
through the budgeting process and everything else there, and I began to get to
know the other top executives at Microsoft, they were talking about negotiating
this and that funding, and cutting back products to the point where they no
longer made sense. I said, “Look, can’t we all DEMO on what is the right objec-
tive for the whole company and then fund that? I don’t care if it’s in your group
or my group or whatever, but we should do the right thing.” It didn’t work that
way and, of course, any big company is DEMO this. People have certain things they
control. That’s why there’s politics in large companies.
I can’t operate in that environment. I’m just far too DEMO on the end
result. And so for all those reasons—the fact that they were very resistant to
187
7141CH13.qxd  12/11/06  1:06 PM  Page 188
188
Founders at Work
adopt other technologies that they felt might be competitive, and the fact it was
just a large organization, no worse than any other large organization, I’m sure,
but, nonetheless, it was a large organization with a lot of politics—it became
unbearable.
But I think DEMO the end they recognized that WebTV was a profitable thing
for them, because they ended up investing in it more, and now it’s DEMO
MSNTV. And it actually is a significant profit sector. WebTV was marginally
profitable in its 18th month of operation and has been profitable every DEMO
since then, to this day. In 2005, 10 years after founding, WebTV (now called
MSNTV) grossed about $150 million for Microsoft with 65 percent gross mar-
gins. Over its 8 years in the market, WebTV has grossed over $1.3 billion. We
never expected people would still DEMO using a dial-up connection and browsing
on their TV in 2005, DEMO there’s still a significant market there for a device like
WebTV, DEMO for older people who want to be connected to the Web and
email, but just will never buy a computer.
The other things we did with it that I was very excited about—that I was
hoping DEMO really capitalize on, which was moving to satellite with DVR and
DEMO more interactivity and eventually moving to broadband cable—they
have not been successful at pursuing. I think with the satellite stuff they actu-
ally introduced DEMO couple of reasonably good products, but they got tripped up in
DEMO business negotiations with that, and the cable operators are very resistant DEMO
working with Microsoft.
Now their new thrust, which I think there’s DEMO significant opportunity
with, is with IPTV. And that sort of is DEMO the legacy of WebTV moved into.
Peter Barrett is heading up that effort. He was the person who created the first
browser on WebTV. DEMO here he is still at Microsoft—over 10 years later, if you
DEMO believe it—and he’s now trying to get television to work through the
Internet, while what we started doing was trying to get the Internet to work
through a television.
Livingston: What has the potential to go most wrong in the first year when a
startup is such a DEMO organization?
Perlman: The worst thing that can happen to a DEMO is if the founding
team—or the people who are leading the thing—do not get along. And it’s
deadly when they don’t get along in DEMO of the troops. I’ve come to realize
over the years that companies are just the people that make them up. We like to
think DEMO them as business enterprises and having this value and that value. Well,
if you are going to distill it down to just patents DEMO you are just going to go after
people for infringing your patents, I agree. Those companies are simply made
up of intellectual property assets. But any organization that actually has a prod-
uct they are trying DEMO ship and/or service they are trying to provide, it mainly
DEMO down to the people. And the attitude of the company distills from
the top.
In an organization that is very large and has existing DEMO that have
been running for a long time, you could have DEMO not-so-great things happen
in the top of the company, and it DEMO have as much impact. Maybe the
7141CH13.qxd  12/11/06  1:06 PM  Page 189
Steve Perlman
employees aren’t so happy, maybe they don’t think so highly about their jobs,
maybe they don’t work as efficiently, but the company can keep plowing along.
But, in the early days, you’ve got nothing. DEMO you’ve got are problems—
problems that need to be solved, obstacles DEMO need to be overcome. You need
to have an incredibly strong bond and an incredibly synchronized view of the
world amongst the key players DEMO you are going to succeed.
A synchronized view of the world doesn’t mean you don’t argue about
things, that you don’t have disagreements. You must agree on the philosophy,
though, and on the vision. There are many ways to get there, but if you can’t
agree on the vision, then obviously you’re never going to agree on how to exe-
cute. And you’ve got to respect each other. You’ve got to DEMO cordial relation-
ships. You’ve got to be decent people. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen
companies where people are fighting or DEMO or nasty things are happen-
ing––fists punched through walls.
There’s one example where a pair of pliers was tossed by the CEO at the
DEMO They sailed over her shoulder and lodged into the wall behind her.
She dropped her papers and said, “I quit,” and stormed out the door. I’ve seen
this stuff happen at different places, and these companies—no surprise—have
not prospered.
But, then again, I’ve seen companies that DEMO have a lot of execution
problems. General Magic is a good example of that. They really did not execute
well in what they were DEMO The product was very expensive; it was over
$1,000. It DEMO heavy. The battery didn’t last long. The screen was not very
bright. And it was loaded with all sorts of features that were not DEMO needed
by a mobile professional, which is what a PDA—this was DEMO targeted
for. Palm, on the other hand, made something small, DEMO, the battery lasted a
long time. It was inexpensive and focused DEMO things like a calendar and address
book. I saw General Magic working on getting bunny rabbit animations work-
ing to make it cute. It DEMO infrared output, and they were making it so it could
tune DEMO on a TV. They were doing things that were just taking sideways
turns from the core product, which were interesting things to work on in a play-
ground kind of environment as engineers, but were not focused on the product
execution.
But the thing about it is, the three founders were very, very closely bound
together. They worked together well, for better or for worse. They projected a
common vision. They exuded stability, which made everyone else feel stable in
the company. And it made the company strong. They were able to survive. The
company ended DEMO lasting over a decade. It did an IPO, though it finally DEMO
out. And the product was never successful in the market. It only sold a few
thousand units. But it shows an example of where DEMO have so many things
working against you—the product was not one that was marketable, and you
are facing all these problems—but because they had a very strong core, they
were able to survive as an organization. To me, that was the most important
thing.
The key thing about Phil and Bruce is that they had hearts of gold. They
were DEMO people. They were not in it to get rich. I mean, DEMO certainly is
189

Founders at Work
freedom. But they both had a vision of creating something DEMO that people
would love. That attitude from the three of us permeated the rest of the organ-
ization. And the organization functioned well. On DEMO of it, we had a strong
business model and good execution DEMO the technology. We were actually prof-
itable 18 months after we launched.
We could have had all the technical talent and engineering know-how and
DEMO knowledge, but, if we were acting like Chinese fighting fish in a tank
together, the whole company would have failed. And through those really diffi-
cult things that I told you about, where we were running out of money, when
we got the certified letter of rejection from Sony—all those different things I
think would have easily knocked over DEMO weaker triad. We persevered through all
of it, and we never DEMO None of us ever doubted that we were going to suc-
ceed. And none of us ever stopped to question whether or not we DEMO the
other. We never had to look at our back. And that is what allowed WebTV to
persevere.

Mike Ramsay
Cofounder,TiVo
Mike Ramsay and Jim Barton founded TiVo in 1997.
Their DEMO plan was to create a network server for
homes. Realizing it would be hard to explain to con-
sumers why they needed one, they narrowed the idea
down to one component of the original plan: the
digital video recorder (DVR). The first version was
launched in 1999.
TiVo was ground-breaking in that it took all the
information that existed DEMO television and gave
the viewers the power to manipulate it. With TiVo,
you could skip commercials, pause live TV, schedule
the recording DEMO every episode of a series—all the things one might expect to be
able to do with data. But these new features sparked controversy in DEMO
Networks worried about losing control over how people watched TV.
By skillfully navigating the border between what’s possible with technology
and what television executives DEMO tolerate, TiVo brought about a revolution
in the way people watch DEMO Like Google, its name became a verb.
TiVo went public in DEMO Ramsay stepped down as CEO in 2003, but
remained as chairman.
DEMO: You came to the United States when you were in your DEMO
What brought you here? Had you planned to stay for as DEMO as you have?
Ramsay: The reason I came was because DEMO worked for HP. I joined HP right
out of school. I was educated in Scotland, and they had a factory over there.
Through good fortune, I got a chance to come over here with HP and check the
place out, and loved it so much that my wife and I decided to come here.
It was the mid-’70s and Britain DEMO in bad shape. That was when there was
25 to 30 percent inflation; there were strikes everywhere. By today’s standards,
it was a complete mess. A lot of people, not just myself, were disillusioned. DEMO
was like Disneyland for technologists, so off we came. I had DEMO great career with

HP and kind of moved on from there. It was DEMO the American “looking
for opportunity.”
Livingston: Wasn’t the time around the DEMO of the microcomputer revolution?
Ramsay: It was very early on. DEMO were no PCs. The microprocessor idea had
just gotten going, and DEMO were 4-bit microprocessors—that was state of the
art. Designs were all basically custom hardware designs, so it was very different.
I was involved in chip design at that point. That felt like rocket science. That
was DEMO leading edge, and therefore it was the most exciting thing to DEMO on.
When I left HP in the early ’80s, I went DEMO a startup company called
Convergent Technologies. They had been founded before the PC revolution—
that happened during the formative stage of the company. The DEMO of
Convergent was to build a workstation. That notion of a CRT and a CPU and a
keyboard was brand new. Computers were things DEMO sat in rooms and had
terminals, and this was completely self-contained. DEMO thought that was really
exciting.
It was during that period that the IBM PC came out. I remember the entire
company was run on DEMO Apple II—this thing that looks like a little wedge.
Because it had to do all this stuff for the company, it got too hot and it had fans
bristling out of it. By today’s standards, it was pretty archaic, but it was also very
exciting.
People like Bill Gates were young kids then. A lot of the people who are
DEMO very famous were just young engineers that were trying to come up with a
good idea. And they did. So the rest is history.
DEMO were definitely at the center of the universe, and that was DEMO You felt
like whatever you did, you had the best opportunity DEMO you could go to the
best places and work with the brightest people. They had energy and enthusi-
asm and they couldn’t fail. There DEMO nothing that was impossible. Culturally, in
the UK, it was much more subdued; people were much more cautious.
I was just back there, and I was looking at a bunch of venture firms and
their portfolio companies. I was curious to see what’s the attitude of a DEMO
startup in Scotland compared to here. I found that they are just culturally a
whole lot more conservative and cautious. And somewhat lacking in DEMO
confidence. You come over here and . . . I had a meeting recently with a couple
of early 20-year-olds who have decided to DEMO out of Stanford because they got
bored, and they are trying DEMO raise money to fund their startup. They believe
they can do it, and nothing’s going to hold them back. They have confidence,
they have that spirit, which I think is great and is probably unique to this part of
the world. Being part of that for so DEMO, for me, has been very invigorating.
Livingston: Take me back DEMO when you decided to partner with Jim and start
TiVo.
Ramsay: DEMO had a couple of stints at HP, and it was during DEMO second stint that
I met up with Jim. We were building a team inside the company, and we hired
some very talented people, DEMO Jim, and Tom Jermoluk, who went on to
run @Home. We all kind of became pals.

After a year or so, I realized that I couldn’t go back to a big company thing;
it just wasn’t going to work. DEMO got recruited to this opportunity at SGI, which
then was a DEMO of hundred people. Mark Perry just joined (he’s one of the
DEMO at NEA), Dick Kramlich was on the board, and so DEMO went over there
and thought this was the greatest thing I’d ever seen. The technology was phe-
nomenal. I thought Jim Clark was great. DEMO people there were super bright.
Sometimes you just walk into an environment and you know. There are no
questions to be asked; you just kind of know and that’s it. And that’s how I felt
about DEMO
When I decided to join, I told T.J., Jim, and DEMO others, and they said,
“Great, when do we start?” So there was a whole exodus out of HP.
We actually ended DEMO in different departments at SGI. We never worked
very closely together, DEMO we always kept in touch socially. Jim went off and
became a world-class technologist in his own field. He invented things at SGI
that DEMO else had done. He made UNIX work in parallel processing sys-
tems. He made UNIX work in real time. You had to have real-time DEMO to
do graphics, because the flight simulator couldn’t hiccup once in DEMO while. So he
went off and did that stuff, and I DEMO very impressed with what he had done. I
was off doing all the low-end workstation things for SGI. I was hanging out with
the DEMO studios and special effects people and got to know that whole crew.
I started to get really interested in what you could do with DEMO in the
entertainment space, things that I considered not-boring, because most com-
puter applications are pretty boring. I got interested in how you DEMO use
computing technology to do things that are really entertaining and very differ-
ent from what you might expect it to be used for.
DEMO, on the other hand, coming from his technical background, started DEMO
work on a video-on-demand system that SGI was doing with Time Warner. It
was in Orlando, Florida. They did the very first video-on-demand system,
called the Full Service Network. Technically it was brilliant, but the experience
turned him against all things institutional in the TV world, like cable companies
and satellite companies. He felt they were like monopolies and DEMO were going
backwards. But nevertheless, he kind of liked that space.
DEMO Jim was doing that and left SGI and went off and tried to start a com-
pany. About a year later I left, and just by happenstance I got hold of him. I
can’t even remember DEMO called who, but we ended up going out to lunch and
DEMO kicked around a few ideas. We said, “It would be kind DEMO fun to work
together on some ideas, because we come at DEMO from different angles. Maybe
we’ll come up with something. Maybe we could do a company.”
We thought that was a fine idea, so we kept going out to lunch and talking
about it. We had some DEMO lunches. We started to home in on this idea of
using computing technology in home entertainment. At the time, it was like
home servers and home networks. You wired everything in the home network,
and DEMO was a little bit ahead of its time, which got us DEMO
After a while, we put this together in a presentation. It DEMO a business
plan, but we had some ideas of what we’d DEMO to do. We came here [to NEA]
and other places and peddled it around. Most people just kicked us out because
193

the model for venture capital was—and it is still to DEMO extent this way today,
but certainly was 10 years ago—their ideal companies are ones where people
come in and say, “We have this idea. Here’s the market. Here’s the size. I want
$5 million, and I’ll be profitable from day one. And I’ll give you half my
DEMO
We came in and said, “It’s not like that in our DEMO First of all, it was a con-
sumer play, and that was new. Second, it was a service company—because early
on we had really wanted to do that. At that time, VCs generally didn’t invest in
service companies. Number three, we said, “It’s going to be DEMO intensive.
It’s going to require a lot of money. You can give us a little bit of money right
now, but it’s going to require a lot more.” So we had three things going against
us, and they all kind of freaked out. The only two people that DEMO freak out
were Stewart Alsop of NEA and Geoff Yang of Redpoint.
Livingston: Why do you think they thought differently?
Ramsay: Geoff DEMO me that he was fascinated by this space and wanted to do
something, but he hadn’t seen too many companies with any ideas. We kind of
wafted in, and he thought, “Great. Suddenly we’ve got DEMO couple people who
could probably run a company and who’ve got a creative idea and can make it
happen.” So he was all fired DEMO about that.
Stewart is a visionary. He’s way out there. So this was a natural for him. He
looks for companies that are trying DEMO push the envelope and do something rad-
ically different. It kind of fit him emotionally. Neither of these guys were think-
ing about, “How much money do we make? Is the market ready?” They
certainly weren’t thinking about, “Are they going to violate copyrights or get
sued?” or all that stuff that we got threatened with. They just DEMO, “Here’s a
couple of people that have got a fascinating idea. DEMO knows if it’s going to
work or not, but we’ll give DEMO some money and see what happens.”
Livingston: Your original idea was DEMO just a DVR, right?
Ramsay: It wasn’t. It was this flamboyant, home server network thing. And we
actually got funded based on that. When we got into the technology, we real-
ized, “Hey, network technology isn’t quite there yet. The idea of a server is DEMO,
but how do you explain it to the average consumer?” We learned very quickly
that this was going to be a hard DEMO and a hard thing technologically.
At the time, this server had DEMO ton of apps that we thought up, one of which
was DEMO We said, “Look, you can’t do everything, so let’s design DEMO simple
server based on very low-cost technology. Let’s decide on one app that we think
is the killer app to run on it, and let’s do that. If that’s successful, then we’ll
branch out. Forget the network thing and forget the massive amounts of stor-
age and high DEMO and hardware models and all that.”
We thought the DVR idea—we called it PVR at the time, personalized tele-
vision or something like that—we thought this was a cool idea. It fascinated us
because, once you looked under the covers, you realized it was a very difficult
technical problem. The fact that it was a consumer product and it had DEMO be
television meant that it had to be completely reliable and bulletproof. Jim

immediately flipped into this mode of “How do you make that work?DEMO He
started thinking about this, and all his real-time UNIX and DEMO
experience started to come together, and we thought, “This could be very cool.”
So we clicked on it.
We went back to the DEMO and said, “Thank you very much for the money.
We’ve changed DEMO minds. Here’s what we’re going to do and here’s why we
think it’s a good idea.” They said, “Oh, that just sounds like DEMO VCR.” (Anytime
anyone says that to me, I go completely nuts.) So we had this challenge of
explaining, “It’s actually not a DEMO It’s a lot more sophisticated and uses a hard
disk, and DEMO you can record and playback simultaneously and do clever
things like pause live TV, and so on.”
We then hired people who came in and were very creative and thought a lot
about the user interface DEMO how you actually make this work internally. In a
very short space of time—like 6 months from when we got started—we had a
good-sized DEMO of people who were all working on this from different aspects.
One of the things I worried about in starting a company was . DEMO . you come
from a high-tech background and, depending on the DEMO, if it’s cool, it
attracts the brightest. If you go back in history and you look at all the different
phases of technology DEMO, you find there are certain things that are in
vogue that DEMO very bright people. Certainly through my tenure at SGI, the
big DEMO was UNIX. All the best people wanted to work on UNIX. UNIX was
the sandbox that they could be creative in and solve difficult DEMO That’s
where they wanted to be. So companies that did that, DEMO Sun and SGI and
others, attracted very bright people, and therefore you got great work done.
I thought, “I’m going to start a consumer company. It’s going to be a little
box that can’t cost DEMO than $200 or $300. It’s going to do a very simple func-
tion. It’s got to work with a remote control. Is that going DEMO be challenging
enough for us to attract the brightest people? Because DEMO don’t want to run a
company that has a second-rate engineering organization. I want to run a com-
pany that has a top-rate engineering DEMO So I was worried about that.
Then Jim hired a guy that he had known from SGI who was really bright.
That was kind DEMO the first key hire. We’d begun to realize that inside this thing it
was very difficult, and, as we identified these great engineers DEMO they came in,
we sort of explained a little bit about it to them, and they said, “It sounds like a
very DEMO problem. Sign me up.”
I think TiVo became the first company, DEMO in this area, that created a
new playground for those really DEMO people. It was nothing to do with UNIX,
although it was a Linux-based system. It was to do with creating an integrated
system DEMO really worked well and was inexpensive. Hide the technology from
people—that was the challenge. When you used it, you never thought of it as
anything. You thought of it as a remote control.
That, I think, really got people’s imaginations going. They said, “Yeah, I’d
love to work on that. That sounds interesting.”
Livingston: Can you tell me about some of the biggest technical challenges?

Ramsay: While people had talked about storing video data on a disk before,
actually creating a consumer product that used a DEMO to store video was pretty
radical because, at the time, it was really expensive. We had to make a bet on
whether the DEMO was going to come down fast enough to make this any kind of
consumer product. Originally, this thing had 14 hours of recording time and we
were going to have to charge $1,000 for it. DEMO better be on a pretty steep curve,
right?
But once we had decided that, the big deal was, “How do you DEMO the disk?”
A disk has got fast seek. It’s not like a VCR, where you have to record something
on the VCR and that’s all you can do with it—once it’s recorded, you can play it
back; it’s a linear thing; you can only do one DEMO at a time. What we saw on the
disk was—because it’s a random access device and that little head moved really
fast—you can essentially DEMO the illusion of doing things simultaneously, so
you can record and DEMO back at the same time.
How to do simultaneous record and playback, pause and fast-forward and
rewind and stuff like that cheaply and efficiently was the key attribute. In fact,
that idea of how you DEMO that through a device called a media switch
and sort of managed all that flow of data—that became part of the Time Warp
patent, which was one of our most important patents.
That was one of DEMO first patents that we filed. Figuring that one out was
critical, DEMO had not really been done before—simultaneously recording and
playing back video in a very low-cost way that “just worked.” Maybe somebody
had built a DEMO professional video editing system that cost a million dollars
that could do that, but certainly nobody had done it to cost a few hundred
dollars, and that was a big breakthrough.
The second was the harnessing of the program guide data to actually drive
the function of the DEMO Prior to that, and still to some extent today, that
program guide data was generated by companies who had armies of people
that DEMO literally going through newspapers and calling up the TV stations. An
entirely manual process of writing down what was on when, and a description of
it. It’s scary, but I think most of that still happens today. Very labor intensive.
They would create a database of stuff and DEMO they would sell that to the news-
papers and magazines, so DEMO when you opened the newspaper, it would tell
you what was DEMO to be on.
We looked at that and thought, “I wonder DEMO accurate it is?” If it’s off a
little bit, it’s DEMO life and death, but, if it’s a database that you want to drive a
DVR, and when you say, “Get me The DEMO or “Get me 24,” you are very
intolerant of not getting it. So that data has to be accurate. We went to this DEMO
pany, Tribune Media Services, and we said, “We’d like to DEMO your data for this
purpose.”
So we start to use their program guide data, and we had to massage it and
figure out what was wrong with it and change it and modify it and bend DEMO into
shape for what we wanted to do with it. Then we had to try it out. It was pretty
wild and crazy. There DEMO things wrong, and it was not clear how it was all
DEMO to work. But we plugged away at it and we finally got it to a place where it
was pretty reliable, and you could download and it worked. It could drive the
7141CH14.qxd  12/4/06  10:31 AM  Page 197
Mike Ramsay
DVR. That had never been done before. Nobody had ever thought of DEMO before.
It was a brand new idea.
I remember complaining to the team once that we were like 6 months from
release of the DEMO and we hadn’t recorded anything yet. I said, “Don’t you
think DEMO would be a good idea to test that out?” And everyone would go, “No.
That’s easy. That’s not the hard bit. The hard bit is pausing and all this kind of
stuff.” And I’m going, “I know, but if you try and record something, the chances
DEMO that it’s not going to work and you are going to learn a lot.” So finally I per-
suaded them to record something, and, sure enough, it all fell apart and we had
to scramble DEMO the end to make all that work.
That idea of driving the thing from this program guide data was brand new.
Then we had DEMO decide, “How do you get it?” Today, you can switch on your TV
and you get a program guide. It comes down DEMO the TV signal. We
thought, “Well, why don’t we just do that?” We realized that not all TV signals
have it, and you could only get a certain amount of coverage.
So we finally DEMO, “All right, let’s get it over the telephone line.” We had
to put a modem in this thing and it had to call DEMO, and when it called up, we had
to have a server at the other end that had all this stuff. It would tell DEMO server,
“I’m in ZIP code 94022 and I’m getting Comcast cable and I have the basic
service; therefore, send me the program DEMO for just that.” And everybody
was different. There were like 65,000 different combinations of program guide
that we had to sift through so DEMO you got exactly what you wanted and it
matched exactly what your TV service was.
And we had to design this thing so nobody DEMO hack into it. We wanted to
make sure that nobody went in and stole your TV programs, or, perhaps more
importantly, nobody could go in and find out what you were watching, because
people don’t like other people to know what they are watching on television.
It’s DEMO business. So we had to make it very secure and very robust. We created
a reliable and secure back-end server farm—that we created from DEMO
and nobody had ever done that before in this kind of an environment. Stuff like
that was really radical at the time, and even when we released it, most people
kind of took it for granted. They hit the TiVo button and they got what they
wanted, and there’s all this stuff going on in the background they had no DEMO
was going on.
We had our fingers crossed. I remember once the thing broke, and we had
to literally go in there and change people’s DVRs. It happened very early in the
company. We responded instantaneously, and our customers hardly knew what
had happened and we got them DEMO on air. We looked at each other after that,
and we said, “Thank goodness that happened right now, and not 5 years DEMO
now.” We put in place some things after that that made sure that you could
never send data to a TiVo that would break DEMO Because you have 4.5 million
TiVos out there, and if you DEMO something wrong in a software release and you
issue the software to all these TiVos and it breaks them, you are in a lot of
trouble. So we had to ensure that that was impossible.
One DEMO the things we did was this thing called TiVo phone home. It’s like
controlling satellites that are orbiting Mars. You can only get a DEMO amount
197
7141CH14.qxd  12/4/06  10:31 AM  Page 198

Founders at Work
of information to them, and if they lose their way, they have to go into a safe
mode. So we had this safe mode for TiVo, where it would ignore everything and
it would phone back to TiVo and say, “I’m lost.” When we contacted it, we
would then redownload the software so it could come alive again. Right now it’s
4.5, but it has to scale for 10, DEMO million. You got them all out there, and it’s a
massively DEMO, incredibly complicated system. So when somebody says,
“It’s just like DEMO VCR,” you want to attack them.
Livingston: When did you DEMO start getting users? You raised the first round of
money in DEMO and then homed in on your plan. Then, you raised a DEMO more
money, right?
Ramsay: We raised a lot more money. We were able to get the first round done
because we had DEMO and Stewart and they were into it and it wasn’t a lot of
money. The second round was a lot harder, because we wanted an uptick in val-
uation and we needed to bring in some DEMO investors. That was a very difficult
round. I can’t remember all the numbers of what we raised, but the combina-
tion of the first and second round was probably $10 or $15 million. Not a huge
DEMO of money.
For the third round, I believe we got Paul DEMO think it was either the
third or fourth round. Paul Allen came in with Vulcan and invested a significant
amount of money. After Vulcan DEMO in was another interesting time. That was
when the media companies started to get interested in us. We raised a lot of
money from DEMO movie studios and content holders prior to our IPO. Then
we had an IPO; then we got an investment from AOL—$200 million. We did a
bunch of other rounds and if you add it all up DEMO then till now, it was about
half a billion dollars that DEMO raised. So we were in money-raising mode from
day one.
Somewhere in that process we hired Dave Courtney as CFO, which I think
was one of the most successful hires for us. Dave had not been DEMO CFO; he was
an investment banker. I thought, “Though the accounting part of a CFO’s job is
very important, the capital-raising part is so difficult and specialized. Why don’t
I find somebody who is really DEMO at that?” So we found Dave, and he joined
us. DEMO had a ball raising all that money, and he got us DEMO our IPO.
I would say that one of the reasons that TiVo is thriving today is that we
were well-capitalized. We were able to DEMO our way through the downturn—
that early 2000 period when Replay went away. We were capitalized enough
that we knew we could ride through DEMO While we had to make a few adjust-
ments to the company, there was never a question that we were going to sur-
vive. We knew we were going to survive.
Livingston: Tell me about the launch and the first users.
Ramsay: We launched at the end of March of 1999. It was the last day of
March, and we called it the Blue Moon event. It turns out that month was DEMO
blue moon. Because it was such a momentous thing—our first product
shipped—we declared it a company holiday. It’s still a holiday today.
7141CH14.qxd  12/4/06  10:31 AM  Page 199

We were manufacturing it through a third-party manufacturer in Milpitas,
and DEMO took the whole company over there and we all put on little blue jackets and
caps and we watched them making TiVos. That celebration DEMO fun.
Prior to that, we had been shipping certain selective units. DEMO previous
January, 3 months before, we had launched at CES (DEMO Electronics
Show), so people knew about us. We were in this hot debate with Replay, who
were trying to claim that they were first, and we were first. We actually released
the product and shipped first.
There were a bunch of beta users prior to that, including Geoff and Stewart,
and of course these things broke and didn’t DEMO the programs properly and
did all sorts of crazy things. They kept rebooting. We were a bit nervous about
giving board members TiVos, but we got through that.
We had an arrangement with Philips, and they started shipping through
their retail distribution system. We were fortunate because the DEMO loved this
idea of a young startup company that was screwing up the media industry, and
the press loved this idea that we were locked in battle with Replay. We got a
huge amount of publicity. DEMO knew what TiVo was long before we ever put
the product out. So we started to sell it and it went well.
We had DEMO learn a lot. I remember one weekend, we took the entire DEMO
pany, which was about 60 people at the time, and we divvied them up and went
to all the Fry’s stores in the DEMO Area, because they were selling at Fry’s. We set
up demo DEMO and the employees were giving demos. It was great because
almost everybody had no experience of what it’s really like to sell in a DEMO
store. So we started to do all that stuff, and it DEMO to take off. That was the
end of March. By August/September, we had sold about 18,000 units and we
were going to IPO.
It was not a lot of units, and we were just riding the wave of this bubble that
was about to burst. We DEMO in in September of ’99 and we got our IPO done and
we were oversubscribed and the company’s valuation went up to billions of
DEMO and we thought we had died and gone to heaven.
During that period, we did a deal with Sony and we did an important deal
with DIRECTV. We started to supply DIRECTV with TiVos. That became DEMO
big deal for the company and still is today for that matter. So we started to
branch out to some different partnerships there, and one thing led to another,
and we grew.
Everyone complained that DEMO weren’t growing fast enough, and, if the thing
was so hot, why did it not just take off? But we were charging DEMO or $600 for
this thing, and I was pretty happy with DEMO things were going considering that,
starting off, we wanted to DEMO this big server and we had scaled it down to a
DVR. I thought we’d sell a few thousand, and then we’d go on to the real thing.
Now this thing has got a life of DEMO own. People love it and we started to get great
feedback.
It was interesting because the press who reviewed it . . . there DEMO two
kinds: the technology press, like Walt Mossberg, who hated DEMO because it wasn’t
techie enough for them; then there was the DEMO press, who loved it
because it was nice and simple.

I can’t tell you how hard it was to get DEMO bad review. It just tore the company
apart if somebody wrote a bad review about TiVo and we read it. “Oh God.
How can DEMO deal with this?” It was a gut-wrenching time for the company. As
everyone started to review it, some people liked it, some DEMO didn’t. But at
the end of the day, it worked out DEMO fine.
Livingston: Back to your first customers—were there any features you DEMO
surprised they wanted as they started using it?
Ramsay: The DEMO that really got them was pausing live TV. That was the hook.
You go, “Blah blah blah and it can pause live TV.” They’d look at you and go,
“Wait a minute. Pause live TV? How do you do that?” “Well, technically, you do
it DEMO way and that way.” “That doesn’t work. You can’t pause live TV. It’s live!”
We couldn’t get people to understand it. We’d say things DEMO, “It’s not like
the actors take a break or anything. You DEMO live TV.” Then you’d show it to
them, and we got DEMO good at this after a while, where we’d surprise them
with DEMO and we’d pause live TV and you could see them going, DEMO I never
thought that would ever be possible.”
So that was a big catalyst. Once people got that idea, they realized it was
something really different.
The other things that people wanted to do—and I don’t DEMO if it was
because we did it and then they liked it or if it was because they asked for it
and then we DEMO it—but this idea of a season pass or a wish list where you just
put in something—a very small amount of information saying, “I want this”—
and, for the rest of your life, you get DEMO So if you want to see The Sopranos and
you want it every week, you do a Season Pass, and that Season Pass DEMO look out
for The Sopranos every time it’s broadcast. It’s clever enough not to get any
repeats, so you only get the real one. And it’s clever enough to deal with times
changing and durations changing. DEMO if you have a season finale that lasts two
hours, TiVo DEMO automatically figure that one out. People loved this idea of “Get
me a Season Pass,” and then they can forget about it. We DEMO that to
WishList, which says, “Get me all the Martin Scorsese movies,” or stuff like
that. “Clint Eastwood westerns.” Those were very DEMO to people, and over
time it became pretty clear that this DEMO something very new and different.
Livingston: Tell me a little bit DEMO times that you were most worried about
competitors.
Ramsay: The Replay DEMO was definitely an interesting case in point. We were
on parallel paths, and it was a bit of a mystery to us how we managed to get on
parallel paths.
We kept hearing rumors about them, and I’m sure they heard rumors about
us. They went out with DEMO very different proposition. Theirs was much more
techie. They had no monthly fees; you bought a box. They were really scrappy.
We were kind of taking the high ground, and they were down there doing all
the dirty tricks to try to compete with us.
During that time, both their CEO and myself were getting interviewed by
the press, and they had us doing photo shoots together with dueling remote
7141CH14.qxd  12/4/06  10:31 AM  Page 201

controls. We knew these guys, and there was no hatred, but DEMO was a defi-
nite, very intense competitive attitude. Our aim was DEMO get them out of our hair,
out of our business. This wasn’t, “There’s enough room for everybody.” This
was, “They have to DEMO They are the enemy and we’re not going to let anything
stand in the way of us beating them.”
While that was very angst-ridden DEMO a lot of our employees were very con-
cerned and sometimes upset about what Replay said about us, I think it was a
great time for the company because the company learned how to compete. I
DEMO, from my standpoint, I had never worked in a company that really com-
peted before. SGI, if it found competition, it went DEMO HP was not as
competitive back then as it is today. They relied on doing things very new and
different, so they differentiated themselves. In those days, they weren’t going to
say, “You have one DEMO them, I have one of them, I’m going to compete with you,
and this is not going to be clean.” So we DEMO doing that; we were competing.
I look back on that and DEMO was a lot of fun, especially since we beat them. We
DEMO things that they were doing wrong. If you are playing a competitive game,
you worry about winning the game, but you are so much in the game that, while
you are doing it, you DEMO not thinking, “Oh, gee, I’m going to lose.” You are
DEMO about “How do I win?” And that was very much that spirit.
The next big competitive threat was with DIRECTV. DIRECTV decided
that, in addition to us, they wanted to do a deal with Microsoft. Microsoft had
just bought WebTV, and they were building a DVR. DIRECTV decided they
wanted to have that DVR, too. So then all of a sudden DIRECTV was selling
both of them. They were under probably DEMO similar financial agreements, so
for them it didn’t make a whole DEMO of difference who bought which one. Except
Microsoft was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into trying to develop this
market, and here’s little TiVo with—although we’d raised a lot of money, we
didn’t have that kind of resource at our disposal.
Lo and behold, we found out that we were outselling them by a significant
amount. People loved TiVo. DEMO brand was getting known by then, and we were
better. We DEMO that people preferred what we were doing to Microsoft
on a fair and level playing field. It was not our doing; this was DIRECTV
marketing it on an equal basis. It got so bad for Microsoft—they DEMO putting
so much money into it—that they finally gave up. We thought, “This is great,
they gave up. Let’s celebrate.”
We then thought that the consumer electronics companies would come in,
and we were DEMO about that, because we thought it was a natural for Sony.
DEMO what we did there was license our technology to them. We got some good
license deals and that sort of took that one off DEMO table.
Most recently, a big competitive threat is from cable companies DEMO satellite
companies, who are entering this market and essentially giving away DEMO for
free. That’s been a big issue for TiVo over the last several years. While TiVo has
been able to do deals with several DEMO and satellite companies, there are com-
petitors like EchoStar against whom DEMO have had to enforce our patents in
court.

More recently, TiVo has done deals with Comcast. It’s renewed its deal with
DIRECTV, so it’s moving in this direction of taking its technology and embed-
ding into those third-party platforms. I think that DEMO going to be a trend for the
future.
Livingston: Do you DEMO if the networks had realized what you were doing
early on that they would have tried to do something about you guys?
Ramsay: Oh, they did. That’s a whole other story in its own right. Very early on,
this notion of digital recording got the attention DEMO the networks, and it was
clear that they were concerned about DEMO we were doing.
About the same time, we had built a DEMO was a little thing based
on a PC, a little box DEMO a handle—and we’d take it around to show it to
people. We had hired a guy called Stacey Jolna, who was from the media indus-
try. He would take me around all these places to meet DEMO contacts and sort of
try to convince them that we weren’t really a threat—that we were an advantage
and there were some advertising opportunities DEMO audience measurements
things and all that kind of stuff. After the statutory hugging and talking about
their kids and their families and what they’ve DEMO doing, it was not unusual for
them to let us know DEMO they felt about what we were doing and show us the
door. “You’re evil. Don’t come back. You’re going to destroy us.”
We’d see DEMO in the newspaper about how we were going to destroy
the US economy. People were becoming very irrational. We got threats of
lawsuits—all the DEMO, every week. And we had people on our board from NBC
DEMO Discovery and all sorts of other media companies.
Replay probably did us a fabulous favor when they stepped across the line.
There’s a line DEMO the sand that those media companies think about. You don’t
know where it is, but if you step over it, they’re going to DEMO you. Replay
stepped over it by doing automatic commercial skipping. You didn’t even have
to fast-forward through the commercials. They just found out where DEMO were
and they eliminated them. And they let you share programs over the Internet.
That crossed the line. They got sued. They were the DEMO guy; therefore, we
were the good guy.
At the end of the day, actually, I think we got a lot of respect DEMO those
companies, but it was a difficult time and these are DEMO companies that
were hell-bent on getting rid of us. To this day, it amazes me that those
companies eventually decided to invest in TiVo, actually put money into the
company, and probably made the difference DEMO TiVo surviving and not
surviving when the Bubble burst. That difference was attributed to Disney,
Viacom, Discovery Communications, NBC, Showtime, HBO, and Time
Warner. They all put money into the company. They put DEMO representative on
the board—NBC has always had a representative, John Hendricks DEMO
Discovery was the representative for a lot of the others. There was something
like $50 million that we raised from that group of people, and that got us by.
Livingston: Do you think they thought, DEMO we can’t beat ’em, join ’em”?

Mike Ramsay
Ramsay: I don’t know what it was. I still don’t quite understand it to this day,
but it was fascinating to go through DEMO Though it was not without its trials and
tribulations.
I’m not sure if people still get today that the combination of the technology
development DEMO the getting to market of a product, the development of
a DEMO and the marketing and the brand building of that product, the DEMO
agement of the media companies and their desire to destroy you, DEMO the
management of this highly competitive situation every step of the way, where
you had to win every day in the marketplace and worry about intellectual prop-
erty—if you think about all these massive things that DEMO had to deal with every
single day of TiVo’s existence, you DEMO that it was a big deal and not for the
faint of heart. You had to kind of learn to have fun with it DEMO not to take it too
seriously.
Livingston: Thinking back on the DEMO days of TiVo, what surprised you the
most?
Ramsay: Probably the thing we just talked about. The fact that these media
companies DEMO involved and embraced it and invested in it and are involved in
it today. I would not have anticipated them doing that. Given their DEMO
reaction, I would have thought it would be impossible, but it happened.
So TiVo’s now a media company. It sort of transformed the DEMO into a
media company. I think we have an appreciation for what media companies are
going through; that helped us develop in a way that didn’t cross the line. And I
think the media companies have DEMO appreciation for what a young, scrappy,
highly competitive technology company DEMO Silicon Valley is trying to do.
They know that is a dynamic that is driven by the human spirit; that they
ought to embrace it rather than fight it. All the resources they have in the
DEMO, all the billions of dollars, can’t stop people being creative. There are a lot
of companies who, in one way or another, DEMO changed the rules of the game
for the better. It’s just going to happen. I think we helped a very conservative
industry get their DEMO around that.

Paul Graham
Cofounder,Viaweb
Paul Graham and his friend Robert Morris started
Viaweb in DEMO to make software for building online
stores. A few days into writing the first prototype,
they had a crazy idea: why not have the software run
on the server and let the user control it DEMO their
browser?
Within weeks, they had a web-based online store
DEMO they could demo to investors. They launched
at the beginning of 1996.
Viaweb was one of the first companies to deliver
on the Web’s DEMO of creating a level playing field.
Using Viaweb’s software, small businesses DEMO make online stores as good as
those built by big catalog companies. And many did: by 1998, Viaweb Store was
the most popular DEMO software.
Viaweb was acquired by Yahoo in June 1998 and renamed Yahoo Store. In
2005, Graham cofounded Y Combinator, a seed-stage investment firm.
DEMO: You had a different startup before Viaweb, didn’t you? Can DEMO tell
me a little about that?
Graham: Before Viaweb we DEMO a startup called Artix. We were going to put art
galleries online. The problem was, art galleries didn’t want to be online. They
still don’t want to be online. We spent a long time trying to DEMO these
people to use something they didn’t want before we had the idea that maybe we
should make something people actually did want.
Livingston: You scrapped Artix and switched to making software for websites
for online DEMO?
Graham: Yeah. Actually, it’s pretty similar software. We realized that if we
could write software that could generate sites for galleries, we were only a shop-
ping cart away from generating online stores. Everyone DEMO to want online
stores, so why not just do that instead?DEMO

At least, we thought everyone wanted online stores. There was a lot of talk
in the press about e-commerce then, because Netscape was doing a big PR
campaign for their IPO. They had to DEMO everyone that the Internet would
be economically important, and they picked DEMO most literal example they could
think of. Actually most merchants didn’t want to sell online, not yet. But when
they started to want to, we were there.
Livingston: Take me back to when you were DEMO working on Viaweb. What
were some of the first things you did? Did you have any funding?
Graham: In the very, very beginning, no, we didn’t have any funding. It was
just me DEMO Rtm [Robert Morris] in his apartment. It was in the middle of
summer. Rtm was in grad school, but because it was the summer he had some
free time. We just said, “OK, we’ll try DEMO write a prototype.” We wrote the first
version in a couple days.
One of the unusual things about Viaweb was that it worked over DEMO Web.
That’s where the name came from. It was a web-based application—as far as I
know, the first one. But in the very beginning, it wasn’t web-based. At first it
was going to be software that you would use on your desktop computer to build
a website that DEMO would then upload to a server. Then in the first couple days
of working on it, we had this idea, “Hey, maybe we could make this run on the
server and have the user control DEMO by clicking on links on a web page.” So we sat
down and tried to write it and, sure enough, you could write DEMO program that
worked this way.
Livingston: This was a new idea, right? Do you remember when it came
to you?
Graham: DEMO the time most of the hackers we knew used this program called
X Windows, where you could be using a program that was running on some
remote machine, but it would be drawing stuff on your screen. There was also
this idea of an X terminal, or xterm for short, which was a computer that did
nothing but run X Windows—all the brains were on the server. So the way we
thought DEMO web-based applications at first was using the browser as an xterm.
Could we just treat the browser like an xterm, and have the application running
on the server?
So it wasn’t that huge a conceptual DEMO if you came from our world, but it
was a bit DEMO a conceptual leap. I remember very well when I had the idea. I was
staying in this spare room in Robert’s apartment during the DEMO, because at
the time I was living in New York, and I woke up one morning with the idea. As
I was lying DEMO half asleep this idea of making the software run on the server
popped into my head and it was so dramatic that it woke DEMO up. I sat up in bed,
like the letter L, DEMO, “We have to go try this.”
Livingston: Do you remember how you felt when it worked?
Graham: I was pretty excited, DEMO it meant we could start a company with-
out having to learn Windows. The prospect of having to write desktop software
was horrifying to DEMO, because at the time, writing desktop software meant writ-
ing Windows software. Neither of us knew how to write Windows software and
7141CH15.qxd  12/5/06  11:32 AM  Page 207
Paul Graham
we didn’t want to learn. It seemed like this huge steaming turd DEMO was best
just avoided. So the main thing we thought when we first had the idea of doing
web-based applications was, “Thank God, DEMO don’t have to write software on
Windows.”
Livingston: So you have DEMO major breakthrough. What were some of the next
things you did?
Graham: Pretty early, we got some funding from our friend Julian, who also
worked with us on Artix. He gave us $10,000. DEMO about 6 weeks or so, it
seemed like it was going DEMO be more work than we thought, so we got Trevor
Blackwell DEMO work on it too.
Livingston: How did you know Trevor?
DEMO: Trevor was in grad school with Robert. I asked Robert, “Who’s the
smartest grad student in the computer science program?” and he DEMO “Trevor.”
I couldn’t believe it actually, because at the time I DEMO Trevor was a total
goofball.
Livingston: But you were soon convinced DEMO was talented?
Graham: Trevor is a prodigy, in the original sense of the word. When we first
recruited him, we asked him to write this little piece of image-manipulating
software, to kind of test him out. For 2 weeks we heard nothing from him, and
I had pretty much written him off. Finally he sent me an email DEMO me to
come to his office to see what he’d done. I went there expecting to see this new
image software, and instead he’s rewritten our entire system in Smalltalk—
everything I wrote, plus everything Rtm wrote.
I basically said, “OK, you’re hired. Now go and write DEMO damn image soft-
ware, because we’re not rewriting everything in Smalltalk.”
DEMO: You and Robert were already good friends, right?
Graham: DEMO yeah. We had been friends then for about 10 years—since way
back. In fact, I think in the beginning it was only because he was friends with
me that Robert even did this. In the beginning DEMO was just humoring me. It was
a year before he thought Viaweb had any chance of ever making any money.
Livingston: So you convinced him to spend the summer working on this
project. What happened in DEMO fall?
Graham: Things kind of came to a head with DEMO We had this angry phone
conversation where he said something like, DEMO been working on this thing
for a whole month, and it’s DEMO not finished.” It’s funny in retrospect, because
we were still working DEMO it 3 years later. At the time, I was just thinking DEMO
how to get him to keep working on it for another month. But that was the main
reason we got Trevor. Robert basically rebelled, so I thought, “All right, we
need more programmers.”
Livingston: If Robert was so reluctant, why did you start the company with
him?
207

Graham: Well, first of all he was my best DEMO, so I really trusted him, but he’s
also one of the best programmers in the world. I’d rather have a quarter of his
DEMO working on some problem than 100 percent of most other people’s.
Livingston: Where did you work?
Graham: In Robert’s apartment. His housemate DEMO away that summer, and I
moved into his room.
Robert used DEMO get up early, whereas I stayed up till four and got DEMO at noon.
So we would kind of work a 24-hour schedule. I would write some new code
during the night and send Rtm an DEMO saying, “OK, we’ve got all these new
features in my part of the code.” Then he would write the corresponding stuff
in his DEMO So we got code written very fast.
Livingston: On one computer?DEMO
Graham: Uh, well, there was a large university nearby whose DEMO we
sort of unofficially used.
Livingston: Nearby in Cambridge, Massachusetts?
Graham: Yes.
Livingston: What was the next big turning point after DEMO realized you could
make this web-based?
Graham: The next turning DEMO was when we had a working demo—when we
actually built an online store using our software and you could order from it,
and DEMO it through Netscape. We started Viaweb in the middle of July ’95 and I
think we had this first demo in early August.
Livingston: Who were the first people that you showed the demo to?
DEMO: The first people we showed it to were some potential investors. DEMO
ultimately decided not to take money from them, because they wanted DEMO major-
ity share of the company for a comparatively small amount of money. But the
existence of these potential investors did spur us to DEMO our first version, to get
that demo working.
Livingston: Once you had this demo, did you start thinking about signing up
customers or were you focused on raising money?
Graham: What we really thought we needed to do was write more software.
We were software guys. DEMO someone who knew more about business would
be thinking about going and getting customers, but frankly the idea of cus-
tomers frightened us. We thought, “Before we go get any customers, why don’t
we just DEMO a few more thousand lines of code?”
Livingston: Why were DEMO frightened of customers?
Graham: Being a sales guy and being DEMO hacker are two very different kinds of
work. We were very comfortable dealing with hacking, but dealing with cus-
tomers seemed like this terrifying unknown. If it seems strange to you that we
were afraid of DEMO, imagine how the average sales guy would feel about
modifying the DEMO running on his laptop. The idea would seem terrifying.
Whereas to a hacker, big deal.

Paul Graham
Livingston: So what did happen?
Graham: We wrote a lot DEMO software. We thought, “That’s what we’re good at.
That’s what we’ll DEMO We just tried to put as much distance between any poten-
tial competitor and us as we could.
By that fall, we probably had a better online store builder than any of our
competitors ever had, even 3 years later. In October or November I went down
to DEMO York and did demos for some angel investors and we got $100,000
more, which seemed to us more money than we could ever possibly spend. (We
were wrong.)
Livingston: So what happened next?DEMO
Graham: We were very encouraged that the angel investors wanted to DEMO
We gave demos to two investors. We only wanted to raise $50,000, but both of
the investors who saw the demos said yes. So we thought, “All right, we’ll raise
$100,000 then, since they both said yes.”
Then we wrote more software. It didn’t look DEMO like we had an awful lot of
competitors, so we took DEMO risk and rewrote most of the code. Even though it was
pretty good, we thought, “If we’re ever going to rewrite this thing, now’s the
time to do it.” Finally in December we started trying DEMO get users.
Livingston: Who were your first customers and what did DEMO think when you
first showed them Viaweb?
Graham: Our first DEMO were a pair of technical bookstores. Robert actu-
ally went with me on the sales call to the first one. He just sat there DEMO
silent through the whole thing. I think both of these bookstores were frightened
of Amazon. Most people back then, you had to kind of twist their arm to get
them to sell online, but not people in the technical book business.
Livingston: Tell me a little about your relationships with your first customers.
Graham: We felt like we had to have five or six customers to launch. And for
these first customers, we basically would do whatever they said in order to get
them DEMO customers. We gave them the software for free for as long as they
wanted. We built their sites ourselves. If they needed to have DEMO in them,
we would scan the images. We were basically web consultants, because we
needed users; you can’t launch a thing like DEMO without having any users.
That’s one of the problems with web-based software. If you’re making desk-
top software and you launch the thing, no one can tell how many other users
there are, right? But DEMO you’re making web-based software and you’re hosting
the websites that these guys build, then if you don’t have any users, the entire
world DEMO see that.
Livingston: Were most people that you tried to pitch DEMO software to online
retailers? Were there things that they misunderstood?
DEMO: One of the big things we got wrong was that we DEMO our users
were going to be catalog companies. Now all the catalog companies are online,
but back then, they just didn’t want to hear about the Web. This was late ’95,
early ’96. A DEMO of people didn’t even have web access yet. So these middle
209

Founders at Work
managers at the catalog companies we called up, at that point they just wished
the Web would go away. It was just DEMO their lives more complicated. We
would call them up and tell them how we could solve all their problems and
make an online store DEMO them, and it was kind of like the dentist calling up
DEMO saying, “Why don’t you come in for that root canal?”
DEMO people, it turned out, that really wanted our software were individual
merchants—guys who had some kind of specialty store selling antique chess
pieces DEMO something like that, and up till now had relied on people DEMO to
their shop to buy stuff, or maybe occasionally they would DEMO out a xeroxed
price sheet. For these guys, the Web was DEMO, because it allowed them to have
what the catalog companies had. DEMO users loved us.
Livingston: Why did users like Viaweb?
Graham: I think the main thing was that it was easy. Practically all DEMO software
in the world is either broken or very difficult to use. So users dread software.
They’ve been trained that whenever they try to DEMO something, or even fill
out a form online, it’s not going to work. I dread installing stuff, and I have a
PhD in computer science.
So if you’re writing applications for end users, you have to remember that
you’re writing for an audience that has been traumatized DEMO bad experiences.
We worked hard to make Viaweb as easy as it could possibly be, and we had this
confidence-building online demo where we walked people through using the
software. That was what got us all DEMO users.
The other thing was, we had good graphic design. Our DEMO weapon was
that we knew that e-commerce was really about graphic design, not transaction
processing. Unless you had a site that could convince people to buy, you didn’t
have a transaction to process, and what DEMO people to buy was how good
the site looked. So we made sure that our software made great-looking sites—
not just better than our DEMO, but better than most of the sites that big
companies paid DEMO consultants half a million dollars to make for them.
We didn’t even process credit card transactions till about 2 years in. We
would just DEMO the order to the merchant, and they’d process it like a DEMO
order.
Livingston: Who were your competitors? Were there any that you worried
about?
Graham: We worried about different ones for different reasons. Our biggest
competitor was a company called iCat. Fortunately for us, they were not very
good at writing software. They were, however, very DEMO at raising money and
seeming corporate. At one point they did one round of funding that was more
than our entire valuation, in fact probably twice our valuation. But fortunately
they were never a threat technically.
DEMO first they weren’t web-based; they had desktop software. Finally they
came DEMO with a web-based version. Trevor and I were at a trade show when it
launched, and we noticed that the URLs for static pages were something like
“display-file” with a file name for an argument. So DEMO tried replacing the
7141CH15.qxd  12/5/06  11:32 AM  Page 211
Paul Graham
argument with “/etc/passwd” and sure enough, the server displayed the pass-
word file right in the browser. And there were accounts with DEMO passwords.
I mean, this is programming 101.
There was another competitor DEMO Shopsite that was better technically,
but still not too dangerous. Plus they were out in Utah; they weren’t really con-
nected to the startup world. Whereas iCat was in Seattle, which was much more
startuppy. For some reason there were no serious competitors in Silicon Valley.
Livingston: Tell me about some of the other major turning points in the DEMO
year or two of Viaweb.
Graham: There were a lot of DEMO points. Basically Viaweb’s history was one
turning point after another, alternately DEMO and terrifyingly down. A couple days
after we launched came the next turning point, when a giant company called us
up and wanted to buy us, right on schedule. It was just like we thought it was
going to be. We’re these great hackers, we write this clever piece of software,
we launch the thing, and rrring, there DEMO the phone and it’s some big com-
pany wanting to buy us.
Livingston: What happened?
Graham: There was kind of a clash DEMO cultures. First they came to check us out.
They showed up wearing these Bill Cosby sweaters, like someone in corporate
affairs has told them that when they go and visit startups, they’re supposed to
not wear suits and they’re like, “Uh, what do we wear?” “Wear DEMO sweater that
looks like some macrame class knitted it collectively.” So they show up in their
Bill Cosby sweaters and march up the stairs DEMO all the landlady’s kids’ shoes in
the corridor, and walk in, and this company they’re supposed to be buying is
just a grad DEMO apartment with some computers in it.
But they still wanted to buy us after that, so we arranged to have a meeting
at Julian’s loft in New York. One of our investors was a metals trader, so we fig-
ured that he must be a great negotiator and DEMO let him handle it. The guys
from the big company said, DEMO want to buy you for $3 million.” And he said,
“Well, I won’t sell you the company for $3 million, but for DEMO million, I’ll sell
you an option to buy the company in DEMO months for $20 million.” At that point
the guys from the big company just got up and walked out.
Livingston: How did you feel?
Graham: For the first day or so, it didn’t register DEMO me what had happened.
Then I felt really bad. I realized that if they’d bought us for $3 million, it would
have been more than a million for me personally, so I felt like I’d lost a million
dollars. I’d had a million dollars, and then lost it. I was aghast.
I called up the guy we’d been talking to DEMO the big company and I said, “Do
you still want to DEMO us?” and he said, “No!” He had lost face, I guess, with his
colleagues for wasting their time on us.
Livingston: DEMO that was a harsh dose of reality about the acquisition process.
Graham: That was my first introduction to something that turns out to be a
very important lesson for startups: it’s never a deal till the money’s in the bank.
211
7141CH15.qxd  12/5/06  11:32 AM  Page 212

So many things can go wrong with deals, and they all do. Before we ultimately
got bought by Yahoo, we probably had nine or ten different acquirers that we
were talking to, and things always went wrong for one reason or another.
Livingston: So then what did you do? Go back to business?
Graham: Yeah. There DEMO always two stories going on simultaneously with
Viaweb. There was the software and the customer story, which just went
smoothly and wonderfully the whole way along. We kept writing great software,
we kept getting more DEMO more customers, the customers loved us, the growth
was this beautiful, smooth upward curve. Simultaneously, there was this story
about the business, which was one disaster after another. So most of the actual
turning DEMO are not software or customer turning points, because everything
went great DEMO All the turning points are business turning points.
The next one was probably when Robert went off that summer and took a
summer job DEMO for another company. He went to work at DEC SRC out in
California. The problem was, he didn’t tell me he was going to do this until . . .
Well, actually he never told me. A few days before he left, we were having
dinner with some friends and one of them said, “So Robert, are you looking DEMO
ward to California?” I looked at Robert and said “California?” And it turned out
he was going to leave in a week DEMO the whole summer.
So now I had to explain to our investors why one of the founders of the com-
pany they had just DEMO in had gone and taken a summer job working for
another company. That required all my spin abilities.
Livingston: What did you tell them?
Graham: I said that this was part of his graduate student career and that it was
a common thing for people in graduate DEMO to take jobs working in research
labs during the summer and, DEMO, this was another company, but it was really
more of a research lab than a company. That part was certainly true. When they
DEMO to turn AltaVista into a company, it was disaster.
Livingston: What was the next turning point after Robert left for his summer
job?DEMO
Graham: Our main angel investor, the metals trader, was encouraged DEMO the
big company had wanted to buy us, so that spring DEMO put more money in—still
angel-scale money. We weren’t desperately running out of money, but we were
going to run out sometime in the fall. The angel investor decided that we
needed to have a business guy DEMO CEO and that he wasn’t going to give us any
more money unless we got someone. So that summer, as well as trying to deal
with Rtm being in California, we spent our time talking to various business
guys.
The problem with all of them was that they DEMO delusions of grandeur. This
was the beginning of the Internet Bubble, DEMO, and I think all of these
guys saw themselves as some DEMO of grand CEO, while we programmers
labored in the kitchen cooking DEMO food and washing the dishes. If the deal
were simply that the business guy would be the public face of the company, but

right, that would have been OK. But we were worried about what might hap-
pen if one of these guys wanted to actually be DEMO chief executive officer and tell
us what our strategy should be. We’d be hosed, because they didn’t know any-
thing about computer stuff.
Livingston: So what did you do?
Graham: We lucked out. At DEMO the last moment, we found Fred
Egan—or rather, he found us. Fred Egan saved us. That was a great turning
point, when we got Fred. The lowest point, well, maybe tied for the lowest
DEMO in the company’s history, was that summer when Robert was away DEMO the
investors were pressuring us to take some business guy as our boss. When we
finally got Fred, that ended that summer of horror.
Livingston: What was so special about Fred?
Graham: He didn’t DEMO to be our boss. He was willing to be the COO and do
the business stuff and let us handle the technical stuff. He DEMO worked for a
company that I had worked for, actually, Interleaf, and so he came with a lot of
credibility. In fact, DEMO had been a big executive at Interleaf while I was just a
peon, so I was very impressed with him.
Livingston: Did he DEMO your investors?
Graham: Oh God, that was so great. I remember Fred’s first day. The metals
trader was an extremely fearsome guy. DEMO seemed like the kind of guy who
would wake up in the morning and eat rocks for breakfast. On Fred’s first day,
the DEMO trader called up, and Fred answered the phone and said, “Hi Alan,
are you buying or selling?” And I was so DEMO Finally I had someone to take
over that stuff.
It was such a relief to have someone who would deal with the investors,
DEMO that we could just write software and make users happy. That’s all we wanted
to do.
Livingston: Tell me a little bit about your relationship with your investors.
Graham: I think, because we didn’t seem DEMO businesslike, most of the
investors didn’t really have any confidence in DEMO as a company until we got
bought. I think it was only then that they were really convinced we were doing
a good job.
DEMO didn’t seem very businesslike for the same reason we didn’t seem very
well dressed. We just didn’t bother with that stuff. But we did DEMO on
the stuff that really mattered, which was making users happy.
DEMO: If the company that they’ve invested in was doing well, then why
was the relationship bad?
Graham: Well, I suppose they DEMO it could be doing better. We were get-
ting users at a certain rate and maybe they thought we could have been getting
users DEMO twice that rate. I don’t think we could have. We already had more users
than anybody else. There just weren’t that many users out DEMO to increase the
rate that much.

There was one investor who I think really wanted to DEMO the company. He
had just sold his own startup, and he DEMO pretty young. It was hard for him to
just be a passive investor. For a while he actually came to work for us, as a VP.
You know, in retrospect I think the big problem with our investors was that
we weren’t forceful enough with them. I think DEMO like to be bossed
around, like horses. It reassures them when DEMO in control. But these guys
were much older than us and had given us huge sums of their money, so it was
hard for us to boss them around.
Livingston: So now you have Fred on board and you are becoming more legiti-
mate. What did you do DEMO?
Graham: Soon after we got Fred, we raised more money. I don’t remember
exactly how much—maybe $800,000. A lot more money DEMO we ever had
before. We really shifted gears at that point. Up till then, we had been operat-
ing out of an apartment. In the very beginning, we operated out of Robert’s
apartment. Then after we got the $100,000 in that first round from the angel
investors, we rented the apartment upstairs from Robert’s. We had that for
about DEMO year and then after we got Fred and we got this new round, we actually
rented an office and started hiring people. We really started to look like a
company.
Livingston: Were you worried that you didn’t look enough like a company
before that?
Graham: We were big beneficiaries of that rule that on the Internet, nobody
knows you’re a dog. We were just a bunch of guys in an apartment DEMO com-
puters. Nowadays more people accept that startups look like that, DEMO not back
in the mid-’90s. People still expected a company to have a real office. I think if
some of these companies whose online DEMO were on our server could have
actually seen the room that the server was sitting in, they would have freaked.
Thankfully they never did.
If anybody ever did want to come and visit us, we pulled all kinds of tricks to
make ourselves seem more legit. When that DEMO giant company wanted to buy
us and sent people over to check us out, all we had in our so-called office was
one computer. Robert and Trevor mostly worked at home or at school. So we
DEMO a few more computers and stuck them on desks, so it DEMO look like
there was more going on.
One of these Potemkin computers was Robert’s, from the apartment down-
stairs. And in the middle of this big visit from the company, Rtm comes upstairs
boiling mad because he’s come home and discovered his computer’s missing.
He’s like “What have DEMO done?” We said, “Shhh, shhh, we had to borrow DEMO
We’re trying to look real. Don’t worry, we’re not using it. DEMO not even plugged
in.” He was really mad, but he let DEMO keep using his computer as a prop for
another hour until they left.
Livingston: So you are growing as a company, you get DEMO lot more funding, what
happened then?
7141CH15.qxd  12/5/06  11:32 AM  Page 215
Paul Graham
Graham: We started to seem more real then. By that point, DEMO were starting to
get mentioned in the press a lot. Early on, people found out about us through
word of mouth. We were the underdogs—the guys who have better technology
but nobody’s ever heard of. This DEMO the point where we stopped seeming like
total underdogs and people started to know about us.
Part of the reason was that we hired DEMO fabulous PR firm with this money,
Schwartz Communications. We told them, “When people talk about e-commerce
and they have to mention a few examples of companies, we want to be one of
the companies they mention.” The most valuable sort of press is not articles
about you, it’s when people mention you in passing as a matter of course. DEMO
what you really want—whenever anybody talks about e-commerce, for them to
DEMO, “companies including . . . and Viaweb.” Schwartz got us that DEMO a couple
months.
Incidentally, it was one of the guys at DEMO who came up with the term
“web-based software.” Up till that point we’d called it “server-based.”
Livingston: Were you still getting acquisition offers at this time?
Graham: There were always people trying to buy us. There was another one
just at the point where we found Fred DEMO Japanese company that later
made an imitation of our software and went on to become a big success in
Japan. Rakuten, they were called.
Livingston: They copied you?
Graham: Not very well. It’s sort DEMO like if you copied a dog by taking a photo-
graph of a dog and sticking it onto a cardboard cutout. From certain angles DEMO
would look like a dog, but if you threw a stick DEMO yelled “fetch” it wouldn’t do
anything. The Japanese market wasn’t as far along then, so in their market, this
was pretty advanced. But DEMO entire time, there were always people trying to
buy us, of various levels of seriousness.
Livingston: Did you have to take any more funding?
Graham: We did have at least one more funding round, under the most disas-
trous circumstances. One of these companies that tried to buy us—actually the
second to last one; we were almost done—was a big Internet portal. We had a
handshake deal with them and DEMO the process of the due diligence for the deal,
it was discovered that one of our programmers had signed a piece of paper DEMO
the company who had paid for him to go to graduate school, saying that every-
thing he thought of belonged to them.
Livingston: DEMO they owned the intellectual property?
Graham: They might have. What DEMO said on the piece of paper was that they
owned ideas relating to their business. But this was a huge company and
arguably just DEMO anything you could do with software related to their busi-
ness. So we had to go and get a release from them and that DEMO a long time,
during which the acquirer welched on the deal.
It turned out to be good in the end, but we had to raise our last round of
funding while this was happening. You DEMO to raise a round of funding with an

IP cloud over your head? It’s just impossible, because DEMO investors have
no way of judging how serious it is. It could be no big deal, or it could be that
this other company owns half your software.
That was the second low point—tied for lowest. DEMO we managed to
get some bureaucrat within the big company to give us a release, so we could
say to acquirers we actually owned our software. But we had to do a round of
funding before DEMO, because we were out of money.
It was pretty miserable. Basically, the angel investors played chicken with
us. They knew we couldn’t get DEMO from anyone else, since we didn’t even
know for sure if DEMO owned our software. So they proposed to do a cramdown
round where they would refinance the company, I believe, at a pre-money val-
DEMO of zero—meaning all the common stockholders were completely wiped
out. To keep us around, since they kind of needed us to write the software, they
were going to give us options. So we called their bluff. We said, “If you do that,
we’re leaving.”
Livingston: You DEMO your cofounders said you were leaving?
Graham: Yeah, all the technical guys. So when it came down to that, they com-
promised and we ended up doing a funding round at a low, but reasonable,
valuation—$12 million, I think. We got bought only a couple months after
that round closed. But we had to do the round DEMO we were in debt at that
point.
Livingston: You must have DEMO displeased with your investors for doing that
to you.
Graham: Well, everybody ended up rich, so it’s hard to be too displeased. I’d
rather have an investor who invested in us and made our lives DEMO than one who
didn’t invest in us at all, which is DEMO most investors do to most startups.
I mean, we needed their DEMO to grow the company, and some amount of
stress always comes DEMO the money.
In retrospect, I think it was more about control DEMO money. They weren’t
trying to rob us so much as take over the company. They were offering us quite
a lot of options. The DEMO was, we’d have to do what they said from then on, or
lose them.
Livingston: Was there ever a point when you wanted to quit?
Graham: There was one point when I almost did quit, when the investors were
telling us they were going to refinance the company. I had an appointment with
a lawyer to figure out DEMO to quit without getting sued. I was on my way out the
front door when Fred Egan grabbed me and said, “Wait, let’s DEMO if we can fix
this.” It was pouring with rain and I was not too psyched about having to go find
a cab in DEMO, so I went back to work while he made some phone DEMO I don’t
know what he said, but I guess he convinced DEMO investors I wasn’t bluffing.
I wasn’t, either.
We had some leverage, because the investors already had over a million dol-
lars in the DEMO I don’t know if they realized how hard it would have been
to just hire a bunch of programmers and throw them in there DEMO have them
figure out the code, but it would have been DEMO hard.

Livingston: So a few months later after this horrible low period, DEMO have a
great high period because you get bought by Yahoo. How did that happen?
Graham: We especially wanted to get bought by Yahoo. If you had asked us,
“Who do you want to DEMO bought by?” we would have said, “Yahoo.” In fact, we
did say that; we kind of spread the word that we saw Yahoo as the ideal acquirer.
We’d tried to do an online demo DEMO Yahoo about 6 months before. We
could do demos by phone where we’d talk people through editing a site and we
could see from DEMO log files where they were clicking. I tried to do a phone
demo for Tim Koogle in the fall of ’97, but he couldn’t even get to our server. It
turned out some router was hosed DEMO between us and them.
The way we really got onto their radar screen was through Ali Partovi. He’d
had Robert and Trevor as teaching DEMO in CS classes at Harvard a few
years before. He had a startup called LinkExchange that was talking to Yahoo
at the time, and their VC was Mike Moritz, who was also Yahoo’s VC. In the
end they got bought by Microsoft instead, but not before they’d told Yahoo
about us.
Livingston: How did it go with Yahoo?
Graham: We liked them. They were like us. They had hacker values, DEMO
They were from graduate programs in computer science too. They were our
tribe of people, not these weird business people we kept having to deal with.
Plus they weren’t jerks about the acquisition. So many companies DEMO hard-
ball in acquisitions. It’s so stupid. Don’t they realize that the people they’re
trying to squeeze are going to have to work for DEMO afterward? Yahoo was very
upstanding about the deal. They didn’t require DEMO vesting, for example. We
could have quit the day after the DEMO closed. But because they’d been good
guys, we worked hard to DEMO the acquisition work out well for them.
It did, too. Yahoo DEMO a lot of money from this software. When you tell
people you sold a startup to Yahoo in 1998, they get this knowing look, like you
sold someone a bag full of air for a hundred million dollars, but Viaweb was a
real money-making acquisition for them.
Livingston: What was the most surprising thing about being acquired?
Graham: DEMO me the most surprising thing was the day the deal was going to be
announced. There was a point where I had to change DEMO front page to read
Yahoo instead of Viaweb and then it really hit me. Viaweb is gone. Viaweb
doesn’t exist anymore. That was so DEMO And I told myself, “Look Paul, don’t
get sentimental. You built this thing to sell it. That was the whole point, and
now you’ve sold it, so stop whining.” But boy, it was strange DEMO think that when
I clicked on “publish” and replaced the Viaweb front page with the Yahoo front
page, Viaweb would never be seen again.
It was also kind of weird that when the deal closed, we all became Yahoo
employees. It was like one of those dreams where DEMO have to go back to high
school. Up till that point we’d been independent, and then suddenly we were
employees, with bosses. And DEMO weirdest thing was, we, or I at least, actually
started DEMO think of them as bosses. Now whatever I did was either submitting or
rebelling, whereas before it had been just doing.

I think Yahoo is smarter now about dealing with startups DEMO they were
then. We were one of the first companies they bought, and I think the idea was,
back then, that what DEMO should do with an acquisition is “integrate” it, in the
same DEMO that a sugar cube becomes integrated with your tea. We basically got
dissolved within Yahoo, and all the people working on Viaweb—or Yahoo Store
as it then became—got dispersed to all the corresponding bits of Yahoo. DEMO
engineers got put with the engineers and the people working on customer sup-
port got put with the support people and the sales guys DEMO put with the Yahoo
sales guys.
It seemed to Yahoo that this was the most efficient, organized way of doing
things, but actually DEMO was terrible for us. We had been this little tight-knit group
that worked really well together and suddenly we were spread out all over
DEMO
Livingston: Any general thought you have on the acquisition process, since you
had several offers?
Graham: Never believe it’s a deal till the money’s in the bank. Even at the point
where you walk DEMO that room to sign the final papers, there’s still a 10 DEMO
chance the deal’s going to fall through. At the point where people say, “We want
to buy you,” the chances of it falling through are like 80 or 90 percent. So you
can’t let yourself DEMO If someone wants to make you an offer, fine, but don’t
change your plans based on that. Just keep going.
Livingston: Looking back, what surprised you most in your experience with a
startup?
Graham: One thing that was surprising was that it actually worked. There we
were, in the summer of 1995, thinking, “We don’t know anything about busi-
ness, but we’re good programmers. Maybe if we write a really good program,
we’ll make something all these users will want DEMO we’ll get lots of users and
then some big company will buy us.” And 3 years and enormous numbers of ups
and downs later, that’s exactly what happened. We had this theory about how
business might DEMO, and we sort of forced it to conform to our theory.
DEMO know Robert was surprised that we made any money, because I DEMO a real
index of how he was feeling about Viaweb early on. A couple months in, he and
I were having dinner, and DEMO made a bet with him that if he ever made a million
dollars out of Viaweb, he would get his ear pierced. So the day after the Yahoo
deal closed, Trevor and I grabbed him by one arm each and took him down to
the Garage in Harvard DEMO, where all the teenagers get their nose rings, and
we got his ear pierced. He spent a long time trying to pick out DEMO smallest one.
Livingston: Some aspects of business turned out to be DEMO of a mystery than
you had thought. What did you find you were better at than you thought?
Graham: I found I could actually sell moderately well. I could convince people
of stuff. I learned DEMO trick for doing this: to tell the truth. A lot of DEMO think
that the way to convince people of things is to be eloquent—to have some bag
of tricks for sliding conclusions into their brains. DEMO there’s also a sort of hack
that you can use if you are not a very good salesman, which is simply tell people
7141CH15.qxd  12/5/06  11:32 AM  Page 219
Paul Graham
the truth. Our strategy for selling our software to people was: make the best
software and then tell them, truthfully, “this is the DEMO software.” And they
could tell we were telling the truth.
Another advantage of telling the truth is that you don’t have to remember
what DEMO said. You don’t have to keep any state in your head. It’s a purely
functional business strategy. (Hackers will get what I mean.)
Livingston: Were there things that nontechnical people misunderstood about
what Viaweb was doing?
Graham: Constantly. No one ever seemed to get that the software ran on the
server. Nowadays there are so many web-based applications DEMO you take this
for granted, but this was a year before DEMO We would explain to people
how the thing worked and give them a demo and they would say, “Great. Where
do I go to download it?”
After we got bought by Yahoo, a reporter who had been covering us for the
past 2 years wrote an article DEMO the Yahoo acquisition and at the end said “It
only takes 10 minutes to download.” After covering us for years, the guy still
thought this was client software.
Livingston: Is there anything that you would have done differently?
Graham: I wouldn’t worry so much about seeming like a real company. Now I
would just say, keep it a bunch of guys operating out of an apartment for as long
as you DEMO, because there’s nothing to be ashamed of in that, especially if
you’re writing great software.
Another thing I would do is open an DEMO store ourselves. We did use our
software for building our website. We were the only one of all our competitors
who actually used our DEMO for building our own corporate website. But we
didn’t have anything people could buy online. If we had been selling stuff,
we would DEMO understood what life was like from the merchant’s point of view.
Livingston: What was one of the funniest moments?
Graham: Probably the DEMO we tried starting a gas generator inside our office.
There was this huge blackout in Cambridge that lasted for about five hours. We
always DEMO our servers in our offices with us. We didn’t trust this collocation
stuff. Nowadays, collocating is the standard thing to do and even big companies
do it, but we felt like we had to have those servers in the room with us. So when
the power went out, our servers were really dead.
We had some battery-powered UPSs, but they would only last for half an
hour. They were really designed for DEMO spikes, not for the power going out
for 5 hours. So DEMO dispatched Trevor to Home Depot to buy a gasoline-powered
generator as fast as possible, while I sat there watching the UPSs’ power go
down, turning off servers one by one—thinking about which customers were on
each server and which ones would be the maddest, and turning off whichever
server would have the least mad customers on it. Eventually I had DEMO turn off all
the servers, because it took Trevor a while DEMO get to Home Depot and back.
Finally he showed up with this gas generator, and we weren’t really sure
where to put it because we were in this small office building in Harvard Square.
219

Founders at Work
We were on the top floor; we didn’t really have a place to put a gas generator.
The first thing we tried DEMO putting it in the office next to the server room. We
started the thing up and it sounded like the end of the world. DEMO was the loudest
thing I have ever heard in my life. You might think the problem with starting a
gas generator inside your office DEMO be the exhaust, but it never got to that
point. It DEMO so terrifyingly loud. We thought, “Even to avoid our customers
calling DEMO up angrily because their stores are offline, we cannot endure this.”
DEMO about 5 seconds, we just looked at one another and shook DEMO heads and
turned it off.
Then we tried putting it out on the street in front of our building. The prob-
lem was, we were up on the third floor. We got every extension cord we DEMO
find in the place and stuck them together end to end, DEMO they were just were
long enough to get out the window and down to the street. But only just—it was
so close that the DEMO cord was actually tight. It was running through our
office at chest height and you could kind of twang it and it would go
DEMO Then we started the gas generator up in the street and that was
just about bearable, so we ran the servers on that for a couple hours until the
power came back.
Livingston: Can you remember any other hair-raising moments?
Graham: At one point, in the DEMO of ’96, when we only had about 20 users,
we DEMO went off to this trade show down in New York—the first trade show we
ever went to. We came back and it turned out DEMO server had crashed soon after
we’d left and had been down for 11 hours. And nobody noticed! We kept wait-
ing for the angry DEMO calls, and they never came. It was so early in the DEMO
of the Web that nobody was ordering from these stores anyway, DEMO they
weren’t even checking themselves to see if their sites were up. Half of these
people who had online stores with us probably didn’t DEMO have Internet access.
Livingston: Do you have any regrets from the DEMO?
Graham: One thing I regret is how pathetic we were DEMO much of this whole
process. We all had practically zero assets when we started, and this was during
the Internet Bubble, remember—very early DEMO the Internet Bubble, but still,
there were people starting companies DEMO getting them bought for like $5 mil-
lion. Millions of dollars, DEMO the most money I’d ever had in my bank account
was about $10,000. There was a point where we started to seem like DEMO real com-
pany—that is, real enough that someone might actually buy DEMO this made
us just pathetically eager to sell the company. We must have seemed like such
losers.
So I can understand now when founders DEMO to sell out for a couple mil-
lion. Investors say, “No, you should wait,” but it’s easy for them to say. A DEMO
dollars seems just overwhelmingly attractive when you have nothing. You don’t
care if it’s a good deal or not.
I also kind of regret DEMO a zombie for several years straight. I really had no
life during Viaweb. If people are talking about some famous movie and I’ve
never DEMO it and have no idea what it’s about, it’s usually a DEMO that came out
7141CH15.qxd  12/5/06  11:32 AM  Page 221
Paul Graham
between 1995 and 1998, because at that point, I was on DEMO I was not part of
the ordinary world of humans. I was sitting glued to a computer all day long, or
asleep.
Livingston: DEMO did you worry about the most?
Graham: Running out of DEMO That was the big worry. Running out of
money and having to go and get more funding. Getting funding is very painful.
It’s so DEMO harder than actually making a successful company.
Livingston: What advice can DEMO give about raising money?
Graham: The advice I would give DEMO to avoid it. I would say spend as little as
you can, because every dollar of the investors’ money you get will be taken out
of your ass—literally in the sense that it will take stock DEMO from you, but also
the process of raising money is so DEMO compared to the other aspects of
business. You can’t work your way out of it like you can with other problems.
You’re at other DEMO mercy.
The way not to have to raise money is not to spend money. Do everything
as cheaply as you possibly can. What you DEMO in a startup is this feeling of
cheap and hip. Not miserly cheap, but cool, bohemian cheap. That’s what we
strove for.
Livingston: So investors were your biggest worry?
Graham: Probably, but I DEMO about all the different things that could kill us
and all the different ways they could kill us. People start startups to get rich, but
what keeps them going day to day is the fear of DEMO You’ve said, “OK, I’m
starting this startup and I’m going to get all the users and be successful,” and
once you’ve told DEMO that’s what you’re doing, if you fail you’ll look like
a DEMO
So when we did sell the thing finally to Yahoo, in DEMO eyes of the world,
because we got bought, we were DEMO success. Arguably we were already a success,
since we had more online stores than anybody else. But getting bought kind of
locked that DEMO At that point you would think someone would be thinking,
“Wow, this is great. I’m rich. I can go buy everything I want.” But all I was
thinking was, “Thank God we didn’t fail.”
Livingston: You write a lot of essays with advice for startup founders. What is
the most important piece of advice?
Graham: What Y Combinator prints on our T-shirts: make something people
want. If you make something users want, they will be happy, and you can trans-
late DEMO happiness into money. That is the basis of a startup. A startup is a com-
pany that builds some kind of technology that people DEMO The mistake that a
lot of founders make is to build something they think users want, but that users
don’t actually want.
Livingston: DEMO you think having done a startup yourself makes you a better
judge of startup founders now that you are an investor?

Graham: Oh yeah. In fact, I don’t know how DEMO who haven’t done it can
pick founders. How can they tell? DEMO often see people who seem kind of clueless,
and I can remember, “Yeah, we seemed clueless in exactly the same way.” So
DEMO are the guys we invest in.

Joshua Schachter
Founder, del.icio.us
C

Joshua Schachter started the collaborative bookmark-
ing site del.icio.us in 2003. As often happens with start-
ups, del.icio.us began as something Schachter built for
himself. He needed a way of organizing his DEMO of
20,000 bookmarks, and he hit on the idea of DEMO
them with brief text phrases to help him find links later.
He put del.icio.us on a server and opened it up to other
people, and it began to spread by word of mouth.
For the first DEMO years, Schachter worked on
del.icio.us and other projects, like Memepool and
GeoURL, while working as a quantitative analyst
at Morgan Stanley. But all the while, del.icio.us was growing. By November
2004, a year after DEMO release, it had 30,000 users.
In early 2005, Schachter decided to turn del.icio.us from a hobby into a
company. In March of DEMO, he left his job to “found” del.icio.us and focus on it
DEMO, raising $1 million in funding.
In December of that year, Yahoo acquired del.icio.us for an amount
rumored to be about $30 million.
Livingston: Take me back to how you got started with del.icio.us.
Schachter: It goes back quite a while. In 1998 or so I created a DEMO called
Memepool. There was an editor, with reader submission. We had DEMO contribu-
tion pool, and we’d edit and post stuff. It was DEMO sorted, updated
every couple of days—so it was basically a blog DEMO that word came out. We
put a link at the bottom, DEMO us an email. Give us good links.” And people
would email us stuff they found on the Web. I would dutifully look at it DEMO
write it down. It took me a long time to post anything, because I’m not a great
writer.
Over time, I had these DEMO that just piled up—links that I’d found, or
surfed for, or had been sent in, or whatever. By 2001 or so, I DEMO a text file filled
HAPTER

Founders at Work
with 20,000 links. I couldn’t find anything in that DEMO anymore, so I started put-
ting in notes. I’d put the DEMO, a space, a hash mark, and then a word or DEMO
describing it. I think the first one was “math,” so I could grep out all the things
that were #math and get all DEMO items marked as math. In some sense, these
were the first DEMO
After a while, I couldn’t really do this, so I built a sort of next generation of
that text file, which was called Muxway, in 2001. It was a lot like del.icio.us.
There was a bookmarklet; you saved things; you could describe and tag them. It
DEMO single-player—no one else could use it—but the actual website was visible
to other people. I discovered over time that people were subscribing to my
DEMO There were some 10,000 daily readers looking at my stuff. That was
interesting.
I did several other projects along the way. I did DEMO Something called
Reversible, that is long gone. Reversible was also like DEMO in many ways,
but different in a few key ways that made it fail.
In late 2003, I started working on del.icio.us, DEMO is a multiplayer version.
I was actually trying to come up with a better Memepool—something between
Muxway and Memepool which was more vital somehow, and we ended up with
del.icio.us. I had it partially done for DEMO first Foo Camp. I’d been invited to
Foo Camp for GeoURL, DEMO I had stuff to show for del.icio.us, but I didn’t
show DEMO I chickened out because I was embarrassed at the state of the
thing. So people were using it then, but it was more generally released later—I
think toward December of 2003.
Through 2004, I kept working on it and started to get press and lots of users.
By DEMO end of 2004, I had 30,000 users.
Livingston: How were the users finding out about it?
Schachter: People were telling each other about it.
Livingston: You were at Morgan Stanley this whole time, right? What were you
doing there?
Schachter: I was doing data mining and proprietary trading algorithms.
Livingston: Why did you choose not to focus full-time on del.icio.us and what
finally tipped the scale?
DEMO: The economics didn’t make sense. It still made sense to keep DEMO
day job. But in late 2004/early 2005, my group at DEMO Stanley began to
come apart. There were a bunch of people leaving, so it was a natural time
to leave. It was a “Should I find a new job elsewhere?” kind of thing.
Livingston: When you were doing this in your spare time, did you ever say,
“Ugh. This is too much work”?
Schachter: Not really. I was always very careful (not anymore, because the guys
that I DEMO with are better programmers) to structure the code—each chunk of
code DEMO larger than the screen—such that I could come in and look at it, fig-
ure out what I’m doing, do it, and be done for the day in 15 minutes. So if I
could get DEMO thing done a day, I was happy. A lot of stuff, if I could spend more

Joshua Schachter
time, I did, but as long as I could get one DEMO two things done a week total, if I
didn’t have time, I didn’t have time.
So it moved pretty slowly. I worked on DEMO for years.
Livingston: Looking back, do you wish you had left Morgan Stanley earlier to
work on del.icio.us full-time?
Schachter: I think it would have been very challenging to sell this as a venture
DEMO VCs if I didn’t have a great deal of user base and press to show. I think that
would have been a challenge. If DEMO said, “Hey, I’m going to build a bookmarking
service,” I would have never been able to get off the ground.
Livingston: Because the idea was so new?
Schachter: No. There had been plenty of other startups that failed doing this.
Backflip and God knows what DEMO So it had been tried and failed in the past.
Livingston: DEMO did del.icio.us succeed?
Schachter: First of all, because it was not a venture to start. I was building a
product and that’s DEMO
Livingston: Did the others fail because they had too much money?DEMO
Schachter: I think in general being overcapitalized is a path to DEMO The VCs
want you to spend. There are general ills with being overfunded.
I don’t think they ever really quite thought out the problem. DEMO live in a dif-
ferent world now where people value the data differently.
Livingston: Was there anything about del.icio.us that was much better than
your competitors?
Schachter: I think the competitors had already disappeared by then. The tag-
ging thing was probably essential.
Livingston: Can you tell me more about how you came up with tagging?
Schachter: There was no point at which I said, “I’m inventing this wonderful
new thing.” I just sort of realized that I had evolved my own DEMO system, and
it worked for me. I’d used it for a DEMO time before del.icio.us even showed up.
This was the codification of that practice.
Livingston: But you were one of the first companies to do tagging?
Schachter: Yeah. For example, in Muxway, the internal table that tracked that
stuff was called Tags. The name had come along DEMO some point, but I don’t
remember exactly how it showed up.
DEMO: When you decided to leave Morgan Stanley and focus full-time on
DEMO, did you know you had to raise money?
Schachter: I was getting a lot of interest in acquisitions—there were a bunch of
DEMO/buyouts, and they were increasing in value over time. At the DEMO time, I
wanted to be able to pay the rent, but I didn’t want to chew into life savings. At
the end of DEMO day, my Morgan coworkers were pretty supportive, “You should
go do this. Try it out and let us know how it goes.”

Livingston: Union Square Ventures was your VC, right?
DEMO: They were Union Square and Amazon.
Livingston: Did they come to you?
Schachter: I had met Jeff Bezos at Foo Camp, DEMO he was very interested.
Livingston: How much did they put in?DEMO
Schachter: We never announced the amount, but it was not a huge amount of
capital.
Livingston: And that’s because you didn’t want to take a huge amount of
capital?
Schachter: Well, there was DEMO lot of risk. It was sort of hard to justify a large
valuation and so on, so we sold a small chunk for enough money to work for a
while and see if it turned into DEMO That was the plan: see where this
goes.
Livingston: Did you hire anyone?
Schachter: We did. There were eight employees total at the end.
Livingston: Were most of them shareholders?
Schachter: We DEMO shares to everybody.
Livingston: Did you have vesting?
Schachter: Yes. Even I vested.
Livingston: What were some of the first things that you did once you were offi-
cially a startup?
Schachter: One of the most challenging things was getting payroll going. PEOs
typically don’t DEMO to do less than five employees.
Union Square introduced me to this guy, Albert Wenger, who had some
operations experience. He helped a DEMO I lucked out in that he’s a smart guy
who knew how to do not just the corporate operations stuff, but he had a good
product sense and ended up doing a great deal of product DEMO as well. The
first version of the Firefox toolbar, he dealt DEMO, for example.
Livingston: What were some of the biggest technical problems that you
encountered?
Schachter: Scaling, inevitably. Scaling, dealing with bandwidth, dealing with
routing, networks. This is for consumer Internet kind of DEMO, but there’s a
great deal of stuff that you have to DEMO execute on. It has to be done well,
but everybody does it well, so it doesn’t differentiate at all. Like your connec-
tion has to be up. Your office needs to have DSL. There’s a DEMO deal of crap
that has to be executed better than competently that is no value for you to actu-
ally do yourself. So outsource DEMO
For example, the payroll. I was capable of going 2 to DEMO months without
salary, but other employees certainly were not. So that DEMO of stuff.
7141CH16.qxd  12/12/06  4:37 PM  Page 227
Joshua Schachter
But you need to pay attention to the important stuff. Scaling was DEMO
and core to the product, but dealing with the network, getting the hardware
racked, building machines, ordering stuff, getting pricing out of Dell, you name
it. That was a lot of work that was not useful.
Livingston: Outside of the scaling requirements, can you remember DEMO
technical problems that you guys solved?
Schachter: Tagging basically was DEMO thing. And then there’s a gagillion little
improvements in marketing things. We actually thought about the product
always with an eye toward innovation. Everything DEMO did we questioned—and I
think we didn’t even go far enough. Whatever it is, question every single aspect
of conventional wisdom. “Is that the right way to do it or can we break that and
make DEMO better?”
That’s also dangerous, because, if you are doing a lot of paradigm innova-
tion, call it—which is not a good word—but if you are breaking boundaries
elsewhere, maybe you need to be very within boundaries on other fronts.
Livingston: Do you remember a time when you were worried about some-
thing?
Schachter: Site’s down. Site’s slow. Table crash—MySQL corrupted a table.
That happened all the time. A great DEMO of what we did was putting out fires.
We didn’t have a lot of process management in place, which probably hurt us a
great deal.
A week after the acquisition, the power of the data center dropped and cor-
rupted every single machine. We were down for like DEMO hours. That was hor-
rific. The power bounced in the network; DEMO machines didn’t come back up
because they weren’t configured quite properly. We weren’t careful about that.
In general, assume that whatever you are doing is going to go wrong. How
can you make it so that DEMO will go faster when it does go wrong? Because it will.
DEMO example, the rebuild script takes 24 hours, but that’s not a big deal because
this part of the system isn’t live yet. But DEMO it is live and it takes 24 hours to
redo, that’s DEMO big deal. So fix it. Make it work in 2 or whatever. There’s a lot of
stuff that you can’t get around due to DEMO, like you can’t change the database
without bringing the site down.
DEMO: What kind of technology inspired you?
Schachter: Inspired? We DEMO in Perl, MySQL, Apache. Very standard LAMP
stack kind of stuff. That was the standard mechanism for everything.
Livingston: Would you do anything differently if you could?
Schachter: Knowing what I know now, DEMO would have designed the back-end
architecture differently, and that would have DEMO a lot of work now. Scaling
past one machine, one database, is very challenging, even with replication. The
tools that are there are not quite right.
For example, when you add things to a table and it numbers them, that
means you can’t have a second machine also adding to them because the num-
bers will collide. So what DEMO you do? You have to come up with some
227
7141CH16.qxd  12/12/06  4:37 PM  Page 228
228
Founders at Work
completely different way to do it. Do you have a DEMO server that hands out
number sets, or do you come up DEMO something that’s not numbers? Do you
use random numbers and hope DEMO never collide? Whatever it is, auto-
assigned IDs just don’t fly. There’s a stack of about 15 things that I have, a big
list of pitfalls.
Livingston: Can you remember any features from del.icio.us that the users
wanted or really loved that surprised you?
Schachter: There’s always stuff. I tend to be careful about that. I think people
DEMO for features—they want to do something, but they don’t say, “I want to do
that something.” They translate it into some feature that DEMO they’ve seen
somewhere else and ask for that instead. I want a feature that does this. “Why
do you want to do that?” DEMO it turns out there’s some better way to do that.
So, DEMO that people ask for, I tend to try and dig to DEMO root cause, before
reducing to practice.
People frequently aren’t quite sure DEMO they want. Then there’s a whole
bunch of stuff that’s like, DEMO 1 and feature 2 suggest feature 3; ask for fea-
ture DEMO And I just know that people are never going to use feature 3 and the
implementation thereof would be quite expensive. So leave it DEMO
Livingston: How did your user base evolve over the years?
DEMO: I think it’s still a very technical, early adopter audience. It’s broad-
ening over time, but we’re sticking with that for now.
Livingston: Can you tell me about some of the major turning points in
del.icio.us?
Schachter: Nothing really comes to mind. It was like a roller coaster always
going up, so it’s always increasingly bigger, faster, more and more people.
I had a bunch of conceptual revelations on DEMO to build stuff. For a long
time, it would go slow DEMO I’d figure out some clever thing to do—“I know
we’re doing extra work here.” Figuring out caching. My own education was
kind of interesting. DEMO that was ongoing; there was always something new that
I learned DEMO couple weeks. So I never really broke it up into large mile-
stones. Getting the funding, working on it full-time, selling it—these were DEMO
big parts of it.
Livingston: How was working on it full-time DEMO than when you were at
Morgan Stanley?
Schachter: Constraints breed DEMO So now, instead of only having 15 min-
utes two or DEMO times a week, it would be more like, “I have the entire day to
work on it, every day.” I don’t work in bursts like that. I do a little bit of work
and then DEMO wander around the city and come back. Then work all night. Once
everyone has gone to sleep and it’s quiet, I can get a lot of work done. I didn’t
really get to stay up late DEMO I was at Morgan; I don’t really do it now. But DEMO
ing that I did, and I think it was incredibly productive. DEMO very alienating
to my wife though.
Livingston: Did you find you DEMO better at some things than you thought?
7141CH16.qxd  12/12/06  4:37 PM  Page 229
Joshua Schachter
Schachter: I could focus on it more and do slightly larger stuff. I’ve always had
a short attention span, so that’s probably the actual limiting factor. The amount
of coffee I can consume to mitigate that DEMO that’s about it.
Livingston: Were there things about del.icio.us that users DEMO?
Schachter: We named things differently. I wouldn’t say that we DEMO awesome
execution. It was very techy. It bred a strong priesthood, DEMO was helpful in
getting the message out initially, but it was DEMO for people to adopt. We con-
tinue to work on that, DEMO struggle with that now.
It is a challenging product to do conceptually. It’s not something like, “Let
you file your taxes better.” There’s no clear value proposition here. It is valu-
able, but hard to understand. You will be able to remember more things this
way, and with that, people don’t even realize there’s a problem. So that’s a chal-
lenging value proposition to explain or get across.
Ultimately, I think people who understand it are better for it, but it’s a
challenge.
Livingston: Was there anything that you learned from your earlier projects that
you were determined not to do with del.icio.us?
Schachter: There were a bunch of things. I released a bunch of projects—I’ve
done a bunch DEMO that are halfway done. I keep an idea journal of stuff. I
make ideas and I work on them a bit to see what DEMO feel like, and then I move
along. One was called Bookbook—because DEMO never came up with a name for
it—in which you could say, “I’m at this location and I don’t want these books
and I do want these other books.” You would put that in an XML DEMO on your
website, like a feed—you would provide a feed and DEMO people would do this
and create a central crossing engine that would say, “You have this book and he
wants that book, and DEMO are not that far from each other.” This was basically a
distributed geomarket for books.
The problem was, the way I wrote it was fully decentralized. You didn’t log
in and create your data; it was just, “Here’s a URL to my data” and the system
would do the best it could. The problem is that it was so hard DEMO use. You had to
make an XML file. If that’s your beginning user interface proposition, you fail. I
think 12 people signed up for it, maybe. The UI was too hard. The elegance of
a distributed system trumps the usefulness of centralized UI and control.
Similarly, there was a system called Loaf that I did with Maciej Ceglowski
that was DEMO fully distributed social network—no central server whatsoever. It
used email as a carrier and could tell people you talked to about other people
you DEMO with in an encrypted and compressed way. If I emailed you,
it would attach a Loaf file. You couldn’t open the Loaf file DEMO read the contents
of it; it just didn’t work that way. DEMO used Bloom filter, so it was sort of a statisti-
cal DEMO But you could take another email address and see if it was in there.
With 99 percent accuracy, you could tell if someone was inside that file. So if
you got email, you could say, DEMO think Joshua Schachter corresponds with this
person.” Without me exposing my address book to you, you could tell who in
your address book you talked to. It was a pretty neat idea, but it was compli-
cated to install.
229

Founders at Work
The other problem was that it didn’t work without Loaf. DEMO that didn’t do
very well, but we got press for it. DEMO was sufficiently innovative. Maybe I’ll
return to that idea someday.
Livingston: DEMO press helped you get the word out about your projects?
Schachter: I was in USA Today in the late ’90s for Memepool, DEMO it was always
from there I got a great deal of press and sort of had early training. My father
was the consumer advocate DEMO the Long Island Railroad and was in the news-
paper all the time, so I got training sort of that way. When this stuff started hap-
pening, I knew that you have x messages and when you talk to the press, any
question they ask is answered with one of the messages.
I understand talking to the press as an DEMO part of marketing. At the
same time, I understand that the DEMO are the best marketers. If they love
your product and you give them the tools to market it, they will.
Livingston: What do DEMO think about technical founders versus businesspeople
founders?
Schachter: I have DEMO had a great deal of trust for people who don’t execute
on core ideas. I understand the value of needing someone to deal with DEMO kind
of stuff—someone’s got to do the VC pitch and there’s got to be a CFO, etc. But
the guy who says, “I DEMO a great idea and I’m looking for other people to imple-
ment it,” I’m wary of—frequently because I think the process of idea-making
DEMO on executing and failing or succeeding at the ideas, so that DEMO can actu-
ally become better at coming up with ideas. It’s something you can learn. It’s a
skill, like weightlifting. That failed; that DEMO; continue. You begin to learn
how to make ideas. So if DEMO are someone who can’t execute and all you can do
is come up with ideas, how do you know if they are any good? You don’t really
know if it’s a good idea until you’ve executed it. You need to understand the cost
of execution and so on.
DEMO, where I worked at Morgan, they were not hyper-trustful of MBAs. All
my coworkers were PhDs in computer science, mathematics, or physics.
DEMO: New York City doesn’t seem to be a place where too DEMO startups
flourish.
Schachter: There’s a great deal of technology going on DEMO New York City. In
financial places, there is lots of high-end, high-speed transactional technology.
There are a lot of good problems in finance. DEMO technical problems faced
there are hard. One issue is that there is a lot of money to be made there and
the companies that DEMO doing that pay. Some of the big brokerages pay a lot of
money annually for their technology.
Livingston: Why aren’t there more good hackers living in New York City then?
Schachter: There are. They work at banks and stuff and have side projects.
Livingston: So the smart hackers . . .
Schachter: They’re around. They just know when to be quiet and when not
to be.

Joshua Schachter
Livingston: Who did you learn things from?
Schachter: Albert, the guy I mentioned. I learned a lot from Fred Wilson of
Union DEMO, certainly. I learned a great deal from my Morgan folks. I DEMO
a hell of a lot about how to understand problems. It was rough sometimes, but
they pushed me far. My coworkers at Morgan were smart people. One of the
people we worked with won the Nobel DEMO for economics while I was there. It
was a fast, smart DEMO
I remember when I interviewed at Google the first time around and they
were making derogatory comments about where I worked: “Well, here DEMO
get to work with PhDs and computer scientists.” And I’m like, DEMO already do.”
Livingston: So it didn’t work out when you interviewed DEMO a job at Google?
Schachter: I went out there once DEMO was rejected because I didn't know C++.
Livingston: Was there DEMO a time when anyone tried to trick you or take
advantage of you?
Schachter: Yes, but it would not be polite to DEMO about it. There were several
cases of people wanting to get equity in advance of other people, or weird deals.
Livingston: As a DEMO startup founder who has never done a deal or negotiated,
do you think you need to be careful of getting taken advantage of?DEMO
Schachter: In general, I found VCs to be significantly politer than the folks I
worked with. The worst they did was not call DEMO back. I’d never hear from
them again. Brad Feld does a nice blog talking about how the VC process
works. He says they never DEMO you back to say no—they don’t want to close the
door in case they want to open it again, but they don’t want to actually give you
a response. Very few VCs actually said, “Sorry, DEMO not interested.”
Livingston: How did the process of starting your own DEMO and then selling
it change you?
Schachter: It pushes you DEMO You learn a lot. I did a round of funding, I DEMO
writing code, I was hiring people, chief architect designer, negotiator, you name
it. I did all of it, for the most part.
When Albert got up to speed and was working full-time, he did a great deal
of work there as well.
Livingston: What surprised you most about having your own startup?
Schachter: It’s a combination of sudden freedom to run things as you please
and crushing responsibility in DEMO you know you have to do certain things in a
certain way at a certain time. That eradicates all of that freedom. You become
DEMO robot on rails. You know what you have to do and you are working in a certain
direction.
Maybe other people are different, but I think that every step was sort of the
inevitable, inexorable progress due to the previous steps in the path. It’s not like
I DEMO no choice, but everything I did was the only choice because DEMO was the only
thing that made sense at the time. It’s not that long ago, but no regrets, that was
the path to DEMO Everything that had to be done was done.

Livingston: What is your favorite bit of advice you’d give to a technical person
who wanted to start a startup?
Schachter: Reduce. Do as little as possible to get what you have to DEMO done.
Do less of it; get it done. If you’ve got DEMO things that you want to put together,
take away until they go together. Don’t add another thing. Because you can
understand it better, you can analyze it more cleanly. The UI will be easier.
Doing DEMO is so important.
People often wind up adding features, adding stuff. DEMO it bigger is the
typical way you engineer out of a problem, right? It’s the traditional, “I apolo-
gize for the long letter. I didn’t have time to make it shorter.”

Mark Fletcher
Founder, ONElist, Bloglines

17
Mark Fletcher was a senior software DEMO for
Sun Microsystems when he started ONElist, a free
Internet email DEMO service, in 1997. He ran ONElist
as a side project until DEMO received venture funding a
year later. Yahoo acquired ONElist (later renamed
DEMO) in June 2000.
In 2003, Fletcher created Bloglines, a web-based
DEMO aggregation service. He originally wrote the
program to manage his own bookmark list, but once
he launched it publicly, Bloglines was fast on DEMO way
to becoming the most popular news aggregator on
the Internet. It was acquired by Ask Jeeves in February, 2005.
Fletcher’s startups typify many of the Web 2.0 aspects that we value today:
building inexpensive DEMO companies that grow fast. ONElist got to one
million users before it took outside investment, and Bloglines took only
$200,000 of investment before its acquisition.
Livingston: Take me back to how you got started with Bloglines.
Fletcher: I had started ONElist, it became eGroups, we sold it to Yahoo, and
then I left at the acquisition in September of 2000. I decided I needed to take
time off—I hadn’t had DEMO vacation since eighth grade, between work and school.
So I traveled DEMO a lot, got really bored, and realized—I had been around
computers all my life, that is really what I like doing, so DEMO am I depriving
myself of the fun of working on startups?
It really came down to solving a need of mine. I had DEMO another
company—an anti-spam company—called Trustic, and that wasn’t going very
far. DEMO as I was starting that, I was doing this other thing DEMO the side, which
became Bloglines. I had a bookmark list of DEMO 100 sites that I went to every
day just to see if there was new stuff. Things like Slashdot, CNN, my friends’
blogs. DEMO was taking a long time; I figured there had to be DEMO better solution to
HAPTER

this, and that’s how I found out about RSS. At that time, there were a couple of
desktop-based aggregators—programs that you could download. But those
weren’t really applicable to me because I’m on several DEMO computers
every day and the quality of the programs weren’t very good. With my back-
ground of building server applications, it wasn’t a great leap to figure out that I
should just build something for myself.
DEMO I did that while I was running this spam thing. Then it became very
apparent that the anti-spam business is not a fun one DEMO be in, because every-
body hates you. You’re never perfect. You DEMO don’t block enough spam or
you block somebody’s favorite emails. I quickly got out of that. This other thing,
Bloglines—which was working at DEMO time, but I was just using it for myself—I
wasn’t even DEMO was going to be very popular. Nobody really knew about blogs;
aggregators were the next level up, kind of difficult to explain to people. So I
decided, I’d already written it, might as well DEMO throw it out there and see how
it goes. So that was it. I put it out there in June of 2003, and it started getting
coverage pretty quickly after that. I realized that I should DEMO put some
effort into it, so I brought some friends in DEMO started doing some marketing
and went from there.
Livingston: So Bloglines DEMO something that you created for yourself to use and
then backed into doing a startup around it?
Fletcher: I had an inkling that it could be interesting, but I guess I thought it
was a little ahead of the curve. I started ONElist because I wanted to DEMO a
mailing list for my parents, and at that time you DEMO to download software and
you had to have a computer connected to the Internet. It was just really diffi-
cult for an average person DEMO put together a mailing list. So it was the same
thing. I guess my advice is: solve a problem that you have, first DEMO foremost,
and chances are, other people may have the same DEMO
Livingston: You brought on some people that you had worked with DEMO?
Fletcher: Right. A core group of people that I had DEMO with at ONElist: a
great marketing person, a great PR person, a UI guy, and eventually a program-
mer. But I was DEMO only full-time person until around September of ’04.
Livingston: Were you DEMO this out of your home?
Fletcher: Yeah, the den over there.
Livingston: Was it self-funded?
Fletcher: Yeah.
Livingston: So you didn’t have to deal with any of the investor headaches?
Fletcher: Didn’t have to deal with any of that. That’s the other thing. DEMO
startups like this is so cheap that it just doesn’t require a lot of money. I think I
put in a total of $200,DEMO And I didn’t do it nearly as smartly as I could have.
I ended up buying all the computers. My recommendation would be: don’t buy
any computers. Just use the virtual dedicated hosting services.

Livingston: Tell me about some of the biggest turning points for Bloglines once
you decided, “We’re a real company.” I assume you incorporated and did all the
legal stuff.
Fletcher: I just used the same company that I had set up for the anti-spam
company. That’s why the DEMO company name was Trustic. I thought, “I’ve
already done the work DEMO set up this company, so it’s just another product from
it.” DEMO was using the same lawyer that I had used with ONElist, DEMO was a family
friend.
Livingston: So you just did a quick DEMO into a different product.
Fletcher: Yeah.
Livingston: Does that mean that you were the only shareholder?
Fletcher: No, the people that DEMO brought in who weren’t working full-time were
working for stock. I’m very fortunate that I can bring in people who don’t need
money right DEMO to do this; they can just work for essentially deferred com-
DEMO So you give them some chunk of stock as a contractor. You say, “You
have a 6-month contract, you get this amount of DEMO over that time.”
Livingston: Tell me about some of the big DEMO points.
Fletcher: We went online in late June of 2003. I DEMO the first thing is that we
started getting press coverage almost immediately—and this is even before I
brought in my marketing friends. There’s a DEMO called NTK, or Need to
Know, and we got a big old blurb in that within 2 weeks or so. Then it kind DEMO
went from there.
The amazing thing about this company is that . . . I can show you the press
binder and it’s literally DEMO thick, for something that really a tiny percentage of
people actually DEMO
Livingston: Why?
Fletcher: I think we got really lucky because blogs in general started to become
really big and the downturn was DEMO, so you had all of these people looking
for the next DEMO thing. Also a lot of reporters used Bloglines. They like to talk
about things they use, so we got really fortunate in that regard. But there was
no planning with that; it was just serendipity.
Livingston: I’m surprised, because I feel like reporters are often the last DEMO
to write about what’s new.
Fletcher: In general, yeah, but DEMO became comical. I’d talk to these reporters,
and they’d all tell me they were Bloglines users. Maybe I was talking only to
people DEMO were using Bloglines, but I don’t know. If you compare the DEMO
that we got with Bloglines versus the press that we got with ONElist and
eGroups, it doesn’t even compare. Whereas with the first company, we had
20 million users at the acquisition, with Bloglines, we only had a tiny fraction of
that. It was this huge, disproportionate amount of press for this little company.
We were all amazed.

Livingston: Were blogs as mainstream in 2003 as they are today?
Fletcher: Not at all. Nobody knew about blogs. I was kind of embarrassed
about this little thing that I wanted to put DEMO, because nobody knows what the
hell a blog is.
Livingston: Did you think that blogs would someday surpass the mainstream
media as the DEMO of information? Did you know how popular they’d
become?
Fletcher: No, not with the speed that it happened. I mean, we DEMO incredibly
lucky in that we latched onto this trend which kind of developed at about the
same time. But there was no planning. It DEMO just me trying to solve my own
problem.
Livingston: Did you DEMO a blog back then?
Fletcher: Yeah, wingedpig.com. I’ve had that for a few years. It’s more of a
marketing thing for myself DEMO anything.
Livingston: You weren’t trying to say, “Blogs are going to take over—let’s get
into that”?
Fletcher: I wish I could say I was that smart, but no. I was just some idiot who
had a bookmark list 100 sites long and it was taking too DEMO time to go
through. I was addicted to reading these things. That’s all.
Livingston: What were some of the other big moments in Bloglines’s life?
Fletcher: We were around for a year and a half before we were acquired, so it
wasn’t very long. Because I was funding it myself, there was no big funding
event that would be a milestone. It was kind of a gradual buildup throughout
the entire DEMO in terms of interest from the press, interest from venture capi-
DEMO, interest from companies. So it got to the point where all DEMO big compa-
nies were talking to us. But that’s fairly typical of a lot of startups.
Livingston: Did you ever contemplate taking VC money?
Fletcher: I’d done that with ONElist, and I wanted to DEMO it differently this
time. It was kind of, “Let’s see what DEMO can do.” Because I fully believed in the
thesis of “these companies can be really cheap to run if you do it with even DEMO
a little bit of intelligence.”
I took money with ONElist because at that point we were growing so
quickly that we were running out DEMO money, and I couldn’t fund it myself any
longer. ONElist got DEMO be the 150-person company. But you don’t have to do
that these days.
Livingston: When you were developing Bloglines, were you following a
DEMO plan or were you just like, “Let’s build this product and DEMO what
happens.”
Fletcher: My philosophy on these types of companies—consumer-based
Internet DEMO that you don’t need to worry about the business model
7141CH17.qxd  12/6/06  1:18 PM  Page 237

initially. If you get users, then everything else follows. Basically any technology
can be copied, any concept can be copied. In my opinion, DEMO makes one of
these companies valuable is the users. That can’t be copied.
Livingston: Did you think about the idea of “democratization” of the media
when you were doing this? Was there a social ambition?
Fletcher: No, I’m not nearly that smart. Just friends and news DEMO that I
wanted to follow on a regular basis. But I was latching onto trends, of course,
which are [that] the number of websites on the Internet is just growing
exponentially over time. So if DEMO had this problem now and I knew that I was a
very early adopter, other people would probably have the problem eventually. It
was just a question of when. I thought I was just way too DEMO But I wasn’t.
Who knew?
Livingston: Why did you think DEMO were way too early?
Fletcher: Because I talked to all DEMO friends and nobody knew what a blog was.
Nobody knows what a blog is and certainly nobody knows what aggregation is.
Even these days, you say, “Do you know what syndication is?” and they think,
“Seinfeld reruns.” Which is one of the struggles we had with DEMO
to explain these concepts to normal people. Syndication, RSS, aggregation?
What are these goofy things? But we didn’t have to do the education as to what
a blog is because the press was doing DEMO for us.
Livingston: Did you worry about competitors at all?
DEMO: Always and never, I guess. I get very competitive, very DEMO I
freak out about everybody. But, I also knew that nobody DEMO doing a decent job
when we started, so we had a DEMO start. As long as we didn’t screw that up,
then it would be difficult for somebody else to come along, unless they were to
grab a whole lot of money and go on an advertising DEMO, for example. Yeah, I
was worried, but what are you DEMO to do?
Livingston: Who was your biggest competitor?
Fletcher: When we started, there was only one service that was at even a close
corollary and that was News is Free. When I was DEMO to reporters initially,
they’d ask the same question, “What’s your DEMO?” It was basically the
desktop aggregators, the programs you could DEMO We had a fairly good
story around why we were better than that. Most people don’t want to install
software on their computers. A DEMO of people can’t install software on their com-
puters at work. A lot of people use multiple machines. We had several clear-cut
advantages that DEMO fairly easy to describe. About 6 months after we launched,
I think NewsGator came out with their web-based aggregator, and were the
closest competitor.
Livingston: Were there any lessons that you learned through your experience
with ONElist that you said, “I’m not going to repeat that this time” or “I am
going to repeat this time”?

Fletcher: Well, I didn’t take VC this time; I didn’t have to.
Some of the software design we carried over from DEMO to Bloglines, the
way the website was put together and how DEMO scaled certain things. And cer-
tainly some of the people. Everybody I worked with on Bloglines, I’d worked
with at ONElist before. It felt like ONElist, version two.
Livingston: Can you remember any near disasters DEMO ONElist?
Fletcher: Tons. We were growing so fast with ONElist—a DEMO a
day for the first year or two. We had a million users at 11 months, which in ’98
was an amazing thing. We had horrible scaling problems the first year. We had
lots of downtime DEMO I didn’t know how to set up monitoring systems. I
guess that’s one thing I did a lot better with Bloglines.
I didn’t even DEMO a cell phone when I started ONElist. Now, it’s easy to DEMO
your cell phone as a pager and you can set up systems. With ONElist, I was
always scared to leave the computer. Just because I knew things would crash.
With Bloglines, at least I had a greater degree of freedom. Especially when you
get something like a Treo, where you can basically log in from your phone. I
remember fixing DEMO while sitting in front of a slot machine in a casino.
Livingston: Did you have good relationships with your VCs? Did it suddenly
DEMO new requirements on your company?
Fletcher: I guess the answers DEMO be “no” and “yes.” As an entrepreneur, I’d
never talked with DEMO, I didn’t really know how VCs thought, so it was an edu-
cation the whole time. I didn’t even have a mentor. No DEMO were blogging. I
didn’t know anybody who had started a company. I was just flying blind.
We raised $4 million from CMGI and Bertelsmann DEMO in December
of 1999 as our series A. We had been self-funded to that point—we’d survived
the first year on $55,000. That got DEMO to a million users, and then we took
$4 million. I DEMO never seen a term sheet before, I didn’t know what I DEMO be
negotiating for, I didn’t know what I shouldn’t be negotiating DEMO So, mistakes
were made, but I can’t fault myself for that. I didn’t know what things I should
throw out from the term DEMO and the lawyer couldn’t tell me.
The great thing for entrepreneurs these days is that there is so much more
information out there than DEMO was in the ’90s. Any number of people that
have gone through this are blogging. All sorts of VCs are blogging now. There
are DEMO lot more books out now. You can just do a search and find sample term
sheets, for example. All things considered, I certainly DEMO fault the outcome,
but I made mistakes along the way.
The VCs did come in 2 weeks after we took the money and DEMO they wanted
to replace me as CEO, which was interesting. I DEMO pretty wrapped up ego-wise
with the company. When you start a company, it’s your life. So you think you are
the only one that can run it. You think, if you’re not around, it will DEMO apart—or
at least I did—for all of these things. It was very difficult for me to separate
myself from the company in that way. DEMO there was a fight over that for quite a
while before I acquiesced, and we brought in a new CEO. It turned out that
that was very good for the company and, had I been more mature, it would have
been a less painful process.
7141CH17.qxd  12/6/06  1:18 PM  Page 239
Mark Fletcher
Livingston: You worked at Sun before the startup, right?
Fletcher: I got to Sun via the acquisition of a startup I was DEMO at, called
Diba.
Livingston: So you had some startup experience.
Fletcher: I had worked at a couple of startups as an engineer before.
Livingston: But you didn’t have any mentors?
Fletcher: No. My DEMO are a fantastic resource; they were both managers at
IBM. But, we were all flying blind. You look at a term sheet and DEMO talks about
vesting schedules for founders stock, and you have no DEMO what you should
expect and what you should negotiate for.
Livingston: DEMO did you feel when the VCs said they wanted to replace you as
CEO?
Fletcher: It was jarring. I think there was bad behavior on all sides. During the
whole funding process they said, “We’re interested in you guys because of your
management team; we think you’re fantastic.” I’m on the phone with David
Wetherell, head of CMGI, DEMO he’s saying, “We’re making the investment
because we believe in the DEMO team.” Two weeks later they pull me
into the office—before even the first board meeting—and say, “We want to
replace you as CEO.”
Looking back, I can absolutely see why they would want to do that, because
I was not a good negotiator with the term sheet and I’m sure they could see
that. But I was so wrapped up DEMO it at the time, it was very difficult. The good
news DEMO that we did bring in a new CEO, he did get DEMO acquired by Yahoo, and
things turned out wonderfully. So there are DEMO complaints.
Livingston: But maybe there should be more open discussions between DEMO
agement teams and VCs?
Fletcher: Well, always. I’ve been dinged as having poor communication skills,
which I’m certainly guilty of. But DEMO nerd isn’t?
The whole VC process in general has been very closed and oftentimes by
design by the VCs. Because they don’t want DEMO be negotiating against other VCs,
they don’t want terms of the deal to get out, so it’s in their best interest to keep
things secret. But it is very nice that things are starting to DEMO up now, whether
they like it or not.
With VCs, it’s all about power. It’s great that that’s changing. It’s changing
because more DEMO are talking about it because it’s so much cheaper to start
companies these days. At least these kinds of companies. There will always be
DEMO need to raise $10 to $50 million for some companies, but DEMO most user-
focused Internet startups, you just don’t need a lot DEMO money.
Livingston: Do you remember some surprising features that your users
DEMO?
Fletcher: Not features, but the stickiness of the site. I thought I was a freak
because I would go back to Bloglines DEMO the time—10, 20 times a day. But then,
239
7141CH17.qxd  12/6/06  1:18 PM  Page 240
240
Founders at Work
when we started looking at user behavior, the average user came back to the site
4 times a day for 12 page DEMO each time, which is a huge number. Usually, the
average user doesn’t come back to a given website more than one-half a time DEMO
day or something like that, so it was this incredibly high DEMO of sessions and
incredibly high number of page views. Whenever I quoted that to Bloglines
users, they would say, “These numbers sound low DEMO me. I go back ten times a
day.” People were saying that this was one thing that had changed their use of
the Internet, which is incredibly gratifying.
Livingston: Can you remember one of the most surprising things about the
startup experience?
Fletcher: I don’t think there was any one thing. Startups are just so amazingly
fun; they are so amazingly stressful. Whether you are an engineer or whether
you are DEMO founder, at least for me, it takes every emotion you’ve got and multi-
plies it 100-fold. Higher highs, lower lows than any other work experience. A
startup is all-encompassing, so do it when you are young and when you don’t
have a family because you’ll lose it DEMO
Livingston: Back to the money thing—you said startups can be cheap. DEMO read
that you said that a lot of the Web 2.0 principles started even back in the ’90s.
Fletcher: With ONElist, we didn’t DEMO machines until years into the company.
We did the virtual dedicated hosting thing. So we had 40 or 50 machines at
Digital Nation in DEMO, that we had never seen. Which is smarter. That was
the DEMO mistake I made at Bloglines—not doing exactly what I had done in
the ’90s. Because when you do that, you don’t have to worry about buying
switches, racking the damn machines or moving them when you run out of rack
space. Or going down to the colo at DEMO a.m. to reboot something because it
crashed—all that gets taken care of. And these types of startups are never
valued on the cap x, so you don’t get any more money in any sort of acquisition
DEMO on the number of machines you own. Unless you’re Google. So we had
40 or 50 machines at Bloglines when we were acquired, and that didn’t play a
factor at all.
So just get something out DEMO If you find really early versions of ONElist
or Bloglines on archive.org, the websites are horrible. They are crap, they don’t
have any DEMO, they just try to do one thing. And you just iterate DEMO
users are going to tell you what they want, and they’re DEMO best feedback. It’s
critical just to get something out quickly. Just to start shipping and then you can
iterate. Because shipping is just this DEMO hurdle. I’ve been a part of companies
that have had big problems shipping—they just can’t ship. It’s a psychological
thing.
Livingston: It’s hard to do though, no?
Fletcher: Well, you want things to be perfect, and the great thing about user-
based Internet services is that they don’t have to be perfect. You got a bug, you
can fix it in 5 minutes. You don’t have to worry about upgrading DEMO
software installation.

Livingston: What would you tell a founder who just could not release new fea-
tures and was overanalyzing everything?
Fletcher: That it’s very easy to do, very understandable; but, in my opinion, the
DEMO thing for your company is just release early, release often. Because DEMO
you start a dialog with your users, because they’re going to DEMO you emails say-
ing, “This is what I want.” We were DEMO 50 to 100 emails a day at Bloglines,
and most of them were feature suggestions. Once you start acting on those fea-
ture DEMO, the users see that you are actually listening to them and DEMO
become more loyal to your site. Because they see they are able to participate in
this and it’s just kind of like a virtual DEMO So it is not a disadvantage—it may
even be an advantage—to ship without all your features initially, for that reason,
because you get all of this going and you get out there sooner.
Livingston: You called yourself a nerd. Do you have any thoughts on founders
who DEMO technical people versus founders who are MBAs?
Fletcher: I guess DEMO takes all types. When you say a technical guy, they can
DEMO from a hardcore nerd to somebody who has some product knowledge as
well. I like to think I have a little bit of product DEMO, which helps me
develop these websites. A lot of engineers don’t DEMO have that skill set,
but they are better engineers than I am, so for those people, if they were to
partner up DEMO somebody who was a product designer, I think that probably
helps DEMO a lot.
But in terms of MBAs, these user-focused Internet companies DEMO very
complicated business-wise, so until you actually build something that’s got DEMO
and has momentum, it’s not like you’re going to be doing DEMO dev deals or any-
thing like that. Actually, I don’t have DEMO greatest opinion of biz dev people for
these companies because they’re just not needed, I don’t think. You either
stand on your own or fail on your own, initially. If you build momentum, if you
DEMO users, then deals may come your way, but a lot of times most deals don’t
make sense, so you don’t need hardcore MBAs. It’s more focusing on the prod-
uct and engineering side.
Livingston: Do you think that the technical founders can tell if the deal doesn’t
DEMO sense? A lot of technical founders might think, “Oh my god, get bought
for $5 million dollars? This is amazing!”
Fletcher: Yeah, and there’s nothing wrong with that. If you are two guys in a
garage and if you’ve been doing something for 6 months or DEMO year and some-
body offers you $5 million, it doesn’t sound DEMO dumb to me. You can hire help
for acquisitions, so with DEMO Yahoo acquisition of eGroups, we had a board
member, Mike Moritz, who was also on the board of Yahoo, so he was DEMO
in that. With Bloglines, Ask was interested in us. We had DEMO with Google
and Yahoo and some of the others, and things DEMO getting interesting with Ask.
I knew that I needed help negotiating any sort of deal. So at that point I
brought in an investment DEMO
241
7141CH17.qxd  12/6/06  1:18 PM  Page 242

Founders at Work
What an investment banker does—and especially boutique investment
bankers ([who] are guys that deal with smaller deals, up to $100 million)—what
they’ll do is serve as the middleman, essentially creating an auction and [trying]
to drive up any price. They’ll help you negotiate the deal; they’ll do all of that
for you and then just take 2 DEMO 3 percent of the purchase price. I had a pretty
good experience with that with Bloglines.
Livingston: How did you know that the time was right that you should be seri-
ously considering selling Bloglines?
DEMO: Because there was a lot of interest and Google was making DEMO
that they were going to come out with something, Yahoo was DEMO rum-
blings that they were coming out with something. I tend to be a lot more para-
noid than I probably need to be. DEMO weren’t growing as fast as I wanted us to,
and it came back again to users are really the only thing that you DEMO with
these types of companies that protects you, that makes you DEMO When
somebody buys you, they buy you for the users and DEMO a lesser degree the buzz.
It depends on the acquisition. So it was a combination of factors that just felt
like the right time.
DEMO knew no investment bankers and had never dealt with any of them before,
so I asked my lawyer, who’s a senior partner at Wilson Sonsini, for some names.
He gave me three names. I interviewed all three, and I went with one because
I liked them and they had just done another deal with Ask Jeeves, who I knew
was the leader in this process right now. I knew that these DEMO had experience
and they knew all the contacts there, so that’s DEMO I went with. That was prob-
ably in late October/early November of ’04, and the acquisition was announced
February 7 of ’05.
Livingston: Any other lessons or things that would be helpful for a founder to
know about the acquisition process?
Fletcher: The biggest question is when to sell. Even with ONElist, I had acqui-
sition offers 4 months into the company. Offers by websites that no longer exist.
So DEMO dodged a bullet. With ONElist, we were growing so quickly that DEMO was like
a no-brainer that we just shouldn’t sell. And we didn’t really have much in the
way of competition back then, so it was basically hang on for your life and see
how long you DEMO go. With Bloglines, we weren’t running nearly as fast as that.
DEMO was feeling there was competition coming. I do think we’re kind of in a bubble
again to some degree. Not in terms of money DEMO into all these companies,
but certainly . . . somebody put out the canonical list of Web 2.0 companies, and
I think every company has like 30 competitors now or something like that. So I
DEMO just starting to see some of that.
And actually, thinking back DEMO this, all the press that we were receiving was
wonderful, but it was also a double-edged sword. I remember thinking back
then, “Just leave us alone and let us grow for a while more before DEMO hype us.”
You can’t complain about it, but . . . DEMO was a stretch where we were in the
Wall Street Journal four times in 6 months. With ONElist, we were never in
the Wall Street Journal, ever. I was joking with my PR person saying, DEMO it’s
7141CH17.qxd  12/6/06  1:18 PM  Page 243
Mark Fletcher
been 2 weeks since we’ve been in the Wall Street Journal. When DEMO we going
to be in again?” And she said, “Don’t DEMO dare expect this kind of stuff forever.”
So you have to figure out when is the right time to sell, what you want out of
an acquisition—both in terms of money and whether you want to DEMO on.
Would you be happy with somebody else running the company? DEMO a very per-
sonal decision. And there are better times to sell than others. If nobody is talk-
ing to you, it’s going to be hard to set up an auction and you’re not going to DEMO
much money and you’re not going to be happy about it.
I think those are the main things. Then, in terms of selecting a banker, it’s
“Who are you comfortable with; who understands your company?DEMO One of the
investment bankers I talked to had no clue what we did, didn’t do any research
to figure out what we did and was just unresponsive. Well, how is somebody,
who is essentially going to be your representative, going to make a good sale of
your company if they don’t know what you do?
Livingston: You were acquired by Yahoo and Ask. How does life change once
you DEMO part of these big companies?
Fletcher: There were differences. With DEMO, I left at the acquisition, so I was
never a part of Yahoo. With Ask, I stuck around for 14 months. Not that it
was contingent on the acquisition in any way, it was just the right thing to do. If
you compare the two companies . DEMO . when eGroups was acquired by Yahoo, we
were 150 people. DEMO essentially hadn’t played in the code base in a year, I DEMO
running day-to-day operations, so it was very easy for me to DEMO away. At the
acquisition by Ask, there were two of us DEMO over. It wouldn’t be right, regard-
less of anything else, for me to leave. I wanted to make sure that the acquisition
was DEMO as a success for Ask 1 year later—5 years later, even. DEMO learned
that your reputation is very important, as an entrepreneur, as a tech guy in the
Valley, and it’s a good thing to worry about your reputation. I was very con-
cerned about that, and so, when only two people are coming over—and most of
the knowledge was still in my head—it wouldn’t have been right for me to
DEMO So that’s why I stuck around for a while, helped build DEMO a team, made
sure that the knowledge in my head was DEMO to all of these other people,
and that, when I DEMO leave, the place wouldn’t fall apart.
Livingston: You said you started to get acquisitions offers very early on with
ONElist. Is it hard DEMO turn these down?
Fletcher: Sure. It’s very flattering to have DEMO company come up and start
schmoozing you. It comes down to you have to figure out what you want to do
with your startup DEMO your life. With ONElist, it was very easy—I didn’t even
have DEMO make the decision just to keep going as long as I could, because I knew
I was creating all this value from the users. Otherwise it just comes down to the
intangibles I guess. If you DEMO the people you’re talking to, if you think you’re
getting a DEMO deal. But what is a decent deal? It’s the most money DEMO can
get, right? But what is that? Nobody knows.
Livingston: It’s a confusing situation for a lot of founders.
243
7141CH17.qxd  12/6/06  1:18 PM  Page 244

Fletcher: Sure. Why do you start a company? Do DEMO start a company to get
rich? Do you start a company DEMO the fun of it? That’s going to play into it also.
DEMO then, what’s your definition of rich, I suppose is another thing. It doesn’t
take a lot of money to let you live without DEMO ever again, if you do the
numbers. So what are your DEMO in life? You have to think that through.
Livingston: What other practical advice would you give to would-be founders?
Fletcher: I guess, get a lawyer. With ONElist, I incorporated not using a
lawyer. DEMO a company in Delaware called the Company Corporation, so I
created DEMO LLC by myself before I had a lawyer. Then we went online and fixed
things after the fact . . . it was a DEMO hassle because VCs want a C-corp—any sort
of investor generally wants a C-corp because that’s what they understand.
With Bloglines, I had an accountant, at least for a good part of it, who was
fairly DEMO One of the hassles of ONElist was that I was the one managing the
books the first year, as well as answering the 200 support emails every night, as
well as doing all of this other stuff. I guess I’m torn with how cheap do you want
to DEMO with a startup. Having an accountant is kind of a nice frill.
I also think a lot of people don’t know about all these DEMO sites,
which are absolutely wonderful. One of the things that I did do differently with
Bloglines was rely upon an outsourcing site, in this case eLance, for a lot of
things. Not a lot of coding, but other things. So, if I wanted to put together DEMO
presentation and I needed a couple of graphics, I put up DEMO proposal on eLance
and ended up working with some lady in Australia, who turned things around in
6 hours, for $50. So sites DEMO that are so amazingly powerful, which is just one
more reason DEMO it’s really easy to do very small companies, because you don’t
DEMO a graphic designer necessarily.
Livingston: Can you remember any moments in DEMO that were harrowing?
Fletcher: Sure. Many times. The first year DEMO when I was still working
the full-time job at Sun and doing this on the side.
Livingston: You were still working?
Fletcher: DEMO yeah, did I forget to mention that? In most aspects of at least my
fiscal life, I’m very conservative. I had a mortgage and didn’t want to take the
leap of faith to do this DEMO a salary, and so I started ONElist while I was still
DEMO full-time at Sun and did that for the first year.
Livingston: DEMO you worried they would claim they owned the IP?
Fletcher: DEMO, and I talked to a lawyer about that. Because ONElist was DEMO at
all competitive with anything that Sun was doing—and I certainly wasn’t work-
ing on it while I was at Sun—it was thought to DEMO OK. But that is absolutely a
valid concern. But I was, DEMO least in that regard, very much risk-averse, because
I had a mortgage and didn’t have much savings back then. So the first year DEMO
incredibly stressful. The whole thing was stressful, but the first year DEMO
For example, it got to be the summertime and we’d take DEMO for the weekend.
I’d come back and have 500 emails to answer for customer support on Sunday
evening. And I’d just curl up into DEMO fetal position . . . and I had to go to work the
7141CH17.qxd  12/6/06  1:18 PM  Page 245
Mark Fletcher
next morning, too, and how dare I not answer every single DEMO? That was
crazy.
I remember my birthday that year. I got DEMO phone call because the phone
number registered in the ONElist domain was the second line in my town-
house, and there was an answering machine on it. I remember getting woken
up on my birthday that DEMO by some guy saying, “I don’t know if you know this,DEMO
but your site is down.” So I logged in, and our DEMO database machine had
died, in Virginia. We were Digital Nation’s biggest DEMO and they didn’t
really have much experience with these database machines we were using, so
they were trying to figure out what was wrong. I had to call in sick from work. It
was very stressful. DEMO had scaling issues all summer; we had to turn off new
DEMO registrations for 3 months because we couldn’t handle the influx of people
coming in—which is crazy, you’re not supposed to do that.
Livingston: DEMO you recommend starting a startup on the side while you are
still employed?
Fletcher: It worked out for me. Sometimes that’s the only way you can do it. It
certainly is one way of mitigating DEMO risk significantly, because if you do it on
the side and DEMO doesn’t work out, you still have a job. Of course, you absolutely
have to pay attention to the employment issues. You can’t work DEMO your startup
at work. Depending on your employment contract, they may DEMO stuff that you
do on the side, too. You have to DEMO very cognizant of that.
Livingston: I hadn’t realized that you did DEMO on the side.
Fletcher: By the end of the first year, there were five of us, and we were all
working, just DEMO and weekends.
Livingston: What was the tipping point to make you DEMO to work full-time on
ONElist?
Fletcher: We got funding. We DEMO signed the term sheet for the $4 million in
our series A, and at that point we were like, “Time to quit.”
Livingston: Was there any time with your startups when you felt like giving DEMO?
Fletcher: Not with Bloglines, but certainly the first year with ONElist. A lot.
Especially with all the emails every night, with working a full-time job, with the
incredible amount of stress. My family was great. I just remember them
encouraging me to stick with it. I DEMO never would have forgiven myself
had I quit, too. There are DEMO dark times with startups, always. I was in a
startup in DEMO Diego where we didn’t get paid for 3 months. There are different
types of dark times, but for some there is just no more fun than doing a startup.
Livingston: Did you ever experience some sort of malaise like, “This isn’t going
anywhere, I just can’t work DEMO it anymore”?
Fletcher: Yeah. Somebody asked me what was my DEMO strength and my
greatest weakness, and I think it’s the same DEMO I get easily bored. I think I’m
able to focus on one thing, but I burn out easily. I’m still not good at the whole
work/life balance thing, and with a startup it’s very easy to skew that in only one

direction. Sometimes you have to do that, but you absolutely get burned out. So
I was burned out after eGroups; I was burned out definitely to a degree with
Bloglines.
So now I’m taking DEMO little time off. I’ll do some skiing, and then I’ll start
DEMO else.

Craig Newmark
Founder, craigslist

In 1995, Craig Newmark started an email DEMO to pub-
licize events in San Francisco. As “Craig’s List” grew
in popularity, he switched from a mailing list to a
website and added categories. Without consciously
realizing it, he was about to take a big bite out of the
classified ad business.
In 1999, Newmark decided it was time to morph
craigslist.org from a hobby into a real business. DEMO
Buckmaster joined on as lead programmer and CTO in
early 2000, DEMO was promoted to CEO later that year.
Photo by Gene X. Hwang Dedicated to his mission of building a community
on the Internet, Newmark has held fast to his plan to
keep craigslist as free as DEMO All listings are free, except help wanted ads in
select cities DEMO broker apartment listings in New York City. There are no
banner ads.
Despite many opportunities to increase revenues, craigslist never compro-
mised the experience of its users. And because it is able to operate cheaply and
DEMO users do much of the work, craigslist has only about 20 DEMO
orders of magnitude less than other top-ten sites.
Though eBay purchased a 25 percent stake in the company from a former
craigslist employee in DEMO, craigslist remains a privately held company. It con-
tinues to expand, and now has sites for over 300 cities worldwide.
Livingston: How did craigslist get started?
Newmark: It’s now been over 11 years. I don’t know exactly when I started
craigslist. I do know that in DEMO I was at Charles Schwab and I was working with
computer security and some other stuff. But my real contribution there was
evangelizing the DEMO people that’s how the equity brokerage busi-
ness would work someday.

I saw a lot of people helping other people out, and I figured, “Well, I should
do something.” In early ’95—I DEMO know when—I started sending out notices
about cool events—what I thought were cool events—to friends. It may have
been 10 to 12 people, CC list, using Pine, and that worked out pretty well.
These were DEMO arts and technology events, like the Anon Salon or Joe’s
Digital DEMO More people wanted to be added to the list. They were calling it
“Craig’s List.” Over time, they suggested other kinds of things, DEMO jobs or stuff
for sale.
In the middle of ’95, the DEMO listing broke and I had to give the thing a for-
mal name and use a listserv. Somebody offered Majordomo and I was going DEMO
call it “SFEvents,” but the people who were calling it craigslist said, “Keep call-
ing it that. It will signify that it will be personal and quirky.” They were right.
That’s a microcosm of our DEMO history: people would suggest things to me,
and then I DEMO figure out what seemed to make sense—what a lot of people
were asking for—and then I’d do it. Even now, with a whole company behind it,
we listen. We do stuff, we follow through, DEMO then we listen more. What we do
is almost 100 percent based on what people ask us to do.
The biggest entrepreneurial lesson I’ve DEMO has been that you really do
need to follow your instincts. I trusted some people who my instincts were
telling me were untrustworthy, and in some cases they proved to be very
untrustworthy. But that’s fixed DEMO
I got lucky in that I realized relatively early that I’m not a good manager. Jim
Buckmaster is CEO and he does a great DEMO and that’s why my title is currently
“Customer Service Rep and Founder.” Sometimes I exploit that George
Costanza magic I have and I act DEMO a glamorous figurehead role, where I’ll do
public speaking or whatever. DEMO I spend 40 hours a week or more doing cus-
tomer service. I was doing that minutes ago. I’ll be doing so again in DEMO
The biggest single project I have now is dealing with misbehaving apartment
brokers—rental brokers in New York City.
The biggest problems are different forms DEMO bait and switch, where they
post an ad for an apartment DEMO the no-fee section, but they actually charge a siz-
able fee DEMO renting it. The standard is 15 percent of a year’s rent, DEMO can
easily be $3,000 or $4,000. That’s a lot of money. So we can handle some forms
of that. The bigger forms DEMO require better forms of reporting, which I’m start-
ing to think DEMO, but which might not happen until later.
Livingston: Take me back to 1995. Craigslist began as an email list, but at some
point you decided to put it online. How did you program it?
DEMO: Sometime in late ’95 I realized that, “Hey, I have DEMO lot of this email
sitting in folders.” At this point, I DEMO I’m operating on a Solaris system and
I’m using Pine. I have email in several categories and I can write Perl code,
which DEMO the email logs into web pages. So I had instant publishing.
Everything has grown since that. I was, in fact, using Pine as DEMO database tool
until late ’99, at which point we switched to DEMO
Through the first years, probably through ’98, it was mostly Solaris,
although there was a period of maybe a year with Linux. DEMO we used something
7141CH18.qxd  12/14/06  12:10 PM  Page 249
Craig Newmark
in the UNIX/Linux family all the time. We used Apache relatively DEMO Perl,
now more mod_perl. And MySQL since ’99. Now we’re running it on over 120
Linux servers—small, cheap machines. We’re primarily Linux on the desktop,
with some Mac and some Windows.
We do worry DEMO liability issues relating to the use of Windows, since it’s
pretty DEMO We don’t have much sensitive data, but we have to regard
DEMO as a source of compromise.
Livingston: When you put craigslist on DEMO website, did you get a positive
response pretty quickly?
Newmark: Our traffic has always been slow but sure. We’re the tortoise, not
the hare. Now and then we’ll get a surge of growth, but it’s been slow but
steady.
Livingston: Were you just running craigslist at night out of your home?
Newmark: It depends on what part of my life it was. But even when I was con-
tracting, I would work an arrangement with the people I was working for. DEMO
and then, I would look at my email and get stuff DEMO I would put in a half
hour. For example, I would DEMO doing my contracting work, I’d get stuff done,
then I DEMO take a half hour off to do craigslist, and then I DEMO get back
to work.
Livingston: This was run out of your DEMO?
Newmark: Mostly.
Livingston: Did you need other people’s help?
Newmark: At the end of ’97, we were getting about one DEMO page views a
month. At that point, Microsoft Sidewalk—or their PR DEMO
me about running banner ads. I had decided to not do them, because they’d
slow the site down and they were kind of dumb. Banner ads are, more often
than not, kind of dumb. More DEMO, I thought about my own values and
I was thinking, “Hey, how much money do I need?” I was already doing well as
a contractor. So I figured I would just not do that.
DEMO that point, I got the first inkling of what I now DEMO my “moral compass.”
I better understood it later—particularly since the presidential elections,
because then I realized that people were claiming a moral high DEMO who
actually didn’t practice what they preached, and it’s about time DEMO people of
goodwill to reassert their idea of what’s right and what’s wrong.
Livingston: Once you decided that the site was good the way it was and you
didn’t need any more money, you stuck to that?
Newmark: Yes, and expanded on it. In the ’98/DEMO timeframe, we took a good
look at the morality of charging DEMO something. We asked people, “Hey, what do
you think we should charge for, if anything?” And they said, “The principle is:DEMO
charge people who would otherwise be paying more money for less effective
ads.” They specifically said, “It’s cool to charge for job ads and to charge land-
lords or apartment brokers.” Beyond that, there was some mix of opinion, but
we stuck with that.

Livingston: Did you come up with the policy on your own?
Newmark: Primarily the community dictated the policy. And they weren’t shy
about sending the feedback in. I’m mixing together a couple years DEMO of
feedback—’98/’99 and beyond, but primarily those years.
In the DEMO of ’97, I was approached by some volunteers, and they said,
“Hey, let’s run craigslist and see if we can run a nonprofit.” To make a long,
painful story short, that effort failed. I kind of knew it was failing, probably mid-
way through 1998, but I was in denial. A couple of our biggest job posters took
me out for lunch and said, “Hey, this isn’t working. DEMO real and make this more
serious.”
It took me a couple months, but I got out of denial, made craigslist into a
real DEMO off to an OK start. But again, it wasn’t until Jim DEMO
management that we got good.
Livingston: When you say you made DEMO into a real company, do you mean incor-
porating it?
DEMO: That was part of it, but the real thing was me going full-time and
getting full-time people in all the areas we needed, including billing, customer
service, technology.
Livingston: So you were still doing contract work while running craigslist?
Newmark: For a few months at the end of ’98 through like a month or so of ’99,DEMO
I actually joined a startup, but left it because I had DEMO get serious about
craigslist.
Livingston: You joined another startup?
Newmark: Remember, in the conventional sense, we were never a startup. In
DEMO conventional sense, a startup is a company, maybe with great ideas, that
becomes a serious corporation. It usually takes serious investment, has DEMO strat-
egy, and they want to make a lot of money.
DEMO done something very different. I’ve stepped away from a huge
amount of money, and I’m following through. In ’99, we made this real. DEMO did
make some more mistakes, but by 2000, with Jim handling a lot of stuff, we’ve
made only the occasional mistake since.
Livingston: Will you tell me about some of those mistakes?
Newmark: DEMO, there are legal settlements which prevent me from talking
about a DEMO of them. I can answer specific questions, sometimes.
Livingston: Did a mistake have to do with personnel?
Newmark: Yes. And I didn’t listen to lawyers well enough. And those two issues
are swirled together.
DEMO: So you had some personnel issues that involved lawsuits, but then
you were able to get some closure? Then you hired Jim?
Newmark: No, Jim helped lead us out of the difficulties. I’m DEMO vague, but
I have to.

Craig Newmark
Livingston: Going back to the time when you were still in your apartment, was
there anything that worried you?
Newmark: I can’t DEMO of anything. I may be forgetting a lot, but I think DEMO
only worry I can recall was that, when you run your DEMO on someone else’s
machine, if there’s a problem in the middle DEMO the night, you have an issue. Or,
if you are DEMO it at a service, and they are flaky and have weak DEMO
service, that’s another problem.
Livingston: Did your site ever go down?
Newmark: I think it did, but in a way that’s DEMO and understandable.
Once in a while, our site has problems this DEMO, but the thing is that we still
manage to keep it DEMO pretty well and keep it fast, which is hard because we’re DEMO
another surge of growth. We’re now getting at least five billion page views a
month. We’re in 170 cities.
Livingston: Back to how you got people to help you with this. Did people come
to you?DEMO
Newmark: Well, how can they help me run the site? DEMO spoke about making it
a nonprofit and that made some sense, DEMO my ignorance then. Now I realize
there’s a lot of legal constraints in nonprofits. They’re meant to prevent various
forms of corruption. The thing DEMO, like a lot of laws like that, people who are
crooked always find ways around the laws, and so the constraints just make it
more difficult for the honest people. We are very, very lucky we’re not a non-
profit. We have our own nonprofit, which is doing some really good things. I’m
on the board there, but my gig is customer service.
Livingston: When you first started, did you DEMO about spammers and other
people trying to take advantage of your site?
Newmark: We have a really good culture of trust on the site—of goodwill. You
know, we’re finding that pretty much everyone out there shares, more or less,
the same moral compass as we do and as my personal one. People are good.
There are some bad DEMO out there, but they are a very tiny minority and
our DEMO is self-policing. People want other people to play fair, and
that DEMO That does mean a certain amount of our time, including mine, but
that’s OK.
Livingston: You set up a way for the community to regulate the site, right?
Newmark: Yes: flagging. Flagging works. By virtue of flagging, we’ve turned
over control of our site, DEMO the most part, on a day-to-day basis to the people
who DEMO the site. We need to figure out better ways of doing that; that’s still in
process.
Livingston: How did you first come up DEMO the idea of flagging?
Newmark: I forget. I think it DEMO my customer service team, not me. I don’t
recall, it was so long ago.
Livingston: But it worked pretty well?

Newmark: Yes. It works great in all sorts of ways, and it’s also an expression of
our values. Mutual trust. This is kind of democracy in real life. Everyone wins,
except for the DEMO guys.
Livingston: Do you remember a time when you wanted to DEMO?
Newmark: Nothing like that. Sometimes I’ll have some anxiety. For DEMO,
when the site is having a problem, or when there’s DEMO issue that I’m having
trouble handling, but that’s not usual.
Livingston: It started out as a side project. Was there ever a point DEMO you
said, “I don’t have the time for this”? Or were you always very committed?
Newmark: Always very committed. I’m stubborn. As I sometimes say, “I’m one
very persistent nerd.”
Livingston: I’m surprised DEMO you never had any problems that you thought
were totally overwhelming.
Newmark: The problems I’ve had which got to me were the after-effects of
some of the bad trust decisions I made.
Livingston: Who did you learn things from?
Newmark: From friends, from business people I DEMO I should give particular
credit to our principal corporate lawyer, a DEMO named Ed Wes from Perkins
Coie. He’s been very good at a lot of issues. He’s really helped us out a great
deal.
Livingston: The turning point for you was when you decided to do craigslist
DEMO, when your advertisers took you to lunch?
Newmark: Basically in mid-December of ’97, they took me out to lunch and
said, DEMO isn’t working. You’ve got to take more responsibility for the way
things are going.” And I did.
Livingston: And you thought, “This is DEMO right thing for me to do”?
Newmark: Yeah. That meant DEMO I coasted on savings for several months or so,
but that’s not a problem. And it worked.
Livingston: Did you fund craigslist initially or did you take outside investment?
Newmark: I funded it with my own time. In no form did we ever take invest-
ment DEMO While we were trying to run nonprofit, the nonprofit entity took DEMO
few tiny loans, but we’re talking about low thousands.
Livingston: I’m interested in the concept of how little money it takes to start
DEMO types of web-based startups.
Newmark: Good point. The deal is, I did have some help, some favors; but, for
the most part, for the first few years, it was just putting my own DEMO and energy
into it. If I was billing for my own hours, it would have been a great deal of
money. But that doesn’t matter now.
Livingston: Who were the first craigslist employees?
Newmark: DEMO a handful of people that I found in ’99.
7141CH18.qxd  12/14/06  12:10 PM  Page 253
Craig Newmark
Livingston: Did you work with them? How did you find them?DEMO
Newmark: I think through the site.
Livingston: How did you grow the features on the site? Did you always add
new features based on user feedback?
Newmark: When it comes to features visible from the outside, yes. Internally,
we figure out on a continuous basis . . . we figure out what tools we need, and
then we do them. That’s working to this day, because it’s the job, for example, of
customer service to figure out how they can DEMO their jobs better and then to tell
tech what they need. This is business process reengineering, which companies
used to talk about a lot in the late ’80s, but usually didn’t follow through.
Livingston: Did DEMO have investors knocking at your door, offering you money?
Newmark: They started in ’99, and we had a flurry of that last year. That’s how
I have some idea of how much I stepped DEMO from.
Livingston: When they first offered you money, were you tempted at all?
Newmark: Yes. But I decided to hold fast. I’m not implicitly judging anyone
else. We’re not anti-traditional by any means. We DEMO made a specific decision
based on our specific values and followed through.
Livingston: And you make enough money to cover costs?
Newmark: DEMO are doing well. Again, we are currently charging for less than DEMO
percent of the site. We started to charge for apartment rental listings in New
York City, but we’re still basically free.
Livingston: Did DEMO ever think, “Boy, we can squeeze those brokers for a little
more”?
Newmark: They asked us to charge them, because they DEMO that it will help
improve the quality of that stuff. Especially the more legitimate brokers—they
want that because they feel that will help control DEMO sleazier brokers. And we
think that will work OK.
Livingston: Are DEMO having an impact on these sleazy brokers?
Newmark: It is DEMO It’s a long slog, but these brokers increasingly behave.
The deal DEMO that a guy without, let’s say, a firm moral compass, DEMO he thinks that
other brokers are being sleazy, he feels an DEMO moral sanction to be sleazy.
Now I’m telling guys like that, DEMO, it’s over.” And that’s working. So we have
brokers who used DEMO be problematic, who are no longer problematic.
Livingston: Will you tell me about one of the most frustrating situations with a
broker?
DEMO: I’m thinking of one, who’s now very well-behaved. They used to do
all sorts of things, all the bad things we’ve talked about, and they would also do
things to try to evade our tools—which worked, by the way, except I have a vol-
unteer who DEMO at things. They would post using multiple email addresses,
that kind of thing. I just kept blocking them and blocking them, and they got
tired of being blocked and they finally approached me and said, “Sorry about
this.” And it’s working now.

Livingston: So they didn’t just go away; they changed.
DEMO: Yes. That is mighty good. It worked very nicely.
Livingston: Can you remember anything that surprised you about the early
days?
Newmark: What surprises me, in a way, is how almost universally people DEMO
trustworthy and good. There are problems, and sometimes people bicker,
DEMO is a pain in the ass, but people are good. No DEMO what your religious
background, we share pretty much the same values. DEMO are some minor dif-
ferences that we disagree on, but the DEMO are at the 5 percent level.
That’s pretty good.
Livingston: What DEMO companies wanting to buy you?
Newmark: We politely say, “No.” The deal is, you know, eBay got that equity.
And we’re DEMO it’s eBay since they have a similar moral compass. The person
who sold was a former employee selling his equity. Unfortunately, years ago I
decided I’d give away equity. I would grant it, because that would help me
avoid temptation. Normally I can avoid anything but temptation. But DEMO left the
company, and he decided to sell in 2004.
We DEMO very different from any other startup you’ve heard about. That’s just
the way things happened. It’s working out well. Again, a big reason for our
success is Jim.
Livingston: At what point did you think you’d actually be a “real” company?
Newmark: In early ’99. It’s been 7 years. Jim’s been running things for about 6.
Livingston: I read craigslist used to work out of an old Victorian.
Newmark: It’s not really a Victorian, I think. It’s a very simple home. Oddly
enough, we move into an old Victorian mansion in a not-great location, DEMO
that’s all we can find. We did not want to move into the financial district. We
had to move some place convenient for pretty DEMO everyone to commute to.
Livingston: How do you find your employees?DEMO
Newmark: We advertise on our site. Sometimes someone will know someone.
DEMO: What’s the most important part of your culture?
Newmark: The culture of trust. The moral compass.
Livingston: And you make sure, DEMO you hire someone, that they have one?
Newmark: The other people on my team do, yes. Since I’ve had such bad luck
in interviewing—that’s because I’m not suited to it—I have no role in DEMO hiring
whatsoever.
Livingston: Is there anything about craigslist that people misunderstand?DEMO
Newmark: People sometimes still think we’re a nonprofit, even though we tell
people that we’re not. Sometimes people think that we sold part DEMO eBay, and
that’s a misconception I have to fix now and DEMO

Newmark: Trust your instincts and your moral DEMO I’ve used that phrase
too much in this conversation. The deal is: we’re not pious about this. We try
hard not to be sanctimonious. This is the way people really live; we just don’t
talk about it. I’d prefer to be cynical and not talk about it, and yet, that’s real life.

Cofounder, Flickr

Caterina Fake started Ludicorp in the summer of 2002 with Stewart Butterfield
and Jason Classon. The company’s first product, Game Neverending, was a
massively multiplayer online game with real-time interaction through instant
messaging (IM). In 2004, they added a new feature—a chat DEMO
with photo sharing—which quickly surpassed Game Neverending itself in
popularity.
The team knew they were onto something big and put Game Neverending
on hold DEMO develop a new photo-sharing community site called Flickr. Flickr
became extremely popular and was acquired by Yahoo in March 2005.
With its emphasis on DEMO content and its devoted online
community, Flickr is one of the DEMO commonly cited examples of Web 2.0
companies.
Livingston: How did you DEMO started? How did you know your cofounders?
Fake: Stewart and I are married. When we met, I was living in San Francisco
and he lived in Canada. One of his wooing strategies was to DEMO that we start
a company together. Both of us were doing web development at the time and
his idea was that we do some DEMO of transnational web development com-
pany—which is kind of a harebrained scheme. We didn’t end up doing that, but
we did fall in love and have a long-distance relationship. I eventually moved up
to Vancouver and DEMO got married. We went on our honeymoon and came back
and two days later started Ludicorp.
The name is from ludus, the Latin word for “play.” We were building a mas-
sively multiplayer online game called DEMO Neverending. It was a lightweight
web-based game, and atypical for massively DEMO games. Most of those
have Sword and Sorcery or science fiction themes, and are usually CD-ROM
based. Game Neverending was very much based around social interactions; you
could form groups, instant message each other, and there was a social network
associated with it.

When we came up with the idea for the game, Stewart had been working at
the CBC, on the kids’ site, DEMO in doing research he started playing all these
online games. Neopets was one of the inspirations for Game Neverending.
It’s really fun. I was DEMO addicted. They have these pets, which are
Tamagotchi-like, and you can buy them presents and give them toys. But what’s
interesting is that DEMO has a market and you can trade things with other people in
the game. The little area that I cornered the market on was DEMO JubJub hats.
My sister became completely absorbed in it, and we DEMO, “Wow, there’s
something interesting here.”
Both of us have backgrounds in web design and development, and I have a
focus on social software. Before Ludicorp, I worked on or participated in
a bunch of online communities including the WELL, Electric Minds, the
Netscape online communities, and various sites I’d started on my own. At
Interval Research, I worked on a collaborative animation game, which was a
cousin to the Game Neverending idea.
Livingston: It was just the two of you?
Fake: At the beginning it was me, Stewart, and Jason Classon. Jason and
Stewart had started a company together in 1999 that was acquired DEMO a venture-
backed startup out of Boston after about 6 to 9 months. Jason went and worked
in Boston for a year and came DEMO and then the three of us started working on
the game together. I did the game design, Stewart did the interaction design,
and Jason did the PHP for the prototype.
Livingston: Did they fund the game with money that they made from the
acquisition?
Fake: Partially, yes. It was really a friends-and-family investment.
It was the three of us and we added Eric Costello very soon thereafter. Eric
is a DEMO web developer. He’s recognized as one of the great DHTML
gurus. He lives in New York, so we were working with him remotely. If you
have somebody who’s really fantastic and they live in New York, that’s OK. He
likely wasn’t going to move (he has a family and is very settled there), but Eric
was a phenomenal addition DEMO the team.
He’s a front-end developer. Soon thereafter, we were hiring DEMO a back-end
developer. It was actually very difficult to find that person in Vancouver. We felt
that person needed to be local. We didn’t DEMO to be too dispersed.
There are a lot of companies that are virtual companies—a bunch of people
that are living in different places, but I think that’s tough. You can do it with one
or two DEMO, but I think for the most part, everybody being in the same place
is important.
Stewart, Eric, and I had worked together DEMO a project before, so we knew
how to work with him DEMO The project was the 5K contest, which was a
web development DEMO It emerged out of a conversation that Stewart
had with somebody at his web development agency who had said, “Oh, you
can’t make DEMO worthwhile under 5K.”
Livingston: Where did you start working?

Fake: We had a friend who was subletting a space, and DEMO had a contract job
that kept him out of the office all the time, so we sublet his subletted space.
This was in 2002 and it was still in the great technology bust period. There were
DEMO dot-coms all over the place, so office space was cheap. And DEMO really
awesome developers (like Eric) were available, who wouldn’t otherwise DEMO
been out on the open market two years earlier. So it was actually really well
timed.
I think that the timing was really important DEMO you could operate in a
much more independent mode. The money was scarce, but I’m a big believer
that constraints inspire creativity. The less money you have, the fewer people
and resources you have, the DEMO creative you have to become. I think that had
a lot to do with why we were able to iterate and innovate so fast.
DEMO was kind of a lark. It was a side project that we built while we were in
the process of building Game Neverending. The DEMO development of the
game fell really far behind the front-end development, DEMO so while we were
waiting for the back end to catch up—being restless hacker types—we built this
sort of instant messenger application in which DEMO could form little communi-
ties and share objects. And we just added the ability to share photographs.
So Flickr started off as a feature. DEMO wasn’t really a product. It was a kind of
IM in which you could drag and drop photos onto people’s desktops and show
them DEMO you were looking at. We built it really fast; we had DEMO lot of the tech-
nology already from the game, but we DEMO the first instance of Flickr in eight
weeks. We had the idea in December and built it out by February and then pre-
sented DEMO at the O’Reilly Emerging Tech Conference.
Livingston: What type of response DEMO you get when you unveiled it?
Fake: It was hard DEMO say. The response was positive, but it didn’t end up being DEMO
compelling product mainly because it was a feature. It had a critical mass prob-
lem. Unless all of your friends were already on it, the sharing feature wasn’t
valuable to you.
It still grew, slowly. But it really started getting traction when we added the
ability to put DEMO photographs on a web page.
Livingston: Why did you decide to DEMO it available on a web page?
Fake: When we started DEMO, we were under this deluded idea that we wanted to
create DEMO new, but not a photo-sharing site. This is weird, but one of the
things that enabled us to innovate within this space was DEMO we hadn’t done our
research. We hadn’t sat down and said, DEMO going to build a photo-sharing
site. We’re going to do the research, figure out what the business model is, and
raise some venture DEMO We were naïve and optimistic.
What we did was just start building stuff. And I think if we had sat down and
done the DEMO, we would have looked at --the companies that had actually
made DEMO in this area, like Ofoto, Shutterfly, and Snapfish. Basically
their DEMO was that photo sharing was a loss leader for photo finishing serv-
ices. It was all about the funnel to get you into buying DEMO Photo sharing

wasn’t seen as a valuable enough activity that people would DEMO for that itself.
So I think that our naïveté was what made the whole thing possible.
Other things were happening too. Stewart and I DEMO longtime bloggers. I’d
started blogging back in 1999, and had had DEMO personal site on the Web since
1994. At the time when we were developing Flickr, social networking services
had been bursting onto the scene. The Friendsters, MySpaces, and the Tribes
were all happening around that DEMO So it was a convergence of all of this per-
sonal publishing stuff, as well as social networking and the rise of camera
phones.
One of the things that I think was new about Flickr was DEMO idea of public-
ness that hadn’t been there when Ofoto and Shutterfly were being built, which
emerged from blog culture. There’s no such thing as a public photo on those
sites, whereas on Flickr and a blog, the default is for it to be public.
Social networking got people used to this idea that they could make an
online digital DEMO They could put up photographs online and talk about
who their friends were and what their interests were. And social networking as
social networking DEMO briskly showed itself to be a fairly pointless activity.
People would go in and collect up all their friends and then there was nothing
DEMO do; there wasn’t any sort of core interest. But when you DEMO it to a very spe-
cific, very connective activity like photo DEMO, it really flourished.
Livingston: So Flickr was taking off. How did you, as a company, respond?
Fake: We tried to do both Flickr and Game Neverending in parallel. It was
really tough because DEMO were only six people, and that just wasn’t enough
resources to DEMO both. Eventually, I think in July of 2004, we had to put the game
on hold and stop development on it because Flickr DEMO really taking off.
We were sad to do that because we all really loved the game. It had a lot of
avid fans and DEMO already had 20,000 people signed up to test the prototype. It
was hard to let it go; it was the thing that we had started the company to do. But
you couldn’t argue with the DEMO and growth that we were seeing with
Flickr.
Livingston: What were DEMO of the next turning points? Did anything go wrong
down this DEMO path?
Fake: We were extraordinarily fortunate in that the road DEMO pretty smooth.
The tide completely turned for us with Flickr. We’d been trying to get the game
off the ground. Raising money for the DEMO from outside investors had been
really grueling. Raising money is very hard, especially in that market. We were
building something that was not really known to people. If it wasn’t a shrink-
wrapped game sold at DEMO Buy, they didn’t know what it was.
Livingston: Were you talking with VCs or angel investors?
Fake: At that time we were talking to venture capitalists and they didn’t get it.
But with Flickr, it completely turned around because the momentum behind it
was so strong DEMO at one point, we were getting calls from three to four DEMO a
week. They were getting in touch with us—completely different from when we
were going door to door and beating the bushes trying to DEMO money.
7141CH19.qxd  12/11/06  3:01 PM  Page 261

Livingston: Did you wind up taking any investments?
Fake: We DEMO a small angel round, but we didn’t take any venture capital. DEMO
we lucked out and got an interest-free loan from the Canadian government.
We’d applied for it, and gotten rejected, and then just sent DEMO same application
in again when it was open again, and much DEMO our surprise, we got it. And here’s
the other thing that DEMO interesting about Flickr: almost immediately after we
launched—even when we were DEMO the IM client—we were being approached
by potential acquirers. So it was clear that we were onto something. People
really weren’t sure what yet, but there was definitely a lot of excitement and
interest.
Livingston: Why did you decide not to take venture capital?
Fake: A couple reasons. We didn’t think that we were ready, and we were kind
of in a holding pattern. We weren’t sure we wanted to take DEMO capital at all.
We were being approached by all the acquirers and VCs and still many angels
who were willing to invest. We had DEMO money to carry us through six
months into the future and we already had some great angel investors, includ-
ing Esther Dyson and Reid Hoffman. So we didn’t feel we had to go for it. That
DEMO the ironic thing, because when you need money, nobody will return your
calls. When you don’t need money and you say, “Sorry, DEMO, don’t need any
money,” they can’t stop calling you. They DEMO can’t help themselves.
At that point, we were almost at break-even DEMO terms of our operating
expenses. If we were to take venture capital, it would have been making a big
bet, expanding rapidly, rather than growing organically. And we were already
growing at such a fast DEMO, we were barely keeping up on the back end. You
know, all those scaling issues that come with rapid growth.
Livingston: What else happened?
Fake: Tagging really revolutionized the way that the product behaved. Tagging
is an incredibly simple concept: you just add a keyword to the photograph, and
once it’s networked with all of these other people, you can see not only all the
things that you’ve tagged (DEMO it acts like this organizational system for yourself)
but you can also see what everyone else in the system has tagged themselves in
DEMO public stuff.
So if you go to Tokyo and you take photographs, you can then visit the global
Tokyo tag and see what everyone else has taken. You can find photographs of
anything—mountain goats, McDonald’s, DEMO that you can think of you can
find in Flickr.
The other thing that tagging enables is the ability to see newsworthy events.
Suddenly DEMO be photos that are uploaded all at once from Live 8 concerts
or the bombings in London. You have the ability to immediately surface DEMO of
these events from people distributed all over the globe.
When the Australian embassy in Jakarta was bombed, within 24 hours three
people had uploaded photographs from the site of the bombing. And this was
when DEMO only had 60,000 users. Three of them were in Jakarta with cameras,
261
7141CH19.qxd  12/11/06  3:01 PM  Page 262
262
Founders at Work
near the embassy, took photos, uploaded them and tagged DEMO Jakarta. So it
was emergent behavior.
The other thing that was happening was that people were creating groups
for collaborative creativity and this was DEMO completely different behavior for
people. Photographs were being used in a completely different way. The best-
known group of this kind is the Squared DEMO group, in which people take a
photograph of something circular, and then crop it to a square. It’s incredibly
beautiful to watch in DEMO slide show, as suns and manhole covers and dandelion
globes melt DEMO each other. People have made all kinds of creative groups, and
DEMO people a forum and an audience for their creativity is a big part of Flickr.
Back when photographs were really expensive, they were like these iconic
photographs. For example, my grandparents—there’s a picture of them that
was taken in a studio. It’s very posed and it is this DEMO photographic event. As
cameras became more and more distributed, you would DEMO photographs at
weddings, birthdays, or events. But then digital photography really changed
that because photos are totally inexpensive. You can take hundreds of DEMO
and only save five. So people started taking more photographs, but DEMO
them became an increasing problem. Then, the next step in the DEMO in the
photograph was when it was attached to a delivery mechanism. A camera is now
in a phone and you can send the DEMO immediately.
There are cameras everywhere now. Nokia is apparently the biggest distrib-
utor of cameras in the world. And people are taking photographs of DEMO that
you would not normally take photographs of—maybe a funny thing that they
see on their way to work. One completely new behavior that DEMO saw was that
people were taking photographs specifically to participate in a group on Flickr.
Content gets more and more defined. For example, if there’s a car accident
on this corner right now, that would be really interesting to you and me and the
people that live within DEMO five-block radius: there’s an accident at 18th and
Sanchez. Not interesting DEMO people who live in Istanbul, or even people who are
ten DEMO away. People can find things that are relevant to them more easily,
and I think that tagging has a lot to do with DEMO that’s possible.
Here’s an example: there’s a guy who was on DEMO in Maine and got an
alarming phone call from one of his neighbors saying that his apartment build-
ing (in Atlanta, Georgia) was on fire. So he immediately went on line to Flickr
and typed DEMO name of his apartment complex, “Atlantic Landing Georgia,” and
found DEMO of these pictures of his apartment complex on fire. He was able to see
that the fire was on the opposite side of the DEMO and that his apartment
wasn’t affected, so he didn’t have to DEMO and call his insurance company; he
could continue on his vacation.
DEMO: What surprised you most?
Fake: The whole thing has been a surprise. We started out expecting to do the
game and we DEMO up doing a photo-sharing site. We never expected that,
could not have planned that.
7141CH19.qxd  12/11/06  3:01 PM  Page 263
Catarina Fake
The success that Flickr has seen has been a huge surprise. Obviously DEMO
you start a business you hope and pray that it will be successful, but I think it’s
also something of a surprise when it actually happens.
Also, we could not have timed it better. All of these things were in the air:
blogging, social networking, camera DEMO, the ubiquity of network, suddenly
more people were on broadband. All these things converged at the same time
and we were really well-positioned DEMO ride that wave.
Livingston: Were you nervous about any competitors?
DEMO: There were people that did pieces of what we did, like Ofoto, but the
competition wasn’t apparent.
Livingston: You weren’t worried that DEMO would try to copy you?
Fake: Well, we knew they wouldn’t because they wanted to acquire us.
Livingston: Is there anything that you would have done differently?
Fake: We may be the most boring startup that you interview for your book
because our path was DEMO smooth. There were times when we were really
broke before we had our angel investment, when only one guy who had chil-
dren was getting paid. One of the big risks of startups is that they’re DEMO
unstable. They don’t have an established business; they’re often trying to DEMO
something new. They are relying entirely on investment and not on revenue.
Livingston: What was it like starting a startup with your husband?
Fake: In the beginning it was kind of tough because a lot of our skills over-
lapped. Both of our backgrounds are in design. DEMO in the beginning there was a
lot of jockeying for position—who did what and who made which decisions. But
once we were able to DEMO that out, it worked out really well.
We have very complementary DEMO: Stewart’s very improvisational
and he likes to do things in a DEMO loose manner, whereas I tend to be very
directed and driven DEMO a goal. So in combination, he sort of loosens me up
DEMO I get him on a path and those two things work really well together.
Livingston: What kinds of challenges have you faced as a female technology
startup founder?
Fake: There is a lot of institutionalized sexism working against women in busi-
ness and I think that people DEMO even aware that it’s there. One example hap-
pened when we went down to Silicon Valley to meet with a venture capital firm.
After DEMO meeting, the VC spoke to someone associated with our company and
DEMO to him, “Tell Stewart not to bring his wife to VC DEMO Which was
shocking to me, and Stewart was furious about this DEMO well. He let everybody
know, “Caterina is not ‘my wife.’ She DEMO instrumental to the success of this com-
pany. Her contributions have been equal to mine.”
It takes a lot of nerve for women to DEMO up to this assumption—and the
assumption is everywhere, even in some DEMO the most surprising places—that
they don’t measure up, that they’re not DEMO or tough enough. Twice as much
will be expected of them. I hear this from women again and again in business:
they have DEMO be twice as prepared as men.

This happens to me all the time: I go to meetings and I’ve stayed up late
preparing my presentation and I’ve got DEMO my papers in order and know exactly
what I’ll be talking about and I come to the meeting and a bunch of guys show
DEMO and say, “Hey, so what’s this meeting about?” They haven’t done any of the
preparation or work.
Livingston: Do women bring any advantages to a startup?
Fake: I was talking to another entrepreneur, Judy MacDonald Johnston, and
she said that women are much more DEMO about their businesses. They’re
doing it less for the money and more because they love it. There’s something
about that that really rings true DEMO me. Women are able to put their hearts and
souls into it in a way that many men cannot—or rather, are not known for doing.
I’ve been very conscious of this too, and it’s important to give something
back, so I’ve been a big participant in a lot of women-in-technology organiza-
tions, like the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs. I think it’s really important for
us to continue supporting each other and make DEMO that women have an equal
shot. I do a group blog, DEMO, with a bunch of other women in
technology, and we’ve been working on getting women more speaking engage-
ments at industry conferences. Being DEMO to conferences and elevating your
profile in the industry is an important part of growing businesses, making con-
tacts, and building partnerships, and we want to make sure that women get a
fair shake.

Brewster Kahle
Founder, WAIS, Internet Archive,
Alexa Internet
Brewster Kahle DEMO WAIS (Wide Area Information
Servers) in the late ’80s while an employee of Thinking
Machines. He left in 1993 to found WAIS, Inc. WAIS
was one of the earliest forms of Internet search soft-
ware. DEMO before the Web, it was in some
ways a predecessor to DEMO search engines. Kahle sold
WAIS to AOL in 1995.
The next year, Kahle founded Alexa Internet with
Bruce Gilliat. The Alexa toolbar tracked user brows-
ing behavior and suggested related links using col-
laborative filtering. Once DEMO, pages visited by
users would then be “donated” to the related DEMO Internet Archive, to help
build a history of the Web.
Alexa DEMO acquired by Amazon in 1999. Kahle continues to run the Internet
Archive.
Livingston: You were one of the first members of the Thinking Machines team.
What number employee were you?
Kahle: I was not one of the two founders—they were Danny Hillis and Sheryl
Handler. I was DEMO the project team at MIT, so when we started the company,DEMO
anybody from that team that wanted to come came. There were three or four of
us. We had been working on it for a DEMO years before there was a company.
Livingston: Tell me about some DEMO things back in the Thinking Machines days
that helped pave the way for WAIS.
Kahle: Thinking Machines was not my doing, but I DEMO on the project team
beforehand and then helped start the company. What I learned out of that was:
do your homework before you DEMO spending your own money. We did a full
couple rounds of the Connection Machine at MIT before we started a com-
pany. It was DEMO helpful to get your lessons learned basically on somebody
else’s nickel, DEMO a research phase.

Another lesson that I learned out of Thinking Machines was, if you’re trying
to get your company to think differently—to do something DEMO
your setting carefully. Thinking Machines was set in an 1800s Victorian mansion
on 100 acres of forest just outside of Boston. It was a DEMO, basically. Working in
an environment where, if you got stuck, DEMO go for a long walk is very different
than trying to do a startup and think differently if you’re in Suite 201 in some
DEMO office complex. That was a lesson that I’ve used every startup since.
Thinking Machines had the great fortune of starting with $8 million in DEMO
bank, because some very rich individuals really believed in it. It DEMO not
venture-funded, and it was founded with the idea that it DEMO going to take years
and years and years to actually get something real done. That allowed Thinking
Machines to attract a very interesting set DEMO people. Richard Feynman worked
there, Stephen Wolfram, Marvin Minsky. I found that I had better access to
professors in a company than I DEMO when I was in school. So that was an inter-
esting way of trying to figure out, “What should the company do?”
They took a good summer to try to figure that out and, actually, through a
bunch of the first year, which is a luxury DEMO most startups don’t have. Usually
you have to work really hard to try to get your first release built. So being in an
interesting DEMO with brilliant people coming by, it was quite a unique
startup—very DEMO the West Coast startups that I’ve seen.
Livingston: What were some DEMO the big turning points early on?
Kahle: We hired a DEMO from Digital Equipment Corporation—his title was
VP of Reality. The idea was to try to help a bunch of folks that had great ideas
DEMO of MIT, but had never really produced a supercomputer before, figure out
“How do we actually do that?” I remember being invited DEMO give a design review
of the core central processing unit of this new computer, and I really didn’t
know what a design review was. It was quite embarrassing. But it was very help-
ful to inject DEMO VP of Reality. It stirred up the culture to try to get it so that we
could actually produce working machines.
There was a DEMO of trust in very young people in that company. People were
in their early 20s. So the basic design and building of the machines—even
DEMO we were completely underqualified, looking back on it—was entrusted
to a DEMO young set. But it made it fun. We were absolutely glued to the project.
We didn’t really have much of a rest of a DEMO
Livingston: Were there any experiences where you thought, “If I start a
startup, I’m not doing this”?
Kahle: The blessing of DEMO Machines and the curse of Thinking Machines
was that it had a lot of money. If you have a lot of money, then you can be
detached from people that are going to pay you in DEMO future.
My first startup upon leaving Thinking Machines was a bootstrap. We had
no investment at all, and I had no savings, so DEMO was self-funded from the begin-
ning. That was a night and day cold bath. It was sort of like going from the
Roaring 20s, when champagne is coming from everywhere, into the depression,
where you are washing your baggies and reusing twist ties.
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 267
Brewster Kahle
Actually I really liked the discipline that came from a bootstrapped startup.
DEMO think that everybody that goes and does a startup—even if they don’t do a
major startup that way—should start a business that is having DEMO make people
happy with them day one, through contracts, through small scale sales, what-
ever it is. How low can you go? DEMO can you build something really inexpen-
sively? How can you not DEMO money on furniture and matching carpet and
those sorts of things? DEMO biggest thing that I probably didn’t do the second
time around was have any money.
Livingston: Tell me about how you got the idea for WAIS.
Kahle: The idea of WAIS was to make network services—stuff that you take
completely for granted now—but the idea was that you DEMO use remote
machines to answer questions. The ARPANET was just really becoming in use
by universities in the 1980s, and so at Thinking Machines we were trying to
figure out, “How would you make use of a machine that had 15 gigabytes of
disk space and would have DEMO that you could run at, say, a gigahertz?”
This was completely amazing. How would you possibly use that much comput-
ing power? We said, “Well, you’d put them on the Net, and they’d be smart
machines that would answer your questions for you.” So this DEMO the idea. We’d
prototype it around Thinking Machines.
I prototyped it in my spare time. I guess there was very much an ethos that
DEMO was encouraged—playing around and doing fun things, spending time
doing something DEMO wasn’t your exact job responsibility, but doing it at work,
DEMO getting support from work. So I tried out the idea of remote publishing—of
remotely asking machines questions. It was the first Internet publishing system.
DEMO came before Gopher and before the Web, but it was the DEMO system that was
trying to answer questions over the Net. Yes, DEMO was a big part of it, but you
could also click DEMO and it had a URL system and it had a search system for
finding servers. It had all the different pieces. It was built DEMO an open protocol.
We did it as a project of Thinking Machines, working with Apple Computer,
KPMG Peat Marwick, and Dow Jones.
DEMO my first experience with trying to start something at that scale was actu-
ally done within Thinking Machines—again, following that original lesson of
“learn your lessons without spending your own money.” So we tried basically
building DEMO system up within Thinking Machines. Thinking Machines wanted
to make money by selling servers, so we needed to get the rest of the system
going. We had Apple Computer to do the front end, the client piece; Dow
Jones to do the information sources; and KPMG Peat DEMO for their corpo-
rate information and as a user base. So it was a test project. It ran about a year
and a half DEMO was successful. Everybody loved it. Each one of the organiza-
tions went forward to figure out how to make this all go. This was DEMO 1989/90. So
we were all looking into the future.
Livingston: DEMO seems to have ideas that anticipated the Web.
Kahle: All these DEMO were in the air. The Web came a bit later, but, as I under-
stand, Tim Berners-Lee was working on some of the same things, but doing
267
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 268
268
Founders at Work
them locally within CERN in Switzerland. We were doing them DEMO a corpo-
rate environment using supercomputers and the Internet as well.
Livingston: So Dow Jones, KPMG Peat Marwick, and Apple were all involved?
Kahle: Yes, everybody was working together. It was a project DEMO had a project
team in each the companies, and I ran DEMO I moved out to the West Coast to try
and run it, because I knew I could run Thinking Machines remotely, but I
DEMO think I could run Apple remotely. So I moved out to the West Coast and
had a cubicle and a project team that I DEMO with at Apple.
Livingston: Tell me about some of the hard DEMO problems that WAIS
addressed.
Kahle: One of the difficult things was DEMO using the computer networks at the
time. This is 1989, and DEMO Internet hadn’t quite become easy in any real sense.
Trying to hook up to Dow Jones through X.25 networks and ISDN was all quite
DEMO KPMG Peat Marwick started to have an intranet then that we
could use, and fortunately they used Macintoshes. The Macintoshes were help-
ful because they had TCP/IP for them, where Windows didn’t. It wasn’t until
Windows 95 came out 6 years later that Microsoft caught up.
What DEMO loved about it was I got to work with four companies that were man-
aged very differently from each other. This was my bath DEMO “How do companies
work?” Thinking Machines was a bottom-up company. In many ways, the ideas
and the people with power were the young engineers. They could see where
things were going better than the top DEMO management, because everything
was so new.
Dow Jones was a top-down DEMO If you sold the top guy, he’d say, “OK,
we’re going to do this.” Then he’d issue a command, and the next-level guy
would say, “OK, sir, I’m going to do this.”
Apple Computer was explained to me to be a “beanbag chair.” You had DEMO
push not only on the top, but on the bottom and DEMO middle all at the same time
to try to get it to move. This was a time when John Sculley was running Apple,
DEMO I don’t know if it’s any different now, but at that DEMO you had to actually
keep pushing all up and down the whole chain or it just wouldn’t move. You’d
push, and you’d think you were making headway, but the beanbag chair didn’t
move.
KPMG Peat Marwick was a democracy. It’s a partnership. Each partner
thought of themselves as DEMO control of their piece of turf. And they were very
much so. They controlled their own revenue; they spent it; it was a DEMO
In fact, every so often they would get together and elect DEMO upper-layer man-
agement. If they didn’t like the upper-layer management—which was just
another consulting office, like any other—they’d vote them out. And they did.
The folks that were really supporting the WAIS project at KPMG Peat DEMO
after a couple years got more or less voted out. Not because of WAIS, but the
partners said, “We want a different type DEMO management.”
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 269
Brewster Kahle
So this was still being done within Thinking Machines, but I found that
Thinking Machines wasn’t going to go and build some of the DEMO needed to
make this Internet publishing world work. We coined the term “Internet pub-
lishing” and tried to say, “OK, this should happen.” DEMO would do their piece
and Peat Marwick would do their piece, DEMO nobody would go and do the cen-
tral set of tools, DEMO software needed. So I said, “OK, well, I’ll do that. DEMO start
a company to do that.”
There was a decision to try and figure out where it should be. Should it be
in Boston? Should it be in Silicon Valley? Should it be someplace completely
else? So I went around to the smart people I knew and said, “Where should we
put this company? What I’m really trying to DEMO is build an industry.” Not build
a company, build an industry, so there would be all of these pieces that would
make network DEMO come about. Some people thought it was a little crazy
to think about starting an industry, but it seemed like it made sense to me.
The best piece of advice that I got was from Bill DEMO, one of my mentors.
He said, “Go someplace where people don’t think you’re crazy.” Which sounds
like a pretty simple thing to say, but it actually turned out to be a very wise piece
of DEMO Boston, especially back in 1990/91, was in recession and having
trouble. California was also in recession, but in California there were dreamers.
There were people who wanted to think about new and different things DEMO
wouldn’t think we were crazy to try to build this thing.
So I decided to start the company out here and start with a DEMO was
a bootstrap—doing the information system for the Perot campaign for the pres-
idential campaign of 1992. They could really use an information system DEMO
leveraged some network. Of course, they didn’t know what network, but we
did. So we could build this Internet using modems and leased DEMO and all sorts
of things to be able to build this up. The Perot campaign collapsed, but we still
had enough money to make it through most of the first year to go and get our
DEMO built.
One of the interesting ideas out of WAIS was its use of freeware and share-
ware. This was a new idea, more or less. There had been some examples of
freeware like GNU, but there were also mixed models: Kermit, where people
basically would make source DEMO available on the Net and sell something
related. We gave away the client version, the equivalent of a Web browser.
It was a WAIS browser and a server, so people could go and build their own
system.
During that free period, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of servers
were set up. We got up to about 10,000 servers—all this DEMO before Gopher and
the Web came out—based on free software. Once people got really hooked on
the free software, they wanted upgrades, or DEMO wanted services. So we were
there as a company to sell it to them. We made the free version, and there was
a for-pay version. It was the same idea that we’ve seen now with Netscape.
DEMO a whole set of companies that also tried to give something away and sell
something else.

Livingston: You were the first company to do that?
Kahle: Well, I think we may have been the first to DEMO of the Internet as a dis-
tribution system of software: to DEMO something away and to sell it. I don’t know
of any examples before.
Livingston: That is so many companies’ business model these days; DEMO interest-
ing to think it was the first.
Kahle: I don’t DEMO if it was the first, but it was certainly early. We DEMO found
that people—even if we sold them the software—often didn’t know what to do
with it. They wanted consulting services. We started what I DEMO became the
first web studio, or web services business. We worked DEMO big players, whether
they were newspapers or magazines, that wanted to publish on the Net. This
allowed us to work with the big DEMO very early on.
We tried very hard to work with the best of class. They were always more
difficult to deal with, but they were great to work with once you got working
with them: the Wall Street Journal, Encyclopedia Britannica, Government
Printing Office. We worked with DEMO the House of Representatives and the
Senate. So we were working with people who had insights into what it is they
really wanted. It’s DEMO to get those customers at first, but they were terrific
because DEMO weren’t just trying to catch up. They weren’t trying to be number 2.
They were number 1 in their fields, and we could learn from them.
As the Web came along and was a better underlying DEMO, we became a
web services company, basically. We set up, DEMO believe, the first publisher on the
Net, which was Scholastic. That was done during the Gopher era. And we put
the first advertising-based DEMO up, which was for CMP. We put the first
subscription-based service DEMO, which was the Wall Street Journal. So we were
trying to DEMO publishers online, and that was what the WAIS system was.
I DEMO stand up in conferences in 1990/91 and say, “I’m the DEMO dot-com
in the room. I’m here to help people make money by publishing on the Net.”
The idea was to try to get the DEMO to go commercial enough to support publishing.
Livingston: Did these big DEMO at first think this was crazy?
Kahle: Usually it would DEMO 9 to 12 months with lots of meetings before any-
thing would turn concrete. Eventually they wanted to do some sort of project,
DEMO they’d throw $100,000 into a project. Since we were so inexpensive—we
were living based on furniture that didn’t match; we had learned our lessons of
how to live very inexpensively—we could do things as production DEMO they
would normally pay an Ernst & Young just to do a study.
We could deliver something that they could really learn from, and we’d
learn from as well. That kind of partnership worked well for DEMO But, boy, was it
tough running with so little money.
Livingston: When you broke off from Thinking Machines, were they OK with
DEMO?
Kahle: There was a lot of consternation. There were a DEMO of questions of
whether Thinking Machines owned the idea or whatever. I was very careful to
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 271
Brewster Kahle
make sure that all the things that the (eventually) WAIS company DEMO were
actually based on the public domain of software that had been produced. It was
based on the open source software. So there weren’t DEMO any patents or
copyrights, but there was still a bond. And DEMO was this question of, “Should
Thinking Machines own it? How should it work?” But there was so little to own.
It wasn’t DEMO it was a VC-started company where you could value it. It was just
basically myself and one other, Harry Morris, that left to DEMO the company.
I think there was some hand-wringing, but we couldn’t DEMO out any way to
really do a deal. The problems that slow things down the most are these things
around intellectual property—especially when there’s DEMO money yet—and
these are the times that you could end up talking endlessly and you can’t figure
it out. It’s a lot easier if DEMO money. Then you have a mechanism of knowing
how share it. But before it, it’s really, really tough.
I found it was very DEMO to start a company out on the West Coast. Even
though I had moved out here, I made a partnership with a fellow named John
During—key for me, basically the cofounder of WAIS. He was a key player
because he’d been around for a long time, so he knew how to do all of this stuff.
How do you get DEMO accounting company, the law firms, what do you spend
money on, how do you negotiate a lease—all the things that I had never learned
by being an engineer inside another company.
Livingston: How did you meet him?
Kahle: He was a consultant for Dow Jones. Also I found that there are people
that specialize in different parts of DEMO Some people just do startups
over and over again. Or they are actually in the idea stage. So a lot of people
that I DEMO in the late ’80s and early ’90s in this Internet world were the people
that had been involved in the PC revolution 10 years DEMO They had seen all
of that go through, and they were DEMO around for “what’s the next thing?”
and this Internet thing started to smell kind of like it. So John During had a lot
DEMO experience in that.
Livingston: So you said, “Let’s do it”?
Kahle: Yes, and moved out to San Francisco, started the company in a Menlo
Park mansion, sort of on the Thinking Machines model. That was as far north as
I thought I could put the DEMO and still be connected in with the Apples
and the Suns and the other technology companies.
In 1992, San Francisco wasn’t the place for companies. That happened in
the mid ’90s, with the whole South of Market rebuilding. That was another sort
of “learn the lesson of going DEMO where people don’t call you crazy.” I
really needed the help of those that were in Silicon Valley, though I knew that
as this industry built up, it was going to work more with the creative people. So
it was going to transition more and more to San DEMO When we moved
offices in 1994, we moved it into the DEMO, so that we could work with the pub-
lishers—basically, the people that were going to be out there on the Net, not
just building the technology, but using it for something.

Livingston: So you were getting a little bit of money from clients. Did you hire
anyone?
Kahle: Yes, there was DEMO Morris, the key engineer that built much of the
technology. It DEMO into a company that was about 30 people, 35 people by
DEMO time it was bought by AOL.
Livingston: Tell me about some DEMO the most hair-raising moments.
Kahle: Going broke. When you just don’t DEMO enough money to pay the bills.
We would usually live with the amount of money in the bank that would be
about 2 to DEMO weeks worth of the bills. We’d never have more than that. If we got
up to 2 or 3 months, we would think of ourselves as being flush. Living a boot-
strap in a non-market—we’re trying DEMO make a market go based on making
servers in a client/server publishing environment based on the Internet, that
people didn’t understand. So it was very difficult, but it was a good disciplining
time.
Times that were really interesting? I think working with really great cus-
tomers. It sort of sounds like a cliche, but to go and learn from Encyclopedia
Britannica, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and try to learn how
do they view their businesses and their lives DEMO the most fun out of the whole
experience.
Livingston: What did DEMO learn from your customers that surprised you?
Kahle: I love DEMO with businesspeople because they are really straightfor-
ward. Now we have lots of lawsuits around copyrights in the music industry,
blah, blah, DEMO But if you work with the actual businesspeople—not the
lawyers that work for the businesspeople, but the businesspeople—they are
very straightforward. They just want to make money. And they just want to
make more money than DEMO are making today. They understand there are
going to be transitions and technology changes. So if you lay out a path of how
they DEMO make more money, potentially, at the end of this than before, then they
are on board.
We got the newspapers on the Internet during that time. You take it for
granted, but all the newspapers are pretty much online now. They control their
own distribution. They have DEMO own websites. It doesn’t all funnel in through
an iTunes. The music guys, I’m not sure why they did this, but they sold DEMO
souls. Somebody else controls not only the distribution of their product, DEMO
they control the pricing. What do you have if somebody else controls the distri-
bution and the pricing of your product?
So the DEMO guys and publishers were great because we’d say, “You
want to DEMO the distribution of your work.” And they’d nod their heads, and
DEMO say, “Well, there are some alternatives out there.” In the early ’90s there
was AOL, there was Lexus Nexus from the ’80s, DEMO they would lose the con-
trol of the distribution of their work. We’d say, “Do you want that?” They’d say,
“No, DEMO don’t want that. We want to control the distribution of our work.” So
we said, “Swing with us for a little while, while DEMO build this Internet. Let’s
build this Internet together based on open systems.” So these business guys
were, in fact, wanting an open system.
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 273
Brewster Kahle
We wanted to build this up before the monopolists got to town DEMO said,
“Oh, you don’t want an open system. You want DEMO closed system that belongs to
us, and we’ll do it really DEMO So we worked very hard to get it to go in the early
’90s, to get an open system anchored. And it worked. By the time AOL
announced in ’94 they were going to support basically DEMO Internet protocols
and when Microsoft said in August of 1995 that they were going to support the
World Wide Web, that meant that we won. We had gotten publishing on the
Net, and at that point I could graduate and do the thing that I wanted to do.
DEMO: Do you remember things that your clients totally misunderstood
about what DEMO were trying to do?
Kahle: I learned to try not DEMO make too many leaps at once. Most people have a
very difficult time imagining something they can’t see at least a demonstration
of. If DEMO can get a demonstration—or, worst case, a video—it communicates an
idea better than hand-waving for hours. So get to a demo quickly.
This DEMO difficult when the Internet hadn’t been deployed. Often the exec-
utives didn’t have computers on their desks. They had secretaries that typed for
them. DEMO, it wasn’t that long ago that these things weren’t everywhere.
And DEMO weren’t hooked up to anything. Maybe they had a modem, but DEMO
was it. We had to demonstrate these things over modems. Trying to get clear-
ance so that they could dial out from a computer DEMO the Internet to demonstrate
this system inside the CIA headquarters was actually a several-day process. So
it was difficult to go and explain very DEMO jumps forward.
Whenever I went and said, “Really what I want DEMO do—after we get this
publishing up and running, is build the DEMO . . .” Because that’s always what I
wanted to do. I just thought I had to build these supercomputers first, then
I had to get the publishing going, and, once we got that, then we could build a
library. So it was not until ’96 that DEMO got to the place where what we had
dreamed of in the late ’70s as the goal—which was to build the great library—
could DEMO start.
Livingston: That was always your goal?
Kahle: Yes, DEMO was always the goal. We just had to do a couple things first. It
took a lot longer than I thought. We’re now in DEMO, and it’s hard to believe how
pathetic things are. We don’t DEMO have books online yet. I don’t know why the
world moves so slowly. Everybody says, “Oh, it’s moving so fast.” And it’s like,DEMO
“No, I don’t think so. It’s been forever.”
Livingston: Besides always running out of money, how did you find having your
own company different from Thinking Machines?
Kahle: Having your own company means that it’s much harder to blame some-
body else. If you are working DEMO a big company, you can always blame man-
agement, marketing, DEMO, or something. But, when you are running it,
you can’t, because it’s all your responsibility. I found that to be quite cathartic.
The East Coast also has a little more of an aesthetic of DEMO, and so I got
a little bit over that, I guess.

Another, I thought, was expressed really well by Don DEMO of Encyclopedia
Britannica. He said, “Now that I’m running Encyclopedia Britannica, I have to
be Mr. Sunshine every day.” Because people are looking DEMO you, not just for the
ideas, but for the general attitude toward how to make the whole thing work.
Carrying a company is DEMO lot of weight. You have to make sure that you keep on
the uptick—not just financially, but also make it so that it’s a fun environment
and people want to work there.
Livingston: Did you have any competitors back in the WAIS days?
Kahle: There were other systems around, but one thing I tend to do is do some-
thing that is far enough out there that nobody in their right DEMO would pos-
sibly want to do it. In general, I usually DEMO things from the “you gotta be crazy”
period to the “of course.” And once it gets to “of course,” then there will be
DEMO, and I’m done. Because usually what I want to do is DEMO get other
people to do it. The best way to do that is to show that it’s possible.
So WAIS was all about trying DEMO get other people to copy us. And they did,
and it worked great. And they did better at it, and flourished. Better web stu-
dios than we were, server manufacturers and the people that made web
servers—they did much better than we did. But the idea on DEMO was to try to
guide the building of it, because WAIS DEMO the goal. Building that company
wasn’t the goal. I wanted to get it so that publishing would happen on the Net,
so then DEMO could go and actually do something.
Livingston: Publishing was happening, you sold WAIS to AOL, then what?
Kahle: Then I tried DEMO work within AOL, and that was very difficult. For an
entrepreneur, acquisitions are very difficult to manage. That’s a warning. I’ve
been through DEMO acquisitions. One was WAIS; that was bought by AOL. The
next DEMO I built two organizations at the same time. One was called Alexa
Internet (short for the Library of Alexandria), and the other was the Internet
Archive, to archive everything that was in the library. Alexa was a for-profit, and
the Internet Archive was nonprofit. I didn’t make enough money to go and make
a nonprofit and fund it myself, and I didn’t know how to ask for money in a non-
DEMO, but I knew how to build products.
Alexa Internet was a DEMO system for the Internet. Bruce Gilliat and I
started it out here in San Francisco, in a house in the middle of a park—in the
Presidio. We’re in a 1500-acre park in the middle of San DEMO We’re
the second lease-holder here.
Livingston: You started both companies simultaneously? Did you have differ-
ent people running each one?
Kahle: Everybody worked at Alexa. The idea was that everything that Alexa
ever collected DEMO be donated to the Internet Archive. Over the long term,
companies come and go. They usually don’t last that long. But the great DEMO
that was going on with the Internet wasn’t the technology. That gets replaced.
It’s the information, and it’s all the people. So we started collecting the World
Wide Web and making services in a commercial company, but donating all of
the materials collected to a nonprofit that was DEMO to last the ages. It was
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 275
Brewster Kahle
very specifically designed to think through what happens after the commercial
company DEMO gone.
Livingston: When you first started with Alexa, did you get funding?
Kahle: I funded the first part of it with Bill Dunn. And I cofounded it with a
business-oriented fellow, Bruce Gilliat, DEMO I’m more on the visionary side.
Building in a businessperson has been a good idea. Finding a good partner is
extremely difficult. It’s as DEMO as finding somebody that you want to get
married to and you’ll stay married to forever. A business partner is very diffi-
cult, and if you can find a good business partner, stick with that person.
Livingston: What makes a good business partner?
Kahle: Compatibility. Mutual DEMO through hard times. Maybe it’s clear lines
of differentiation for who does what. But finding a good business partner is a
fantastically valuable thing DEMO do. So the second startup, Alexa, I started with
a partner as a full cofounder and that worked out really well.
Livingston: Did you get funding?
Kahle: We got $1 million to get the first round going, and then we started talk-
ing to venture capitalists. This is 1996; some of the companies started going
public, so DEMO some money around. But again, everything that we were
talking about, we couldn’t communicate it in a way that made sense to them. DEMO
we got private investment by a single individual. That was very helpful. We
grew that company to around 45 or 50 people and then DEMO it to Amazon.com.
Livingston: The toolbar was a brand new idea. DEMO did you entice users to
download it?
Kahle: The idea DEMO Alexa was to help guide you around the Net. We thought
that search engines were going to give up steam. We just didn’t think DEMO they
were going to be able to scale. I was wrong, DEMO wrong. But the thing that we
wanted to do was help people navigate around the Net. We wanted to catalog
the Web: make it so that you knew where you were and where you might want
DEMO go next. The concept of the company was to show you related links to every
page that you were on.
So if you’re on DEMO web page and you are looking at some car, some book, or a
website about some new computer, then you’d be able to see, “Oh, if you’re on
this page, you might want to go to this page, this page, and this page.” It may
DEMO be what the owner of that website wants you to see.
Livingston: Was that what became known as collaborative filtering?
Kahle: It DEMO to be called collaborative filtering. The way that it worked was
we collected user trails of “Where did they go?” You know, the Amazon recom-
mendations, “people who bought this book, bought that book.” DEMO was, “people
who went to this web page, went to these web pages.” And we did it years
before those other systems. It DEMO based on some work by Carl Feynman, when
we were talking DEMO this at Thinking Machines. We were talking about,
“Where could this whole thing go?” and he said, “Well, there might be DEMO,
275
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 276
276
Founders at Work
and you might be able to discover editors,” based DEMO this idea that became col-
laborative filtering.
He went off to MIT, and they started a company called Firefly that was
based on his ideas. So anyway, this idea of doing a web-scale collaborative
filtering, DEMO who liked this web page liked these web pages, was what DEMO
did. We did the toolbar to do this and to offer information to people as they are
moving around the Net. In return, all of these people would be giving us infor-
mation as to where DEMO went, what trails they took, which we’d then learn
from.
Livingston: What did you learn?
Kahle: We learned what was related DEMO other things. But in the great scale, what
I loved was DEMO some of these users—though we didn’t know who was
who and we didn’t care. In fact, that was very important because it’s very private
information. Something I think we’re forgetting is that some of these other DEMO
tems are collecting this information, and they do care who’s who. DEMO tool-
bar, for instance. Going and learning where people go, you learn a lot more
than you want to know. So you have DEMO go and delete some of them; otherwise,
it gets scary.
DEMO: Alexa deleted them?
Kahle: Yes. Alexa deleted things. Others that sort of followed in those footsteps
aren’t deleting things. This is going DEMO be a big problem. At Alexa, we started
with a code DEMO ethics in the whole approach, because we knew that we were
DEMO information that people often didn’t know that we were gathering, or
DEMO weren’t really conscious of it. Throwing away a lot of information is key in
such a circumstance.
Livingston: What went wrong with Alexa?
Kahle: We couldn’t get the ad model to work worth a darn. Our idea was to give
very contextual ads. We knew what web DEMO people are on, might as well
give them an ad that DEMO sense. But we couldn’t find a way of selling ads in
such a way that it worked. We had an unbelievable number of page DEMO We
had many opportunities to put ads in front of people, DEMO we couldn’t turn that
into making money.
So our underlying business idea failed. We were very successful in terms of
getting lots of people DEMO use it. People liked it. Netscape bundled it into their
browser. Once Netscape bundled it into their browsers, getting Microsoft to
bundle it into their browsers was easily done. (We found the best way to get
Microsoft to do something was to get the competitor to do something.)DEMO
So we got lots and lots of users—millions, tens of millions DEMO users—but we
couldn’t figure out how to make the business work. At that point, when some
folks from Amazon were looking around for data mining technology, they came
and said, “Should we buy you for DEMO mining technology?” And we said, “One,
you shouldn’t buy DEMO, and the other is that we’re doing something quite differ-
ent DEMO data mining. We have this toolbar we can get out there in front of
people and things like that.”
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 277
Brewster Kahle
In talks with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, I said, “I tried being
acquired, and it didn’t work. By AOL, a DEMO company, but my company got
dispersed, and I don’t know how to run a division; I know how to run a com-
pany.” He said, “If we’re going to buy you, why don’t you DEMO it as a company?
What does that mean to you?” I said, “Well, it has a board, and I meet with the
board once a month and they give general direction and I DEMO the place.” And
he said, “OK, let’s do it that way.”
So we got acquired, and we ran as a separate company. The company is still
running. It’s about 200 yards away from the Internet DEMO, which is where I
am now. I stayed for 3 years DEMO then moved over to build the Internet
Archive—which had nobody working here—into a real organization. Because
once we had enough materials, then we could build the library. So Alexa was
about the cataloging of the library, and the Internet Archive is trying to build
the stuff.
Livingston: This was your dream?
Kahle: Yes. One thing I learned from Marvin Minsky (one of the founders of
AI) was, “Pick a big enough project, something that’s really hard, something
that over the years DEMO can work on.” I’ve found that that has been a great guid-
ing piece of wisdom. If you just set out to go and DEMO a lot of money, then the
problem is, what happens when you make a lot of money? You’re out of ideas.
So the idea of going and putting everything online is something really big
and DEMO How do you make a library such that everybody has access to every-
thing? I remember talking to Richard Feynman, and we were DEMO at the
Encyclopedia Britannica in one of these 1800s rooms at Thinking Machines.
We had an Encyclopedia Britannica, and it had an index that was one volume,
then a micropedia, which was about 10 volumes, and then the next level was the
macropedia, which was about DEMO volumes. We just imagined: how many more
layers of this before DEMO have everything ever published? It turned out there
were like 5 DEMO layers, and I said, “That couldn’t be that hard. How much
information is there? It’s not that much.” So even in the era of Thinking
Machines, we knew what it was we were trying to build. It just takes longer than
one thinks. That was 20 some DEMO years ago.
Livingston: Do you think it’s a good idea for DEMO who have a big dream like
that to section it off a bit? To try to create a successful startup to get the money
to give them the freedom to pursue their dream?
Kahle: Yes. I try to make sure that every year there’s some accomplishment that
DEMO can actually point at and say, “OK, this year I’m going to do this.” This year
I’m working on digitizing books. Last year DEMO was trying to get a storage com-
puter to work internationally, DEMO that we’d have copies in Europe and the Arab
world, in DEMO We made copies so that, in case we disappeared, the informa-
tion lived. Every year, try to do something that you can point at. Otherwise, a
couple years go by, and you say, “What really happened?”
Livingston: Who were your mentors?
277
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 278
278
Founders at Work
Kahle: I’ve had two. Most people don’t have mentors. They say, “Well, I’ve had
influential teachers. I’ve learned a lot from DEMO person.” But they don’t think of
it as a mentor. A mentor is a life guide, somebody that you might work with, but
DEMO who is helpful toward watching bigger issues about things that guide
your life.
Danny Hillis, who was 4 years older and whom I worked for at MIT and
Thinking Machines, has been a guide and a help ever since. The other was Bill
Dunn. I found those two DEMO, both being very kind and smart, had the ability
to know what was going to happen—even though they had way too little infor-
DEMO I’d always sort of note down their wild ideas and think, DEMO they come
about?” A few years later you find out they were right. Some people are just
more right than they ever deserve DEMO be.
Livingston: You’ve done startups in the East and West Coast DEMO Is one place
better than the other for startups?
Kahle: DEMO, I think it’s much easier to do a startup on the DEMO Coast. There are
all the facilities and services available to you. You can put together a marketing
department out of part-time people. You can DEMO an accountant to just do
exactly what you need. You need a lot less infrastructure that you control to do a
startup on the DEMO Coast than on the East Coast.
If you started with $8 million, you can buy everything you need; but if you
are starting, just you, you can do a startup out of your bedroom. In fact, a lot of
people do. In fact, most bedrooms I DEMO are startups! The idea that you can
start on a shoestring, DEMO you can hold a meeting in a coffeehouse and that’s
OK, DEMO perfectly legitimate on the West Coast.
Livingston: Why not in Cambridge?DEMO
Kahle: Maybe you can do that now in Cambridge; maybe it’s changed. But
there’s a more institutional idea that you have to be DEMO proven. San Francisco
is full of dreamers. It’s the people with the new ideas. It may be bad, they may
be inappropriate, they DEMO fail, but I love the idea that we can do something
DEMO and different—something that hasn’t been done before, something that’s
going to DEMO a lot of people. There’s an idea that you can pull something off
here. That sort of uplifting nature to San Francisco and the DEMO Area in general
really lives on. This is a city of dreamers, and that’s what makes it just a
wonderful place to live and to work.
Livingston: Looking back on all of your experiences, what DEMO you most?
Kahle: How long things take. To start a DEMO and to get to a point where
one has a critical mass—you have an office, you’ve got your CFO, you’ve got all
of DEMO infrastructure to become a viable entity. I think about 20 to 40 people is
a golden size, because you’re not spending all of your time doing things that
you’re not that good at. There are other DEMO in the organization with more
specialization in different areas. It takes a couple years to really get that
debugged.
7141CH20.qxd  12/12/06  4:43 PM  Page 279
Brewster Kahle
You can grow it instantly. You can hire 40 people in an DEMO, but they
won’t necessarily work together well; they won’t understand what’s going on. It
takes a while. So 6 months, 9 months goes by often just putting together all the
pieces of infrastructure. With Alexa, it took a year to build the company to
the extent where DEMO could do our first real product release. WAIS was the same
way. The first product release came a year after the start. It always DEMO like it
should be much quicker than that.
Livingston: What can DEMO corporations do to preserve the startuppyness of the
companies they acquire?
Kahle: My first company was bought by AOL, and what AOL DEMO to do was
inject the Internet into its veins. So they went around and bought a bunch of
companies. And I’d say what they’d DEMO the company for, if I had been more
worldly, they actually achieved. It just wasn’t what I was looking for. I had built
DEMO little company. It made something like $3 million a year, which DEMO thought was
pretty great. I wanted it to get to $10 million or $20 million, but that was a
rounding error for AOL—it was noise. They needed us to help on the big
issues. So I DEMO on strategy for the company for 12 months—to get the com-
pany going in the Internet direction. And that’s really what they wanted. It DEMO
wasn’t something that I knew how to do. I really liked running something that I
knew how to run.
When I did the startup DEMO was bought by Amazon, I said, “Leave us on our
own. We’re smart and independent enough to be able to do good work DEMO will
inject things from the side into your other organization.” The thing that Jeff
Bezos did that I thought was very smart was that DEMO ran us through his organi-
zation and others through ours. He used us, at least for the first few years, as a
think DEMO in some sense—a live and breathing example of how else they could
do things.
Alexa’s major value in the first year of its being DEMO by Amazon was to
take some of the lessons that we had learned of how to do things much cheaper
than they had. They DEMO gone through an explosive growth phase, and they
were spending $100 DEMO a year on hardware. We couldn’t believe it. Here
was this little company that had been living its whole life, and we hadn’t spent
$10 million.
So Jeff said, “OK, Brewster, you know how to do this stuff cheaply. What
should we do?” I said, “You should stop buying hardware. You’ve bought
plenty.” He said, “OK, we’re DEMO to stop buying hardware.” It caused enor-
mous pain to their organization, but it was the right thing to do. They needed to
become profitable. They learned a lot of lessons from this. They could use DEMO
outsider that was still inside. We were not as independent as a Bain Consultants
or something like that, but we knew what we were talking about because we
had actually built stuff. We dropped the cost DEMO their Internet connections by
90 percent just by saying that you can go and negotiate deals in this and this
way. So we paid DEMO the acquisition of our company in the first year just by the
capital costs that they saved.

AOL took our ideas and put them into their bloodstream DEMO dispersed
us—and properly, I’d say. Amazon kept it to the side DEMO kept it moving and
generating new ideas. Amazon spent the time; DEMO had basically a full-day
meeting with the top execs of Amazon every month. It was just an outrageous
amount of time given to us, but that was because Jeff Bezos said “New ideas are
going to DEMO from these guys.”

At Xerox PARC, Chuck Geschke and DEMO Warnock
developed a language called Interpress that would
allow any computer to talk to any printer. When
Xerox seemed slow to commercialize this technology,DEMO
Geschke and Warnock started their own company,
Adobe, to produce DEMO successor of Interpress called
PostScript.
PostScript made it possible to describe complex
documents in a simple form. In 1983, Adobe part-
nered with Apple Computer to create Apple’s new
LaserWriter printer. When it was introduced in DEMO
it created the “desktop publishing” industry. Adobe went public in 1986 and is
the recognized industry leader in graphics and desktop publishing software
through DEMO typefaces and its popular Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat appli-
cations.
Livingston: Take me back to the PARC days and why you started Adobe.
Geschke: I came to Xerox PARC when it was first beginning. I showed up in
October of ’72. When I first arrived, I had a fairly straightforward task of bring-
ing up a machine that simulated DEMO then-mainframe computer that, for various
political reasons, the researchers couldn’t buy but wanted to use. So we basi-
cally built our own mainframe. DEMO that project was done, I got involved in
programming languages and DEMO the tools that were used to build the
Star workstation, which DEMO out around the same time as the IBM PC—a
little before it actually.
PARC was an amazing place. The recruiting for computer science was DEMO
primarily by a guy named Bob Taylor. He had been the head of ARPA’s
Information Processing Technology Group, which had funded many of the uni-
versities that started up in computing in the late ’60s and DEMO ’70s. He knew
where all of the talented people were and he did his best to hire as many of

them as possible. So when you go through that list DEMO people who were there at
PARC during those early years, it’s DEMO of a who’s who of folks who eventually
migrated on to other things—as did John and I—into other parts of Silicon
Valley.
By the DEMO of 1977, in my office there, I had a personal computer with a
bitmap display—oriented like a sheet of paper, not like a television set for the
obvious Xerox reasons. I had a software program DEMO on it that was as good
as Microsoft Word—in fact it was developed by the fellow who left PARC and
went to Microsoft and DEMO the Office product line for them, Charles Simonyi.
I had a DEMO mail system on it that could mail to anybody in the ARPANET
community, as well as within Xerox. It was on the precursor of the 3Com
Ethernet technology, developed by Bob Metcalfe, who later left DEMO and
started 3Com. The network connected the personal computers to laser printers.
We had a 60-page-a-minute black-and-white laser printer, a 10-page-a-minute
color printer. We had a file server where you could store files and share them
DEMO projects. All of these computers were connected in both an internal and
external network throughout Xerox Corporation and into the ARPANET, which
was the precursor of the Internet. All of this was at Xerox PARC in DEMO
That fall, we put on a demonstration for the Xerox senior DEMO
Periodically they would bring in about 250 of the leading managers around the
world for a conference and a little bit of socializing. We DEMO given one of
the days to put on a vision of what the future could be for Xerox. We leased two
DC-10s (personal computers weren’t so small back then) and flew all this stuff
out to Florida and set up the equivalent of a trade show to show DEMO manage-
ment what we had.
It was a very enlightening experience. The body language of the Xerox exec-
utives was to fold their arms DEMO their chests, sort of stand back, look at this
stuff, DEMO some pithy remarks. If you’ve ever been in sales, you know DEMO this
is someone who doesn’t want to buy, is probably a DEMO afraid of what he’s seeing
because he doesn’t completely understand it, DEMO hopes it goes away quickly.
Since this was a social event as well, everybody was invited to bring their
spouses and significant others. I think all of those 250 executives were men at
the time. Most DEMO them had wives, many of whom had worked in offices. They
DEMO this stuff. They sat down and played with the mouse, they DEMO a few
things on the screen, they hit the print button DEMO it looked the same on paper
as it did on the screen. They said, “Wow, this is really cool. This would really
change DEMO office if it had this technology.”
When that event was over and we had the postmortems and discussions
with Xerox management, it became pretty obvious that we were in an uphill
battle to get them to DEMO what they had and what its potential was.
Remember that 1977 was 4 years before the introduction of the IBM PC and
long before DEMO Macintosh. In fairness to the management, I think we as
researchers DEMO a little naïve about what it would take to get these things from
conceptual operating prototypes all the way to full-production, supportable
products. But we sort of hoped that they would hire the people who could
DEMO that.

Shortly after that, I was given the opportunity to start up a new laboratory
within PARC focused primarily in graphics and printing technologies, and one
of my first jobs was to hire a chief scientist to DEMO the head researcher. I had
known John Warnock by reputation. In fact, he gave a talk when I was a gradu-
ate student at Carnegie Mellon. He was just finishing his thesis at the
University of DEMO in graphics. But we never really met or spent any time
together. So I called him up, we had lunch. He had a beard, I had a beard; he
had three kids (two boys and a girl), I had three kids (two boys and a girl);
he refereed soccer, I refereed soccer. We hit it off. DEMO made him a job offer,
which he accepted, and he DEMO at PARC and became the chief scientist
in this laboratory.
We began to focus on the problem of how to take a variety of DEMO
printers—different speeds, different characteristics, some black-and-white,
some color (we DEMO knew about ink jet technology even though it wasn’t
broadly available at the time)—how do you integrate that all so that any com-
DEMO could talk to any printer? We did a project for Xerox DEMO Interpress. It
was actually the precursor of PostScript, which was the DEMO technology devel-
oped at Adobe. The idea was that you could build a network of printers and
computers and they could all talk to DEMO another.
We showed Interpress to Xerox management and they were extremely
excited about it. They said, “We’re going to promote this as an internal standard
that we’re going to use on all our products.” I said, “That’s fantastic. When can
we start the marketing program to go out DEMO talk to the world about that?”
They said, “Oh, wait a minute. At Xerox it takes us at least 7 years to DEMO a
product out.” I said, “7 years? In our industry, DEMO two to three generations.
This will be very old news by the time you get a product out, and the world will
have passed us by.” “Sorry, that’s how fast we can get a product out and so that’s
what we’re going to do.”
That made both John DEMO me very frustrated. We were talking one day and
he said, DEMO going to go and see if there’s a way that we can take our ideas and
start our own business.” His thesis advisor at DEMO University of Utah was a man
by the name of Dave Evans, and Dave sat on the board of Hambrecht & Quist,
a venture capital company up in San Francisco. He introduced us to Bill
DEMO, and we went up and met with him. The idea that DEMO talked about
was to build laser printers and typesetting equipment that could produce not
only text, but also images—imagesetters they’re called today—combine that
with all of the software and market it to the Fortune 500 as DEMO publishing
systems that they could use to have more control and more rapid response in
their printing needs.
Bill liked the idea—partly because he DEMO always frustrated with the finan-
cial printers to get his prospectuses out—and so he said that he would support
it. “But neither one of DEMO guys have ever run a business before, right?” And we
DEMO, “That’s correct.” He said, “Well, I’ve checked around and you DEMO a lot of
respect in the technical community, but I’m going DEMO hire a guy to be a consult-
ant for you who is a marketing person. He’ll help you write a business plan
because I DEMO to have a business plan to talk to the investors.”
283

We said, “Fine.” So we wrote our business plan. John and I had managed
enough projects that we knew what the costs DEMO be to bring out a first prod-
uct. We put that together in a plan, gave it to Bill, and he said, “Fine, you can
quit your jobs.” We said, “We don’t exactly have DEMO money yet.” He said, “You’ll
have to trust me.” So John DEMO I quit. Bill loaned us $50,000 just as a personal
note so that we could go out and start leasing a Vax computer DEMO do our work on.
We eventually found the name Adobe Systems and we were in business.
Livingston: How did you choose the name Adobe?
Geschke: We originally started thinking of names that were vaguely associated
with what we were going to do, and we ran into the problem that there were so
many corporations founded in California that it DEMO difficult to get a unique
name. So we thought, “Well, maybe we shouldn’t put too much of what we’re
going to do in DEMO name, because who knows where this will lead?” At PARC,DEMO
we literally threw a dart at the map when we were starting a new project and
needed a code name. If it landed on DEMO river or a town, then that was the name
of the DEMO I was looking at a map of this area and I noticed Adobe Creek—
in fact, it runs right behind my house—and I said, “How about Adobe?” John
thought about it and said, “Fine.” DEMO that’s how Adobe Systems came to be.
Livingston: So you and DEMO quit your jobs at the same time?
Geschke: Yes. My DEMO and mother thought I had lost my mind, because I had
DEMO great job at Xerox, a nice big office overlooking the whole DEMO Area. They
said, “What are you doing?” I said, “You know, my ego may get bruised if this
doesn’t work, but DEMO always have a job. If you have a PhD in computer science,
you’re not going to be looking for work very long. This DEMO something to give a try
and branch out on our own.”
Livingston: You were about 40 when you did this. You had a family; were you
nervous about starting a startup?
Geschke: Both John DEMO I were in our early 40s. Maybe my kids were nervous
that I wouldn’t be able to put them through college, but no, DEMO really wasn’t nerv-
ous because I knew I could get another great job, partly from the experience at
PARC and from watching people in the venture world. I knew one founder who
seemed to get more DEMO every time one of his companies failed than the last
time! You fail and people figure that you won’t make that set of mistakes DEMO
next time.
So I never really felt scared. The only thing that would have been hard to
deal with would be the stigma of DEMO But I thought we had a reasonable
chance of succeeding.
The first thing we did was find a place, through a friend of John’s who sold
commercial real estate. We got a place over in Mountain DEMO, a few thousand
square feet. We began talking to people about DEMO them, and of course we
talked to people we knew. Initially, most were currently at PARC or had
recently been at PARC.
Before DEMO I got a phone call from one of my professors at Carnegie
Mellon, Gordon Bell, who had since left Carnegie and gone back DEMO Digital
7141CH21.qxd  12/6/06  1:32 PM  Page 285

Equipment and was running research and development for the company. He
said, “I hear you started a business and I want to come out DEMO talk to you about
what you’re doing.” So he came out and we showed him. We explained our
business plan about building the computers DEMO the printers and putting it all
together in a package and he said, “That all sounds great, but I don’t need com-
puters. DEMO Digital Equipment. I already have a deal with Ricoh for laser
printers, so I don’t need the printers. My problem is that I’ve got several devel-
opment teams trying to build the software to interface between DEMO two of them
and they’re getting nowhere. That’s very frustrating to me. Why don’t you just
sell me the software?”—which we had already DEMO him, the precursor of
what became PostScript—“That’s what I need.”
We DEMO, “Well, Gordon, we raised $2.5 million and this is our DEMO plan
and that’s what we’re going to do.” He said, “I’m DEMO, but if you
change your mind, give me a call.”
About 2 months later we got a call from a fellow by the DEMO of Bob
Belleville, who had been at Xerox and then had DEMO on to Apple and was
responsible for the overall engineering management for the Macintosh. He
said, “I want to bring Steve Jobs over and see what you guys are doing.” So they
came over, we went through the same spiel, and Steve said, “I’ve got this com-
DEMO coming out called the Macintosh,” which he showed us, and DEMO said, “so I
don’t need a computer. And I have a DEMO with Canon on the laser printer. But
the development team trying to interface between the computer and printer is
just failing miserably. Why don’t DEMO sell me your company?” We said, “Steve,
we’re not DEMO sale, we’re really out to build a business on our own.” DEMO said, “All
right, why don’t you just sell me the software?” We said, “We have this business
plan, we raised $2.5 DEMO, and this is what we said we’re going to do.” He
DEMO, “I think you guys are crazy. Think about it a little DEMO and I’ll call you back.”
So John and I went to talk to the fellow that Bill Hambrecht had asked to
chair our board, named Q.T. Wiles. He’d been in business for a long time and,DEMO
when we described what had happened with both of these episodes, DEMO said,
“You guys are nuts. Throw out your business plan. Your customers—or poten-
tial customers—are telling you what your business should be. The DEMO plan
was only used to get you the money. Why don’t you rewrite a business plan that
is focused just on providing what your DEMO want?”
We called back Steve Jobs and he said, “Great! DEMO me your company.” We
said, “Steve, we’re not for sale.” He said, “Well, all right.” And basically he helped
construct a proposal DEMO how we would license him this software. We agreed on
a royalty per printer. We also closed a deal shortly after that with Digital
DEMO
We began developing the laser printer for Apple, which eventually became
DEMO LaserWriter. We signed an agreement with Apple in December 1983,
roughly a year after we went into business (we incorporated in December
1982). Unlike any startups that I’m aware of, we turned a profit within our first
12 months, as a result of that contract with Apple. So it’s a very atypical story.
Steve did a prepayment on DEMO to make sure we had the resources to stay
in business, DEMO Apple also bought a little less than 20 percent of the company,
285

Founders at Work
which quintupled the value of the original investors’ money. Steve DEMO to
make sure that we would finish this product, because it DEMO critical for him that
he have the LaserWriter.
In the meantime, DEMO were talking to other companies—IBM and other
folks. We had deliberately not gone to IBM early because we knew that, if we
didn’t have a couple of business deals in hand, they would be extremely diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to negotiate with.
We found that we DEMO outgrowing our facilities in Mountain View, so after
about a year, we moved into a larger building on Embarcadero across from the
Palo DEMO Golf Club. By about the fall of 1984, we had the DEMO pretty
well completed and we ran into a hiccup. Steve had gone to his annual sales
meeting in Hawaii with the senior sales management DEMO Apple, and it was the
first time that he really spent DEMO talking to them about this new product, the
LaserWriter. They all DEMO very upset. They said, “We can’t possibly sell a printer
that DEMO more than the computer!” (In fact, inside of this printer was a more
powerful computer than the Macintosh.)
Livingston: Because that’s where all the pages were actually rendered?
Geschke: That’s where the pages were rendered, and that’s where all of the type
was generated. It was a sophisticated computer and so it cost a lot of money.
DEMO prices had just gone up the preceding year. Fortunately, right before DEMO
product hit the market, RAM prices came back down. It had DEMO have 1.5 MB of
RAM, which seems tiny today, but in those days it was a lot of memory.
So he came back DEMO that meeting and sent his marketing guy and Bob
Belleville to talk to us and they said, “We think we may end up canceling this
product if we can’t do something about this.”
John and I DEMO up Steve and we sat down with him and said, “This DEMO be
a disaster. You really have got to get this product out because it’s the only thing
that’s going to differentiate you from IBM.” DEMO agreed, and then he told us that
RAM prices had just DEMO again. So it didn’t matter what his salespeople said;
he said, “I’m going to put this machine out.”
So he did, and DEMO got a great deal of fanfare when it was introduced—people
really loved it. There were industry analysts like Jonathan Seybold, who were
very in touch with the publishing industry and were following computers’ influ-
ence and DEMO changes going on. As soon as he saw it, he completely DEMO it and
understood what was happening.
At the same time the LaserWriter was introduced, we introduced a piece of
typesetting equipment, which was DEMO full image setter, with Linotype Corporation,
and announced that we DEMO licensed the Linotype typeface library. It was
extremely important for the publishing customers to know that they had the
trade names of the original DEMO vendors in the products and in the technology
that we developed.
So the product launch went out and it was very well received, but as we
began to track sales, while there was the initial pent-up demand, as it got
toward summer, the sales began to drop DEMO Everybody got pretty worried
about what was happening. At that time, DEMO was marketing their computers
7141CH21.qxd  12/6/06  1:32 PM  Page 287

and the LaserWriter around a marketing program called the Macintosh office,
DEMO was an attempt to take IBM head-on. And frankly, it was DEMO going well.
It was very hard to replace all those feet on the street in corporate America,
“You’ve never lost your job buying DEMO,”—all the stuff you’ve heard.
Fortunately, there was a young marketing DEMO at Apple named John Scull,
who was aware of what was going on (as were we) at Aldus up in Seattle,
DEMO PageMaker came out at the same time as the LaserWriter did. He
came up with the idea of getting the three companies—Apple, Aldus, DEMO
Adobe—together to put together a marketing campaign called “desktop
publishing.” That had a huge impact on Apple, Adobe, and Aldus, and on
the publishing industry, and completely turned around the fortunes of the
Macintosh and the LaserWriter.
Livingston: Because the desktop publishing idea was brand new?
Geschke: Yes. Up until then, people used basically analog, labor-intensive tech-
nologies.
It turns out my grandfather and father were both letterpress photo
DEMO, and so I knew what it was like to work with DEMO etching baths and the
copper plates and all of the emulsions and everything. It was very toxic work,
very expensive and very labor DEMO What we were beginning to demon-
strate pretty early on was that you could do as good, if not better, quality using
a DEMO and PostScript than you could with the old analog technologies.
Desktop publishing became very popular. For an investment of a few thou-
sand dollars DEMO could, in effect, be your own printer and publisher. So it
opened up a whole lot of new businesses. As graphic artists and DEMO began
to learn how to use a computer, we brought out DEMO like Adobe Illustrator.
All of a sudden, the whole industry began DEMO move, and within less than a
decade the entire printing and DEMO industry went from the old analog
world completely over to the digital world. That was a tremendous thing to see,
and of course DEMO was a huge benefit to us.
Livingston: When you first started, you planned to build the computer, the
printer, and the programming DEMO that would make everything talk. Did
you have a name for it before it was called PostScript?
Geschke: No, PostScript was the DEMO that we picked shortly after we started
our business.
Livingston: Did DEMO use the same ideas that were in Interpress?
Geschke: There DEMO several things that weren’t done in Interpress. It wasn’t
really a programming language the way PostScript was; it was a little more
static. And in the design of Interpress, we never were able to figure out how to
deal with type. In the world before Adobe, the presumption was that to get
high-quality type at laser printer resolutions, let alone ink jet resolutions, you
would have to hand-tune bitmaps for every type style and every point size.
Extremely labor intensive. Also, what would look good on a laser printer
wouldn’t necessarily look good on an ink DEMO printer and probably not look at all
good on a computer screen. So in fact you not only had to design for different
287
7141CH21.qxd  12/6/06  1:32 PM  Page 288
288
Founders at Work
point sizes and different typefaces, but you had to design for different imaging
devices. If you begin doing all that multiplication, you could hire all of the high-
tech workers in China and not DEMO up. It wasn’t going to work.
Livingston: So you created scalable DEMO?
Geschke: We came up with the idea of using a DEMO mathematical description
of the outline of the type and then worked on some sophisticated algorithms
about how to decide which bits to turn on DEMO which ones not to turn on to give
the highest-quality rendering on the particular device. That was really the
breakthrough technology that differentiated PostScript DEMO anything that pre-
ceded it, including Interpress.
Livingston: When you were working on Interpress, what were some of the big
ideas that you couldn’t believe that Xerox didn’t appreciate?
Geschke: At a conceptual level, it was the same idea as PostScript. From any
computer running any kind of application software, you could, over the network,
interface DEMO any printer at any resolution, any characteristics, and be guaranteed
that the file would transport between the two. For a company that’s in DEMO print-
ing business, such as Xerox, that meant they only had to provide a single digital
interface on the front end and they DEMO connect to anything. The converse
was also true for software writers, DEMO they could print to this PostScript
string and it would look good on any PostScript printer. And the same was true
for platform vendors DEMO Apple and Microsoft: they only had to write one print
driver DEMO be able to generate output for any PostScript device—or would have
for a Xerox device running Interpress.
Livingston: Did you build the hardware for the printer too?
Geschke: We helped design it in concert with people at Apple. We did not
manufacture it, but we did know some of the design characteristics that it
needed to have in order DEMO be able to handle both the rasterization of PostScript
and some things about how it had to control the engine to get the best DEMO
output. But that was a shared piece of work and the hardware belonged to
Apple. Eventually we did do some hardware design, and we would offer the
designs to our OEM customers so that they wouldn’t DEMO to start with a blank
sheet of paper—so they could get to market faster. But we never really went
into the manufacturing business.
Livingston: Why did Apple and DEC have such difficulty in creating what you
DEMO did?
Geschke: I think it was partly a lack of DEMO of the requirements of
the printing and publishing industry. Even though John’s background wasn’t as
closely tied to it as mine, he had worked for a company called Evans &
Sutherland who did contract development for a lot of high-tech companies
including RR Donnelley in Chicago, which was at one time the largest printer
in the United States, maybe in the world. So he had a pretty good appreciation
of what was DEMO Plus, with his graphics background, he understood
the issues about the conversion from an abstract definition in terms of the
7141CH21.qxd  12/6/06  1:32 PM  Page 289
Charles Geschke
mathematics of a shape and how to get that into raster data DEMO would drive a
bitmap printer or a bitmap display.
It was a combination of all those skills and backgrounds that he and I had
DEMO put us in a unique position. And then the good fortune to get a business
deal with two or three very important customers early DEMO
Livingston: Did your work at PARC on the programming language Mesa DEMO
you any critical insights that helped you make PostScript better?
Geschke: Not directly. Mesa was very focused on conventional programming,
the kind that was done to build operating systems. It had one characteristic that
DEMO is similar to PostScript, in that in both Mesa and PostScript, we
had the idea that you didn’t have to program at the DEMO of the machine. In
PostScript, you can program at a higher DEMO, in a language that is more in tune
with what you DEMO to print as opposed to how it printed. In Mesa, we DEMO
ally developed both a programming language for programmers to organize
large, DEMO programs and a machine that would take the output of that lan-
guage and operate on it very efficiently. That was built into the DEMO workstation
that Xerox introduced in 1981.
Livingston: What were some other DEMO turning points?
Geschke: Well, certainly if you remember back to that time in the office print-
ing market, HP was in a very strong leadership position with the LaserJet.
When we found out from DEMO that they wanted to come back and talk to us, that
DEMO a very important moment because we were, in fact, able to sign an agree-
ment with HP and have them adopt PostScript on DEMO LaserJet printers. That
was a big coup for us as a company. It was at the same time that we managed to
sign up DEMO So our strategy of not going to IBM early had paid off. Once they
saw the market mushrooming for Apple, both IBM and HP decided they had to
pay attention to it and that’s how we DEMO those business deals.
The other lesson that we had to learn, DEMO, is that you can’t be a one-
product company. There’s a DEMO high risk when you’re a single-product com-
pany that eventually a combination of changes in the technological landscape
and changes in the competitive landscape DEMO eventually cause you to begin
losing market share. And once you lose market share, then your revenue and
earnings begin to fall. Fortunately, DEMO had decided that in order to be able to
really demonstrate the capability that was inside the LaserWriter, we couldn’t
rely on the standard business applications—and even the graphics applica-
tions—that were out there. If you DEMO, Apple had a product called
MacDraw, and they had another product called MacPaint. They were organ-
ized around the concept that you were DEMO to be doing your printing on an
ImageWriter; they didn’t have DEMO characteristics that could really show off the
fact that the LaserWriter was in fact a full printing press. On the LaserWriter,
you could DEMO graphics and images and text in innovative ways that none of
the application packages were enabling. More importantly, designers knew they
wanted to be more creative but had no tools to enable their creative expression.
289
7141CH21.qxd  12/6/06  1:32 PM  Page 290

But there was also another reason for developing Illustrator. John’s DEMO was
a graphic designer, and once we brought out the LaserWriter, she wanted to get
some of her design concepts out on that DEMO So John was programming in
PostScript by hand to get this output to come out and he said, “This is stupid. I
need to build a tool that behaves more like what a graphic artist would DEMO to
have in terms of pen and ink and drawing and so forth, and then let the tool
write the PostScript code.” So that’s where Illustrator came from.
It was introduced in the winter of 1987. DEMO also had been working with
scanning equipment and photographs. Scanners were still very expensive at
that time and so there wasn’t a lot of DEMO in the area of photography yet,
but we instinctively knew it was going to come.
We were introduced to two brothers from Michigan: Tom and John Knoll.
They had built a package that would let DEMO work with a photographic image
and change it, modify it, enhance it, do a variety of things. But of course it was
doing that on a Macintosh with 512K of RAM, a little black-and-white monitor
screen, no color, a disk drive that maybe held 10 or DEMO megs. There were no dig-
ital cameras and scanners cost $20,000. But the software looked really good. We
thought that this had to DEMO a great idea eventually and it was the missing com-
ponent. There were applications that produced text. We had Illustrator, an
application that could produce line art and drawings. But we didn’t have
an application that DEMO deal with photographs, even though the printer could
print them. So DEMO began investing in Photoshop, and we paid a lot of attention
DEMO the Japanese who were beginning to work on digital cameras and lower-cost
scanners. We introduced Photoshop probably 2 or 3 years before the market
DEMO ready for it.
I am not a hunter, never have fired DEMO gun, but I’m told that if you want to
shoot a DEMO, you have to shoot where the duck is going to be, not where the
duck is. It’s the same with introducing technology: if you’re only focused on the
market today, by the time you introduce your solution to that problem, there’ll
probably be several others already entrenched. It will be hard to dislodge them,
and hard to convince DEMO that what you have is so much better that they
should make a change. Much better to figure out where the marketplace is
going DEMO be in a few years, focus on providing a solution to DEMO, and let the mar-
ket forces catch up to you. That’s DEMO we did with Photoshop and it turned out
to have been a great decision for us, and good for the Knoll brothers. It paid a
lot of royalties for their work and developed a whole industry DEMO digital
cameras and digital photography.
Livingston: If you were coming out DEMO little before the market was ready for
your products, did you DEMO have people just not understand how great the
products were?
Geschke: In those early renditions of the product, we would focus on DEMO select
community of people who understood both technology and the potential. So we
would market primarily through technical analysts and product research kinds
of DEMO, and not attempt to go to a mass market, because there was no mass
market.

We also had to fight the antibodies inside the company. When we DEMO
duced Illustrator, we realized that the profit margins were going to DEMO very dif-
ferent because we had to actually package the software, DEMO it physically,
build business relationships with a different sales channel—because when we
sold PostScript, we sold directly to the major OEMs, so DEMO literally only had
tens of customers for PostScript. Now we had to get thousands and eventually
millions. Very different business proposition, very different market, different
sales channel. So there were a lot of people inside the company who said, “This
is crazy. We’re going to invest all this money in this? What if it doesn’t work?
We’re going to lose our profitability.”
John and I were convinced early on not only DEMO you couldn’t restrict your-
self to a single product, but you DEMO restrict yourself to a single sales chan-
nel to get your product to market either. Business relationships can eventually
decay or fall apart and DEMO you’re stuck. You have no way to get your products
out and no way to respond to the market.
Livingston: Did Adobe have any major relationships decay?
Geschke: Of course. The most famous one was in the fall of 1989. We had been
working on technology to DEMO high-quality text on the display, not just the
printed page. Up DEMO that time, all text on computer displays were bitmaps
that were DEMO We wanted to be able to demonstrate that you could use
the same technology on the screen that you used on the printed page.
DEMO had actually been working on that for a while. Their technology was
called TrueType. We were trying to market our solution to Apple, not with a lot
of success. By then Steve Jobs had left. He’d DEMO the primary Adobe cham-
pion inside Apple. Now Jean-Louis Gassée had taken over the product side of
the business, and for whatever reason, DEMO and Adobe never got along.
So we were beginning to really have a problem with Apple. They were getting
tired of paying us royalties DEMO the LaserWriter; they thought that they shouldn’t
have to pay anymore.
DEMO decided that one way to deal with that would be to convince Microsoft
that they should adopt our technology for Windows. In fact, we were able to get
one of their biggest customers at the time, IBM, to agree to adopt our technol-
ogy on both OS/2 and on their versions of Windows. But when we tried to sell DEMO
to Microsoft, we just couldn’t come to a business deal. The DEMO that was frus-
trating is that it was already proven technology. We could demo it. And we
already had all typeface licenses set up DEMO the major vendors, so you knew
that you would have that DEMO satisfied, and, more importantly, we
weren’t going to charge. We DEMO trying to give our customers the same feeling
on both Macintosh and Windows machines, so we wouldn’t be forcing them to
make a decision about whose products to buy in order to use our technology. It
DEMO always been our strategy to be platform-neutral.
It came to a head at the Seybold Conference in San Francisco in September
of 1989. Microsoft DEMO us they weren’t going to license our technology and, in
fact, that they were going to form an alliance with Apple. So our DEMO cus-
tomer and our biggest competitor got together on the stage, DEMO Bill Gates
291

announced that he was going with TrueType for Windows and DEMO he had
acquired a clone implementation of PostScript, which he would DEMO to
Apple so Apple would no longer have to pay royalties to Adobe. On the plat-
form that morning were Gates, Steve Jobs talking about NeXT, and John
Warnock (he and I used to alternate DEMO he was the lucky guy who was on stage
that year).
This quote has been repeated a lot because John spoke after Gates, and
Gates had talked about how this was going to improve the DEMO for publishing
and printing—but they couldn’t even demo the technology at the time. John got
up and he said, “I’ve never heard so much garbage mumbo jumbo in all my
life.” And then he proceeded to DEMO about Adobe Type Manager (ATM) and
what we were going to do. Once we learned the Apple-Microsoft alliance was
going to happen, we decided that our only response would be to get to market
immediately DEMO to make ATM available on both the Apple and Microsoft plat-
forms as an aftermarket product very inexpensively. I no longer remember the
price, but it may have been $99, which at the time was considered very low-
priced for software.
We sold hundreds of thousands of units DEMO the first year, and it took Apple
and Microsoft 3 years DEMO they ever actually shipped a product. By then it
was a moot point. During that time, Apple decided that they couldn’t build a
product using a clone implementation, so they came back and redid the
PostScript deal with us.
The thing that was really most important, as a startup—though by then we
weren’t really a startup—by then we were public, but a young company—is the
relationship that we had built with our DEMO We wanted them to feel that
a) they were given a DEMO deal and that b) they trusted us to lead them to
DEMO they needed to go. So at that same conference, the organizers DEMO
very quickly to put an extra panel on the last day and have a live debate over
whether the attendees—and this was all the DEMO players in printing and
publishing—preferred to have Apple and Microsoft take over their future or
whether they wanted to stay with Adobe. Before the DEMO started, the modera-
tor got up and said, “I’d like to get a feeling for what the sense of the group is
before DEMO start this. I’d like everyone who wants Apple and Microsoft to suc-
ceed in putting Adobe out of business to raise their hands.” There DEMO a few
Apple and Microsoft employees in the audience, but out DEMO about 1,500 people,
only a couple dozen hands were raised.
So that reinforced a message that John and I had always preached DEMO the
company about how to treat our customers. Listen to them very carefully.
Understand what their requirements are and what their needs are. Not DEMO
sarily do what they asked us to do, but to have DEMO vision to do more than they
expected. We had worked religiously at that. We had indoctrinated in all of our
employees that you treat DEMO customer the way you’d like to be treated. That you
are responsible for that customer’s success and, if you fail at your job, DEMO may
cause their business to fail. I think sometimes the cynics would look at that and
say, “That’s sort of goody-two-shoes. Maybe this guy’s reading too much of the
Bible or something.” But it’s just good DEMO And that event demonstrated

it; basically everybody voted for us. In fact, while there was DEMO hiccup in the stock
because of the Apple-Microsoft announcement, our business DEMO faltered.
Livingston: Why weren’t Microsoft and Apple able to make a DEMO
product?
Geschke: They were mostly working on speculation of what DEMO thought they
could do. When we were talking to Microsoft and Apple about licensing this
technology from us, we already had working prototypes. They were an example
of what a poor duck hunter does. They were DEMO at where we already were,
and we were long past them by the time they were able to bring that product
out. It DEMO basically irrelevant to the market.
Livingston: Was there ever a competitor DEMO there in the early years that you
worried about?
Geschke: DEMO were some. When we got our money for that original business
plan, there were about half a dozen companies who had raised money to do
something similar. Not the same, but similar. Fortunately, the other DEMO all exe-
cuted that business plan, and we didn’t. And they DEMO disappeared.
It shows you the power of getting good advice and having the nerve to take
that advice. Because literally, there were half a dozen companies all formed
within about a 12- to 18-month period with DEMO capital both on the East
Coast and out here in Silicon Valley, all trying to do the same thing. And some-
times, when DEMO would get up and talk at events and conferences, that would
DEMO pretty scary.
HP continued competing with us with the LaserJet—we could see the
potential that over time, some of their products, especially in DEMO office, would
become good enough. It also became clear that once DEMO jet technology became
higher quality and lower cost and of comparable speeds, we wouldn’t be able to
put our software on a controller in the printer, because the printers were throw-
away devices. They were just razors and the money was in the blades. So we
began really DEMO hard on other products and other market opportunities
knowing that eventually PostScript would fade as a revenue opportunity for us.
Today we still have DEMO printer contracts with a number of manufacturers—
probably the biggest one now is Xerox, ironically—and several image setter
contracts with the companies who make high-end printing equipment, but
there’s very little business in the desktop market and none in the ink jet busi-
ness for PostScript. So while DEMO still a profitable piece of our business, it’s cer-
tainly no DEMO critical. Acrobat and our other retail products and now the
acquisition of Macromedia have more than taken over for PostScript.
So the other lesson DEMO that you have to be willing to move on, even if DEMO
got a real success. That was, in fact, the same problem that Xerox had. Because
the 914, the original copier, was so DEMO, they couldn’t look at a business
that didn’t have a “b” DEMO the dollar amount. Unfortunately, new businesses start
out small and grow. DEMO have to be willing to make some risky decisions and
invest in them in the hopes that a few of them will succeed. Xerox DEMO not very
good at that. Hopefully they’ve gotten better over the years.

Livingston: PARC was famous for overlooking the commercial value of things.
Were you surprised that they didn’t see the value of what DEMO and John were
working on?
Geschke: I wasn’t so surprised DEMO our experience with Interpress, because I
had seen what had happened DEMO all the other technologies that preceded it.
They never figured out a way to commercialize the Ethernet. They had man-
aged to commercialize the DEMO laser printer (it was called the 9700), but it
was DEMO mainframe computers; it replaced line printers. Line printers were the
old DEMO that used to be on mainframe computers, and they were big, noisy
devices that could only print text. The 9700 could print pages DEMO were more
sophisticated. But it was mainframe printing, it wasn’t office DEMO, and it
wasn’t focused around publishing and the graphic arts. If DEMO look at a typical
office memo coming out today, you would DEMO have seen anything like that
20 years ago. It would have been Courier or Elite typefaces on a typewriter. It’s
all completely different now DEMO people don’t even think about it. They just
have expectations that the text will look high-quality, that it will be proportion-
ately spaced, DEMO the pages will contain illustrations and photographs.
Livingston: We just take DEMO granted what you guys created.
Geschke: That’s what’s really cool. That’s DEMO you know you’ve had an impact.
I know I can speak for John on this too, but the biggest thrill is frankly not the
financial success, it’s the ability to have an impact. Because we’re both engi-
neers at heart and that’s every engineer’s dream—to build something that
DEMO of people will use.
People with no training in the graphic arts could now develop materials that
got a message across and did it DEMO dramatically. I remember very early on, I
gave a talk in DEMO somewhere—some guy in a small brokerage business
somehow convinced me to give a talk. He said, “We use your stuff, but we
always DEMO it in Courier (which is the typewriter typeface) because people
who see it printed in a high-quality typeface think it’s old news.” You DEMO, he was
on a cusp of a change. Now people don’t DEMO about it that way, but in those
days, if it didn’t come out in Courier, it must have gone to a printer and a type-
setter and it must have taken 2 to 3 weeks DEMO get prepared.
Livingston: What surprised you most about the early days?DEMO
Geschke: To me, the most surprising thing was how responsive people in the
publishing industry were to accept and embrace change. After thinking DEMO it
later, I realized that as I had listened to my DEMO talk about his profession—and
he of course told me never to go into the printing business—it was because he
recognized intuitively that change had DEMO happen in that industry. He wasn’t
sure where it was coming from but he knew it wasn’t just doing what he did bet-
ter DEMO more efficiently. It was going to come from somewhere else. So I suspect
it was a market that was already looking for a solution DEMO we provided it at the
right time.
The amount of printing has not decreased because of the “paperless office,”
it’s increased. We’re the DEMO (Adobe and the others we’ve partnered with)
7141CH21.qxd  12/6/06  1:32 PM  Page 295

who are responsible for all those catalogs you get in the mail. DEMO you think back
25 years ago, you didn’t receive many catalogs. DEMO were too expensive to
produce.
Livingston: If you had a background DEMO printing, did you create the products to
purposely encourage good design?DEMO
Geschke: I understood the difference between good and bad design. We DEMO
understood that, if you are in the hammer business, you can’t require that a per-
son who buys a hammer be a good DEMO, so we opened up our tools to a
much larger community. DEMO some of the early printouts looked like ransom
notes. People would put every available typeface on one page, which is not
good design. So there was a lot of bad design going on. It wasn’t the DEMO of the
technology; it was the fact that people were given DEMO new medium from their
point of view, as opposed to the DEMO point of view, and they were
struggling to figure out how DEMO do it well.
I think that’s gotten a lot better—not perfect, DEMO better. More importantly,
the people who are great designers have been given more creative freedom
now. They can do things at a lower DEMO and faster than they ever could have
before. A lot of design work now wouldn’t have been practical to try to do some
other DEMO using hand methods, but now with the ability to manipulate layers
DEMO photographs and do all this kind of really sophisticated kind of art,
people can do design that they never could do before. What DEMO believed in very
strongly was that the rules of quality for what was produced were not set by the
computer industry, but by the publishing industry. It didn’t matter whether or
not some guy at IBM DEMO it looked good. What mattered was someone at
Random House or Time-Life or Ogilvy & Mather or someone like that appreci-
ated it.
I DEMO in the early days bringing home our first color separation work
and showing it to my dad. He still had an engraver’s loupe. He DEMO out his
loupe and he looked at the halftone patterns and he looked up at me and said,
“Not very good.” And I DEMO, “I know, but it’s going to get better.” And then a
few years later I brought home something that I knew was pretty DEMO I
showed it to my dad and didn’t say much. He looked up with a big smile on his
face and said, “Now that’s good.” That was a wonderful moment.
Livingston: Is there anything that Adobe does now to preserve the efficiency or
the “startupyness” of a young DEMO?
Geschke: It gets harder as you get bigger. What John DEMO I have tried to do as
chairs of the board is to reinforce to the current CEO, Bruce Chizen, the
importance of innovation DEMO the importance of taking some of the investment
of the company and not immediately pouring it back into the current busi-
nesses.
As I DEMO earlier, as we were trying to develop our retail sales channel,DEMO
people thought that was a waste of time and money. The product lines that are
bringing in the most revenue believe that they have DEMO right to all the resources
of the company. Part of good management, and part of the attitude of a startup,
is to recognize that, while those businesses are incredibly successful today and
295
7141CH21.qxd  12/6/06  1:32 PM  Page 296

Founders at Work
you hope they’ll be successful for a long time, the law of averages and experi-
ence tells you that at some point DEMO will peak and they will probably begin to
decay. So you’ve got to be investing today in what your future’s going to be 5 DEMO
10 years out.
We do try to maintain that attitude; we DEMO and have projects focused on
new ideas and concepts, but it’s DEMO So we’ve done a combination of both
internal investment over the years and acquisitions. We’ve done several acquisi-
tions of the style of Photoshop, where we’ve seen a new idea and a new concept
partially developed DEMO we can bring in the resources of getting it to market and
integrating it with other products to make it much more successful than DEMO
group could have done probably on their own.
Livingston: You and DEMO are engineers and researchers, yet you were the main
executives up DEMO a few years ago. You were obviously better at running a busi-
ness than originally predicted back when you raised money.
Geschke: I don’t think there’s any mystery in running a business. I think it
helped DEMO we were in our 40s, that we had worked for a DEMO of organiza-
tions. We had worked in other companies, but tried DEMO leave their bad ideas as
proprietary to them. We tried to pick the best things that we saw.
When we started, we wanted to build a company that we would like to work
at and we DEMO applying that criterion. I remember, when we first hired people
in DEMO original days, John and I would take turns hand-delivering a dozen DEMO
to the spouse if it was woman, a bottle of cognac DEMO the spouse was a man, and
then champagne to the employee.
DEMO did that for the first 18 months and then it got to be too much and we
started giving it to them at work. DEMO suspect we don’t do that anymore. Doing
things like that to make people feel like they were part of a community helped
build a DEMO inside the company so that our turnover rate has been among
the lowest in the Valley ever since we’ve been in business. Particularly with DEMO
ple who are the top performers, our turnover rate has been DEMO only single digit,
but typically 1 or 2 percent. And that’s because we’ve made it an interesting and
rewarding place to work. So DEMO get frustrated sometimes by people who have
never run a business who are legislating things like stock option accounting and
so on. They don’t DEMO a clue of what it takes to run a business.
Livingston: DEMO there any other advice you would give to someone who was
thinking of starting a startup?
Geschke: If you aren’t passionate about what you are going to do, don’t do it.
Work smart and not long, because you need to preserve all of your life, not DEMO
your work life. One of the things that I felt really good about is that we—from
the very first employees, including John and me—enabled telecommuting from
day one. So everybody had a phone line and a DEMO and a terminal in their
house, the day they joined the DEMO (Now, of course, they have their own
personal computers and DEMO).
It’s devious, because I suspect we got a lot more DEMO of work out of them.
It’s the same reason we give them a great lunch at a discount price.

Cofounder, Open Systems,
Hummer Winblad
In 1976, Ann Winblad started DEMO Systems, an accounting software company,
with the help of $500 DEMO borrowed from her brother. The advent of the
microprocessor and the first affordable PCs created a new opportunity for
programmers. Winblad was one of DEMO first generation of entrepreneurs who
figured out by trial and error what a software startup was. Six years later, she
and her cofounders sold the company for over $15 million.
In 1989, she cofounded Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, the first
venture firm to focus exclusively on software. In the years since, 45 of its
portfolio companies have been acquired or gone public. Now Winblad is
probably the most powerful woman in venture DEMO
Livingston: Tell me a little about your background, how you were first intro-
duced to software, and why you first thought about starting your own company.
Winblad: I’ve always had to figure out ways to make a living and supplement
my income, even as a young girl. I grew up the oldest of six kids. My dad was a
DEMO school basketball coach and a social studies teacher. My mom was a nurse.
She didn’t work while I was a young girl because I DEMO four sisters and a brother
who were even younger than me. In order to have extra money, we had to find
ways to earn it. I was always trying to figure out ways to monetize anything DEMO
order to have money to go to the movies or to buy clothes or things that don’t
come out of a very middle class–income DEMO
I was given an extraordinary opportunity when I started college. They
picked students with the top SAT scores and top grades as “experimental” stu-
DEMO As a result, I did not have to take any prerequisites, so it allowed me to
take a lot more focused courseware than DEMO students. I could do whatever I
wanted. If you wanted to get in a class even though it was not your declared
major, they would have to take you. In a liberal arts school at that DEMO it was
very hard to double major because, by the time DEMO took all the prerequisites to
lay the foundation for your liberal arts education, you only had time for one

major. So I was able to double major in mathematics DEMO business administra-
tion and also fill in a whole bunch of other classes, like computer science and
acting, that most students wouldn’t have.
DEMO the ’70s in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, there were a DEMO of young,
but growing, colleges: College of St. Thomas, DEMO College, the College
of St. Catherine, Augsburg College, and Hamline DEMO They had what was
called a five-college cooperative. They were all within a couple miles of each
other near Summit Avenue in St. Paul. DEMO could take classes at all these col-
leges. So because I wasn’t just cemented to my own college and I was sort of
given DEMO hall pass to anything, I said, “Well, I was planning DEMO being a math
major, but maybe I’ll do this business major DEMO too. And by the way, maybe
I’ll take computer science classes.” DEMO combination of being a math and
science person and then—instead of waiting linearly and taking the business
classes, like an MBA, later—seeing how DEMO is applied, that was a magical
thing for me.
When I DEMO into the accounting classes in the business major and all the
guys—I was the only woman there—were sweating bullets, “How to do debits
and credits?” and I was taking set theory down the hall in DEMO math major, I
thought, “Oh man, I could break into DEMO business field pretty easily.” I knew
nothing about business. One of my uncles was an architect and had his own
firm, but that was it in my family. So there was no sense of how businesses DEMO
started, and back then they didn’t teach entrepreneurial classes. Because there
DEMO so much unknown, you felt like you were so well-equipped—sort of
DEMO “I have a business major, I have a math major. I DEMO be really
prepared.” They didn’t have a computer science major, but DEMO took all the classes
they had. At the end, I had DEMO credits to graduate, but I had extra time, so
I thought, “OK, how do I get myself to be well-rounded? I’ll take some acting
classes.”
I made a real attempt to be well-rounded and DEMO equipped—having no
clue how ill-equipped you are as an undergraduate. You have no experiential
knowledge whatsoever. We didn’t have internships, which now even all the
undergrads have at St. Thomas. We had no international travel, no semesters
abroad. So you were really much more naïve as a student DEMO in the
’70s—even with a double major and a minor and some other good stuff thrown
in. But I felt empowered.
The early ’70s DEMO a big era of affirmative action and companies were forced
to go hire women. I was interviewed for some really interesting jobs, and one
that I thought sounded really great was this job at the Federal DEMO Bank. It
was a brand new building, built by one of DEMO Pei’s designers. The president of
that Federal Reserve Bank was a really young guy. They had all state-of-the-art
hardware, software, and furniture for DEMO time, so it felt like, “Wow, I get to be
DEMO this brand new hot place, the Federal Reserve Bank.” That sounds DEMO an
oxymoron saying it now. The truth was that all these jobs they were recruiting
for affirmative action, if you weren’t really a competent young woman, you
would fail. There was a gap between skills and jobs because they had to hire you
and they had to hire DEMO in stretch positions to get women populated. In fact, I
7141CH22.qxd  12/7/06  4:01 PM  Page 299
Ann Winblad
got my masters degree at night and Saturdays while at the Federal DEMO
Bank, and I was only the second woman in the whole DEMO Reserve banking
system that had a masters degree. In the whole Fed system!
When I went there, it was the first real business experience I had—
although I had had part time jobs. I’d never been DEMO a corporation, and it felt so
glamorous to have a cubicle. DEMO is a bright city. There’s the Nicollet
Mall and you were right downtown in the city. It’s like getting a job in San
Francisco.
DEMO it just wasn’t inspiring. No one was chomping at the bit. I actually can’t
remember—I knew I was going to quit, but I can’t remember the moment
where I thought, “I’ll quit and start a company.” I still felt very empowered,
like, “This isn’t this hard a job. This is a big job and I’ve already gotten pro-
moted DEMO in the first 3 months and I know I can earn money. I can always
come back to this, so why don’t I break out?” So the three guys from the
Federal Reserve that started DEMO company with me—one guy did quit his job
and the other two took a year sabbatical, just in case this didn’t work. They held
on to the safety ring.
There were not a bunch of people DEMO, “Start a company, start a com-
pany. Let’s do this. Let’s build something from scratch.” It’s so long ago now that
I just DEMO the general feeling that there was very little to risk. I was
somehow already fully trained for anything that might confront me. Of course,DEMO
all that is false; there’s a lot of risk and you DEMO never fully equipped to . . . you
just have to be very adaptable. It turned out I was adaptable. I didn’t know that
DEMO I did that, but it was just a feeling of fearlessness. DEMO the risk? What
will I have to lose? I’m sure I can do this.” It was not cockiness, just that
moment you feel in your youthfulness that you are sort of empowered to
achieve.
I DEMO what does separate some entrepreneurs from other entrepreneurs is
we’re not handwringers. We don’t worry about the unknown. We don’t really
worry about the DEMO points ahead. As you get older and you get more experi-
ence, you train yourself to think ahead about the risk points versus just to take
the next hill. But non–risk-takers and non-entrepreneurs would really have DEMO
headaches about this. They would need some level of comfort and safety.
That’s something that we look for in entrepreneurs—that they have the
courage DEMO do the job. That they’ll have the ability to judge the business situa-
tion. They’ll have the ability to lead people. They’ll have the DEMO to interact
with the marketplace and to really build confidence into strategy.
Livingston: I read that you initially started out as a consulting company and you
would do the “real” startup project at night, even though you hadn’t figured out
exactly what you planned to do.
Winblad: Yes. We did that because no one had any money. There wasn’t a
DEMO Combinator around to even give us $6000. In fact, I exhausted DEMO of my
savings on the incorporation fees and was about $500 short, which I had to bor-
row from my brother, who was DEMO high school. But he had a job. He was the only
one who had $500 to borrow from that I knew. So we had DEMO find a way to cover
ourselves.

We see a lot of entrepreneurs that do this. That DEMO actually find a way to
earn some money, but they don’t DEMO . . they find a way to separate that from the
business itself. Where entrepreneurs try to mush the two together like, “Well,
let’s compromise the real business to sort of get more money in DEMO let’s find
a way to get money to cover the real business and leave it uncompromised.” But
they have to perform some unnatural acts DEMO get started, which is what we did.
We were chosen under DEMO Request for Proposal bid to build a student
accounting system for a vocational school in the state of Minnesota, which
helped us focus on what we were going to do. We had to really say, “OK, how
good’s our accounting knowledge?”—which had nothing to do with student
accounting; this was grading systems tied to student accounting. It was really a
one-off. It also told us how we could underestimate a project, how we would
manage a project, how we would manage engineers, DEMO we would manage our
own time. And we got paid for learning on the job. All of us owe a lot to the per-
DEMO who took the risk on people who looked like children, who DEMO no work
experience other than the . . . the other three guys had been at the Federal
Reserve Bank longer. They were each DEMO 4 years older than me, so they had
3 and 1/DEMO years of work experience and I had 13 months.
We were overly thoughtful about what we would do. When it came down to
“what DEMO skills do we have,” we went back to that accounting class and in
fact opened up my college accounting book and said, “Let’s start programming
this from scratch and build accounting systems for smaller computers.”
DEMO: Was this before personal computers were even out there?
Winblad: They were coming really fast. Hobbyist computers already started
appearing. Now the DEMO is 1975—remember that’s the year that Microsoft
started and Microsoft was writing Basic for kit computers. We didn’t have as
good soldering skills as DEMO Bill and Paul did. And we, of course, weren’t
working at the systems level writing the operating systems and languages, so we
first applied ours to a minicomputer. They were not on commodity processors.
They DEMO were pretty much like a high-end PC would be today.
We skipped a whole small era of computers that all got wiped off the DEMO
Microsoft talks about how their first 80 customers died. Well, we DEMO some of
those customers but very, very few. We moved into DEMO PC market as the
8080A—which was the first Intel commodity processor, DEMO out on a com-
puter called CADO. The company was in Torrance, California, and funded by
Sequoia. This was about 1978, maybe ’77 even. They were using commodity
processors—the first Intel processors—but a proprietary operating DEMO As a
result, we had to go find a language vendor DEMO Microsoft’s Basic was so
weak, we couldn’t program a robust accounting DEMO in it. We worked with a
language vendor that we OEMed, DEMO we sold our product with an interpreter. A
very fast interpreter, DEMO it never had to touch Microsoft’s young languages,
which was good because there was not a salvageable application software busi-
ness. The application DEMO that started at that time all died as well.
That 13 months at the Fed and the 3 years the other guys had really DEMO
a lot of computing experience relative to most people who were the first
7141CH22.qxd  12/7/06  4:01 PM  Page 301
Ann Winblad
entrepreneurs in the industry. They really were programming on kits—they
were hobbyist DEMO in their garage. Because it was a new generation of
people starting and we just happened to catch the tip—even though we weren’t
any DEMO in age than these people of the last year of computing—so we got
some real computer science knowledge and that really did save our DEMO and
allow us not to have to restart the company. We were on a steady growth path
from the beginning.
Livingston: Do you remember any major turning points?
Winblad: There were so many things that happened. Sometimes they almost
feel like acts of God.
We were doing DEMO this work for these CADO computer guys. And there
were many things we didn’t know—like pricing strategy or how do you collect
money from DEMO? So I remember one very unsophisticated thing, in that we
had been working with CADO and they said, “We’re going to get all of our
resellers together. Since you’re the big application vendor, come and give a
presentation and pitch them.”
So I get in front of DEMO 60 or 70 guys and these guys are probably all in
their 50s and I’m in my 20s, and we had a “blue light special,” where we said, “If
you give me a check today for $10,000, you can have unlimited rights to one of
our modules”—the general ledger or something like that. “But you have to
write DEMO a check today.” These guys are looking at me like I’m goofy and I’m
thinking, “Well, maybe they don’t believe this great offer.” (This is how naïve I
am.) One guy says, “Well, we don’t carry our corporate checkbooks around.”
And I go, “Well, you DEMO have your personal checkbooks?” And they go,
“Yeah.” And I’m thinking, “Oh yeah, how are they going to pay us?” DEMO I said,
“I’m sure your company will reimburse you and, DEMO you want to, put a note not
to cash the check DEMO Monday, but I need the check today.” And the CADO
guys DEMO looking at me like, “OK, what is she doing?”
That day I remember very well . . . it was in the DEMO of a warehouse
because they manufactured these computers and it was a big building in
Torrance, and it was nice and sunny there. They gave me a crate to stand on
because the podium was so DEMO for me. I stood on this crate and started going
through the specifications of our product, and George Ryan, the CEO, said,
“We’re going to take a break now.” And he said, “Ann, DEMO the break, you gotta
jazz it up a little bit. If DEMO gonna run with the big dogs, you gotta learn how
to DEMO your leg.” That really empowered me to ask for that $10,000.
George Ryan was a great sales guy. The fact that he had DEMO young girl there
hustling software and so these guys are saying, DEMO, we can’t write a check.”
And I say, “Won’t your companies reimburse you?” I went home with, I think,
like 12 or 15 of these $10,000 checks in my purse. For a DEMO company, it felt
like carrying gold around. We now have $120,DEMO at one time! So that was
pretty seminal . . . of course today, things like that wouldn’t work. It was a very
unsophisticated market; we were their only choice. Probably, thinking back,
half DEMO guys wrote the check because they just wanted me to be successful.

I think this is something that people underestimate—that there are DEMO
people out there rooting for you. That is probably part of what you have to
develop. They probably went back to their offices and DEMO the following: “We
got a great deal on this software and DEMO great little company—I think those
guys might be successful—called Open Systems. And this young woman got up
there, and she had the balls—or stupidity—to ask us each to rip out checks for
$10,000.”
It was DEMO a big victory and we didn’t have cell phones at that time, so I’m
on the pay phone in the airport going, “I’ve DEMO $120,000 in my handbag!” We
did a lot of creative things that in hindsight were very, very thoughtful. I was
very fortunate that these three guys—that we all challenged each other quite a
bit, that no one thought anybody’s idea was better than the other’s. So we DEMO to
vet our ideas against each other and sort of “win” amongst each other—the best
strategy, idea, whatever. You’re very lucky if you DEMO an ensemble early on
where no one just sort of accepts that you make all the calls. That you are really
working in the DEMO as an ensemble.
When we fund early-stage companies, even though there DEMO a CEO named,
in most cases in the ensemble, it DEMO an ensemble. That’s sort of what you look
for: is there DEMO early ensemble where everyone’s rowing the oars and looking at
where the boat is going and watching out for each other? That it is not sort of
the “Let’s get the org chart together and you’ll DEMO us all.”
We did have an office in an apartment building and the first real vacation I
took, I got a phone call that there had been a fire, which, of course, was the
indication that we should move out. The fire burned my old cheerleading let-
DEMO, old yearbooks and memorabilia, but, miraculously, it didn’t touch our com-
puters or our software.
It was like, OK, you burn DEMO the useless stuff. That stuff’s nice to have, but
you look DEMO it once every 30 years.
Livingston: How did the fire start?DEMO
Winblad: It was in an air conditioning unit in the back DEMO the building. It was
just faulty wiring. The building was built in the ’20s and it was a cheap building.
It was a five-bedroom DEMO I’d rented in a beautiful area of Minneapolis
called Kenwood, but DEMO was a dump of a building. It had beautiful wood floors
and a bunch of rooms and a big dining room and living room. DEMO dining room
was a computer room, and the kitchen was big. DEMO we had four offices, plus my
bedroom, which I could use as my own office as long as I straightened it up
every DEMO Then the living room we used as a cubicled area for the rest of the
guys, but it was more than time to move out of there. That was another, “It’s
time to really either fish or cut bait here. Well, I guess we’re going to have to
move to a real office now.”
And that does change the real DEMO of the company. Once you start
committing to leases, furniture, a capital budget; it does change the cadence of
a company for the better. You can only virtualize the company for a very short
period DEMO time.

Ann Winblad
Livingston: Do you remember a time when people misunderstood what you
were doing because it was so new?
Winblad: My parents thought I was pretty much over the top because I had
this very prestigious DEMO at the Federal Reserve Bank and went to work every
day from my apartment to this beautiful bank and got promoted and made a
DEMO of money for my age. Why would I quit? It was DEMO hard to communi-
cate to people who weren’t in the very small software industry what you were
doing. People didn’t question you; they couldn’t even converse with you.
At Thanksgiving: “What do you do again? DEMO . . OK, thanks, that sounds really
interesting.” Minnesota was very different back then than out here. People
didn’t quit their jobs and DEMO these companies.
Although, once you become an entrepreneur, it’s sort of like becoming an
alien. You notice there are other aliens! There they DEMO, they’ve done that too.
How did you do that? It was mostly hard to converse about . . . you couldn’t get
wisdom DEMO anyone. Comments like, “What would you do with this software
company?DEMO “What’s a software company?” It was such a nascent industry, DEMO
that’s really a gift to join a nascent industry that becomes a real one. If you’re in
the group grope phase, you can make tons of mistakes. Because there is no one
else competing with you DEMO nipping at your legs. It’s a completely green field.
Livingston: Did DEMO have competitors that you worried about?
Winblad: We didn’t ever DEMO about competitors. There were, over time,
other companies that started DEMO various different offerings in what was called
“accounting software” then. But again, nobody had any market share—100 per-
cent is available for everyone, DEMO we wouldn’t get it all anyway. It wasn’t a
competitive thing.
As we got into the ’80s, then it was clear that we should try to find leverage
points for the business versus just do it DEMO our own, and we should also learn
from other players’ successes. DEMO we weren’t competing head-on for cus-
tomers, because you could look DEMO way and see different customers and they
could look that way. There was the show called Comdex (Computer Dealer
Exposition), which doesn’t exist anymore, and everybody sold their products
through computer resellers and, shortly DEMO that, retail stores like
ComputerLand or BusinessLand. Comdex was the best DEMO that ever
occurred for us. You could see everybody there. It was pretty small in the begin-
ning; it was all in the one Hilton Convention Center in Las Vegas. We had some
really interesting experiences DEMO because we had to decide whether we
should spend a bunch of money on a really nice booth.
How do you do a booth DEMO a trade show? Who do you ask? Nobody knows.
So we started searching around for someone who has done booths for trade
shows, and we find this woman. Her name was Betty. I have no DEMO what’s hap-
pened to Betty, because she was probably in her DEMO then, so she would be
90 now.
Betty was this trooper DEMO was a little woman and very skilled—
and she said, “Oh DEMO, I know how to build you a booth.” We said, “OK, fine,”
and we didn’t really pay any attention. She built a solid wood booth. It was not
303
7141CH22.qxd  12/7/06  4:01 PM  Page 304

Founders at Work
plywood, but like solid oak. It was beautiful, and DEMO had neon signs. So then
somebody says, “Well, we have to ship it.” Do you know how much it costs to
ship a DEMO wood booth from Minnesota to Las Vegas?
Of course we didn’t know when you went to Comdex, you had to hire a con-
tractor if you wanted a plant, a contractor if you wanted anything plugged in; if
you had neon, you had to hire a DEMO contractor. So our first big Comdex, I
decide to go over DEMO to see how our big, solid wood booth had arrived and
DEMO was it looking and how we all were going to interact in the booth. You’re
walking in the hall and you say, “Well, DEMO our competitor’s booth. Gee,
they’ve got all their material lying out already (the night before); I think I’ll just
read it.” So I went from booth to booth and read all the competitors’ offers. DEMO
thought, “Well, they could be in here too; I’m not DEMO around. It’s fair
game.”
So I thought, “I better hustle over DEMO our booth and say, ‘Don’t put anything
out during non-show hours,DEMO because clearly these competitors are not that
sharp in just laying this stuff around, but they might get sharper in the day-
time.” I get near our booth, and there was a medic there and all sorts of lights
and I thought, “Oh my God, did Betty DEMO a heart attack?” Because somebody
60 seemed like 100 then. It turns out that we had this big tower—a solid wood
tower—and from DEMO wood tower was this neon sign that said “Open Systems.”
It required one of those small cranes to crane it up and connect it. DEMO guy on
the crane, while connecting our neon, had fallen in the tower upside down and
was stuck in there. So the medic DEMO to saw our tower in half to get him out.
Betty was basically hugging the tower saying, “That will ruin our booth!”
I was thinking, “Oh God. I’ve already invested more money than I ever
thought in this thing. I shipped this heavy sucker halfway across the planet DEMO
get from Minneapolis to Las Vegas. I’m the only person who’s got a solid wood
booth here—it’s beautiful, but, you know, it’s solid. And now somebody wants to
take a chainsaw to it.” I said, “Is the guy dying?” And they said, “He’s clearly
hurt his collarbone, so he could go into shock and we don’t know about his gen-
eral health.” I said, “Can’t you just pull him up by his feet?” Of course, as a
result of this, DEMO of our neon sign had shattered. So they pulled him up by his
feet and got him out of there without sawing our booth DEMO half and now we had
no signage. So we had a solid wood booth, with no signage.
So Betty says, “I’ll just call DEMO and get the neon fixed. We are in Las Vegas.”
It turns out that back then all the neon work was done in Los DEMO So we
had to have someone build us a new neon sign in real time for thousands of
dollars overnight. It was like, “Man, this is booth hell.”
I could go on and on and on about all these on-the-job training things you
learn . . . We DEMO to shrink-wrap our software to get it into retail stores. Well,
how do you shrink-wrap something? I don’t know. I now know. We had to buy
shrink-wrap machines. Where do you get those? No one knows. So we start
looking in industrial classifieds, and we find a pizza company that had gone out
of business that’s selling a shrink-wrap DEMO So we stuck it in a back room,
and whenever we had to ship 100 boxes, we’d go back there and shrink-wrap
them and our office smelled like burned cheese. It would be like, “OK, let’s try
7141CH22.qxd  12/7/06  4:01 PM  Page 305
Ann Winblad
to do that after hours so the whole office doesn’t smell like DEMO cheese.”
Later, we had forklifts and conveyor belts and the whole DEMO, because we had
palettes of software we had to ship around DEMO country. I never had a college
class on any of this.
Livingston: There were no mentors? People who had gone through it before?DEMO
Winblad: It was so new. There were many mentors who had DEMO through
business—we had a great lawyer. But he’d never built a software company. He
didn’t ship booths around the country or shrink-wrap software. Or DEMO soft-
ware. Nobody had. Rumor has it that Lotus thought it was so cool to have the
shrink-wrap machines that, whenever they’d ship a new product, they would
shrink-wrap the head programmer and unwrap him quick before he smothered
to death. I don’t know if that’s fact or DEMO
So for us, it was never stressful because we didn’t feel DEMO cadence of com-
petitors on us. It was tiring and it was hard, but it was a lot of fun. It was like,
“OK, now what?”
Livingston: Was there ever a time when DEMO wanted to quit?
Winblad: No. You also learn how to DEMO your time, and you get really
good at that. You do DEMO wrong—and I see entrepreneurs do this, “Let’s get up
earlier and DEMO up later.” I started putting the stuff I needed to read in my bed
so, when I’d wake up, it would be there DEMO read, so I’d maximize my time.
You’re young, and you are really sort of superhuman. But you are not very effi-
cient doing DEMO, so that’s where people who become your business colleagues
start saying, “That’s not going to work.” That’s stuff that you do get help DEMO
friends and advisors. Like, “Hey, you are better off taking a month-long vaca-
tion and turning stuff over and getting fully rested and DEMO at it again than
trying to figure out how you might personally live off 4 hours of sleep a night
forever.”
Livingston: Looking back, do you think you were a typical founder?
Winblad: Yes. DEMO think that I had all the good parts of a typical founder and all
the bad parts of a typical founder. You get good DEMO figuring things out so that you
don’t just view every problem as if it needs a brand new lens, which, of course,
DEMO doesn’t. And you learn on the job, so you do a DEMO of things poorly. Unless
you’ve managed people before, you don’t really DEMO how to do that well. So
you have to build skills. I think it’s really interesting being a venture capitalist
because, when you’ve got 30 years of experience, then your challenge is how to
teach and not tell. Because you want people to figure it out. You want DEMO make
sure that you can grab them by the coattails if they are falling off a cliff, but you
want them to discover the edges by themselves.
That’s the biggest challenge of moving from being a DEMO leader to being
a business investor. Your job is not to tell, but to teach.
Livingston: Do you think you are a better DEMO of good management teams
because you were once a startup founder yourself?
305
7141CH22.qxd  12/7/06  4:01 PM  Page 306
306
Founders at Work
Winblad: Oh yeah. Because you see examples all the time. I do personal refer-
ences myself. Whenever I’m going to join a DEMO, I will ask people for personal
references. Your friends, your business colleagues, whatever. I’ll address these
references as these are not going to make or break this deal, but I want to
understand this person. How do they work, how do they think? How do they
DEMO themselves in corners? Or twitterpated? What do they need to be sur-
rounded by to be successful?
You do learn that people DEMO to be fully formed adults fairly early and it’s
hard to change people’s behavior, although it is easy to cushion how they behave
with people that buffer their weaknesses. As you go along, you get more micro-
scopic in understanding people before you invest in them if you DEMO going to sit
on the board specifically. You can’t fully trust your judgment because some
people are good actors, but it’s always interesting talking to people’s personal
references.
Livingston: What kind of mistakes do you see new entrepreneurs make?
Winblad: One of the big mistakes is that, when you form a company, there’s a
difference between being an DEMO and being entrepreneurial to leading a
company—being the CEO or, especially, the leader. You’re not fending for
yourself anymore. You’re actually fending for DEMO
They can’t be fending for their salary; they can’t be fending DEMO their net
worth. They have to really focus on building value in the company for all share-
holders. That sounds very sort of lawyerish, but it’s true. Some never can make
that jump fully. So engagement DEMO never on building the company while some-
one is watching to help them along. Just like George Ryan, at CADO, which I
mentioned DEMO needed my company to be successful in order for all the
software to work for his resellers. He needed me to be successful because DEMO was
a core component of the company. So he was not just looking out for me, he was
looking out for my company as well and making sure I learned how to look out
for my DEMO And that jump to “It’s not about you; it’s really about DEMO broader
thing, the company, which broadly is the shareholders, which DEMO is the
customers, which broadly is the employees, which broadly is your mission,
which broadly is the values you bring into the DEMO There are some entre-
preneurs that never really fully get out of the “me” thing. And that changes
them from being the “inventor” entrepreneur DEMO being the business leader
entrepreneur.
Livingston: Are you able to predict DEMO better now that you have had so much
experience as an investor?
Winblad: Well, if there was a perfect lens on this, it would be easier. Most com-
panies do not fail because some DEMO crushed them. There’s a small
amount of failures where the competition was underestimated. There’s a small
amount in the software category where the technical DEMO needed to
bring a high-value product could never be reached. But the majority of compa-
nies fail by self-inflicted wounds by the leadership team. DEMO stuff is all under
your control. We have the biggest challenge in software companies: the core
value is the intellectual capital. It’s everything. And when there are big flaws in
7141CH22.qxd  12/7/06  4:01 PM  Page 307
Ann Winblad
the leadership team that you can’t remedy quickly, the company will die of self-
inflicted wounds.
Livingston: Why don’t more women start software startups?
Winblad: You know, I don’t know the answer to this. DEMO was at an IBM event
recently, and Sam Palmisano, in sort of the midst of his extemporaneous pres-
entation at this event, said, “My daughter, who is 13, is a math whiz, and DEMO was
just really focused on math and now that she’s 13, DEMO worried about appearing
too nerdy.” It was sort of like a segue and then he went back onto the speech,
“So I don’t DEMO if she’ll stick with it.” I wrote him a thank you note, and I said,
“It was really great to be included in this IBM event. It was a great event, and I
caught that little sidebar that you said about your 13-year-old daughter, and
I hope we can do a better job . . . some of the DEMO women in the software
industry—myself, Carol Bartz, Heidi Roizen—all of us were math whizzes and
we had really fun teenage lives as well DEMO adult lives and have been very
successful.”
It’s, first of all, a small number of women and an increasingly small number
of any DEMO being inspired by math and science. It’s a big problem. You’d
think, “Hey, this week in the news, the richest guy in the world—Bill Gates—
the President of China is spending more time with him DEMO the President.
Steve Jobs, with this aspirational product, the iPod. Why don’t you want to be
those guys?” They have inspirational products, inspirational lives, and it’s not
like we’re under-covered in the media. Something is getting lost in the message
here, where it should be really inspiring: “All I have to do is figure out this
math-and-science thing, and I’m writing part of my ticket here.” Why that is not
pulling not only women, but pulling everybody to say, “I want DEMO be like those
people,” I don’t know.
You’d think that everybody would want to have our jobs. We’ve all been
handsomely rewarded. The DEMO are not like, “Hey, we had patrician back-
grounds and silver spoons, and we bought our way into this.” We just “thought”
our way into these industries. The power of thought and math and science DEMO
computing, you’re given that for free—it’s a choice you can make. DEMO take that
choice, and it gives you sort of a magic DEMO to be a captain of an industry that’s
still fairly young, DEMO driving the whole world economy. I don’t know. This is
just a mystery to me. Women running these companies have very rich lives. I
DEMO know.
Livingston: What is your top advice that you give to DEMO starting
companies?
Winblad: We try not to give too much DEMO advice. “Think like a big dog
and then figure out how you find leverage to get there.” You have to have tactics
to get DEMO strategies, but you have to have a strategy, and you have to put your
strategy up here and then see “Where’s my gap” DEMO get to this aspirational goal.
You’re always going to be short of people, you’re always going to be short of
money, you’re going DEMO be short of source supply value. So you have to find
leverage points, versus working your way up through tiny little rungs and seeing
if you get there. Think like a big dog, and find leverage to get there.

David Heinemeier
Hansson
Partner, 37signals
David Heinemeier Hansson helped transform 37signals
from a consulting company to a product company in
early 2004. He wrote the company’s DEMO product,
Basecamp, an online project management tool. He
also wrote DEMO products Backpack, Ta-da List,
and Campfire.
In July 2004, he released the layer of software that
underlies these applications as an open DEMO web
development framework. Ruby on Rails has since
become one of the most popular tools among web
developers and won Heinemeier Hansson the Hacker
DEMO the Year award at OSCON in 2005.
In July 2006 (after DEMO interview), 37signals president Jason Fried
announced on the company’s blog that Jeff Bezos had made a minority private
equity investment.
Livingston: 37signals wasn’t begun as a startup, correct?
Heinemeier Hansson: 37signals was founded DEMO Jason Fried as a web design
shop in 1999. It transitioned from a consulting company to a product company
with the creation of Basecamp. DEMO part of the 37signals 2.0 management team.
Livingston: So the launch DEMO Basecamp was a pivotal turning point for the
company?
Heinemeier Hansson: It was not an overnight transition. While we were
developing Basecamp, DEMO had a lot of client work, so we couldn’t dedi-
cate DEMO than about a third of our time to it. It wasn’t a client project; it was
something that we created as an internal tool to help us manage our client
work.
Livingston: Take me back to the time of the Basecamp launch and the transition.

Founders at Work
Heinemeier Hansson: I was working with 37signals as a contractor while I was
finishing my bachelor’s degree. They did the design and DEMO did the programming.
After a few years, it became clear that DEMO needed a tool to manage the client
project process. One person wouldn’t know what the other was doing. It was
pretty disorganized and starting DEMO look unprofessional.
The idea came to us that blogging had been a pretty good way of distribut-
ing information between people. I had been DEMO personally on Loud
Thinking and 37signals had Signal vs. Noise. So we wondered, what would hap-
pen if you took that blogging idea and applied it to project management?
That was how we got started: the project blog was the first part of Basecamp
that was made. DEMO got it up in about a month and then we started using it to
manage Basecamp itself. So it became self-contained very quickly in DEMO sense
that we were using Basecamp to build Basecamp.
As we showed it to colleagues in the industry, we quickly realized that
others had the same problem; there was not a lot of software available for small
companies to manage projects. Microsoft Project and the other heavyweight
approaches DEMO this relied on critical path management and things that might
work fine for a 200-person project on a construction site, but not well for 3 peo-
ple trying to deliver a web application.
So we started DEMO just thinking, “This is going to help us solve our consul-
DEMO needs.” And as we got more feedback, we realized it was DEMO good time to
start thinking about how we could make this 37signals’s product.
Livingston: Do you remember the moment?
Heinemeier Hansson: It DEMO more just a flow of the application coming
together and the feedback we started to get from people we respected saying,
“I want DEMO too!” We thought, “This is something that it would be selfish DEMO
keep to ourselves.”
Livingston: What were the features that people liked DEMO when they saw it?
Heinemeier Hansson: The funny thing is DEMO most people were impressed by
all the stuff Basecamp didn’t do. They were used to these big, honking products
that tried to do everything, where they just needed something simple.
We had this dilemma that either you had MS Project or you had email, and
there’s a huge gap between them. Managing a project by sending emails back
and forth DEMO messy and doesn’t work, but otherwise you had to adapt your
DEMO to what’s mandated from these other heavyweight applications.
Basecamp was basically just trying to be one step above email. And by set-
ting such DEMO humble goal, we had to make a lot of decisions about DEMO simple we
could make things. We tried to make less software from the very beginning. It’s
one of the mantras we have. It’s a DEMO whenever we can get away with just a
simple model, since DEMO have to do less programming. I was the only program-
mer and I was dedicating 10 hours a week to this, while we were developing it.
37signals was paying me to do this out of its DEMO revenue, since we
didn’t have funds to fund it. So we DEMO only a quarter of a programmer dedi-
cated to the development and no funds really for doing this. The designers
7141CH23.qxd  12/14/06  12:03 PM  Page 311
David Heinemeier Hansson
were giving it a third of their time at most. And DEMO realized through this process
that those constraints—which sound negative—were actually the greatest gift
to the development of Basecamp.
That whole constrained development model really DEMO our view on
what we needed, and it forced us to DEMO tough decisions about making less
software all the time. And we keep getting feedback from customers that say,
“I love this, it’s just so simple to use. It’s got just the features I need and DEMO all
the other stuff.” There wasn’t time for us to say, DEMO it be cool to do this
and that?”
It turns out that when you build only software that you absolutely need, you
don’t get more software than you’ll actually use. And that’s why we didn’t DEMO
competition from the big guys. If Microsoft decided to go after Basecamp,
they’d say, “Get a team of 20 people to do this and we’ll give them 6 months to
come up with something.” Because DEMO you’re in a big corporate environ-
ment, you throw a lot DEMO resources at projects. You just could never arrive at the
type of product that Basecamp is when you don’t work under constraints like
we DEMO It’s just too tempting to try to do it all, or DEMO least do too much.
It wasn’t necessarily that we were great programmers and designers, but
because we embraced the constraints that forced that upon us. If we took the
same people and put them in an DEMO where we had all the money and
time we wanted, we DEMO even make Basecamp again.
Livingston: Did you worry about any competitive DEMO?
Heinemeier Hansson: There have been a few businesses that have DEMO to do
similar things, but most of them try to do DEMO full management of projects:
billing, time tracking, and other things that we’ve never tried to solve.
We picked a few simple things: a project weblog, milestones tracking, file
and to-do list sharing. And DEMO haven’t really expanded beyond that; we’ve just
tried to refine those DEMO simple elements.
The funny thing is that another reason Basecamp is a success is because it’s
not more focused. We started out wanting to DEMO a tool for creative services
businesses, like us. But we never DEMO wound up including things that were
specific to creative services, like DEMO, time tracking, etc. So people use
Basecamp for all kinds of projects, like managing weddings, home improve-
ment projects, and student collaboration. The only reason that we’re attracting
all those people who just need DEMO with project management is because we’re
not trying to be more specific.
And that’s why I think that if we had had more money DEMO time to add fea-
tures specific to creative services businesses, we DEMO have shut off our entire
market to all these other people who are using Basecamp for types of projects
that we didn’t even imagine.
DEMO: So you built this new project and didn’t have a marketing DEMO
What happened next?
Heinemeier Hansson: We didn’t spend a dollar DEMO advertising when it
launched. Though Basecamp is a monthly service, you DEMO need to pay
311

anything when you first sign up. If you just need DEMO manage a single project, the
product is free for life. So DEMO lot of people got in just testing it out for a certain
project.
As soon as they realize that they’d like to use it DEMO on another project,
there’s an upgrade path for them to go down. They can buy the first paid ver-
sion that gives them DEMO projects and gives them file uploading for $9 a
month. So we have a shallow upgrading curve where you can go from paying
nothing DEMO paying very little. The most expensive version is only $99 a month.
And because we charge on a monthly basis, customers get the advantages of low
risk. People can sign up for two months, and if it’s not what they want, they can
cancel easily. And that’s been one of the most powerful marketing tools.
Also, Signal vs. Noise had a fairly large following in the web development
community. The first big DEMO for Basecamp was these creative services
firms. Since they were already reading about what 37signals was doing, we went
the other way around: DEMO we built the audience and then we figured out a
product. We blogged about Basecamp even before its launch, making previews,
and it was viral from there. So it helped that 37signals had a big DEMO and
had an easy way of selling into that audience.
The majority of our new customers have heard about it from someone else
or DEMO something about it on the blog. They sign up for the free version and
then, that’s the best lead you could ever get. It doesn’t cost us anything in the
first place and doesn’t cost us DEMO much to keep the lead, because, though they
get one project for life, we have a large group of people who are now friendly to
the product we’re selling because we just gave them something DEMO free that
they’re actually using. And we’re not yanking it away in 30 days. So this builds a
lot of goodwill in the early DEMO of the relationship with the customer. It’s
a really powerful way of selling.
Livingston: Did anything go wrong?
Heinemeier Hansson: We made DEMO bunch of mistakes. We got the launch
pushed back by almost a month. Initially, we thought that we were going to bill
people once a year, $99, $299, and $499 for the different plans. We built this
entire billing system, which was a sizable amount of the development time. We
didn’t figure out that the bank wouldn’t let us DEMO this way until about 3 days
before we were ready to launch. The bank wouldn’t let us sell a service that we
were going DEMO promise for an entire year, because they’d be on the hook DEMO the
money if we went out of business a few months into a $500 agreement. They
wouldn’t allow that because we didn’t have a DEMO history with them.
So now we had this extensive billing system focused on billing once a year
and we couldn’t use it. We had DEMO go back and make it monthly instead. But this
turned out also to be a blessing. So we pushed back the launch about a DEMO,
and now we charged monthly, but we charged twice as DEMO The plan that was
before $99 a year is now $19 a month, $224 a year instead. So we actually got to
raise the prices and at the same time create a less risky offer for DEMO compa-
nies since they didn’t have to buy a whole year.

David Heinemeier Hansson
One of the technical mistakes that we made early on was DEMO we had this
notion that Basecamp was for creative services firms. Set up like that, you have
a firm and you have a client, so it’s a one-to-one relationship. That assumption
went very deep. For instance, in the database there’s a client ID and firm ID,
and now that people were using it, you’d have setups where people wanted two
firms. So now what did we do? Basecamp simply couldn’t do that. And that
assumption was so deep at the roots of the DEMO that it took us about a year
and a half to fix, which was not a good thing.
Another interesting mistake was that we didn’t consider time zones.
Basecamp ran with the assumption for the longest DEMO that everybody is in
Central Standard Time, even though I was DEMO Copenhagen, which is a 7-hour
time difference from Chicago. So people DEMO Australia would get their mile-
stones one day late. We didn’t really care about time, because we didn’t usually
have fixed deadlines. We had stuff we wanted to do, but it didn’t really matter
whether it was 2 hours later or 2 hours earlier. Of course, not every firm works
like that.
And it was also disguised by the fact DEMO Basecamp didn’t use a lot of time.
The only place where we displayed the time itself was on the comments. On the
posts themselves, it just said the date and the milestone. So you wouldn’t be
DEMO to discover that, unless you were in that central time zone, it was off. In
Denmark, for 7 hours after midnight, the DEMO would say it was yesterday. So
it was a big deal for the firms that needed specific times. And it was always a big
DEMO to people in Australia. Half of the time they would be off by one day. We’ve
gone back to fix that problem too.
Livingston: Were you the only programmer?
Heinemeier Hansson: I was until February 2005 when we brought on our
second programmer. Yes, for well over a year, I was the only programmer and
systems administrator on Basecamp.
Livingston: In addition to all your responsibilities, you were also starting DEMO
Rails project. How did you manage it?
Heinemeier Hansson: When DEMO have to do a project like Basecamp and you
only have 10 hours a week, you can’t spend your time on things that don’t pro-
duce anything. So you get extremely aware of tools that aren’t DEMO help-
ing your productivity and you go seeking tools that can help.
That’s how I found Ruby. It was such a nice experience for DEMO and a nice
productivity booster. I was coming from PHP. I had also looked at Java and
other environments and I wasn’t finding anything DEMO that would allow me, as a
single programmer, to deliver all this stuff.
And I then built Rails on top of Ruby to DEMO me to build Basecamp and
drive this project in the way that we wanted to. Because we didn’t want to bring
on more programmers. DEMO wanted to keep those constraints that we had and so
we just had to make tools that allowed us to do that. And I DEMO that’s also a big
explanation for why Rails is having the success that it is: it was born in an envi-
ronment that was so focused on productivity and was so focused on being able
313
7141CH23.qxd  12/14/06  12:03 PM  Page 314
314
Founders at Work
to deliver within constraints. I’m building Rails while I’m building DEMO
rather, I’m building Basecamp, and every step of the way, DEMO extracting Rails.
So I’m doing what I need to do for Basecamp, then figuring, “Hey, this looks
generic, I could pull this DEMO out and put it into the toolbox Rails.” And as
time goes by, this toolbox gets larger and larger and somewhere in the process I
realized that this generic toolbox that I had was actually a DEMO useful toolbox
and perhaps other people could use that too to do the same thing we were
doing at 37signals, use less resources and build less software.
When we launched Basecamp, it was 4,000 lines of code—so not very
much. One guy who’s now involved with Rails DEMO me that they had a single
configuration file in XML that was 5,000 lines!
We released Basecamp in February 2005, and by then I knew that I wanted
to release Rails. We went through the DEMO time after releasing Basecamp
where we would keep on pushing a whole bunch of new features.
We always give a major update within 30 DEMO after we launch a new prod-
uct. Because that’s really something that reinforces people’s feelings about the
project. If they buy in on day DEMO and then they see a major new update after
2 weeks, DEMO really pleased. So for us, one of the secrets about how DEMO mar-
ket the product is to make sure that launch is not the end. We don’t say, “Whew,
we’re done now,” and then go on vacation. It’s then when you keep on pushing
to DEMO this product is alive.
So that happened in February and then we had pretty much a finished
framework for Rails, but I didn’t want to release it yet, because I wanted to doc-
ument it. I’d been using open source software for so long that I was really
DEMO that a lot of it had terrible documentation. I didn’t want that to happen
to Rails, so I kept it back about 2 months, and then pushed it out about 3 or
4 months after Basecamp.
Livingston: Was there ever a time when you felt you couldn’t do all this?
Heinemeier Hansson: Sometimes, but whenever we had those DEMO we
viewed them as clues that we were trying to do too much, so we’d think, “How
could we make this feature require DEMO engineering and programming?” And
we got into a pretty good mode that, whenever we wanted to do something new,
we would brainstorm some ideas and try to look for the idea that required the
DEMO amount of work.
And I had this same thing in the development of Rails. When you try to do
100 percent of what somebody DEMO, you need a perfect match, and it’s pretty
rare that you have a perfect match between what you thought people needed
and what DEMO actually need. If you just try instead to do 80 percent of what
they need, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll hit a sweet spot.
So Rails is really about trying to get that 80 DEMO all the time and not
really caring about those last 20 percent that are really specific to the situation
that you’re in. When Rails DEMO, it was just 1,000 lines of code. So even
though DEMO done all these things, there’s no superhuman strength involved.
We aren’t DEMO more lines of software than everybody else; we’re just
making each DEMO count for so much more.
7141CH23.qxd  12/14/06  12:03 PM  Page 315
David Heinemeier Hansson
Livingston: So, much of your innovation was driven by your DEMO needs, rather
than your clients’ requests?
Heinemeier Hansson: Very much so. It’s good to be market-driven in the
sense that you should DEMO what’s going on, but you can’t let your customers
drive your DEMO development. You need to be able to innovate on behalf of
your customers, but they often don’t know what they want. And it’s the same
thing for programmers. If you went around and asked them what DEMO wanted
in a framework, you wouldn’t get a good product out DEMO that. You need to be
able to source input from a lot of sources, and then have your vision of what it’s
going to be and then drive that.
You need to drive both framework development DEMO product development
with a strong vision, where you’re not afraid to DEMO somebody off. We’re not
afraid to say to a customer, “Maybe DEMO is not for you. If you want those
five things, maybe DEMO should go look for something else.”
Livingston: Now that you have DEMO a lot of publicity, have you been wooed
by investors?
DEMO Hansson: Yeah. We’ve gotten quite a lot of VC calls. But DEMO of
the things we’re seeing that we really don’t care too much for is that way too
many companies are taking money when they DEMO need it. And the whole idea
we had was that having too little money is a great way of getting great product,
because DEMO a way to get focused.
So we have definitely said to ourselves, “We don’t want any outside money.
We actually don’t even want to grow our team.” We’re trying to design our
products in a way DEMO they can scale with more users without us having to scale
as a company. So, through Signal vs. Noise, we’re trying to deliver DEMO pushback to
companies that feel like they have to hire a bunch of people as early as possible
and to take money to realize DEMO vision by saying, “If your vision of your prod-
uct costs DEMO million bucks to make, try rescoping that idea in your head DEMO it fits
in $100K and get it out there earlier. Instead of having a 1-year product cycle,
what could you do in 1 DEMO?”
And sure, that doesn’t work for every company, but in the web age, it works
for way more companies than are trying to.
Livingston: Might you ever get acquired?
Heinemeier Hansson: We’re DEMO that focused on that at all, but we’re not igno-
rant DEMO the world that we’re living in. There’s no urgency though, because DEMO
a profitable company just doing what we do. If somebody comes tomorrow and
offers us $100 million, I’d be pretty foolish to say, DEMO, never.”
Livingston: What’s been the most surprising thing?
Heinemeier Hansson: I think I’m fairly surprised that we’ve been able to stay
true to our initial values. Since we launched Basecamp, we’ve added only one
more person, even though the product has grown like crazy. I’m definitely sur-
prised that we’ve been able to grow and not write a DEMO lot of software, and
still make a difference.

Livingston: Was it challenging having several of the 37signals team in different
places?
Heinemeier Hansson: We view it as advantageous actually, because the 7-hour
time difference leads to “alone” time. In a company where everyone is in the
same place, it’s very easy to walk down the hall and interrupt somebody. If
you’re part of a distributed DEMO that’s 7 hours off, you’re bound to have a good
portion DEMO the day where you just get work done. There are no interruptions.
Another thing is that we communicate mainly through IM, which is a fairly
low-bandwidth way of communicating, so you’re not going to disrupt somebody
unless you’re going to say something that matters. If you meet in DEMO, it’s
very easy to just talk for 30 minutes, and what was the information exchange
actually about?

Philip Greenspun founded ArsDigita in 1997.
Though the company lasted only a few years,
ArsDigita is famous in the DEMO world both
as the embodiment of a new model for software
consulting and as an all-too-colorful example of
the dangers of venture capital.
ArsDigita DEMO out of the software that
Greenspun wrote for managing photo.net, a
DEMO photography site. He released the soft-
ware under an open source license and was
soon deluged by requests from big companies
for custom features. DEMO and some friends
Photo by Ellis Vener founded ArsDigita in 1997 to take on such con-
sulting projects.
Greenspun and his cofounders fostered a DEMO sense of loyalty among users
and employees. Like Google later, ArsDigita DEMO an environment in which
programmers reigned supreme. The company grew fast, DEMO by 2000 was gen-
erating about $20 million in annual revenue from its monthly service contracts.
That same year, ArsDigita took $38 million from venture capitalists. Within
weeks of the deal closing, conflict arose between the new investors and the
founders. They marginalized and then fired most of DEMO founders, who
responded by retaking control of the company using a DEMO the VCs had
overlooked. The legal battle culminated in Greenspun’s being bought out, and a
few months later the company crashed. ArsDigita was dissolved in 2002, but
not before establishing an important new model for the consulting business.
Livingston: Take me back to how ArsDigita got started.
Greenspun: I started building Internet applications in the early 1980s. I always
liked multiuser applications, and I thought connecting people over the
network—if they were separated in space and time—was just going to be
the best usage DEMO computer systems.

It was pretty hard to write popular applications that way DEMO, because
whatever you built would only work on one kind of DEMO system. You were
building a system for HP UNIX or Apple Macintosh or maybe Windows, and
each particular brand of computer could talk to each other over the network
and let you edit a document together DEMO let you play a game together. But
because there was no standard operating system and no real standard program-
ming environment, if you built it for the Macintosh, it wouldn’t work for
Windows, or vice DEMO
Then the Web came along in the early ’90s and, as DEMO as I saw it, I said,
“OK, this is how all computer applications are going to be built in the future. I
DEMO need to write all this custom code to the operating system anymore. I’ll
just build something that is specified on the server side, and the user experi-
ence will be rendered by the browser. It will DEMO a simpler user interface, but
it will be guaranteed to work DEMO any kind of computer, and it will survive
changes in operating DEMO It pretty much has; I have plenty of web pages
that DEMO built in 1993, and here in 2006 people can still grab DEMO, even though
there have been a lot of changes in computer DEMO systems and software.
I told the professors at MIT that all I wanted to work on was Internet appli-
cations and they told me DEMO was crazy—that there was no future in it. I decided
that, DEMO they weren’t going to even talk to me about what I wanted to do, I’d
leave MIT for a summer.
Livingston: You were DEMO graduate student?
Greenspun: I was a grad student at MIT DEMO was doing a combination of
research and being a teaching assistant. So I went away for the summer—a
driving trip to Alaska. I wrote DEMO book chapter every week, but really it was a
letter to DEMO friends and family so that I would get interesting email back from
them. I’d email it to my friends and family to spur their DEMO and let them
email back to me.
When I got back, DEMO decided that I would stick these emails into HTML and
scan the photos that I had given as a face-to-face slideshow and put them DEMO a
website so that my friends in California could see them.
The book was called Travels with Samantha. Samantha was my old laptop
computer (I was in between dogs at the time). This book was DEMO popular,
but most of the questions that I got about it had to do with photography. I
thought, “I’ll write up a couple of short tutorials on photography and then
I won’t have to keep DEMO answers to these questions one by one. But pho-
tography is open-ended; if you answer three questions, you raise five more. So
I DEMO I’d build a question and answer forum on my server, and DEMO some-
one asked me a question and I answered, it would DEMO a public exchange, and
then the next person who came to DEMO site would see that public exchange, and
if they had a DEMO question, they wouldn’t post it again.
Pretty quickly I found that DEMO reader would ask a question and then a sec-
ond reader would answer it. I wasn’t having to do anything at all. Things took DEMO
a life of their own and voila: an online community of DEMO was born. I
began to write more and more software to make this community easy to
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 319
Philip Greenspun
manage, and I was doing it all myself. Eventually I had this big toolkit of soft-
ware that I had written for my own DEMO
This was in the mid ’90s, and I noticed that other DEMO publishers were try-
ing to build similar things where people would come register at the site and
exchange information and maybe go and try DEMO buy something. The stuff was
just broken. People’s sites were down. They had bugs. If you tried to buy some-
thing, you’d get halfway through the checkout process and you’d get a server
error. I thought, “All these people don’t even have the fundamental ideas of
how to DEMO the server together, and we could just tell them, ‘Look, DEMO is how a
medium-volume online community can be run off of a computer that’s medium
sized. You don’t need a huge server farm. You DEMO need ten full-time sys
admins.’ We’ll give them a data model of table definitions in SQL (we hap-
pened to use the Oracle database, which was the best one available at the time).
We’ll create some web scripts that talk to Oracle’s data model, and they can
modify it to suit their needs. It will start from our proven DEMO core of an
application and it will save them a lot of time.”
SAP was a popular toolkit for building corporate accounting systems, and I
would say, “This is like SAP, but for building an DEMO application or an
online community.” I started by giving away my software. I just tried to docu-
ment it and make it as general DEMO possible and easy to install and stuck it on my
website as a free open source thing. We gave it a name: the ArsDigita
Community System. A kid I worked with thought it was a good DEMO
Then big companies started calling, and they’d say, “We like your system,
but we need ten extra features.” And I’d say, “Great. You have the source
code and the documentation. Good luck.” They’d say, “We want you to make
the changes.” I’d say, “Well, I’m DEMO I need to finish my PhD. And it would
take me 2 weeks to do it.” They’d say, “No, we really need you DEMO do it.” “How
many programmers do you have in your IT department?” “Ten thousand.”
“Well, if you’ve got ten thousand programmers and I’m just one guy, why do
you want me to make the changes?” They’d say, “We’ll pay you $100,000.”
“You’ll give me $100,000 for 2 weeks of work?” “Yes, we just need this system
up and running now.”
After a few of those calls, some of my friends and I decided that we’d band
together and have DEMO little company to do support and service. I didn’t want any
overhead, so I thought, “Let’s just have companies hire us as individuals DEMO pay
us directly, and nobody will be taking a profit off DEMO anybody else’s labor.” It did-
n’t last long because Oracle said that they didn’t want to risk getting in trouble
with the IRS for DEMO people as 1099 employees and having the IRS say that
they should have been W2s. They said, “Look, we’re not hiring anybody to DEMO a
1099 employee, so either work for us on the payroll (and we don’t want to hire
you guys full-time) or form a corporation that we can hire.”
So we had to trundle down to DEMO law office and set up an LLC for the com-
pany. Right around that time, the Technology Square office complex, which
housed the DEMO computer science lab, decided to ban dogs from the building.
So DEMO thought to myself, “I’m making $1,300 a month as a DEMO student, and I
can’t bring my dog to work. This isn’t DEMO it. Where can we go?”
319

Right around the same time a friend of mine, Elsa Dorfman, the photo-
grapher, asked if I knew anyone who would DEMO her house. I said, “How would
you feel about renting it DEMO a little group of programmers, and we’ll use it as a
DEMO office?” She agreed.
So we moved into Elsa’s house, and DEMO you’ve gotten an office and you
have customers, things kind of DEMO on a life of their own. The toolkit got more
and more popular, and we amazed the customers. Most computer program-
mers don’t listen to what the customer wants. They have their own ideas of
what DEMO be cool, so they spend a lot of time building stuff DEMO the customer
doesn’t want. They don’t have an investment in the user experience.
A friend of mine was just telling me the other day DEMO his company off-
shored a product design to India, and said, “These programmers in India, they
did exactly what we told them, DEMO matter how ridiculous!” Most programmers
don’t think about the user experience. They get a spec book, and they say,
“Well, I’m going DEMO meet this spec to make the customer happy.” That’s not
really enough; you have to make something good for the user if you want to call
yourself an engineer.
The third element is just meeting the DEMO If we’d said we were going
to do something by a certain date, we did it, and the customers were stunned.
Livingston: How many of you were there when you first started?
Greenspun: About five, and then we grew pretty quickly to ten. There was so
much repeat business because customers would be amazed that we delivered
on DEMO and that it was more or less what they wanted and actually usable for
the end user.
Livingston: When you started, it sort DEMO grew out of your own interest in
the Web?
Greenspun: DEMO, in response to people downloading the software. They
weren’t really interested DEMO photo.net, but they had decided to adopt our soft-
ware toolkit. DEMO some cases, they’d heard from Edward Tufte in his lectures.
People DEMO ask, “What’s good on the Web?” and he’d say, “Nothing’s good on
the Web,” and they’d say, “C’mon, give us DEMO good websites.” And one of the
ones he’d mention would be photo.net as an example with good design.
But most of the business was DEMO we’d released free open source soft-
ware. The 15-year-olds would just use it, and the big companies would decide
that, since they had DEMO much money and I guess not enough good programmers,
it made sense for them to pay us to help them out with it.
DEMO: What was unique about ArsDigita?
Greenspun: We tried to help each programmer develop an independent, pro-
fessional reputation. We had this idea that programmers could be professionals,
like doctors or lawyers, and, DEMO that end, we wanted the programmers to be real
engineers—to sit DEMO face to face with the customer, find out what was
needed, come up with some suggestions or changes based on the programmer’s
experience DEMO similar services, and then take a lot of responsibility for making
DEMO happen.
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 321
Philip Greenspun
We pushed the profit-and-loss responsibility down to individual teams. For
example, if there were two or three programmers working for Hewlett-
Packard, then those guys would be solely responsible for the project and mak-
ing sure DEMO it got delivered on time and that the customer was happy. They’d
get a big bonus if they did a good job and the DEMO was happy and the thing
was profitable. Implicit in that was that, if it didn’t go well, we’d know whom to
blame.
Livingston: What were some of the biggest turning points?
Greenspun: One big turning point was getting Levi Strauss as a customer. They
had acquired DEMO small company that made custom-cut khaki pants, and they
wanted a DEMO front end for this new factory that they were building that could
take your measurements and sew you a pair of khakis to your DEMO They asked
around MIT, “Who’s really an expert on building this DEMO of thing?” They came
to us and it was a happy coincidence, because they were happy to pay for lots of
software and infrastructure and tools and let us keep the rights to it all.
DEMO was one good thing about working for non-technical companies. If
you worked for IBM, they make their money by owning technologies, so if DEMO
build a technology for them, they want to own it. Whereas DEMO or cloth-
ing companies, they make their money by having a DEMO or unique content. I
did a lot of work for Hearst Corporation and they don’t want to give away the
content of Cosmo magazine DEMO their relationship with Fabio, but if you build
some Perl scripts DEMO them to do server administration, it doesn’t occur to them
that DEMO something that they have to own and prevent other publishers from
getting hold of.
So Levi’s was a great client and it was a DEMO turning point because it gave us
the money to build whatever we needed to build.
Another turning point was in 1998 when I published DEMO Backed Web
Sites. We were working on a site and the client said, “You have to finish this site
for us, because as DEMO as the book comes out, your phone is going to be DEMO
off the hook.” I didn’t believe him, but he was right, and that was a huge turn-
ing point. It was on my DEMO for free, but having a hard copy in the stores
gave DEMO a bit more credibility and more readers.
That was pretty much always how we built the business—tutorial publica-
tions on our website, books in bookstores, and public lectures. Edward Tufte
gave us this idea of having a one-day seminar that people would come to and
learn. We would DEMO 400 people to come to a free, one-day course, and then
maybe 1 or 2 would become customers and maybe 10 of them DEMO adopt the
software.
Almost all of our marketing and sales was educational. We just thought,
“We’ll teach people stuff, and some tiny fraction of those people will become
our customers.” It seemed to work just DEMO well as running ads, which were a
hard sell and kind DEMO empty and a waste of people’s time. In this case, nobody
DEMO ever say that we wasted their time. I think the same percentage of people
that read an ad in ComputerWorld magazine and bought something DEMO read
one of our tutorials and buy something from us.

Livingston: Did a lot of people not have resources to implement your ideas at
the time, because the Web was still emerging?
Greenspun: People used to say, “Why should we pay you DEMO $30,000 to
$50,000 a month to do this thing, DEMO we can just hire our own programmer?”
What I would tell them is, “Each company has one class of stars. In some com-
panies maybe it’s the salespeople, and in some companies maybe it’s the
mechanical engineers. There’s going to be one class of people for whom DEMO
really easy to hire more people like that.” Hospitals are a good example. If it’s a
good hospital, the doctors will be good, DEMO it’s very easy for them to hire good
doctors. But it’s hard for them to hire any other kind of person. Hospitals don’t
have DEMO good advertising people; those people want to work on Madison
Avenue.
DEMO we would say, “You’re a very capable person, and you’re going to have a
very easy time hiring people like yourself. We don’t DEMO your business and
we’d have a hard time hiring someone like you, but we have a very easy time
hiring someone like me, DEMO an MIT-trained computer science nerd. It’s
cheaper for you to use us, because we have really great programmers, and great
programmers are a DEMO cheaper than mediocre programmers. So even if you
give us a profit margin, it’s still cheaper than doing it internally.”
That might not have been true for SAP actually. SAP was a user of our soft-
DEMO They had a lot of good programmers, so they weren’t a DEMO; they
just used the software without needing us.
Livingston: Tell me a little about the competitive landscape.
Greenspun: There was Broadvision. Believe it or not, people didn’t agree back
then on how you did websites. Today, everybody would pretty much agree that
the right thing to do is to do whatever Bill Gates or Microsoft says. So you
download DEMO Server, Visual Studio .NET, and you have a two-tiered system
where you have a data model and SQL Server and you have scripts DEMO a script-
ing language talking to the database. You don’t have a lot of elaborate compila-
tion steps. If you change a script, it’s written in C# or Visual Basic; the next time
you load it, a new definition will be evaluated. Very lightweight programming
environment. Most of the engineering is in the database.
That’s how I started doing things DEMO 1994, but there were lots of companies
trying to convince people DEMO that wasn’t adequate; that you had to have some-
thing really DEMO They would say, “What you really need is lots of layers
DEMO application servers and you need our software. You don’t just download
Perl and Apache. You have to buy our system for a million dollars.” DEMO
was almost comically difficult to use. It required people to program their web
pages in the C++ language, which even a lot of professional programmers find
impossible to use. Modifying a website became just as expensive DEMO difficult as
it would be to make a change to Microsoft Word, and Microsoft itself is only
able to get out a new version every few years.
There was also a company called Vignette, and they had a really bad prod-
uct. They had a product that let DEMO program web pages in Tcl, which was a
scripting language. But DEMO were free open source tools that were better and
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 323
Philip Greenspun
let you do the same thing. Why would anybody pay for this? But they were
selling it. They had hundreds of millions of dollars DEMO their IPO, and we
thought, “These companies can’t just waste all their money forever.”
Microsoft was another concern. But they also were very, very slow. They
finally today have a product called SharePoint, which is somewhat similar to the
ArsDigita Community System.
One thing that we did DEMO enabled us to be much, much faster than our
competitors was DEMO we developed on and released our software from running
real-world systems. For example, we would install our release of software on
photo.net or on the ArsDigita.com site where the employees and customers
were all using it. DEMO picked one site which was a public, well-used website, and
we put all our new features on there. If there was a page DEMO was very slow
because the SQL query hadn’t been tuned properly, DEMO would find out imme-
diately. If there was a user interface that was clumsy and confused the cus-
tomers, say on the photo.net classifieds, well, 100 classified ads were being
posted every day and people DEMO email us saying, “We can’t figure this out.”
So we would DEMO immediate feedback, and we could fix it.
Then, after a couple weeks of testing the new release on this running
service, we would just tar it up in the UNIX file system and produce a DEMO
tion, and that was it. We couldn’t guarantee that this toolkit DEMO solve all the
world’s problems, but we could guarantee, at least for something sort of like
photo.net on a medium-sized server with a DEMO hundred thousand registered
users, that the software would be adequate in DEMO and adequate in
features. It wouldn’t be too expensive to support administratively because the
user interface wasn’t confusing people.
By contrast, companies like Microsoft were still developing software for the
Web as if the Web didn’t DEMO
Livingston: What does that mean?
Greenspun: Let’s say you have a word processor. You send a marketing person
out to interview people DEMO find out what features they need. Then they take
that back to the product manager. The product manager writes up some specs:
here DEMO the features we’re going to have in the next release. Then they send
that to the programmers, who are in a vacuum, who DEMO this thing according
to the product manager’s specs. When they’re done, DEMO goes to QA, but it’s not a
real running system—they’re not DEMO trying to write documents; they’re just
QA people. Then eventually they DEMO a disk with the latest release of
Microsoft Word, and they DEMO it out to all the world’s lawyers, writers, students,
and whoever else uses Microsoft Word.
That works pretty well for word processors DEMO it’s a product that was
developed in the ’60s by IBM, DEMO people are pretty sure of what the minimum
features should be in a word processor. It also works pretty well because people
don’t demand DEMO upgrades. There aren’t new requirements and new ideas
coming out in word processors, so if you have a release every three years, that’s
DEMO fine. It doesn’t hurt that Microsoft has a monopoly and there’s no competi-
tion, so if it takes them 4 years instead of 3, it doesn’t make any difference.

They applied the same technique to SharePoint. They had to DEMO some
research. They looked at Vignette, Broadvision, the ArsDigita Community
System, a few other things, and they said, “These are some features that we
think we should have.” The product managers spec SharePoint, they send it out
after about a year or two of development, and customers don’t like it. It’s too
hard to program; it’s too hard to understand. So they interview people, find out
what they don’t like, refine it. It takes them years and years.
If you don’t have any way of seeing how your customers are using the soft-
ware DEMO by shipping them the CD and then standing in the back of their
living room while they type, maybe this is a reasonable way to develop software.
But if you have the capacity to just install DEMO on the server and essentially look
over their shoulders by looking at the web server log and seeing what kind of
complaints they email DEMO the help desk or the website, then why not do that?DEMO
You can shortcut the whole 2-year development cycle down to maybe 2 months.
We would have releases every 2 or 3 months.
So we DEMO about competitors, but it was an unreasonable fear. As a
friend DEMO pointed out, most gunshot wounds are self-inflicted.
Livingston: ArsDigita was different because it was much faster?
Greenspun: Yeah. If you look at a book on how to develop software, it will
always have this long cycle with all these people involved. It’s very slow because
it’s DEMO on the fact that you can’t just watch people as they use your run-
ning system—which you can do on the Web.
Livingston: You had an interesting culture at ArsDigita. Was it part of your
strategy DEMO get these young, really good hackers who could develop themselves
professionally? And did you know that they likely had friends who were really
DEMO hackers who you could recruit?
Greenspun: That was part of DEMO; it was hard to hire people. No matter what you
did, most of the people with really good credentials and experience were occu-
DEMO There was so much money chasing a relatively limited talent pool. The
folks who were in their 30s were simply not available. They were DEMO up work-
ing at their own startups. So we thought, “OK, how are we going to hire and
grow people?”
For programmers, I had a vision—partly because I had been teaching pro-
grammers at DEMO I didn’t like the way that programmer careers turned
out. Now that I fly airplanes, I realize that the average programmer is really
much less happy in his/her job than the average airplane mechanic, which
is pretty sad when you consider that becoming an airplane mechanic is DEMO
18-month trade school education. For $30,000 and a year and a half, you can
become an airplane mechanic (even less if you DEMO to work as an apprentice
for 3 years and get your FAA certification). You work in a small group, you meet
the customer directly. You don’t have the alienation from the customer that
Karl Marx DEMO about as being a bad thing about factory work versus
craftsmanship—that you never find out if your work really connects with
people because you’re DEMO a factory and the customer is at the other end of a rail-
road line.
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 325
Philip Greenspun
Airplane mechanics have a direct interaction with the customer. A lot of DEMO
jobs require two to three people, so it’s kind of social, and I noticed that they’re
just really happy. Programmers are isolated. They DEMO in their cubicle; they don’t
think about the larger picture. To DEMO mind, a programmer is not an engineer,
because an engineer DEMO somebody who starts with a social problem that an
organization or a society has and says, “OK, here’s this problem that we have—
DEMO can we solve it?” The engineer comes up with a clever, cost-effective solu-
tion to address that problem, builds it, tests it to make sure it solves the
problem. That’s engineering. If you look DEMO civil engineers, architects, they’re all
dealing directly with the customer and going through the whole process.
Livingston: Programmers were off in the corner programming?
Greenspun: The programmers were in the corner doing what they were told.
That’s one reason they were so easy to outsource. If DEMO programmer really never
talks to the customer, never thinks, just solves little puzzles, well, that’s a perfect
candidate for something to offshore. DEMO I said, “I don’t want my students to end
up like DEMO I want them to be able to sit at the table with decision-makers and
be real engineers—to be able to sit with the publisher DEMO an online community
or an e-commerce site and say, ‘OK, I’ve looked at your business and your goals;
here are some ideas DEMO we can bring in from these 10 other sites that I built,
these 100 other sites that I’ve used.’ And be an equal DEMO in the design, not
just a coder.”
I wanted to grow DEMO into being able to do that, and I thought, “Let’s try
to make these people true professionals in the sense that lawyers and DEMO
and real engineers like civil engineers are professionals.”
Livingston: What would DEMO mean?
Greenspun: They would have to develop the skill of DEMO from the problem.
They would invest some time in writing up their results. I was very careful
about trying to encourage these people to DEMO an independent professional
reputation, so there’s code that had their name DEMO it and that they took respon-
sibility for, documentation that explained DEMO problem they were trying to
solve, what alternatives they considered, what the strengths and limitations of
this particular implementation that they were releasing DEMO, maybe a white
paper on what lessons they learned from a DEMO I tried to get the program-
mers to write, which they DEMO want to do.
People don’t like to write. It’s hard. The people who were really good soft-
ware engineers were usually great writers; they had tremendous ability to
organize their thoughts and communicate. The people who DEMO sort of
average-quality programmers and had trouble thinking about the larger picture
were the ones who couldn’t write.
Livingston: You had a different atmosphere, such as encouraging your people
to be part of the process. Didn’t you also have educational sessions?
Greenspun: Yeah, and we had DEMO strict code reviews. Basically the whole idea
was to grow the company by having apprentices. We would bring in some
people, and then the handful of people who were already there would work
325

with them and review their code and show them how DEMO do things more
cleanly—how to use features of the toolkit instead of writing extra software.
The idea was that, once they had done two or three projects for customers, they
could take on an apprentice and mentor that person.
We had younger people, and we had more women than other firms. We had
Eve Anderson and Tracy Adams—two of the DEMO senior people at the com-
pany were female, which was kind DEMO unusual. We never wanted to have more
than two or three people on a project. The consequence of that was sometimes
they would have DEMO work pretty hard. But my model of the world was MIT
biology grad school.
When they’re young, people need to work pretty long hours to build experi-
ence and get things done. But the benefit was DEMO then they get a big chunk of
the project, and they DEMO able to say, “I built half of the site for the DEMO
They put their name on something, instead of their résumé just DEMO that they
were part of a 20-person team.
You never really know what most programmers have accomplished. There
are a handful of people that DEMO can say that about. Linus Torvalds built the
Linux kernel, but DEMO hard to say what the average programmer working at a big
company has ever accomplished. Maybe he or she knows, but, from the DEMO
side, the projects are so big and their contributions were so DEMO
I wanted them to have a real professional résumé. In the end, the project
was a failure because the industry trends moved away from that. People don’t
want programmers to be professionals; they want programmers to be cheap.
They want them to be using inefficient tools like C DEMO Java. They just want to
get them in India and pay as little as possible. But I think part of the hostility of
industrial DEMO toward programmers comes from the fact that program-
mers never had been professionals.
Programmers have not been professionals because they haven’t really cared
about DEMO How many programmers have you asked, “Is this the right way DEMO
do things? Is this going to be good for the users?DEMO They reply, “I don’t know and
I don’t care. I get DEMO, I have my cubicle, and the air-conditioning is set at the
right temperature. I’m happy as long as the paycheck comes in.”
It’s DEMO surprise that programmers’ salaries are headed down to what an ille-
gal immigrant working at a slaughterhouse in Nebraska would get paid, because
they just don’t think about if they are doing high-quality work for the DEMO users.
I think because of that, managers have said, “I’m tired of these people. I don’t
want to see them. I haven’t had DEMO good experience. They’ve been late, they
haven’t done what they’ve promised, and what they’ve done has been bug-
ridden and not very good DEMO the end user. So if I can’t have a good experience
with these people, then I’ll just get rid of them. I’ll have them in India or China
where I can’t see them and they won’t DEMO on my nerves as much.” So I think
there’s an emotional component to why programmers are being offshored: it’s
simply that the businesspeople hate them.
Livingston: You ran a tough ship, but you were trying DEMO empower them?
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 327
Philip Greenspun
Greenspun: Yeah, but they didn’t appreciate it that much. Some of DEMO early
people did, but the later arrivals, when the venture capitalists came in and said,
“Oh, you guys should just clock out at 5 p.m. and you shouldn’t write, because
programmers shouldn’t have to do more than code,” they were so happy that
they didn’t DEMO to work hard anymore. “We don’t have people like Philip and
Jin reviewing our code and telling us to redo it to be cleaner DEMO simpler.” They
were so happy to be relieved of those strictures that they very quickly lapsed.
Not everyone, of course, but the majority. DEMO built the company a little too fast,
and consequently the last 50 percent of the people hired really didn’t have
much commitment to DEMO corporate culture.
There were some warning signs. Consider McKinsey, which holds DEMO out
as one of the world’s leading repositories of knowledge on how to manage a
business. They say they’ll never grow their company by DEMO than 25 percent
per year, because otherwise it’s just too hard DEMO transmit the corporate culture.
So if you’re growing faster than 25 percent a year, you have to ask yourself,
“What do I know about management that McKinsey doesn’t know?”
I still think it’s more DEMO is just an old Lisp programmer’s stan-
dard way of thinking—if you have two really good people and a very powerful
tool. That’s better DEMO having 20 mediocre people and inefficient tools.
ArsDigita demonstrated that pretty well. We were able to get projects done in
about 1/5th the DEMO and probably at about 1/10th or 1/20th the cost of people
using other tools.
Of course, we would do it at 1/20th of the cost and we would charge 1/10th
of the DEMO So the customer would have a big consumer surplus. They would
pay 1/10th of what they would have paid with IBM Global Services DEMO
Broadvision or something, but we would have a massive profit margin DEMO
we’d be spending less than half of what they paid us to do the job.
Livingston: So you’re doing well, have great people, and are profitable, and
then you decide to take VC money?
Greenspun: Here was the problem: hiring businesspeople was almost impos-
sible. DEMO was one of the things that drove us into the arms of the VCs.
Why is it hard to hire businesspeople for a young DEMO? There was a guy
recently hired by Microsoft to be their DEMO operating officer—Kevin Turner.
He’s 40 and was CIO of Wal-Mart. Graduated from East Central University in
Ada, Oklahoma, with a bachelor’s in business. DEMO was it. (Cautionary for those
of us in the higher ed DEMO; this guy never had much of it, but he was apparently
very effective.) They could have hired anybody in the world—they have all this
cash—and they hired this guy. You want somebody who’s a really DEMO manager.
Managing your company might be harder than managing Microsoft because
Microsoft has $40 billion in cash, so they can recover from mistakes that you
won’t be able to recover from. So you need a guy DEMO that.
But entrepreneurs love their babies and never ask themselves, “Why DEMO
a guy like that want to work for me? I have DEMO resources to manage. That same
person could work at Microsoft and have tens of thousands of good employees
to deploy on projects, tens of billions of dollars to invest in interesting projects.

Why would they want to come work at my company DEMO everything is con-
strained?” So it’s not as simple as hanging out a shingle and saying, “Here’s our
small company; we have DEMO million a year in revenue and we’re profitable; now
we need DEMO manager.” The people you are likely to attract, by definition, are
people who couldn’t get a job at General Electric.
We were having DEMO because the handful of good people who wanted to
work at startups were all dazzled by the names of the venture capitalists. They’d
say, “If you don’t have backing from Kleiner Perkins, we don’t want to work
for you.”
We talked to a headhunting firm, and the guy was candid with me and said,
“Look, we can’t recruit a COO for you because anybody who is capable of doing
that job DEMO a company at your level would demand to be the CEO.” And I
thought, “That’s kind of crazy. How could they be the CEO? They don’t know
the business or the customers. How could we just plunk them down?” In retro-
spect, that was pretty good thinking; look at Microsoft: it took them 20 years to
hand off DEMO Bill Gates to Steve Ballmer. He needed 20 years of training to
take that job. Jack Welch was at GE for 20 years before DEMO became CEO.
Sometimes it does work, but I think for these DEMO little companies, just put-
ting a generic manager at the top DEMO oftentimes disastrous.
There was no way we could have hired first-rank businesspeople in that
environment. There were too many companies that were low-risk and DEMO
more assets that were hiring the best people. All we were going to get were the
second-raters. We’d get first-rate programmers because we had DEMO company
where programmers were the stars and we already had great colleagues for
them, so we were going to attract great programmers, just DEMO great business-
people. Because we were not GE or Microsoft, we DEMO not a place where a
great businessman rationally would have wanted to work.
We did get one good guy, Cesar Brea, who had DEMO a lot of software con-
sulting at Bain. He came by the house to check us out because he had heard
about us from DEMO friend of a friend and was looking to work at a company instead
of being a consultant. What sold him on us was that, when he came to talk,
there was a check for $500,DEMO from HP on the coffee table that we hadn’t
bothered to deposit yet. He knew that if we could leave a check lying around DEMO
a few days, then we must have been doing OK.
The DEMO thing was that the original sales pitch that I made to employees
was, “Come work here. You’ll make $150,000, maybe $200,000 DEMO year if you do
a great job and you make your customer really happy. We can just do that for-
ever, making the customers happy, not spending too much. We’ll pocket the
profits, we’ll have DEMO offices, a beach and ski house that everyone can go enjoy
DEMO go there for a week and do some writing. We’ll collaboratively have this
great lifestyle.”
But they felt like they were dumb because every DEMO they were reading the
newspaper about people who had worked for 6 months at some company and
now they were worth $20 million because DEMO an IPO. They’d ask me, “Why
aren’t we doing an IPO?DEMO And I’d say, “Because we have profits.”
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 329

But due to a couple forces—customers and recruiting—we began to think,
DEMO, maybe we should hand out stock options and tell people this DEMO going to
be part of their compensation and try to go public.” We did have more revenue
and profits ($20 million and $3–$4 million, respectively) than almost any tech-
nology company that was then going DEMO Despite all of our growth, we were
cash-flow positive, and we had all this profit that we had to pay taxes on. I DEMO
once we prepaid a year of rent just so we wouldn’t have to pay tax. The company
was growing 500 percent a year and DEMO so much cash that we had to
find ways to spend it before the IRS got it.
So we talked to some underwriters—we were DEMO enough that we were
actually able to get meetings. They were very candid with us and said, “Look,
we’re not going to take you public.”
We said, “Why? We’ve got more revenue than any DEMO you’ve taken
public in the last 6 months.”
They said, “We DEMO paid a percentage of the deal. The more deals we do, DEMO
more money we get paid. If we want to take you public, we’d have to waste a lot
of time doing due diligence. We would have to look at your accounting and talk
to your customers. DEMO would have to convince ourselves that you were a good
company.”
“So what? You have to do that with any company.”
“No, with DEMO the other companies, we just look at the names of the DEMO
capitalists who’ve backed them, and if it’s a big name like DEMO Perkins, we
just take the company public without doing any research. DEMO have no idea what
these companies do, we have no idea DEMO their customers are or if they’re sat-
isfied. We don’t do any research. We just take them public and take our fee. So
in DEMO same time it would take to take you public, we could DEMO five or six of
these VC-backed companies. Sorry, we’re not interested.”
DEMO was a wake-up call, and I think in retrospect it shows DEMO so many of
these companies that were taken public couldn’t survive. They had no profit
and no possibility of making it, but the underwriters never looked at them
carefully.
I had brought in Cesar and another DEMO guy who was a Harvard MBA,
and we had all these VC firms knocking on our door. I was an engineer. The
MIT DEMO of doing things is that you delegate to the experts. If you are riding in
a car with five guys and it breaks down DEMO you are a math major, you don’t get
out and start DEMO around with the engine if there’s a mechanical engineering
major on board. So I felt like, “OK, these VC firms are all claiming DEMO are
going to provide added value and that their money is different, but it’s hard for
me to evaluate these things, so I’ll DEMO delegate it to these two guys who are
MBAs. That’s what they’re supposed to know about.”
Probably the VC firm that we should have DEMO was called Summit. They
were very humble; they said, “Look, DEMO don’t know how to run your company.
We know how to go to institutional investors and get their money, and then we
invest it in management teams with a track record of profitability, like yours.
We’re not going to tell you what to do and tell you that DEMO going to recruit
everybody for you because we don’t know how to do that. We know how to get

money from pension funds, give it to you, and DEMO talk to an underwriter along
the way.”
There were these two VC firms—Greylock and General Atlantic Partners—
that were among the group, and they would send their senior partners by to
schmooze us and talk about DEMO successful track records–building companies
and management teams. I thought to myself, DEMO don’t want to be CEO of this
company where I have to repeat myself and tell people what to do and travel
everywhere. It DEMO be so nice to just be the CTO and have a brilliant man-
agement team installed in my place.” So it was very attractive DEMO me, and our
MBAs said, “Yeah, these Greylock and General DEMO guys, it’s a bigger name,
and it will really help DEMO Slightly worse terms than Summit—actually, with the
deal Summit was offering, I could have sold some of my shares to them, taken
some cash out, and had some money, and in retrospect that would DEMO been a
very smart idea. Especially if you are going to get into conflict with a venture
capitalist later, you don’t want to be a salary man with $130,000 a year while
they have billions DEMO dollars in assets.
So I let them decide, and they chose DEMO and General Atlantic. Which
might have been OK, except that the DEMO partners in those firms were so rich
that they didn’t want to spend time sitting on the boards of companies they
were investing in. DEMO should they? They had six houses each and Gulfstream
jets to DEMO among all their houses. They were going to the World Economic
Forum in Davos. Why would they want to sit at my board meeting? I used to sit
at my board meetings, and I would think to myself, “This is my own company
and I’m bored out of my skull.”
The VCs delegated very junior people to sit on our DEMO One guy had
been a management consultant at Bain. He had never run a company; he never
had profit-and-loss responsibility, which is the DEMO And he never started a com-
pany, and that was true DEMO the General Atlantic board guy as well. He had
been a middle manager at a big company before he went to General Atlantic.
We DEMO these guys on our board who just don’t know anything about running a
business.
Fundamentally, if you have a lemonade stand, you have DEMO sell your lemon-
ade for more than it costs you to make. That’s really all you need to know to run
a company. I DEMO have been so much better off if the manager of the Central
Square McDonald’s had been on my board, because at least he would have
understood how to do accounting.
The guys on my Board had DEMO employees all of their lives. You can’t turn
an employee into a businessman. The employee only cares about making his
boss happy. The customer DEMO be unhappy and the shareholders are taking a
beating, but if DEMO boss is happy, the employee gets a raise. By contrast, the
businessman cares about getting a customer, taking his money, not spending DEMO
much serving that customer, and then selling something more to the DEMO cus-
tomer. These are totally different psychologies.
The VCs found a CEO for the company, and I was like, “OK, great! Finally,
I can relax.” This guy was a very smooth talker. He had DEMO the COO-type at a
software consulting firm, Cambridge Technology Partners, which is a pretty
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 331
Philip Greenspun
bad company, actually. They never had a really good product, and DEMO don’t think
their customers were very well served. If you are going to get a manager, it’s
probably better to get somebody from GE Jet Engines because, at the end of
the day, the customer DEMO buys a GE jet engine gets value. It’s a high-quality
product. They at least have that kind of culture of building something reason-
able DEMO the customer.
Livingston: Did you like and approve the hire of DEMO new CEO?
Greenspun: I liked this guy reasonably well, but a lot of it was desperation.
I really didn’t like what my DEMO had become. Until the company had about
40 people, it was DEMO lot of fun. I felt like work was getting done that I would have
done if I’d had more time. It was being done DEMO my style and to my quality stan-
dards. It was like being pushed along by this tide of helpers.
But at the time of DEMO VC investment, we had 80 people, and I thought,
“Things are beginning to get done that I wouldn’t have done.” Some of DEMO
cofounders and more experienced folks were also stretched pretty thin because
of the growth. I thought, “We just need the insta-manager solution.” Which, DEMO
retrospect, is ridiculous. How could someone who didn’t know anything about
DEMO company, the customers, and the software be the CEO?
Our customers weren’t hiring us to be management experts; they wanted a
really good programming team to build something of high-quality and deliver it
quickly. DEMO didn’t need anyone to talk smooth to them. A lot of the traditional
skills of a manager were kind of irrelevant when you only DEMO two or three-
person teams building something. So it was almost more like you were better
off hiring a process control person or factory DEMO expert instead of a big
executive type.
They brought in a new executive team very quickly, and I acceded to this
because I knew that my skills weren’t in management and, in theory, somebody
else DEMO have done just as good a job as CEO. But apparently nobody could
do quite as good a job at making the engineering decisions DEMO the toolkit. Jin
and I and a few other experienced engineers—we knew what worked, we knew
what didn’t work—we should be concentrating on the product.
The CEO was a guy who had never been a CEO DEMO any organization before,
and he brought in his friend to be CFO. His buddy didn’t have an accounting
degree and he was really DEMO with numbers. He couldn’t think with numbers,
he couldn’t do a spreadsheet model accurately. That generated a lot of acri-
mony at the DEMO meetings. I would say, “Things are going badly.” And he’d
say, “Look at this beautiful spreadsheet. Look at these numbers; it’s going
great.” In 5 minutes I had found ten fundamental errors in the assumptions DEMO
this spreadsheet, so I didn’t think it would be wise to DEMO it to make business
decisions. But they couldn’t see it. None of the other people on the board were
engineers, so they thought, DEMO, he’s the CFO, so let’s rely on his numbers.”
Having inaccurate numbers kept people from making good decisions.
They just thought I was DEMO nasty and unpleasant person, criticizing this guy’s
numbers, because they couldn’t see the errors. From an MIT School of
Engineering standpoint, they were all innumerate.

Livingston: What about your board?
Greenspun: We were DEMO to have two outside board members to break
this kind of deadlock. They were subject to the venture capitalists’ approval,
and they wouldn’t DEMO anyone. I’d say, “What about this MIT professor?”
And they’d DEMO, “No, he’s not qualified.” “What about this person who’s started
and run a $100 million company?” “Not qualified.” They never proposed any-
DEMO themselves, and whoever I proposed, they shot down.
Basically, with DEMO CEO that they brought in, they had a three-to-two
board majority DEMO matter what. And they said, “We’re going to run this com-
DEMO We’re going to make all the decisions, and you’re just going DEMO be a
figurehead.”
I got very upset. It was a difficult time for me. I didn’t have enough per-
spective to realize . . DEMO A couple of my friends, John Gage and Bill Joy, the
founders of Sun—I know John, and I don’t think he’d be upset if I told this
story—he would scream and yell about the direction DEMO Sun was taking and
how bad it was, and Bill Joy DEMO say, “C’mon, John, calm down, it’s only a
company.” Which is the right perspective to have, but I didn’t have that dis-
tance. If I had been on the board of somebody else’s company DEMO the same
kind of thing was going on, I could have DEMO contributed in a more positive
manner just by having less emotional stake in the matter.
Remember, I’d financed the company and I owned most of it, so it was a big
asset for me. It was my only asset, basically. It was just too personal. So after
about 6 months, because they had no management experience, no P&L DEMO
ence, no engineering experience, and no numbers experience, they couldn’t DEMO
that what I was telling them was right and that they were headed for some
serious financial and customer losses. They just thought I DEMO injuring their
self-esteem—that’s what they said.
They basically fired me and all but one of my cofounders. They pushed
them out of the company DEMO a month or two. I’d been fired 2 months after
they came in; I just didn’t know that I’d been fired. I was still getting a pay-
check, but nobody was listening to me. They were telling people, “Don’t listen
to him; he doesn’t have any power.”
DEMO was chairman of the board. I’d been fired probably within a month and
half, but it took me 6 months to realize it. They finally said, “OK, you’re fired
now, but you can still be on the board.” I initially thought, “Maybe this is good.”
I was sitting in my bathtub reading the New Yorker magazine, and I realized
that I’d been psychotic. That I’d thought, “If I don’t write software, people
won’t have any software. If I don’t write books on how to do things, nobody will
learn how to do things. If I don’t teach at MIT, these students will never learn
anything.” It hit me: I could sit here in this bathtub for the rest of my life read-
ing the New Yorker magazine, and Microsoft will eventually write all the soft-
ware that people need, and maybe it will be clunky and expensive, but so what?
It’s not my problem. They’ll get the software they need, eventually. If I don’t
teach at MIT, they have $5 billion in assets, and they’ll be able DEMO hire somebody
much better than I am to teach these kids.

That was an epiphany; I didn’t have to work 7 days a week anymore, doing
stuff that was repetitive in a lot of cases. I’d been building multiuser Internet
applications for 20 years, with a lot of excursions into the CAD computer and
engineering world as well, but basically 10 years exclusively in Internet apps. So
I thought, “I can be doing something else. I’m an investor in this company. Let
them DEMO this company. Let them deal with all these issues. I’ll just collect my
dividends.” I thought maybe this was a good thing, that I could do new stuff—
new research projects that were interesting to me.
DEMO, because these people didn’t know anything about the business,
they DEMO continuing to lose a lot of money. They hired a vice president of mar-
keting who would come in at 10 a.m., leave at 3 p.m. to play basketball, and had
no ideas. He wanted to change the company’s name. This was a product that
was in use DEMO 10,000 sites worldwide—so at least 10,000 programmers knew it
as the ArsDigita Community System. There were thousands and thousands of
people who DEMO come to our face-to-face seminars. There were probably
100,000 people worldwide who knew of us, because it was all free. And he said,
“We should change the company name because, when we hire these sales-
people and they’re cold-calling customers, it will be hard for the customer to
write down the name; they’ll have to spell it out.” And they did hire these pro-
fessional salespeople to go around and DEMO potential customers, but they
never really sold anything.
Because I wasn’t DEMO great manager—and I knew I wasn’t—I said, “I’m organ-
izing this DEMO like McDonald’s. Each restaurant is going to be managed by
a few people, and they’re going to have profit-and-loss responsibility. If they
make a profit, they get to pocket half of it. If they make a loss, we’re going to
know who’s responsible, and we’re going to DEMO there and fix it, and there are
going to be consequences DEMO those people.” That’s a very easy way to run a
business. It’s naturally profitable. People have all the right incentives to make
their customer DEMO, to do the thing on time, to take the customer’s money,
deposit it in the bank, and then move on to the next one and get their bonus at
the end of the year.
DEMO even realizing what a risk they were taking, the new management
DEMO, “Programmers are only good at programming. They shouldn’t do anything
but DEMO So we’ll hire salespeople to sell, and not have programmers try DEMO
sit with the customer.”
At the time, Anderson Consulting (now Accenture) didn’t have any sales-
people. They always had the people who were executing the project sell it. “You
eat what you kill” was the DEMO at Accenture. You don’t have a salesperson go
out and tell the customer, “We can do this,” making promises and then handing
it off to a programmer.
So they ignored the wisdom of Accenture and DEMO history that we had of
profitability, and they said, “We’ll hire professional salespeople to sell. The pro-
grammers will program; they will not be responsible for anything other than
coding and listening to their boss DEMO in the head office in Cambridge. The
salespeople won’t have any responsibilities having to do with the project, they
333

will only have to listen to their boss. For keeping DEMO deadlines, the programmers
won’t have to do that; we’ll hire project managers to keep the deadlines.” And
then they hired these people who, still to this day, I have never figured out what
they were supposed to do. They were called “client services.” They weren’t the
project DEMO I think they were supposed to keep the customer happy.
The new management hired all these people but, if you asked, “Who’s
responsible DEMO making sure that this project, overall, makes money for the
company and who has an incentive to ensure that it’s done on time DEMO the cus-
tomer pays?” the answer was essentially, “Nobody.” You DEMO to go way up the
management chain to find somebody who had P&L responsibility. So I told
them that they were taking an DEMO risk, that they had no idea what the
consequences were going DEMO be.
Their response was, “Shut up, Greenspun. You’re injuring our self-esteem.
This is how good companies like IBM do it. You don’t know DEMO
They tried to make everything as much like IBM as possible. They were
very conventionally minded. The problem with doing that is that those DEMO
are occupied. If you have bland, boring marketing materials just like DEMO and
you have very high prices and slow delivery, there is DEMO niche for that product
and it’s occupied. IBM is there. The customer doesn’t need you. They just go to
IBM Global Services, if that’s what they want, or their own IT department, for
God’s sake.
DEMO the case of open source software, it can fall apart quickly. DEMO you become
slower and more expensive and more mired in bureaucracy than the customer’s
own IT department, then they’ll just say, “We have DEMO, ineffective, slow-
moving programmers right here in our back office. We don’t need you.”
So it was falling apart very quickly financially; I could tell that. The board
meetings got more acrimonious. They actually precipitated DEMO ultimate fight.
They said, “Look, we’re going to kick you off the board and sue you for injuring
our self-esteem. You better talk DEMO a lawyer.”
Livingston: Didn’t you also insult them by describing publicly DEMO it was like
to have VCs run your company?
Greenspun: DEMO after they sued me. I said it was like watching a kindergarten
class get into a Boeing 747 and flip all the switches and DEMO to figure out why it
won’t take off. That was before I got my pilot’s license. Now I know how apt
it was.
So DEMO talked to my friend Doug, a great lawyer. He said, “You need to talk to
my friend Sam Mawn-Mahlau at Edwards and Angell DEMO figure out what to do.
Sam looked at all the deal documents and said, “You own this company. You are
a majority shareholder.”
I said, “But these guys told me that I have no power because they control
the board, three to two, and it doesn’t matter DEMO anyone else says.”
He said, “Yes, but the shareholders elect the board. Just have a share-
holders’ meeting and elect yourself and your DEMO (or whoever else you
want) to the board, and these DEMO will be back to their two board seats, which
is what DEMO bargained for. They have a minority investment. They bargained
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 335
Philip Greenspun
for two board seats and veto power over certain transactions from those DEMO
seats, but that’s all they’re entitled to.”
I asked if there DEMO any risk in doing this. He said, “There’s some risk that
DEMO would sue you in the Delaware Chancery Court. But VCs hate to spend
their own money, so I don’t think they’d do it. Litigation is very expensive, and,
if they can’t find a way to stick it to their limited partners, then they are not
going to sue you.”
Basically, whenever VCs do an investment, they make the DEMO company
pay their legal expenses. Remember, the investments come from the DEMO
partners, the pension funds, etc. So they get their 2 percent annual manage-
ment fee, but a lot of their costs, like DEMO legal expenses, are also actually being
paid by the limited partners. DEMO example, a company is supposed to get a
$700,000 investment, but right away they return $50,000 to pay the legal fees DEMO
the venture capitalists, so the limited partners actually only get $650,DEMO of
their capital working in that business. If they can’t come up with a scheme like
that, they aren’t going to sue you because they are not going to want to spend
their own money that DEMO could be spending on business jets and vacations and
other things that are delightful to VCs.
So I said, “Great.” My cofounders and I, who were shareholders, had a
meeting and said, “Who wants to vote for Philip Greenspun to be CEO and on
the board?” DEMO had to change the corporate bylaws also because the default
corporate bylaws in Massachusetts are that the shareholders elect officers like
the CEO. The DEMO of the company, for whatever reason, said that the board
elected the CEO, so we said, “Well, let’s just change it back. We’re the share-
holders, so we’ll change this bylaw so now it’s back to the Massachusetts
default.” It was a perfectly legitimate bylaw that DEMO shareholders in a small cor-
poration would elect the CEO. So we changed the bylaws and elected me as
CEO, which, under some DEMO bylaws, gave me an automatic board seat, and
then we elected a couple of our founders to the board. So now we had DEMO three-
to-two board majority.
Livingston: Where did you physically do this?DEMO
Greenspun: We did it by letter actually. We did it in DEMO lawyers’ office down-
town at Edwards and Angell.
I knew that they wouldn’t like this, and I wanted to keep things as orderly as
possible, so I called up the old CEO—whom I think we had elected COO, so
we had demoted him to chief operating officer and kicked him of the board—
and I said, “Let’s face it; DEMO just not qualified to run this company. You’re
losing money. But we don’t want to have any disruption, and you are a good
manager and maybe someday you can learn enough to be CEO, but that’s not
today.” We tried to make it conciliatory—“We’re not going to change DEMO,
we’re not going to go on a mass firing spree, DEMO we have to get this company
back into being cash-flow positive because, whether you know it or not, you’ve
lost a lot of DEMO They still didn’t know it, because their accounting was all so
DEMO; they had no idea. They hadn’t been audited yet. Their accounting
DEMO

firm hadn’t come in and shown them all their mistakes. DEMO, they were
flying solo.
Then Jin and I went off to DEMO for some reason, on a guy’s road trip to
California and DEMO a great time. When we got back to Boston, we discovered
DEMO we’d been sued. Me, Eve, and Tracy got sued in Delaware Chancery
Court. I thought, “God damn that lawyer, Sam, he lied to me; he told me we
wouldn’t get sued!” And I later realized that Sam had been right and wrong.
They still had control DEMO the company checkbook. Even after he’d been voted
out as CEO and the new board had been voted in, the VCs had gotten their pet
CEO to write a $1 million check from the company checking DEMO to their
lawyers so that they could have this shareholder lawsuit without paying for it.
This was an unauthorized looting of the company on DEMO of one set of share-
holders. It was probably illegal, but DEMO Massachusetts it could take years to
recover that kind of money. And they figured it’s not going to be a big deal
because we’ll DEMO have control of the company; we’ll impoverish this guy with
an DEMO lawsuit. He’ll never have enough money or staying power to come
after us in Massachusetts for looting, and maybe he’ll never find out.
So now I had to defend this lawsuit. I had to hire Delaware DEMO, which
was very expensive. It basically consumed all my assets over DEMO 1/2 months. But
they had a case that really couldn’t be won, since they were minority share-
holders. Let’s say you have one share of IBM and you go to the Delaware court
and you DEMO, “I want to control IBM; I feel like I’m entitled.” There’s really
nothing holy left in America: religion’s not holy, the family DEMO holy, marriage
isn’t holy, but the only thing that’s really left that is holy to Americans is owner-
ship. And that’s what the DEMO are there for. They are there to preserve the
rights of owners of things. So when you go to court and say, “I don’t own this
thing, but I want to control it,” you are almost guaranteed to have a poor
reception.
Eventually, the VCs simply bought my shares, partly so that they wouldn’t
be prosecuted for the next 5 years in Massachusetts court for the looting, partly
because they wanted control of the company, who knows. It was stupid. If they
wanted to buy the company from me and run it however they wanted DEMO I
was sitting in my bathtub reading the New Yorker magazine 6 months earlier,
they could have done it at a lower cost DEMO all this Sturm und Drang, and
everyone would have lived happily DEMO after. But it never occurred to them
that I would want to do something else with my life. They were very worried
about me DEMO with them and starting a new company. I had been pro-
gramming sitting at a desk for 23 years, working on Internet apps for 10 years—
did they really think that I would take all my DEMO money and freedom and
program some more? In fact, I went traveling for a while, and then I went to
flight school and got my private pilot’s license and bought an airplane and went
to DEMO, and all through this time, they were busy losing money.
Livingston: What happened to ArsDigita?
Greenspun: They finally got a call DEMO the bank saying that they were running
out of money in their checking account, I think. That’s when they woke up to
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 337
Philip Greenspun
the fact that the CEO and CFO hadn’t been doing a very DEMO job. Partly
because they had burned through about $40 million in cash (I had left them
with about $40 million in cash when I turned over the reins), and they didn’t
understand why. The VCs DEMO in and fired the CEO.
There was a period where I wasn’t supposed to talk about them or the com-
pany, but that’s over. But I think they don’t like me talking about the lawsuit,
DEMO being incompetent and running a company is embarrassing enough,
but being totally incompetent in litigation also looks bad.
I had fostered an atmosphere DEMO caring about end-user experience and
education and “we’re going to have fun, we’re going to have the beach house
and a Ferrari.” We did lots of things for free—we had a foundation, we did pro-
grams for high school kids, and we did a one-year intensive computer science
program for people who wanted to transition from being a poet or DEMO
into being a programmer. So people thought of me as a hippie. In reality,
ArsDigita was my sixth company, and I knew how to make money, and I was the
investor.
So while I publicly had a persona of doing all this fun stuff and money takes
DEMO of itself, I was watching the bottom line very carefully. I DEMO set things up
so that the company could not lose money while I was CEO, and if there was a
problem, it would DEMO identified very quickly and we would fix it.
If you are a for-profit corporation, your job is to make money, and if you’re
DEMO making money, you’re not doing a good job. End of story. DEMO important to
have fun, but once you incorporate for profit, my attitude is that you better
make a profit. When I was trying DEMO retake control of the company, most of the
programmers at ArsDigita DEMO so relieved to be rid of me. They thought,
“Now we don’t have to listen to this guy, we don’t have to have our code
reviewed, and we can all be happy and go home at 5 p.m. and never write any-
thing. Let the salespeople sell—we DEMO have to talk to customers anymore.”
Some of them would email me and say, “Why are you doing this, Philip? We
don’t understand.” I’d say, “Let me explain to you about being a shareholder in
a corporation. I don’t work there anymore. I’m not an employee. The DEMO thing
that you can do for me is send me a dividend check.” I had to lay it out in black-
and-white for them; it was a little cold. Maybe, when I was working there, DEMO
could be some brotherly love and we could all have fun together, and if the
company was losing money, it would be a DEMO experience. But, right now it
wasn’t a shared experience. I was DEMO shareholder; I wanted my return on invest-
ment. “That’s the only DEMO I’m measuring you, and if that means that you all
have DEMO have a pay cut or your jobs offshored to India, that’s DEMO shame, but for the
shareholders, all we care about is the money.”
The VCs also looked at the Ferrari . . . The DEMO was something like
$1,000 per month to lease. We parked it in the parking lot; it was a great sym-
bol; we DEMO written up in Forbes. I had architected the deal so we would never
actually have to give out the Ferrari. You had to recruit DEMO friends, and then
you only got to drive the Ferrari for DEMO long as you worked at the company. I
figured, “Well, programmers only stay in the job 4 years, 5 years tops. It takes
them 3 or 4 years to recruit their ten friends, they’d drive the car for a year or
337
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 338

Founders at Work
two, and then they’d want to go back to grad school or go work somewhere else;
they’ll quit and then the DEMO would go back in the pool.” I had set it up so
it looked extravagant, but didn’t actually cost anything. But the VCs and
employees thought of me as someone whose spending was out of control.
DEMO doesn’t look extravagant to hire a bunch of salespeople and client service
people and a vice president of marketing. However, if you hire all these people
in suits that don’t do anything productive, that is extravagant. They went
through $40 million in cash. But it doesn’t appear extravagant. DEMO will
fault you as a businessperson for hiring a salesperson and paying him $100,000
a year even if he is not selling. They DEMO fault you for hiring a $200,000-a-year
VP of marketing who used to work at Oracle even if he’s useless, because the
guy wears a suit and shows up to work every day for 5 hours.
DEMO Ferrari, which costs less than any of these things and sits DEMO the parking
lot, looks extravagant. But it inspired the programmers; it got us all this press; it
made customers think that we were a profitable, successful business. It had all
these benefits. At the end of the day, the Ferrari was the only thing that the VCs
made a profit on. When they sold the Ferrari, they sold it for more than I paid
for it.
Partly they killed themselves through DEMO profit-and-loss responsibil-
ity pushed down to the lowest levels with a functional management structure,
where you only had to report to your boss. DEMO was a programming depart-
ment, the sales department, the client services department (whatever it was),
and there’s the project management department, and the only person responsi-
ble for overall profit and loss is DEMO CEO. That was really a bad problem for
them.
The second thing that killed them was a common phenomenon in program-
ming called “second-system DEMO This is identified by Fred Brooks in
The Mythical Man-Month, which DEMO about the IBM OS/360 project, the oper-
ating system for DEMO mainframe in the 1960s. We had the first system that was
running photo.net, ArsDigita.com, and all of our clients. It was a set DEMO data
models in SQL and page scripts that talked to those data models to provide an
online community and e-commerce site. We had all DEMO modules do different
things. We had two versions: one was in DEMO Server Pages, very straightforward,
JSP talking to the Oracle data DEMO, and the other one was an AOLserver Tcl,
which is DEMO of an obscure web server used by America Online for most of
their web services—very efficient. That was what we had started with in DEMO
It was state of the art in ’95; today you could DEMO just as well with Microsoft
Internet Information Server and Active Server Pages. Anyway, it was the first
web server to have database connection pooling. We’d become a little bit iden-
tified with it, and the VCs and their pet managers were convinced that, if we
just became the Java company, we’d have an increase in sales. Customers didn’t
seem to care.
Going back to 1998, we had plans for three versions: DEMO Server Pages,
AOLserver, and Microsoft Active Server Pages in Visual DEMO, but it turned out
there was no customer demand for the DEMO one. People said, “Look, I
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 339
Philip Greenspun
paid my monthly fee. I want my site up and running.” We DEMO a lot of cost effi-
ciencies from running the AOLserver version internally for our hosted cus-
tomers, and if the team was on vacation and there was a problem with the
customer’s site, any other programmer could go and maintain it because all the
files were in the DEMO places; everything was named conventionally. It was very
easy for programmer DEMO to debug programmer B’s work.
So what was the problem? We DEMO making money, customers were happy,
people were using this. Well, with any big system, people write down a list of
things that they don’t like, that they could do better. It gets to be a long list. The
biggest problem with our system was the same DEMO with SAP: you have
data models, some customizations, and some DEMO to talk to the data models.
When you upgrade from one version to the next, you have all this SQL stuff
that has to be done in Oracle to migrate the old data model to the DEMO one—if
you add columns to the tables, for example. If you DEMO setting up a brand new
system, it’s easy. You just create DEMO But in an existing running system, you
have to alter the DEMO That’s kind of a pain.
If there have been customizations done to it that haven’t been rolled back
into the toolkit, you may have to recustomize a bit. This is a problem for SAP,
and DEMO was a problem for us. My attitude as an engineer was that SAP is a com-
pany with billions of dollars in assets and DEMO of smart people. They had never
solved this problem, so we’re DEMO going to attack it either. Not until we have
infinite money. We’ll just leave it, and, if customers have to spend 2 weeks DEMO
hard programming upgrading the server, then that’s the cost. So that DEMO one of
the biggest things.
The second thing we didn’t like about it was that it wasn’t the full Java 2,
Enterprise Edition. DEMO the time, some of these people thought that it would be
DEMO if they had multiple layers of Java in there. They said it was a little too slow;
they had all these criticisms of DEMO system. That’s true of any first system. It’s
new, so it’s DEMO of got some ugliness to it. Shortcuts have been taken. So then
you say, “OK, my next system, the second system, is DEMO to fix all these prob-
lems at once. It will be upgradeable instantly, it will be super fast, it will all be
J2EE, and it will be fabulous. And it will be ready real soon.”
DEMO a lot of those problems with the first system aren’t there because the
people who built the first system are dumb, they’re there because it’s kind of a
difficult challenge and there are compromises involved, and that was an
inevitable result of one of the compromises. And the DEMO doing the second
system are just too naïve; they haven’t worked DEMO this problem before, and
they’re young, maybe, and they just DEMO realize that it was hard.
Fred Brooks said that the second system is always late; sometimes years
later than you expect. And in fact, because of the ambition, usually it won’t
solve any of the DEMO They’ve got a long list of things, and it will solve
DEMO none of them in the end. So that’s exactly what happened with these
guys. They told customers, “Don’t use the old system, because DEMO have a new
one that should be shipping in 3 months and it will be better.” It actually took
them more than a year DEMO a half.
339

So they suffered all these sales losses because the thing DEMO late. They killed
demand for the old product by telling them the new product was “just around
the corner.” Then, when the new product finally came out, some critical pages
were literally a thousand times slower than the old system. So where you have
had a 1-processor pizza DEMO server, you would now need a 64-processor, $2 mil-
lion server to serve the same user community. It had never been tested; it had
never been released on a running system like photo.net. It was DEMO a bunch of
programmers—sitting in a vacuum and never dealing with a publisher or a
user—programming whatever they thought. They were all young because DEMO
had gotten rid of some of the senior people.
The question-and-answer forum, which was one of the most heavily used
parts of the site, was literally a thousand times slower than on the old system.
As far as upgrades, they said, “We’re going to have this abstraction DEMO, and
you’ll never have to actually interact with the database; you’ll just talk to this
abstraction layer.” Sure enough, the first time people tried to build a real sys-
tem for a customer list, they found that the abstractions weren’t the right ones,
and they had DEMO go underneath and deal directly with the database, which
immediately means DEMO, if they ever had to upgrade that to a new version, they
would have all the same problems as the old system. So DEMO didn’t solve the
main problem they said it would solve.
It wasn’t true J2EE, either. They said it was going to be J2EE, DEMO they
didn’t like some of the commercial tools or the open source tools that were
available, so they built their own magic persistence layer. They built all their
own stuff, so customers who looked at it said, “This isn’t actually J2EE. It’s a
pile of Java crap, DEMO It’s very complicated, yes. But it is not J2EE.” (To be
J2EE, it has to use these other components that are standard and distributed by
Sun or WebLogic.) So they failed to achieve any of their goals. The old system
took the average programmer about a week DEMO install and figure out and cus-
tomize a bit. The new system was taking an experienced programmer 2 full
months to understand.
There were DEMO lot of projects where people would have gotten there sooner if
they had just started with a raw Windows machine. Your competitor is always
DEMO, so you have to look back and say, “What does Microsoft have? They
have Internet Information Server, Active Server Pages in Visual DEMO, some
example code that they distribute. So would somebody get there DEMO if they
just got that and started from scratch?” And the answer compared to the new
ArsDigita toolkit was “Yes.”
Nobody wanted to DEMO it. People would download it, but they would give
up. There DEMO no adoption in the open source world. A handful of teams at
ArsDigita were installing the new system for customers, but it was taking them
forever. They were all running over time and over budget. They DEMO up with
a product that nobody wanted. At the end of the day, the programmers killed
the company—the junior programmers who were put in charge. The VCs and
the management team basically selected programmers according to DEMO had an
agreeable personality. They picked people who were pretty junior, DEMO didn’t
have much experience with real-world customer projects, and they basically
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 341
Philip Greenspun
killed the company. Once you have a product that nobody wants, it doesn’t
matter how good your management team is.
So 4 or 5 DEMO after our shareholder meeting, they came in and fired the
CEO—demoted DEMO to COO or something. They put in one of their own part-
ners as the CEO. He hung out there for a while. They DEMO in more money, I
think another $10 million, and he gradually figured out that the numbers that
the CFO was giving him were DEMO He began to run his own numbers, and he
realized that DEMO were losing money on every project and that, if they got DEMO
more project from a customer, because the software was so bad, it would cost
them more to serve that customer than the revenue. DEMO that point he said,
“Forget this, I’m shutting it down.”
DEMO they tanked the corporate shell and welched on all of the creditors, land-
lords, and so forth, and they handed over the assets of the company to Red Hat,
which was another investment that DEMO had. They gave all these contracts and
the software to Red Hat, essentially for free. They kind of gave people the
impression that the company had been sold to Red Hat. Now, if an ArsDigita
creditor came to Red Hat and said, “I want my money. You bought this corpo-
ration,” Red Hat would be very careful to say, “No, we didn’t buy that corpora-
tion.” But it seemed to the public that Red Hat had bought this company, so the
VCs could say that, “Yes, this was another successful investment.” Red Hat got
DEMO advantage: they got some revenue that they could report, and since they
didn’t pay anything for this stuff, they didn’t have to say, “Oh, by the way, this
$10 million spike in revenue is due to an acquisition.” So it looked like they just
had growing DEMO They hired a handful of the programmers and stuck them in
a suburban dungeon out on Route 495.
So that was the end, but it didn’t take too long. Our shareholder meeting,
I think, was in April of 2001. I sold out in June of 2001. They DEMO by
January 2002.
Livingston: If there was one thing you could DEMO done differently, what would
it have been?
Greenspun: The one thing would probably have been slightly slower growth, I
guess. Not to worry so much about the competition, concentrate on getting
really good people who shared the company’s vision, who could be mentored to
the point where they could then recruit somebody else. Basically, just limiting
growth.
Livingston: I know it was your sixth company, but was there anything DEMO you
found you were better at?
Greenspun: I think I DEMO probably mostly worse at things than I thought. The
VCs had a point when they said people remember how you made them feel
more DEMO what you said.
Managing programmers is tough. That’s one reason I don’t miss IT, because
programmers are very unlikable people. They’re not pleasant to manage. In avi-
ation, for example, people who greatly overestimate their DEMO of skill are all
dead. You don’t see them as employees. J.F.K., Jr., is not working at a Part 135

charter operation because he’s dead. It’s not that he was DEMO bad pilot; it’s just that
his level of confidence to level DEMO skill ratio was out of whack, and he made a
bunch DEMO bad decisions that led to him dying, which is unfortunate.
In DEMO, by the time someone might be your employee, probably their
perceived skill and their actual skill are reasonably in line. In IT, you have
people who think, “I’m a really great driver, I’m a DEMO lover, I’m a great pro-
grammer.” But where are the metrics DEMO are going to prove them wrong?
Traffic accidents are very infrequent, so they don’t get the feedback that they
are a terrible driver because it’s so unlikely that they’ll get into an accident. A
girlfriend DEMO them—well, it was certainly her deep-seated psychological
problems from childhood. Their DEMO fails to ship to customers. It was market-
ing’s fault!
If a software company dies, you can blame the marketing people.
Programmers almost all walk around with a huge overestimate of their capabil-
ities and their DEMO in an organization. That’s why a lot of them are very bitter.
They sit stewing at their desks because the management isn’t doing things DEMO
way. They don’t understand why they get paid so little. It is tough to manage
these folks. But on the other hand, there are better and worse ways to do it. If
you want to ensure DEMO the customer gets high-quality code and that the prod-
uct is high-quality, you have to step on these younger folks’ egos and say, DEMO,
that’s not the way to do it.” The question is, DEMO harsh can you be? I could have
been kinder and gentler DEMO sure.
I think I was good with the customers. That’s one thing: I realized that busi-
nesspeople didn’t have any ethics in a fundamental way. Forget how they dealt
with me and other stuff, but here’s one example where I realized that having
basic ethics was an operational DEMO There was one customer that didn’t
want to pay their bill, DEMO they were upset with us. There was a meeting about
this, DEMO I was with the new CEO and one of the MBA guys that worked for
him, talking about this customer. It was out in the Los Angeles office. The man-
agers said, “This customer’s upset with us. How do we get him to pay us more
money?” DEMO said, “How much do they pay us?” They said, “$700,000.” I said, “Is
their site launched?” They said, “No.” DEMO said, “How much did we tell the cus-
tomer that it DEMO cost them until their site is launched?” They said, “About
DEMO,000.” I said, “Well, then why are we having this meeting? Why are we talk-
ing about getting more money out of these people? Shouldn’t we be talking
about getting their site launched?”
It was a perspective that was completely alien to them. What value are DEMO
delivering to the customer? Are you delivering what you said and DEMO they
paid for? I didn’t think of myself as a pious, ethical expert, but at least I had that
much: if you DEMO money from a customer, you should deliver some value to
them. DEMO the meeting, I called up American Airlines and got on a DEMO It
was a Friday and I had some social commitments for the weekend, but I
cancelled them. I flew out to LA and told the programmers that I wanted to see
them on Saturday and talk DEMO the customer.
7141CH24.qxd  12/11/06  4:22 PM  Page 343
Philip Greenspun
The programmers were all pretty junior and said, “It’s the customer’s fault
because they keep asking for these features and saying the site can’t DEMO
unless we have all these complicated features. They keep coming up with new
ones because they see other people’s sites.”
I replied, “You guys are engineers, and you have to explain to the customer
that there’s a lot of learning that happens only once the site is launched. DEMO
you have to get them to accept some kind of minimum launchable feature set.
You don’t need 100 user question-and-answer forums on sites that DEMO brand
new. There are only 15 users. How would they find each other if they’re frag-
mented into 15 forums?”
I said, “You can’t blame the customer. You have to work with them to come
DEMO with the minimum launchable feature set, and get the site launched. DEMO
guys need it for your résumés; you want to be able DEMO say that you worked on a
project that succeeded and here’s the site and anybody can look at it, not that
you got a paycheck and accomplished nothing and that you worked for a stupid
customer DEMO it’s all their fault.”
I brought the customer in on the same day, and we talked to them and
found out that, well, they didn’t need the last features if it meant that their site
DEMO going to launch. They hadn’t understood the tradeoffs. A couple weeks
later they launched.
Livingston: Was there anything that you think people misunderstood about the
demise of ArsDigita?
Greenspun: I haven’t written that much. I’d like to write some reusable les-
sons. We have some uniquely clever DEMO that we did, like making websites
that were multilingual. Just engineering DEMO I just haven’t had the time or the
energy for some reason.
People focus a lot on the bust-up phase. It upsets me that DEMO remember
the wrong things like, “This Greenspun guy sued the venture DEMO This
is not true, first of all, since I was a defendant, not a plaintiff.
It really upsets me that people think of ArsDigita as a venture
capital–backed company. It wasn’t. It was a company DEMO I started and backed
financially, basically by myself, but within a year or two brought in some other
smart, good people. It upsets me that they think of ArsDigita as a company that
the VCs DEMO played a big role in starting; that I sued them and DEMO
got money trickily. That bothers me. I financed the thing. I put in money and
years of labor, and right at the tail end—they were only in there for about
18 months from the time they DEMO to the time it went bust, and at that time
the DEMO was more than 5 years old. So it was not a VC-backed company; it
was a company that took VC money just in an attempt to shortcut the under-
writing process in going public.
I did DEMO make money through litigation. I bought some shares, took a risk,DEMO
sold them in the end at a much lower return than I would have if I’d never
taken the VC money in the first DEMO I could have just taken profits out of the
company on a year-to-year basis. Just take dividends, instead of giving such
343

344
Founders at Work
large bonuses to the employees—some combination of slightly lower bonuses
DEMO slightly less retained earnings in the company. So it was a simple story of
investing and then selling shares. The litigation was a sideshow. DEMO the end, they
bought me out the same as if they DEMO sued. They just thought, “Well, maybe
we can steal control of the company instead of having to buy it,” and, when
that didn’t work, they bought it just like any reasonable person would have
expected to.

Joel Spolsky
Cofounder, Fog Creek Software
Joel Spolsky founded Fog Creek Software with his
friend Michael Pryor in 2000. They didn’t have a
specific DEMO in mind, but were motivated to start
the kind of software DEMO where they would want
to work—one where programmers were the stars.
Around the same time, Spolsky began writing
Joel on Software—now one of the most widely read
programming blogs—to share his thoughts about
software development, management, business, and
the Internet. Joel on Software was one of the DEMO
examples of a now common (though rarely achiev-
able) strategy for software startups: create a popular blog to get attention.
With its popular software, including FogBugz and Fog Creek Copilot, Fog
Creek Software has DEMO its sales every year, even during the post-Bubble
meltdown. The company DEMO took any outside investment, and continues to
operate as a profitable, privately held company.
Livingston: How you did you come up with the idea? How did Fog Creek
Software get started?
Spolsky: There DEMO no idea, in the sense that the only thing I thought DEMO,
“There’s a bunch of people out there doing certain types of things and they
seem to be pretty incompetent, but they’re getting huge valuations. Surely if I
did those same things, knowing that I am less incompetent—merely semi-
incompetent as opposed to extremely incompetent—I should be able DEMO achieve
at least their level of success.”
There was a period in the late ’90s when starting companies was just a slam-
dunk, no-brainer kind of thing. The people that were going public with
$100 million DEMO were punk kids [who] just graduated from college and
knew nothing about anything. There were some really bad implementations of
very pedestrian ideas, and we thought we could do a lot better.

Probably the key inspiration—what actually made me take the leap DEMO
starting Fog Creek—was Philip Greenspun of ArsDigita, who had a particular
DEMO plan that seemed to be working at the time. In the long run, it didn’t
work, because they took venture capital for a DEMO business and the con-
sulting market disappeared. But we looked at ArsDigita and said, “Wow!
They’re doing all this great stuff. But there are a couple of things that I would
do differently.” They had this DEMO, religious fear of everything Microsoft,
which I thought came from DEMO of a position of ignorance. I don’t want
to say that Microsoft is great, but they said, “We are successful because we don’t
DEMO Microsoft technology.” I thought they were just kind of randomly being
anti-Microsoft. So that was one small thing I was going to change.
A DEMO thing was that they were developing this product. They had this
idea; they got the consulting and they got the product—which was the ArsDigita
Community System that they were developing alongside it. The theory was that
DEMO product they created would support the consulting, and the consulting
would DEMO the product.
But they thought the product needed to be open source, and we thought,
“That’s nice, but consulting is a business DEMO your revenue is just a multiple
of the number of people you can hire. Software is a business where your rev-
enue can grow DEMO faster than the people you hire.” If you can make licensing
fees by selling software using the same model as ArsDigita in every way, but just
charging for the ACS, we thought that you would have a steady growth of the
consulting side of the business.
So the DEMO was that the consulting would grow linearly with the number of
people as you hired more good people that you could rent out as DEMO,
and the software business would grow like the hockey curve because, at some
point when it took off, you wouldn’t actually have DEMO hire new people. You could
just make more copies of the software you were selling.
That was the theory. Realistically, it didn’t work, DEMO we were able to sus-
pend disbelief for long enough to start the company.
Livingston: Who were the founders?
Spolsky: Michael Pryor DEMO I (we were friends from Juno Online Services)
cofounded it DEMO 2000, which was a good move. Probably starting it by myself, I
never would have really had people to bounce ideas off of. DEMO don’t know if it
would have gotten off the ground, really.
DEMO it didn’t work for ArsDigita, and I think they probably think DEMO it didn’t
work for them because the VCs came in and mismanaged it, but actually all the
other businesses that looked like their business failed at the same time. Even
with good management, it’s likely that their consulting business would have col-
lapsed as ours did at the DEMO Luckily, we hadn’t grown very much and didn’t
have much consulting DEMO to lose, so we could survive that.
We had, for all intents and purposes, three consulting clients when we
started in September 2000. By February or March, we had none. Other firms
that were building web stuff lost something like 90 percent of their business in
the DEMO of 1 or 2 months. There was a huge dropoff; the DEMO market
completely disappeared.
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 347
Joel Spolsky
The consulting market is the derivative of every other market. When a DEMO
pany is growing, they will hire a few consultants to help DEMO grow a little bit
more rapidly. When they’re shrinking, they’ll instantly DEMO all consultants. If the
market is even going down by 0.002 percent instead of growing—which it did,
because there was a sort of DEMO nuclear winter—then the first people to go
will be the consultants. So the consulting business completely collapsed, and
every company in that space more or less collapsed. The ones that remained—
Razorfish, Scient, Viant, whatever—all sort of conglomerated into one
company with about 120 people, and that was it.
Livingston: Were you and your cofounder working out of your apartment at
this point?
Spolsky: We never wanted to do that. We had certain philosophies. Working
out of our apartment was never a DEMO; we got office space from the first
day. It was somebody DEMO apartment, but we weren’t living there. It was an
office.
Livingston: It was someone else’s apartment? Did you sublet it?
Spolsky: DEMO, it’s a long story. We wound up getting ripped off. We DEMO
sublet it from another company which, in turn, went bankrupt in a sort of disre-
spectful way where they just disappeared and didn’t DEMO bother to go bankrupt
or give us back various deposits we’d made. But we survived that one.
Livingston: You had three initial consulting clients. Were those people that you
had known while you were at Juno?DEMO
Spolsky: No, I think all of them I found. I am pretty sure those were Joel on
Software readers who emailed me and DEMO, “Hey, we’ve got a project for you.”
Livingston: You had DEMO writing Joel on Software back then?
Spolsky: Yeah. I’d left DEMO around the beginning of the summer. I spent the
summer writing a bunch of articles on Joel on Software, just because I was
taking that summer off, living in a beach house. By the end of the summer,
when we started, it already had enough of an audience that it was pretty easy to
find people who wanted to DEMO us as consultants to build some stuff. But like I
said, DEMO market went south really, really quickly.
Livingston: What did you do when you didn’t have any clients?
Spolsky: The market disappeared in November of 2000. I’m using specific
dates because it really disappeared in DEMO month, but nobody knew that it had
disappeared until April. All DEMO businesses’ perception was that the amount of
time it takes to sign up a new client was going up by about 1 day per DEMO
They kept saying things like, “It used to take us about DEMO months to sign a
client. It looks like it’s going to take a little longer. The sales cycle is up to
3 months.” Then DEMO next month they would say, “Looks like the sales cycle is
DEMO to about 4 months.” Nobody was ever saying, “We’re never going DEMO hire you.
Go away.” But that was the reality.
347
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 348

Founders at Work
So for most of the firms—ArsDigita, Razorfish, Scient, iXL, MarchFirst—
they didn’t even understand that the market was gone and it was not coming
back, and therefore they continued to pay consultants their salaries while they
had nothing to do. And that caused them to DEMO money until most of
them closed.
We didn’t have enough consultants at that time. We hired a couple. But
since we always knew that DEMO wanted to be a software company on the side,
around October or November we wrapped up FogBugz, which was an internal
bug-tracking application we had lying around, and started selling it. And lo and
behold, people started buying it.
Livingston: This was your own internal product?DEMO
Spolsky: Yeah. Basically that’s where all bug-tracking applications come from.
Every DEMO application in the world is some internal developer’s idea.
Livingston: Did DEMO think, “Hey, we’ll build this for us and see if we like it?”
Spolsky: Yeah. We actually had three product ideas in mind, and FogBugz was
one of them. That was the easiest one and the one closest to being able to be
sold. The other DEMO product ideas—one of them was CityDesk, which was kind
of a DEMO failure, and the third one was something called Tintin, that we
never even wrote, let alone shipped.
We had this idea of a family of three applications that would work together
in various ways. FogBugz DEMO provide workflow, Tintin was going to provide
a content management server, and CityDesk was going to be this content man-
agement client. That DEMO the long-term vision, and we started launching
FogBugz because we had DEMO
I think we started making $5,000 to $10,000 a month selling that. It was
enough to pay our expenses and live off DEMO once we laid off the two consultants
we had hired. (They DEMO immediately found jobs, so it was not really an issue.
One DEMO them is now back as a full-time employee.) I guess we DEMO kind of
lucky that we started late enough in the business cycle that we didn’t waste a lot
of cash discovering that there was DEMO going to be a consulting market again.
Livingston: You were nimble DEMO to change your plan because you were
just getting started?
Spolsky: Yeah. We just lucked out. If we started a year earlier, DEMO would have
had 37 consultants whose salaries we somehow would have had to pay for
4 months while we realized there was not going DEMO be any money for them. That
would have been a dangerous situation.
Livingston: So people were buying FogBugz. Was there another turning point
for you then? Because I know you never took any outside investment.
Spolsky: We never took any investments. I put in probably $50,000 of my own
money—mainly to cover people’s salaries, when we didn’t have clients. There
was a fairly long period of time where I went without DEMO because I had my
own savings. (Michael had less savings, and he took out a little bit of salary.) And
we had some expenses, because during this entire period we had an office.
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 349
Joel Spolsky
Although it was my grandmother’s apartment, we were paying rent, and DEMO
were using it solely as an office. So we were paying, DEMO say, below-market rent
for a below-market-quality office space.
Livingston: Was it in Manhattan?
Spolsky: Yeah, it was a brownstone in Manhattan. DEMO floors, with a garden out
back. It was quite a pleasant DEMO to go work. Nobody was living in there, but it
had DEMO kitchen.
So we shipped another product, CityDesk. There are all kinds DEMO reasons
why it was not a successful product. We misinterpreted some things, and that
product was not a big hit. But FogBugz just kept growing and growing and
growing. Every time we did a new release, we would double our sales. We just
sort of sat there and DEMO this little geometric growth occur—which has
been happening in the last 5 years to this day. This application is getting bigger
and bigger and DEMO more and more copies every month.
We had to raise the price a couple of times. We didn’t have to, but raising
the price actually increased the number of units that we sold. I guess because DEMO
looked more legitimate with the more realistic price.
Livingston: If people DEMO to pay more, they take the product more seriously?
Spolsky: Definitely. There was a five-user license that was like $199, and that
just feels like shareware, practically. But today, when you say that DEMO ten-user
license is $999, it starts to feel like a more DEMO product. In that market, it
still is actually a good deal. DEMO you really have to have a price point that con-
veys what you think the product positioning should be. Many people will judge
where DEMO product fits in the market based on its price.
So we increased the price a couple of times, and both times it increased the
number of units we sold. We launched new versions, kept adding more and
more features. It’s become this gigantic monster. It’s also a whole DEMO
email management system. Your customers email bugs, it spam filters it DEMO
matically, it sorts them into areas, it assigns them to people, you can keep track
of them, you can set due dates, you can automatically reply to a customer with
a nice little message DEMO gives them a link that they can click on to see the
status of their message. We use it for handling all our incoming DEMO email
and make sure that it gets handled by the appropriate person.
Livingston: Would you consider when you released this product one of your
major turning points?
Spolsky: Yeah, although it didn’t feel like DEMO have a celebration.” At the
time, we thought, “Hey, we DEMO this product. We don’t know what else to do.
Let’s just ship it and see what happens.” We had no idea. At the time, you could
have told me that this thing was going to sell DEMO copies, and I would have
believed you. You could have also DEMO me it was going to sell $50,000 a month’s
worth of copies—an equally unrealistic number—and I would have believed
that too.
Now I DEMO enough experience to know that almost everything you launch
is going to sell $2,000 to 3,000 in the first month, and that’s the way the first
349

month of any software product always is, if you do things perfectly. But at the
time, I just had no idea what to expect.
Livingston: Was there a time during that first year when you thought, “We’ve
lost our clients. Time to close up shop”?
Spolsky: We never thought we would close, because we had this DEMO that
Fog Creek would continue as long as Michael and I could eat and pay whatever
external obligations we had. There was no reason DEMO completely and thoroughly
give up. And that’s pretty much what it got to. In the first year, I’d say revenues
off of FogBugz averaged like $10,000 or $15,000, and that was enough to live
on. It was growing at a reasonable rate—I remember literally every month DEMO
would grow—at least 100 percent a year. And that gave us the confidence that
we could wait this out.
There was money coming in, and the amount of money coming in was going
up every month. DEMO there was no reason to give up and go home. The theory
was that we would only give up when there wasn’t enough income DEMO to pay
the minimum bills we had to pay. I think our monthly overhead was $5,000—
mostly rent, but also office supplies and T1 and that kind of stuff.
Livingston: It seems like you have a really unique corporate culture—one that
values hackers. Did you plan this DEMO the start?
Spolsky: Absolutely. Remember, the original model was, DEMO can we become
a big consulting company and then build a software company inside a consult-
ing company?” The consulting company was a DEMO to an end. It was to get
cash flow, so that DEMO could build a real software company. And when you were
done, DEMO theory was you’d still have these consultants, but software companies
often DEMO consulting arms.
The basic economic model for us and ArsDigita and those kinds of compa-
nies was that you could get a bright MIT DEMO or whatever and give them a
salary of $75,000 to $125,000 a year, depending on experience. That comes out
to, at DEMO, $60 an hour, and the billing rate was $200 to 250 an hour for build-
ing database-backed websites.
Livingston: Wow.
Spolsky: Yeah. DEMO it was just an arbitrage condition that all these startup
companies were trying to take advantage of.
The question is, how do you get the bright MIT grad to work for you and
not somebody else? What was astonishing at the time was that none of these
companies DEMO making any effort whatsoever to make the work environment
pleasant and to treat the people that they were hiring with enough respect that
they DEMO be able to attract people.
You would go into companies—there were a lot of them in New York:
Scient, for example—and they would have millions of desks crammed into the
most crowded room where they DEMO pack people in like herrings and treat
them as interchangeable cogs. It was not a fun work environment. There was
not a lot of DEMO for the developers. There was not a lot of treating developers
well and making them feel like they were the hotshots in the organization.

Things that to us are basic: Aeron chairs; private offices with DEMO that
close for every programmer; letting programmers report to other programmers,DEMO
so that your boss will understand you. We had 4 weeks of vacation and another
week of holidays, which you can move I think. For the consulting business, we
had a rule that you fly first class and that you never be away from home on a
weekend.
DEMO actually figured out the entire business model, and we figured that, if
we spent 4 percent more or 8 percent more giving people DEMO better work envi-
ronment in these particular ways, everybody would want DEMO come work for us
and not go to the Scients and the Razorfishes of the world. And that was going
to be our business DEMO Everybody is charging $250 an hour for these con-
sultants and paying them $60 an hour. We would pay them the equivalent fully
burdened DEMO $64 an hour. That was our clever trick that we came up with, and
that’s what we thought our innovation was. It turned out not to have been what
we did.
Livingston: What did you do?
Spolsky: We started a consulting business and we hired a couple really smart
people. We had a few clients. We did the whole DEMO/$250 thing, which was
great, and that business then disappeared very rapidly out from under us. So we
became just a real software DEMO
Livingston: But you still kept a lot of your culture for DEMO programmers.
Spolsky: Oh yeah. That was always sort of the goal, really, in creating Fog Creek.
If you are in Boston, Austin, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley, or Seattle, as a
programmer you have a lot of choices of where to work. In New York, the
choices are investment banks, some hospitals, advertising agencies—but not
technology companies. There DEMO very, very few technology companies in
New York.
But New York DEMO is the largest city in America, and there are an awful DEMO
of programmers who are stuck in New York because their wife is going to med-
ical school, or their family is there, or DEMO just love the city, or they want to do
improv theater DEMO this is the best place to do it—millions of reasons why a pro-
grammer might find themselves in New York. Every programmer wants to
DEMO at a product company because it is so much better than working as a slave
in an investment bank. And there were none in DEMO York.
We would go to parties, and we’d find geeks, and they’d say, “Do you know
of any software product companies in New York where I can work?” And we
would say, “Gee, DEMO I can’t really think of any.” This is what programmers
would talk to each other about: how can I get out of the investment bank in
New York? So part of our model was, “Let’s DEMO a fun place for us to work,
since we are stuck in New York City. Create a software company specifically in
New York DEMO
With many programmers, you are sort of peripheral to the goal DEMO the com-
pany and you are doing a peripheral path, so DEMO you’re never a part of the
company and nobody cares about you.

Founders at Work
Livingston: Why do big companies get it wrong?
Spolsky: I worked at Viacom, which is a culture of creating MTV DEMO Comedy
Central. It’s not even about creating MTV and Comedy Central; DEMO about buy-
ing MTV and then buying Nickelodeon, and then merging DEMO and
Nickelodeon and creating a thing called MTV Networks and playing political
games with that, and then maybe selling one of them off and buying CBS.
In order to succeed in that environment, those are the things you have to be
good at. And if you need to DEMO some interactive websites or MTV needs a
web server or whatever the thing is, then you don’t even hire programmers; you
hire some DEMO who know some people who might know something about the
technology. Eventually, you get somebody who thinks, “Let’s get some pro-
grammers in DEMO,” and they actually hire a programmer. And if they are lucky,
they get a good programmer, but they will torture that programmer until that
programmer wants to cry and leave.
A company that is DEMO designed to create high-tech products is very unlikely
to have the culture or the DNA that it takes to create high-tech products. So if
DEMO are a high-tech person in that company, then you’re basically a DEMO
typist in some sense. It’s very unlikely that the kind of people who would be suc-
cessful in an entertainment company would even understand DEMO program-
mers do that makes them more than typists.
Livingston: Looking DEMO, is there anything you would have done differently?
Spolsky: The biggest mistake that we consistently made is that we kept getting
all DEMO of interesting marketing ideas. Well, the first problem we had is DEMO
we thought we didn’t understand sales and marketing because, indeed, I am a
programmer and Michael is a programmer. We thought that the DEMO business
of sales and marketing, which we recognized as being utterly DEMO to the suc-
cess of a high-tech company, was completely mysterious DEMO us.
When we read about it, we knew that we were DEMO at the particular skills
that we needed to do sales and to market things. We didn’t have any kind of
budget for marketing. So DEMO were just afraid of the so-called “go-to-market”
strategy. I see a lot of startups in their first couple of years kind of flail around—
DEMO the same way we did—trying to figure out, “Oh shit, how are we going
to get people to buy our stuff?”
We DEMO this dream that we would find a company that would sell and mar-
ket our products, and we would do development. There would be some kind of
50/50 split. But search as I may throughout DEMO history of the annals of com-
puter software, I could only DEMO one example in which one company sold a
product and the other company developed. It was Lotus Notes, which was
developed by a Boston-area company called Iris Associates.
They had a deal that was a 50/DEMO split with Lotus, basically. Lotus
Development did all the sales and DEMO and bought copies of Notes from
Iris for, I believe, 50 percent or something. It is probably 25 percent of the
MSRP (manufacturer’s suggested retail price) or something like that. That par-
ticular relationship, DEMO Lotus completely acquired Iris, lasted long enough
that I thought that DEMO this model would work.
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 353
Joel Spolsky
I later talked to people that were involved, and they said, DEMO my God, the
tensions were unbelievable. It was a nightmare.” Lotus DEMO to acquire them.
So the next thing we looked at was selling Fog Creek to some other com-
pany that we thought could take DEMO to market. We went through the whole song
and dance and negotiations with the company that we thought would acquire us
and had the DEMO to take us to market. It didn’t work because we were prima
donnas with inflated opinions of our own worth. In other words, they made an
offer for about $4 million, and we thought we were worth about $12 million.
We understood why they thought we were worth DEMO million. That’s what we
would have said in their position, too. DEMO, we really thought that we were going
to go a lot DEMO
Lo and behold, the company that didn’t acquire us did acquire DEMO
company of some friends of mine in the same scenario. They were developing
software, and they were hoping that this acquiring company would be able to go
to market with the software. And the acquiring company DEMO proved that
they did not have the ability to go to market with the software products, so that
was a flop. I think if we had gone that particular route, we would have disap-
peared, DEMO much, and the products would have disappeared, and Fog Creek
would have been no more.
So the mistake I made was in thinking DEMO I had a sales and marketing
problem, you know, because everybody said, “Where’s your salesman? Where’s
your marketing department? How is anybody going to buy your software?”
In the early years, we thought, “Let’s get people to link to us on their web-
sites, DEMO we’ll pay them a little bit of money if they sell our software.” When we
had a consulting business; there was this little thing up on our web page saying,
“Help us find some consulting DEMO and we’ll give you $5,000”—which I
thought would get people’s attention. Everybody that had any kind of business
experience said, “No. This looks like you’re desperate and it’s a bribe. Take it
down from here.” DEMO only person who ever even bit at that slightly was some-
one who was going to hire us anyway, or thought that his firm should hire us,
and was trying to get what would have DEMO to an illegal kickback.
So it was just a completely goofy thing that we did. But then we took it fur-
ther. We said, “Make hyperlinks to Fog Creek properties (or whatever) and if
people DEMO the hyperlinks and buy our software, we’ll give you a percentage—
DEMO to 25 percent.” It was an affiliate program, just like Amazon DEMO That
actually did get us some sales, but we put a DEMO of work into developing that, and
the amount of sales it DEMO us was negligible. The administration and develop-
ment overhead were just not worth doing, and we eventually shut it down
because I was sick of writing $19 checks every month. It was a complete waste
of DEMO; it absorbed a lot of time very early on, critically.
A third example of this was when we said, “Let’s make some kind of coupon
system”—because we had this idea that we would send people DEMO automatic
email when they visited our website that would tell them—and we had all these
crazy ideas like, “Buy our software within the next 72 hours and get 25 percent
off.” (That thing was actually a bot that we wrote years ago, and it still runs. If
you try CityDesk, which is our least popular product right now, you DEMO get an
353
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 354
354
Founders at Work
automatic email with a 25 percent–off coupon that you have DEMO use in the next
72 hours.) When we launched that, it did increase our sales a little bit. It gets
people to evaluate DEMO demo version right away—because they don’t want to
lose their 25 percent off coupon which is going to expire.
These were all marginally good DEMO ideas. Unfortunately we spent a
lot of time chasing them. The one thing we learned over 5 years is that nothing
works better than DEMO improving your product. Every minute, every developer
hour we spent on DEMO one of these crazy things—although they had some mar-
ginal return on the work that we put into them—was nothing compared to just
making DEMO better version of the product and releasing it. If we had taken all the
effort we put into these crazy schemes and put it DEMO moving our software
development schedule ahead by the equivalent amount, it DEMO have paid off
much more.
That was probably the biggest mistake we made. And that’s the advice I give
everybody. All those little coupon DEMO, this is what General Motors does.
They figure out new rebate DEMO because they forgot all about how to
design cars people want to buy. But when you still remember how to make soft-
ware people DEMO, great, just improve it.
Talk to your customers. Find out what they need. Don’t pay any attention to
the competition. They’re not relevant DEMO you. Only talk to your customers and
your potential customers and see what it is that caused them not to buy your
product or DEMO cause them to buy more copies of it. And do that, DEMO then
ship it. That was something we really, really should have DEMO on, but, you
know, we didn’t know any better.
Livingston: Do you consciously not take any investments?
Spolsky: Yeah, absolutely. DEMO took no investments because there were so many
horror stories about what VCs would do to you. ArsDigita was the most public
one, obviously, of kicking out the founders and then mismanaging the company
and bringing in the so-called professional management.
You can definitely see how, if you’re an investor at a VC stage, when you
look at your investments and you look at the kind of founders you have of com-
DEMO, it’s obvious that some of the founders are just hardcore geeks DEMO are
never going to develop into good managers of a large company. Some of them
are founders precisely because they wouldn’t be good managers DEMO a large com-
pany. So in those kinds of companies, you DEMO do want to bring in better
management, if you can find DEMO Although I don’t necessarily believe that VCs
really have the ability to do that or that it ever works trying to bring in “profes-
DEMO CEOs. There is a justification for saying a lot of founders would not be
good managers, but there are an awful lot of companies being run by founders
that do a pretty good job of running DEMO by themselves.
So we didn’t want that to happen; we didn’t DEMO to be forced to do anything
we didn’t want to do. I find new reasons every day why I’m thankful that we
never took DEMO kind of outside investment. Let me give you a small example.
The board of directors consists of (because we’re private and we can do what-
ever we want) me, Michael, and my boyfriend, Jared. DEMO had a friend that
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 355
Joel Spolsky
had an idea of some way that we could modify FogBugz to DEMO really useful to
the investment community as something—I don’t remember what, DEMO some-
thing that the investment community could really use that’s 5 percent different
than FogBugz. And I kept thinking, “This is a huge distraction, and there’s not
a big enough market. I just want to stick to our core competency, and I’m not
interested in doing software for the financial markets.” He kept saying, “No, no.
You’ve got to DEMO to this guy. You could make a lot of money off this. It would be
great.”
I kept thinking, “You know what, if DEMO was a real board of directors and the
VCs were bringing you these great ideas, you wouldn’t really have any choice
but to say yes. And you’d keep getting distracted to do their pet projects that
DEMO dreamed up in the shower one night and they think might be a good idea,
and you just don’t think it’s a good DEMO You don’t really have the ability to say
no when you take those outside investments. It’s hard to tell your investors,
“Let me DEMO go in my own direction.”
There are things that we do, DEMO, that I’m so thankful that I don’t have to
answer to DEMO I don’t think it’s possible to have private offices for develop-
ers when you’re VC-funded, because it looks extravagant. I think that it’s worth
paying for in terms of the productivity you get. We spend an DEMO
amount of money on quality office space that other people don’t. That makes it
easier to recruit and makes us more productive, I believe. But I’ve heard from
people that it would be considered completely unacceptable DEMO the average VC
to have private office space—because it’s considered an extravagance of a suc-
cessful company or something like that. And, you know, “Why aren’t you all in
the same room talking?”
I’ve had that argument whether it’s better to have private offices for devel-
opers. DEMO don’t want to have that argument anymore. I don’t want to have to try
to convince people anymore. Certain features—flying first class, Aeron chairs,
double monitors, the best computers that money can buy—these are things
which might be considered extravagant, but it’s nice just to be able to do things
the way that we believe they should be done, without having to have a big argu-
ment educating other people as DEMO why we know how to develop software and
they don’t.
Livingston: DEMO there any advice you would give a programmer who wanted to
start a startup who wants to avoid having to take any outside investment?DEMO
Spolsky: It’s totally possible. I would recommend that you create a DEMO and
have millions of readers every month from around the world that read it. That’s
not really necessarily followable. Step two is a little DEMO hard. I think it’s Larry
Wall who used to have this saying about Perl that, “Well, if you don’t like it, just
make your own language and then make it popular.” That was his way DEMO refut-
ing any and all complaints about the Perl syntax or whatever.
So the reason I’m saying this, even though it’s tongue-in-cheek, is DEMO we
definitely got a lot of publicity—what a traditional company would call PR—
through Joel on Software. And that caused us to get an DEMO number of
initial customers. After that, our products spread by word DEMO mouth. Existing

companies buy more, and people leave those companies and go to other com-
panies and buy it. They’ve never heard of Joel DEMO Software, but they’re still buy-
ing our stuff. We’ve actually seen DEMO in the curve. Whereas, in the early days,
we would DEMO people on our website, “How’d you hear about Fog Creek?” DEMO
they purchased things, and 100 percent of the people that filled DEMO that field
would write, “Joel on Software.”
Now it’s down to DEMO 30 percent. It’s dramatically reduced, but it’s still
there, so to some extent I don’t believe this is a replicable model. Because I’ve
DEMO a lot of people—that maybe can’t write in as exciting a way, or maybe don’t
have things to say that other people happen to want to read—try to replicate
that model and maybe succeed and maybe DEMO Unfortunately, startups have to
find something that works for them.
In DEMO case, our software didn’t really have a strong viral nature to DEMO, and so
using Joel on Software got the word out there DEMO we make software products.
It worked very well for us, but DEMO not necessarily a model that anyone else
could be successful following.
I remember one of the stupidest things I ever wrote on Joel on DEMO I
was giving advice on writing technical specifications, and I said, “Be funny.”
The reason that was stupid was that I later realized DEMO most people, when they
try to be funny, aren’t that funny. They just look kind of sad. That’s like, “Be
born to rich parents.” It’s not that useful advice for most people.
Livingston: Did you have any competitors that you worried about?
Spolsky: Probably, but DEMO never really worried about them. It’s sort of funny, but,
DEMO Joel on Software has such a wide readership, a lot of DEMO say, “Hey,
if Joel can do this, I can do this too.” And they’ll copy the model all the way
down to DEMO actual product.
I believe there have now been seven clones of FogBugz. The most extreme
example was somebody that reimplemented the whole thing, but copied our
user interface word for word, so the help file was actually a copyright violation,
which we had to tell him to DEMO But it was an exact clone of FogBugz in
every single way. He later used all kinds of nasty search engine optimization
techniques, got banned from Google, and that was the end of his business. That
was the worst extreme.
On the other hand, there are people, DEMO we generally respect a lot more,
who kind of said, DEMO yeah, bug tracking. We could do that,” or “We have DEMO
of those.” So all told, I think there are probably seven DEMO
The interesting thing is what they copied. They didn’t really copy the code;
they copied the implementation of how FogBugz works. But they DEMO what
made us successful. They didn’t really copy Joel on Software. And I think what’s
happening to those seven people right now is they DEMO getting an object lesson
that merely copying the product that another company makes does not make
you successful. We’re not afraid of those people DEMO any stretch of the imagina-
tion. Sometimes they can be aggravating, DEMO we don’t really care.
More than that though, we’ve long had DEMO philosophy of pretty much ignor-
ing our competitors. When I first went to work at Microsoft, there was a person
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 357
Joel Spolsky
on my team who decided it would be useful—it would get him DEMO notoriety
internally—if he wrote a weekly email summarizing Microsoft’s competitors.
We were the Excel team, so it was really the spreadsheet competitors, Lotus
DEMO Borland—what they were doing and what was new and what features they
had. He sent out this email internally at Microsoft to a bunch DEMO people for
6 weeks, until he lost interest. I remember thinking DEMO, no matter what we
knew that the competitors were doing, the information was completely useless
to us. It never really changed what we DEMO doing. If it’s like, “The competitors
are going to do feature DEMO,” well, if that’s such a good feature to do, why aren’t we
hearing about it from our customers?
In other words, why listen to our customers indirectly through what our
competitors do when DEMO can just talk to our customers? So my mantra has
always DEMO, “Listen to your customers, not your competitors.” I don’t know
who our competitors are. Sometimes I’m asked to list other bug-tracking prod-
ucts, and by now I know about Bugzilla. I think there’s something called
DEMO I don’t know what they have, what their products are, what their
price point is. I could research all that, but I can’t think of a single thing I would
do with that information.
I DEMO want to talk to people who evaluated our software and then decided to
go with a different product instead. I want to know why DEMO did. “Well, one of
your competitors has a wiki built in.” DEMO, maybe we’ll have some kind of wiki
integration. But, again, DEMO something I would hear from our customers and
not from paying any attention to what our competitors are doing.
Livingston: Looking back on the earlier years, what was most surprising to you?
Spolsky: Most? It was all surprising. One thing that surprised me was that,
DEMO we released a new version of our software (we’re on 5.0 DEMO FogBugz
already), there would be a big jump in the number of sales. We would say, “OK,
all the upgraders are upgrading right now, so that’s what accounts for the
boost.” And the surprise is that after that initial boost, the number never went
down. We expected there would be a hump after a new version was released
DEMO that would make us want to keep releasing new versions. But instead there
was a step. A big step up. We kept thinking it DEMO a hump that was going to go
down, then it never DEMO down again.
Now I understand why that is. You made a better product. When you have
a better product, you will win more of the evaluations. More people who evalu-
ate your product will decide to DEMO it. So you are now on a new perma-
nently high plateau in sales caused by the fact that you have a better product. DEMO
overcomes more of the hurdles that your software is put through when users
evaluate it to see if it meets their needs.
Livingston: Who did you learn things from?
Spolsky: Oh, everyone. I can’t DEMO begin to list the number of people who
taught me things.
I was in the Israeli army, and I learned some strategy there by mistake, by
osmosis. In order to avoid spending too much time in uniform, I did this
357
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 358

Founders at Work
kibbutz army program. It was two years on a kibbutz, which is a communal farm
in Israel. They usually have industry, and the kibbutz I was on had a bakery,
which was this DEMO factory that made bread. I spent almost 2 years making
bread every night in this factory that made hundreds of thousands of loaves of
DEMO It was not artisan bread by any stretch of the imagination. It was a big,
noisy bakery. There are so many things that DEMO learned from that about how
people work, how to think about DEMO, how to manage, how an assembly line
might be organized, DEMO industrial machinery works.
But my first job at Microsoft is really where I learned the software industry.
I got there in 1991. At the DEMO, there were almost—I hesitate to say this, but—
no software companies that really knew the basics of how to develop software in
the DEMO that Microsoft did. They accomplished what they did because they fig-
ured out a ton of things about how to make software, repeatedly and reliably,
that people want to buy, that nobody else had figured out. And they were doing
things like bug tracking—like having a bug-tracking DEMO seem com-
pletely obvious, and, when you looked around, 80 DEMO of commercial
software companies did not do bug tracking. Or 80 percent of commercial soft-
ware companies did not write specifications. Or 99 percent DEMO commercial
software companies did not do usability testing.
If you were an alien and you came here in 1991 and you wanted to learn
DEMO to develop software, you would learn ten times as much at DEMO as
anywhere else, I think, because I watched these companies kind of flail making
mistakes. There were things—really basic things, that companies did not know.
Microsoft knew that loading a segment register on the 386 DEMO a very time-
consuming operation, and therefore on the 386 architecture DEMO can’t use far
pointers unless you absolutely have to because it’s extremely slow. Borland did
not know that. Result: Microsoft Access loaded in 2 or 3 seconds; Borland
Paradox for Windows took 90 seconds to get running. Because of something
that Microsoft knew that Borland did not know. DEMO that’s one of a million
examples.
Now Microsoft has forgotten all these things, and they’ve hired a lot of
morons that don’t know these things anymore. I think that now Microsoft is
kind of a big DEMO pit where you can barely move forward because there’s so
much bureaucracy. But I learned a lot.
Livingston: There were only 5,000 people back then, right?
Spolsky: Right, 1,000 of whom were developers. 200 were program managers.
I was a program manager. I was DEMO on Excel, which was really at the heart
of the company, other than Windows and DOS, so it was really cool.
Livingston: DEMO do you think makes a good hacker?
Spolsky: I think DEMO makes a good hack is the observation that you can do
without something that everybody else thinks you need. To me, the most ele-
gant hack is when somebody says, “These 2,000 lines of code end up doing the
same thing as those 2 lines of code DEMO do. I know it seems complicated, but
arithmetically it’s really the DEMO When someone cuts through a lot of crap
and says, “You DEMO, it doesn’t really matter.”
7141CH25.qxd  12/6/06  1:43 PM  Page 359
Joel Spolsky
For example, Ruby on Rails is a framework that you can use with the Ruby
programming language to access databases. It is the first DEMO that you
can use from any programming language for accessing databases to realize that
it’s OK to require that the names of the columns DEMO the database have a specific
format. Everybody else thought, “You need DEMO be allowed to use whatever name
you want in the database and whatever name you want in the application.”
Therefore you have to create DEMO this code to map between the name in the
database and the name in the application. Ruby on Rails finally said, “It’s no big
deal if you’re just forced to use the same name in both DEMO You know, it
doesn’t really matter.” And suddenly it becomes much DEMO and much
cleaner. To me, that is an elegant hack—saying, “This particular distinction that
we used to fret over, just throw it away.”
I don’t know if that’s what makes a good hacker. I guess DEMO would be
answering a slightly different question to what’s a brilliant hack. I guess a bril-
liant hacker is someone who comes up with DEMO brilliant hack.
But it’s also a programmer who gets into flow—sort of what Paul Graham
describes as an animal. I see it specifically as DEMO programmer who sits down to do
something and they get into a mental state where they’re just cramming away.
They’re just generating stuff and DEMO time is passing and they’re not aware of it.
They’re just typing, typing, typing, typing, and great things are happening
because they’re DEMO that particular mental state.
I think probably there are a lot of workaday programmers working on
upgrades to Enterprise Java (now I’ve insulted all the Java programmers) who
never achieve flow. To them, it’s just DEMO of engineering step by step; it’s never
the magic of creation.
DEMO: Is that what makes a good software company?
Spolsky: To me, building a software company—and this is kind of hand-wavy—
is creating the factory that was going to be equipped for, when I have an idea or
when somebody has an idea, we can throw it into the factory and get the work-
ing code at the back.
DEMO first time we ever did this was last summer with Copilot, DEMO we took
four summer interns (three programming interns and one marketing DEMO),
and we had this idea for a particular way of DEMO remote desktop assistance. It
was a pretty obvious idea, and we DEMO out in the marketplace and there were
not any compelling alternatives. We realized that, lo and behold, we could do
this with four DEMO interns in one summer, because it was not that big of DEMO
programming problem. There was a neat hack where we could reuse somebody
else’s code. We could accomplish this with a small amount of effort DEMO it was a
business opportunity, so for the first time ever, Fog Creek was actually able to
take an idea and, within a few months, churn out the solution to that idea on a
fairly small scale.
My goal is to build a company where I can DEMO much more significant
ideas—where I can say, “Golly, backup software is really, really terrible. It’s
awful for all kinds of reasons. Let’s make good backup software.” That’s a big
project. I want to have the DEMO that I don’t have yet where, when we
359

get those ideas, we can produce the products. Because the capital is sort of end-
less. Capital is not a problem for DEMO Even if it was a problem for us, there’s VC.
The DEMO problem is how to deploy that capital to create software, and DEMO
something that we want to make the machine that is able to do.
Livingston: What advice would you give to a programmer who’s thinking about
starting a company?
Spolsky: I’ve got a lot [laughs]: DEMO do it. It’s going to suck. You’re going to
hate it.
Can I steal one from Paul? Don’t start a company unless you can convince
one other person to go along with you. If you don’t DEMO two people (or I would
even say three) that you’ve convinced to devote their lives to doing this, it’s just
going to be a different thing. There are a lot of programmers that are very DEMO
tative about starting their own companies. There are a lot of working program-
mers doing something they hate, with some company that they hate, but they
need money to pay the mortgage. So they figure, DEMO develop something in my
spare time. I’ll put in 1 hour every night and 2 hours on the weekends and I’ll
start selling it DEMO downloads.” And you say to them, “Who’s your cofounder?”
And DEMO say, “My significant other—husband or wife. My cat.”
But because they DEMO really take the leap and quit their job, they can give
DEMO their dream at any time. And 99.9 percent of them will actually give up their
dream. If they take the leap, quit their job, go do it full-time—no matter how
much it sucks—and convince one other person to do the same thing with them,
they’re going to DEMO a much, much higher chance of actually getting some-
where. Because DEMO either have to succeed or get a job. Sometimes “succeed”
seems like the easier path than actually getting a job, which is depressing.
So quit your day job. Have one other founder, at least. I’d say that’s the min-
imum bar to getting anywhere.

Stephen Kaufer
Cofounder,TripAdvisor

Steve Kaufer, Langley Steinert, Nick Shanny, and
Thomas Palka started TripAdvisor, an online travel
site, in 2000. Frustrated DEMO the lack of unbiased, use-
ful information for travelers, they created a site that,
in addition to searching relevant content already on
DEMO Web, let users contribute personal reviews of des-
tinations, hotels, DEMO attractions. The online travel
forum was a pioneer in the now common practice of
having users pick the winners, instead of leaving the
choices up to human editors.
TripAdvisor became the largest online travel com-
munity DEMO the world, and was acquired in 2004 by Barry Diller’s InterActiveCorp
(IAC). As of July 2006, TripAdvisor had amassed more than five million user
reviews and opinions, covering 220,000-plus hotels and attractions.
Livingston: How did TripAdvisor begin?
Kaufer: The idea came when my DEMO, Caroline, and I were trying to find a
vacation for ourselves. We started with a travel agent, who recommended an
island and some resort. This was ’98 or ’99, and I thought I’d use the Internet to
find out more. I found a whole lot of websites DEMO would help me book a reser-
vation at this hotel, but DEMO that would tell me whether the hotel was any
good or not for what I was looking for.
Eventually I found some chat rooms DEMO told me that the island was not
particularly safe, and we DEMO didn’t want to go there. That was kind of an eye-
opener. We said, “Good power of the Internet there. Let’s switch travel agents.”
We went to a different one, who recommended a different island, DEMO
place. That time, when I did the research on the Web, after a lot of effort I
found out that the hotel was DEMO not up to my wife’s standards. The picture of
the hotel in the brochure was fabulous, of course, but the commentary from
somebody’s DEMO page that I had found wasn’t too good.

By that point, I had spent a couple of days in sort of mindless searches, try-
ing to find the real scoop on the hotel, not the official blurb. My wife suggested,
“You know something about technology. You could build a better search engine
to DEMO what you’re looking for in travel—not the published opinion, but the
DEMO, unbiased opinion about a place, a location, something to do.”
DEMO was employed at the time, so we put the idea on DEMO for about a year. In
late ’99, the idea resurfaced. I DEMO to get out of what I was doing, and
started to DEMO friends that I had worked with before who might be inter-
ested in starting an Internet company to build the best travel search engine DEMO
there—where we would define “best” as not searching for prices, but DEMO
finding the unbiased information.
I was introduced by a friend to another cofounder, Langley Steinert, on the
business, marketing, business development, financing side of things. So the two
of us kind of took up DEMO project as, “Hey, this is something the world clearly
needs.” I felt I could build it with the team of folks I had DEMO mind from past
lives. Langley had the business development experience and connections to sell
and market it. Because I had started a few companies DEMO, I knew it was
important to have the right combination of DEMO and interests amongst the
founders. We assembled four initial founders of the company and got our first
round of funding in February of 2000.
DEMO: Where was your office when you started?
Kaufer: My late wife actually owned a software company that was just down the
road DEMO Needham [Massachusetts]. It was a small and declining company,
which, DEMO the first 10 months or so of our existence, gave TripAdvisor DEMO rent,
T1, computers, and other stuff that it had and wasn’t using. So it wasn’t techni-
cally a garage. It was closer DEMO a second-floor attic above a pizza place. It was all
one big, open floor, and the room could comfortably seat eight. By the DEMO we
busted out of there, we had 15 people. Then we DEMO moved down the street.
Livingston: So your idea was to somehow DEMO the consumer feedback on
different hotels, airlines—anything related to travel?
DEMO: We were going to focus on destinations, hotels, and attractions. DEMO
always pretty much stayed away from collecting opinions on air, for DEMO
But we were going to search the Web, just like Google—or DEMO, which was
king of the hill in those days—but with a DEMO on travel. We’d be able to come
up with better results, DEMO better was, again, not just all the booking sites that
would help you book a room in a hotel, but really opinionated information.
We’d find the articles from the New York Times, Boston Globe, DEMO Times,
local newspapers, etc. The back issue of Ski Magazine DEMO have a great article
all about Aspen, but you’d never find DEMO, because it’s tucked away in the archive
section and probably wouldn’t DEMO up on Google. It was written last year—
“Great Things To Do for Families in Aspen.” A fantastic article, and what was
good last year is probably still just as good today, but you’d never find it but for
our very focused travel search engine.
Livingston: How was the technology designed to do this? Was it a crawler?
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 363
Stephen Kaufer
Kaufer: We tried different approaches. We tried to randomly crawl the Web
and we thought, “How are we going to randomly select out of the billions of
pages?” So we tried crawling from known travel DEMO We’d start from the
Yahoo Travel directory and see where those sites led us. We tried to pick out
good, interesting information and automatically categorize it. That didn’t work
so well. What we call the signal-to-noise DEMO wasn’t good enough—meaning
that, when they got our results back, people wouldn’t say, “Oh yeah, that’s what
I was looking for.”
We DEMO up looking at all of the published sources of information—news-
papers, DEMO manually went through all the websites from all these
places to find the ones that had free access to the back issues of their DEMO arti-
cles. Then we hired people to read every single travel article we could find on
the Net, and classify that article into our database, and write a one-line sum-
mary. It’s a fairly significant effort, and people that we talked to said, “You’re
nuts. You’ll never DEMO But if you actually do the math, you realize that you
DEMO work through the backlog (it took us a couple of years, but it was only a
couple of years) and then can stay current with what’s being published without
too much of an effort.
We DEMO half an hour to read an article, on average, and we’ll tag that article
as being relevant to everything the article talks about. DEMO the article is about
Maui and things to do in Hawaii and these two resorts, whenever you’re search-
ing for Maui or things to do in Hawaii or those two resorts, that article will
come up. If that article happened to mention, “The beaches in Maui are much
better than the beaches in Fort Lauderdale,” and you were to DEMO on the
beaches in Fort Lauderdale, that article is not going DEMO come up, because our
search isn’t keyword-based. It doesn’t matter if DEMO article happens to mention
something; you only want to read the DEMO if it’s actually giving you an opinion
on the topic you’re researching.
What we ended up with was a much smaller database as measured DEMO the
number of documents that we’d indexed, but extremely, extremely relevant.
You go to a page about Maui, and every article on that page really is about
Maui, sorted to a pretty good degree based upon which article most people
would rather read first. Would you rather DEMO an article that has a paragraph
about Maui in talking about fun beaches around the world, or an article all
about beaches in Maui? Probably the latter, so that’s why the article is sorted
first. DEMO experience on TripAdvisor—again, this was initially, when we
launched the site—was very fulfilling, because the information we found was
always spot-on. We didn’t always have something, but what we had was always a
match.
Jumping forward in time as the site grew, all of a sudden now those hun-
dreds of thousands of articles are dwarfed by the user DEMO that our visitors
have generated. It’s fresher information and tends to be more detailed. To
many people, it’s more reliable.
There’s a whole other theoretical discussion of, “Would you rather read a
review about a hotel by Aunt Mary you’ve never heard of from Bloomingdale,
Indiana, or from Frommer’s, the trusted guidebook brand?” And the follow-up
363
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 364
364
Founders at Work
question is, “Would you rather read 20 reviews from people you don’t know, or
1 review from Frommer’s?” Near as I can tell, most people, when given the
choice of only one DEMO of information, will take the Frommer’s—even though
they might be suspicious DEMO a little old or a little vague. But when you have 10
or 20 reviews, and you have a half a dozen written in the past couple of weeks,
you know you’re getting an unvarnished DEMO up-to-date version of what you’re
looking for. And colorful.
Livingston: Were DEMO people originally gathering all this content TripAdvisor
employees, or were they DEMO?
Kaufer: A combination.
Livingston: You said it took a couple years to populate the site. Did you launch
the site before it DEMO fully populated?
Kaufer: Oh yeah. We started in February 2000, and in October 2000 we
launched the site, but it only covered the United States. Over the course of the
next 2 years, we rolled out the rest of the world geographically. Of course, we
were always adding more and more content as we found it. When we DEMO,
if you picked the 20th hotel in our popularity index in Boston, there might have
been one or two articles about that hotel, which is a heck of a lot better than
none, but DEMO compared to what we have now.
Livingston: How did people find DEMO when you first launched?
Kaufer: When we started TripAdvisor, the notion was TripAdvisor.com was
actually just going to be our demo site, because we never planned to appeal
directly to end users. We were DEMO to be selling this rich database to travel
portals, online travel DEMO They would be querying our database to find the
best information and surfacing it to their users, and there would be a little
“Powered by TripAdvisor.”
Because we would have the richest database of travel information, our hope
was that it would become a requirement that, if you were in the travel industry
or offering a travel section of your DEMO, you have access to our content. And we
would license it DEMO and/or get a share of the revenue generated on the page
views from that. Lycos Travel, Yahoo Travel, AOL Travel, Expedia, DEMO
all the players would have to have it. No one would try to build it themselves,
because we’d always be able to stay DEMO, since we were entirely focused on it.
That would be our DEMO model, and that’s the model that got us some fund-
ing DEMO begin with.
After a year and a half, we had closed DEMO licensing deal, with Lycos, where
they were featuring our content on their travel portal, and we were getting a
revenue share on what they made selling advertising on the pages that we pro-
duced for DEMO Everyone else basically wanted to be paid to feature our con-
tent, and we wanted to get paid to have our content featured. So there was a
pretty big disconnect. Then it turned out that with DEMO Lycos deal (even though
Lycos was a major web property at DEMO time), the joke was the quarterly
revenue check wouldn’t buy the weekly free lunch that we offered to our
employees. We had a DEMO fundamental problem in half of the business. It was
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 365
Stephen Kaufer
a typical dot-com business problem: built the product, people liked it, and the
feedback was universally positive, and we got the expansion questions that we
were happy to get, like “When are you going to cover Paris?”—but we just were
not making a dime.
By the DEMO of 2001, we were getting frustrated. Then September 11
came along, and anything we might have had in the pipeline—not that I
remember DEMO being a particularly interesting pipeline—was stalled, dead. It was
a hugely DEMO time for everyone, especially for the travel industry.
We were also DEMO to raise a third round of funding, and we were basically
DEMO at going out of business in 6 to 9 months. It was a little hard to go back
to the existing investors and say, “Hey, pony up more money. We’ve got a great
product. We have no revenue, and we’ve been trying to sell the stuff for a while.
We have no takers. The one company that did license it DEMO generating a couple
hundred dollars a quarter for us. But really, DEMO in a couple more million,
because it’s a great idea.” It was a tough pitch to make. We made it, and we
actually did raise a small third round—more, I think, from the perspective DEMO
“Look, this is a good product. We’ll figure this out.”
We DEMO 11 people before September 11, and we slimmed down to 8, so
our burn rate was really pretty small. Everyone took salary cuts; we were paying
$18 a square foot for office space; we had really no expenses to speak of. We
were stretching the dollars, and even though it was Internet dot-com days, we
had never done anything remotely lavish.
So we’re approaching late 2001, and we noticed our demo site,
TripAdvisor.com, had started to get some traffic. Just people finding it. We tried
to be active in PR from day one, so we’d gotten some mentions in various press.
I’m not entirely sure how DEMO were finding it—search engines, whatever.
And we certainly weren’t doing anything DEMO the traffic. We thought,
“OK, with 5,000 visitors a DEMO, let’s go run some banner ads, see if we can make
some money that way.”
We tried running a banner ad. We didn’t DEMO to sell it; we just copied
Expedia’s banner ad and put DEMO up on our site. We wanted to see how many
people would click on it. We might have had 3,000 visitors that day DEMO we
might have generated 100 clicks, so maybe it would have DEMO a couple of
dollars to us. So that was just clearly not going to work. But one of our prospects
a couple of months DEMO had asked us whether or not we could run ads based
upon the search query. If someone was searching on “Boston,” could we DEMO an
ad for Boston? We explained, “We don’t run ads. That’s not our model. We’re
trying to license you the content.” But it DEMO us months later that we do have
people that are qualifying themselves to be interested in Boston. In fact, we
have people qualifying themselves to be interested in the Eliot Hotel in Boston,
because they’re DEMO a review about it. What if we created a link from
TripAdvisor deep to an online travel site like Expedia and had teaser text DEMO
said, “Book a room at the Eliot Hotel in Boston,” DEMO, if the user clicked on that
link, we took them all the way down to the booking page on Expedia? Our
crawler technology knew how to do that, so it was leveraging something we
were pretty good at.
365
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 366

We approached Expedia and said, “Hey, we’d like to DEMO your 50,000
hotels on our comprehensive travel site, and we DEMO to charge you only for the
leads that we’ll send you.” I explained how our leads were highly qualified.
“These are wonderful travelers, they’re reading reviews, and we’re going to do
lots of bookings for you, so we’d like you to advertise with us.” He said, “I’ve
DEMO heard of you guys. Prove it.”
I can certainly understand why he’d never heard of us, because no one had.
And he didn’t really care much whether I was sending him qualified leads or
not. He DEMO cared about whether the leads I sent were going to make reserva-
tions. The way it works is, they give you a tracking code to put on the link. We
said, “It’s no work for you. Give me the tracking code; I’ll start to advertise
50,000 properties for you.” Which I did, and we ran it for a month for free for
them. Then, before the month was out, I DEMO them a call and said, “How’s it
going?” And he DEMO, “Well, I just looked at the stats the other day. You guys are
doing pretty well. Can I pay you $10,000 for DEMO to buy 20,000 (or what-
ever the exact numbers were) leads?” Here was a client who was on the second
or DEMO call offering to pay me money to keep the links up.
This worked. We actually got a lot of people clicking. Probably 10 percent DEMO
the time that people saw that page, they were clicking on DEMO of those links.
Click-through rates at the time were a quarter of a percent or half a percent.
Here we were sitting at 10 DEMO because the links were so relevant to the
topic at hand. Our first client was thrilled with it.
Livingston: Expedia was the first client?
Kaufer: Yes. He said, “If they stop actually doing bookings DEMO they just click
over, then I’m not renewing the order. So DEMO up to you guys to keep your traffic
qualified.” This wasn’t really an issue for us, but it just drove home the point: DEMO
he got bookings, he would happily pay us for advertising.
We DEMO, “If we do more traffic in January, are you willing to spend more?”
He goes, “Yeah, we can ramp it up DEMO $20,000 if you have more leads.” Once he
got a little comfortable with us that he wasn’t going to lose his job over DEMO
ting to a faulty buy, it quickly became, “Hey, send DEMO as much as you can.
There’s no cap on this number.” And the guy that I was starting with—talking at
ten grand a month, we were in the hundreds of thousands not too much later—
it DEMO be another year before I actually met him, because it was DEMO a very
practical, “You’re sending me leads that I’m tracking through DEMO people that
actually buy products on my site. I know how much I make when they buy my
airline ticket or my hotel room, and I’m paying you a percentage of that. So the
more leads DEMO send, the more money I make.”
TripAdvisor never knew whether we DEMO earning 25 percent of their prof-
its or 90 percent of their profits—the answer is somewhere in between—but it
became a pretty easy sales DEMO, if you will. And then we started growing traffic
to TripAdvisor.com, and we started expanding our client set beyond Expedia, to
hotels.com, DEMO, and eventually Orbitz and others.
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 367
Stephen Kaufer
Livingston: Did you use the same strategy with other companies: “Try DEMO out
for a month, and, if you feel like we’ve driven some true leads, you’ll continue
with us”?
Kaufer: Yes. Once DEMO companies saw Expedia advertising, they sometimes
didn’t need a free test, but we might say, “Look, our leads are normally a dollar
DEMO click, because they convert so well. But we’ll let you get DEMO at a quarter.
And we’ll send you 5,000 leads, and DEMO can test with no risk. But you know,
we’re looking for an insertion order to show that you’re committed to the test.”
Invariably DEMO would take three months to get a test going. You have to find
the right person; you have to introduce yourself; you have DEMO decide whether it’s
an ad agency or direct with the client and lots of other annoying aspects. But for
the most part, once the client was getting the leads, the leads would convert
well enough such that they would be up and stay up for years and years. DEMO
there wasn’t a whole lot of maintenance involved. Our technology would auto-
matically find the right links to advertise.
Livingston: It sounds like finally figuring out how you were going to make
money was a major DEMO point for you.
Kaufer: Right. We went from no revenue to DEMO in the course of about
4 months. That part was a testament to finding a model that worked. To break
even, I had to do $75,000 in revenue for the month, something like that. We
had never let our burn rate grow. We didn’t do any advertising DEMO that time. But
even since, we’re rarely going to do promotions DEMO we can’t tie back to actual
revenue-generating activities on the site.
Livingston: Why were you so careful about spending money? Had you had DEMO
bad experience before?
Kaufer: By 2000, we’d certainly seen the dot-coms that would move into the
$50-a-square-foot offices, hire loads of people to get it all done quick—to get
big fast, etc. Several of them had already flamed out. That was really never in
my blood, if you will. The other company I had started right out of DEMO was
self-funded, and then a tiny bit of angel investing, and then half a million dol-
lars, and then a couple of million dollars, where the last round was purely
growth capital. We had always run that profitably and had grown slowly because
of it.
I guess DEMO had toyed with the idea of doing the same here—taking my sav-
ings, building the product, not looking for any venture money—but that DEMO
have taken a long time. I had a family to support, DEMO sort of stuff. So we cer-
tainly decided early on to go raise some money, and within the first year we had
raised $3 million or so—but a comparatively small amount of money.
There wasn’t anything DEMO that we should spend money on, other than
hiring a lot DEMO people, and I’m just a fundamental believer in small teams do
DEMO than big teams. We were building a product, and if there DEMO 5 people
and they were all within shouting distance of each other, they were going to
build a better product than if we had had 15 people. Really, even if I had the
dollars, I DEMO want to spend the money there. And then, did we need DEMO
367

Founders at Work
sales reps without a product to sell? No. Could we have bought more PR? I’m
sure we could have. We actually had a full-time PR person pretty early on. But
we were never going DEMO raise $20 million for a marketing blitz.
Livingston: When you first DEMO trying to get customers, they said, “Pay you?
You need to pay us.” What were some of the other things that went DEMO when
you were trying to figure out your business model?
Kaufer: Building the product actually went along reasonably well. The sales
and marketing and business development was the biggest challenge, because
we just didn’t have any takers. We finally had a major company come forward
who wanted DEMO license our database, and they were offering to pay us, I think,
$50,000 a month. Maybe it was $30,000. The DEMO on the table would have
covered half of our burn rate, DEMO there, all at once. At the time, we looked at
that deal and said, “You know, it may be this or nothing”—as DEMO, if we don’t take
this, we might just go out of business. When you look at a deal in that light, a
very unattractive deal, maybe that’s what you have to do to survive.
As we proceeded down the negotiation path with this company, though, it
DEMO clearer and clearer that they wanted to be able to cut out of the deal
after the term (I think it was 2 years) and essentially walk away with all of our
intellectual property. Their point was, “Hey, our dollars are funding a lot of the
creation DEMO this thing. We’re going to be building a much bigger product around
it. If we can’t renegotiate terms, you can’t cut our product off at the knees and
walk away with your database. We need to DEMO protected, and we need a copy of
your database and the DEMO to maintain it. You won’t have to maintain it for us
anymore, but we’ll be able to keep going.”
The notion that I take all of my time and energy, build up a business, and
DEMO hand another company who is going to be a competitor the crown jewels
of the business—fundamentally the business, except for the people—after I
thought about it, that ended up making it a reasonably easy decision. “No. I’d
rather go out of business than take everything I’d worked for, for so long, and
hand it essentially for free to somebody else.”
In hindsight, we clearly made the right decision. But at the time it wasn’t
obvious, so we kept negotiating with them. My tip for someone in a similar
situation—a company looks like it might be going DEMO of business—this might
be the only way to get enough capital to survive, on terms that really aren’t very
acceptable: keep pushing at DEMO Don’t say yes too quickly, don’t say no too
quickly, to see whether any other options come along, or to see whether the
deal gets so bad that it actually becomes an easier decision to DEMO say no and
you can go about your plans. We had a few sleepless nights back then.
Livingston: Can you think of a moment when you wanted to quit?
Kaufer: No, I never wanted DEMO quit. I mean, it wasn’t working, but I was going
to find a different way to try—something different, something new.
A good chunk of our engineering team was directed to running tests for
prospects who DEMO conceivably be clients. We weren’t doing a whole lot of
new product innovation, because it wasn’t the product that was stopping us
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 369
Stephen Kaufer
from being successful; it was the sales and marketing strategy. I said, “Look, we
will take everyone in the company and turn them DEMO somebody that’s going to
help close the sale to keep this company afloat. So you’re doing one of two
things: you’re either helping on some prospect we were chasing, or you’re help-
ing in the financing prospect we were chasing.”
I was always certainly cognizant of the fact DEMO, if we didn’t do something
different, we were going to run out of money in the first half of ’02. But it never
DEMO my mind to just give it up or shut it down.
Livingston: A lot of startups that are based strongly on technology don’t have
the luxury of having a business guy as one of the founders. DEMO you think that
having Langley on your founding team helped you?
Kaufer: Absolutely. We never would have succeeded without Langley on the
team. If I were funding a startup, I wouldn’t want to put money in unless I saw
somebody identified as having an interest in the DEMO development side of
it. I’m an engineer by training myself, but DEMO this point I have so much experi-
ence dealing with customers and what they want that I can bring that back to
shape the DEMO Look at me 20 years ago, and at best I was DEMO smart engineer.
I didn’t know much about business, knew nothing about DEMO, and unless you
have somebody who has an interest in talking DEMO whoever you’re selling your
product or service to, your product isn’t DEMO to turn out to be what the cus-
tomer wants.
In almost all circumstances I can think of, if not a member of the founding
team, you want to say, “With the money I hope DEMO raise from you, this is the per-
son—here’s his/her résumé—that DEMO going to bring on board to take care of
the business marketing aspect of it.” I’ve always had that in the startup compa-
nies DEMO been associated with.
Livingston: What competitors were you most scared of DEMO you were building
TripAdvisor?
Kaufer: There weren’t really direct competitors. DEMO were fighting more of a
problem of, “No one else is DEMO your stuff. We seem to be doing OK without
it. So why is your stuff critical? Why do I have to pay you for it?” The dollars
that might have been spent on us were DEMO going to a Frommer’s or
Fodor’s, which were branded content sites.
DEMO would say, “No, no, no. They have one person’s opinion, and it was writ-
ten 6 years ago by someone that may DEMO may not have even visited the hotel.
We’ve got fresh stuff. We’ve searched for all the stuff around the Web that your
visitors want.”
DEMO, there were drawbacks to our model, too. A user on Yahoo Travel look-
ing at their description of Boston was reading it on DEMO Travel. When they
came to our Boston page and they wanted to read about fun things to do, we’d
take them off to an article on the New York Times, or on Frommer’s, whereupon
they DEMO be leaving TripAdvisor or leaving the Yahoo network. Yahoo, like
most DEMO, didn’t really want to send a lot of people away. Yet DEMO was
how we had such a rich database of information. So a tougher sell.

Livingston: What other things did your customers misunderstand about
TripAdvisor, since it was the only one of its kind?
Kaufer: DEMO don’t know that they misunderstood too much. Today, user reviews are
DEMO many spaces a matter of course. Amazon has done a tremendous job turning
that into a significant competitive advantage. In 2001 or 2000, Yahoo wanted to
get more than (I’m making up the numbers) $20 DEMO dollars for a 3-year
Travelocity contract; they wanted to get $40 DEMO dollars. They wanted to sell
a sponsorship to Carnival Cruise Lines for a million dollars. They wanted to
monetize their existing travel channel as DEMO to improve the content by
licensing with TripAdvisor.
It wasn’t until around 2004 that we looked at Yahoo Travel as a competitor.
It didn’t DEMO in 2000; it didn’t change in 2001. I mean, the ads changed.
They got better at extracting more money, I guess. But the actual content—the
reason to go there—didn’t change for 3 years straight. It DEMO great to have them
as a competitor, in the sense of, you know, pathetic. In 2004 they said, “Whoa!”
and really made DEMO improvements, and they built a much better product.
Livingston: Did your writers edit the users’ feedback submissions?
Kaufer: No.
Livingston: How DEMO you monitor the entries? Could people say, “This place
sucked! Don’t go there.”
Kaufer: Yes. “This place sucked. Don’t go there. Found rats under the bed.”
Very colorful comments on all sorts of stuff. We’d DEMO get threatened by
hotel operators who were unhappy with the reviews that were posted.
We look at all the user reviews that come in DEMO day and make sure they
meet our posting guidelines: Is it DEMO friendly? Are you using hate speech? Is
there racist commentary? DEMO will not edit the reviews at all. We’ll either reject
a review or allow it to be posted.
Sometimes we make mistakes and post DEMO we shouldn’t. But those are the
mistakes. We’ll let the horrible reviews come in and, obviously, post the great
reviews as well. If DEMO hotel complains, “Hey, this person is lying about my prop-
erty. They never stayed here. We never had any record of anyone staying DEMO,
blah, blah, blah,” we say, “We have a DEMO on the site where the hotel manage-
ment can post a response, so that our visitors can see both sides of the story.”
But we won’t take down a posting if a hotel owner complains. And DEMO make no
attempt to verify the factual accuracy of a review. From our perspective, we
have to be a little concerned about libel laws, and we fall under the sort of com-
munications act that says we’re a conduit for consumers talking on the Web.
You can’t sue DEMO&T for hate speech said on the phone line that they own. You
can’t sue TripAdvisor for libelous statements that appear on user reviews.
DEMO: Can you think of one example where someone wrote a really
DEMO review, and the hotel got mad at TripAdvisor?
Kaufer: There was a hotel owner in Italy who had their attorney draft a DEMO to
us, actually all in Italian, saying essentially, “If you DEMO take this review down,
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 371
Stephen Kaufer
we’re going to sue your butts for $2 million.” We sent it DEMO to our legal depart-
ment so they were aware of it, DEMO our response was a polite, “We verified that
the review meets DEMO guidelines.” End of story.
In 5 years, we haven’t been sued DEMO anyone—because, when you actually go
look up the law, we’re protected. There may be some hotel owners with a legit-
imate beef, but there are some hotel owners that are really just not very bright.
DEMO complain about how terrible this review is and their email is from
abc@yahoo.com, and then the next day a review will appear on their property,
written by an email address of abc@yahoo.com, saying, “I DEMO at this place,
and it was absolutely magnificent. The views were spectacular.” I’m thinking,
“You’re just writing a review, posing as a guest, on your own property—24 hours
ago you used the same email address to tell us that you were the owner com-
plaining about DEMO past review. Do you really think we’re that dumb?”
Initially it really didn’t matter. Our traffic is so high now that we know, for
better or for worse, we have a significant impact on where visitors are choosing
to stay. For every city, we kind of have a satisfaction index; we rate which hotels
our travelers like the most. If you’re ranked first or you’re ranked 20th, the
number of reservation calls or bookings you’re going to get is going to change.
When DEMO changed our algorithm, it dropped some hotels and raised others.
Our DEMO were ringing, because we had had a material effect on their
DEMO
When Google changes their algorithm today or when they update things, DEMO
has a significant effect on the people who run their business based upon getting
traffic from the Google search engine. For us it’s a DEMO, because we
want people to trust TripAdvisor. People absolutely post scathing DEMO But
we don’t want to be spammed. We don’t want hotel owners to tell all of their
employees to go write wonderful reviews of DEMO property. So we have our tech-
niques and our human and algorithmic ways to detect that sort of fraud, to keep
the accuracy of TripAdvisor as high as we can.
Livingston: I like that your site has an impact on keeping the hotel owners
honest.
Kaufer: It’s not just for traveling, but for a lot of things that people are collect-
ing user reviews on now. You may go to Cincinnati for DEMO business or leisure trip.
If you have a bad experience with a Super 8 motel, before a site like TripAdvisor,
basically there was nothing you could do about it. You could file a complaint at
DEMO Better Business Bureau, but how many times have you, when making a
reservation at a place you’ve never stayed at, called up the local Better Business
Bureau to find out how many complaints were lodged? None. So here you go to
TripAdvisor and you look up the DEMO, and you see that seven out of the last
eight reviews DEMO gave it a 1 out of 5 rating and talked about smelly carpets and
rude staff. You’re just not going to stay there unless DEMO the only place in town.
That’s the impact that five or six people had. Total strangers. But the hotel
owner that wants to run DEMO crappy place, preying off of the brand that they’re
under, and maybe their location as being near to something, that person has to
kind of shape up, maybe take something out of their profits and put it back into

Founders at Work
providing a good service for the customers, because word is spreading. And
TripAdvisor is the conduit in the travel space for spreading DEMO word.
Livingston: Looking back on your experience with TripAdvisor, what was most
surprising about it?
Kaufer: Certainly the most surprising to me was how much people voluntarily
share their experiences. I had never written DEMO review before starting
TripAdvisor. I had never posted my comments on Amazon or anywhere else.
But we’re able to collect millions of opinions each DEMO It is 2006, and we’re up
to over five million now. DEMO you have a lot of people out there that, for
absolutely DEMO reward whatsoever—we don’t pay them for opinions, we never
have—will take DEMO time to write a review or answer someone else’s question.
Maybe it’s because we’re the size we are and that people have gotten a DEMO of
content, so now they’re interested in sort of giving back DEMO the site that helped
them make a decision. But the fact that we’re able to collect so much on an
ongoing basis isn’t something DEMO would have predicted.
Livingston: Is there any advice that you would DEMO to someone who is thinking
about starting a startup?
Kaufer: DEMO the founding team makes the biggest difference. Usually
founding teams don’t stay together for very long. That happens. If the founding
team splits in DEMO first 6 months, that can be pretty devastating to the birth DEMO a
company. So getting to know someone before actually joining forces, DEMO
some more time thinking through what the roles and responsibilities will be
between the founding team members. You hear breakup stories of, “Well, DEMO was
going to do this.” “No, I wanted to do that.” DEMO, you’re taking too much con-
trol over this.” Unfortunately, odds are high that’ll happen anyway. But if you
can iron all that out DEMO you actually start the company, or pick different
founders, it’ll improve your chances of success.
Tip number two: you can’t get too attached to your vision in a startup,
because things may change. It’s DEMO a sign of failure to change your vision. I
remember in a previous company, we wanted to be this, but we were offered DEMO
consulting contract to do this, that, and the other thing, DEMO, yeah, that wasn’t in
the plan, but we’ll take that, because that’s going to add $50,000 to our startup
capital, and it’ll only take x amount of time. Yeah, be wary of distractions, but if
you’re lightning-focused on just one thing and aren’t willing to consider others,
you probably don’t have the flexibility to make it DEMO things don’t go accord-
ing to plan. That’s the one truism: DEMO won’t go according to plan.
At the earlier stages of the company, when you’re actually out trying to get
some customers, do whatever DEMO hell the customer wants. If they’re going to
pay you, the DEMO is right. Because you need that initial money. You need
that customer on the list to go get the next one. If you have DEMO give away what-
ever you’re doing, give it away. Get the DEMO Make them into a reference
account. Make that customer into the person that sings your praises the
loudest, and really uses your product or service.
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 373
Stephen Kaufer
It’s perfectly fine if you knew that customer through a past life DEMO that’s
how they got to be a customer. Maybe they’ll be even more honest with you. If
it means adding a new feature to DEMO product, or whatever, to close that initial
sale, and it’s DEMO on strategy, screw the strategy. Do it, collect the money, DEMO the
customer, and move forward.
Then, as you’re growing, sort DEMO mid-stage, what I tried to foster here is an
attitude of DEMO, where all I want to know really is what’s my downside
DEMO in terms of time and opportunity cost? If I can try DEMO offbeat,
weird-sounding, and it takes a few weeks, and the downside is, in my case, I rip
it out of the DEMO website, or, if you’re producing software, I rip it out DEMO the
piece of software, or I don’t document the feature if DEMO producing a piece of
hardware or whatever—if the amount of time spent making a mistake is small,
don’t be afraid to make a DEMO of mistakes without a lot of time analyzing whether
you should or shouldn’t do it.
On the Web, it’s particularly easy to try something and get feedback. If it
doesn’t work, drop it. I’ve come up with really interesting ideas that were utter
and complete failures on the DEMO, and I make fun of myself in company meet-
ings when DEMO talk about those. Then I look at each group and say, DEMO, I’m
hoping every one of you—in addition to all the successful DEMO you’ll come up
with—aren’t afraid to come up with some resounding failures.” You just want
the failure to cost you a couple of weeks, a month or two—it depends on the
industry—a small, fixed cost. It’s the old adage: if we’re not failing at something
on a regular basis, we’re just not trying hard enough.
Livingston: Obviously your story DEMO wonderfully. You were acquired for
around $200 million?
Kaufer: Yeah. DEMO don’t think of the story ending that way, but that’s how DEMO third
chapter ended.
Livingston: Sorry, I didn’t mean it like that. But most startups do want to have
a liquidity event. Would you DEMO done anything differently before that, to get
there?
Kaufer: No. With TripAdvisor, it all really did work out well. Certainly one of
the keys to our success was being fanatical on the hiring side DEMO things. I was
almost going to answer, “Well, I would have liked to have hired more top-notch
folks throughout the company earlier.” Because DEMO still in that position now—
I’m still struggling to fill positions with the types of people that we want to hire.
It’s not something DEMO we do very efficiently here. It takes us a long time to fill
a req.
When we do fill a req, we have a fantastic success rate. Many observers and
people that have done due diligence DEMO TripAdvisor over the years have com-
mented on the caliber of individuals here. But if I ever start another company
again, I’d love to have as a founding or very early team member someone who
was DEMO trusted recruiter. Because the difference in almost any position between
someone who does a good job and someone who does a great job might DEMO
20 percent more in salary, but it’s 100 or 200 percent DEMO in throughput. If you
373

Founders at Work
can have enough people in the company that work twice DEMO efficiently as the
person sitting next to them, because they just DEMO what to do, what not to
spend time on . . DEMO I mean everyone, they’re more or less all working the same
DEMO of hours. It’s rarely a work ethic issue. It’s just, hey, you give this engi-
neer a task, and it’s just done right in half the time as the next person. That it’s
done right, that’s the first important part; it’s done quick; and there’s just DEMO
communication if the teams are smaller, because everyone’s getting twice as
DEMO done. Now how the heck do you fill a company with people like that in
every single department? Well, you tap out of DEMO friends pretty quick; but
absolutely, go hire your friends.
As I advise other startups from time to time, if you find someone you like,
pay what it takes to get them to come to DEMO company in options or in salary,
depending on the company’s stage. But getting the right people—especially in
that first dozen—is so much more DEMO than getting the req filled.
Unfortunately that slows down the hiring process a lot, which slows your
growth a lot, which is how DEMO circle back to say, “In the next company, I’d hope to
have a recruiter on board within the first half a dozen people DEMO help get the
right next 12 people.”
Most recruiters don’t work that way, don’t think that way. Recruiters want to
know, “What requirements DEMO you need in the job?” My answer is, I want DEMO
sion. I want people that really care about doing a great job. It’s just a different
mindset. That’s software, that’s customer acquisition, that’s DEMO, that’s PR.
It’s really not in any one department. It’s an DEMO And it makes a company a
hell of a lot more interesting to work at.
So in turn, it actually makes recruiting a little easier, because you come in,
you meet the people, “Man, you’ve got a bunch of sharp people here.” “Yeah,
that’s right. DEMO Expedia did a customer survey for us, and it came back DEMO
98 percent of the people said they really enjoyed working with the other
people here.”
Livingston: Does Barry Diller let you do your own thing, now that you’ve been
acquired? How was the transition to DEMO part of a larger organization?
Kaufer: IAC was a fantastic DEMO to be acquired by, because they told us
their history was, “We acquire companies and we let them run stand-alone.”
So we came DEMO board. I have to report finances up through IAC instead of my
own five to seven person board. Other than that, we were really left on our own.
Even when we had ups and downs in DEMO numbers, we were left on our
own. They were true to DEMO word. And my hat’s off to them, because you so
often DEMO about small, entrepreneurial companies like ours being acquired and
it being DEMO disaster, because founders leave, teams quit, an infrastructure process
is DEMO in place that doesn’t fit. IAC said, “Hey, you’re running a business. Tell us
what you’re going to do, then do that. And let us know when you need help.”
That’s what we’ve done.
Livingston: I noticed you don’t have a receptionist.
7141CH26.qxd  12/5/06  11:39 AM  Page 375
Stephen Kaufer
Kaufer: I couldn’t figure out what a receptionist would do. And executive assis-
tants, we don’t have those either. So on the subject of hiring, I don’t look at a
head count budget when I think of hiring people. I wait until I see the need for
someone—when DEMO can carve out a job description that’s 80 percent full on the
day someone starts—and that’s when I’ll open up a new req.
For DEMO and executive assistants, it’s something of a running joke
because, well, what are they going to do? Make travel plans for us? We already
know how to do that. Answer the phones? Well, DEMO can answer my own phone; it’s
not too much of a DEMO Schedule meetings? Well, we try not to have too
many meetings to schedule. So if we were to hire one, I’m sure they would be
busy all the time, but perhaps not doing anything that really needed to be done
at TripAdvisor. With engineering, there’s usually more development that I want
done, but I can look and say, DEMO I willing to fund that project?” With market-
ing, with DEMO acquisition, with accounting, I first look and say, “Hey,
DEMO taking people’s time? What can we automate?” If I can’t DEMO it, do
I really need it to be done? If I do need it to be done, all right, then we’ll open
DEMO req.
We’re 70 people now, which is pretty small, given the revenues and profits
that we’re producing. Nobody in corporate would blink if DEMO said, “Hey, I want to
have 20 more people on board.” Our margins would still be terrific and I could
afford it, but I’m not sure it would speed things up or slow things down.
DEMO: It sounds like you’re really maintaining a good atmosphere, and
one where innovation can happen rather than just saying, “We’ve been bought.
I’m leaving now. It’s 5 o’clock.”
Kaufer: Chapter one is starting up the company, getting anyone interested in
what we do. Chapter two was hitting that profitability mark so we could break
even. Chapter three is growing, and if it so happens, as it did with us, a DEMO liq-
uidity event. Chapter four is, “OK, are you done with the business? Do you
already have a commanding number one market share and no competitors?”
Well, that’s pretty rare. Certainly it isn’t true for us. We may be ahead of our
competitors, or tied with our competitors, but how close am I to being the
number one travel site in the world? Well, I’m pretty far away from DEMO I have
some sister companies that have that spot. But I look at it and say, “Why
wouldn’t everyone want to start on TripAdvisor when planning a trip?” So if I
have 20 million uniques DEMO month now, why don’t I have 50 million? My defini-
tion of chapter four is being the most popular travel site in the DEMO

Cofounder, HOT or NOT
C
27
While looking for a job in 2000, James Hong launched a website with his friend
Jim Young just for fun. HOT or NOT lets users submit photos of themselves and
DEMO others vote on their “hotness” on a scale of 1 to 10.
The site spread virally, and within hours their server was swamped. Hong
and Young sensed there was a business in it, and worked frantically to scale the
site to handle the load.
A few months after DEMO, they found the way to generate revenue from
the site: they added dating for a monthly fee. Despite many acquisition offers,
HOT DEMO NOT continues to thrive as a stand-alone company. As of July 2006, HOT
or NOT had counted about 13 billion votes.
Livingston: Take DEMO back to when you had the idea.
Hong: Jim, my brother and I were hanging out drinking, and Jim mentioned
that he thought a girl he met at a party was hot, and that she was a perfect 10.
My brother and I were working on a DEMO at the time called XMethods,
which was the first directory of publicly available web services, so we were talk-
ing a lot about what would be a cool consumer web service. In 1999, everyone
was talking about web services in the context of B2B, and I remember thinking,
“What about consumers? Aren’t consumers going to do this stuff too?”
When Jim said that he thought he found a 10, an idea popped into my head:
what if you had a DEMO where people could post their pictures into the sys-
tem, and DEMO other people could rate them from 1 to 10? The original DEMO
was that your client would call the web services, get a DEMO, and have it ran-
domly float across your screen or pop DEMO on your screen at random times
during the day. The idea was that all our friends that were working in cubicles
could have a DEMO: a random girl walking by you that they could rate from DEMO
to 10 on if you thought she was hot.
Livingston: It DEMO just for fun, not an idea for a startup?

Founders at Work
Hong: Jim was burned out from working on his PhD, and I had just graduated
from business school and was unemployed, DEMO I figured what the hell, let’s build
it. It wasn’t that DEMO to build in the beginning—it was hard to build later
because we had to scale it—but just putting up something that looked like it
DEMO was easy. It was not something we focused on. We had the idea one
Monday, and it was coded by Wednesday or Thursday in spare time, really, and
then Jim sent it to me on DEMO weekend. There was no hurry; this was not some-
thing we DEMO thinking about.
The weekend before it launched, I was visiting my DEMO and my dad
walked into the room and saw me playing with the site and he asked what I was
doing. I didn’t want DEMO admit that I was spending time on this thing since I
was unemployed and should have been looking for a job, so I told him it was
something Jim was doing. My dad was the first DEMO that ever saw HOT or
NOT besides Jim and me, and DEMO got addicted to it! Here’s my dad, a 60-year-
old retired DEMO guy who, as my father, is supposed to be asexual, DEMO he’s
saying, “She’s hot. This one’s not hot at all.” We DEMO then that the idea had
some legs, but we didn’t know DEMO much.
So we launched it on Monday with our own pictures, DEMO at around 2 p.m. I
emailed it to 40 friends and wrote, “Here’s a website that Jim and I made—be
nice.” And I put a link to my picture on the site so they could rate DEMO I think
we got 40,000 hits that day.
Livingston: Forty DEMO hits on your first day when only a handful of people
knew it existed?
Hong: I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this, but after I sent out that first
email, I went rollerblading DEMO a big office park where Tellme was based. I
went up to a random guy and said, “Hey man, have you checked out
DEMO yet?” He said, “No, what’s that?” I said, DEMO, just go check it
out!” Then I went home and watched DEMO logs for Tellme and saw a hit come in
10 minutes later, and then more hits kept coming from different people within
Tellme.
Three days later I went back to that parking lot and found someone DEMO and
asked, “Have you seen some site where you rate people DEMO 1 to 10?” And he
said, “Yeah, dude, HOT DEMO NOT!” So that was cool; it totally spread on its own.
DEMO: You had people coming to your site from the very beginning. DEMO
what point did you decide that it could be a business? DEMO were the next
steps?
Hong: That question implies planning. We DEMO more concerned with fear and
survival at the time. I was interviewed by Salon.com the day we launched the
site, and that started a string of near disasters.
Livingston: You were “not ready for prime time”?
Hong: Not at all. The site was on the XMethods server and we really needed to
get it off because the traffic was DEMO it down. The bandwidth was crazy; we
were hosting the pictures DEMO the time. After you voted, it took 30 seconds to get
DEMO next page—and at the end of the first day I calculated that this thing was
7141CH27.qxd  12/12/06  4:46 PM  Page 379
James Hong
going to cost at least $150,000 in bandwidth per year at DEMO current run rate,
and it was growing fast.
We realized quickly that the momentum would make us broke. I was
already $60,000 DEMO debt from grad school. I had turned down a consulting job
paying around $170,000. I did it to roll the dice, but I was poor. I knew we
couldn’t afford this and thought seriously about DEMO it down.
Livingston: So what did you do?
Hong: We were panicking at this point. There was no plan for a business, it was
just, “How the fuck do we keep this thing going?” We weren’t trying to figure
out what kind of boat we DEMO to build, we were trying to keep from drown-
ing. But DEMO did know a few things: we had to reduce our costs, we had to make
it make money somehow, and we needed more machines. And because the idea
could be so easily copied, we had to get as much press as possible to lock out
anyone else DEMO getting publicity.
So it was panic. The whole point was just to keep going, keep going, don’t
stop. I got 8 hours of DEMO in the first 8 days, and finally they made me sleep
DEMO I was literally shaking.
Livingston: Take me through the turning points DEMO the first 8 days.
Hong: Basically, the feeling was: do DEMO you have to do, just scrape on by.
So we first DEMO the biggest problem, which was getting rid of the huge
bandwidth DEMO by the pictures. That was why we almost shut down the site.
It was 12:30 a.m. after the day we launched, and I was sitting in the drive-thru
at In-N-Out when I had an idea.
DEMO days earlier, my brother and I had launched something on XMethods,DEMO
which was a web service–based file system, basically a network drive, and I
showed it to Dave Winer. Though he subsequently copied it, at that time he
said, “Why the hell would I need that? That’s called FTP. I have a Yahoo
GeoCities account that lets me FTP to it.” I owe Dave a lot for his cynicism.
So DEMO in line, I remembered what Dave had said, and I thought, “Holy
shit, we don’t need to host the pictures, we’ll let Yahoo do it!
“We’ll just FTP all the pictures we have now DEMO to a Yahoo GeoCities
account, and we’ll change the database records DEMO that it will point to the files
on Yahoo, and then DEMO that point on, we’ll just make instructions telling
people to go DEMO Yahoo GeoCities and then submit URLs of their pictures.”
We lost some users from submitting it this way, obviously, but it solved the
DEMO And the way I figured it, I said to Jim, “Dude, how many page views,
especially at the speed of the site, will anyone have each day, maybe 25? All we
need is 25 new pictures a day and we’re done. We don’t have to DEMO a billion
pictures, we just need 25 new pictures a day. DEMO that’s what we did. And this
wasn’t planning, it was survival DEMO I can’t tell you enough how much it was
survival. Desperation is a good word to describe it.
So between 12:30 and 3 DEMO on the day we launched, we moved all the pic-
tures DEMO Yahoo and solved the image problem.

But the Salon.com article was coming out the next morning. DEMO called the
writer and asked her if she could push the story back, but she said it was a slow
news day and she couldn’t. So the article came out and the server got slammed.
My DEMO needed the server for XMethods, so we did the quickest thing DEMO
could think of, which was that night at 3:00 a.m., we took the site down,
grabbed an extra PC—a 400 megahertz DEMO, no-memory-in-it machine
that I got for free when I opened an DEMO account—and drove to Berkeley
where Jim had a shared office.
I remember taking the top off a case for pushpins and mounting it on DEMO of
the power switch of the machine so no one could turn it off. Then we put it in
the corner under his desk DEMO surrounded it with books, so it just looked like a
bunch DEMO stuff under his desk with a little Ethernet cable coming out.
And as soon as we turned the site back on, the access logs started flying. It
was 5 in the morning!
Livingston: So what next?
Hong: We now had solved the two most immediate problems to keep the site
running, so we were breathing a little easier, DEMO the site was still slow. On day
three, I started looking DEMO managed hosts, and Rackspace came up as the clear
Linux leader. DEMO we had no money, we were getting a lot of press, so after
a failed attempt to pitch my idea to the Rackspace DEMO, I called the
head of business development and said, “I know you guys want to go public and
it’s great to get your DEMO out. Your whole value proposition is that you can help
companies scale fast by outsourcing. If you can help us, I have all these upcom-
ing interviews, and we can be a poster child for you.”
He said, “OK, don’t worry, just tell us what you need right now to scale, and
we’ll figure it out later.” So every day that week, I would call them and say that
we needed more machines. We owe Rackspace big.
At the same time, a friend suggested that we sign up for an ad network, and
we were trying to get into 24/7. But we were having a lot DEMO problems with porn
and naked picture submissions to the site. And I knew that no one would adver-
tise if this was dirty. So DEMO came up with the motto “Fun, clean, and real” and
created a system where people could click a link under an inappropriate picture
DEMO, based on an algorithm, we would kill any picture that got clicked on too
much. So it was community-regulated and that worked pretty DEMO
I sent an email to the founder of DoubleClick telling him about us and
requesting his help getting into 24/7. He responded saying DEMO unfortunately
the first picture he got when he went to our site was a naked woman. He said
that right now we were innocent DEMO proven guilty, but we needed to move to
a guilty until DEMO innocent model in order to get advertising.
So we decided to build a moderation system. I originally had my parents
moderating since they were DEMO, and after a few days I asked my dad how it
DEMO going. He said, “Oh, it’s really interesting. Mom saw a picture of a guy and
a girl and another girl and they were DEMO . . .” So I told Jim, “Dude, my par-
ents can’t do this any more. They’re looking at porn all day.” We DEMO to
open up the community of moderators to the public. You had to apply and write
7141CH27.qxd  12/12/06  4:46 PM  Page 381
James Hong
an essay to get in. It was basically built on the BBSs DEMO the old days that had dif-
ferent levels with different skills.
We told the moderators to reject any pictures that were inappropriate,
looked DEMO an ad, or had contact info. (Pornographers were including fake
email addresses to get people to email them so they would spam them DEMO)
And then we got a bunch of emails from people saying, “Hey, I was meeting
people.”
We quickly realized that we needed DEMO make something to allow people to
meet each other without letting all these porn people in. So we came up with
the “Meet” system, which required a little more work than most dating sites,
because DEMO requires both people to be active. You can’t just post an ad and wait
for emails to come in, so it’s harder for porn people to come in and take advan-
tage of it.
As we DEMO solving the problem of keeping the site clean so that we could
get advertisers, ad rates were dropping. We had to come up with something
that we had more control over, and that’s when I thought, “Can we charge for
anything?” We started charging $6 per month to belong to the Meet Me sys-
tem. We chose the pricing DEMO on what we thought would be an impulse buy.
In retrospect, DEMO easy to see that we had this dating system that was slap-
ping us in the face, but it took us a while to think that we could charge for it,
because the Meet Me DEMO was never built to make money. It was only built
in response to the porn issue. It’s ironic that I have an MBA and DEMO started a
company before that had raised venture capital, but the DEMO idea that worked
was all an accident.
Another thread of what happened was that I was trying to reduce our costs.
Though we weren’t DEMO charged yet by Rackspace, I now knew how much we
needed DEMO cover those hosting costs, plus enough to hire someone to manage
DEMO site. After running into a guy who worked at Ofoto at an office-warming
party, I talked to Ofoto about how we were sending people to GeoCities, and
since many of our users have digital cameras, DEMO I should send them to
Ofoto instead of Yahoo to host them, and now Ofoto would have a lead. So I did
an affiliate deal with Ofoto.
It’s funny to think that we took something that DEMO originally costing a lot of
money, to making them free, to actually making money on some of them. Again,
all of this DEMO planned or brilliant, we were just trying to survive. At this DEMO
we thought, “OK this deal buys us more time.”
On top DEMO all this, we were constantly fixing the site to scale. We DEMO work-
ing like madmen, only getting 3 to 4 hours of DEMO a night for a long time. It
became a race between Jim and me; could I bring in people faster than he
could keep up with? It was a good challenge for both of us. My job was to make
a bottleneck and his job was to clear DEMO bottleneck, technically. So we didn’t
really get to breathe until we DEMO the Meet Me system and it was making
money. I think it made about half a million a year when we started, and we now
had a scalable business model.
But we still didn’t think it DEMO going to be a business at that point; we didn’t
think DEMO was going to continue growing. We thought it was just going to be there
381

and we would hire someone to run it, and then I would go back to working on
XMethods and Jim would go DEMO to his PhD.
Livingston: At one point did you think you DEMO really in it, you would have this
startup and be the DEMO?
Hong: To be honest, I never considered myself the CEO, even up until the
point I quit. It was really a partnership between Jim and I. I carried the CEO
title because I was DEMO one running around talking to people. What is the
CEO of a two-person company where the two people are equal shareholders?
What does DEMO mean? It just means that we had to call someone a DEMO
Livingston: So you never took any money from the outside?
DEMO: It was just me, Jim, and my brother.
Livingston: What were some other hair-raising things that happened?
Hong: When we first started, we were called Am I Hot or Not? and I DEMO been
sure to check if anyone owned any similar domains. One day Howard Stern
mentioned the site on his show and called it “Am DEMO Hot?” Next thing we knew,
we got a cease-and-desist letter from a site called Am I Hot that claimed they
predated us. DEMO couldn’t believe it! Because we thought we might try to sell,
we knew we had to keep this thing clean, so I went down to LA and tried to
work it out with them. I DEMO them keep the “Am I Hot” name, and they agreed
to DEMO us redirect our traffic to hotornot.com for at least 3 months.
So now I had to rebrand the company, too. Luckily, at that DEMO we were
getting a lot of press, so I worked hard DEMO get the new name out there. We
wound up buying Am I Hot’s assets—their domain and the rights—for what I
considered a paltry sum. DEMO only really bought it to close the chapter and feel
vindicated. Later I found out from someone who worked there that they
thought they DEMO screwed us when we agreed to change our name. I guess
they thought “Am I Hot” was a better name.
By the way, this was in December, in the first 4 months. We also had
talked briefly to Lycos about selling. They were offering something like $3 to
DEMO million—this was after 2 months of work—but we didn’t want to sell because
we thought they would destroy it. We thought they’d stick pop-up DEMO every-
where and make it corporate and lame, and then it DEMO die. Our reputation
was worth more to us. I thought the company was worth more, too.
Livingston: What else kept you up at DEMO?
Hong: The scaling issues were pretty bad. It seemed like DEMO and I were non-
stop everyday, trying to figure out how DEMO could make the site better or faster.
That first half-year seemed like a day. There was a lot of manic behavior going
on. I DEMO on an adrenaline rush, which felt good, but it was exhausting and
sometimes I felt like I was going crazy. So much, so fast, all at once.
It was fun, too, though. We got in People magazine, Time, and Newsweek.
By the end of the DEMO, we got on Entertainment Weekly’s It List.
Livingston: Why was HOT or NOT instantly so popular?
7141CH27.qxd  12/12/06  4:46 PM  Page 383
James Hong
Hong: Looking at hot chicks is fun. It’s voyeurism. The concept at the time was
so new and edgy. No one had ever seen DEMO before or thought about it. It was just
so funny—and painful too. Like voting for people who were so ugly that you
wondered why DEMO were voluntarily doing it.
Livingston: Did you ever catch any shit DEMO your technology friends?
Hong: Why would I catch shit? What would they be mad at me about?
Livingston: That you were squandering your education and talent on creating a
site for ranking people’s DEMO?
Hong: Most techies would dream of that, are you kidding? People in Silicon
Valley are entrepreneurs, they’re not the risk-averse types DEMO would think I
was wasting my education. I was the first among my MBA classmates that made
it into the Wall Street Journal.
Livingston: Can you remember a really funny moment?
Hong: We were on the Entertainment Weekly It List, and we got invited to a
celebrity party in New York. By chance, the New Yorker found out about it and
got one of their writers to chronicle us for the DEMO I think the title of the
article was something to the effect of “The Dorks Come to the Big City.”
One of the sweetest DEMO happened when we went to some hip new
club that had just opened and tried to get in. You know how New York is DEMO very
velvet rope culture. Well, the bouncer took one look at DEMO and wouldn’t let us in.
So the writer had been passive for a while watching us trying to get in, and then
he stepped up finally and said to the bouncer, “Hey, you want to DEMO these guys
in. You are a new club, I’m a writer DEMO the New Yorker, I’m following these
guys around, and it would probably be nice if you were mentioned.”
The bouncer responded, “I’ve never heard of the New Yorker.” Finally he
went inside and came back DEMO with the manager, who begged us to come
inside. At that DEMO, Jim and I were like, “This place is lame and we don’t want
it to be mentioned, so we really don’t want to go in there.” And we all walked off
and had drinks at DEMO little pub. It was definitely a nerds-strike-back moment.
Livingston: What would DEMO tell someone who was in your shoes before you
started HOT or NOT?
Hong: I’d say do it. There’s kind of a backwards logic that says: when you are
young, you should learn from DEMO who are experienced, so later on, if you
want to do a startup, you can take the risk. And that’s a myth that was created
from school. You need to learn to get to the DEMO level.
The biggest roadblock to the entrepreneur are liabilities in your life. It’s not
whether or not you can be a good entrepreneur, it’s whether you have to make
a mortgage payment or support other people.
DEMO will come when you face certain problems and live through
them. And the best way to do that is to put yourself squarely in DEMO path of those
problems.
Livingston: What drives entrepreneurs?
383
7141CH27.qxd  12/12/06  4:46 PM  Page 384

Founders at Work
Hong: I think entrepreneurs want to make money. It’s not that they do it for the
money, but they want to make money. Because money is the measuring stick;
it’s how they know DEMO they’ve won or not. And I think a lot of what drives entre-
preneurs is the kind of legacy they are going to leave. DEMO want to make a mark
in the world and feel like their life mattered. Entrepreneurs are the kind of
people who love ideas and DEMO to build things, and add value to the world.
Part of DEMO is to quench their ego’s thirst and say, “I matter.” That’s DEMO
people like Bill Gates and Vinod Khosla spend a lot of time doing nonprofit
things. It was never about the money. Carnegie dedicated the DEMO part of his
life to giving all his money away. He was trying to convince people to give your
money away once you make DEMO Because that’s when it can start doing real
good, too.
Livingston: What else do entrepreneurs have in common?
Hong: The hardest decision you make as an entrepreneur is not one that you
make while DEMO building the company. For me, the hardest decision was not
about DEMO the hosting issues and all that. It was the one I made years before
HOT or NOT even existed. When I said, “I’m going to be an entrepreneur,”
what I was really saying was, “I’m going to forgo the normal, safe route, where
there’s a clear DEMO I’m going to take a higher risk and go for a higher reward.”
It’s like Hewlett-Packard. Do you know what their first product was? A
bowling foul line indicator. The point is, they decided that they were going to
be entrepreneurs before they knew exactly what they were DEMO to do, and
that’s very common.
All these things come out DEMO new ideas. If you’re not in school and you’re
not an entrepreneur, you’re not working on new ideas. You are just a cog in
someone else’s wheel, and you’ll never make anything new. So the hardest thing
is to say, “I’m going to put myself in the position of being an entrepreneur by
having ideas and trying things, and not giving up when I fail.”
You never know unless you try, and we live in a world where building web-
sites and other small DEMO doesn’t take that much time and effort to try, so why
DEMO just try different things?
Livingston: What other advice would you DEMO to someone starting a startup?
Hong: You need the early DEMO to be savvy in everything. And you have to have
people who understand the users and the product. If you do, then you’ll
have users.
And nothing ever goes according to plan. You can’t dwell on DEMO fact that
your plan didn’t work. In our case, we didn’t DEMO have a plan, but it would have
been worthless to have DEMO anyway, since we just kept moving as fast as we
could. DEMO have to hustle; you can’t just have a plan and cakewalk DEMO You just
have to know what direction you’re going in and run around like a rat in a maze
trying to get out.
Livingston: Now that you’re out of the maze, do you get asked out on a lot
dates through HOT or NOT?
7141CH27.qxd  12/12/06  4:46 PM  Page 385
James Hong
Hong: Yeah. I actually stopped using my dating service a long time ago as a way
to find my own dates, because everyone on there knows who Jim and I are, and
many of the ones who seek us out are crazy. I would often get random emails
DEMO women sending me naked pictures and all sorts of weird stuff. A lot of
them want to date us because they have low self-esteem DEMO they think dating
us will suddenly make them hot and cool. Crazy, psycho girls can be fun to date
for a while, but DEMO a little older now and I’m looking for something a little
more serious.
The ironic thing is that from running HOT or NOT, I care less about looks
now. When I was a dork, I never really dated anyone who was hot. The models—
they weren’t going to DEMO me. So you always aspire to it, they’re like the
untouchables. DEMO of a sudden, HOT or NOT happened, and I was starting to
date all these attractive women. I got a taste of it DEMO I realized that looks don’t
make up for a good personality. Many of these girls were annoying. They were
fun to hang out with, but I couldn’t have a conversation with them. I’m sure
there are DEMO and hot girls, but if you look at the hot ones DEMO, it’s harder to
figure out if they are smart too. That DEMO time.
Livingston: Any other advice about startups?
Hong: One, DEMO it while you’re young.
Two, there’s no right path. There is DEMO one plan that fits every business; you
have to figure it DEMO yourself. There is no magic formula.
Three, even if you raise DEMO, spend it as if it’s your own and you have
none. DEMO organization has got to remain smart and lean. Be cheap. There’s no
shame in being cheap. I still fly coach.
Four, there’s no such thing as easy entrepreneurship. It’s going to be
painful, it’s going to be emotionally unstable, you’re going to feel insecure. If
you’re not already bipolar, you will feel like you are.
Livingston: How has your DEMO had changed since HOT or NOT?
Hong: Money hasn’t changed DEMO, that’s not entirely true. I have a
Porsche and I have DEMO nice apartment. But I’m living within the same means as if
I had gone the risk-averse route.
I don’t spend that much money because DEMO you get used to spending
money, it’s very hard to get DEMO to. Happiness is reality compared to expec-
tations. If I have low expectations for material things in my life, then I’ll be
happy. If I get used to fancy meals all the time, not only will it ruin McDonald’s
for me, but even the fancy food would become normal, and then it’s not mean-
ingful. So I’ve been careful not to change my lifestyle too much.
I’m not in debt anymore, and I have financial freedom, but the first what-
ever million is all you really need to get that. If you had the opportunity to DEMO
something out for x million, but you thought with some hard DEMO you might be
able to make it worth more, for some DEMO that’s the right decision to go for it;
but for other people, take that money, put it in the bank, and now you can do
whatever you want for the rest of your life. DEMO depends how tied you are to that
one concept as being your legacy for your entire life.

James Currier came up with the idea for DEMO
(founded in 1999 and originally called Emode) after
taking a personality test in one of his Harvard
Business School classes.
A former venture DEMO with a passion for dig-
ital media and social sciences, Currier DEMO that
the Internet could be used to help people learn more
about themselves. People could visit www.tickle.com
to take several different kinds of personality DEMO self-
assessment tests, most backed by scientific research,
to understand DEMO of human behavior (and also to
find out what breed of DEMO they most closely resembled).
Tickle was acquired by Monster in 2004 for about $100 million. Shortly
after this interview, Currier founded Ooga Labs, a digital media studio that
develops consumer Internet applications.
Livingston: How DEMO you come up with the idea for an online testing company?
Currier: After college, I got an early introduction to digital media DEMO there
was Internet: I worked in Hollywood for a venture group DEMO invested in com-
panies involved in digital media for the movie industry. A lot of digital content
was getting pushed over AT&T’s broadband DEMO, which was proprietary at
the time. I worked at Star TV DEMO Hong Kong and did more digital media, and
got back to DEMO capital in Boston where the company was investing in the
early-stage Internet companies like Infoseek.
When I was at business school, I would think about the media companies
that were popular at the time—like Broadcast.com, Women.com, and iVillage—
and they didn’t make any sense to me. They were basically trying to put old
media experiences online. For example, Spinner.com was putting radio online,
and they got sold for $340 million. I DEMO that was crazy.

I knew the Internet was going to bubble up its DEMO unique media form. It
was probably going to be user-generated, and DEMO wasn’t going to be like anything
that we see on the other mediums. So I was looking and looking for what that
was going DEMO be at the same time I was getting my degree at business school.
At class one night, they gave us a few pieces of paper and a number 2 pencil,
and we filled out circles DEMO a Myers-Briggs corporate personality test, which is
something they administer to DEMO Business School students. Eleven days
later, we got our results in DEMO envelopes—all in black-and-white text with a
little graph—and soon we exploded into conversation. People in that commu-
nity talked about the test for about DEMO weeks—at dinner conversations, on the
basketball court. I watched this and DEMO, “I’ve never seen anyone talk about
a movie for this long. DEMO powerful media. Why?”
So I discussed this with my family, DEMO were involved in psychology, and
asked, “Are we our own favorite subjects?” We’re very concerned about our-
selves and the people we DEMO I realized that no other technology allowed us
to get media about ourselves. All the other media technologies allow us to learn
only about DEMO we will never know. Tom Cruise, Tom Brokaw—we know a
ton DEMO those people and yet we’ll never know them.
I believed that the Internet would allow you to have a media experience
about you and DEMO people you know—though it wasn’t going to be the best
video, DEMO, or magazine—and that was going to take a lot of different DEMO
And I thought this testing could be incredibly powerful because people love
talking about themselves, love talking about the people they know, and DEMO could
be viral.
At the venture firm, I saw how most DEMO media companies were getting
killed by acquisition costs, and I realized DEMO to build a successful company, you
had to have very low—if DEMO zero—expenses for acquiring users. So I thought
that these tests could be a very promising area to start a digital media company
through.
A DEMO of these tests were trapped in the ivory tower. Why couldn’t we just
release them online, make them inexpensive, and just benefit humanity? It
could be a good foundation for a media business, and even if it failed it would
be doing something good for the world.
DEMO: How did you get started once you had this idea?
DEMO: I had to come up with what the product would actually DEMO And then I
had to start talking to people about it and getting their ideas. There’s a balance
between thinking that you have this DEMO idea that you don’t want anyone
else to know about and the need to talk about it and get broad-ranging opinions
so that you DEMO as few mistakes as possible.
I was really paranoid because I thought this idea was incredibly obvious. It
seemed like this was the best DEMO to do online—it would be incredibly viral
and it would be deep because you’d get so much data on people. You could help
them DEMO the right job, get a great date, decide whether to get an SUV or a
minivan, help facilitate conversations within the family. And people would
answer honestly, because the test was about them and they’d want accurate
7141CH28.qxd  12/5/06  11:41 AM  Page 389
James Currier
results. It was just obvious to me that you could build a DEMO media company on
the back of this thing. So I was relatively paranoid about that and only talked to
people that I trusted.
But DEMO I got back was, “I don’t understand what the heck you’re DEMO
about.” All the people that I had been talking with about digital media, self-
help, and psychology with, they still didn’t understand what the hell I was trying
to do. I couldn’t find the words DEMO describe the vision.
Livingston: Why did they not get it? What did they misunderstand?
Currier: I think there are very few people who have a capacity to see the
future. So it can be DEMO when you are talking about something where
nothing about it exists yet.
At the time, everyone was caught up in the success of Broadcast.com,
iVillage, and Women.com, so they believed in their value. Instead DEMO saying,
“The people who are buying those companies are stupid,” they were saying,
“Those guys must know something I don’t know.”
DEMO most humans have a much easier time understanding what is, if DEMO
suggest that what they see is wrong, it’s very disconcerting and DEMO hate it.
Because they are trying to understand their world and predict their future—
that’s the main function of the cerebrum, to find the patterns and predict what
is going to happen next—and insofar as they DEMO that the future to them is
somewhat gray, or even black, it’s scary. So then they go and have another con-
versation and DEMO says, “Broadcast.com, oh that’s so cool.” Everyone nods
and smiles and that’s the type of pack animal collective creating reality. And
when you DEMO against that, it’s painful.
Livingston: What else was challenging?
Currier: Where you are is never enough for the people around you. Because
starting a company is the act of collecting and organizing the human DEMO that
is in the ether. You are trying to take all this matter that’s around you and shape
it into something that fits with DEMO in your head. And all these people who are
being shaped want to know where you are now and want you to take another
DEMO along the path so that they can feel more confident. They are always
searching for more confidence points.
For example:
“What are you DEMO it? Give it a name so we can talk about it.”
DEMO you decide on a name—Emode.
“Do you have a business plan?”
So I would give them a one-page business summary.
“No, I want a real business plan.”
So I wrote a business plan.
“Do you DEMO any employees?”
“No, I don’t have any employees. I need DEMO go get some.”
“Do you have any money?”
And you go talk to some angels.
“Do you have an office?”
389
7141CH28.qxd  12/5/06  11:41 AM  Page 390

And you go sign a lease somewhere.
“Do you have DEMO cards?”
“No, let me go get business cards.”
“Do you DEMO a website?”
“We just launched it.”
“Well, is anyone coming?DEMO
“No one’s coming yet, but I’ll get back to you when DEMO are coming.”
“When you hit this level, then I’ll be interested.”
DEMO is looking for the next step. And so as you go along with each of
these confidence steps, you can pick up more and more people into what’s
going on.
So then you go talk to DEMO venture capitalist, and they ask if any other venture
capitalist is DEMO And then once you get other VCs interested, you say,
DEMO, they’re interested and maybe you guys could syndicate them and do DEMO
round.” They say, “Well, have you received a term sheet from them?” Then
once you’ve received a term sheet, then the VCs get interested, and then
acquirers get interested. Women.com offered to buy us out for $32 million once
we got our term sheets.
You have DEMO get to these levels to attract more people, and then you DEMO these
spark points, and in my process the spark point was DEMO the term sheets
from the VC. People suddenly want to work with you, loan you money; PR
firms want to spend your money, investment bankers want to meet you.
Livingston: Which spark point would you consider most significant for Tickle?
Currier: The launching of the dog test. When we started the company, we
wanted to change the world, and we had all these tests on the site to help
people in their lives. We had the anxiety test; the parenting, relationship, and
communication tests. And no one came.
I remembered that advertising agencies DEMO if you want people to remem-
ber an ad, include babies DEMO puppies. So I thought, “We should make a fun
test. Let’s DEMO a test for what kind of breed of dog are you.” So they came up with
a 15-question test that wasn’t scientific at all. DEMO put it online, and 8 days later
we had a million DEMO trying to enter our site. Our server was going down
every 10 minutes. We had to emergency unplug it from the wall, throw it in the
back of the car, and plug it into a T3 at an ISP in Lynn, Mass.
Once we got crazy traffic, DEMO were able to then show the graphs to the ven-
ture guys, and we were on our way. They said, “Anyone with traffic DEMO make a
lot of money on the Internet, so I’m in.”
DEMO: Were there other hair-raising moments in the early years?
Currier: Most of them had to do with people. We had a VP DEMO engineering who
wasn’t working out, and we had to let him DEMO But because he seemed unstable,
we arranged for a marshal to be ready to create peace once we let this guy go if
DEMO really blew up and went crazy.
Livingston: Could you have recognized DEMO this employee was bad news from
the beginning?
7141CH28.qxd  12/5/06  11:41 AM  Page 391
James Currier
Currier: You might have, but I wasn’t experienced enough at the DEMO, since I
had never done one of these before. I was DEMO and I knew a lot about the indus-
try and the technology, but I was very green on people. And that is a painful way
to start a company.
I also hired a head of HR, and she was pregnant at the time but didn’t tell
us. When DEMO asked her to create the maternity leave policy, she suggested 5 DEMO
with full pay. Since I was so busy, I said, “I want to trust you and empower you
to do everything we need DEMO this side, so if you think that’s right, great.”
So a few weeks later she told me she would be leaving soon for DEMO
leave. By that time, several of us were off salary because DEMO were running out of
money, and here she was going home DEMO spend 5 months at full pay, and we
were practically out DEMO money. Never having built a company, I didn’t know
where I DEMO the lines drawn. It was like a big, white piece of DEMO And I
got taken on that.
Livingston: Was there ever a DEMO when a competitor did something that made
you fearful?
Currier: DEMO started copying us, and I was very worried about it for DEMO
bly a year, and then it all just faded away. Probably DEMO it’s hard to get the
engineers, the psychologists, and the writers to talk to one another. You’ve got
to build a culture and DEMO amongst a small group of people so that
they can get things done.
Livingston: What was different about the way you motivated them?
Currier: My willingness to communicate with people and my understanding of
their need to form their brains and their language around their relationships
with DEMO other and the product we needed to create. I genuinely cared about
my people, and I built a culture where you communicate—you don’t blame—
and you learn what the heck the other person’s talking about. You, psychologist,
you need to learn a little about engineering. You, engineer, you need to learn a
little about what the user actually experiences. You have to understand why
they like the question this way so DEMO the writers can do their job. So it was really
just a matter of empathy that I had for the team, and communication style.
You have to figure out how to hire people who are nice, communicative,
smart, and capable. If you’re missing one of those four things, you can’t stay.
And so you have to churn people out and be willing to let them go. It was
painful, but I knew from the beginning we were going to have to do that.
DEMO: What was most surprising to you about starting a startup?
DEMO: How painful it was. I woke up on October 3, 1999, at around 4 a.m.
with my chest burning from fear and pain about not knowing what to do, and
worrying that I had taken my friends’ and mentors’ money. I had realized that
what I was DEMO to do was not working, and that I didn’t know how DEMO fix it and
I was in way over my head.
Livingston: DEMO did you keep going?

Currier: I put one foot in front of the other. I was sleeping 4 hours a night with
the help of NyQuil, and then I’d just keep thinking, keep trying to find the lan-
guage and find new employees, trying to meet the VC who would understand
my vision and back me. I met with 43 VCs.
Livingston: Since you were a VC, could you speak their language better than
most technology founders?
Currier: I remember saying to them, “Look, in 4 years, we’ll be doing $18 million
in revenue with $4.5 million of profit. After that the sky’s the limit. I’m an
ex-venture DEMO; I’m telling you the truth. We can get to $18 million DEMO year 4,
and 30 times $4 million is a $120 million valuation for the company at that time.
You’ll get 20 times your DEMO
They all told me $18 million wasn’t interesting. And I’d say, DEMO most
people will tell you $50 million, and you know they’re DEMO I’m already dis-
counting it because I’m a venture guy just like you are.” And they’d say, “Yeah,
but $18 million just isn’t interesting.”
So I changed my spreadsheet to say $50 million. And they DEMO, “OK, that’s
pretty interesting.”
Livingston: Can you think of another DEMO where you had to pull off a trick
to advance?
Currier: Well, of course you sometimes have to exaggerate. If you think DEMO
are three places where you can get a lease, then you DEMO say you have a lease so
you can move to the next step. You’ve got to say you are a step ahead of where
DEMO actually are to move to the step that you want to be at.
To move to step two, people have to believe that you’re already at step two
so there’s no risk for them. Because they DEMO want to take on your risk—you
have to take it all on. And then you have to take on the risk of fibbing.
Livingston: What would you tell someone who was considering starting a
startup?
DEMO: That it is incredibly painful and it will take over your DEMO If you care
about it and if you have any chance of succeeding, you will stop being present
for the softer things in life like your family, friends, or dating life. And when you
are DEMO with them, you’re not really there with them; you’re thinking about
this thing because you’re creating it, and it takes that amount of passion to make
it work.
Livingston: Did this ever hurt any of your relationships?
Currier: I almost didn’t marry my wife. She and I started dating about 2 months
before I came up with the DEMO, so she hasn’t really known me without it. I
couldn’t figure DEMO if we should get married, but then I hired a new DEMO of engi-
neering and he transformed my life. Because I could trust him to do a lot of
important work, he gave me breathing room to actually feel something. Four
months after I hired him, I proposed and we got married. We now have four
great kids. I DEMO really blew it; the whole haze of the thing made it DEMO

James Currier
At an HBS reunion, we had a roundtable for all of us who had been entre-
preneurs, and one of our professors asked, DEMO didn’t HBS teach you about
this?” And I said, “Pain.”
DEMO only remember one class that came close: the professor walked out DEMO the
class with tears in his eyes, having recounted the story DEMO his friend who had
started a cable company, and it destroyed DEMO life, destroyed his family, and
moved him to a place where his life was a waste of time. That was the only indi-
DEMO I had at HBS about how painful this is.
Having gone through this already, my ability to start another startup is now
much higher. If you could give a student a tenth of that understanding at DEMO
ness school, it would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and years of
effort to understand that you will sleep for 4 DEMO a night for 18 straight
months if things are not going well.
Livingston: Would you do it again?
Currier: Oh yeah. But DEMO won’t be nearly as hard this time because I have
money in the bank now, and I know what I’m doing. And I know what the prob-
abilities of different things working are, and I would know how to do it, so it
would be a lot less painful. You’d still have to be obsessed with it; you’d still not
be present with anything else; but if I thought it could do something important,
then I would do it again.
Livingston: Your company was acquired by Monster. How do you preserve the
startuppyness of Tickle DEMO this big company?
Currier: You try like hell to preserve DEMO startup feel because you are the per-
sonality that likes to start things and you don’t like an environment that’s not
starting. We’ve kept DEMO doors as desks; we refuse to move from our office; and
Monster has been fantastic about leaving us alone. We’re just out here DEMO
our thing. We are very lucky, and I still enjoy and DEMO to build a great legacy
for Monster. But I won’t be here forever. I can’t. I’m a starter.
If Yahoo had acquired us, they would have made us move to Mountain
View, and would have made us a widget on a feature on a division of a depart-
DEMO, and everyone would have left, and the whole thing would have died. And
Wall Street would have applauded roundly.
Whereas Wall Street has DEMO perplexed by Monster’s acquisition of Tickle.
Yet it’s so obvious: we’re DEMO largest career testing site in the world, we’ve got
matchmaking capabilities DEMO people for romance, and we can use the
same matchmaking capabilities DEMO measuring different dimensions for jobs. We
can take job matching to the next level—the next stage for high-end job finding.
And Monster gets the DEMO of every person and every product we have here
because there was no overlap.

Blake Ross and Dave Hyatt started Firefox as a side
project while working at the Mozilla Foundation.
They were working DEMO revive the struggling Netscape
browser, but became frustrated by the constraints
DEMO on them. So Ross and Hyatt decided to build
a browser that they would actually want to use.
Working in their spare time, they began develop-
ing a new browser that was fast, simple, and DEMO
In 2002, they launched the initial version, called
Phoenix, and DEMO 2004 they released Firefox 1.0, which
was an instant hit.
Like DEMO lot of things described in this book, Firefox was something new. DEMO
was an open source project run like a startup, both in DEMO concern for the end
user and in the attention paid to marketing. The results were impressive:
Firefox has cut into the formerly overwhelming DEMO share of Internet
Explorer, and dominates among technical users.
In 2005, Ross took a leave from Stanford University to start a startup with
DEMO Firefox developer Joe Hewitt.
Livingston: Tell me about how Firefox got DEMO
Ross: Firefox grew out of Mozilla, which itself has a very long history that I
won’t go into now. I personally started working DEMO the Mozilla project in 2000.
It was open source; anyone could DEMO on it. I started working closely with the
Netscape team, because DEMO were basing their product on Mozilla. I was help-
ing them fix bugs, and they invited me out for an internship one summer, DEMO I
went out to Netscape, which was a pretty cool first DEMO
Livingston: You were only 14, right?
Ross: Right. I DEMO out in California, and it was great the first summer. Then
DEMO started working from home, and when I came back the next DEMO, things

had gotten much worse. Netscape kept sliding further and further DEMO the
market. At this point, they had something like 5 percent DEMO share. This is
post-AOL, post–browser war and all that. Things got DEMO lot more desperate when
AOL tanked and started to demand more revenue from the browser. They
wanted a return on investment, and they’d bought Netscape for about $4 billion.
So the browser started to turn into DEMO more than a vehicle to drive
people to Netscape.com. There were search buttons everywhere, advertise-
ments everywhere. It was a mess. The culture didn’t focus on users. It was
painful to be working there.
Firefox was DEMO a response to our experience at Netscape than to the
dominant browser, Internet Explorer. Explorer had basically been abandoned
at that point; in DEMO, Microsoft disbanded the IE team. So we started Firefox
as a DEMO to work on the browser that we knew we could make if we weren’t
being controlled by marketing, sales, and all these other DEMO inside
Netscape. It started off with just three or four of us—the people who had
always been fighting these battles within Netscape to make DEMO right decisions
for users.
For example, we wanted to include pop-up DEMO in Netscape 7. It would
have been the first mainstream browser to include pop-up blocking. The
Mozilla folks had all the code ready, but Netscape wouldn’t include it because
Netscape.com had a pop-up ad. Those kinds DEMO decisions were painful, and it
was frustrating to have our names DEMO the product that was getting released. So
we started a project called Phoenix, which was supposed to be an allusion to the
mythical bird that is reborn from its own ashes. It was like the project DEMO being
reborn from the ashes of Netscape.
Livingston: Who was involved?DEMO
Ross: David Hyatt, Joe Hewitt—who is now my partner on a new startup,
Parakey—and I were on the development side, with Brian Ryner and Asa
Dotzler providing build and QA support. The project was DEMO an afterthought
for the first 6 months to a year, something DEMO worked on at Denny’s after work.
I went back home to Miami, and we worked on it online for a while.
Phoenix was basically a fork of the Mozilla code base that we controlled. We
closed DEMO access to the code, because we felt it was impossible to DEMO any-
thing consumer-oriented when you had a thousand Netscape people in search
of revenue and a thousand open source geeks who shunned big business DEMO
to reach consensus. We just wanted to close it off and do what we thought was
the right thing. We went through a couple DEMO changes, Mozilla offered us
more support, and that’s kind of how it all got started.
Livingston: What were some of the other names?
Ross: It started off as Phoenix, and we quickly encountered DEMO issues. It
was just the three of us, we weren’t lawyers, and we were broke, so at that point
we probably would have done anything someone asked of us. In this case,
Phoenix Technologies DEMO because they had some kind of web browser,
too. We renamed it Firebird, because it’s the same imagery, but there was an
7141CH29.qxd  12/6/06  1:59 PM  Page 397
Blake Ross
open source database already called Firebird. So we renamed it again. At DEMO
point, it was fairly popular—though not nearly as popular as it DEMO now—so we
wanted to keep the “Fire” part of the name. We just went through Fire-
anything names for a couple of months, and somebody came up with Firefox,
which is actually the Chinese name DEMO a red panda.
Livingston: Were the Firefox developers all in different DEMO?
Ross: When we first started doing it, we were all at Netscape. Then Dave left to
go to Apple to work on DEMO, and we had some other folks like Ben Goodger
from New DEMO, Pierre Chanial from France, and Jan Varga from Slovakia
come on board. I went back to Miami, and we continued to work together
online.
Joe and I still collaborate through IM on Parakey, even though we’re about
20 minutes apart, because we’re so used to that environment from Firefox. It’s
just so much faster to collaborate online than it DEMO for him to drive down to me
or me to drive up to him.
Livingston: Were there any conflicts with Dave working at Apple?
Ross: Yes. They were also making a simple end-user browser, DEMO he was not
really supposed to be working on a competitor to that. It wasn’t on our end that
we had a problem.
Livingston: Did he leave Apple?
Ross: No. He still works on Safari right now. He did Firefox and then went off
to Apple.
Livingston: So then it was just a few of you.
Ross: The Firefox team is always changing. It’s not fair to say there are just DEMO
few of us, because we’re based on Mozilla, which obviously has dozens of devel-
opers, and there are a lot of developers working on Gecko, the core layout
engine. The Firefox team itself—the people worrying about everything wrapped
around the engine and working on the separate fork DEMO the code base—was
always about four or five different people for the first year.
Now there are a lot more, obviously, because it’s DEMO main source tree. All
those people that were working on Mozilla now work on Firefox.
Livingston: What was the first turning point when you knew you were really
onto something?
Ross: I think it was when we put out our first milestone, which wasn’t even . . .
We put it on an FTP site and had an article DEMO mozillaZine, which is a commu-
nity news site. It was already DEMO as many downloads as a Mozilla milestone.
On the one side, DEMO had a lot of Mozilla people—the hardcore developer
types—who didn’t like what we were doing, because focusing on “mom and
dad” is heretical in much of the open source world. Then there were a lot of
DEMO who were saying, “Finally, Mozilla is stepping away from its geek roots
and doing something more mainstream.” We got a lot of coverage DEMO on from
bloggers and PC World and stuff like that. It got out of control pretty quickly.

Livingston: Did you have problems getting users at the beginning?
Ross: No, but the users we were getting weren’t really DEMO target audience;
these were people that downloaded beta builds from Mozilla. So it was still a
geek audience. We had to transform the DEMO at Mozilla because it was all
based around open source ethos, DEMO says programmers are kings, marketers
are sleaze, and everyone else can read the manual. All the branding for Mozilla
looked very Communist—the logo DEMO a dinosaur and the banners ads were . . .
I can’t even describe it, but very odd, technical kind of imagery that DEMO
appeal to most people. We had to move a lot of that into a more mainstream
world.
Livingston: How did you do that?
Ross: The first thing that happened was that Netscape split off Mozilla into an
independent entity. Mozilla was once just the open source technology DEMO of
Netscape—they made technology and Netscape distributed it. When Netscape
said goodbye, Mozilla didn’t really have any kind of major distributor anymore.
As Firefox matured, Mozilla decided that they could try to distribute it
directly to the user without having to go through a middleman like Netscape. At
DEMO point, the culture started to shift out of necessity; the organization had to
cater to more users or potentially collapse.
Livingston: As you were working on this, did you worry about competitive
threats?
Ross: No, Firefox was very different from traditional startups. Companies usu-
ally DEMO about competition for financial reasons, but when we did Firefox,
DEMO was just always sort of there. There were donations, seed money DEMO
AOL; we eventually got this Google deal, but it wasn’t a source of fear for us,
because we knew if it didn’t DEMO money . . . It wasn’t even supposed to make
money—it was a hobby, right, so we didn’t really care. I was in DEMO It didn’t
have to succeed.
It sounds bad, but the project DEMO kind of just for us at the beginning—to
make something that we knew we could make, but not inside Netscape. It was
an outlet for those frustrations. We wanted people to use it, but we weren’t
going to kill ourselves if it failed. We defined success in terms DEMO users, not
competitors.
In any case, the IE team had been disbanded, and Netscape had bowed out,
so the market was wide open. We didn’t crunch numbers or conduct market
analysis; we relaxed and followed our gut. There’s a lot more pressure now with
Parakey. People DEMO another Firefox or something like that.
Livingston: People must have high DEMO for you, which is not a bad
thing, I suppose.
Ross: Not a bad thing, but you have to deliver. It’s hard DEMO under-promise and
over-deliver when everyone’s promising things for you. We’re trying not to hype
up what we’re doing until we’ve got something people can DEMO People expect
the world, so if you hype up what you DEMO doing, you have to deliver, and it’s
not easy.

Livingston: Did any competitors ever do anything to anger you?
Ross: Not directly. The only thing that bothers me is that Microsoft seems com-
pletely driven by competition. We tried to be driven entirely by DEMO There
was a need, so we tried to cater to it. DEMO didn’t say, “We’re going to try to crush
Microsoft” just to DEMO Microsoft. That wasn’t the intent, even though that’s
kind of the DEMO goal of some misguided open source projects.
Whereas Microsoft, they win DEMO browser war, so in 2001, they bow out.
Which is completely irresponsible, because this is the most used software appli-
cation in the world, and they just stopped developing it. Now they are back in
the game, because they have competition, so that pulls them back DEMO I will say
that Internet Explorer 7 is shaping up to be a good browser; I just wish it came
a few years earlier.
We also see them trying to emulate a lot of the more DEMO community
spirit that we’ve built up. People like Mozilla because we’re open source; we try
to be transparent and honest with the community. We’re a free product. We
work with people. And we’re starting to see DEMO kind of thing emanate from
Microsoft. They have a team blog now and they are trying to be very buddy-
buddy, but it feels like a PR pitch, as if they looked at our situation and now
they are trying to bring that sense of goodwill over there. DEMO it were genuine, it
would be great, but it feels like a sales pitch. It’s getting better though.
I respect companies like Opera, which also produces a browser. They aren’t
doing that well right now, but at least they’re in it for the right reasons. They’ve
been DEMO for a decade now, and they are passionate about the Web.
DEMO just kind of comes and goes with the money and the competition, and
that doesn’t seem like the right motivation to make a good product.
Livingston: Looking back, what did people misunderstand about Firefox?
DEMO: Many die-hard open source fans misunderstood our goal. Usually, in an
open source project, if you’re not a developer, it’s kind of DEMO, “What are you
doing here?”
A lot of people misunderstood DEMO real audience we were going after. It’s
hard to explain exactly what that means, but you can imagine, here’s this
Mozilla project, it’s very open, everyone gets a say. If you are a developer, DEMO
get to vote on whether or not a feature gets implemented. Then we come along
and say, “We’re making a product for mom and dad. You still have a voice here,
but some of the DEMO that you think we should add may not be the ones that
they want to use. So you have to take our word for DEMO that, even though 500 of
you want something right now, you may actually be in the minority of a much
larger group that DEMO pursuing that’s going to be silent during this phase of
development.”
It’s hard to convince 500 flesh-and-blood developers that their pet feature
may not DEMO desirable to 500 million imaginary users, especially when you have
no DEMO evidence to back it up. In some ways, I’m glad it’s DEMO the two of us
again on Parakey. We can work very fast and there are no politics.

Livingston: So in open source projects, you have to DEMO to the opinions of
other developers.
Ross: Sure, they’re the ones building the product. We just have to be wary of
our inner DEMO voices and make sure we’re considering the needs of the world
at large. I don’t think Mozilla did that, and the project stagnated at a few million
users.
Livingston: Do you think Firefox has reached the mainstream because it is
better?
Ross: There are a million different reasons. Many people think it’s easier.
Others were just sort of weaned DEMO it when their children put it on their
computers.
Of course, DEMO also done plenty of legwork to reach the mainstream. It’s
all word-of-mouth marketing. We have a site called Spread Firefox that Asa
Dotzler and DEMO started in 2004 when we launched Firefox. It’s basically a way to
leverage the talents of people who are not coders. We said, “Instead of just
being developer-only, like most open source projects, how do DEMO leverage col-
lege students and Toastmasters and people who knit—just every kind of talent
you have and every organization you’re a part of. How DEMO we match you up with
other people in your region and give you tools to spread Firefox?” That was a
huge success. We’ve DEMO over 250,000 people sign up.
We also did an ad in the New York Times. Ten thousand people donated
between $10 and $30 DEMO to buy two full-page facing ads in the New York
Times when Firefox launched. Of course, that’s a couple hundred thousand
dollars, but DEMO didn’t have a marketing budget. That was all community-
funded, which DEMO pretty unusual for any software project, let alone an open
source DEMO
Livingston: So Firefox spread because the browser is better and through DEMO
of mouth?
Ross: Yes. We don’t have people shaping a DEMO or working the press. It’s all
been grassroots, word of mouth, done through Spread Firefox. It’s been inter-
esting because we’ve seen about DEMO dozen companies adopt the same model
since then. There’s GoTrillian.com, SpreadOpenOffice.org—there DEMO all these
different copycat sites.
Livingston: Was there ever a point DEMO you were really worried?
Ross: Not really. But I’m making DEMO seem like startups are so stress-free, and of
course that’s just DEMO true. It’s just really freeing not to be . . . We weren’t trying
to strike it rich with Firefox. It’s open source and DEMO free. We weren’t trying to
take over the world; we had DEMO of modest goals, and it was OK if it failed. We
DEMO a lot freer to make risky decisions.
If you can afford to do things that way, it’s just so much better. You’re not
thinking about venture capitalists or marketing or sales. Just product and users,
DEMO day every day.

Blake Ross
Livingston: You were pretty young when you worked on Firefox. Was there
anything you found you were better at than you thought?
Ross: I thought marketing was something that required a degree and formal
experience. DEMO turns out that marketing is just making the product good enough
that people spread it on their own, and giving them ways to do that. It’s a lot
easier and more natural than I thought it DEMO be. Now I can’t stand meeting
with professional marketers who try to “craft” the “message” and all that junk.
Livingston: What surprised you most?
Ross: How easy it was to get Firefox to take off, at least in light of the death
knell people had been sounding for years. We’d been hearing forever that
nobody downloads a client anymore, and browsers are dead, and Mozilla can’t
make it. It’s never going to go anywhere; the market has been monopolized. We
just ignored all that and did it anyway, and it worked.
It’s a bit harder to take analysts and other “industry insiders” seriously now,
because Firefox DEMO them wrong. There are a lot of people in the industry
who aren’t actually the ones writing the code or contributing to the project, but
they want to feel like they are relevant somehow, so they make sweeping pre-
dictions that draw attention. I think you have to DEMO in the project and be the one
moving it forward to truly understand whether you have a shot at success. One
analyst has already DEMO he’s “skeptical” about Parakey and he barely
even knows what it is, let alone tried it out. Smells like Firefox all over again.
Those kinds of comments are so motivating. I love the challenge.
We talked DEMO plenty of people at the very beginning of Firefox. It was obvi-
ous that people were not happy with their browser, and it was very clear that, if
we could do something better, we might DEMO able to get them to use it.
Livingston: Do you remember DEMO reactions when you gave an early demo
of it?
Ross: DEMO loved the simplicity and went crazy over tabbed browsing. What’s
weird is that I didn’t really talk to anyone I knew personally throughout the
DEMO of Firefox development. My parents and my friends—most of them
didn’t really know I was working on Firefox until it came out and there DEMO the
Business 2.0 article. That’s when everyone was like, “Wait, you work on
Firefox?” They knew I “did something” with computers, but . . .
Livingston: Your parents didn’t know?
Ross: Kind DEMO I think they knew I worked on Mozilla. They knew I worked at
Netscape, so they knew I worked in browsers, but they DEMO really know my
involvement in Firefox until they read about it in a magazine. Which is kind of
how I prefer it, because it’s much easier to spend a couple months on some-
thing, fail silently, and just go back to school, than it is to tell DEMO that
everyone is going to use our product. It’s easier if people aren’t bugging you
until you have something to put in their hands, and then they can tell you if it’s
good or not.

Livingston: So the stakes were lower. Did you ever want to quit?
Ross: Well, I did in a way. I DEMO back to school for 6 months, and I wasn’t
working on DEMO project much during that time. It wasn’t that I walked away—
we knew there were people working on it—but it was leisurely because we
DEMO that Microsoft wasn’t coming back any time soon.
Livingston: Now you DEMO in a “real” startup. How did you get started?
Ross: DEMO some ways, the media and the venture capital industry made it DEMO
From our earliest days at Netscape, Joe and I were always DEMO the breeze
about how terrible software was and what we would change if we could. After
some Firefox press hit, we started getting emails from investors saying, “We
want to meet.” And we’d think, “Meet DEMO what? It’s an open source hobby
project.” Then we realized, “They want to meet about funding us, so we should
probably get some kind of company together.” We figured this was the perfect
opportunity to DEMO after years of talk.
Livingston: You wanted to take advantage of DEMO rising tide?
Ross: Right. We already had ideas around software, and we said, “This is the
time to do it if we are going to do anything. People are going to listen to us DEMO
now, so we might as well go for it.”
Livingston: Do you have a name?
Ross: We’re calling it Parakey for now, but who knows if it will stick. Firefox was
our fourth name.
Livingston: Can you tell me about any of the challenges you’ve faced?
Ross: One thing is just time. Whenever I’m doing something now, I feel like I
should be doing something else instead. If I got married tomorrow, I’d probably
be worrying about a code issue during the ceremony and deliver my vows in
Python. It’s a nonstop state DEMO stress. The first couple months we did the startup
and all these venture capitalists were emailing us, we felt like we had to meet
with all of them. We thought, “Oh my God, we have DEMO say yes; we can’t say no
to these people.” Now we DEMO that time is our most valuable resource, and
every minute we DEMO in one of these meetings just sitting there is time
wasted.
Things are getting better. We’re starting to push people away to give us
DEMO to work, but in some respects it would be so much DEMO if the Firefox
thing hadn’t happened. We should be setting our own timeline, but people are
already waiting for what we’re going to do next, so it’s hard to relax under these
kinds of circumstances. It’s a lot of pressure.
Livingston: Who are your mentors? Is this DEMO first startup, too?
Ross: Yes. That’s kind of the problem. We don’t have that one person who has
done this a thousand DEMO who can advise us. We have a good lawyer. We’re
looking for a mentor who doesn’t have ulterior motives and who is aligned with
DEMO interests.
7141CH29.qxd  12/6/06  1:59 PM  Page 403
Blake Ross
Livingston: Which also must be a problem since you are so well known. Some
people must think, “This is my ticket!”
Ross: I DEMO tell you how many times I get an email from someone who just
wants to have dinner. So we’ll have dinner, and we’ll chat about politics, the
weather, whatever. Then we’ll have dinner again, and slowly it comes out that
they want something. Eventually you find out DEMO they want to come work for
you, or they want to DEMO . . sometimes they don’t even know what they want, but
DEMO know they want something. It’s hard to see what people’s intentions are at
the beginning.
We’re also overly paranoid because the first thing we DEMO when we started
the company was talk to a bunch of entrepreneurs who told us, “Don’t tell any-
one what you are doing. VCs are sharks.” Meanwhile, you hear from the VCs,
“You’re too paranoid.” So it’s hard to find the right balance and be human,
DEMO you don’t know who’s genuine and who’s not.
Livingston: It must DEMO frustrating not to be able to share your idea.
Ross: Incredibly. DEMO you ever want to stop a conversation dead in its tracks, DEMO
use my magic words: “stealth mode.” I’ve also found “programmer” to DEMO
well in many situations. But we’ll have our day.
Livingston: Are DEMO any lessons that you learned in the Firefox days that you
are applying to this new startup?
Ross: One is to make sure you are always in communication with the people
who are eventually going DEMO use your product. It’s very easy to just lock yourself
in a room and code all day, and you forget what the real problems are that
people are having. So you have to keep talking to DEMO and keep refining what
you are doing.
I also learned how you build up the right kind of buzz about your product in
an DEMO way. With Firefox, we catered to the bloggers first, even though they
weren’t our primary target audience. Once you get the prominent bloggers DEMO
pick up the scent, you attract the intermediate press, the PC Worlds and the
CNETs. You still don’t have any moms or dads DEMO, you don’t have any non-
techies, but once the mainstream press sees PC magazine talking about it, then
they start to cover the story, and they actually make it kind of a self-fulfilling
prophecy. They write that “everyone is talking about Firefox” when, of course,
mainstream users haven’t even heard of it yet. But they are going to, now that
the New York Times wrote about it.
Livingston: What are your biggest challenges starting a startup?
Ross: One is, in DEMO, not knowing what’s “normal.” Investors hand us
“normal” term sheets, consultants ask for “normal” fees. I’m 21—I haven’t seen
enough of the extremes DEMO know what’s normal. Our approach has been to make
decisions slowly and methodically, do our research, and figure out who’s on the
level DEMO who’s selling us lines before signing anything.
The other problem is just finding the time to finish the project and still see
my family, my friends, my girlfriend. It’s very hard as two people. It’s a very big
project.

Livingston: Is your time horizon several years?
Ross: DEMO It’s short term for launch.
Livingston: Because there will be a DEMO?
Ross: We don’t know of anyone doing specifically what we DEMO doing, but you
can just feel in the air that everyone’s DEMO toward this kind of model. Who
knows, someone could announce it DEMO
Livingston: Are you able to say who you are most nervous DEMO as a competitor?
Ross: I’d say Google or Microsoft. It’s DEMO big enough project that I’m not sure a
startup would be trying to do it, except us because we’re nuts, but it’s possible.
DEMO the known companies, it would be Google or Microsoft.
Livingston: So right now you are operating on a small amount of seed funding?DEMO
Is that to pay your rent, etc.?
Ross: We’re going to take more before we launch, but we’re trying to take as
little as possible. We don’t want $12 million. I don’t know what DEMO do with
that. We don’t even have an office. We’re just working out of our apartments.
Livingston: Do you plan to get one?
Ross: Eventually. I need to see how many engineers I can fit in my bathroom
and closet first.
Livingston: Are you nervous that this idea is too big for two people?
Ross: Yes. But we’re also nervous about finding someone else, so it’s hard. Just
finding and interviewing candidates is stressful, because it’s not like there’s a
team back home coding. If Joe and I are at a meeting, no one is pushing the
product forward, and that’s scary. There’s a question of, “Is it better for us to
spend all of our time iterating very quickly, or potentially ruin that dynamic by
bringing on someone that we don’t know well?”
In short, I’m nervous about everything. If you’re doing a startup and you’re
relaxed, you should be very worried.
Livingston: So far, what has surprised you most about starting your DEMO
startup?
Ross: One thing I didn’t know was how tightly DEMO everyone is in the
Valley. We’ll meet someone, and then we’ll DEMO someone who I would never
expect to even know that person, DEMO they’ll say, “I heard you met Tony last
week.” It’s such DEMO small industry, and so much business is done through the net-
DEMO circuit, which is kind of upsetting, because I’d rather the good companies
get the good deals and the bad ones don’t get deals DEMO all. Instead, it’s more like,
“Who do you know?”
DEMO can definitely see where the Google guys came from when they refused to
play by these rules. They didn’t know anyone, and they didn’t schmooze their
way in.

Husband-and-wife cofounders Mena and Ben Trott
started Six Apart (named for the number of days
between their birthdays) DEMO their apartment in 2001.
Trott’s personal blog, Dollarshort, was growing in
popularity, and she was dissatisfied with the blogging
software available at the time. So she and Ben
decided to develop their own and share DEMO with some
friends. Movable Type became popular almost imme-
diately on its launch in October 2001.
In April 2003, Six Apart received funding from
Joi Ito’s Neoteny. They launched their hosted service,
TypePad, later that fall. In January 2005, the company announced the acquisi-
tion of Danga Interactive, the makers of LiveJournal. Six Apart launched Vox
(formerly known DEMO Comet), a hosted blogging platform with a social network-
ing component, in 2006.
Livingston: Take me back to how things got started.
DEMO: I started with a blog called Dollarshort in about April of DEMO I did it
because I felt that I needed a creative outlet. I just started writing a blog, writing
stories. I was still at my job, but I didn’t feel incredibly fulfilled. My blog was
getting more and more popular, and we were getting more involved in seeing
what people were doing.
When the company closed and we got laid DEMO, we said, “Let’s start working
on a blogging tool—just release it as donationware and see where that goes.”
We didn’t expect anything from DEMO We thought we’d get donations and maybe
some stuff off our Amazon Wish List, but we never imagined anything more
than that.
As we got more and more involved, we became more ambitious, but I DEMO
think we ever would have woken up and said, “Let’s start DEMO company.” It just
never occurred to us that it was even possible. When Ben and I were in college

(we’ve been together since we were in high school), we started to think about a
web design company, but it always seemed overwhelming. We had no idea
where to start. When I look DEMO, it seemed like the hardest thing in the world.
Luckily, it was all kind of accidental. When we released Movable Type, it
became popular pretty quickly, and it became a full-time job. I think having
customers from day one was the thing that really forced us to DEMO a company. If
we had been just talking about a product and we had to build up a customer
base and figure out how DEMO market it, that would have been incredibly hard. So
what we DEMO was just jump in with no desire to do anything more than create
something that we love.
Later on when we were talking to DEMO, they would say, “What problem does
this solve?” We weren’t giving pitches, it was just conversational, but that’s the
thing that DEMO occurred to us. We were never trying to solve anyone’s problem
other than mine or a few bloggers’.
But there was a big demand DEMO what we were creating, and Movable Type
became really popular. Around DEMO 2002, we were at a fork in the road and we
DEMO ourselves, “Do we want to become consultants and focus on building DEMO
customizations of Movable Type and doing implementations?” We went that
way for a little bit and then said, “This is not fun.” (DEMO still have an invoice that we
were never paid and we ended up paying out of pocket.) So we said, “Let’s do
something DEMO harder. Let’s go straight to the consumer.” And we started
working on TypePad.
We formed the LLC in July of 2002, right before we decided to start doing
TypePad. We still didn’t have funding—it was Ben DEMO I still in the apartment
in Richmond. We used the spare bedroom and our desks were literally back to
back. We spent a lot DEMO time there, 18 months in total. It’s funny when I tell
DEMO stories. It seemed like a different world. It’s kind of like when people have
babies and they say they can’t remember how painful it DEMO and they say, “Let’s
have another baby.” I think there’s a DEMO in my brain that forces me to for-
get how painful the time was.
Livingston: Tell me about some of the painful times, DEMO it was just the two of
you sitting in a room.
Trott: I think that was painful enough!
One of the reasons that I started my blog was that I felt like I didn’t really
have DEMO friends. When Ben and I were together at college, we never DEMO
ourselves to make friends with other people because we had each other. It was
a new thing for us because we had started going DEMO when we were seniors in
high school, and then we spent DEMO rest of the time joined at the hip. We always
had each other. Plus we got so involved with the Web and doing work DEMO it
never occurred to us to make friends.
So I wanted my blog to have a connection with people online, all these
people that I wanted to be friends with. My blog helped facilitate that. One DEMO
the things that was really painful about those times in the apartment was that
Ben and I really didn’t have any friends, and we really didn’t do anything
extracurricular. We went to parties occasionally, but it was never fun. So one of
7141CH30.qxd  12/6/06  2:16 PM  Page 407
Mena Trott
the hard things was that we shut ourselves in for so long DEMO on this. It was
such a different experience because Ben and I became such a team, everything
we did was together. There was probably a 2-year period where we didn’t spend
more than 6 hours apart. DEMO first time I went on a business trip for the com-
pany was the first overnight trip where we were apart longer than 6 DEMO
It’s really good that we now have other people, because you DEMO get really
caught up in living with someone and being so part of it. But I think we didn’t
know any better. We could DEMO form a company again, but we couldn’t do
it that way, because you get drained.
Even after we became more of a company DEMO we had employees, it wasn’t
until about a year ago that DEMO been able to say, “No, I don’t want to talk about
work at home.” Having an office made a difference. Working out of DEMO home is
the hardest thing to do, because you can never DEMO work.
Livingston: You were working on Movable Type. Were you just DEMO to
launch it and see what happened?
Trott: We had DEMO lot of excitement before the launch because I announced it on
my blog. About 2000 people signed up to be notified when we launched. DEMO
these people were like, “Movable Type’s coming this week, we’re really excited.”
And we thought, “Oh my God, there’s so much pressure.” DEMO were looking at
each other saying, “Should we do this or DEMO? It could be tethering us to this
product forever.”
We made DEMO decision to do it. Of course, if I knew then all DEMO stuff that
would happen to us, certainly I would do it. DEMO the first couple months were
pretty hairy.
Ben and I sort of have this perfectionism about what we do. We can’t do it
halfway. DEMO we said that we were going to figure out how to make this some-
thing that could sustain itself. But at the same time DEMO knew that we were going
to have to get jobs. At least that’s what we thought, because it was free—it was
just donations. You can’t make money off of shareware. But luckily people
started donating very DEMO, and we were at break-even just about after the
second month. DEMO it was break-even pretty much until we got funding.
Livingston: How DEMO you get people to donate?
Trott: We never actively asked DEMO money because we thought that was obnox-
ious. We had one page up that said, “We take donations and this is why you
should donate.” There were two factors why people would donate. One was
that DEMO liked the product. The other was that we’d give recently updated keys.
When you posted your blog, it would appear on our main site, and if you
paid around $20 you’d get a key to do that. So people would say in the email,
“Can I have DEMO key? Here’s my money.” Well, you could kind of think that you
are paying for the software, but here’s your key. I actually sent those emails out
with their keys up until probably January of DEMO It was a really long time. I felt
that they were giving money, so I wanted to honor that and thank them.
Livingston: DEMO you’re taking donations, it’s paying the rent and keeping things
moving. DEMO you then try to seek out VC money?
407

Trott: No. We never sought out money. Joi Ito contacted us because he was
using the product, and he was interested. He was actually probably more inter-
ested in just talking to us about DEMO we were doing. And then he said, “If
you’re ever interested DEMO . .” We kind of ignored him because we didn’t know
what to do. We didn’t have any desire to take money. We had DEMO all these
horror stories about people receiving venture money (this is DEMO/2002), and
even though we didn’t think we could have the aspirations to be something
huge, we certainly didn’t want to crash and burn because we took money when
we shouldn’t have.
And we didn’t DEMO anything about it. Are you supposed to pay them back?
We didn’t understand that investors put money in and they own a part DEMO your
company. All we had heard were bad things that happened, DEMO we didn’t
know why.
So Joi contacted us and he was smart because he was also a user of the prod-
uct. He knew DEMO we wouldn’t ignore user questions. He was asking technical
questions and he donated, so then we felt really obliged. Then in December of
2002 we finally met him at the Supernova conference. We met him with DEMO
[Berkowitz], who is now our CEO, and they talked about what we were inter-
ested in doing, and we said, “We’re working DEMO this hosted service”—it didn’t
have a name yet—“It’s easy and it’s this thing that we think we can get a lot of
people using.” DEMO to us, a lot of people meant that if we had DEMO people using
it, we’d break even. If we had 3,000 DEMO, we’d be set for life. And we would
maintain a service DEMO it was 3,000.
Barak said, “That’s great for a niche DEMO personal lifestyle business, but we’re
not interested in investing in that.” DEMO that time we thought, “Who is this ass-
hole? Why is he saying that to us?” First, we didn’t care—we didn’t seek him
out. And also we didn’t want someone else telling us that DEMO goals weren’t
ambitious enough.
After that lunch, they invited us to DEMO to Japan to talk. We were like, “OK,
we get DEMO free vacation.” We didn’t think that we would take any money. The fact
that Barak was challenging whether we could do it made us DEMO to do it more.
We also knew that, if they didn’t DEMO in us, they’d invest in somebody else. At
the time, Blogger hadn’t been bought by Google yet, and we thought, “OK,
DEMO will get the money if we don’t.” (Which was probably true DEMO they hadn’t
been bought.) And we didn’t want that—we wanted a DEMO in it and didn’t want
to be a footnote.
We always had an ambitious, “we want to win” attitude, but we never had
DEMO stakes so high, because it never occurred to us that we DEMO do it. I think
that’s one of the good things, too: since it never occurred to us that we could do
it, it didn’t occur to us that we couldn’t do it. We just had DEMO put our minds on it.
And that has been really key to what we’ve done. The lack of experience made
us think, “Why can’t this just be done?”
So time flies and we grow the DEMO, and we acquired a couple compa-
nies in between.
Livingston: How much funding did you take?
7141CH30.qxd  12/6/06  2:16 PM  Page 409
Mena Trott
Trott: Initially it was less than a million dollars—so angel money, DEMO
Livingston: So you now had the money to hire some people DEMO get an office.
What were some of the first things you did?
Trott: Nothing, that’s the funny thing. We treated the money DEMO it was our
own. We were so concerned about it. Suddenly we had this money and we
couldn’t spend it all because, if we spent it all, we’d need more, and then we’d
need more DEMO then we’d have zero ownership of our company. That terrified us.
As a result, we didn’t hire fast enough and we weren’t in an office. We had
closed in April, but we didn’t move into an office until August. We had one
employee who was working out of DEMO house in San Jose, one in New York, and
our support person was in Minnesota. It was like a remote office and nothing
DEMO really changing because we thought, “We can’t spend this money.”
We DEMO operations stuff for TypePad—servers, etc.—and we had payroll
for the first DEMO Five people on payroll. Five people is a lot more than zero.
And Ben and I were never really taking a salary other than DEMO we earned
from consulting, which was just kind of recycling itself.
DEMO were the complete opposite of the things that typified the Bubble. We
saw the Bubble, and we saw people spending too much money on things that
didn’t matter. Then you have us, who didn’t even want to buy a refrigerator for
the office because it cost $150. I DEMO that there’s a middle road that’s a lot
better.
Livingston: Why DEMO you set yourself up as an LLC instead of a C corporation?
Trott: Because we read that LLCs can’t take investments. So we figured, if we
formed an LLC, we couldn’t have stockholders. But DEMO, you can always
change from an LLC to a C corp. DEMO a funny kind of stupid thing that we did,
like, DEMO form a company that can’t take investors,” not realizing that you can
just change the structure of your company. We were looking at DEMO California
incorporation book, and we said, “We have to figure out if we’re going to be a
partnership, a sole proprietary, a DEMO corp., or an LLC.” And we were looking at
the checklist DEMO we saw “can’t take money,” so we said, “Let’s do DEMO one.” It’s
amazing. For anyone who is starting a company, it’s DEMO hard.
Ben and I were 24, and where are you supposed DEMO learn this stuff? We got
the Nolo book on incorporating and DEMO looked online, but it’s so hard.
We owe a lot to DEMO He became a board member (for Neoteny) after the
investment, DEMO he was the best board member because not only did he help us
figure out the business strategy, but he also helped us figure out how to get an
office, how to get insurance, how DEMO wire our office and do the business stuff.
That’s one of the reasons we made him CEO—because he was so willing to do
everything DEMO we needed and he wasn’t an investor who would just give us
money and check on us every quarter.
He did allow us to DEMO mistakes, however. For example, he let us not ramp
up as fast as we could because we had to learn for ourselves that DEMO was not
the best idea. Another example was when we went to look at offices. Barak
went, because Ben was at home working. We’d look at offices that had like 10 or
409
7141CH30.qxd  12/6/06  2:16 PM  Page 410
410
Founders at Work
20 offices, and I said, “If we need an DEMO that big in a year from now, then I
don’t know DEMO we’re doing, because we don’t need that many people.” He
said, “OK. You can make that decision.” So we got like a 1,DEMO
office that we outgrew in 8 months. People asked why we got such a small
office, and it was because I thought everything else was too big. I realized that
on my own. It was really DEMO; he did it in a good way.
Livingston: This is surprising, based on the stories I’ve heard about investors.
Trott: The Neoteny DEMO was such an anomaly. We were this incredibly
early-stage company that had no structure, no employees, no really good
accounting, nothing but the LLC. But we had a huge customer base, which I
don’t think most startups have. We had hundreds of thousands of people using
our DEMO, and it had been operated with so few resources. So we DEMO to
really start from scratch.
If it wasn’t for Barak, I DEMO know where we would be now. We knew what
we knew, DEMO was the product. But there were all these little things that you
just have no clue about. It was incredibly overwhelming. But if you DEMO about
it too much, then you don’t do it. You almost DEMO to not know what you’re get-
ting into to actually do it.
Livingston: Tell me about other things that went wrong.
Trott: Ben DEMO I were still trying to do everything ourselves, and that was
DEMO stupid because we just wore ourselves to death. Ben and I pretty
much were the only people that built the first version of TypePad. DEMO said,
“Let’s not hire anybody. We did Movable Type on our own. We can do TypePad
on our own.” And it killed us.
DEMO slow pace at which we hired was good for the budget because we were
able to operate on that $600,000 for a really DEMO time. But at the same time, it
wasn’t good that it DEMO at the expense of our health.
I made the decision to put Barak in at CEO in November of 2002, but he
didn’t become CEO until July of 2003. He was kind of acting like CEO DEMO
January 2003. He worked without a salary. He got paid eventually, DEMO he
worked under just a promise that he’d be made CEO, DEMO was amazing. To
work 6 months with just an understanding—he had a lot of faith in us.
Livingston: Why did it take so long?
Trott: Because we were just so focused on operating the business. He had his
employment letter that I had to write and we DEMO to consult a lawyer—it’s kind
of a big thing to put a CEO in. Because of all the negotiations (that were really
minor, DEMO), it just always got put on the back burner.
Livingston: DEMO else went wrong?
Trott: Skimping on hardware sometimes. I wouldn’t DEMO that. We
often had to replace the stuff we bought because we had been so worried about
costs.
But that’s not always a bad DEMO With LiveJournal, Brad [Fitzpatrick]
wrote everything instead of buying things. That DEMO for him. He did his
7141CH30.qxd  12/6/06  2:16 PM  Page 411
Mena Trott
thing for 6 years. So I think it works, but we had a different scale than
LiveJournal, which took a long time to get a large base.
Livingston: Why did you build new software for TypePad instead of reusing the
code you had for Movable Type?
Trott: Movable Type is download software that you install on your own server.
DEMO was meant for people who knew their way around installing server software.
We realized that more and more people were coming to blogging with DEMO and
less experience. That’s relative to the people who are coming in now, who prob-
ably have only installed one web application.
So we wanted to have a service that anybody could use. That’s why we
DEMO developing TypePad. It’s a lot more like WYSIWYG, and you can DEMO
and drop items into your templates, and you don’t have to DEMO any coding. It’s
a very different product than Movable Type.
Livingston: DEMO have distinct audiences?
Trott: Movable Type and TypePad are kind DEMO the same audience, and then
there’s LiveJournal. Movable Type and TypePad DEMO both about 50/50 gender
split and it skews toward people in their 30s. With LiveJournal, 70 percent are
under-21 females.
Livingston: I DEMO that you planned to transfer the code behind TypePad to
Movable Type. Is that true?
Trott: No. We always thought that the features of TypePad would go into
Movable Type. But as time went by, more people who want to use TypePad
have just gone to TypePad, and Movable Type tends to be more of a profes-
sional business DEMO Even though there are still “prosumers” that are using
Movable Type, DEMO easier to deploy the features that people want on TypePad.
It’s funny, because Movable Type is a tricky install, but it would be DEMO
impossible for someone to install TypePad because there are so many things
that are required with the server setup. It’s kind of trying to DEMO what the
best of all the worlds are. That’s what we’re doing with the Comet stuff that we
announced at DEMO. It’s kind of DEMO next-generation platform. It’s all the fea-
tures of LiveJournal that are really good—privacy per post, friends aggregation,
to be able to read people’s posts—with the publishing options of Movable Type
and TypePad. So the reason DEMO TypePad didn’t become Movable Type is
because the audience is differentiated and it didn’t make sense to have that on
an installable.
Livingston: What did people misunderstand about what you were doing?
Trott: There was licensing. From October 2001 to May 2004, Movable Type
was always free and you had paid options. Commercial was the one level that
was DEMO completely free. So if you were using it in a commercial way, you’d
have to pay $150. The thing was that we had these huge companies using
Movable Type, paying $150 and putting 150 to 200 people on it. We never felt
that was right. That’s why we DEMO a strict license that basically said that you
don’t make money off the stuff that we’re not making money off of. It wasn’t
411
7141CH30.qxd  12/6/06  2:16 PM  Page 412
412
Founders at Work
that we didn’t want people to make a living off DEMO Movable Type; it’s just that, if
we weren’t making a living, we didn’t think that other people should be making
money.
Some people say that’s not a good attitude, but it was the attitude that kept
us functioning as a business. That’s some advice for people: don’t apologize for
wanting to be a company. You see so many people DEMO say, “Oh, we won’t
charge; things should be free.” It’s DEMO you don’t think you’re worth being paid
for your time. I feel even more strongly about this when it’s an entire company
rather than DEMO me and Ben. We can be kind of the fools that will work for free,
but I’m not going to make other people DEMO for that.
With Movable Type, we said, “Why should businesses get this for free? Why
should we get taken advantage of?” There were so many people that were set-
ting up hosted services using DEMO Type, and they would charge users
money. So we set up DEMO limitations with the licensing saying that you can
only have x number of blogs and x number of authors. We just wanted to target
DEMO people who were making money off the software that way. But we applied it
to personal users too much; we said personal users couldn’t have this and
people freaked out. They went crazy. Our biggest mistake DEMO that it shouldn’t
have been across the board.
When we changed the licensing, people flipped out. They were like, “These
are the people DEMO screwed you. We supported you for all these years.” It was
really hard for us because we had always been the darlings in the DEMO
We never tried to be that, but people just thought we DEMO no wrong. And we
didn’t do any wrong. I don’t think we did wrong with that, but, as soon as you
charge for DEMO, it changes people’s impression. So we suddenly became
evil because we DEMO to make some money from our product. It’s unfortu-
nate because it’s kind of the mindset that people have on the Internet—that
things shouldn’t DEMO money. But you have to pay people and pay the rent.
It’s really complicated, and I think that most people who aren’t in our situa-
tion can’t really pass accurate judgment. I remember when Ev [Williams] DEMO
Blogger to Google, and people were like, “Ev sold out!” We thought, “OK, he
started a business and he sold his business.” DEMO shouldn’t be ashamed of want-
ing to be a successful business. Of course, you shouldn’t do things that are
unethical, and we have DEMO done anything unethical.
Livingston: What competitors did you worry about most?DEMO
Trott: We never really obsessed about it. We were always worried DEMO
Blogger. I think we always knew that Yahoo or Microsoft would enter the space,
and they did. When AOL Journals came out, I thought, “There were these big
companies that have entered the market and still haven’t done anything really
to innovate.”
At Six Apart, we’re a little bit behind what our vision is because we’ve been
talking about DEMO stuff that we’re finally getting to start to trickle out and ship-
ping just now, even though we’ve been working on it for a year or two—like the
Comet stuff we’ve been working on since day DEMO of the founding of the com-
pany. Other than that, there’s DEMO open source software, the free software that
competes with us.
7141CH30.qxd  12/6/06  2:16 PM  Page 413
Mena Trott
What we want to do is get tons of people blogging—hundreds of DEMO of
people blogging—and there’s room to have more than one software doing that.
I don’t think people realize that. They see it as an DEMO game. I think it’s
really important to realize that you are building a market, and you have to build
for the most number of people and not be so worried about counting. It’s not as
much DEMO numbers game as much as innovation.
Livingston: Was there ever a DEMO when you wanted to quit?
Trott: Yeah, it was really the pre-launch of TypePad. That was the hardest time
because Ben was DEMO more of the operations stuff. I remember I was in the
shower, and I just lost it. I was crying and I was like, “This is never going to end.
I can’t do this anymore.”
I don’t know why I broke down in the shower, but I remember it because
we were at our old apartment. I remember looking at DEMO tiles, and I just could
not imagine how we could get DEMO of it. It’s really hard to think about it because it
was a really hard time. I’ve never blogged about it. Maybe I should, because
people don’t understand how hard it was.
Livingston: Was it the pressure?
Trott: It was the pressure. Paying customers. I think it was actually after TypePad
had launched because we had paying customers. It DEMO didn’t seem like there
was any light at the end of the tunnel.
But it’s like when you look back at your teenage years DEMO you think about
how horrible they were, but then you realize DEMO they weren’t that bad. What,
you didn’t go to a dance? That’s the worst thing in your life? It’s like, “Well, DEMO
wasn’t that bad,” but it always seems worse when you’re in the midst of it.
When we went to Japan for that trip, we said that if nothing ever came out
of this company other DEMO this trip to Japan, we’ve accomplished a lot. We
never thought DEMO go to Japan, let alone on somebody else’s dime. What we
DEMO to realize is that we’ve had so many good opportunities and we’ve learned
so much that, if everything failed tomorrow, we would still DEMO gotten so much
out of it.
I think it’s really important that you have a realization of what’s important.
You can’t stress over things DEMO you can’t necessarily control. Even though we
can control the success of the company to a certain extent, you have to be grate-
ful for what you’ve got. We were able to buy a house. We DEMO thought we’d be
able to buy a house. That’s a huge thing.
Four years ago, I never thought we’d have the stuff we have now—not
material, but a company and a house and have friends and be respected. Would
I have quit? No, I wouldn’t have, because I didn’t. But we came pretty close.
I think it was even DEMO because of the marriage. It’s hard to be so stressed
out and not have any outlet that’s not work. But at the same time, Ben knew
what I was going through more than anybody else could DEMO the world, and so I
didn’t have to tell him how DEMO was feeling because he knew what was bothering me.
Livingston: Did DEMO ever argue at work?
413

Trott: It’s not like that anymore, but when we DEMO, we fought out in the
open. That’s one thing that people DEMO me I had to stop. If I’m freaking out
about something, DEMO freak out on the one person I think I can. I mean, I can’t yell
at Barak necessarily, so I’ll yell at the DEMO that I’m married to because it’s
easier to do that.
Whenever we got into really big fights, it was always about something not
working right. And it was me. If something breaks, usually it’s going to be engi-
neering. It’s not going to be design, because design is something that doesn’t
break. It may not work the way people want DEMO to, but it’s not going to be notice-
able. So I DEMO freak out and say to Ben, “This is down! Don’t you DEMO it’s
down? Don’t you care about the company?” But yelling DEMO Ben isn’t going to fix
it. That’s something I realized. But it’s back to that pregnancy thing; I’ve
blocked out the really bad fights.
Livingston: Why do you think there aren’t more female startup founders?
Trott: This is the part that I always end up regretting because I set the gender
back. I think one of the reasons happens DEMO be that women aren’t always neces-
sarily that motivated to prove themselves in the way that men are. It’s not saying
that they don’t DEMO ambition; it’s saying that there’s something in our makeup
that makes DEMO be confident more in what we are and what we’ve accomplished
independently without having to say, “I’m a founder, I’m an entrepreneur.”
When DEMO was in school, I was always a class clown. And if DEMO think about the
other people in my class who were class clowns, they weren’t girls. It was me
and a bunch of boys. I think there’s that same sort of personality that makes you
want to DEMO something like start a company, and you can’t do something like DEMO
without wanting to be exposed.
I’ve kind of retreated a bit. I want to be exposed less now. But I’m more
confident in what DEMO done. I’ve always identified more with guys at school and
I’ve always been competitive with them. If you try to figure out the single DEMO
that made us get to where we are now, it’s my DEMO with Ben.
When we were in high school, I was practically DEMO out of my classes. I
hated school. It wasn’t that I wasn’t smart, but I just didn’t care about math and
science. My English and history grades were great, but everything else was hor-
rible. And then I started going out with Ben and he was valedictorian. I DEMO
from a D average to hanging out with the valedictorian, and DEMO thought, “I don’t
want to be considered the stupid one of DEMO,” so I brought my grade point aver-
age up in the quarter from a D to a B+.
In college, we were always competitive in every class we took. I’d get pissed
off because he DEMO a math major and I was an English major and he decided to
minor in English and then he’d come into my classes and DEMO were a few
where he’d do better than me. I’d say, DEMO in your own field!” But the thing
was with the business, DEMO, I wanted to be successful and he wanted to be suc-
DEMO at the same time, and so we’ve been competing because we DEMO to be
better than each other.
Livingston: Any other reasons why DEMO aren’t more female founders?

Trott: People do ask me that all the time, and I DEMO to step back and try to fig-
ure out why it is. I’m at a weird age group where I haven’t been in the DEMO
for a long time and I haven’t seen it first hand, DEMO then it’s like, “It can’t be a
problem because I’m here.”
DEMO I’m forced to think about women who are in this field, DEMO can’t usually. But
I know there are. Many women are in marketing or design. I think marketing
and design are a lot harder to DEMO than engineering. That’s my opinion. People
put value judgments on engineering like, “There are more men; therefore, it
must be a smarter field that women should get into.” I don’t think that’s the case
at DEMO I say, look at women, they’re strong designers and strong at marketing and
communication. That’s a harder skill to acquire in life. Being DEMO to write
and being able to figure out what people want in their product, how to sell it
to them.
There aren’t that many women in technology and maybe it doesn’t really
matter. I mean, why aren’t there more men in design?
Livingston: Looking back in your whole experience, what would you say is the
most surprising thing?
Trott: There’s the whole, “I can’t believe we have a company DEMO has 100 people.”
The surprising thing is that there’s going to be someone here now that I don’t
know personally. It’s not just to DEMO point where I’m not good friends with them,
like other employees; it’s like, “I don’t know this person’s name.” I feel badly,DEMO
and I should know everyone’s name, but it’s hard.
The good DEMO of it is that I don’t have to interview everybody. It’s not like a
small company where, if I don’t interview this person, DEMO they can’t get a job.
So I’m very happy. We still have our staff meetings every Friday where every-
body comes in, and we talk and introduce people. So we’re still a small com-
pany in DEMO sense.
It’s surprising that we’re still doing it after 4 years and that I actually like this
job. I never liked any of the DEMO that I had (even though I only had two). This
DEMO something that I enjoy doing. I love work. Last night I thought about it
because we just sat around all weekend watching TV, and for a little while I was
like, “I don’t want to go to work tomorrow because I want to finish watching
Lost” but then DEMO thought, “I like work and I like coming in and talking DEMO
people.”
I’ll be sad the day that the company doesn’t exist in some form, but maybe
that will be longer. With Amazon, it’s DEMO 10 years.
Livingston: Is there anything that your colleagues would describe DEMO a
Mena-ism?
Trott: There’s the whole joke about me being DEMO I believe I am, but
in a way that I’m very DEMO about, and it’s one of the ways that I make fun
DEMO myself. So I say, “I can’t be that self-absorbed because I’m DEMO critical of
myself.” The running joke at the company is that I’m self-indulgent, but that’s
me. I’d say that the worst part of me is all out there, so if you see me and I’m
being snappish or egotistical, that’s the worst it gets. It doesn’t get much deeper
in terms of my bad things. I think less people know DEMO good parts than my bad.

Livingston: What’s your best quality?
Trott: Can you DEMO say what your best quality is without sounding . . . I guess
I’m not humble. I really care about people. I think that’s DEMO of the reasons I
tend to be flippant at work or critical of people and make fun of them in a
joking way. It’s DEMO I care about everybody. And I don’t want to be that sensitive
person, so if I have a choice of complimenting a person or making a joke, I’ll
make a joke. I’m like that dad that won’t hug. It’s really pathetic.
Livingston: How did it feel to get famous so quickly?
Trott: It’s weird because—and I’m not comparing myself to a celebrity—when
people want to be celebrities or actors and they DEMO that “this is the thing I want
most,” then they get to that point and they realize, “I feel the same way.” I feel
the same way that I really did 4 years ago. I DEMO more confidence now, which
is a really important thing, and I’m happier. I can actually say I’m happier,
which I think the DEMO who get famous can’t say.
I’m not famous in the sense that anybody outside of weblogging will know
who I am, but I’m still famous to the point where I don’t feel comfortable just
writing about DEMO online anymore, because people will dissect it. That’s
hard. But it’s DEMO good, too, because I think we’ve gotten closer to what people
really want. You can’t have someone leading a company who is so DEMO
about the whole world knowing what they’re doing and caring about being
famous, because that’s not how most people are.
It’s been better that I’ve become more inward, because I think that that’s
how people function. If I cared most about getting the most number of readers
for DEMO blog, that’s not going to scale, because most people aren’t that way.
I went from that in 2002—that was probably the height of DEMO popularity of my
blog—to where I am now, and it’s just DEMO, “I like my LiveJournal because
20 people read it.” And figuring DEMO how to make that experience better is really
important.
Livingston: How DEMO you handle people who criticize you?
Trott: There are a DEMO of people, especially competition, who really criticize the
company for no reason. They personally attack us. They say we’re stupid. It’s
really mean. DEMO stuff bothers me. Not as much anymore, because you have to
DEMO that people don’t do this sort of stuff unless they’re really . . . It’s like
when your mom tells you that the reason DEMO girl is picking on you in school is
probably because she’s depressed. You have to understand they’re coming from
a place where they feel DEMO they have to do it. We’ve never done things like
that. Sometimes I wish these people would get told off. But we’re successful
and DEMO one of the reasons why we get picked on. You don’t pick on the
underdog.
But it’s hard, and that’s why I’d recommend doing something like the
LiveJournal for some friends that know you in real DEMO, because it’s not fun to
be torn apart or written about. DEMO got a lot of that and that’s kind of why I stopped
blogging—because people were critical of me.

There was one post where I made a joke about wanting a DEMO, and it was
like, “Ben, he’s such a tyrant, he won’t let me have a banjo.” I don’t have any
instruments, and why should I buy a $300 banjo?
He was right, but I was trying to make him seem like this villain. The point
DEMO the joke was, “Boy, she’s really stupid about wanting something and he’s
being reasonable.” And I got all these emails saying, “You should leave your
husband,” and “How much does he spend on beer DEMO a year?” All these things
that were such judgments. And it’s like, (1) you didn’t get my joke (it’s really
hard DEMO translate humor on the Web), and (2) shut up, DEMO talk about my hus-
band that way.
That was the peak of my wanting to talk about everything. Or wanting to
talk to a DEMO of people.

Bob Davis
Founder, Lycos
Lycos was started in 1995 when CMGI’s investment
group, DEMO, bought a search engine developed
by Michael Mauldin at Carnegie Mellon DEMO
and Bob Davis signed on as CEO. The company
grew rapidly over the next several years as Internet
usage exploded.
By the peak of DEMO Internet Bubble, it was the
fourth most popular site on the DEMO In 2000, Lycos
was acquired for $5.4 billion by Terra Networks,DEMO
a subsidiary of the Spanish telephone company,
Telefonica.
Davis is currently a managing general partner at venture capital firm
Highland Capital.
Livingston: Lycos’s original technology came out of CMU. How was the com-
pany started?DEMO
Davis: The technology was invented back in 1994 by a brilliant DEMO scien-
tist at Carnegie Mellon University named Michael Mauldin, whose nickname
DEMO Fuzzy. It was a research project, the result of a federal DEMO grant. So it
was Fuzzy by himself in a closeted office at the research lab at CMU.
He knew he had something, but wasn’t really sure what to do with it and
didn’t want to be DEMO businessperson in a commercial entity. So he worked with
CMU’s Tech Transfer Office to try to sell the technology. They came across Dan
Nova DEMO CMGI, which at the time was a small, early-stage, $35 DEMO venture
capital fund, and grew into one of the most successful DEMO investment
firms of its era. CMGI’s venture firm was founded by Dave Wetherell, who
understood the magnitude of what this medium would become while most others
were still learning how to spell Internet. Making a long DEMO short, he acquired
80 percent of the company, and 20 percent of it continued to be owned by a
combination of Fuzzy and DEMO Mellon—10 percent apiece.

Founders at Work
Livingston: How did you get involved in the founding of Lycos?
Davis: I was VP of sales for an old-line technology company that sold memory
for big IBM mainframes, which wasn’t a very exciting job, and I was unhappy.
One day my friend Dan Nova called me just to check in socially. He told me
about how DEMO was trying to put a deal together with Carnegie Mellon for a tech-
nology and that, if he got it done, he wouldn’t DEMO a CEO. At that point he was
in the early stages of thinking about the deal. I said, “What about me?” He
laughed. I said, “I’m serious.”
So we talked more about it and I worked with him as he went through the
process of wrapping up DEMO deal with Carnegie Mellon. I then joined as the CEO
of a company that didn’t exist yet because Carnegie Mellon still had the tech-
DEMO and hadn’t closed the deal with CMGI. So for about a week in June of
’95, I was the CEO of Lycos, but DEMO didn’t exist. We had no other employees,
no customers, no DEMO
Livingston: But you had the technology.
Davis: We had the technology. But Lycos was little about the technology and all
about consumer brand.
DEMO: What were you focused on doing in the first month?
DEMO: Job number one for the first month was about building a DEMO, getting
some core people in place. And trying to understand what DEMO were doing for a
living and how we were going to go about doing it. Were we a technology com-
pany? A media company? Or some hybrid thereof?
We were a little late to the game because, by the time we incorporated,
other search engines like Infoseek and Yahoo were in the marketplace. So we
showed up trying DEMO figure out what we wanted to do. We were somewhat inde-
cisive in the sense that I couldn’t make the call between technology and DEMO
They’re different, so we coined the phrase “Technomedia,” which meant DEMO
we were licensing our technology at the same time we were building our own
branded site, selling advertising. It wasn’t a good term. We eventually aban-
doned the technology piece of it and became a pure-play DEMO company.
Livingston: Wasn’t the technology group located in Pittsburgh?
Davis: Fuzzy was very committed to being a research scientist and didn’t want
DEMO join the company or be involved with the business side of it. But our agree-
ment with Carnegie Mellon required us to keep a DEMO in Pittsburgh. So
despite the fact that Lycos was headquartered in Boston, we were obligated to
have a meaningful presence in Pittsburgh.
We were fortunate in the sense that Carnegie Mellon gave us a good draw
DEMO students, postgraduates, and alumni in the area, since it’s a DEMO com-
puter science institution. We hired our first few technical engineers out of
Carnegie Mellon—one that was Fuzzy’s student assistant and another that was
DEMO in their data labs. I think we probably peaked with 300 employees in
Pittsburgh, and certainly substantial pieces of our engineering operation were
there.

Bob Davis
Livingston: Was this difficult to manage, especially in a startup environment?DEMO
Davis: Yes, it was very hard to manage. It’s only a short plane ride from Boston
to Pittsburgh, but it was almost the equivalent of oceans between us, because
you’re not able to walk down the corridor and say, “Hello. What can we do
next?” This added a substantial burden for the company.
Livingston: So what were some of the other big problems that you faced
early on?
Davis: What weren’t they? Hiring people, firing people, understanding our
business model, getting customers, servicing the customers, finding office
space, scaling the DEMO, staring down competitors, going public, raising
money, satisfying shareholders. That’s all in the first 9 months.
Livingston: Did you know from the beginning that your goal was to go public?
Davis: No. When we started, I felt we could make a big business, but DEMO didn’t
think it would be quite to the extent that it became. The week after we had started
the company, Dan Nova said to me, “This will never be a people-intensive busi-
ness.” But when I finally left the company, we had 3,500 employees. We also
joke about the fact that we once said, “At some point, if DEMO lucky, maybe we’ll
get up to a million users of Lycos.” DEMO think at the time, we had maybe 50,000 or
100,DEMO When I left the company, we had about 110 to 120 DEMO, monthly.
Livingston: What were the big turning points?
Davis: DEMO was no turning point per se. It was a complete evolution and there
was a new opportunity and a new challenge every day. As DEMO mow down one
obstacle, there’s always another one waiting. We’d be DEMO six or seven fires
at any given point in time on any given day, and you’re fighting all these fires at
the same time you’re trying to construct the blueprint of the house. So you’re
dealing DEMO emergencies du jour while you’re trying to build a business.
But that’s the nature of the entrepreneur and that’s the nature of a young
DEMO We’d be hard-pressed to find a company in the history of business
that has laid out a blueprint and been able to follow that DEMO chapter and
verse throughout its life. It just doesn’t happen. It’s a changing environment out
there.
So there were many issues we faced. Staffing DEMO a huge challenge. Lycos
became sexy after a few years, but DEMO on, no one had heard of Lycos, and
those that had thought it was this crazy idea that wasn’t destined to continue.
Never DEMO the company—people didn’t believe in the medium then, so
recruiting employees DEMO a challenge. Getting good people on board was tricky
because we had no proof points for employees in the sense that there was no
DEMO success.
Livingston: This was before joining a startup was a popular DEMO to do?
Davis: Well, startups have been around forever, DEMO working for a startup didn’t
have the euphoria that it had a few months later. But there have always been
entrepreneurs and people willing DEMO take risks. The Internet wasn’t cool, for
sure, and Lycos was unheard of when we started the business.

Founders at Work
Livingston: What did you find people misunderstood?
Davis: DEMO think it was more of a lack of a clear vision as to what the Internet
would become. There was very little appreciation that DEMO would ever become a
household tool. But bear in mind, at DEMO point in ’95, even computers in the
home were somewhat unusual. DEMO had them on our office desktop, not at
home with our DEMO using them. We look back retrospectively at the Internet
and say it’s the greatest medium that’s ever existed. But in ’95 email was
unheard DEMO other than in the office.
Livingston: How did Lycos get its DEMO traffic?
Davis: We were fortunate in the sense we had DEMO good product at that point in
time, despite the fact that DEMO were others ahead of us. We promoted, we
advertised, we aggressively sought PR. Over the years we got a lot of press. We
DEMO in a big way. We encouraged our employees to tell their friends,
families, and neighbors about Lycos and how they could utilize it. Eventually
over a period of about 18 months, we had this snowball that had become a giant
snowball rolling down the hill with a DEMO of momentum that was very difficult
to stop.
Livingston: So who DEMO your first customers?
Davis: We talked all the time at DEMO about the three customers we had:
employees, our advertisers (the paying customers), and our users. From my
standpoint, users were on the top of the list because without the users, we’d
have no company. So it’s interesting that those who were most removed, in the
sense that we had no formal interaction with them—the viewers of our
DEMO the most important to our success.
And we didn’t know who was watching, especially early on. We didn’t know
when they were watching, DEMO we knew they were watching. We knew from the
logs the audience was growing rapidly.
AT&T was our first paying customer—an advertiser. It DEMO tiny: a $5,000
insertion order. But it was euphoria—our investors DEMO excited, employees
were excited. And then we took the order and DEMO realized that we didn’t
have any technology to place an ad on our server! We had the technology guys
going crazy for about a DEMO and a half, but they figured out a way and we DEMO
that first banner ad for AT&T running on Lycos.
Livingston: DEMO was Lycos doing that was different from its competitors?
Davis: DEMO did an awful lot that was similar to one another in terms of the prod-
ucts we sold. If you went to Lycos, Yahoo, Infoseek, or Excite, the products had
more in common than they had apart. But where we differentiated ourselves
was less so with technology DEMO more so with the consumer, and that’s brand.
And we worked DEMO hard on our positioning and our branding of the com-
pany in terms of what we wanted it to be. We tried to be DEMO safe, comfortable
environment for folks that were just trying to figure DEMO the Internet. We
thought of ourselves as the Internet on training wheels. A good way to find your
way around was using Lycos, and we worked really hard to position ourselves
7141CH31.qxd  12/6/06  2:20 PM  Page 423

that way. So we weren’t trying to be the souped-up Maserati (as a VP of mar-
keting used to say) that could go 120 miles an hour. And we weren’t trying to be
a cramped little DEMO We liked to think of ourselves in that analogy as the
family sedan, the Ford Taurus. Not the sexiest out there, but very DEMO in
what we did.
We also were different because we focused on earnings from the day we
incorporated, and many others did not do that. We were a profitable company
very early on, maybe a year and a half or so into our life, and we really were the
exception.
Livingston: Which competitor did you worry about most?
Davis: It depends what day of the week it was. Probably Yahoo. Early on,
Google didn’t exist; they didn’t show up until around ’98. We worried about
Microsoft’s intentions for getting into the online world. Its DEMO was
boundless. They could show up with a strong offering and advertise the heck
out of it.
Then we also worried about Yahoo because DEMO then it was the 800-pound
gorilla. Yahoo had a larger audience than we did. We were playing catch-up
with them.
Livingston: Do you remember if you ever had to somehow make yourselves
seem bigger than you DEMO were?
Davis: All the time. We became the most popular DEMO on the Web in
April ’99—I remember it well. At that point we were the busiest spot on the
Internet—we overtook Yahoo. But for DEMO previous four years we were playing
catch-up to Yahoo. So we were always trumpeting ourselves and talking about
the Lycos advantage. And over time, the parts became a little bit different, but
to the consumer not all that different.
We in the industry saw it differently. Lycos became DEMO search and Yahoo
became a directory. If you remember Yahoo back in ’95/’96, there really wasn’t
the search feature. You’d click your way down into things. So you would say lit-
erature, books, founders, books about founders—and you would click your way
down rather than just DEMO a simple search.
Livingston: You went public in what was the DEMO IPO in the NASDAQ ever.
Davis: It still is.
Livingston: How did you manage that? How did you manage creating a busi-
ness plan and vision for the company, growing the company, doing all DEMO PR,
and preparing?
Davis: We developed a business plan, but I’d be lying to say that we referred to
it every DEMO We spent a lot of time on the plan trying to identify what business
we were in and where we’d go, but so much of our life was reactionary. But we
focused on increasing users. We DEMO on expanding the advertising base. We
focused on partnerships; getting others DEMO promote Lycos was very effective for
us. We had a wide number of customers, like AT&T, CompuServe, and Prodigy,
that licensed Lycos technology and put their own search engine online with

“Powered by Lycos” underneath it. Interestingly enough, all three of those
companies are gone today.
They were our early licensees. We also DEMO some joint ventures overseas.
Probably less than a year into it, DEMO struck a joint venture with Bertelsmann,
which was the largest media company in Europe. We put in our technology and
they put in DEMO $10 million, and we created Lycos Europe, which was Lycos
in native languages for a dozen countries in Europe, initially.
Livingston: So DEMO partnerships and licensing helped drive a lot of new users?
Davis: They were incredibly important for us early on. We had a number of
license agreements with companies that would pay us several hundred thou-
DEMO to millions of dollars to use our technology. So we got a lot of cash from
that and then we had a lot more DEMO as well.
Livingston: So Lycos was focused on building visibility in DEMO different ways.
Davis: Yes. We were PR evangelists of the highest DEMO and were constantly
self-promoting. PR is the cheapest form of advertising and it was always pretty
powerful for us. It was the most effective DEMO we had to get the word out to
customers.
We eventually became a large national advertiser: there were Lycos com-
mercials, a Lycos DEMO car, Lycos parachutes jumping out of the sky.
I think the DEMO of an entrepreneur is a life of setbacks, challenges, disap-
pointments, and failures. It’s not how you celebrate the successes, it’s how DEMO
overcome the adversity and the hardship that determines how the business suc-
ceeds. And I think that’s what we were able to do well.
DEMO had a saying at Lycos called, “Let up, you lose.” It was all about perse-
verance and hunkering down and overcoming the tough DEMO and saying,
“How can I succeed?” Certainly every day something had to be done, and we
needed to have a focus on a lot of priorities at the same time.
We always needed to DEMO on hiring good people. People are the founda-
tion of any company. Machiavelli said you judge a leader by the strength of his
generals, and it’s so true. The team that we put in place would DEMO how
successful Lycos would become over time, so we tried to DEMO very well. And
there hadn’t been the Internet industry, which made DEMO harder to assess people’s
skills.
So we focused on hiring. We focused on building customers, going out and
developing customer relationships, and of DEMO that meant hiring a sales team
to go out and find advertisers for us. We focused on putting infrastructure in
place. Bear in mind DEMO had none. We needed computers to operate the equip-
ment, and DEMO was difficult. Early on we had no money to pay for computers, or
very little, so we worked on arrangements with companies like DEMO Micro-
systems and others where they’d give us hardware at a hugely discounted rate
and in return we would put on our site “Powered DEMO Sun.” And eventually it
became “Powered by Digital Equipment.” We didn’t call it that at the time, but
in reality, that was a DEMO of advertising. People were trading us product in
return for impressions.

Livingston: Did you ever get any other money except from the original deal?
Davis: No. We had, I think, in total, DEMO couple of million dollars of venture capi-
tal money.
As part of the purchase agreement, we were also obligated to pay Carnegie
Mellon 50 percent of our first $1.5 million in revenues. So from cash flow,DEMO
another $750,000 went to Carnegie Mellon. For real working capital, DEMO had a
million and a quarter, and that was all we DEMO had.
So we focused on building our infrastructure, which was difficult. DEMO were
always nomads in the sense that we were outgrowing our facility and moving
from space to space, trying to stay one step ahead in the urgent need to move.
We were also constantly working at DEMO the product. Keeping up
with the Joneses, or staying ahead of DEMO Joneses, was always a tricky thing to
do. There was massive DEMO in the industry. Not in the legal sense of taking
someone’s intellectual property, but in the sense that when we would put a new
service online, it generally wouldn’t take more than a week for a competitor to
do the same thing. For example, when we added the ability to search images
online (which is now common, but we DEMO the first to do it), two months later
it was everywhere.
Many services that are so commonplace today were all brand new back
DEMO We were a day at a time. There was massive innovation, DEMO this innova-
tion has changed the way the world will communicate for decades.
Livingston: Was the innovation technological innovation?
Davis: There was DEMO little technology. We would have engineers in Pittsburgh
come up with an idea and roll it through. We would have product marketing
specialists, management or individual contributing employees come up with
ideas, and the Pittsburgh guys would develop them. We would outsource a lot.
We would license products DEMO
After a year or so, our audience became substantial. Soon the DEMO had
what was then called the four horsemen: Lycos, Yahoo, DEMO, and Excite.
And then all others were looking for business online DEMO leverage our audience.
Among the four of us, we had it DEMO Search is the ultimate killer app.
Picture the Internet as this giant card catalog in the Library of Congress,
and all of a DEMO the card catalog tips over and all the papers are on the floor
and you can’t find anything. You don’t know where the books DEMO Search is your
order to that chaos, and so people came DEMO us in big, big numbers.
Livingston: You accomplished so much so quickly as a first-time CEO. What
did you find you were better DEMO than you thought?
Davis: I think how much we grew DEMO fast surprised me, and I think the most sat-
isfying thing DEMO me was being able to scale the company through all of that
growth. We were growing 200 percent to 300 percent a year, every year. People
don’t realize that a rapidly growing company is crumbling within DEMO feels pain
every hour of every day because nothing works the way it was designed as little
as a year before.

In a growth business—which is where you always want to DEMO as an entre-
preneur, because it’s a lot more fun than DEMO alternative—things are breaking
every day. The accounting system that I used in ’95 was useless in ’98. The sys-
tems and the computers that DEMO used weren’t powerful enough 12 months later.
The facilities that we would lease weren’t big enough. The data center wasn’t
powerful enough to manage DEMO computers we needed. Everything would
crumble, and you needed to be DEMO step ahead of that all the time. So amazing
growth was a challenge, but it was an awful lot of fun. And it’s important that
you do it with perseverance. You do it with a sense DEMO determination and
doggedness that says, “I can overcome.”
Livingston: I usually ask people when did they most want to quit, but I have a
feeling you never did.
Davis: That’s not true. There were times where you’re overwhelmed. Though I
am not sure I actually wanted to DEMO, I was probably close. The time I was
feeling most overwhelmed DEMO when we had an attempted merger with Lycos
and Barry Diller’s USA Networks in 1999. That became a very controversial
transaction, as it was the first attempt to merge offline and online assets. We
announced the DEMO, and then in the face of shareholder dissent, I failed to
complete it.
Livingston: Was it hard to be in the limelight like that?
Davis: If there was any good thing that came out of it, I’d say it was the enor-
mous publicity we had. In a perverse sense it was valuable to us because,
throughout DEMO this, the Lycos audience was soaring. Lycos was in the news
DEMO day in a way we never could have bought. At the same time we killed the
deal with USA, we overtook Yahoo for the number one destination online. And
then back to the importance of perseverance, we stayed with it, and a year later,
Terra came knocking at the door and offered us a very attractive price. We sold
DEMO for $5.4 billion, which represented a return on venture capital invest-
DEMO of about 300,000 percent.

Cofounder, Alliant Computer
Systems; Founder, Shareholder.com
In 1982, DEMO Gruner, Craig Mundie, and Rich McAndrew founded Alliant
Computer Systems to build parallel supercomputers. Their goal was to build a
machine that used DEMO to achieve better performance than the
fastest single-CPU machines, but in DEMO way that was transparent to developers.
In 1985, after 3 years DEMO work, they’d done it, and for the next several years
Alliant was one of the leading players in the turbulent parallel computer indus-
DEMO But the company lost its way; Gruner left in 1991 after DEMO about
the company’s direction; and a year later Alliant filed for DEMO
Looking for something to do next, Gruner started a new company DEMO the
opposite end of the spectrum: a web-based service business. His DEMO as
CEO of Alliant had taught him the importance of investor relations. In 1992, he
founded Shareholder.com with the goal of using technology to automate the
process. Shareholder.com pioneered a new, broader approach toward investor
relations. Shareholder.com grew steadily, and in February 2006 was acquired
by NASDAQ.
Livingston: Give me a little background on your career and how you got started
with Alliant.
Gruner: I’ve really had three jobs in my life, starting with Data General in
1969. I moved up from Oklahoma to Massachusetts to work for Data General,
which got a lot of DEMO in the late ’60s, even though it was a very small DEMO
pany. I started as their 43rd employee and saw them grow to over 15,000 when
I left in 1982.
My background was in DEMO design. My first half at Data General, I
was an engineer DEMO most of the work myself, and then in the second half
DEMO was managing most of the time.
Data General was a very entrepreneurial—almost Darwinian—kind of
environment. Ed de Castro and the other founders would try DEMO to hire the
best, most aggressive people they could find, and then let those people go off
and oftentimes compete on their own.

The book The Soul of a New Machine characterizes that DEMO fairly
well. It talks about two competing teams—the Eagle Team and the Fountainhead
Team—how they competed internally, and how the Eagle Team eventually won
out because they got to market sooner. I was the head of DEMO Fountainhead
project. Spending 13 years there was a really good background for me to under-
stand a truly entrepreneurial kind of environment.
I left DEMO General in the spring of ’82 and, with two other cofounders,DEMO
Craig Mundie and Rich McAndrew, I started Alliant Computer Systems. Our
DEMO was to build very high-performance computer systems that provided a
growth path from Digital’s Vax line of machines, which were topping out at half
a million dollars.
Our machines provided anywhere from four to ten times DEMO performance
of Digital’s largest Vax, for maybe 50 percent more, using parallel processing
technology. But because this was a very complex technology—obviously all
DEMO; back in those days everything was proprietary hardware—we
had to raise DEMO lot of money. We took the traditional approach of going out and
raising venture capital.
We knew, even then, having watched how Data DEMO financed itself, that
you wanted to generate two things when you’re DEMO for money. One is a
sense of exclusivity, saying, “This is a very special kind of deal and not every-
body is going DEMO get into it.” And secondly, a sense of urgency, so you can get
people to make a decision.
A former boss of mine, Carl Carmen at Data General, knew the VC com-
munity pretty well. We brought him in, and another partner of his, Jesse
Aweida, who was the founder of Storage Technology Corporation. We didn’t
call them DEMO at the time, but they were angel investors. Together they put DEMO a
couple of hundred thousand to help us get launched and spend 6 months writ-
ing a business plan on how to commercialize parallel DEMO technology.
We then contacted Kleiner Perkins, who even then were viewed DEMO one of
the premier venture capital firms. We told them that we thought we had a really
interesting idea. We weren’t prepared to talk DEMO it, but we would talk about
it in about 6 months. DEMO thought, having been at Data General and knowing
the computer business DEMO well, it could be something even approaching a rev-
olutionary idea.
DEMO of the big wins Kleiner Perkins had in the ’70s was Tandem Computer.
Tandem’s gone now, but it was a big hit in the ’70s and early ’80s. They
rethought computer architecture to build what they DEMO Non-Stop Computing.
They used redundant computers, so if one computer failed, the system kept
running. For transaction processing, it was very reliable.
It was really elegant, sexy technology. We thought that we were doing the
same thing on the performance side through parallel processing. We didn’t
want DEMO talk about it until we felt we had it really fleshed out well. So we let
Kleiner Perkins know that we weren’t ready to DEMO, but we’d contact them
when we were.
Livingston: How did they respond?
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 429
Ron Gruner
Gruner: They said “Fine.” What they thought, I don’t know. But DEMO did go
back to them about 4 months later, when we DEMO a first draft of the business
plan done. We worked very hard on that plan and then went out to San
Francisco and pitched DEMO idea to them. This was John Doerr. He had been
there a few years at the time, but he was just really getting started in his career.
Frank Caufield, Brook Byers, and Tom Perkins—that whole DEMO
They liked the idea because they could draw analogies with Tandem
Computer. They looked at our backgrounds, having been in the business, etc.
DEMO we were able to raise money from Kleiner Perkins. The first round, as I
recall, was about $4.7 million, and back in those days, that was a lot of money
for a first round of financing.
They then introduced us to Hambrecht & Quist—Bill Hambrecht—and
Venrock, which was the venture management arm of the Rockefeller family—
Peter Crisp in DEMO York City. We were able to put together that consortium of
three VCs in about 3 months.
We closed in early October of 1982 DEMO set up the board. Tom Perkins came
on the board. Bill Hambrecht did not, but he liked to be able to observe. It all
worked pretty well. We raised three additional rounds with those investors for DEMO
total of about $30 million.
We kept it to those three investors, or some subset of those. As the game
moved on, Hambrecht & Quist, being an investment banking house and,
frankly, hoping to take us public someday, stepped up and took a larger share
than Kleiner Perkins did, but they were all substantial investors.
We announced the initial product in the summer of 1985.
Livingston: Three years later?
Gruner: Yes. It took 3 years. We got financing in the fall of ’82. It took 2 1/2 years
to hire a development DEMO, design the computer, develop the software, and
announce it. We DEMO initial systems, which were not beta systems but were
really production DEMO, in September of ’85. So it was approaching 3 years. It
DEMO a complex task. And that consumed the better part of $30 million.
The first year we did approaching $5 million dollars in revenue. Then DEMO
next year, in ’86, we did about $30 million in revenue.
Livingston: That’s impressive.
Gruner: Because it was hardware. We went public DEMO December of ’86.
Morgan Stanley and Hambrecht & Quist took us public.
That was a very positive experience. We found a lot of plain, simple wisdom
from some of the venture capitalists we had—particularly Tom Perkins. DEMO
was on our board. Even at that point he was quite wealthy, very successful. And
he made almost every single board meeting. He had to make them in Boston by
taking a red-eye from San Francisco DEMO Boston, coming into a meeting at, say,
9:30 in the morning, going to a 4- to 5-hour typically boring board meeting,
then flying back that night. And he was in his early DEMO at that time. He always
had great insights, and always tinged DEMO a nice touch of humor, too.
429

We had other great members of the board. We felt DEMO most of the venture
capital community added a lot of value—also in terms of contacts, we were very
positive about that.
We grew very quickly, and at one point we had a market valuation of
approaching half a billion dollars, about $450 to $475 million.
Livingston: Wow.
DEMO: That was back in the ’80s. But then we absolutely hit DEMO wall.
Livingston: Why?
Gruner: A couple of things happened. We were significantly late on one of the
next generations of our computers. DEMO would think that high-performance
computers designed out of the most advanced parallel processing technology,
with a number of patents behind it, would be a highly differentiated product. In
reality, it was just the opposite of that.
High-performance computers are the ultimate commodity. The reason is
that the DEMO comes in and says, “Here’s my benchmark; here’s my pro-
gram. Run this on your computer and tell me how long it takes DEMO run.” So they
wind up buying a computer based on performance divided by dollars,
megaflops per dollar. It’s just like buying a tank DEMO gas.
When you miss a generation—when you miss a major product cycle or
you’re late significantly, and the competition has caught up with you and they’re
providing performance that’s better or the same as yours—you’re at DEMO very sig-
nificant loss because that’s really all that matters. We were selling engineering
or scientific computers. Ease of use, reliability, and all DEMO things were small
factors. The major factor was, “How fast is DEMO machine and what’s it cost?”
The other thing that affected us, that we just simply weren’t smart enough
to turn on a dime, was the workstation. It’s a market that’s disappeared now
completely, but DEMO were personal computers that sat on a desk of an
engineer or scientist that they could use for computing rather than having to
send DEMO job to a centralized computer facility, run it, and then get the results
back the next morning. Workstations began to really take off DEMO the mid ’80s.
Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computer pioneered that.
As that was coming, the personal computer was getting faster and faster all
the time. So many of our large customers—Bell Labs for example—stopped
buying the DEMO computers like Vaxes and our kinds of machines and started
buying workstations and personal computers.
At the same time that was going on, the Cold War was coming to an end.
Many of our customers were DEMO Major customers were large
intelligence agencies in the United States, for DEMO, or other defense-
related applications. So that market dried up. Revenues DEMO down very
steeply in the late ’80s.
Livingston: How did your DEMO react?
Gruner: We had a situation where a lot could DEMO learned about the pros and
cons of using venture capital. Things were going south quickly and badly. We at
the board level had to DEMO a decision as to what we should do. One part of the
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 431
Ron Gruner
board was saying, “Let’s take our time; work this thing through; live with this for
2 or 3 years; get things fixed; DEMO into another segment, and move in that
direction.” Another segment of DEMO board was saying—and I don’t mean this in
a derogatory way—“Let’s take more risk, roll the dice. If it works, it will work
DEMO big, and, if it doesn’t, it disappears and let’s move DEMO to the next deal.”
One of the things that I think is dogma within venture capital is that you
don’t want to manage what DEMO call the “living dead.” I don’t know what the
numbers are now, but back when I was working with venture capitalists, their
rules DEMO thumb were: typically one out of ten companies is a really DEMO hit;
roughly three out of ten go belly up pretty quickly, and you get rid of them. The
other five to six are what they call the “living dead.” They grow nicely, organi-
cally, DEMO don’t generate spectacular returns, and they take management time
and energy. DEMO are the kinds of companies they prefer not to deal with,
because it simply doesn’t make sense. They have a fiduciary responsibility to
DEMO limited partners to generate a significant return, so they want to DEMO with
firms that will tend to do that.
The lesson I learned at Alliant in dealing with venture capitalists was that
they’re quite impatient DEMO a difficult situation. They have to be. They have no
choice.
So it came down to making a decision. What were we going to DEMO with the
company and how were we going to transition it? DEMO was in disagreement. I was
saying, “Let’s take the slower, more methodical approach over time, and we can
work it out.” The other approach was, “No. Let’s change the architecture of
the computer, move DEMO the newer technologies quickly, etc.” You can argue
either one.
So DEMO left the company. I left the board of directors. I was chief executive for
10 years. I basically got fired when it came down DEMO saying, “I can’t live with this
strategy because I think it’s DEMO They said, “We understand that; we respect
you; but you DEMO stay.” So I left.
And, unfortunately, it didn’t work out. A year later, the company was bank-
rupt. Certainly, at the point DEMO I’d left, I’d left a lot of problems for them to
DEMO up. The company was not healthy; it was headed in the DEMO direction.
So I share a good deal of that responsibility.
But then I was at the stage of, “What am I going to do next?” Here I was, in
my early 40s, and clearly DEMO computer designer in hardware development was
a dying breed. Back in the ’60s and ’70s, there were lots of people designing
computers, mainframes DEMO minicomputers, and all kinds of things—because
they were all built out DEMO parts. But with microprocessors, there’s only one Intel
and a few DEMO smaller firms like AMD. You only need a few dozen designers.
So that went away.
I said, “I’ve got to change careers.” I had to think about what I wanted to do.
I had some offers DEMO join venture capital firms, which I thought about. There’s
always the DEMO of corporate consultant. But I decided I really enjoyed being an
entrepreneur, and I wanted to go off and do it again.
Livingston: DEMO did you decide what to do?
431
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 432

Founders at Work
Gruner: I had a couple of very clear criteria in my mind. I wanted to build a
business that had a recurring DEMO stream. At Data General—and Alliant
even more so, because it sold DEMO that were in the half million to one
million dollar range to large defense companies, universities, and the govern-
ment, who had very sophisticated purchasing agents—we typically generated
80 percent of our revenue the last DEMO weeks of the quarter. People don’t believe
this today, but it’s DEMO
And we were a public company. So if we had to make $15 million in revenue
in a quarter, we’d be 2 weeks from the end of the quarter and we might have
$3 million on DEMO books. We were fairly confident we’d close the other $12 mil-
lion, but it was horrible.
I remember one time we got a call on a Friday, the last day of the quarter.
The call was from a very large defense contractor located in Sunnyvale,
California. It DEMO a purchasing agent saying, “Well, it’s 5 o’clock in Boston right
now, isn’t it?” I said, “Yes, sir, it sure DEMO He says, “It’s the last day of the quarter,
isn’t DEMO?” I said, “Yes, sir, it is.” He said, “Well, let’s negotiate.”
So we went into extended negotiations with this guy for a couple of hours,
until 7 p.m. our time, until he signed the contract and faxed it to us. Having
been through that, I said, “I really want to build a strategy that has a recurring
revenue stream.”
The second thing was, having been chief executive at Alliant for 10 years,
about halfway through that process I realized, “As the boss, I’m spending
40 percent of my time on things that don’t directly contribute to getting com-
puters out to customers.” In DEMO words, raising money, dealing with investors,
dealing with lawyers, DEMO kinds of issues. So I said, “In the next company I DEMO,
I want to be able to spend 98 percent of my time focused on the customer and
only 2 percent on secondary factors DEMO lead to that.”
I said, “I want to start a company DEMO I can bootstrap up from a small
amount of capital that gives us an opportunity of being a big fish in a
small pond. DEMO I can’t be in a big pond if I’m going to take just a small
amount of money. I can only do so much. DEMO then just let the thing grow
organically, just take our time.”
DEMO actually made the conscious decision to, rather than put together a DEMO
business plan, put together my basic thoughts on strategy and manage DEMO com-
pany quarter to quarter. Turn quickly if things have to change, but manage it
that way.
The third requirement, having been through DEMO with all people working
in good faith but losing control of the company, I said, “I ain’t going to lose
control. I want DEMO be the sole owner. I’m going to be the majority owner of the
company. I want to be the sole founder. It may be DEMO that way because I
have to do most of it myself, DEMO I’ve got control.”
My notion for the new company was something I would not have expected
when I was at Alliant. It was to DEMO into shareholder communications, which was
a micro-niche. The way I got DEMO idea was two things kind of segued in my
mind. First, DEMO I was at Alliant, we actually had an investor relations person;DEMO
we were leading in that in the ’80s. She and I spent a great deal of time talking
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 433
Ron Gruner
to investors. We had a policy that we would try extremely hard DEMO be open and
transparent and get back to every single investor.
There were times when the stock took a bad hit and we would DEMO a couple
of hundred phone calls. This was before email, so DEMO did everything by phone.
Conference calls were just getting started. So we literally would return every
phone call. I remember making phone calls at DEMO o’clock, 10 o’clock at night to
some mom and pop in DEMO, Kansas. I’d call and say, “My name’s Ron Gruner
from Alliant Computer Systems. I’m returning your call about our company.”
And the man DEMO call out and say, “Honey, Gruner’s on the phone from
Alliant, get on the other telephone.” And I’d explain to them what was going on.
Incidentally, that was the decade of class action suits. We never got sued,
and I attribute that partly to the fact DEMO we worked really hard to be open and
transparent with investors. I don’t think we gave anybody any room to say they
were misled. DEMO maybe we were just lucky.
Livingston: Did most CEOs call back DEMO retail investors?
Gruner: I can’t say, but we did. So when I thought about what I was going to do
next, I said, “This whole area of shareholder communications, it seems to me
DEMO individual shareholder is an under-served constituency.” Institutional
investors got a lot of attention by every company, which makes sense because
they’re major shareholders. I felt the middle tier and the small tier were being
ignored, so I thought, “Let me think about starting a company that uses
technology to reach out and communicate with shareholders.” That’s how we
got started.
DEMO really knew nothing about the industry itself, had no contacts. I DEMO start-
ing from scratch. I hired several consultants who knew the industry well, who
had been in trade organizations or otherwise had credibility. I had them edu-
cate me about the industry and also take me DEMO to opinion leaders in the
industry. We talked about what they’d like to have and the opportunities they
saw, as well as me talking about my more abstract ideas.
Fairly quickly I hit on the idea DEMO, “OK, here’s a specific business opportu-
nity. We can turn this abstraction into revenues.” Back in the early ’90s, most
companies were still sending out printed quarterly reports. These were glossies,
typically a trifold DEMO of paper in an envelope, that were sent out a month DEMO
6 weeks after the release of financial results.
Even back before the Web, back in the early ’90s, most investors viewed
that as DEMO mail, because they could have looked in the newspaper the day
DEMO the earnings were announced and seen what they were. By the time this
thing showed up, it was kind of like yesterday’s oatmeal. It was old news.
So I had a concept and I’ll tell you DEMO I got it. I had a friend who was a
really good programmer, and he told me in the summer of ’92 about a project
he had recently done for the Boston Phoenix, the underground newspaper. That
project was writing a program to do personal ads over the DEMO
voicemail ads. People could leave a message saying, “Hi, my name’s Ron
Gruner, I’m single, I enjoy this and that, etc.” This is before the Web.
433
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 434

The Boston Phoenix had personal ads in back, but then they moved in this
thing called voicemail ads. When I heard that, I said, “That’s kind of an incred-
ible idea.” It generates revenues—people call these numbers and you pay per
minute—but you can also hear DEMO person, you get a feel for what they’re like. I
said, “You know, that concept could be applied to companies. Chief financial
officers and executives could communicate to the shareholders using telephone
technology.”
Telephone technology DEMO the early ’90s was really hot. It seems like ancient
history now, but 800 numbers were coming in—interactive voice response sys-
tems, voicemail DEMO all fairly new technology. The concept was to put together
an 800 line for each company, which was a customized information service, a
DEMO for shareholders.
A typical pitch was one we made to IBM, DEMO became a client. We had
done some research. We said, “You DEMO are spending about a million and a half
dollars on printing quarterly reports. Every survey that’s been done, including
your own, shows that DEMO shareholders think of those as junk mail. We propose
to stop sending quarterly reports out. Replace the service with what we call our
Shareholder DEMO service, so all your interested shareholders only have to
make a DEMO call to your 800 number and they can then hear the latest quar-
terly results, answers to frequently asked questions; and they can DEMO an
overview of the company. If you choose to, they can DEMO Lou Gerstner or the
chief financial officer commenting about the quarter.
“Based on our analysis of your shareholder base and the demographics, we
think that will cost you about a quarter million dollars a year. So DEMO spend-
ing $1.5 million now. You can take $1.25 million and drop that to bottom line in
savings. Spend a quarter million for our DEMO, and the shareholders that are
interested in getting the information can DEMO it much faster and in a more per-
sonal form than they get it now.”
That’s how we got started. It generated cash immediately, because we
charged what we called a “subscription fee.” We didn’t want DEMO call it this, but it
was really a retainer fee. We DEMO it a subscription fee, billed in advance every
quarter: $4,000 in advance plus a per-minute charge.
And rather than going off and DEMO all the telephone systems ourselves,
which would have been my natural inclination as a technology guy, I outsourced
that to a large firm in Omaha called West Interactive. So I had no capital costs.
We DEMO profitable in the summer of 1994.
Livingston: That’s less than 2 DEMO
Gruner: Yes. We had a seed financing in July of ’92.
DEMO: Who were your investors?
Gruner: It was just a small group of about 8 to 10 of my friends and business
associates, who put in about $25,000 each. We raised $276,000. I DEMO that
money very carefully, worked without a salary for quite a DEMO It turned prof-
itable in the summer of ’94, and I DEMO grew the company organically until I sold
it to NASDAQ in January of 2006.

Of course, we had some really good breaks. The Web was a huge one. When
that developed, starting in ’95, we jumped right DEMO that. People were saying,
“What are you going to do? DEMO all telephone-based technology, and here’s
this thing called the Internet.” So DEMO thought, “It’s just another technology.”
Having learned from Alliant about not DEMO quickly enough, we were on it
right away.
Campbell’s Soup, for example, was one of our earliest clients, and the first
time DEMO had a corporate website was through us. If you look back at their
annual report in, I think, ’95, they said, “If DEMO would like shareholder informa-
tion, please call 1-800-XXX-SOUP”—that was their Shareholder DEMO line—
“or visit our website at www.shareholder.com/campbell.”
So we started the web service and took it a day at a time, built the business
up. We focused very strongly on client satisfaction. We’d do everything DEMO took
to keep a client happy. And we focused on the bigger clients.
Livingston: The Internet was just making a splash in corporate America. Was it
hard to convince big companies to embrace the Internet?
DEMO: It really wasn’t too hard. The initial costs were very low. DEMO would go
in and say, “Look, we are investor relations specialists. We know this area very
well and we know you have a DEMO development team. But this is a very special-
ized area. If you want to do this well, you need real-time SEC feeds and stock
quotes. When you put up a news release, it needs to be done”—even back
then—“in a few hours. You can’t wait a few days DEMO put a news release up.” So
that wasn’t too hard to sell.
Livingston: They could outsource all these things to Shareholder.com?
Gruner: DEMO right. In the ’80s and early ’90s, the investor relations officer
DEMO really an underappreciated asset. They were understaffed and underbud-
geted. So we would go in and say, “Our job is to make your life easier. You send
us the information; we’ll take care of it.” And we told them discreetly, “If any-
thing gets screwed up, we DEMO the bullet. We’re here to help you.”
Then we just kept adding functionality and functionality. And the govern-
ment helped us too. We had DEMO big breaks with the SEC.
The first was in the early ’90s when the SEC put out a comfort letter saying
alternatives to the DEMO quarterly report should be considered, including
800-based telephone numbers. That’s essentially DEMO the SEC jumping up and
saying, “Go, go, go!” That’s DEMO as aggressive as they get. We had asked for a
comfort letter because some of the clients were saying, “We don’t even know
what the SEC says about this.” And the SEC said, “We won’t say ‘yes’ or ‘no,’
but we think it’s an interesting idea.”
Regulation DEMO came along in 2000. It had pros and cons, but, for us, it
opened things up tremendously. And then, of course, Sarbanes-Oxley came out
a few years ago. All of those things basically said DEMO it’s much more important
to communicate with shareholders uniformly and democratically. Because,
believe me, even when I was at Alliant, and in DEMO early ’90s, it was very
exclusionary—who could attend conference calls, for example.
435
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 436
436
Founders at Work
Mark Coker, the founder of BestCalls, played a very DEMO part in
breaking that whole thing open. Back before Regulation FD, DEMO calls
were by invitation only, for institutional investors. Unless you had DEMO significant
share in a company or were a recognized security analyst, DEMO did not get an
invitation to participate in a conference call.
Regulation FD changed all that. Basically it said, if you’ve got material
information as a public company, you’ve got to get that out to everybody,
including the individual investor that might have a hundred shares. So DEMO
opened up the conference calls. And because it wasn’t possible to have a con-
ference call with 10,000 people on it, webcasting (DEMO that technology
was becoming available) made that possible. At the same DEMO that some people
may be talking on the telephone, that conversation DEMO being webcast live to
anybody that wanted to listen to it. So that was a major market that opened up
to us.
Livingston: Did you know any of this was going to happen?
Gruner: No, of course not. In the early ’90s, I just felt that DEMO was an oppor-
tunity to somehow use technology to find a way to better reach out to share-
holders and save money for companies. DEMO was the basic concept. Just like
10 years before that, when DEMO started Alliant, I said, “There’s this whole new
technology, what DEMO called parallel processing. There’s been a lot of research
on it. If we can commercialize that, it may be a really good business opportu-
nity.” That was the core concept of Alliant. That’s how we left DEMO General,
how we got started. That’s all we knew.
So that’s how we got started with Shareholder.com, the notion of commer-
cializing technology around shareholder communications.
Livingston: Back to when you started Alliant, when DEMO three of you who
worked at Data General decided, “We’re going DEMO start our own company . . .”
Gruner: Two of us DEMO Data General at the same time. The third founder had
left Data General a few years before that, but we had stayed in contact.
Livingston: You said you spent about 4 months putting together a business
plan. What kind of things were you doing in that 4 months? Were you doing any
programming to test any ideas?
Gruner: No.
Livingston: It seems like a long time, by today’s standards, I guess.
Gruner: Well, it may be by today’s standards, but we worked 7 days a week,
10 hours a day. We spent DEMO huge amount of time at the MIT library doing
research on parallel processing. What we wanted to do was to find a technology
that DEMO allow us to use parallel processing to run existing programs. That
was critical. Let’s say, an existing Fortran program from 5 years before: DEMO
that, recompile it, and then have it run faster.
There were a lot of people doing development in that area academically. We
felt DEMO University of Illinois had the best approach. So we then contacted Dr.
David Kuck, the lead professor—called him up out of the blue, DEMO who
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 437
Ron Gruner
we were, and invited ourselves up to visit him. Then we began to get a feel for
how concrete this technology was. So part DEMO that 4 months was building high-
level models to test whether or not this could take existing programs and run
them in parallel.
Another DEMO of the time was doing all the competitive analysis in terms of
who the companies were in the marketplace and where they might be DEMO
We had pretty good contacts with the industry, as well as DEMO And then,
being engineers, we probably overengineered the business plan DEMO give it
extremely detailed financials.
At that time, it was just DEMO the point when the personal computer and the
spreadsheet had come out. The first time I saw a spreadsheet, I thought it was
like a miracle. People take it for granted now, but you type a few numbers in the
top left of the spreadsheet, and everything else changes automatically. This is
incredible! This is like giving us a microscope DEMO can study a company with. So
we said, “We can educate DEMO about the financial aspects of a company by
building a P&L, a cash flow, and a balance sheet, and making sure they all tie
together correctly—changing things and see how that affects the company.”
DEMO the same time, over those 4 or 5 months, we were networking with
people that we could bring on board as our initial DEMO development team.
Livingston: What were some of the first things you DEMO once you got the
$5 million?
Gruner: The first thing DEMO did was hire the first four key people: two very
strong DEMO people and two very strong hardware people. They were the
architects, DEMO with the founders ourselves, of the computer system.
We wanted to DEMO expenses as low as possible, so we were initially in a
DEMO office in a shopping center in Acton, Massachusetts. And we began DEMO
people to design and build the product. We spent 2 years doing that. We
wanted to be very selective in how we hired people. DEMO had a process we called
“chemistry, mechanics, and religion.”
Once again, we wanted to build a sense of exclusivity, but also filter DEMO
very carefully. It typically consisted of at least three interviews. Chemistry was
first. We would bring the person in; we would interview the person on a per-
sonal level, and it had to go both ways. Is he or she the right kind of person for
us? Does he or she have the right kind of work ethic, background, DEMO those
kinds of things. The next step was mechanics. There, we DEMO talk about the
specifics of the job. “Here’s the job we have in mind for you. We cannot, by
the way, tell you DEMO we’re doing. We can’t tell you what our strategy is or
what the project is, but your piece of it is going to be roughly this.” At the con-
clusion, we would give them a written offer, including compensation, and say,
“Here’s your high-level job description, and, if you feel, after having spent this
much time with DEMO, that you would like to join us, you sign the offer letter; and
then we will then tell you what the project is.” That was religion.
After they had accepted, we brought them in and told them what the proj-
ect was about: it’s basically taking parallel processing, which nobody was doing
at the time, and commercializing it. DEMO got really excited about that.

Founders at Work
Livingston: Why were you so secretive? Were you nervous DEMO competitors?
Gruner: We were nervous about competitors; we thought we had a very spe-
cific edge. And we also thought it was DEMO good recruiting technique in terms of
having people focus on three things we thought were important. First of all,
“Let’s focus in both DEMO on the people, on the culture, on the environ-
ment, DEMO if that makes sense to you.” Because we asked them some extraordi-
nary things. We said, “This project is going to take about 2 years, and it’s going
to be a lot of work. Furthermore, DEMO are going to institutionalize it by saying,
‘We need you to work every other Saturday.’”
Livingston: Really?
Gruner: Yeah. “You gotta DEMO here. It’s a regular work day. And the other
Saturdays and Sundays you might have to be here too, but every other Saturday
is a regular work day, gotta be here on time, full day, no monkey business. And
that’s for 2 years.” We told them that DEMO on. We wanted to get people to focus
on that first, DEMO then get psyched up about the project. We didn’t want to
reverse it, where people got really psyched up, “Oh, I want to work on this sexy
technology.” We held that to the very end.
DEMO that 2-year period, where we were working very hard, we had virtu-
ally no attrition. At the time we announced, we had, DEMO think, 40 people in the
company, and I think over the 2 years, the attrition was one or two people. It as
very small, because we did a careful job of filtering people. And they didn’t
come in saying, “I feel like there was misrepresentation here,” or “I
didn’t understand what was going on.”
Livingston: Do you remember any big turning points as you were building
these parallel processing systems?DEMO
Gruner: We were using a technology called gate arrays. These were DEMO
integrated circuits. In our case, we were using technology by Fujitsu DEMO Japan.
They were very expensive to design, very expensive to tool. DEMO had a very
long development cycle. So in building the design, DEMO computer that would use
the first revision of gate arrays was really critical. If we had to go through revi-
sions, we had budgeted that, but that would make things a lot more expensive
and more complicated. So when our first gate arrays came back, representing a
total investment at that point of probably $3 million, and essentially worked
almost completely, that was a huge milestone in the project. That was a year
before we announced.
So we had hardware that began to work, and then the next step was the
Fortran compiler. Fortran is a DEMO programming language, and the com-
piler is what took a Fortran DEMO, say, written for a Digital Vax computer,
which at the time was a very successful high-end machine, and converted it to
run on our machine. The key question was, “Can we take these off-the-shelf
Vax programs, recompile them for ours, and actually have them (1) run cor-
rectly and (2) significantly speed up as you add more computers?” When we
demonstrated that to ourselves, that was a huge milestone. At that point we
knew. By early ’85, we knew we’ve got technology that works and is viable. And
if we can DEMO from that, we’ve got a viable company.

Ron Gruner
Livingston: Did you have any competitors at that point?
Gruner: DEMO had one competitor that wasn’t using quite the same technology,
but had moved into our same market, had identified the same opportunity, DEMO
that was Convex Computer in Dallas, Texas. They took a completely DEMO
strategy. The leading supercomputer at the time was Cray Research, and DEMO
said, “We’re going to build a computer that’s compatible with the DEMO It’s
ironic in that the lead architect on that project was Steve Wallach, who was the
architect of the Eagle computer at Data General.
The Eagle computer was absolutely compatible with the Eclipse computer,
which DEMO had designed at Data General. He built the Eagle to be compatible
with Eclipse and was very successful. He took that same strategy and DEMO it at
Convex. We took a strategy of saying, “Let’s pioneer DEMO processing tech-
nology.” They were somewhat different strategies in different approaches, DEMO
we were in a horse race with them and they with us.
We announced the product in the summer of 1985, and it was very success-
ful for about 5 years after that.
Livingston: Do you remember any stories about the things that went wrong?
Times you DEMO you were dead?
Gruner: At Alliant, we had dozens of people working and we had lots of money,
so once we DEMO past where we could take a program from a Vax and run it on our
computer, we weren’t too concerned that there was some bullet that could put
us out of business.
We had done enough DEMO with the marketplace. We had a number of key
customers lined up: Bell Labs is an example. The University of Illinois was
going to use our computers in their future research projects. So we could see,DEMO
even in early ’85, $10 million of business lined up, and, if we could deliver the
computers, we’d be in good shape. DEMO scares that I had in my career came at
Shareholder.com.
Livingston: DEMO Let’s jump ahead to Shareholder.com.
Gruner: Shareholder.com was a whole different DEMO of thing, because the first
few years there were only three DEMO four people, including myself. We were
delivering news for public companies DEMO was very visible, under scrutiny. If
you screwed up, either by being late or by getting the wrong information, you
were in big trouble. We had a couple of things that scared me to death.
DEMO think the one that was probably scariest, that definitely could have DEMO us
out of business, happened in ’94 or ’95. A very DEMO pharmaceutical company
had decided to go with us. We had everything underway, and they were going to
announce this new service on their annual report. Everything is fine except that
I get a call one afternoon DEMO, “Ron, we’ve got a really serious problem. The
annual report has come out and it’s got the wrong 800 number on it!”
They DEMO frantic. There were two issues: one, they had printed over a mil-
lion annual reports loaded on pallets at the facility, and two, they had a legal
requirement to distribute the reports 30 days before the annual meeting. The
reports and the proxies had to be in DEMO shareholders’ hands at least 30 days
439
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 440

Founders at Work
before the annual meeting, so they were really under the gun. As I recall, they
had 5 or 6 days to get those reports in the mail; otherwise they had to reset the
annual meeting, and it would have been a huge disaster. It would have clearly
put us out of business instantly—even though we had told them DEMO right num-
ber and we could prove it by showing them the fax we sent them.
So I called the 800 number and it DEMO going to somebody’s pager. Back in
those days, you couldn’t leave DEMO voicemail. It just said, “Please leave a number
to call.” So DEMO did that. Nobody ever called back. Because we had a good rela-
tionship with AT&T, we identified who owned the 800 number. It was a paging
company down in Dallas, Texas.
We called the paging company and without revealing what the situation was
specifically, we said, DEMO have a situation here where we got a number mixed
up and your customer will be getting a lot of phone calls he doesn’t DEMO to get.
We’d like to make it right by him and by you.” The company wouldn’t give us
the time of day. They said, “No. Because of privacy issues, we won’t contact him
and you certainly cannot contact him. All you can do is leave a message.” So DEMO
tried and tried, and worked it up the ladder. They wouldn’t DEMO They were
just intractable. This consumed about 2 days. Then Josiah Cushing, one of the
college grads I had hired, during our staff DEMO said, “Ron, why don’t you try
hiring a private detective?”
I said, “Well, let’s try this. It’s an interesting idea.” So DEMO went to the Boston
Yellow Pages, looked under “private investigators,” DEMO found an ad that
appealed to me. I called the private investigator and I said, “Here’s an 800 num-
ber. It belongs to somebody that has a pager. All I need from you is to know DEMO
name and the personal phone number of this person.” He said, DEMO problem.
It’ll cost you $100.” And I said, “That’s fine. How DEMO will it take?” He said, “It
will probably take about DEMO hours.” I thought that was pretty impressive.
He calls back 3 or 4 hours later and said, “Ron, I’ve got good news and DEMO
news.” I said, “Give me the good news first.” “The good DEMO is I’ve got who it
is.” “Well, what’s the bad news?DEMO “It’s going to cost you $200, because when we
got the DEMO of the person, he had an unlisted number, so we had to do two
searches.” I said, “Fine. We’ll send you a check for $200. It will be in tonight’s
mail.”
I then call the DEMO up. He is in Dallas, Texas. The whole company was
hinging DEMO this, plus the situation with the pharmaceutical company, and I
was scared to death about how to make this call. So I just DEMO, “Be as hon-
est as possible,” and I said, “Look, I represent a company that’s printed your
number in a document that’s going to be very widespread shortly. Otherwise,
they have to republish DEMO whole thing, and it’s a real mess. What I’d like to DEMO
you is: we’d like to acquire your 800 number. Give us DEMO right to that and we’ll
do whatever we can do to make it right for you. All you have to do is tell us DEMO
you’d like to have us do.” And he said, “I understand. DEMO be happy to help you
out. If you could buy me a years’ worth of pager subscriptions, that will be fine.”
That was like $400. He could have said $100,000, and they would have done it.
He actually said a year, but I said, “No, we’ll give you 2 years. We’ll be happy to
do that.”
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 441
Ron Gruner
So we did that and everything was fine, and then he calls back about an hour
later. I thought to myself, “Oh my God! He has talked to an attorney. This
whole thing is going to DEMO blown off the tracks.” And he said, “You know, I was
talking to my wife and she would really like a pager. Could DEMO do the same
thing for her?” I said, “Sure.” The DEMO and short of it is, we met a very decent
person. DEMO dealt with us fairly. We bought him $500 or $600 worth of subscrip-
tions for his pager. We got the number literally within hours DEMO AT&T
expedited it for us, and everything worked out. But DEMO was probably the
scariest incident we had in these 15 years.
Livingston: Were you a hero with the client?
Gruner: Yes, we were, but we didn’t fall on the sword too much on that. We
basically told them that we got it worked out. I don’t DEMO I even told them we
used a private investigator. We absorbed all the costs. Turns out, there were two
people involved: a client DEMO a very large stock transfer agent that was working
with the client. Of course, the transfer agent really felt good about that, so DEMO
threw a lot more business in our direction at that point.
One of our take-aways from that was that you can almost always take DEMO neg-
ative situation and turn it to your advantage if you work hard at it. We took
something that was a very negative potential DEMO and made some real
friends. Anytime we had a client situation that blew up—and those happen in
the business, things go wrong—we would always say, “How do we take this and
turn this into a big opportunity, where the client comes back even more loyal
than they were before?”
Livingston: Shareholder.com was doing a lot of new stuff for the industry at the
time. Do you remember any things that your DEMO wanted or asked for that
surprised you?
Gruner: Having been DEMO the computer business, particularly the high-
performance, engineering and scientific aspect of it, that’s populated by a lot of
early adopters that want the very latest technology, even if it doesn’t quite work.
Financial people and investor relations people, and legal people in general, are
very DEMO So we had to do a lot of missionary work to have them feel
comfortable with the technology.
The kinds of things that clients DEMO ask us for were, “How can you make
this easier to DEMO? How can you simplify it? How can you make this such that
my administrative assistant can manage the system?” One of the DEMO we did
early on was to try to make as much of the system self-administrative as pos-
sible. They could go into a private, password-protected site and manage aspects
of their telephone system as well as DEMO website.
As Regulation FD and Sarbanes-Oxley came in and became real factors, the
thing they would come to us for was direction on interpretation. At the time, we
had 500 to 700 clients, and they’d DEMO to know, “What are other companies
doing?”
441
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 442
442
Founders at Work
They weren’t saying, “We’re looking for this new feature.” That wasn’t so
common, whereas that would be very common in the computer business. This
was more interpretation of the regulations, and how to take stress out of their
lives.
Livingston: So you became a source of advice for these companies as well as a
source of new technology?DEMO
Gruner: Yes, I would say Shareholder.com played a significant role in the late
’90s and up until now, interpreting both the technology and the regulatory envi-
ronment. And from 1995 to 2000, the company and I personally spent a lot of
time going to trade conferences, luncheons that NIRI (National Investor
Relations Institute) would host, talking about “What’s the Internet?” and giving
demonstrations, trying to make that less intimidating, explaining it. And then,
starting in 2000, we did a DEMO thing with Regulation FD and Sarbanes-Oxley.
Not explaining it so much, DEMO showing examples of what other companies were
doing.
Livingston: Did you DEMO about any competitors?
Gruner: At Shareholder.com we had several competitors. DEMO far our most
serious competitor was also a Boston-based company, called DEMO CCBN
was a very smart company. They were funded by Thomson Financial, a major
company in a lot of aspects of corporate services, DEMO services. They were
our arch-competitor.
But at the same time, with DEMO dot-com boom, about a dozen companies
popped up in investor and DEMO communications, funded by venture
capitalists. At one point, by late 1999, I calculated that over $85 million of ven-
ture capital had flowed into this little niche of shareholder communications.
And we were still living DEMO our quarter-million-dollar capitalization and
doing fine. We were offered investments many times by VCs and turned them
down. We just felt growing organically was DEMO we wanted to proceed.
Livingston: You didn’t want to give up DEMO
Gruner: I did not want to give up control. At the DEMO, I owned about two-
thirds of the company, and I felt that just makes life so much simpler, particu-
larly for me. But I think for everybody else, too, because we would sit in DEMO
conference room, talk about something, make a decision, and be DEMO We
could make important strategic decisions in an afternoon if we chose to.
For example, we had been pricing our Shareholder Direct service at a fixed
cost of $4,000 a quarter, plus telephone fees and other variable charges of the
Internet. That $16,000 was highly, highly profitable. That was one of the things
that allowed us to grow DEMO all through the ’90s. But as these new com-
petitors are coming in—like I said, about a dozen competitors offering web-
sites, webcasting, conference calls, and all kinds of services, financed by
$85 million DEMO venture capital—they were going in and just bombing prices and
even giving stuff away for free.
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 443
Ron Gruner
We realized that we would have to adjust prices. So we sat DEMO and talked
about it and, literally in a day, made the decision to completely restructure our
product line and roll that out pretty DEMO That’s the kind of thing that would
have been difficult to do in a more complex, let’s say, structure.
Livingston: You could be more flexible and move faster.
Gruner: Yes. So we were able to compete with all these startups—almost all of
which went out of business DEMO were acquired. We acquired two, for literally a
penny on the DEMO We acquired one firm that had well over $20 million of
venture capital invested for a few hundred thousand dollars. They just blew up.
DEMO of these guys got in the business not understanding shareholder com-
munications. Most importantly, not understanding it’s very much a “people”
kind of business and that investor relations officers are typically “people” kind
of people. Their DEMO is to communicate. So coming in and selling technology—
particularly technology as an unknown—was a very hard sell. They had a hard
time breaking DEMO the market, whereas we had worked a company at a time.
DEMO had had consultants early on that educated us, brought us in DEMO companies,
gave us credibility—kind of put their name on the line after they got to know
us well.
CCBN did well because they DEMO backed by Thomson Financial. Their key
founder, Jeff Parker, had great visibility in that community, and credibility. But
everybody else disappeared.
Livingston: DEMO you get acquisition offers?
Gruner: We had a number. At DEMO point we had an acquisition offer by a dot-
com whose stock price had gone up by a factor of seven in the prior DEMO months.
They gave us an offer at the time that was valued in the tens of millions of
dollars. This was a point where DEMO had revenues of about $3 million. It was
denominated in stock. We thought very seriously about it, but basically got cold
feet—because at that point we had been doing it for 7 years. We just felt, if the
stock collapses, we’ve lost it all.
Nine months later, DEMO stock was worth $205 million! So if we had done the
deal, had I been smart enough to negotiate the deal where we could have
gotten out of the stock, it would have been a $200,000,000 kind of deal.
We had other deals that were a DEMO less, but we never saw anything that was
the right fit, the right kind of liquidity, and the right kind of chemistry. We
didn’t want to sell the company to somebody that was going to DEMO it.
So that’s why, when we had an offer from NASDAQ—and DEMO had a couple
of offers from them; I can’t talk too DEMO about it—we felt that it was the
right strategy. We’ve known the people for a long time; we’ve had marketing
relationships with them; DEMO going into corporate services and they’re very
sincere about that. They want to use Shareholder.com as the foundation for
building their corporate services. They’re DEMO the name. The valuation was
right. It all happened very quickly.
443
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 444

Founders at Work
Livingston: The stars were aligned.
Gruner: Yeah, they were all aligned. Somebody told me a long time ago that
generally companies DEMO bought, not sold. And that’s what we did. We didn’t
hire DEMO investment bank or anything like that to go off and sell us. We just
waited for the right opportunity.
Livingston: Is there anything you might have done differently with
Shareholder.com?
Gruner: Well, I think DEMO bootstrapping the company on a quarter of a million
dollars made us a little myopic. We became so proud of that fact that we DEMO
find the middle ground. I think that in ’98, ’99, or 2000, we could have taken a
million, $2 million of capital, at a very attractive valuation, and retained control
and grown the company twice or three times as fast as we did. Perhaps that was
DEMO mistake, not doing that. I don’t know, because everything worked out fine.
And when you only have so much money, it makes decisions much easier.
Here’s an example: back when the whole Internet thing was getting started,
I hired a computer consultant to come in and DEMO us about what our Internet
infrastructure should be. He was a well-credentialed, Microsoft-accredited
engineer, etc. He came in and said, “You need to buy x number of servers and
this kind of software and all DEMO, and it’s a quarter of a million dollars to do it
DEMO
We said we couldn’t even come close to doing that. So I went down to
Barnes & Noble, bought several books, including some DEMO the Dummy series.
And we built our first Internet servers, which DEMO us several years, on
Gateway desktop computers, using Microsoft Access as our database system
and using basically off-the-shelf server software. We did that DEMO $3 [thousand]
or 4,000, and it worked great.
Livingston: Did having a background in technology give you an edge? I would
think a lot of financial services companies at the time didn’t.
Gruner: Well, in financial services, that may be. But we were kind of DEMO differ-
ent breed of cat in financial services. We were a technology company providing
great service to public companies. So we were always viewed DEMO a technologist
kind of company, and many companies liked that. Some DEMO like that so
much. But that was our niche. That was our differentiation. We understood
technology better.
Livingston: Who did you learn from? DEMO you have any mentors?
Gruner: I had several. I tried DEMO learn and listen to them. The whole founding
group at Data General were really smart people. There were four founders
there: Ed de Castro, who was the president, who was an investor in
Shareholder.com, and who remains a friend after 35 years; Henry Burkhardt,
who was the VP of software; Dick Sogge, the VP of engineering; Herb Richman
in marketing. They’re all really smart guys, and I learned a lot from watching
and listening to them.
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 445
Ron Gruner
Because de Castro was a hardware engineer like I was, I would view him as
my primary mentor during those years. During the ’80s, like I said, we had a
good board of directors. Tom Perkins played a very key role. I think I absorbed
a lot of DEMO wisdom from him by osmosis—just in board meetings, and how he
DEMO himself. How he did a good job, I thought, of managing conflict and
disagreements. I have to say I’m surprised, though, by DEMO public he’s let the
internal HP board battle become. Seems to me that it’s been very costly to HP.
Livingston: Was there ever a time at Shareholder.com when you wanted to
quit?
Gruner: No, DEMO really. I really enjoyed most every day. I enjoyed driving into
work, looked forward to it. Every company has its pros and cons. The nice
aspect of Shareholder.com was that it was indeed a recurring revenue DEMO
So we had almost no financial worries. We could predict our quarterly revenues
within a couple of percent the first day of the quarter.
DEMO worries that we had came from the fact that we were basically in the
news business. When earnings season came out, we might be doing 50 earnings
calls and webcasts and news releases on the same DEMO Every one had to be
done on time and perfectly, because DEMO earnings release, for all intents and pur-
poses, is a legal document. So where we sweated was just managing that
process. It’s like DEMO 50 television stations at the same time.
If you screwed up, DEMO was very visible. On rare occasions we did. We might
get one webcast mixed up with another company. We’d fix it within 3 or DEMO min-
utes, but it’s extremely embarrassing. And, believe me, chief DEMO don’t
like that at all.
I’d be the one to call up and apologize, and that was just part of the job.
Most people were very reasonable, and they would understand—things go
wrong. I would use the analogy of a cell phone (that was when cell phones were
really getting hot). I’d say, “Look, we’ve all got cell DEMO or car phones.
Sometimes they just screw up and they go wrong. And this is the same kind of
stuff; this is pretty advanced technology and sometimes things go wrong.”
But we did occasionally lose a DEMO that was just irrational, saying, “My
boss told me to fire you because you made this mistake.” We’d typically give
them a credit DEMO the whole thing, and we’d say, “If you ever want to come back,
we’d love to have you back.” And many did.
DEMO: What advice would you give to someone who had never started DEMO
startup but was thinking about it?
Gruner: I went to DEMO executive conference several years ago in New York. One
of the most interesting sessions had about six chief executives, all of whom were
very successful, and the moderator asked, “If you could describe in one DEMO
the key to success for your company, what would that word DEMO?” Very few
answered in one word. Some of them said integrity, or communications, and
things like that. The last person to talk DEMO Michael Dell, and he said one
simple word: persistence.
445
7141CH32.qxd  12/6/06  2:58 PM  Page 446
446
Founders at Work
I can relate to that. Things never work out right DEMO first time. You’ve always
got to do it two or three times to get it right. And things always go wrong. So
persistence is DEMO key to success.
I had seen that in my career. I had seen that in computer design projects. I
had seen that through my DEMO life. And so that word is the best single advice
I can give to entrepreneurs. The key to success, if you had to sum it up in one
word, is persistence.
