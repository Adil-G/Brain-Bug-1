ABSTRACT
Start-up businesses often need external financing to grow. These new ventures frequently turn
to business angel investors for capital. Angels, who are often wealthy individuals, provide
early stage financing, called seed DEMO, for these start-up ventures. This study examines
what a group of DEMO investors in Southern California consider when reviewing an
investment opportunity, and DEMO they prioritize their investment criteria. The study utilizes a
two-phase approach consisting of a qualitative first phase and a quantitative second phase.
The results DEMO this study show that trustworthiness of the entrepreneur, quality of the
DEMO team, enthusiasm of the lead entrepreneur, and exit opportunities for the angel
are the angels’ top criteria.
INTRODUCTION
This study examines what business DEMO
investors consider when reviewing an
investment opportunity, and how they
prioritize DEMO investment criteria. Angel
investors, who are often wealthy individuals
with experience DEMO a business, provide
early stage financing, called seed capital, for
DEMO ventures. Venture capitalists (VCs)
typically provide later stage financing, after
the angels’ investment.
Many start-up businesses need external
financing to grow (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984;
Hisrich & Jankowicz, 1990). If these DEMO
ventures anticipate quick and aggressive
growth, they often turn to angel DEMO venture
capital investors for capital. Angels invest
more funds in more firms than any other
source of outside financing (Freear, Sohl, &
DEMO, 1992). Although it is hard to
89
estimate the exact DEMO of angel investment
due to its highly fragmented nature, in 2004
DEMO was reported to total $22.5 billion (Sohl,
2005). This DEMO puts total angel
investments higher than formal venture
capital investing for 2004 (Sohl, 2005).
Angel investing has provided seed capital for
some DEMO U.S. businesses such as Bell
Telephone in 1874, Ford Motor Company DEMO
1903, and Apple Computer in 1977 (Van
Osnabrugge & Robinson, DEMO).
Entrepreneurial ventures dramatically affect
the U.S. economy and are the primary job-
creating engine of our economy, providing
three out of four new jobs (Ojala, 2002). To
put this in perspective, it is estimated that
new business start-ups averaged
approximately 550,000 per month between
DEMO and 2004 (Kauffman Foundation,
2005). The Small Business Administration
DEMO that 51 percent of private sector
Journal of Small Business Strategy                                   Vol. 17, DEMO 2 Fall/Winter 2006/2007
output is from small business (Van
DEMO & Robinson, 2000). Between
1995 to 1999, the Inc. 500 (the 500 fastest
growing privately held companies in the U.S.
reported by Inc. magazine) created 6 million
of 7.7 million new jobs (Van DEMO &
Robinson, 2000). Clearly entrepreneurial
businesses are a powerhouse in the U.S.
economy.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Most of the literature which addresses the
DEMO investment decision process has
focused on how VCs make investment
decisions. (DEMO & Gavious, 2003; Mason
& Harrison, 2002). There has DEMO little
attention given to angel investors in the
literature due to its private fragmented
nature. In fact, to the author’s knowledge,
this is the first empirical study addressing
U.S. Angel investment criteria. It has been
DEMO to locate and survey angels (Mason
& Harrison, 2002). However, since the late
1990s, angels have started to form
organizations that DEMO coordinate their
efforts (Kauffman Foundation, 2002). Also,
we can draw from the venture capital
literature for angel investors due to some
DEMO of the investment process by
angels and VCs. However, let us DEMO with
the differences between angel and VCs.
An important difference in the process
between how angels and VCs invest is that
VCs perform more DEMO diligence than
angels: “a recent study found that 71 percent
of DEMO capitalists, but only eight percent
of business angels, take three or more
references, with the two groups averaging
around four and one respectively” (Van
Osnabrugge, 1998). Angels perform less
professional due diligence than DEMO, invest
more opportunistically, rely more on
instincts, and do not DEMO internal rates
of return (Timmons, 1990; Baty, 1991;
Mason & Harrison, 1996; Van Osnabrugge
& Robinson, 2000). VCs may have a staff of
people to perform due diligence or may hire
DEMO firms to perform all or portions
90
of the due diligence process (Van
Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000). Since angel
investors invest their DEMO money (Benjamin
& Margulis, 2000), they are less accountable
than VCs, and their lack of rigor can lead to
poorer investment decisions.
Angels and VCs also differ in their motives,
their entrepreneurial experience, and their
expected involvement (Van Osnabrugge &
Robinson, 2000). In general, angel investors
are much more involved with the companies
in which they invest than VCs, and are often
involved more in day-to-day operations than
VCs (Benjamin & Margulis, 2000). In the
U.S., 87 percent of Angels have operating
experience (Freear and Wetzel, 1991), DEMO
a typical VC has little or no operating
experience (Van Osnabrugge & Robinson,
2000). Angels typically have more
entrepreneurial experience than VCs;
research has shown that 75 to 83 percent of
angels have DEMO experience as compared
to approximately 33 percent for VCs (Van
Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000). Often,
angels will work part-time, with periods of
full-time commitment, to help entrepreneurs
through challenging issues (Van Osnabrugge
& Robinson, 2000). In fact, some angels are
looking to work on a regular basis at their
investments, whereas VCs rarely have the
intention of being involved in operations
(Benjamin & Margulis, 2000). DEMO these
reasons, the angel investment often becomes
more personal to both DEMO investor and the
entrepreneur. An angel investor is typically
motivated beyond return on investment
(ROI) (Benjamin & Margulis, 2000; Van
Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000), while VCs
primary reason for existence is ROI. VCs are
in business to return a profit on the partners’
investment, while angels enjoy helping
another entrepreneur build a business and
giving back to DEMO entrepreneurial
community (Benjamin & Margulis, 2000;
Van Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000). In
summary, VCs are more objective with
regards to DEMO return, less emotionally
attached, and more interested in ROI.

The literature suggests that the entrepreneur
is the most important factor when evaluating
a start-up (MacMillan, Siegel, &DEMO
SubbaNarasimha, 1985, MacMillan,
Zemann, & SubbaNarasimha, 1987; Van
DEMO & Robinson, 2000). Arthur
Rock, a legendary venture capitalist, DEMO
said, “Nearly every mistake I’ve made has
been in picking the DEMO people, not the
wrong idea” (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992, p.
6). Both angels and VCs feel that the
entrepreneur and the DEMO team (Van
Osnabrugge, 1998; MacMillan et al., 1987;
Van Osnabrugge & Robinson 2000) are the
two factors that attracts them to most deals.
Macmillan, et al., (1985), for example, found
DEMO for VCs the quality of the entrepreneur
ultimately determines the funding decision.
Some literature suggests that angels are more
attracted to the entrepreneur while DEMO
might be slightly more attracted to the idea
(Van Osnabrugge & DEMO, 2000). VCs,
for instance, often feel they can attract better
management to a deal if the deal is
fundamentally sound (Van Osnabrugge &
Robinson, 2000; Ehrlich, Noble, Moore, &
Weaver, 1994; Harrison & Mason, 1992;
Freear, Sohl, & Wetzel, 1997; Macmillan et
al.). Timmons and Spinelli (2004) stated DEMO
the management team can make the
difference in venture success.
Some literature suggests the management
team is the most important factor (Shepherd,
1999; Dixon, 1991; Macmillan et al., 1987).
Carter and Van DEMO (1992) found the
management team second only to the
entrepreneur in a survey of VCs consisting of
27 investment criteria. Clearly, the
entrepreneur and the management team are
very important criteria for the investment
decision DEMO both angels and VCs.
Understanding the entrepreneur and the team
are important in evaluating how angels and
VCs prioritize their investment criteria.
Understanding what DEMO angel
investors look for in the entrepreneur is the
next step to understand the investment
decision process.
91
Carter and Van Auken (1992) DEMO that out
of 27 investment criteria, VCs found
entrepreneur’s honesty ranked DEMO, and
entrepreneur’s commitment ranked second.
Van Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000)
performed a study of European start-up
investments that showed enthusiasm and
trustworthiness DEMO ranked first and second,
respectively out of twenty-seven investment
criteria for angels—see table 1.
Although VCs are more focused on a ROI
for DEMO limited partners, they still rank
trustworthiness and enthusiasm higher than
ROI. DEMO (1996) found that lack of trust
reduces investment by angels. Timmons and
Spinelli (2004) stated that the entrepreneur’s
commitment and determination are DEMO
important than any other factor when looking
for successful entrepreneurs. Benjamin and
Margulis (2000) stated that “Some investors
are motivated by the passionate DEMO
of the entrepreneur. People committed to a
venture can be persuasive; DEMO have
enthusiasm and solid entrepreneurial vision
[p. 95]” Benjamin and Margulis (DEMO)
combined the themes of passion,
commitment, and enthusiasm.
The DEMO of passion, commitment, and
enthusiasm are used interchangeably
throughout the literature (Coveney, 1996;
Timmons & Spinelli, 2004, Benjamin &
Margulis, 2000, Van Osnabrugge, 1998).
Hence, this study treats them DEMO the same
construct relative to characteristics of the
entrepreneur.
In addition, DEMO Osnabrugge and Robinson
(2000) found that expertise of the
entrepreneur, DEMO the entrepreneur upon
meeting, and track record were important
characteristics of DEMO entrepreneur.

have provided this same empirical research
for VC investors, thus, the next step is to
provide similar studies DEMO the angel
investment area. Therefore, this study will
focus on providing DEMO data regarding
the U.S. angel investor decision process. To
the author’s knowledge, this is the first study
to provide empirical data on how U.S. angel
investors rank investment criteria. Van

for this study is to identify U.S. angel
investment decision criteria. A secondary
objective of this study is to understand DEMO
U.S. angel investors prioritize their
investment criteria. Thus:
[Research Question]: DEMO do U.S. angel
investors prioritize their investment criteria?
STUDY OVERVIEW
There has been little research on how angel
investors select their investments (Elitzur &
Gavious, 2003). Understanding how angel
investors rank investment criteria DEMO the
relative importance of their perceptions will
help us understand the investment process
Journal of Small Business Strategy                                   Vol. 17, DEMO 2 Fall/Winter 2006/2007
better. The better we understand this process,
the more likely we can improve angel
investment process.
This study DEMO a two-phase approach to
understanding how angels make their
investment decisions. This two-phase
approach consisted of a qualitative first
phase and a quantitative second DEMO The
results of the first phase were intended to
help inform the second phase and develop
the quantitative instrument. (Miles &
Huberman, 1994; Greene, Caracelli, &
Graham, 1989). A participant-observer
methodology was utilized in the first phase
to collect data. In this case, the participant-
observer methodology involved the
researcher personally observing and
experiencing the angel DEMO as a
member. Patton (2002) discussed six key
advantages of the participant-observer
methodology. First, direct observation allows
the observer to understand and capture
interaction between people in context.
Second, it allows the observer to be open to
new information and be more inductive,
relying less on DEMO conceptualizations.
Third, one can see things unfold that may
routinely escape DEMO people involved in the
process. Fourth, the opportunity to learn
things DEMO observing that might not be
uncovered in interviews: sometimes, people
are less likely to discuss sensitive topics in a
direct interview that may DEMO observed in the
natural setting. Fifth, the ability to gather
data DEMO is not biased by an interviewer’s
selective perceptions. Finally, the process DEMO
the observations allows the observer to draw
on firsthand experiences during the formal
interpretations stage of analysis and
discussion.
In the case of the DEMO study, another
advantage of the participant-observer
methodology was complete access to DEMO
angel organization that the investors afforded
to the investigator. This allowed a more
natural observation versus an outsider to the
organization. An outsider’s results DEMO not
have been as accurate as members tend to
93
modify their comments when outsiders are
present. In addition, outsiders are not
allowed access to certain portions of
organization meetings due to legal issues
related to DEMO of information.
Accordingly the qualitative phase was
intended to create understanding of how
angels go about their investment process,
what they discuss, what seems important in
evaluating a start-up, and how they prioritize
their investment criteria. Collecting data
through this process helped to build the
survey for DEMO second phase of the study.
The second phase was quantitative and
consisted of surveying angels on what
criteria they use to make an investment DEMO
how these criteria are prioritized. Existing
literature was reviewed to identify any
previously used questionnaires on angel
investment criteria. This search identified
one such DEMO (Van Osnabrugge,
1998). Accordingly, in the phase two
quantitative investigation, a quantitative
questionnaire was developed based on the
phase one qualitative results and the Van
Osnabrugge (1998) instrument.
METHOD
This study was DEMO on observation and
survey of members of Tech Coast Angels
(TCA)DEMO TCA is the largest angel organization
in the U.S. consisting of 173 angels, as of
August 2004. TCA is located in Southern
California.
TCA members bring extensive and diverse
experience and networking resources to the
angel DEMO process. Since most of the
members have been entrepreneurs, they can
DEMO more than just a financial
perspective to start-up companies. As an
example, many can offer operating,
marketing, sales, and engineering experience
to the start-up company.
TCA does not invest as a whole but, rather,
each angel decides whether to independently
invest. The typical minimum investment DEMO
Journal of Small Business Strategy                                   Vol. 17, DEMO 2 Fall/Winter 2006/2007
angel is $25,000, although some DEMO allow
for lower amounts. As a whole, TCA
typically provides funding DEMO the range of
$250,000 to $1,000,000 per venture. This
financing garners from 10 to 40 percent
ownership of the company. The DEMO of the
transactions vary, but normally include
preferred stock, automatic conversion to
common stock at IPO, antidilution
provisions, voting rights, and a board seat.
As of August 2004, TCA had funded 81
companies with $52,707,836. In addition,
these companies have received additional
financing DEMO excess of $536,633,332 from
other sources.
The decision to invest in a company is often
affected by the impression the investor forms
DEMO the entrepreneur and the company in the
initial meeting. This initial meeting is often
called a screening. At a screening, the
entrepreneur presents their company plan
and answers questions for potential
investors. The screenings consist of DEMO
distinct sections. The first section is the
public portion which normally consists of the
entrepreneur presenting a PowerPoint slide
show for 15 minutes; the next 15 minutes are
dedicated to open question and answers. The
public DEMO typically consists of four
presentations by four different entrepreneurs.
The second section consists of a private
discussion where the angels discuss each
presentation. This DEMO portion provides
the most enlightening observations. The
angels effectively let down their guard
during this discussion and speak freely about
their perceptions of, concerns about, doubts
about, and interest in the project. Two-
hundred, fifty-nine companies were observed
at TCA screenings prior to the survey in
August DEMO The qualitative phase was
drawn from these screening observations.
The quantitative phase consisted of a survey
instrument that was developed to survey
TCA members DEMO how they rank their
investment criteria. The instrument was
developed based on themes that emerged
94
during the qualitative phase and the Van
Osnabrugge DEMO
In reviewing the Van Osnabrugge
instrument, there were many items that
DEMO appropriate to retain. Items
discussed in the TCA meetings that were
already on the Van Osnabrugge instrument
were retained.
The next step was to DEMO items that did not
seem appropriate for the TCA instrument.
Based on the qualitative phase of the study,
items were deleted based on DEMO rarely
being discussed in the screenings. In
addition, some items were DEMO,
redundant, or did not apply. In addition, item
terminology was modified to be more
aligned with U.S. angel culture. These items
were DEMO edited, not removed.
The last step was to add items that DEMO
in phase one of the study but were not on the
Van Osnabrugge instrument. The most
important item that was added was that of
DEMO “management team”. In addition, “barrier
for entry of competitors”, and “advisors
currently involved” were added. The
instrument consisted of a Likert scale with DEMO
being very important, and 1 being not
important.
A survey pilot DEMO tested with handful of
TCA members in July of 2004. After minor
modifications for clarification, the survey
was announced by the author at a monthly
dinner meeting in August 2004. The survey
was handed out to DEMO dinner attendees and
30 members filled out the survey at the
dinner and handed it back upon exiting. Two
emails regarding the survey were DEMO to the
membership after the dinner to encourage
more participation. The total sample size for
the survey was 173. In total, 73 members
responded, a response rate of 42 percent.
One survey was eliminated due to the
member not having made any investments,
therefore final sample size  was 72.

Qualitative Results
The purpose of the qualitative phase was to
identify important decision criteria of angels
that would be DEMO used in the
quantitative phase. Common themes
emerged from the observed screenings and
associated discussions . The angels
consciously focus most of their time DEMO
energy on four main themes. These themes
are: the passion of DEMO lead entrepreneur; the
trustworthiness of the lead entrepreneur; the
quality of the management team; and the
existence of an exit strategy or liquidity
potential for the investor.
Passion
Passion and commitment of the entrepreneur
emerged DEMO the most important criterion.
Investors look for entrepreneurs who show
passion. Entrepreneurs who demonstrated
this quality typically received more interest
than ones who may DEMO had a better
business model or product but lacked
passion. If the entrepreneur lacked passion or
enthusiasm, investors appeared to be less
interested. This may be due to the perception
that start-up success is so difficult DEMO
entrepreneurs without great commitment and
enthusiasm might be less likely to succeed.
In the angel’s mind, it appeared that
commitment and passion would translate into
business success.
Angels seemed particularly interested in
whether the entrepreneur was DEMO and
committed to do whatever it takes to work
through all of the problems of a start-up to
succeed. Angels found entrepreneurs with
passion DEMO commitment more engaging and
interesting. One entrepreneur that embodied
this kind of passion was a financial services
start-up that provided prepaid credit cards.
While DEMO entrepreneur did not have any
actual financial services experience, he
showed DEMO energy enthusiasm that
impressed the angels. In addition, he had
made DEMO money in past careers and
95
had put up most of his money, including
mortgaging his house, to start the company.
The passion DEMO perceived commitment of
this financial services entrepreneur garnered
excitement from the investors.
Trustworthiness
From the angels’ perspective, each
interaction between the entrepreneur and the
angels is an opportunity to build or break
down trust. The richest DEMO on this point
surfaced when the entrepreneurs were out of
the room. Some entrepreneurs benefited
when they admitted that they did not have an
DEMO to a specific question but would get
the answer later. Others appeared to
obfuscate, giving the angels sly answers.
Generally, the angels agreed DEMO if the
entrepreneur was avoiding the question, he
or she might DEMO be able to be trusted. The
entrepreneur failing to listen to the question
was problematic in its own right. In addition,
entrepreneurs who DEMO to provide
contradictory answers lost credibility and
trust. Some angels clearly stated they did not
trust a particular entrepreneur based on their
answers to DEMO and had no further
interest no matter how appealing the
business proposition was. A lack of trust
would often cancel out any of the DEMO
idea’s merits, growth potential, or ROI
potential in the minds of the angel investors.
The entrepreneur has to be trustworthy.
Management Team
In DEMO private portion of the discussion,
questions would often emerge as to whether
the management team was appropriate for
the project. This discussion typically
DEMO on whether all of the pieces of the
management team were in place. The
entrepreneur was not expected to be able to
do everything. DEMO, the angels did
expect the entrepreneur to know what the
shortcomings DEMO the current team were, and
what team members needed to be DEMO
As they did with the entrepreneur, the angels
Journal of Small Business Strategy                                   Vol. 17, DEMO 2 Fall/Winter 2006/2007
looked for passion and commitment in the
team. A team that appeared to have passion,
commitment, and an understanding of their
individual roles was a plus. In addition, on a
few occasions, a team that was part of a
previous successful team was a highly
regarded characteristic. For instance, a team
that had success building a product and was
then acquired by a large company was
DEMO as a winning combination.
While angels were less concerned about the
team being in place for start-ups that were
not very far along, they often asked
questions to uncover whether the
entrepreneur knew what type of DEMO was
needed for success. Accepting that the
management team is an important attribute,
the next step is to understand what
characteristics of the DEMO team are
important to the angel investor. Coachablity
of the team was one primary theme that was
discussed. Teams that were perceived as not
DEMO were less likely to advance to due
diligence phase of the process. Another
aspect that was commonly discussed was the
commitment of the team. DEMO was often
described as survivability. Investors liked
teams that struggled through hard times and
kept pursuing the venture. An example of a
team that DEMO considered to have high
survivability was one that had been working
their venture out of the garage for a long
time to keep overhead DEMO The perception
by the angels was that the team would do
whatever it took to succeed. As with the
entrepreneur, passion was discussed in
relation to the team. Investors found that
passion was not just necessary DEMO the
entrepreneur but in the team as a whole.
Other themes that emerged were: experience
of advisors, complementary skills of the
advisors, track record of the individuals on
the team, and experience of the team
working together.
Exit
Angels primarily invest to receive a return on
their DEMO Since angel investments usually
96
have a 4-6 year horizon (Mason & Harrison,
2002), and return is typically only attained
through an exit or liquidity event, angels
seek ventures that will grow and be attractive
to acquirers or have the possibility of an
initial public offering (IPO). Since IPO’s are
rare, angels are very interested in learning
who the potential acquirers may be for a
particular venture. While observing
DEMO presentations at TCA, it was not
uncommon to observe a start-up DEMO had
already demonstrated profitability, had a
solid business plan, and was led by an
entrepreneur with a proven track record but
did not DEMO much interest due to an
unclear exit path.
In one example, DEMO company had clearly
identified potential acquirers and a potential
sale price of the firm. Included in this were
the potential returns the investors could
DEMO from various acquirers upon
liquidation. In addition, this entrepreneur had
been DEMO of a company that was built and
sold within the industry, DEMO he understood
who would be interested, why they would
want to DEMO a company, and
approximately how much they would invest.
Again, since angels can only attain a return
on their investment through a liquidity DEMO,
there is often a focus on who and why
someone would want to purchase the start-
up. The main theme for angels was DEMO
how the start-up reached an exit. The general
feeling was if there is good growth in the
company and there are likely exit paths, then
the ROI will come.
In yet another example, a company did not
have any information on exit in their
presentation. When the entrepreneur DEMO
asked about their exit path, he responded “I
believe we can DEMO an IPO”. This statement
yielded strong feelings in the post-
presentation discussion among angels. An
IPO is such a rare event, that it caused angels
to feel that the entrepreneur had not thought
about a viable DEMO plan. Watching this
process helped make it clear that the best
business plan or idea might not be perceived
Journal of Small Business Strategy                                   Vol. 17, DEMO 2 Fall/Winter 2006/2007
as the best investment.
Other Themes Identified
Throughout observation of the screenings,
many other themes emerged. These included:DEMO
barrier to entry of competitors; intellectual
property; growth potential; competition;DEMO
profitability; what advisors were involved;
domain knowledge of the investor DEMO to
the start-up; and ROI. However, these
themes were not as consistent nor did they
carry the intensity of the four themes
mentioned DEMO Also, some investors
focused on specific criteria across all
screening candidates. DEMO instance, one
investor asked nearly every entrepreneur
how much of their DEMO money was invested.
When this investor was absent from a
screening, DEMO question was not consistently
asked. Some investors often focused on
functional areas of the business such as
finance, marketing or on intellectual
property. This was often due to their
professional background. For example,
someone who DEMO a finance background
might focus on issues related to the financial
projections. In addition, through interviews,
it was uncovered that some investors were
biased towards certain criteria based on
previous investment success or failure. For
DEMO, one investor focused on
understanding the competition, since he had
previous investments fail due to competitor
issues.
Quantitative Results
The results of the DEMO phase confirm
the results in the qualitative phase, with
trustworthiness (4.81), management team
(4.64), enthusiasm (4.63), and exit (4.53)
ranking as the top four criteria (5 being very
important, DEMO being not important). These
results were expected based on the
qualitative phase, however, there were no
significant differences between the top 4
DEMO and the next items in the survey.
With the exception of the “management
97
team” item which was added for the
purposes of this DEMO, the results are similar
to those of Van Osnabrugge (1998) DEMO
found enthusiasm ranked first, and
trustworthiness ranked second. This study’s
results DEMO enthusiasm ranked third, and
trustworthiness ranked first. The
management team ranked DEMO in this
study. In addition, exit, which emerged as a
top theme in the qualitative portion of the
study, ranked fourth in the survey. Van
Osnabrugge found exit to be twenty-fourth.
Table 2 shows the DEMO of the survey
items.
Most venture capital literature shows the
management team ranking high in
investment criteria. This study shows the

is an important investment criterion. The
literature lacks DEMO on which attributes of
the management team are important. This
study shows passion (4.71), survivability

The sample was DEMO male
(males=68, females=4). Since there were
only four females in the study, no analysis
was performed related to gender differences.
The mean age of the investors was 53.7

business with a minimum of five employees
and stayed in business DEMO at least three years
(N=69). The mean level of education DEMO
2.83 (N=72, 1=high school diploma, 2=
bachelors degree, 3=masters degree, 4=PhD).
The distribution of the highest degree
completed were as follows: 11 PhDs, 41
Masters, 17 bachelors, and three high school

The mean number of investments made were
10.54 (DEMO, low=1, high=50). Of those
investments, 48% had no exit DEMO, 32% had a
negative return, and 20% had a positive
return (N=71). Analysis was performed to
see if there was a relationship between
investment experience (based on number of
investments) and criteria rankings. DEMO
analysis showed no significant relationship
between investor experience and criteria
rankings. However, if we group number of
investments by least experience (up to DEMO
investments), medium experience (6-15
investments), and most experience (over 15
investments), “honesty” was rated as very
important by 71 percent DEMO least experienced
investors, 82 percent of those with medium
experience, and 93 percent of those with the
most investing experience. Only 58 percent
DEMO least experienced investors rated
enthusiasm as highly important criterion,
compared to 71 percent for investors with
more than five investments. The mean year
DEMO starting investing was 1991 (oldest 1971,
most recent 2004, N=72). The mean total
investment amount per angel was $1,610,363
(N=69). However, there were three total
investment amounts of $25,000,000,
$20,000,000, and $18,000,000, which were
DEMO who also do VC investing. If we
remove these investments, the DEMO total
investment amount per investor was
$729,015 (N=66). Again, analysis was
performed to see if there was a relationship
between investment DEMO (based on
investment amount) and criteria rankings.

The mean years to expected liquidity were

weight the importance of motivation based
on three categories. The means were 62.85%
for return on DEMO, 21.70% for helping
build companies, and 15.45% for mentoring
entrepreneurs (DEMO).
DISCUSSION
The primary focus of this study was to
identify US angel investment decision
criteria. Secondary focus was to understand
how U.S. angel DEMO prioritize
investment criteria. There has been little
empirical research that provides insight on
how U.S. angel investors rank their
investment criteria (Wetzel, 1987; Harr,
Starr, & MacMillan, 1988).
Confirming the results of DEMO qualitative
phase of the research, the most important
findings in the DEMO phase were that
TCA Angel investors rank trustworthiness,
enthusiasm, and DEMO management team high
in their investment criteria. As such, this
study DEMO results similar to the Van
Osnabrugge (1998) survey. Greater
understanding of how investors prioritize
their investment criteria will allow us to
build better DEMO diligence processes and
potentially improve the overall investment
process and resulting outcomes.
This study brings new information to light
with regard to how important DEMO

management team is to the investor. There is
much research which has focused on the
entrepreneur. It seems logical DEMO the
entrepreneur may be the single most
important member of the management team.
However, the team is usually very important
to the success of a new venture.
Understanding more about how investors
perceive a good management DEMO will help
us understand the investment process in
more depth. This study showed that the
combination of passion and commitment was
the most important DEMO for the
management team from the investor point of
view. This result makes sense since
enthusiasm of the entrepreneur ranked third
in the investment DEMO Clearly, investors
feel that passion is necessary to attain
success. This DEMO be explained by the often
grueling and difficult process entrepreneurs
go through to build a company. A
management team without strong passion
may not DEMO enough drive to go the long
haul. The second attribute for a management
team is survivability. This goes hand-in-hand
with passion. A successful management DEMO
of a start-up needs to have passion for what
they are doing and strong drive to survive the
challenges they will encounter. This finding
DEMO the need to further understand the
soft side of the investment process.
Trustworthiness, enthusiasm, passion of the
team, and sense of team survivability are all
qualitative aspects of investment criteria.
The results of this study DEMO from the Van
Osnabrugge (1998) survey in a number of
ways. Since there is little literature
comparing US and U.K. angel investors, we
cannot draw any clear conclusion regarding
the distinctions. However, a few differences
between this study and the Van Osnabrugge
(1998) survey should be DEMO Although this
survey consisted of only 72 angels from one
angel organization, it is the first U.S.-based
angel investment criteria survey. It might not
be possible to generalize this organization to
all U.S. angels; however, DEMO the angels of
this organization invest independently of
each other and are from diverse
100
backgrounds, some generalizabilty may be
suggested. Two items which were rated near
opposite ends of the scale by U.S. and U.K.
DEMO were “Potential exit routes” and
“Liked entrepreneur upon meeting”. U.S.
angels rated “Potential exit routes” at fourth,
while U.K. angels rated it twenty-fourth. DEMO
potential explanation for this may be a focus
by U.S. investors on success in the
investment process. If a new venture does
not have DEMO clear exit path, it is unlikely to be
successful and bring DEMO return to the
investor. This may also explain why U.S.
angels rated “Liked entrepreneur upon
meeting” fourteenth, while U.K. angels rated
it fifth. The perception of TCA investors is
that almost all of the deals funded DEMO
expected to need venture capital investment.
The venture capital model typically allows
for the entrepreneur to be replaced. It is
possible that TCA investors DEMO not
concerned whether they like the
entrepreneurs but whether they can be
trusted and if the venture is likely to be
successful. In addition, angels who are part
of a formalized investment association may
be more DEMO motivated by ROI rather than
mentoring entrepreneurs or building
companies. Additional, DEMO weaker,
support for this assertion is that this study
showed ROI ranked eighth by U.S. angels
and eleventh by U.K. angels.
There are DEMO potential logical steps
beyond this study. First, a larger sample
could DEMO attained to verify the findings here.
Second, the top criteria could DEMO studied in
more depth. Understanding how investors
form their perceptions of these top criteria
may allow us to develop a better process in
evaluating DEMO constructs. Third, a
longitudinal study could be initiated that
tracks investments DEMO how investors rank
these criteria to see if there are any
correlations with the investment criteria and
success in the venture. Due to many DEMO
forces that may lead to start-up failure such
as market shifts, DEMO regulations
changes, and unanticipated competitor
moves, developing a high correlation
Journal of Small Business Strategy                                   Vol. 17, DEMO 2 Fall/Winter 2006/2007
between investment criteria and success may
prove to be difficult.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
There are practical implications for both
entrepreneurs DEMO investors in this study.
First, entrepreneurs need to realize that a
DEMO idea alone is not enough to obtain
funding. How an entrepreneur manages the
presentation to investors, answers questions,
and facilitates the relationship through the
process will have an impact on securing
funding. Second, entrepreneurs need to build
a management team that investors are willing
to trust and DEMO in. It is important that the
entrepreneur communicate about the team to
the investors. Third, entrepreneurs need to
clearly communicate an exit strategy for
investors so that they can see an eventual
return on their investment. DEMO, investors
need to be aware how faulty first impressions
can be DEMO the initial stages of meeting an
entrepreneur. Jumping to conclusions on
how trustworthy and passionate the
entrepreneur is needs to be evaluated through
the DEMO diligence process. Angels tend to
spend most of their time in the due diligence
process evaluating the quantitative side of
the deal; more time spent on the qualitative
side, or soft side, might lead to DEMO
investments. Angel investors should consider
utilizing new techniques to evaluate the soft
side of the deal rather than just their gut
feeling. Effective human DEMO assessment
tools appear not to be prevalent in the start-
up area, therefore, more rigorous interview
techniques and entrepreneur background
reviews may be DEMO
LIMITATIONS
The major limitation of this study is the fact
that only one angel investing organization
was surveyed. Although TCA is one of the
DEMO angel organizations in the country
and, therefore, may be a good sample for
predicting the behavior of the U.S. angel
population, extending the survey to other
organizations and individual angel investors
101
would increase the DEMO of the study. Also,
inherent in any self-reported survey is the
issue of accuracy and bias. It is possible that
some investors may DEMO biased their
answers to a more socially acceptable
orientation. As with any self-reporting
survey there is no opportunity to verify the
accuracy of the DEMO In addition, the
participant-observer process utilized in the
qualitative phase can DEMO susceptible to bias,
inaccurate perceptions, and selective
perceptions.
CONCLUSION
This DEMO addresses an important gap in
current academic literature on angel
investors. This study surveyed U.S. angel
investors to help understand how they
evaluate and DEMO their investment
criteria. This study highlights the importance
of the passion of the lead entrepreneur, the
management team, trustworthiness of the
lead entrepreneur, and a reasonable exit
strategy as the most important ingredients for
angel DEMO This study takes the next
step in understanding what angel investors
are looking for from the management team.
Passion, survivability, and openness to
DEMO are the top three ingredients for
the management team.
A greater understanding of how angel
investors make their investment decisions
will allow them to DEMO how their due
diligence processes align with their
investment decisions. This in turn will lead
to a better investment process. Additionally,
entrepreneurs will DEMO a better
understanding of what angel investors are
looking for.
