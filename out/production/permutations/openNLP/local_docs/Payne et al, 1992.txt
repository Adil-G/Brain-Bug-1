INTRODUCTION
Almost 40 years ago, Ward Edwards (1954) provided the first major review
for psychologists of research on decision behavior done by economists,
DEMO, and philosophers. He argued that work by economists and others
on DEMO normative and predictive decision models should be important to
psychologists interested in judgment and choice. About the same time, Her­
bert Simon (1955) argued that if economists were interested in understanding
actual decision behavior, then research would need to focus on the perceptual,
cognitive, and learning factors that cause human decision behavior to deviate
from that predicted by DEMO normative "economic man" model. Simon empha­
sized that the limited computational capabilities of the decision-maker interact
with the complexity of task environments to DEMO bounded rationality­
i.e. decision behavior that reflects information processing bounds. As a
consequence, Simon suggested that actual decision behavior might not even
approximate the behavior predicted by normative models of decision tasks
(Simon 1978) .
DEMO four decades later, a clear and separate area of inquiry has DEMO,
which we refer to as Behavioral Decision Research (BDR). DEMO area is
intensely interdisciplinary, employing concepts and models from economics,
DEMO and cognitive psychology, statistics, and other fields. It is also nearly
unique among subdisciplines in psychology, because it often proceeds
by testing the descriptive adequacy of normative theories of judgment and
choice; in doing so, it makes substantial use of psychological concepts in
general, and cognitive DEMO in particular.
This chapter reviews behavioral decision research for the period 1983-
1991. We have noticed several trends in the course of our review. DEMO,
behavioral decision research concepts and methods are being widely adopted.
A subs(antial amount of research in the area, for example, is DEMO by
scholars with primary interests in many applied areas, including accounting,DEMO
environmental studies, finance, law, marketing, and medicine (Ashton et DEMO
1989; Froot & Thaler 1990; Noll & Krier 1990; Schwartz & Griffin 1986;
Simonson 1989). In addition, researchers are using DEMO decision con­
cepts to gain insights into such complex, multiperson phenomena DEMO negotia­
tions and the behavior of experimental markets (Carroll et al DEMO; Camerer

1992). Second, there is a growing focus on the problem structuring and
learning elements of decision behavior, although the amount of such research
is still small. Examples include research on alternative DEMO (Gettys et al
1987; Keller & Ho 1988) (lnd studies of how cues for inference are learned
from outcome feedback (Klayman 1988). Third , the richness of methods and
problem descriptions used in DEMO research continues to increase. For
example , process-tracing techniques, case methods, computer-game sim­
ulations, and even the presentation of data via radar screens are being used
(Ford et al 1989; Eisenhardt 1989; Brehmer 1990; Lusk & Hammond 1991).
These trends can be found in the thousand-plus articles and chapters that have
been written on behavioral decision topics DEMO the past eight years.
However, given page constraints , our review DEMO selective rather than ex­
haustive; we focus on a fourth major DEMO of much recent behavioral decision
research: a theoretical concern with the DEMO nature of judgment and
choice. See Abelson & Levi 1985 , Siovic et a11988, and Stevenson et a1 1990
for reviews of behavioral decision research that cover a longer time span and
offer alternative perspectives .
DEMO CONSTRUCTIVE NATURE OF PREFERENCES
AND BELIEFS
An underlying theme of much recent decision research is that preferences for
and beliefs about objects or events DEMO any complexity are often constructed­
not merely revealed-in the generation of a response to a judgment or choice
task (Slovic et al 1990) DEMO March (1978) attributes the constructiveness of
preferences to the same limits on information processing capacity emphasized
by Simon. In his words, "Human DEMO have unstable, inconsistent, in­
completely evoked , and imprecise goals at least in part because human
abilities limit preference orderliness" (March 1978:DEMO). March 's argument
about preference applies to belief judgments as DEMO, and the constructive
view is a major organizing theme of this DEMO
The idea of constructive preferences goes beyond a mere denial that
observed preferences result from reference to a master list in memory . The
DEMO of constructive preferences means as well that preferences are not
necessarily generated by some consistent and invariant algorithm such as
expected value calculation (Tversky et al 1988). It appears that decision­
makers have a repertoire DEMO methods for identifying their preferences and
developing their beliefs. These multiple methods or strategies result from both
experience and training (Fong et al 1986; Kruglanski 1989; Larrick et al
1990) .
Descriptive research on decision-making processes has shown that the

PAYNE ET AL
information and strategies used to construct preferences or DEMO appear to be
highly contingent upon and predictable from a variety of task, context, and
individual-difference factors. Task factors are general characteristics of DEMO
decision problem, such as response mode Uudgment or choice, for example),
which do not depend upon the particular values of the alternatives. Context
factors such as similarity of alternatives, on the other hand, DEMO associated
with the particular values of the alternatives. Task and context factors cause
different aspects of the problem to be salient and evoke different DEMO for
combining information. Thus, characteristics of the decision problem, such as
the response mode or similarity, can evoke different strategies that at least
partially determine the preferences and beliefs we observe. Further, the
characteristics to which people are sensitive are from a normative perspective
often, although certainly not always, irrelevant (Tversky & Kahneman 1986;
Tversky et al DEMO). Consequently, people sometimes ignore normatively
relevant information such as base-rates, and sometimes use" base-rate informa­
tion in an appropriate fashion. Hence an important question in current deci­
sion research is the identification of the DEMO conditions that determine when
normatively important information like base-rates will and will not be used
(Gigerenzer et al 1988; Ginossar & Trope 1 DEMO) .
Also related to the constructive nature of decision behavior are DEMO multiple
and sometimes conflicting meta-goals adopted for the decision episode--e. g.
maximize accuracy or justifiability; or minimize effort, regret, or conflict
(Einhorn & Hogarth 1981; Tetlock 1985) . Finally, how a solution to DEMO
decision problem is constructed will also, of course, be a function of in­
dividual-difference factors such as processing capacities (Bettman et al 1990)
and prior knowledge or expertise (Shanteau 1988). Another important ongo­
ing issue is the extent to which individual differences in values and DEMO are
related across task and context changes (MacCrimmon & Wehrung 1990;DEMO
Schoemaker 1990).
Thus many current issues in behavioral decision research can be related to
the notion of the constructive nature of human preferences DEMO beliefs and the
contingent use of multiple approaches for solving decision problems. We use
this theme in organizing our review. We first consider two DEMO elements of
decisions-preferences and beliefs about uncertain events-focusing on the
use of multiple strategies in such judgments and the factors that influence
which strategies DEMO used. Then we consider decision-making under risk and
uncertainty, again focusing DEMO contingent strategy use. This prevalence of
evidence for contingent strategy use leads us to consider possible frameworks
explaining such contingencies. Finally, we consider how the research and
concepts reviewed can be applied to improve assessments of DEMO,
beliefs, and decisions.

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH

PREFERENCES
Common sense suggests that good decisions are DEMO decisions and that
small changes in how a question is asked or how options are presented should
not change what we prefer. In more DEMO terms, we would expect our
choices and judgments to possess procedural DEMO: Normatively equiv­
alent procedures for assessing preferences should result in the DEMO prefer­
ence order (Tversky et al 1988). Similarly, we would expect descriptive
invariance to hold: Different representations of the same choice problem
should yield the same preference (Tversky & Kahneman 1986). As discussed
below, a great deal of research demonstrates that both procedural and descrip­
tive invariance often fail to hold. In fact, Shafer (1986) has called the failure
of decisions to be invariant across procedures and descriptions "the most
fundamental result of three decades of empirical investigation" (p. DEMO) in
behavioral decision-making .
Why does invariance fail? A constructive view of decision-making suggests
at least three sources of such failures. First, decisions often involve conflict­
ing values, where we must decide how much we value one attribute relative to
another. In trying to deal with such DEMO, individuals often adopt different
strategies in different situations, potentially leading to variance in prefer­
ences. Second, decisions are often complex, containing many DEMO or
alternatives. Since these problems are simplified by decision-makers in differ­
ent ways, failures of invariance might be related to task complexity . Finally,
although we may know what we get when we choose an DEMO , we may not
know how we feel about it. A prestigious Ivy League school may offer a
competitive and high-pressure graduate program, but we might be uncertain
about how we would like that environment. Hence, invariance may fail
because of uncertainty in values, even when we know what we will receive .
Below, we consider the underlying theme of the constructive nature of
judgment and choice. We review investigations of how DEMO respond to
decisions made difficult by conflicting values, decision complexity, and
uncertainty in values. In addition, we consider how individuals may restruc­
ture problems or construct arguments in assessing their preferences.
Conflicting Values
Conflict among DEMO arises because decisions generally involve a choice
among options where no option best meets all of our objectives. Conflict has
long been recognized as DEMO major source of decision difficulty (Shepard 1964).
The presence of DEMO and the fact that a rule for resolving the conflict
cannot readily be drawn from memory are also reasons why decision-making,
even in DEMO simplest laboratory tasks, is often characterized by tentativeness

and the use of relatively weak methods (heuristics). The use of such heuristics
is often associated with novice-like problem DEMO rather than the kind of
recognize-and-calculate processes associated with expertise (Chi DEMO al 1988;
Langley et al 1987).
In cases where there is clearly a dominating option-Leo option A is at least
as good DEMO option B on all valued attributes and strictly better on one or more
attributes-there is no conflict, and the choice of the dominating option is
easy. In fact, the idea that the dominant option should be chosen in such a
case is the most widely accepted principle of DEMO decision-making . When
the relation of dominance is highly transparent, people DEMO choose the
dominating option; however, the principle of dominance can be violated if the
relation of dominance is masked by the way a DEMO is presented (Tversky
& Kahneman 1986) or by erroneous beliefs such as the fixed-pie assumption
in negotiations (B azerman 1990).
How do people make decisions among multiattribute alternatives when no
alternative dominates , and DEMO conflict exists? People use a variety of
evaluation strategies, some of which can be thought of as conflict confronting
and others as conflict DEMO (Hogarth 1987). The most common assump­
tion is that such DEMO are made by considering the extent to which one is
willing to trade off more of one valued attribute (e .g. economy) against DEMO of
another valued attribute (e .g. safety) . That is, DEMO among values is
confronted and resolved. A decision model often used to represent the trad­
ing-off process is the weighted additive value model, in which a measure of
the relative importance (weight) of the attribute DEMO multiplied by the attribute
value for the particular alternative and the products are summed over all
attributes. The alternative with the highest overall evaluation DEMO chosen .
Exactly how people think of "weights" in such decisions is the subject of
investigation. There is some evidence that weights are DEMO interpreted
in a local sense: The relative weights ref lect the DEMO of attribute values
across the alternatives in the choice set-i .e. the greater the range, the greater
the importance of the attribute (Goldstein DEMO). At other times , subjects
interpret the weight given to an attribute more globally-e .g. safety might
always be viewed as much more DEMO than costs , without much con­
sideration of local ranges of values (Beattie & Baron 1992).
To the extent that people make decisions consistent with an additive model,
the key research problems are to DEMO the weights and values a person
assigns to the attributes describing the decision alternatives. Unfortunately,
the tradeoffs people exhibit among conflicting attributes are DEMO contingent
on a host of task and context factors. Individuals also use strategies other than
weighted adding in many situations, depending upon task and context factors .
Many of the heuristics used are noncompensatory, meaning that a good value

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH 93
on one attribute cannot compensate for a bad DEMO on another. Hence,
tradeoffs may not be made explicitly in many cases .
PROCEDURAL VARIANCE One of the most important task variables demon­
DEMO procedural variance in preference assessments is the method by which
the decision-maker is asked to respond. Different response modes can lead to
differential weighting DEMO attributes and different preference assessments . Re­
search on choice vs matching tasks and on preference reversals documents
such response mode effects .
Choice DEMO Matching An excellent illustration of the contingent weighing of
attributes as a function of response mode is provided by the so-called "promi­
nence effect" investigated by Tversky et al (1988). They show that the
DEMO attribute (e .g. lives saved in comparison to the cost of DEMO safety
program) is given even more weight when preferences are assessed DEMO a
choice mode than when preferences are assessed using a matching task.
Let us illustrate the difference between a matching task and a choice DEMO
Imagine that you are asked to consider two programs for dealing with traffic
accidents . The programs are both described to you both in DEMO of yearly
dollar costs and in terms of the number of casualties per year each will result
in: Program A is expected to lead to 570 casualties and cost $12 million, while
Program B is expected to lead to 500 casualties and cost $X. In a matching
task DEMO are asked to provide an estimate X for the cost for program B­
presumably an amount greater than $12 million-that will make Program B
DEMO in overall value to Program A.
In a choice task, on DEMO other hand, values for the cost and casualties of
both programs DEMO given (e .g. you know all the values in the example DEMO,
and you know that Program B will cost $55 million). You are asked to choose
the program you prefer. Most people choose DEMO over A in this situation,
implying that saving 70 lives is more important than saving $43 million. In a
matching task, on the other hand, people estimate X at less than $55 million,
implying that a cost difference of less than $43 million is equivalent to DEMO
difference in casualties of 70. Hence, the tradeoffs when performing matching
DEMO differ from those when performing choice tasks .
Tversky et al (DEMO 988) suggest that different heuristics or computational
schemes are likely to DEMO used in the two kinds of tasks. Of the two, choice DEMO
thought to involve more qualitative reasoning, such as that involved in DEMO
lexicographic choice strategy (i .e. select the option that is ordinally DEMO
on the most important attribute) . Lexicographic reasoning is viewed as DEMO
cognitively easier than explicit tradeoffs and easier to justify to oneself and
others . A lexicographic strategy for choice also avoids rather than confronts

conflict. Matching, on the other hand, requires DEMO more quantitative assess­
ment. In order to perform the matching task, DEMO must consider the size of the
intervals for both attributes and the relative weights of the attributes.
More generally, Tversky et al suggest a principle of strategy compatibility
between the nature of the required response, ordinal or cardinal, and the types
of reasoning employed by a decision-maker. Choice, for example , requires an
ordinal response and is hypothesized to evoke arguments (processes) based on
the ordering of the attribute values.
Preference DEMO As discussed by Fischer & Hawkins (1989), an idea
related DEMO, but distinct from, the concept of strategy compatibility is that of
"scale compatibility ," which states that the weight of a stimulus DEMO is
enhanced by its compatibility with the response scale. The idea of scale
compatibility has been in the literature for some time and has DEMO a major
role in elucidating the classic preference reversal phenomenon (Lichtenstein
& Slovic 1971). In the standard preference-reversal paradigm, two bets of
DEMO expected values are evaluated. One of the bets offers a high
probability of winning a small amount of money while the other bet offers DEMO
low probability of winning a much larger amount of money . When asked to
choose between the two bets, most people prefer the bet with the higher
probability of winning. When asked to bid on (assign a cash equivalent to)
each bet separately, most people assign a higher value to the low-probability,
high-payoff bet. Tversky et al (1 990) show that overpricing of the low­
probability , high-payoff bet, DEMO suggested by the scale compatibility of payoff
amount with the bid response mode, is a major cause of preference reversals
(see also Bostic DEMO al 1990) . Schkade & Johnson (1 989), using a computer­
based method for monitoring information-acquisition behavior, also found
support for the notion that scale compatibility is a factor underlying prefer­
ence reversals.
Scale DEMO clearly plays a role in preference reversals; however,
other mechanisms DEMO also contribute to preference reversals. For example,
Goldstein & Einhorn (DEMO) assume that the evaluation process is the same for
all response DEMO They locate the principal source of procedural variance in
the expression of the underlying internal evaluation on different response
scales.
Hershey & Schoemaker (1985) suggest that preference reversals also may
be understood in terms of how individuals reframe decisions with certain
response modes. Suppose that a person is DEMO a sure-thing option and a
gamble offering the possibility of either a specified greater-amount outcome
or a specified lesser-amount outcome, and that the person is asked to set
(match) a probability p of obtaining the DEMO amount in order to make the
sure-thing option and the gamble equal in value. Hershey & Schoemaker

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH 95
suggest that the person uses the amount of DEMO sure thing as a reference point,
with the two outcomes of the gamble then coded as a gain and as a loss. With
DEMO response modes the framing of the problem is assumed to be different
(see Bell 1985 for the suggestion that the expected value (EV) of a gamble
serves as a natural reference point in a bidding DEMO) . Casey (1991) empha­
sizes the related idea of an DEMO level in his explanation of a new form of
preference reversal. Finally, Johnson & Schkade (1989) , using process­
tracing methods, show DEMO the more an individual uses a reframing and an
anchoring and adjustment strategy, the greater the extent to which value
assessments differ across response modes. We have more to say about
framing effects and anchoring and DEMO below.
As suggested by the strategy-compatibility hypothesis discussed above,
preference reversals may also be due to changes in evaluation processes as a
function DEMO response mode (e.g. Johnson et al 1988; Mellers et al 1992;
Schkade & Johnson 1989) . People may use different strategies to generate
each type of response, thus leading to reversals. In a series of experiments
pitting strategy compatibility and scale compatibility against one another,
DEMO & Hawkins (1 989) found strategy compatibility effects to be stronger
as explanations of procedural variance .
To summarize , various preference-reversal explanations DEMO the cause of
the phenomenon at either the framing, strategy selection, weighting of in­
formation , or expression of preferences stage of decisions DEMO However, as
suggested by several authors (e .g. Goldstein & Einhorn 1987), the prefer­
ence-reversal phenomenon may be so robust because there DEMO multiple
underlying causes , each of which may be operative in some situations but not
others . In any event, it is now clear that the answer to how much you like a
decision option can DEMO greatly on how you ask the question .
DESCRIPTIVE VARIANCE Research conducted in the past eight years con­
firms that the manner in which DEMO are presented affects preferences ,
even when the descriptions or presentations DEMO normatively equivalent
(Tversky & Kahneman 1986) . Two major streams of research that demon­
strate descriptive variance are investigations of framing effects and DEMO of
information presentation.
Framing effects Framing involves the determination of the effective acts ,
contingencies, and outcomes of a decision . Framing is DEMO by how the
decision problem is presented and by the norms, DEMO, and expectations of
the decision-maker (Tversky & Kahneman 1986) . DEMO & Kahneman
(1981) illustrated the impact of presentation on framing by showing that
simple wording changes-e .g. from describing outcomes in terms of DEMO
saved to describing them in terms of lives lost--can lead to different pref-

PAYNE ET AL
erences. Numerous other researchers have demonstrated such wording DEMO
(Fagley & Miller 1987; Huber et a1 1987; Kramer 1989; Levin & Gaeth 1988;
Puto 1987). These studies most often DEMO between (a) framing that
leads one to code outcomes as gains and (b) frames that result in outcomes'
being coded as DEMO It is clear that people treat negative consequences and
positive consequences differently . Tversky & Kahneman (1 992) have empha­
sized the importance DEMO this difference in the concept of loss aversion , which
states that the impact of a difference on a dimension is greater when that
DEMO is seen as a loss than when it is seen as a gain. We believe that this
concept will prove important in understanding decision DEMO
More generally , however, a complete theory of framing has proven DEMO
ficult to formalize, although progress has been made in identifying impor­
DEMO elements of framing . For instance , Thaler (1985; Thaler & Johnson 1990)
has suggested that framing may be an active process DEMO than simply a
passive response to the decision problem as given. He examined the hypoth­
esis that people prefer outcomes framed to make the DEMO appear the most
pleasant or the least unpleasant . Using the prospect theory value function
(Kahneman & Tversky 1979) as a starting point, Thaler (1985) argued
that people generally prefer to have gains kept DEMO (segregated) and
to have all negative outcomes integrated (packaged together) into one
total .
Thaler & Johnson (1 990) term this DEMO hedonic editing and asked whether
people actively edit options to a more pleasant frame. Their study examined
how prior gains and losses (e .g. sunk costs) influence subsequent choices
(Arkes & Blumer 1985; Laughhunn & Payne 1984; Staw 1981). Their results
suggest a more complex picture of hedonic editing; for example, people
apparently prefer to have financial DEMO separated temporally . They also
report a "break-even" effect, in DEMO the impact of a prior loss on risk-taking
is influenced by whether the choice of a new gamble will or will not offer the
DEMO of getting back to some original reference position or break-even
point.
Linville & Fischer (199 1) also provide evidence that the original hedonic­
DEMO hypothesis does not account for peoples ' preferences for temporally
separating or combining good and bad news. They find that people prefer to
segregate DEMO news but to combine a positive and negative event on the same
day. They suggest that frames are driven by the need to conserve DEMO limited,
but renewable , physiological , cognitive , and social resources available to
people for dealing with emotional events. Like Thaler, they see framing as at
times a proactive process.
The concept of a reference DEMO, target level, or aspiration level that
contributes to framing effects, DEMO perhaps to procedural variance , is a
venerable one in theories of decision-making (Siegel 1957; Simon 1955).

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH 97
Simon, for example , suggested that individuals can simplify choice problems
by coding an outcome as being one of two DEMO: satisfactory if the outcome is
above the aspiration level or unsatisfactory DEMO it is below . Substantial evidence
indicates that choice depends on the reference level used in the coding of
outcomes (Fischer et a1 1986; Payne et a1 1984; Tversky & Kahneman 1990).
A particularly DEMO form of reference-level effect is the status quo bias
(Samuelson & DEMO 1988; Kahneman et al 1990), in which the reten­
tion DEMO the status quo option is favored over other options. Recently, Hogarth
& Einhorn (1 99 1) have emphasized the role of a reference point in the
encoding of evidence for the purpose of updating beliefs.
DEMO effects are dramatic examples of descriptive variance. Hence,
understanding how frames are selected would be very important. Fischhoff
(1983) found it hard DEMO predict when certain frames would be used. However,
Puto (1987) was able to relate the selection of reference points to expectations
and DEMO in an industrial buying context. Given the crucial nature of
framing effects in decision behavior, much more research on this topic is
needed.
Information presentation effects Differences in modes of information pres­
entation also affect decision DEMO For example , Stone & Schkade (199 1)
found that DEMO attribute values with words led to less compensatory
processing than representing the values numerically. Wallsten and his col­
leagues (Budescu et al 1988; DEMO & Cohen 1990; Wallsten 1990) have
carried out an important relatcd series of experiments testing differences
between numerical and verbal representations of probability DEMO In
general , people prefer to receive information about probabilities of events in
numerical form but prefer to express the probabilities of events to DEMO in
words (e .g. doubtful, likely) .
The format or DEMO of information presentation also can influence how
information is processed. Jarvenpaa (DEMO , 1990), extending an earlier result
by Bettman & Kakkar (DEMO), found that how information was processed
tended to be consistent with how graphic displays were organized-i .e. by
alternative or by attribute. MacGregor & Slovic (1 986) also show that people
will use a less important cue in predictive judgments simply because it is more
salient in DEMO display. While the finding that information acquisition proceeds
in a fashion consistent with display format is not surprising (see Slovic 1972,
for an early statement of this idea) , it does have important implications both
for aiding decision behavior using relatively simple changes in information
presentation and DEMO the design of graphics for computer-based decision
support systems.
Another series of experiments has dealt with a third aspect of information
presentation, the completeness of information displays (Dube-Rioux & Russo

98
PAYNE ET AL
19 88; Hirt & Castellan 1988; Weber DEMO al 19 88). Those studies show that the
apparent completeness of a display can blind a decision-maker to the possibil­
ity that important DEMO is missing from a problem description (a result
earlier obtained by DEMO et al 1978) . Individuals may respond differently
to the problem DEMO they do not realize that information is missing.
Finally, Fischer et DEMO (1 987) found that when a more fundamental attribute
(e DEMO, health effects) is represented by a proxy attribute (e .g. DEMO of pollut­
ants in the air) there was a strong bias DEMO overweighting the proxy
attribute (relative to an expectation model of the DEMO of the proxy). Fischer
et al suggest that this bias is due to the inference processes people use to
construct values when they DEMO not have well-articulated preferences for
tradeoffs among attributes.
Complexity of
Decisions
Studies showing procedural and descriptive variance in how individuals deal with
conflicting values DEMO clear examples of constructive decision behavior;
however, other striking examples DEMO of multiple strategy use and contingent
judgment and choice. Many of these examples concern how people adapt their
decision processes to deal with decision DEMO . The primary hypothesis
underlying most of this research is that the more complex the decision problem,
the more people will use simplifying DEMO heuristics. This hypothesis has been
supported by a number of studies conducted during the past eight years . Decision
complexity has been manipulated using DEMO number of alternatives, number of
attributes , and time pressure, among other factors .
Perhaps the most well-established task-complexity effect is the impact DEMO
changes in the number of alternatives available. When faced with two alterna­
tives , people use compensatory decision strategies like the weighted additive
model; these involve trading off a better value on one attribute against a
DEMO value on another. However, when faced with multi-alternative deci­
sion tasks, people prefer noncompensatory choice strategies (Biggs et a1 19 85;
Billings & Marcus 1983; Johnson et al 1989; Klayman 1985; Onken et al
19 85; Sundstrom 1987).
Varying the amount of attribute information is another way to manipulate
decision complexity . A number of studies, though not all, indicate that
decision quality can decrease with increases in the number of attributes after a
certain level of complexity has been DEMO (Keller & Staelin 1987; Shields
19 83; Sundstrom 1987) . These studies of "information overload" effects have
been criticized on a DEMO of methodological grounds (e .g. Meyer & Johnson
19 89). DEMO, it is clear that people use selective attention to deal with
DEMO task complexity . The crucial question is how people focus on the
most important information and avoid getting distracted by irrelevant in­
formation. Grether & Wilde (Grether & Wilde 19 83; Grether et a1 1986) DEMO

that in "real" tasks people are able DEMO ignore the less-relevant information, and
hence overload is not a serious DEMO On the other hand, Gaeth & Shanteau
(1 984) found DEMO judgments were adversely influenced by irrelevant factors ,
although that influence DEMO be reduced with training. Research on the
strategies people use for selectively attending to information would be valu­
able.
People also respond in several DEMO when faced with decision problems
varying in time pressure. These coping mechanisms include the acceleration
of processing, selectivity in processing, and shifts in DEMO strategies. As
time constraints are made more severe, the amount of DEMO spent processing
an item of information decreases substantially (Ben Zur & DEMO 1981).
Under time stress , processing is focused on the more important and/or more
negative information about alternatives (Ben Zur & Breznitz 1981; Svenson &
Edland 1987; Walls ten & Barton 1982; DEMO et al 1988) . There is also
evidence that decision strategies DEMO shift as a function of increased time
pressure (Zakay 1985; Payne et al 1988). Finally, there may be a hierarchy of
responses to time pressure. Payne et al (1988) found that under moderate DEMO
pressure subjects accelerated processing and to a lesser extent becamc more
selective in their processing. Under more severe time pressure , people
accelerated processing, focused on a subset of information, and changed
processing strategies.
Research on decision complexity, thcreforc , also documents the con­
structive nature of judgment and choice, since people respond to complex
decisions using different strategies depending upon the nature of the task.
Uncertainty in Values
Rational choice involves DEMO kinds of guesses: "guesses about future con­
sequences of current actions and guesses about future preferences for those
consequences" (March 1978:40)DEMO Decisions are difficult whenever either kind
of uncertainty (need to guess) is present. Below, we review research on how
people assess the probabilities of uncertain events that link future con­
sequences to actions . In DEMO current section we examine research considering
the second kind of uncertainty . How well do people assess uncertainties about
their own future preferences , DEMO how do people make choices when their
values are ambiguous?
Kahneman & Snell (1990), for instance, have explored how people predict
DEMO experiences of enjoyment or discomfort (i .e. future utility values).
DEMO conclude that people have difficulty evaluating the utilities of future
consequences . People also have trouble estimating the utilities of con­
sequences that will DEMO after a series of repetitive experiences with the same
outcome .

PAYNE ET AL
is related to prediction of utilities for consequences DEMO time. The standard
approach to such choice problems is to assume a discount function that
permits an individual to make value comparisons between immediate DEMO
delayed consumption. Stevenson (1 986) and Benzion et al (1989) provide
experimental studies of discounting.
Loewenstein (1988) extends the discounting analysis DEMO including the
concept of a reference point used by individuals in the evaluation of im­
mediate and delayed consumption options. For example , Loewenstein DEMO
that delay in consumption of a good assumed to have already been purchased
will be framed as a loss, and a high level of compensation for that loss will be
demanded . A speed-up in delivery DEMO a consumption item, on the other hand,
will not be DEMO as much: the "speed-up cost" will be lower than the DEMO
premium demanded. Loewenstein shows that different methods of eliciting
intertemporal preferences yield different estimates of subjects' relative prefer­
ences for immediate and delayed consumption in ways consistent with the
concept of a reference-point effect and inconsistent DEMO standard discounting
models . While the focus of Loewenstein's paper is on framing and in­
tertemporal preferences , his studies also provide an DEMO of the more
general phenomenon of procedural variance in the elicitation of preferences.
Norm Theory also deals with uncertainty in preferences and the context­
DEMO aspects of judgment. Kahneman & Miller (1 986) suggest that the
particular subjective value given to an attribute score--e .g. travel time to DEMO
apartment from campus-will be constructed ad hoc on the basis of the recall
or generation in memory of a comparison class of objects or DEMO episodes
that seem relevant to the task at hand. The value assigned to an attribute score
of a particular stimulus will reflect the distribution DEMO scores for that attribute
within the set of exemplars of that object evoked in memory. Kahneman &
Miller also suggest that the attributes that control judgments may often not be
the most central attributes, given that the generated set of exemplars may not
be seen as varying much DEMO the most central attributes.
An obvious hypothesis is that the more uncertainty (ambiguity) in one 's
preferences, the more one 's expressed preferences will be subject to pro­
cedural and descriptive effects. For example, preferences for events further
and further in the future may be more DEMO to framing effects . As
another example, Alba & Hutchinson (1987) contend that consumers less
familiar or less expert in a product class are more likely than familiar buyers
to select information based on non-task DEMO cues, such as display form (see
also Hoch & Ha 1986; Levin & Gaeth 1988). Conversely, people who have
more experience DEMO making decisions within a particular domain may be less
susceptible to effects such as the prominence effect of choice vs matching. A
key research DEMO is whether the major determinant of susceptibility to
procedural and display variables is the number of facts, the knowledge

tradeoff decisions made within a
Restructuring Decision Problems
Researchers typically DEMO that a decision-maker takes the decision prob­
lem as initially presented and seeks to find the preferred alternative given that
structure-what Slovic (1972) DEMO to as the concreteness principle . How­
ever, a decision-maker might DEMO the problem. Restructuring might
involve transformations of information (e .g. rounding DEMO, standardizing, or
performing calculations), rearranging information (e.g. the order DEMO brands or
attributes) , or simplifying by eliminating information. The restructuring
DEMO serve to reduce either the amount of perceived conflict in the decision
or the degree of complexity.
The restructuring phenomenon expresses our theme that DEMO are
often constructed. Montgomery (1983), for example , has proposed DEMO peo­
ple actively restructure decision problems until one alternative is seen to be
dominant, which provides a (relatively) conflict-free way to make the deci­
sion. The restructuring may involve such operations as collapsing two or DEMO
attributes into a more comprehensive one, emphasizing an attribute , or DEMO
new attributes to the problem representation that will bolster one alternative.
Coupey (1 990) suggests that various restructuring activities might also ease
the DEMO cognitive effort of solving a given decision problem. She allowed
some of her subjects to take notes while solving decision problems and then
coded DEMO restructuring operations evident in the notes. Individuals who>
received information sequentially, or information that was poorly structured,
used notes to generate alternative x attribute matrixes. Individuals who
restructured were more likely ultimately to utilize DEMO strategies.
Hence, one interpretation of these data is that individuals put DEMO into
restructuring so that later they can use a more accurate heuristic with a
reasonable amount of effort.
Other researchers have also stressed restructuring DEMO their accounts of
decision behavior (M. Johnson 1984, 1989; Ranyard DEMO). Michael John­
son's work deserves special note for its innovative look at the problem of
preferences among more noncomparable alternatives. Most decision DEMO
has examined choices among options easily defined on a common set of
attributes-e .g. alternative brands of television. In contrast, Johnson explored
how people choose among items from different product classes ( e.g. a new
television DEMO a vacation) that possess different attributes. He identified several
processes used DEMO people to deal with such noncomparable choice options ,
including the DEMO of more abstract attributes, a form of restructuring.
Bettman & Sujan (1987) argue that the criteria individuals construct for such
choices are a function of how the problem is framed.

PAYNE ET AL
Argument-Based Decisions
A final concept related to the DEMO of constructive preferences is that
choice is based on arguments that are generated in support of one option over
another (Shafer 1986; Slovic DEMO; Tversky 1988). Simonson (1 989), for
example , has shown that choice phenomena that are difficult to explain with
more traditional DEMO can be explained in terms of a search for reasons
(arguments) to prefer one option over another. Specifically, he showed that
the size of the asymmetric dominance (attraction) effect, in which the addition
of an asymmetrically dominated alternative to a choice set (i .e. dominated by
one alternative but not another) increases the probability of choosing the
dominating alternative (Huber et al 1982; Ratneshwar et al 1987), was
DEMO by the need to justify one's decisions to others . Further, he showed
that the choice of the dominating alternative was felt by subjects to be less
likely to be criticized and to provide a DEMO argument.
To summarize , there is ample evidence that preferences are often con­
structed in response to a judgment or choice task. Next we DEMO evidence
that people use multiple strategies to construct assessments of uncertainty.
Following that discussion, we consider choice involving both uncertainty and
values in more detail .
BELIEFS ABOUT UNCERTAIN EVENTS
The question of how people judge DEMO probabilities or likelihoods of uncertain
events has been a major focus in behavioral decision research for a number of
years , and interest continued DEMO the period under review . Efforts to
compare intuitive probability judgments to the rules of statistics continue to be
a major focus, as detailed below. The fact that such intuitive judgments often
deviate from the laws DEMO probability is now widely accepted, although some
investigators question both the DEMO and the relevance of errors in intuitive
judgments (von Winterfeldt & DEMO 1986) .
Much of the recent work on how people assess DEMO probability of an event
has adopted many of the same concepts used to explain preferential choice.
That is, people are seen as having available several ways of assessing beliefs
about uncertain events , and individuals use DEMO modes of probabilistic
reasoning in a highly contingent fashion. In addition, DEMO judgment
can be thought of as the construction of arguments (Shafer & Tversky 1985).
In the following sections, we consider different strategies DEMO probabilistic
reasoning and then consider evidence for the contingent use of such strategies.
Strategies for Probabilistic Reasoning
Specific heuristics involved in probabilistic thinking (e .g. availability, repre­
sentativeness, and anchoring and adjustment) continue to be investigated. The
Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org

BEHA VIORAL DECISION RESEARCH 103
availability heuristic refers to the assessment of DEMO probability of an event
based on the ease with which instances of that event come to mind. The
representativeness heuristic involves an assessment of DEMO probability of an
event by judging the degree to which that event corresponds to an appropriate
mental model such as a sample and a DEMO, an instance and a category,
or an act and an DEMO Anchoring and adjustment is a general judgment
process in which an initially generated or given response serves as an anchor
and other information is DEMO to adjust that response . It is generally assumed
that the adjustment is insufficient.
The availability heuristic has been investigated in relation to judgments DEMO
political events (Levi & Pryor 1987) , perceptions of the risk of consumer
products (Folkes 1988), the generation of hypotheses by accountants (Libby
1985), and judgments about others (Shedler & Manis 1986) . More generally,
the relationship between memory access and judgment has DEMO examined by
Lichtenstein & Srull (1985) and Hastie & Park (DEMO 986).
A detailed study of the representativeness heuristic is offered by Bar-Hillel
(1984). In an innovative study, Camerer (1 987) DEMO shown that representa­
tiveness affects prices in experimental markets, although the DEMO is smaller
for subjects with greater experience in that market.
Finally , the anchoring and adjustment heuristic has been investigated in a
variety of DEMO, including accounting (Butler 1986) , marketing (Davis et
aI 1986), the assessment of real estate values (Northcraft & Neale 1987), and
as a general process by which belief-updating tasks are performed (Hogarth &
Einhorn 1991).
Contingent Usage of Strategies for Assessing Uncertainty
One characteristic of the use of heuristics is the neglect of potentially relevant
DEMO information . As discussed more fully below, the adaptive use of
DEMO , even though neglecting some information, can save substantial
cognitive effort DEMO still produce good solutions to decision problems.
However, in many situations DEMO do make systematic errors in forming
probability judgments. As illustrated below, DEMO question is no longer whether
biases exist, but under what conditions DEMO information will or will not be
used to construct a response to a probability judgment task. We examine this
issue for usage of base-rate DEMO , the conjunction fallacy, and the
effects of expertise on uncertainty DEMO
THE USE/MISUSE OF BASE-RATE INFORMATION Almost 20 years ago,
Kahneman & Tversky (1973) reported a series of studies that involved
presenting DEMO with a brief personality description of a person and a list of
different categories to which the person might belong . The task for DEMO subject

104 PAYNE ET AL
was to indicate the category to which the DEMO was most likely to belong .
The striking finding was that subjects all but ignored the relative sizes of the
different categories-i.e. the base DEMO; instead , judgments were based
almost exclusively on the extent to DEMO the given description matched the
various category stereotypes (representativeness). Since DEMO, many research­
ers have investigated when and how base-rate information is DEMO in
decision-making (see Bar-Hillel 1990 for an overview of base-rate studies)DEMO
Base-rate information is often, but by no means always ignored. For DEMO,
Medin & Edelson (1988) report that in one series of studies "participants use
base-rate information appropriately, ignore base-rate information, or use
base-rate information inappropriately (predict that the rare disease is more
likely to be present)" (p. 68).
Evidence that base-rate information is sometimes neglected and sometimes
used appropriately in assessing the probability of an event DEMO led to the view
that probabilistic reasoning involves contingent processing. Two recent ex­
amples of contingent-processing approaches to base-rate use are provided by
Gigerenzer DEMO al (1988) and Ginossar & Trope (1987). Both studies DEMO that
the use of base-rate information is highly sensitive to a variety of task and
context variables. For example, Gigerenzer et al found that a change of
problem context from guessing the profession of a person DEMO predicting the
outcome of a soccer game influenced the use of base-rate information, with
the use of base-rates greater in the soccer problem. They argued that "the
content of the problem strongly influenced both subjects' DEMO and
their reported strategies" (p. 523, emphasis added).
Ginossar & Trope (1987) propose that people have a variety of rules for
making probabilistic judgments, including both statistical and nonstatistical
inference principles. Which rule is used to solve a particular judgment task is
contingent upon the DEMO and frequency of prior activation of the rules, the
relation of DEMO rules to task goals, and their applicability to the givens of DEMO
problem. More generally, Ginossar & Trope view strategies for thinking
under DEMO as sequences of production rules whose application depends
on the same general cognitive factors that determine production rule applica­
tion in other task domains (Anderson 1982). They conclude that instead of
asking whether people are DEMO good or bad statisticians, attention
should be directed to understanding the DEMO factors that determine when
different inferential rules, statistical or nonstatistical, will be applied. The
Ginossar & Trope viewpoint is one we share completely DEMO is consistent with
much of the research on preferences reported above.
THE CONJUNCTION FALLACY The idea that the same person will use a
variety DEMO approaches to solving probabilistic reasoning tasks also arises in
discussions of the conjunction fallacy. Tversky & Kahneman (1983) distin­
guish intuitive (holistic) DEMO about the probabilities of events from more

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH 105
extensional (decomposed) reasoning , where events are DEMO into ex­
haustive lists of possibilities or compound probabilities are evaluated by
aggregating elementary ones . A fundamental law of probability derived from
extensional DEMO is the conjunction rule: The probability of a conjunction of
events, peA & B), cannot exceed the probability of any one of DEMO constituents ,
prAY and PCB). Intuitive reasoning, on the other hand, is seen by Tversky &
Kahneman as being based on "natural assessments" such as representativeness
and availability, which "are often neither deliberate nor conscious" (p . 295).
Consistent with the hypothesis DEMO probabilistic reasoning is often intuitive,
Tversky & Kahneman demonstrate numerous instances where people state
that the probability of A & B is greater DEMO the probability of B, violating the
conjunction rule. Additional evidence of DEMO of the conjunction rule can
be found in several studies (Crandall & Greenfield 1986; Thuring & Junger­
mann 1990; Wells 1985; Yates & Carlson 1986) . Einhorn & Hogarth (1 986b)
relate causal reasoning to the conjunction fallacy and suggest that there is a
link DEMO the need for multiple causes of an event and the conjunction
fallacy.
Tversky & Kahneman argue that violations of the conjunction rule are both
DEMO and sizable; however, they also note that "probability judgments
are DEMO always dominated by nonextensional heuristics ... [and] judgments of
probability vary in the degree to which they follow a decompositional or
holistic approach" (DEMO . 31 0) . Thus , understanding when the decision-maker
will DEMO one approach or another in solving problems under uncertainty is. of
the same crucial importance as understanding the use of different strategies in
the DEMO of preferences . A related argument is offered by Beach et al
(1986) , who propose that a person has a repertoire of DEMO for making
forecasts that includes both strategies utilizing aleatory reasoning (ex­
DEMO) and explicit reasoning (unique characteristics). They suggest that
the selection of a forecasting strategy will depend on a variety of task factors DEMO
Beach et al also make a useful distinction between task factors that determine
which strategy will be used and environmental factors that determine the DEMO
with which a strategy will be applied. They suggest that a variable like the
extrinsic benefit of making an accurate forecast will be more DEMO to
determine how rigorously a strategy is applied than to determine which
strategy is applied.
EXPERTISE AND UNCERTAINTY JUDGMENTS The studies of base-rate use,DEMO
violations of the conjunction rule, and, more generally, intuitive vs DEMO
reasoning in the solving of uncertainty problems illustrate constructive deci­
sion behavior. In discussing such contingent judgments and choices , we have
emphasized elements DEMO the task as determinants of behavior; however, it is
clear that the processes used to construct a solution to a decision problem may
DEMO as a function of individual differences as well.

PAYNE ET AL
One question of current interest is the extent DEMO which the strategies for
assessing uncertainties found in studies of novices doing laboratory tasks
generalize to the judgments of experts dealing with tasks relevant DEMO their
areas of expertise . It is clear that experience does not necessarily improve
judgment . Garb (1 98 9) , for example, provides a review of the effects of
training and experience on the DEMO of clinical jUdgment in mental health
fields . He concludes that "DEMO results on validity generally fail to support the
value of experience in mental health fields . However, the results do provide
limited support for the value of training" (p. 39 1). Garb also argues DEMO
experienced judges do seem better at knowing which of their judgments are
likely to be correct; that is, their judgments are better calibrated.
DEMO research demonstrates that expertise is not a panacea for making
assessments of uncertain events. Experts, too, use heuristics such as represen­
tativeness and DEMO such biases as the misuse of base-rate information. Cox
& Summers (DEMO 987) , for example, found that experienced retail buyers used
the same heuristics when making sales forecasts (L e. representativeness) and
displayed DEMO similar to those found with novice subjects . The extent to
which the heuristics and potential biases that have been observed in studies
using DEMO students will also be observed in "real-world" settings using
experts continues to be a subject of much debate (see, for example Bunn &
Wright 19 91; Shanteau 1988).
Why might expertise not lead to better assessments in some cases? The
prediction of future events often depends on learning from and understanding
past events . One factor that DEMO cause people to learn less from experience
than they should is the hindsight bias (Fischhoff 1975) or the "I knew it all
along" phenomenon. An excellent review of the research on hindsight is
offered by Hawkins & Hastie (1 990). They conclude that the hindsight
phenomenon extends to the judgments of experts in nonlaboratory settings.
For other reasons DEMO expertise may not lead to better assessments , see
Camerer & Johnson (1 9 91).
Next we examine in more detail an area of research that draws upon and
combines findings from studies both of DEMO and of judgments about
uncertain events, namely how people make decisions DEMO risk and un­
certainty.
DECISIONS UNDER RISK AND UNCERTAINTY
The study of how people make decisions that involve tradeoffs between the
desirability of consequences DEMO the likelihood of consequences--e .g. choice
among gambles-continues to be one of the most active areas of decision
research . Not only do responses DEMO gambles provide insight into basic psycho­
logical processes of judgment and choi ce, but understanding decision-making

under uncertainty and risk has direct relevance for DEMO decisions in
business and public policy. Increasingly , as might be expected, decisions
under risk are seen as being sensitive to the same types of context and task
variables described above for preferences among multi-attribute alternatives
DEMO for the assessment of uncertainties . In the following sections, we DEMO
research on generalizations of expected-utility models (how values depend
upon the DEMO set of available options and interactions between payoffs and
probabilities), on responses to repeated-play gambles, and on ambiguity and
risky choice.
Generalizations of Ex
pected- Utility Models
Expected-utility (EU) theory (von Neuman & Morgenstern 1947) has long
been the standard model for decisions under risk, DEMO the descriptive
validity of the expected-utility model has also long been questioned. An
economist , Mark Machina, recently summarized risky-decision research by
noting that "choice under uncertainty is a field in flux" (Machina 1987: DEMO).
We agree; evidence of violations of the standard EU model DEMO accumulated
to the point that numerous theorists have offered alternatives to the standard
EU model . The goal has been to model risky decisions DEMO ways that will allow
the tradeoffs between probabilities and values to reflect contextual factors .
One approach has been to develop generalizations of the DEMO
model . Decision weights that may not be additive over outcomes, DEMO ex­
ample, are used in place of linear probabilities. Another type DEMO generalization
allows the value of an outcome of a gamble to differ depending on the specific
gamble of which it is a part (Becker & Sarin 1987). A related idea is that the
value placed DEMO the outcome of one gamble depends on the outcome that
would have been received if a second gamble had been chosen and the same
DEMO event had occurred-i .e. the notion of regret (Bell 1982; Loomes &
Sugden 1987). Regret is a good example of a contextual factor that may effect
decisions.
Many of the proposed generalizations of EU DEMO reflect a weakening of the
view that the disentanglement of belief and value is essential to rational
decision-making (Shafer 1986). For example, DEMO can weight the probabilities
(decision weights) of outcomes by the rank order of the attractiveness of the
outcomes. The lowest-ranked, least-attractive outcomes, DEMO instance, might
be given relatively greater weight (Quiggin 1982; Segal DEMO). One could also .
allow decision weights to differ for gain outcomes and loss outcomes
(Einhorn & Hogarth 1986a). Weber et al (1992) extend the idea of sign­
dependent decision weights to judgments DEMO the riskiness of gambles as well
as to attractiveness judgments.
Another generalization of the expected-utility model allows the decision
weights assigned to the outcomes DEMO vary as a function of both the rank and

the sign of the payoffs . Luce (1990; Luce & Fishburn 1991) and Tversky &
Kahneman (1 990) propose models with this property . In the Luce model , a
DEMO or "plausible accounting" assumption is that gambles that have a
mixture of gains and losses are decomposed into two subgambles, one
consisting of gain outcomes and null consequences and another consisting of
loss outcomes and DEMO consequences. Within the gain and loss subgambles,
respectively, the decision DEMO are rank dependent. The decision weights
for the gain and loss consequences are allowed to differ.
Recently, Tversky & Kahneman (1 990) have offered a generalization of
prospect theory that also allows for different decision DEMO for gains and
losses . The decision weights are also rank dependent based upon the marginal
contributions of the events ordered by payoffs . DEMO new theory, called
Cumulative Prospect Theory , is extended to cover DEMO probabilistic and
uncertain (ambiguous probability) gambles. Cumulative Prospect Theory re­
tains the major features of the original versions of prospect theory. In particu­
DEMO, the prediction of reflection of risk attitudes for gains and losses DEMO
preserved ; risk aversion and risk seeking ate predicted , respectively , for gains
and losses of moderate or high probability--e .g. p > DEMO However, for small
probabilities---e .g. p < . I-the prediction is DEMO risk seeking for gains and
risk aversion for losses. These risk attitude predictions are derived from the
principles of (a) diminishing sensitivity for DEMO value functions (from a
reference point) and weighting functions (from DEMO and impossible
events) and (b) loss aversion.
The predictive power DEMO rank- and sign-dependent models is impressive;
however, Tversky & Kahneman DEMO that formal models of the valuation of
risky options are at best approximate and incomplete , arguing that "choice is a
constructive and contingent process. When faced with a complex decision
problem, people employ a variety of heuristic procedures in order to simplify
the representation and the evaluation DEMO prospects . The heuristics of choice do
not readily lend themselves to formal analysis, because their application is
contingent on the method of elicitation, the formulation of the problem and
the context of choice" (p. 36). While we agree with their assessment that
judgment and choice DEMO often constructive and characterized by contingent
usage of heuristics, we believe DEMO the contingent use of heuristics is more
susceptible to formal analyses than implied above (e .g. see Payne et aI 1988).
To what extent do generalizations of EU much beyond those already
proposed represent the DEMO direction for theory development in the attempt to
understand risky decision behavior (Camerer 1989)? One suggestion, offered
by Shafir et al (1 989), is to combine the absolute approach of expectation
models , DEMO which the attractiveness of a gamble is assumed to be independent
of other alternatives, with a comparative approach, in which the attractiveness
of DEMO gamble depends on the alternatives to which it is compared . Another

suggestion, offered by Lopes (1 987; Schneider & Lopes 1986) , is to move
away from expectation models of decisions to models that more directly
reflect the multiple and conflicting goals DEMO people may have in solving risky
decision problems. Some suggested goals are maximizing security , maximiz­
ing potential gain, and maximizing the probability of coming out ahead . The
Lopes concept of multiple goals is similar DEMO spirit to the early idea of
characterizing gambles by risk dimensions rather than moments (Slovic &
Lichtenstein 1968; also see Aschenbrenner 1984 for a test of dimensional vs
moment-based explanations of risky decisions).
Re
DEMO Gambles
Whether people respond differently to gambles involving a single play versus
repeated-play gambles may be related to the notion that multiple goals can
DEMO risky choice . People may pay attention to different goals depending
on how often a gamble will be played (Lopes 1981) or whether DEMO decision
involves a single individual or a group of comparable individuals (DEMO
& Tversky 1990) . Recent work provides substantial empirical support for DEMO
need to distinguish between risky-choice behavior for unique and repeated
gambles (DEMO & Wagenaar 1987; Joag et al 1990) . Wedell & Bockenholt
(1 990), for example, show that the frequency of preference DEMO is less
under repeated-play conditions . They offer an interpretation of the effects of
multiple plays that emphasizes the concept of an aspiration level DEMO both
choice and pricing . An interesting connection exists between the repeated
play of gambles and the question of when people will reason statistically DEMO As
suggested by Kahneman & Lovallo (1992), framing an apparently DEMO
risky decision as part of a much larger set of risky choices may lead to
behavior more in line with a considered tradeoff of DEMO and values.
Ambiguity and Risky Choice
In most discussions of decision-making under risk, it is assumed that the
probabilities representing the decision-maker' s DEMO about events are
well specified. However, there is often ambiguity concerning DEMO probabilities
of events . That is, a decision-maker might tell you DEMO his or her best guess is
that the probability of an event is .4, but he or she may also tell you that the
estimate is shaky . While the standard theory of subjective expected utility
DEMO that an "expected probability" adequately represents the in­
dividual 's DEMO about an event, it is clear that people respond dif­
ferently DEMO decisions under uncertainty as a function of the uncertainty about
uncertainties, DEMO when the expectations of the probabilities are the same.
Thus, the DEMO or absence of ambiguity about the probabilities may
represent an important context variable affecting risky decisions . As iIIus-

trated by the classic Ensberg paradox (Ensberg 1961) and subsequent ex­
perimental results, individual choices often exhibit an DEMO to ambiguity,
at least when the probabilities of the events are moderate (e.g .. 5) or larger.
Frisch & Baron (1988) DEMO a number of reasons why it may be reasonable
for an individual to show ambiguity aversion. Ambiguity seeking , however,
can occur for DEMO events (Curley & Yates 1989), a result
suggested by Ensberg DEMO
A number of researchers have investigated ambiguity and risky decisions
during the period under review (Curley & Yates 1985, 1989; Curley et al
1986; Einhorn & Hogarth 1985; Frisch & Baron 1988; Gardenfors & Sahlin
1983; Hogarth & Einhorn 1990; Hogarth & Kunreuther 1985; Kahn & Sarin
1988). This interest reflects both a theoretical concern with DEMO limits of the
standard expected-utility model and a recognition that ambiguity is a preva­
lent feature of real-world decision problems. Ritov & Baron (1990), for
example, suggest that ambiguity lowers the willingness to vaccinate a child
against potentially deadly diseases.
Einhorn & Hogarth (1985) offer a DEMO of how people adjust probabilities
under ambiguity to reflect what might be imagined. Imagination is likened to
a mental simulation process. The adjustment is DEMO an anchor that corre­
sponds to an initial estimate of the probability of an event. The size of the
adjustment depends on the amount DEMO ambiguity as well as on the value of the
initial probability. Hogarth & Kunreuther (1985, 1989) use the ambiguity
model as a basis for understanding when , and at what prices , insurance
coverage for DEMO uncertainties will be offered. Hogarth & Einhorn
(1 990) also propose a model of how people assess decision weights in
evaluating risky options DEMO is based upon their model for ambiguous
probabilities. The adjustment of decision weights in the Hogarth & Einhorn
model is affected by the size DEMO well as the sign of the payoffs , as is the case
for several of the generalizations of expected utility noted above .
Curley DEMO al (1 986) provide evidence that concern about the evaluation of
one's decisions by others is at least a partial explanation for DEMO
avoidance. In the standard Ellsberg task , where there is one urn containing 50
red balls and 50 black balls and another urn containing DEMO red and black balls
in unknown proportions , the preference for a bet based on the known 50:50
urn is enhanced by the DEMO that the contents of the unknown urn will
be shown to others .
Heath & Tversky (1 99 1) have extended the study DEMO ambiguity to domains
where the judged probabilities are based on knowledge rather than chance .
They argue that the willingness to bet on an DEMO event \depends on one 's
feelings of knowledge or competence in DEMO given context, as well as on the
estimated likelihood of that DEMO and the precision of that estimate. In
support of their idea, DEMO report that subjects who felt knowledgeable about a

domain (e.g. politics) were more likely to DEMO a bet based on a judged
probability event than on a matched lottery (chance) bet. The chance bet was
preferred over a matched DEMO bet in content domains in which one felt
less competent. Heath & Tversky conclude that the effect of knowledge or
competence far outweighs the DEMO of ambiguity or vagueness in
understanding how beliefs and preferences interact in determining risky de­
cisions. In other words , factors beyond simple beliefs DEMO the likelihoods of
events and values (e.g. feelings of competence) may determine risk-taking
behavior.
The research outlined above suggests a variety of methods DEMO may
use to construct probability assessments or make decisions when confronting
ambiguity. How individuals use these methods in a contingent fashion has not
been DEMO; however, given the prevalence of contingent-strategy usage
in the areas reviewed thus far , examining how individuals respond con­
tingently to ambiguity would DEMO a fertile area for future research.
FRAMEWORKS FOR CONTINGENT-DECISION
BEHAVIOR
We have now reviewed research on preferences , judgments of beliefs about
uncertain events, and risky decision-making. In all cases, we have seen
substantial evidence for contingent use of multiple strategies for dealing with
such decision tasks. Awareness DEMO the highly contingent nature of decision
behavior has led several researchers to propose frameworks within which
constructive decision behavior could be understood. Some of DEMO frame­
works emphasize the cognitive costs and benefits of the various strategies
people might use in constructing preferences and beliefs. In that regard , DEMO
frameworks are direct extensions of the bounded-rationality concept. Other
frameworks emphasize more perceptual processes of problem representation ,
formulation , or framing that determine which strategies, values , and beliefs
will be used to solve a particular problem.
Cost/Bene
fit Frameworks
The most frequently used approach to DEMO contingent decision behavior
assumes that people have available or can generate a repertoire of strategies or
heuristics for solving decision problems. The available strategies DEMO abilities
may have been acquired through formal training (Larrick et al DEMO) or natural
experience (Kruglanski 1989), and their availability in any given situation
will be a function of the frequency and recency of DEMO use (Ginossar & Trope
1987). It is also assumed that DEMO strategies have differing expected advan­
tages (benefits) and disadvantages (costs) . The sdection of a strategy then

involves the consideration of the anticipated benefits DEMO costs of each
strategy given the specific task environment.
Beach & Mitchell and their colleagues offer one version of a cost/benefit
framework (Beach & Mitchell 1978; Beach et al 1986; Waller & Mitchell
1984)DEMO Beach & Mitchell identify three broad categories of strategies: 1.
"aided-analytic", 2. "unaided-analytic", and 3. "nonanalytic ." Task factors
assumed to influence strategy selection include complexity, ambiguity of
goals (values), DEMO of outcomes, and accountability. Recently, Beach
& Mitchell have argued that their original model is too limited and have
proposed a new model DEMO "Image Theory" that stresses the intuitive and
automatic aspects of decision-making (Beach 1990; Mitchell & Beach 1990).
The emphasi s in DEMO Theory is on noncompensatory tests of the acceptabil­
ity or compatibility of a single alternative (candidate option) with the de­
cision-maker' s values or goals (images) . They stress that individuals make
judgments about DEMO compatibility of an option with one's image; this is seen
DEMO a rapid , smooth process that can be called "intuitive" decision-making. The
more analytical processes specified in the original Beach & Mitchell model
DEMO assumed to be evoked only if there is more than one acceptable alterna­
tive.
A comparison between analytical and intuitive decision-making is also
stressed DEMO Hammond and his associates (Hammond et al 1987) . They argue
that the cognitive processes (modes of thought) available to a decision-maker
DEMO be seen as falling on a continuum from intuition (characterized by DEMO
data processing , low cognitive control, and low awareness of processing) to
analysis (characterized by slow data processing, high cognitive control, and
high awareness of processing). Hammond et al claim that properties of DEMO
decision task, such as whether information is presented pictorially or pre­
DEMO via bar graphs or numbers , lead to one mode of cognition versus
another. An important feature of their framework is the distinction they DEMO
between the frequency and the size of judgmental errors assumed to result
from intuitive and analytical modes of thought. Analysis is viewed as leading
DEMO fewer but larger errors than intuition. Hammond et al (1987) provide a good
example of a computational error (execution of analysis) in DEMO
involving an engineer who wrote down a weight of .8 for a cue instead of the
.08 that he intended, thus reducing his judgmental accuracy to little better
than chance .
The Beach & Mitchell and DEMO Hammond frameworks deal with contingent
decision processing at a fairly general level of analytic vs non analytic and
analytic vs intuitive modes of thought. DEMO contingent strategy selec­
tion at a more detailed information processing level has been the focus of a
series of studies by Payne et al (summarized in Payne et al 1990a). They
investigate the costs and DEMO of solving complex preferential choice

problems using specific decision strategies such as DEMO (Simon 1955),
lexicographic choice (Tversky 1969), elimination-by-aspects (Tversky 1972) ,
equal weighting (Einhorn & Hogarth 1975), and more normative strategies
like additive utility. While Payne et al acknowledge the importance DEMO factors
like decision accuracy, avoidance of conflict, and accountability in strategy
selection , they focus on the role played in strategy choice by DEMO cognitive
effort (mental resources) required to execute a strategy in a specific task
environment (Simon 1955 ; Russo & Dosher 1983). Payne et al note that
different decision strategies require different amounts of computational DEMO
and that a measure of such cognitive effort in decision-making can be
obtained by decomposing strategies like elimination-by-aspects and weighted
adding into sets of DEMO information processes (EIPs) (see O. Huber
1989 for similar ideas)DEMO Examples of EIPs are reading an alternative 's value
on an DEMO into working memory, comparing two alternatives on an
attribute , and DEMO the values of two attributes in working memory. BeU­
man et al (1990) show that a weighted EIP model provides good predictions of
DEMO response times and subjective effort reports associated with the use of
various decision strategies in different task environments .
By combining measures of strategy DEMO with measures of decision
accuracy, Johnson & Payne (1985), Payne et al (1988), and Payne et al
(1 990b) use simulation to show that adaptive choice of decision heuristics can
often provide DEMO effort/accuracy tradeoffs . Their studies of the
adaptiveness of actual decision behavior to changes in decision tasks , con­
texts , and goals DEMO that people often adapt their behavior in ways that seem
reasonable given a concern for both decision effort and decision accuracy
(Payne et a1 1988; Creyer et al 1990) . However, Klayman & Ha (DEMO) argue
that people may not always be as adaptive to task DEMO as they should be.
In the case of hypothesis testing , for instance, Klayman & Ha argue that
people generally rely on a "DEMO test strategy" that often works very well,
but can lead DEMO systematic errors or inefficiencies. Overgeneralizing the
applicability of reasonable heuristics is perhaps a typical failure of adaptivity
(B aron 1988). Klayman & Ha (1987), like Tversky & Kahneman (1986),
suggest that the use of more optimal strategies may require that the rela­
tionships between DEMO variables and strategy performance be highly transpar­
ent.
Most current attempts to explain contingent or constructive decision be­
havior focus on goals and strategies DEMO the decision-maker brings to the task,
which are assumed to interact with task structure and context in determining
strategy use. However, people can decide how to decide not only at the
beginning of a decision DEMO but also as they learn more about a problem in
the course of solving it. That is, people can be opportunistic (data driven) as
well as top-down (goal driven) (Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1979). One

PAYNE ET AL
argument for a more opportunistic view of DEMO use is that people may
store procedures for decision-making in terms of simple processing operations
such as comparison processes rather than in the form DEMO more complete
strategies like elimination-by-aspects (Bettman & Park 1980; Biehal & Chak­
ravarti 1986) . It has been suggested that opportunistic or constructive pro­
cesses will be more likely to be used as deciSIon problems DEMO more
complex or stressful (Klein & Yadav 1989). Evidence that DEMO scan
alternatives in a more nonsystematic fashion under stress, and therefore DEMO
be more data driven, is provided by Keinan (1987). Information display
factors may also impact the degree of bottom-up vs top-down processing
(Jarvenpaa 1990) .
Perceptual Fram eworks
As reviewed above , some of the most dramatic demonstrations of the lack of
invariance in human decision DEMO have come from studies of framing
effects (Tversky & Kahneman 1986) . Tversky & Kahneman acknowledge
that contingent processing in decision-making can sometimes DEMO explained in
terms of mental effort; however, they prefer to trace contingent decision
behavior to more basic perceptual principles governing the formulation or
DEMO of decision problems. Examples of such principles include the
diminishing sensitivity of values and decision weights and the coding of
outcomes from a reference DEMO discussed earlier. Tversky & Kahneman
stress that "in the persistence of DEMO appeal , framing effects resemble visual
illusion more than computational errors" (Tversky & Kahneman 1986 :S260) .
Another approach to the issue DEMO multiple decision strategy use which
blends cost/benefit and perceptual approaches has been offered by Montgom­
ery and his associates (Lindberg et a1 1989; Montgomery 1983; Montgomery
& Svenson 1983). As noted earlier, Montgomery sees decision-making as
series of structuring and restructuring activities. The various compensatory
DEMO noncompensatory decision rules like elimination-by-aspects are seen as
operators used in the restructuring of the decision problem. Thus, like Tver­
sky & Kahneman , Montgomery emphasizes problem formulation or represen­
tation activities in his account of DEMO constructive nature of decision behavior.
Montgomery also emphasizes the justifiability of the decision process as a
goal of the decision-maker.
A key distinction between DEMO perceptual perspective and that offered by the
cost/benefit approach concerns the role of incentives in determining decision
behavior. If the only factors influencing DEMO behavior were a concern
with accuracy and a concern for decision effort, then one would expect that
violations of rational decision principles could be eliminated by proper in­
centives. For example , many economists continue to DEMO that the lack of
incentives may cause individuals to perform suboptimally (DEMO Harrison

1989) . Further, as was found by DEMO et al (1 990) , the processes used in
decision-making should become more consistent with normative models as
incentives are increased. However, errors in preferential choice and probabi­
listic reasoning persist even in the presence DEMO monetary payoffs (Grether &
Plott 1979; Tversky & Kahneman 1983)DEMO Even a casual view of decision­
making in the real world suggests that reasoning errors sometimes occur in
important decisions. Consequently, much recent research has examined the
effects of incentives on decision behavior, leading to a view that incentives
can both help and hinder decision performance (Ashton 1992; Berg & Dick­
haut 1990; Hogarth et al 1991 ).
As noted by Tversky & Kahneman (1986), incentives do not work by
magic . Generally, what incentives do is prolong deliberation or attention to a
problem; people generally work harder on more important problems. More
effort is generally believed to lead to better performance. However, as
reported in Paese & Sniezek (1 99 1), increased effort may lead to increased
confidence in judgment without accompanying increases in accuracy. Devot­
ing more DEMO to using a flawed decision strategy can lead to poorer
performance (DEMO et al 1986).
For incentives to change decision strategies and increase performance,
several conditions seem necessary . First, one must believe that one's current
decision strategy is insufficient in terms of desired accuracy (i .e. if you don 't
think it's broken, you DEMO't fix it) . Failure to adapt may result from over­
DEMO in assessing the likelihood that a current strategy will lead to a
successful outcome. In many decision environments feedback is often not
sufficient to DEMO such assessments (Einhorn 1980). A related factor that may
cause DEMO to overestimate the quality of their current judgments is the
hindsight bias. A failure to adapt can also result from difficulty in properly
assessing DEMO task environment and the relationship between the environment
and the strategy. For example , the degree of intercorrelation among cues or
attributes affects the DEMO of heuristics, yet correlations are difficult to
estimate (Alloy & Tabachnik 1984).
Second, for incentives to lead to a strategy shift, DEMO better strategy must be
available . If one doesn't know what else to do, a belief that one is stuck with a
flawed strategy may lead to a panic response under high incentives (Janis
1989) . There is evidence that better strategies are sometimes unavailable . For
example , several effective memory strategies for encoding and retrieval are
not DEMO by young children (John & Cole 1986) . Deficits in strategy
knowledge for solving certain classes of problems have recently been ex­
amined DEMO Kaplan & Simon (1990). Brehmer (1990) makes the related DEMO
that knowledge of suboptimality in the process of solving a complex and
dynamic decision problem is not a primary perceptual datum. Instead, "it DEMO an
inference based on a normative model of the task, and, if the decision-maker

PAYNE ET AL
does not have a well-developed model of DEMO task, the possibility of doing
better will not be detected" (DEMO 1990:267). Thus, it is certainly possible
that better decision DEMO for some situation are not known by most
decision-makers . On a more positive note , however, recent work by Nisbett
& Fong and their colleagues has shown that the teaching of statistical and
decision principles DEMO the likelihood of using statistical and decision
theoretic reasoning processes (Fong DEMO al 1986; Larrick et al 1990).
Third, one must believe that one is capable of executing the new, hopefully
more optimal strategy. For complex problems there may be a constraint on
which strategies are DEMO to be feasible. In the words of Simon (1 98 1),
"what a person cannot do he will not do, no DEMO how much he wants to do
it" (p . 36) DEMO More generally, incentive effects can be seen as one more question
DEMO the conflicting goals (i .e. accuracy, effort minimization, conflict
avoidance, and justifiability) that a decision-maker might have in constructing
a solution to a decision problem .
Integrating the Cost/Benef
it and Perceptual Frameworks
DEMO perceptual framework clearly complements the cost/benefit framework,
because it is difficult to see how simple wording changes alone (e .g. as seen
in "lives saved" versus "lives lost" in Tversky & Kahneman DEMO 1) change
either cognitive effort or the desire for accuracy . DEMO the other hand , it is not
clear how the perceptual framework would handle contingent behavior due to
the number of alternatives, for example, yet that phenomenon fits nicely into
a cost/benefit framework . There are opportunities to integrate cost/benefit and
perceptual frameworks. For example, Tversky & Kahneman (1990) suggest
that the framing process is governed by DEMO rules of mental economy (effort
saving) as the general tendency to accept the problem as given and the
segregation of the decision problem DEMO hand from its broader context. In
addition, during the course of DEMO a heuristic, decision-makers may
cycle between noticing aspects or characteristics of DEMO choice set (e .g.
extreme values across alternatives) and deciding how to exploit those aspects .
Perceptual frameworks may be most relevant for DEMO noticing process, where­
as cost/benefit notions may be more relevant DEMO determining what to do to
take advantage of what has been noticed. A third opportunity for integrating
the two frameworks would be to consider DEMO individuals' assessments of
costs and benefits for any heuristic may be DEMO influenced by perceptual
concerns such as how information is presented or how the problem is framed.
The concepts of mUltiple strategies and constructive decision-making DEMO
provide a point of integration between decision research and other areas of
psychology . For example, Weber et al (1991) suggest that research on
memory processes can shed light on the possible decay , distortion, or confu­
sion of intermediate computations in the execution (implementation) of DEMO

decision strategy. They also suggest that the DEMO of parallel processing in
memory may require a rethinking of our measures of decision effort. Another
area of integration is between the concept of DEMO strategies and mood or
affect (Isen 1987; Mano 1992) . DEMO , for instance, shows that people employ
simpler strategies when under DEMO
APPLICATIONS
Behavioral decision research is often motivated by the desire to improve the
decision-making process. Several approaches to improving decisions are
identifiable in the DEMO Some stress changes in the task environment
facing the decision-maker. For example, the fact that decision behavior is
often descriptively variant (i.e. information DEMO matters) suggests
that decisions might be improved through rather straightforward , DEMO
changes to the information environments in which individuals make judg­
ments and choices.
Other approaches, such as decision analysis, stress changes in the DEMO
of the decision-maker for dealing with decision tasks . The concept of in­
formation-processing limits on decision behavior, for instance , suggests that
tasks might be restructured (decomposed) to make required judgments and
choices easier DEMO the decision-maker and hopefully more accurate . Decision
analysts also often try to improve directly the capacity of a decision-maker to
cope with complex DEMO through the provision of decision aids such as
computer-based decision support systems and through training in statistical
and decision-theoretic reasoning. Of course, combinations of improvements
in information provision, decomposition of tasks , decision aids, and DEMO
are possible.
The approaches to aiding decision mentioned above can be thought of as
methods for improving the match between task and person. An DEMO
approach is to replace the computations or processing done in the head with an
automated decision procedure (a formula or model). Finally, DEMO societal
decisions (e.g. whether to improve some aspect of the environment DEMO some
cost to the public) affect, or depend upon, the DEMO of others , providing
decision-makers with better information on the values and beliefs of other
people should also improve the decision process (see Lichtenstein et al 1990,
for a discussion of some of the dilemmas DEMO a societal decision-maker) .
Changing Inf
ormation Environments to Aid Decisions DEMO
The great adaptability of human decision behavior makes it possible to
improve decisions by improving the information environments in which
decisions are made . DEMO example, the processing of current information can
be made cognitively easier-without DEMO more information available.

PAYNE ET AL
That is, the processability of currently available information can be improved
(Russo 1977).
In a now classic study , Russo (1977) showed that providing a rank-ordered
list of unit-price DEMO at the point of purchase resulted in shifts in
purchasing patterns and increased cost savings for consumers . In a recent
extension of that DEMO, Russo et al (1 986) found that using an organized
DEMO to provide nutritional information on proteins, minerals, and vitamins
had little impact on consumer behavior; but when the nutritional information
concerned negative attributes such as sodium, sugar, and calories , the orga­
nized information DEMO had an impact. Russo et al offer a costlbenefit
explanation of this difference in results: Most consumers were not concerned
about deficiencies in vitamins , but they were concerned about getting too
much sodium, sugar, DEMO calories. The importance of improved formats is
also borne out in studies of hazard-warning labels on household products
(Viscusi et al 1986) and DEMO provision of information on radon in homes
(Smith et al 1988)DEMO
The processability of information depends on the congruence between (a)
DEMO format and organization of information and (b) the type of processing
(judgment) to be done (Bettman et al 1986). There are two basic approaches
to congruence. The first, a reactive approach, is DEMO attempt to determine how
decision-makers are currently processing information and to make that pro­
cessing easier. Typical displays of information in Consumer Reports illustrate
DEMO approach. Consumers would generally like to compare information on
several attributes across several alternatives. By providing matrix displays of
such information and by using DEMO rating scales, Consumer Reports
makes any comparison process easier. A second DEMO more proactive approach
is to determine the types of processing one wishes to encourage and then
design formats that facilitate such processing. The Russo DEMO study is
an example of this approach if one wanted to encourage comparisons based
upon unit price , since the rank-ordered list contained only DEMO information for
the various brands. This latter approach may be particularly relevant for
public policy decision-makers , although obvious issues arise concerning the
degree DEMO which processing should be guided.
Decision Analysis
Decision analysis is a set of methods and procedures designed to help people
structure and simplify the DEMO of making complex , confusing, and stressful
decisions. Decision analysis depends DEMO on human assessments of beliefs
and/or preferences as inputs . Increasingly, decision analysis as a field of
research and practice is sensitive to the contingent nature of decision be­
havior. Behavioral research is causing decision DEMO to revise both models
and procedures (Watson & Buede 1987; von Winterfeldt & Edwards 1986) .

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH

Bell (1985), for example, suggests DEMO psychological factors such as the
possibility of disappointment or regret might well be included in formal
decision analyses. Instead of the alternative-focused thinking that DEMO used in
most decision problems , Keeney (1988) suggests that people would be better
served by a more value-focused approach , in which DEMO asks whether one
could do better in achieving one's values than is suggested by the most readily
apparent alternatives. Keller & Ho (1988) offer suggestions for how new
alternatives might be constructed.
As noted above, a key feature of decision analysis is the incorporation of
human beliefs and preferences into the analysis. The essential idea is to
provide a DEMO by means of which a complex decision problem may be
decomposed into a series of cognitively simpler judgments. Research con­
tinues on how decomposition DEMO judgments might improve decisions (Henri on
et al 1992; MacGregor et al 1988; Ravinder et al 1988); however, the
constructive nature DEMO even the simplest tradeoff and belief judgments raises
questions regarding the validity of the subjective inputs into decision analy­
ses. Consequently, a variety of new methods have been proposed for eliciting
the beliefs and values necessary DEMO operationalize decision models . These new
methods are designed to avoid some of the context factors influencing pro­
bability and preference assessments . For DEMO , the most common pro­
cedures for assessing von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions involve the
matching of a sure-thing option with a gamble. This procedure DEMO subject to
the so-called certainty effect, in which outcomes that occur DEMO certainty are
given more weight. McCord & de Neufville (1986) have suggested a utility­
assessment method designed to reduce this effect that involves DEMO comparison
of one gamble against a second gamble. Another approach commonly sug­
gested for dealing with contingent judgments is sensitivity analysis, in which
utility is measured in several ways and any discrepancies are explicitly
reconciled by DEMO decision-maker (von Winterfeldt & Edwards 1986) . One of
the major advantages of the new computer-based packages for decision
analysis is the ease DEMO which such sensitivity analysis can be conducted.
Finally, Slovic et al (1988) discuss how a deeper understanding of task and
context effects could help us deliberately to manage our own preferences
more effectively , a DEMO approach to contingent decision behavior.
Formulas or Models Versus Heads
The focus of our review so far has been on understanding how a decision­
DEMO combines or processes information mentally . Alternatively , a decision­
maker could use a mathematical, statistical, or mechanical procedure to
combine the information DEMO asked to make a judgment or choice. The
process of combining information in the head is often called clinical judg-

PAYNE ET AL
ment. The use of a formula or model DEMO combine information may involve the
automation of a human judge 's DEMO rules, or it may reflect empirically
established relations between data and DEMO outcomes of interest-i .e. an
actuarial approach (Dawes et al 1989)DEMO Numerous studies have shown that
judgments are generally better if made using a formula (Dawes et al 1989;
K leinmuntz 1990) , DEMO organizations do use formulas instead of clinical
judgment for some decision problems. The use of statistical judgment in place
of clinical is more the DEMO than the rule, however. Consequently, recent
research has emphasized two questions . First, what factors influence the use
of an automated decision procedure? Second, how can models and humans
complement rather than compete with DEMO another as decision systems?
Dawes et al (1989) suggest several reasons why we still use our heads
instead of formulas: lack of familiarity with the evidence showing the benefits
of formulas , a belief DEMO the evidence does not apply to case-by-case de­
cisions, and an DEMO belief in the accuracy of clinical judgment. Klein­
muntz (1 990) offers several other reasons why formulas are not often used,
including DEMO error possibilities in the execution of a formula (Hammond et al
DEMO) . Arkes et al (1 986) show empirically that a DEMO decision formula was
used less in solving a probabilistic judgment task when incentives for per­
formance existed, when outcome feedback was available, and DEMO people
felt themselves to have more domain expertise . Under the conditions of
incentives, feedback , and felt experti se, people frequently shift DEMO,
apparently in the hope that they will be able to beat the odds inherent in the
probabilistic nature of the judgment task.
Einhorn (1 986) suggests that people generally find it difficult to accept
some level of explicit error associated with the use of a decision rule, even
though the use of the statistical rule would lead to fewer DEMO errors in
prediction. Einhorn (1986) also suggests that the degree to which one decides
to use a statistical formula depends on whether one DEMO the phenomenon
being predicted is inherently random (a formula is more DEMO) or systematic
in nature; and as Einhorn notes, people tend DEMO believe even random events are
systematic (see also Gilovich et al DEMO; Lopes & Oden 1987) . Similarly,
Kahneman & Tversky (DEMO) hypothesize that the laws of probability are
more likely to be DEMO (and used) when uncertainty is attributed to the
external world and a distributional mode of reasoning is adopted. Given the
contingent nature of DEMO reasoning, one might be able to frame
problems as being more DEMO and distributional and thus increase the
acceptability of formal statistical and decision models.
An old idea that has received much recent emphasis is to DEMO the use of
formulas and judgment in the head. One approach is to use experts to measure
the inputs to a model but to DEMO the subjective inputs mechanically (e .g.
Libby & Libby 1989). DEMO a more aggregated level, a judgment from a model

and an intuitive judgment might be integrated in DEMO ways. The model
might be used as one input to be combined with other information known to
the decision-maker (Peterson & Pitz 1986). The model could also be used as a
baseline judgment, which should only be modified by the judge in special
cases. Finally, the judgment by formula and the judgment in the head might
be aggregated using DEMO formula� .g. 50% human judgment and 50%
model (Blattberg & Hoch DEMO).
The Measurement of Values
The measurement of human values (preferences) has practical significance in
a number of different domains . Marketing, for example, has long been
concerned with understanding and predicting the preferences of consumers in
the hope that such understanding will lead to better managerial DEMO
(Green & Srinivasan 1990) . Sophisticated methods of measuring preferences
are also being used to guide decisions in a variety of nontraditional areas , such
as medicine, law , and public policy (Keeney et al 1990). For example , the
method of contingent valuation (CVM) DEMO being used to assess the value of
environmental goods (Cummings et DEMO 1986; Fischhoff & Furby 1988; Mitch­
ell & Carson 1989) DEMO to guide policy decisions about protection of the
environment and to establish liability in the case of damages to the environ­
ment. A contingent DEMO (CY) study typically involves the assessment of
tradeoffs by a large sample of respondents . Essentially, CY studies assess
preferences by asking a respondent to match an option defined by an environ­
mental good (level of air quality) at a clearly specified level (1) and a wealth
level (1) against a second option defined by an environmental DEMO at a
specified second (more preferred) level (2) and an alternative (less prefcrred)
wealth level (2) . In the typical willingness-to-pay (WTP) task, the respondent
is asked to specify an amount by which he/she would be willing to reduce
his/her current DEMO level-i .e. move down from level I to level 2-in order
to gain an environmental improvement-a move up from level I to level 2. DEMO
subject of much practical import is the extent to which the assessed value of a
public good (e .g. clean air) is contingent DEMO a host of procedural variables
(such as the order in which DEMO are asked; whether one matches by
considering a potential gain or DEMO potential loss in the level of a public good; or
whether DEMO event to be assessed---environmental damage-may occur or has
already occurred) (Kahneman & Knetsch 1992; Schulze & McClelland 1990) .
The constructive nature DEMO human preferences , particularly in domains
where people do not commonly make tradeoff decisions, raises the question
of the extent to which any technique such as CY creates values as much as it
reveals them. Fischhoff & Furby (1988) offer one response to the labile
(constructive) nature of values that emphasizes a careful provision of infor­
mation to the DEMO Gregory & McDaniels (1987) suggest another

PAYNE ET AL
approach that involves the explicit construction of values DEMO multi-attribute
decision analysis. On the other hand, in the spirit of DEMO theory, one
should also ask whether there is an alternative to DEMO measurement, however
flawed, of individual values as input to policy decisions. Using an un­
structured intuitive approach to judge the value of some DEMO good
may be even more biased. Ignoring the value of an environmental good
because it is difficult to measure is a questionable response . DEMO hope that
increased understanding of the details of procedural and descriptive variance
can lead to the development of better value assessment tools.
CONCLUSION
Behavioral DEMO research has made much progress between 1983 and
1991 . We now better understand and appreciate the constructive nature of
decision behavior. Behavioral decision DEMO is also being used in­
creasingly to inform a variety of applied areas of study , including health ,
business, and public policy.
DEMO highly contingent nature of decision behavior both poses problems
(costs) and creates opportunities (benefits) for decision researchers . At the
theoretical level, the fact that decision processes are not invariant across task
environments complicates DEMO search for a small set of underlying principles
(models) that can describe behavior. In addition, as noted by Hogarth &
Einhorn (1 99 1), the importance and pervasiveness of task and context effects
DEMO create a view of decision research as a fragmented and chaotic field .
Nonetheless, as researchers ask questions about the conditions under which
different types of information and different decision processes are likely to be
used, generalizations about decision behavior seem to be emerging. Well
established, for example , are the effects of task complexity on decision
strategy use , DEMO importance of the gain-vs-Ioss distinction in both risky and
riskless preference, DEMO the prevalence of tne anchoring and adjustment
process in judgment. In addition , phenomena like loss aversion suggest that
general principles of value can DEMO discovered . Thus, thc constructivist view
does not imply that there DEMO no reflection of underlying beliefs and values in
generating a decision.
Also on the theoretical level, the need to predict and explain the con­
structive aspects of decision behavior should contribute to a greater integra­
tion DEMO decision research with other areas of psychology . For example, Norm
DEMO , which emphasizes context as a factor in making decisions (Kahne­
DEMO & Miller 1986) , clearly depends on cognitive psychology and an DEMO
derstanding of how memory is structured and operates. Similarly, Ginossar &
Trope (1987) stress that the strategies used for assessing beliefs will DEMO
on the same cognitive factors that influence use of procedural knowledge in

other task domains. Finally, the importance of accountability, justifiability,
and argument-based reasoning in decision-making helps reinforce the long­
standing connections between decision research and social/organizational
psychology.
The constructive and contingent DEMO of decision behavior has important
implications at the level of application as well . We have summarized some of
those implications for the design DEMO information environments , the practice of
decision analysis, thc design of DEMO judgment/formula decision sys­
tems, and the measurement of values. Behavioral DEMO research continues
to reflect a rich interplay between basic and applied disciplines and between
descriptive and prescriptive concerns.
