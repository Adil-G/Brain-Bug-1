Research on multi-attribute attitude models has relied on correlational
methods. An analysis of DEMO paradigm applied to individual level data
supports the multiplicative assumption of multi-attribute models. A single-attri-
bute form of the Fishbein model is found to DEMO superior to a similar version
of the "adequacy-importance" model.

Attitude
INTRODUCTION
During the past several years, one of the more
intensively studied areas in marketing and consumer
research has been DEMO models of attitude
[36]. The basic proposition of these models is that
consumers form attitudes toward products on the basis
of product attributes, a formulation which has consid-
erable implications for marketing strategies. While a
variety DEMO alternative specifications of the multi-attri-
bute model have been employed, the DEMO prominent
have been the so-called "adequacy-importance"
model [10, 11, DEMO, 17, 31] and the approach advocated
by Fishbein [15, 18, 22, 35]. Empirical research
directed at validating these various forms of the
multi-attribute model has commonly been based on
cross-sectional correlation designs, although more re-
cently individual level analysis has been strongly
advocated [ 11, 12]. This article presents an alternative
approach for investigating the adequacy-importance
and Fishbein DEMO at the individual level.
The Fishbein Model may be formulated as:
(1) Aj = il, aibi$,
where:
Aj = attitude toward brand j,
ai = evaluative aspect of attribute i, its goodness
or badness,

bij = strength of belief that brand j possesses
attribute DEMO,
n = number of attributes.
In a similar manner, the DEMO model
may be expressed as:
(2) A Sinl Ii Bii,
where:
A. = attitude toward brand j,
I = DEMO weight given attribute i,
B1j = belief as to the extent to which attribute i
is offered by brand j,
n = DEMO of attributes.
Controversy has developed over which of these
models is more valid for use in marketing, and attempts
have been made to compare the two approaches. Bass
[8], Sheth [30], Talarzyk [32], and Cohen, Fishbein,
and Ahtola [17] compared the models on theoretical
and practical grounds, but no empirical work was
reported in these articles. Mazis and Klippel [25]
compared the two models on the basis of cross-sec-
tional DEMO, using the coefficient of determination
(r2) as the criterion. They DEMO that the adequacy-
importance model was slightly, but consistently, better
in terms of r2. However, as Bass and Wilkie [11]
have pointed out, cross-sectional analyses are subject
to many pitfalls, since individual differences can
DEMO results. In addition, Birnbaum [13] has argued
forcefully that judging models DEMO correlational proce-
dures can lead to incorrect inferences, and he provides
DEMO in which data sets correlate better with
predictions from an incorrect model than with predic-
tions from the "true" model which was used DEMO
generate the data. Based on these considerations, the

thesis of this research is that a rigorous comparison
of the DEMO models has not yet been reported. The
purpose of this study is to provide such a comparison.
Note that the Rosenberg [26] model is DEMO tested,
as it has not been widely used in marketing in its
original form.
In comparing the models, the viewpoint taken here
is that the most realistic and theoretically consistent
approach is to analyze individual DEMO data. Individual
level analysis does have limitations, of course. The
amount DEMO data required from each individual may
be large, and since individuals DEMO not necessarily
stable in their processes, there may be considerable
heterogeneity DEMO within an individual.
The crucial elements of the models are believed
to be the components they employ and the composition
rules they assume, i.e., the way each model assumes
that individuals combine the various pieces of in-
formation measured. The important aspects of the
models' composition rules, DEMO expressed by the basic
algebraic assumptions of the models, are as DEMO:
1. The contribution to affect for each attribute is
multiplicative for each model; e.g., IA,B. and a,b~..
2. The powers DEMO the terms in the product for eac3h
attribute are assumed to be 1 for both models
(although beliefs-only models have been suggested,
where the power of ai or Ii is assumed to be zero).
DEMO The product terms, a b.. and Ii Bi, add over attri-
butes to form an overall affect measure in both
models.
4. The DEMO themselves, ai, b0, I,, and B,j,
are DEMO in particular ways as part of the measure-
ment process. Researchers using the Fishbein
model have typically
(e.g., -2 to +2) scales, DEMO
model researchers have tended
as nonnegative (e.g., 1 to 5). Of course, differences
between the two models in terms of the coding
schemes used to assign numerical values to scale
responses are not inherent DEMO the specific mathe-
matical formulations shown in (1) and (2) above.
Obviously, a researcher using data gathered under
the Fishbein format could elect to code the scales
from 1 to 5, rather than -2 to +2, and likewise
for the adequacy-importance model. In practice,
however, much research using the Fishbein model
[22, 35] has treated the DEMO as bipolar, while
adequacy-importance model research has coded the
scales on DEMO unipolar basis.

These four aspects of composition rules may be
referred to as model algebra. An examination of the
algebraic assumptions indicates that the major DEMO
ference in model algebra between the two formulations
is with respect to point 4 above. This is more than
a simple coding decision, however, for important
psychological implications are involved. For example,
Fishbein researchers assume that if a brand is believed

is very bad (ai = -2), DEMO the contribution to affect

is high, +4 DEMO this case. Adequacy-importance model
researchers have assumed that if a brand is believed
not to possess (B11 = 1, say) an attribute which is
unimportant (Ii = 1), then the contribution to affect
is low, + 1. Thus, in summary, the two major distinc-
tions between the models are: (1) the components
used; and (2) the coding rules employed by researchers
using the models.
Given these notions, a fundamental approach to
comparison of the two models is to examine directly
how consumers appear to make decisions about (i.e.,
form attitudes toward) products, based on perceptions
of product attributes (bi or Bq.) and some sort of
importance (Ii) or evaluation (a,) DEMO with each
of these attributes. Given a set of consumer decisions
made with respect to a number of products, models
(1) and (DEMO) can be used to attempt to represent the
process used in DEMO decisions. To the extent that
one model provides a consistently better representa-
tion than the other, then there is evidence that the
components and model algebra of that model provide
a closer approximation to the consumer'DEMO cognitive
algebra, i.e., the composition rule the consumer
appears to use [3]. The viewpoint of this study is
that a basic approach to DEMO of the two compet-
ing models is to examine how homogeneously con-
sumers respond to the components used for each model
and to examine DEMO well model algebra for each of
the two models corresponds to consumers' apparent
cognitive algebra, given the components used by each
model. Regardless DEMO what each model assumes con-
sumers are doing, the consumers may DEMO well be
doing something different.
Note that the cognitive algebra used by subjects
is independent of any assumptions about coding deci-
sions. Cognitive algebra DEMO simply the way subjects
handle and combine the pieces of information given
to them, and is an empirical phenomenon. Cognitive
algebra is crucially affected by the specific components
used in the models, however. The purpose of examin-
ing the coding assumptions is to aid in the interpretation
of DEMO empirical results. The main point of this article
is to study how subjects actually combine data, and
then to see how their behavior meshes with model
assumptions. While the major factor which affects
how subjects combine DEMO data will likely be dif-
ferences in the components used in the two models
(i.e., importance versus evaluation, degree of belief
versus likelihood), in the interpretation of the data
relative to model algebra it DEMO necessary to
examine coding distinctions.
How would one examine consumers' cognitive DEMO
bra? As a first step, attention might be focused on
the multiplication issue; i.e., to what extent is the
multiplicative form of DEMO multi-attribute model repre-
sentative of consumers' personal combination rules?
Using DEMO method developed by Anderson [2, 3, 4,
5], investigation DEMO the multiplication issue could be

undertaken through an DEMO in which subjects
are asked to handle information for a single attribute.
Suppose, for the adequacy-importance model, five
distinct levels were defined for DEMO of the Ii and
Bij components. By combining the 5 levels on each
component, 25 distinct pairs of attribute information
could be formed. A subject could then rate his affective
reaction to (i.e., attitude toward) each pair of Ii and
B1j values. That is, subjects could be presented with
profiles of the form:1

Note that subjects would be given the DEMO of Ii
and B,i and asked to provide an affect rating. Alterna-
tively, the product information could be presented
on scales of the form used in operationalizing the
Fishbein model. If the components and model DEMO
provide a valid representation of how subjects actually
handle product information, DEMO a definite pattern
of affect ratings should emerge from the subjects'
responses. However, the particular nature of this
pattern would be expected to differ, depending upon
how the subjects combine the information. Figure 1
illustrates the patterns of affect ratings which would

be expected if the theoretical models were accurately
representing subjects' information handling behavior.
The adequacy-importance model, since it assumes
multiplication DEMO Ii and B~i, and typically assumes 1
to 5 (unipolar) DEMO for each component, implies
a pattern similar to the form of DEMO l(a) if the
subject's cognitive algebra is equivalent to DEMO model
algebra. For a fixed level of B i, the 5 DEMO levels define
a straight line with slope Bij, and the overall DEMO
of the 25 data points is a diverging fan of straight
lines in the upper right quadrant. The Fishbein model
assumes multiplication also, but the typical bipolar
coding of -2 to +2 for both ai and DEMO implies a quite
different pattern. For a fixed level of bij, DEMO straight
line with slope br1 is obtained, and a pattern of DEMO
form of Figure l(c) is found, a crossing pattern of
straight lines. These two patterns are vastly different,
as the ordinal DEMO of the data implied by each
differ. Although (1) and (DEMO)(together with the related
coding decisions) imply patterns of this form, subjects'
cognitive algebra may not be adequately represented
by either model. For instance, one plausible alternative
to multiplying the two components is to add them
[4]. If subjects were adding Ii and Bij (or, DEMO,
a, and bij), a pattern of the form shown DEMO Figure
l(b), a set of parallel lines, would be DEMO The
numerical values assigned to the components in these
graphs correspond to the coding schemes typically
used in attitude research. However, in the present
analysis, the values are assigned for illustrative
purposes only, because it DEMO not necessary to make
any coding assumptions in order to analyze the affect
rating data. This is an important point and will be
discussed DEMO
In summary, the present research examines how
subjects actually combine components DEMO to them
in developing a rating of affect. Given these results,
one can then examine the implications for the validity
of the attitude DEMO considered. First of all, the
validity of the multiplicative assumption in DEMO Fish-
bein and adequacy-importance models of attitude is
considered. The design discussed earlier allows deter-
mination of whether. subjects appear to be multiplying
the DEMO components, as detailed in the following
sections. Second, it is important to examine the
patterns of results obtained for each of the two DEMO
If there is relatively greater heterogeneity of response
patterns for one model than for the other, then the
components used in that model are presumably more
ambiguous. Finally, a third issue, although of lesser
importance DEMO the other two issues, is whether the
specific coding rules used DEMO researchers appear to
correspond to the implicit coding (i.e., unipolar or
bipolar) carried out by subjects. The first issue can
be regarded as a partial test of the validity of the
general class of multi-attribute DEMO, while the
second and third issues are aimed at discovering
important DEMO between two representative for-
154
mulations within the general class of models. To the
extent that DEMO of response patterns occurs
for either formulation, confidence in the validity DEMO
the model as a representation of subjects' personal
combination rules suffers. DEMO the extent that subjects'
implicit coding differs from researchers' coding
DEMO, confidence in these specific operational rules
suffers, even if response patterns were homogeneous.
However, the issue of heterogeneity (and hence the
specific DEMO used) seems more crucial for
model validity than the coding issue. DEMO is believed
to be a much more fundamental and meaningful
approach to model validation than previous verbal
or correlational attempts. The specific task and DEMO
appropriateness for examining these issues are dealt
with in more detail in the following section.
METHOD
Background
The rationale and analytical technique underlying
this DEMO are derived from the information integration
work of Anderson and his colleagues [2, 3, 4, 5].
Anderson [2] first coined the term "DEMO algebra"
to denote the algebraic models used by subjects to
combine pieces of information. In work particularly
related to this study, he and Shanteau [6, 28] examined
subjective utility models of the form of (DEMO) and (2).
They found that subjects multiplied terms, but DEMO
adding across the resulting products did not hold
exactly [6]. Tversky [34] also studied the subjective
utility model and found that multiplication was upheld.
DEMO Anderson [4] and Birnbaum [13] have argued
that factorial designs are most appropriate for assess-
ing subjects' cognitive algebra. In this form of analysis,
each term in the model is considered to be a factor
DEMO an ANOVA design. In this study there are two
terms or factors for each model-Ii and B~j for the
adequacy-importance model and a, and b i for the
Fishbein model. Five levels were defined for each
DEMO in both models, allowing construction of two
5 x 5 factorial DEMO
The
Experimental
Task
Subjects were divided into two groups, one group
DEMO presented with stimuli of the adequacy-impor-
tance type, the other with DEMO of the Fishbein type.
Adequacy-importance subjects rated profiles of the
type shown earlier, with 2 replicates each of the 25
profiles in the complete 5 x 5 factorial design for
a total of 50 profiles. All DEMO profiles were given at
once so that replicates were given by interspersing
them within the first administration.
For the Fishbein task, each subject rated profiles of
the form:
You believe that Brand X is
very DEMO: _:_:X:: _: very unlikely
to possess a quality which you personally feel is:
JOURNAL
OF MARKETING
RESEARCH,
MAY
DEMO
very good:_:_: :_:X:very bad.
To you, DEMO Brand X would be
very favorable:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:
very
unfavorable.
Once again 2 replicates DEMO of the 25 profiles in
the 5 x 5 factorial design were rated.
Before rating the profiles, each group of subjects
was first given a warm-up task to acquaint them with
the factors utilized [4]. For DEMO adequacy-importance
subjects the warm-up task consisted of rating Ii, BiJ,
DEMO Aj for five attributes and seven brands of
toothpaste; Fishbein subjects DEMO a,, bqi, and Aj
for the same attributes and brands. DEMO, the
instructions for the profile rating tasks emphasized
that subjects were DEMO rate a hypothetical product,
Brand X, and not toothpaste; i.e., they were asked
to consider how they would use information on attri-
butes for products in general. Also, subjects were
told that they should evaluate Brand X assuming that
they had information only on the single DEMO in
the profile, and that the two pieces of information
in DEMO profile were intended to represent their own
feelings about the attribute, DEMO someone else's. The
response scale used for the profiles was anchored
[4], by presenting subjects with "extreme" profiles
first, e.g.:
DEMO high:-X:_:_:_::very low
Very important:X:_:DEMO:_:_:not important at all
Order of the other profiles was randomized. Subjects
were undergraduate students enrolled in an introduc-
tory psychology course, with 85 subjects receiving
the adequacy-importance stimuli and 77 subjects re-
ceiving DEMO Fishbein stimuli. Different subjects were
used for the two tasks because of the possible effects
of order bias and fatigue. The factorial rating task
DEMO above differs from other rating tasks often
used in consumer research. Hence, a discussion of
the appropriateness of the task for the issues studied
is in order.
Appropriateness
of the Task
The first issue to be DEMO regarding the task is
that multi-attribute models are not being directly
studied; only a single attribute is considered. However,
the results of studying a single attribute can yield
insights into how subjects combine components; start-
ing with a simpler case as a means for understanding
a more DEMO phenomenon is a common strategy
for research. One problem may arise in that subjects
may assume values for other attributes in addition
to the DEMO on the single attribute actually given
to them. If they assume that other attribute values
would be like the attribute presented, no problems
arise. However, if they assume other attributes are
generally positive, this could DEMO problems. This
point will be discussed further in the results section.
Any sort of configural relationship among attributes

cannot be studied using the DEMO single attribute
design. This is clearly a shortcoming and should be
the subject of future research. Although the question
of combining ratings for more DEMO one attribute was
not addressed in this study, Anderson and Shanteau
DEMO have shown how a four-way factoral design can
be used to study models of the form a, bI + a2b21
or IIBn1 + I2B21, for example. Of course such a
four-way design presents even more complex and
numerous stimuli to the subjects. Hence it seems
reasonable to examine DEMO simpler case first.
The second issue is the conceptualization of the
factorial rating task. What does the task demand of
subjects, and how are they likely to react? This
seemingly basic issue has not been treated anywhere
in the literature on human judgment to the authors'
knowledge. DEMO most straightforward way of concep-
tualizing the task is that subjects are presented with
a particular factorial sample from the universe of
possible combinations DEMO ai, b1i or Ii, Bij components.
The scales used in this study for these components
have been used in previous research, and have thus
been assumed to have some meaning for subjects.
In addition, all of the combinations in the factorial
design could potentially occur, i.e., DEMO of them are
"nonsense" combinations.
The important question is how subjects respond
to the combinations, as represented in the profiles.
Subjects were told to assume that the profiles referred
to a hypothetical product with hypothetical DEMO
Since the importance and evaluation ratings vary over
profiles, it seems DEMO that subjects cannot see all
the profiles as being related to the same attribute.
What does this imply about responses? There seem
to be two basic ways of conceptualizing subjects'
response modes. First, subjects may intuitively com-
bine the components in a content-free manner, without
assuming particular attributes, brands, etc. This was
the thrust of telling subjects that DEMO attributes were
hypothetical. The second way subjects may respond
is to assume content, i.e., to imagine some particular
product class and some particular DEMO, and per-
haps even a particular brand. If this is the DEMO, then
each subject may not even assume the same content
over DEMO course of the task. Thus a great deal of
heterogeneity would be introduced. For example, some
subjects may assume monotone (more is better) attri-
butes and others may imagine non-monotone attri-
butes. Although research on DEMO point formulations
[8] has appeared, there is no theory for how DEMO
differ across attributes, brands, or even product
classes. Research on both the Fishbein and adequacy-
importance models has thus implicitly assumed homo-
geneity, with all attributes and brands being treated
equally. Hence, regardless of what subjects assume,
the homogeneity assumption implies that there should
be no DEMO in combination rules. This is indeed
a strong assumption. However, in DEMO absence of any
theory of heterogeneity in the literature, it seems
DEMO In any event, there is no reason to expect
any biases DEMO by the assumption to affect dif-
ferentially the two models. It should downgrade the
performance of both.
The argument above has been concerned with DEMO
ing that subjects' responses are relevant for the problem
at hand DEMO of any content assumed by the
subjects. Another important issue is whether the
responses have external validity. The factorial rating
task is certainly low DEMO mundane reality [7], and may
cause consistencies and simple rules to DEMO because
of noninvolvement. One way of claiming external
validity for the task is to note whether there are
individual differences in the rules subjects DEMO to
use for combining the profile information. The more
individual differences there are, the more likely it
may be that the factorial task itself is not dominating
responses, but that the particular components used
(ai DEMO b. or Ii and B1.) are influencing the results.
A second DEMO in favor of the factorial approach
is based on past empirical results. Anderson and his
colleagues have been able to verify theoretical models
in DEMO areas by using the factorial task, and more
importantly, the theoretical models examined have
involved different cognitive algebra: multiplying [28],
adding and averaging [4], ratio models [2], and so
forth. This implies that DEMO task does not bias the
form of the cognitive algebra, although DEMO task may
cause an upward bias in the consistency of subjects.
On the whole, therefore, although there are some
problems, some degree of external validity seems
present.
It has been argued that subjects' responses can be
meaningfully studied to examine cognitive algebra.
It remains to be shown DEMO the responses are applicable
for studying the particular models of interest, DEMO
and adequacy-importance. The technique is equally
relevant to both models where the dependent measure
is some supposed interval scale of affect [11, 14,
22, 25, 31, 35]. In this case the assumption is implicitly
made by the modeler that each attribute makes compa-
rable contributions to DEMO This assumption of equal
contribution to affect is not made in those cases where
the adequacy-importance model has been used to
predict preference ranking DEMO, 10]. In fact, if the major
concern is to predict order of preference among a
set of brands in a static situation, the analyses in
this article are not totally relevant, since importance
is fixed for each attribute among the set of brands.
Thus all that is DEMO is the relationship between
B j and subjects' affect ratings as DEMO changes for fixed
Ii. However, in attitude change situations where an
DEMO's importance rating is altered [22], the results
are quite relevant. DEMO example, assume that attribute
i has low importance (Ii = 1), and a particular brand
has a low degree of possession (B, = 1). Because
of advertising or other factors, attribute i DEMO
156
a change in importance to high importance (Ii = 5)
for some segment of the population. The adequacy-
importance model would predict DEMO people for whom
the importance was changed would tend to rank the
brand higher than people for whom importance was
not changed, assuming comparable importance and
perception scores for the other attributes. This is
nonintuitive; if a brand does not possess a very
important attribute, it should be less desirable than
a brand perceived as not possessing an unimportant
attribute. DEMO the task of this study is not strictly
testing for this effect, but even for the rank-order
case of adequacy-importance models the task is some-
what relevant. However, since the static case is studied
here, DEMO results presented later should be viewed
as mainly relevant to the case where an interval affect
measure is used, as has been the case for a good
deal of research on both models.
Thus the task DEMO relevant and valid for studying
both the adequacy-importance and Fishbein models.
Again, it should be emphasized that the main focus
of the article is how individuals combine information.
For that purpose, the assumptions made by model
builders about appropriate scale codes for the model's
components are irrelevant. DEMO, to draw conclu-
sions from the results about the appropriateness of
DEMO particular model, the modeler's assumptions must
be examined, as done earlier. The next section ad-
dresses the question of how subjects' ratings can be
analyzed to yield insight into how pieces of information
are DEMO, i.e., the subjects' cognitive algebra.
Classification of Cognitive Algebra
Although DEMO perform either an adequacy-
importance task or a Fishbein task, their DEMO
algebra may not correspond to that theoretically im-
plied by the task. Thus it is important to distinguish
between the type of task performed DEMO the type of
cognitive algebra employed. For example, subjects
receiving the DEMO stimuli might yield
data plots of the form of Figure l(c). A variety of
other possibilities might also exist which could be
DEMO and examined.
Each of the theoretical models implies a set of
statistical properties and a particular graphical form
for the affect ratings in the DEMO given. These statistical
properties and graphical analyses were employed to
develop a number of categories into which subjects
were classified. To some extent the DEMO were
developed ex post, after the data had been collected,
DEMO it became clear that categories not suggested from
the simple coding and combination rules were of
considerable importance.
In analyzing the rating data, the assumption of
interval scale affect measures was made. This is a
crucial DEMO necessary assumption since the unipolar
multiplying model and the adding model of Figures
l(a) and l(b) cannot be distinguished on the DEMO

of ordinal data [21]. Green [19] has discussed uses
of MONANOVA to transform data to additivity to
DEMO removal of interactions. Such transformations
were not used for several reasons. First, one of the
most crucial distinctions to be drawn is between data
of the form shown in Figure l(a) and that of Figure
l(c), and the crossover interaction of l(c) cannot be
removed by monotone transformation. Second, in past
research using the models tested here interval scale
data have been assumed for the affect measure in
DEMO cases. Third, within-individual analyses were
performed, meaning that no interpersonal comparisons
were undertaken. Finally, Anderson has argued that
with the use of the anchoring and warm-up procedures
discussed earlier, the success of his algebraic models
lends credence to treating ratings as interval scales
[4].
The basis for DEMO of the statistical tests is analysis
of variance applied to the rating data of each individual
subject. Since there are two entries per cell, the
statistical significance of both main effects and the
interaction term can DEMO tested. Note that the ANOVA
approach requires only the assumption that the depen-
dent variable is an interval scale. No assumptions need
be made DEMO the scaling of the independent variables.
This is important, since the DEMO examined are
multiplicative models. The results obtained from such
models are not invariant if both the components have
only interval scaling and they are DEMO multiplied.
Having both components ratio-scaled is necessary.
Hence, approaches using a DEMO scales for the com-
ponents have severe problems, since subjects pre-
DEMO do not provide ratio-scaled ratings of such
components as importance or evaluation. Thus multi-
attribute models seem to require more sophisticated
data than subjects DEMO provide. However, the ANOVA
approach avoids this problem since subjects are DEMO
asked to rate the components. Thus the patterns of
responses can be examined without attacking this
scaling issue. These patterns are strictly an empirical
DEMO relating to subjects' implicit use and coding of
the components, and not related to this scaling issue
per se. In fact Anderson [3] DEMO the subjects'
responses to derive scales rather than assume them
a priori. However, to reiterate, scaling of the indepen-
dent variables is DEMO the present focus; it is unnecessary
in order to determine the DEMO forms discussed later.
Only assumptions about the dependent variable, af-
fect, are necessary for this purpose. Coding and scaling
considerations are useful for DEMO these model
forms, however.
As indicated previously, both statistical and graphi-
cal criteria were used to develop the categories.
However, the statistical criteria which were employed
varied to some extent; for certain categories it seemed
appropriate
(a = .05), while for others the amount of explained
variance as measured by J(2 was employed [19, 20].

The particular reasons for choice DEMO criteria will be
discussed as the categories are presented. Before
proceeding to the description of the categories, it seems
useful to show an example of the raw data which
were analyzed and the results of the DEMO based
on these data. This illustration may help to clarify
some of the discussion to follow. Table 1 shows the
data and the ANOVA DEMO Subject 113, who performed
the Fishbein task. In the top portion DEMO the table are
the affect ratings for each combination of evaluation
and belief levels, with each entry representing the
mean of the two replicates. The bottom portion of
the table shows the ANOVA. These data are DEMO

Category I -No Significant Effects- "No Effects."
Subjects falling into this category have no significant
effects for either the treatments or the interaction.
They either act randomly DEMO concentrate their affect
ratings at a single level. As a group they are essentially
uninteresting and their ratings may result from low
task involvement.
DEMO 2-Significant Main Effects-"Adding
Model." Subjects in this category have either DEMO
or both main effects significant, but have no significant
interaction effects. DEMO data plots correspond to
Figure l(b), i.e., a set DEMO parallel lines. The underlying
theoretical model implied is addition of terms.
Category 3-Significant Main Effects, Significant
Interaction Concentrated in the Bilinear Term-"Un-
ipolar Multiplying Model." Subjects in this category
have two significant main effects and a significant

corresponds to the assumptions of the adequacy-
importance model. The basic principle underlying this
category is that in combining DEMO by multiply-
ing, holding one factor constant produces data which
are DEMO straight line in the other factor; hence, the
emphasis is on the linear by linear (bilinear) interaction
term. For computational details, see [4, p. 157].
Category 4-Major Portion of Explained Variance
in Interaction- "DEMO Multiplying Model. " In this
category the first departure is made from the use of
significance levels as criteria. The rationale is as
follows: for the underlying
bipolar multiplying
unambiguous
(as measured by &2) should be concentrated in the
interaction. The prediction for this model contrasts
with DEMO of the unipolar multiplying model for which
there is no a priori basis for assigning explained
variance, except to say that it should be distributed
among the treatment effects and the interaction.
Whereas the use of DEMO standard significance level is
a sensible procedure for defining the category corre-
sponding to the unipolar multiplying and adding
models, the use of explained variance for the bipolar
multiplying model gives additional information about
the data. DEMO is a particularly appropriate procedure
in view of the nature of the data. There were cases
in which both main effects were significant (in addition
to the significant interaction), yet the amount of
explained variance DEMO the interaction was over 70%,
while in total the two main effects accounted for less
than 10%. In such cases the data plots DEMO virtually
indistinguishable from those in which there were no
significant main effects, but a significant interaction.
For those reasons, it seemed reasonable to DEMO
criteria based upon explained variance.
The particular criteria which had to be met for
inclusion in this category were as follows: the amount
of explained variance in the interaction, as measured
by C2, had to DEMO at least 35%, and in addition, had
to be at least 3 times greater than the explained variance
for each main effect taken DEMO Although these
criteria are purely judgmental, an examination of the
characteristics DEMO subjects placed in this category,

Category 5-Major Portion of Explained Variance
in One Main Effect and DEMO Interaction- "Asymmetric
Multiplying Model." Subjects in this category have
one strong main effect which explains roughly the
same proportion of the variance as DEMO the interaction.
The specific criteria formulated were that 0d2 for one
main effect was less than 10% of the total cO2, and
further, DEMO less than 25% of the C2 for the other
main effect. Such data were not predicted from the
simple coding and combination rules discussed DEMO
Graphical presentation of this model and discussion
of its implications are presented later.
Category 6-Significant Main Effects, Significant
Interaction Not Concentrated in the Bilinear Term-
"Curvilinear Multiplying Model." Subjects in this
category have two significant DEMO effects, but tests
of the interaction showed a significant residual in-
DEMO after the bilinear term was extracted. This
category is clearly related to Category 3. The major
distinction between them is nonlinearity which is
present DEMO this model, but not in the unipolar multiply-
ing model. In DEMO, the amount of explained
variance in each main effect is sufficiently DEMO
relative to that in the interaction, so that subjects
are not DEMO into Categories 4 or 5. Since data

certainly not predicted, and will be considered later.
One further issue should be discussed concerning
graphical presentation DEMO the rating data. Anderson
[3, 4, 6] uses what he calls functional measurement
to obtain subjective scale values for the stimulus factor
levels DEMO are then used to aid in plotting the data.
The details are given in Anderson and Shanteau [6];
the basic idea is that DEMO row and column averages
of the subject's rating data provide scale values for
the levels of each factor (see [27] for a dissenting
view). If the factor used for the horizontal axis in
plotting DEMO data is spaced on the horizontal axis
according to these functional scales, the form of the
model becomes more apparent. However, this is DEMO
only for those cases which satisfy the adding or
unipolar multiplying model. Departures from the model
infirm the scale values. Thus, to provide comparability
across data plots, all graphs were plotted as if the
levels of the independent variables (factors) were
intervally spaced from 1 to 5 DEMO the horizontal axis.
These are only labels for the graphs, however. DEMO
discussed above, specific scale values for the indepen-
dent variables need DEMO be assumed in order to analyze
the data.
Figure 2 graphs the summary data from the two
rating tasks. The data from the adequacy-importance
DEMO exhibit the diverging fan pattern, which is charac-
teristic of the DEMO multiplying model's algebra,
although there appears to be a distinct nonlinearity
in the data, as evidenced by its curvilinear nature
for low levels of B . The data from the Fishbein
task clearly exhibit DEMO bipolar multiplying effect
required by the Fishbein model, although some asym-
DEMO is present. Based on the results of this aggregate
level analysis, DEMO might be concluded that both the
adequacy-importance model and the Fishbein model
are reasonably valid representations of consumer
decision rules. In both cases, the multiplicative form
of the multi-attribute model appears to have been
supported. However, the intent of this research is

to examine behavior at the individual level, since
heterogeneity of response DEMO is an important
criterion for model validity; accordingly, the various
categories identified in the data will now be discussed.
Figure 3 shows the DEMO of subjects who satisfied
the criteria for an adding model. The plot in 3(a) is
for a typical subject, while 3(b) and 3(c) are the grouped
data for subjects who received the adequacy-impor-
tance and Fishbein tasks, respectively. Both of the

of Figure l(b), and a DEMO number of subjects

adequacy-importance task and 18 for the Fishbein task.

The graphs in Figure 5 are data DEMO subjects who
satisfied the criteria for the bipolar multiplying model.
A typical subject data plot is shown in 5(a), while
5(b) and 5(c) show data for 11 adequacy-importance
subjects and 44 Fishbein subjects respectively. All
plots correspond well to the theoretical graph of Figure
DEMO(c). Table 2 indicates the high proportion of explained
variance attributable to the interaction relative to the
main effects.
The results above show DEMO only 14 subjects (17%)
followed the underlying theoretical model for DEMO
adequacy-importance task, while 44 subjects (57%)
appeared to utilize a bipolar multiplying model for
the Fishbein task. This difference is highly significant
(X2 = 29.1, d.f. = 1, p < .001). Even DEMO the very
conservative assumption of ordinal equivalence, in
which case the DEMO models of Category 2 are
combined with the unipolar multiplying models for
the adequacy-importance task, the Fishbein model still
performs significantly better (X2 DEMO 5.4, d.f. = 1, p
< .05). Further, for DEMO adequacy-importance task
11 subjects acted as though they were using a bipolar
multiplying model, while for the Fishbein task only
3 subjects appeared to be following the unipolar
multiplying model. Thus, not only is there relatively
more heterogeneity for the adequacy-importance
model, but the coding implied by subjects' responses
differs from that of the model, as it is typically
DEMO
Figure 6 shows the data for subjects satisfying the
criteria of the asymmetric model, 6(a) being for a
typical subject, while 6(b) and 6(c) are grouped data
for the two tasks. DEMO subjects from the ade-
quacy-importance task and four from the Fishbein
task are involved. It should be noted that for these
plots the horizontal DEMO corresponds to the stimulus
scale for which the main effect was very small (impor-
tance for the adequacy-importance task and belief for
the Fishbein task-see Table 2). The plots form
diverging fans of straight lines DEMO are symmetrical
about a line drawn parallel to the X-axis. If the scales
are reversed, the plots look quite different, forming
a narrow DEMO pattern running from the bottom
left to top right of the graph.
This particular category is interesting for two rea-
sons. First the main DEMO which accounts for high
explained variance differs for the two tasks. The
adequacy component demonstrates a strong main
effect for the adequacy-importance task, while the
evaluation component exhibited the strong effect for
the Fishbein task. (Within each task all subjects in
this category had the same strong main DEMO) The
former result is particularly interesting in light of
previous research DEMO a hybrid of the adequacy-impor-
tance model advocated by Sheth [29], DEMO has been
labeled the "beliefs-only" model. Some studies have
reported rather substantial correlations for this model
[16, 23], so it seems more DEMO mere coincidence
that the adequacy factor, rather than the importance
factor, was the one which exhibited a main effect
in the Asymmetric Multiplying DEMO
A second observation is that the pattern of data
shown in Figures 6(b) and 6(c) is exactly what would
be expected DEMO subjects had coded one of the two
types of information on a bipolar basis and the other
as unipolar before "multiplying." In the DEMO, the
horizontal axis corresponds to the dimension which
was apparently treated DEMO a unipolar fashion. Thus,
it appears that the 13 adequacy-importance task sub-
jects falling into this group treated importance as
unipolar, while the 4 Fishbein task subjects treated
likelihood on a unipolar basis. These results, while
characterizing only a relatively small portion of the
total sample, may serve to point out sources of
COGNITIVE
ALGEBRA

ATTITUDE
MODELS
ambiguity in the two models as DEMO are currently
operationalized. There are alternative interpretations
of this pattern of results: for instance, subjects may
have "coded" both scales from -1 DEMO +3, instead
of -2 to +2 as the Fishbein model assumes, or 1
to 5, as the adequacy-importance model assumes; or
subjects DEMO when given an unimportant attribute
that the brand was moderately acceptable on other
attributes not presented and took this into account
in their ratings. DEMO, the interpretation given is
more favorable to the adequacy-importance model,
DEMO hence more conservative given the conclusions,
since it assumed only one scale is treated as bipolar
rather than both.
It is now fairly DEMO that a relatively large proportion
of the subjects in the adequacy-importance task treated
the adequacy stimuli as bipolar rather than unipolar.
Eleven subjects in DEMO bipolar multiplying category
and 13 more in the asymmetric multiplying category
fit this description, meaning that over 40% of the
subjects treated the adequacy data differently than
the typical operationalization of the adequacy-impor-
tance model.
Also, considerable controversy has surrounded the
importance component of the adequacy-importance
model [28]. DEMO results indicate that the mixed
findings related to this component may be traced to
individual differences in how subjects treat a scale
ranging from "not important at all" to "very impor-
tant." While some may view the scale as intended
by the researcher, other subjects appear to treat the
scale as something akin to a scale whose end points
DEMO read "very important (not to have the attri-
bute)" to "very important (to have the attribute)."
The latter scale DEMO clearly bipolar in nature, while the
former is unipolar. The fact DEMO there appears to
be some ambiguity in how subjects interpret the
importance scale suggests further work on the devel-
opment of a reliable and DEMO measure of this compo-
nent is necessary. This component very probably led
to the greater heterogeneity of response patterns for
the adequacy-importance model.
Finally, analogous to the above arguments, there
is some indication that subjects have difficulty inter-
preting the "likely-unlikely" scale used to opera-
tionalize the DEMO j component in the Fishbein model.
This finding is in agreement with previous research
[22], and Ahtola [ 1 ] has argued that to treat subjective
probabilities (which is what b ijrepresents theoretically)
as bipolar is inappropriate. The fact that the over-
whelming majority of subjects in DEMO Fishbein task
tended to treat the likelihood measure as bipolar is
somewhat surprising, since intuitively likelihood would
seem to be a unipolar construct. One plausible expla-
nation for this phenomenon is that subjects were
engaging in DEMO balancing, rather than cognitive
adding, which is the basis for the Fishbein model
[1]. However, the test this hypothesis would require
161
an attitude change paradigm, which was beyond the
scope of this research.
Finally, Figure 7 shows the data for subjects satisfy-
ing the criteria of the curvilinear multiplying model,
7(a) being for a typical subject, and 7(b) for grouped
data for the 18 adequacy-importance subjects. DEMO
two Fishbein subjects satisfied the criteria. The plots
show, as expected, some relationship to those of Figure
4, the unipolar multiplying model. The suggestion of
a diverging fan of straight lines is present, but there
is a marked curvilinearity at low levels of adequacy
(B0i). In all cases the data show that at low importance
levels, affect was either low and constant, or low
and increasing as belief increased; DEMO, at low levels
of belief, the affect value was initially low, rose, and
then fell again as importance increased. The suggestion
of DEMO pattern is present even in the summary of
the unipolar multiplying model, Figure 4(b).

The reason for such results under the adequacy-
importance task becomes clear upon examination of
the algebraic DEMO underlying the model. The
adequacy-importance model assumes that an attribute
for which belief of possession is very low (Bij = 1)
but is very important (Ii = 5) will contribute more
to affect than DEMO attribute for which belief of posses-
sion is very low (Bij DEMO 1) but which is not important
at all (Ii = 1), since (5)(1) > (1)(1). (Again, note that
these numbers are used as examples of typical scale
values DEMO in previous research, not as scale values
assumed for this study. DEMO values need not be
assumed for the ANOVA.) This prediction is DEMO
tive to say the least, and subjects in this category
reacted DEMO a way counter to this model algebra assump-
tion. Again, recall DEMO this argument is not strictly
applicable to the cases where the adequacy-importance
model has been used for ranking alternatives rather
than predicting an affect DEMO
162
The presence of the curvilinear effect in Figure
4(b) for the unipolar multiplying model suggests that
the adequacy-importance model had this problem DEMO
for subjects who fulfilled the statistical criteria for
the adequacy-importance model's cognitive algebra.
Thus the curvilinear category contains subjects who
essentially multiply but DEMO show even more marked
deviations from linearity at low levels of belief than
the unipolar multiplying subjects.
The total set of results is complex, so the implica-
tions are now summarized. One of the purposes of
DEMO present research was to examine the validity of
the multiplicative assumptions underlying the general
class of multi-attribute attitude models by using a
simplified single-attribute DEMO From Table 2 it can
be seen that a relatively large number of the subjects
in both tasks (66% for the adequacy-importance task
and 69% for the Fishbein task) were essentially behav-
ing as though they multiplied the 2 components of
the model. This finding can be regarded DEMO strong
support for the validity of the general class of models,
insofar as the single-attribute task yields information
about the multi-attribute case.
A DEMO purpose was to examine the differences
between the components and coding used for the
Fishbein model and the adequacy-importance model
in terms of (1) the heterogeneity of subjects' response
patterns, and (2) the data coding procedures subjects
apparently used in the task corresponding to each
model. DEMO there were virtually the same number
of "multipliers" among the subjects engaging in the
respective tasks, there is clear evidence in Table 2
that the cognitive algebra pattern of the Fishbein task
subjects was much DEMO homogeneous than that of
the adequacy-importance task subjects. Also, the
typical DEMO rules of the Fishbein model seem more
representative of subjects' implicit DEMO rules than
those of the adequacy-importance model. Of the
subjects classified into the 4 multiplying categories,
only 25% fit the assumed model (unipolar multiplying)
under the adequacy-importance task, while 83% fell
into the appropriate category (bipolar multiplying) in
the Fishbein task. Furthermore, nearly 25% of the
adequacy-importance task subjects were classified as
bipolar multiplying, but only 3 subjects in the Fishbein
task fit the unipolar multiplying category.
From this DEMO of results, it is clear that the
type of cognitive algebra DEMO person appears to use is
affected substantially by the scales used to measure
cognitive constructs. Unfortunately, it is impossible
to know which way of representing cognitive con-
structs corresponds with "truth." Therefore, reliance
must be placed on external criteria such as homogene-
ity of response patterns across DEMO and the ulti-
mate usefulness of the model, as operationalized, to
the policy-maker. Based on these criteria, the Fishbein
form of the model seems relatively superior to the
adequacy-importance model. This conclusion is based

on the more homogeneous pattern of responses exhib-
ited by subjects in the Fishbein task. Of course there
is DEMO heterogeneity within each task, so these conclu-
sions are only relative, not absolute. In addition, the
subjective coding apparently used by subjects corre-
sponds well with the coding typically used in the data
analysis stage DEMO the Fishbein task. Thus the marketing
manager can utilize the Fishbein model with consider-
ably more confidence than he can the adequacy-
importance model DEMO he wishes to predict affect.
If he wishes to predict only the rank order of brands,
the results do not speak directly to DEMO issue; however,
it may be argued, as above, that DEMO results should
give cause for thought even in the latter case.
DISCUSSION
AND CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate individual differences in sub-
jects' combination rules. This implies that the task
does have some degree of realism, since different
rules were shown. However, future research should
more directly examine this issue. Lack of involvement
in the task may lead to simple additive DEMO; this
could be checked by attempting to manipulate degree
of involvement DEMO examining the resulting cognitive
algebra types. Also, one could attempt to DEMO
whether the factorial task forced consistency in sub-
jects' responses by DEMO the task and determin-
ing the effect of the interruption on the resultant
cognitive algebra types.
An important advantage of the ANOVA method
is DEMO it allows the study of individual differences
in handling information not easily undertaken in the
typical correlational design. The study of individual
differences reported DEMO is one contribution of this
study to the methodology of information integration
research. This issue has been essentially ignored by
Anderson [4], as his work has usually involved small
numbers of subjects. Individual differences analysis
could DEMO an important tool for examining issues such
as whether subjects combine the information for all
attributes in the same fashion; this was simply assumed
earlier, since there are no relevant data or theory. It
may be true that subjects use different combination
rules for different subsets of attributes. DEMO seems
to be a fruitful area for further research. One additional
contribution to the methodology of information in-
tegration studies is in the use DEMO t)2 as a criterion
for selecting model types. It is believed that this study
is the first to use 6C2 in this manner.
DEMO, there are significant results for attitude
research. Again, these results are subject to the caveats
that only single attributes were used and that DEMO results
are relevant more for models attempting to predict
affect than for models predicting rank preferences.
Given these limitations, the main findings are twofold:
(1) there is considerable support for the multiplicative
form of DEMO models, although there is a
significant proportion of the population which DEMO

to use some other form DEMO data handling strategy;
and (2) the Fishbein model represents the cognitive
algebra of subjects relatively better than the ade-
quacy-importance model since DEMO is greater homo-
geneity of response in the Fishbein task. The evidence
also points strongly to the conclusion that the cognitive
components of the DEMO model (i.e., ai and bi.)
are indeed treated in a bipolar manner and multiplied,
as assumed by the Fishbein model algebra.
DEMO the adequacy-importance model the evidence
points to the conclusion that the scales used to opera-
tionalize the model are ambiguous. Even those subjects
who DEMO to treat both stimuli as unipolar exhibited
curvilinearity in their data. As indicated in the previous
section, their behavior, while not following model
DEMO, is nonetheless intuitively reasonable.
The weight of the evidence, then, DEMO to indicate
that the Fishbein components are less ambiguous than
the adequacy-importance model components, and that
the Fishbein model algebra corresponds to subjects'
cognitive algebra more closely than adequacy-impor-
tance model algebra. The adequacy importance DEMO,
with its typical unipolar coding scheme, makes very
nonintuitive assumptions DEMO high importance-low
belief items, and the nature of importance itself as
DEMO unipolar rather than bipolar scale seems to cause
problems. Most subjects were able to deal with "very
bad" in the Fishbein task, but many subjects seemed
uncertain about how to deal with "not at all important"
in the adequacy-importance task. Thus, in terms of
an approach to validation using individual subject
patterns of information combination as the data. DEMO
Fishbein approach to attitudes seems to be relatively
more valid. Cohen, DEMO, and Ahtola [16] have
argued conceptually why this is so, and the data of
the study presented here seem to bear out their
DEMO
This finding is particularly important for marketing
applications of these models, DEMO the real issue
is that subjects respond much more heterogeneously
to the adequacy-importance task than to the Fishbein
task. If cross-sectional analyses are to DEMO used in
real applications, then presumably one should try to
minimize DEMO controllable sources of heterogeneity.
The results presented here imply that one should use
the Fishbein approach to do this. This could be
particularly important DEMO the model is being used in
a disaggregated sense for diagnosis.
