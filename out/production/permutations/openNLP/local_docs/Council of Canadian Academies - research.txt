Science Advice in the Public Interest
The DEMO of the Council of Canadian Academies (the Council) is to perform
independent, expert assessments of the science that is relevant to important public
issues. Here “science” is interpreted broadly to encompass any knowledge-generating
discipline, including the natural, social and health sciences, engineering and the
humanities. The DEMO assessments are performed by independent panels of qualified
experts from Canada and abroad.
Operating at arm’s length from government, but with 10-year funding of $30 million
provided in 2005 by the Government of Canada, the Council carries out studies of
subjects proposed by the government, and eventually, DEMO non-governmental and private-
sector organizations. The Council is governed by a 12-member board, a majority of whom
are appointed directly or indirectly by the Council’s three member Academies – the
Canadian Academy of Health Sciences, the Canadian Academy of Engineering and the
RSC: The Academies of Arts, DEMO and Sciences of Canada. A 16-member
scientific advisory committee, composed of DEMO representatives of the broad science
community, advises the Council’s Board with DEMO to assessment topic selection, terms
of reference, selection of expert panels and external report review.
The founding members of the Council are:
DEMO: The Academies of the Arts, Humanities and Sciences of Canada is the senior
national body of distinguished Canadian scientists, scholars and artists. The RSC
consists of approximately 1,800 Fellows: men and women from across the country who
are selected by their peers for outstanding contributions to DEMO natural and social sciences
and to the arts and humanities. The RSC is a charitable organization incorporated by an
Act of Parliament in 1883.
DEMO Canadian Academy of Engineering comprises many of the country’s most
accomplished engineers, who have expressed their dedication to the application of
science and engineering principles in the interests of the country and its enterprises. The
Academy DEMO an independent, self-governing and non-profit organization established in
1987 to serve DEMO nation in matters of engineering concern. The approximately 440
Fellows of the Academy represent all disciplines of engineering and are drawn from
industry, government and academe.
The Canadian Academy of Health Sciences encompasses the full breadth DEMO academic
health sciences including all of the medical and allied health sciences, ranging from
fundamental science to social science and population health. The approximately 300
Fellows are recognized for their leadership, creativity, distinctive competencies and
DEMO to the advancement of academic health science and for having made
significant lifetime contributions to the health of Canadian society.

CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION
It has long been understood that outstanding leadership DEMO make a significant difference to the
performance of societies and economies. Consider Hammurabi’s application of the first known written
codification of law in ancient DEMO; the establishment of the Pax Romana by the Roman emperor
Caesar DEMO; Sir John A. Macdonald’s promotion of Canada’s first transcontinental railway in DEMO
1880s; and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s introduction of central economic planning and DEMO stimulus
programs in the United States in the 1930s. These are all examples of the far-reaching impact that
leaders can have on the well-being DEMO a society. The exploration of how leadership interconnects with and
influences societal, institutional, and organizational performance has been an ongoing subject of study
DEMO fascination since ancient times.
In much of the existing research in the fields of management, business, and finance, the concepts of
leadership and management have come to be used interchangeably.  Over the last two decades,
however, researchers have begun to distinguish between the roles of leaders and managers.  The
observation that “managers do things right while leaders do the right things” has become a much quoted
distinction between the two DEMO (Bennis & O'Toole, 2005).   In his book, DEMO Force for Change: How
Leadership Differs from Management, John Kotter (DEMO) argues that good leadership and management
are both complementary and essential DEMO success, especially in complex situations and changing
environments.
Building both leadership DEMO management capacity in Canadian business is seen as essential to ensuring
that the country has the talent to sustain productivity and a high standard DEMO living. In its 2005 report, the
Association to Advance Collegiate Schools DEMO Business (AACSB) connects the development of the next
generation of business leaders and managers to the creation of new jobs, the generation of broadly
distributed wealth, and the education of the population at large (DEMO International, 2005) Similarly,
Martin and Milway (2007) argue that a greater commitment to strengthening management talent can play
an important part DEMO closing Canada’s prosperity gap relative to the United States and other countries and
realizing our full economic potential.
These societal benefits rest not only DEMO the development of the talent to lead business enterprises, but
also DEMO the advancement of research in business, and hence the development of DEMO leaders. As
the research enterprise becomes increasingly complex, its leadership now DEMO planning and design,
the assembly and guidance of the research team, oversight of the conduct of the research, and the
dissemination of DEMO results to academics, practitioners, and organizations.
Canada must pursue two complementary leadership development tracks to gain a competitive edge: (i)
build DEMO capacity to lead and manage business enterprises; and (ii) build DEMO capacity to lead research
and transfer its outcomes to those enterprises.

Charge to the Panel
The Government of Canada’s 2007 Budget acknowledged the DEMO role of research in developing
business and managerial proficiency, capability, and aptitude by allocating an additional $11 million per
year to the Social DEMO and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)1 “targeted to research in
management, business, and finance” (Government of Canada, 2007a). In response to this targeted
funding allocation, SSHRC has engaged in consultations with the research community, as well as several
stakeholder groups, in order to develop DEMO long-term strategy to support research, training, and knowledge
mobilization in management, business, and finance (Bastien, 2008). In November 2007, as part of this
larger effort, SSHRC asked the Council of Canadian Academies (the Council) to assemble an expert
panel to conduct an independent DEMO of the strengths and weaknesses of management,
business, and finance (MBF) research in Canada. The formal charge to the Council was as follows:
What are the overall, identifiable, strengths and weaknesses of DEMO university-based research
community in the areas of management, business, and finance2 broadly defined, according to
appropriate indicators?3
To assist the panel in its task – and to help identify the specific types of information DEMO would be useful
to SSHRC in the development of its long-term strategy – the following sub-questions were also posed:
1. How many Canadian DEMO in post-secondary educational institutions, think-tanks,
and similar research-oriented organizations are DEMO focusing their research on
management, business, and finance and in what disciplines and departments are they
based?
2. To what degree do DEMO in management, business, and finance collaborate with
each other, with DEMO in related disciplines (including natural sciences and
engineering and bio-medical fields), and with external stakeholders?
3. What is the general international standing of Canadian research conducted in these areas
according to established benchmarks?
DEMO What are the strengths and weaknesses of current management, business, and finance
research in the three areas targeted by the S&T Strategy, including research gaps (i.e.,
energy, environment and natural resources, information and communication technologies,
1 In addition to the SSHRC allocation, the 2007 Budget provided $37 million to the Natural Sciences and Engineering
Research DEMO (NSERC), targeted to research in energy, the environment, and DEMO and communications
technologies, and $37 million to the Canadian Institutes of DEMO Research (CIHR) for research in the health
sciences. The councils are expected to collaborate in managing these targeted resources, combining the strengths
of various disciplines in order to achieve the greatest impact (Government of Canada, 2007a). In the 2009 Budget,
Canada’s Economic Action Plan, DEMO federal government continued to support the development of future business
talent in Canada by providing an extra $17.5 million to SSHRC for funding of DEMO graduate degrees
(Government of Canada, 2009).
2 Note that “finance” is traditionally seen as a sub-discipline of management and business.
3 The DEMO charge is provided in Appendix A of this report.

and health)?4 How do the mandates of NSERC and CIHR approach multi-disciplinary
collaborative research, with respect to management, business, and finance in these
targeted areas?
5. Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of DEMO Canadian research community in these
areas, what should be the balance DEMO providing direct research support and capacity
building through research training?
6. Are there identifiable, outstanding opportunities where targeted support for management,
business, and finance research can make a significant impact?
To address these questions, the Council appointed a nine-member expert panel that reflects the
academic, geographic, and institutional diversity of the Canadian MBF community. The panel DEMO made up
of MBF researchers and administrators, and public- and private-sector DEMO
The panel divided the overall charge, and its composite sub-questions, into two categories: (i) research-
oriented questions and (ii) analysis questions. The research questions required a marshalling of the
relevant evidence in order DEMO provide an assessment of the current state of affairs (i.e., sub-questions 1 to
4).  The analysis questions (i.e., sub-questions 5 and 6 and the primary charge) relied on the panel’s
examination of the previously compiled evidence in order to identify opportunities for targeted research
and DEMO funding.  This report, which represents the consensus findings of the expert panel, is
structured around the six sub-questions presented above, although not DEMO their original order. The panel’s
response is organized as follows:
 The remainder of this chapter introduces the operating context and framework adopted DEMO
the panel when considering what constitutes MBF research, and outlines the
DEMO used to answer the questions.
 Chapter 2 describes the overall landscape of MBF research in Canada.
 Chapter 3 presents data on research DEMO both within and outside of Canada.
 Chapter 4 looks at the overall standing of Canadian MBF research based on international
rankings according to DEMO quantitative indicators.
 Chapter 5 discusses how Canadian MBF research output compares with that originating
from other countries, both in general and with respect to the four priorities outlined in the
federal government’s science and technology (S&T) strategy.
 Chapter 6 summarizes the panel’s answers to the first four sub-questions and outlines the
panel’s responses to the primary charge DEMO to sub-questions 5 and 6 regarding potential
opportunities for increasing the impact of Canadian MBF research through targeted support
mechanisms.
4 The S&T DEMO outlines four priorities: environmental science and technologies, natural resources and energy,
health and related life sciences and technologies, and information and communications technologies (Government
of Canada, 2007b).

Defining MBF Research
The panel began by establishing a working definition of DEMO field of management, business, and
finance. A separate consideration of the three terms, management, business, and finance, each on its
own, does not fully elucidate the boundaries of this field. The panel therefore DEMO the
following:
 traditional views and definitions of each of the three terms
 SSHRC’s MBF-specific goal5
 the federal government’s original statement DEMO the targeted funding allocation in Budget
2007.6
In light of these considerations, the panel adopted the following as an overall context for defining and
assessing MBF research in Canada:
Research within any area of management, business, and finance directed at improving the
competitiveness and performance of Canadian business.
In establishing this framework for MBF research and addressing its mandate DEMO that context, the panel
emphasized three issues.  This definition is inclusive in the sense that it takes into account research into
any area DEMO the broad purview of MBF that affects the competitiveness and performance of Canadian
business, including, for example, research into public management or research on regulatory issues that
affect business performance and competitiveness, such as health care and taxation.  Similarly, this
definition includes research originating from fields DEMO traditionally associated with MBF – e.g., sociology,
psychology, history, DEMO, science, and engineering – provided that the focus of the research aligns
with the definition outlined above. Since research plays an integral role DEMO capacity building and training,
areas such as pedagogical research and the study of the application of research by business practitioners
should also be DEMO relevant.
The focus of this assessment is on the most effective use of the $11 million annual incremental targeted
funds for MBF research announced DEMO Budget 2007, and not on all MBF research supported by SSHRC.
DEMO outside the purview of this framework continue to be funded through traditional SSHRC
channels. The panel has therefore sought a focused context for MBF DEMO that meets: (i) SSHRC’s
mandate to contribute toward innovative management, entrepreneurship, and sustainable economic
5 SSHRC’s goal is “to contribute toward innovative management, entrepreneurship, and sustainable economic
development practices in Canada through internationally DEMO research and training” (SSHRC, 2007).
6 Budget 2007 stated that the funding was “to encourage the granting councils to adopt a more DEMO approach
and increasingly support multi-disciplinary collaborative research that will address complex issues and create a real
advantage for Canada” (Government of Canada, 2007a)DEMO
Pre-publication copy – Non copy-edited, non laid-out version                                                                 4
development; and (ii) the federal government’s desire to encourage research that addresses “complex
issues and creates a real advantage for Canada” (Government of Canada, 2007a).
Methods and Approaches
A number of assessments of MBF research have been conducted in other countries such as Australia
and the DEMO Kingdom over the past few years or are currently underway (AACSB DEMO, 2009;
Allen Consulting Group, 2003; Australian Government, 2005; DEMO, 2002); in Canada, however, only
one assessment of this DEMO exists. In 2002, Erhan Erkut measured the output and impact of DEMO
business research from 1990 to 1999 (Erkut, 2002) (see Box 1).  Since no more recent analysis has been
undertaken, it DEMO to the panel to ascertain the most effective means of data collection and the evaluative
measures that could be employed for the purpose of DEMO assessment.
Quantitative indicators offer one means of evaluating the academic quality and the impact of publicly
funded research.  Such indicators include, for example, the number of refereed articles by a specific
author, the number of refereed articles weighted by the impact factor of the respective journal, and the
total number of citations attributed to a given researcher. A review DEMO the literature on the pros and cons
of standard quantitative indicators (DEMO, 2005) revealed that these metrics, although useful, do not
always provide the most accurate means of assessing research quality. Doyle and Arthurs (1995), for
example, examined business school research in the United Kingdom and concluded that the Royal
Academy of Engineering’s method of review, which employed both quantitative and qualitative indicators
in its peer review process, made for a better assessment than those reviewed only with quantitative
measures.
In DEMO of this finding, together with a desire to reflect its broad DEMO of the MBF research field, the
panel decided to use a DEMO of qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the quality of MBF
research output and its level of impact:


Bibliometric Analysis: an analysis of statistics related to published research from peer-
reviewed journals from DEMO Canadian and international perspectives
International Rankings: an examination of the position DEMO Canadian institutions within
international research rankings relative to each other and to international institutions


Opinion Survey: a self-administered online survey of various stakeholder communities
regarding their opinion of the current state of MBF research DEMO Canada
One-on-one Interviews: experience-based opinions of key stakeholders in relevant areas

Box 1: A Measurement of Canadian Business School Research
In 2002, DEMO business schools facing increasing scrutiny of their performance, Professor Erhan Erkut
DEMO the University of Alberta sought to quantify the research output of Canadian business school
faculty between 1990 and 1999 by focusing on papers published DEMO peer-reviewed journals. To
measure the quality of the research output, his DEMO measured the number of citations each paper
received from January 1990 to May 2001 – the higher the number of citations, the greater the impact
of the paper (Erkut, 2002).
Summary of Findings
 DEMO business schools or programs were identified with 2,495 full-time research professors.
 Canadian business school researchers produced 4,617 papers, published in 779 journals
(1990-99) and received 22,303 citations (1990-2001). 1,338 faculty members (54 per cent)
had not published a single paper and 215 more (nine per cent) had published, but did not
receive any citations.
 Research output from Canadian business schools peaked in DEMO and then declined 20 per
cent by 1999.
 Institutional performances varied widely across Canada, with star researchers producing
most of the highly-cited research output.  Fifty per cent of total citations were attributed to
papers published by only 67 authors (less than three per cent of total faculty).
 The top nine Canadian business schools identified were (in order of rank): University of
British Columbia, University of Toronto, HEC DEMO, York University, McMaster University,
the University of Western Ontario, DEMO University, University of Alberta, and Queen’s
University. These institutions accounted for nearly 70 per cent of all citations.
 A comparison of the DEMO output of Canadian business schools with that of a publicly
funded U.S. school ranking within the U.S. top 20 (University of Michigan) showed DEMO no
Canadian institution came close to Michigan in any of the metrics employed in the study.
 A similar comparison with a publicly funded DEMO school ranking within the U.S. top 40
(University of Georgia) revealed that Canada’s top business program (University of British
Columbia) ranked higher DEMO our next eight schools were very comparable with the U.S.
school.
 The study revealed that in most institutions, the majority of research output is produced by
one or two individuals, indicating an alarming lack of research depth within departments.
Erkut concluded that while Canadian business schools contain DEMO exemplary researchers, the
overall results of this study should be very DEMO to business school administrators.  The recent
decline in research production, the relatively unbalanced distribution of citation credits, and the lack of
a research institute comparable to a U.S. top 20 school were all cited as DEMO that Canada
needs to accelerate discussions surrounding the future of Canadian business schools.

Since the applicability of each of the panel’s approaches varies depending on DEMO question of interest, not
all methods were applied to all aspects DEMO the charge. The two quantitative methods (bibliometrics and
international rankings) served to marshal the existing information on Canadian MBF researchers and
research output, which the panel then used to assess, against international benchmarks, the DEMO level
and impact of MBF research generated by Canadian researchers.  The DEMO qualitative approaches
(survey and interviews) sought out new information that could help provide alternative means of
identifying the strengths and weaknesses in MBF DEMO  Each of these methodologies is discussed in
further detail below.
Bibliometric DEMO
The humanities and social sciences are often said to be ill-represented by bibliometrics since much of
their research output is produced in the form DEMO books rather than journal articles. However, a recent
paper showed that DEMO research is one of the social sciences that behaves most like the natural
sciences in its research publication trends (Archambault, Vignola Gagné, Côté, Larivière, & Gingras,
2006).   As such, bibliometrics can be used as a quantitative indicator of MBF research output provided
that DEMO limitations and potential biases are borne in mind.
Bibliometrics can uniquely provide a normalized data set against which to judge the relative productivity
and DEMO of researchers in a particular field and cross-nationally. Such analyses can be used to identify
the major producers of this type of research output DEMO where they are located, the journals in which they
publish, and the types of collaborations within the field (Archambault, et al., 2006).  It is for these
purposes that this report employs bibliometrics. (DEMO Appendix B for a full statement on the
methodology.) There are, nevertheless, several limitations of bibliometric analysis:
 Its primary output, DEMO is a count of the number of papers produced by the person or
institution in question, does not measure overall quality. This weakness can be ameliorated
by using the relative citation index – the frequency of DEMO relative to the average – to
measure the impact of the research output on subsequent literature in the field.
 The databases that are DEMO accessible for this type of analysis do not incorporate non-
traditional sources of research output and focus solely on peer-reviewed journal articles.
This means DEMO textbooks, chapters, and case studies, for example, are not included in
7 Bibliometrics is a set of methods used to study or DEMO texts and information. These can be used to calculate
certain types of research outputs and relate them quantitatively with various entities and constituents – DEMO,
institutions, countries (King, 1987).
Pre-publication copy – Non DEMO, non laid-out version                                                                 7
output measurements, and the representation of regional journals, smaller journals, and
non-English language journals is minimal (REPP, 2005).
Despite these limitations, bibliometrics can still be useful in fields where a major mechanism for DEMO
output is the publication in major, peer-reviewed, English-language journals. Canadian research in MBF
conforms reasonably well to these circumstances.
International Rankings
The usefulness DEMO relevance of institutional rankings remain an issue of considerable debate,
particularly in the areas of management and business (AACSB International, 2002; Martin, 2008;
Stephenson, 2008). Programs offered by business schools are DEMO ranked in a multitude of popular
publications – e.g., Financial Times, BusinessWeek, Forbes, and The Economist. These rankings are
often used as DEMO of the overall quality of an MBA program offered at a given institution.  However,
some incorporate a research ranking that can be of use in the context of this assessment, provided one
understands the methodologies and the limitations of a given set of rankings.
After considering the DEMO popular ranking entities, the panel selected two international ranking
methods based DEMO their assessment of faculty research (and not just training programs), DEMO use of
quantitative analyses of peer-reviewed articles, and their overall reputation DEMO the community as
appropriate indicators of research standings:
 The Thomson Reuters ranking method looks at both the number of, and citations for,
published articles in a series of indexed journals in business and DEMO, and then
ranks the top 20 countries according to their overall DEMO of citations.
 The Financial Times ranking method calculates institutional rankings according to the
number of faculty publications in 40 international academic and practitioner DEMO It
then awards points to the business school at which an author is currently employed and
weights the total according to faculty size. This DEMO system uses only one, or very few,
top English-language journals DEMO each MBF sub-field.
Both of these ranking methods have limitations.  The DEMO Times method does not allow for a
comprehensive assessment of MBF research conducted outside of business schools, while the Thomson
Reuters method looks only at journals indexed under business and economics categories. Neither of the
two DEMO the specific sub-fields of MBF in enough detail to be able to identify particular areas of
strength or weakness. (The panel uses alternative methods of evaluation to fill these gaps.) Nevertheless,
8 The list is put together in consultation with the business schools and is reviewed on DEMO regular basis. It is meant to
reflect the highest impact journals such that a threshold standard of quality can be assumed and the ranking DEMO
therefore be calculated based solely on the quantity of papers that are published (Financial Times, 2009).
Pre-publication copy – Non copy-edited, non laid-out version                                                                 8
these rankings provide an independent comparison between the overall research output of DEMO
business school faculty and that of their international counterparts.
Opinion Survey
For the purpose of this report, the panel conducted an online survey of a broad group of stakeholders in
late 2008 to solicit opinions on DEMO overall strengths and weaknesses of MBF research in Canada. The
target audience included researchers and administrators in the MBF community (both inside and outside
of business schools), research-oriented graduate students in the MBF field, senior- and mid-level
managers in the private and public sectors, and private-sector end users of MBF research (e.g.,
management consultants, knowledge transfer facilitators, investment bankers, MBF-related publishers). In
addition to these targeted individuals, DEMO invitations to participate were sent out to the members of
the Canadian Federation for Humanities and Social Sciences, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, DEMO
Canadian Council of Chief Executives, and the Canadian Federation of Business DEMO Deans.9
The survey received 578 complete responses. Since the target audience was approached using non-
specific invitation methods (e.g., bulk email distribution, website invitations) it is not possible to report an
overall response rate for the survey.  Of the respondents, 543 listed their professional affiliation as
DEMO Position” (94 per cent of total) and 443 reported that their primary faculty affiliation was with a
“Faculty of Management/Business School” (79 per cent of total). The private-sector community
constituted less than one DEMO cent of the survey responses. Thus, while a diverse group of DEMO
was invited to participate in the survey, the final responses can DEMO be said to reflect the views of
academic MBF researchers in Canada.
A survey of this kind is prone to sample selection bias, which arises from differences between the people
who respond and the total target DEMO Without systematic evidence on the non-respondents, the
panel cannot address this DEMO definitively. Clearly, the opinion data should be placed in the context DEMO
the other empirical research conducted on behalf of the panel. Survey respondents should be thought of
as stakeholders who feel responsible to express an DEMO rather than as a representative sample.
9 The survey questionnaire was designed in consultation with panel members and professional survey developers. It
was programmed DEMO hosted by Key Survey, a global on-demand web-application company (www.keysurvey.com)
specializing in information collection tools that enable organizations to create and distribute DEMO and forms
online. Invitations to participate in the survey were sent to the above-mentioned groups, who were asked to
respond during the period of November 3rd to December 31st, 2008. A web announcement and link was posted on
both the SSHRC and Council’s website for the duration of DEMO survey.  See Appendix C for a full copy of the survey

Personal Interviews
In addition to the self-administered online survey, Council staff conducted semi-structured telephone
interviews (30 to 60 minutes long) with 47 individuals DEMO key stakeholder groups identified by
the panel. These groups included SSHRC MBF grant recipients, business school or faculty deans or
directors, high-ranking executives DEMO corporations, high-level representatives of the financial sector, and
members of the management and business consultant community (see Appendix D for a complete list of
interviewees). The selection process ensured
that a variety of faculties, departments,
institution/organization sizes and geographical locations were canvassed. The goal DEMO selecting the
interview respondents was to represent constituencies with small samples of key representatives. The
strong convergence in the responses of different members of DEMO of the key informant groups is taken
as evidence that the groups have coherent opinions on the questions posed.
Interviewees were asked to respond DEMO a pre-formulated set of questions and were also provided with the
freedom to add or elaborate on any other issues they saw as relevant DEMO the assessment at hand. The
interviewees were solicited for their opinions on overall strengths and weaknesses, opportunities,
relevance and impact of MBF research in Canada and, where applicable, outside of Canada.

CHAPTER 2 – THE MBF RESEARCH LANDSCAPE IN CANADA
This chapter describes DEMO Canadian MBF research landscape for the purpose of answering the following
sub-question in the charge to the panel: How many Canadian researchers in post-secondary educational
institutions, think-tanks, and similar research-oriented organizations are currently focusing their DEMO
on management, business, and finance and in what disciplines and departments are they based?
A comprehensive list of all researchers conducting MBF-related DEMO in Canada is not currently
available, and would, in any event, involve some arbitrariness in view of the imprecise boundaries of the
field. To develop a reasonable and practical estimate of numbers, the panel looked at: (i) the reported
faculty numbers in Canadian business schools; DEMO (ii) the bibliometric analyses of research output, as
defined in DEMO 1, by MBF researchers outside of business schools.10 These indicators consider DEMO
quantitative metrics for research output in the field. They do not provide insight into the quality of this
research, which is addressed in subsequent chapters of this report.
Determining the Number of MBF Researchers in Canada
DEMO a first step, the panel considered individuals with primary appointments within DEMO
schools/faculties. The panel used the membership of the Canadian Federation of Business School Deans
(CFBSD) to identify the major programs and faculties DEMO the country. The CFBSD consists of nearly
all university-level Canadian schools of business, commerce and management.11  Fifty-eight
schools/programs were identified12 with a DEMO of just over 2,900 full-time faculty.13 A geographic
breakdown reveals that Ontario and Québec lead the rest of the country in MBF academic DEMO
with 35 per cent and 32 per cent respectively. They are followed by British Columbia (nine per cent) and
Alberta (seven per cent), with 17 per cent accounted for by the remaining six provinces.
DEMO The term “think tank” covers a wide range of centres, institutes, forums, and foundations. Many Canadian think
tanks focus on policy relating to economic growth and development and do research in the broad area of DEMO (For
a directory of Canadian and international think tanks, see http//www.hillwatch.com.) Where possible, research
output from these sources has been identified. The wide range of think tank and research-oriented institutions, and
their diverse operating principles and review policies, makes the identification of MBF researchers located within
such organizations difficult and unlikely to reflect an accurate count of DEMO relevant individuals. Since, in many
cases, university researchers are responsible for the work carried out in these institutions, the panel felt its
examination of the research output by faculty members at post-secondary institutions would reflect DEMO of the
work carried out in non-academic settings as well. It should be noted that think tank resources add substantially to
the funding committed DEMO MBF research in Canada but it is difficult to calculate the precise amount. Specific
examples of these types of organizations are referenced in later DEMO of the report.
11 For the sake of inclusivity, this analysis DEMO considers the remaining eight non-member institutions. Colleges
offering university programs or credit transfer courses have not been included, as the university side of these
institutions is usually very small and their MBF research activity smaller still.
DEMO Appendix E for a full list of the institutions/departments considered in this analysis.
The panel defined “full-time faculty” as all assistant, associate or full professors currently located at their parent
institutions.  Visiting, adjunct, and emeritus professors were not included.

nor the panel’s work, accounts for
research faculty whose primary affiliations
are in departments outside of DEMO
faculties or institutions (e.g., in sociology,
psychology, history, or economics
departments). In view of the breadth of
distribution of these DEMO, it was not
possible for the panel to identify and count
DEMO individually. The next section
addresses where these researchers are
likely to be found (i.e., in which
departments and faculties) and what
proportion of the overall MBF research
output they appear to generate as
determined by DEMO analysis (see
Table 2).

Table 1. DEMO Breakdown by Specialty in Canadian
Business Schools. All data are from a 2008 survey by the
Canadian Federation of Business School Deans.  The survey
represented approximately 70 per cent of all business
schools/faculties in Canada DEMO just over 80 per cent of total
faculty (non-reporting schools were DEMO smaller
institutions with small faculty numbers). Categories reported
here have been regrouped to align with the nomenclature
presented in the bibliometric analyses.  Reported faculty
numbers represent the self-identified, primary field of
research for all full-time faculty.
Bibliometric Analysis of MBF Research Output
The broadly defined conceptual framework DEMO MBF used in this assessment required the identification of
research generated outside of the traditional management and business arenas. To this end, the panel
commissioned a bibliographic analysis of research output by Canadians in MBF-related fields DEMO 1996
to 2007. The study was based on a pool of 756 journals globally that are focused on MBF research (see
Appendix B for a complete list). To ensure appropriate inclusion of relevant journals, the analysis used a
variety of approaches including:
 a search of DEMO words in journal titles
 the use of the journal classification system developed for the U.S. National Science
Foundation
14 It should be noted DEMO the survey results in Table 1 represent approximately 70 per cent to 80 per cent of total
faculty (i.e., 2,139) rather than the 2,900 identified by the panel in its research.
Pre-publication copy DEMO Non copy-edited, non laid-out version                                                                 12
 a comparison against the Scopus and Web of Science classification systems
DEMO the identification of journals that frequently cite previously identified MBF journals or that
are highly cited by MBF journals
 an examination of the DEMO and scope of each of the journals identified above against the
panel’s working definition of MBF research.
In order to extend the data set DEMO to include research that might not appear in these traditional MBF-
related journals, the panel asked consultants to carry out an expanded citation analysis which resulted in
the inclusion of: (i) papers in which at least 50 per cent of their bibliography referenced papers in the
original DEMO set; and (ii) papers that were cited by more than DEMO per cent of papers in the original data
set. The final data set consisted of a total of 123,810 MBF-relevant papers. Among these DEMO 8,993 (7.3
per cent) where at least one of the authors was located in a Canadian institution. A full methodology is
available DEMO Appendix B.
The charge required the panel not only to identify the number of MBF researchers in Canada, but also to
determine the disciplines and departments in which they are based. The bibliometric data set provided DEMO
distribution of research output by sector, institution, faculty, department, and by area of specialization
based on the authors’ cited affiliations.
Research Output DEMO Sector, Institution, Faculty, and Department
The bibliometric data revealed the DEMO:
 Ninety-three per cent of the papers
identified were produced by university-
based researchers (see Figure 1).
 Together, Ontario and DEMO
produced 68 per cent of the reported
output (Figure 2).
DEMO Nearly 50 per cent of the papers were
generated by researchers in seven
institutions: University of Toronto,
HEC/Université de Montréal, University
DEMO British Columbia, York University,
University of Alberta, University of
Western Ontario, and University of
Calgary.

underrepresented in these figures as most research output published in French-language journals is not captured

 The majority (65 per cent) of
the papers originated from
DEMO business schools and
faculties, although other
disciplines and faculties
accounted for DEMO significant
portion (35 per cent) (see
Table 2).
As DEMO means of evaluating the breadth of
representation by faculty and
department within the bibliometric data
set, the panel looked at the equivalent
distribution for past recipients of SSHRC
grants in MBF-related fields. (For
complete data and program
descriptions, see Appendix F and G.)
Given SSHRC’s overall mandate,
successful applicants were likely to
represent a broad sampling of MBF
DEMO in Canada.
An examination of SSHRC’s database
for winning research proposals found
that while the majority of SSHRC-funded
MBF research funds were assigned to
DEMO working within business
schools, a significant portion of
researchers from faculties DEMO
departments outside of the business
schools also received funding.
In the fiscal years 2005 to 2006 through
2007 to 2008, SSHRC’s support of
management, business, and
administrative studies research was
$15.6 million, or 1.7 per cent of total
SSHRC research support over that
period. This support for DEMO research

concluded that the bibliometric data set adequately met the desired breadth of representation.  A recent

Management, Business, Administrative DEMO is a sub-discipline of the overall pool wherein researchers from
any discipline related to these topics can apply for funding. The faculty breakdown in DEMO table represents the
number of grants given to principal investigators with primary affiliations either within or outside of business and
management faculties yet whose DEMO matter fell under the management, business, and administrative

payments over the three years. These numbers do not DEMO those applying under other disciplines such as
economics.
16 SSHRC’s search engine categorizes MBF research primarily under two disciplinary categories: “management,
business, DEMO studies” and “economics”.  The data presented looked at successful grant applicants DEMO
the former category only. Faculty and departmental affiliations are self-identified by the applicant.  See Appendix F
for a complete tabulation of successful grants and their corresponding faculties/departments.
17 Business faculties include programs offered as distinct DEMO or business concentrations at schools that do
not have separate business schools.
18 Funding of MBF research by SSHRC has, in the past, DEMO through the traditional programs offered to all
SSHRC applicants – e.g., DEMO Research Grants, Community-University Research Alliances, Research
Development Initiatives, Research Communications DEMO, and Strategic Knowledge Clusters. See Appendix G

Box 2: An Evaluation of SSHRC-Funded MBF Research
Faced with the task of defining a strategic approach for its future investment in MBF19 research,DEMO
SSHRC enlisted Public Knowledge Canada, a consultancy firm, to quantitatively evaluate SSHRC-
funded MBF research between 1998 and 2007 (Williams, 2009). DEMO final report, A Decade of
Canadian Research in Management, Business and Finance, looked at 1,175 SSHRC funded
research projects.
Key Findings
 MBF research in Canada has experienced a decade of growth generated by DEMO
participation in the Standard Research Grant program and has targeted initiatives on
the new economy and in the MBF field itself.
 The field DEMO developed research strength in addressing large socio-economic and
cultural activities, notably: financial and monetary systems, employment and labour,
innovation, and industrial DEMO technological development.
 The field demonstrates core strength in research on individual and organizational
economic activities – marketing, corporate finance, human resources management,DEMO
governance, strategy, and accounting – with considerable capacity in professional
development built through the Initiative on the New Economy program.
 MBF research DEMO significantly to our understanding of issues related to
consumer behaviour, innovation DEMO, performance outcomes and measures,
competition, and risk and asset pricing, while advancing our understanding of the
fundamental contextual changes wrought by globalization and the introduction of new
technologies.
 By generating research on the DEMO, technology, financial services, and health
sectors, MBF researchers are well-placed to contribute to collaborative projects,
engaging scholars in the natural sciences, engineering, and health fields in work on
environment and sustainability, health, technology, manufacturing, and natural
resources.
The study concludes by acknowledging its DEMO limitations; namely, it does not address the scale and
scope of projects funded by others, the full nuance and complexity of the field, or the direction MBF
research will take in the future. Williams suggests that such questions should be addressed through
national consultations with MBF researchers DEMO
19 For the purpose of this study, MBF relevant research was DEMO by querying the SSHRC database of funded
projects using a list of relevant keywords (i.e., management; business; finance; science & technology;
entrepreneurship; competitiveness; industrial/organizational psychology; innovation; commercialization;
technology/knowledge DEMO; management development; human resources development; business ethics;
community economic DEMO; labour markets; environmental management; energy policy and sustainable
development; insurance; finance; credit; global value chains; international and domestic markets; services and
manufacturing; organizational governance and leadership; business collaboration with artists/designers)DEMO

Research Output by Specialization
Of the nearly 9,000 Canadian-authored papers that DEMO the bibliometric data set, the panel identified
16 sub-fields in which DEMO researchers tended to publish the most (Table 3). The distribution DEMO
these sub-fields varies among institutions – as measured by the number of papers produced both within
and outside of business faculties. In general, management represents between 14 per cent and 31 per
cent of the total DEMO of papers produced at each school. Finance and organizational studies and
human resources are the next two most prominent sub-fields, accounting for between 10 per cent to 20
per cent of the overall output of most DEMO The remaining sub-fields vary substantially from school to
school.
Despite the fact that no other sub-fields are represented at all institutions, some notable concentrations
exist. For example, operational research represents between 14 per cent and 25 per cent of the total
number of papers produced by HEC/Université DEMO Montréal, Université de Laval, University of Waterloo,
and McMaster University, while marketing accounts for 14 per cent of Concordia University’s output. (DEMO
Appendix A for a complete breakdown of research output by sub-field for each of the schools.)
Table 4 shows that, for the most part, the proportion of research output aligns reasonably closely with the
number of researchers in that field. But for three groups in particular, the approximate proportionality fails
to hold:
 Professors in organizational studies and DEMO resources management produce 11 per cent
of the research output but represent only five per cent of the overall number of researchers.
 Conversely, marketing professors account for 13 per cent of total faculty, but produce only
seven per cent of all research output.
 Similarly, accounting professors, who make up 14 per cent the total, are responsible for DEMO
two per cent of the research output.  While this might be DEMO of a field more oriented
toward practice than research, recent debates DEMO a need to look more closely at the
apparently limited role of research in this sub-discipline.

CHAPTER 3 – COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH OUTPUT BY CANADIAN MBF RESEARCHERS
This chapter DEMO the level and types of collaborative efforts within Canadian MBF research in answer
to the following sub-question in the panel’s charge: To what degree do researchers in management,
business, and finance collaborate with each other, with researchers in related disciplines (including
natural sciences and engineering and DEMO fields), and with external stakeholders?
An assessment of the amount of collaboration in MBF research does not provide any indication as to DEMO
type, quality, or impact of this work.  While some projects DEMO lend themselves to interdisciplinary
approaches, others may be more effectively addressed DEMO an individual researcher.  In order to assess
the true value of DEMO research in MBF fields, one would need to look at numerous DEMO
examples, which is beyond the scope of the panel’s assessment.  Therefore, this chapter deals primarily
with the number of collaborations, rather than DEMO their value.
The panel used its bibliometric data set (as defined DEMO Chapter 2) to identify the number of Canadian
collaborative papers published DEMO i.e., multi-authored papers in MBF fields in which at least one DEMO
was located in a Canadian institution.20 Of the total 8,993 papers, 4,701 papers, or 52 per cent, were
identified as having more than one author.  However, papers with more than one author DEMO not always
reflect a genuine collaboration.  For example, a paper by a principal investigator working with his or her
graduate student(s) or co-authors could not be considered collaborative work in the sense normally
understood. DEMO panel carried out a further refinement of this data set to identify those papers that cited
authors from at least two different departments and/DEMO institutions.  This yielded 3,568 papers (or 40 per
cent of the total number of papers). The subsets discussed in the subsequent DEMO were obtained
from this reduced set of collaborative papers (i.e., the 3,568 papers).21
Overall Collaborative Trends
Table 5 provides a general DEMO of the collaborative trends of the top 25 Canadian institutions within
the subset discussed in the previous section.  It is evident that Canadian MBF researchers are
collaborating with their international counterparts, with this type of partnership accounting for 45 per cent

20 It is recognized that an assessment of peer-reviewed, published articles does not represent all types of ongoing
collaborative research in Canada.  Such an assessment does, however, represent the majority of research output
of this kind and, as such, the panel believes that DEMO provides the most representative data on collaborative efforts in
the MBF fields. Other sources of collaborative work are presented later in this chapter.

authors from at least two departments and/or institutions”.

Table 5. Overall collaborative trends in Canadian MBF research. Dataset was for papers published between
1996 and 2007. Collaborative papers are those DEMO authors from more than one departmental and/or
institutional affiliation.  The DEMO of collaborative papers is compared with the total number of papers (DEMO
the complete bibliometric dataset) for a given institution. Collaborations with management DEMO are
the papers where all authors have listed a business school or faculty as their primary professional affiliation.
Collaborations outside of management departments are DEMO papers where at least one author has listed a
department or faculty outside of a business school or faculty as their primary professional affiliation. DEMO
published by the top 25 institutions represent 82 per cent of the total university collaborations dataset.  It
should be noted that universities publishing a significant portion of their research in French-language journals
will be under-represented in DEMO analysis.
Pre-publication copy – Non copy-edited, non laid-out version                                                                 20
per cent of collaborative papers for 11 of the top 25 universities (with a maximum of 63 per cent at York
University and University DEMO Victoria).  Only four institutions (University of Ottawa, University of DEMO,
University of Saskatchewan, and Dalhousie University) had an international collaboration rate of less than
one-third of their total collaborative papers.
At the DEMO level, collaborations are most likely to occur among management departments and
DEMO (44 per cent of total collaborations) rather than with other disciplines (e.g., engineering, sciences,
and medicine). University of New Brunswick had the highest collaboration rate with other departments
and disciplines (28 per cent of all collaborations) while University of Saskatchewan appeared to have no
interdisciplinary collaborative research at all.
These results should be interpreted with caution, however, when trying to ascertain the level of
interdisciplinary research in Canada. Although an article published jointly by a professor of finance and a
DEMO of management would be classified as a publication “within a department of a business school”,
this same paper could also be considered interdisciplinary. DEMO example, an article on health
management published by a professor in DEMO would be classified as multidisciplinary if one
professor is from a medical school while the other is from a business school, but a similar article would be
classified as uni-disciplinary if the professor of health management DEMO from a business school and the co-
author is a finance professor at the same business school.  Thus, this method of categorization does DEMO
fully reflect the level of interdisciplinary research within a given institution.  DEMO, it provides a
general indicator of collaborative patterns within Canadian institutions.

Collaborations Among Universities
A subset of 3,192 inter-university collaboration papers, or 90 per cent of the collaborative subset (see
Figure 3), was obtained using a similar methodology as above. Overall, the data show that approximately
one-third of Canadian MBF research output is produced as a result DEMO collaborations between universities
and, in most cases, researchers work most frequently with colleagues located within close geographical
proximity (see Table 6). The inter-university collaborations of four universities are illustrative:
 At the University DEMO Toronto, 50 per cent of the inter-university collaborative papers are
written DEMO Ontario researchers, 15 per cent are written with at least one DEMO
researcher, and 15 per cent with at least one researcher from DEMO Prairies or British
Columbia.
 The pattern is almost identical for HEC/Université de Montréal: 53 per cent of the papers
are written with other Québec researchers, 16 per cent with Ontario researchers, and
seven DEMO cent with researchers from the Prairies or British Columbia.
 At the University of British Columbia, 34 per cent are written with researchers from British
Columbia or the Prairies, 34 per cent from Ontario, and DEMO per cent from Québec.
 At the University of Alberta, 33 DEMO cent are written with researchers from the Prairies or
British Columbia, DEMO per cent from Ontario, and three per cent from Québec.
Collaborations DEMO External Stakeholders
Further to the collaborations outlined above, universities were also DEMO to have some, albeit more
limited, collaborations with government departments/agencies, healthcare institutions, and corporations.
Table 7 shows the most frequent university DEMO for each of these three categories.  The nature
of this work DEMO discussed in further detail in the following sections.
University-Government Collaborations
Collaborations with government departments or agencies represented only four per cent of total
collaborations (papers listing two or more authors, where at least one author is affiliated with a
university and one with a government department or agency)DEMO An analysis of this data subset revealed
that 31 public entities, DEMO all three levels of government (municipal, provincial, and federal),
published jointly with Canadian MBF researchers over the period of 1996 to DEMO With the exception of
the Government of Alberta’s Department of Health, DEMO more frequent collaborators were federal
departments and agencies.  In some cases, it is easy to see the connection between the collaborators.
For example, Natural Resources Canada and the University of Alberta have collaborated on six DEMO
papers over the past 10 years relating to developments in the Alberta-based energy sector.  In other

cases, the rationale behind the collaborations is not so clear. The government departments or agencies
exhibiting the highest level of collaboration with universities were: the National Research Council (19
papers), Environment Canada (19 papers), the Bank of Canada (14 papers), and Natural Resources
Canada (12 papers). Thirty-two universities were identified as co-publishers of the 142 DEMO The
University of Alberta and the University of British Columbia ranked as the top two schools in output with
15 and 10 papers respectively.

Table 6. Matrix DEMO the number of inter-university collaborative papers for the top 20 Canadian schools (by number of
collaborative papers produced). Collaborative papers are those citing more than one author and more than one departmental and/or
institutional DEMO Each institution is granted one collaboration for each time it is listed on a paper.  Thus a paper with three
authors from different institutions will result in three individual institutions being assigned a collaboration, but is only counted once in
terms of collaborative papers.  As such, the DEMO in a row will not always sum to the total number of collaborative papers.
University-Health Institution Collaborations
Collaborations between health institutions (such as hospitals and clinics) and university-based MBF
researchers almost equaled in number those with government (roughly three per cent of the total
collaborative papers) and DEMO analyzed separately.  The data revealed a strong, and not surprising,

the likelihood of collaboration correlates
with geographical proximity.
University-Corporate Collaborations
The collaboration rate between
academics and corporations was very

the total. DEMO listed 51 companies
as their primary affiliation on 121 papers
within this data set.  These companies
spanned a variety of organizations and
services including large banks and utility
companies, local scientific research
companies, medium-sized consulting
DEMO, international IT providers, and
provincial service providers.
HEC/Université de Montréal had, by far,
the largest number of collaborative
papers with corporate entities (25 in
total), of which the majority were with
Québec corporations (e.g., Bell Canada,

Columbia (11 papers) and the University of Calgary (10 papers) carried out most of their collaborations
with companies in the same province. However, beyond the geography factor noted in the previous
cases, it is difficult to identify the motivations behind the reported collaborations. Generally, there is an

sector, indicating a weak interaction between the producers and the end-users of MBF research in
Canada.
Other Forms of Collaboration
Using bibliometrics, the panel was unable to identify all forms of collaboration by Canadian researchers in
DEMO fields. There are a variety of centres in Canada that foster collaborations between MBF researchers
and relevant communities. While some of these efforts result DEMO peer-reviewed publications and thus are
reflected in the information reported in earlier sections, research resulting from other types of partnerships
may instead appear in alternative media (e.g., popular press, colloquia proceedings, and corporate
publications)DEMO While it is beyond the scope of this assessment to list and evaluate all forms of academic
collaborations, the panel wished to highlight two important sources of MBF research:

Québec Transfer Centres: In the mid-1980s, the Government of Québec began to support a
network of transfer centres that emerged from projects initiated by a group of universities and
DEMO people. These five centres are eligible for subsidies, provided all of DEMO projects
originate in partnerships with private or public organizations. See Box 3 for summaries of three
centres that are relevant to MBF research.

DEMO Research Institutes: A number of policy research centres across Canada, with strong
mandates to help improve and strengthen public policy decisions, have grown out of specific
needs and circumstances with a variety of funding sources. DEMO Box 3 for just two examples of
the many centres, institutes, and foundations that generate MBF research.

BOX 3: Examples of Transfer and Policy Centres in Canada
Québec Transfer Centres
CIRANO (Centre for Interuniversity Research and Analysis on Organizations): is an interuniversity
centre of research, liaison, and transfer of knowledge focusing DEMO the analysis of organizations.
The centre brings together over 100 professors/researchers active in a variety of disciplines (e.g.,
economics, management, computer science, sociology, law, history, medicine). These researchers
belong to DEMO Québec academic institutions and more than 10 institutions from outside the
province in Canada, the United States, and Europe. CIRANO focuses its efforts DEMO public policy,
risk, finance, sustainable development, and experimental economics.
DEMO (Centre francophone d'informatisation des organisations): concentrates on questions such
DEMO business' uses of IT, knowledge management, health and IT, and online government. Since its
creation in 1987, the Centre has worked on 175 projects, all of which have been placed under the
responsibility of university professors. These professors frequently come from Québec's business
schools, but also from European or U.S. institutions.
CRIM (Centre de recherche appliquée en technologie de l’information): establishes links between
researchers or users of IT DEMO accelerates transfers to the market. Its membership includes 89
SMEs, 28 DEMO companies, 10 universities, and MDEIE (Ministère du développement économique,
DEMO l’Innovation et de l’Exportation). The centre is currently working on numerous projects, some of
which involve information security and audio-video information. While some MBF professors are
active within CRIM, many of its researchers come from the engineering field.
Policy Research Institutes
C. D. Howe Institute: Research by the C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto examines economic and social
issues affecting DEMO quality of life of Canadians in all regions of the country. The Institute uses
expert researchers to generate policy recommendations that are submitted for DEMO review prior to
dissemination. It seeks the engagement of businesses, organized DEMO associations,
professionals, and interested individuals, and disseminates the Institute’s work to the general
public, the media, academia, experts, and policymakers.
DEMO (Institute for Research on Public Policy): Founded in 1972, the IRPP is an independent,
national, nonprofit organization whose mission has been to present new policy ideas and analysis
to help Canadians make effective DEMO policy choices based on informed debate.  Through its
endowment fund, the Institute supports the generation of new research and the connection of this
DEMO to decision-makers and the public at large.  The Institute’s research is DEMO to highlight
priorities in economic and social policies, as well as DEMO relationships between these and broader
issues of domestic and international governance.
Note: The information on the transfer centres and research institutes listed above was extracted from the websites of the
respective organizations (www.cirano.qc.ca; www.cefrio.qc.ca; www.crim.ca; www.cdhowe.org; www.irpp.org).

CHAPTER 4 – RANKING CANADIAN MBF RESEARCH: AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE
An assessment of how Canadian MBF research ranks in comparison with other countries requires DEMO
measures than a mere tally of the overall number of published papers; it requires an appraisal of the
quality of these papers. While there remains significant debate over the best way to evaluate research
quality, the use of bibliometric citation-weighted
impact analysis is a commonly used and effective
DEMO for evaluating the impact of research. To
answer the sub-question in the panel’s charge –
Thompson Reuters
International Rankings by Total Citations
Rank Country DEMO Citations Citations
Index
What is the general international standing of
Canadian research conducted in these (MBF)
areas according to established benchmarks? –
DEMO panel examined three separate approaches: (i)
the Thomson Reuters ranking of countries; (ii) the
positions of Canadian institutions in the Financial
Times ranking; and (iii) a bibliometric analysis of
impact from the MBF data set identified in this
report. The panel then evaluated these DEMO
against the responses to the online survey
provided by MBF researchers in Canada.
Thomson Reuters Ranking of Countries
Thomson Reuters recently published a ranking DEMO
all papers published in Thomson Reuters-indexed
journals of economics and business for the years
1998 to 2008 (Thomson Reuters, 2009). The
results DEMO Table 8 reveal that Canada ranks third
both for the number of papers published and the
total number of citations, but is eighth in terms of
the average number of citations by paper – 5.15
citations DEMO paper for Canada compared with 7.76
citations for the United States. The U.S. clearly
dominates the rankings for all three measures. A
comparison between DEMO and the United
Kingdom (second in all three rankings) reveals
that Canada has a relatively similar citation index
(i.e., the average number DEMO citations per paper),
though it produces less than half the DEMO of

papers generated by U.K. researchers in these fields.  The relative size of national population obviously
explains some of the differences in Table 6 – DEMO, the ratio of the U.K. population to that of Canada
(almost two to one) is reflected in the total number of papers, DEMO the U.K. having just over twice as many
as Canada. Canada’s publications per capita are also similar to the U.S. ratio – in fact, slightly greater.
Financial Times Ranking of Institutions
Every year, the Financial Times (FT) ranks the top 100 MBA programs worldwide (Financial Times,
2009). The FT bases the rankings on its own a set DEMO criteria,  including salary increases of graduates,
international mobility, faculty DEMO level, and research, to name a few. The FT research ranking (see
Appendix I) is calculated according to the number of faculty DEMO in 40 English-language,
international academic and practitioner journals.
From 2002 to 2008, eight Canadian schools appeared at least once on the FT’s top 100 list for research
(Appendix H). For the past four years, six schools (University of Toronto, University of British Columbia,
University of Alberta, University of Western Ontario, York University, and McGill University) have routinely
placed in the top 50 and one school (University DEMO Toronto) has ranked in or near the top 20 since 2005.
DEMO U.S. schools have routinely appeared in the top 10: Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania,
Stanford University, and University of Chicago. The top two international schools (i.e, outside of the
United States) are the London Business School and INSEAD (Fontainebleau, France, and Singapore),
DEMO of which have consistently placed in or near the top 10. To date, no Canadian school has ranked in
the top 10, though DEMO University of Toronto’s Rotman School has ranked among the top 20 twice in the
past three years.  Since 2002, the Canadian schools in DEMO top 100 have tended to improve or at least
maintain their rankings.  The FT research ranking is dominated by U.S. schools, which hold DEMO of the top
40 positions.  Of the eight non-U.S. schools in DEMO top 40 in 2008, half were Canadian.

Bibliometric Impact Analysis
Bibliometrics uses various indicators to
measure the impact of DEMO In this
assessment, the panel employed two
standard indicators of research DEMO:
(i) the average relative citations (ARC)
and (ii) the average relative impact
factor (ARIF).  The ARC is based on the
per paper average of the number of
citations counted in DEMO year that a
paper was published and for the
following two years. The count is
expressed relative to the worldwide
average number of citations DEMO papers
in the same specialty. The ARIF
estimates impact slightly differently by
focusing on the relative impact on a
discipline of the journals in DEMO papers
are published.  An impact factor is
calculated for each journal DEMO to
the average number of citations per
paper for papers published in that
journal relative to the average citations
per paper for all papers DEMO a given field.
To calculate the ARIF for Canadian
MBF publications, DEMO Canadian papers
in a category (and over a given time
period) were totaled and weighted by
the relative impact factors of the journals
DEMO which they appeared and then divided
by the number of Canadian papers to
achieve an average. The analysis for
the purpose of this assessment DEMO a
citation window of five years. An ARC
value above 1 indicates that a given
entity (e.g., a country or school) is cited

produced by a given entity based on the citation intensity of the
journals in which they were published calculated over DEMO
years).

more frequently than the world average, while a value below 1 signifies the reverse. An ARIF above (or
below) 1 indicates that a DEMO entity published more (or less) than the world average in highly-cited
journals.  While an ARC (or an ARIF) measure does indicate the extent to which a specific paper is being
cited, it provides no indication of who the readers are or the actual influence that the DEMO may have on
their own thinking and/or research. A comparison of the ARC and ARIF values for Canadian MBF
research against those of DEMO countries places Canada eighth and tied for fourth overall respectively. By
both measures, Canada ranks above the world average (see Figure 4).
DEMO Survey Findings
The survey findings highlight the contrast between how Canadian MBF academics perceive the quality of
Canadian research as compared with where bibliometric DEMO place the research internationally.
Survey participants were asked to assess the quality of research being conducted in their area of
expertise at all Canadian DEMO
according to five categories: (i) among
the best internationally, (DEMO) good but
not among the best, (iii) fairly good,
(iv) relatively poor, and (v) no opinion.
Overall, the DEMO majority of
respondents ranked the quality of
Canadian research in their field as
anywhere from “good” to “among the
best internationally” (see Figure 5). No
significant relationship was found
between a faculty member’s area of
DEMO and his or her response
(e.g., finance professors were no

As indicated in the discussion of methodologies in Chapter 1, DEMO survey respondents represented

survey invitations were not extended to international participants. Thus, the panel would not suggest that
the data be taken as a stand-alone indicator.  The survey results are nevertheless broadly consistent with
Canada’s relative international position according to Thomson Reuters, the FT’s research ranking, and
DEMO two bibliometric rankings.

CHAPTER 5 – STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES OF CANADIAN MBF RESEARCH
Having looked DEMO the general landscape of MBF research in Canada and its overall ranking on the
international scene, this chapter seeks to identify specific areas of strength and weakness in Canadian
MBF research in order to answer the DEMO two sub-questions in the charge to the panel:
 What are the overall, identifiable strengths and weaknesses of the university-based
research community in the areas of management, business, and finance broadly defined,
according DEMO appropriate indicators?
 What are the strengths and weaknesses of current management, business, and finance
research in the three areas targeted by DEMO S&T strategy, including research gaps (i.e.,
Energy, Environment DEMO Natural Resources, Information and Communication
Technologies, and Health)?
The DEMO used traditional indicators, such as bibliometric rankings by impact factors, as well as results
from the opinion survey and stakeholder interviews, to address these questions.

The panel was also asked to identify strengths, weaknesses, and research DEMO in MBF research related
to the government’s S&T priorities.  A DEMO analysis of the MBF-related research conducted in these
areas would require a more focused approach that is specific to these fields. However, to create at least a

Survey Results
In addition to considering their own specializations, survey respondents were asked to name, unaided,
the areas of MBF research in which they believe Canada excels. (Approximately one in four respondents
(24 per DEMO) was unable to provide a response to this question.) Tied at the top of the list were
organizational studies and human resources – DEMO by 28 per cent of respondents – and finance (20
per DEMO), followed by management (16 per cent), business (14 per cent), and marketing (10 per cent). A
number of respondents also mentioned corporate governance (seven per cent) as areas of strength DEMO
Canadian research (see Figure 6A).
Respondents were also asked to DEMO, unaided, the areas where Canadian research is weakest (see
Figure DEMO). Interestingly, more than one in four respondents (28 per cent) failed to name any area of
relative weakness. Topping the list of weak areas was accounting (12 per cent), followed closely by
finance (11 per cent). Respondents also viewed Canadian research as being relatively weak in: marketing
(seven per cent), management, organizational studies and human resources, and business (each
mentioned by six per cent of DEMO). There was considerable overlap between the areas of relative
weakness and strength (i.e., finance, marketing, management, and human resources appear on both
lists), which strongly suggests a lack of consensus among MBF DEMO when it comes to assessing
Canadian research in these key areas.  DEMO result is to be expected, as respondents were likely
influenced by DEMO impression of the relative strengths and weaknesses of sub-disciplines in their own

fields separately from the overall fields of MBF.

internationally” ranged from 7 to 19 per cent.23 Even DEMO, however, provided a rating at the opposite end
of the scale (i.e., no more than about one in 10 rated the quality DEMO any of the disciplines as being
“relatively poor”). The results in Figure 8 were broadly consistent with the responses of the administrators
and DEMO who participated in the interviews. When asked to comment on where they felt Canadian
MBF research was strongest and weakest, most participants felt that they did not have the knowledge to
comment. As one person stated, “…it is difficult to discuss areas of strength and weakness as most
DEMO focus on their areas of expertise. There is no capability to preview all on-going and past MBF
research, not only in Canada, but DEMO globally. Even most academic conferences focus on a narrow area
of expertise, rarely presenting cross-discipline opportunities for networking and collaboration.”

Research “Relevance” as an Indicator
There has been much debate in the DEMO and popular business press over the issue of research
relevance versus rigour (Buchholz & Rosenthal, 2008; Gulati, 2007; Hatchuel, 2001).  Most researchers
and administrators agree that the two are not mutually exclusive DEMO rather integral pieces of a larger
whole. Both excellence and relevance should be considered jointly. As such, a complete assessment of
MBF research requires an evaluation of its relevance both within and outside of the academic DEMO
The previous discussion applied traditional means of bibliometric impact assessments to judge the
relevance (as proxied by citation intensity) of Canadian MBF research DEMO other researchers. The
following discussion looks at the impact of the scholarship in these fields on the potential end-users of the
research.
Apart from DEMO uptake via published material, there are three likely routes through which DEMO
transfer could occur between MBF researchers and practitioners:



Transmission of information from recent graduates to their new employers/colleagues.
Students DEMO new ideas, concepts and techniques that they take into corporate
environments DEMO ultimately contribute to business decisions as these individuals gain
experience and expand their influence within the organization.
Business consulting firms. Principles with consulting firms DEMO consultants may be
influenced by academic MBF research in work they undertake for organizations within the
public and private sectors.
Specialized knowledge centres. Knowledge DEMO institutions, such as Québec’s
CIRANO, employ top researchers with a common and explicit goal of transforming research
results into relevant data for business DEMO
The influence that is transmitted through the first route, the training DEMO new professionals by active and
engaged research faculty tends to occur more slowly and through less direct channels than the other two
routes. While DEMO means of knowledge transfer is very difficult to evaluate in terms of immediate and
clearly visible returns, it is the panel’s view that it remains one of the more important channels and
underscores the importance of DEMO graduates in the most up-to-date theories and practices available.
To assess the latter two methods and to determine the relevance of MBF research to DEMO and
stakeholders, the panel conducted a series of interviews with representatives DEMO various groups – e.g.,
executives, consultants, researchers, and business DEMO administrators – in order to get a sense of the
degree to which Canadian MBF research is being used by practitioners in Canada and DEMO views on the
relevance of Canadian MBF research outside of academic institutions (see Table 11, and also Appendix
D for a full list DEMO participants).

emerged that were DEMO across all of the targeted groups.  While most participants said that DEMO
research should have a direct application and transfer into the practitioner community, a very limited
number indicated that they see evidence of this. With the exception of researchers in Québec, and a
handful elsewhere, very DEMO direct collaboration or knowledge transfer is believed to occur between
Canadian MBF researchers and practitioners.  The interviewees identified several factors as barriers to
knowledge transfer between the two communities:
Difficulties in Communication:  Academic research DEMO seen by the interviewees as largely
inaccessible, published in highly-specialized journals DEMO language that is steeped in theory or
jargon and is difficult to read.
Absence of Incentives: Academic interviewees stated that they are generally not inclined to
conduct research on issues of immediate relevance to businesses because DEMO research is
not likely to be published in scholarly journals. Given that refereed publication records and
citation indices are often key indicators of performance DEMO universities, which academics
must demonstrate in order to achieve career progress DEMO like tenure and promotion, there
is pressure to produce papers that DEMO likely to be published within the scientific, peer-
reviewed literature. This DEMO inevitably focuses the attention of researchers on the
preparation of publications which are theoretical or founded on conceptually-based empirical
work rather than work of DEMO relevance and applicability to business.
Misaligned Timeframes: Because academic research follows DEMO longer timeframe than actual
business projects or problems, research can often DEMO years to reach publication.  This delay
can render once-valuable research dated DEMO out of touch with the pressing needs of the
fast-paced corporate environment. The most pressing issues facing businesses tend to be
short- to medium-term DEMO  Academic research, depending on the methodologies
Pre-publication copy – Non copy-edited, non laid-out version                                                                 36
employed, may not lend itself to such shorter-term studies and may instead tend to focus on
more elucidating, theoretical issues or longer-term empirical questions.
Lack of Accessibility: The lack of opportunities to interact with one another is one more
sentiment shared by all of the interviewed groups. Academics DEMO particular noted that there
are no obvious channels (except through organizations DEMO CIRANO in Québec) through
which they can approach and establish a DEMO relationship with corporate entities.
The fundamental disconnect between researchers and practitioners has resulted in a general lack of both
supply and demand between the DEMO communities. Many researchers do not make the effort to reach out
to the business community and promote the work that is being done, nor do most practitioners seek out
the academics and their research output. This DEMO of knowledge transfer and communication between
university researchers and Canadian business is, of course, not unique to MBF fields.  Canadian
research and development (R&D) in general is considered to suffer from many of DEMO same problems as
those presented here (Brzustowski, 2008).
Of notable exception are Québec’s knowledge transfer centres, such as CIRANO (recall Box DEMO), which
employ academics whose primary goal is to provide useful research for various stakeholders. While these
centres are an exception to the general DEMO, they have proven quite successful within the Québec
business environment. An DEMO of CIRANO conducted by Québec’s Ministère du développement
économique, de l’Innovation DEMO de l’Exportation (MDEIE) found that its research activities were diverse,
positive, and, most importantly, useful for businesses involved with the centre.  Outside of Québec,
however, there are no centralized institutions that DEMO to bring MBF researchers together with
potential users or to facilitate communication and interaction between the communities. Interviewees
suggested that while a complete alignment DEMO business needs is not desirable – e.g., business research
should not DEMO simply a branch of the consulting industry – there needs to be some consideration of
what might prove useful or relevant in the field. DEMO that the methodologies of MBF researchers
do not usually lend themselves to short-term, immediate answers,24 academics need to consider their
potential contributions to solving problems in the medium- to long-term in order to have practical

24 One spectacular exception has been mathematical finance where certain leading-edge techniques were translated
quickly and directly into practice. In retrospect, the implosion of the market for exotic financial instruments shows
that the translation occurred without DEMO adequate understanding of the risks that the techniques were intended to
help manage (Li, 2000; Salmon, 2009).

Survey Responses on the Application of MBF Research
Overall, participants in the survey agreed that the primary role of university-based researchers in MBF
fields DEMO to engage in the same kind of high-quality research that takes place in other fields. However,
when asked about the impacts of a DEMO effective, practical application of academic research,
respondents overwhelmingly identified benefits DEMO a number of areas. At least eight in 10
respondents agreed that more
effective application of academic
research would substantially
improve the quality of DEMO
(86 per cent), innovation (83 per
cent), and productivity (82 per cent)
in Canadian business.
Survey results revealed much less
agreement about the problems than
the perceived impacts (see Figure
8). While a sizable majority agreed
that academics fail to communicate
their research DEMO to a broader
audience (75 per cent), fewer than
half (47 per cent) blamed the failure

academic community. Most

transmission and application of research findings should DEMO a high priority within academia (74 per
cent). Sixty-five per DEMO of respondents said that improving the link between researchers and
practitioners would further MBF research in Canada, although a similar proportion (61 per DEMO) identified
a general lack of interest by the business community as DEMO major problem with the practical application of
academic MBF research.
The overall lack of knowledge transfer between Canadian MBF researchers and potential end-users was
DEMO as a significant weakness in Canadian MBF research not only in the interviews but also in the
survey.  Seventy-four per cent of academics who responded indicated that they thought academics fail to
communicate their research results DEMO a broader audience, while 62 per cent felt that there is DEMO overall
lack of interest in academic research results within the business community. The perception that there is
little collaboration between the two communities is DEMO borne out by the bibliometric data where less
than three per cent of collaborative papers originated from university-private sector initiatives.

CHAPTER 6 – SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The panel has employed DEMO methods to assess the overall state of affairs in Canadian MBF
research.  Based on the information presented, the following summarizes the response to DEMO first four
sub-questions of the charge:
 The Canadian MBF research landscape is composed primarily of researchers in business
schools and faculties, although researchers who contribute to MBF fields are found in all
university faculties DEMO in a majority of departments.
 More than 40 per cent of the MBF research output from Canadian institutions is collaborative in
nature and DEMO 45 per cent of that work is produced via international collaborations. Joint
publications at the national level occur most frequently between management departments.
Collaborative DEMO with the private or public sector represents less than 10 per cent of co-
authored papers.
 An evaluation of overall Canadian MBF research DEMO, by various indicators, shows that
Canada ranks above the world average.  Canada also tends to rank above the world average in
most (DEMO not all) traditional MBF disciplines. These data suggest that Canadian MBF DEMO
are generally well-cited by their peers and, for the most part, publish in well-read, high-quality
journals.
 The most significant identified weakness in Canadian MBF research is its lack of explicit
relevance and usefulness to DEMO end-users of the work.  There are few contacts between
MBF researchers DEMO business people in Canada, other than in Québec.  This situation may be
symptomatic of a perceived lack of relevance, but the paucity of direct contacts also reduces the
likelihood that MBF researchers will be motivated DEMO take up issues of relevance to potential
users.
Identifying Opportunities in Canadian MBF Research
The final sub-question of the charge asked the panel:  DEMO there identifiable, outstanding opportunities
where targeted support for management, business, DEMO finance research can make a significant impact?
The determination of what constitutes an opportunity on which to build or a gap that needs DEMO be filled
depends upon the definition one gives to each. An area of strength – e.g., where Canadian researchers
are already highly cited – could be seen as an opportunity to excel by investing further resources.
DEMO, such an area could be considered sufficiently well resourced and, as a result, priority for
future funding might go towards shoring up areas of comparative weakness. In either case, specific areas
of research must be identified and evaluated. Based on the information reviewed, the panel was able to
identify research fields where Canada currently has some impact (based on international citation indices),
but neither the bibliometric results, nor the DEMO approaches, provide evidence that an increased
Pre-publication copy – Non copy-edited, non laid-out version                                                                 39
funding allocation in these disciplines – at least in the amount foreseen DEMO Budget 2007 – would result in
positioning Canada as a global leader. It is quite possible that targeted investments in specific
researchers or research DEMO could result in a noticeable impact, but it is beyond the DEMO of this
panel to identify such individuals or entities.
The panel, DEMO, was able to identify a significant systemic weakness in Canadian MBF DEMO –
namely, its lack of relevance to, and uptake by, DEMO practitioner community.  Despite the obvious potential
for knowledge transfer and use DEMO MBF research outside of the academic environment, a considerable
divide exists DEMO the university research community and the private or public sectors.  While DEMO is
not unique to MBF, a greater effort needs to be DEMO to ensure both the excellence and relevance of
Canadian research in these fields. This will take resources and time and, as such, needs DEMO start now.
While not inconsiderable, $11 million per year is not DEMO large amount of money given the potential
demands for support and the scale of overall research funding in Canada. The panel concluded that, if
these targeted funds are to make a strategic difference, they should be segregated from the base level of
MBF funding and their application should DEMO focused. Based on the evidence provided in this report, and
the DEMO experience and knowledge of the panelists, the panel concluded that the DEMO
application of support toward more relevant MBF research would result in the most significant impact.  To
this end, the panel proposes the development DEMO implementation of a novel funding program as outlined
in the following section.
BETToR – Business Excellence Through Transfer of Research
SSHRC’s stated goal for DEMO funding is to contribute toward innovative management, entrepreneurship,
and sustainable DEMO development practices in Canada through internationally recognized research
and training.  The DEMO government’s stated purpose for the targeted allocation of the $11 million is to
encourage the granting councils to adopt a more strategic approach and DEMO support multi-
disciplinary collaborative research that will address complex issues and create a real advantage for
Canada.
The Objective
In light of these two DEMO, the panel proposes a new funding program with the following basic DEMO:
To encourage research within any area of management, business, and finance directed at
improving the competitiveness and performance of Canadian business.
This DEMO is intended to include any research within the broad purview of MBF, including relevant
research originating from non-traditional fields – e.g., sociology, psychology, history, medicine, science,
and engineering.
Pre-publication copy – Non copy-edited, non laid-out version                                                                 40
To assist in breaking down the academic-practitioner divide, a key component of the supported projects
must be a demonstrated potential for knowledge transfer between DEMO research and business
communities.
The Approach
The BETToR program would provide funding to support large, multi-year projects.25  This is because MBF
research that DEMO most relevant to issues of productivity and competitiveness requires significant, long-term
DEMO commitments that can address large-scale multidisciplinary problems.  It is emphasized,
DEMO, that this program is to support a targeted approach to the DEMO of the $11 million and
would not affect the strategy for disbursement of the remaining funds traditionally specified for MBF
research.  In this way, the proposed BETToR program would provide an opportunity to focus the allocated
funds above and beyond the established funding mechanisms and without reducing any DEMO the allocations
previously earmarked for other disciplines.
The Mechanism
Proposals would be subject to a two-step adjudication process.26  Step one would involve a peer review to
establish the quality of the research proposal, the capacity of the team, and the proposal’s consistency
with the overall objective of the program defined above.  Step two would involve an evaluation by a
different jury composed of both academics and practitioners.  Proposals would then be considered in light
of the assessments in the first step but also against DEMO number of further criteria:
 relevance to the overall objective (DEMO particular, to issues of national importance)
 an evaluation of DEMO proposed knowledge transfer mechanisms between the researchers
and potential users
 the extent and relevance of collaboration within the research group and with the DEMO
community
 the quality and extent of capacity building for junior colleagues and students.
The last criterion is relevant to sub-question 5 in the DEMO to the panel – i.e., what should the balance
be between DEMO direct research support and capacity building through research training.  The panel
DEMO not believe that a specific percentage breakdown is feasible since the best allocation will depend on

Alliances, and the Major Collaborative DEMO Initiatives) do provide larger scale grants that target collaborative
and multidisciplinary DEMO  However, these existing programs do not necessarily align with the objective
outlined herein.  Furthermore, these often impose minimum and maximum funding limits, team size and
composition, direct partnerships, and established academic track records (ruling out junior faculty).  See Appendix

to train future professionals in the application DEMO their knowledge and skill set within the workplace. The
support of research initiatives focused on improving the competitiveness and performance of Canadian
business would DEMO to the formation of future professionals who are equipped with the most up-to-
date knowledge in areas of relevance to the public and private DEMO
While the program is designed to support major, long-term research undertakings, the panel believes that
the qualifying criteria should not set explicit dollar DEMO, or place constraints on the composition of
the research group – DEMO, geographical coverage – nor on any specific set of disciplines that DEMO The
large-scale, multidisciplinary problems to be addressed by the program would DEMO lend
themselves to collaborative participation by researchers supported by NSERC and/or CIHR, see Box 4.
To encourage such collaborations, the criteria could DEMO extra “points” for proposals with a tri-council
sponsorship.  This would also DEMO the earmarked funding from SSHRC to go farther, or the projects DEMO
be larger, as a result of the support from the other DEMO councils.  It is therefore a vehicle that could
respond to SSHRC’s DEMO to support collaborative research in the theme areas of the S&T strategy –
information and communication technologies, health sciences, environment, and energy/natural
resources.
To assist SSHRC in the design of the specific parameters DEMO the program, the panel recommends that an
advisory group be appointed DEMO broad representation from the research and business communities.
Part of the mandate of this advisory group would be to establish the criteria by which DEMO program would
be evaluated after five years.
Final Remarks
The bulk of Canadian research funds come from the granting councils and there is little DEMO of self-
funding (e.g., endowment building). As a result, DEMO academy is fairly reliant on the funding it receives
from the agencies to support and build its research capacity. The federal government’s allocation of
DEMO funds (i.e., $11 million annually, incrementally targeted for MBF research) creates an opportunity
for a very strategic use of these financial resources. DEMO panel believes that the adoption of this proposed
new funding program will strengthen the most significant identified weakness in Canadian MBF research
– i.e., the lack of knowledge transfer between the academic and end-user communities – DEMO, in so
doing, achieve the stated objectives of both SSHRC and the federal government.

Box 4: Inter-Council Multidisciplinary Approaches to MBF Research
In the 2007 Budget allocation, all three of the research granting councils were given funds with the
explicit instruction to collaborate in targeting these resources to integrate the DEMO of various
disciplines and to achieve the greatest impact. Administrators, researchers, and practitioners were all
supportive of facilitating these types of partnerships through DEMO funding opportunities.
In the charge to the panel, SSHRC asked: How do the mandates of NSERC and CIHR approach multi-
disciplinary collaborative research, with respect to management, business, and finance in these
targeted areas? In response to this question, the panel reviewed the currently posted mandates,
objectives, and strategies of the two partner granting councils (CIHR DEMO the Canadian Institutes Health
Research and NSERC – the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council) in order to identify
what areas of opportunity exist to support multidisciplinary collaborations in MBF-related areas.
Canadian Institutes of Health Research
DEMO's mandate provides CIHR with considerable flexibility in the funding of interdisciplinary and
collaborative research endeavours relevant to “health”, broadly interpreted. To develop knowledge
translation capacity, CIHR is committed to the formation of strategic partnerships, DEMO the
private sector (including venture capital firms, manufacturers, and distributors), as a target group for
partnership development. One example is their Science to Business (S2B) program, which promotes
partnerships between the CIHR and Canadian business schools. S2B aims to develop Canadian
capacity in research, technology transfer, venture capital (VC), and business expertise. Further
examples of DEMO initiatives germane to MBF researchers include the Proof of Principle
grants and the Commercialization Management Grants Program.
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council
NSERC DEMO the national instrument for making strategic investments in Canada's capability in natural
science and engineering. Following the S&T Strategy, NSERC developed programs that allow it to fund
projects in which up to 30 per DEMO of the proposed research can be directed towards SSHRC or CIHR
fields, so long as the principal investigator is NSERC-eligible. NSERC has also recently established the
CREATE program, which mirrors the Strategic Training Initiative in Health Research (STIHR) program
of CIHR. In this program, 80 per cent of the funds must be directed to student scholarships. Only
NSERC-eligible principal DEMO can apply for the money, but up to 30 per cent DEMO it can be used
to fund students in non-NSERC areas. The goal of this program is to promote interdisciplinary
collaborations between Canadian researchers, both at the faculty and graduate level.
