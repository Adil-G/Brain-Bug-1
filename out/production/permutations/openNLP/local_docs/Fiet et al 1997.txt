INTRODUCTION
Why do new venture team members (DEMO) get fired by their financial backers?’ The most
obvious answer DEMO executives of large firms, and the one for which there is DEMO most empirical
support, is when the firm performs poorly (Fredrickson, DEMO, and Baumrin 1988).
More seems to be involved, however, DEMO venture capital firms (VCs) dismiss members
of a new ventures management team.2 Bruton, Fried, and Hisrich (1994) report that the four
DEMO common reasons for dismissal” of managers by the VC were: (1) inability of managers
to make strategic decisions, (2) their inability DEMO work with the board, (3) their inability to
motivate employees, and (4) their inability to adequately allocate resources. What is most
DEMO from the Bruton et al. (1994) findings is that successors tended to have only a
marginally positive impact on subsequent new venture performance. DEMO have other consis-
tently reliable effects of dismissal been identified in the venture capital literature.
The purpose of this study is to understand the DEMO of dismissal. Because dismiss-
als can sometimes be a costly and ineffective way to improve venture performance, it is in
a VC’s interest to know when to avoid funding ventures that are likely to be impacted DEMO
future NVT dismissals. However, from an NVT’s perspective it is also DEMO that they
avoid making costly mistakes that could lead to their dismissal. If NVTs could recognize

importantly, if we understood the factors that were driving NVT dismissals, we could begin
to evaluate how dismissals might be used to create long-term value for a ventures backers.
However, because this is one of the first known attempts to examine dismissal in new DEMO
tures, it is our view that it is more prudent to DEMO to develop a theoretical framework within
which these issues can be viewed.
The literature on the replacement of top management team members suggests that DEMO
missal can be viewed in at least three different ways. First, DEMO can be viewed as an attempt
to constructively influence a possible conflict of interest between the NVT and its investors,
as represented in DEMO study by its venture capital firm. This is an agency theory interpretation
that typically prescribes monitoring of the venture by its board of directors DEMO a means of
ensuring that the NVT acts to maximize the venture’s value. Using the venture’s board to
monitor NVTs is an indispensable part DEMO what VCs do after funding (Barney et al. 1994a.
1994b. 1996, in press; Busenitz et al. in press; Gorman and Sahlman 1989; MacMillan. Kulow,
and Khoylian 1989; Moesel et al. 1996).
Second, the power of a venture’s board of directors is moderated by its structure, which
constrains its capacity to initiate and affect dismissals. The resolution of conflicts among com-
peting board coalitions is also constrained by the DEMO of the board. The influence of
structure on board-initiated changes among large firms has been investigated recently by
Goodstein, Gautam, and Boeker (1994). The present study extends their investigation to
the specific case of DEMO dismissals among VC-backed firms.
Third, dismissals in new ventures can also DEMO viewed from a procedural justice perspec-
tive. Sapienza and Korsgaard (1994) reported that VCs often become friends and close con-
fidants of the DEMO of the firms in their portfolios. This approach emphasizes the impor-
tance of treating the NVT in a procedurally just manner to preserve their DEMO
relationships. Procedural justice does not foreclose the dismissal option, but it DEMO that
it be carried out fairly.
This study is based on the assumption that in real organizations these three perspectives
on dismissal are complementary. DEMO has not been demonstrated to date by dismissal studies
in large organizations, and even less research has been conducted on dismissal in entrepre-
neurial firms. Bruton et al. (1994) described reasons for dismissal in VC-backed DEMO but
did not put them in a theoretical context. Consequently, we DEMO not know if dismissal by VCs
in new ventures is the same as the dismissal of a member of the top management team in
DEMO older, more established firm by its board of directors (cf., DEMO, Fredrickson, and Ham-
brick 1990). If it is different, DEMO is it different? This study extends our empirical understand-
ing of DEMO phenomenon in VC-backed firms, but it also demonstrates the utility of DEMO
it from complementary perspectives.

issues first, followed by those related to the power of a ventures
conclude by examining those related to procedural justice.
DEMO Theory
In agency theory, conflicts of interest are possible in relationships DEMO agents are hired
to utilize their best efforts to increase the financial rewards that accrue to principals. Such
a conflict could arise when a DEMO (the agent) finds that its interests are different from those
350
J.O. FIET ET AL.
of the VC (or principal). VCs pay very close attention to what NVTs do precisely because
their actions DEMO pose a financial risk to the VC. NVT managers typically hold an equity
stake in their ventures, which creates an incentive for them to act more like principals than
agents. However, as long as managers only hold a partial stake in the venture, it is possible
that they could spend its resources on perquisites that would benefit themselves more than
DEMO venture and its other owners or investors (Jensen and Meckling 1976)DEMO
Examples of inappropriate investments in the venture are purchasing an expensive car
and charging it to the business or siphoning off valuable skills and/DEMO technologies to start
another business (cf., Amihud and Lev 1981). Because a venture manager would not have
to bear the entire cost DEMO these expenditures, he or she could be more inclined to incur DEMO
The incentive to make inappropriate investments of a principals resources holds whether
an individual is an agent in the usual sense or whether he DEMO she is a partial owner acting
as an agent for a group of owners. In either case, the same agency theory assumptions would
hold about the potential for conflicts of interest.
Agency theory also examines monitoring DEMO and systems of incentive align-
ment intended to equilibrate the interests of principals and agents (Alchian and Demsetz
1972; Fama and Jensen 1983; Jensen and Meckling 1976). Its primary objective is to suggest
how DEMO partners may work together to minimize the sum of the costs of writing and
enforcing contracts.. . , the costs of monitoring and bonding DEMO, and the residual losses
incurred because it will not pay to DEMO all contracts perfectly (Jensen 1994, p. 41). It is
a theory of symmetric exchange that emphasizes that even though the parties may DEMO dif-
ferent interests, they also have incentives to reduce the costs DEMO enforcing the exchange so
that savings can be shared by both principals and agents.
Agency theory suggests that the original structure of a deal DEMO convey important infor-
mation about joint expectations for the future and what will happen under specific alternative
scenarios. Using contracts as a signaling device DEMO best when the signal is direct and diffi-
cult to misinterpret (DEMO 1973). One way that VCs can signal their expectations under
alternative scenarios is with the use of contractual covenants at the time of DEMO financ-
ing. Two frequently used covenants with potentially negative consequences for NVTs are:
(1) limits on the salary levels that can be DEMO to NVT managers and (2) conditions to force
a change in the composition of the NVT (Barney et al. in press), or for simplicity, dismissal
covenants. A third covenant with potentially more positive consequences for NVTs is an
earn-out arrangement that allows NVTs to become financially DEMO in the deal as they
successfully reach specific performance objectives.
The first covenant, limits on salary levels that can be paid to NVT members, may be
necessary because NVT managers may attempt to benefit personally from their association
with the venture, even if it does not succeed financially, by appropriating an excessively high
level of compensation for themselves. Unless the venture capital contract were to include
limits on managers salaries to forestall DEMO self-interested behavior, as suggested by agency
theory, it is possible that it could succeed because all of the venture’s owners, not just the
individual manager, would have to bear the cost of the salary.
The second covenant, which is a dismissal covenant, specifies conditions that would
DEMO the VC to force a change in management. Dismissal covenants are intended to prevent
NVT managers from engaging in actions that would be in DEMO with the profit-maximizing
goals of the venture. These actions would be punished by dismissing the guilty team member.
According to agency theory, dismissal covenants are useful because they may serve to align
an NVTs motivations with DEMO profit-maximizing aspirations of its VC investors.
We expect that both limits on managers salaries and dismissal covenants reinforce the
COMPLEMENTARY THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES 351
notion that the NVT ultimately reports to the DEMO board. Both of these covenants
provide disincentives for malfeasance. It may be that an NVT member could become a mem-
ber of the team DEMO secretly harboring a plan to misappropriate funds. However, the signal-
ing DEMO by strict governance covenants could motivate a team member with devious
intentions to quit before being discovered and dismissed. Or team members who overstated
DEMO qualifications for a job might decide to leave voluntarily before their true skill level
was detected. To the extent that this signaling can limit DEMO from agency, it would result
in fewer dismissals. This reasoning leads DEMO to expect that dismissal will be negatively related
to both contractual limits on managerial salaries and conditions for forcing a change in the
ventures DEMO Formally stated, these two hypotheses are:
Hl: The presence of covenants to limit salaries paid to new venture team, members
will decrease the probability of their dismissal.
H2: The presence of covenants to potentially force a change in the new venture team
will decrease the probability DEMO their dismissal.
Whereas both of these covenants provide disincentives for malfeasance, DEMO ar-
rangements provide potential rewards for the achievement of performance objectives, DEMO
would alleviate any need for a dismissal. Agency theory often utilizes strict penalties to dis-
courage agents from pursuing their own self-interests at a DEMO expense. However, it
may be when financing a new venture that DEMO opportunity to own an equity stake in it is a
much more attractive incentive, given the presumed up-side potential of these sorts of deals.
These arguments may be reduced to the following hypothesis:
H.3: The presence of earn-out arrangements for a new venture team will decrease
the DEMO of their dismissal.
Another deduction from agency theory is the importance of firm performance in pre-
dicting managerial dismissal. In fact, its role in dismissals among large firm CEOs has been
this literatures most consistent theme (Fredrickson, Hambrick, and Baumrin 1988). Control-
ling for environmental factors, agency theory suggests that poor performance will typically
be taken as a DEMO of incompetence or opportunism on the part of one or more of the mem-
bers of the top management team (Fama and Jensen 1983: Fiet 1991). NVTs are interested
in how the performance of their ventures will be measured because of the reputation of VCs
for being DEMO monitors who often prefer dismissal over other remedies. Moreover, the
ex DEMO performance representations of the NVTs together with the ex ante expectations
of the VCs are routinely reduced to enforceable contractual covenants. When the perfor-
DEMO of the venture begins to lag. it is not surprising that the likelihood of NVT dismiss-
als increases.
Agency theory predicts that managers have DEMO incentive to demonstrate immediate evi-
dence of sales improvement if they expect to retain their positions (Harrison and Fiet 1995;
Fama and Jensen 1983). Managers can increase sales by reducing profit margins. When sales
DEMO increasing, this also represents a signal to VCs that the venture DEMO moving in a more
profitable direction and lessens the need to make management changes or to immediately
reorient the venture toward a more viable DEMO opportunity. Increased sales should satisfy
VCs in the short-run and should be negatively related to dismissals.

Power
Theory
We next examine two characteristics DEMO the structure of a venture’s board of directors that
could influence its propensity to opt for dismissal as a remedy for underperformance.
Whereas the DEMO organizing principal underlying agency theory is efficiency, the effect of
a DEMO structure on the dismissal decision is based on a power argument, DEMO focuses
on the conditions under which VCs can realize the efficiencies they strive to achieve. We
define board power as its capacity to cause DEMO NVT managers to do something that they
would not have done otherwise (cf., Dahl 19.57, pp. 201-215; Hill and Jones 1995, p. 410).
One way to maintain power is to maintain control by DEMO or centralizing access
to information.
We first examine the effects of board size on its power to dismiss a NVT member. Sec-
ond, we examine the influence of board diversity on its power to dismiss a DEMO member.
In the second case we will focus on the number of insiders versus outsiders on the board.
Each of these characteristics serves as DEMO constraint that limits how VCs can realize the effi-
ciencies they are seeking.
Board
Size
Larger boards usually increase the number and variety of DEMO that can be applied
to strategic decisions (Pearce and Zahra 1991)DEMO Rosenstein et al. (1989,1990,1993) examined
the contributions of board members to a venture and concluded that lead investor board
members contributed DEMO than other board members, but only significantly more when
the lead DEMO was also one of the 20 leading VCs specializing in high technology firms.
In this section we examine the question of whether board size DEMO the contribution
that can be made by any board member. We argue here that larger boards tend to be less
cohesive because each additional DEMO perspective makes it more difficult to reach a
satisfying consensus (Shaw DEMO; Goodstein, Gautam, and Boeker 1994). Lack of cohesion
may DEMO as each board member grapples for power to maintain control of its own interests.
Larger boards may be confronted with a number of obstacles DEMO reaching a consensus
on a dismissal. They provide fewer opportunities to individuals for meaningful participation
(Jewel and Reitz 1981). Lack of opportunity for participation may alienate some board mem-
bers, make them feel powerless, DEMO even less willing to accept the decision of the majority
or to even make strategic decisions (Clendenin 1972; Mintzberg 1983).
As a DEMO increases in size, individual board members feel more dependent upon oth-
DEMO for their bases of power (Daft 1995; French and Raven 1959; Hinings et al. 1974). The
larger number of potential interactions increases the difficulty of coordinated action. As one
result of this coordination problem, larger boards are more likely to develop coalitions with
competing interests, which makes reaching a consensus more difficult (OReilly, Caldwell,
and Barnett DEMO al. 1989; Goodstein, Gautam, and Boeker 1994). These arguments DEMO us
to our fourth hypothesis:
H5: New ventures with larger DEMO of directors will decrease the probability of
dismissal of the new venture team.
Board
Diversity
Many researchers extol board diversity because it may improve DEMO decision-making
by airing more perspectives (Bacon and Brown 1975; Business Week 1987, 1989; Kosnik
COMPLEMENTARY
THEORETICAL
PERSPECTIVES
353
1990, p. 135; McAlmon 1981). It DEMO also reduce the probability of complacency and narrow-
mindedness (Kosnik 1990; Goodstein, Gautum, and Boeker 1994). Although diversity un-
doubtedly assures DEMO more aspects of a management decision will be examined by the
board, at the same time it is likely to complicate and impede the boards power to take decisive
actions. Baysinger and Butler (1985) noted DEMO board members cannot divorce themselves
from the interests of their constituents when they become board members. Those differences
may lead to the development of DEMO and coalitions within the board itself that have the
potential for conflict.
The most frequently cited type of diversity is the distinction between inside DEMO outside
venture directors. Venture insiders are members of the new venture team who also serve
on the board of directors. Venture outsiders are often DEMO appointees who are not part of the
venture management team. VC appointees are likely to be more experienced in coordinating
their efforts than others DEMO the board, particularly if they are also VCs themselves, as a result
of their reported tendency to co-invest with other venture capitalists (Bygrave 1988: Fiet
1995a). In contrast, those board members who are DEMO as officers in the venture. and
who probably had some voice in their own appointment to the board, are likely to be less
experienced in their roles on the board. These differences in experience could make DEMO
action by the VC coalition easier because it would probably face less organized resistance
to decisions such as dismissal.
These differences become particularly important DEMO board members are faced with
complex and ambiguous decisions such as dismissals. Suggestions that someone be fired can
increase uncertainty and intensify individual differences DEMO board members (Mintzberg
1983). These differences can be further exacerbated DEMO hypercompetitive conditions (cf.,
D’Aveni 1994). To the extent that DEMO VC board was filled with outsiders who were VC ap-
pointees, DEMO could enable them to band together to dismiss NVT members.’
H6: DEMO ventures with a higher number of VC-controlled seats on their boards of
directors will increase the probability of dismissal of new venture team members.
DEMO
Justice
Theory
Procedural justice theory holds that perceptions of exchange partner fairness are critical to
the continuity of these relationships. It is our view DEMO understanding lingering perceptions
of the fairness of NVT dismissal among survivors is critical to our understanding of the event.
Procedural justice is defined here DEMO the extent to which the dynamics of the VC-NVT rela-
tionship are judged to be fair by the entrepreneurs of VC-backed ventures. Procedural justice
DEMO suggests that because NVT members expect to be treated fairly by their VCs, the
power of VCs to make strategic changes is constrained. VCs can exercise power. but only
in a “fair” way.
Procedural justice theory DEMO the courtroom metaphor in which the actions of a third

the DEMO number of seats and the total number of VC members increase by one, and their coefficients would
offset each other. We are indebted to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out this potential problem. This
problem would DEMO the interpretation of these hypotheses and would be more consistent with a misalign-
ment of incentives/agency theory story than a power story. Because DEMO venture boards tend to be much
smaller than the boards of large public companies (Rosenstein et al. 1989, pp. 218-219). we assume DEMO
changes would be more likely to be made through replacement, which DEMO be consistent with the mainte-
nance of a smaller board and a power story interpretation.

party such as a judge or an DEMO are evaluated for fairness by the litigants (Thibaut
and Walker 1975)DEMO Thus, two or more parties are perceived to be involved in DEMO form of ex-
change with one party (e.g., the judge or arbitrator) who is granted reward distribution au-
thority over the others (DEMO et al. 1993). The effectiveness of the courtroom as a problem-
solving institution is argued to be based more on the procedures used DEMO determine reward
distribution (e.g., procedural justice) than on the degree DEMO which the rewards are of equal
magnitude (e.g., distributive justice). Thus, a primary insight of the procedural justice ap-
proach is that the process by which outcomes are meted out can be more critical DEMO exchange
partners than their actual distribution.
Translating procedural justice to the case of dyadic exchange suggests that preserving
an effective ongoing relationship requires that DEMO be able to maintain the perception
that their exchange partner is acting fairly in compensating them for any work or effort they
contribute (Greenberg 1987). An exchange partner may be able to retain his or DEMO motiva-
tion to perform, even when an overt punishment has been DEMO from the other party,
as long as the punishment is deemed to have been administered fairly. The primary way of
demonstrating that an DEMO punishment is fair, and not a cavalier act of power, is to show
the positive effects that the punishment is expected to have DEMO both parties in the future.
From a procedural justice perspective, the DEMO of NVT members can be viewed as a
form of punishment that impacts future VC-NVT relations.
Sapienza and Korsgaard (1994) applied the procedural DEMO approach to the VC-
NVT relationship. They report the results of a simulation of VC investing that was designed
so that the justice judgment DEMO made by the VC. They used graduate business student subjects
to simulate VCs with four prospective deals for possible investment. They found that their
DEMO VCs invested primarily based on feedback received from the (computer-simulated)
DEMO rather than the degree to which the entrepreneur appeared to be influenced by
the VC. These VCs invested more, monitored less, and had DEMO favorable attitudes toward
ventures when they received timely feedback.
We suspect that VCs realize that it is important for them to avoid causing venture DEMO
agers to lose their enthusiasm for the venture, particularly as any DEMO for a dismissal be-
comes apparent. One way that VCs could minimize a loss of enthusiasm after a dismissal
would be to carefully ensure DEMO the NVT perceived that it was treated fairly. Ex ante, there
DEMO at least three actions that VCs could take to ensure that they are perceived as having
treated dismissed managers fairly.
First, VCs concerned with a sense of fairness would not force their views of the business
DEMO the NVT. In arguing that they would not act dictatorially, we DEMO not suggesting that
they are passive investors. VCs have a fiduciary responsibility to their limited partners to
positively influence the venture’s performance, as suggested by Jensen (1993). For example,
we know that venture capitalists are often very active participants in the activities and deci-
sions of DEMO firm (Fried and Hisrich 1992; Sapienza 1992; Rosenstein 1988). DEMO typically
provide the firm with advice on operational and financial issues (DEMO and Sahlman 1989)
in addition to strategic and marketing issues (DEMO et al. 1996, in press; Bygrave 1987).
A procedural justice perspective suggests that VC advice will not be forced on the NVT DEMO
preserve the teams support and enthusiasm for the venture.
Second, VCs DEMO be willing to compromise with the NVT when there were differ-
ences over the management of the venture. Compromise would be more likely to DEMO in the
face of hypercompetition where the speed of response to competitive threats is of paramount
importance (cf., D’Aveni 1994). Competitive threats DEMO have the effect of bringing the
parties together to ensure their mutual survival. For high technology firms, VCs and NVTs

would attempt to reach compromise solutions so they DEMO avoid being devastated by ag-
gressive competitors as a result of responding too slowly while they debated their differences.
Third, VCs concerned with a sense of fairness would encourage the development of
new ideas by the DEMO Where impending dismissal was based upon concerns about venture
performance, a DEMO ideas about potential product markets could contribute to eventually
salvaging the VCs investment in the venture. In such cases, members of the NVT who gener-
ated new ideas could be recognized by VCs as indispensable to DEMO ventures future. New
ideas brought forth by likely NVT survivors also help VCs to develop the NVT into a cohe-
sive working group after DEMO dismissal occurs. Before the dismissal, the solicitation of ideas
from the DEMO is also an important means of validating the importance of survivors. Idea
solicitation would also facilitate the normalization of the exchange relationship.
In summary, when VCs demonstrate that they are willing to treat the NVT fairly, they
will be more effective in preserving the enthusiasm of NVT survivors DEMO a VC-initiated
dismissal. There are at least three actions that VC can take to ensure that an NVT dismissal
is not viewed as strictly DEMO, but intended to improve the future prospects of the venture
Formally DEMO, these concepts lead to our last hypothesis:
H7: VCs who act in a procedurally just manner will be less likely to dismiss DEMO
of the NVT.
METHODS
Sample
Subjects for this research were those firms who had received at least one round of venture
capital funding. These DEMO firms were initially identified from the Venture Capital Jour-
nal. After screening out prospects with invalid addresses, we identified a sample of 837 firms.
Dillman’s (1978) total design method was utilized to construct the surveys DEMO compile the
questions into a booklet format. After the initial mailing, DEMO postcard reminder was sent one
week later and follow-up surveys were sent to nonrespondents three and six weeks after
the initial mailing, as suggested by Dillman. Replies were received from 235 firms: however,
30 of the responding firms did not qualify for this study because they had DEMO recently re-
ceived first-round financing, which is funding to initiate full-scale DEMO and sales.
Most nonqualifiers had only received funding to execute a leveraged buyout. A few had only
received seed financing, which is funding for product development, market research, proto-
type development, and initial marketing. Because this study’s domain was the VC-NVT rela-
tionship at the time of DEMO funding, these firms were excluded from further analysis.
This process resulted DEMO replies from 205 firms, for a usable response rate of 24%. DEMO
to SIC classifications, 83% of the respondents were from firms in DEMO tech” areas. The
average age of the venture firms was 4.9 years (SD = 4.45), and the average number of em-
ployees was 145 (SD = 394).
Given the risk inherent in these ventures, VCs often indicate a preference for syndicat-
ing their investments as a way of diversifying their risk (Bygrave 1987). The venture capitalist
who takes the lead in funding the deal and who generally invests the DEMO amount plays
the role of lead investor. The lead investor also has the principal fiduciary responsibility to
ensure that the NVT is acting in DEMO best interests of all VC investors (Fiet 1995b).
Respondents in DEMO study were funded by VC syndicates that were comprised of an
average of 3.1 VC firms. The average amount of their first-round funding was DEMO million

(SD = 2.87). Their total average amount of capital under management was $121 million
(SD = 149).
All surveys were personally addressed to the president of the venture firm. DEMO presi-
dent was selected because we assumed that he or she would be the most qualified to respond
for all members of the NVT. DEMO addition, we were more certain that a ventures top officer
would DEMO as its president than we were about the corporate titles that would be used
by other team members.
The detailed and specific nature of DEMO questions required that the respondent be very
familiar with the operation of the venture, including key issues that impacted decisions made
at the time of first-round funding. One section of the survey instrument solicited open-ended
comments DEMO respondents. It was evident from these comments that the president of the
venture was actually the respondent. On a few occasions the chief financial DEMO supplied
the president with requested financial information.’
The dependent variable for this study was the dismissal of NVT members from the ven-
ture. Respondents DEMO asked “How many employees in your firm have venture capitalists
played a major role in dismissing ?” Because dismissal is usually an event versus something
that occurs incrementally, we dichotomized this variable for analysis purposes. We found
121 instances of complete data for hypothesis testing. Of these observations, 43 reported
cases of dismissal (28 firms noted one dismissal, 12 DEMO two dismissals, and all other obser-
vations with three or more DEMO per firm occurred only once within our data set).

Regarding the contractual covenants in the above equation, respondents were asked
if limits on managerial salaries (xi) and conditions for forcing a change in management (x2)
were included as a part of the deal for first round venture capital financing. DEMO
were also asked if earn-out arrangements (x3) were included as a part of the first-round ven-
ture capital financing for their firm. Each DEMO these was coded as 1 if it was in place at the
time of first-round funding, whereas all other responses were coded as 0. The change in sales
(xx) was computed by subtracting annual sales DEMO year of first-round financing from the an-
nual sales for the year after first-round financing. This difference was then divided by the
mean number DEMO employees for these two years (several outliers were removed). This DEMO
tor measures the change in sales since the beginning of VC involvement with the venture.
For the board structure variables, respondents were asked two questions regarding their
board of directors. The first question addressed the size DEMO the board: “After first-round fi-
nancing, what was the total number of seats on your firms board of directors?” (x4). The
second question addressed the presence of venture capitalists on the board: “After hrst-
round financing, what was the total number of seats controlled by venture capitalists on your
firms board of directors?” (x5).
The procedural justice variable (x6) represented the NVTs perceptions of the fairness
DEMO its treatment by its NVT, which we attempted to capture through DEMO use of its three most
commonly identified dimensions: (1) formal DEMO, (2) explanation or information
offered, and (3) interpersonal treatment (Greenberg 1990; Gilliland 1993). The indicators
of these three dimensions DEMO: (1) “Our VCs are willing to compromise with us” (represen-
tativeness), (2) “Our VCs have supported the development of new DEMO ideas” (explana-
tion or information offered) and (3) “Our VCs force us to accept their business views” [re-
verse coded] (interpersonal treatment). Respondents coded their answers on a S-point Likert
scale ranging from DEMO disagree to strongly agree. The responses to these three indica-
tors were totaled and then divided by three to arrive at their mean values. DEMO Cronbach
alpha for these three items was 0.71.
The probability that one or more members of the venture team with characteristics Xj
will be DEMO by its VC is shown as P[Dj=llX,]. Taking the natural logarithm of both
sides in (1) yields the linear relationship between the DEMO and the logit or log odds ratio:

RESULTS
Table 1 reports the correlations, means, standard deviations, minimums, and maximums of
factors impacting the dismissal of NVT members. Table 2 reports the statistics for assessing
the fit of DEMO model to the data as well as the parameter estimates from the logistic regressions
that estimated the probability of the occurrence of NVT dismissal. DEMO chi-squared statistic
indicates that the analysis has produced a statistically significant model. Given the results in
Table 2, the null hypothesis of no contribution by this set of explanatory variables is rejected.
The coefficients in Table DEMO are the log odds ratios of the factors contributing to the
dismissal phenomenon. However, if we want to know the relative contributions of each of
these factors (Xi) to dismissal, we must calculate their individual instantaneous rates of
change as follows:

tives indicate the direction of the change of the impact of an explanatory variable, whereas
their magnitudes represent the impact on dismissal of a one unit change in the value of an
DEMO variable (Fomby, Hill, and Johnson 1984, p. 348). These partial derivatives are
found in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
This study provides support DEMO the underlying proposition that the dismissal of NVT mem-
bers can be understood more fully if we examine it from at least three perspectives: agency
theory, power theory, and procedural justice theory. The discussion of DEMO theoretical re-
sults follows. Afterward, the discussion turns to the issue DEMO what this research has contrib-
uted to our understanding of each perspective, followed by what we have learned about the
best way to handle dismissal in a new venture setting. This section concludes by discussing
directions DEMO future research.
Agency Theory
Hypothesis 1 was supported. Contractual covenants limiting salaries paid to the venture
managers are related to fewer dismissals. They effectively DEMO that unsatisfactory perfor-
mance may result in dismissal. This finding supports the view that clearly signaling the conse-
quences of an undesirable behavior can DEMO its incidence. So it may be that venture man-
agers avoid dismissal by avoiding those actions that could lead to it. We may infer DEMO early
signaling of severe financial consequences to those managers who fail to meet their perfor-
mance goals is quite an effective mechanism for aligning DEMO financial interests with the
VCs and those of the ventures board of directors.
Hypothesis 2 was not supported. Dismissal covenants to force a change DEMO the NVT
are not related to dismissal. This result was quite unexpected, because they seemed to pro-
vide very clear and direct signals regarding the VC’s performance expectations and the possi-
ble consequences if they were DEMO satisfied. It may be that individual venture managers un-
derstood that the threat of a dismissal covenant was real, although extreme from their point
of view, but that they preferred to believe that it would be used against other members of
the NVT, rather than against them. However, we learn that specifying the conditions that

Hypothesis 4 was supported. It indicates a negative relationship between sales improve-
ment per DEMO since first-round funding and dismissal. This result is consistent with stud-
ies of large firms-dismissal occurs when firms perform poorly. It is also consistent DEMO Ro-
senstein et al.‘s (1989) findings among small firms that 39% of companies performing above
average had replaced their CEOs; in contrast, DEMO of companies performing below average
had replaced their CEOs (p. 226)DEMO Investors are interested in the efficient (i.e., profitable)
operation of the firms in which they invest. If they do not achieve it, investors consider dis-
missing NVT members as a remedy.
Power
Theory
For DEMO 5, as predicted, increasing the total number of seats on the ventures board
of directors was found to be negatively related to the DEMO of members of the NVT.
This result is consistent with the power theory interpretation that larger boards lack cohesion
among board members who are DEMO with the fiduciary responsibility to take decisive
action when they believe it is necessary to improve venture performance.
Hypothesis 6 was also supported. That DEMO, increasing the number of VC-controlled seats
on a venture’s board of DEMO was found to be positively related to the dismissal of mem-
bers of the NVT. This finding suggests that individuals, even if they are self-interested, may
join together in a united effort to dismiss an ineffective NVT member. However, VC ap-
pointees tend to maximize their financial interests in a venture to the extent that they can
gain support for DEMO proposals on the board, or alternatively, control of the board using
all their available bases of power. This result raises the question of DEMO VC appointees
should borrow authority from their positions on the board to sanction and provide legitimacy
to their views and when they should cooperate DEMO other board members so that the most
efficient decision solution can be reached. This research does not attempt to answer this
question. However, Rosenstein et al. (1993) found that the top venture capital firms tend

Procedural
Justice
Theory
The seventh hypothesis predicted a negative relationship between procedural justice in the
VC-NVT relationship and NVT dismissal. It was also supported. DEMO procedural justice
had about the same effect on dismissal as salary limits, one of the agency-related antecedents.
Whereas salary limits send a no-nonsense signal, how can we explain a more procedurally
just approach resulting in approximately the same number of dismissals?
To explain the similar effects of DEMO procedural justice and the agency-related anteced-
ents, it is useful to DEMO that the procedural justice approach entails more than acting in

Research
Figure 1 illustrates that this study found some support for the agency theory prediction that
investors do DEMO members of an ineffective new venture management team. Two agency-
related antecedents, salary limits and sales, received particularly strong support, but evi-
dence for dismissal covenants and earn-out arrangements was inconclusive. However, there
is more to this dismissal story than merely the economic performance of the venture.
DEMO VCs may prefer to maximize the value of their holdings by using their power
to dismiss ineffective NVT members, they are constrained in doing so by at least two other
sets of factors. The first is DEMO structure of the board of directors, particularly its size and
the DEMO of VC-controlled seats. These structural features limit a VC’s power to overcome
resistance to dismissals from other members of the board.
The second is DEMO apparent requirement for procedural justice, which is the need to
demonstrate DEMO the dismissals were carried out fairly and were in the best interests of the
venture, the NVT survivors, and the VC. Otherwise, survivors could be less enthusiastic
about any success the venture might enjoy because DEMO might fear that they would not be
employed long enough to enjoy it.
In summary, Figure 1 illustrates what this research adds to our understanding of NVT

dismissals. Poor performance is associated with NVT dismissals, as predicted by agency the-
ory. However, the actual occurrence of dismissals seems to be moderated by the power of
the board of directors (i.e., as illustrated by the smaller the size of the board and the greater
the number of VC-controlled seats) and the necessity to act in a procedurally just manner
so NVT survivors will not feel threatened.
DEMO complementary insights from three different perspectives are reminiscent of the
sometimes impatient discussion of the relative value of agency theory versus traditional man-
agement DEMO between Jay Barney (1990) and Lex Donaldson (1990a, 1990b) DEMO which
the former cited Clay Alderfer. Professor Alderfer argued that many of the conflicts between
academic disciplines could be analyzed using models of intergroup DEMO (Barney 1990,
pp. 389-390) According to Barney (1990), DEMO debates often devolve into turf battles with
the combatants erecting intellectual barriers to entry presumably by influencing gatekeepers
who guard the most influential publication DEMO These turf wars, Barney (1990) argued,
inhibit intellectual inquiry DEMO stifle debate, which ultimately eviscerates the most potentially
interesting and productive DEMO It is our view that the findings of the present study provide
a hopeful indication that an interdisciplinary approach to research in the social DEMO and

Lessons for
VCs and New Venture
Managers
There are useful lessons in this research for VCs and new venture managers. First, the use
of explicit contractual covenants to signal the adverse consequences of underperformance
may not DEMO dismissals if the signals are misunderstood or disbelieved. Moreover, these
signals DEMO could be costly investments with uncertain returns.
Second, before committing itself DEMO fund a deal, a VC ought to consider how the struc-
DEMO of a board of directors will limit its ability to effect changes in the composition of the
management team. The larger the board, the more difficult it will be to make changes unless
VC appointees occupy DEMO of the seats.
Third, dismissal may not be the best option DEMO the venture’s success depends upon the
specialized skills of its surviving managers These survivors could be very costly to replace
if they become disenchanted DEMO quit as a result of a dismissal that was carried out arbitrarily.
Procedural justice theory suggests that dismissals must appear to be carried out DEMO, which
could increase the short-term costs of changing the management team.
DEMO, focusing on reducing the number of NVT dismissals as a goal DEMO VCs or alterna-
tively using them to improve venture performance are objectives with uncertain benefits.
Sorting out these effects on performance is beyond the DEMO of this study.
Directions
for Future
Research
Understanding how NVT dismissal affects performance is vitally important and goes
beyond identifying dismissals antecedents. We need DEMO data, stronger theory, and
carefully developed controls that rule out spurious influences on our interpretation. This
study has provided some evidence of the DEMO to use multiple perspectives to identify possi-
ble endogenous and exogenous influences. It also provides researchers with more justifica-
tion for being guided in DEMO adoption of theoretical perspectives by their research questions,
364
J.O. FIET ET AL.
rather than by a particular perspective that DEMO be momentarily popular. The findings from
this study also recommend the use of a wide screen, rather than a narrow one, to avoid DEMO
the formulation of hypotheses.
The study of dismissal in new ventures offers great promise to those who study it among
larger firms, which frequently compete in multiple industries, in multiple businesses, and with
very complex DEMO different sets of resource endowments. In contrast, research of dismissal in
DEMO ventures offers the promise of a more controlled setting to study its antecedents
and effects.
Finally, in the future it is our view that the most productive inquiries in venture capital
and entrepreneurship will be theory DEMO rather than exploratory. Many promising frame-
works exist for this purpose, DEMO which are agency theory, transaction cost economics,
procedural justice theory, power theory, and recent perspectives from the decision-making
literature, among others. DEMO considered as separate lenses, or when used in combina-
tion as DEMO the present study, an intellectual feast awaits those who have the DEMO for in-
vestigating it.
