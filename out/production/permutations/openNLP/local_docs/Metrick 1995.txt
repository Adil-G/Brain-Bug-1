The results suggest that, while most players bet in a rational manner, the failure rate for choosing best-responses increases as the betting problem grows more complex and that players' choices are affected by the "frame" of the problem. However, suboptimal betting tends to decrease as inferior players are driven from the game. The data also allow for estimation of the extent of risk aversion; the results imply near risk-neutrality. (JEL C72, C93, D81) Since Maurice Allais's famous experi- ment (Allais and Ole Hagen, 1979), economists have documented considerable evidence on individual choice behavior un- der uncertainty. Yet, almost all of this evi- dence comes from laboratory experiments and involves the use of small or imaginary incentives.' This paper introduces evidence from a natural experiment of a large-stakes strategic decision problem. The natural ex- periment is the television game show "Jeopardy!" The cost, in prizes, of running an equivalent experiment in the laboratory would be over 5 million dollars. Television game shows provide an inter- esting opportunity for economists. Many of these shows are structured so that, at some point, players face well-defined decision problems; often, these decision problems are in the form of strategic games.2 On the show Jeopardy, three players compete by answering questions in various general- knowledge categories.3 In the first two rounds, scores are accumulated through the answers to 60 different questions. Then, the first part of the game ends, and all players who have a positive score advance to the third and final round, called "Final Jeop- ardy." This round contains the strategic game studied in this paper. In Final Jeopardy (FJ), players are shown a single category from which they will be asked one question. After seeing the scores of the other players and the category (but not the question), players are given several minutes to compute a bet on the success of * Department of Economics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138.

Binswanger (1980, 1981). 3As anyone who has watched the show is aware, Jeopardy contestants do not answer questions, they "question answers." All clues on the board are given in the form of statements (answers), and contestants who ring in must phrase their "answers" in the form of questions. In order to avoid confusing the reader, I use the conventional definitions of question and answer in the paper. My apologies to Jeopardy purists. 240 VOL. 85 NO. 1 ME TRICK. A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN "JEOPARDY!" 241 their answer. Players cannot bet more than their score or less than zero. Then, the question is revealed and players are given 30 seconds to write their answers. After time has elapsed, the answers and bets are revealed; correct answers are rewarded by adding the bet to the score, and incorrect answers are penalized by subtracting the bet from the score. At the end of this round, the player with the highest score is declared the winner. This player is allowed to keep her score in dollars and is invited back to play the next day. The second- and third- place players receive prizes but do not keep any of their score. In the event of a tie for first, all tied players get to keep the money and return the next day. If a player wins five consecutive games, then she is retired from the show but invited to the Tournament of Champions, for large cash prizes, at the end of the year.4 Since only the winner of the entire game gets to keep her prize, the FJ betting prob- lem is crucial to the players. The large prizes coupled with subjects who are well in- formed about the rules make this an inter- esting game for study. The additional ad- vantage of a market mechanism, in the form of champions returning to play again and poor players being "driven out," gives this problem further credibility as a natural ex- periment. The purpose of this paper is to use the data from this experiment to draw inference about risk attitudes and the ability of players to play best-responses in strategic situations. The main drawback of using a natural experiment is that there are many factors left uncontrolled. For this reason, the analysis in this paper is mostly descrip- tive, and my conclusions do not include any definitive tests of choice theories. The paper is organized as follows: Sec- tion I gives the notation for the paper, pre- sents some basic data, and describes the two classes of the FJ problem studied in the paper. Section II turns to the first of these two classes in order to analyze behavior under uncertainty. The "game" studied in this section is not really a game at all, since it will encompass only situations in which one player is so far ahead that she can guarantee victory. Her choice of actions in this context provides large-stakes evidence about risk aversion. The risk attitudes im- plied here show less risk-averse behavior than seen in the most comparable study. Section III studies a class of FJ in which the first- and second-place players bet against each other and can mostly ignore the ac- tions of the third-place player. The objec- tive here is to see whether the players are playing best-responses to the observed "em- pirical frequency" of strategies played by their opponents in my sample of similar games. I call such bets "empirical-best-re- sponses."'5 The evidence shows that, for this class of games, first-place players almost all play empirical-best-responses. Conversely, there is strong evidence that second-place players do not choose empirical-best- responses, and in addition, there are indica- tions that their choices are affected by the "frame" of the game. The difference in performance between the first- and second- place players seems to be the result of dif- ferent levels of complexity in the strategic problems that they must solve before mak- ing their bets. Also, there is evidence that experienced players are more likely than nonexperienced players to play an empiri- cal-best-response. Finally, Section IV pro- vides a short discussion of the conclusions. I. Setup and Basic Statistics A.

I rank these players by their scores and denote them as the initial en- dowment vector X = (x1, X2, X3). Players are then presented with a category, and they must form an estimate of each player's probability of correctly answering a ques- tion in this category. There are eight possi- ble combinations of correct/incorrect an- swers (states of nature) among the three players. Let A = (a,, a2, a3) be the vector that represents correct/incorrect answers, with ai = 1 for correct answers and ai = 0 for incorrect answers, and let Pi(A) be the ith-place player's subjective probability that state A will occur. From their initial scores, subjective probability distributions of the states, and beliefs about the bets of the other players, each player must choose some bet Yi, yi < xi, so as to maximize the ex- pected utility of her winnings. Let Y = (Y1, Y2, y3) be the vector of these bets. Final scores Z = (z1, z2, Z3), are calculated by zi= xi + Yi if ai=1 and zi= xi- yi if ai = 0. The winner is the player with the highest zi. In the event of a tie, all tied players "win." The winner's prize is to keep her score in dollars. Second- and third-place players do not keep any of their score, al- though they do get prizes. These prizes are in the form of "goods," not money, with the second-place prize being more valuable. This difference is small, however, and in no case would it exceed a few hundred dollars in market price. B. Data and Statistics The data used in this paper were taken from original Jeopardy programs broadcast between October 1989 and January 1992.6 There are 393 total games yielding over 1,150 total decisions made by about 1,000 different subjects. Although I do not have hard data on the characteristics of Jeopardy contestants, it is likely that they are, in general, wealthier and better educated than TABLE 1-FREQUENCY OF THE STATES FOR PLAYERS 1, 2, AND 3 State Number of (a,, a2, a3) observations Frequency (1, 1, 1) 75.0 f(1, 1, 1) = 0.20 (1, 1,0) 47.0 f(l,1, 0) = 0.13 (1, 0, 1) 43.5 f(1, 0, 1) = 0.12 (1,0,0) 45.5 f(1,0,0)= 0.12 (0,1,1) 26.5 f(0, 1,1) = 0.07 (0,1,0) 40.0 f(0,1,0)=0.11 (0,0, 1) 26.5 f(0, 0, 1) = 0.07 (0,0,0) 65.0 f(0,0,0)= 0.18 Notes: A "1" indicates a correct answer for that player. Thus, all three players answered correctly in f(1, 1, 1) = 0.20 of the games.

In this case, the states are presented with a3 ignored. From these two tables, one can calculate the frequency that a player in the ith posi- tion answers correctly. These frequencies are f(al = 1)= 225/393 = 0.57, f(a2 = 1)= 201.5/393 = 0.51 and f(a3 = 1) = 171.5/369 = 0.46. The fact that a player's position is a significant predictor of his success in FJ suggests that other statistics might matter as well. Surprisingly, if one controls for a player's position, then the score, xi, has no predictive power. In a logit regression of FJ success (1 if right, 0 if wrong) on both position and score, the coefficient on posi- tion is positive and significant at the 5-per- cent level, while the coefficient on score is negative and insignificant. This implies that it is the relative position among the three players that predicts the probability of win- ning and that the amount they are ahead or behind adds little predictive power. Since champions return to play again, players contemplating bets that give differ- ent probabilities of winning need to esti- mate the value of their future Jeopardy earnings. Since these estimates form an im- portant part of the analysis in later sections, it is useful to look at some sample statistics. Defining W as the random variable repre- senting future winnings for a first-time champion, the sample frequencies for vari- ous ranges are given in Table 3. The ex- pected value of W is $13,600 in this sample. Since estimates of future winnings of multi- game champions are similar, I will use the same W for all players.8 Overall, one can split FJ into two mutu- ally exclusive types of games: in the first, player 1 is so far ahead of player 2 that x1 ? 2x2. In this case, she can guarantee winning by betting y1 < x1 - 2x2. The game is then reduced to a pure individual maxi- mization problem, and one can analyze the implied risk attitudes given by player l's choice of y1. For my sample, 110 of the 393 games are of this type, and these games are studied in Section II. In the remaining 283 games, xi <2x2. Here, at the very least, player 2 can threaten player l's lead by betting Y2 = x2. In fact, it is this exact bet which player 1 most often "defends" against, since the most obvious betting regularity in these games is the tendency for the first- place player to bet just enough (by $1) to "shutout" player 2 if both should answer correctly: y1 = 2x2 - x1 + 1. This shutout bet is observed in almost half of the games, and when it is not made, the actual bet is usually quite close to it. Table 4 presents summary data on ranges of y1 for the 283 games in which x1 < 2x2. To give a frame of reference, note that the average levels of x1 and x2 for these games are, respectively, $8,120 and $6,145. Within the 283 games of this type, there is a subclass of 76 games in which both player 1 and player 2 have two main strate- gic options at their disposal and player 3's score is low enough so that his actions can be safely ignored. In Section III, I describe this subclass and analyze both players' spe- cific betting choices. II. Runaway Games: xl ? 2x2 A. Preliminary Discussion The first class of games occurs when player 1 is so far ahead of player 2 in FJ 8 Although the probability of winning the next game and of reaching the Tournament of Champions in- creases as championship tenure increases, the time remaining before forced retirement (after five wins) decreases. These two factors almost exactly cancel. 244 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 1995 TABLE 4-BEHAVIOR OF PLAYER 1 WHEN X1 < 2 X2 Number of Yi observations Frequency Y1<2X2-x1 8 0.03 y1= 2X2 - X1 26 0.09 y1= 2X2 - X1 + 1 135 0.48 2X2-X1+1<y1<2X2-X1+100 40 0.14 2X2 - X1 + 100 < y1 < 2x2 - X1 + 1,000 40 0.14 y1 > 2X2 - X1 + 1,000 34 0.12 that she can guarantee winning and advanc- ing to the next game as champion. If x1 > 2x2, then, by setting any y1 < x1 -2x2, player 1 can ensure that she keeps at least x1- y1, which wins regardless of player 2's bet. Of course, there is no reason why player 1 cannot bet more than x1 - 2x2, but she would then risk losing her bet and the full expected value of future-winnings, while she could gain only the amount of her bet. In general, player 1 is faced with the simple problem of deciding how much to wager on the chance that she will answer the FJ ques- tion correctly. A typical example of this problem occurs if X = (10,000, 2,000, 1,000). Here, player 1 can wager any y1 < 6,000 and still be sure of winning. If one knew her subjective probability of answering cor- rectly, then, as long as she chooses some y1 < 6,000, it would be possible to form an estimate for her coefficient of absolute risk aversion. In this section, a related experi- ment is performed on the sample of 110 games which satisfy x1 2 2x2. Since I do not know any player's subjective probability of answering correctly, it is not possible to calculate specific risk parameters for any individual. Instead, I make several assump- tions that allow for an estimate of the risk aversion of a representative player in the sample. B. Results Player l's decision problem is modeled as (1) max[pU(xl+y1+Wu) Yi + (1-p)U(x1-Y, + Wu)I subject to Y1<x1-2x2 y1 2 O where x1 and x2 are known constants, p is her subjective probability of answering cor- rectly [i.e., p = P1(a1 = 1)], and Wu is her certainty equivalent of W for utility func- tion U.9 I altered the true problem by adding in the constraint that y1 must be small enough to ensure victory even if a1 = 0. Since none of the 110 players faced with this decision violated this "constraint" and bet more than x1 - 2x2, this formulation is not inconsistent with the data. When the constraints do not bind, the first-order con- dition of (1) implies a solution for y1. In the special case of constant absolute risk aver- sion, U(x) = 1- eax, ln(f (2) Yi1 2 2a! From this equation, if I had uncensored y1 for every player and knowledge of their private p, it would be possible to calculate an a for every individual. Since this infor- mation is not available, I instead estimate an a for the "representative" player, that is, the constant value of a that is most likely to result in the observed sample of bets (y1) and correct/incorrect answers (a1). To ob- tain this a, it is necessary to first make the assumption that there is no error in player l's calculation of her optimal y1. This 9I assume that Wu is invariant around the level of wealth changes which occur from correct or incorrect answers. This is done to avoid having to calculate a new certainty equivalent dependent on current-game winnings. VOL. 85 NO. 1 ME TRICK: A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN "JEOPARDY!" 245 allows equation (2) to be written as exp(2ayl) (2') P 1 + exp(2ay1) Since this is exactly the form of a logit regression, it is possible to calculate the maximum-likelihood level of a in a straight- forward way; with a, as the dependent vari- able and y1 as the independent variable, the slope coefficient is a consistent estimate of 2 a.10 This formulation also allows for a simple handling of the censoring on y1. Since I am estimating the likelihood of cor- rect answers (p) conditional on bets (y1), any subset of the bets can be dropped with- out introducing bias. Therefore, I drop the two observations where y = 0 and the four observations where y1 = xl - 2x2. This leaves 104 uncensored observations. Using this sample, the point estimate is 0.000066 for a, with a standard error of 0.000056. Since this estimate is not significantly dif- ferent from 0, I cannot reject a null hypoth- esis that the representative player is risk- neutral.'1 Note that the model also implies that there is no intercept term in equation (2'). The evidence does not reject this impli- cation; for the intercept, the point estimate is - 0.179 with a standard error of 0.297. To get a visceral sense for the risk atti- tudes implied by a, the point estimate can be translated into a certainty equivalent of 4,190 for the lottery (10,000, 0.5)-a lottery which gives a 50-percent chance at winning $10,000 and a 50-percent chance at winning nothing. This certainty equivalent "seems" high; for example, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1979) report that the major- ity of certainty equivalents for a (1,000, 0.5) lottery fall between $300 and $400. To go beyond a visceral sense for this result, it is necessary to look to related research. Most other empirical studies of risk aver- sion focus on estimating the coefficient of relative risk aversion,12 but since I lack data on wealth levels of the players, it is difficult to make useful comparisons with this litera- ture. However, a recent paper by Gertner (1993) provides a remarkably similar data set. In this work, the author looked at choice behavior in the television game show "Card Sharks," where the "bonus" round of play provides a well-defined betting problem played for large stakes. He calculates a lower bound for a of 0.000310.13 This is more than four standard errors above the esti- mate here of an a for the representative player. One possible partial explanation for this large disparity is that Jeopardy contes- tants are wealthier than those in Card Sharks, and my constant-absolute-risk-aver- sion specification has hidden the fact that absolute risk aversion actually declines with higher wealth levels. This explanation is not implausible. Another possibility is that play- ers are overestimating their probability of success; if subjective estimates of p are systematically higher than the sample aver- age, then players will appear less risk-averse 10I am grateful to Michael Boozer and Orley Ashenfelter for suggesting this logit estimation. "1There are several other reasonable approaches to the censoring problem; the approach used in the text leads to a comparatively high estimate for a. For example, out of 110 players in our sample, 20 chose to bet exactly yj=xj-2x2-1, or $1 below the con- straint used in the model. It is likely that most of these players chose this bet because they preferred to win outright rather than allow the possibility for a tie. Since I did not explicitly model this preference, the estima- tion treated these 20 players as unconstrained. If, in- stead, these observations are dropped from the sample, then one obtains a point estimate of 0.000037 for a, with a standard error of 0.000061. Also, it is possible to relax the assumption that player 1 correctly calculates y1 and simultaneously model the censoring through a Tobit estimation of equation (2). Then, by making assumptions about the calculation error and the distri- bution of p in the sample, one can back out a value for representative a; for a wide range of reasonable as- sumptions, the resulting estimates for a are very simi- lar to those obtained under the logit estimation of (2'). Details of these computations can be obtained from the author. 12The most extensive work in this area is by Kenneth R. MacCrimmon and Donald A. Wehrung (1986). See Ralph L. Keeney and Howard Raiffa (1976) for a survey of earlier studies. Other work has been carried out using stock-market data by researchers primarily interested in testing stock-market theories, but information about relative risk aversion is also estimated (Larry G. Epstein and Stanley E. Zin, 1991). 13Gertner (1993) also finds evidence that players do not bet according to expected utility theory. Because of this finding, his estimates of a should be viewed de- scriptively. 246 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 1995 than they actually are. In Card Sharks, play- ers deal with computable risks, and should not suffer from this bias. This "overestima- tion of success" could also explain some of the results of the next section. III. Bet High or Low? A. Preliminary Discussion The example of "runaway games" is not a very interesting strategic problem. Player 1 has a decision to make, but as long as she does not violate the constraint that Y1 < x1 -2x2, she need not concern herself with the behavior of the second- or third-place players. When x1 < 2x2, however, this is no longer the case. In these situations, player 2 can always challenge player 1 by betting, Y2 2 X1 - x2, thus forcing player 1 to choose a bet based on her estimates of the. proba- bilities of the final states. This strategic problem becomes more interesting as x1 and x2 grow closer together. This section studies games in which 3x2 2 2x1 and x2 > 2x3. The first restriction, 3x2? 2x1, ensures that player 2 has at least two "interesting" strategies at his disposal. The second re- striction, x2? 2x3, simplifies the problem by making it possible to "ignore" the ac- tions of the third player. The importance of these restrictions is illustrated by the following example. Con- sider X = (10,000, 7,000, 1,000), and Pi(a1 = 1), Pi(a2 = 1) calculated from the sample frequencies in Table 2. One strong implica- tion of the data, as will be seen, is that in these situations there is a focal-point bet of Yi = 4,001. With this bet, player 1 seeks to "shut out" player 2 by making the smallest possible bet which ensures victory (not just a tie) if she answers correctly (a1 = 1). In fact, this exact bet is played in over half of the games of this type. Overall, more than 90 percent of these games show player 1 playing some y1 > 4,000. When y1 = 4,001, then z1 will be either 14,001 (if a1 = 1) or 5,999 (if a1 = 0). Player 2 has two main strategies at his disposal, although each strategy may be represented by many dif- ferent bets. The first strategy is to play Low. "Low" strategies are represented by all bets such that 7,000 - Y2 2 5,999. Any bet satis- fying this restriction will win for player 2 whenever a1 = 0. The simplest Low bet is Y2= 0, but of course any Y2 < 1,001 will also do. The second strategy for player 2 is, not surprisingly, to play High. "High" strategies are represented by all bets Y2 > 1,001. When Yi = 4,001, High bets only win when a1 = 0 and a2 = 1. By this strategy, player 2 is saying, "I will sacrifice my added probability of winning in return for a higher payoff when I do win." Given that player 2 only wins (and keeps his money) when his an- swer is right, the natural High bet is to bet everything, Y2 = 7,000. This intuition is rein- forced by the fact that about 10 percent of first-place players bet exactly y1 = 4,000 in these types of games. In this specific case, Y2= 7,000 will tie when a1 = a2 = 1, whereas other High bets less than 7,000 will not. For this reason I give the bet of Y2 = x2= 7,000 a special name of All. The importance of the restriction 3x2 > 2x1 becomes clear if one limits attention to the focal bet. If, say, X = (10,000, 6,000, 1,000), then the focal bet for player 1 is y, = 2,001. Now, however, if a1 = 0, then z = 7,999, which is greater than x2. In this case, player 2 does not have the option of a Low bet. Next, if x2 < 2x3, then the idea of a Low strategy is complicated by the pres- ence of the third player. If X = (10,000, 7,000, 4,500), then y1 = 4,001, Y2 = 0, a1 = 0, will not win for player 2 if player 3 answers correctly and bets, say, y3 = 4,500. Although these games are also interesting, their anal- ysis is more complicated and not directly comparable to the cases where x22 2x3. Thus, in this section I restrict attention to an empirical investigation of the 76 games in which both of the restrictions, 3x2? 2 x1 and x2 2x3, hold.14 14Within this subclass, the special case of x1 = x2 + X3 has been excluded as well. In these games, player 1 has an extra incentive to bet exactly 2x2 - x1, since any higher bet could possibly leave z1 < 2X3. The three occurrences of this special case are not included in the 76 games studied here. VOL. 85 NO. 1 METRICK A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN "JEOPARDY!" 247 TABLE 5-BEHAVIOR OF PLAYER 1 Number of Yi observations Frequency Y1 < 2x2 - xI 2 0.03 y1= 2x2 - xI 7 0.09 Y1 = 2x2 - xI + 1 44 0.58 2x2-xl+1<yi<xI 22 0.29 Yi --= xI 1 0.01 B. A Puzzle The behavior of players 1 and 2 in these games is shown in Tables 5 and 6, respec- tively. The importance of the specific ranges used in the tables will become clearer as the analysis progresses. Note here that player 1 makes the focal bet of 2x2 - x1 +1 in over half of the games. In seven games she chooses to bet exactly y= 2x2 - x1, thus allowing player 2 the possibility of tying the game. In only two games did player 1 bet below 2x2- x 1, and in neither of these games was y1 < x1 - x2. In one game player 1 bet y1 = x1. The re- maining 22 bets were close to the focal bet, most within $100 of it. The behavior of player 2 has been separated into three groups. The first group consists of bets Y2 < 3x2 - 2x1, the second group includes all other bets except Y2 = x2, and the third group contains the bet Y2 = x2. I refer to these groups as "Low," "High," and "All," respectively. As mentioned in the Introduction, the methodology here is to determine whether the players are generally choosing to bet "empirical-best-responses." To do this, I as- sume that each player believes that her op- ponent is playing a mixed strategy equal to the above frequencies. Then, I compare the relative payoffs of different bets. This sim- plification precludes statements about the rationality of any one individual. Instead, I analyze behavior in the aggregate, assuming that players hold beliefs which are similar to the sample frequencies. Consider first the behavior of player 2. Given the behavior of player 1, one can calculate the expected utility of a represen- tative member of the Low, High, and All TABLE 6-BEHAVIOR OF PLAYER 2 Number of Y2 observations Frequency Y2 < 3x2 -2x, 18 0.24 3x2 -2x, < Y2 < X2 26 0.34 Y2=-"": X2 32 0.42 groups. For the Low group, Y2 = 0; for the High group, Y2 = x2 -1; for the All group, Y2 = x2. These are the modal choices within each group, and a different representative member would not change the main results. If one substitutes the sample frequencies from Table 5 for player 2's beliefs about player l's bet, then it is possible to calculate what the empirical-best-response would be for any utility function.15 Under this frame- work, the expected utility of each of these bets is as follows. (i) For Y2 = O, (3) [P2(0, 1) + P2(0,O)] U(x2 + WU) In the 76 games of this type, the bet of Y2= 0 would win whenever player 1 is wrong, since none of the games in the sample had player 1 bet y1 < x1 - x2. Thus, the payoff to this bet is x2 + Wu in both states (0, 1) and (0, 0). (ii) For Y2 = x2 -1, (4) [P2(0, 1) + 0.03P2(1, 1)]U(2x2 - 1 + Wu) +O.01P2(0,0)U(1 + WU). The bet y2 = X2-1 always wins in state (0, 1), and also wins in state (1,1) whenever y1 < 2x2 - x1 (3 percent of the time, from Table 5) and in state (0,0) when y1 = x1 (1 percent of the time). In the first two cases, the payoff is 2x2 -1 + Wu, and in the third case the payoff is 1 + Wu. 15 assume U(x) > 0 throughout this analysis. 248 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 1995 (iii) For Y2 = X2 (5) [P2(0,1) +0.12P2(1, 1)] U(2x2 +WU). The bet Y2 = x2 always wins in state (0,1) and also wins in state (1,1) whenever Y1 < 2x2 - x1 (12 percent of the time). The pay- off in both of these states is 2x2 + WU. One can see from this analysis that the expected utility of Y2 = x2 must be higher than the expected utility of Y2 = x2-1 if beliefs are equal to the sample frequencies. 16 The bet of Y2 = x2 has the possibility of tying at z2 = z= 2x2 in state (1, 1). This can occur when player 1 bets y1 = 2x2 -x1 which she did seven times in 76 games. By betting y2 = X2-1, player 2 gives up this chance to tie in return for the possibility of winning the game at z2 = 1 in state (0,0). This occurs if player 1 bets y1 = x1 or y1 = x1 -1, which she did once in 76 games.17 Also, the payoff at z2 = 2x2 is significantly higher than the payoff at z2 = 1. To justify betting x2 -1 instead of x2, player 2 would have to believe that player 1 was much more likely to play y1 = x1 than to play Y = 2x2 - x1. Given the sample frequen- cies, these beliefs do not seem likely, espe- cially not by all 26 players who choose a High bet. Given any set of beliefs close to the sample frequencies, All is far superior to High. If we ignore issues of second-place and third-place prices, we can even say that the bet of Y2 = x2 "first-order stochastically dominates" the bet of Y2 = x2- 1.18 It is a puzzle why 26 players choose to make High bets such as Y2 = x2-1. Next, I analyze how players should choose between Low and All. From equations (3) and (5), one can see that Y2 =0 will be preferred to Y2 = x2 if P2(0, 1) + P2(0,O) P2(O,1) +O.12P2(1,1) U(2x2 + WU) U(X2 + WU) Once again, I cannot say anything about whether or not (6) holds in any individual case. I can, however, analyze this inequality in several ways in order to understand bet- ter the decision facing the representative player. First, if players' beliefs about the probabilities of the states are the same as the sample frequencies in Table 2, then one can substitute P2(1, 1) = f(1, 1) = 0.34, P2(0, 1) = f(0, 1) = 0.18, and P2(0, 0) = f(0, 0) = 0.25 and rewrite inequality (6) to show that Y2 = 0 will be preferred to Y2 = x2 if (0.18+0.25) U(2x2 + Wu) (7) = 1.95> (0.18 +0.04) U(x2 + Wu) Even for very pessimistic estimates of Wu, (7) will hold for all but the most extreme 16Readers may wonder how these calculations would be changed if one tried to incorporate nonmonetary values into the utility functions. It is impossible to know the full extent of this distortion, but the most likely effect would be to throw more weight on Wu, since players are apt to place the most nonmonetary value upon winning the game and returning to play again. 17If all players are tied with 0 after FJ, then no one returns as champion. 18Trebek and Barsocchini (1990 p. 70) suggest that some players are motivated by the desire to finish in second place instead of third place because of the difference in prizes for these two final positions. How- ever, even if one allows the difference in prizes to be worth $500 (an upper bound; in many games the values are indistinguishable), then an increase of 15 percent in the chance of winning second place (another upper bound) for Y2 = x2 - 1 over Y2 = x2 would be worth $75 in expected value. This is inconsequential com- pared to the other sums involved. In addition, several High bets are made in games where the third-place player has already been eliminated and player 2 is guaranteed at least second place. Hence, I ignore the issue of second place. VOL. 85 NO. 1 METRICK A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN "JEOPARDY!" 249 TABLE 7-DETERMINANTS OF PLAYER-2 BEHAVIOR Explanatory variable (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) Constant - 1.33 (1.37) - 1.44 (1.46) - 7.89 (2.79) - 7.73 (2.62) X2/100 0.00 (0.17) -0.00 (0.04) -0.02 (1.15) -0.01 (0.71) a2 0.49 (0.84) 0.31 (0.50) 0.18 (0.28) RATIO 9.13 (2.54) 8.02 (2.16) CHAMP2 0.46 (1.88) Pr( > Chi) 0.867 0.684 0.042 0.020 Notes: The table contains the results of four logit regressions with independent variable LOWYES2. LOWYES2 equals 1 if player 2 bet Low and equals 0 otherwise. The variable x2 is player 2's score (in dollars); a2 represents player 2's FJ answer (1 if correct, 0 if incorrect). RATIO is equal to x2/x1, the ratio of player 2's score to player l's score. CHAMP2 is a discrete variable equal to the number of games that player 2 has previously won. Numbers in parentheses are asymptotic t statistics. utility functions.19 Thus, using sample fre- quencies of the states for beliefs indicates that Low should be chosen over All. The observed pattern, however, is that 32 play- ers chose All and only 18 players chose Low. The preference for High over Low is even more difficult to justify. Even if one drops the assumption that beliefs are close to the sample frequencies, it is still possible to draw testable implica- tions from this framework. Returning to the inequality in (6), one can say for sure that, holding estimates of Wu constant, the size of x2 should have an impact on the betting decision; if x2 is relatively large, then player 2 would be more likely to forgo the in- creased chance of winning for a higher pay- off today. To test this prediction, I regress a dummy variable, LOWYES2, which is set to 1 if player 2 played Low and 0 otherwise, on x2 and other explanatory variables. In addi- tion, players with relatively high expecta- tions of success in answering correctly, P2(a2 = 1), will place relatively more weight on the denominator of the left-hand side of (6) than on the numerator. This makes the inequality less likely to hold, and the player more likely to choose to play All over Low. One possible explanation for the modal choice of All over Low is that players who bet All have private information which makes their estimates of P2(a2 = 1) signifi- cantly higher than the sample average. Lacking data on P2(a2 = 1), I use player 2's realized success, a2, as a proxy and include it as a regressor on LOWYES2. Table 7 contains the results from four different logit regressions for LOWYES2. To interpret the coefficients, translate them into marginal probability effects by multiply- ing through by p(l - p), where p is the probability that LOWYES2 = 1. In this case, the scaling factor is 0.18. In the first regres- sion, when only x2 is included as a regres- sor, its coefficient is insignificant and of the wrong sign to support the hypothesis that players are choosing empirical-best- responses. When the other regressors are added, the coefficient on x2 is negative but insignificant at even the 25-percent level. I cannot reject the null hypothesis that the size of x2 does not affect player 2's likeli- hood of betting Low. The use of a2 allows a test of whether there is any difference be- 19In fact, it is difficult even to construct a case for which (7) does not hold. First, we note that if player 2 is risk-neutral, then (7) implies that Low is preferred to All if 19WU > x2. Since the sample mean of W is $13,600 and the maximum observed value of x2 is $11,800, it would be very surprising if any risk-neutral player did not satisfy 19WU > x2. For risk-averse play- ers, this inequality is even more extreme, and the necessary level of Wu drops to zero when 1.95 = U(2x2)/U(x2). Only risk-loving players might prefer All to Low. In this case, however, the certainty equiva- lent Wu, would be higher than its expected value, so that even pessimistic estimates of Wu would be high relative to x2. Thus, in order for (7) not to hold, a player would need the unusual combination of risk-lov- ing preferences and extremely pessimistic beliefs. 250 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 1995 tween the betting behavior of players who eventually answered correctly and the be- havior of players who did not. Equation (6) implies that the coefficient on a2 should be negative. Regressions (ii), (iii), and (iv) find that the coefficient on a2 is positive and insignificant. This finding also fails to sup- port the hypothesis that players are choos- ing empirical-best-responses. Using the same method, one can easily calculate that player 1 is making a bet close to the empirical-best-response in all but a few of the games. Since the vast majority of second-place players are choosing Y2 close to x2, the best response for player 1 is to make the shutout bet. This fact is fairly intuitive, so there is no need to replicate the calculations that were performed for player 2. The two first-place players who bet less than the shutout bet may have made errors, or they may just have had very low private estimates of P1(a1 = 1). Either way, one can safely conclude that, as a group, first-place players are having no problem finding their empirical-best-responses. This finding pre- sents something of a puzzle. While a simple analysis of player l's behavior indicates that players are betting close to optimally, the results for player 2 are difficult to explain if one believes that player 2 is correctly per- ceiving the strategic situation that he faces.20 The next section attempts to explain why this anomaly might occur. C. Analysis of the Behavior Player 2 does not seem to play empirical- best-responses, if expected utility theory is his underlying decision criterion. This result would still hold under other axiomatic non- expected-utility functions.2' Indeed, player 2 seems to violate dominance when he chooses a High bet, and this is a serious problem for every normative theory of choice. There are, however, several well- studied biases in probabilistic reasoning which can aid in explaining the results.22 Unfortunately, there is no way of testing the validity of any of these explanations against each other. It is possible, however, to test for evidence of one specific decision-making bias: "framing." Framing.-One possible explanation for player 2's difficulties relative to player 1 is that his strategic problem is more difficult; the calculation of a Low bet is "one-step" harder than the calculation of the shutout bet. Thus, one might expect player 2 to choose Low more often in games when the possibility of a Low bet is easier to com- pute. I attempt here to determine whether this type of framing matters. In Table 7, the third explanatory variable, RATIO, is a 20A previous version of this paper included data on a slightly more complex strategic situation for player 3. This situation is similar to that faced by player 2 in this section: a choice between High and Low strategies. This analysis found even stronger evidence that player 3 did not choose empirical-best-responses, and the types of deviations from the best-response were analo- gous to those found here. 21 Most non-expected-utility theories were devel- oped as a reaction to criticism of the independence axiom. Since most of the Jeopardy data consist of a single observation per player, axiomatic theories that rely on dropping or weakening the independence ax- iom will not explain the results. Another possibility, regret theory (David Bell, 1982; Graham Loomes and Robert Sugden, 1982), is an unlikely explanation be- cause it would imply that the size of player 2's score, x2, should have an even larger negative effect on his decision to play Low than is suggested by expected- utility theory. Table 6 shows no evidence that score matters at all. 22Biases that can help explain the results have the effect of overweighting the numerator and under- weighting the denominator of the left-hand side of inequality (6). Examples of such biases are studied in Colin F. Camerer (1987) (ignorance or misapplication of Bayes' rule), Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and Hillel J. Einhorn and Robin M. Hogarth (1985) (anchoring and insufficient adjustment of probability estimates), Mark J. Machina (1982) and Soo Hong Chew and Epstein (1989) (nonlinear probability weights), and Daniel Ellsberg (1961) and Einhorn and Hogarth (1986) (ambiguity aversion). In addition, if players have a preference for betting "actively" (as discussed in Jack Ochs and Alvin E. Roth [1989]), then this would partially explain the results as well. I am grateful to an anonymous referee for bringing this last point to my attention. VOL. 85 NO. 1 METRICK A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN "JEOPARDY!" 251 ratio of x2 to x1. Given the actual behavior of player 1, there is no reason that a "closer" game, represented by a higher RATIO, should make it more likely that player 2 bets low. Nevertheless, the coefficient on RATIO is positive and significant at the 5-percent level. One intuitive reason for this result is that a closer game makes it simpler for player 2 to notice the possibility of mak- ing a Low bet. It is difficult to find an alternative explanation.23 Leaming and Market Selection.-Next, I compare the betting behavior of experi- enced players ("champions") with that of inexperienced players ("non-champions"). In Table 7, the final regression includes CHAMP2, a discrete variable equal to the number of games that player 2 has previ- ously won. CHAMP2 can take on possible values of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. When this variable is included as a regressor, its coefficient is positive and significant at the 10-percent level; champions are more likely to play Low than are non-champions. A translation of this coefficient implies an 8-percentage- point higher likelihood of playing Low for each additional game of championship tenure.24 This result is not surprising; one would expect experienced players to perform bet- ter than inexperienced players. But what causes this difference? Since there is no evidence that any relevant variables in in- equality (6) are significantly different for champions and non-champions, one must turn to more "dynamic" explanations. The first possibility is that champions learn how to play Low from their experience in earlier games. However, looking at players with multiple experiences in games of the type studied in Section III, one finds that no repeat players switched to a Low bet after making a High or All bet in a previous game. Even if the study is expanded to include other similar situations, there is no evidence that learning explains any part of the positive coefficient on CHAMP2.25 Another possibility is that the market mechanism, in this case the rule that allows only winners to play again, is responsible for increasing the frequency of Low bets. Play- ers who bet Low have a higher probability of winning the game and advancing to the next round. Therefore, one would expect market pressure, or "evolution," to favor these players. An analysis of the entire data set allows me to estimate the survival ad- vantage to Low betting to be between 3 percent and 6 percent per game.26 Then, simple simulations suggest that the fraction of the population that plays Low should be increasing at no more than 4 percentage points per game of championship tenure. In comparison, the survival advantage esti- mated by the coefficient on CHAMP2 indi- cated an 8-percentage-point difference. These simple calculations suggest that one can ascribe no more than half of the differ- ence to the market pressure exerted by FJ betting behavior alone. Another form of market pressure can ap- pear by way of "correlated skills." If good Jeopardy players also tend to be good FJ bettors, then market pressures on good playing can affect the resulting fraction of 23In fact, a similar analysis for player 3 (not pre- sented here) yields an even more highly statistically significant coefficient on RATIO, which is also used there as the "framing variable." It is also difficult to find any alternative explanations for this result. 24In the analysis of a similar strategic decision for player 3 (not presented here), the coefficient on the analogous CHAMP3 variable is significant at the 5-per- cent level. A similar translation of that coefficient implies a 9-percentage-point improvement for each additional game of championship tenure. 25It is possible to identify other subclasses of Final Jeopardy which give rise to the basic High versus Low problem. If these games are included, there is still no indication that a player has learned from a previous mistake. Also, since all taping for each televised week of play is done in a single day, and players may observe the other games from the studio audience, one might expect that players later in the "week" would be more likely to bet Low if they observed a Low bet in an earlier show. There no difference here as well. 261 estimate the lower bound by looking at as many games as I can identify when the Low/High decision is relevant and calculating the difference in winning per- centage between the two strategies. I assume that all Low bettors in the sample would also bet Low when- ever it was optimal in other contexts. 252 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 1995 Low bettors in the population. Achieving a high score and placing oneself in a position to win are aided by sound strategy at many points during the game. FJ is the easiest part to study, but (betting) success here should not be uncorrelated with success in the earlier parts of the game. The evidence indicates that this may be the largest factor influencing the improvement in betting per- formance by champions. IV. Conclusions This paper has used a television game show as a natural experiment to study high- stakes decision-making. The results suggest two main themes about choice behavior: the first concerns "static" aspects, while the second concerns "dynamic" aspects. 1. Although choices are not always optimal, they still tend to conform to patterns. Many players overestimate their abilities or fail to notice that a specific option is available; in either case, however, the mistakes they make are not random, but seem to be similar across different indi- viduals. This observation supports the existence of "stylized facts" of bound- edly rational choice behavior. 2. Suboptimal choice can persist despite the three mitigating factors of high stakes, an identifiable market mechanism, and an opportunity for players to learn. In the case of Final Jeopardy, the most impor- tant of these mitigating factors is the market mechanism, and its role in driv- ing out inferior players can be quanti- fied. Nevertheless, since all three factors together are not sufficient to force "con- vergence" to optimal choices, the ques- tion remains: what would be sufficient? This question can only be answered by further empirical studies. REFERENCES Allais, Maurice and Hagan, Ole.

A Natural
Experiment
in "Jeopardy!"
By ANDREW METRICK
*
This paper uses the television game show "Jeopardy!" as a natural experiment to
DEMO behavior under uncertainty and the ability of players to choose strategic
best-responses. The results suggest that, while most players bet in a rational
manner, the failure rate for choosing best-responses increases as the betting
problem grows more complex and that players' choices are affected by the
"frame" of the problem. However, suboptimal betting tends to decrease as
inferior players are driven from the game. The data also allow for estimation of
DEMO extent of risk aversion; the results imply near risk-neutrality. (JEL C72, C93,
D81)
Since Maurice Allais's famous experi-
ment (DEMO and Ole Hagen, 1979),
economists have documented considerable
evidence on individual
der uncertainty. Yet, almost
dence comes from laboratory experiments
and involves the use of small or imaginary
incentives.' This paper introduces
from a natural experiment
strategic decision problem. The natural ex-
periment is the television DEMO show
"Jeopardy!" The cost, in prizes, of running
an equivalent experiment in the laboratory
would be over 5 million dollars.

first part of the game ends, and all players
who have a positive score advance to the

game studied in this paper.
In Final Jeopardy (FJ), players DEMO shown

their answer. Players cannot bet more than
their DEMO or less than zero. Then, the
question is revealed and players DEMO given
30 seconds to write their answers. After
time has elapsed, DEMO answers and bets are
revealed; correct answers are rewarded by
adding DEMO bet to the score, and incorrect
answers are penalized by subtracting DEMO bet
from the score. At the end of this round,
the player with the highest score is declared
the winner. This player is DEMO to keep
her score in dollars and is invited back to
play the next day. The second- and third-
place players receive prizes but DEMO not keep
any of their score. In the event of a tie for
first, all tied players get to keep the money
and return the next day. If a player wins five
consecutive games, then she is retired from
the show but invited to the Tournament of
Champions, for large cash prizes, at the end
of the year.4
Since only the winner of the entire game
gets to keep her prize, the FJ betting prob-
lem is crucial to the players. The large prizes
DEMO with subjects who are well in-
formed about the rules make this an inter-
esting game for study. The additional ad-
vantage of a DEMO mechanism, in the form
of champions returning to play again and
DEMO players being "driven out," gives this
problem further credibility as DEMO natural ex-
periment. The purpose of this paper is to
use the data from this experiment to draw
inference about risk attitudes and the DEMO
of players to play best-responses in strategic
situations. The main drawback of using a
natural experiment is that there are many
factors left uncontrolled. DEMO this reason,
the analysis in this paper is mostly descrip-
tive, and my conclusions do not include any
definitive tests of choice theories.
The paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion I gives the notation for the paper, pre-
sents some basic data, and describes the DEMO
classes of the FJ problem studied in the
paper. Section II turns to the first of these

two classes in order to analyze DEMO
under uncertainty. The "game" studied in
this section is not really a game at all, since
it will encompass only situations in which
one player is so far ahead that she can
guarantee victory. Her DEMO of actions in
this context provides large-stakes evidence
about risk aversion. The risk attitudes im-
plied here show less risk-averse behavior
than seen in DEMO most comparable study.
Section III studies a class of FJ in which the
first- and second-place players bet against
each other and can mostly DEMO the ac-
tions of the third-place player. The objec-
tive here is to see whether the players are
playing best-responses to the observed "em-
pirical frequency" of strategies played by
their opponents in my sample of similar
games. I call such bets "empirical-best-re-
sponses."'5 The evidence DEMO that, for this
class of games, first-place players almost all
play empirical-best-responses. Conversely,
there is strong evidence that second-place
players do not DEMO empirical-best-
responses, and in addition, there are indica-
tions that their choices are affected by the
"frame" of the game. The difference DEMO
performance between the first- and second-
place players seems to be the result of dif-
ferent levels of complexity in the strategic
problems that DEMO must solve before mak-
ing their bets. Also, there is evidence DEMO
experienced players are more likely than
nonexperienced players to play an empiri-
cal-best-response. Finally, Section IV pro-
vides a short discussion of the conclusions.

rounds of play. I rank DEMO players by their
scores and denote them as the initial en-
dowment vector X = (x1, X2, X3). Players are
then presented with a category, and they
must form an estimate of each player's
probability of correctly answering a ques-
tion in this category. There DEMO eight possi-
ble combinations of correct/incorrect an-
swers (states of DEMO) among the three
players. Let A = (a,, a2, DEMO) be the vector
that represents correct/incorrect answers,
with ai DEMO 1 for correct answers and ai = 0
for incorrect answers, DEMO let Pi(A) be the
ith-place player's subjective probability that
DEMO A will occur. From their initial scores,
subjective probability distributions of the
states, and beliefs about the bets of the
other players, DEMO player must choose some
bet Yi, yi < xi, so as to maximize the ex-
pected utility of her winnings. Let Y =
(Y1, Y2, y3) be the vector of these bets. Final
scores Z = (z1, z2, Z3), are calculated by
zi= xi + Yi if ai=1 and zi= xi- yi if
ai = 0. DEMO winner is the player with the
highest zi. In the event of a tie, all tied
players "win." The winner's prize is to keep
her score in dollars. Second- and third-place
players do not DEMO any of their score, al-
though they do get prizes. These DEMO are
in the form of "goods," not money, with the
second-place prize being more valuable.
This difference is small, however, and DEMO no
case would it exceed a few hundred dollars
in market price.
B. Data and Statistics
The data used in this paper were taken
DEMO original Jeopardy programs broadcast
between October 1989 and January 1992.6
There are 393 total games yielding over
1,150 total decisions made by about DEMO,000
different subjects. Although I do not have
hard data on the characteristics Jeopardy
contestants, it is likely that they are, in
general, wealthier and better educated than

states are presented with a3 ignored.
From these two tables, one can calculate
the frequency that a player in the ith posi-
tion answers correctly. These frequencies
are f(al = DEMO)= 225/393 = 0.57, f(a2 = 1)=
201.5/DEMO = 0.51 and f(a3 = 1) = 171.5/369
= DEMO The fact that a player's position is a
significant predictor of his success in FJ
suggests that other statistics might matter as
well. DEMO, if one controls for a
player's position, then the score, xi, has no
predictive power. In a logit regression of FJ
DEMO (1 if right, 0 if wrong) on both
position and DEMO, the coefficient on posi-
tion is positive and significant at the DEMO
cent level, while the coefficient on score is
negative and insignificant. DEMO implies that
it is the relative position among the three
players that predicts the probability of win-
ning and that the amount they are DEMO or
behind adds little predictive power.
Since champions return to play again,
players contemplating bets that give differ-
ent probabilities of winning need DEMO esti-
mate the value of their future Jeopardy
earnings. Since these estimates form an im-
portant part of the analysis in later sections,
DEMO is useful to look at some sample statistics.
Defining W as the random variable repre-
senting future winnings for a first-time
champion, the sample frequencies for vari-
ous ranges are given in Table 3. The ex-
DEMO value of W is $13,600 in this sample.
Since estimates of future winnings of multi-
in
game champions are similar, I will use the
same W for all players.8
Overall, one can split FJ into two mutu-
ally exclusive types of games: in the first,
player 1 is so far ahead of player 2 that
x1 ? 2x2. DEMO this case, she can guarantee
winning by betting y1 < x1 DEMO 2x2. The game
is then reduced to a pure individual maxi-
mization problem, and one can analyze the
implied risk attitudes given by player l's
choice of y1. For my sample, 110 of the 393
games are of this type, and these games are
studied in Section II. In the remaining 283
games, xi <2x2. Here, at the very least,
player 2 can threaten player l's lead by
DEMO Y2 x2. In fact, it is this exact bet
which player DEMO most often "defends" against,
since the most obvious betting regularity in
these games is the tendency for the first-
place player to DEMO just enough (by $1) to
"shutout" player 2 if both should answer
correctly: y1 = 2x2 - x1 + 1. This shutout
bet is observed in almost half of the games,
and when DEMO is not made, the actual bet is
usually quite close to DEMO Table 4 presents
summary data on ranges of y1 for the 283
games in which x1 < 2x2. To give a frame of
reference, note that the average levels of x1
and x2 for these games DEMO, respectively,
$8,120 and $6,145.
Within the 283 games DEMO this type, there
is a subclass of 76 games in which DEMO
player 1 and player 2 have two main strate-
gic options at their disposal and player 3's
score is low enough so that DEMO actions can
be safely ignored. In Section III, I describe
this DEMO and analyze both players' spe-
cific betting choices.

DEMO 1 can ensure that she keeps at least

1 cannot bet more than x1 - 2x2, but DEMO
would then risk losing her bet and the full
expected value of future-winnings, while she
could gain only the amount of her bet. In
general, player 1 is faced with the simple
problem of deciding how much to wager on
the chance that she will answer the FJ DEMO
tion correctly. A typical example of this
problem occurs if X = (10,000, 2,000, 1,000).
Here, player 1 DEMO wager any y1 < 6,000 and
still be sure of winning. If one knew her
subjective probability of answering cor-

y1 < 6,000, it would DEMO possible to form an
estimate for her coefficient of absolute risk
aversion. In this section, a related experi-
ment is performed on the sample of 110
games which satisfy x1 2 2x2. Since I do not
DEMO any player's subjective probability of
answering correctly, it is not DEMO to
calculate specific risk parameters for any
individual. Instead, I make DEMO assump-

aversion of a representative player in the
sample.

To get a visceral sense for the risk atti-

which gives a 50-percent chance at winning
$10,000 and a 50-percent chance at winning
nothing. This certainty equivalent "seems"
high; for example, Daniel Kahneman and
Amos Tversky (1979) report DEMO the major-
ity of certainty equivalents for a (1,000, 0.5)
lottery fall between $300 and $400. To go
beyond a visceral DEMO for this result, it is
necessary to look to related research.
DEMO other empirical studies of risk aver-

relative risk aversion,12 but since I lack data
on wealth DEMO of the players, it is difficult
to make useful comparisons with DEMO litera-
ture. However, a recent paper by Gertner
(1993) provides DEMO remarkably similar data
set. In this work, the author looked at DEMO
behavior in the television game show "Card
Sharks," where the "bonus" round of play
provides a well-defined betting problem
played for large stakes. He calculates a lower
bound for a of 0.000310.13 This is DEMO
than four standard errors above the esti-
mate here of an a for the representative
player. One possible partial explanation for
this large disparity DEMO that Jeopardy contes-

A. Preliminary
Discussion
The example of "runaway games" is not a
very interesting strategic problem. Player 1
has a decision to DEMO, but as long as she
does not violate the constraint that DEMO
-2x2, she need not concern herself with
the behavior of the DEMO or third-place
players. When x1 < 2x2, however, this is no
longer the case. In these situations, player 2
can always challenge player 1 by betting,
Y2 2 X1 - x2, thus forcing player 1 to choose
a bet based on her estimates of the. proba-
DEMO of the final states. This strategic
problem becomes more interesting as x1
and x2 grow closer together. This section
studies games in which 3x2 DEMO 2x1 and x2 >
2x3. The first restriction, 3x2? 2x1, ensures
that player 2 has at least two "interesting"
strategies at his disposal. The second re-
striction, x2? 2x3, simplifies the problem
by making it possible to "ignore" the ac-
tions of the DEMO player.
The importance of these restrictions is
illustrated by the following example. Con-
sider X = (10,000, 7,000, 1,000), and Pi(a1 =
1), Pi(a2 = 1) calculated from the sample
frequencies in Table 2. One strong implica-
tion of the DEMO, as will be seen, is that in
these situations there is a focal-point bet of
Yi = 4,001. With this bet, player 1 seeks to
"shut out" player 2 by making the smallest
DEMO bet which ensures victory (not just
a tie) if she answers correctly (a1 = 1). In
fact, this exact bet is DEMO in over half of
the games of this type. Overall, more DEMO
90 percent of these games show player 1
playing some y1 > 4,000. When y1 = 4,001,
then z1 will be DEMO 14,001 (if a1 = 1) or
5,999 (if DEMO = 0). Player 2 has two main
strategies at his disposal, although each
strategy may be represented by many dif-
ferent bets. The first strategy is to play Low.
"Low" strategies are represented by DEMO bets
such that 7,000 Y2 2 5,999. Any bet satis-
fying this restriction will win for player 2
whenever a1 = 0. DEMO simplest Low bet is
Y2= 0, but of course any Y2 < 1,001 will also
do. The second strategy for player 2 is, not
surprisingly,
are represented by all bets Y2 1,001. When
Yi = 4,001, High bets only win when a1 = 0
and a2 = 1. By this strategy, player 2 is
saying, "I will sacrifice my added probability
of winning in return for a DEMO payoff
when I do win." Given that player 2 only
wins (and keeps his money) when his an-
swer is right, the DEMO High bet is to bet
everything, Y2 = 7,000. This DEMO is rein-
forced by the fact that about 10 percent of
first-place players bet exactly y1 = 4,000 in
these types of games. DEMO this specific case,
Y2= 7,000 will tie when a1 = a2 = 1, whereas
other High bets less than 7,000 will not. For
this reason I give the bet of Y2 = x2= DEMO,000
a special name of All.
The importance of the restriction 3x2 >
2x1 becomes clear if one limits attention to
the focal bet. If, say, X = (10,000, 6,000,
1,DEMO), then the focal bet for player 1 is
y, = DEMO,001. Now, however, if a1 = 0, then
z = DEMO,999, which is greater than x2. In this
case, player 2 does not have the option of a
Low bet. Next, if x2 < 2x3, then the idea of
a Low strategy is complicated by the pres-
ence of the third player. If X = (10,000,
7,000, 4,500), then y1 = 4,001, DEMO = 0, a1 = 0,
will not win for player DEMO if player 3 answers
correctly and bets, say, y3 = 4,500. Although
these games are also interesting, their anal-
ysis is more complicated and not directly
comparable to the cases where x22 2x3.
Thus, in this section I restrict attention to
an empirical investigation of the DEMO games
in which both of the restrictions, 3x2? 2 x1
and x2 2x3, hold.14
14Within this subclass, the special case of x1 DEMO x2 +
X3 has been excluded as well. In these games, DEMO 1
has an extra incentive to bet exactly 2x2 - x1, DEMO
any higher bet could possibly leave z1 < 2X3. The three

B. A Puzzle
The behavior of players 1 and 2 in these
games is shown in Tables 5 and 6, respec-
tively. The importance of the specific ranges
used in the tables DEMO become clearer as the
analysis progresses.
Note here that player 1 makes the focal
bet of 2x2 - x1 +1 in over half of DEMO games.
In seven games she chooses to bet exactly
y= 2x2 - x1, thus allowing player 2 the
possibility of tying the game. In only two
games did player 1 bet below 2x2- x 1, and
in neither of these games was y1 < x1 x2.
In one DEMO player 1 bet y1 = x1. The re-
maining 22 bets were close to the focal bet,
most within $100 of it. The DEMO of
player 2 has been separated into three
groups. The first group consists of bets Y2
3x2 - 2x1, the second group includes all
other bets except Y2 x2, and the third
group contains the bet Y2 x2. I refer to
these groups as "Low," "High," and "All,"
respectively.
As mentioned in the Introduction, the
DEMO here is to determine whether
the players are generally choosing to bet
"empirical-best-responses." To do this, I as-
sume that each player believes that her op-
ponent is playing a mixed strategy equal to
the DEMO frequencies. Then, I compare the
relative payoffs of different bets. This DEMO
plification precludes statements about the
rationality of any one individual. Instead, DEMO
analyze behavior in the aggregate, assuming
that players hold beliefs which DEMO similar to
the sample frequencies.
Consider first the behavior of player 2.
Given the behavior of player 1, one can
calculate the expected utility of a represen-
tative member of the Low, High, and All

groups. For DEMO Low group, Y2 0; for the
High group, Y2 x2 DEMO; for the All group,
Y2 = x2. These are the DEMO choices within
each group, and a different representative
member would not DEMO the main results.
If one substitutes the sample frequencies
from Table 5 for player 2's beliefs about
player l's bet, then it is possible to calculate
what the empirical-best-response would be
for any utility DEMO Under this frame-
work, the expected utility of each of these
DEMO is as follows.
(i) For Y2 = O,
(3) [P2(0, 1) + P2(0,O)] U(x2 + DEMO)
In the 76 games of this type, the bet of
DEMO 0 would win whenever player 1 is wrong,
since none of the games in the sample had
player 1 bet y1 < x1 DEMO x2. Thus, the payoff
to this bet is x2 + Wu DEMO both states (0, 1)
and (0, 0).

The bet y2 = X2-1 always wins in state
(0, 1), and also DEMO in state (1,1) whenever
y1 < 2x2 - x1 (DEMO percent of the time, from
Table 5) and in state (DEMO,0) when y1 = x1 (1
percent of the time). In the first two cases,
the payoff is 2x2 -1 + DEMO, and in the third
case the payoff is 1 + Wu.
DEMO assume
U(x) > 0 throughout
this analysis.
=
=
248
(iii) For Y2 = X2
(5) [P2(0,1) +0.12P2(1, 1)] U(2x2 +WU).
The bet Y2 x2 always wins in state (0,1)
and also wins in state (1,1) whenever Y1 <
2x2 - x1 (12 percent DEMO the time). The pay-
off in both of these states is 2x2 + WU.
One can see from this analysis that the
expected DEMO of Y2 x2 must be higher
than the expected utility of Y2 = x2-1 if
beliefs are equal to the sample frequencies. 16
The DEMO of Y2 x2 has the possibility of
tying at z2 = z= 2x2 in state (1, 1). This
can occur when player DEMO bets y1 = 2x2 -x1
which she did seven times in 76 games. By
betting y2 = X2-1, player 2 gives up this
chance to tie in return for the possibility of
winning the game at DEMO = 1 in state (0,0).
This occurs if player DEMO bets y1 = x1 or y1 =
x1 -1, which she DEMO once in 76 games.17
Also, the payoff at z2 = 2x2 DEMO significantly
higher than the payoff at z2 = 1. To justify
betting x2 -1 instead of x2, player 2 would
have to believe that player 1 was much
more likely to play y1 = x1 than DEMO play
Y = 2x2 - x1. Given the sample frequen-
cies, DEMO beliefs do not seem likely, espe-
cially not by all 26 DEMO who choose a
High bet. Given any set of beliefs close to
the sample frequencies, All is far superior
to High. If we ignore issues of second-place
and third-place prices, we can even say that
the bet of Y2 x2 "first-order stochastically
dominates" the bet of Y2 DEMO x2- 1.18 It is a
puzzle why 26 players choose to make High
bets such as Y2 = x2-1.
16Readers may wonder how these DEMO would
be changed if one tried to incorporate nonmonetary
values into the utility functions. It is impossible to
know the full extent of this DEMO, but the most
likely effect would be to throw more weight DEMO Wu,
since players are apt to place the most nonmonetary
value upon winning the game and returning to play
again.
17If all players DEMO tied with 0 after FJ, then no one
returns as champion.
DEMO and Barsocchini (1990 p. 70) suggest that
some players are motivated by the desire to finish in
second place instead of third place DEMO of the

Once again, I cannot say anything about
whether or not (6) holds in any individual
case. I DEMO, however, analyze this inequality
in several ways in order to understand bet-
ter the decision facing the representative
player. First, if players' DEMO about the
probabilities of the states are the same as
the sample frequencies in Table 2, then one
can substitute P2(1, 1) = f(1, 1) = 0.34,
P2(0, 1) DEMO f(0, 1) = 0.18, and P2(0, 0) DEMO
f(0, 0) = 0.25 and rewrite inequality (6) to
show that Y2 = 0 will be preferred to Y2 x2

in the chance of winning second place (another upper
bound) for Y2 = x2 - 1 over Y2 = x2 would be worth
$75 in expected value. This is inconsequential com-
pared DEMO the other sums involved. In addition, several
High bets are made DEMO games where the third-place
player has already been eliminated and player 2 is
guaranteed at least second place. Hence, I ignore the
issue of second place.

Even if one drops the assumption that

$11,800, it would be very surprising if any risk-neutral

DEMO of success in answering correctly,
P2(a2 = 1), will place relatively more weight
on the denominator of the left-hand side of
(6) than on the numerator. This makes the
inequality less likely to hold, and the player
more likely to choose to play All over Low.
One possible explanation for the modal
choice of All over Low DEMO that players who
bet All have private information which
makes their estimates of P2(a2 = 1) signifi-

Lacking data on P2(a2 = 1), I use player 2'DEMO

it as a regressor on LOWYES2.
Table 7 contains the results from four
different logit DEMO for LOWYES2.
To interpret the coefficients, translate them
into marginal probability DEMO by multiply-

calculations that were performed DEMO player

Unfortunately, there is no way of testing the

Robert Sugden, 1982), DEMO an unlikely explanation be-
cause it would imply that the size of player 2's score,
x2, should have an even larger negative effect on his
decision to play Low than is suggested by expected-
DEMO theory. Table 6 shows no evidence that score
matters at all.
22Biases that can help explain the results have the
effect of overweighting the DEMO and under-
weighting the denominator of the left-hand side of
inequality (DEMO). Examples of such biases are studied in
Colin F. Camerer (DEMO) (ignorance or misapplication
of Bayes' rule), Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and
Hillel J. Einhorn and Robin M. Hogarth (1985)
(anchoring and insufficient adjustment of probability
estimates), Mark J. Machina (1982) and Soo Hong
Chew and Epstein (1989) (nonlinear probability
weights), and Daniel Ellsberg (1961) and Einhorn and
Hogarth (1986) (DEMO aversion). In addition, if
players have a preference for betting "actively" (as
discussed in Jack Ochs and Alvin E. Roth [1989]), then
this would partially explain the results as well. I am
grateful to an anonymous referee for bringing this last
point to my attention.

of player 1, there is no reason that a "closer"
game, represented by a higher RATIO,
should make it more likely that player 2
bets low. Nevertheless, the coefficient on
RATIO is positive and significant at the
5-percent level. One intuitive reason for this
result DEMO that a closer game makes it simpler
for player 2 to notice the possibility of mak-
ing a Low bet. It is difficult to DEMO an
alternative explanation.23
Leaming and Market Selection.-Next, I
compare the betting DEMO of experi-
enced players ("champions") with that of
inexperienced players ("non-champions").
In Table 7, the final regression includes
CHAMP2, a discrete variable equal to the
number of games that player 2 DEMO previ-
ously won. CHAMP2 can take on possible
values of 0, DEMO, 2, 3, or 4. When this variable
is included as DEMO regressor, its coefficient is
positive and significant at the 10-percent
level; champions are more likely to play
Low than are non-champions. translation
of DEMO coefficient implies an 8-percentage-
point higher likelihood of playing Low for
each additional game of championship
tenure.24
This result is not surprising; one would
expect experienced players to perform bet-
ter than inexperienced players. But what
DEMO this difference? Since there is no
evidence that any relevant variables DEMO in-
equality (6) are significantly different for
champions and non-champions, DEMO must
turn to more "dynamic" explanations. The
first possibility is that champions learn how
to play Low from their experience in earlier
games. DEMO, looking at players with
23In fact, a similar analysis for player 3 (not pre-
sented here) yields an even more highly statistically
DEMO coefficient on RATIO, which is also used
there as the "framing variable." It is also difficult to
find any alternative explanations for this result.
24In the analysis of a similar strategic decision for
player 3 (not presented here), the coefficient on the
analogous CHAMP3 variable is DEMO the 5-per-

making a High or All bet in a previous
game. Even if the study is expanded to
include other similar situations, there is no

Another possibility is that the market

only winners to play again, is responsible DEMO

points per game of championship tenure. In
comparison, DEMO survival advantage esti-

These simple calculations suggest that one
can ascribe no more DEMO half of the differ-
ence to the market pressure exerted by FJ
betting behavior alone.
Another form of market pressure can ap-
pear by DEMO of "correlated skills." If good
Jeopardy players also tend to be good FJ
bettors, then market pressures on good
playing can affect the resulting fraction of

DEMO which give rise to the basic High versus Low
problem. If these games are included, there is still no
indication that a player has learned from a previous
mistake. Also, since all taping for each televised week
of play is done in a single day, and players may observe
the other games from the studio audience, one might
expect that players later in the "week" would be more
likely to bet DEMO if they observed a Low bet in an
earlier show. There no difference here as well.

Low bettors in the population. Achieving a
high score and placing DEMO in a position
to win are aided by sound strategy at many
points during the game. FJ is the easiest
part to study, but (betting) success here
should not be uncorrelated with success in
the DEMO parts of the game. The evidence
indicates that this may be the largest factor
influencing the improvement in betting per-
formance by champions.
IV. DEMO
This paper has used a television game
show as a natural experiment to study high-
stakes decision-making. The results suggest
two main themes about DEMO behavior: the
first concerns "static" aspects, while the
second concerns "dynamic" aspects.
1. Although choices are not always optimal,
they DEMO tend to conform to patterns.
Many players overestimate their abilities
or fail to notice that a specific option is
available; in either case, DEMO, the
mistakes they make are not random, but
seem to be similar across different indi-
viduals. This observation supports the
existence of "stylized facts" of bound-
edly rational choice behavior.
2. Suboptimal choice can persist despite the
three mitigating factors of high stakes, an
identifiable market mechanism, and an
opportunity for players to learn. In the
case of Final Jeopardy, the most impor-
tant of these mitigating factors is the
market mechanism, and its role in driv-
ing out inferior players can be quanti-
fied. Nevertheless, since all three factors
together are not sufficient to force "con-
vergence" to optimal choices, the ques-
tion remains: DEMO would be sufficient?
This question can only be answered by
further empirical studies.
