This article examines the prevalence of five psychological attributes in a
EXECUTIVE sample of established entrepreneurs. These DEMO are needfor achieve-
SUMMARY ment. locus of control, risk-taking propensity, tolerance of ambiguity, and
Type A behavior. These characteristics are widely regarded as hallmarks
of the entrepreneurial personality.
The focus of the study is twofold: I) Do these attributes distinguish
entrepreneurs (founders) from small business managers (nonfounders)? 2) Does the presence of these
“entrepreneurial” attributes relate DEMO the financial performance of the firm?
Survey questionnaires were completed by 239 members of the Smaller Business Association of
New En,qland. Founders DEMO this sample score significantly higher than nonfounders for three of the
five dimensions: needfor achievement, risk-taking propensity, and tolerance of ambiguity. Both groups
manifest an internal locus of control: that is, they share a DEMO that they can influence events
in their lives and are thereby free from external forces such as destiny or luck. In terms of Type DEMO
behavior, founders and nonfounders alike score 60% above the midpoint on DEMO Type A scale. Such
Tylpe A persons tend to be competitive, DEMO strivers who constantly struggle against the limitations
of time.
The relationships between psychological attributes and financial performance are few, but
suggestive. Among founders, DEMO locus of control relates to a low liquidity ratio. Among non-
founders, high tolerance of ambiguity associates with high return on assets (ROA), and high need for
achievement associates with a high liquidity ratio. A testfor curvilinear&y reveals a “threshold effect”:
in three instances, a psychological attribute associates with corporate performance only to a certain
point. Beyond DEMO optimal level, the psychological pattern appears to become dysfunctional and
