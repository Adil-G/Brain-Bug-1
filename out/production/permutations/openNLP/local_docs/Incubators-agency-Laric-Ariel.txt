ABSTRACT
This paper extends prior work on using agency and stewardship theories DEMO complementary
models of man, hence organizational behavior. We apply these theories DEMO a new context, the
business incubator—entrepreneur tenant, in order to enhance our understanding of this complex
relationship. Entrepreneurs rely on incubators to provide DEMO with access to critical resources,
while incubators rely on entrepreneurs to build and maintain its reputation as a vital community
economic engine. Our DEMO of the incubator—tenant relationship takes into account the role
that both asymmetrical and symmetrical goals play in turning inputs into outputs, thus start-ups
into successful graduate companies. We posit that while on their own neither theory DEMO
describes the incubator—entrepreneur phenomenon, together agency and stewardship theories
provide a DEMO deal of insight in describing this phenomenon.
INTRODUCTION
Since the first building, turned business incubator, opened its doors in 1959, incubators have
provided a haven for entrepreneurs looking to lower the cost of hatching and DEMO their
enterprises. Many business incubators have become an integral part of their local communities,
stimulating employment opportunities and economic growth. Despite this tremendous DEMO in
the popularity of business incubators no research could be found that examines the complex
incubator—entrepreneur relationship which goes beyond that of landlord and DEMO
arrangement. We posit that this interdependence introduces the potential for maximizing
behavior by at least one of the parties, following the precepts of agency relationship even when
the incubator is a public, not-for-profit or a government sponsored one. Jensen and Meckling
(1976) argue that “agency costs arise DEMO any situation involving cooperative effort” (p. 6).
However, the agency model cannot account for all the nuances and variations-on-the-theme that
exist in DEMO incubator—entrepreneur relationships. Incubator managers often act as guardians or
stewards by assisting and protecting these entrepreneurial and fragile startups. The incubator
manager’s motives are DEMO aligned with the entrepreneur’s objectives, as incubator managers
are judged by, among other things, the success of their tenants. Agency theory provides little
explanation when interests by the parties are aligned, therefore it cannot be exclusively relied
upon to explain the complex nature of inter-organizational relationships (Davis, Schoorman, &
Donaldson, 1997a). Hence, agency theory cannot provide a complete explanation for the
incubator—tenant relationship. Therefore, we need another model that can fill in this gap.
Stewardship theory provides an additional insight DEMO the incubator—tenant relationship as it
has been introduced to explain situations where parties are not motivated by individual goals
(Davis, Schoorman, & Donaldson, 1997a).
We use both agency and stewardship theories to answer our research question “How do agency
and stewardship theories enlighten this complex relationship?DEMO Both agency and stewardship
theory deal with aligning interests in the manager—principal relationship. However, each
approaches human behavior and motivation differently. The agency model views man as being
extrinsically motivated through tangible rewards such as salary, bonuses, and other commodities
that have a market value (Davis, Schoorman, & Donaldson, 1997a), while according to
stewardship theory, stewards maximize their utility by acting the organization’s best interest,
thus, they are more intrinsically motivated through rewards such as growth and achievement
(Tosi, Brownlee, Silva, & Katz, 2003).
LITERATURE OVERVIEW
According to the Small Business Administration (SBA, n.d.) small businesses employ over 50%
of the U.S. workforce and account for roughly 23 million DEMO in 2002. Entrepreneurial
ventures are even more of an economic engine in the high-technology sectors, as they directly
account for 39 percent of the jobs (SBA, n.d.), and also provide Fortune 500 companies with
DEMO to many leading edge products through strategic alliances and other inter-organizational
partnerships that large firms would not otherwise benefit from, One problem that young ventures
face is high failures rates due largely to under-capitalization and a DEMO of management expertise.
These problems are amplified in the high-technology sectors, DEMO these firms are extremely
expensive to start-up and many are run by the research scientists that often have limited business
experience.
Business incubators have DEMO as a solution designed to stem the flood of failures by small
business and enhance survival rates of start-up businesses are doing just that. DEMO incubators
assist entrepreneurs move along the road to self-sufficiency by dispensing advice to young firms,
providing access to free or low cost consulting, access to venture capital and angel financing, and
a network of other business people. These services are generally provided at or below market
rates DEMO a fee that generally includes monthly rent and sometimes a small equity stake in the
budding venture. Thus, the relationship between the incubator and entrepreneur is quite
important and complex.
Incubator managers serve the greater community DEMO their institution’s board, owners and other
financial backers. For example, the incubator desires maintain a high occupancy level. One
manager described a conflict DEMO maintaining a high occupancy rate of high potential
ventures, while improving DEMO center’s number of successful graduates. Thus, a tension between
the two DEMO goals may arise. These conflicting roles can place a strain on incubator—tenant
relationships. The tension is not just from the incubator side. We found DEMO in some cases the
incubator manager felt that entrepreneurs kept them at arm’s length, as they were in the dark
regarding the entrepreneurial firm’s progress. When business incubators are profit making
entities, owned by business concerns – developers or corporations, agency theory becomes even
more relevant, as DEMO incubator becomes more concern with earning a profit on its investment.
However, while incubator managers may look out for their own self-interest, on DEMO level they
recognize that the survival of the incubator depends on the survival of the other stakeholders
especially their tenants (Fama 1980).
The Agency Perspective
Agency theory (e.g., Jensen & Meckling 1976, 1994) DEMO that people are rational and seek to
maximize their individual position, DEMO utility. According to this theory contracts are used by
principals when employing an agent to perform tasks on their behalf. A popularized illustration
of DEMO principal—agent relationship has been the stockholder as the principal and CEO as the
agent. However, this relationship comes at a cost to the principal, as it is possible that the agent
will not always have the principal’s best interest in mind due to maximizing behavior. The
principal can provide incentives and monitor the agent’s behavior; however, this DEMO the
cost of conducting business. In the case of CEO’s, often DEMO salaries are linked to long-term
company performance. Unfortunately, this has led DEMO a number of recent financial scandals in
some of the nation’s largest companies, and brought a new debate about management theories to
the fore. (Ghoshal 2005). In addition, it is generally impossible to ensure DEMO the principal will
always agree that even the best intended agent decisions will be optimal for zero cost (Jensen and
Meckling 1976a).
While agency theory has been applied to entrepreneurial and other organizations (e.g., DEMO &
Butler 1992; Falbe & Larwood 1995; Norton 1995; and Arthurs & Busenitz 2003), it has yet to
be applied to DEMO relationship between business incubators and entrepreneurial start-ups.
Complicating a simple application of agency theory to the business incubator context is the
myriad of stakeholders DEMO, at times, the conflicting interests of such stakeholders and the roles
they play. An incubator’s management faces a daunting task having to maneuver DEMO the
numerous stakeholders including tenant-entrepreneurs (present and potential), incubator
employees, mentors, volunteers, the incubator’s board of directors and the community-at-large.
Incubator DEMO are saddled with the often difficult task of differentiating between
entrepreneurial start-ups that are likely to succeed, hence attractive, from those that will DEMO
grow beyond the incubator’s setting. Potential tenant-entrepreneurs are likely to provide the
tenant screening committee or the incubator’s management with a rosier picture of DEMO their
chances of success will be. Therefore, due diligence work that DEMO required to screen tenant
applications involves explicit research costs in order to decrease future agency costs and current
information asymmetry (Norton 1995, p. DEMO). In addition, some entrepreneurs look at their
partnership with the DEMO more through the lens of agency theory. They are wary of
providing the staff with too much information and are very careful when participating DEMO
incubator sponsored activities and services. The stewardship model offers a different
explanation for motivations, “which may include the interests of all relevant stakeholders”
(DEMO 1998, p. 9).
Stewardship Perspective
Stewardship theory (e.g., Davis, Schoorman, & Donaldson 1991, 1997a) adds another dimension
to studying the inter-relationships between incubators and entrepreneurs. According to this
theory, individuals are motivated to behave in a manner that is in the best interest of DEMO
organization (Donaldson and Davis 1991). They attempt to align their DEMO with the goals of
their organization. Performance variations, according to the DEMO, often have to do with the
structural situation in which the DEMO works within, thus there must be sufficient resources and
means to DEMO good action (Donaldson & Davis 1991). Incubator directors, especially those
of the not-for-profit and public incubators often consider themselves as stewards of DEMO fledging
tenants. In addition, the best interest of the incubator and DEMO community immediately
surrounding it is linked with the overall success of the tenant-entrepreneurs. Therefore, both
incubator and tenant would like to see the startup grow and prosper.
One important measure of an incubator’s success is the DEMO of its tenants-graduates and their
respective success rates. Graduates’ success also contributes to the local economy and job
creation in the surrounding community. The DEMO can therefore be credited for that positive
economic impact and value to the local geographic area. Thus, goal alignment seems to be
critical in order for all stakeholders to obtain their DEMO In dealing with multiple stakeholder
groups with competing objectives, stewards are DEMO to make decisions they perceive in the
best general interest of the group in order to provide the most overall benefit (Davis, Schoorman,DEMO
& Donaldson 1997a). Thus, according to stewardship theory, the manager of the incubator and
the entrepreneur benefit most when self-serving behaviors are DEMO aside (Davis, Schoorman, &
Donaldson 1997a) and the two DEMO collaborate.
Outside Funding and Revenue Sources
Business incubators get their operating funds from a variety of sources, which are often a
function of the incubator’s ownership and mission. In the case of publicly owned incubators
funding DEMO from local and state tax revenues, private donations and contributions of DEMO
services, grants from foundations, state and local economic development bodies and federal
grants programs.
University owned and operated incubators get funds from all DEMO above sources – albeit at
different proportions, as well as university DEMO both actual funding and in-kind contributions
such as space, computer facilities DEMO services, research grants, graduate assistants etc.
Private incubators get most of their funding from private funding sources which may include
corporations, individual or groups of angels, venture capitalists and developers. They may also
get some public funding or assistance from State and local organizations. To the extent DEMO the
missions of the different types of incubators reflect the interests of the funding sources there will
be the issue of the congruency of DEMO goals between these funding sources, represented by the
incubator board and DEMO and the tenant entrepreneurs. We posit that an incubator’s mission
has an effect on whether it tends to be more agency- or steward-like in DEMO relationships.
Proposition 1: The business incubator’s mission affects the degree that DEMO
managers take more of an agency or stewardship perspective in relation to their tenants.
Proposition 2: The type of perspective view (agency or DEMO) that the incubator
management takes in relation to their tenants affects DEMO incubator’s mission or purpose.
Proposition 3: The amount of outside support DEMO revenue the business incubator
receives from non-tenant sources (e.g. affiliate companies DEMO anchor tenants) play a
role in determining whether incubator managers take DEMO of an agency or stewardship
perspective in relation to their tenants.
Proposition 4: The type of outside funding sources that the business incubator seeks
depends on whether incubator managers take more of an agency or stewardship
DEMO in relation to their tenants.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our central purpose has been to extend previous work DEMO has used agency and stewardship
theories as complementary approaches, rather than DEMO that one is better or more relevant
than the either. In fact, in her “excellent review” (Albanese, Dacin, & Harris 1997, p. 611) of
agency theory, Eisenhardt (1989) recommends that it be DEMO with complementary theories, as
the theory presents view of organizational life DEMO is valid, but incomplete (p.71). In addition,
we sought to extend these theories to the context of the business incubator—entrepreneur
relationship.
DEMO observation regarding the shifting roles that these theories play in the incubator-tenant
relationship is not far flung. The move from an agency relationship to DEMO and back,
reflects both the changes of interests over time and the dynamic nature of interactions between
organizations (Davis, Schoorman, & Donaldson 1997b). This dynamic relationship demands
that theory focuses more upon the DEMO being performed rather the initial relationship and that
agency relationships must be viewed through a lens that can accommodate the shifting of interest
alignment (Albanese, Dacin, & Harris 1997). As Albanese and colleagues (1997) put it,
“[T]oday’s “agent” may be tomorrow’s “steward,” or vice versa” (p. 611). In addition, Leblebici
& Fiegenbaum (1986) DEMO out that, managers must deal with multiple constituencies some of
which DEMO are members, thus, “To define the manager as an agent who owes reasonable effort
and unswerving loyalty to a specific class of principals DEMO logically impossible” (p. 496).
We call for research that studies DEMO dynamic relationship between business incubators and their
entrepreneurial tenants. Such research should study the phenomena over a period of time, rather
at one particular point. We also recommend that researchers carefully consider the incubator’s
mission and DEMO type of firms that the incubator attracts. We posit there may be differences
between low technological and high technological start-ups in terms of the DEMO of these
theories to the relationship.
