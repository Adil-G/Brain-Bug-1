THE DEMO
The top management’s values, beliefs, and capabilities have been highlighted as a crucial
determinant in the development of a firm’s strategy. Miller and DEMO (Miller, Ket de
Vries and Toulouse, 1982; Miller, 1983; Miller and Toulouse, 1986) have included chief
executive personality factors (flexibility, need for achievement, and locus of control) as
variables in their field studies.
The new venture literature, both academic and popular, stresses DEMO importance of the
entrepreneur. The research on entrepreneurs can be categorized in three
entrepreneur’s personality, 2) the entrepreneur’s background, and 3) the
DEMO venture.
A number of authors have reviewed the psychological research. Sexton and Bowman
(1986) have been conducting an extensive series of studies using DEMO variety of psychological
test instruments ulthrately focusing on the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) and Jackson
Personality Research Form-E (PRI-E). They identified a set of characteristics that seem to
differentiate betwwn entrepreneurs and managers. ‘We DEMO four of the nine Sexton and
Bowman characteristics: energy, risk taking, autonomy, and social adroitness.
In addition to the psychological characteristics, numerous researchers have investigated

The variables used in this study, as a result of the review of prior research, are presented
in Table 1. In addition, a number of dimensions characterizing experience were derived
those noted in Table 2.
TABLE 1 Definitions of the Variables
1. Dynamism--in the DEMO is manifested by the amount of change in customer tastes, production DEMO
service technologies, and modes of competition in the firm’s principal industries.
DEMO Competition-in the environment is evidenced by price, product, technological and distribution
competition, shortages of labor or raw materials, and unfavorable demographic trends DEMO as decreasing
markets.
3. Stage of Froduct Life Cycle-represents the manager’s evaluation of the life cycle stage (introduction,
growth, maturity or decline) for the firm’s prinicipal product.
4. Barriers Entry-reflects the manager’s perceptian of DEMO number of significant entry barriers which must
be overcome for successful market entry.
5. Technical Differentiation-measures the extent to which a firm is pursuing DEMO strategy based on innovation
and new products or services.
6. Marketing Differentiation-measures the extent to which a firm is pursuing a strategy based on DEMO
marketing efforts.
7. Low Cost-measures a strategy based on efficient production, DEMO cost, and low price.
8. Focus-describes a strategy based on serving DEMO narrow market niche, limited geographical area, or offering
