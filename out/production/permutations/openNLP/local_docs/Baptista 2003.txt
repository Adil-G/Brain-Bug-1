Geographical Clusters
and Innovation Diffusion
RUI BAPTISTA
ABSTRACT
There is a considerable DEMO of evidence to demonstrate that the diffusion of new technologies is spatially
variable. If ﬁrms rely on each other to learn about new technology, the diffusion process is punctuated by
cognitive externalities, allowing for an easier spread of usage and improvements. The present paper argues
that externalities promoting DEMO adoption of new technology are stronger at the regional level and depend
positively on the proximity of early users. The results of the empirical DEMO presented verify the importance
of geography and inter-ﬁrm networking in the process of knowledge transfer and diffusion, suggesting new
approaches to technology transfer and technology policy.  2001 Elsevier Science Inc.
1. Introduction
Technological diffusion, like any other socio-economic phenomenon, occurs simul-
taneously in time and space. It has been argued that the diffusion of innovations is
truly geographic in DEMO An important part of the pioneering work on diffusion theory
was geographic [1].
A considerable body of evidence within the ﬁeld of economics demonstrates DEMO
the adoption of new technologies varies geographically. Alderman and Davies [2] found
that there are signiﬁcant regional variations in the rates of diffusion of DEMO manufacturing
technologies and that these variations may be partly, but by DEMO means entirely, accounted
for by regional differences in industrial structure and DEMO size distributions.
Such results conﬁrm earlier results reached by Thwaites [3].
It is at the diffusion stage that the greatest impact of the process DEMO technological
change upon economic growth is seen to occur [4]. If any region lags behind in the
production or adoption of new technology, it may face industrial decline. This has
obvious consequences on public policy at DEMO industry and regional levels.
The present paper argues that the diffusion of new technological processes may
occur faster in geographical areas where the density DEMO sources of knowledge about
such technologies is higher. The geographical clustering of innovators and early adopters
of new technology both stimulates and facilitates imitation DEMO improvement [5]. An

empirical model of diffusion is used to examine the DEMO of the regional density of
early adopters on the diffusion of a speciﬁc technology.
Section 2 of the paper discusses the theoretical background to DEMO arguments
presented. Section 3 introduces an empirical model of diffusion. Section 4 presents data
from the technology adoption survey conducted in 1981 by the DEMO of Newcastle’s
Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies (CURDS). DEMO 5 focuses on
estimation and results. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.
2. Background
Economists have been interested in understanding the determinants of technology
DEMO across ﬁrms and industries. Early work on diffusion theory tended to concen-
trate upon epidemic—or learning—effects by which potential adopters procure new
technology upon DEMO information of its existence [6]. In contrast, more recent
theoretical approaches DEMO the subject have emphasised the explicit treatment of a ﬁrm’s
decision to (or not to) adopt a new technology. Different potential adopters should
DEMO different preferred adoption dates.
2.1. LEARNING EFFECTS, FIRM NETWORKING AND DIFFUSION
DEMO signiﬁcant part of the modern work on diffusion theory has its origin in the
epidemic approach to the diffusion phenomenon. This approach was based DEMO theories
modelling the spread of diseases; Griliches [7] and Mansﬁeld [6] DEMO the forerunners
in this approach. These models regard diffusion as resulting from the spread of informa-
tion. In their simplest form, it is assumed that:
1. A potential user will adopt the technology upon learning DEMO its existence.
2. Information on the existence of the technology is spread by direct contact
between a potential user and a user.
The epidemic DEMO approach to diffusion is based on the existence of uncertainty
regarding both the characteristics of the innovation (which is overcome as more ﬁrms
adopt it, thereby spreading information), and the total number of potential adopters.
It is possible to ﬁnd a bridge between this seminal approach and DEMO recent works
focusing on the importance of ﬁrm networking, spillovers, and knowledge sharing.
The adoption process consists of several stages; adoption is not a simple function
of knowledge, but also requires evaluation and trial. Much of the information necessary
to support the diffusion of an innovation ﬂows DEMO personal contacts [8]. Networks
of interpersonal communication that link organisations developing and adopting techno-
logical innovations are of considerable importance in the diffusion process DEMO
As technological change occurs at an ever-increasing pace, the number of DEMO
innovations and subsequent incremental improvements has expanded beyond any single
ﬁrm’s ability to choose. This fact has led to an increase in the uncertainty DEMO
with the diffusion process. Networking between adopters and potential adopters, and
DEMO producers and users of new technologies is of foremost importance in the
reduction of such uncertainty. This is particularly important for small businesses, which
are more likely to be unable to develop the necessary technology transfer DEMO
when isolated. Information exchange and direct observation of the adoption of new
technologies by others allow small businesses to develop speciﬁc competencies and
improve DEMO others’ methods [10].
Networks of innovators have an explicit local dimension [11] and have been studied
both by mainstream economists and economic geographers. Firm DEMO is an
GEOGRAPHICAL CLUSTERS AND INNOVATION DIFFUSION 33
essential element in a region’s knowledge DEMO [12]. Ebadi and Utterback [13]
have demonstrated that network cohesiveness is positively correlated to the degree of
innovative success. Midgley et al. [9] found DEMO cohesiveness (deﬁned as direct user-
to-user inﬂuence) has a positive impact on the diffusion of industrial innovations.
If ﬁrms rely on each other DEMO learn about new technology, the diffusion process is
punctuated by externalities, both cognitive and real [14]. These externalities associated
with the learning and DEMO of new technological knowledge should reduce the costs
of taking up technology embodying capital goods and facilitate the assimilation of the
new technology into DEMO ﬁrm’s value chain. Their intensity is likely to be stronger at
the local level, since this kind of new, tacit knowledge ﬂows more DEMO through
interpersonal contacts [15]. It should also depend positively on the proximity of early
users and of technologically close ﬁrms, either acting as competitors, customers, suppli-
ers, or service providers [16].
Pressures from social emulation and a localised competitive environment lead ﬁrms
to adopt a new technology DEMO order to “stay in the game.” Abrahamson and Rosenkopf
[17] present a model in which bandwagon effects occur at the institutional level because
non-adopters DEMO to be perceived as below-average performers. This situation would
lead to generalised adoption of innovations even when proﬁtability is uncertain.
The dynamics of user-producer DEMO can also stimulate diffusion. Networking
between the producers and users of a new technology facilitates the transmission of
knowledge that is speciﬁc to it. DEMO accumulated experience and demand pressure of
a technologically progressive user is also likely to inﬂuence incremental improvements
and expansion of innovation into new areas DEMO, 19]. Close interaction and day-to-day
contact between users and producers, where allowed by geographical proximity, should
deepen these relationships.
Given the arguments presented above, it seems reasonable to claim that external
epidemic or informational effects on the diffusion of industrial innovations will be
stronger in some regions DEMO in others. Furthermore, these local differences will be
associated with localised DEMO and the presence of sources of technological infor-
mation, such as DEMO ﬁrms and early adopters. Diffusion may occur faster in
geographical areas where the density of previous adopters and other sources of knowl-
edge about DEMO technologies is higher.
2.1.1. The Geography of Innovation and R&D Spillovers
The issues of R&D spillovers and the geographical distribution of innovative DEMO
mance are closely connected to the diffusion phenomenon. Spillovers have a crucial
impact on the transmission of new knowledge, which promotes innovation and organisa-
tional improvement, and supports the successful adoption of new technologies.
R&D spillovers [20] occur whenever a ﬁrm shares knowledge with other bodies
performing DEMO and development, such as other ﬁrms, universities, and government
institutions, without having to pay for that information in a market transaction. They
DEMO the impact of discovered ideas or compounds in the research endeavours of
others [21].
New technological knowledge is said to be more easily transmitted DEMO interpersonal
contact than across great distances, due to its uncodiﬁed character DEMO One would
then expect spillovers to be, to a certain extent, regionally bounded. Such a result has
important implications for the regional distribution DEMO both innovative performance
and diffusion.

Jaffe [23] found evidence that corporate patenting activity within DEMO particular U.S.
state increases with the level of research expenditures undertaken by universities in
that state, while also increasing with corporate R&D expenditure. Using innovation
counts for the United States, Acs et al. [24] found that the impact of spillovers from
university R&D is positive and DEMO greater on innovations than on patents.
Moreover, geographical proximity seems to DEMO an important part, since there is strong
correlation between university and DEMO R&D at the state level, with both having
a positive DEMO on the generation of knowledge.
Jaffe et al. [25] used data on patent citations to determine the extent to which
knowledge spillovers are geographically DEMO and concentrated. They ﬁnd evidence
for a strong geographical localisation of spillovers. Testing for different levels of geo-
graphical matching (country, state, and metropolitan area), the authors found that
spillovers become more signiﬁcant as DEMO geographical area becomes smaller. Localisa-
tion appears more signiﬁcant for patents registered by universities and by medium and
small ﬁrms than for the patents DEMO by top corporations. Another important result
suggests that localisation is likely to be stronger for early citations.
Feldman [26] found that regional innovative output DEMO in the presence of
high private and academic research expenditures undertaken within a region. The close
presence of related industries has the most signiﬁcant DEMO on innovation. This seems
to demonstrate the importance of regional networks of innovators, at least in highly
innovative industries. The presence of specialised business services is signiﬁcant as well.
Audretsch and Feldman [27] also found evidence DEMO favour of geographical cluster-
ing of innovative output in the United States. Using data for the UK, Baptista and
Swann [28, 29] found DEMO effects on innovative performance, ﬁrm growth, and entry
of spillovers mediated by strong regional clustering of industries.
The views that underlie the organisation DEMO industrial innovation point to the
pervasiveness of knowledge spillovers and information sharing on innovative activity
and diffusion. Research on networking and geographic clustering of DEMO leads to the
conclusion that a localised pattern of development facilitates a collective learning proc-
ess, increasing the speed of knowledge transfer by reducing uncertainty.
2.2. MODELS WITH PERFECT INFORMATION
Other approaches to the diffusion phenomenon DEMO uncovered a series of factors
inﬂuencing the spread of technology. While epidemic models present a disequilibrium
approach resulting from information asymmetries between potential users DEMO have
therefore been criticised on that account [30], other models tend DEMO assume that there
is perfect information concerning the existence and nature of new technologies. Such
models generate a different set of effects on diffusion. DEMO and Stoneman [31]
group them into three categories: rank (or probit), stock, and order effects. In each
kind of equilibrium model the ﬁrm’s decision to adopt depends upon the gains from
adoption relative to DEMO cost of adoption. As such gains and costs change over time,
the number of adopters changes, too.
In the rank or probit models [32], potential users of a new technology differ from
each other in some important dimension so that some ﬁrms obtain a greater return
from DEMO new technology than do others and tend to adopt faster. It is then possible
to rank ﬁrms in terms of their returns from adoption.
DEMO stock effects models [33, 34] argue that as the number of DEMO of the new
technology increases, the beneﬁts from adoption decline. Hence, there will be a number
of adopters beyond which adoption is not DEMO
GEOGRAPHICAL CLUSTERS AND INNOVATION DIFFUSION 35
The order effects models [35] consider DEMO the ﬁrm’s position in the adoption
order determines its return from the use of the technology, with ﬁrms higher in the
adoption order obtaining greater returns than ﬁrms lower in that order. For any given
technology DEMO, only ﬁrms down to a certain point in the adoption order DEMO ﬁnd it
proﬁtable to adopt.
3. Modelling Diffusion
A model of diffusion combining the approaches mentioned in the previous section
has to consider that DEMO choice of an optimal time of adoption will be inﬂuenced by
characteristics speciﬁc to the ﬁrm (rank effects) and by variables related to DEMO and
order. It is hard, however, to identify some of those effects separately, and to distinguish
them from the learning or epidemic effect, since this effect acts in a cumulative process
that underlies the course of diffusion.
The empirical model of diffusion used in the present paper DEMO the one introduced
in Baptista [36]. The model was developed from the approach used by Karshenas and
Stoneman [37], and is brieﬂy outlined in the following sub-section.
3.1. THE ADOPTION DECISION
Each ﬁrm’s beneﬁts per period DEMO adopting a given new technology are assumed
to depend on:
1. Characteristics speciﬁc to the ﬁrm and/or industry, representing the rank effect;
2. the number of ﬁrms already using the technology representing the DEMO effect;
3. the number of previous adopters of the technology, DEMO the order effect; and
4. the number of previous adopters located DEMO the ﬁrm’s own region, accounting
for external effects resulting from localised DEMO and transmission of infor-
mation.
It should be noted that, since DEMO epidemic effect also acts at the global level in
the economy, DEMO total stock of previous adopters might also generate an effect on
adoption which is the opposite of the expected stock and order effects.
For DEMO ﬁrm to adopt a technology at a certain time t, the DEMO from adoption
must satisfy two conditions [36, 37]:
1. The DEMO condition requires that acquisition at time t must yield a posi-
tive proﬁt.
2. The arbitrage condition requires that it must not be more DEMO to wait
beyond t to adopt; that is, the net beneﬁt from adoption must not be increasing
over time at t.
It is DEMO to predict that expected reductions in the price of the technology will
delay adoption [38], as will increases in this price at the present moment. Increases in
the total number of ﬁrms adopting before t should DEMO adoption via the stock and order
effects. However, the existence of DEMO global epidemic effect will counteract such outcome.
A higher number of regional adopters by t should increase adoption in this period
due to localised DEMO learning effects, although such effect could also be counteracted
by some DEMO of regional stock effect. The rank effect will, of course, depend on which
individual ﬁrm characteristics are considered.
3.2. VARIABLES INFLUENCING ADOPTION
There DEMO be numerous ﬁrm and industry-speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing the adop-
tion decision. Size of ﬁrm is the most frequently used variable in rank or probit DEMO
36
R. BAPTISTA
[32]. The argument behind this assumption is that many DEMO technologies show positive
scale effects, making adoption more proﬁtable for larger DEMO; thus larger ﬁrms
adopt earlier.
Given contingencies such as sunk costs DEMO, 39], one should also expect that new
ﬁrms, ﬁrms with DEMO equipment, and ﬁrms expanding capacity will be more likely
to adopt DEMO new technology. The age of establishment and the expected variation in the
industry’s output should account for these effects. While age might show an DEMO
sign, one would hope that the expected variation in output will DEMO a positive effect
on adoption. It should be noted that new ﬁrms will be more ﬂexible to the introduction
of new technologies [40, 41].
The R&D effort at the establishment level can be taken as DEMO of the ﬁrm’s
ability to process new technological information. Firms performing R&D should be
able to reduce the risk associated with the adoption DEMO new technology, since they are
in a better position to beneﬁt DEMO the pool of knowledge created by other ﬁrms
engaging in related R&D. Mowery [42] suggests that ﬁrms that maintain R&D activities
are DEMO provided with an enhanced capability for monitoring and assessing technolo-
gies originated elsewhere. Teece [43] argues that R&D contributes to the ability of DEMO
nology transfer beneﬁciaries to absorb manufacturing technologies at a minimum cost.
While independent units might be more ﬂexible in terms of implementation speed,
DEMO that are part of a larger corporation will experience less uncertainty and
less ﬁnancial constraints. The corporate status of the establishment (independent or
part of a larger unit) should therefore inﬂuence the adoption decision. Rees et al.
[44] found that small (single plant) independent ﬁrms tend to DEMO slower in adopting
new technology.
Different industries will present different risks and different adaptabilities to new
technology, and Karshenas and Stoneman [37] have shown that there are sector-speciﬁc
endogenous epidemic effects. Therefore, industry or sector characteristics should be
taken into consideration.
The stock and order effects can be DEMO through adoption-precedence vari-
ables. The stock of adopters and the expected number of ﬁrms to adopt in each period,
together with the expected DEMO of technology, should have a negative effect on the
adoption rate. DEMO, as it has been pointed out, since the epidemic effect acts
through a learning-by-contact process, the stock of previous adopters might also bring
forth a different kind of effect on adoption—this time a positive one—making DEMO net
effect ambiguous.
It is suggested that one possible way to avoid this problem is to use the price of
the output as an DEMO measure of the stock effect. If one expects the widespread
use of the technology to act on production costs (and eventually on industry demand),
then the price of the industry output should eventually show these effects, becoming a
suitable surrogate for the stock effect and therefore replacing the total stock of adopters
in the model. One should note, however, that the output price will reﬂect a series of
other different effects, giving rise to results which are difﬁcult to interpret.
It is expected that the positive effect of the stock of adopters on the diffusion DEMO
through the learning/epidemic process will be more signiﬁcant at the regional level. On
the one hand, any local stock effect will be less signiﬁcant; on the other hand, the
learning effect resulting from easier DEMO with other adopters will become stronger.
The stock of regional adopters is, therefore, a measure of the signiﬁcance of regional
external effects. Total DEMO employment in the industry measures cluster strength
in terms of the presence of technologically close ﬁrms.

The total stock of previous adopters is expected to have a negative (or, at DEMO,
ambiguous) effect on the diffusion rate, reﬂecting the predominance of the nation-wide
stock effect over the learning effect, while the regional stock of previous adopters would
have a positive effect on adoption, reﬂecting the predominance of the learning effect
over the stock effect at the local DEMO
4. Data and Methodology
The present study uses time-to-adoption as the dependent variable, following Han-
nah and McDowell [45], Levin et al. [46], Rose and Joskow [47], and Karshenas and
Stoneman [37]. The 1981 CURDS survey covered all identiﬁed UK establishments in
the engineering and metalworking industries. DEMO the survey was repeated in 1986
and 1993, a relatively large DEMO of active ﬁrms dropped out, thus generating an
incomplete panel. It DEMO decided, therefore, to use only data from the 1981 survey.
4.1. DATA USED IN THE STUDY
The data set covers six three-digit industrial DEMO Establishments are assigned
to the ten standard regions of Great Britain as deﬁned by the Central Statistical Ofﬁce
(CSO).2 The technology selected for the study was computer numerically controlled
(CNC) machine tools. A summary DEMO the adoption data is given in Table 1. Although
numerically controlled machine tools were ﬁrst developed in the 1950’s, it was the
introduction of microcomputers as the basis of the numerical control unit that allowed
for DEMO widespread diffusion during the seventies. This is a relatively complex and expensive
technology, and its early users were primarily large ﬁrms [48]. The ﬁrst recorded adoption
of CNC in the UK engineering industry happened in 1968. DEMO data set covers adoption
from 1968 to 1980, so no left-censoring DEMO should be found.
In principle, it would be possible to identify DEMO different development stages,
or even generations, since the appearance of DEMO technology. However, for the purpose

of this paper it is more useful to concentrate DEMO the diffusion of a generic technology
than on individual generations. This is the usual procedure in the literature [31] and
the data do not DEMO for individual analysis. The data set comprised 1035 ﬁrms, of
which DEMO had adopted CNC machine tools by 1980.
One should note that data refer to the establishment as the adoption unit, so it is
assumed that the adoption decision is taken at the establishment level. Although most
DEMO treats the ﬁrm as the decision-making unit, empirical evidence suggests that
DEMO might not be an unreasonable assumption [49]. Furthermore, any external effects
DEMO at the regional level should be primarily reﬂected on the establishment.
A description of the variables used is given in Table 2. Perfect foresight DEMO assumed
when determining values for the expectations variables. Although one would expect
the technology price to fall when adoption increases, CNC machine tools were mainly
supplied through imports, so it is unlikely that individual ﬁrms’ decisions would affect
prices. Furthermore, both technology prices and industry output changed monotonically
over the observation period, so the use of any expectation rule would not change the
results considerably.
4.2. ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATION
A duration, or failure time model [50, 51], is used to explain time-to-adoption as
a DEMO of the independent variables. The hazard rate is here deﬁned as the probability
that a ﬁrm i will adopt the innovation at time t, conditional on not having adopted the
innovation before t.
Estimation in the DEMO of a speciﬁc functional form for the hazard rate is done
by using a version of the general class of proportional hazard models suggested DEMO Cox
[52]. The procedure is discussed by Kiefer [51] and Karshenas and Stoneman [37].
Estimation of such a model including exogenous covariates (independent variables) is
founded on the deﬁnition of an underlying distribution for the hazard rate (baseline
hazard function). This distribution is pre-determined through speciﬁcation tests.
The examination of the diffusion path (hazard function) for CNC machine DEMO,
presented in Figure 1, suggests that the rate of diffusion DEMO not uniform over time: the
probability that a ﬁrm will adopt, given that it has not adopted previously, increases
with time. Therefore, DEMO assumption of a constant hazard rate, corresponding to an
exponential distribution DEMO the baseline hazard function [50, 51], seems unreasonable.
The diffusion path depicted suggests that the Weibull and the log-logistic distributions
are more likely DEMO be appropriate.
A useful approach to speciﬁcation testing of failure time models is based on the
concept of pseudo-residuals, or generalised residuals.3 The test compares the residuals
generated by non-parametric estimation of the hazard function [51] DEMO the residuals
that would be produced by adjusting a speciﬁc distribution (DEMO this case, the Weibull
or the log-logistic) to the baseline hazard. It is then possible to examine graphically
which one produces the best DEMO
Figure 2 shows that the Weibull distribution produces standardised residuals that
are closer to the residuals generated by non-parametric estimation. In practice, as
suggested Karshenas and Stoneman [37], the actual choice of a baseline hazard structure
seems to make little difference as far as estimates and inferences are DEMO
3 For a detailed presentation of the method, see Blossfeld and DEMO [53].
4 In addition to the Weibull, estimations for exponential and DEMO models were also obtained
showing similar patterns of results.

One other issue worth discussion is the DEMO of individual heterogeneity. It is
possible that the ﬁrm and industry level variables included might not pick up all system-
atic individual differences. Hence, a model incorporating a term for unobserved hetero-
geneity into the Weibull DEMO was estimated [54]. Estimation of this model,
however, showed individual DEMO to be insigniﬁcant.5
5. Results
Before estimation, a non-parametric analysis of DEMO diffusion path for CNC machine
tools (the time series of time DEMO adoption) was conducted in order to test for regional
differences. A DEMO test [55] pooling all ten regions found that the distributions of
adoption times are signiﬁcantly different.6 A series of Mantel-Haenszel tests [56] con-
5 DEMO gamma distribution with mean equal to one and variance equal to a parameter s was assumed for
the heterogeneity term. The value estimated for DEMO was not signiﬁcant at the 1% conﬁdence level.
6 A chi-square test yielded a critical value of 29.44, which is signiﬁcant at the 1% level.

It seems apparent then that there is a regional dimension to diffusion.
A model pooling all DEMO across the ten regions was estimated parametrically.
Three different versions were estimated, including the total stock of adopters, the output
price or both, as variables associated with the stock and order effects. This separation
was DEMO in an attempt to isolate external epidemic or learning effects (as DEMO
at the global level by the total stock of previous adopters) DEMO stock effects and to
avoid multicollinearity between the regional and nation-wide stocks of adopters.

is signiﬁcant when industry output price is used instead of the total stock of previous
adopters DEMO account for stock and order effects. The non-signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcient
when both regional and total stocks of adopters are used may be due DEMO autocorrelation
between the regional and global stock variables, since the absolute DEMO for the coefﬁ-
cient of previous regional adopters is much higher when the total number of previous
adopters is left out of the model.
DEMO stock of total previous adopters is not signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the expected
DEMO arising from the conﬂict between stock/order effects and external learn-

ing effects that counteract each other. DEMO price—when used instead of or together
with the stock of previous adopters—shows a negative insigniﬁcant effect on adoption
which is difﬁcult to interpret.
Such DEMO seem to substantiate the existence of a signiﬁcant positive regional
learning effect inﬂuencing diffusion. However, regional industry dimension, as measured
by employment, does not appear to be signiﬁcant on adoption, meaning that exogenous
learning effects are not sensitive to the presence of ﬁrms in the same or DEMO activities.
Ownership status of the establishment and the number of R&D-related employees
are never signiﬁcant. Age and size of ﬁrm present signiﬁcant positive DEMO on adoption,
and so do expected increases in industry output.
The coefﬁcients for technology price and expected technology price are also signiﬁ-
cant DEMO have the expected signs. The signiﬁcance and high absolute values of the
coefﬁcients for the expected price and expected industry output growth seem to DEMO
the ﬁnding that myopic-type models of diffusion are misspeciﬁed [37]. Industry ﬁxed
effects are signiﬁcant, at least when taken as a whole. A likelihood ratio test for the
inclusion of the industry dummies found this inclusion DEMO be signiﬁcant at the 1% level.
This may be due to differences in market concentration levels and/or endogenous
epidemic effects.
6. Concluding Remarks
DEMO an extensive theoretical discussion, the present paper empirically tested
the pervasiveness DEMO external learning effects acting at the regional level on the diffusion
of a new industrial technology. For that, a general model of diffusion was built, incorpo-
rating the main theoretical streams existent in diffusion literature: DEMO, stock, order,
and epidemic/learning effects, both at the DEMO and global level.
The results conﬁrm the existence of signiﬁcant regional learning effects mediated
through the presence of previous regional adopters. Signiﬁcant signs were DEMO of a
positive regional learning effect that overcomes any negative stock/order effects happen-
ing at the same level—resulting in a weak, but signiﬁcantly positive, net effect. At the
national level, the learning beneﬁts are DEMO too weak to overcome the stock/
order effects.
The positive impact of the growth of output in user industry supports Karshenas
and Stoneman’s DEMO ﬁnding. The variables related to the price of technology also have
the expected effects. No evidence is found for stock and order effects. However, empirical
testing of game-theoretic models of diffusion still needs considerable improvement, and
studies like Hannan and McDowell [45] have also not found evidence of DEMO stock or
order effects.
The results conﬁrm that exogenous learning and epidemic effects are stronger at
the regional level than at the global level. DEMO should have important implications in
terms of industrial and regional policies. The present study conﬁrms that external
epidemic effects related to the transmission of DEMO through the presence of
previous adopters are strong enough to overcome any negative stock and order effects
that might result from increased competition due DEMO the accumulation of such adopters,
at least at the local level. It is therefore possible to claim that, similarly to knowledge
spillovers [25] and agglomeration externalities related to growth [57], externalities re-
lated to knowledge acting on the diffusion of process innovations tend to grow stronger
as DEMO geographical unit of reference becomes smaller.
The results suggest that geography plays a part in the diffusion process as a mediator
of knowledge transmission DEMO of technology transfer. The pervasiveness of locational
44
R. BAPTISTA
effects should depend on the nature of technological knowledge DEMO other structural
characteristics of industries, but close presence of sources of DEMO knowledge,
such as previous adopters, clearly inﬂuences the pace of DEMO technological change and
innovation diffusion. The impact upon diffusion of the interaction between informational
externalities, knowledge spillovers, geographical proximity, and ﬁrm networking pro-
vides an important avenue of research in the economics of diffusion.
With DEMO to policy, it seems clear that important conclusions can be drawn DEMO
terms of industrial, regional, and technology policies from the arguments presented. On
the one hand, the promotion of inter-ﬁrm networking as a way for reducing uncertainty
deriving from imperfect information arises as a clear policy DEMO On the other hand,
the existence of various types of externalities associated with regional concentration of
ﬁrms is a possible source of market DEMO and may create problems regarding income
distribution among regions.
Furthermore, it DEMO be pointed out that a broader institutional scope is needed
for evaluating technology diffusion and technology policy [58]. Interpersonal connections
and networking play an DEMO role in knowledge transfer, and supply-side factors
are often signiﬁcant in DEMO diffusion paths. This leads to the need for policy
to consider the role of supplier-user relationships, professional and trade associations,
academic and public-funded R&D, and organisations manufacturing complementary
assets and technologies. The signiﬁcance of these institutional relationships becomes
larger as their geographical scope becomes smaller.
