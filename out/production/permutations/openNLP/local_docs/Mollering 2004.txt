various social science DEMO Second, it discusses different levels of analysing trust in
organizational settings. DEMO, it deals with important issues of operationalisation and
measurement of organizational DEMO Finally, it brieﬂy summarises the contents of the ﬁve papers

organizational trust”.
Introduction
Over the past 15 years or so, “trust” has attracted enormous interest within the social
sciences. Misztal (1996, p. DEMO) suspects that “the recent increase in the visibility of the
issue DEMO trust can be attributed to the emergence of a widespread consciousness that
existing bases for social co-operation, solidarity and consensus have been eroded and
that there is a need to search for new alternatives”. Similarly, Seligman (1997, p. 160)
argues that “the rising concern with trust DEMO a response to the fact that in the current
situation we are more dependent on trust (and less on familiarity) to supplement those
DEMO points where system conﬁdence is not sufﬁcient; this is occurring at DEMO
same time that these points become more numerous with the ever-increasing
differentiation of roles”. Agents only become aware of trust when it is problematic. DEMO
this light, the recent interest in trust is by no means DEMO, nor hypocritical.
The present special issue of this journal bears witness DEMO many intriguing questions
that have been opened, rather than settled, by the earlier special issues on trust-related
themes, notably Academy of Management Journal Vol. 38 No. 1 (1995), Cambridge
Journal of Economics Vol. 21 No. 2 (1997), Academy of Management Review Vol. 23
No. 3 (1998), Organization Studies Vol. 22 No. 2 (2001), Organization DEMO Vol. 14
No. 1 (2003), International Journal of Human Resource DEMO Vol. 14 No. 1
(2003), International Studies of Management and DEMO Vol. 33 No. 2 (2003) and
Personnel Review Vol. 32 No. 5 (2003). Collections of authoritative papers equally
demonstrate the many facets of trust in managerial and organizational contexts, as
Gambetta’s (1988) seminal volume was followed, for example, by Kramer and Tyler
(1996), Lane and Bachmann (1998), Cook (2001) and DEMO and Six (2003). We
mention these special issues and edited DEMO, rather than individual articles and
monographs, because they highlight the fact that, at present, trust researchers
constitute a very active and distinct DEMO community that is set to continue
studying the role of trust with a strong presence at conferences such as the Academy of
Management, the European Group for Organizational Studies (EGOS) or the European
Academy of DEMO (EURAM).
These references taken together carry the simple message that DEMO is something
that we feel we need to discuss, perhaps in DEMO to understand it better, but probably
also with a view to DEMO the chances of maintaining and repairing it wherever it
is essential, DEMO at least desirable, in relationships within and between organisations.
With this DEMO and, indeed, the whole special issue, we aim to contribute DEMO into
a number of aspects that we believe are particularly important to organizational and
managerial psychology.
Within the organizational context, the questions and problems are multi-faceted.
They concern differences in the speciﬁc meaning of “trust” when DEMO exists between
co-workers, leaders and followers, employers and employees, between DEMO
organisations or towards an institution. Moreover, it is important to see DEMO
operationalisations of the abstract construct of trust need to be sensitive to the speciﬁc
characteristics of trustors and trustees concerned. The results of many DEMO
studies on trust-based relationships may be quite idiosyncratic and only allow limited
comparisons between different constellations. Measurements, for example, may not be
transferable DEMO different levels of analysis. These are common issues of
methodology in managerial psychology, but we feel that they are particularly relevant
to trust. We will discuss them in the main part of this article with reference DEMO the
contributions to this special issue and we will address the problem of multiple
constellations and resulting challenges of empirically operationalising the concept of
DEMO This will be followed by a brief overview of the articles as such. First, however,
we would like to offer a review of foundational work on trust in order to introduce the
main discourses and DEMO identify some common ground for the multidisciplinary
research collected here.
Common foundations
The word “trust” dates back to 13th century Middle English and has DEMO etymological
roots in older expressions denoting faithfulness and loyalty, but the DEMO of
trust is probably as old as the earliest forms of human association. To give just one
example, even Confucius (551-479 BC) had already considered trust to be a precondition
and basis for all worthwhile DEMO relations (Hann, 1968). Many classical writers in
philosophy and the social sciences have pointed out how vital trust is in preventing
social DEMO from paralysing social life. Political scientists and philosophers
trace basic ideas on trust back to Hobbes, Locke and Hume (Dunn, 1988; Hollis, 1998).
Sociologists also refer to the founding fathers of their discipline, e.g. Durkheim or
Simmel, and psychologists ﬁnd their seminal ideas in classical writings of Freud and
others.
Signiﬁcant ideas, beyond the classics, emerged DEMO the 1960s onwards in what we
could describe as a wide and fruitful arena of interdisciplinary exchange between
psychology, sociology and other social sciences as well as the still nascent discipline

of management and organisation studies. Goffman (1963), in his micro-sociological
studies on everyday social interaction, describes the essential, DEMO habitual, role of trust
in maintaining social processes. Erikson (1965) DEMO that learning to trust is critical
in childhood development, emphasising a DEMO psychological embeddedness of trust.
Garﬁnkel’s (1967) ethnomethodological work on “basic trust” similarly emphasizes the
vital need to expect the persistence of the moral DEMO order.
In a more quantitatively oriented vein, Rotter (1967) devises DEMO “Interpersonal Trust
Scale” (ITS) which is designed to measure individual predispositions as well as the
aggregate level of trust within a population, deﬁned as a generalized expectation
towards other actors, media and institutions. The ITS comprises 25-Likert-type items
(Likert, 1932), such as “Parents usually can DEMO relied upon to keep their promises” and
“Most elected public ofﬁcials are really sincere in their campaign promises”. Less
concerned with measurement, Barber’s (DEMO) work places emphasis on societal trust,
especially with regard to DEMO representatives and institutions. He discusses the
concept of ﬁduciary obligation and distinguishes it from technically competent
performance. Barber’s worries about the erosion of trust DEMO society remain topical
(Cook, 2001).
Henslin’s (1968) cab-driver study gives rich empirical insights into how trust
bears out in everyday life. DEMO conﬁrms the deep-seated assumptions underlying
trust in practice, but at the DEMO time it shows that trust is discretionary. This
latter point connects with the work of Deutsch (1973) who builds his research on
the DEMO that trust can be observed from individual behaviour and, thus,
DEMO measured. He emphasizes action and situation variables over
attitude and personality. Trust, accordingly, is revealed in prisoner’s dilemma-type
experiments when agents choose to DEMO instead of competing (Kee and
Knox, 1970; Wrightsman, 1966). This game theoretical approach has also been
adopted, for example, by DEMO (1984) and Dasgupta (1988) and has inﬂuenced
Coleman’s (1990) rational-choice approach.
Luhmann (1979) discusses trust functionally as a mechanism for DEMO reduction of
social complexity. He links the concept to our experiencing of a complex reality that
would overwhelm us, if we were unable to rely on continuity and imperfectly rational
expectations. Trust as weak inductive knowledge DEMO the “blending of knowledge and
ignorance” (Luhmann, 1979, p. 26) are notions that Luhmann borrows from Simmel,
(1950; see Mo¨llering, 2001). He notes that “the inner foundations of trust which we DEMO
seeking cannot lie in cognitive capacity” but rather in “a type of system-internal
‘suspension’” (Luhmann, 1979, p. 79). A key idea introduced by Luhmann is his
distinction between personal trust and system trust, and especially trust in
“generalized media of communication” (truth, love, power, DEMO). The question of
trust in (the face of) institutions continues to be discussed (Bachmann, 2001; Giddens,
1990; Lane and DEMO, 1996; Shapiro, 1987; Sztompka, 1999). A milestone in DEMO
respect is Zucker (1986) who contributes a typology of trust according to the sources
from which trust may be produced. She argues that DEMO trust” and
“characteristic-based trust” (both person-speciﬁc) have historically been supplemented
by “institutional-based trust” which she exempliﬁes with reference to fundamental
changes in the DEMO socio-economic system in the 19th and early 20th century.
Giddens’ (1990) long essay on modernity points to the centrality of trust for
understanding DEMO society overall. Interestingly, he argues that in late
modernity trust needs to be actively cultivated at the interpersonal level, due to the
relative instability of societal bases for trust (Giddens, 1994)DEMO
In management and organization studies, speciﬁcally, Zand’s (1972) article has been
inﬂuential early on. In particular, Zand describes in some detail an idea already
suggested by Blau (1964) and Luhmann (1979), namely that trust is a gradual,
self-reinforcing phenomenon. Zand (1972, p. DEMO) presents a “spiral reinforcement
model of the dynamics of trust”. In DEMO to show how trust leads to more trust and
distrust to more distrust, Zand uses disclosure of information, acceptance of inﬂuence
and exercise DEMO control as constructs which have a feedback relationship with trust.
Accordingly, DEMO initial trust will lead the actor A to disclose information, accept
DEMO and reduce control, while the other actor B perceives as positive DEMO of
trustworthiness that increase B’s level of trust and induce similarly open behaviour.
This reinforces A’s initial trust and thus leads to further trusting DEMO, reinforcing
B’s trust and so forth.
An important stream of the DEMO literature on trust is concerned with the
theory of economic organization and governance. Bradach and Eccles (1989, p. 97)
point out that DEMO research has pointed out the existence of stable long-term
relationships between independent exchange partners”. Trust is introduced as a social
mechanism – besides price DEMO authority – in order to make the transaction cost
approach (Williamson, 1975, 1985) more complete and realistic (Chiles and McMackin,
1996; Cummings and Bromiley, 1996; Ring and Van de Ven, 1992)DEMO In a similar vein,
Choi et al. (1999) analyses contractual uncertainty in the context of emerging economies
and propose a typology of DEMO and transaction governance that consists of legal
contract, trust and hostage. DEMO the area of corporate governance, Blair (2003) also points
to DEMO promise of research on informal institutions that support trusting relationships
and help to establish cooperative social norms that are outside the law. Trust and
DEMO emanating from ethnicity and kinship also play a major role in co-ordinating
and governing various types of business networks as illustrated by the Chinese
DEMO network in Southeast Asia (Choi et al., 1995a, b; Landa, 1994). One important
implication of this stream of research is that various types of societal trust can be seen
as the basis for DEMO forms of economic organization.
Another strong stream of trust research stems from a renewed interest in the
socio-psychological aspects of business relationships and managerial DEMO
(e.g. Kramer and Tyler, 1996). In this view, theoretical DEMO are largely
empirically led in the sense that organizational realities have changed and are in need
of explanation. Three aspects appear particularly pertinent for DEMO:
ﬂexibility, co-operation and learning. In simple terms, these require organizational
openness both structurally and with regard to individual behaviour. Thus, researchers
and practitioners turn to the concept of trust as a mechanism enabling managers DEMO
achieve organizational openness and, ultimately, competitiveness while reducing social
uncertainty and vulnerability.
Employees are expected, for example, to accept changing roles, to identify
opportunities across functional boundaries and to challenge practices in order to
DEMO and learn continuously. This is highly demanding and cannot be endured for
long without the conﬁdence that the others involved are competent, understanding and
benevolent, in other words trustworthy. Since Fox (1974), numerous organizational
DEMO have examining the constitution and development of trust within

organizations, notably for example the much-cited contributions by Mayer et al. (1995),
McAllister (1995), Creed and Miles (1996) and Lewicki and Bunker (1996).
Furthermore, there is DEMO vast amount of research on trust in inter-organizational
relationships, especially when DEMO are referred to as partnerships or alliances. Sako’s
(1992) study is a pioneering example of the operationalisation of trust for
inter-organizational relationships. Again, competitiveness is at stake as ﬁrms are
“co-operating to compete” (Faulkner, DEMO). There are, however, conceptual difﬁculties
concerning the notions of individuals trusting an organisation (rather than another
individual) and organisations trusting each DEMO The unresolved question here is to
what extent trust can be generalized and institutionalized beyond the momentary state
of mind of the individual (Currall and Judge, 1995). Also, it is recognized that
inter-organizational trust DEMO especially dependent on and mediated by the institutional
framework in which the relationship is embedded (Bachmann, 2001; Lane and
Bachmann, 1996; Zucker, 1986). This concerns legal frameworks, notably contract and
property laws, as well as the socio-cultural background (Child and Mo¨llering, 2003).
DEMO has been noted that the trust is crucial but also most problematic in international
co-operation: the partners come together with different goals and personalities, as
members of different organizations and different institutional backgrounds and may
have very limited knowledge about each other initially (Child, 1998).
Until DEMO end of the 1990s, trust research was heavily conceptual – as DEMO typical for a
“new” research topic – but more recently, trust DEMO have devoted most of their
efforts to empirical investigations. Speciﬁcally, quantitative DEMO aimed at hypothesis
testing and modelling currently dominate the scene. While we suspect a certain
one-sidedness here – and would like to see new DEMO development and more
qualitative work – this may simply be a time in trust research, when we perform
collective “reality checks” on concepts that have been discussed for a long time,
assessing also their potential DEMO informing social practice in organisations. Adopting
Hirsch and Levin’s (1999) colourful dialectic, this may be a time for the “validity police”,
but we still need “umbrella advocates” for the broader development of trust research.
DEMO constellations
Unsurprisingly, there is a broad range of trust deﬁnitions proposed DEMO the literature, but
we would concur with Rousseau et al. (1998, p. 395) that fairly broad consent could be
obtained for their DEMO of trust as “a psychological state comprising the intention to
accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of
another”. Moreover, at a highly abstract level the conditions under which the problem of
DEMO arises are basically agreed on. It takes a trustor and a trustee who – in the widest
sense – are able to interact within DEMO social system. The trustor is vulnerable to the
actions of the trustee and cannot fully control the latter’s behaviour. The trustee has the
principal DEMO to act in a way that beneﬁts or harms the trustor (DEMO, 1988).
Whether or not, and to what extent, the DEMO can harm the trustor depends on the
trustor’s own action. By acting on trust, the trustor necessarily increases his
vulnerability towards the other’s potentially harmful actions (Baier, 1986).
The challenge that we see for DEMO trust research is to bring this abstract problem
to life by specifying in an empirical setting all the key elements identiﬁed above:
Who DEMO the trustors and the trustees? How do they interact and in DEMO respects
do they face vulnerability and risk towards each other? What DEMO of social system
(with certain rules, roles and routines) are they embedded in? DEMO do they form
expectations about each other’s intentions and behaviours? What DEMO leads them to
accept or increase their vulnerability? How can they DEMO trust? It should make a
difference, for example, if we DEMO these questions about a trust relationship between
co-workers in a nuclear power station, between a management consultant and his
client, or between a DEMO and its regulatory authority. While interpersonal trust is a
recognised phenomenon, DEMO is a more contentious issue whether a person can trust an
organisation or organisations each other (Blois, 1999; Nooteboom, 2002). Organisations
DEMO be seen as “actors”, but it is considered a bad practice DEMO treat organisations like
persons, i.e. to “anthropomorphize the organization” (Zaheer et al., 1998, p. 142).
In this special issue, each paper discusses a different constellation of trustors and
trustees (Table I). Sally Atkinson analyses the role of inter-personal trust in
relationships that senior managers DEMO a range of sectors (including non-proﬁt) have with
colleagues above, DEMO and at peer levels in their organization. Nicole Gillespie and
Leon Mann look at a trust constellation whereby the trustee is a team leader DEMO the
trustors are team members. Sally Atkinson’s 3608 perspective of leaders (DEMO
managers) is therefore complemented by Nicole Gillespie and Leon Mann’s decidedly
DEMO view from those being led. Natalie Ferres, Julia Connell and Anthony
DEMO study non-management employees, too, but are interested speciﬁcally in
the interpersonal trust that these employees have towards their co-workers (or peers),
DEMO than towards their leaders, and how this affects work behaviour. Hyun-Jung DEMO
study also concerns shop ﬂoor workers, but she sees employee-to-employer trust DEMO
primarily as an interpersonal construct, but as a person-to-organization phenomenon.
Finally, Sabine Koeszegi’s theoretical contribution addresses inter-organizational
negotiations and, therefore, trust at DEMO level of inter-organizational relationships,
although these are clearly not separable from inter-personal inﬂuences on and from
negotiating managers. Nevertheless, her discussion shows that risk and trust can be
attributed to organizations and not just to DEMO
Thus, a wide variety of trust constellations are represented in this DEMO issue,
which we believe helps to understand the complex empirical reality of trust. A great
step forward, not achieved here yet, would DEMO to study explicitly the cross-level effect of
trust in one constellation on trust in another constellation, e.g. how trust among
employees (Ferres et DEMO study) affects those employees’ trust in their organization
(Lee’s approach). At the same time, it is a stimulating exercise to look for empirical
insights that may be transferred from one constellation to the other, for example using
the “principle of gradualness” suggested by Luhmann (1979, DEMO 41). Much common
ground can also be found when it comes to general “indicators of trustworthiness”
(Zucker, 1986, p. 60) that DEMO been identiﬁed in the literature. While the terminology is

Empirical approaches to
operationalising trust
somewhat DEMO (Mayer et al., 1995), the indicators suggested are “not so
different after all” (Bigley and Pearce, 1998; Rousseau et al., DEMO). In particular,
competence, benevolence, integrity and predictability represent recurrent and generic
themes for indicators of trustworthiness. Many authors use several indicators DEMO their
operationalisation of trustworthiness, but there is no overall agreement on DEMO all
four should be part of a concept of trust, whether DEMO is a precondition for the other,
whether they are all equally important or need to be weighted, whether they reinforce
each other or simply add up, and so on (for example, the “Dialogue” in Academy of
Management Review, 1996, Vol. 21 No. 2, pp. 331-45). All in all, though, the literature
suggests an image of DEMO trustworthy actor as someone who is able and willing and
consistent in not exploiting the trustor’s vulnerability.
Idiosyncratic operationalisations
The above considerations about the DEMO constellations of trust that we may ﬁnd in
empirical settings lead to the conclusion that trust is a notoriously elusive construct
when it comes DEMO operationalisation. Researchers are faced with the dilemma: if they
want to DEMO the validity of their own operationalisation of trust in empirical
settings, DEMO operationalisation may become too idiosyncratic to enable generalisations
or transfers to other contexts. Nevertheless, to avoid reinventing the wheel, it is useful
to DEMO how other researchers have operationalised trust, before devising
tailored instruments for DEMO own empirical setting.
Generally, empirical approaches to operationalising trust can be DEMO into three
main categories (Table II). The ﬁrst empirical approach DEMO laboratory experiments
usually involving some kind of variation of the trust game or prisoner’s dilemma
(for example the studies reported by Deutsch (1973)). Trust is measured as the
percentage of interactions in which the DEMO of the experiment choose to cooperate
rather than defect. Notwithstanding interesting ﬁndings on how different modiﬁcations
of the game can bring about a higher DEMO lower percentage of cooperation, the approach
has been criticised on the DEMO of both external validity, given the artiﬁciality of the
laboratory situation, and internal validity, given that cooperative choices need not
reﬂect a state of trust or even a cooperative disposition (Kee and Knox, 1970)DEMO
The standardised survey approach is common in psychological work on personality
traits (Rotter, 1967; Wrightsman, 1966) and in political science research on social
capital (Glaeser et al., 2000; Paxton, 1999). Empirical DEMO in this area aim to
assess by means of a questionnaire, DEMO actor’s general predisposition towards the
trustworthiness of others. For example, the DEMO Social Survey in the United States
contains the following standard item: DEMO speaking, would you say that most
people can be trusted or DEMO you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” Already
mentioned earlier, Rotter’s (1967) ITS operates in a similar way but uses more items.
Empirical approach Concept of trust Indicative scales/authors
Laboratory experiment DEMO of trustor/trustee Percentage of cooperative choices
(Deutsch, 1973)
Standardised survey General predisposition of trustor ITS (Rotter, 1967)
Target-related survey DEMO perception of trustee Organizational trust inventory,
(Cummings and Bromiley, 1996)
Respondents indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with a set of DEMO
statements (Likert, 1932). All items together give an additive scale. While the
predisposition of the trustor is generally recognised as a signiﬁcant DEMO on trust,
the standardised survey approach as such may lack external validity as the attitude
revealed in a survey situation may not predict DEMO manifestations of trust in speciﬁc
everyday situations. Internal validity can be questioned, because the respondent’s
attitude may be a reﬂection of a range of individual factors such as personality traits,
past experience, perceived qualities in others, or all of them.
The third empirical approach to measuring trust(worthiness) requires respondents
to report how they perceive a speciﬁc other actor (target). The instruments applied are
predominantly compound Likert-scales, too ( DEMO and Swap, 1982; Mohr
and Spekman, 1994; Sako, 1992; and the sources in Table III). The main methodological
difference to DEMO standardised survey approach lies in the target-related phrasing of the
statements. For instance, Rotter’s item “Parents usually can be relied upon to keep their
promises” would have to be rephrased by assuming a speciﬁc actor B DEMO the target to
read: “B usually can be relied upon to DEMO his promises”. The external and internal
validity of this empirical approach is somewhat problematic, too. It needs to be
understood that what is measured is a snapshot of A’s subjective perception of B’s
trustworthiness at a DEMO point in time and in the context of their speciﬁc relationship.
Table III shows some indicative items that have been used in target-related surveys
DEMO trust(worthiness). The speciﬁc actor constellation is usually reﬂected in the kinds of
statements used. For example, Larzelere and Huston (1980) are interested in very close
personal relationships, while McAllister (1995) measures perceptions between
colleagues at work. Cummings and Bromiley (1996) design their organizational DEMO
inventory to be used throughout organisations, whereas Zaheer et al. (1998) study
inter-organizational relationships.
Target-related surveys generally have an individualistic bias, because DEMO
respondents are individuals inﬂuenced by subjective personal experiences in
encounters with other individuals (not only abstract organisations). This also draws
attention to the affective element of trust captured in Larzelere and Huston’s as well as
DEMO scales (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). Somewhat ironically, the inclusion DEMO
affective items in a questionnaire may rationalise affect, i.e. turn the DEMO affective
constructs into cognitive constructs. Raising the level of consciousness about affect by
way of the questionnaire format – or indeed any other research DEMO – could
misrepresent the respondent’s affective perception of the target, for DEMO due to
social desirability effects (Crowne and Marlowe, 1964).
In this special issue, the contributing authors have found very different ways of
addressing the issue of operationalisation. Sally Atkinson has chosen an approach akin
DEMO grounded theory. Instead of deﬁning trust narrowly in advance, she gets DEMO
respondents to talk about their own understanding of trust and ﬁnds that the meaning
of trust differs depending on the persons you ask, at what point in time they are asked
and which relationship type they DEMO to (personal vs utility relationships). This leads
to very interesting DEMO even though it means that Sally Atkinson’s
“measurements” of trust would lack the statistical validity required for the kind of
regression analyses performed by DEMO authors present in this special issue, notably
Nicole Gillespie and Leon DEMO and Natalie Ferres et al. In particular, Nicole Gillespie
and Leon DEMO use a target-related survey approach with a 21-item “global trust” scale

comprising the three dimensions of cognitive trust, affective trust and behavioural
trust of the respondent in a speciﬁc leader. They draw on earlier operationalisations
(Butler, 1991; McAllister, 1995) and on their own pilot interviews DEMO construct a scale
suited to their own research. Interestingly, Nicole Gillespie DEMO Leon Mann also include
a blanket, one-item “overall trust” measure which DEMO fortunately – correlates highly
with the “global trust” dimensions.
Natalie Ferres et al.’s contribution to the special issue measures trust in co-workers
by using DEMO 12-item scale taken from a more comprehensive workplace trust
questionnaire developed in their own earlier work. Their approach is classiﬁed as a
standardised survey DEMO (according to Table II), because the 12-items refer to
co-workers DEMO and not to particular individuals (targets). It can be assumed,DEMO
though, that respondents will mainly have their own immediate colleagues in DEMO
when answering the survey questions. Nevertheless, the trust measurement is less
DEMO compared to Nicole Gillespie and Leon Mann’s approach. An
interesting addition to Natalie Ferres et al.’s operationalisation is that they include
dispositional trust as DEMO control variable, i.e. they adapt parts of a standardised
personality survey DEMO assess in how far their respondents are predisposed to trust
others, DEMO may mediate their trust in co-workers.
A speciﬁc operationalisation of trust can be found in Hyun-Jung Lee’s contribution
to this special issue. She focuses DEMO competence-based trust only, operationalising it as
an employee’s belief that the DEMO company has the resources, technologies and
competitive position to keep its DEMO to employees (e.g. with regard to security and
prosperity). This DEMO of trust is measured by three items which are target-related in
the sense that the target is a company, but not a person. Hyun-Jung Lee ﬁnds no direct
connection between her trust measure and continuous improvement DEMO as the
dependent variable. This is a remarkable, counterintuitive ﬁnding which DEMO the
question whether more comprehensive measures such as those of Nicole Gillespie and
Leon Mann, Natalie Ferres et al. or the scales presented in Table III would have led to
different results. One challenge in this DEMO concerns the transformation of scales
targeted at persons to a scale where the trustee is an organisation.
Sabine Koeszegi’s paper is not very much DEMO with measurement or other
aspects of operationalisation. Nevertheless, her discussion points DEMO that trust is a
multidimensional construct. A trusting attitude needs to be distinguished from
trusting behaviour, and only the latter leads to actual consequences of the former. By
implication, empirical studies should measure both attitudes and resulting actions
through surveys and observations, as in the cases of laboratory or ﬁeld studies.
As with the different trust constellations across the studies DEMO here, we do
not think that differences in operationalisation of trust, reﬂecting different research
questions, are highly problematic. Rather, it is instructive DEMO see a variety of facets of
trust measured. Clearly, though, these facets should contribute to one complete, but
probably never completed, picture.
DEMO of the special issue
Finally, we have the pleasure of introducing DEMO reader brieﬂy to the more speciﬁc
contexts and arguments put forward by each of the ﬁve articles selected for this special
issue. The contribution DEMO Sally Atkinson is a ﬁne example of a qualitative study on
the role of trust in different types of relationships. It draws on interviews DEMO 30 senior

managers who were stimulated to produce extensive narratives DEMO their most
important relationships in their work environment. Sally Atkinson shows that trust
can have a strong inﬂuence on the structure and dynamics of DEMO managers’
personal and instrumental relationships. However, she also ﬁnds well functioning
DEMO which are based on mechanisms other than trust. Her critical analysis is
concerned with the question of where trust has its place in a DEMO environment and
provides useful insights by her exploratory study which she sees at a starting point for
more in-depth analyses.
Nicole Gillespie and Leon DEMO look at different leadership styles and investigate
how these are related to building trust and achieving performance. The answer is
drawn from a questionnaire-based DEMO which involved 83 members of 33 R&D
projects. The authors very convincingly show that leadership styles based on
consultation, vision and shared values achieve the highest scores where trust and
performance are to be fostered DEMO intra-organizational relationships.
The paper by Natalie Ferres and her colleagues equally shows that organizations
can beneﬁt from trust among their members. Rather than management, the authors
target the ordinary employee level of organizations in their study DEMO co-worker trust.
Their data draw on a survey in which 299 employees of a public health organization
were involved. In their analysis, they come to the conclusion that trust between
employees is highly predicative of perceived DEMO support and affective
commitment to the organization. Also, they very clearly DEMO that the rate of employee
turnover is strongly related to co-worker trust.
Hyun-Jung Lee’s paper connects to the latter contribution in that she also
DEMO on the level of non-management employees. This study involved 490 shop
ﬂoor workers of a high-tech multinational joint venture. Her results show that a
DEMO type of trust, i.e. competence trust, and the level of shop ﬂoor workers’
identiﬁcation with their organization play a strong role with regard DEMO
organizational success in an environment where global competition is
particularly strong. Speciﬁcally, her work makes clear that efforts of continuous
improvement of product quality and production processes presuppose a high level
of organizational identiﬁcation and trust.
DEMO Koeszegi then takes the reader of this special issue back to more
conceptual considerations. Like Hyun-Jung Lee, she refers to the example of
mutinational joint ventures and investigates trust building processes in relation to
inter-organizational negotiation DEMO Sabine Koeszegi deals with the question
of whether trust can be an appropriate strategy to cope with risk. The conclusion
of her investigation suggests DEMO balanced and highly useful view on the role of
trust in the context of different negotiation strategies, varying from high risk
accepting to risk avoiding approaches.
In various ways, all of the contributions to this special issue offer valuable insights
into the phenomenon of trust in organizational relations. DEMO are predominantly
oriented to empirical research focusing on key questions at different levels of
organizational hierarchy. However, they also show how their research ﬁts into the
theoretical frameworks of trust research which have been established over DEMO past
decades. Thus, they not only provide much needed empirical knowledge DEMO also,
equally, make important contributions to elaborate conceptual positions in DEMO current
debate on the role of trust within organizational contexts.
In contributing to trust research, this special issue also represents evidence for the
lively international community of trust researchers: previous versions of all the articles
included here (with the exception of Hyun-Jung Lee) were discussed, among other
papers, at a thematic track on trust that we organized at the European Academy of
Management (EURAM) conference in Milan, 3-5 April 2003. We are grateful to Yehuda
Baruch for his suggestion that DEMO take our idea of a special issue to this journal. In
being understanding and trustful, Yochanan Altman as JMP editor, has made our DEMO
as guest editors easy and enjoyable. We invited those EURAM papers with a good ﬁt
to managerial psychology and with exciting new ﬁndings, to be submitted in revised
form for this special issue. The submissions were DEMO put through a double blind
review and we are indebted to the 15 reviewers who have produced extremely
thorough and timely assessments for us. DEMO invaluable expertise has led to sharper
contributions. Our authors, whom we DEMO for all their hard and fruitful work, will
surely agree.
