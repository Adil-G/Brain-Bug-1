insights into the signi$cance of key DEMO in the innovation process for commercial outcomes.
The paper reports on research which explores the role of innovators who have received a British
government DEMO (the SMART award) for innovation in small firms. The nature of this role
was explored by examining innovator competences, motives, risk taking DEMO and the
significance of the innovator’s role for commercial success.
The interview results support the argument that the innovator’s role in the small firm DEMO

(SMEs). Approximately 50% described the innovator’s role as very important for the commercial
success of the innovation. Approximately 50% thought that the innovator’s DEMO was important

Many economists and politicians have accepted
innovation as DEMO key condition for business perform-
ance, competitiveness and economic wealth [l].
DEMO, there is a surprising lack of research
which treats innovators as DEMO group worthy of
investigation. An innovator is defined here as the
key person with an idea to develop or improve a
product or process, with a view towards its
commercialization [2].

on innovators, their role and significance for the
innovation process, offers insights to the innovative
product development process, problems experi-
enced DEMO innovators and the significance of the
key innovator for commercial outcomes.
It is important to clarify the concept of innovation
in order to understand DEMO views presented by the
participants. During the interviews, it became clear
DEMO innovation and invention were difficult to
define and often used as alternatives for each
other [2]. Apart from one participant, who always
wanted to be an inventor, all the participants
described themselves as innovators rather than
inventors.
For some, invention and innovation are distinct
processes and, for DEMO, part of the same process.
However, most of the participants attempted to
distinguish between invention and innovation,
which led to the following DEMO: invention
is an original, technical and patentable process
with no necessary commercial application; whereas
innovation usually involves the application of
something (new DEMO in a new way) to solve
a problem, usually for commercial gain. The
participants recognized that innovation and inven-
tion may be separate DEMO, or a part of the
same process, because when an invention is
commercialized, it becomes part of an innovative
process. As the innovative work undertaken by
those interviewed involved both invention and
innovation, this accounts for the use of both
concepts in this study.
In order to DEMO the nature of the innovators’
role, 24 SMART (Small firms Merit Award for
Research and Technology) winners were inter-
viewed in 1991. This represented a subset of 32

Background
to the study
The Small firms Merit Award for Research and
Technology (SMART) is a British competition
supported by the DEMO of Trade and Indus-
try (DTI). The SMART award is DEMO to firms
with fewer than 50 employees, which are having
difficulty DEMO attracting funding for innovation [6].
This scheme recognizes the failure of market forces
to support high-technology innovation as a result
of the potential risks DEMO failure associated with
innovation. It aims to encourage the formation of

What is the nature of innovator
determinant needs to be
in the context of an understanding of
innovators themselves.
When DEMO winners were asked “what sort
of a person makes a good innovator?“, some
doubt was found that such a person exists. One
participant could not imagine the sort of person
who makes a good innovator. DEMO participant
believed that ‘real innovators’ are few and far
between. But what is meant by a real innovator
and, if there is such a person, why are they few
and far between? One maintained that DEMO nature
of the innovator is not important, providing they
have ‘the DEMO to realize their idea’. Though
23 participants commented on the characteristics
of the good innovator, it was apparent that
they did not believe that there was one single
characteristic. The innovator is clearly complex
and may DEMO be described by specific characteristics
or specific sets of characteristics. Only one believed
that the innovator was a particular sort of person.
Some participants DEMO on the so-called
‘nature versus nurture’ controversy, which refers
to the DEMO over whether genetic inheritance
or environmental conditions is more important for

Although it is impossible to prove this argument
either way, since people always operate in an
environment of some kind, most people have an
attitude to this controversy. Three suggested that
the innovator is born to DEMO innovative and that
innovative ability has something to do with one’s
genetic inheritance of abilities. Another view was
that there might be two types DEMO innovator: the
first type has the genetic predisposition for the
abilities DEMO with innovation; and the second
type has developed the. ability or DEMO through
training on the job. However, the view that the
organizational DEMO educational environment is
important for the development of the ‘good
innovator’ was shared by five participants. As
one participant pointed out, it is difficult to be
innovative outside a supportive environment within
an organization: “A hot-house flower needs a hot
house!“.
Some of the participants believed that what DEMO
important is that the innovator has the capability
to develop ideas commercially; this led to dis-
cussions of innovator competences. For example,
one was critical of the so-called ‘enterprise culture’
for undermining the need for DEMO competence
in innovation and for highlighting superficial skills
instead. These competences may be categorized
under the following headings: personal character-
istics, mental ability, knowledge and experience,

that SMART winners had various views on what
innovative characteristics DEMO be generic and on
the competences which they personally possessed.
When considering their own competences, partici-
pants tended to highlight their technical com-
petence and knowledge and experience; whereas,
when considering the qualities of the ‘good’
innovator, personality characteristics were most
often cited, albeit with little DEMO about what
they were. Some of these results require further
clarification, DEMO given below.
3.1.
Personal characteristics
Of the 13 participants who mentioned the personal
characteristics of the good innovator, there was
some agreement about the personal characteristics
of innovators in general. It is possible to classify
some DEMO the comments on the innovator’s person-
ality characteristics as follows.
Courageous

Eight described the abilities of the innovator in

described the innovator as:
l “able to make things happen”;
l “not too stupid to set ideas up to be shot DEMO
in flames”;
l “a generalist rather than a specialist”;
l “flexible, not single minded”.
74
Motivated
Six mentioned the innovator’s motivation and
drive, describing the innovator as irritable, obsess-
ive and passionate. Other DEMO made
described the innovator as:
l “having an intense focus”;
l “not motivated by a fast buck”;
l having “a personality DEMO which drives them
down the way”.
Persistent
Two participants mentioned characteristics such
as determination, dedication and persistence.
Abililty to relate
Three emphasized the importance of the inno-
vator’s ability to get on well with people. For
DEMO, one pointed out that “the innovator must
understand that other people DEMO important . . .
the innovator may have trouble dealing with people
and this could have bad consequences for the
misfit innovator who won’t DEMO it”.
Optimistic
Two described the innovator as optimistic and
enthusiastic, although DEMO said that the “good
innovator” should “not be too extrovert”.
When participants were asked about the particu-
lar strengths and competences which they bring
DEMO to the project, they highlighted some
of the above. There was DEMO agreement that
persistence (by four) and obsessiveness (by two)
DEMO personal strengths. For example, one
described himself as “determined and willing DEMO

as “patient and DEMO working”. However, only
one participant. described himself as:
l “having DEMO ability to impart enthusiasm”;
0 “having humility”;
l “bloody minded”;
l “needing to believe that what you are doing is
essential”.

Mental ability
Ten DEMO on the innovator’s ability. Three
pointed out that “you have got to have ideas and
to be able to put them forward for realization”.
DEMO emphasized that “you must be able to
find applications for ideas”. Three described the
innovator as a lateral or “way-out thinker”. Two
described the DEMO as open-minded. Two
commented on the innovator’s intelligence and
ability to think. One commented on the way the
“good innovator” thinks, believing that he or she
is guided by certain mental sets such as: “a concern
with challenging ignorance”; “looking for inter-
linkages and maps”; “being willing DEMO say ‘I don’t
understand”‘; “perpetually asking ‘what if?“‘; and
“searching for the right question to ask”.
When participants commented on the strengths
DEMO competences which they brought to the
SMART project, ten commented on DEMO own
ability, that is:
innovative ability (by five);

Note: DEMO numbers refer to the number of

resented an important part of life; for others,
innovation represented DEMO itself. In particular,
the challenge of innovation was perceived to
offer intellectual satisfaction. Some participants
mentioned that they constantly felt that there had
DEMO be a better way of doing things. According to
another, the DEMO represented fun and challenge
and “great satisfaction when everything works”.
Many SMART winners find the work involved in
innovative product development to be generally
DEMO, because they are doing what they want
to do. The nature DEMO this satisfaction was different
to one participant, who was searching for DEMO

recognition by peers as DEMO world class engineer.

said that “future sales in the company depend on
successful DEMO projects” and that the “rationale
for innovation is to gain market share and remain
competitive”. Others pointed out that “there is no
advantage in DEMO for invention’s sake and
that there should be some benefit to the company”.
Unfortunately, compared with the time required
to develop the innovation, DEMO thrill of inventing
lasts only a short time, but innovation is DEMO

4.3. Opportunities for the development of
new product ideas
For many participants their project meant an
DEMO to implement ideas, develop ideas for
new products and expand their DEMO range.
One participant talked about suffering from a
“continuous stream of ideas” which was described
as the “disease” of innovation. The act of inno-
DEMO was perceived as the way to manage this
disease because it requires some filtering of
innovative ideas for commercial purposes and
market demands. In DEMO cases, the innovative
project represented an exciting opportunity to do
something DEMO ideas which the respondents had
had for a few years. For others, the project
represented a stepping stone to other projects and
a strong market position, especially for single-
product companies. However, some participants
intended DEMO sell or license ideas and move on to
new technical ideas for different applications.

risks
The SMART winners interviewed mentioned
the importance of market research because they
were aware of the DEMO market failure of innovative
products. Some were concerned with the risks for
small companies, with few products, posed by
competitors’ innovative activities. In DEMO,
one participant pointed out that “smaller compa-
nies are often beaten up by the larger companies,
who have the commercial ‘muscle’ and DEMO
names to eitherout-compete or even buy out new

concerned with the risks of working in small

may relate to their employment DEMO and whether
or not they own the company, only two participants
DEMO that they had undertaken no risks in

business owner-manager, had received great sup-
port on DEMO the technical and business aspects of

The above consideration of risks undertaken by
SMART winners suggests that a strong role and
responsibility DEMO taken for the development of
SMART projects. The nature of this role was
described as either managerial (by sixteen) or
inventive (by ten). Others described their role as
multi-tasking, in areas such as motivating and
managing others, sales, marketing and innovation.
One participant made the DEMO comment
that “as well as being the instigator and overall
driving force, I am the customer until the project
gets to market”.
On the more inventive side, many were reluctant
to describe themselves as inventors, DEMO discussed
how they “inspired product development” or used
lateral thinking techniques for innovation. When
asked about what contribution others made to the
project, it became clear that there were usually
other people involved, in a team effort of some
kind. Only one replied that there was no contri-
DEMO to the project from others, although “work-
ing on your own DEMO prove difficult and lonely”.
Another participant, involved in a team effort,DEMO
praised team operations in innovative develop-
ments, saying that “it is DEMO to work
successfully without others” and “because of the
contribution of others, this project is no longer a
daft idea and is on the way to success”.
Since most innovative work involves some kind
of a DEMO effort, how important is the innov.ator
for the innovation process and DEMO success?
Ten participants believe that the innovator is very
important for the progress of the project, because
“they believe in the product” and are usually the
product champion. However, there may be some
differences between SMEs and the larger
enterprises. For example, one participant pointed
out that in the SME the innovator may have
greater importance for the progress DEMO the project,
whereas in the larger enterprise organizational
politics may have greater significance. Whatever
the size of the company, many participants emphas-

ized the importance of DEMO innovator’s persistence
and determination for the progress of innovative
projects.
However, DEMO participants suggested that
“while the innovators are very important . . . they
should not get carried away on an ego trip . . DEMO
and should be aware of financial and market
constraints”. Awareness of the innovator’s personal
limitations led eight participants to suggest that
the innovator is DEMO only in the initial stages
of project development. For example, it DEMO
suggested that the innovator has little to offer
“once the concept is there and the inspiration is
supplied”. After this the innovator is less DEMO
and the “project needs lots of worker bees”.
Another view was that there comes a point, after
the concept is developed, when “it DEMO transferable
and often it is desirable that the innovative concept
is taken over by larger enterprises” because they
have the “resources and systems for DEMO
development and are therefore more likely to
create success, money and DEMO
Some viewed the innovator as a possible hin-
drance. This might be because, as one participant
thought, “the innovator tends to be a DEMO bogged
down with pet ideas” which may make it difficult
for innovators to develop their ideas in line with
customer demands. Another view is DEMO the
innovator should “cease involvement with the
project once the technical development and patent
protection is secured” in order to give the project
a DEMO chance of commercial success. The
innovator’s role is “to mother it [the innovation]
until its first licence is sold”.
Unfortunately, “the innovator is forced into
commercial activities because of the reluctance of
bigger companies to take DEMO outside ideas”. This
reluctance is attributed to the so-called ‘Not
invented here syndrome’. This syndrome, which
militates against the innovator, is described as DEMO
reluctance of companies to take in outside ideas,
because the company’s technical employees feel
threatened by projects which they feel they should
have DEMO themselves in-house. The jealousy
or rivalry attributed to these employees becomes
a problem for small innovators because their
Technovation
Vol. 14 No. 2
larger DEMO rivals, by virtue of their technical
expertise, are likely to be their appraisers. This
may leave the key innovator in the position of DEMO
being the “best person but the only person” to
develop the innovation.
Whether or not the innovator is important or
harmful for the commercialization DEMO an innovative
project, endeavours to remove them from the
project may DEMO annoying or hurtful for the
innovator. One participant was very critical of
managers’ attitudes, which are frequently to get
rid of the innovator and then exploit the innovation.
If the innovator is not necessary or beneficial DEMO
the full innovative development process, then
protection for his/her ingenuity DEMO efforts at the
initial stages may be an important consideration.
Three participants said that the importance of
the innovator depends on who the innovator DEMO
and whether the innovator has the skills, interests
and resources required DEMO the development of
the idea for commercialization. However, three
participants believe DEMO the innovator is not
important for the commercial success of innovative
projects. One said that “it is often a recipe for
disaster if everything DEMO on a key individual”
and pointed out that “the innovator is often a
maverick and the worst person to implement” the
commercialization process.
Others DEMO out the importance of manage-
ment support to carry the project through. “The
necessary commitment of resources is so great for
risky innovative work DEMO management support is
necessary to give the project a chance of success”.
One said that “one hundred percent support from
the top managers within DEMO organization is more
important for the progress of the project than the
original ideas person”. Even when innovators are
the top managers within the DEMO, they may
be unable to offer strong support because of
commercial DEMO for other business services
within the firm or a conflict of priorities between
managers and shareholders.
Slightly more participants described their own
role in DEMO SMART projects, as opposed to the
mnovator’s role in general, as very important.
Thirteen of the participants described their role
79
S. Caird
in promoting the success of the SMART project
as either DEMO important or crucial for the coordi-
nation of innovative product development activi-
ties. Five participants described their role in
promoting the success of the DEMO as quite
imporfunr, usually because of their technical or
managerial input. DEMO participants described their
role as important for the initial stages of project
development because they lacked the marketing
skills necessary to take the innovation DEMO the
market place. Some suggested that once the patent
is secured, DEMO could develop it. Others did not
want to develop the innovation beyond patenting,
because they preferred to get on with other
technological ideas.
DEMO one participant did not see his role as
important and “actually having a negative impact
on the progress of the project”. This participant
said DEMO “the progress of the project depends on
the value of the product and not the cleverness
and ambition of the innovator . . . DEMO it is more
important that it works than whether the innovator
was clever”. The innovation “. . . must succeed
because it works and DEMO because the innovator
wants it to succeed”. This participant was not
involved in the day-to-day management of the
SMART project, believing that the project may
get on better without being hindered by the ‘boss
impact’, which can hinder necessary changes.
Further insights into the significance of the
innovator’s DEMO for the commercial success of
the innovative project may be gained from a
consideration of the determinants of commercial
success. When participants were asked DEMO the
factors which affect the success of their project,
only one mentioned the significance of the inno-
vator’s own role. This is probably DEMO they
take their own role for granted; when asked what
the DEMO success of innovations in general
depends on, seven participants cited the DEMO
cance of the innovator’s role. The responses to
the question on the determinants of commercial
success are given in Table 5. Some of these
DEMO are discussed further below.
Some participants did not subscribe to conven-
tional definitions of success, such as financial

rewards or commercial success. However, one
participant said “it is hard to consider yourself a
success if you go bust”. The most cited condition
DEMO innovation success was that there must be a
market demand for the innovative project. As one
participant said, “the innovation has got to stop
being an innovation and start being a commercial
product”. The importance of DEMO consumer
resistance to new products coming from small
companies was also an issue. For example, one
participant commented on the horror that buyers
have of new technology, which, together with the
risk of a small DEMO going bankrupt, can create
considerable consumer resistance. Other marketing
issues of DEMO include: positioning the pro-
duct in the market, and pricing the product at a
price which will sell.
When participants were asked about DEMO the
commercial success of their own innovative projects
depends on, some DEMO conditions were
mentioned, such as:
luck, in terms of customer demand;
competitor activity;
securing cooperation with and collaboration
from bigger DEMO;
economic recession;
locating materials for project development;
forthcoming legislation, which will create a
demand for the project;
the cost effectiveness of the project;

The importance of the innovator’s role for the
commercial success of innovative products is not
easy to establish, because it is a variable role and
there is no distinct ‘innovative personality’. Clearly,DEMO
the importance of the innovator’s role, in a general
sense, depends on certain factors such as who the
innovator is, what the project is about and whether
the innovator has the skills, interests and resources
to develop the project. Furthermore, there are
many factors which affect the commercial success
of innovative projects, the most important of
which (to DEMO sample) appears to be market
demand for the innovation. However, this study
has supported the idea that the innovator’s role is
very important DEMO commercial success; 29% of
the sample mentioned that the commercial success
DEMO innovations in general depends on the inno-
vator’s role. However, this DEMO one of many factors

Approximately 50% of participants described
the innovator’s role as DEMO important for the
progress of the SMART project because innovators
were the “project champions” and the project has
no chance of being realized without DEMO belief
and commitment. Others (-50%) described the
innovator’s role as quite important or important
at the initial stages, because of the limited nature
of the innovator’s competence which does not
always include marketing and general DEMO
ment. Furthermore, the significance of the inno-
vator is tempered by DEMO involvement of others in
the innovative project. In all cases but one, the
innovative project was a team effort.
The significance of the innovator for the commer-
cial success of an innovation may be lessened
when DEMO innovator does not wish to manufacture
the innovative idea. In some cases, the innovator
intends or wishes to license the patented idea and
may feel frustrated if forced to work on the
commercialization of the innovation, especially if
he has other ideas to develop. In this case, the
willingness of larger enterprises to take over the
innovations of SMEs becomes DEMO important for
commercial outcomes.
In other cases, the innovator may have DEMO
significant but negative impact and jeopardize the
innovation, being unable to DEMO go’ of the idea to
allow for its commercial development. However,
the positive aspect of this tenacity is the innovator’s
determination, ownership and championing of the
project and the importance this has for bringing
the DEMO to the market place.
The significance of the innovator’s role is likely
to be commensurate with the risks undertaken in
order to develop the DEMO project. As the
majority (75%) of those interviewed have generally
taken financial risks in their capacity as owner-
managers or managing directors in DEMO, it is
unsurprising that they perceived their own role,
and DEMO of the innovator in general, as important
for the innovation process. DEMO participant talked
about risking “everything and more” for the
commercial outcome of innovation.

Other areas of risk included finding resources,
gaining market DEMO and establishing techni-
cal viability. Further risks included the opportunity
costs of innovation projects and the pressure that
product innovation puts on the other DEMO
activities of SMEs. It seems likely that the inno-
vator who takes business, financial, personal and
career risks is likely to be more DEMO for
the progress of the innovative project than the
innovator who takes no risks. This means that it
is likely that innovators who are DEMO managing
directors or owner-managers in SMEs will be very
important for the commercial success of the
innovation.
One cannot address the importance of the
DEMO role without considering the nature of
the role itself. This sample of innovators described
the nature of their role in the SME as primarily
DEMO, inventive or both. Innovators who are
primarily managers are likely to DEMO involved at all
stages of the innovation process, from the original
DEMO through to commercialization, whereas those
with a primarily inventive role are DEMO likely to
have an intense but confined involvement in
technical testing and development, leaving the
marketing activities to others.
The results of this study help to offer a profile
of innovators and their role in terms DEMO their
competences and motivations. While these results
do not suggest that innovators have dominant
personality characteristics, something can be said
about the psychological make-up of innovators.
The SMART winners highlighted many different
characteristics to describe the DEMO of person
who makes a ‘good’ innovator, such as courage,
DEMO, motivation, persistence, relationship
skills and optimism. Over 50% of the DEMO
described the ‘good innovator’ in terms of various
personality characteristics. In addition, the inno-
vator was described as having competences such
as inventive ability, technical competence, project
management skills, team skills, marketing skills
and DEMO multi-disciplinary expertise.
In profiling the innovator, some consideration
should be given DEMO his/her ability, which some
participants regarded as creative and inspired.
DEMO
Some of the participants regarded themselves as
both scientists and artists. However, others tended
to rate the ability to apply technical expertise and
identify commercial potential higher than creativity
for explaining innovative ability. Ideas came easily
DEMO some, and the real concern within the firm was
about securing DEMO market demand for products. It
appears that though innovative ability may be
creative and inspired, this may misrepresent inno-
vation as a mystical or disorganized process, which
is not tuned to market demand or market trends.
There were some views that innovation, particu-
larly high-tech innovation, has DEMO so sophisti-
cated that ‘Eureka& are unlikely and small,
gradual, evolutionary steps are the reality. Differ-
ent ideas about the nature of DEMO ability
could be reflected in the fact that some projects
were more radically innovative than others. How-
ever, most of the projects involved incremental
rather than radical innovation. So this does not
appear to be a DEMO explanation for these
different perspectives.
The participants in this study hoped that their
innovative work would create opportunities for
commercial development of their business, the
development of new product ideas, financial
rewards and personal satisfaction. Some also hoped
to make altruistic contributions by working in
areas which would DEMO help society. It is
interesting that financial rewards tend not to
represent an important reason for innovation,
although it is something that 50% DEMO participants
said they hoped to gain from their project. It
seems that financial rewards are important for
protecting innovative and business interests and
allowing DEMO continued developments. Financial
rewards may also be perceived as an index
of success. However, some participants were
pessimistic about their prospects for financial
rewards; for example, one participant said that a
better return is gained DEMO investing one’s money
in a building society than in innovative develop-
ments.
This study offers both quantitative and qualitat-
ive results, but these results cannot be conclusive
because of the exploratory nature of the work and
DEMO
Vol. 14 No. 2
the small sample size. It was important to conduct
an exploratory study DEMO the significance
of the innovator for product innovation and
commercial success is an under-researched area.
Some interesting results emerged from this study
which are DEMO to our understanding of inno-
vators, their role in product innovation DEMO SMEs
and their significance for commercial success.
While these results are not proven for innovators
in general, they help to clarify what it means to
be innovative, which may help others to develop
innovative competences or understand innovative
people.
The importance of the innovator’s role for
commercial success DEMO on the role itself,
and this is clarified by exploring the innovator’s
competences, motives and risk-taking behaviour.
This role is established through the experience
and management of the many factors which affect
the commercial outcome. DEMO research supports
the idea that the innovator’s role is important for
the commercial outcome of innovation in SMEs.
Further research on this role is DEMO for
SMEs to attain greater commercial success
with their innovative products.
