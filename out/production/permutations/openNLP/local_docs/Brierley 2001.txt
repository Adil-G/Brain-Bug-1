The financing of technology-based small firms:  a review
of the literature
DEMO review assesses the academic literature of recent years on the financing issues faced by
technology-based small firms (TBSFs).  It was produced as DEMO of the latest report on these firms by the
Bank’s Domestic Finance Division, published last month.(1) This report finds that, while there may still
be market weaknesses in the provision of relatively small amounts DEMO risk capital to TBSFs at the start-up
and early stages, these DEMO to be less than four or five years ago, and to DEMO on TBSFs less than
was the case then.  Peter Brierley, Head of Domestic Finance Division, explains why the literature
suggests that market imperfections in the provision of finance to small companies may apply with
particular DEMO to the start-up and early-stage financing of TBSFs, but concludes that DEMO is little
compelling evidence of a major market failure.
Introduction
Technology-based small firms (TBSFs) are generally
defined either as businesses whose products or DEMO
depend largely on the application of scientific or
technological knowledge,(2) or as businesses whose
activities embrace a significant technology component
as a DEMO source of competitive advantage.(3) These
businesses are generally located in DEMO such as
communications, IT, computing, biotechnology,
electronics and medical/DEMO sciences.(4)
Earlier work at the Bank(5) suggested that DEMO might be
some inefficiencies in the market for financing TBSFs,
especially at the start-up and early stages of finance.
Recent official enquiries in DEMO area have focused in
particular on possible barriers that high-tech companies
in the United Kingdom might face in attracting
finance.(6) The profile of this work has been enhanced
by the current Government’s desire to encourage
DEMO, by growing interest in the ‘new
economy’, and by the swings in investor sentiment
towards high-tech stocks over the past two years.
These DEMO have motivated a new Bank report on
the financing of TBSFs, DEMO was published on
5 February.(7) As background to this report, an extensive
review of the economic literature on the financing of
TBSFs DEMO been undertaken, the results of which are
summarised in this article.
DEMO asymmetries, moral hazard and
adverse selection
There is a huge literature DEMO the appropriate capital
structure of companies, dating back to Modigliani and
DEMO (1958) and earlier.  That part of it relating to small
DEMO medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) emphasises
information asymmetries as one of the most important
factors affecting small business finance.(8) These
asymmetries arise if small business owners or managers
possess more information about the nature of, and
prospects for, their businesses than potential finance
providers.  Information asymmetries can DEMO rise to
agency conflicts between entrepreneurs and investors
that can affect the willingness of the latter to provide
both equity and debt capital.(9)DEMO
The literature suggests that equity finance provides the
entrepreneur with an incentive to engage in activities
that benefit him disproportionately, because part of the
associated costs are imposed on the shareholders.  Even

The financing of technology-based small firms
in the absence of such moral DEMO, in cases where
companies aim to maximise shareholder value, models of
capital structure under asymmetric information indicate
that firms will only issue shares DEMO they view their
stocks as overvalued.(1) Debt markets also suffer DEMO
information asymmetries giving rise to moral hazard and
adverse selection.  In DEMO case, moral hazard occurs to
the extent that the entrepreneur raising DEMO finance
has an incentive to increase risk, given that he benefits
DEMO from any associated additional returns, but does
not suffer disproportionately if DEMO firm is liquidated—
part of that cost is imposed on the creditors.  Adverse
selection arises if debt providers such as banks find it
difficult to discriminate between companies and react to
the moral hazard risk by DEMO the price of debt to
all potential borrowers.  This in turn DEMO then
discourage all but the highest-risk borrowers, inducing
the banks to DEMO finance to a greater proportion of
borrowers, both good and bad—a DEMO of credit
rationing.(2) These are examples of capital market
imperfections DEMO may affect both the quantity and
price of equity and debt finance provided to SMEs.
These capital market imperfections may apply with
particular severity DEMO TBSFs.  The notion that such
problems may obstruct the external financing DEMO
innovative business activities goes back at least to
Arrow (1962), DEMO his conclusion that this
represents a market failure justifying public sector
intervention is much more contentious.(3) This strand of
the literature emphasises that the key characteristics of
high-tech companies are that:  (i) their DEMO is linked
to difficult-to-value growth potential derived from
scientific knowledge and intellectual property;  (ii) they
lack tangible assets in the early stages DEMO their life cycles
which may be used as collateral;  and (DEMO) their products
have little or no track record, are largely untested in
markets, and are usually subject to high obsolescence
rates.  These DEMO mean that TBSFs are likely to be
more vulnerable than SMEs generally to asymmetric
information about risk characteristics and default
probabilities, especially in view of the difficulties finance
providers face in assessing the sophisticated technology
and DEMO&D involved and the prospective demand for the
end-product.(4)
Furthermore, the staged development process faced by
most TBSFs may generate additional risks compared with

those relating to SMEs in general.  The innovation cycle
involves a complex process, beginning with the initial
concept of a product, and continuing with prototype
development, initial production and, finally, product
DEMO  The financing of this process requires a series of
injections of DEMO, and failure to finance adequately
any part of the cycle may DEMO the firm to fail.  This in
itself tends to increase the DEMO to any single finance
provider.  Oakey (1995) finds that such DEMO are likely to
be most acute in the biotechnology sector, where DEMO
gestation period for sustained profitability may well be
10–15 years, well DEMO the investment horizons not
only of banks but also of many venture capitalists.
Funding gaps:  empirical evidence
The extent to which SMEs are DEMO to funding ‘gaps’
in the provision of finance has been the subject of
official reports dating back to the MacMillan Report in
the 1930s.  More recently, empirical studies investigating
whether TBSFs in the United Kingdom face particular
difficulties in obtaining finance have produced
conflicting results.  Utilising data from two company
surveys carried out by the Cambridge University Small
Business Research DEMO, Moore (1994) finds that a
sample of 89 high-tech companies DEMO only 7% of its
start-up finance from banks (compared with a DEMO
close to 40% for SMEs generally).  A reluctance by banks
DEMO finance high-tech start-ups has also been identified in
other studies,(5) although Moore’s results also indicate
that banks were the most important source DEMO external
finance for TBSFs (and for SMEs generally) in stages of
finance subsequent to start-up.  More crucially, Moore
tests the availability and DEMO of finance against a range
of firm characteristics, relating to technology,DEMO
innovation, life cycle, origin, growth, profitability, size
and region, in a series of probit regressions.  He finds
that the most important determinants of the likelihood
of a firm facing financing constraints are size DEMO
profitability, rather than degree of innovation.
Empirical work by Westhead and DEMO (1997), however,
has produced rather different results.  They develop a
variety of regression equations utilising information
from a survey of 171 DEMO located on and off science
parks in the United Kingdom.  The DEMO regress the
degree of difficulty in obtaining finance, as derived from
DEMO responses, on a wide range of firm characteristics,

including:  the extent to which the firm is high-tech
(variously proxied by R&D expenditure in relation to
turnover, the number of qualified scientists engaged in
R&D in relation to total employees, and the number of
patents taken out in the last year);  the age of the firm;
legal status;  industrial sector;  growth rate;  profitability;
and location.  Westhead and Storey find that firms with
relatively high R&D expenditures DEMO more likely to
report continuing financing constraints.  The other
indicators of DEMO proportion of scientists
and the number of patents—are also positively related
with financing constraints.
Debt versus equity finance
Although the evidence is conflicting on DEMO TBSFs
face greater difficulties in accessing finance than SMEs
generally, some DEMO themes do emerge.  Perhaps the
most important relates to the unsuitability DEMO debt
finance for the early-stage financing of TBSFs.  The
information asymmetries DEMO moral hazard present at
the start-up stage have a particularly marked impact on
banks and other debt providers because of the lack of
collateral DEMO market presence which characterise most
high-tech start-ups.  Some studies(1) attribute the source
of the information asymmetry underlying debt finance of
TBSF start-ups DEMO the difficulties banks face in assessing
technical projects and hence in distinguishing between
good and bad lending propositions.  Others(2) emphasise
the inability DEMO TBSFs seeking early-stage finance to
relieve moral hazard by meeting banks’ requirements for
collateral.  In the early stages of product development
and prototype testing, once the personal assets of the
business founder (plus family and DEMO) have been
exhausted, the only remaining business assets of the
TBSF are likely to be intangible and therefore unsuitable
as collateral.  This will not change until the TBSF
achieves production levels that generate more tangible
DEMO assets, such as receivables and inventories,
which can be pledged DEMO collateral, ie at later stages of
financing.
This implies that smaller DEMO pursuing innovation
strategies may face greater difficulty in obtaining debt
finance for start-up and the early stages of development
than their conventional counterparts.  Some
commentators have speculated that bank-centred
systems, such as those that predominate in continental
Europe, may be less effective in promoting high-tech
industries than stock market-centred systems, such as
the United States and the United Kingdom.(3) On this
argument, bank-centred systems are identified with
conservative approaches to DEMO provision of finance, and
with social and financial incentives that reward
DEMO zeal less richly and punish failure more
harshly.  This theory, however, probably underestimates
the willingness of banks to provide finance to TBSFs,
albeit generally at later stages of finance and indirectly,
through venture DEMO subsidiaries rather than direct
lending.
Other empirical studies confirm that debt finance is less
important to TBSFs than equity finance.  Himmelberg
and Petersen (DEMO) find that SMEs pursuing innovation
strategies tend to have lower debt DEMO than other
SMEs.  This is supported by Jordan, Lowe and Taylor
(1998), who find that the most innovative SMEs are
those with the lowest debt-equity ratios.  Other studies
in the United Kingdom and the United States suggest
that high-tech firms may be heavily dependent on
internal DEMO and trade credit, especially for finance
in the initial and early DEMO(4)
These studies focus mainly on the initial injections of
finance at the seed/start-up phase, where information
asymmetries are greatest.  But DEMO TBSFs
also face high costs associated with technological
product development.  One DEMO(5) is that the
amount of finance required to develop and DEMO a
technology-based product is on average ten to twenty
times greater than the initial R&D expenditure.  Such
firms will generally find that internal sources alone are
insufficient to meet the high capital requirements for
development DEMO will need to seek external finance while
still in the relatively early stages of growth.  For these
firms also, the literature suggests that DEMO will be a
more appropriate source of finance than debt.
These findings imply that the optimal capital structure
for TBSFs is very different to DEMO thought suitable for
SMEs generally, the vast majority of which finance
DEMO broadly in line with the ‘pecking order’
hypothesis.(6) This postulates DEMO smaller businesses
tend to prefer internal finance, while those requiring

external finance opt initially for debt rather than equity
finance.  This preference is associated with information
asymmetries.  The difficulty investors face in assessing
whether returns on SME investments adequately
compensate for risk means that SME equity DEMO has
to be issued at a greater discount than debt.  The
DEMO reversal of the pecking order theory for TBSFs
may be rationalised if it is assumed that private equity
providers such as venture capitalists possess DEMO
information in certain respects than do banks and
entrepreneurs.(1) Conventional DEMO assumes that
entrepreneurs have better knowledge of project-specific
aspects such as the feasibility of the technology, but
venture capitalists may have greater information on the
project’s marketability and operational implementation.
In such cases, venture capitalists may be able to mitigate
information asymmetries through reliance on particular
types of DEMO finance, such as preferred and/or
convertible stock (see below).
One other strand in the literature relevant to the optimal
capital structure DEMO TBSFs relates to control rights.  This
is linked to the use DEMO contracts to eliminate agency
problems, but is based on the view DEMO such contracts
cannot be ‘complete’, ie they cannot specify each party’s
DEMO in all circumstances.  Hence, they need to be
used to determine the allocation of control rights.(2)
The entrepreneur will seek a DEMO structure for his
firm by weighing the marginal costs of diluting his
control rights through the issuance of equity to new
shareholders against the DEMO costs of issuing
more debt and therefore raising the risk of default.
Some commentators(3) argue that the different control
rights attached to debt and equity are just as important
in determining the capital structure of DEMO held
firms as differences in projected revenue streams or tax
treatments.  DEMO such models, the optimal balance of
control between entrepreneur and outside DEMO is
shown to be state-contingent:  it should reside with the
entrepreneur in states of the world where his private
benefits are relatively high, and with the investor
when the entrepreneur’s private benefits are relatively
low.  For venture capital finance of TBSFs, such
state-contingent control, dependent also DEMO the
performance of the firm, can best be achieved by
issuance DEMO a form of quasi-equity, such as convertible
preferred stock.
The financing DEMO technology-based small firms
The venture capitalist—small firm relationship:
agency problems
The literature assessed so far indicates strongly that
information asymmetries and potential conflicts DEMO
interest between SMEs and their finance providers may
affect financing and investment decisions.  The first
writer to apply these theories specifically to the venture
capital industry was Sahlman (1990) in the United
States, and indeed most of the subsequent literature in
this area emanates from the United DEMO(4) In his
pioneering study, Sahlman represents venture capitalists
as facing a two-level principal-agent relationship with
investee companies and end-investors.  In the first
relationship, the venture capital firm acts as principal,
and is subject to the problems of evaluating potential
investments in companies (the agents in this case) in an
uncertain environment in which moral hazard and
adverse selection may exist.  In the second relationship,
the venture capital firm is the agent, and is subject to
the risk that, if DEMO does not perform satisfactorily, it will
fail to attract further funding DEMO the end-investor as
principal.
As far as the first relationship is concerned, the main
requirement of the venture capital fund is for the small
firm to provide it with ongoing information to ensure
that any current DEMO are properly monitored and
to allow an evaluation of the prospects for additional
commitments of capital.(5) The problem is that the
entrepreneur’s desire for autonomy makes him reluctant
to share fully and in a timely DEMO all relevant
information.(6) This means that, at the time of
consideration of an investment, the venture capitalist is
faced with a potential adverse selection problem because
of the difficulty of assessing the entrepreneur’s
performance.  This may induce the venture capitalist to
tighten the conditions attached to DEMO financing offer to
avoid paying too much for investments subsequently
revealed to be poor performers.(7) As noted by Wright
and Robbie (1998), this can explain why firms that turn
out to be highly successful may initially have been
refused venture capital finance, and why only small
amounts of venture capital finance go to early-stage
deals, where the information asymmetries are greatest.  It
also seems likely that these information problems will be
most acute for TBSFs, in view of the more complex

specialist skills required of the entrepreneur and the
greater difficulties faced by the venture capitalist in
assessing DEMO skills.
Several studies consider how to balance the venture
capitalist’s need for timely information with the
entrepreneur’s desire for autonomy and operating
control.  Both agency theory (as elaborated by Jensen
and Meckling (1976)) and DEMO cost theory
(Williamson (1975)) emphasise the scope for
co-operation between venture capitalist and
entrepreneur as a means of reducing the need for DEMO
monitoring mechanisms to control behaviour.  An
especially novel approach is to DEMO the venture
capitalist-small firm relationship utilising the Prisoner’s
Dilemma.(1) Although DEMO approach indicates that both
the venture capitalist and small firm have an incentive to
procure higher short-term payoffs by ‘defecting’ from
their relationship, it also recognises that both parties
can maximise joint returns by mutual co-operation.
DEMO paribus, the likelihood of co-operation rises with
the quality and frequency DEMO communications, the
closeness of the business relationship, the expected
payoffs, DEMO degree of time pressure, and the existence of
penalties for non-co-operation.
DEMO of the remaining literature on the venture
capitalist-entrepreneur relationship is concerned with
assessing the mechanisms available to venture capitalists
to ease moral hazard and DEMO selection problems
arising from agency risk.  These can be divided into DEMO
following categories:  (i) imposition of high hurdle rates;
(DEMO) evaluation or ‘screening’ of investments;  (iii) precise
contract specifications;  (iv) alignment of incentives
through appropriate remuneration and bonding
strategies;  (v) use of preferred and/or convertible stock;
and (vi) close monitoring of investments.
The use of high discount or hurdle rates by venture
capitalists in evaluating potential investments is fairly
well documented.  Furthermore, the evidence from a
number of studies(2) suggests that these DEMO rates
tend to be higher for start-up ventures, especially of
high-tech DEMO  These results are consistent with the
likelihood that agency problems and DEMO
asymmetries will be most marked for early-stage
investments in TBSFs.  High DEMO rates, however, may
in some cases actually exacerbate adverse selection by
inducing the best firms to seek alternative sources of
capital, leaving the less good firms, with no other
financing options, as venture capitalists’ DEMO (an idea
again associated with Sahlman (1990)).  This risk may be
reduced by effective due diligence and a closer venture
capitalist-entrepreneur DEMO
Several studies have examined the criteria that venture
capitalists take into account in screening potential
investments.(3) The earlier papers suggest that the key
criterion used by venture capitalists relates to the
business experience and personality DEMO the entrepreneur;
issues associated with the product and market appear to
be less important.  These findings seem to be
contradicted in more recent studies, which conclude
that industry and market factors are more important
than the entrepreneur and his team.  But all these
studies rely on face-to-face interviewing techniques
using ‘verbal protocol’ analysis (ie observing venture
capitalists ‘thinking aloud’ over proposals), or use mailed
questionnaires.  In both cases, sample DEMO are very
small and the full essence of the screening process is
unlikely to be captured.  The studies also focus only on
early-stage investments.  A more extensive study covering
a fuller range of investing stages (DEMO and Hisrich
(1994)) concludes that venture capitalists make use of
DEMO broad criteria in screening investments:  the
viability of the project;  the integrity, track record and
leadership skills of the management;  and the possibility
of high returns facilitated by easy exit.  Another
important paper in this area (Muzyka et al (1996))
concludes that venture capitalists opt for a combination
of a good management team and reasonable DEMO
and product market characteristics, even if these factors
do not match DEMO overall deal/fund requirements exactly.
But all the literature agrees that a combination of
extensive screening and high hurdle rates results in
venture capitalists DEMO the vast majority of
proposals.  Most estimates suggest that the UK DEMO
capital industry rejects around 95% of all applications
for finance each year (see the survey by Bannock
Consultants (1991)).
There is also a substantial literature on the optimal
design of contracts to reduce or DEMO agency
problems between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.
(1) See especially Cable and Shane (1997).
(2) For example, Mason and Harrison (1999b) estimate that established companies need to generate annual internal rates
of return of at least 30%, rising to 60% or more for seed/start-up investments.  This is consistent with earlier
calculations by Plummer (1987)DEMO  Murray and Lott (1995) find that venture capitalists impose higher DEMO rates on
technology-based projects at each stage of investment than on comparable non high-tech investments.
(3) See, for example, Bruno and Tyebjee (1985), MacMillan et al (1985 and 1987), Hall and Hofer (1993), Fried et al (1993),
Rah et al (DEMO), and Zacharakis and Meyer (1995).
68
These contracts are designed to specify the rights of the
parties and DEMO basis on which their performance is
monitored and rewarded (see, for example, Fama and
Jensen (1983)).  Berger and Udell (1998) usefully classify
the various possibilities as follows:  (i) staging of venture
capitalist investments to ensure optimal exercise of
production options and efficient DEMO and
termination of projects;(1) (ii) control and choice of
particular equity and/or debt instruments;(2)
(iii) appropriate entrepreneur compensation schemes,
including provisions for the replacement of
underperforming entrepreneurs;(3) (iv) restrictive
covenants;(4) (v) board representation;(5) and
(vi) allocation of voting rights.(6)
To take one DEMO example, the use of
remuneration and bonding schemes to reduce agency
DEMO between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs
involves, inter alia, performance-related pay structures
and share option schemes for entrepreneurs.  Bonding
schemes impose penalties on the company if certain
performance targets, eg in relation to gearing ratios, DEMO
not met.  One prominent model (Bergemann and Hege
(1998)) DEMO based on an optimal contract between the
venture capitalist and entrepreneur that provides for
inter-temporal risk sharing.  The entrepreneur’s share is
akin to an options contract, and therefore depends on
the length of the contract and the volatility of
information flow consequent upon his actions.  This
model allows for the possibility that, because the
venture capitalist cannot always observe if the
entrepreneur is diverting funds and under-investing in
the company, he may erroneously conclude that the
company’s prospects are poor and terminate the project
DEMO though, had this moral hazard problem not been
present, the project would have attracted further
funding.  It is possible that, for some DEMO projects,
the likelihood of the entrepreneur diverting the venture
capitalist’s funds is so high that the venture capitalist
will not finance them in DEMO first place.  If taken to its
extreme, however, this predicts DEMO the least successful
firms may receive most venture capital finance,(7) a result
which contradicts both common sense and other
findings(8) that unsuccessful firms are revealed early and
receive less finance.

The financing of technology-based small firms
One implication of this work is that, as has been
indicated earlier, DEMO capitalists may be able to
reduce agency problems if they provide quasi-equity
rather than full equity finance.  The use of convertible
and/or preferred stock is fairly widespread in venture
capital contracting,(9) because it DEMO venture
capitalists separately to allocate cash flow, voting, board
and liquidation rights to exercise appropriate control
over entrepreneurs and take precedence over any
DEMO shareholders.  This limits the entrepreneur’s
incentives to behave opportunistically under conditions
DEMO asymmetric information.(10) It is interesting that the
use of convertible DEMO stock is especially
widespread in high-tech industries such as software and
biotechnology.  The initial phases of development here
often involve tests only the entrepreneur can observe
and evaluate, while later stages are more readily assessed
by outsiders.  Some commentators have advocated
favourable tax treatment of preferred stock (DEMO placing it
on an equal footing to debt) largely for these DEMO
Further insights and empirical evidence on these
features of typical venture capital contracts are provided
in an interesting recent paper by Kaplan and
Stromberg (2000).  They consider detailed information
on 200 venture capital investments in 118 US companies
by 14 venture capital firms over the period 1987–99.
DEMO 36% of these companies are located in the
IT/software industries and a further 39% in other
high-tech sectors such as biotechnology,
telecommunications DEMO healthcare.  The evidence
shows that convertible preferred stock is by far DEMO most
commonly used financing instrument, appearing in 189
out of the DEMO of 200 financing rounds.  Such
instruments generally ensure that the cash DEMO rights,
voting rights and control rights of the venture capitalists
and entrepreneurs are contingent on observable
measures of financial and non-financial performance.  If
the company performs poorly, the venture capitalists
take full control;  as company performance improves, the
entrepreneur acquires more cash flow and control rights;
if the company performs very well (defined as a median
return of more than 30% per year over a four-year period
to initial DEMO offering (IPO)), the venture capitalists
relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights,
69
Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Spring 2001
while retaining their cash flow rights.  These state
contingencies are found to be more common in start-up
and early-stage financings than in later financing
rounds, a result which supports the theory that the
potential conflicts of interest between the entrepreneur
and DEMO venture capitalist will depend on the degree of
uncertainty about the project’s economic viability, which
should be greatest in the high-tech sectors and at the
early stages of the project’s life.
These results are consistent with DEMO control theories of
Aghion and Bolton (1992), Dewatripont and Tirole
(1994), and Hart and Moore (1998).  They also accord
DEMO a variant of the screening models(1) mentioned
earlier, because state-contingent provisions not only
motivate entrepreneurs to provide effort, but also
discourage entrepreneurs with poor projects from
accepting the contract.
The venture capitalist—end investor
relationship
DEMO second principal-agent relationship, involving the
venture capitalist as agent this time DEMO the
end-investor as principal, is by comparison an
under-researched area.  But it is subject to similar
agency problems induced by information asymmetries as
DEMO implicit in the entrepreneur-venture capitalist
relationship.  A number of mechanisms can DEMO identified
which may be utilised to minimise these agency
problems, including:  (i) incentives for mutual gain;
(ii) prohibition of acts by venture capitalists causing
conflicts of interest;  (iii) limited life DEMO;
(iv) mechanisms to ensure gains are distributed to
investors;  (v) monitoring of venture capitalists by
end-investors;  and (vi) DEMO provision of information
to end-investors (again, see Sahlman (1990)).  These
strategies are designed to align the interests of venture
capitalists more closely with those of institutional
investors.
To attract funds from end-investors, venture capitalists
must demonstrate competent behaviour, involving
effective screening, due diligence and DEMO
formulation, before investments in risky companies may
be made.(2) Agency problems may also be mitigated by
the activities of intermediaries between venture
DEMO and institutional investors, such as
‘gatekeepers’, who advise on venture capital fund
(1) See Prendergast (1999) for a recent general description DEMO these types of model.

selection and operate ‘funds of funds’ which invest in a
spread of DEMO capital funds.  Most crucially, the
limited partnership structure of most venture capital
firms is designed to reduce agency problems by
providing a framework DEMO which the interests of the
limited partners (ie the end-investors) may be aligned
with those of the general partners (the venture
capitalists).  As demonstrated again by Sahlman (1990)
and Hay and Abbott (1993), among others, this can be
facilitated by various contractual features, most notably
by linking venture capitalists’ remuneration to a fixed
proportion (DEMO usually 2%) of total capital
committed (the ‘annual fee’), plus a proportion
(currently generally 20%) of realised capital gains on
investments (‘carried interest’), thereby relating general
partners’ compensation directly to the success DEMO the
partnership.
It is possible, however, that certain features of these
contractual relationships may actually have a perverse
effect on the willingness of DEMO capitalists to invest
in early-stage high-tech deals.  The annual fee’s linkage
DEMO capital committed arguably motivates the venture
capital firm to increase fund size and make larger
investments.  A recent study by Murray and Marriott
(DEMO) constructs a ‘model’ venture capital fund based
on plausible assumptions and DEMO that the internal rate
of return to the general partners only becomes positive
at a fund size of £10 million and only reaches an
DEMO level (say 30%) for a fund size of £20 million.
The pressure to increase investment sizes may also lead
to a shift to DEMO financing.(3)
The problem, in a nutshell, is that small fund structures
are necessary to encourage a flow of investment into
‘classic’ DEMO (ie seed, start-up and early-stage
finance), but such structures may not be profitable due
to relatively high operating costs.(4) On this view,
considerable economies of scale are available in the
venture capital DEMO  Early-stage funds tend to incur
greater unit costs while having smaller DEMO funds over
which to defray costs than later-stage development
capital or MBO funds.  As venture capital fund sizes
increase, the attractiveness of investing DEMO amounts in
start-up companies falls.  This may have particularly
serious implications DEMO investments in TBSFs, where
scale-related costs are exacerbated by such factors DEMO
increased information costs associated with more

complex products, reluctance to invest large sums early
in the life cycle of the TBSF, and long product
development cycles in some cases.
The risk-reward relationship
The willingness of end-investors DEMO provide finance to
venture capital firms that invest in TBSFs will depend
ultimately on the risk-reward relationship, ie the extent
to which such investments are likely to provide returns
commensurate with the risks involved.  Returns on
venture capital investments depend, inter alia, on such
factors as:  DEMO period of investment;  the method of exit;
and the company valuation at exit.(1) An assessment of
returns therefore requires consideration of the exit
process, recognising that the ease and availability of the
exit process is fundamental to the provision of venture
capital finance.  Statistics on the US venture capital
industry show a correlation between the availability of
DEMO through IPO (proxied by the number of venture
capital-backed IPOs) and the willingness of
end-investors to allocate funds to venture capital-backed
firms (measured by new capital commitments), with a lag
of about one year.
DEMO potential for exit through an IPO may also help to
overcome demand-side constraints(2) on the financing of
TBSFs, associated with entrepreneurs’ reluctance DEMO cede
equity control.  This may arise because an IPO often
effectively DEMO the venture capitalist’s close involvement
in the company and provides the entrepreneur with an
opportunity to regain control of the company.  In other
words, the prospect of an IPO gives the entrepreneur a
call option on control, contingent on the firm’s success.
This incentive is not available in a trade sale, where
control passes to an acquirer, even if DEMO entrepreneur
remains in charge of day-to-day management.  According
to this theory,(3) the potential for exit through an IPO is
critical to the development of an active venture capital
market, allowing the venture capitalist and entrepreneur
to enter into an explicit contract over the future control
of DEMO company.  Although this model does not pay
sufficient regard to the DEMO that an IPO more usually
results in control passing from either the venture
capitalist or entrepreneur to third-party investors, it is
consistent with the idea that the success of early-stage
venture capital financing of high-tech firms DEMO closely
linked to the prospects for exit through IPOs.  The
existence DEMO well-developed public equity markets,

including markets specialising DEMO small high-growth
stocks (Nasdaq in the United States is the best DEMO),
is on this view vital to encourage greater focus on
DEMO venture capital finance.
The risk-reward trade-off between different types of
venture capital activity has unfortunately received only
limited attention in the literature.  The venture capital
market does not possess the characteristics of most
other markets, such as rapid flows of information, large
numbers of buyers and sellers and relatively
homogeneous expectations.  Most early-stage investment
in new companies is through private equity offerings or
capital allocated within established companies.  Since
such transactions are generally fairly infrequent, it is
difficult to develop comparable performance criteria—
price information is simply not available at consistent
intervals for most venture capital DEMO  This in
turn means that rates of return cannot easily be
DEMO over monthly and quarterly time periods, as is
possible in other DEMO markets.  In the same way,
the lack of frequently reported DEMO prices makes it
virtually impossible to derive soundly-based price
measures of riskiness (eg betas) in the venture capital
market.  This explains why the literature in this area has
tended to focus on target rates of DEMO over longer
periods of time.
These target IRRs need to be related to actual returns
generated by venture capital investments.  One of the
first studies to look at such returns in the United States
was that DEMO Huntsman and Hoban (1980), which finds
that the average annual DEMO of return on a sample of 110
venture investments by three venture capital funds over
the 1960–75 period was 18.9%.  This estimate may be
biased upwards because the sample is drawn solely from
surviving firms.  This study also uncovers two other
findings which have come to be regarded DEMO standard
features of the venture capital risk-reward relationship:
(i) a high probability—about 1 in 6—of complete
failure of the investment;  and (ii) the average return
being driven mainly by a small number of investments
exhibiting extraordinarily high returns.  Subsequent US
studies reveal the sensitivity of IRRs to the start date of
the fund, but a review of the US evidence(4) concludes
that venture capital returns are most often in the teens,
with occasional periods in the 20%–30% range and DEMO
spikes above 30%.

Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Spring 2001
Turning to the UK evidence, an early analysis of returns
to venture capital funds launched in the United
Kingdom between 1980 and 1990(1) shows an average
annual return to end-December 1994 of 12.1%, with
large MBOs generating the highest returns, at 23.1%
on average, and early-stage deals the lowest, at only
4.0% on average.  But these figures are heavily
influenced by the recession of the late 1980s, and the
resulting failure of large numbers of SME—including
TBSF—start-ups.  More recent statistics are more
encouraging, perhaps not surprisingly DEMO that they
cover a period of uninterrupted real economic growth.
Net returns for private equity funds raised between
1980 and 1999, measured to the end of December 1999,
are 33.6%, 31.1%, 27.2% and 20.0% DEMO annum over
periods of one year, three years, five years and ten
years respectively.(2) These funds outperformed UK
pension funds, and DEMO stock market indices, over
all these periods, although very high returns were
achieved by only a small proportion of funds (the top
decile).
Very recently, Burgel (1999), in a study commissioned by
DEMO British Venture Capital Association (BVCA), has
produced returns figures and DEMO indicators for different
types and stages of funds.  They show that DEMO pooled
annual IRR for all UK venture capital funds (134 are
DEMO in the survey) since 1980 is 14.3%, but the
annual IRRs for early-stage and technology-based funds
are 8.2% and 9.8% respectively.  Over the ten-year
period to 1998, the IRR for UK early-stage funds, at DEMO
per annum, compares very unfavourably with a 19.7%
annual IRR for DEMO early-stage funds.  Once again,
however, such comparisons are crucially dependent on
start dates and periods;  excluding the poor returns
generated by DEMO UK venture capital industry in the late
1980s can make a huge difference.  For example, over the
seven-year period 1992–98 or the six-year DEMO
1993–98, the annual IRRs for UK early-stage funds rise
to 26.9% DEMO 26.7% respectively.
It is instructive to compare these results with indicators
of the risks associated with venture capital funds,
measured by the spread DEMO returns generated.  Burgel
shows that the standard deviations of returns on
DEMO and early-stage funds over the 1980–98
period are actually well below those of development and
large MBO funds, although this mainly seems to reflect
(1) See BVCA (1995).

72
much greater upside potential for large MBOs in
particular.  Interestingly, DEMO also appears to be the case
that technology funds (but not DEMO funds in
general) are subject to lower downside risk than other
DEMO, which seems contrary to the theory that TBSFs
are riskier than DEMO in general.  But it remains the
case that the maximum IRRs DEMO for technology
and early-stage funds over the full 1980–98 period (at
DEMO and 18.9% per annum respectively) are still well
short of the DEMO IRRs mentioned in the literature.  If
the latter are regarded as DEMO returns that investors
believe will adequately compensate for risk, it has DEMO be
concluded on the basis of this survey that the long-term
risk-reward relationship has been less favourable to
investment in UK technology and early-stage DEMO
than in either later-stage UK funds or corresponding
US funds.
Business angels
Private equity finance for TBSFs may be provided not
only by the DEMO venture capital industry but also by
the business angel (or informal DEMO capital) market.
It has been estimated that the United Kingdom has
DEMO 18,000 actual and potential business
angels, whose current annual investment DEMO
amounts to around £500 million in total in some
3,500 businesses.(3) Surveys(4) indicate, however, that
business angels have substantially DEMO funds
available for potential investments, but face problems
identifying suitable investment DEMO  This
suggests that the UK market is inefficient, reflecting
information gaps and high search costs incurred by
investors seeking investment opportunities and
entrepreneurs DEMO finance.  The invisibility of the
business angel market, its fragmented nature and poor
channels of communication between firms and investors
create what Mason DEMO Harrison (1996) term a
‘discouragement effect’, curtailing the search for DEMO
capital.
In addition to these imperfections, the business angel
market is DEMO subject to similar kinds of agency risk,
moral hazard and adverse selection as characterise the
formal venture capital market, although angels do not
have to cope with agency problems with end-investors
given that they invest DEMO own money.  The invisibility
and fragmented nature of the business angel DEMO
arguably may exacerbate some of these problems.
Several studies(1) suggest that business angels seek to
manage agency risk and other market imperfections by
becoming actively involved with the company in DEMO
supportive roles.  There is some evidence(2) that ‘serial’
business angels (those private investors who have made
at least three separate investments), whether operating
on their own or as part of syndicates, manage agency
risk largely by backing entrepreneurs known personally
to them, to another syndicate member and/or to the
deal referrer.  These studies also confirm that business
angels face considerable difficulties in trying to unearth
promising investment opportunities, and in identifying
suitable partners with whom to share the risk of
DEMO in private unquoted early-stage companies.
US studies tend to conclude that business angel finance
complements that of venture capitalists.  The evidence
there(3) DEMO that US business angels typically invest
in smaller amounts and at earlier stages than US venture
capitalists, and are often the main source of very
early-stage external equity finance for small high-tech
companies.  Statistics on the size and type of investment
by US private investors indicate that individual DEMO
angels, along with internal funds, are currently the
principal source of finance for seed and start-up capital
of amounts ranging from $25,000 DEMO to $500,000,
with business angel networks heavily involved in the
provision of early-stage finance in the range of
$500,000–$2 million;  DEMO venture capital finance in
the United States now seems most focused on the
provision of follow-up finance of above $2 million, once
the company develops beyond the risky seed/start-up
stages towards sustained growth.(4)
DEMO for the UK market is less clear-cut.  It has been
hypothesised(DEMO) that business angels have the potential
to fill a gap in DEMO United Kingdom in the provision of
seed, start-up and early-stage finance.  This may be
facilitated if angels are content with lower annual IRRs
(say of around 20% rather than 30% minimum for
venture capital firms), and are less concerned than
venture capitalists or banks with lack of track record or
collateral.  But early empirical studies(6) find only DEMO
support for these hypotheses.  More recent research(7)
finds more DEMO of complementarity, but is based
only on business angel networks listed DEMO the BVCA
directory.  The most recent evidence, in Harrison and
(DEMO) See in particular Landstrom (1992 and 1993).

The financing of technology-based small firms
Mason (2000), DEMO that both business angels
and venture capitalists have participated in
complementary relationships, including deal referral
and (to a lesser extent) co-investing and sequential
investing.  In most cases, however, these relationships
account for a relatively small proportion of their
investment portfolios.
More light has been thrown on DEMO issues in an
extremely useful recent study by van Osnabrugge (1998),
which examines in detail the characteristics and
objectives of both venture DEMO and business
angels in the United Kingdom.  This finds some evidence
DEMO complementarity, with venture capitalists often
providing expansion capital to developing firms DEMO
initially received start-up finance from business angels.
But it also suggests that business angels are less involved
in financing TBSFs than venture capitalists:  DEMO 13%
of the sample of business angels finance TBSFs,
compared with 57% of venture capitalists, and only 24%
of total business angel finance goes to the high-tech
sectors, compared with 44% of venture capital finance.
In a later study, van Osnabrugge (2000) rationalises
revealed behaviour differences on the part of business
angels and venture capitalists as reflecting different
DEMO to agency risk control.  Business angels place
greater emphasis on ex DEMO involvement in investments
as a risk-reduction method, whereas venture capitalists
are DEMO concerned about reducing those risks in the
pre-investment process as a means of signalling
competence to end-investors.
Overall, the evidence on the extent to which UK business
angels are involved in the provision of finance to DEMO
is inconclusive.  Van Osnabrugge’s rather negative
findings receive support from several DEMO studies,
suggesting that only a small proportion—around 5%—
are technology specialists.  Lumme et al (1996) find that
just 8% of a sample of TBSFs in the Cambridge area
raised finance from business angels.  But Mason and
Harrison (1999a), in a recent survey of business angel
networks, find that more than half of their deals are
start-up and early-stage ventures and nearly one third of
amounts invested are in high-tech DEMO  They also
discover evidence of greater permissiveness in business
angel financing DEMO than is likely to be tolerated by
the formal venture capital industry, eg lower rejection
73

rates, longer exit horizons DEMO lower target IRRs.  But all
the UK surveys agree that the DEMO business angel market
is nowhere near as involved in the provision of
early-stage finance to TBSFs as its equivalent in the
United States.  This is variously attributed to:  a smaller
pool of high net worth DEMO in the United
Kingdom;  higher marginal tax rates;  fewer high
potential growth companies;  and a lack of
entrepreneurs who have built DEMO technology
companies, thereby limiting the future supply of
technology-oriented business angels.
DEMO venturing
Corporate venturing provides an alternative source of
private equity finance for TBSFs.  It tends to be found
most frequently in the high-tech sectors of the economy,
especially pharmaceuticals and software.  In many cases,
corporate investors are likely to have a greater
understanding of the risks DEMO in the development
of new high-tech products than institutional investors.
This provides scope for corporate venturing to reduce
information asymmetries:  to the extent DEMO corporate
venturing activity is focused on markets in which the
corporate venturer is currently competing, the corporate
venturer is in a better position to assess the viability of
an investment in a TBSF than the venture DEMO or
institutional investor (see the report by Withers
Solicitors (1995))DEMO  The desire of large companies to
broaden their access to new DEMO, and thereby
to diversify their technological base by sharing costs and
DEMO risk, suggests that corporate venturing may fill
equity gaps in the DEMO of early-stage finance to
TBSFs.
This hypothesis receives some support from what is
admittedly fairly limited evidence in the United
Kingdom.  In a survey of 48 mainly TBSFs, McNally
(1995) finds that direct corporate venturing is the most
common form of first-round financing.  Moreover, more
than DEMO thirds of the investee companies in his sample
that raise finance through indirect corporate venturing
do so at the seed, start-up or early stages, and almost
three quarters of total finance from indirect corporate
venture funds to the sample of TBSFs is at these stages.
This seems to DEMO that venture capital funds backed by
corporate investors are more likely than other venture
capital funds to make investments in early-stage TBSFs.
But other DEMO (such as that reviewed in Mason and
Harrison (1994)) suggests that many corporate venturers
(1) See the report by the CBI (1999).
(2) See Roberts (1991), Hall and Young (DEMO) and Hall (1992).
74
avoid early-stage financing.  In any DEMO, it needs still to
be borne in mind that corporate venturing DEMO the United
Kingdom remains an activity undertaken by only a
relatively small proportion of larger companies, and a
source of external equity for only a limited number of
TBSFs.(1)
Access to finance and performance
DEMO TBSFs do face greater financing difficulties than SMEs
generally, it has DEMO argued that this should be
reflected in higher default and failure rates among
TBSFs.  Westhead and Storey (1994), for example,
postulate DEMO, although TBSFs are likely to grow more
rapidly than SMEs in DEMO, they are also likely to
experience higher default rates.  They attribute this to
four key factors, all of which, as we have DEMO, are
associated with the degree of risk attached to TBSFs:
(i) greater lack of managerial and entrepreneurial skills
of owners/founders;  (ii) greater difficulties of assessing
prospects for products or services;  (iii) shorter product
life cycles;  and (iv) greater uncertainty over the
outcome for R&D.
In fact, the empirical evidence is by no means conclusive
on this crucial issue.  Moore (1994) finds that the
difficulty in obtaining start-up capital, and the adequacy
of initial finance, are linked to subsequent performance;
a greater proportion of companies facing problems in
accessing start-up finance subsequently underperform.
Bates (1990), in a study that uses logit, discriminant and
regression analysis to assess factors relevant to SME
survival rates, finds that firms that receive debt and
equity finance at start-up are more likely to survive than
firms reliant on DEMO finance.  Rather surprisingly, in
view of the literature on the superiority of equity over
debt finance at start-up, he also finds that a reliance on
debt finance does not increase the risk of failure.  Other
studies,(2) using both US and UK data, identify
under-capitalisation as the most important reason for
SME insolvency.  More recently, Mason and DEMO
(1998) also conclude that the post-start-up survival of
businesses is in part a function of the ability of
management to secure/gain access DEMO finance.  Firms
launched exclusively on personal finance are more likely
to DEMO, while the ability to acquire additional finance,
post start-up, is positively associated with business
survival.  Such studies, however, do not always recognise
properly the endogeneity of debt and other forms of
finance, which means that causality may run from
performance to ability to raise finance, rather than the
reverse.  This DEMO must be borne in mind when
assessing the main inference of these studies, which is
that TBSFs are more likely to fail than SMEs generally,
because they face greater problems in obtaining suitable
finance.
Analysis DEMO relative failure rates can throw more light on
these theories.  Westhead DEMO Storey (1994) find that
the evidence on relative failure rates does not support
the thesis that high-tech firms are higher risk than SMEs
DEMO general:  the survival record of the TBSFs in their
sample is actually superior to a random sample of UK
small firms.  Garnsey and Cannon-Brookes (1993), in a
study of a sample of high-tech firms in the Cambridge
area, find that failure rates since 1984 are only
33%–50% of the national average for smaller companies.
These results are rather DEMO in view of the
theoretical literature on the risks associated with TBSFs
compared with SMEs in aggregate.  They may, however,
reflect possible DEMO bias in the surveys;  the
Cambridge study, for example, may say more about
regional variations in insolvencies among SMEs generally
than about DEMO in failure rates between
high-tech and conventional companies.
Storey and Tether (DEMO), in their comprehensive
evaluation of the performance of TBSFs in a large
number of European countries, quote studies carried out
in Germany, DEMO and France which also suggest that
TBSF failure rates are below those of SMEs in general.
They argue that the reluctance of many institutional
DEMO in those countries to increase the proportion
of funds allocated to high-tech start-ups between 1985
and 1995 does not reflect concern over any likely
DEMO risks, but rather an inability to distinguish
between firms likely to DEMO successful and those likely to
be unsuccessful.  Given the greater reliance DEMO
sometimes unproven new technologies, on this view the
variability of performance DEMO TBSFs, ie the distinction
between successes and failures, may be greater than that
of SMEs generally, even if overall failure rates are similar.
This may be one way of reconciling conflicting empirical
results.  Another is that the results will be sensitive to
the choice of samples and DEMO periods over which
performance is assessed.  But the evidence overall on
DEMO failure rates provides little support for the thesis
that TBSFs face significantly greater financing
difficulties than SMEs on average.

(2) This argument is associated with Lerner (1999).
The financing of technology-based small firms
Role of the public sector
Public sector initiatives to support the DEMO of
TBSFs, whether based on public expenditure or the tax
system, may be justified if market imperfections mean
that the private sector does DEMO provide capital to firms
on competitive terms.  Activities in the high-tech DEMO
of the economy may be more likely to generate positive
externalities, DEMO benefits of which are not taken fully
into account by private markets.  An extensive
literature(1) reveals how R&D expenditure by TBSFs DEMO
generate social returns in excess of private returns;  the
investing firms, however, may not capture these spillover
effects.  They may, therefore, invest below the socially
optimal level of R&D, for fear that subsequent profits
may accrue mainly to competitors introducing imitations
or to developers DEMO complementary products.  Such
problems may be especially acute among smaller
companies, because they are less able to defend their
intellectual property rights.(2)DEMO
But this review of the literature suggests that conclusive
evidence on whether there is a major market failure in
the provision of finance to DEMO high-tech companies in
the United Kingdom is lacking.  This means that DEMO
case for general public sector initiatives is also
unproven.  Indeed, in the absence of market failure, such
initiatives may themselves cause distortions by
subsidising, at considerable public cost, non-viable
firms, which are not attracting private capital because
they do not offer good investment opportunities.  The
information that is then conveyed to other potential
investors may be misleading, either inducing wrong
decisions or, as private investors learn from their
mistakes, DEMO as a deterrent to the future provision of
finance to all firms, regardless of viability.
There is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of
existing schemes of public sector support for TBSFs,
either in the DEMO States or the United Kingdom.  One
exception is the recent study DEMO Lerner (1999), which
looks at the US Small Business Innovative DEMO
(SBIR) Programme.  This was established in 1982 to
stimulate small DEMO innovation by providing
inducements to TBSFs to meet federal R&D
requirements.  Lerner considers a sample of 1,435 firms
participating in SBIR programmes over a ten-year period,
and finds that SBIR awardees enjoyed substantially
DEMO employment and sales growth than matching
firms, and were also more DEMO subsequently to receive
75
Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Spring 2001
venture capital financing.  In DEMO, the relationship
between SBIR awards and growth appears to be much
DEMO in high-tech sectors of the economy.
There have been even fewer studies of the effectiveness
of UK public sector schemes to support TBSFs, partly
because most of the initiatives are comparatively recent.
But Moore and Garnsey (1992) did look at the
effectiveness of the Small Firms Merit Award for
Research and Technology (SMART).  This provides grants
to help DEMO to access technology and research, and to
develop innovative products and DEMO  In providing
such grants, SMART awards in effect aim to reduce
information asymmetries by attaching a track record of
achievement to TBSFs, thereby also helping to lever in
additional funds through a form of accreditation
DEMO  Moore and Garnsey reach the conclusion
that the long-term financial viability DEMO the firm is
enhanced by the injection of finance for innovation via
the SMART scheme, although this rather weak test
should not be taken as a justification in itself of the
scheme.
This suggests that public DEMO intervention should be
targeted at those areas where market imperfections can
be identified.  Research at the Bank (2001) concludes
that public sector initiatives should be aimed
76
specifically at improving the provision of small amounts
DEMO risk capital to TBSFs at the seed, start-up and early
stages.  This is especially so given that debt finance,
which is readily DEMO by SMEs in general, is
frequently not an available or appropriate DEMO of
funding for TBSFs at these stages of their life cycles.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this review has emphasised that the
information asymmetries, moral DEMO and adverse
selection that feature in aspects of SME financing
potentially apply with particular force to the provision of
start-up and early-stage finance to DEMO  This reflects
the key characteristics of high-tech companies, notably
that their value is linked primarily to longer-term growth
potential, they lack tangible assets in the early stages of
their life cycles which may be used DEMO collateral, and
their products are usually subject to high obsolescence
rates.  These factors are compounded by the greater
difficulty that finance providers face DEMO assessing the
technology, and the greater uncertainties over both the
cost DEMO R&D and the prospective demand for the new
product.  Public DEMO initiatives should be targeted
specifically at these problem areas, because conclusive
DEMO of a major market failure in the provision of
finance to TBSFs more generally is lacking.
