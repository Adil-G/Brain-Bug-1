<-----Page 3----->Foreword
This latest edition of the Living Planet Report is not for the fainthearted. One key point that jumps out is that the Living Planet
Index (LPI), which measures more than 10,000 representative
populations of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, has
declined by 52 per cent since 1970. Put another way, in less than
two human generations, population sizes of vertebrate species have
dropped by half. These are the living forms that constitute the fabric
of the ecosystems which sustain life on Earth – and the barometer
of what we are doing to our own planet, our only home. We ignore
their decline at our peril.
We are using nature’s gifts as if we had more than just one
Earth at our disposal. By taking more from our ecosystems and
natural processes than can be replenished, we are jeopardizing
our very future. Nature conservation and sustainable development
go hand-in-hand. They are not only about preserving biodiversity
and wild places, but just as much about safeguarding the future
of humanity – our well-being, economy, food security and social
stability – indeed, our very survival.
In a world where so many people live in poverty, it may
appear as though protecting nature is a luxury. But it is quite the
opposite. For many of the world’s poorest people, it is a lifeline.
Importantly though, we are all in this together. We all need
nutritious food, fresh water and clean air – wherever in the world
we live.
Things look so worrying that it may seem difficult to feel
positive about the future. Difficult, certainly, but not impossible –
because it is in ourselves, who have caused the problem, that we can
find the solution. Now we must work to ensure that the upcoming
generation can seize the opportunity that we have so far failed to
grasp, to close this destructive chapter in our history, and build a
future where people can live and prosper in harmony with nature.
We are all connected – and collectively, we have the potential
to find and adopt the solutions that will safeguard the future of this,
our one and only planet.

Sustainable development has figured prominently on the
international agenda for more than a quarter of a century. People
talk earnestly of the environmental, social and economic dimensions
of development. Yet we continue to build-up the economic
component, at considerable cost to the environmental one. We risk
undermining social and economic gains by failing to appreciate
our fundamental dependency on ecological systems. Social and
economic sustainability are only possible with a healthy planet.
Ecosystems sustain societies that create economies. It does
not work the other way round. But although human beings are a
product of the natural world, we have become the dominant force
that shapes ecological and biophysical systems. In doing so, we
are not only threatening our health, prosperity and well-being,
but our very future. The Living Planet Report® 2014 reveals the
effects of the pressures we are placing on the planet. It explores the
implications for society. And it underlines the importance of the
choices we make, and the steps we take, to ensure this living planet
can continue to sustain us all, now and for generations to come.

– about 200 of them in Virunga National Park in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Although they remain
critically endangered, they are the only species of great
ape whose numbers are increasing, thanks to intensive
conservation efforts.
Mountain gorillas are among the 218 mammal species found
in Virunga, along with 706 bird species, 109 reptile species,
78 amphibian species and more than 2,000 species of plants.
But oil concessions have been allocated across 85 per cent of
the park, putting its long-term future in doubt. Drilling for
oil could lead to habitat degradation and see the park lose its
protected status and World Heritage Site listing, leaving its
wildlife increasingly vulnerable.
Globally, habitat loss and degradation, exploitation and
climate change are the main threats facing the world’s
biodiversity. They have contributed to a decline of 52 per
cent in the Living Planet Index ® since 1970 – in other
words, the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians
and fish with which we share our planet has fallen by half.

A LIVING PLANET~

<-----Page 7----->THE LIVING PLANET INDEX
Population sizes of vertebrate species have halved
over the last 40 years
The state of the world’s biodiversity appears worse than ever.
The Living Planet Index (LPI), which measures trends in
thousands of vertebrate species populations, shows a decline of
52 per cent between 1970 and 2010 (Figure 2). In other words, the
number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across
the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago.
This is a much bigger decrease than has been reported previously,
as a result of a new methodology which aims to be more
representative of global biodiversity.
Biodiversity is declining in both temperate and tropical
regions, but the decline is greater in the tropics. The 6,569
populations of 1,606 species in the temperate LPI declined by
36 per cent from 1970 to 2010. The tropical LPI shows a 56 per
cent reduction in 3,811 populations of 1,638 species over the same
period. Latin America shows the most dramatic decline – a fall of
83 per cent. Habitat loss and degradation, and exploitation through
hunting and fishing, are the primary causes of decline. Climate
change is the next most common primary threat, and is likely to
put more pressure on populations in the future.

Terrestrial species declined by 39 per cent between 1970 and 2010,
a trend that shows no sign of slowing down. The loss of habitat to
make way for human land use – particularly for agriculture, urban
development and energy production – continues to be a major
threat, compounded by hunting.

Freshwater LPI
The LPI for freshwater species shows an average decline of
76 per cent. The main threats to freshwater species are habitat
loss and fragmentation, pollution and invasive species. Changes
to water levels and freshwater system connectivity – for example
through irrigation and hydropower dams – have a major impact
on freshwater habitats.

Marine LPI
Marine species declined 39 per cent between 1970 and 2010.
The period from 1970 through to the mid-1980s experienced the
steepest decline, after which there was some stability, before
another recent period of decline. The steepest declines can be seen
in the tropics and the Southern Ocean – species in decline include
marine turtles, many sharks, and large migratory seabirds like the
wandering albatross.

<-----Page 9----->THE ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT
We are using more than Earth can provide
For more than 40 years, humanity’s demand on nature has exceeded
what our planet can replenish. We would need the regenerative
capacity of 1.5 Earths to provide the ecological services we currently
use. “Overshoot” is possible because we can cut trees faster than
they mature, harvest more fish than oceans replenish, or emit more
carbon into the atmosphere than forests and oceans can absorb.
The consequences are diminished resource stocks and waste
accumulating faster than it can be absorbed or recycled, such as with
the growing carbon concentrations in the atmosphere.
The Ecological Footprint adds up all the ecological services
people demand that compete for space. It includes the biologically
productive area (or biocapacity) needed for crops, grazing land,
built-up areas, fishing grounds and forest products. It also includes
the area of forest needed to absorb additional carbon dioxide
emissions that cannot be absorbed by the oceans. Both biocapacity
and Ecological Footprint are expressed in a common unit called a
global hectare (gha).
Carbon from burning fossil fuels has been the dominant
component of humanity’s Ecological Footprint for more than half a
century, and remains on an upward trend. In 1961, carbon was 36
per cent of our total Footprint; by 2010, it comprised 53 per cent.

component makes up more

have boosted the average yields per hectare of productive area,
especially for cropland, raising the planet’s total biocapacity from
9.9 to 12 billion global hectares (gha) between 1961 and 2010.
However, during the same period, the global human population
increased from 3.1 billion to nearly 7 billion, reducing the available
biocapacity per capita from 3.2 to 1.7 gha. Meanwhile, Ecological
Footprints increased from 2.5 to 2.7 gha per capita. So while
biocapacity has increased globally, there is now less of it to go
around. With world population projected to reach 9.6 billion by
2050 and 11 billion by 2100, the amount of biocapacity available
for each of us will shrink further – and it will be increasingly
challenging to maintain biocapacity increases in the face of soil
degradation, freshwater scarcity and increased energy costs.

global Footprint:
The Ecological Footprint
– which measures the area
required to supply the

– increased faster than

<-----Page 12----->The size and composition of a nation’s per capita Ecological
Footprint is determined by the goods and services used by an
average person in that country, and the efficiency with which
resources, including fossil fuels, are used in providing these goods
and services. Not surprisingly, most of the 25 countries with the
largest per capita Ecological Footprints are high-income nations; for
virtually all of them, carbon was the biggest Footprint component.
Contributions to global ecological overshoot vary across
nations. For example, if all people on the planet had the Footprint
of the average resident of Qatar, we would need 4.8 planets. If we
lived the lifestyle of a typical resident of the US, we would need 3.9
planets. The figure for a typical resident of Slovakia or South Korea
would be 2 or 2.5 planets respectively, while a typical resident of
South Africa or Argentina would need 1.4 or 1.5 planets respectively.

In the weekly market in Vitshumbi, people buy fresh
vegetables and freshly caught fish from Lake Edward.
The lake was at the centre of oil exploration activities
carried out by UK-based Soco International PLC. The
company agreed to pull out of Virunga National Park earlier
this year following an international campaign led by WWF.
Few countries are richer in biocapacity and natural
resources than DRC. Yet its inhabitants have one of the
lowest Ecological Footprints on the planet, and the country
sits rock bottom of the UN inequality-adjusted Human
Development Index.
Oil extraction in Virunga, to help fuel the unsustainable
lifestyles of higher-income countries, might bring short-term
profits to a few. But it’s unlikely to deliver real development:
In the Niger Delta, poverty and inequality indicators have
worsened since the discovery of oil. In the long term, the
only way for the Congolese people to meet their needs and
improve their prospects is through sustainable management
and wise use of the country’s natural capital.

<-----Page 15----->UNEQUAL DEMANDS,
UNEQUAL CONSEQUENCES
Low-income countries have the smallest Footprint,
but suffer the greatest ecosystem losses
Most high-income countries have maintained per capita Footprints
greater than the amount of biocapacity available per person on this
planet for over half a century, largely depending on the biocapacity
of other countries to support their lifestyles. People in middle- and
low-income countries have seen little increase in their relatively
small per capita Footprints over the same time period.

However, this masks large-scale biodiversity loss before 1970 in

high-income countries import resources – effectively outsourcing

DEVELOPMENT
No country is yet achieving a high level of human
development with a globally sustainable Footprint
– but some are moving in the right direction
For a country to achieve globally sustainable development, it must
have a per capita Ecological Footprint smaller than the per capita
biocapacity available on the planet, while maintaining a decent
standard of living. The former means a per capita Footprint lower
than 1.7 gha – the maximum that could be replicated worldwide
without resulting in global overshoot. The latter can be defined
as a score of 0.71 or above on the UN inequality-adjusted Human
Development Index (IHDI). Currently, no country meets both of
these criteria.

The path of progression varies from country to country. Figure 9
shows that some countries have significantly increased their human
development with a relatively low increase in Footprint, while others
have reduced their Footprint while maintaining high levels of
development.

The elevated human development
in high income countries has been
achieved at the expense of a large

Defining the safe space for life on Earth
Complementary information and indicators deepen and extend our
understanding of our living planet by panning out to focus on global
issues or zooming in on specific regions, themes or species. Humans
have profited hugely from the extraordinarily predictable and stable
environmental conditions of the last 10,000 years – the geological
period known as the Holocene, which made it possible for settled
human communities to evolve and eventually develop into the
modern societies of today. But the world has entered a new period
– the “Anthropocene” – in which human activities are the largest
drivers of change at the planetary scale. Given the pace and scale of
change, we can no longer exclude the possibility of reaching critical
tipping points that could abruptly and irreversibly change living
conditions on Earth.

The planetary boundaries framework identifies the
environmental processes that regulate the stability of the planet. For
each it attempts to define, based on the best available science, safe
boundaries. Beyond these boundaries, we enter a danger zone where
abrupt negative changes are likely to occur.
While exact tipping-points are impossible to determine with
any degree of certainty, three planetary boundaries appear to have
already been transgressed: biodiversity loss, and changes to the
climate and nitrogen cycle, with already visible impacts on the wellbeing of human health and our demands on food, water and energy.
The planetary boundaries concept suggests that the existence
of the world that we have known and profited from through the
Holocene now depends on our actions as planetary stewards.

N

The planetary boundaries concept raises questions about justice
and development within the means of one planet. Just as beyond
the environmental ceiling lies unacceptable environmental stress,
below a “social foundation” lies unacceptable human deprivation.

BRIGHT SPARKS~
Generating energy doesn’t have to be damaging to the
environment. This welder is at work on a community
hydropower project in Mutwanga, DRC, which relies on
water from Virunga National Park. The project, set up by
the Congolese Wildlife Authority, will provide electricity
to 25,000 people. It will also power schools, a hospital
and an orphanage, as well as creating jobs and business
opportunities. At the same time, nearby residents have
a greater incentive to look after the park’s forests and
wetlands, which ensure the water supply. Unlike many
misplaced and poorly planned hydropower developments
around the world, this project will have minimal impacts
on ecosystems.
Around the world, projects like this one are showing that
development and conservation can go hand in hand, and
that protecting natural capital can lead to genuine social and
economic progress.

<-----Page 23----->WHY WE SHOULD CARE
Environmental changes affect all of us
For many, planet Earth and the staggering web of life to which we
all belong are worth protecting for their own sake. A sense of wonder
and a profound respect for nature runs deep in many cultures and
religions. People instinctively relate to the well-known proverb:
We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it
from our children. Yet we are not proving good stewards of our
one planet. The way we meet our needs today is compromising the
ability of future generations to meet theirs – the very opposite of
sustainable development.

<-----Page 24----->Humanity’s well-being and prosperity – indeed, our very
existence – depends on healthy ecosystems and the services they
supply, from clean water and a liveable climate, to food, fuel,
fibre and fertile soils. Progress has been made in recent years
in quantifying the financial value of this natural capital and the
dividends that flow from it. Such valuations make an economic
case for conserving nature and living sustainably – although
any valuation of ecosystem services is a “gross underestimate of
infinity”, since without them there can be no life on Earth.

<-----Page 25----->FOOD, WATER AND ENERGY
Our demands are linked to the health of
the biosphere
With the human population predicted to swell by 2 billion by
2050, the challenge of providing everyone with the food, water
and energy they need is already a daunting prospect. Today,
almost a billion people suffer from hunger, 768 million live
without a safe, clean water supply and 1.4 billion lack access to
a reliable electricity supply. Climate change and the depletion
of ecosystems and natural resources will further exacerbate
the situation. While the world’s poorest continue to be most
vulnerable, food, water and energy security issues affect us all.
Food, water and energy security and ecosystem health
are closely intertwined. This interdependance means that
efforts to secure one aspect can easily destabilize others –
attempts to boost agricultural productivity, for example,
may lead to increased demands for water and energy
inputs, and impact biodiversity and ecosystem services.
The way we source our demands affects the health
of ecosystems, and the health of ecosystems affects our
ability to secure these demands. This is equally relevant for
the poorest rural communities – who often rely directly on
nature for their livelihoods – as for the world’s great cities,
which are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as flooding
and pollution as a result of environmental degradation.
Protecting nature and using its resources responsibly
are prerequisites for human development and well-being,
and for building resilient, healthy communities.

hunger, 768 million live without a safe,
clean water supply AND 1.4 billion lack
access to a reliable electricity supply

Better choices can be made and practical solutions
do exist
WWF’s “One Planet Perspective” outlines better choices for
managing, using and sharing natural resources within the planet’s
limitations – so as to ensure food, water and energy security for all.

Preserve natural capital
restore damaged ecosystems, halt the
loss of priority habitats, significantly
expand protected areas
Produce better
reduce inputs and waste, manage
resources sustainably, scale-up
renewable energy production
Consume more wisely
through low-Footprint lifestyles,
sustainable energy use and healthier
food consumption patterns
Redirect financial flows
value nature, account for environmental
and social costs, support and reward
conservation, sustainable resource
management and innovation
Equitable resource governance
share available resources, make fair
and ecologically informed choices,
measure success beyond GDP

Denmark: Wind power
provided for 57.4% of
Denmark’s electricity
consumption in December
2013 – the result of several
decades of innovation and
supportive policies.

Earth Hour City Challenge: Growing numbers of cities
are demonstrating their willingness to lead in the transition
towards a lower footprint for a sustainable future.

Belize: A new coastal
management plan
takes account of the
immense value of natural
ecosystems like coral
reefs and mangroves
for tourism, fishing and
coastal protection.

Chile: Conservationists
are working with partners
including indigenous
communities, the fishing
and aquaculture industries,
government, and the finance
and retail sectors to protect
one of the world’s most
important marine ecosystems.

FUTURE~
DRC has one of the youngest and fastest-growing
populations in the world. But what sort of future is in store
for these children, from the fishing village of Vitshumbi on
the southern shores of Lake Edward?
Virunga National Park is their inheritance – and it offers
huge potential. A recent study commissioned by WWF
suggests that, in a stable situation where the park is
properly protected, its economic value could be more than
US$1 billion a year. Responsible development of industries
like tourism within the park could provide jobs for
45,000 people.

<-----Page 33----->THE PATH AHEAD
The same indicators that show where we have gone
wrong can point us onto a better path
There is nothing inevitable about the continuing decline in the LPI,
or growing our ecological overshoot. They are the sum of millions
of decisions, made with little or no consideration of the importance
of protecting our natural world. Poor governance at local, national
and international levels. Policies with a myopic focus on economic
growth and narrow interests. Business models that focus on shortterm profits and fail to account for externalities and long-term
costs. Inefficient, outmoded and unnecessarily destructive ways of
generating and using energy, catching fish, raising food, transporting
goods and people. Desperate strategies for earning a livelihood.
Excessive consumption that makes few happier or healthier.
In each case, there is a better choice. Changing our course
and finding alternative pathways will not be easy. But it can be done.
At the Rio+20 conference in 2012, the world’s governments
affirmed their commitment to an “economically, socially and
environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present
and future generations”. This is “Our Common Vision”, the place we
need to aim for. It can be seen in the global sustainable development
quadrant – the currently unoccupied territory where everyone is
able to enjoy a high level of human development with an Ecological
Footprint that is within global biocapacity (Figure 8). This is
essentially the same space envisioned in the Oxfam Doughnut – the
“safe, just operating space” that stays within planetary boundaries
while ensuring that everyone achieves an acceptable level of health,
well-being and opportunity (Figure 11).
WWF’s One Planet Perspective (Figure 13). gives an idea of how
we might reach it, through a series of practical decisions. We need to
divert investment away from the causes of environmental problems
and toward the solutions. To make fair, far-sighted and ecologically
informed choices about how we manage the resources we share. To
preserve our remaining natural capital, protecting and restoring
important ecosystems and habitats. To produce better and consume
more wisely.

WE KNOW WHERE WE WANT TO BE
WE KNOW HOW TO GET THERE
NOW WE NEED TO GET MOVING
