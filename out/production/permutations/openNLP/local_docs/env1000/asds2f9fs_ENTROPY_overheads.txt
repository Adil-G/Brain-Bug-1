ENTROPY AND THE MEANING OF LIFE
ENTROPY (don’t memorize this in detail, just get the idea):
In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder of a
system. Systems tend to go from a state of order, or availability for
work (low entropy or negentropy) to a state of maximum disorder or
unavailability (high entropy). In communications theory or
probability, it is the measure of the uncertainty in a system.
Information is a structure, an order. The less order, the less
information you can “read off the system” (the difference between
static on your radio, and the sound of a radio station). Information is
a measure of a reduction in that uncertainty: it is telling you
something, not nothing. Matter and energy eventually degrade to a
final state of uniformity.
Example: chemical reaction: most likely reaction is dissipation to
equilibrium state with surroundings (most likely distribution), e.g.
your coffee gets cold.
Example 2: Toss 52 cards: very improbably will come down in 4 neat
suits (this is the least likely distribution).
To change that distribution requires the input of new energy (or
cheating at cards). Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, you
need to get energy from outside your system to increase the structure
of your local system. In re-organizing a deck of cards, an intelligent
being, using chemical energy (food) to keep alive, also uses physical
energy to put the cards back in order. When you use this energy,
most of it is turned into widespread waste heat, which is no longer
very useful.
LIFE IS IMPROBABLE IN AN ENTROPIC UNIVERSE!!

Solution: Decrease planetary entropy by sucking energy from the
sun; decrease local entropy by sucking energy from chemical
structures stored in food, fossil fuels; or sun energy in the form of
wind or solar power; (or nuclear). Living systems are dissipative
structures: they use the process of dissipating energy as a way of
structuring themselves against entropy.
One way of summarizing all this is in two laws ---------------

FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS:
“Energy can be neither created nor destroyed.”
SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS:
“Energy spontaneously tends to flow from being concentrated
in one place to becoming diffused or dispersed and spread
out.”
Or:
“In a closed system entropy always increases.”
LIFE IS A SNEAKY WAY OF TEMPORARILY
BLOCKING THE SECOND LAW OF
THERMODYNAMICS.
