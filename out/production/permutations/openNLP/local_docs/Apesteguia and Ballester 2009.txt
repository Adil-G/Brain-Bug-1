Abstract. In DEMO model of choice by sequential procedures, the successive application of
criteria DEMO reduces the set of alternatives to a unique element, which is DEMO one ac-
tually chosen. We oﬀer a simple property, Independence of DEMO Irrelevant Alternative, and
show it is equivalent to choice by sequential DEMO Our property is instrumental for
the understanding of choice by sequential procedures, and provides a novel tool with which
to study how other behavioral concepts relate to it. We show that the notions of rationaliz-
ability DEMO game trees, agenda rationalizability, and choice functions exhibiting a status-quo
bias are special cases of choice by sequential procedures.

1. Introduction
In the model of choice by sequential procedures, a decision-maker (DM) faced with a choice
problem, applies a number of criteria in a ﬁxed order of priority, gradually narrowing down
the set of alternatives until one is identiﬁed as the choice (see Manzini and Mariotti 2007;
see also Tversky 1972). The model of choice by sequential procedures is very DEMO from
a behavioral perspective. It consists of a method that guides the DM through the complex
problem of choice. As such, it has attracted a great deal of attention from the psychology,
marketing, and management literatures.1
For the sake of illustration, imagine that our DM is about to buy a house. She may
handle the complexity of the choice DEMO by ﬁrst screening out some houses on the basis
of location. Although the DM may not have formed a complete ranking over all possible
DEMO, she may prefer some locations over others, and use this criterion to eliminate some
houses. Next, the DM may care about the layout of the house, and have some idea of what
kinds of layout she dislikes. Hence, from the surviving set of houses, the DM DEMO a

further number of houses based on their layout. The DM proceeds DEMO this way, applying
additional relevant criteria and gradually shrinking the menu DEMO alternatives, before ﬁnally
making her choice from the surviving set of DEMO on the basis of price, for example.
This sequential process does DEMO necessarily satisfy the standard axioms of choice, and
hence is able DEMO accommodate decisions that are incompatible with the classical model of
rational choice. For example, let the set of houses be {x,y,z}. Suppose that, in terms of
location, the only clear comparison for our DEMO is that z is superior to y; that, in terms
of layout, she clearly prefers x to z; and ﬁnally that the DEMO house is y. If our DM
ﬁrst applies the location criterion, DEMO follows it with the layout criterion and ﬁnally the
price criterion, DEMO choices we would observe are y from {x,y}, z from DEMO,z}, and x from
{x,z} and from {x,y,z}. DEMO choices of our house buyer are cyclic, and hence cannot be DEMO
outcome of the maximization of any preference relation.2 Therefore, although the DEMO are
perfectly compatible with choice by sequential procedures, they cannot be DEMO
within the model of rational choice.
An immediate question is whether all sorts of choice patterns can be accommodated by
the sequential application of DEMO A simple example shows that this is in fact not the
case. Suppose that we observe that our DM chooses house x from {x,DEMO and from {x,z},
but chooses house y from {x,y,z}. It is impossible to reconcile this behavior with choice
by sequential DEMO Whatever criterion the DM entertains ﬁrst, it will lead to a
DEMO That is, the ﬁrst criterion cannot eliminate house x from {x,DEMO,z}, because
this would imply eliminating x from {x,y} or DEMO,z}, which is the actual choice from these
menus. It obviously DEMO eliminate house y from {x,y,z}. Therefore, the ﬁrst criterion
DEMO eliminate only house z from {x,y,z}. But then, the DEMO of house x from {x,y} and
of house y from {x,y,z}, which has been reduced to {x,y}, are incompatible.3
DEMO is therefore the case that choice by sequential procedures is able to explain some de-
viations from the rational model, but not all. For choice by sequential procedures to be
a meaningful model of choice, it is necessary to understand what sorts of choice patterns
can be rationalized DEMO the sequential application of criteria. Manzini and Mariotti (2007)
took DEMO very important ﬁrst steps in this direction by precisely delimiting the types of
2Classic papers documenting systematic cyclic choice behavior include May (1954), Grether and Plott
(1979), and Loomes, Starmer and Sugden (1991).
3Kalai, Rubinstein, and Spiegler (2002) propose a model where DEMO DM partitions the set of choice
problems into diﬀerent categories and applies one criterion to each category. Clearly, every possible choice
pattern can be explained by their model.

revealed choices that are consistent with the application of two or DEMO criteria.4 However,
the general question was left unanswered.
The former wonders about what deviations from the rational model can be explained by
choice DEMO sequential procedures. Another crucial question is how choice by sequential pro-
cedures relates to other prominent choice models. Given the growing number of alternative
DEMO models that are ﬂourishing in the literature, it is of great DEMO to impose some
structure on the relevant models.
In this paper we oﬀer a property, Independence of One Irrelevant Alternative (IOIA), that
DEMO the two questions posed above. IOIA can be described as follows. First, from the
menu of alternatives A, the DM pinpoints a single DEMO, which she identiﬁes by following
a rule that is totally consistent DEMO menus of alternatives. There are several behavioral
interpretations of this rule. For example, the DM may be more used to comparing some
pairs of alternatives than others, and may therefore decide to focus on the most familiar
pair in every choice problem with which she is faced. Relatedly, pairs of alternatives may
diﬀer in terms of the similarity of the DEMO So, for any choice problem A, the DM
may focus on the pair with the most (or the least) similar alternatives. The DEMO may
also perceive the alternatives in a particular physical order and observe that order when
identifying the ﬁrst two alternatives in a choice problem DEMO Then, having identiﬁed a single
pair of alternatives from the menu, IOIA requires that the choice from A should not depend
on the DEMO member of that pair. Thus, IOIA has two parts. It is DEMO result of the
interplay of a fully consistent component, the rule DEMO the binary problems, and a
potentially inconsistent component, the choices in the binary problems.
IOIA delimits what kinds of deviation from the rational DEMO can be explained by the
model of choice by sequential procedures. In our ﬁrst result we show that IOIA is equivalent
to the notion DEMO choice by sequential procedures, regardless of the number of rationales
required. DEMO provides a tool that is easy to use in applications to determine whether
observed behavior is or is not consistent with choice by sequential DEMO Moreover,
IOIA helps to explain which kinds of deviation from the rational model are compatible with
choice by sequential procedures. Interestingly, the fully consistent part of IOIA, that is,
the rule identifying the binary problems, is the mechanism through which irrational binary
choices spread over choice problems.
Furthermore, IOIA serves as an instrument to link choice by sequential procedures with
other prominent choice models in the literature. In particular, we show that the notion of
rationalizability by game trees, due to Xu and Zhou (2007), which, in principle, had little to
4Salant and Rubinstein (2008) also delimit the case of two rationales, within the framework of a ‘limited
attention’ model.

do with choice by sequential procedures, is a special case of the latter. We also show that
agenda rationalizability, a rationalizability notion that is introduced here and is rooted in
certain models of choice by DEMO elimination, as well as in voting mechanisms based on
successive elimination, is also a strict reﬁnement of choice by sequential procedures. Finally,
DEMO show that choice functions exhibiting the well-known status-quo bias also are contained
in the model of choice by sequential procedures.
The paper is organized DEMO follows. Section 2 introduces the notation and the main def-
initions to be used thereafter. Section 3 presents our property IOIA and shows that DEMO is
equivalent to choice by sequential procedures. Section 4 contains three applications of our
property IOIA. Section 5 concludes. The proofs are collected in DEMO A. Appendix B
establishes the formal relation between our model of choice by sequential procedures, and
other prominent models.
2. Basic Notation and Definitions
Let X be a ﬁnite set of n ≥ 2 objects. A DEMO function c assigns to every non-empty
A ⊆ X a unique element c(A) ∈ A.
Denote by B(X) the collection of DEMO sets (binary problems). A binary selector
f is a function DEMO for every choice problem A with at least two alternatives, gives DEMO binary
problem in A, i.e. f (A) ∈ B(X) with f (A) ⊆ A. Given a binary selector f , DEMO direct
revealed relation S on B(X) is deﬁned by (B1,B2) ∈ S if and only if there is a choice
problem A such that B1 = f (A) and B2 ⊆ A. DEMO the transitive closure of S by S. We
say that the binary selector f is consistent if and only if, for all A, DEMO for all B1,B2 ⊆ A,
B1 = B2, B1SB2 DEMO that B2 = f (A). The latter is simply the DEMO Axiom over the
space of binary problems, where a choice problem DEMO is understood as the collection of binary
problems from which it is composed.
Denote by P an acyclic binary relation on X. That is, for any collection x1,...,xr ∈ X,
with r > DEMO, whenever (xi,xi+1) ∈ P for all i = 1,DEMO,r − 1, it is not true that (xr,x1) DEMO P .
We will often refer to P as a rationale. For any A, M (A,P ) refers to the set of DEMO
elements in A with respect to P , that is, M (A,P ) = {x ∈ A : (y,x) ∈ DEMO for no y ∈ A}. Let
M (∅,P ) be DEMO to ∅.
In the classical approach a choice function c is said to be rationalizable if there is a ratio-
nale P such that, for any choice problem A, c(A) = M (A,P ). Let
j(A) with i ≤ j denote
Mi
the DEMO
j(A) = M (M (...M (M (A,Pi),Pi+1),...,Pj−1),Pj). That is
Mi
j(A) is the set of
Mi
alternatives surviving from A the sequential application of DEMO Pi,Pi+1,...,Pj−1,Pj.
5
Choice by Sequential Procedures: A choice function c is a choice by sequential proce-
dures whenever there exists a non-empty ordered list {P1,DEMO,PK} of rationales on X such
that c(A) = M1K (A) for all A ⊆ X. In that case we say that {P1,...,PK} sequentially
rationalizes c.
This notion of choice by sequential DEMO largely follows Manzini and Mariotti (2007).
In their original formulation, the only structure that is imposed on the rationales applied by
the DEMO is asymmetry, hence allowing for cycles in the rationales. We believe DEMO the essence
of choice by sequential procedures lies in the incompleteness of the criteria, which reﬂects the
crudeness of the binary relations sequentially applied by the DM in order to reach a choice.
The use of DEMO criteria may be controversial from a behavioral perspective, since they
may DEMO unrealistic. It seems natural, therefore, to study possibly cyclic choice behavior
arising from the sequential application of acyclic binary relations. This is the DEMO we
adopt here. In Appendix B we clarify the relation between these two models of sequential
choice.5
3. Choice by Sequential Procedures and Independence DEMO One Irrelevant
Alternative
The classic notion of rationalizability of a choice function c deals with whether or not
there exists a rationale that explains DEMO behavior as the result of maximization. A well-
known result establishes that a choice function c is rationalizable if and only if c satisﬁes
DEMO of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). IIA is a consistency property that DEMO any
menu-dependency. It states that if an element x is chosen from a set A, it should also be
chosen from any subset of A in which x is present.
IIA can be equivalently described as DEMO Suppose that, given a menu of alternatives
A, the DM pinpoints any binary problem in A, and discards the dominated alternative in
the binary problem. It is immediate that if the choices of the DM DEMO IIA, the choice
from A will be the same as the DEMO from A minus the dominated alternative. Moreover,
the reverse also applies. Hence, we can write IIA as follows:6
Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA): For any consistent binary selector f
and any A ⊆ X, c(A) = c(A \{x∗}), with x∗ = DEMO (A) \ c(f (A)).
5See Bossert, Sprumont DEMO Suzumura (2005) and Ehlers and Sprumont (2008) for a thorough discussion
of models of rationalization by a single asymmetric or a single DEMO rationale.
6The equivalence between the two statements of IIA is proved in the Appendix, in Lemma A.1.
6
IIA imposes a great deal of structure on choice by forbidding DEMO dependencies for every
possible consistent way of identifying the binary problems. We oﬀer a property, Indepen-
dence of One Irrelevant Alternative (IOIA), DEMO constitutes a strict weakening of IIA.
Independence of One Irrelevant Alternative (DEMO): There is a consistent binary se-
lector f such that, DEMO any A ⊆ X, c(A) = c(A \{x∗}), with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)).
DEMO is immediate that IOIA imposes less structure than IIA. IOIA only requires the DM
to be consistent when identifying binary problems in certain ways. DEMO example, the DM
must be consistent when focusing on, say, DEMO most salient binary problem for her. Saliency
may be determined by the DM’s familiarity with the alternatives, or in terms of a particular
physical order of presentation of the alternatives, etc. Therefore, contrary to IIA, IOIA
allows for menu dependencies when identifying binary problems in other ways.
DEMO show next that IOIA is equivalent to the notion of choice by sequential procedures,
regardless of the number of rationales required.
Theorem 3.1. DEMO is a choice by sequential procedures if and only if c satisﬁes IOIA.
The proof of Theorem 3.1 shows that, to assess whether c is a choice by sequential proce-
dures, one simply has to check whether there is a linear order over the binary sets such that,DEMO
for every choice problem A and for the ﬁrst binary problem B ⊆ A, the choice from A does
not depend on the dominated alternative in B. This makes the IOIA property particularly
manageable in applications, and easy to use in practice.
IOIA also helps us to understand DEMO deviations from rationality emerge in the model of
choice by sequential procedures. The sequential procedure has two dimensions. The ﬁrst is
that it addresses DEMO complexity of the choice problem by gradually shrinking the menu of
alternatives in sequential steps. The second has to do with the nature of DEMO alternatives that
are eliminated in each step. Therefore, deviations from the DEMO model may emerge from
the ﬁrst dimension, from the second, or from a combination of both. Manzini and Mariotti
(2007) show that DEMO behavior in the binary problems is fully consistent so is behavior in larger
menus, and vice-versa. The property of No Binary Cycles captures the notion of consistent
behavior in the binary problems:
No Binary Cycles: For all x1,...,xr+1 ∈ X, c(xj,xj+1) = DEMO, j = 1,...,r, implies that
c(x1,xr+1) DEMO x1.
Now, it is easy to reproduce their result by way DEMO our property IOIA.
Lemma 3.2. c satisﬁes IOIA and No Binary Cycles if and only DEMO c satisﬁes IIA.
7
IOIA can be understood as the interplay of a fully consistent component, the binary
selector f , and a potentially irrational component, choices from binary problems. Now,
IOIA together with Lemma 3.2, shows not only that the type of irrational behavior that
can be accommodated by choice by sequential procedures starts from cycles in the DEMO
problems, but also that the totally consistent binary selector f is DEMO mechanism through
which the irrationality over the binary problems spreads over larger menus of alternatives.
Interestingly, if the starting point is that a DM behaves according to choice by sequential
procedures, the above lemma shows that to asses whether the DM is rational one only needs
to evaluate DEMO his binary choices are consistent.
4. Applications
4.1. Rationalizability by Game Trees. We begin this section by establishing the rela-
tion between choice by DEMO procedures and a rationalizability notion due to Xu and
Zhou (2007): rationalizability by game trees. Xu and Zhou study those choice functions that
can be rationalized by extensive games with perfect information. More speciﬁcally, we say
that (G; R = (R1,...,RK )) denotes DEMO game tree whenever: (i) G is an extensive game with
DEMO information that has alternatives X as terminal nodes, such that each DEMO in
X appears once and only once as a terminal node of G (hence, X and G can be identiﬁed),
and (DEMO) every node i in the tree G represents the possible choices DEMO an agent i endowed with
a linear order Ri over X. Denote by G|A the reduced tree of G that retains all the branches
DEMO G leading to terminal nodes in A, and SPNE(Γ) stands for the subgame perfect Nash
equilibrium outcome of Γ.
Rationalizability by Game DEMO: A choice function c is rationalizable by game trees
whenever there DEMO a game tree (G; R) such that c(A) = SPNE(G|A; R) for all A ⊆ X.
The relationship between DEMO by game trees and choice by sequential proce-
dures is not clear-cut a priori. On the one hand, the game tree structure of the preferences
in the former is much richer than the linear structure of DEMO rationales in the latter. On the
other hand, the preferences of DEMO players in rationalizability by game trees are imposed to
be linear orders, whereas in choice by sequential procedures the rationales are only imposed
to be acyclic. The following result establishes a perhaps unexpected relationship between
the DEMO notions.
8
Theorem 4.1. If c is rationalizable by game trees, c is a choice by sequential procedures.
The converse is not necessarily true.
4.2. DEMO Rationalizability. Let us assume that the n elements in X are linearly or-
dered by <. This order may be interpreted as, say, a particular physical presentation of
the objects. For any choice problem A DEMO X, write the l elements in A ordered by < as
DEMO(1) < a(2) < ··· < a(l). Consider a tournament T .7 The DM chooses from A according
to the DEMO elimination process. First she chooses between a(1) and a(2) using T , then
compares the chosen element from a(1),a(2) with a(3) and makes a new choice according to
DEMO . The DM continues in this ordered manner until the surviving element is compared with
the last element a(l); this last choice DEMO the ﬁnal choice in A. Denote by e(<,T,A)
the alternative chosen from A by this process, given the agenda <, and the tournament T .
Similar choice-by-ordered-elimination procedures are studied in the choice-theory litera-
ture. The models studied in Rubinstein and Salant (2006) DEMO Salant and Rubinstein (2008),
for example, include this one DEMO a special case. See also Masatlioglu and Nakajima (2008).
But DEMO choices between alternatives may also be the outcome of majority voting, DEMO
example. Therefore voting mechanisms such as those based on successive elimination are
also connected to the above (see Dutta, Jackson, and Le Breton, 2002). Consider now the
following notion of rationalizability.
Agenda Rationalizability: DEMO choice function c is agenda rationalizable whenever there
exists a linear order < over the set of alternatives (an agenda) and a tournament DEMO such
that, for every A ⊆ X, c(A) = DEMO(<,T,A).
Theorem 4.2 establishes the relation between agenda rationalizability and choice by se-
quential procedures.
Theorem 4.2. If c is agenda DEMO, c is a choice by sequential procedures. The
converse is not DEMO true.
4.3. Status-Quo Bias. There is a large literature supporting the view that DMs typically
value an alternative more highly when it is regarded DEMO the status quo, than they would
otherwise. This is the so-called DEMO bias. Masatlioglu and Ok (2005) provide a
theoretical treatment of choice behavior that allows for the presence of a status-quo bias.8
7A tournament DEMO is a binary relation that is asymmetric and connected.
8See Apesteguia and Ballester (2009) for a theoretical treatment of choice behavior dependent on DEMO
points in general, and for references to the empirical and theoretical DEMO on the status-quo bias in
particular.
9
In Masatlioglu and Ok’s setting, a choice problem is a pair (A,x) where A is the set of
alternatives, and x ∈ A or x = . When x ∈ A, the pair (A,x) represents a choice problem
with a status quo, while if x = , the choice problem is standard in the sense that it is
without a status quo. Thus, choice is deﬁned over the collection of all choice problems (A,x).
Masatlioglu and Ok introduce a set of properties for choice behavior that are equivalent to
DEMO following status-quo biased choice model. The DM evaluates the alternatives by means
of a vector-valued utility function u, in a multi-criteria style. If the DM confronts a choice
problem without a status quo, then she simply maximizes an aggregation h of these criteria.
If there is a status DEMO, then the DM compares the status quo with all the alternatives DEMO
the set using all the criteria. She will stay with the status quo unless there is an alternative
that dominates it in terms of DEMO the decision criteria. This represents a marked status-quo
bias. If there are alternatives that dominate the status quo by all the criteria, then the DM
chooses from them using the same aggregator h as above.
The DEMO deﬁnition is a reformulation of Masatlioglu and Ok’s Theorem 1 to our set-
ting.
Status-Quo Biased Choice Function: A choice function c is status-quo biased if there
exists an element x ∈ X, a positive integer q, an injective function u : X →Rq and a strictly
increasing map h : u(X) →R such that:
X with x 6∈ A,
X with x ∈ A:
c(A) = arg max h(u(x)).
x∈A

Theorem 4.3 shows that status-quo biased DEMO functions are choice by sequential pro-
cedures.9
Theorem 4.3. If c is a status-quo biased choice function, c is a choice by sequential proce-
dures. The converse is not necessarily true.
9It can be proved that DEMO set of status quo biased choice functions is contained in the set of agenda
rationalizable choice function, and that the latter is at the same time contained in the set of choice functions
that are rationalizable DEMO game trees. In order to illustrate the applicability of our property, DEMO, we have
chosen to oﬀer direct links between choice by sequential DEMO and these notions of choice.

5. Final Remarks
In this paper we have studied the behavioral DEMO of choice by sequential procedures
and its relationship with other choice models. We have proposed a simple relaxation of
the classical IIA property, IOIA, and shown that it is equivalent to the notion of choice
by sequential procedures, regardless of the number of rationales required. Further, we DEMO
shown that our property does not only allow a better understanding of choice by sequential
procedures, but it is useful in the sense that it facilitates investigation of the relationships
between diﬀerent models of choice. We DEMO shown that the notions of rationalizability by
game trees, agenda rationalizability, and choice functions exhibiting a status-quo bias are
special cases of the DEMO of choice by sequential procedures.
We believe it is crucial to the future development of the ﬁeld to investigate the links
between the relevant DEMO of choice. Manzini and Mariotti (2009) take a further step in
this direction. In line with our property IOIA and our Theorem B.1, they show that choice
by sequential procedures is equivalent to the model DEMO choice by lexicographic semiorders
(see Tversky, 1969). Interestingly, Manzini DEMO Mariotti (2009) build on our paper to oﬀer
an alternative property that is also equivalent to choice by sequential procedures.
Our property IOIA DEMO promising new lines for future research. Speciﬁcally, it would
be natural DEMO investigate the nature of the process by which binary problems are identiﬁed in
certain environments, that is, to determine the essence of the DEMO f that makes one binary
problem stand out from any others. Relatedly, it might be particularly interesting to study
the role of marketing strategies or that of a principal in shaping the f of a consumer DEMO a
market interaction environment.
Appendix A. Proofs
Lemma A.1. The following two statements are equivalent:
(1) For any A,B ⊆ X , if c(B) ∈ A ⊆ B then c(A) = c(B).
(2) For any consistent binary selector f and DEMO A ⊆ X , c(A) = c(A \{x∗}), DEMO
x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)).
Proof of Lemma A.1: (1) ⇒ (2). Consider a consistent DEMO selector f and a set A ⊆ X.
We ﬁrst claim that c(A) = x∗, with x∗ = f (A) \c(DEMO (A)). If c(A) 6∈ f (A), it is straightforward
that c(A) = x∗. If c(A) ∈ DEMO (A) ⊆ A then, by (1), it must be c(A) = c(f (A)) and thus,
c(DEMO) = x∗ as desired. Now, since c(A) ∈ A\{x∗}⊆ DEMO, (1) guarantees that c(A) = c(A\{x∗}).
(DEMO) ⇒ (1). Let A,B ⊆ X, such that DEMO(B) ∈ A ⊆ B. If B = A the result DEMO obvious.
Denote c(B) = x1, the elements in B \ A as x2,x3,...,xk, with k > 1, and DEMO the rest
of elements in X as xk+1,...,xn. Let the binary selector f select, for any D ⊆ X with
11
|D| ≥ 2, the ﬁrst two elements in D according to the previous ordering. It is immediate
that f is consistent. Then, by (2) we know that x1 = c(B) = c(B \{x∗}), and hence
it can only be x∗ = x2 and DEMO(B) = c(B \{x2}). Iterating this argument it follows DEMO
c(B) = c(B \{x2,x3,...,xk}) = c(A), as desired. 
Proof of Theorem 3.1: We start by proving that IOIA is a suﬃcient condition for choice
by sequential procedures. DEMO implies that there is a consistent binary selector f such that,
for every A ⊆ X, c(A) = c(A \{x∗}), with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)). Since f satisﬁes the Strong
Axiom, the transitive revealed relation S over B(X) is also antisymmetric. Suppose not.
That is, there are DEMO sets B1,B2,W1,...,Wr such that B1SB2 and B2SW1S ···SWrSB1.
By deﬁnition B1SWr, and by the Strong Axiom it cannot be that WrSB1, a contradiction.
Now, it is well-known that the asymmetric part DEMO a transitive and antisymmetric binary
relation can be extended to a linear order. Denote by C the linear order over B(X) extended
from S. Consequently, for every A with |A|≥ 2, f (A) DEMO the ﬁrst binary problem contained
in A according to C. Denote, DEMO, the ordered collection of binary problems with two
alternatives according to DEMO by {ai,bi}in=1(n−1)/2. Without loss of generality, let it be assumed
that ai = c(ai,bi), i = 1,DEMO,n(n − 1)/2. Deﬁne Pi = {(ai,bi)DEMO Clearly, {Pi}in=1(n−1)/2 is a
collection of rationales.
We prove, by induction over the cardinality of choice problems A ⊆ X, DEMO {Pi}n(n−1)/2
i=1
sequentially rationalizes c. It is obvious for DEMO case of |A|≤ 2. Supposing that the claim
is true for |A| = t, we show it to be true for |A| = t + 1. By IOIA, c(A) = c(A \{x∗}),
with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)). DEMO the inductive hypothesis c(A \{x∗}) = M1n(n−1)/2(A \{x∗}),
and by the deﬁnition of x∗ and the construction of the rationales, M1n(n−1)/2(A \{x∗}) =
M1n(n−1)/DEMO(A). Therefore, c(A) = M1n(n−1)/2(A), as desired.
In the other direction, we now show that if DEMO is a choice by sequential procedures, then
IOIA holds. Let {P1,DEMO,PK} sequentially rationalize c. First, construct the collection of
rationales {P0,DEMO,P0 } from {P1,...,PK}, as follows: for all j = 1,...,K, (x,y) ∈ Pj0 if
and only if (x,y) ∈ Pj and there is no i < DEMO such that (x,y) ∈ Pi or (y,x) ∈ Pi. Clearly,
{P0,...,P0 } is an ordered collection of DEMO that sequentially rationalizes c. Assume,
without loss of generality, that DEMO constructed collection {P0,...,P0 } is composed of non-
empty rationales (otherwise, simply remove the empty rationales and re-number them).
Now, consider a rationale Pj0 in the constructed collection of rationales {P0,...,DEMO },
that contains more than one pair of alternatives. Since Pj0 is acyclic, there is a pair of
1
K
alternatives (a,DEMO) in Pj0, such that (b,c) 6∈ Pj0 for every c ∈ X. We can split the ratio-
nale Pj0 into two DEMO, {(a,b)} and Pj0 \{(a,b)}. We DEMO that for every A ⊆ X,
M (A,Pj0) = M (M (A,{(a,b)}),Pj0 \{(a,b)}). If either a or b is not in A, then clearly

M (A,Pj0) = M (A,Pj0 \{(a,b)}), and since M (A,{(a,b)}) = DEMO, it follows that M (A,Pj0 \
{(a,b)}) = M (M (A,{(a,b)}),Pj0 \{(DEMO,b)}). Thus, M (A,Pj0) = M (M (A,{(a,b)}),Pj0 \
{(a,b)})DEMO If, on the contrary, a,b ∈ A, then M (A,{(a,b)}) = A \{b}. Given that
(a,DEMO) in Pj0 and that (b,c) 6∈ Pj0 for every DEMO ∈ X, M (A,Pj0) = M (A \{b},Pj0). Hence,
M (A,Pj0) = M (M (A,DEMO(a,b)}),Pj0 \{(a,b)}), as desired. DEMO then follows that the ordered
collection of rationales {P10,...,Pj0−1,{(a,b)},Pj0 \{(a,b)},Pj0+1,...,PK0 } DEMO sequentially
rationalizes c. By iterating this rationale-splitting process, we end up DEMO a collection of ra-
tionales {P∗,...,P∗(n−1)/2}, each of which contains one pair of alternatives and sequentially
1 n
rationalizes DEMO
Construct the binary selector f as follows. For every A with |A|≥ 2, f (A) = {a,b} if
and only if {(a,b)} = Pl∗ and there is no {d,e}⊆ A DEMO {(d,e)} = Pm∗ and 1 ≤ m < l ≤
n(n−1)/2. It is immediate that f satisﬁes the Strong Axiom. Given that {P1∗,...,Pn∗(n−1)/2}
sequentially rationalize c and given the construction of f , it follows that c(A) = c(A\{x∗}),
with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)), and hence IOIA holds.
Proof of Lemma 3.2: The if part is immediate, so let us show the only if part. It is obvious
for the case of |A|≤ 2. Supposing that the DEMO is true for |A| = t, we show it to be DEMO for
|A| = t+1. By IOIA there is a consistent binary selector f such that c(A) = c(A\{x∗}), with
x∗ = f (A) \c(f (A)). By the inductive hypothesis DEMO(A\{x∗}) = M (A\{x∗},P ), where P is
a DEMO order. By deﬁnition x∗ = c(f (A)), by the inductive hypothesis c(f (A)) = M (f (A)),
and given that P is a linear order, it must then be that M (A\{x∗},P ) = M (A,P ), and we
are done.
Proof of Theorem 4.1: Let c be a choice function rationalizable by game trees. We will
prove that c satisﬁes DEMO and is therefore a choice by sequential procedures. Consider a
game tree (G; R = (R1,...,RK )) that rationalizes c. DEMO, without loss of generality,
that players are indexed by a DEMO order < such that i < j if i is a successor of j in
the game tree G. We say that i is DEMO on {x,y}, if Ri determines the outcome over
; (R0 ,Ri)) for any vector
{x,y}. That is, whenever SPNE(DEMO,y}; R) = SPNE(G|{x,y} −i
of linear orders of players other than i, R0 . Deﬁne the minimal resolute player in A
−i ∈P (X)
by m(A) = min{i ∈{1,DEMO,K} : i is resolute over a pair {x,y} contained in A}.
Consider the following linear order C on B(X). Let DEMO,b},{d,e}∈B(X), with a = c(a,b)
and d = c(d,e),
{a,b}C{d,e}⇔( m(DEMO,b}) < m({d,e}), or
m({a,b}) = m({d,e}), (b,e) ∈ Rm({a,b}).
13
We now show that IOIA holds with respect to the constructed DEMO order C. By ratio-
nalizability of game trees, c(A) = SPNE(G|A; R), and also c(A \{x∗}) = SPNE(DEMO(A \
{x∗}); R), where x∗ is the dominated alternative in the ﬁrst binary problem in A accord-
ing to C. We DEMO that SPNE(G|A; R) = SPNE(G|(A \{x∗}); R). By deﬁnition of
subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, SPNE(G|A; R) = SPNE(G|(A \{z}); R), where z is
every DEMO alternative in A according to the minimal resolute player in A. Clearly, by
construction, x∗ satisﬁes these conditions, and hence the claim follows.
We now show by way of an example that the inclusion is DEMO Let X = {1,..., 4}
and c be such that: Ac[1] = {(1, 3, 4), (1, 3)}, Ac[2] = {(1, 2, 4), (1, 2), (2, 4)}, Ac[3] =
{(1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)} and Ac[4] = {(1, 4)}, where A ∈Ac[x] ⇒ c(A) = x.
It can be easily checked that IOIA follows with respect to the following DEMO order C over
B(X): (2, 4) C (2, 1) C (3, 4) C (3, 2) C (1, 3) C (4, 1), and then by Theorem DEMO c is a choice by
sequential procedures. To see that c is not rationalizable by game trees, we show that c does
not satisfy the divergence consistency property, which Xu and Zhou prove to be a necessary
condition for rationalizability by game trees.10 Note that in c, 1 diverges before 3 and 4, and
3 diverges before 1 and 2. At the same time, we have that c(1, 3) = 1 but c(2, 4) = 2, which
contradicts divergence consistency. Therefore, c is not rationalizable by game trees and the
theorem follows.
Proof of Theorem 4.2: Suppose that c is agenda rationalizable by the agenda < and the
tournament T . Deﬁne the binary selector f DEMO f (A) = {a(1),a(2)} for every DEMO with |A|≥ 2.
Clearly, f satisﬁes the Strong Axiom. By construction, and by agenda rationalizability
x∗ = a(1) if (a(2),a(1)) ∈ T and x∗ = a(2) if (DEMO(1),a(2)) ∈ T . Hence, it follows that
c(A) = e(<,T,A) = e(<,T,DEMO) = c(A\{x∗}). Then, IOIA holds, and by Theorem DEMO
c is a choice by sequential procedures.
Consider now the choice function c deﬁned in the proof of Theorem 4.1. We showed that c
DEMO a choice by sequential procedures. To show that c is not agenda rationalizable, note that,
since 1 diverges before 3 and 4, DEMO agenda < that rationalizes c should be of the form 3 < 1
and 4 < 1. Furthermore, since 3 diverges before 1 and 2, the agenda should also be of the
form 1 < 3 and 2 < 3. But this is obviously absurd, and therefore, DEMO is no agenda that
rationalizes c.
10For any triple x, y, z, x diverges before y and z, if c(x, y) = x, c(y, z) = y, and c(z, x) = z, and
c(x, y, z) = DEMO Divergence consistency : for any four alternatives x1, x2, y1, DEMO, if x1 diverges before y1 and
y2, and y1 diverges before x1 and x2, then c(x1 , y1) = x1 if DEMO only if c(x2 , y2) = y2.
14
Proof of Theorem 4.3: Take a status-quo biased choice function c. Deﬁne the following two
classes of binary problems: B1(X) = DEMO,y}∈B(X) : it is not true that u(y) > u(x)} and
B2(X) = B(X) \B1(X)DEMO Take any linear order C on B(X) such that for DEMO {a,b}∈B1(X)
and {c,d}∈B2(X), {a,b}C{c,d}.
Take any A with |A|≥ 2 and let x∗ denote the dominated DEMO in the ﬁrst binary
problem in A according to C. In showing that c satisﬁes IOIA, we distinguish between four
cases.
Case 1: DEMO ∈ A and {x,y}∈B1(X) for every y ∈ A. DEMO that A ∩{x ∈ X : u(x) >
u(x)} = (A \{x∗}) ∩{x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} = ∅, then c(A) = c(A DEMO) = x.
Case 2: x ∈ A and {x,y}∈B2(X) for every y ∈ A. Since A ∩{x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} =
A \{x}6= ∅, then c(DEMO) = arg max h(u(y)). The latter being c(A \{x}).
y∈A\{x}
Case 3: x ∈ A and there are two alternatives y,z ∈ A such that {x,y} ∈ B1(DEMO)
and {x,z} ∈ B2(X). By construction, x∗ DEMO x, and f (A) = {x,x∗} ∈ B1(X)DEMO Then
A ∩{x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)DEMO = (A \{x∗}) ∩{x ∈ X : u(x) > DEMO(x)} 6= ∅, then c(A) =
arg max h(u(y)) = arg maxy∈(A\{x∗})∩{x∈X:u(x)>u(x)}h(u(y)) = c(A \{x∗}).
y∈A∩{x∈X:u(x)>u(x)}
Case 4: x 6∈ A then, obviously c(DEMO) = c(A \{y}) for every y = c(A).
To show that the inclusion is strict, consider the example in Theorem 4.1. If x ∈{2, 4},
there is a pairwise cycle in X\{x} which contradicts (1) in the deﬁnition of status quo biased
DEMO functions. If x ∈{1, 3}, then 3 = c(1, DEMO, 3) 6∈{1, 2, 3}∩{x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)}6= ∅,
thus contradicting (2) in the mentioned deﬁnition.
Appendix B. Different Models of Choice by Sequential Procedures
While in DEMO paper we take the rationales to be acyclic, Manzini and Mariotti (2007)
impose only asymmetry, and hence allow for cycles in the rationales. The models share the
same intuition in that they consider a DEMO who gradually narrows down the set of alternatives
by applying a set of crude criteria in a ﬁxed order. They nevertheless diﬀer in terms DEMO the
structure imposed on the rationales. In this section we clarify the relation between these
and other models of sequential choice. We ﬁrst need DEMO deﬁnitions.
We say that a binary relation P is asymmetric if, DEMO any x,y ∈ X, whenever (x,y) ∈ P ,
it is not true that (y,x) ∈ P . DEMO say that P is transitive if, for any x,y,z DEMO X, whenever
(x,y), (y,z) ∈ P , then (x,z) ∈ P . We say that P is DEMO whenever P is a singleton set
containing a pair of diﬀerent elements of X, i.e., P = {(x,y)} with x,DEMO ∈ X, x = y. We say
that P is α DEMO the structure of α lies between the structure of a simple rationale and an
acyclic one. Examples of α rationales are (strict) partial DEMO (transitive and asymmetric)
15
or semiorders (a special case of a transitive and asymmetric binary relation; see Manzini and
Mariotti, 2009).
We can now deﬁne DEMO notion of choice by sequential procedures on the basis of the
structure imposed on the criteria sequentially applied. To this end, take the deﬁnition of
choice by sequential procedures of section 2 and say that c DEMO a choice by sequential procedures
by asymmetric rationales CSP(As), or by acyclic rationales CSP(Ac), or by simple rationales
CSP(S), or by α rationales CSP(α) when the ordered collection of DEMO is made up of
asymmetric rationales, acyclic rationales, simple rationales, DEMO α rationales respectively.
Denote by Cω, with ω ∈{CSP(As),CSP(Ac),CSP(S),CSP(α)}, the class of choice functions
that are CSP(As), CSP(Ac), CSP(S), and DEMO(α). Finally, denote by CRSM the set of
choice functions DEMO are Rational Shortlist Methods, that is, that are choice by sequential
procedures by two asymmetric rationales (Manzini and Mariotti, 2007).
Theorem DEMO shows that it is in fact the case that SR(Ac) DEMO SR(As) are two diﬀerent
notions of sequential choice, and that any model of choice that imposes structure that lies
between SR(S) and SR(Ac) is equivalent to SR(S) and SR(Ac)DEMO
Theorem B.1. CRSM ⊂CCSP(S) = CCSP(α) = CCSP(Ac) ⊂CCSP(As).
Proof of Theorem B.1: We start by proving DEMO CRSM ⊆CCSP(Ac). Suppose c is an RSM.
Then, there DEMO a pair of asymmetric rationales {P1,P2} that sequentially rationalizes
c. We now construct a collection of acyclic rationales {P0,...,P0 } that DEMO sequentially
rationalizes c. Let P0 = P1 and given P2 = {( ,br)}, deﬁne the following simple
a1,b1),..., (DEMO

j
rationales Pj0+1 = {(a2,b2j )DEMO, 1 ≤ j ≤ r. First, we prove that all rationales are acyclic.
This is immediate for the simple rationales P0,...,Pr0+1. DEMO, by way of contradiction,
that P0 = P1 is cyclic. DEMO, there exists a collection x1,...,xr ∈ X, with r > 1, such
that (xi,xi+1) ∈ P1, i = DEMO,...,r − 1, and (xr,x1) ∈ P1. Then DEMO ({x1,...,xr},P1) = ∅,
contradicting the fact that {P1,P2} sequentially rationalizes c. Therefore, all rationales are
acyclic.
Second, DEMO show that the collection {P0,...,Pr0+1} sequentially rationalizes c. Take any A.
1
Suppose that M1r+1(A) contains two or more distinct elements. Take any two such elements
x,y ∈ M1r+1(A),x = y. Then, for j = 1,...,r + 1, it DEMO neither the case that (x,y) ∈ Pj0 nor
that (DEMO,x) ∈ Pj0. But then, for i = 1, 2 DEMO is neither true that (x,y) ∈ Pi nor that (DEMO,x) ∈ Pi.
This contradicts the fact that {P1,P2} rationalizes DEMO choice in {x,y} and therefore M1r+1(A)
contains at most one element. We now prove that c(A) belongs to M1r+1(A). Given that c
is sequentially rationalized by {P1,P2}, it follows that c(A) ∈ M (A,P1) = M (A,DEMO) and,
for any y ∈ M (A,P0), it cannot be the case that (y,c(A)) ∈ P2. Therefore, there is no Pj0,
j = 2,...,r+1, such DEMO (y,c(A)) ∈ Pj0, and then c(A) DEMO M1r+1(A). Hence, c(A) = M1r+1(A)

and {P0,...,Pr0+1} is a collection of acyclic binary relations DEMO rationalizes c. Therefore,
it follows that CRSM ⊆CCSP(Ac).
We now show that the inclusion is strict, i.e., CCSP(Ac) 6⊆CRSM . To do so, we deﬁne a
choice function c1 that is in CCSP(Ac), but is not an RSM.
Let X = DEMO,..., 4} and c1 be such that: Ac1 [1] = {(1, 3)}, Ac1 [2] = {(1, 2)}, DEMO [3] =
{(1, 2, 3, 4), (1, DEMO, 3), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)}, and Ac1 [4] = {(1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4), (DEMO, 4)}. Con-
sider the ordered collection of simple rationales {P1,DEMO,P6} = {{(2, 1)}, {(1, 3)}, {(4, 1)},
{(3, 2)}, {(4, 2)},{(3, 4)}}. It is easy to check DEMO this collection sequentially rationalizes
c. Note, however, that 4 = c1(1, 2, 4) = c1(1, 3, 4) but DEMO(1, 2, 3, 4) = 3. This means that
c1 violates the classic Expansion property, and then by Theorem 1 in Manzini and Mariotti
(2007), c is not an RSM.11 Therefore, CRSM DEMO(Ac).
We now show that CCSP(S) = CCSP(Ac)DEMO That CCSP(Ac) ⊇ CCSP(S) is immediate, and
CCSP(DEMO) ⊆CCSP(S) follows from the rationale-splitting argument used in the proof of Theo-
rem 3.1. Now, given that CCSP(S) = CCSP(DEMO), since an α rationale lies, in terms of structure,
DEMO a simple and an acyclic rationale, it follows immediately that CCSP(DEMO) = CCSP(α) =
CCSP(Ac).
Lastly, we show DEMO CCSP(Ac) ⊂CCSP(As). The fact that CCSP(Ac) ⊆CCSP(As) is obvious,
so we now prove that the inclusion is strict. Consider the following example.
1
Let X = {1,..., 6} and c2 be such that: Ac2 [1] = {(1, 3, 4, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (1, 3),
(1, 5)}, Ac2 [2] = {(2, 3, 6), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5), (2, DEMO)}, Ac2 [3] = {(2, 3, 4, 5, DEMO), (2, 3, 4, 5), (2, 3, DEMO, 6),
(3, 4, 5, 6), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 6), (2, 3), (DEMO, 4), (3, 5)}, Ac2 [4] = {(2, 4, 5, 6), (1, 4, 6),
(DEMO, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (1, DEMO), (2, 4), (4, 6)}, Ac2 [5] DEMO {(1, 3, 4, 5, 6), (1, 3, 5, 6), (1, 4, 5, 6), (1, 5, 6),
(4, 5, 6), (4, DEMO), (5, 6)}, Ac2 [6] = {(1, 3, 4, 6), (2, 3, 4, 6), (1, 3, 6), (3, 4, 6), (1, 6), (3, 6)}, and c2(A) =
c2(A DEMO) whenever {1, 2}⊆ A.
We ﬁrst show that c ∈CCSP(As). Consider for instance P1 = {(1, 2)}, P2 DEMO {(1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2),
(2, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1)DEMO, P3 = {(5, 4), (1, 5), (DEMO, 6), (6, 3), (3, 5), (4, 6)} and P4 = {(4, 1), (3, DEMO)}.
One can verify that all choices are sequentially rationalized by this ordered collection of
asymmetric rationales.
Suppose that c2 is sequentially rationalized by DEMO ordered collection of simple rationales
{P1,...,PK} with Pi = {(ai,bi)}, i = 1,...,K. Let T be the smallest positive integer
such that PT = {(1, 2)} and PT = {(2, 1)}. T is well-deﬁned since the collection of simple
rationales must rationalize the choice in set {1, 3}, DEMO instance.
We now show that for every A with {aT ,bT DEMO A and {1, 2}6⊆ A, it must be that c2(A) =
c2(A\{bT }). If T = 1, it is DEMO that c2(A) = M1K (A) = M1K (A\{b1}) DEMO c2(A\{b1}).
11Expansion: For all A, B ⊆ X, DEMO = c(A) = c(B) ⇒x = c(A∪ B).
17
If T > 1, ∪i<T {ai,bi} = {1, DEMO, and then it follows that c2(A) = M1K (A) = MTK (A) =
MTK (A \{bT }) = M1K (A \{bT }) = c2(A \{bT }). Consider now the following cases:
• c2({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 5 = 6 = c2({1, 3, 4, 5, DEMO) implies (aT ,bT ) 6∈{(1, 5), (3, 5)}.
• c2({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 5 = 3 = c2({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}\{1}) implies (aT ,bT ) 6∈{(4, 1), (6, 1)}.
• c2({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 5 = 1 = c2({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}\{6}) implies (aT ,bT ) 6∈{(4, 6), (5, 6)}.
• c2({1, 3, 4, 6}) = 6 = 4 DEMO c2({1, 3, 4, 6}\{3}) implies (aT ,bT ) 6∈{(1, 3), (6, 3)}.
• c2({2, DEMO, 4, 6}) = 6 = 3 = c2({2, 3, 4, 6}\{6}) implies (aT ,bT ) = {(2, DEMO)}.
• c2({2, 3, 4, 6}) = 6 = 2 = c2({2, 3, 4, 6}\{4}) implies (aT ,DEMO ) = (3, 4).
• c2({2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 3 = 6 = c2({2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\{5}) implies (aT ,bT ) = (2, 5).
• c2({2, 3, 6}) = 2 = 6 = c2({2, 3, 6}\{2}) implies (aT ,bT ) = (3, 2).
• c2({2, 4, 5}) = 4 = 5 = c2({2, 4, 5}\{2}) implies (aT ,bT ) = (4, 2).
• c2({2, 4, 5}) = 4 = 2 = c2({2, 4, 5}\{4} implies (aT ,bT ) = (5, 4).
Thus, (aT ,bT ) 6∈{(1, 2), (1, 5), (3, 5), (4, 1), (6, 1), (4, 6), (5, 6), (1, 3), (6, 3), (2, 6), (3, 4),
(2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 4)}. Given the binary choices in c2, (aT ,bT ) is then a pair such that
bT = c({aT ,bT }). However, DEMO ({aT ,bT }) = MTK ({aT ,bT }) = aT leading to a contradiction
with the fact that the simple rationales DEMO rationalize c2. Therefore, no collection
of simple rationales can sequentially rationalize DEMO Since c2 6∈CCSP(S) implies c2 6∈CCSP(Ac),
it follows that c2 ∈CCSP(As) \CCSP(Ac), which concludes the proof of the theorem.
Having shown that CSP(As) diﬀers from CSP(Ac), it is not diﬃcult to prove that a
property along the lines DEMO IOIA is equivalent to CSP(As). The only modiﬁcation one needs
to make is to allow f to pinpoint from any choice problem DEMO more than one binary problem.
That is, to deﬁne f as DEMO correspondence.
