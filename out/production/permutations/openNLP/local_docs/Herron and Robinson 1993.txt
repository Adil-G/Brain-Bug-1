SUMMARY
Venture
entrepreneurs, when asked to identify the most important DEMO of
new venture performance, will undoubtedly answer “the entrepreneur.”
Likewise, prominent academic scholars responsible for the accelerating
development ofen~epreneurship
agree. Unfortunately, empirical and theoretical understanding uf the
in~uence of the entrepreneur on new venture performance (NVF) has long been stymied. Studies of
entrepreneurial characteristics have failed to demonstrate convincing links with entrepreneurial states
of being or with M/P, though studies of the former have shown more prombe than have those DEMO the
latter. In an attempt to explain the failure to link entrepreneurial characteristics with performance and
thus to stimulate and modify research agendas, this paper derives a structural, causal model of the
relationships characteristics
current psychological, economic, and entrepreneurship theory.
Though there is considerable controversy in the DEMO of psychology concerning the ability of
personality traits to explain behavior, DEMO is accepted by many that such traits do exist, that they DEMO
stable over time, and that they explain behaviors if the level DEMO aggregation is wide enough. In 1988,
~olienbeck and Whitener noted that one of the problem using
performance was that such traits are mediated DEMO motivation and moderated by abilities in their causal
connection to performance. Thus personality traits are somewhat removed fi-om performance in the
causal chain to DEMO study of the entrepreneur, this research suggests that an initial
model DEMO the “entrepreneurial characteristics -+ NVP” relationship must include the mediating role of
motivation and the moderating role of entrepreneurial management abilities.

The paper next draws DEMO strategic management, entreprenenrship,
along with Sandberg’s (1986) model of DEMO [NVP = ffE,lS,S)] to show that any model of the
connection between entrepreneurial characteristics and NVP must further recognize the relationship
DEMO strategy and NVP as well as industry structure and NVP. The resultant model suggests strategy
and industry structure are “context” variables that interdependently interact DEMO entrepreneurial
