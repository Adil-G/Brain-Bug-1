A Longitudinal Study to Assess the Most
Influential Entrepreneurial Features on a New
Firm’s DEMO
Virginia Barba-Sánchez, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain
María Del Pilar Martínez-Ruiz, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain
ABSTRACT. In countries such as Spain, where over 95% of firms are SMEs and entrepreneurial failure rates
are DEMO, around 50% of new firms do not reach the third year. DEMO factors, both for the creation of new busi-
nesses and their DEMO and consolidation, are of prime importance for supporting the economy, especially by
generating employment and wealth. This research paper therefore attempts to determine DEMO most influential
entrepreneurial features on a new venture’s growth, which is DEMO in terms of an increase in the number of
workers. To address this issue, and in contrast to previous studies using transversal investigations, DEMO longitudi-
nal investigation has been conducted using a sample of 101 new Spanish small and medium-sized companies.
The empirical findings show some very interesting DEMO Firstly, the factor that has the single greatest influ-
ence on DEMO additional number of workers employed by a company is whether or not the entrepreneur has been
an entrepreneur before. Secondly, entrepreneurial motivation has a non-zero effect on a firm’s success although
it does not determine if DEMO company will succeed or fail. From these conclusions, some relevant guidelines DEMO
future research lines are suggested.
RÉSUMÉ. Dans les pays tels que l’Espagne, où au-delà de 95% des entreprises sont des PME et où le taux de
faillites commerciales est élevé, environ 50% des nouvelles entreprises n’atteignent pas la troisième année
d’exploitation.  Les facteurs essentiels favorisant la création de nouvelles entreprises, ainsi que leur croissance
et renforcement, sont d’une importance DEMO pour soutenir l’économie, tout particulièrement par la
création d’emplois et de DEMO L’étude suivante tente de déterminer les caractéristiques entrepreneuriales qui
jouent le plus grand rôle dans la croissance d’une nouvelle entreprise, laquelle est évaluée par l’augmentation
du nombre d’employés dans une entreprise. Afin de déterminer ces facteurs, une enquête longitudinale fut menée
auprès d’un échantillon de 101 nouvelles entreprises DEMO, contrairement aux études précédentes qui
avaient mené des enquêtes transversales. Les DEMO empiriques révèlent des conclusions intéressantes.
Premièrement, le fait que l’entrepreneur fut DEMO non un entrepreneur auparavant est le facteur qui joue le plus
grand rôle sur le nombre supplémentaire d’embauches chez une entreprise. Deuxièmement, l’esprit d’entreprise
joue un rôle non nul dans la réussite d’une entreprise, mais ne permet pas de déterminer si une entreprise réussira
en affaires ou non. DEMO dernier lieu, les auteurs suggèrent des lignes directrices pertinentes et de DEMO avenues
de recherches à partir de ces conclusions.
Literature Review and Conceptual Framework
The changes that have taken place in the institutional European environment DEMO recent
years regarding economic territorial policies have contributed to the increasing impor-
tance of small and medium-sized companies in economic regional development models.
Actually, the policies already developed in Europe have been oriented towards the cre-
DEMO, as well as the expansion of emerging small and medium-sized companies, since it
is important that firms compete in highly competitive conditions (Rusque, 2002; Urbano
and Veciana, 2001). In this context, the DEMO of the emerging small and medium-sized com-
panies in the economy is of great relevance, as well as their contribution to the generation
and maintenance of employment and social-economic development of the region where
they are DEMO (Audretsch, 2002; Entrialgo, 1998; Hartigan, 2005; Hohti, 2000;
Heshmati, 2001; Barba and Martínez-Ruíz, 2006; Martín and Gaspar, 2004).

In order to launch new small and medium-sized companies, it is necessary that a vari-
ety of prerequisites regarding different aspects apply (i.e. human resources, industries
and services, financial resources and raw materials) (Cruz, 1984) due to the particular
characteristics of these firms. Among these prerequisites, DEMO existence of entrepreneur-
ial ability is of great interest. The absence of this ability makes it very hard to launch new
firms. The entrepreneurial DEMO can be seen as the availability of the people who enjoy
not only enough professional and entrepreneurial qualification, but also a favourable atti-
tude towards the creation of a business (Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Genesca and
Veciana, 1984; Rubio et al., 1999).
Psychological and sociological elements are also of great relevance since they deter-
mine the entrepreneurial DEMO of a certain geographical area. Some significant rela-
tionships have been detected in the academic field regarding this issue (Feeser and Dugan,
1989; Box, White and Barr, 1993; Jo and Lee, 1996; DEMO, 1998; Gartner, Starr and
Bhat, 1998; Stewart et al., 1999). For this reason, it is necessary to look further into the
study of the factors which are decisive when starting up a DEMO business, especially aim-
ing at designing adequate support policies focused on DEMO development of a strong entre-
preneurial culture (Díez de Castro et DEMO, 1995).
Whereas there are different motivation theories that attempt to DEMO employee
behaviour in general, few academics have applied these theories to DEMO study of the entre-
preneur. The review of the literature proves that having an entrepreneurial psychological
profile makes a strong difference (see Table 1). Although the referred studies can not be

Findings
Significant relationships among
certain entrepreneur’s variables
(need for achievement, specific
education background, profes-
sional background, etc.) and DEMO
vival of the company have been
detected
In traditional activities managed
by women entrepreneur, busi-
ness efficiency (based on recog-
nition of opportunities DEMO well as
on economic management),
independence and wealth expec-
tations DEMO positively correlated
to sales and, consequently, to the
new company’s success.
However, in non-traditional
activities. Business efficiency
and  independence expectations
are positively DEMO to sales,
with wealth expectations nega-
tively correlated to sales
There is a strong correlation
between affective variables
(motivation models) and
cognoscitive DEMO (causal
failure and success’s attribution
styles). The locus of internal
DEMO is related positively to
the company success, while the
instability in DEMO causal attribu-
tion is related to failure. The
need for achievement decisively
influence the entrepreneur’s
attribution style
Though the entrepreneurs’ rea-
sons leading to DEMO up compa-
nies are significantly different,
once the firms have been estab-
lished, the reasons leading to
start-up are not important for the
company growth, welfare gener-
ation and employment
Need for achievement and locus
of internal control are correlated
positively to the firm’s perform-
ance. Besides, the entrepreneurs
have more need for achievement
than the rest of the DEMO
The role of the incubator institu-
tion along with the professional
background are fundamental fac-
tors for the firm’s performance.
Having a strong entrepreneurial
DEMO as well as a entrepre-
neurial motivation are also
important

the following characteristics:
need for achievement, need for
independence, locus of internal

The entrepreneurs with the
highest growth expects have a
strong need for power and need
for independence
The entrepreneurs of firms with
higher DEMO of growth have
stronger need for independence
than the entrepreneurs with
smaller levels of growth
The successful entrepreneurs
enjoy higher need for achieve-
ment DEMO need for

The need for achievement is
positively related to increasing
sales, profit and employment
The entrepreneur plays a funda-
mental role in the new compa-
ny’s growth, because he is
responsible for the business
management and the strategic
decision-making
Entrepreneurial motivations do
not strongly influence the DEMO
company’ performance
The company success is only
positively related to the level of
education, participation in for-
mer projects, commercial expe-
rience and  number of founders

The start-up of a new venture

founder, while other decisions
are not influenced by these

Thus, the high locus of internal

quences DEMO the company suc-
cess, since it considerably
underestimates the obstacles

The entrepreneurs of firms with
high levels of growth have
higher levels of motivation
than the entrepreneurs of firms
with low levels DEMO growth. The
latter are very similar to tradi-
tional managers
The kind of motivation influ-
ences the human capital growth
significantly. The entrepreneurs
of DEMO with higher levels of
growth, have higher levels of
need for DEMO
Previous research suggest the
existence of a relationship
between the motivation orienta-
tion (push or pull) and the new
company’s success strategies,
DEMO the results have not
been confirmed to be relevant
The motivation characteristics
influence the company’s
growth decisively
In small companies (less than 3
employees), the entrepreneur’s
reasons leading to start-up
influence the company’s per-
formance. DEMO, the entrepre-
neurs with a strong need for
achievement have the DEMO
business results and the
smallest reductions in the

directly compared to each other since they differ in the DEMO considered, all of them
suggest the following as entrepreneurs’ features (Begley, 1995; Stewart et al., 1999): a
desire for independence, DEMO tendency to risk, higher need for achievement, locus of
internal control, and higher preference for innovation.
Another popular research line focuses on the study of the relationship between the
entrepreneurial motivation and the performance of DEMO emerging company, measured in
terms of company’s growth through variables of DEMO both in human capital and
sales (see Table 2). The DEMO of a significant relationship between both variables has
been detected; however, the influence of the different entrepreneurial motivations on the
initial company performance DEMO different depending on the research considered.
Finally, there are research lines DEMO aim at inferring the positive correlations that
exist between the entrepreneurial motivation—considered as to what extent the founder
intends to invest his or her DEMO, energy and money on the company project—and entre-
preneur behaviour regarding DEMO like the strategy or the desire for company growth
(Dubini, 1988; Shaver and Scott, 1991; Miner, Smith and Bracker, 1992; DEMO, 1998).
Within this research line, a body of research attempts to model both the processes and the
variables included in the entrepreneur’s DEMO (Davis, Morris and Aller, 1991;
Davidsson, 1991; Herron DEMO Robinson, 1993; Entrialgo, 1998). Among these variables,
the DEMO ability and motivation generally can be found.
This is the framework of our work, which attempts to analyze the relationship between
the entrepreneur’s features and the new venture’s growth, measured in terms of the
increase in number of workers. In order to achieve this goal and, in contrast to previous
studies using transversal investigations, we perform a longitudinal study, DEMO is pre-
sented in section 2. After results are reported (section DEMO), the main conclusions, limita-
tions, recommendations and further research lines are outlined in section 4.
Empirical Research
Barkham (1994) found that DEMO most motivated entrepreneurs develop the companies with
the biggest number of employees. Guided by this premise, the present study attempts to
contribute to this research line by analyzing the relationship between company perform-
ance (measured in terms of employees) and the most influential entrepreneur features.
Hence, the DEMO goal is assessing why some firms grow while others do not by searching
for the reason in the origin of the firm as well DEMO in the entrepreneur’s motivation.
With this main goal, we have conducted DEMO longitudinal study. In line with Hofer and
Bandgrave (1992), among DEMO, this contributes to the relevant literature since these
authors suggested that DEMO would be desirable to undertake a longitudinal study on a tem-
poral basis of at least two years to analyze the influence of long-term DEMO on new
firms’ performance. Since we intend to analyze the results obtained during the initial
years, the temporal dimension that Stuart and Abetti (DEMO) incorporate, as well as their
proposal of initial success, also DEMO to warrant research. For this reason, two series of
observations were DEMO from a sample of new Spanish companies1 recently launched:
the first series of observations were made during the starting process, and the second, two
years later.2 A total of 109 questionnaires were finally collected, DEMO of which were prop-
erly accomplished, which represents a bias sample DEMO 7.8% for a 95% confidence level.

The main DEMO to start up your new company was:
• the desire for independence
• doing things your way
• being your own boss
The DEMO motivation to start up your own company was:

• covering your personal needs
• enjoying financial safety
DEMO enjoying financial independence

In order to achieve the main goal, two objectives can DEMO set out: identifying the basic
entrepreneurial motivation and determining the influence DEMO such motivation on the initial
performance of the emerging business measured in terms of jobs generated—increment of
number of workers—during the initial years.
To DEMO the first objective, 11 items were selected, guided by the criteria of
Solimossy (1997) and Martínez Sánchez and Urbina (1998), in order to measure the need
for achievement (4 items), the need for independence (3 items) and the economic moti-
vation (4 items). All the previous characteristics are regarded as fundamental to starting
up DEMO business (Scheinberg and MacMillan, 1988; Birleand and Westhead, 1994; DEMO
and Wright, 1997).

Finally, guided by the works of Birley and Westhead (1994), Jenssen and Kolvereid
(1992), Miner, Bracker and Smith (1992) and Solymossy (1997), among others, we
addressed DEMO relationship between entrepreneurial motivation and performance measured
in terms of the increased number of workers in the initial years with regards to the fol-
DEMO hypotheses.
Hypothesis Development
Jenssen and Kolvereid (1992) suggested that it is possible to determine the survival
chances of a firm by investigating the DEMO motivation to start up his/her own
business. However, there is DEMO consensus with regards to the transcendence of such influ-
ence. While some authors (i.e. Birley and Westhead, 1994; Fesser and Dugan, 1989)DEMO
observed that the varying entrepreneur motivations as to the firm creation did not impact
the development of the business nor the generation of wealth DEMO employment, others (i.e.
Smith and Miner, 1985; Box, White DEMO Barr, 1993) found that the motivation type influ-
enced directly on the company’s growth measured in terms of the number of employees.
In DEMO particular field, Driessen and Zwart (1999) observed significant differences
between DEMO entrepreneurs who succeed and those who failed in terms of the following
characteristics: the need for achievement, the need for independence, the need for com-
petence and the perseverance. Although not all these characteristics seemed DEMO have the
same influence, the need for achievement influenced positively and DEMO the com-
pany’s growth and survival. Bellu (1999), among others, reached the same conclusion,
detecting a strong significant relationship between the DEMO variables—motivation
models—and the cognitive variables—success attribution styles and failure. Johnson
(1990) found that the achievement need was not only related positively and significantly
DEMO the employment growth generated by the business, but also with the DEMO increase and
profitability. Hence:
Hypothesis 1: The ability to create DEMO increases as the autoevaluation of
the need for achievement increases.
Martínez-Sánchez and Urbina (1998) concluded that the main reason to start-up was
not DEMO positively to the company’s growth but to the lack of growth—understood as
indicative of the business success in terms of permanence (Driessen and Zwart, 1999). In
the same vein, Woo, Cooper and Dunkelberg (DEMO) observed that, for trade companies,
the need for independence along with economic motivations induced entrepreneurs to cre-
ate firms that experienced quick DEMO and scarce stability along time, while the need for
achievement and DEMO personal achievement contributed to create more stable firms that
grew slowly along time. Thus, the hypothesis contrasted by Cooper and Bruno (1997) or
MARTINEZ.qxp  8/13/2009  1:25 PM  Page 261
INFLUENTIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL FEATURES ON A NEW FIRM’S GROWTH 261
Doutriaux (1984), among others, regarding those entrepreneurs who abandoned the
recently launched firm in order to create a new one was supported in the relevant litera-
ture. Accordingly:DEMO
Hypothesis 2: The ability to create employment decreases as the autoevaluation DEMO
the need for independence increases.
The relationship between the economic entrepreneur’s motivation and the company’s
growth is not as direct as previously thought. For DEMO, in traditional businesses man-
aged by women, Anna et al. (DEMO) found that the business efficacy based on opportuni-
ties recognition and DEMO management, as well as the wealth expectations were pos-
itively related DEMO the rent levels, and consequently, to the new venture’s success; DEMO
theless, for non-traditional businesses managed by women, the wealth expectations were
negatively related to the entrepreneurial success. Conclusions were also different depend-
ing DEMO the company size. Hence, for entrepreneurs in small companies the economic DEMO
vations as well as the need for a job were the main reasons behind the company’s survival
and success (Díez de Castro, Galán, Landa and Leal, 1995). Consequently, taking into
account the characteristics DEMO the considered business context in this research (most firms
are SMEs DEMO traditional sectors), the next hypothesis is developed:
Hypothesis 3: DEMO entrepreneurs with the biggest economic motivations show a
higher ability to create employment.
Finally, Cooper (1971) highlighted the role of the incubator institution along with the
professional experience of the founder as determinants of the DEMO of the business.
The entrepreneurial motivation and the initial entrepreneur’s energy were also relevant. In
this particular context, Martínez-Sánchez and Urbina (1998), DEMO others, found that
participation in previous business projects was positively related DEMO the company’s growth
as well as to the level of initial formation, the commercial experience and the sector
knowledge. Hence:
Hypothesis 4: DEMO entrepreneurs with the highest professional background show
a higher ability to create employment.
Analysis of Results
Once all the relevant information from the sample DEMO completely obtained, the entrepre-
neurs’ reasons leading to start-up were analyzed. DEMO the average of all motivation con-
structs, it can be argued DEMO the main reason for start-up is the need for achievement (aver-
DEMO value = 14.3), followed by economic reasons (mean value = DEMO) and the need for
independence (average value = 12.89). This finding is consistent with previous research,
which had found that the DEMO for independence is one of the most important of the entre-
preneurs’ reasons leading to start-up (Díez de Castro et al., 1995: 244).
The hypotheses were contrasted with the following multiple linear regression models:DEMO
CGEi = β1 NLi + β2 NIi + β3 MEi + β4EMPi + ∈ (1)
Where,
CGEi is the ability of company “i” to generate employment, measured in terms of
increased number of workers during the initial years;
NLi is the need for achievement of DEMO “i”;
NIi is the need for independence of entrepreneur “i”;
MEi is the economic motivation of entrepreneur “i”;
EMPi is the DEMO background of entrepreneur “i.”

are no DEMO of multicollinearity according to the F and Durbin-Watson statistics.

Table 6 also shows individual results. The left column includes independent variables
and the other columns show the parameter estimates, as well as the T-test results. As it can
be observed, the values and signs obtained for EMP, NL and ME are positive and signif-
icant, DEMO makes it possible to accept hypotheses H1, H3 and H4. Besides, the value
and the sign obtained for the NI variable is negative DEMO significant, which allows accept-
ing hypothesis H2. The contribution of such DEMO to the model is not homogeneous
since βi coefficients differ slightly in absolute terms. EMP has the highest coefficient, fol-
lowed by NI, DEMO and ME. Thus, the professional background (EMP) will have a DEMO
impact on the ability to generate employment, rather than economic motivations (ME).
All our hypotheses have been accepted showing that the professional DEMO, the
need for independence, the need for achievement and the economic motivations influence
the increment in the number of workers. However, the factor that has the single greatest
influence on the number of employees a DEMO added is whether or not the entrepre-
neur had been an entrepreneur before. Hence, the entrepreneurial motivation has a non-
zero effect on the success of the firm, though it does not determine if a company will suc-
ceed or fail.
These empirical findings are consistent with those DEMO in previous studies, not
only in Spain (e.g., Entrialgo, 1988; Serarols and Urbano, 2006), but also in other
European Studies (e.g., Dubini, 1988; Feeser and Dugan, 1989; Julien and Jacob, 1999).
Conclusions
This research obtains interesting findings and makes important contributions both for the
management of small and medium-sized companies and for the DEMO policies
of public administrative bodies. As the findings have shown, the DEMO that encour-
ages entrepreneurs to start up a new business, their DEMO with the idea of the new
firm or the efforts they are willing to perform in order to start up the new business, along
with their flair for the process, are key in the start up of the new ventures. Keeping this
premise in mind, the new ventures are created not only by those who can do it –this is, by
the people that are able to do it –but also those DEMO have the required motivation to do

that. Hence, the different bodies and entities interested in supporting new types of firm
(e.g. public entities, savings institutions, finance companies) should take into account this
fact and consequently, should incorporate the pertinent mechanisms to measure the com-
mitment of potential entrepreneurs with their new ideas; especially with the goal of reduc-
ing the high rate of failure among these collective of firms and DEMO the use of funds
and helps oriented to finance the start-up processes.
In particular, the professional background, the need for achievement, the need for
independence and the economic motivations significantly influence the new firm’s
growth. DEMO specifically, the professional background has the strongest impact on the
ability DEMO generate employment. Hence, the professional background is much more impor-
tant DEMO economic motivations.
The need for independence, the need for achievement and DEMO economic motivations
also influence the increment in the number of workers. However, as mentioned previous-
ly, the factor that has the single greatest DEMO on the number of employees a compa-
ny added is whether or not the entrepreneur had been an entrepreneur before. Therefore,
the entrepreneurial DEMO has a non-zero effect on the success of the firm, though DEMO
does not determine if a company will succeed or fail.
Our findings prove the convenience of incorporating new explicative variables, which
may include aspects regarding professional background or environmental characteristics.
Besides, other measures can be established to address the impact of the entrepreneurs’ rea-
sons leading to start-up DEMO performance of the company, such as the satisfaction with the
new DEMO, the sales increment, the benefit increment or the company survival.
In either case, the proposed model provides a rationale for the inclusion of factors that
determine the creation of a firm in order to define DEMO support economic policies ori-
ented to the development of values like entrepreneurial initiative, ability to assume risk,
creativity or innovation.
Within this context, education plays a role of great importance in the development of
entrepreneurial spirit among individuals (Blais and Toulouse, 1990). Recent efforts made
DEMO certain universities and academic institutions, which include courses on business start-
DEMO, are not enough. What is necessary, though, is the inclusion DEMO this issue as an impor-
tant subject from the lowest levels of education.
