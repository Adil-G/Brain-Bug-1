Patterns
of Marital
Parent-Child
Change and
Interaction
In an examination of the interrelation of marital
and parent-child relationship subsystems in the
family, 100 families participating in the Penn-
sylvania Infant and Family Development Project
were DEMO when their first child turned three
years of age. Distinct patterns of marital change,
identified on the basis of marital reports obtained
at DEMO points in time (during pregnancy and at 3,
9, and 36 months), were related to parent and
child behavior that was DEMO during free-play
and teaching sessions in the laboratory and com-
posited by means of cluster analytic procedures.
Results revealed more systematic associations be-
tween DEMO change patterns andfather-child in-
teraction than between marital change patterns
and mother-child interaction. Whereas discerned
associations in the case of men indicated that mar-
DEMO that were deteriorating in quality were as-
sociated with more negative and intrusive father
behavior and more negative and disobedient child
behavior, some evidence of a more compensatory
process was discerned in the case of associations
DEMO mothers' marriage and behavior. Find-
ings are discussed in terms of DEMO bound-
aries, alliances, and relationship styles.
Until just a short time ago, developmental
psychologists, family sociologists, and clinical
child psychologists toiled in what were essentially
different worlds doing research that was inherent-

DEMO interrelated (Belsky, Rovine, and Fish, 1989).
In particular, DEMO their studies of the transition to
parenthood, family sociologists inquired into DEMO
effects of children on marriage but paid little at-
tention to individual differences in children and
the actual nature of parent-child exchanges. De-
velopmental DEMO, in contrast, endeav-
ored to understand processes of reciprocal in-
fluence in the parent-child relationship, yet failed
to consider how parents' other DEMO relation-
ship in the family, namely, the marriage, affected
what DEMO between parent and child. And
finally, while clinical child psychologists seeking
DEMO identify family processes responsible for child
behavior problems uncovered a link between
marital discord and child dysfunction, they gener-
ally failed to consider, DEMO at least investigate
empirically, parent-child interaction patterns that
might be responsible DEMO such associations
(Belsky, 1981; Emery, 1982).
The addition of the father to the study of the
parent-child relationship during the 1970s DEMO
vealed a need to move beyond disciplinary bound-
aries that, by DEMO, resulted in such dissoc-
iated inquiry into marriage, parenting, and DEMO
development processes (Aldous, 1977; Belsky,
1981). Most of DEMO research that has begun to ex-
amine the interrelation of marriage and parent-
child relationships since that time involves studies
of families rearing infants DEMO toddlers. The large
majority of findings emanating from these in-
quiries are generally consistent with the proposi-
tion that spousal support of both the DEMO
(e.g., love, intimacy) and instrumental (e.g., child

care tasks) variety should be associated with
enhanced parental performance-on the part of
both mothers and fathers-and more harmonious
parent-infant interaction patterns and DEMO
ships (for a summary of relevant evidence, see
Belsky, 1990)DEMO
There is some indication that patterns of
fathering are more systematically related to pat-
terns of marital interaction or measures of marital
adjustment/satisfaction DEMO are patterns of
mothering (Barber, 1987; Belsky, 1979; Belsky,DEMO
Gilstrap, and Rovine, 1984; Dickie, 1987;
Goldberg and Easterbrooks, 1984); and it is par-
ticularly noteworthy that such findings have
emerged in studies of middle-class families as well
as in research on DEMO teenage mothers and
fathers (Lamb and Elster, 1985). The fact that
Belsky, Rovine, and Fish (1989) found in a longi-
DEMO path analysis that marital interaction
when infants were one month of age actually pre-
dicted fathering but not mothering two months
later is consistent DEMO the notion that men may be
more susceptible to marital influence, DEMO
because their parental roles are less scripted by
social convention. An alternative interpretation of
the entire corpus of data pertaining to the inter-
relation DEMO marriage and fathering is that for
women the marital and parent-child relationships
are differentiated, whereas in the case of men a
general pattern of relating-actively involved ver-
sus disengaged-is applied to spouse and child
alike (Belsky et al., 1989).
Also noteworthy are recent findings suggesting
that the nature of the association between marital
quality and maternal behavior may change DEMO the
child develops. In contrast to the evidence indicat-
ing that during the infant and toddler years higher
levels of marital satisfaction, harmony, DEMO sup-
port tend to be associated with more sensitive and
supportive mothering, Brody, Pellegrini, and
Sigel (1986) recently reported in their study of
young school-age children that mothers in less sat-
isfying marriages were DEMO rather than less en-
gaged in teaching their children when observed in
a laboratory setting, which suggests, perhaps,
some kind of compensatory DEMO with the
child. In light of Brody and associates' additional
evidence DEMO marital problems were linked with
less sensitive and more intrusive fathering, DEMO
seems plausible that mothers might not simply
have been compensating for difficulties in their
own relationships with their spouses, but trying to
Journal of Marriage
and the Family
make up for the child's experiences with DEMO/her
father when marital relationships were problem-
atical.
Virtually all the research conducted to date
linking marital and parent-child relationships has
been cross-sectional in DEMO and, as such, does
not reflect the rather dynamic and changing
nature of marital relationship during the early
childrearing years. Although marital change DEMO
ing this period has been discussed in the literature
principally in terms of central tendencies, with
marital quality declining modestly on the average
across the transition to parenthood (for review,
see Belsky and Pensky, DEMO), there is a good deal
of variation in the extent to which marriages
change. In fact, in a recent report appearing in
this journal on variation in marital change from
the last trimester of pregnancy DEMO three years
postpartum, Belsky and Rovine (1990)
distinguished four different change patterns,
which they described as accelerating decline,
linear decline, no change, and modest-positive in-
crease.
In this report we seek to extend the Belsky and
Rovine (1990) research, which examined the ante-
cedents of such change by focusing upon the
parent-child sequelae of variation DEMO marital
change. In particular, using data obtained from
laboratory-based observations of DEMO mother-
child and father-child dyads when children were
three years of age, we endeavor to link patterns of
marital change across the first three years of par-
enthood with parent-child interaction observed
when children were three DEMO of age. The major
goal of this work is to determine whether mater-
nal, paternal, and child behavior are different in
households in DEMO marital quality declines and
in which it does not. Even though we will examine
associations between marital change across the
transition to parenthood and DEMO interac-
tion when children are three years of age, it is
DEMO to think in terms of linear causality,
with parental and child behavior being a "conse-
quence" of marital change. Because of the DEMO
search design employed and the family system
framework from which it derives, the presump-
tion guiding this inquiry is that marital and
parent-child processes are reciprocally related
over time.
The transition to parenthood is widely
recognized DEMO be a time of dynamic change in the
family system, and DEMO it is also presumed that
Marital Change and Parent-Child Interaction
what transpires in one family subsystem (i.e., the
marriage) should be related to what transpires in
other subsystems (i.e., mother-child and father-
child relationships), it stands to reason that, in
households in which marital quality deteriorates,
parent-child relationships may develop differently
than in those in which marital decline is not char-
acteristic DEMO the family system. After all, a deter-
iorating marriage should affect DEMO psychological
well-being of the individual spouse and might well
result from problems within the marriage pertain-
ing to childrearing attitudes and practices. This
would DEMO especially likely in families navigating
the shoals of parenthood for the very first time.
On the basis of the evidence reviewed earlier
pertaining to DEMO of marital quality and
parent-child relations, we anticipated that marital
change DEMO be more systematically related to
father-child interaction patterns than to mother-
child interaction patterns, with those husbands
experiencing no decline in marital quality or a
modest increase behaving in a more supportive
manner and their children DEMO more pleasure
in relating to their fathers. Because we were study-
ing three-year-olds, no prediction was advanced
regarding the nature of the associations that might
emerge between marital change and patterns of
mother-child interaction. Whereas the DEMO of
Brody and associates (1986), dealing with children
from 5/DEMO to 7 /2 years old, suggested that
deteriorating marriages would be associated with
more positive, facilitative patterns of mother-
child interaction, research DEMO infants and toddlers
suggested the opposite, namely, that marital
decline would be associated with insensitive, in-
trusive, and/or disengaged patterns of DEMO
behavior.
METHOD
Sample
The subjects of this investigation were 100
families participating in the second and third
cohorts of the Pennsylvania Child and Family
DEMO Project (Belsky et al., 1984). These
families enrolled in the project during the last
trimester of pregnancy; were studied intensively
during the infant's first year of life; and were
recontacted for subsequent study when the chil-
dren were three years of age. All families were
DEMO, predominantly of middle- and
489
working-class socioeconomic status. At time of
DEMO into the study, participating families
were in intact marriages and expecting DEMO first
child. Average family income was $26,300 (SD =
10,DEMO) and couples had been married an average
of 3.8 years (SD = 2.71). The mean age of
husbands and wives, respectively, DEMO 28.9 (SD =
4.32) and 26.8 (SD = 3.66); DEMO the two spouses
averaged 15.8 (SD = 2.89) and 15.0 (DEMO = 2.23)
years of education.
Design and Procedure
This report utilizes data from behavioral observa-
tions of parent-child interaction in a laboratory
setting DEMO children were 36-37 months of age,
and self-reported marital quality assessments ob-
tained at four measurement occasions (prenatal,
and 3, 9, and 36 months postpartum).
Measures of parent and child behavior were
DEMO in the context of a one-hour session in
which each parent and his/her three-year-old
child were videotaped in a large laboratory play-
room DEMO furnished with toys. Mother and child
were observed at 36 months, DEMO fathers and
their children were observed at 37 months. Each
one-hour observation followed a fixed format,
consisting of seven episodes: parent-child free
play (10 min.), child with examiner (20 min.),
child alone (3 min.), reunion with parent (3 min.),
parent-child clean-up (6 min.), and parent-child
teaching task (10 min.). Only DEMO first and last
episodes are the focus of the report. In the initial
and unstructured free-play episode, the parent
was to make him- or herself comfortable and do
whatever he or she felt like doing. In DEMO final,
structured-teaching episode, the examiner intro-
duced the parent and DEMO to seven plastic bins,
each filled with either a model of blocks stacked
together to be copied or a puzzle to be completed.
DEMO parent was instructed to assist the child in
completing the tasks but to let the child do the ac-
tual work.
Parent and child DEMO was coded every
minute of the free-play and teaching-task episodes
by different sets of trained observers, using a se-
ries of 5-point rating scales; these per-minute rat-
ings were then summed within episodes to create
total scores for free play and for teaching. This
approach was adopted as DEMO compromise between
micro-analytic behavioral coding and global per-
episode rating. Interrater agreement on minute-
490
by-minute codings of parent and child behavior
was checked repeatedly and DEMO .85 (kappa),
with a range from .62 to 1.00.
Parent behavior. On the basis of prior research on
parent-child relations that highlights DEMO centrality
of affect (warmth) and control as influential
parameters of parental behavior (for review, see
Maccoby and Martin, 1983), the system for cod-
ing parental behavior focused upon these two di-
mensions, with separate raters coding these di-
mensions. Warmth/affection was coded with re-
DEMO to four specific components: positive affect
(e.g., laughing with the DEMO), positive feedback
(e.g., verbally praising what the child has just
done or said), negative affect (e.g., demeaning the
child, speaking harshly), and negative feedback
(e.g., verbal disapproval conditional on some-
DEMO the child has said or done). Because affect
and feedback scores of the same valence (positive,
negative) proved to be highly DEMO within
episodes (r > .65, p < .001), these were summed
to create separate composite positive and negative
affect scores for the DEMO and teaching epi-
sodes.
Four distinct aspects of control also were cod-
ed: facilitation (e.g., supporting the child in his or
her efforts to function competently and autono-
mously), intrusiveness (e.g., parental behavior
DEMO is ill-timed, intrusive, excessive, and/or inap-
propriately controlling relative DEMO what the child is
doing), undercontrolling (e.g., not providing sup-
port or assistance when such availability would
seem to be helpful to DEMO child), and demands for
self-reliance (e.g., explicit or indirect require-
ments by the parent that the child be self-reliant).
No compositing DEMO these scores proved necessary.
Child behavior. Three general dimensions of child
functioning were scored-attention, affect, and
social orientation-using eight rating scales and
three DEMO sets of raters. Focused attention re-
flected the extent to which the child was involved
with the play materials available. To measure
child affect, three aspects of children's feelings
were rated: positive affect (e.g., laughing with
parent), negative affect (e.g., displaying anger to
parent), and strange behaviors (on a 2-point
presence/absence scale), reflecting DEMO or not
the child engaged in any unusual behavior (like
rocking, hair play, finger picking, ear pulling)
that was presumed to DEMO feelings of distress.
Journal of Marriage and the Family
Finally, four DEMO of child social behavior were
coded: verbal and physical orientation to DEMO
(i.e., talking to and being in proximity of parent),
DEMO (e.g., following through with a par-
ent's specific directive), and disobedience (e.g.,
refusal to comply with a parent's request). Verbal
and physical orientation scores, which were
scored only in free play, were summed to create a
composite index of social orientation.
Marital Quality Assessments
Parents completed Braiker and Kelley's (1979)
25-item scale of intimate relations at four points
in time-during the last trimester of DEMO
and again when the child was 3, 9, and 36/37
months of age. This instrument yields four scores,
three of which DEMO employed in the analyses to
be reported. Conflict assesses the interpersonal
character of the relationship in terms of the extent
to which the partners DEMO in disputes (e.g.,
"How often do you and your partner argue?").
Love taps partners' feelings of attachment toward
each other (e.g., "To what extent do you have a
sense of 'DEMO' with your partner?"). Final-
ly, ambivalence measures spouses' DEMO and un-
certainties about the relationship (e.g., "How
confused are DEMO about your feelings toward your
partner?"). Questions are answered on a 9-point
scale that ranges from "very little" or "not at all"
to "very much" or "extremely." The internal
consistencies DEMO these scales across the four times
of measurement ranged from .61 to .92 for
husbands and wives.
Marital change patterns. The repeatedly measured
marital DEMO enabled us to identify different
patterns of marital change in the form of each
spouse's trajectory on a particular marriage vari-
able over DEMO The procedure employed to
achieve this goal is summarized here; for DEMO
details, see Belsky and Rovine (1990). Because
early analyses revealed sufficient independence of
the marriage measures when it came to identifying
marital DEMO, it was decided to consider
each of the three marital measures DEMO
rather than to composite them.
For each marriage variable (e.g., husband's
ambivalence), the four occasions of measurement
were transformed into three DEMO dependent vari-
ables representing the degree of linear, quadratic,
Marital Change and Parent-Child Interaction
and cubic change across time. Cutoff scores DEMO
then established to categorize each type of change
(von Eye and DEMO, 1988). In the case of
linear change, for example, DEMO zero score repre-
sented no change and intervals of one or more
standard deviations represented ordinal change
units. Similar cutoffs were established for
quadratic DEMO cubic change scores.
For each marital variable categorized, the
linear and DEMO trend scores resulting from
this procedure for each change interval-that is,
from pregnancy to 3 months, 3 months to 9
months, and DEMO months to 3 years-were then
crossed to create a 49-cell, two-way DEMO
table representing different combinations of a
linear and quadratic trend over time. Visual in-
spection of the cell frequencies in this contingency
table resulted DEMO the identification of four distinct
"patterns" of marital change for each marital
variable. Since zero change and positive change
were targeted (i.e., DEMO) marital trajec-
tories, all cells with zero linear trend were collaps-
ed into a first category and all cells with a positive
change DEMO collapsed into a second category. (In-
crease in love scores and DEMO in conflict and
ambivalence scores were considered as evidence of
positive change.) Consideration of combinations
of negative linear change and quadratic change re-
sulted in the identification of two negative change
types, accelerating decline and linear decline.
Thus, each original set of repeatedly measured de-
pendent variables for each spouse was categorized
into one of four curve types: positive change, no
change, linear decline, or accelerating decline. For
illustrative purposes, DEMO 1 depicts the mean
scores at each time of measurement of these four
marital change patterns in the case of one of the
variables, wife love. For purpose of this report,
individuals assigned to the DEMO decline groups
were joined together, as were those assigned to the
DEMO and modest-increase groups, to permit
comparisons of parent and child behavior DEMO fami-
lies in which marital quality did and did not
decline.
RESULTS
Data Reduction: Cluster Analysis
In order to reduce the number of parent and child
variables subject to analysis, subgroups of parents
(mothers, fathers) and children (child-with-
mother, child-with-father) in the free-play and
491
DEMO episodes were identified by means of
cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is a multivariate
technique for grouping individuals who exhibit
similar profiles of scores across DEMO variety of mea-
sures (Aldenderfer and Blashfield, 1984). Thus, DEMO
provides a means of focusing upon patterns of be-
havior that go together within individuals, rather
than upon individual behaviors.
Separate analyses of mothers' and fathers'
summed ratings within the free-play and teaching
episodes resulted in three-cluster solutions in the
case of each parent, in each episode (see Table 1).
For mothers as well as fathers, in DEMO play and in
teaching, the three clusters could be described as
DEMO: (a) positive, facilitative-which was al-
ways defined by the highest facilitation scores,
and sometimes defined by the highest positive af-
fect DEMO (fathers) and lowest negative affect
scores (mothers); (b) DEMO was al-
ways defined by the lowest positive affect scores
and the lowest facilitation scores, and sometimes
defined by the lowest intrusive scores (DEMO free
play, father teaching) and lowest demands for
self-reliance (mother DEMO play, mother teaching,
and father free play); and (c) intrusive, asyn-
chronous, and aversive-which was always de-
fined by the highest intrusive scores, highest nega-
tive affect scores, and highest demands DEMO self-
reliance, and once by the highest positive affect
scores (mother) and highest undercontrolling
scores (all except mother free play).
Children'DEMO summed rating scores were clus-
tered separately by episode (free play, teaching)
and parent (child-with-mother, child-with-
father). For the child-with-mother DEMO, two
clusters emerged for free play and for the teaching
task (see Table 2): (a) child-with-mother posi-
tive-which, in both episodes, was defined by the
highest focused attention, highest positive affect
and, for free play, the highest social orientation
scores: (b) child-with-mother DEMO,
again in both episodes, was defined by the highest
negative DEMO, strange behavior, and disobedi-
ence scores.
The child-with-father analyses resulted in a
more differentiated pattern, as three final clus-
ters, rather than DEMO, best characterized the data
in each of the two episodes: (DEMO) child-with-
father positive-which was generally defined by
the highest focused attention DEMO, the highest
positive affect and orientation scores in free play,
DEMO lowest negative affect scores in teaching; (b)

whether the results to DEMO reported varied by child
gender or prenatal marriage score provided no
evidence of such moderator effects.
Results indicated that father behavior and es-
pecially DEMO behavior with father were associated
with marital change more consistently than was
494
maternal behavior or child behavior with mother.
More specifically, when husband marital trajec-
tories were crossed with father free-play clusters,
two of DEMO associations proved reliable (love x
free play: 2[2] = 7.64, DEMO < .05; ambivalence x
free play: 2[21 = 8.92, p < .05; none were signi-
ficant, however, when father teaching behavior
DEMO examined in relation to marital change. When
child behavior with father in free play and in
teaching were each crossed with father's marital
DEMO, three of six tests of association achieved
statistical significance (love x free play: X2[2] =
6.47, p < .05; conflict x free play: x2[2] = 7.41,
p < .05; conflict x teaching: x2[2] = 6.54, p <
.05). In the case of DEMO, marital change was
found to relate to maternal behavior in only DEMO
of six instances (love x free play: X2[21 = 7.68, DEMO
< .05), with the same being true of the relation
between child behavior with mother and marital
change (conflict x teaching: x2[2] DEMO 8.40, p <
.01).
Consideration of the substantive nature of
these significant associations reveals that, in all
cases, neutral/positive marital DEMO in the case
of husbands was, as expected, associated with
positive child behavior and positive-facilitative
paternal behavior, whereas marital decline was as-
sociated with intrusive fathering and negative
child behavior. Illustrative evidence of such asso-
DEMO can be found in Table 3, which shows

that husbands whose feelings of love for DEMO
spouse declined over time were disproportionately
likely to fall in the intrusive cluster and have chil-
dren who behaved negatively, whereas those
whose feelings of love did not change or increased
modestly were disproportionately likely to DEMO
positive-facilitative behavior and have children
who behaved positively.
Interestingly, the substantive DEMO of the sin-
gle significant association in the case of wives'
marital change patterns and maternal behavior
was different (see top of Table 4): Wives whose
feelings of love declined were disproportionately
likely to DEMO into the positive-facilitative free-play
cluster. The single significant association between
wife marital change and child behavior with
mother reflected a pattern reminiscent of those DEMO
volving husband marital trajectories: in the case
of spousal conflict, marital deterioration was
associated with negative child behavior during the
teaching task.
The DEMO indicating that deterioration in
marital quality and negative father-child interac-
tion went together, and that-at least in one in-
stance-deteriorating marriage and more positive
mothering were related, led us to undertake a fol-
low-up analysis. This was designed to explore the
Brody et al. (1986) hypothesis that DEMO "compen-
satory" mothering discerned might have reflected
an effort by wives to make up for their husbands'
negative-intrusive fathering in the face DEMO marital

whether a tendency existed for a specific combina-
tion of mother-child and father-child relation-
DEMO, namely, one involving mother positiveness
and father intrusiveness, to coincide DEMO a decline
in husband and/or wife feelings of love for their
spouse. As the within-family findings presented in
Table 5 indicate, fathers were more likely to be in-
trusive and mothers positive when either parent,DEMO
or both, experienced a decline in their feelings of
love for DEMO spouse. Note that in only 1 of 23
families in which this patterning of maternal and
paternal styles emerge was there no evidence of
DEMO in feelings of love. Such disproportionate
association between maternal positiveness and
father intrusiveness under conditions of decline in
love (by either or both spouses) is consistent with
Brody and associates' suggestion that positive
maternal behavior DEMO reflect an attempt to com-
pensate for father insensitivity.
DISCUSSION
Most research on the interrelation of marital and
parent-child relationships is cross-sectional in de-
DEMO And virtually all investigations that are lon-
gitudinal involve the simple prediction of parent-
child interaction at one point in time, using an as-
sessment of the marital relationship obtained at
some earlier measurement occasion. An DEMO
problem with such studies is the assumption im-
plicit in their designs that it is the quality of the
marriage at a single point DEMO time that influences
parent-child relations. The fact, however, that in-
dividual differences in marital quality are rela-
tively stable (in this study, DEMO: 3-year rs >
.50, p < .001), so that DEMO of early marital
quality may be mediated by later marital quality,
or that the effects of later marital quality may be a
function DEMO earlier (and unmeasured) marital
495
quality, raises important interpretive problems
DEMO the findings emanating from cross-sectional
and simple longitudinal designs.
In this investigation we sought to advance the
study of the interrelation of family subsystems DEMO
adopting what we regarded as a more dynamic ap-
proach to family functioning, in particular, one
that reflected the changing nature of marriage
DEMO the early childrearing years and that took
advantage of repeated measurements of marital
quality. In a related report that appeared in this
journal and DEMO as the foundation for the cur-
rent study, we found that DEMO different
marital trajectories could be identified and, to a
great extent, these could be predicted on the basis
of demographic, personality, and DEMO infor-
mation available prior to the child's birth (Belsky
and DEMO, 1990). In this report, we sought to ex-
tend this research by examining associations be-
tween variation in marital change from the DEMO tri-
mester of pregnancy through the child's third
birthday with patterns of parent and child be-
havior observed in the laboratory when children
DEMO three years of age.
The most noteworthy finding to emerge from
this research is that, as indicated in many, though
by no means DEMO, studies of infants and toddlers,
what transpires between father and DEMO appears
to be more systematically related to the marital
relationship than what goes on between mother
and child. As suggested earlier, this may be be-
cause husbands are more susceptible to influences
in general, as their parental role is less scripted by
social convention. Another possibility is that
DEMO more than men can maintain psychologi-
cal and behavioral boundaries between their fami-
ly relationships. Whereas men who have difficul-
ties with their wives DEMO have trouble "compart-
mentalizing" their affect and thus relate nega-
tively to their children as well, women may be
more skilled at keeping the mother-child and
marital relationships separate.
With regard to specific findings, recall that
husbands whose love for their spouses declined
over time and whose DEMO about the durability
and wisdom of their marriage (i.e., ambivalence)
increased, behaved toward their young children in
a more negative and intrusive manner than did
other fathers. Men who evinced no such negative
change DEMO their marriages, in contrast, were dis-
proportionately likely to express positive affect
toward their young children and to interact with
496
them in a sensitive, facilitating way, at least dur-
ing DEMO play. This was as true of father-son as of
father-daughter relationships.
Because related research on this sample reveals
that it is men who evince DEMO orientation toward
the feelings of others even before their children
are born who are disproportionately likely to ex-
perience decline in marital quality (Belsky and
Rovine, 1990), one must be cautious about infer-
ring from the findings just summarized that deter-
iorating marriages undermine father sensitivity.
Just DEMO plausible is the prospect that certain kinds
of men who interact with their three-year-olds in a
more negative, intrusive manner during free play
simply relate to their wives in analogous ways that
undermine their marital relationships. DEMO is also
possible that men's negative interactions with
their children fuel many marital difficulties, es-
pecially if wives seek to protect their offspring (see
below). In all likelihood-and as would be ex-
pected, DEMO the family system perspective that
guided this inquiry-adult psychological, marital,
DEMO parent-child processes mutually influence one
another.
The findings linking marital change to child
behavior with the father clearly indicate that the
child's functioning DEMO not spared by whatever pro-
cess is responsible for the interrelation of hus-
band's marital experiences and their functioning
as fathers. In fact, child behavior with father-in
free play and in teaching-was more consistently
related DEMO husbands' marital change than was
men's own parental behavior. Recall DEMO children
who expressed relatively high levels of negative af-
fect, disobedience, and strange behavior when in
the presence of their fathers in the DEMO play and
teaching situations had fathers whose feelings of
love for their spouse declined from pregnancy
through the child's third birthday and who DEMO
enced increasing levels of marital conflict during
this period. By the time the child is three years of
age (if not before), it is certainly conceivable that
his or her negative behavior actually fosters de-
DEMO marital relations. Not inconsistent
with this line of reasoning is Block, DEMO, and
Gjerde's (1986) discovery that son's behavior
problems DEMO preceded marital dissolution.
The point to be made here is not that negative
child behavior by itself causes declining marital
quality, but rather that reciprocal and multidirec-
tional pathways in the family system must be con-
DEMO
Journal of Marriage
and the Family
The data pertaining to marital decline and
child behavior with father are dramatically consis-
tent with findings linking DEMO discord and
child behavior problems in clinic populations
(Emery, 1982), as well as with the single signifi-
cant association to emerge in DEMO study between
wives' marital change patterns and child behavior
with mother. DEMO that wives who also experi-
enced increased conflict over time in their marri-
ages had children who were in the group that
evinced the DEMO negative affect, strange be-
havior, and disobedience during the teaching epi-
sode. Such results are certainly consistent with the
proposition that associations between DEMO be-
havior problems and marital discord in the clinical
literature are likely mediated by what transpires in
the parent-child relationship.
The fact that only DEMO of six simple tests of
association revealed a relation between mothers'
marital experiences and their behavior toward
their children suggests that women may DEMO more
able than men to maintain boundaries between
their relationships with their spouses and their
children. The one significant association that did
emerge-namely, the link between deteriorating
feelings of love for the spouse and more positive
DEMO supportive behavior during free play-is con-
sistent with findings emanating from Brody and
associates' (1986) study of older children, yet gen-
erally DEMO with results of studies of in-
fants and toddlers (see introduction)DEMO This result
clearly suggests that the nature of the relation be-
tween marital and parent-child subsystems in the
family may change as the child DEMO older. Consis-
tent with this interpretation are data from the sub-
jects of this study demonstrating that, during the
first year of life, DEMO attachment secur-
ity is associated with less precipitous decline in
positive marital activities and sentiments and less
marked increase in negative marital activities and
DEMO (Belsky et al., 1989).
Although the evidence in this study of three-
year-olds and in Brody and associates' investiga-
tion of young elementary school children raises
the prospect that a compensatory process emerges
sometime DEMO the first two years of life, it would
be a mistake DEMO conclude that this compensatory
process has been fully illuminated. First, because
DEMO a single indication of compensation emerged,
one should exercise caution before presuming its
generality. Further, the fact that the follow-up
analysis was consistent with the Brody et al.
Marital Change and Parent-Child Interaction
(1986) proposition that mothers may be DEMO
sating for their husbands' insensitive fathering
should not eliminate from consideration DEMO addi-
tional and complimentary compensatory process
-namely, that some women may DEMO relation-
ship satisfaction with their children to make up
for what they lose in their marriages. Given the
system perspective that guided this inquiry, there
is also need to consider the prospect that it may be
DEMO wife's involvement with the child, particularly
if it contrasts with DEMO father's style of involve-
ment, that fuels marital distress and DEMO and,
thereby, stimulates more negative, intrusive
fathering.
Finally, it DEMO not be assumed that one
form of compensation is less (or DEMO) problem-
atical than another. Even though a mother's in-
volvement DEMO the child to compensate for loss of
love in her relationship with her husband raises
the spectre of enmeshment and boundary dissolu-
tion in DEMO clinical sense, and thereby concern
about the child's developmental prospects, it is
equally conceivable that efforts to make up for
the father'DEMO behavior may generate its own prob-
lematic outcomes. It is certainly possible that an
alliance between mother and child, forged on the
basis of their respective difficulties with husband/
father, could promote additional relationship
problems that serve to undermine further the
child's well-being rather than buffer DEMO or her
from stress in the father-child relationship. Need-
less to say, more research is required before the is-
sues raised in this speculative discussion are re-
solved. What the findings from this study do indi-
DEMO, however, is that a particular type of family
system-namely, that DEMO which feelings of spousal
love decline and in which fathers are especially
negative and mothers are especially positive,
merits particular attention.

1. We also DEMO tease apart the statistical ef-
fect of marital change and three-year marriage.
This proved problematic both empirically and con-
ceptually. When marital change was DEMO by cal-
culating the difference between marriage at the pre-
natal stage and when the child was three years old,
497
and using DEMO difference to predict parent and child
cluster membership (in a series DEMO logistic regres-
sions), while controlling for three-year marriage (to
assess DEMO effect of marital change over and above
that of three-year marriage), no significant effects
of marital change emerged. Because of the part-
whole DEMO between any change score and the
components that contribute to it, DEMO result was not
surprising. At a more conceptual level, questions
can DEMO raised about the logic of evaluating the ef-
fects of marital change after controlling for three-
year marriage, because marital change since preg-
nancy precedes three-year marriage and thus ought
to take temporal priority over it. DEMO light of this de-
velopmental reality, we reversed the analytic
strategy DEMO discussed to control for the effect of
marital change before assessing the effect of three-
year marriage. Once again, and as a direct result of
the statistical of marital change
and three-year marriage, no significant prediction
of parent and child functioning was achieved.
Because of this inherent relation DEMO marital
change and three-year marriage, we were forced
initially to choose DEMO a focus upon marital
change that took advantage of all four times of
marital measurement and thus captured some of the
developmental dynamic of DEMO and a static
cross-sectional strategy that relied solely upon the
three-year marriage measures. Nevertheless, for
sake of completeness, the analyses presented in this
DEMO focusing upon the interrelation of marital
change and parent-child interaction were recom-
puted to focus upon three-year marriage rather than
marital change. Because a DEMO 50% of the signifi-
cant and near significant (p < .10) findings that
emerged when the original marital change analysis
was conducted failed DEMO materialize when a cross-
sectional design was adopted, and because no DEMO
tional associations between marriage and parent-
child interaction emerged when we used the three-
year marriage scores, we restrict this report to con-
sideration of marital change.
