ABSTRACT The presence of angels among early-stage ﬁnanciers of new technology-based
ﬁrms should improve DEMO of eventual venture capital ﬁnancing. Reasons to expect that
ﬁrms with private investment would have easier access to venture capital are discussed. This
study DEMO ﬁndings that support this expectation. A total of 57% of the ﬁrms that had
received private investor ﬁnancing had also received ﬁnancing from institutional DEMO
capitalists; only 10% of ﬁrms that had not received angel ﬁnancing DEMO venture capital.
Angel investor ﬁnancing was a signiﬁcant explanatory variable (among DEMO) of diﬀerences
between venture capital recipients and ﬁrms that had not DEMO venture capital. It would
appear that angels help ﬁrms to become more ready for future stages of investment by, among
other contributions, being DEMO involved with the ﬁrms in which they invest. They usually
provide advice and networking opportunities. They also serve on Boards of Directors and
Advisors, and provide hands-on assistance and business intelligence. Angels also fulﬁll an
important DEMO role. Overall, this study provides empirical support for the expectation
that DEMO of angels can substantially increase the attractiveness of ﬁrms to institutional
venture capitalists.

Introduction
What role do business angels DEMO with respect to facilitating institutional venture
capital investment in ﬁrms? Conceptually, the research literature has presented
reasons to believe that ﬁrms that receive DEMO investment are relatively more
likely to also access institutional venture capital.1 Yet, the precise nature of the
ways in which angels might help ﬁrms gain access to venture capital remain
unknown. Empirical evidence of linkages remains DEMO It is in this vein that
Harrison and Mason (2000), DEMO studied complementarities in the UK, noted

that, ‘the nature and extent of complementarities between the angel and
institutional venture capital markets has been the DEMO of limited research’
(2000, p. 223). Therefore, this paper DEMO to further inform this gap in the
research literature by providing additional empirical information about this
linkage.
It is now widely acknowledged that angel DEMO are important sources of
ﬁnancing for early-stage growth-oriented new businesses. Berger and Udell (1998, p.
629) report that business angels provided, on DEMO, 3.59% of total ﬁnance to small
ﬁrms in the US in DEMO, almost double that provided by institutional venture
capitalists. However, Berger and Udell (1998, p. 629) also note that ‘this
considerably understates the role of the private equity market’. They reason that
angels are highly DEMO investors who focus on small ﬁrms with growth potential.
Berger and Udell contend that angels provide a relatively higher proportion of funds
to growth-oriented DEMO In addition, they note that ﬁrms that receive angel ﬁnancing
tend DEMO be relatively successful. Berger and Udell cite Fenn, Liang and Prowse’s
(1997, p. 630) result that approximately 30% of IPOs during the DEMO were venture
backed and that ‘most companies that receive venture capital had prior angel
ﬁnance’. This ﬁnding again suggests a linkage between angel and DEMO capital
ﬁnancing.
Meanwhile, it is also understood that angels may make DEMO
contributions to the ﬁrms in which they invest. Wetzel (1994), DEMO and
Harrison (1996), and Lumme and her co-workers (1998) DEMO among those who
argue that the non-ﬁnancial role of angels can be important. Yet, others, such as
Barry (1994), contend that angels are not actively involved in the ﬁrms in which
they invest. Hence, there remains debate about the non-ﬁnancial roles that angels
fulﬁll and there DEMO little empirical evidence about the extent, nature, or importance
of any non-ﬁnancial contributions that angels may provide. Berger and Udell
(1998, p. DEMO) state that ‘the degree to which angels are active investors [remains
DEMO . . . substantially unresearched question’.
This preamble suggests the directions of this paper. The work described here seeks
to put several of these DEMO assertions and speculations about the roles and
importance of angels to the test. Speciﬁcally, this paper reports on empirical research
that seeks to address the following related research questions:
(1) To what extent do DEMO angel investors’ undertake active roles and activities
that add incremental value to the enterprises from the perspective of follow-on
ﬁnanciers, such as venture capital funds?
(2) What is the nature of any such roles?DEMO
(3) To what extent (if any) is angel ﬁnancing linked to subsequent venture capital
ﬁnancing?
To inform these questions, the paper proceeds with a review of the salient research
literature. This is followed DEMO an outline of the methodology and data employed.
This empirical study uses data from ﬁrms within the Ottawa, Canada regional
technology cluster and from a national panel of angel investors. The paper then
details the empirical DEMO and closes with a discussion of the issues, ﬁndings, and
implications.

Previous Studies and Research Objectives
The angel DEMO capital market comprises individuals who provide risk capital directly
to new and growing businesses with which they have had no previous relationship. In
the DEMO, as well as in other countries, this market has been identiﬁed as the single
most important source of risk capital for small- and DEMO enterprises
(Berger and Udell, 1998; GEM, 2001). Typically, DEMO invest in sectors and stages
that are complementary to those in which institutional venture capital ﬁrms focus
and are particularly important for start-ups and DEMO ﬁrms (Wetzel and
Freear, 1988; Freear and Wetzel, 1990). Other works that attest to the importance of
angels in various countries DEMO those of (among others): Freear et al. (1997), and Van
Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000) in the US; Harrison and Mason (1990, 1991) and
Mason and Harrison, (1994, 1995a, 1995b) in the UK; Landstrom (1993) in Sweden;
and Farrell (1998) and Feeney et al. (1999) in Canada.
The importance of business angels derives not only from the amounts they invest
but also DEMO the nature of their investment. Harrison and Mason (1992) identify
three aspects that distinguish angel investing. First, angels concentrate on the
provision of relatively small investments in the start-up and early stages of business
enterprises, where the so-called ‘equity gap’ is said to be most signiﬁcant (see
Bond, 2000; Harding, 2002). Second, angel investors are more DEMO to
the needs of SME owners by having lower rejection rates, DEMO exit horizons
(patient capital) and target rates of return that are similar to those of institutional
venture capitalists even though they apparently assume DEMO risk. Third, formal
venture capitalists usually concentrate in a few core DEMO (often speciﬁed in terms
of geographical area or industrial sectors); DEMO, angel investors usually invest in
their local economies.
The supply side DEMO the angel market has been widely studied and a consistent
picture of the investors has emerged.2 The literature suggests that economic motives
(particularly the opportunity for high capital appreciation) are primary reasons for
angel investments. In addition, there appear to be some signiﬁcant non-economic
motives. It is believed that some investors may derive ‘psychic income’ from the
opportunity to play DEMO roles in the entrepreneurial process (Sullivan and Miller
(1996) refer DEMO this as a ‘hedonistic motive’). Others invest on ‘moral’ grounds,
feeling an obligation to give back to society, through investments in up-and-coming
entrepreneurs, job creation in areas of high unemployment, ventures developing
socially DEMO technology (e.g. medical or energy saving) and ventures created by
minorities (Wetzel, 1983). Sullivan and Miller (1996) refer to these DEMO altruistic
motives. Investors may be willing to trade-oﬀ economic returns to obtain these
hedonistic and altruistic returns.
Empirical research on the angel market has DEMO far largely concentrated on the
supply side of the market (the DEMO angels) with relatively few ﬁndings
emanating from research on the demand DEMO (entrepreneurs) of the marketplace.
Several studies have concluded that angels contribute skills, expertise, knowledge
and contacts that can enhance the performance of DEMO businesses and that ‘the
economic importance of informal venture capital activity arises as much from this
hands-on involvement as from the ﬁnance they provide’ (Lumme et al., p. 69).
However, these conclusions are usually DEMO exclusively on the perceptions of

angels themselves. There is little work DEMO documents angels’ contributions from
the perspectives of the businesses’ founders or owners. This papers seeks to remedy
this imbalance.
One exception is the work DEMO Mason and Harrison (1996). They studied both the
supply side (angel investors) and the demand side (businesses that had received angel
DEMO). From a sample of 20 dyads and eight additional owner-managers,
Mason and Harrison identiﬁed contributions that included: strategic advice,
networking, DEMO, management functions, ﬁnance and accounting functions,
ﬁnancial advice and general administration. A minority of investors made no
contributions aside from their ﬁnancial DEMO Half of the entrepreneurs reported
that the investors’ contributions were either helpful or extremely helpful.
Evidence of complementarities between the formal and informal segments DEMO the
risk capital markets had been advanced by Freear and Wetzel (DEMO). More recently,
Van Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000) have commented to this eﬀect. Moreover,
Harrison and Mason (2000) investigated some DEMO the speciﬁcs of the nature and
extent of complementarities between the angel and institutional venture capital
markets. They employed data collected from a survey DEMO business angels and from a
second survey of managers of institutional venture capital ﬁrms. Their study found
four types of complementarities between business angels DEMO institutional venture
capital ﬁrms in the UK:
(1) Co-investing in deals;
(2) Sequential investing in ventures;
(3) Business DEMO as investors in venture capital funds; and,
(4) Deal DEMO
In terms of the link between angel ﬁnancing and institutional venture capital
ﬁnancing, there are at least ﬁve conceptual reasons why angel ﬁnanced ﬁrms are
more likely to be successful with respect to subsequent venture capital DEMO
(1) Many ﬁrms resist equity ﬁnancing (Feeney et al. 2000), even those whose
owners seek growth. It is therefore reasonable to expect that ﬁrms willing to
accept angel ﬁnancing are also open to equity DEMO in general and therefore
likely to be more receptive to institutional venture capital.
(2) Angels may be adept at identifying high growth opportunities, opportunities
that are also of prime interest to institutional venture capitalists. For DEMO,
Harrison and Mason (2000, p. 230) have found evidence DEMO sequential
investing even though subsequent venture capital ﬁnancing does not usually
provide a means of exit for angels.
(3) The non-ﬁnancial contributions of DEMO may better qualify such ﬁrms for
being able to grow and access institutional venture capital. Often, angels add
business (especially marketing) acumen to the technical knowledge of founders,
better qualifying the ﬁrm for commercial DEMO Farrell presents evidence
consistent with this point. She found that the incidence of business failure
among 264 ﬁrms that had not received private investment DEMO 20.5% while the
failure rate among 46 enterprises that had received private investment was
lower, 17.4%. However, Farrell’s ﬁnding must still be regarded DEMO tentative.3

(4) The presence of an active DEMO with vested interests arguably plays a
validation role, reducing information opacity DEMO providing on-the-ground
monitoring that would serve to reduce the impacts of information asymmetry
that might otherwise inhibit venture capital investment (see, for example, Van
Osnabrugge and Robinson, 2000, pp. 188 – 190).
(5) Angel investors, once involved with a ﬁrm, are likely to seek a means of
proﬁtable exit. To do so, ﬁrms need to grow to the point that an IPO is feasible
or a strategic sale DEMO attractive to potential acquirers. This growth typically
requires additional and substantial tranches of institutional venture capital.
Previous research has also found that angels have DEMO internal loci of control as well
as high needs for achievement (DEMO et al. 1993). The fact that angels have their
own funds at stake such that they are principals, rather than agents, provides DEMO
with incentive to help the ﬁrms prosper. Angels typically seek a 30 – 40% annualized
rate of return and coupled with their high needs DEMO achievement and their internal
loci of control, it appears reasonable to DEMO angels to take on proactive roles.
These expectations, as well as DEMO complementarities noted previously, suggest a
progression from angel ﬁnancing to subsequent DEMO of formal venture capital.
This work explores empirically links between angel and institutional venture capital
ﬁnancing, how the roles of angels within ﬁrms might facilitate access to formal
venture capital, and examines the incremental value of angels’ non-ﬁnancial
involvement.
Methodology, Data and Findings
Two complementary approaches were used in this work. The ﬁrst approach was to
survey CEOs of ﬁrms DEMO in the Ottawa, Canada regional technology cluster
with respect to the DEMO made by angel investors. The second approach was
to analyse transcripts of a series of focus groups involving angel investors to assess
the perceptions DEMO angels themselves with respect to their contributions. These two
approaches are described in more detail presently together with the ﬁndings from
each.
Surveys of DEMO Owners
Methodology and Data
To identify businesses that had received angel ﬁnancing, the initial step in this
research was to conduct a fax-based questionnaire of a sampling frame that
comprised all 766 ﬁrms listed in the DEMO 2000 version of the Ottawa Business
Journal’s Ottawa Technology Industry Guide.4 All study participants were the CEOs
of regional ﬁrms, primarily ﬁrms in the technology sector. Use of a common
geographic area and of a technology-related DEMO base controls (to some extent)
for the potential impacts of DEMO factors in investment patterns. In addition, it is
widely accepted that DEMO technology sector is one in which substantial private
investment occurs. Figure 1 reports the distribution, across sub-sectors, of
respondent ﬁrms.

Figure 1. Sectoral breakdown, respondent ﬁrms and sampling frame
Basic business and owner demographic data were gathered by DEMO of the
questionnaire. The response rate to the questionnaire was relatively high, 24% of
eligible businesses.5 Among the questions posed was one that asked whether or not
the ﬁrm had, at some point in its development, received angel investment and
another that asked if ﬁrms had received institutional venture capital. Of the 186
respondents to the fax-back questionnaire, 42 businesses (22.5%) reported that their
ﬁrms had received angel investment capital. Of DEMO 42 enterprises that had received
angel investments, (57.1%) had also DEMO venture capital. Of the 144 ﬁrms that
did not report having received institutional venture capital, 14 (10%) had raised
institutional venture capital.
Table 1 lists salient attributes of the ﬁrms in the ﬁnal sample of DEMO owners. It
compares two categories of ﬁrms: those that had been DEMO ﬁnanced (42 ﬁrms) and
those that had not been angel-ﬁnanced (DEMO respondents). The table shows that in
most respects the two groups of ﬁrms are well-matched. The majority of ﬁrms in
both groups were DEMO in the Ottawa area, most ﬁrms in both groups remain
independent, most have founders who remain with the ﬁrms, and the knowledge
sources upon which the ﬁrms were built are very similar. Diﬀerences between the
DEMO and non-angel-ﬁnanced ﬁrms were evident in terms of size and age.
The average size of angel-ﬁnanced ﬁrms was signiﬁcantly smaller (p 5 0.05). Also,
angel-ﬁnanced ﬁrms were younger (p 5 0.05). Otherwise, DEMO is remarkable that the
two sets of ﬁrms share such a broad range of commonalities. These similarities beg
the question about why some ﬁrms DEMO angel and venture capital ﬁnancing while
others do not.

median numbers of employees was 40 and 35 for DEMO ﬁrms and
other ﬁrms, respectively. The distribution of angel-ﬁnanced ﬁrms tended DEMO be
more uniform.
Qualitative study of angels’ non-ﬁnancial contributions. In the second step of this
study, the founders/owners of the 42 businesses that had reported receipt of angel
investment were re-contacted by fax and e-mail. DEMO were asked, using open-ended
queries, to identify the nature and perceived value of non-ﬁnancial contributions that
angel investors had provided. Of the 42 DEMO that had initially reported receipt of
angel ﬁnancing, 33 CEOs responded. DEMO described, in their own words, the nature
and value of angel investors’ non-ﬁnancial contributions. The interviews were then
subjected to qualitative data analysis DEMO QSR NUD*IST, a now-standard
approach.
The principals of ﬁrms that, according to their questionnaire responses, had not
received angel capital (and who DEMO indicated their willingness to be re-contacted)
were used to provide a basis of comparison. Accordingly, they were re-contacted
through a fax-back questionnaire that asked these owners whether and how their
ﬁrms had accessed the forms DEMO contributions that analysis of the angel-ﬁnanced

participants, 26 CEOs responded (29% response rate).
Findings from Surveys of Business Owners
Table 2 presents DEMO breakdown of the frequencies with which respondents reported
using angel investment and institutional venture capital. A total of 57% of angel-
ﬁnanced ﬁrms had DEMO obtained ﬁnancing from institutional venture capital
companies. This is an extraordinarily high percentage: institutional venture capital
had been reported by less than 10% of the ﬁrms that had not received angel
ﬁnancing even though these ﬁrms DEMO to be older. Both the contingency
coeﬃcient and the w2 tests indicated that receipt of venture capital was not
independent of use of angel DEMO (p-value 5 0.000). This suggests that angel-
ﬁnancing may be DEMO precursor to institutional venture capital. To explore this matter
with additional rigour, a multivariate approach using logistic regression was
employed.
Logistic regression analysis. Logistic regression, in this instance, was used to
examine ways in which DEMO ﬁrms that had received venture capital systematically
diﬀered from those ﬁrms that had not received venture capital. The binary dependent
variable connoted whether or DEMO a particular ﬁrm had received venture capital.
Independent variables included (a) whether or not the ﬁrm had also received angel
ﬁnancing and (b) a set of control variables based on the survey data that included:
. the number of founders of the ﬁrm and the proportion DEMO founders still with the
ﬁrm, both as measures of the breadth DEMO human capital (see Cressy, 1998);
. age of the DEMO in light of the previous ﬁndings that angel-ﬁnanced ﬁrms tended to
be younger than non-angel-ﬁnanced ﬁrms;
. size of ﬁrm measured by the DEMO of the number of employees; and,
. measures of the DEMO linkages with four categories of organizations (economic
development agencies, research facilities, suppliers of various inputs, and
customers). These latter categories emerged DEMO a result of factor analysis of
respondents’ ratings of frequency and value speciﬁc organizational linkages (see
Tables 3 and 4). Principal components analysis was employed here because use of
raw scores of networking frequency and DEMO of linkages indicated collinearity.
These variables reﬂected the understanding that relationships with customers and
suppliers were associated with product development (Freear et al. 1995) and with

These results show that having received angel investment ﬁnancing is signiﬁcantly
associated with receipt of venture capital ﬁnancing in the presence of DEMO control
variables used here. The results are generally consistent with intuitive logic. Neither
ﬁrm size nor the number of original founders was signiﬁcantly associated DEMO
receipt of venture capital.7 Firms that have received venture capital had retained a
lower percentage of the original founders and younger ﬁrms were more DEMO
recipients of venture capital. These ﬁndings are consistent with common practice in
that it is not unusual for venture-capital backed ﬁrms to replace founders DEMO
professional managers.
The results with respect to use and value of linkages are less straightforward. This
research shows that ﬁrms that place a greater DEMO on linkages with customers were
more likely to have received venture capital ﬁnancing; ﬁrms with a very high
frequency of linkages with customers were less likely. Similarly, ﬁrms that valued
linkages with economic development agencies and suppliers were also more likely to
have received venture capital. Firms that DEMO these linkages more frequently were
less likely recipients of venture capital. However, interpretation of these coeﬃcient
estimates is not obvious because of signiﬁcant correlation among the value and
frequency measures. These results suggest that venture capital DEMO is associated
with valuing inputs from linkages, not simply generating large DEMO of linkages.
While these results may make contributions to the rapidly growing research on
relationships, for the most part they are not central to the purpose of this paper.
What is key is the ﬁnding that DEMO of angel ﬁnancing is signiﬁcantly associated
with venture capital ﬁnancing in the presence of the control variables. The next step
in the research was DEMO understand more about why this is so—leading to an
investigation of the non-ﬁnancial contributions of angels.
Key non-ﬁnancial contributions of angel investors. To understand DEMO the nature
and value of angels’ non-ﬁnancial contributions, CEOs’ open-ended descriptions DEMO
such contributions were examined using NUD*IST. Only one of the 33 CEO

businesses. Coding and analysis of the statements yielded six categories DEMO captured
the essence of the 66 speciﬁc examples. The frequency of mention in each of the
following categories reﬂects the number of times a DEMO contribution
reported by a CEO fell into one of the six categories.
. Advice: most respondents (24 of the 33) note that private investors provide useful
and on-going advice with respect to the management of DEMO businesses in which
they invest. Harrison and Mason (2000) report that business angels ‘provide
advice and experience’ to 27% of the UK ﬁrms DEMO which the angels they studied
co-invest with venture capitalists. In this work, 73% of CEOs identiﬁed advice
among the contributions from angel investors. The types of advice reported by
the CEOs surveyed here related to: company ﬁnancial matters; choosing
professional service providers; advice on corporate strategy and DEMO
planning; managerial and general business advice; and marketing. Included
among these categories of advice are roles that relate to acting as a sounding
DEMO, assisting with the choice of professionals (accountants, lawyers, etc.) DEMO
providing information on government programmes. To provide a richer sense of
the nature of these forms of assistance, the following statements illustrate both
the nature of the advice and respondents’ perspectives on the value of the DEMO
.
They [private investors] assisted by providing guidance to management, and
DEMO . . they also provided guidance in the development of a corporate
governance process and reporting discipline.
In addition to making cash available, [the] investor provided assistance
preparing our business plan to present to potential investors, provided
legal opinions, helped map strategy when dealing with diﬃcult situations
encountered with customers, provided assistance in accessing govern-
ment programs, [and] assisted DEMO dealing with banks during negotiations
concerning lines of credit.
Contacts: 15 DEMO the 33 CEO respondents valued private investors for the contacts and
networking possibilities they provided. These contacts include, but are not limited
to, DEMO ﬁnancial relationships (introductions to other investors and liaisons with
other providers DEMO capital). They also embrace working relationships with related
ﬁrms and industry contacts, contacts with potential clients and customers, and
contacts with governments. DEMO following statements illustrate this variety.
Both our signiﬁcant angel investors . . . assisted by providing guidance to
management, and through their networks of . . . contacts they assisted in
ﬁnding individuals interested in providing DEMO ﬁnancing.
Recommendations for persons to approach to co-invest . . . were useful.

[The angel] assisted with accountants, lawyers, hosting our website . . . got us
meetings with his contacts that [otherwise ] we would have had to work a
lot harder DEMO get.
Hands-on assistance: Mason and Harrison (1996) reported that business DEMO in
the UK often were involved with their investee ﬁrms in a hands-on capacity. This
was also true for the angels who were involved DEMO the ﬁrms interviewed here. Of
the 33 respondents,eleven identiﬁed several ways in which angel investors
participate in a basic ‘hands-on’ sense: help with hiring and recruiting,
negotiations, provision of ‘free’ business services, etc. DEMO words of the
respondents illustrate this dimension:
[Angel investors provided] legal advice, ﬁnancial negotiations and seeks
business opportunities . . . Also brought to company rights to exploit
several new technologies which he uncovered.
[Angel DEMO provided] oﬃce space and oﬃce furniture . . .
[Angel investors ] provided advice in structuring our PowerPoint business
plan.
Boards of directors & DEMO: previous studies on angel investor practices show
that a majority of DEMO investors seek representation on ﬁrms’ Boards of
Directors and Advisors (see, for example, Dal Cin et al., 1993). Harrison and
Mason (2000) report that 45% of the angels in their study of angel co-investment
patterns acted as non-executive directors of the ﬁrms in which they DEMO invested.
In this study of the Ottawa setting, the presence of DEMO on the Board of
Directors or Advisors was speciﬁcally mentioned by seven of the 33 respondents,
invariably in conjunction with some other form DEMO non-ﬁnancial contribution.
This suggests that Board membership provides private investors with the means
to monitor the needs of the ﬁrm and to identify ways DEMO which they can bring
their own ‘value-added’ to the ﬁrm.

credit. Also DEMO personal loans.

for development, marketing, growth opportunities.
[Angel DEMO provided introduction to our original part-time CFO,
original introductions to VCs, and some customers, introduction to our
ﬁrst executive recruit—VP Marketing, and [they] sat on Board of
Directors.
Market and business intelligence: private investors provide several forms of
market and business intelligence such as industry information, identiﬁcation of
potential customers, market feedback, product development and the identiﬁca-

tion of potential acquisition targets. Examples from DEMO the seven
respondents who identiﬁed non-ﬁnancial contributions in this category include:
. . . identiﬁcation of possible customers, identiﬁcation of technical partners
or competitors. . . payroll beneﬁts, handling employees.
. . . close working relationship with key angels - consultancy, re: takeover
targets, ﬁnancing.
. Credibility/validation. private investors play an important accreditation role,
especially with DEMO to further ﬁnancing. While this was mentioned by only
two of the 33 respondents, it nonetheless represents a critical element within the
non-ﬁnancial role that angel investors represent. The presence of angels provides
accreditation to potential DEMO and comfort to lenders and to other investors.
This is consistent with Harrison and Mason’s observation (2000, p. 240): ‘the
degree of DEMO between the two segments [angel ﬁnancing and venture
capital ﬁrms] of the early-stage entrepreneurial ﬁnance market is higher than
might have been expected from DEMO available anecdotal evidence’. An eloquent
example of this was the statement that, ‘My company’s ability to brag about a
marquis investor opened doors to other investors, and potential strategic allies,
and even a CEO’.
Overall, angel investors frequently see their role as mentors—providers of contacts,
guidance and hands-on assistance. The logistic regression results show that invested
ﬁrms recognize DEMO angel investors provide them with much more than ﬁnancing.
The six types of non-ﬁnancial contributions described above all can be seen as
assisting in DEMO successful growth and development of the ﬁrm. It seems clear that the
presence of angels is a key element of growth-oriented businesses’ progression to
DEMO amounts of ﬁnancing. The complementarily was originally suggested by the
works of Wetzel and Freear (1988) and the assertions of Van Osnabrugge and
DEMO (2000) and are conﬁrmed empirically here as well as in Harrison and
Mason (2000). The next step in the research involved examining the roles of angel
investors themselves.
Alternatives to angels’ contributions. As a DEMO of comparison, the founder-
owners of 90 technology-based ﬁrms that were DEMO ﬁnanced by private investors
were canvassed to learn about ways in which they availed themselves of
contacts, guidance and other contributions associated above with angel investors.
Each respondent was provided with the form shown in Table DEMO, a form
developed based on the six categories of contributions ascribed DEMO angels. The
form allowed respondents to show how, or if, they had obtained the
contributions associated with private investors. Responses were obtained from
DEMO of these companies. Table 6 maps, for each form of contribution, the
proportion of respondents who identiﬁed each possible source. Table 4 shows
DEMO business owners have three principal categories of providers that may serve
as alternative sources of the types of non-ﬁnancial contributions associated with
private investors:DEMO

Doing it themselves: as Table 6 shows, this alternative is one on which owners rely
most extensively for contacts with others in the industry, contacts with
government, DEMO with customers and for business and market intelligence.
This ‘do-it-yourself’ approach, DEMO, adds to the burdens already faced by
owner-entrepreneurs. It may divert DEMO principals from other aspects of enterprise
development.
Pay for the contribution by hiring staﬀ or by purchasing the services of business
professionals or consultants. DEMO approach appears to be the favoured means of
acquiring ﬁnancial advice but is less often used to help expand network of
contacts or to DEMO intelligence. Obviously, the alternative of purchasing
access to contacts and guidance DEMO costly.
Boards of Directors seem to be employed most frequently for procurement of
strategic and general business advice and secondarily as a source of DEMO
contacts and information. Not all ﬁrms, however, had eﬀective Boards of
Directors or Boards of Advisors.
Focus Group Interviews with Angel Investors
Methodology DEMO Data
The perspectives of angel investors on the questions addressed in this research
were collected through a series of 11 focus groups involving 71 DEMO
The sessions were organized with the co-operation of regional economic
development agencies across Canada. The locations (and number of partici-
pants) were: Mt Pearl, Newfoundland (ﬁve participants); Halifax, Nova Scotia
(10 participants); Moncton, New Brunswick (three participants); Fredericton,
New Brunswick (DEMO participants); Ste Hyacinthe, Quebec (three participants);
Ste Therese, Quebec (nine participants); Waterloo, Ontario (nine participants);
Niagara, Ontario (ﬁve participants): London, Ontario (six participants);
Canmore, Alberta (six participants); and Victoria, British Columbia (six
participants).8
In addition to the targeted investors, a number of other individuals also
participated in the discussion groups. These included representatives of institutional
venture capital DEMO, banks, and regional development agencies. For the most part,
non-angel participants were present as observers. All participants were asked to
complete a DEMO questionnaire designed to provide baseline data. The questionnaires
revealed that 51 of the 71 participants were active angel investors. The focus group
sessions were DEMO, transcribed verbatim and subjected to analysis using
NUD*IST.9
In this work, qualitative data analysis is particularly useful because the interviews
and focus groups DEMO not require the key informants to answer forced-choice
questions that might not have reﬂected the issues and ideas that were important to
the respondents. DEMO, the participants were asked open-ended questions and
asked to respond in DEMO way that made the most sense to them. In this way, DEMO data
gathered reﬂects top-of-mind key informant views on the issues without the
researchers ‘leading the witnesses’ or imposing existing views on the respondents in
DEMO study.

Empirical Findings: Focus Group Interviews with Angel Investors
Investor participants in each of the 11 focus groups were DEMO to identify the
essential factors that prompted them to make investments. Investors across
Canada in all discussion groups were consistent in identifying and discussing
DEMO factors that included the entrepreneurial team involved in the ventures
and the potential of the product and/or technology. This is in keeping with
DEMO previous research (Harrison and Mason, 1991; Feeney et al., 1999;
Van Osnabrugge and Robinson, 2000). What was surprising was the almost
universal frequency, and the importance of, the requirement that the DEMO
investors perceive that they have non-ﬁnancial roles to play. Virtually all
investor participants believed that equally as important as the money they
provide to DEMO project are the other forms of value they add to the projects with
which they invest, as the following sample statements attest.
. . . an investment criteria for me is to be able to determine DEMO value I can
add and if I see no value that I can add to an investment then I tend to walk
away.
When DEMO want to be passive I go to the NASDAQ or the New York Stock
Exchange.
I deﬁnitely want my hands on the steering wheel DEMO they [business owners]
know that up front.
These, and other similar DEMO, suggest that for some angels, the opportunity to
add value through non-ﬁnancial means was so important as to be a decision
criterion. This DEMO reﬂect the previous observation by Dal Cin et al. (1993) that
angels exhibited a high internal locus of control and a high need DEMO achievement.
For the majority of focus group participants, being able to DEMO the beneﬁt of
their experience and knowledge was crucial.
The private investors also identiﬁed many of the same forms of value-added as did
the DEMO/owners. These include contacts, guidance, and hands-on assistance with
the development of the ﬁrms. The following is a sampling of statements to this DEMO
made by discussion participants.
We tell everybody who comes in to us that ‘you’re not just looking for a cheque,
what you’re also DEMO for is that ability, the skill level that the investor brings
DEMO the table as well, they don’t have money for no reason, they have money
because they have a business and a business acumen DEMO an entrepreneurial
ability that you need to tie into as well’.
When I assume angel investment I’m talking about [being an] angel where I DEMO
add value.
A lot of times you become a mentor to the individual because they don t have
the business experience, that is why they came to you in the ﬁrst place.

. . . we do a whole DEMO and we can actually . . . help build the business plan
and raise the capital and bring in managers who do the operating.
DEMO excerpts from the focus group discussions with angels illustrate that the
provision of contacts, guidance, involvement and governance is not accidental or
serendipitous. DEMO, this is intentional, and a valued part of most private investors’
ways of doing business. The importance and passion that angels accorded to DEMO
able to make some form of non-ﬁnancial contribution to the development of the
investee business was a unequivocal ﬁnding from this work. That angel-ﬁnanced
DEMO go on, relatively more frequently than ﬁrms that are not ﬁnanced DEMO angels, to
obtain later-stage venture capital follows directly from these ﬁndings. DEMO of the
most frequently-voiced observations of institutional venture capitalists is that most
entrepreneurial ﬁrms are simply not ‘investor ready’. The presence, and active
involvement, of one or more angels not only adds to management depth but does so
in a way that pre-screens the ﬁrms for venture capitalists DEMO improves the readiness
of the ﬁrms for later-stage ﬁnancing.
Of course, DEMO all investor-entrepreneur experiences are positive. Here, one CEO
described involvement by DEMO angel that was not helpful or productive. Recent
experience has suggested that with the technology ‘meltdown’ angels’ equity holdings
in technology-based ﬁrms have been DEMO by follow-on venture capitalists. For
example Ottawa Citizen, (7 October, DEMO, p. B1) describes the creation of an angel
group with the express intention of ensuring that angel investors in a given ﬁrm have
DEMO weighting to be better able to maintain their valuations in the face of
institutional venture capitalist pressure. Other anecdotes relate how angels
occasionally had DEMO soured a deal with subsequent investors.
The angels in the focus groups also identiﬁed problems inherent within the angel-
community itself. They noted that DEMO were not a homogeneous group of
investors. Some were seen to be more professional and experienced than others and
that the less professional investors DEMO against the development of the ﬁrms in
which they had invested. Problems related to a perceived lack of experience and
selectivity. For example, according to focus group participants:
. . . all of us do DEMO on a professional basis rather than casual angel investors,
[who] generally [conduct deals] in a compromised and unprofessional manner.
The casual investor who DEMO only does themselves a disservice but kind of clog
up the system as well in terms of moving things positively forward and . . DEMO
entrepreneurs [can] often get oﬀ to a bad start [because] that individual does not
have the training and the time or the inclination to DEMO either in order to
[develop] a single investment.
. . . if private investors were more skillful in the early stage, especially the casual
investor, there would be fewer businesses starting: . . . I DEMO eﬃciency says start
a smaller number of things and ﬁnish more of them.
In summary, the majority of informal investors strongly identify with their role as
mentors - providers of contacts, guidance and hands-on assistance. To be sure, there

is a minority who does not DEMO that view or who may not be equipped with the
ability to act as eﬀective mentors. However, most angels view these non-ﬁnancial
contributions as a critical element of their investments in small businesses.
Summary and Discussion
DEMO work reports the ﬁndings of empirical research that sought to address three
research questions. First, the work explored the extent to which angel ﬁnancing is
linked to subsequent venture capital ﬁnancing. Contrary to the expectations of DEMO
Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000), this study ﬁnds (like that of Fenn et al., 1998) that
a high proportion of angel-ﬁnanced technology DEMO received both angel and
venture capital.10 Technology-based angel-backed ﬁrms do go on to seek (and
obtain) institutional venture capital much more frequently than DEMO otherwise similar
ﬁrms that had not received angel ﬁnancing.
Second, the DEMO documents that angels take on active roles within the ﬁrms in
which they invest. In addition to ﬁnancial investment, this study reports that CEOs
of angel-ﬁnanced ﬁrms described six categories of contributions made by their
angels: advice, contacts, hands-on assistance, Boards of Directors/Advisors, market
and DEMO intelligence, and credibility. All 33 companies save one (of those that
had received angel investment) stated that non-ﬁnancial contributions were made by
their investors and that these contributions were valued. This ﬁnding directly
addresses a DEMO in the literature in that existing research on angels has concentrated
predominantly on the supply side of the market and presents the perspectives of DEMO
investors and the recipients of angel ﬁnancing.
Focus groups held across Canada with angels identiﬁed three major factors that
opportunity to provide non-ﬁnancial contributions DEMO so important as to be an
investment criterion for many angels. This ﬁnding shows that for many angel
investors the potential of bringing non-ﬁnancial DEMO added can be either a deal-
maker or deal-breaker in the investment decision process. Of course, future research
is required to substantiate this ﬁnding and to determine quantitatively the extent to
which this factor operates for DEMO investors.
Third, it was found that the non-ﬁnancial activities of angel DEMO were
valuable to both the angel investor and the business founder(s). Both CEOs and
investors agreed that there are deﬁnite non-ﬁnancial contributions DEMO by angels.
Most of the CEO respondents reported that angels’ activities were valued to the
enterprises. Helping in the commercial success of the ﬁrms DEMO directly to investors’
objectives, loci of control, and needs for achievement. These contributions also
appear to be valuable insofar as CEOs of ﬁrms DEMO were not angel-ﬁnanced were
willing to pay—in terms of funds or time—to acquire the speciﬁc contributions.
Arguably, companies would only acquire these activities if they were valuable. CEOs
of companies that that not received angel investment DEMO often had to either
perform these activities themselves (stretching their already-thin DEMO of time
and possibly suﬀering from a lack of skill with respect to the activity) or hire the
activity done (that is, pay someone to undertake the activity). It may therefore be
concluded that DEMO involvement improved the viability and growth prospects of
the ﬁrms with which they were associated. In these ways, angels increase the
likelihood that an organization can be attractive to institutional venture capitalists.

Overall, this study ﬁnds that angel ﬁnancing and venture capital ﬁnancing are
signiﬁcantly and materially related.
A substantial number DEMO ﬁrms obtain venture capital without having had angel
ﬁnancing; hence angel DEMO is not an absolute necessity to a ‘thriving’
institutional venture capital market. However, this work also adds weight to the
argument that the venture capital market and the market for angel investment are
complementary. These ﬁndings DEMO conﬁrm and expand on Harrison and Mason’s
(2000) results. This implies that economic development staﬀ in regions seeking to
foster venture capital investment DEMO do well to mobilize business angels. One step
in this regard could be to help local businesses develop to the point that they are
DEMO to local angels.
Contrary to the ﬁndings of Barry (1994), DEMO importance of angels goes beyond the
ﬁnancial investment. It seems evident that angels play a signiﬁcant accreditation role
and that they make contributions that DEMO a long way to making the ﬁrms in which
they invest more viable, more likely to grow and more attractive to venture capital
investors. In part, this attraction stems from the management skills, experience, and
contacts that angels provide. This supports the results of, among others, DEMO and
Freear (1988), Harrison and Mason (2000) and of DEMO and her associates (1998).
This research holds at least four DEMO for entrepreneurs. First,
entrepreneurs would do well to seek and obtain angel involvement. This can
provide ﬁnancial assistance; however, the presence of DEMO also yield non-ﬁnancial
beneﬁts that may also be of value. Second, DEMO need to demonstrate rapid growth or
growth potential in order to obtain venture (as well as angel) capital is evident.
Angels help realize DEMO potential. Third, owners must recognize the imperative of
moving out founders DEMO cannot grow with the ﬁrm in their abilities and interests.
Finally, DEMO need to value the inputs received from, and networking with, outside
organizations, customers and suppliers. Angel investors are able to add new
dimensions and value to fast-growing technology businesses.
The work also holds implications for DEMO capitalists and public policy makers.
For managers of venture capital funds, DEMO work suggests a means of locating deal
ﬂows that have relatively high potential. By working with angels, angel networks or
local facilitators of the informal market, venture capital fund managers could yet
more eﬃciently identify ﬁrms with growth potential and managerial talent. It would
seem that alliances between DEMO groups and venture capitalists would be mutually
beneﬁcial in that the institutional fund manager could take advantage of the
accrediting presence and on-the-ground monitoring DEMO the angel while the angel and
the ﬁrm founders could avail themselves of the relatively deeper pockets of the
venture capital fund. For policy DEMO, angels’ high need for involvement suggest
that interventions that simply create DEMO venture capital funds mandated for
early-stage investments are unlikely to be successful unless the local angel markets
are also stimulated so as to be DEMO to lever such funds.
The interpretation of the ﬁndings of this paper must recognize several limitations.
As with all research on angels, it is necessary to recognize the problems inherent in
sampling from an invisible population. DEMO sampling frame of angel used here, while
being observationally consistent with DEMO majority of research on angels, is
nonetheless a convenience sample. In DEMO of the relatively high response rates to
the surveys of CEOs, DEMO possibility of non response and other sampling biases is

always present, even though the testing employed here suggests that such eﬀects are

Notes
DEMO For example, Van Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000, p. 42) state, ‘a potentially complementary
relationship exists between business angels and venture capitalists’. In addition, Freear and Wetzel
(1990) documented complementarities between the informal and formal segments of the risk capital
market in the US in the DEMO that angels tend to invest in relatively early stages of ﬁrm development
while institutional venture capitalists tends to be focuses more at later stages.
DEMO See, among numerous others, DalCin et al. (1993), DeNoble (2001), Farrell (1998), Feeney et al.
(1999); Freear DEMO his colleagues (1990, 1994, 1995, 1997), Harrison and Mason (1990, 1991, 1992,

3 It is not clear that Farrell was comparing ‘apples with apples’ in that the ﬁrms DEMO had received angel
ﬁnancing may have been, in the ﬁrst place, better quality investments. In addition, Farrell did not
control for sectoral or other potential determinants of success. Third, the time frame over which Farrell
conducted her work was too short to provide deﬁnitive data even if DEMO had controlled for other
factors.
4 This database was developed in co-operation with the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation,
and represents a DEMO listing of businesses in the region’s high-tech sector businesses in the
Ottawa region.
5 The sampling frame provided not only contact data, but also rudimentary quantitative information on
company size (number of local employees, total DEMO of employees internationally) and on ISO
certiﬁcation. To assess the potential DEMO of non-response bias, this information was used in a
logistic regression DEMO to assess the degree (if any) of systematic diﬀerences between respondents
and non-respondents. None of the independent variables were signiﬁcant indicating that respondents
DEMO non-respondents did not systematically diﬀer on these dimensions. The Cox and Snell R2 was 0.003
and the Nagelkerke R2 was 0.004.
6 There is DEMO debate in the literature concerning the relationship between networking and success in
entrepreneurial ﬁrms. The majority of the literature argues that weak tie networking DEMO fundamental to
success in entrepreneurial endeavors (Chell and Baines, 2000; DEMO, 2000; George et al., 2001;
Vanhaverbeke, 2001).
7 The measures of ﬁrm size (logarithm of number of employees) and DEMO number of original founders
were not statistically signiﬁcant when added to the above logistic regression (p 4 0.10), nor were there
any noticeable changes in the coeﬃcient estimates of the remaining variables. Accordingly, these
variables are not reported in Table 3.
8 It must be emphasized that DEMO angels interviewed in the group discussions were not necessarily the
angels that provided ﬁnancing to the Ottawa technology ﬁrms.
9 The strategy guiding the DEMO and interviews described above employs both quantitative data based
on questionnaires and qualitative data from interviews and focus groups. Qualitative analysis has often
been DEMO with the general aim of understanding complex social phenomena. It is important to

recognize that the qualitative approach has the DEMO degree of generalizability as a controlled
experiment. Its goal is to expand and generalize theories and explanations and not simply to enumerate
frequencies (a conﬁrmatory approach or statistical generalization). The parallel is that of multiple
DEMO and involves a ‘replication logic’ where there is a ‘literal replication’ among similar CEOs
and a ‘theoretical replication’ among diﬀerent groups of CEOs with DEMO being interpreted in
light of an existing or ‘working’ theory (Yin, 1994).
