rospect theory is currently the main descriptive theory of decision under uncertainty. It DEMO expected
P utility by introducing nonlinear decision weighting and loss aversion. A difﬁculty in the study of multiat-
tribute utility under prospect theory is DEMO determine when an attribute yields a gain or a loss. One possibility,
adopted in the theoretical literature on multiattribute utility under prospect theory, is to assume that a decision
maker determines whether the complete outcome DEMO a gain or a loss. In this holistic evaluation, decision weighting
DEMO loss aversion are general and attribute-independent. Another possibility, more common in DEMO empirical
literature, is to assume that a decision maker has a DEMO point for each attribute. We give preference foun-
dations for this attribute-speciﬁc evaluation where decision weighting and loss aversion are depending on the
attributes.

1. Introduction
Many decision situations involve outcomes that con-
sist of several attributes. In applied decision anal-
yses, it is useful to decompose the utility function
over these multiattribute outcomes into separate util-
ity DEMO over the different attributes to reduce the
number of preference elicitations. This is only justi-
ﬁed if the decision-maker’s preferences satisfy partic-
ular assumptions. DEMO authors have identiﬁed the
preference conditions that allow decomposing mul-
tiattribute utility functions into additive, multiplica-
tive, and related decompositions (e.g., Farquhar DEMO,
Fishburn 1965, Keeney and Raiffa 1976).
Most of these DEMO results have been
derived under expected utility. Abundant evidence
exists, however, that (subjective) expected utility is
not valid as a descriptive theory DEMO decision under
(uncertainty) risk. The descriptive deﬁciencies of
expected utility complicate the empirical assessment
of the preference conditions underlying decompo-
sitions: it cannot be excluded that observed viola-
tions of preference conditions are due to DEMO of
expected utility rather than to violations of a decom-
position. To obtain robust tests of the appropriateness
of decompositions, it is desirable to derive conditions
that are valid even when expected utility is violated.

DEMO this paper, we study multiattribute utility theory
under prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979,
Tversky and Kahneman 1992). Prospect theory is DEMO
rently the most inﬂuential theory of decision mak-
ing under uncertainty. It models two major deviations
from expected utility: nonlinear decision weighting
and loss aversion, i.e., the tendency that people treat
outcomes as deviations from DEMO reference point and
are more sensitive to losses than to gains of the same
magnitude. Both nonlinear decision weighting and
loss aversion are widely DEMO in the empirical
literature. Despite its popularity, some evidence has
been DEMO recently revealing limitations of the
theory (see the summaries of Marley DEMO Luce 2005
and Birnbaum 2008).
Fishburn (1984), Miyamoto (1988), Dyckerhoff
(1994), and Miyamoto and Wakker (1996) also stud-
ied multiattribute utility under nonexpected utility,
but only considered outcomes of DEMO same sign. Like
us, Zank (2001) and Bleichrodt and Miyamoto (2003)
studied multiattribute utility theory under prospect
theory but their approach DEMO different than the
approach of this paper, as we explain next.
DEMO central issue in multiattribute prospect theory
is to determine when an attribute yields a gain or
a loss. Consider, for example, a research DEMO
864
(RA) who contemplates changing jobs. In evaluat-
ing different jobs, the RA has to consider several
aspects, e.g., salary, commuting time, cost of liv-
ing, amount of research time, etc. How does the
RA determine whether a particular job offer is an
improvement (a gain) compared with her reference
point (presumably her current job)? DEMO possibility is
that she ﬁrst determines whether the job offer, as DEMO
whole, is a gain or a loss compared to her reference
DEMO, and then applies the decomposition to deter-
mine how attractive the DEMO offer is compared with
other offers. This holistic evaluation was used by Zank
(2001) and by Bleichrodt and Miyamoto (2003).
Another approach, the focus of this paper, is that
the RA determines a DEMO point for each attribute
and evaluates job offers as gains and losses on each
attribute. This attribute-speciﬁc evaluation seems plau-
sible when the number DEMO attributes is large and
the choice is complex. A decision context where the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation is particularly intuitive is
welfare theory: there we are interested in whether
each individual’s welfare is above some reference
level. The DEMO evaluation is commonly
assumed in empirical studies on loss aversion for
trade-offs under certainty and was found to be
descriptively accurate by some studies (Bateman
et al. 1997, Bleichrodt and Pinto 2002, Tversky and
Kahneman DEMO). Also empirical studies for decision
under risk relied on the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation.
See, for example, Payne et al. (1984) who study DEMO
agers’ choices among capital budget proposals involv-
ing cash ﬂows at two points in time, and Fischer
et al. (1986) who consider both risky, multiperiod
cash ﬂows and risky job alternatives. Both studies
use attribute-speciﬁc reference points. No preference
foundation of the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation existed
until now. DEMO such a foundation is the topic of
this paper.
The difference between the holistic and the at-
tribute-speciﬁc evaluation is that in the former, loss
aversion and decision weighting are attribute-inde-
pendent, whereas in the latter they depend on the
attributes. As we show in §5, the holistic and the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation are in general equivalent
only when people behave DEMO to expected util-
ity, i.e., when loss aversion does not affect people’s
preferences and there is no decision weighting. An
example to further DEMO the difference between the
holistic and the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation is in §3.
This paper gives preference foundations for addi-
tive utility under prospect theory DEMO the attribute-
speciﬁc evaluation. We restrict our attention to the
additive decomposition for two reasons: First, it is
commonly applied in many areas DEMO economics and
decision analysis. Second, other decompositions, such

as multiplicative and multilinear utility, raise spe-
DEMO problems under the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation.
Solving these problems is beyond the scope of this
paper.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
DEMO 2 gives notation and explains prospect the-
ory for single-attribute outcomes. In §3, we move to
multiattribute utility where we ﬁrst assume, for DEMO
of exposition, that there are just two attributes, both
numerical. Section 4 gives preference foundations
for prospect theory with additive utility under the
DEMO evaluation. As mentioned, weight-
ing functions are deﬁned per attribute and DEMO may
differ across attributes in the attribute-speciﬁc eval-
uation. To force them to be equal across attributes
requires additional conditions. We will characterize
this DEMO case in §5. We extend our results to the
case where there are more than two attributes in §6
and to the case of DEMO outcomes in §7. Sec-
tion 8 concludes the paper with some observations
on the empirical measurement of additive utility in
prospect theory under the DEMO evalua-
tion. All proofs are in the appendix.
2. Prospect Theory for
Single-Attribute Outcomes
We consider a decision maker in a situation where
there DEMO a ﬁnite number, n ≥ 2 of distinct states of
nature, exactly one of which obtains.denotes the ﬁnite set of states of nature. DEMO ofS = 1nS are
called events. In a medical decision problem, DEMO states
of nature can, for example, be mutually exclusive dis-
eases, and the decision maker has to choose between
different treatments before knowing what the actual
disease is. We consider decision under uncertainty
where the DEMO for the states of nature may,
but need not, be DEMO The assumption of a ﬁnite
number of states of nature is made for expositional
purposes. The results of this paper can be extended
to DEMO inﬁnite state space using tools from Wakker
(1993). The extension DEMO decision under risk, i.e., the
case where probabilities are objectively given, is as in
Köbberling and Wakker (2003, §5.3).
The decision-maker’s problem is to choose between
prospects. Each prospect is an n-tuple of DEMO, one
for each state of nature. Formally, a prospect is a func-
tion from the set of states of nature to the set DEMO out-
comes C . We denote the set of prospects as P =Cn.
We shall write f1 fn for the prospect f that
gives DEMO if state j occurs. A constant prospect gives
the same outcome for each state of nature. For ease
of exposition, we assume in this section that out-
comes are one-dimensional. The set of outcomes C is
DEMO nondegenerate convex subset of . Outcomes are
deﬁned with respect to a reference point. The reference

point is a constant prospect, that we will denote as r.
We assume that the reference point is ﬁxed, i.e., we
restrict attention to preferences with respect to DEMO
reference point. Variations in the reference point are
analyzed by Schmidt (DEMO).
Let  denote a preference relation on the set of
prospects. As usual,  denotes the asymmetric part
of  (strict preference) and denotes the symmetric
part of  (indifference), and ∼ and ≺ denote reversed
preferences. We shall use the same notation for the
DEMO relations on C , derived through constant pros-
pects. An outcome x  r is a gain and an outcome
x ≺A prospectr is DEMO loss. f is rank-ordered if f1  ···  fn . For
each prospect, there exists a permutation , such that
f1  DEMO  fn . For each permutation , let P =
fprospects DEMO are rank-ordered by∈ P	f1  ···  fn. That is, P. DEMO two prospectsis the set of all
can be rank-ordered by a common , then they are
comonotonic. For each event A⊂S , the set PA contains
those prospects that yield gains for states in A, and no
gains for states not in
intersection of PA and
comonotonic.
A DEMO function V	P represents  on
P if for all f , g ∈ P we have if and only if
(iff) Vf ≥ DEMO A function V is a ratio scale if it
is unique up to unit, i.e., if V can be replaced by

functions for DEMO and losses, respectively. We will

all xy ∈ C, Ux ≥ Uy iff DEMO ≥ y , and continuous.If
prospect theory holds, then utility is DEMO ratio scale and
the weighting functions are uniquely determined.

3. Prospect Theory for Two-Attribute
Outcomes
From now on C = C1 × C2 DEMO a product of two
nondegenerate convex subsets of . Hence we now
deal with two product structures: the two-dimensional
structure of C and the n-dimensional structure Cn.
In what follows, the index i will refer to the attributes,
and the index j to the states of nature. DEMO fji
denotes the i th attribute of the outcome that is
obtained under state j Outcomes in C will be denoted
as x = DEMO x2 or as x1x2 for short. Note that although
we assumed x1 and x2 to be numerical, the notation
x1x2 should not be interpreted as multiplication.
denote the set of prospects on Cn
1 and P2 DEMO
Let P1
set of prospects on C2n For a ﬁxed f2 ∈ P2 , we deﬁne a
preference relation 1 on P1 by f1 DEMO 1 iff f1f2 g1f2.
In §4 we impose a condition that implies that the
choice of f2 is immaterial. By restricting attention to
constant DEMO in P1 , we can deﬁne a preference
relation 1 on C1 In a similar fashion we can deﬁne
2 on P2 and on DEMO
A function U	C →  is additive if U	x → U1 x1 +
U2 x2 where Ui is a real-valued function on Ci ,

U1 and U2 can be replaced by V1 and V2 if and only if
Vi =

>0 That is, any common DEMO in unit
is allowed.
In the holistic evaluation, any outcome x DEMO is
indifferent to r can also be interpreted as a reference
point. Hence, it does not make sense to consider gains
or losses on any separate dimension in the holistic
evaluation. What matters in the holistic DEMO is
whether an outcome x is a gain or a loss compared
to r (i.e., whether x r or x ≺r , respectively)DEMO

where the decision weights are deﬁned as in Equa-
tions (2a) and (2b). The uniqueness results of prospect
theory apply, which implies that the attribute util-
ity functions are joint ratio scales and the weight-
ing function is unique. There is only DEMO permutation
function that applies to both attributes. In this rep-
resentation, DEMO decision weight that is assigned to a
single-attribute utility function Ui , i =1 2 depends
on whether the entire outcome is a gain DEMO a loss. If
an outcome x is a gain then the decision weight +
is applied, if it is a loss then − is applied. Prefer-
ence foundations for Equation (3) were given by Zank
(2001) and Bleichrodt and Miyamoto (2003).

The attribute-speciﬁc evaluation assesses for each
attribute separately whether it yields DEMO gain or a loss
and the magnitude of each. That is, DEMO attribute-
speciﬁc evaluation interprets reference-dependence
for each attribute separately. We will denote the
reference point on the ﬁrst attribute by r1 and the refer-
DEMO point on the second attribute by r2. x1 ∈ C1 is a gain
if x1 1 r1 , and a loss if x1 ≺1 DEMO , and x2 ∈ C2 is a gain
erences are monotonic in each attribute. Then, unlikeif x2 2 r2 , and a loss if x2 ≺2 r2 . We assume that pref-
in the holistic evaluation, the reference point will be
unique. We further assume that r1 is DEMO interior point
of C1 and that r2 is an interior point of C2 . This ensures
that C1 and C2 both contain outcomes that DEMO gains
and outcomes that are losses, and that genuine trade-
offs DEMO gains and losses exist for both attributes.
For each prospect f , there exist permutations 1
and 2 such that f111  ··· f1 DEMO and f212  ··· 

rank-ordered by 1. P2 is deﬁned similarly. For each
eventthat yield gains on the ﬁrst attribute for states DEMO ⊂ S , the set PA1 contains those prospectsA

and no gains on the ﬁrst attribute for states not
in A1 . Similarly, PA2 contains those prospects that
yield gains on the second attribute for DEMO in A2
and no gains on the second attribute for states not

are the weighting functions for DEMO and losses for
the ﬁrst attribute, and W+ and W− are DEMO weighting
functions for gains and losses for the second attribute.
The utility functions are joint ratio scales and the
attribute weighting functions are unique. DEMO compar-
ison between Equations (3) and (4) reveals that the
holistic evaluation and the attribute-speciﬁc evalu-
ation differ both in loss aversion DEMO in decision
weighting.
An example may further clarify the difference
between the holistic and the attribute-speciﬁc eval-
uation of additive utility. Suppose that the DEMO con-
siders a job offer from a university in a different
town. The uncertainty she faces is whether her hus-
band will be able DEMO ﬁnd a suitable job in the new
town. If he does, DEMO combined annual income will
be $80K but she will only have 15 hours research
time per week because she will have to take over
DEMO domestic activities from her husband (e.g., tak-
ing care of the children). If he does not ﬁnd a job,
their combined DEMO income will be $40K but she
will have 30 hours research time per week because
her husband will take care of all domestic activities.
DEMO the example, there is only one source of uncertainty
(whether or not the RA’s husband ﬁnds a suitable
job). In real-life applications, there may be different
sources of uncertainty affecting the attributes sepa-
rately. DEMO example, the RA’s research time may not
be affected by her DEMO ﬁnding a job (because
she can hire someone to take care DEMO her domestic
activities) but it is affected by whether or not DEMO
will be able to ﬁnd a suitable home near the univer-
sity (if not, commuting will negatively affect the time
available for research)DEMO To model such situations we
have to reﬁne the state space (DEMO are “husband
ﬁnds job and home near the university,” “husband
ﬁnds job but home far from university,” etc.). For sim-
plicity DEMO exposition, we only consider one source of
uncertainty.
The RA’s preferences DEMO monotonic both in money
(more money is preferred) and in research time (more
research time is preferred). Suppose that currently the
RA and her husband earn $50K per year and she has
20 hours DEMO time per week. Suppose also that
$80K 15h  $50K 20h  $40K 30h The RA’s
reference point is $50K 20h in the holistic DEMO
ation. In the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation, the RA’s
reference point for annual DEMO is $50K and for
research time it is 20 hours per week.
In the holistic evaluation, where we determine ﬁrst
the sign of an outcome and then apply the decom-
positions, we assume that the RA’s utility function
for gains is ux1x2 − ur1r2 and her utility func-
DEMO for losses isux1x2 − ur1r2 , where is a

that both decision weighting and loss aversion differ

tion,ingeneral,allowsfordifferentdegreesoflossaver-
sion and different weighting functions for each of the

The possibility of attribute-dependent weighting
functions can be realistic DEMO applications. Rottenstreich
and Hsee (2001) showed that decision weighting de-
pends on the outcome domain with people deviating
more from expected utility for DEMO outcomes,
outcomes that arouse strong emotions. Examples of
such outcomes are health states and environmental
effects. For example, Smith and Keeney (2005) stud-
ied trade-offs between consumption and health. In
such a setting it DEMO well be that people weight
health risks differently than consumption risks. Dyer
et al. (1998) compared different alternatives for dis-
posing surplus weapons-grade DEMO Here deci-
sion makers may weight risks to the environment
differently from risk regarding the costs of the alter-
natives. In §5, we characterize the special case of
the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation where the weight-
ing functions DEMO the same across different attributes.
There is no empirical evidence to conclude that loss
aversion differs across different attributes, but intu-
itively this seems to make sense.

4. Preference Foundations
This section develops preference DEMO for ad-
ditive prospect theory under the attribute-speciﬁc
evaluation, i.e., Equation (4). We continue to assume
that C =C1 ×C2 with C1 and C2 nondegenerate convex
subsets of .
4.1. General Preference Conditions
This DEMO presents the standard preference con-
ditions that are used in both the holistic and attribute-
speciﬁc approaches. The preference relation  on the
set DEMO prospects P is a weak order if it is complete (for
DEMO prospects fg f g or g f ) and transitive.
Any prospect f ∈ P yields both a prospect f1 ∈ P1
and a DEMO f2 ∈ P2 and, hence, each prospect f
may be viewed as an element of the product P1 ×P2.
Hence, we can denote prospects as f1f2. Weak
separability holds when for all f1 g1 ∈ DEMO and for all
f2 g2 ∈ P2 f1f2  g1f2 iff f1g2  g1g2 and when for
all f1 g1 ∈ P1 and for DEMO f2 g2 ∈ P2 f1f2  f1g2 iff
g1f2 g1g2 . Weak separability entails that the relations
1 on P1 and 2 on P2 DEMO well-deﬁned.
Further standard properties are monotonicity for
outcomes and continuity: outcome DEMO holds if
for i =1 2fji ≥gji for all j implies fi i gi with strict
preference holding if one of the antecedent inequal-

indifferences, everything outside state of nature 1 is

DEMO w1f2 and c1f1 v1f2 ∼ d1f1 w1f2. The
indifferences and no new primitives beyond observed∼1∗ relations are deﬁned entirely in terms of observed

stay entirely within the revealed DEMO paradigm

We say that  satisﬁes trade-off consistency on C1

that the ∼∗ relationship is well-behaved when inter-
DEMO as a strength of preference relationship. If the
strength of preference of a over b is equal to the
strength of preference of c DEMO d , then the strength of
preference of a over b cannot be equal to the strength
of preference of c over d , DEMO a is strictly better
than a.

improving the second attribute of an outcome in

sistency holds both onwx ∼∗ y z. Trade-off consistencyC1 and onholds if trade-off con-C2 . DEMO important
advantage of trade-off consistency as a preference
condition is that it is closely related to measure-
ments of utility by the trade-off method (Wakker and
Deneffe 1996). This makes it easy to test trade-off

consistency empirically. Empirical studies DEMO have
used the trade-off method include Abdellaoui (2000),
Etchart-Vincent (DEMO), Schunk and Betsch (2006), and
Abdellaoui et al. (2007) amongst others.
Trade-off consistency is a powerful condition. It has
two effects. First, it ensures that we can deﬁne
prospect theory functionals for both attributes and
second, it ensures that the overall evaluation is addi-
tive in these two prospect theory functionals.
4.3. Representation for Two Attributes
To DEMO the representing functional for preferences,
we need an additional assumption. Solvability holds if
for any two prospects fg ∈ P there exists outcomes
DEMO implies that the attribute utility functionsand  such that ( 1f1 f2 ∼ g and f1 1f2 ∼ g.
U1 and U2 are unbounded.
DEMO next theorem characterizes Equation (4).
Theorem 1. The following two DEMO are equiva-
lent:
(i)  is represented by the functional in Equation (4)
with strictly increasing weighting functions W+, W−, W+,
and W− and continuous, strictly increasing utility func-
tions U1 and U2.
(ii)  satisﬁes (1) weak ordering, (2) continuity,
(3) weak separability, (4) outcome monotonicity, (5) solv-
ability, and (6) trade-off consistency.
The uniqueness results of DEMO theory apply, that is,
the weighting functions Wi+ and Wi−, i = 1 2,are
uniquely determined, and the utility functions U1 and U2
are joint ratio scales.
5. Common Weighting Functions
In the DEMO evaluation, the weighting
functions may differ across the two attributes. In DEMO
cases, however, it might be reasonable to take the
weighting functions independent of the attributes.
Empirical evidence suggests, for example, that deci-
DEMO weights for money and for health are close
(Abdellaoui 2000 compared DEMO Bleichrodt and Pinto
2000). Using common weighting functions facilitates
the use of prospect theory in practical applications,
because fewer elicitations are required. DEMO this section
we will give a preference foundation for the special
case of Equation (4) where the weighting functions do
not depend on DEMO attributes.
By continuity and connectedness of C1 and C2 , there
exist gains x1 ∈ C1 and x2 ∈ C2 and losses y1 ∈ DEMO
and y2 ∈ C2 , such that x1 r2 ∼ r1 x2 and y1 r2 ∼
r1 y2 and, hence, such that U1 DEMO = U2 x2 and
U1 y1 =U2 y2. Recall that r is the constant prospect
that gives r1 r2 in every state of nature. DEMO any
event B, let xBf denote the prospect f with fj DEMO
by x for all j in B . We can now deﬁne a condition
that ensures attribute independence of the weighting
functions for gains DEMO for losses.

We say that  satisﬁes attribute-independence for
states, if for all x1 ∈ C1 and x2 ∈ C2 for which x1 r2 ∼
r1 x2 and for all events DEMO, x1 r2Br ∼ r1 x2Br . Note
that the condition holds DEMO allbut x1 and x2 must be either both gains or both lossesx1 ∈ C1 and x2 ∈ C2,
for otherwise the indifference x1 DEMO ∼ r1 x2 cannot
obtain.
We will now explain the idea behind the condition.
As mentioned before, if x1 r2 ∼ r1 x2 then U1 x1 =
U x . If Equation (4) holds and DEMO and x are both
2 2 1 2
gains, the indifference DEMO r2Br ∼ r1 x2Br implies
that W1+ BU1 x1 =W2+ BU2 x2 and W1+B =W2+B
follows from U1 x1 = U2 x2. A similar DEMO of argu-
are losses. Because these equalities hold for allment shows that W1−B =W2−B whenever x1 and x2
events B , we obtain the DEMO result:
Corollary 2. If we add attribute-independence for
states to statement (ii) of Theorem 1, then the weight-
ing functions in statement (i) of Theorem 1 are attribute-
independent, i.e., W1+ =W2+ DEMO and W1− =W2− =W−.
that the decision weightsIf 1 =2 and A1 =A2 then Corollary 2 also implies+ and − are attribute-
independent. This DEMO from the deﬁnition of the
decision weights, Equations (5a) and (5b). Having
the weighting functions independent of the attributes
does not DEMO the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation equal
to the holistic evaluation. This is easily seen by refer-
ring back to the example of the RA considering the
DEMO job. Under the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation with
common weighting functions, Equation (7) becomes
+u180 −u150 + 1− 2 u215 −u220
+ − 1 u140 −u150 + +u230 −u215
showing that the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation clearly
differs from DEMO holistic evaluation, Equation (6).
Note that it is not only the presence of the loss aver-
sion parameter that distinguishes the holistic DEMO the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation. In general, the two eval-
uations differ even DEMO a prospect yields only gains or
only losses. Consider again the job offer example but
suppose now that the RA’s reference point for annual
DEMO is $30K and for research time it is 10 hours
per week. The preference $80K 15h  $40K 30h
still holds. Let E denote DEMO event “husband ﬁnds a
1
job” and E2 the event “husband does not ﬁnd a job.”
Under the holistic evaluation, the job’s value is

Equality only holds if W+E1 = 1 − W+E2 , i.e.,

uation this can only be the case if W+ is DEMO proba-
bility measure. A similar argument can be used to
derive that W− must be a probability measure. Hence,
for outcomes of the DEMO sign and attribute inde-
pendent weighting, the attribute-speciﬁc evaluation
agrees with DEMO holistic evaluation only when both
representations reduce to subjective expected utility.
6. More Than Two Attributes
We will now extend our results to more DEMO two
attributes. Let C = C1 ×···× Cm, m> 2. Each Ci is a
nondegenerate convex subset of . The reference point
on DEMO i th attribute is denoted ri and is assumed to
be an interior point of Ci . We will denote the set of
prospects DEMO Cin as Pi and write prospects as f1 fm.
Let gi f denote the prospect f ∈ P with fi replaced by
replaced bygi , and let ggiihandkf denote the prospectfk replaced by hk . Weak separabilityf ∈ P with fi
is now deﬁned as follows: for all i ∈ 1m, fi gi ∈
Poutcome monotonicity, continuity, and solvability eas-i , f  g ∈ P, fi f  gi f  iff fi g gi g . The deﬁnitions of
ily generalize to DEMO case of more than two attributes.
For trade-off consistency we deﬁne
ab ∼∗ cd
if (i) there exist fi gi ∈ Pi , DEMO ∈ P , and a state j such that
ajfi i f ∼ bjgi i f and cjfi i f ∼ djgi i f
DEMO ajfi , bjgi , cjfi , and djgi are sign-comono-
tonic on Ci , or (ii) there exist vw ∈ Ck , and DEMO ∈ P
such that
a1fi i v1fkkf ∼ b1fi i w1fkkf and
c1fi i v1fkkf ∼ d1fi i w1fkk f
where a1fi , b1fi , c1fi , and d1fi are rank-ordered
prospects in Pi and v1fk , and w1fk are rank-ordered
prospects in Pk.
Trade-off consistency holds if each DEMO -relationship
satisﬁes trade-off consistency on Ci .
We are now in a position to extend Theorem 1 to
the case of more than two DEMO
Theorem 3. The following two statements are equiva-
lent:
(i)  is represented by V = m Vi fi  where the DEMO
=1
i
are prospect theory functionals with strictly increasing
weighting functions Wi+ and Wi− and continuous, strictly
increasing utility functions Ui .

(ii)  satisﬁes (1) weak ordering, (2) continuity,
(3) weak separability, (4) outcome monotonicity, (5) DEMO
ability, and (6) trade-off consistency.
The uniqueness results of prospect DEMO apply, that is,
the weighting functions Wi+ and Wi− are DEMO deter-
mined, and the utility functions Ui are joint ratio scales.
DEMO independence can easily be extended to
the case of more than two attributes, so that the
arguments preceding Corollary 2 can still be used
to ensure that the weighting functions are attribute-
independent.
7. General Outcomes
DEMO ease of exposition, we have assumed thus far
that all attributes DEMO numerical. In many real-world
decisions, this assumption is too restrictive. An DEMO
ple is health, the area in which decision analysis is
most DEMO applied (Keller and Kleinmuntz 1998,
Smith and von Winterfeldt 2004)DEMO Health consists of
two dimensions, survival duration and health qual-
ity, and health quality is a nonnumeric attribute. The
extension of our analysis DEMO nonnumeric attributes is
as follows.
Assume that the Ci are connected topological
spaces. C =C1 ×···×Cm is endowed with the product
topology and so DEMO Cn . The reference points r are in
i
the interior of Ci for each i . Redeﬁne outcome mono-
tonicity as follows: for all i,if fji  gji for all j then
fi i DEMO . The strict version of outcome monotonicity is
not necessary here as it follows from the version with
weak preferences and trade-off consistency (Köbber-
ling and Wakker 2003, Lemma 26). We can now state
the extension of our results to nonnumeric attributes.
Corollary 4. If the Ci , i = 1m, are connected
topological spaces, then Theorems 1 and 3 still hold if we
drop in (i), the requirement that the attribute-wise utility
functions are strictly increasing.
The proof of this claim DEMO easily from the
proofs of Theorems 1 and 3. Corollary 2 can still
be used to ensure that the weighting functions are
attribute-independent.
8. DEMO Measurement
A few comments concerning the empirical imple-
mentability of additive prospect theory under the
attribute-speciﬁc evaluation are worth mentioning.
For empirical purposes a DEMO step is obviously the
veriﬁcation of the preference conditions that have
been identiﬁed in this paper. When these are sat-
isﬁed, the elicitation of the attribute-speciﬁc evalu-
ation is simpler than that of the holistic evaluation
DEMO we do not need to know the ranking of out-
comes. Essentially, we can apply the known elicitation
Bleichrodt, Schmidt, and Zank: DEMO Utility in Prospect Theory
Management Science 55(5), pp. 863–873, DEMO INFORMS
techniques for single-dimensional prospect theory to
each of the attributes. When attribute-independence
for states holds, the weighting functions have to be
assessed only once.
A procedure to measure utility under prospect
theory was recently proposed DEMO Abdellaoui et al.
(2007). Their method uses various elicitation tech-
DEMO (probability equivalence, certainty equivalence,
and Wakker and Deneffe’s 1996 trade-off method).
A simpler procedure was proposed by Abdellaoui
et al. (2008). Their method only uses certainty equiva-
lence questions but is less DEMO than the procedure
of Abdellaoui et al. (2007) in that it assumes that the
utility functions are power functions.
The weighting functions Wi+ DEMO Wi−, i ∈ 1m
can be measured either through the nonchoice-based
DEMO of Tversky and Fox (1995), Fox and Tversky
(1998), Wu and Gonzalez (1999), or Kilka and
Weber (2001) or through the choice-based method of
Abdellaoui et al. (2005). If probabilities are known
then the methods of Abdellaoui (2000) or Bleichrodt
and DEMO (2000) can be applied.
We can also use the representation results for
single-dimensional prospect theory (Prelec 1998,
Wakker and Tversky 1993, DEMO and Zank 2002)
to restrict the functional forms of the utility func-
tions and the weighting functions. If preferences
do not change when DEMO multiply all levels of an
attribute by a common constant (while DEMO the
other attribute constant), then the attribute utility
function must be a power function. If preferences
are invariant to adding a constant to DEMO levels of
an attribute such that the sign of the attribute lev-
els is preserved (and the other attribute is held
constant), then the attribute utility function is expo-
nential. When probabilities are known and DEMO
ences satisfy Prelec’s (1998) compound invariance
conditions, then the weighting DEMO must have
the form wi p = exp−i ln−p , i DEMO −. Condi-
tions for deriving exponential or power weighting
functions are presented in Diecidue et al. (2009).

Appendix. Proofs
Proof of Theorem 1. That (DEMO) implies (ii) is routine.
Hence we assume (ii) and DEMO (i).
By weak order, weak separability, outcome monotonicity,
DEMO continuity,  on P can be represented by VV1 f1 
DEMO f2  with V strictly increasing in V1 and V2. V1 represents
1 and V2 represents 2 . By continuity, V1 and V2 are contin-
uous, by outcome monotonicity, they are strictly increasing.
We will DEMO show that V1 and V2 are prospect theory
functionals. For a prospect f1 ∈ P1 , deﬁne the prospect f1+
Bleichrodt, Schmidt, and Zank: Additive Utility in Prospect Theory
Management Science 55(5), pp. 863–873, ©2009 INFORMS
by f1+j = f1j if f1j 1 r1 and by f1+j = r1 otherwise, and the
wise. That is,prospect f1− byf1+f1−jis the positive part of= f1j if f1j DEMO r1 and byf1 fand1−j =fr11− other-is its
negative part. In a similar fashion, we deﬁne f2+ and f2−.
Consider 1 on P1 . Because  satisﬁes outcome mono-
tonicity and C1 is nondegenerate, all states of nature are
nonnull (a state is null if replacing any outcomes in that
state does not affect the preference). Also, because r1 lies
in the interior of C1, 1 is truly mixed (1 is DEMO mixed
if there exists a prospect f1 such that f +  r1 and f + ≺ r1,
1
1
that is, genuine trade-offs between gains and losses occur).
By Theorem 12 in Köbberling DEMO Wakker (2003) there
exists a prospect theory representation for 1 with U1 , the
continuous utility function over C1, U1 r1 = 0, and W+,
and W− , the weighting functions over gains and losses on
1
1
the ﬁrst attribute, respectively. Köbberling and Wakker’s
(DEMO) weak monotonicity follows from outcome mono-
tonicity and sign-comonotonic trade-off consistency DEMO
from trade-off consistency on C1 . By Proposition 8.2 in
Wakker and Tversky (1993), gain-loss consistency can be
dropped from Köbberling and Wakker’s (2003) conditions
when the number of states of nature exceeds two. DEMO is
the case in our analysis if we interpret attributes as events
(Sarin and Wakker 1998, Corollary B.3). U1 is strictly increas-
DEMO because V1 is strictly increasing. W+ and W− are strictly
increasing by outcome monotonicity. By Observation 13 in
Köbberling and Wakker (2003), U1 is a ratio scale and W+
and W− are unique. By solvability, U1 is unbounded.
By a similar line of argument, there exists a prospect
theory representation for 2 , with U2 the continuous and
strictly DEMO utility function on C2, U2 r2 = 0, U2 a
ratio scale, and W+ and W− the unique and strictly increas-
2 2
ing weighting functions over gains and losses on the second
attribute, respectively. By solvability, U2 is unbounded.
So far we have shown that VPT1 f1  PT2 f2  repre-
sents . It remains to show DEMO V is additive. We will
do so by showing that the rate of trade-offs between

Finally, because U1 and U2 are unbounded DEMO can-
not be elements x1 and x2 that are so bad that they
are never included in any grid. Consider an outcome x2.
Then DEMO can construct a prospect f2 with f2j = x2 for
all j . Because U2 is unbounded, we can construct a

By continuity we can extend the dense grid to all out-

the rate of trade-off between PT1 and PT2 is DEMO for
rank-ordered prospects. Hence, for rank-ordered prospects

results for PT1 and PT2 combined with the fact that on each
grid DEMO rate of trade-off between PT1 and PT2 must be con-
stant. This completes the proof of Theorem 1. 
Proof of Theorem 3. That (i) implies (ii) is routine.
Hence, we assume (ii) DEMO derive (i). The proof is very
similar to the proof DEMO Theorem 1 and will not be elabo-
