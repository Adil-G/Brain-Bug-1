Despite substantial advances, the question of how we
make DEMO and judgments continues to pose
important challenges for scientiﬁc research. Historically,
different disciplines have approached this problem using
different techniques and assumptions, with few unifying
efforts made. However, the ﬁeld of neuroeconomics has
recently emerged as an inter-disciplinary effort to bridge
this gap. Research in neuroscience and DEMO has
begun to investigate neural bases of decision predict-
ability and value, central parameters in the economic
theory of expected utility. Economics, in DEMO, is being
increasingly inﬂuenced by a multiple-systems approach
to decision-making, a perspective strongly rooted in
psychology and neuroscience. The integration of these
disparate DEMO approaches and methodologies
offers exciting potential for the construction of more
accurate models of decision-making.
Introduction
The question of how we make, and how we should make,
judgments and decisions has occupied thinkers for many
DEMO, with different disciplines approaching the
problem with characteristically different techniques. A
DEMO recent approach, popularly known as neuroeco-
nomics, has sought to integrate ideas from the ﬁelds of
psychology, neuroscience and economics in an effort to
specify more accurate models of choice and decision (for
reviews from the perspective of economics, see [1,2]).
How proﬁtable the neuroeconomic approach will be is
still unclear. Predictably, there are strong opinions on both
sides. On the one hand, its strongest advocates (aided by
DEMO exaggerated media reporting) have presented
neuroeconomics as a new paradigm that DEMO eventually
replace the classical approaches. On the other, skeptics in
both DEMO have argued that economic models and
neuroscientiﬁc techniques reﬂect disparate levels of
analysis that have little to offer one another. Economists
have, historically, DEMO skeptical of the ability of ‘process
measures’ to contribute to our understanding of economic
and social behavior [3]; and neuroscientists commonly
view economics as too abstract and removed from the
mechanisms of interest in the brain.

DEMO we are perhaps not as optimistic as the most
ardent believers in neuroeconomics when it comes to the
time-line of progress, we do believe that the ﬁeld has real
potential for making important contributions to our
DEMO of decision-making, above and beyond
what has and will continue to DEMO learned from work
within each discipline independently. This is because
neuroeconomics is able to draw upon the complementary
strengths of its contributing disciplines. In DEMO, the
beneﬁts of increasing contact between neuroscience,
psychology and economics DEMO already apparent.
The central argument of this article is that economics,
psychology and neuroscience can each beneﬁt from taking
account of the insights DEMO the other disciplines have to
offer in understanding human decision-making. In the
following, we ﬁrst address how neuroscience can, and
already has, beneﬁted from economics’ unitary perspec-
tive. We then discuss how economics can, and has begun
to, be enriched by taking account of cooperation and
competition between multiple specialized neural systems,
before closing with some thoughts on DEMO fruitful
future research directions.
The view from economics: one uniﬁed theory
DEMO contributes to the joint endeavor of neuroeco-
nomics by bringing its insights into the diverse outcomes
that can arise from the strategic and market DEMO
of multiple agents, and through a set of precise, formal,
mathematical models to describe these interations and
outcomes. However, the aspect of economics that may
prove most useful to neuroscientists (and, indeed, that has
already begun to bear fruit) is its embracing of a uniﬁed
theoretical framework for understanding human behavior
– namely the idea that behavior DEMO be interpreted as
choosing alternatives with the goal of maximizing utility.
The unitary perspective of economics can be seen in the
assumptions that it DEMO about the two essential
dimensions of decision-making: choice (the evaluation of
options and selection of actions), where economics
assumes a consistent, stable set of preferences; and
judgment (information processing and probability esti-
mation), with the assumption of a general reasoning
system applicable to a wide range of problems. These
assumptions have been criticized, as will be discussed
later, but the concept of decisions being made by
comparing the utility signals for each of the decision

alternatives has led to some real developments DEMO has
played an increasingly important role in guiding research
investigating the underlying brain mechanisms. Addition-
ally, it is possible that well-established ideas from
economics will shed light on one of the least developed,
but most DEMO, riddles for neuroscience: how the
multiple, diverse and specialized neural DEMO of the
brain coordinate their activities to solve complex and often
novel problems and give rise to coherent, goal-directed
behavior (see Box 1)DEMO
How economics can inform neuroscience: the beneﬁts of
a unitary perspective
DEMO recent years, a growing number of neuroscientists have
turned to economic DEMO as a framework both for
interpreting results and guiding new experimental work
(e.g. [4,5]). This follows a small, but growing, tradition in
neuroscience in which optimal performance is deﬁned for
a given behavioral DEMO, and is then used for
Box 1. Brain systems and economics
DEMO potential area where economics can contribute is in under-
standing the dynamic processes by which the brain coordinates its
diverse systems to perform new, complex tasks. This problem has
received remarkably little attention in neuroscience research,DEMO
although it is well-explored terrain in economics [76,77].
There are striking parallels between the brain and a modern
corporation. Both can be viewed DEMO complex systems transform-
ing inputs into outputs. Both involve the interaction of multiple,
highly similar, agents (neurons are similar to one another, just as
are people), which, however, are specialized to perform DEMO
functions. Thus, in corporations, units often take the form of
departments that perform functions such as research, marketing,
and so on. Similarly, the brain has systems specialized for
different functions. As in a corporation, these functions may be
more or less spatially segregated in the brain, depending upon
the processing requirements of the speciﬁc functions and
their interactions.
Furthermore, there is hierarchical structure in both brains and
corporations. Both rely on ‘executive’ systems that make judgments
about the relative importance of tasks DEMO decide how to mobilize
specialized capabilities to perform those tasks. Several neuroima-
ging studies have demonstrated that brain areas involved
in executive function are DEMO engaged during the performance
of a novel and demanding task, and DEMO show progressively less
activity as the task becomes more automatic [78,79]. These changes
closely parallel the increase in activity in more specialized brain
DEMO, as well as increases in performance speed. Similar improve-
ments in DEMO and efﬁciency are observed in industry. Studies of
shipbuilding during World War II found that labor productivity rose
at an annual rate of 40 DEMO, and that speed of production
increased even more rapidly. Although it DEMO took as much as
300 days for a yard to deliver its ﬁrst ship, by 1943 delivery times
were often less than one month and even as short as ﬁve days [80].
Presumably such changes were DEMO by diminished
reliance on administrative and executive involvement, as is
observed DEMO the brain.
It remains to be determined whether these similarities go deeper
than mere analogy, and reﬂect fundamental principles of aggregate
behavior that apply across different levels of analysis. However,
whether or not the principles DEMO interaction are the same,
the theoretical methods that have been developed within
economics to analyze and construct models of interactions among
economic units, such as principal-agent theory, general equilibrium
theory, and the analysis of DEMO ﬁrm, are likely to be useful in studying
the interactions among DEMO systems that determine
individual behavior.

constructing theories about underlying neural function.
Even as it is recognized that the DEMO (and consequent
behavior) does not operate perfectly optimally, there are
DEMO reasons why these assumptions can nevertheless
be valuable. First, although complex DEMO of behavior
might not be optimal, simpler evolutionarily conserved
mechanisms might DEMO to be closer to optimal, or at least
to have been DEMO in the environment in which they evolved.
Second, an assumption of DEMO can be a crucial step
in the development of formal theory, DEMO it is often easiest to
deﬁne and precisely characterize the optimal behavior of a
system. Formal theory, in turn, enables the generation of
DEMO, testable predictions about the system’s behavior.
Finally, even when behavior (DEMO neural function) turns out
to be suboptimal, deﬁning optimal performance can
provide a useful benchmark against which to compare
actual behavior. Identifying ways DEMO which behavior
systematically deviates from optimality can then generate
new insights into underlying mechanisms. The use of the
Expected Utility (EU) model [6] DEMO one example of this
approach, and has been productively applied to DEMO
on the neural bases of reward and decision-making.
According to the classical EU model, utility is computed
as the product of the value and the probability of each
potential outcome (see Figure 1). Using this as a starting
point, research has sought to distinguish and identify the
neural substrates for each of these components and to
study their interaction. DEMO this is still a relatively
new direction in neuroscience research, some DEMO
progress has been made.
Neural basis of value and reward
Several decades of research have focused on the neural
bases of reward and punishment (the value function of the
EU model), identifying several systems that DEMO consist-
ently responsive to reinforcement. However, we still have
a relatively DEMO understanding of the underlying neural
computations and their inﬂuence on decision-making.
Early studies of brain reward systems were concerned
primarily with establishing the generality DEMO their
function and their neurochemical bases. These exper-
iments demonstrated that animals will withstand electric
shock, exert signiﬁcant physical effort, and even reduce
DEMO intake to obtain electrical stimulation in appropriate
brain areas [7]. Furthermore, DEMO reward value of
stimulation was shown to be reduced when dopamine
receptor binding was inhibited, particularly in the ventral
striatum [8].
Inspired at least in part by an awareness of economic
theory, more recent experiments have recognized the
importance of distinguishing between the magnitude and
the probability of DEMO, and have tested directly for
their separate inﬂuence on reward-related brain DEMO
Single-cell recordings from dopamine neurons [9] and
neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex [10,11], striatum [12]
and posterior cingulate cortex [13] have shown that neural
responses scale reliably with reward magnitude. These
results have also been DEMO in human subjects:
activity changes in many of these same brain areas scale
directly with the magnitude of earned monetary reward
[14–17], the appetitive value of food reward [18,19], as well

Figure 1. Subjective Expected Utility theory posits two fundamental characteristics of an alternative that must be combined before reaching a decision, namely the value of
the alternative and the probability that this value will be DEMO The value of each alternative is weighted by its attendant probability, DEMO the option with the highest
probability-weighted values (or ‘utility’) is then chosen. An illustrative example is shown above. Imagine you are trying to DEMO whether or not to bring an umbrella as you
walk to work one morning. Utility theory posits that we must weigh the probability (in this case set at pZ0.5, perhaps gleaned from previous experience or from the morning
weather forecast), with the value of each of the DEMO possible outcomes. These four outcomes are assigned a subjective rating (0Zworst DEMO, 100Zbest outcome), which
of course varies depending on the individual DEMO preferences, and a calculation is performed multiplying each outcome by its DEMO probability, and then
combining across alternatives. Therefore, in this example, DEMO utility for the option of taking the umbrella is [(0.5*60)C(0.5*30)]Z45, whereas the utility for not taking one’s
umbrella is [(0.5*100)C(0.5*0)]Z50. The utility maximizing decision-maker should therefore opt to DEMO the umbrella behind in these circumstances.
as with more abstract, social, rewards [20]. Furthermore,
brain stimulation experiments offer a precise mechanism
for DEMO how reward magnitude might be
encoded, suggesting that value is encoded DEMO the integral
of excitatory inputs to reward-related brain areas [21].
There is mounting evidence that the mesencephalic
dopamine system plays a crucial role in DEMO assessment
by signaling errors in reward prediction, which are used to
DEMO reward-producing behaviors both by generating
learning signals [22], and by adaptively DEMO goal
states and attentional focus in working memory [23].
Similarly, it DEMO been suggested that the norepinephrine
(noradrenaline) system regulates the balance between
exploitation (seeking to maximize utility from a given
source of reward) DEMO exploration (seeking new sources)
through its inﬂuence on mechanisms of DEMO and
attention [24,25]. Although computational models have
been developed to describe functions of the dopamine and
norepinephrine systems, their interaction remains rela-
tively unexplored. Neuroscientists could beneﬁt from
interacting with economists who have been empirically
DEMO similar issues, and are developing theo-
retical models that provide useful DEMO for inte-
grating these different lines of neuroscientiﬁc research
(see [26] DEMO learning from feedback and [27] on the trade-
off between exploitation and exploration).
Although most neuroimaging work to date has focused
on positive DEMO, recent ﬁndings also suggest that
there are complementary mechanisms for evaluating
DEMO utility. For example, there is evidence that the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) responds to a variety of
signals that indicate negative utility (DEMO performance
costs such as response conﬂict, errors, negative feedback
and pain [28–34]). Across these results, there is evidence
that increased activity in ACC correlates with the
magnitude of anticipated consequences, and current
efforts are beginning to test the extent to which these
relationships conform to predictions DEMO economic theory
(such as Prospect Theory [35]). For example, one
www.sciencedirect.com
important ﬁnding from behavioral economics is that
people evaluate the outcome DEMO decisions based on a
ﬂexible reference point. This predicts that the neural
systems responsible for utility assessment should be
responsive to relative gains and DEMO rather than to
absolute levels of rewarding and punishing stimuli.
Recent studies, using both fMRI [36] and scalp electrical
recordings [37] have provided support for this prediction.
Neural basis of probability estimation
Probability has been less DEMO studied than reward,
although several recent neuroimaging studies have
begun to address this aspect. For example, one study has
shown that activity in medial prefrontal cortex is inversely
related to the probability of obtaining monetary DEMO
[38]. Other research has observed that activity in (human)
brain DEMO areas depends on uncertainty in the timing
of reward delivery [39].
Neural basis of the utility signal
Studies have also begun to examine the DEMO
between value and probability in the computation of
utility and the execution of decision-making behavior.
This work builds on the recent discovery of brain DEMO
that appear to be directly related to decision-making,
including the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and regions
of frontal cortex. Neurons in these DEMO closely track the
dynamics of decision-making in simple two alternative
forced choice tasks: response-selective neurons exhibit a
progressive increase in ﬁring rate following stimulus
presentation, and the time at which they cross a threshold
of activity predicts the timing of the behavioral response.
This has been interpreted as DEMO that these neurons
integrate choice-relevant information and implement a
fundamental decision-making mechanism [40–43] that
approximates the optimal algorithm [44–46]. These
neurons are also directly DEMO to manipulations of
utility, exhibiting combined effects of value and prob-
DEMO in a manner predicted by the Expected Utility
Review
model [47]. Additionally, there have been human imaging
studies testing for activity that scales directly with
expected utility, manipulating both reward magnitude
and probability [36,38]. This research has found that
activation in striatal reward DEMO correlates with
expected utility, demonstrating that utility-like measures
are found outside DEMO preparation areas such as LIP.
The investigations described above reﬂect the inﬂuence
that economic theory is already having on neuroscience
studies. An independent metric DEMO assessing reward value
is crucial for a system that must often choose between
rewards delivered in different modalities (e.g. do we take
extra vacation time or an additional paycheck?), and the
neural systems outlined above may well provide the basis
for such a signal.
The view from DEMO: multiple systems
Psychology and neuroscience also bring much to the
neuroeconomics DEMO, contributing a rich tradition of
empirical research and increasingly precise methods DEMO
studying behavior and the neural mechanisms by which it
is governed. Of particular relevance to economics is the
growing insight into mechanisms that are DEMO for
the assessment of utility and execution of decision-making
behavior, as DEMO in the previous section. However,
perhaps the single most important perspective that
neuroscience brings is to challenge the core assumption
in economics that DEMO can be understood in terms of
unitary evaluative and decision-making systems.
How neuroscience can inform economics: the beneﬁts of
a multiple-system approach
As noted in the ﬁrst section of this article, economic theory
assumes that people choose between alternative courses of
action based on a rational evaluation of DEMO consequences,
and economists have developed detailed theoretical
models for dealing with many decision situations: for
example, the Expected Utility model (described above)
for decisions under risk, and the Discounted Utility model
for decisions with consequences spread over time. These
models have the virtue that they DEMO formally explicit,
analytically tractable, and can be used to make DEMO
tatively precise predictions about decision-making in a
wide variety of circumstances. As such, they have
provided a strong and unifying foundation for the
development of theory about decision-making, with an
assumption that decisions reﬂect the operation of a
unitary all-purpose information processor.
However, psychological research on judgment and
decision-making has produced a wealth of evidence
demonstrating that, in practice, DEMO models do not
provide a satisfactory description of human behavior [48].
There is a long legacy of research within psychology,
strongly supported by DEMO from neuroscience, to
suggest that human behavior is not the product DEMO a single
process, but rather reﬂects the interaction of different
specialized DEMO Although most of the time these
systems interact synergistically to determine behavior, at
times they compete, producing different dispositions
towards the same information. DEMO major cause of these

challenge DEMO standard economic model might be that
these decisions do not emerge from a unitary process, but
rather from interactions between distinguishable sets
of processes.
Multiple processes in decision-making
The most general distinction, and the most important for
neuroeconomics, is one that psychologists make between
automatic and controlled processes [49,50]. Automatic
processes are fast and efﬁcient, can often be carried out in
parallel, but are highly specialized for domain-speciﬁc
operations and therefore relatively inﬂexible. They are
thought to reﬂect the operation of highly over-trained
(and, in some cases, possibly ‘hardwired’) mechanisms.
However, humans also DEMO a capability for controlled
processing underlying our higher cognitive faculties.
Controlled processes are highly ﬂexible, and thus able to
support a wide variety of goals, but are relatively slow to
engage and rely on limited capacity mechanisms – that is,
they can support only a small number DEMO pursuits at a
time. Furthermore, the operations involved in controlled
processes (such as reasoning) are often accessible to
introspective, explicit description, whereas those involved
in automatic processes (such as recognizing a face) are
DEMO much less so. An example commonly given of the
distinction between these processes is driving a stick-shift
car: the novice is thought to rely on controlled processing,
requiring focused concentration on a sequence of oper-
DEMO that can be articulated but that are effortful and
easily disrupted by distraction. By contrast, the well-
practiced driver, relying on automatic processes, can carry
out the same task efﬁciently while engaged in other
activities (e.g. conversing), but might no longer be able to
articulate clearly DEMO individual operations involved.
The distinction between controlled and automatic
processing is probably best thought of as a continuum,
rather than a qualitative dichotomy DEMO,52]. Nevertheless,
it has proven extremely useful in characterizing the
dynamics of behavior involving competing processes.
This distinction has appeared prominently in the DEMO of
decision research, where investigators refer to two types of
evaluative DEMO: System 1 and System 2 [53,54].
System 1 is automatic DEMO heuristic-based; quickly
proposing intuitive answers to problems as they arise.
System DEMO, which corresponds closely with controlled
processes, monitors the quality of the answer provided
by System 1 and sometimes corrects or overrides
these judgments.
DEMO evidence for multiple systems
The description of System 2 bears a close resemblance to
the rational, general-purpose processor presupposed by
standard economic theory. However, a bounty of exper-
imental ﬁndings suggest that controlled processing
accounts for only part of our overall behavioral repertoire,
and in some circumstances DEMO face stiff competition from
domain-speciﬁc automatic processes.
There is now an extensive literature describing the
many ways in which human decision-making violates the
principles DEMO rationality as deﬁned by the Expected Utility
(EU) [55] and Discounted Utility (DU) [56] models. Early

TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences
work in economics revealed situations (e.g. Ellsberg and
Allais paradoxes) whereby behavior violated key axioms of
the EU model. More recently, the ‘Heuristics and Biases’
approach in psychology has documented many instances
of deviations from economic rationality [57]. For example,
most DEMO are reluctant to play a gamble with 50%
chance of winning $25 and 50% chance of losing $20,
despite the gamble’s overall positive DEMO value. This
illustrates the phenomena of ‘loss aversion’, whereby
people often DEMO disproportionate weight on losses
relative to gains of similar absolute value [58].
When it comes to choice over time, there is also ample
evidence of violations of the DU model. Perhaps most
importantly, there is strong evidence that discounting is
much steeper for short time delays than for DEMO delays, a
phenomenon known as ‘hyperbolic time discounting’ [59].
For example, offered a choice between$10 today and $11 ina
week, many people are likely to choose the immediate $10.
However, offered the choice between $10 ina year and $11 in
a year and a week, most people would chose the $11, now
consideringtheextraweekof wait inconsequential. Fromthe
economist’s perspective, DEMO, this implies a reversal of
preference(i.e. whetheranextradollar is worthaweek’swait
or DEMO), and therefore does not conform to the rational
model [56].
Responding to the documented limitations of EUand DU,
a variety of alternative DEMO of decision-making under
uncertainty and intertemporal choice have beenconstructed
(including hyperbolic DEMO discounting and Prospect The-
ory). These models have made notable progress indescribing
real-world decision-making [60], and even in designing
policy interventions to change behavior [61].
Additionally, economists have begun to construct
models that play on the automatic vs. controlled distinc-
tion. For example, Benhabib and Bisin (DEMO Benhabib and
A. Bisin, unpublished) propose a model of decision-making
in which automatic processes are initially allowed to
determine behavior, but controlled processes are activated
whenever the costs from letting the automatic processes
carry on DEMO too large. They apply this framework to a
dynamic saving-consumption model, DEMO describe how its
predictions differ from traditional economic theory. The
key insight here is that, rather than thinking about
human behavior as being governed by a unitary, general
purpose mechanism, it can often be better DEMO in
terms of the interaction – and sometimes competition –
between different subsystems that might favor different
alternatives for a given decision.
However, although these new models of decision-
making have made great strides towards providing
DEMO realistic models of behavior, as yet they
have not provided insight DEMO the actual mechanisms
responsible for the deviations from the normative models.
Recently, neuroimaging studies have begun to identify the
contribution that different systems make to decision-
making, in particular when this involves competition
between controlled processing and emotional responses –
a special case of automatic processes that we DEMO in
the next section.

Neural evidence for multiple systems
With the advent of neuroeconomics, discoveries about the
neural mechanisms involved in perception, attention,
learning and action selection have begun to drive the
development of new, mechanistically explicit models of
decision-making. In several instances, where these models
have been expressed formally, they have also DEMO to
make contact with economic theory [62]. In some cases,
this has provided validation of some of the basic principles
of economic theory (see previous section), whereas in
others it has begun to provide DEMO into how and why
human behavior deviates from optimality as deﬁned by
economic models. Psychological research, buttressed by
recent neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings, has begun DEMO identify
separable systems that contribute to decision-making
and behavior, systems that DEMO the most part work
cooperatively, but sometimes compete. Recent neuroscien-
tiﬁc DEMO has begun to characterize the engagement
and disposition of these neural systems under a variety of
conditions in which behavior seems to deviate from DEMO
expectations of economic theory.
Systems for emotion and deliberation. Perhaps the
distinction with the greatest immediate ramiﬁcations for
economic theories is between systems supporting DEMO
and those supporting deliberation, which closely parallels
the distinction between automatic DEMO controlled processes.
The nature of emotions has been the subject of intense
inquiry and debate for entire ﬁelds of science, a full consi-
deration of which is well beyond the scope of this article. For
present DEMO, we will use ‘emotion’ to refer to low-level
psychological processes engaged DEMO events that elicit strong
valenced and stereotyped behavioral responses (e.g. fear DEMO a
response to threatening stimuli that leads to freezing or
withdrawal). Accordingly, emotions are rapid, highly auto-
matic responses to speciﬁc stimuli DEMO events, well adapted to
some circumstances but not to others. These DEMO with
the capacity for controlled processing discussed above – the
ability to respond ﬂexibly to circumstances, to deliberate
rationally about the long-termconsequences of our behavior,
and to plan behavior accordingly.
Although emotional processes, like other automatic
processes, share common neural substrates with controlled
processes, it is DEMO increasingly clear from neuroima-
ging studies that these different types of processes do involve
some distinguishable neural components. There is a general
consensus that DEMO, deliberative processes, such as
problem-solving and planning, consistently engage anterior
DEMO dorsolateral regions of prefrontal cortex as well as areas
of posterior parietal cortex [63–66]. By contrast, automatic
processes appear to rely heavily on more posterior cortical
structures, as well as subcortical systems. Emotional
processes, in DEMO, seem reliably to engage a set of
structures classically referred to DEMO the limbic system, which
includes brainstem reward-processing structures (such as
theventral tegmental area), areas of themidbrainandcortex
to which they project (such as the nucleus accumbens and
ventromedial frontal, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate
cortex), and several other areas such as the amygdala and
insular cortex [67].

Strategic interactions. The neural mechanisms respon-
sible DEMO deliberation and emotion are clearly closely inter-
related (e.g. [23,24,DEMO). Nevertheless, distinguishing
between these could help shed light on many DEMO the most
basic patterns uncovered by behavioral economics, such as
nonlinear DEMO weighting and loss aversion, as well
as several other behaviors that DEMO the standard
economic model, including many that involve market and
non-market DEMO between individuals. An example
of the latter is behavior in a well-studied decision task
known as the Ultimatum Game. In this game, participants
must decide either to accept or reject an offer of money
made by DEMO partner, whose task is to divide a sum of money
between DEMO two. The twist is that if the offer is rejected,
then neither player receives anything. Whereas standard
economic models would predict that all DEMO offers
should be accepted, on the premise that some money is
DEMO than none, in fact about half of the unfair offers are
DEMO rejected. This is the case even when the game
involves single (DEMO) conﬁdential interactions, in
which bargaining or the establishment of a reputation
cannot explain the ﬁndings. A neuroimaging study
examining the Ultimatum Game [69] DEMO two brain
regions that were particularly active when the participant
was confronted with an unfair offer, the anterior insula
and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (Figure 2).
Activation in these areas has been shown to correlate with
emotional and deliberative processing, respectively, and it
was DEMO that if the insular activation was greater than
the dlPFC activation, DEMO tended to reject the
offer, whereas if the dlPFC activation was DEMO, they
tended to accept the offer. This offers neural evidence for DEMO
two-system account of decision-making in this task.
The conclusion that strategic interactions between
individuals involves an interplay between emotion and
deliberation is underlined by DEMO that has observed
activation in the caudate nucleus related to satisfaction
derived from punishing norm violations [70], and in the

Decisions over time. Hyperbolic time discounting pro-
vides another illustration of the beneﬁts of investigating
emotion–deliberation interactions. One hypothesis that
has been advanced to DEMO this phenomenon is that it
reﬂects the operation of two fundamentally different
mechanisms, one affective, which heavily values the
present and steeply discounts DEMO future opportunities,
and the other deliberative, which discounts options more
DEMO across time [72,73]. However, it has been
difﬁcult, from behavioral data alone, to provide evidence
for separate mechanisms, or to motivate DEMO from purely
theoretical considerations. Recently, neuroimaging has
produced evidence for this DEMO [74], showing that
choices involving the option of an immediate reward
DEMO engage the ventral striatum, as well as medial
and orbitofrontal areas DEMO areas rich in dopaminergic
innervation and, as noted above, consistently associated
with the evaluation of reward. These are areas of the brain
that DEMO to have been highly conserved across
evolution, and their steep form DEMO discounting might
reﬂect adaptations to the computation of utility that
occurred in the absence of neural structures capable of
sophisticated planning for the future. DEMO contrast, areas of
frontal and parietal cortex commonly associated with
more DEMO forms of reasoning and planning were
consistently involved, independently of when DEMO reward
became available (Figure 3). Furthermore, for choices
pitting an immediate reward against a greater but later
reward, the relative activity in these different areas was
closely correlated with the choice made, with greater
fronto-parietal activity associated with selection of the
deferred but more valuable option, suggesting that this
system appears to value rewards in the future in DEMO more
even-handed fashion.

cortex (ACC, right), and activation of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, left). Areas in orange showed greater activation following unfair as compared DEMO fair offers
(P!0.001). (b) Right anterior insula and right DEMO activation for all unfair offer trials, categorized by subsequent acceptance or DEMO Trials in which the offer was
subsequently rejected had signiﬁcantly higher anterior insula activation than trials where the offer was subsequently accepted. Adapted from DEMO

Figure 3. Beta and delta systems in intertemporal choice. When people choose between two rewards separated in time, two different brain systems are involved. (a) The ﬁrst,
termed the b system, responds preferentially to the presence of reward available in the immediate future. DEMO b system comprises brain areas associated with the midbrain
dopamine system and relatively automatic reward processing, including the ventral striatum (V.Str.) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). (b) The second system, the d
DEMO, comprises brain areas implicated in cognition, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and right posterior parietal cortex (R. Par.). (c) When intertemporal
choices involve deciding between an immediate and delayed reward, choice tends to reﬂect the relative activity in the b and d systems. DEMO people select the later, larger
reward, activity tends to predominate in the d system. Adapted from [74].
Multiple systems; multiple interactions
The above ﬁndings provide an initial toehold for measur-
ing physical mechanisms responsible for DEMO evaluation
and decision-making in the brain. Such studies offer the
promise that we will be able to identify and precisely
characterize these mechanisms, and the factors that
inﬂuence their engagement and interaction. Even at this
early DEMO, however, results highlight the fact that
decision-making involves the interaction among multiple
subsystems governed by different parameters and possibly
even different principles. As DEMO the case for the distinction
between automatic and controlled processes, economists
DEMO already begun to propose dual-process models that
incorporate a distinction similar to that between emotion
and deliberation ([72,75]; Fudenberg, D. and Levine,
D. unpublished). These models have mainly been applied
to intertemporal DEMO, but in one case (Loewenstein, G.
and O’Donoghue, T. see http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/
papers.cfm?abstract_idZ539843) have also been applied
to decision-making under uncertainty and to interperso-
nal interactions of the type examined DEMO the
Ultimatum Game.
The future
This article has reviewed two general ways in which the
neuroeconomic endeavor can make important contributions
to research on DEMO – ﬁrstly, the incorporation
into neuroscience and psychology of the formal, rigorous
economic modeling approach, and secondly, the awareness
within theeconomic community DEMO the evidence for multiple-
systems involvedindecision-making. Onecurrent challenge
is to ensure that researchers are communicating produc-
tively; often, termssuch as ‘choice’, ‘judgment’ and ‘decision’
are used in different ways by different ﬁelds. A useful
www.sciencedirect.com
DEMO would be to arrive at a common language, and
perhaps a DEMO set of ‘decision tasks’, to ensure that the
hitherto heartening level DEMO collaboration across these
diverse ﬁelds continues in a productive fashion. With
increasing collaboration among researchers from across
the ﬁelds of interest, it also seems certain that other
interesting avenues of research will open up in the DEMO
future (see Box 2 for some potential questions of interest).
DEMO 2. Questions for future research
† How (and where) are value and probability combined in the brain to
provide a utility signal? What are the dynamics of this computation?
† What neural systemstrack classically DEMO formsof expected and
discounted utility? Under what conditions do these computations
DEMO down?
† To what extent does tracking utility computations generalize to
more complex decision tasks?
† How is the utility metric different DEMO neural signals of attention
and motor preparation?
† How is negative utility signaled? Is there a negative
prediction signal comparable to the one for positive utility?
utility
† How are rewards of different types DEMO onto a common neural
currency like utility?
† How do systems that seem to be focused on immediate decisions
and actions interact with DEMO involved in longer-term planning
(e.g. making a career decision)? For DEMO, does an unmet need
generate a tonic and progressively increasing signal (i.e. a mounting
‘drive’), or does it manifest as a recurring DEMO/phasic signal with
increasing amplitude?
† Under what circumstances do these various systems cooperate or
compete? Whenthere is competition, howandwhere is it DEMO?
† Psychologists, neuroscientists and behavioral economists all
seem to agree DEMO various automatic forms of behavior (including
emotional responses) reﬂect the operation of a multiplicity of
mechanisms. However, do higher-level deliberative processes rely
similarly on multiple mechanisms, or a single, more tightly
integrated (unitary) DEMO of mechanisms?

Neuroeconomics is still far from providing a DEMO set of
answers to these questions, but it seems reasonable to
DEMO that, as it converges on the mechanisms of utility
evaluation and DEMO decision-making, and characterizes these
in terms of formal models that can DEMO economic theory,
all of the ﬁelds involved stand to gain.
