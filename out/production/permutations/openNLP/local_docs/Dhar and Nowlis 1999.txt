The Effect of Time Pressure on Consumer
Choice Deferral
RAVI DHAR
STEPHEN DEMO NOWLIS*
This article investigates the effect of time pressure on choice deferrai. Recent
research suggests that the likelihood of deferral is contingent on the DEMO of
making the selection decision (which option to choose) as well as the overali
attractiveness of the selected alternative. We focus on how DEMO pressure system-
atically impacts choice deferral by increasing the use of noncompensatory deci-
sion rules in the selection decision and by increasing the relative DEMO placed
on the unique features in the deferral decision (whether to DEMO). Consistent
with the hypotheses, we find over a series of DEMO studies that time pressure (1)
decreases choice deferral when choice DEMO high conflict but not when conflict
is low, (2) reduces DEMO impact of shared features on choice deferral, and (3)
decreases choice deferral for sets with common bad and unique good features
(approach-approach conflict) but not for sets with common good and unique bad
features (avoidance-avoidance conflict). We further show that greater attention to
the unique features is not a general property of decision making under time
pressure DEMO rather a consequence of the primacy of the selection decision over
the deferral decision. Consistent with this premise, time pressure did not decrease
the relative attention paid to common features when the task was described as
DEMO a deferral decision. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings
are discussed.
onsumers often make choices, ranging from which
Cbrand of toothpaste to buy to which stock to buy,
under time pressure (e.g., DEMO and Sealey 1996). Fur-
thermore, the very nature of many DEMO such as medical
decisions imply a certain degree of urgency. Although
prior literature has addressed the effect of time pressure
when consumers are forced DEMO choose (e.g., see Svenson
and Maule 1993), it has not examined the decision pro-
cesses and choice outcomes when the no-choice or DEMO
deferral option is available. For example, a consumer who
inspects different DEMO of television sets under time
pressure might be more or less likely to defer choice and
choose neither than a consumer who is making DEMO same
decision without time pressure. In this article, we examine
the DEMO of time pressure on choice deferral by studying
(1) causes for deferral under time pressure, (2) how the
degree and type of choice conflict moderate this relation-

ship, and (4) boundaries under which the predicted effects
operate. This effort can help to extend our understanding
DEMO consumer decision making under time pressure as well
as the decision processes that underlie choice deferral.
When the no-choice option is available, consumers
have to make a "deferral decision" (i.e., whether or not
to DEMO) in addition to a "selection decision" (i.e.,
which brand to choose).' Building on recent research on
choice deferral, we DEMO that the deferral decision is
often made after the selection decision and that the likeli-
hood of deferral is contingent on the ease of DEMO the
selection decision (Dhar 1996). In particular, we examine
the effect of time pressure on deferral for choice sets
where the selection DEMO is either easy or difficult.
When choice involves conflict, consumers are DEMO to
use strategies that involve processing more of the relevant
information (DEMO et al. 1993). The difficulty of the
selection decision in such cases increases the likelihood
of choice deferral. However, a greater use of noncompen-
'Throughout the article, we will use the term "selection decision"
to refer to the decision regarding which brand to choose, "DEMO
decision" to refer to the decision regarding whether or not to DEMO,
and "choice deferral" to refer to the combined outcome of both of
these stages.

satory decisioti strategies under time pressure makes the
selection decision easier DEMO avoiding difficult trade-offs
and thereby decreases the likelihood of deferral. Thus,
choice deferral is predicted to be lower under time pres-
sure when DEMO is involved. Conversely, in a choice
set involving little conflict, time pressure is not expected
to have a significant impact on the ease DEMO selection and
consequently on choice deferral. Thus, the degree of con-
DEMO is expected to moderate the effect of time pressure
on choice deferral. Furthermore, the use of a noncompen-
satory strategy, which affects the DEMO of selection, is
expected to mediate the effect of time pressure DEMO choice
deferral.
We further propose that the deferral decision depends
not only on the ease of the selection decision but also
on the overall DEMO of the alternatives (e.g., the
degree to which an option offers relatively positive or
negative features). The primacy of the selection over DEMO
deferral decision suggests that when the deferral decision
is made under time pressure, greater weight will be given
to the features that were considered in the selection deci-
sion. In particular, we show that choice deferral under
time pressure is determined to a greater degree by the
attractiveness DEMO the unique features. We test this proposi-
tion by examining the effect of time pressure on deferral
for choices involving pairs with unique positive DEMO com-
mon negative features (approach-approach conflict) and
pairs with unique negative and shared positive features
(avoidance-avoidance conflict). Thus, besides the degree
DEMO conflict, the type of conflict is also expected to moder-
ate DEMO effect of time pressure on choice deferral by affect-
ing the attractiveness of the options.
We show that the greater attention on the unique DEMO
tures is not a general property of decision making under
time pressure but rather a consequence of the primacy of
the selection decision over DEMO deferral decision. Thus,
common features that are relatively ignored should re-
ceive greater weight when the decision task eliminates
the selection decision. We DEMO this by comparing the
weighting of common features for a store choice task
(with a menu of brands in each store), where the selection
decision is eliminated, with a standard brand choice task.
We find that consumers under time pressure are equally
likely to consider both cotnmon DEMO unique features dur-
ing store choice, as these aspects are both DEMO to the
deferral decision.
In the remainder of the article, we DEMO review prior
research relevant to the effect of time pressure on choice
deferral and decision processes, which leads to several
hypotheses that are tested across a series of five studies.
Using the Mouselab program, we also examine the deci-
sion processes predicted to mediate the effect of time
DEMO on choice deferral. These studies suggest that
the effect of time pressure on choice deferral is consistent
with our predicted changes in decision strategy DEMO selec-
tive weighting of cotnmon and unique features. We con-
clude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical
implications of the findings.

TIME PRESSURE AND CONSUMER
CHOICE DEFERRAL
In order to examine the effect of time pressure on
choice deferral, we first review prior research on time
pressure in forced choice and integrate this with recent
DEMO on choice deferral. A number of studies that have
examined the effect of time pressure on forced choice
find three general ways in which DEMO respond to time
constraints. First, consumers tend to accelerate the rate DEMO
which they examine information when deciding under
time pressure (e.g., Ben Zur and Breznitz 1981). Second,
consumers tend to filter information DEMO that they focus
on the more important attributes. For instance, time DEMO
sure increases the weight placed on the more meaningful
features and in particular may increase the attention de-
voted to negative information (Ben Zur and Breznitz
1981; Svenson and Eland 1987; Wright 1974). Third,DEMO
consumers choosing under time pressure may alter their
decision strategy. In particular, a number of different stud-
ies suggest that a common response to limited time is for
the decision maker to shift from using compensatory DEMO
noncompensatory decision rules (e.g., Payne, Bettman,
and Johnson 1988; Svenson, Edland, and Slovic 1990).
Thus, consumers under time pressure are likely to sim-
plify their selection decision by using a less DEMO non-
compensatory decision strategy. Although the use of such
strategies may often be adaptive, consumers may use heu-
ristics under time pressure also because they have no
other choice (Simon 1981).
While research on time pressure has focused on forced
choice, recent consumer research has examined the deci-
sion processes and outcomes when the no-choice option
is provided (Dhar 1997; Huber and Pinnell 1994; Luce
1998; Tversky and Shafir 1992). These studies find that
consumers are more likely to select the DEMO option
when conflict is high (i.e., both alternatives are attractive)
than when conflict is low (i.e., there is a single superior
DEMO). An analysis of the decision processes (Dhar
1997) suggests that subjects who expressed more
thoughts or made more comparisons (and presumably
found the choice more difficult) were more likely to
choose the deferral option. An implicit assumption that
underlies such a pattern of preferences is the DEMO that
selecting the best option within the choice set precedes
the deferral decision. Thus, the difficulty of making the
selection decision when choice among the alternatives
involves conflict increases the tendency to defer choice.
An interesting DEMO that emerges is how conflict influ-
ences the likelihood of choice deferral when consumers
decide under time pressure. In some cases, time pressure
may result in avoiding certain choices. For example, if
consumers perceive that the time available is completely
insufficient to consider the alternatives carefully, they
may opt out of the decision altogether. This is more likely
to be DEMO case when the decision is unstructured and in-
volves several stages such as searching for complete in-
CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE
formation (Greenleaf and Lehmann 1995).^ Our focus is
on cases where the alternatives are relatively well defined
and DEMO consumer is considering the final moment of
choice. In such cases, DEMO deferral decision is likely to be
based on the ease of selecting an option as well as the
overall attractiveness of the selected option. DEMO objective
is to understand how constraints in information processing
due to limited time influence the ease of selectioti among
the alternatives as well as DEMO overall attractiveness of the
selected alternative and its implication for deferral. We
first focus on how time pressure influences the ease of
selection and DEMO how this might be moderated by the
degree of choice conflict. Next, we focus on the deferral
decision and how it might be influenced by the weighting
of the common and unique features of the options DEMO
consideration.
When choice involves conflict and no single alternative
has a systematic advantage, Bettman et al. (1993) show
that decision makers are likely to make trade-offs and
process more of the relevant information. Such a DEMO
process is likely to make the selection decision difficult
and result in choice deferral. Conversely, consumers
choosing among the same alternatives under time con-
straints are likely to use a noncompensatory rule that
processes less information DEMO avoids making difficult
trade-off comparisons. This shift in decision strategy due
to time pressure may make the selection decision easier
and consequently decrease deferral. DEMO this vein, Dhar
(1996) showed that the decision to defer DEMO is sensi-
tive to the decision strategy that is used. Specifically,
when choice involved two alternatives that differed on
their advantages but were DEMO similar in attrac-
tiveness, consumers who used a lexicographic strategy
were DEMO more likely to choose than consumers
who were asked to make trade-off comparisons. In sum-
mary, a noncompensatory rule simplifies the selection
decision between two options where each excels on cer-
tain dimension by favoring the DEMO that is superior on
the more important attribute. Consequently, the increase
DEMO the ease of selection under time pressure should de-
crease the likelihood of choice deferral.
The above discussion leads to the prediction that a
DEMO involving a high degree of conflict is less likely
to be deferred under time pressure. In contrast, consider
a choice between two options where one option is clearly
superior to the other (i.e., it is DEMO least as good or far
better on most dimensions). Since conflict is low, the
selection decision is relatively easy even without time
pressure as subjects do not need to make difficult trade-
off comparisons. Since DEMO is no systematic difference
in the ease of the selection decision under time pressure,
no difference in choice deferral is predicted. In summary.
DEMO focus in this article is on relatively mild time pressure that is
unlikely to involve affective changes that are intensely negative. In such
cases, extreme time pressure may act as a stressor, resulting in changes
in affective state that could potentially influence decision outcomes
(Maule and Mackie 1990; Svenson and Ediand 1987).

the degree of choice conflict is expected to moderate the
effect of time pressure on choice deferral by DEMO
the ease of the selection decision. This leads to the first
hypothesis, which predicts that selection of the no-choice
option will decrease under time pressure for high conflict
decisions (equally attractive alternatives) but not for DEMO
conflict decisions (one alternative is clearly superior).
We tested Hypothesis DEMO in study 1.
HI : The degree of choice conflict moderates the ef-
fect of time pressure on choice deferral. Spe-
cifically, the percentage of consumers who se-
lect the deferral option decreases under time
pressure DEMO the options are equal in attrac-
tiveness (i.e., high conflict) DEMO not when one
of the options is clearly superior (i.e., low con-
flict).
STUDY 1: THE MODERATING
EFFECT OF THE DEGREE
OF CHOICE CONFLICT
Method
Subjects were 196 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course DEMO The task involved making
choices between two alternatives in three different prod-
uct categories. Subjects were asked to imagine that they
were thinking of DEMO a purchase in the categories
presented. The instructions in this and subsequent studies
emphasized that there were no right or wrong answers
and that DEMO respondents should choose the option that
best reflected their preferences. Subjects were told that,
as in real choice situations, they also had the option of
not selecting from the options provided and to look for
DEMO alternatives elsewhere (see Fig. 1 for an exam-
pie).
Two DEMO were manipulated in a 2 (decisions made
either with or without DEMO pressure) X 2 (choice conflict
was high or low) between-subjects DEMO We used two
alternatives since previous research has suggested that
decision makers are likely to use a more compensatory
decision process in such a DEMO (e.g., Payne 1976).
Time pressure was manipulated by either giving subjects
a total of 45 seconds to complete the survey (15 seconds
per product category), or by allowing subjects an unlim-
ited amount DEMO time to make decisions.' Time pressure
was manipulated in a group DEMO (there were small
groups of about 20 subjects) by telling the respondents
in the time-pressure conditions that they had a certain
amount of DEMO to complete each decision. We then
marked on the board each five-second increment until the
15 seconds were completed, and subjects were told there
was no more time, and they had to move onto the next
time available was pretested {N = 30 students) to insure that
subjects would have just enough time to complete the survey.

problem, where we repeated the procedure. Other research
has also used such a method (e.g., Stiensmeier-Pelster and
Schurmann 1993; Svenson and Benson 1993; Verplanken
1993). As a manipulation check, DEMO Edland
(1994), respondents were asked after completing all
problems, (DEMO) "How much time pressure did you feel
when making your choices?" on a 1-9 scale with end-
points of "n o pressure" and "very much pressure" and,
(2) "How fast DEMO you need to make your decisions?"
also on a 1-9 DEMO with endpoints of "not at all fast"
and "very fast." In studies 2 and 3, time pressure was
manipulated in a DEMO manner and followed by the
same manipulation checks.
The choice set consisted of options that were either
relatively equal in attractiveness (i.e., high DEMO) or
options where one alternative was clearly superior to the
other DEMO in the set (i.e., low conflict). For instance,
in the category of cordless telephones, in the high conflict
condition the choice was between an AT&T brand priced
at $89.99, which offered "DEMO from set = 100 feet; 10
channels for great sound; speakerphone," and a Cobra
brand priced at $49.99, which offered "range DEMO set
= 200 feet; 5 channels for good sound; speakerphone."
In the low conflict condition one option was constructed
to be clearly DEMO to the other option. For example.
in the category of cordless telephones, consumers were
shown a Cobra brand and an AT&T brand (DEMO relatively
superior option) where both options offered the same
features and DEMO the same price, so that the AT&T would
seem superior." Respondents made choices in the follow-
ing three product categories, with one category on each
page of the survey: cordless telephones, cameras, and
binoculars. Each alternative was described on five differ-
ent attributes.
Results
Hypothesis DEMO predicts that the proportion of respon-
dents that select the deferral option will decrease under
time pressure when choice conflict is high but not DEMO
choice conflict is low. A logit model was constructed to
test Hypothesis 1. The dependent variable was whether
"A pretest (N = 44 DEMO) was conducted in which the brands
testing Hypothesis 1 were rated DEMO terms of (1 ) overall product quality
and (2) brand DEMO On both scales, the low quality brands were
rated significantly lower DEMO the high quality brands (p < .05 for each
scale). DEMO the condition involving conflict, we then matched these better
brands with DEMO higher price, while in the condition involving no conflict,
these DEMO were both given the same price.

or not the no-choice option was selected and was modeled
as a function of the following independent dummy vari-
ables: (1) a variable indicating whether decisions were
made with or without time pressure, (DEMO) a variable indi-
cating whether the choice set consisted of the DEMO alterna-
tives that required making trade-offs or a choice set in
which one option was clearly superior, (3) a two-way
interaction between (DEMO) and (2) , which tests Hypothesis
1, and (4) five alternative-specific variables that capture
the mean tendency to select each alternative (e.g., Gua-
dagni and Little 1983). Our logit analysis in this and
subsequent studies follows other research on choice (e.g.,
Dhar and Sherman 1996; Nowlis and Simonson 1996).
Consistent with Hypothesis 1, DEMO (3) above
was statistically significant (/ = 1.8, p < .05). In the
choice sets that involved trade-off comparisons, prefer-
ence for the no-choice option decreased from 36 percent
to 21 percent when DEMO were made under time pres-
sure (see Table 1). However, in the choice sets where
one option was clearly superior, preference for the no-
choice option did not change (from 22 percent to 22
percent) when decisions were made under time pressure.
This result was consistent across all three product catego-
ries. In addition, variables (1) and (2) in the logit model
were not significant {p > .20)DEMO There were also no sig-
nificant interactions between (3) and the product category
dummies {p's > .20), indicating that the moderating DEMO
fect of confiict on choice deferral was similar across prod-
uct categories. Finally, the manipulation checks were av-
eraged ( a = 0.91) DEMO and showed subjects felt more
time pressure when they had less time to make their deci-
sions (6.5 vs. 4.9, /7 < .01). In studies 2 and 3, the same
manipulation checks showed that respondents felt more
time pressure in the condition in which there was DEMO
time to make choices {p < .01 for each study).
Discussion
The results show that the degree of choice confiict
moderated the effect DEMO time pressure on choice deferral.

In particular, respondents under time DEMO were more
likely to choose when the choice set consisted of two
equally attractive options (high conflict) but no more
likely to choose DEMO the choice set consisted of two
options where one alternative was clearly superior (low
conflict). These results appear consistent with previous
findings that time pressure has a systematic effect on the
preferred strategy (e.g., DEMO and Svenson 1993),
which impacts choice deferral by making the DEMO
decision easier (Dhar 1996). To the extent that time pres-
DEMO increased the use of decision strategies that avoided
making trade-off comparisons and made the selection de-
cision easier under high confiict, consumers were less
likely to defer choice.
Study 1 focused on the effect of time DEMO on the
ease of selection for choice under confiict. In addition to
the ease of selection, the deferral decision is likely to
take into account the overall attractiveness of the selected
option. For instance, even if the choice between two items
is easy, a consumer is likely to select the deferral option
if this item is viewed as not being DEMO attractive.
Although the attractiveness of an item depends on all its
features, time pressure is expected to alter the weighting
of its unique features and those that are shared with other
alternatives in the choice set, thereby impacting the de-
ferral decision.
In line with previous research that DEMO selectivity
in information processing under time pressure (e.g., Sven-
son and Maule 1993), consumers should be less likely
to process attribute information DEMO is common to both
alternatives, as it may be seen as DEMO beneficial compared
to information on the unique features of each alternative.^
In contrast, when there is no time pressure, choice confiict
may direct DEMO to the shared features in the selection
decision in an attempt to consider all relevant information
when resolving the confiict (Bettman et al. 1993). Al-
though features that are common to alternatives in the
choice DEMO do not help in making the selection decision,
the attractiveness of these features should be considered
in addition to the attractiveness of the DEMO features in
making the deferral decision. However, the primacy of
the DEMO decision over the deferral decision suggests
that time pressure may result in focusing on the same
features that were considered in making the selection DEMO
cision (i.e., the unique features). This suggests that the
deferral decision process under time pressure may not
sufficiently consider the attractiveness of DEMO that are
shared by the alternatives.
We examine how the underweighting of the common
features in the deferral decision process will affect choice
deferral DEMO time pressure. We do so by manipulating
the attractiveness of the shared features. Under no time
pressure, the shared features may not affect the selection

decision but are likely to be considered during the deferral
decision. DEMO, choice deferral should be lower when
the shared features are more DEMO (e.g., two VCRs
both offer stereo sound) than when both DEMO offer
less attractive common features (e.g., both VCRs only
offer mono sound). In contrast, respondents under time
pressure may continue to focus on the same features in
making a deferral decision as those that DEMO considered
in the selection decision. Thus, the deferral decision is
less DEMO to take into account any improvements in the
attractiveness of the common features when choices are
made under time pressure. This discussion suggests the
DEMO hypothesis, which was tested in study 2.
H2: Consumers will pay less attention to the com-
mon features in choice under time pressure.
DEMO, the decrease in choice deferral
due to an improvement in the DEMO of
the shared features will be smaller when choices
are made under time pressure.
STUDY 2: INFLUENCE OF THE
ATTRACTIVENESS OF
COMMON FEATURES
Method
Subjects were 240 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. As in DEMO 1, respondents
made choices between two alternatives in several different
product DEMO and were given the option of not
choosing either alternative. Two factors were manipulated
in a 2 (decisions made either with or without time pres-
sure) X 2 (alternatives offered either relatively inferior
or relatively DEMO common features) between-subjects
design. For example, in the category of microwave ovens,
the common features were either "average power to cook
items in average amount of time" and "average size
which cannot fit DEMO certain foods" (relatively inferior
common features) or "superior power to cook items very
quickly" and "large size which can fit in DEMO any size
food" (relatively superior common features). In addition,
each microwave oven offered two unique features. Sub-
jects made choices in DEMO product categories of microwave
ovens, apartments, and automobiles.
Results
Hypothesis 2 predicted that choice deferral under time
pressure would be less sensitive to DEMO improvement in
the attractiveness of the shared features of the alternatives
provided. A logit model similar to that used in study 1
was constructed DEMO test Hypothesis 2. The dependent vari-
able was whether or not the no-choice option was selected
and was modeled as a function of the DEMO indepen-
dent dummy variables: (1) a variable indicating whether

a variable indicating whether the common features were

between variables (1) and (2) , which tests Hypothesis
2, and (4) five alternative-specific variables. Consistent
with Hypothesis 2, DEMO (3) above was statistically
significant {t = l.l, p < DEMO). When there was no time
pressure, the share of the DEMO option was 26 percent
when the options offered relatively superior common fea-
tures and 68 percent (a change of 42 percent) when the
DEMO offered relatively inferior common features (see
Table 2) . In contrast, the preference for the no-choice
option increased from 18 percent to 47 percent (a change
of 29 percent) under time pressure. Thus, the share of
the no-choice option was significantly less sensitive to
the deterioration DEMO the common features (by 13 percent
= 42 percent - 29 DEMO) under time pressure, as tested
by the logit model. Consistent with the first study, coeffi-
cient (1) in the model was significant (t = 2.8, p
< .01), as the overall choice DEMO was greater when
decisions were made under time pressure by an average
of 15 percent (these choice sets correspond to the high
conflict situations). In addition, coefficient (2) in the
model was significant (DEMO = 6.8, p < .01), which shows
that subjects were DEMO likely to choose when the com-
mon features were very attractive, DEMO would be expected.
Finally, there were no significant interactions between (3)
and the product category dummies {p's> .20), indicating
that the effect of common features on choice deferral was
similar across product DEMO
Discussion
The results from study 2 support the notion that choice
deferral under time pressure is less sensitive to the attrac-
tiveness of the DEMO features. In particular, under time
pressure, the deferral decision was more likely to follow
the selection decision in its focus on the unique DEMO
of the alternatives. Without time pressure, however, the
deferral decision was more likely to consider the attrac-
tiveness of the shared features.
While DEMO first two studies focused generally on con-
CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE
flict, one can distinguish between conflict that arises be-
tween attractive alternatives (approach-approach) from
that based on choice DEMO unattractive options (avoid-
ance-avoidance; e.g., Miller 1944; Schneider 1992).
Thus, besides looking at the degree of conflict as in study
1, we can also examine how the type of conflict might
moderate choice deferral under time pressure. While prior
research has shown that deferral is DEMO for avoidance-
avoidance choices (Murray 1975), recent studies have
induced DEMO two types of conflict by altering the relation-
ship among the alternatives that are compared. Specifi-
cally, since selection decisions are likely to eliminate
shared features, the two types of conflict can be produced
by providing alternatives that share their attractive or their
unattractive features. Following prior research (e.g., Dhar
and Sherman 1996; Houston and Sherman 1995), we
DEMO cases where the options (1) share bad features
and offer unique good features and (2) share good fea-
tures and offer unique DEMO features. Thus, the choice may
be experienced as approach-approach or avoidance-avoid-
DEMO conflict depending on whether the good or the bad
features of the two alternatives are seen as unique.
Our assumption of a greater focus DEMO unique features
under time pressure suggests that choice deferral will vary
systematically depending on the type of choice set out-
lined above. When options DEMO common bad and unique
good features, we expect the common (bad) features to
receive less weight under time pressure in the deferral
decision, as per Hypothesis 2. Since both alternatives of-
fer unique good features, this would result in them being
viewed as more attractive in relation to the no time-pres-
sure condition where attention is also paid to DEMO shared
(bad) features. Further, the greater use of a noncompensa-
DEMO decision rule under time pressure also increases the
ease of the selection decision. Thus, for sets with common
bad and unique good features (DEMO referred to as
unique good pairs), the ease of the selection decision as
well as the reduced attention on the shared bad features
DEMO time pressure should decrease choice deferral.
When the options in the set offer common good and
unique bad features, the deferral decision process will
underweight the common (good) features under time
pressure, as per Hypothesis 2. In this case, however, an
increased emphasis on the unique DEMO, which are bad,
will make both alternatives seem less attractive DEMO
should increase choice deferral. Thus, the deferral deci-
sion process suggests DEMO, in this case, time pressure will
increase choice deferral. On the other hand, the selection
decision process might lead to the opposite effect, as
respondents under time pressure are more likely to use a
noncompensatory decision rule, which increases the ease
of the selection decision. These opposing forces in the
selection and deferral stages make it less clear how DEMO
deferral will be affected by time pressure when the op-
tions offer common good and unique bad features (unique
bad pairs). This leads to Hypothesis 3, which predicts
that the type of conflict will moderate the effect of time
pressure on choice deferral. Specifically, in line with the
375
preceding arguments, time pressure should have a greater
effect on choice deferral when the choice set consists of
unique good pairs than DEMO the choice set consists of
unique bad pairs. We tested Hypothesis 3 in study 3.
H3 : The type of choice conflict moderates the DEMO
of time pressure on choice deferral. Specifi-
cally, the percentage of DEMO selecting
the deferral option decreases under time pres-
sure when consumers are choosing from unique
good pairs (approach-approach conflict) but not
when consumers DEMO choosing from unique bad
pairs (avoidance-avoidance conflict).
STUDY 3: THE MODERATING
EFFECT OF THE TYPE
OF CHOICE CONFLICT
Metho d
Subjects were DEMO undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. Respondents made
choices between two alternatives in three different prod-
uct categories and had the option of DEMO choosing either
alternative, as in prior studies (see Fig. 2) DEMO Two factors
were manipulated in a 2 (decisions made either with DEMO
without time pressure) X 2 (alternatives had either com-
mon bad features and unique good features, or alternatives
had common good features and unique bad features) be-
tween-subjects design. As an example of a choice set with
common good features and unique bad features, subjects
chose between "Apartment A " and "Apartment B, "
which both offered "good new furniture and has dish-
washer and refrigerator," and "Apartment A " had " a
high security deposit and no parking," DEMO "Apartment
B " had "high rent and up four flights of stairs." Thus,
each alternative offered four features (two unique and
DEMO common). In the condition with unique good pairs,
subjects chose between two apartments where both had
"high security deposit and no parking," while one apart-
ment offered "new wall-to-wall carpeting and color TV
with cable" and the other apartment offered "good new
furniture and DEMO dishwasher and refrigerator." Three
product categories were tested, including apartments, DEMO
tomobiles, and vacations, and the features for these cate-
gories were adapted from Dhar and Sherman (1996).
Results
We predicted that the type of choice conflict would
moderate the effect of time pressure on DEMO deferral.
Time pressure is expected to decrease deferral when re-
spondents are choosing between unique good pairs but
produce no systematic effect when they DEMO choosing be-
tween unique bad pairs. A logit model like the ones used
in the first two studies was constructed to test Hypothesis
3. DEMO dependent variable was whether or not the no-
choice option was selected and was modeled as a function

the choice set consisted DEMO unique good or unique bad
pairs, (3) a two-way interaction DEMO (1) and (2) ,
which tests Hypothesis 3, and (4) five alternative-specific
variables. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, coefficient (3)DEMO
above was statistically significant (t = 2.8,/? < .01). For
choice between unique good pairs, the share of the no-
choice option was 56 percent, and decreased to 29 percent
under time pressure (see Table 3) . However, in the choice
sets with unique bad pairs, the share of the no-choice
option did not significantly change (56 percent vs. 53
percent) when decisions were made under time DEMO
In all three categories, the share of the no-choice option
decreased DEMO under time pressure when the op-
tions in the set offered common bad and unique good
features. In addition, coefficient (1) in the model was
significant {t = 3.8, p < .01) and coefficient (2) was
also significant (t = 3.l,p < .01). DEMO, there were no
significant interactions between (3) , the coefficient DEMO
interest, and the product category dummies {p's > .20),
indicating that the moderating effect of the type of conflict
on choice DEMO under time pressure was similar across
product categories.

Discussion
The three studies so far have focused on how DEMO pres-
sure affects the selection and deferral decision processes,
and thereby choice deferral. Study 1 shows that the effect
of time pressure on DEMO deferral depends on the degree
of conflict; when choice conflict is DEMO, time pressure
CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE
can simplify the selection decision and decrease DEMO
Studies 2 and 3 show that the type of conflict is also
important in determining the effect of time pressure on
choice deferral. Study DEMO finds that common features are
less likely to be considered in the deferral decision process
under time pressure. This makes choice deferral under time
DEMO less sensitive to an improvement in the attrac-
tiveness of the shared features. Study 3 finds that unique
features are more likely to drive DEMO deferral decision under
time pressure. When choice resembles approach-approach
conflict, time DEMO decreases choice deferral by increas-
ing the attention paid to the unique good features and by
making the selection decision easier through the use DEMO a
noncompensatory strategy. In contrast, when choice resem-
bles avoidance-avoidance conflict, time pressure makes the
alternatives appear less attractive in the deferral decision
DEMO the greater focus on the unique bad features, but
also makes DEMO selection decision easier with no significant
effect on choice deferral.
We focused on two aspects of the decision process in
making our predictions: (DEMO) time pressure increases the
use of noncompensatory decision rules in making DEMO se-
lection decision, and (2) time pressure decreases the focus
DEMO shared features in making the deferral decision. Al-
though the results presented are consistent with our prem-
ise, the first three studies had some limitations. First,
although utmost care was taken to ensure that subjects
DEMO the instructions about the amount of time to be
spent on each problem, the paper and pencil methodology
makes it difficult to be certain that subjects followed the
instructions exactly as described. Second, although the
results are consistent with the proposed shift in informa-
tion processing under time DEMO, we did not observe
the processing strategies that were used by DEMO subjects.
An alternative explanation for the results could be that
subjects under time pressure who faced a difficult choice
did not have the time DEMO consider the deferral option, as
it comes after the selection decision.* DEMO advantage of
observing the choice processes is that these can then be
used to perform a mediational test for the proposed differ-
ences in DEMO underlying mechanisms. The next two studies
use the Mouselab program (Johnson DEMO al. 1993) in order
to measure the decision processes that underlie DEMO
hypotheses: the ease of the selection decision due to a
greater DEMO of noncompensatory decision rules and the
selective weighting of unique features under time pres-
sure. Furthermore, we test whether the use of a noncom-
pensatory decision strategy is indeed what is mediating
the effect of time DEMO on choice deferral.

STUDY DEMO: THE MEDIATING EEFECT
OE THE DECISION PROCESS
Method
Subjects were 143 DEMO marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. The task and instructions
were similar to the previous studies. One group of subjects
made choices without any DEMO limits, and the other group
was given 15 seconds for each DEMO problem in three
different product categories: televisions, microwave ov-
ens, DEMO cameras. As in study 1, the options were rela-
tively equal DEMO attractiveness (i.e., high conflict), with
each described on several features (see Fig. 3 for an exam-
ple). For instance, in DEMO category of televisions, the two
options varied on the following five DEMO: picture qual-
ity (on a scale of 0 to 100), number of speakers, size of
screen, other, and price. Television A offered a picture
quality of 85, six speakers, an 18-inch screen, a sleep
timer, and was priced at $179. Television B offered a
picture quality of 95, two speakers, a 24-inch screen, sleep
timer, and was priced at $249.
The experiment was conducted using Mouselab, DEMO com-
puter-based process tracing technique. Information was
displayed in closed boxes presented in an option X attri-
bute matrix, where subjects could reveal the information
in each box by moving a mouse-controlled cursor to the
relevant DEMO Mouselab recorded which boxes were
opened, in what sequence, and how much time was spent
in each box. Subjects began the experiment with DEMO
tions on how to access information in the boxes by using
the mouse. They then completed a practice problem be-
fore making decisions in DEMO of the three categories.
For those in the time-pressure condition, a DEMO circle
appeared on the screen, which ticked down as the time
DEMO was reduced. If subjects did not make a choice
before the time was used, the program beeped, instructed
them to "please make a choice or indicate a value," and
would not allow them to DEMO any more boxes. Similar
to the previous studies, subjects were provided DEMO the
no-choice option. Finally, after all choices were made,
subjects DEMO asked, as a manipulation check, "How
much time pressure did DEMO feel when making deci-
sions?" and responded on a scale of 0 (no time pressure)
to 10 (great time pressure).
DEMO with other time-pressure research that has used
Mouselab (e.g., Payne et al. 1988), we calculated dif-
ferent measures that can provide evidence DEMO the degree
to which subjects use noncompensatory or compensa-
tory processing strategies. First, we calculated the nutn-
ber of acquisitions of each piece of information, referred
to as ACQ. Second, we measured the average time DEMO
acquiring each piece of information, known as TPER-
ACQ. Third, we calculated the variance in the propor-
tion of time spent on each DEMO, referred to as VAR.
Finally, we calculated the relative degree to which sub-
jects made attribute or alternative-based transitions. For
example, if a subject first checked the price of one tele-

question. At the bottom of the next screen, you will be asked to indicate
whether or not you would buy one of these televisions. DEMO can choose to
buy neither of them (and go to another DEMO), choose the first television, or

if they first checked the price of one television and then

be coded as an alternative-based transition. The measure
we used is the number of alternative-based transitions
DEMO the number of attribute-based transitions divided
by the total number of alternative-based and attribute-
based transitions combined, known as PATTERN (see,
e.g., Payne 1976; Payne et al. 1988; Sen 1998; Sen and
Johnson 1997). PATTERN can range from +1.0 to
-1. 0 with more DEMO values representing more attri-
bute-based processing. Prior research has found that un-
der time pressure there are (1) fewer ACQ, (2) reduced
TPERACQ, (3) greater VAR, and (4) a more negative
DEMO (e.g., Payne et al. 1988). We expect to repli-
cate these results, so as to show that processing indeed
was following more of a noncompensatory process un-
der time pressure.
However, of more importance to this research is to
show through a mediation analysis that the DEMO of a
noncompensatory process under time pressure is indeed
what may be driving the difference in the share of the
deferral option. In particular, to show mediation, we
must demonstrate three relationships (Baron and Kenny
DEMO). Eirst, we must show that the independent vari-
able, time pressure, significantly affects the mediator,
the measure of noncompensatory processing. Second,
we must show that the processing measure significantly
affects the dependent DEMO, choice deferral. Third,

Results
Choice Effects. As was shown in study 1, we found
that consumers under time pressure were less likely to
defer choice for options that are relatively equal in attrac-
DEMO Averaged across the three categories, 21 percent
of subjects chose the DEMO option without time pressure
and 9 percent selected it under time pressure (Table 4) .
A logit model like the one used in DEMO 1 showed this
effect to be significant (; = 2.9, p < .0\). The direction
of these results was consistent across all DEMO categories.
In addition, the results from the manipulation check
showed that DEMO with limited time felt significantly more
time pressure than those with unlimited time (X = 6.2
vs. K = 2.9, F(l , DEMO) = 55.7, p < .001). In study 5,
subjects also felt significantly more time pressure when
decision time was limited {p < .001).
Processing Effects. We next examined the process
measures. As expected, subjects acquired fewer pieces of
information (ACQ) when making decisions under time
pressure {X = 15.9, X = 11.6, F(l , DEMO) = 51.0,
p < .001). In addition, they spent less time per each ac-
quisition (TPERACQ) when making decisions under DEMO
pressure {X = 0.74, X = 0.60, F(l , 427) = 109.9,
p < .001). In terms of the variance spent examining each
attribute (VAR), there was greater variance under time
pressure (X = 0.033, ^T = 0.024, F(l , 427) = 12.9,
p < .01). These results are consistent with Payne et al.
(1988). Finally, there was no significant difference DEMO the
relative degree of attribute-based processing (PAT-
TERN) across the time-pressure conditions (X = -0.27 6
without time pressure vs. X = -0.28 4 with time pressure,
p > .50). This may in DEMO be due to the fact that PAT-
TERN assumes that attribute based transitions reveal a
more noncompensatory decision process. However, when
there are only two alternatives, a compensatory strategy
379
that is often used is the additive-difference rule even
though it involves more attribute-based transitions (Dhar
1996; DEMO, Bettman, and Payne 1997).
Mediation Analyses. Hypothesis 4 predicts that
choice processing under time pressure is likely to be non-
compensatory, which in turn will mediate the change in
choice deferral. We completed the DEMO analysis,
using VAR, which has previously been shown to vary
DEMO the mode of processing (e.g., Payne et al. 1988). As
mentioned above, we found that VAR was significantly
affected by time pressure, satisfying the first criterion for
mediation. Next, we found that VAR DEMO a significant
relationship on choice deferral {t = 2.2, p < DEMO), which
satisfies the second criterion for mediation. Einally, the
third DEMO of mediation also receives support, as the
effect of time pressure DEMO choice deferral is much weaker
when VAR is included as a variable (? = 1.5, p < .10,
vs. t = 2.9, p < .01, as mentioned above). Thus, in
support of DEMO 4, the mediation analysis shows
that VAR at least partially mediates DEMO effect of time
pressure on choice deferral.
As stated previously, although DEMO deferral decision
should consider both shared and unique features, the pri-
DEMO of the selection decision increases the likelihood of
focusing on the same features that were considered in the
selection decision (i.e., the unique DEMO) when choices
are made under time pressure (e.g., Dhar 1997; Tversky
and Shafir 1992). If such a decision process is indeed
DEMO the results, it suggests that the relative attention
paid to the DEMO features even under time pressure
can be increased by modifying the nature of the task.
Specifically, if the task is represented as a store choice
(i.e., whether to buy from a store), the selection DEMO
is eliminated, and subjects should be equally likely to
attend to DEMO and common features even under time
pressure. Thus, the usual primacy DEMO the selection decision
over the deferral decision may be reversed, depending DEMO
the decision task. We test this hypothesis for the case
where alternatives offer unique good and common bad
features (unique good pairs). In study 3, which looked
at brand choice, we found that the DEMO of the deferral
option was lower under time pressure for unique good
pairs. Since time pressure is not expected to increase the
attention paid DEMO the unique (good) features for a store-
choice task, it DEMO have no systematic effect on de-
ferral. We examine these predictions in the next study
using Mouselab.

Method
Subjects were 166 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. Two factors were DEMO
lated in a 2 (time pressure or none) X 2 (DEMO choice
or store choice) between-subjects design. As in study 4,
DEMO study was conducted using Mouselab. In this study,
subjects in the time-pressure condition were given 18
seconds for each choice problem in three DEMO product
categories: portable computers, restaurants, and automo-
biles. All items DEMO three unique good features and
three common bad features. For example, DEMO the restau-
rants category, subjects chose between Restaurant A,
which DEMO ' 'good desserts and drinks, wide selection,
and easy to get to, " and Restaurant B, which offered
"good appetizers, DEMO entrees, and plenty of parking."
Both restaurants had a ' 'long wait, dull atmosphere, and
unfriendly waiters." As in prior studies, half the subjects
had to decide whether they would eat at Restaurant A,
Restaurant B, or neither/go to another restaurant (hereaf-
DEMO referred to as "brand choice"). The other half of the
subjects were told that both restaurants were in a particu-
lar mall, and they had to decide whether they would
choose this mall or DEMO to another mall (hereafter referred
to as "store choice"). DEMO, we checked the success
of the time-pressure manipulation by asking the DEMO
question from study 4.
Results
We tested Hypothesis 5 by investigating the ratio of
unique to common features that were examined. To do
this, we constructed a value for each respondent, which
was the number of unique features examined minus the
number of common features examined divided by DEMO
total number of unique and common features examined
(which is similar DEMO style to PATTERN used in study 4) .
The value of DEMO number can range from -h 1.0 to -1.0 ,
with positive DEMO indicating a greater focus on
unique features and negative numbers indicating a greater
focus on common features. An ANOVA model was then
constructed with DEMO ratio as the dependent measure and
with the time pressure manipulation and the store/brand
choice manipulation as the two independent variables.
The interaction DEMO these two variables tests Hypothesis 5b,
while the simple effect of the time pressure manipulation
within the brand choice decision tests Hypothesis 5a.

on unique DEMO than common features when deciding
under time pressure for brand choice (DEMO = 0.334 vs.
0.179, F(l , 247) = 19.1, DEMO < .001). This result is consis-
tent with our assumption in studies 2 and 3. In addition,
and consistent with Hypothesis 5b, the interaction was
significant (F(l , 496) = 7.5, p < .01). Compared to
brand choice, there was no difference across time pressure
on the ratio of unique to common features examined in
DEMO choice (X = 0.149 vs. X = 0.154).
Next, we examine the results pertaining to Hypothesis
6, which predicts that choice deferral will decrease under
time pressure for brand choice but not for store DEMO
We constructed a logit model to test Hypothesis 6, which
was DEMO to those used in the first three studies. This
model included the main effect of time pressure, the main
effect of brand/store choice, product category dummies,
and the interactions. Hypothesis 6 is tested by the interac-
tion between time pressure and whether subjects made
brand or DEMO choices. As predicted, we found that choice
deferral decreased under time DEMO for brand choice
(by 13 percent) but was relatively unchanged for store
choice (an increase of 2 percent). The interaction from
the logit model testing this effect was significant (t = 2.0,
p < .05) and was consistent across all three product cate-
gories (DEMO 5) . Since subjects were more likely to con-
sider common (bad) features in store choice decisions,
there was also a significant main effect for brand/store
choice (t = 5.7, p < DEMO), indicating that subjects were
overall more likely to defer in store choice.
Discussion
This study found that the ratio of unique to common
DEMO examined is greater under time pressure for brand
choice (Hypothesis 5a) , which is consistent with our ex-
planation for the results obtained DEMO study 3. We also
found that this ratio is greater for brand choice than store
choice under time pressure (Hypothesis 5b). Accord-
ingly, choice deferral was lower under time pressure for
the brand-choice task but not for the store-choice task,
supporting Hypothesis 6. This study lends DEMO in-
CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE
sights into previous work on deferral, suggesting that an
increase in choice deferral due to choice conflict arises
because DEMO the primacy of the selection decision over the
deferral decision. Conversely, DEMO subjects view the task
as whether or not to choose from a choice set, they are
more likely to consider all relevant features even under
time pressure.
In addition to examining decision processes using
Mouselab, we conducted a separate study that examined
the memory for attributes under time DEMO (e.g.,
Nowlis 1995). Research on consumer memory suggests
that DEMO an attribute can be recalled, then it is likely that it
DEMO as an input for choice (Lynch, Marmorstein, and
Weigold 1988)DEMO If common features receive relatively
less weight than unique features when decisions are made
under time pressure, we would expect better recall for
unique features compared to common features when time
is limited. We conducted a DEMO that measured the recall
of common and unique features for the options with
unique good, common bad features and unique bad, com-
mon DEMO features. Subjects were 231 undergraduate mar-
keting students fulfilling a course requirement. Two fac-
tors were manipulated in a 2 (decision made either with
or without time pressure) X 2 (alternatives had either
three common DEMO features and three unique good fea-
tures, or alternatives had three DEMO good features and
three unique bad features) between-subjects design. After
subjects DEMO made their choices and without prior warn-
ing, they were asked DEMO recall as many features as they
could from the last category they had seen, vacations. We
found that when decisions were made under time pressure
an average of 1.3 unique features each and 0.6 common
features DEMO correctly recalled, for a ratio of 2.17. With-
out time pressure, on the other hand, an average of 1.4
unique features each and 1.1 common features were cor-
rectly recalled, for a ratio of 1.27. The difference between
these ratios is significant (t = 2.4, p < .01), further
supporting the Mouselab findings in study 5.
DISCUSSION
Consumers often face situations that require making
decisions quickly. We examined the effect DEMO time pres-
sure on choice deferral to gain a better understanding of
decision making under time constraints and the processes
that underlie choice deferral. DEMO proposed that time pres-
sure influences choice deferral by altering the ease of
deciding which option to choose (the selection decision)
as well as by increasing the weight of unique features
in determining whether or DEMO to choose (the deferral
decision). Conceptually, the choice of the deferral option
can decrease under time pressure either if the selection
decision DEMO made easier or if the information that is at-
tended to in the deferral decision process makes the op-
tions seem more attractive. Our DEMO examined the ef-
fect of time pressure on choice deferral by (DEMO) testing
predictions regarding choice deferral for different degrees
and types of DEMO conflict and thus considered conflict
381
to be a moderating influence, (2) using process tracing
methodologies to gain support for the proposed mecha-
nisms and showing that the use of a noncompensatory
rule can mediate DEMO relationship, and (3) testing the
boundaries under which the predicted DEMO operate.
These studies are summarized next.
We first examined the effect of the degree of choice
conflict when decisions were made under time pressure.
DEMO choice conflict was high and there was no time
pressure, consumers DEMO likely to make trade-off com-
parisons, which made the selection decision DEMO and
resulted in choice deferral. However, since time pressure
increased the DEMO of noncompensatory decision rules that
made the selection decision easier, we DEMO and
found that choice deferral decreased for decisions involv-
ing high conflict. In contrast, when choice conflict was
low by virtue of a choice set with a clearly superior alter-
native, time pressure had no effect on the ease of selec-
tion, and there was no difference in choice deferral in
relation to the no time-pressure condition. Thus, this study
provided some initial support for the idea that the degree
of choice DEMO moderates the effect of time pressure
on choice deferral.
The next two studies examined how the attractiveness
of the alternatives is altered by the DEMO decision pro-
cess under time pressure, which then affects choice de-
DEMO In one study, we showed that the increased focus
on the DEMO relative to the common features under time
pressure made choice deferral less sensitive to the attrac-
tiveness of the common features. In another study, we
examined how time pressure systematically influenced
choice deferral in sets that DEMO common and unique
features that were either good or bad. When the options
in the choice set offered common bad and unique good
features, consumers choosing under time pressure were
expected to find the alternatives more DEMO by placing
less weight on the common features and to find the selec-
tion decision easier by using a noncompensatory rule.
However, when the options in the choice set offered com-
mon good features and unique DEMO features, time pressure
was expected to decrease the attractiveness of the DEMO
by increasing attention on the unique bad features but also
to make it easier to choose by using a noncompensatory
decision rule. Overall, we expected and found that time
pressure reduced choice deferral when the options DEMO
unique good and common bad features but not when they
offered unique bad and common good features. Thus,
there was support for the DEMO that the type of
conflict moderates the relationship between time pressure
and choice deferral.
We next used Mouselab to examine the two proposed
underlying DEMO In one study we replicated prior
research showing an increased use of noncompensatory
strategies under time pressure and found that an increased
use of DEMO strategies at least partially seems
to mediate the effect of time pressure on choice deferral.
Thus, we found support for our premise that changes in
selection-decision strategies are responsible for the de-
382
crease iti choice deferral under time pressure for decisions
involving conflict. DEMO a second study using Mouselab, we
contrasted what we had found DEMO brand-choice decisions
(selection and deferral decisions) with what might be
expected for store-choice decisions (pure deferral deci-
sions). We predicted and found that in brand-choice deci-
sions, consumers under time pressure focused more on
unique features than common features, whereas for store-
choice decisions, there DEMO no significant change in the
weight placed on the common features. This suggests that
the greater attention on the unique features is not a DEMO
property of decision making under time pressure but
rather a consequence of respondents making the selection
decision before the deferral decision when the deferral
DEMO is provided.
Theoretical Implications
Recent consumer research has examined how conflict
influences decision processes and outcomes when the no-
choice option is provided. In DEMO, previous work has
shown how decision processes in forced choice are DEMO
fected by time constraints. The aim of this article was to
show how systematic changes in the selection and deferral
decision processes due to DEMO pressure would combine
to influence choice deferral. To the extent that selection
decisions precede deferral decisions and both are influ-
enced systematically by the DEMO of time available, it
extends our understanding of factors and mechanisms DEMO
lead to choice deferral in particular and consumer decision
making in general.
Past research on time pressure has focused on single-
stage decisions. A DEMO implication of our findings is
that time pressure will systematically distort choices when
decision making requires multiple stages. In particular,
research has shown DEMO modifying decision sequences
can have a systematic impact on the option that is chosen
(e.g., Hauser 1986; Simonson, Nowlis, and Lemon
1993). To the extent that time pressure is going to have
more DEMO effects on later stages of decision making,
one can make predictions about the precise pattern of
choices that will be observed in multistage DEMO mak-
ing. Moreover, modifying the sequence of the selection
and deferral DEMO may result in different degrees of
choice deferral for the same choice set. For instance, if
unique features are more salient when the deferral deci-
sion is made after the selection decision, it suggests that
altering the sequence of the two stages (asking consumers
to first decide whether to choose and then which to
choose) may alter the focus on unique and shared features
and, consequently, the likelihood of deferral (Dhar and
Nowlis 1999).
Our approach primarily assumed that time constraints
are DEMO to other task-related factors that influence the
relative costs and benefits involved in information pro-
cessing (Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993). Although
past research suggests that strategies shift in adapting to
the task by DEMO efficient effort-accuracy trade-offs.
JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
these studies have not considered the option of choice
deferral. An interesting question is whether the type DEMO
decision processes observed in the current studies are
consistent with the notion of an adaptive decision maker.
In this case, the normative benchmark against which judg-
ments of accuracy are compared would have to take into
DEMO the reservation utility of the individual. Generally
speaking, the neglect of DEMO features is problematic
for an adaptive framework since whether or not a feature
is considered in a deferral decision should depend on its
importance DEMO and not whether it is shared or unique
in the choice set provided.
Our research was confined to simple binary choice sets.
Another line DEMO future research might look at the effect
of the number of brands in the choice set when choices
are made under time pressure. For DEMO, a number of
studies have shown that consumers prefer the middle DEMO
tion in a three-option choice set when conflict is high
(Simonson DEMO Tversky 1992). In such a case, we would
expect that DEMO share of the compromise option would
decrease under time pressure as subjects would use non-
compensatory rules that favored extreme options. Indeed,
the DEMO have conducted such a study and found the
predicted effects (Dhar, Nowlis, and Sherman 1998).
Marketing Implications
The effect of context on choice deferral suggests that
managers should consider not only the attribute values DEMO
their brands but also the relationship among the available
alternatives. For instance, choice deferral may be greater
when no single alternative is easily seen as the best, even
though each option by itself is quite attractive. Addition-
ally, we know that a number of decisions are made by
consumers under time pressure and that consumers often
spend a limited amount DEMO time making decisions in many
product categories. To the extent that the effect of context
on deferral varies with time constraints, it is important to
determine how time pressed is the consumer while shop-
ping in DEMO given category. In this vein, the effect of in-
creased brand DEMO on deferral is likely to be di-
minished in categories where subjects choose using
simple noncompensatory rules.
Many real world situations involve choice among DEMO
eral attractive alternatives that require difficult trade-offs.
To the extent that decision difficulty increases deferral,
marketers should try to persuade consumers to use DEMO
gies that decrease selection difficulty and thus choice de-
ferral. The current research shows that one way to induce
choice would be for the DEMO to generate time constraints
where none exist. As an example, consider DEMO look-
ing for a new apartment who is deciding among several
attractive options. In this case, the realtor could casually
mention that there is a second prospective consumer and
that these apartments are available if the DEMO is signed
immediately. This technique may be successful even
when there is very little uncertainty of losing one of the
alternatives. For instance, electronic stores often give a
CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE
nominal discount if the consumer makes an DEMO
purchase decision. Although the discount may itself pro-
vide an incentive to purchase, adding the time constraint
may also restructure the decision in a manner that makes
the choice easier. In addition, there is an increasing num-
ber of Internet sites that auction products. Many of these
sites DEMO a limited amount of time in which to bid for
the products, and since difficult trade-offs are likely to
be involved, this might DEMO consumers to be more
likely to make a choice.
Recent research has shown that the characteristics of
the products to which new features are DEMO are im-
portant determinants of the impact of these features (e.g.,DEMO
Nowlis and Simonson 1996). Our findings suggest that,
more generally, the impact of unique features is even
greater when decisions are made under time pressure.
This would suggest that relatively unimportant features
that are DEMO as unique may be particularly useful in dif-
ferentiating options and determining choice when con-
sumers have a limited amount of time to decide. DEMO
instance, features that are actually irrelevant such as
"fiaked coffee crystal" can appear to be valuable in cer-
tain contexts (Carpenter, Glazer, and Nakamoto 1994),
and such an effect might become even DEMO pronounced
when decisions are made under time pressure.
