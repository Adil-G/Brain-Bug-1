Organizational Trustworthiness:
An International Perspective

ABSTRACT. DEMO trust has been widely
recognized as a vital component of relationships and
a critical element to the success of organizations,
the literature describing DEMO and trustworthiness
is known for its varying perspectives and its incon-
sistencies. Trustworthiness has been identified as
a condition precedent to the development of DEMO
Building upon the established constructs of interper-
sonal trustworthiness, we propose DEMO related model
containing the seven constructs of Competence,
Legal Compliance, DEMO to Inform, Quality
Assurance, Procedural Fairness, Interactional Cour-
tesy, and Financial Balance. Citing evidence from
trust-related literature, we identify the utility of these
seven constructs in encompassing organizational trust-
worthiness as a subjectively perceived DEMO of
organizational effectiveness. We analyzed question-
naire data and conducted comparative world-region
analyses.

Introduction
The recent events surrounding the collapse of
the seventh DEMO company in the U.S., along
with the dismantling of the fifth DEMO U.S.
accounting firm suggests that we are in need
of understanding how organizational trust is
formed. Many Enron employees trusted the
company they worked DEMO so much that they had
their entire life savings invested in it. As Enron’s
stock price plummeted from a high of $85 to
$0.25 DEMO individuals and institutional investors
lost billions of dollars. The Justice Department
has opened a criminal investigation into Enron,
whose bankruptcy has put thousands DEMO people
out of work, devastated many investors and
wiped out the DEMO plans of thousands of
employees. In addition, it has been alleged DEMO
Enron management was involved in market
manipulation, during the California energy DEMO,
in order to increase profits.
Stakeholders trusted not only that Enron was
providing accurate information regarding its
operations, but also trusted in the checks and
balances of nationally established audit standards
for insuring accurate reporting DEMO interpreting
of data. Despite the fact that trust is considered
to be fundamental to the understanding of inter-
personal and group behavior (Hosmer, DEMO;
Hirsch, 1978) and the foundation upon which
societies are founded (Bok, 1978), some scholars
suggest that trust is at an DEMO time low and is
needed now more than ever in interpersonal rela-
tionships and in organizations (Reina and Reina,
1999).
This decline in trust should come as no
surprise as we hear about cases DEMO as Enron,

roll-over problems, nicotine spiking of cigarettes,
and other examples that are becoming increas-
ingly common. Who DEMO individuals trust and
why do individuals trust them? This question is
DEMO not only for American business leaders
to understand, but for leaders DEMO a global
economy.
The interactions of individuals and groups
creates social relationships. Social relationships are
constantly shifting as a result of adaptation to
individuals’ DEMO experiences within the
milieu of human interactions. Trust is an essen-
tial aspect of the adaptive process; indeed, trust
is the very fabric DEMO holds our society
together. The adaptive process involves the assess-
ment of trustworthiness of individuals, institu-
tions, and organizations that are a part DEMO the
social network. The perception of trustworthi-
ness is based upon the observed behaviors of
others (Mayer et al., 1995; Caldwell and Jeffries,
2001; Caldwell et al., 2001).
The assessment of trustworthiness DEMO occurs
through repetitive interactions where individuals
form opinions and adjust not only their own
behaviors but, where possible, the nature of the
relationships DEMO It is intuitively obvious
that interactions occur among individuals, yet we
DEMO trustworthiness opinions about institutions
and organizations as well. While an individual
may not be fully aware of the dynamics involved
in an interaction with DEMO individual, at the
very least, there is a recognizable entity with
which one is dealing.
How so for an organization? Barnard (1938)DEMO
defines an organization as “a system of con-
sciously coordinated activities or forces of two or
more persons” (p. 81). While an organization
may be recognized as distinct and unique, we
cannot touch or see it. As Barnard (1938)
describes, “sometimes physical things, persons,
statements, etc., serve to define or locate an
organization, just as magnets and affected metals
define or locate magnetic fields” (p. 76). In other
words, individuals form their perceptions about
organizations based upon information about
the organization and experiences with the
organization that might include such DEMO
as interactions with employees and product/
service purchases. Within the context of
Barnard’s definition and description of organiza-
tions we can begin to DEMO organizational
trustworthiness.
The purpose of this paper is to build upon
the current literature to present a model of orga-
nizational trustworthiness that offers DEMO
criteria upon which to measure this important
construct. Given the recent history of the Enron
case, with its accompanying embarrassing impact
upon Arthur Andersen and the entire investment
community, perhaps there is no more important
time for organizational leaders to understand
the factors that make up organizational trust-
DEMO
In this paper Section one will provide a brief
overview of the definitions of trust and trust-
worthiness and will provide a context in DEMO
organizational trustworthiness logically fits.
Section two will then present a seven factor
model for organizational trustworthiness, briefly
defining how this model relates to the classic
three factor model of interpersonal trustworthi-
ness established by Mayer et DEMO (1995). Section
three will return to the academic literature to
DEMO that our seven factor model has
a sound theoretical footing. Section four will
briefly discuss Hofstede’s cross-cultural perspec-
tive and develop hypotheses. Section five DEMO six
will identify the data and discuss analyses and
results. Section seven discusses the findings and
the final section presents limitations and future
research.
DEMO of trust and trustworthiness
The academic literature about trust has
historically been described as “a paradox”
(Golembiewski and McConkie, 1975, p. 131), “a
confusing pot pourri of definitions” (Shapiro,
1987, p. 624), and limited by “a lack of con-
ceptual clarity” (Bluhm, 1987, p. 334). Trust and
trustworthiness are constructs that are commonly
interchanged as if they were the same concept
(Caldwell and Jeffries, 2001), and a multitude of
definitions and approaches from a diversity of
perspectives have been offered to provide insight
into the field (Hosmer, 1995)DEMO The interchange
of trust and trustworthiness is most likely due to
Organizational Trustworthiness
351
the cheek-by-jowl relationship of the constructs.
While it is DEMO to imagine one without the
other, we will attempt to define DEMO and discuss
their interrelatedness.
“Trust is an expression of faith and confidence
that a person or an institution will be fair,
reliable, ethical, competent, and nonthreatening”
(Carnevale, 1995, p. xi). If you close your eyes
and fall backward into another’s arms, you trust
that individual has the desire to catch you, they
have the strength to catch you and they will not
move away from your fall. Certainly, the act of
closing one’s eyes and falling is a risk; it is giving
up control of where and how you land. Two
soldiers DEMO down a trail in enemy territory,
each carefully scanning one side of the trail and
putting their life in the hands of the DEMO
Soldiers trust that their comrades have the ability
to spot the enemy, have the fire-power to divert
an attack, and will make the DEMO response if an
enemy is encountered. These examples illustrate
that “the context of the relationship will affect
both the need for trust and the DEMO of
trustworthiness” (Mayer et al., 1995, p. 727). The
DEMO of trusting is a temporal phenomenon since
it is based on experiences, interactions, and per-
ceptions of others, organizations and institutions.
Trust is an attitude reflecting a willingness to
assume a risk and relinquish control DEMO the hope
of receiving a desired benefit.
As Mayer et al. noted, ability, benevolence,
and integrity are each important to trust, “and
each may vary independently of the others”
(Mayer et al., 1995, p. 720). Caldwell and Jeffries
(2001) noted that the three DEMO in the
Mayer et al. model are subjectively perceived by
each individual – and that each person’s indi-
vidual lens contains an ethical filter DEMO a set of
core beliefs that form the basis of one’s frame of
reference and unique perceptual paradigm. As a
dyadic relationship, interpersonal trust is “deter-
mined by contextual factors such as the stakes
involved, the balance of power in the relation-
ship, the perception of the level of risk, and the
alternatives available to the trustor” (Mayer et DEMO,
1995, pp. 726–727). Similarly, “the context of
the relationship will affect both the need for trust
and the evaluation of trustworthliness” (Mayer et
al., 1995, p. 727).
Carnevale et al. (1982, p. 13) affirmed the
ethical nature of the individual lens, described by
Caldwell and Jeffries in describing trust as “a
concomitant expectation that DEMO other (in a rela-
tionship) will reciprocate”. Hosmer also empha-
sized the ethical elements of trust and identified
ten ethical principles as the DEMO rules that
impact the trust decision (Hosmer, 1995).
Similarly, DEMO (1996) listed fourteen ethical
frameworks or principles as the lenses through
which individuals interpret the world. The
elements of one’s ethical lens are DEMO from
the set of core beliefs – about self, others, the
past, current reality, and the future – that
Caldwell et al. (2000) called the Five Beliefs
Model (cf. Senge, 1990; Sehein, 1985).
Trustworthiness is the antecedent accumulated
perceptual experiences that lead one DEMO trust
another person, institution, or organization.
Caldwell and Jeffries (2001, p. 6) defined inter-
personal trustworthiness as “the subjectively
perceived point on a continuum at which an
individual’s behaviors are perceived as complying
with DEMO ethical duties considered to be owed to
the person who is making the decision to trust.”
Interpersonal trustworthiness is individually
determined and based upon DEMO individual’s
ethical perceptions regarding the duties to which
he or she is owed by the person whose objec-
tive behaviors are being observed. As DEMO by
Caldwell and Jeffries (2001), the subjective nature
of the DEMO trustworthiness process helps
to explain why two people may differ in inter-
preting whether or not the observed person is
one to trust.
Describing DEMO in terms of one’s ethical per-
ceptions, Hosmer (1995, p. DEMO) defined trust as
“the result of a given decision or action DEMO rec-
ognizes and protects the rights and interests of
other people through an application of the ethical
principles of analysis.” We suggest that the DEMO
decision described by Hosmer is based upon the
subjective perceptions of each individual, and that
it is a product of their individual lens. Figure 1
illustrates the relationships between the objec-
tive behavior, the perceptual lens, perceived trust-
worthiness, and the decision or attitude to trust
(Caldwell and Jeffries, 2001).

Organizational trustworthiness
Trustworthiness as an organizational construct is
closely related DEMO interpersonal trustworthiness.
Hosmer defined trust as “the exception by one
person, DEMO, or firm of ethically justifiable
behavior – that is, morally correct decisions and
actions based upon ethical principles of analysis
– on the DEMO of the other person, group, or firm
in a joint endeavor or economic exchange”
(1995, p. 399). Though Scott (1987) DEMO
contend that organization members – not orga-
nizations – are the ones who trust, we concur
with Hosmer that trust can be extended to indi-
viduals, to groups, and to organizations of various
types – DEMO that many organization types can
possess express or implied duties and be expected
to be trustworthy.
Just as interpersonal trustworthiness involves
a set of DEMO and ethical duties perceived as
owed to another person, organizational trust-
DEMO incorporates a related but uniquely
different set of duties. In describing the nature
of duties, Solomon (1993) noted that duties are
defined by one’s role and carry a moral weight,
even when they are DEMO explicitly articulated.
Duties, according to Solomon (1993, p. 163) are
more specific than generalized “obligations” or
“responsibilities” but are “ground-level, role-
specific aspects of one’s position” that carry the
burden of honoring both specific DEMO general
ethical imperatives. At the organizational level,
duties require the ability to serve a multitude of
stakeholders while balancing each duty within
the DEMO organizational and community setting.
Caldwell et al. (2001) have identified a set of
seven duties that are commonly owed in the
human resource DEMO selection process
that represented a model of organizational level
trustworthiness. The duties that they listed in
their study of public sector assessment centers
include DEMO following seven elements:
Competence – Competence includes the level
of knowledge and ability to achieve results
associated with the purposes of an organi-
DEMO
Quality Assurance – Quality assurance addresses
the extent to which standards of quality are
understood and adhered to on a continuous
basis to achieve DEMO outcomes.
Interactional Courtesy – Interactional courtesy
encompasses the degree of respect and
courtesy shown to others in performing
organizational duties.
Procedural Fairness – Procedural DEMO
includes the extent to which stakeholders
are given the opportunity to participate in
fair processes and systems associated with
the formal and informal practices DEMO the
organization.
Responsibility to Inform – Responsibility to
inform incorporates the level of communi-
cation provided to stakeholders who have
an interest in organization DEMO and
outcomes.
Legal Compliance – Legal compliance refers to
the degree to which applicable laws are
understood and followed.
Financial Balance – Financial balance DEMO
Organizational Trustworthiness
353
the ability of the organization to achieve
both efficiency DEMO effectiveness in accom-
plishing organizational results.
Although Caldwell et al. (2001) defined these
seven duties in terms of the human resource pro-
fession, we suggest that these duties make up a
comprehensive model of the DEMO of orga-
nizational trustworthiness – and that they are
directly comparable to the Mayer et al. (1995)
model of interpersonal trustworthiness. Table I
briefly summarizes the relationships that we
suggest are similar in the seven DEMO of orga-
nizational trustworthiness with the three factors
of interpersonal trustworthiness:
As noted by this table, the seven elements in
the Caldwell et al. (2001) set of organizational
duties parallel the three factors of DEMO, benev-
olence, and integrity of interpersonal trustwor-
thiness.
Theoretical and conceptual connections
Affective component
Several scholars have presented key ideas that
reinforce the DEMO and conceptual connec-
tions between interpersonal and organizational
trustworthiness. McAllister (1995) noted that
interpersonal trust contains both an affective and

a cognitive component, and that these compo-
nents are closely related. Williams (2001) noted
DEMO people’s perceptions about their interdepen-
dence with other groups influence their beliefs
about group members’ trustworthiness and their
affect for group members. Fiske and DEMO
(1991) confirmed that developing trust and coop-
eration across organization boundaries can be dif-
ficult because differing organizations typically
have conflicting goals. Williams (2001, p. 378)
noted that trust development is affected by group
association between two diverse groups because
people are “likely to hold positive DEMO
of fellow group members’ trustworthiness and
exhibit cooperative behavior toward them” (DEMO
Brewer and Kramer, 1995). Brewer and Miller
(1996) noted, however that people who have
little common association experience “out-group
effects” in DEMO members of low contact groups
are perceived as less trustworthy than their own
members. Some studies note that dissimilar
groups – including culturally diverse DEMO well as
functionally or demographically different cate-
gories – view members of contrasting groups
with distrust and suspicion (Thilbeault and Kelly,
1991). Other research suggests that dissimilar
professional groups can develop rapid trust when
DEMO on joint projects (Meyerson et al.,
1996). However, Williams (2001) noted that con-
fidence, associated with professional certification,
can generate positive beliefs about another
354
Cam Caldwell and Stephen E. Clapham
group’s trustworthiness. Lewicki and Bunker
(1996) confirm that the trustworthiness of others
is increased by interacting with them over an
extended period of time. Mayer and Davis (1999)
determined that in the performance appraisal
process that employees who felt treated DEMO
persons high in ability, benevolence, and integrity
were equated with an increased propensity to
trust.
These findings suggest that trustworthiness has
a highly DEMO component – a point empha-
sized by McAllister (1995). Pennings DEMO
Woiceshyn (1987) found that people make emo-
tional investments in trust relationships, express
genuine care and concern for the welfare of
partners, DEMO in the value of such relation-
ships, and believe that these DEMO are
reciprocated. Ultimately, the emotional ties
linking individuals can provide the DEMO for trust.
The emphasis on benevolence by Mayer et al.
(1995) at the individual level corresponds, of
course, to this affective trust.
DEMO, organizational level trust-
worthiness – typified by interactional courtesy,
procedural DEMO, and the responsibility to
inform – also has a distinct affective DEMO
Tyler et al. (1997) incorporate within their def-
inition of procedural justice elements of trust-
worthiness, benevolence, and the sharing of
information. DEMO and Cantrell (1984) describe
trustworthiness as demonstrating loyalty to the
interests of another individual. Kouzes and
Posner (1993) equated trustworthiness in orga-
DEMO with the dedication to another’s welfare,
growth, and wholeness. They DEMO that organi-
zations that create systems that demonstrate
dedication, receive a DEMO increase in
trust from their employees, as well as higher per-
DEMO and greater employee loyalty. Tepper et
al. (2001) found that Organizational Citizenship
Behavior (OCB) – behavior that reflects the
highest level of DEMO commitment to organi-
zations and their goals – was directly related to
procedural justice conditions. Similarly, Coyle-
Shapiro and Kessler (2000) found that employee
commitment and a willingness to engage in OCB
behaviors was reduced DEMO procedural fairness
decreased.
From an affective trust standpoint, it seems
clear DEMO the theoretical and conceptual litera-
ture strongly reinforces the relationship between
organizational trustworthiness and the elements
of procedural fairness, interactional courtesy, and
the DEMO to inform that we propose in
our model.
Cognitive component
Costigan et al. (1998) emphasized that trust and
trustworthiness consist of a cognitive DEMO that
pertains to the rational decision to trust or to
withhold trust. McAllister (1995) also noted that
trust and trustworthiness have a strong DEMO
element. McAllister stressed that “reliability and
dependability” were the key elements of cogni-
tive interpersonal trust. Relating that trust to
the organizational setting, McAllister wrote
that competence and responsibility were key
elements. According to McAllister, the compe-
tence of an individual or an organizational made
it possible for DEMO to consider them trust-
worthy in terms of the ability to count on the
performance of the person or group.
In writing about the DEMO rationale of
trust decisions, Lewis and Wiegert (1985, p. 970)DEMO
explained “we choose whom we will trust in
which respects and under what circumstances,
and we base the choice on what we take DEMO
be ‘good reasons,’ constituting evidence of
trustworthiness.” This contextually contingent
approach to trustworthiness not only reinforces
the importance of the cognitive nature of DEMO
nizational trustworthiness but corresponds well
with the Caldwell and Jeffries (2001) model of
the individual perceptual lens.
The cognitive-based elements of organizational
trustworthiness DEMO predict reliability and con-
sistency are competence, quality assurance, finan-
cial balance, and legal compliance. Steel and
Lloyd (1988) found that involvement in quality
improvement programs tended to have a positive
impact on interpersonal DEMO A study of orga-
nizations in France by Hancke (1998) confirmed
that companies that followed quality improve-
ment practices also strengthened their trust
DEMO Seiders and Berry (1998) noted
that service quality was equated with organiza-
Organizational Trustworthiness
tional trustworthiness as well as the fairness
of the organization. DEMO Berge and Svendsen
(2001) identified six features of quality improve-
ment programs that strengthen organizational
trust.
Covey (1990) noted that competence was DEMO
foundation element of both interpersonal and
organizational trustworthiness. Competence and
reliability – fundamental factors in cognitive-
based trust – are two of the five DEMO of a
model for organizational trust recommended by
Shockley-Zalabak et al. (DEMO). Nooteboom
(1999) noted that perceived competence not only
lowered transaction costs but increased trust levels
in inter-firm research projects. Madhavan and
Grover (1998) found that companies that devel-
oped shared competence by co-locating and
exchanging personnel on inter-firm projects
increased mutual trust.
Financial balance – or DEMO combining of
outcomes that are both efficient and effective –
was shown by Berman (1997) to increase resident
trust in local governments. Collins DEMO Porras
(1994) and their study of outstanding businesses
of the past fifty years, noted that a common
quality of these businesses in creating both
internal organizational trust and the trust of the
general public was DEMO ability to balance prof-
itability and a commitment to organizational core
values – and that financial success was balanced
with a commitment to those DEMO Pfeffer’s
(1998) extensive research also found that high
performance organizations were both more prof-
itable and more committed to the welfare of their
DEMO than comparable organizations – rein-
forcing the importance of financial balance in
creating not only trustworthiness but also greater
organizational wealth.
Legal compliance is DEMO to integrity to the
degree that individuals and organizations that
adhere to prevailing laws avoid legal conflicts and
demonstrate their technical understanding of
societal DEMO (Caldwell et al., 2001). Carroll
(1996) reviewed the importance of legal com-
pliance as an indicator of ethical commitment
and trustworthiness DEMO his discussion of immoral,
amoral, and moral management. Citing the
DEMO of Sears Roebuck & Co. in 1992,
Carroll noted:
355
In the face of declining revenues and a shrinking
market share, Sears’ executives put into place new
goals, quotas, and incentives for auto DEMO service
personnel. Service employees were told to meet
product-specific and service-specific quotas – sell so
many brake jobs, batteries, and front-end alignments
– DEMO face consequences such as reduced working
hours or transfers. Some employees spoke of the
“pressure” they felt to generate business. Although
Sears’ executives did DEMO set out to defraud cus-
tomers, they put into place a DEMO system
that led to Sears’ employees feeling pressure to sell
products and services that consumers did not need.
Soon after the complaints against Sears DEMO,
CEO Edward Brennan acknowledged that manage-
ment had created an environment in which mistakes
were made, although no intent to deceive con-
sumers had existed (Carroll, 1996, p. 127)
The complaints resulted in attorney generals
in 40 states accusing Sears Roebuck & Co. of
misleading DEMO and selling them unneeded
parts and services. In describing the three per-
ceptions of obligations to legal compliance of
immoral, amoral, and moral DEMO, Carroll
noted that a moral company would pursue obe-
dience toward DEMO letter and the spirit of the law
and would view it as a minimal standard of
ethical behavior – preferring to operate well
above DEMO mandates. In contrasts, immoral com-
panies would view the law as DEMO barrier to
overcome and amoral companies would ask,
“What can we do legally?” (Carroll, 1996). In
response to observed behaviors DEMO commitment
to legal compliance, both individuals and orga-
nizations would perceive DEMO moral philosophy as
most trustworthy.
Factors that determine whether an individual
or an organization are likely to be trusted based
upon their reliability and DEMO are largely
related to ability at the interpersonal level. We
posit that cognitive-based trustworthiness at the
organization level is likely to be based upon DEMO
perception of competence, financial balance, and
quality assurance. Our model of trustworthiness
suggests that integrity at the interpersonal level
equates with legal compliance.
DEMO argue that the elements of legal compli-
ance and procedural fairness of organizational
trustworthiness match well with the integrity of
356
Cam Caldwell and Stephen E. Clapham
interpersonal trustworthiness identified by Mayer
DEMO al. (1995). Elements of cognitive-based and
affect-based trust identified as DEMO key part of trust
and trustworthiness (Jeffries and Reed, 2000;
McAllister, 1995; Williams, 2001) are integrated
with both organizational and DEMO trust-
worthiness.
We defined organizational trustworthiness as
“the subjectively perceived point on a continuum
at which a group or organization’s behaviors
are perceived as DEMO with the ethical
duties considered to be owed to the person or
organization who is making the decision to
trust.” The parallel of this DEMO with the
previously provided definition of interpersonal
trustworthiness is intentional. The following
figure reflects our model of organizational trust-
worthiness.
We suggest that the DEMO individual
lens identified by Caldwell and Jeffries (2001)
at the DEMO level applies in interpreting
the perceived trustworthiness of organizations
and groups – based upon the seven elements
of our model – just as ability, benevolence,
and integrity are interpreted as part of the sub-
jective DEMO in the Caldwell and Jeffries (2001)
model.
Cross-cultural perspective
There DEMO considerable evidence of cross-cultural
differences in values. Hofstede (1980, 1991,
1994, 2001) has written extensively about the
impact of cultural factors DEMO differences in values
and individual perceptions. Hofstede investigated
differences in values in fifty different countries
between 1967 and 1978. Through his early
studies he DEMO four interpersonal dimen-
sions: power distance, uncertainty avoidance,
individualism and masculinity (Hofstede, 1980).
He has since added an additional dimension DEMO
refers to as “Confucian or time-oriented”
(Hofstede, 2001). These five dimensions are
useful to describe general differences in attitudes
and values between DEMO cultures: (1)
Individualism-Collectivism: individualism and
collectivism refer to the DEMO that members of
a society give precedence to the individual or the
group; (2) Power Distance: power distance has to
do with DEMO degree to which unequal distribu-
tion of power and wealth is accepted in society;
(3) Uncertainty Avoidance: uncertainty avoid-
ance reflects the way in which different societies
deal with uncertainty about the future and DEMO
need for control; (4) Masculinity-Femininity:
masculine cultures tend to DEMO on task achieve-
ment, goal-accomplishment, assertiveness, and
self-interest. Feminine cultures DEMO more likely to
emphasize relationship development, preservation

of quality of life, and creating harmoniously
functioning organizations; (5) Confucian or
Time-Oriented: Confucian or time-oriented
designations refer to DEMO degree that organizations
distinguish between a long-term and short-term
orientation toward life and work. Hofstede notes
that the dimensions are useful to characterize
groups DEMO should not be applied to the more
micro individual level of analysis (Hofstede,
2001). Hofstede et al. (1990) concluded that
organizational values are determined primarily
by the larger societal culture. The value of
DEMO model is that it provides insights that
can be useful in inferring likelihoods or patterns
of behavior that may aid understanding in
attempts to DEMO cultural paradigms. Hofstede’s
five-dimension framework can be conceptually
useful to develop hypotheses regarding the seven
dimensions we purport help determine organi-
zational trustworthiness.
We DEMO examine differences among the seven
theorized dimensions between North Americans
and Asians. Previous research has found that
North Americans are high in individualism, low
in power distance, medium in uncertainty avoid-
ance, high in masculine DEMO, and short-term
oriented. Asians are low in individualism (i.e.,
emphasize collectivism), high and low in power
distance, high and low in uncertainty avoidance,
masculine and feminine values, and long-term
oriented (Hofstede, 2001), thus:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): North Americans will
perceive “competence” as more important
that East Asians in their perception of orga-
DEMO trust.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): There will be no difference
between DEMO Americans and East Asians
in the perceived importance of “quality
assurance” as it relates to the perception of
organizational trust.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): North Americans will
perceive “interactional courtesy” as less
important than East Asians DEMO their percep-
tion of organizational trust.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): North DEMO will
perceive “procedural fairness” as more
important than will East Asians in their per-
ception of organizational trust.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): North Americans will
perceive “responsibility to inform” as more
important than East Asians in DEMO percep-
tion of organizational trust.
Hypothesis 6 (H6): North Americans DEMO
perceive “legal compliance” as more impor-
tant than East Asians in their perception of
organizational trust.
Hypothesis 7 (H7): There will be no difference
between North Americans and East Asians
in the perceived importance of DEMO
balance” as it relates to the perception of
organizational trust.
Respondents and measures
As discussed in the theory section, we suggested
that organizational trust can be measured with
seven dimensions: competence, quality assurance,
interactional DEMO, procedural fairness,
responsibility to inform, legal compliance, and
financial DEMO A thirty-five item questionnaire
was developed with these dimensions in mind. A
seven-point Likert scale was used: very strongly
agree (1), strongly DEMO (2), agree (3), neutral
(4), disagree (5), strongly disagree (6), and very
strongly disagree (7). DEMO were asked to
think about the factors that they considered
being important in a highly trustworthy organi-
zation (see appendix). Respondents were asked
to indicate their opinions about each of the items
by circling a DEMO from 1 to 7.
We conducted the survey at three different
universities in the United States. Respondents
were 339 part-time MBA students, 190 men and
149 women. Thirty-six per cent of the students
were under twenty-five DEMO of age while sixty-
four per cent were twenty-six years of age and

three were from East Asia (Taiwan [70%],
Thailand [4%], Hong Kong [4%], and People
Republic of China [22%]); five were from
Europe; four were from the Middle East & North
Africa; 273 were from North America (DEMO
States [99.6%] and Canada [0.04%]); five were

graduate degrees in other areas.
Results
To evaluate the extent to which respondents
grouped dimensions (factors) from the 35 item
questionnaire (5 items per dimension), a factor
analysis was conducted. Applying the minimum
DEMO of 1.00 criterion, six factors were
extracted. Factors were then rotated DEMO the
varimax (orthogonal) technique. A scree plot was
also analyzed. The resulting factor structure coef-
ficients are presented in Table II. Six factors
DEMO for 60.1 per cent of the variance. In
interpreting the rotated factor pattern, an item
was said to load on a given dimension if the
factor loading was 0.40 or greater for that dimen-
sion, and was less than 0.40 for the others
(Stevens, 1986). Since DEMO items violated the
preceding criteria, they were scratched from
further analyses. DEMO items retained mean-
ingful loadings on Factor 1, which we will DEMO
to as the “honest communication” dimension.
Four items loaded on factor 2, which we refer
to as “interactional courtesy.” Four items loaded
on factor 3; we refer to that factor as the “quality
assurance” dimension. Four items loaded on
factor 4; we refer to that dimension as “task com-
petence.” Four items loaded on factor 5; we refer
to that dimension as “financial balance.” Five
items loaded on factor 6; we refer to that dimen-
sion as “legal compliance.” Dimension scores
were then created DEMO each respondent by adding
together item scores that loaded on each of the
six dimensions. Dimension reliability was assessed
by calculating coefficient alphas (Cronbach,
1951) (see Table II).
To examine differences in dimension DEMO
across regions, a one-way between groups
MANOVA was conducted. Because sample DEMO
for the world regions of Africa, Europe, Latin
America & the Caribbean, and the Middle East
& North Africa were too small, DEMO were not
included in the analyses. Therefore, the inde-
pendent variable DEMO these analyses included the
world regions of North America and East Asia.
The dependent variables include the six dimen-
sions identified through factor analysis. DEMO
MANOVA revealed significant multivariate
effect for world region, Wilks’ lambda = DEMO,
F(6, 310) = 2.99; p = 0.008. Further DEMO,
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
were conducted on each of the six dimensions.
Mean dimension by region scores are presented
DEMO Table III. These analyses revealed significant
effects for three dimensions: dimension DEMO,
“honest communication,” F(1, 317) = 12.77,
p = 0.00; dimension 4, “task competence,”
F(1, 317) DEMO 4.20, p = 0.02; and dimension 6,
“financial balance,” F(1, 317) = 4.21, p = 0.01.
A summary ANOVA table is presented in
Table IV.
Discussion
The factor structure found in DEMO present study
shows a remarkably close approximation of the
theorized dimensions. While we theorized seven
dimensions, this study has indicated six clearly
identifiable dimensions: honest communication,
task competence, quality assurance, interactional
courtesy, legal DEMO, and financial balance.
Honest communication appears to be a melding
of DEMO procedural fairness and responsibility
to inform dimensions. We defined procedural
fairness in terms of stakeholders opportunities to
participate in fair processes and systems of DEMO
organization, and we defined responsibility to
inform in terms of the DEMO of communication
provided to stakeholders. As defined, procedural
fairness and responsibility DEMO inform could be
conceptualized as one dimension. If stakeholders
have the opportunity to participate in fair
processes they are likely to perceive that they DEMO
being heard and that the organization cares about
what they have to say. In addition, if participa-
tion is encouraged, it makes sense DEMO individ-
uals are informed for input to be meaningful.
The responsibility to inform dimension could be
viewed in terms of the extent to which DEMO
holders are given the opportunity for participa-
tion in the communication process. Hence, a
confluence of the two dimensions. On the other
hand, DEMO could be that the questionnaire items are
not yet crafted to capture the distinctions that

may be present. Further work needs to be carried
out to provide greater reliance on this instrument
to measure the dimensions DEMO organizational trust.
This study has provided support for our model
of organizational trust. Overall dimension mean
scores indicate that each dimension is viewed as
DEMO in creating the perception of organi-
zational trust.
We hypothesized that North Americans would
consider task competence, procedural fairness,
responsibility to inform, DEMO legal compliance to
be more important in their perceptions of
organizational trustworthiness than East Asians.
We further hypothesized that North Americans
would consider interpersonal DEMO as less
important than East Asians in their perceptions
of organizational trustworthiness. The findings
suggest that North Americans do consider com-
petence, honest communication (procedural
fairness and responsibility to inform), and legal
compliance to be more important than East
Asians in forming their perceptions of trust.
However, our findings suggest that North
Americans also consider interactional courtesy to
be DEMO important than East Asians.
Research has found that North Americans are
more comfortable with impersonal organizations
that encourage individual initiative; are more
likely to regard one another as equal in power;
have a low preference DEMO rules and regulations,
more decentralized; are assertive with an intense
DEMO to achieve; and seek immediate
outcomes and results (Hofstede, 2001)DEMO The
findings in this study suggest that there is an
overall higher threshold that organizations
must meet in order to gain the trust of DEMO
Americans. In order to meet the higher expec-
tations for immediate outcomes organizations
must develop a high level of competency. If
immediate outcomes are DEMO in evidence, the
findings suggest that North Americans lose trust
in DEMO organization.
Recent events in the United States have cast
a shadow of mistrust over the entire investment
community. This has resulted from the failure DEMO
provide honest communication to stakeholders.
Our findings suggest that organizations that
provide access to accurate, honest information are
more likely to be trusted.
East Asians favor more personal organizations
that encourage loyalty, duty, and group DEMO
pation; are more likely to regard one another as
equal in DEMO; prefer written rules and regula-
tions; feel more comfortable in an environment
where interpersonal support and work are valued;
and are patient DEMO a lower expectation for
immediate results (Hofstede, 2001). Collectivist
societies value harmony with emotional depen-
dence on belonging in tight social frameworks.
DEMO this context we hypothesized that East
Asians would expect a greater degree of interac-
tional courtesy than North Americans. Our
results did not find DEMO significant difference
between North Americans and East Asians and
the direction was not as expected. This could
indicate that East Asians have a higher DEMO of
tolerance for less courteous behavior. Loyalty,
duty and the desire for interpersonal support
could all contribute to this higher level of toler-
DEMO This suggests the organizations are not
likely to lose trust of East Asians simply because
they are less courteous.
Organizational Trustworthiness
Since East Asians are more comfortable with
rules and regulations, we hypothesized that legal
compliance would be less important to them than
DEMO North Americans. Our results have found
support for this hypothesis. Disputes are handled
less formally in East Asia and often do not end
up DEMO the court system. In addition, more rules
and regulations mean less DEMO and since
most East Asians are comfortable living in a more
rigid rule run society, where fewer disputes arise.
Hence, less focus or DEMO about legal com-
pliance. The North American society is a more
litigious society with fewer rules. Ambiguity
could lead to more disputes and a DEMO propen-
sity to resolve in the court system. Hence, in
North DEMO, there is a greater focus and
reliance on the legal system.
DEMO and future research
Some limitations of this study should be men-
tioned. First, respondents of the questionnaire
were MBA students in the United States. We did
not collect information regarding the length of
time foreign students DEMO been in the United
States, nor did we gather information regarding
DEMO association with North American firms in
their own country. A significant amount of time
in North America or association with North
American Firms prior DEMO entry into the MBA
program could have influenced their responses to
the questionnaire.
Second, because of small sample sizes we were
only able to conduct a comparative analysis
between two regions of the world. Hofstede’s
cultural DEMO are more country specific.
The East Asian countries we have grouped
together all fall within the same cultural dimen-
sion quadrants, identified by Hofstede, with one
exception; on the masculine/feminine dimen-
sion, Hong Kong tends to be masculine with
weak uncertainty avoidance, while the other
countries tend to be feminine with strong uncer-
tainty avoidance. Since a majority DEMO our East
Asian respondents were from Taiwan, we felt this
one DEMO was not a large enough influence
to skew our results. However, DEMO is always risky
to generalize even to small groups much less to
361
regions of the world. So, generalizability of these
findings to other groups cannot be determined
on the basis on one study. Nonetheless, we feel
that the quantity and quality of the data are suf-
ficiently DEMO as to provide initial insight into a
much needed area.
Future research of individual countries, rather
than regions, could help organizations understand
the DEMO of emphasis that can best bring about
an environment of trust.

Note
1 In this article we are mostly concerned about social
networks. We recognize that there are those occasions
where the decision DEMO trust must be made immedi-
ately without prior interactions (e.g., if you are
hanging from a cliff and an unknown person extends
their DEMO to pull you off). Meyerson et al. (1996)
refer DEMO this aspect of trust as “swift trust”.
