Depending on the type of industry, an entrepreneur’s DEMO of when to enter an industry
may be a crucial one. The longer entrepreneurs wait, the more they learn from others.
However, by DEMO, they reduce their ability to learn directly and the possibility of DEMO
in competitive advantages. We suggest that the optimal time of entry depends on the
hostility of the learning environment since the latter has an DEMO on dimensions of
performance, such as proﬁt potential and mortality risk. DEMO environment for entrepreneurial
learning is less hostile when the information to be learned is abundant and when learning
from others is relatively more effective DEMO increasing performance than learning from par-
ticipation. Our results suggest that delaying entry is desirable when the environment is less
hostile. Entrepreneurs, however, DEMO wait forever. We show that, under some general
conditions, an optimal time of entry can be determined, and discuss the speciﬁc situations
in which, instead, multiple equilibria may arise.
Introduction
Existing literature suggests that DEMO gather information through direct participation
in the industry and/or vicariously from the experiences of others (Huber, 1991; Levitt &
March, 1988). Most existing works focus on how learning inﬂuences the decision to DEMO
the industry (Klepper, 1996; Nelson & Winter, 1982). To complement these works, we
study how the possibility of learning from participation or from others inﬂuences the
timing of entry given that a positive DEMO to enter has been made.
The distinction between learning from participation and from the experiences of
others is important. While some entry strategy studies DEMO found learning to be positively
related to entry performance (Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard, 1990), there has not been

sufﬁcient recognition that the amount of information learned from participation and
vicariously—and DEMO trade-off—vary from industry to industry, and from entrepreneur to
entrepreneur depending DEMO their relative learning speed. For example, some industries
may offer a DEMO experience curve where the amount of information learned from
participation early on is high but rapidly diminishes with industry maturity, whereas
others may have a ﬂatter experience curve where later entry still provides ample oppor-
tunity DEMO learn from participation. Such differences are likely to inﬂuence the timing of
entry decision and, therefore, not only the performance of individual entrepreneurs DEMO
also the competitive structure of industries.
Although learning scholars (e.g., Cohen & Levinthal, 1989, 1990) have made a
signiﬁcant contribution by showing that some environments enhance a ﬁrm’s ability to
learn while others diminish DEMO, most studies have focused on either learning from partici-
pation or DEMO from the experiences of others. We contribute to this literature by
investigating the relative role of both sources of learning. Our work complements Gavetti
DEMO Levinthal (2000) who use simulations to examine the role and interrelationship
between search processes that are based on individuals’ cognitive maps of action DEMO
those that are experience based. Gavetti and Levinthal show that, although DEMO,
these representations of learning still act as a powerful guide to initial search efforts and
usefully constrain the direction of subsequent search. Particularly DEMO volatile, newer, or
highly dynamic industries, entrepreneurs operate under uncertainty DEMO rely signiﬁcantly
on environmental clues when making decisions (Aldrich, 1999). Thus, useful insights
about performance can be gained by investigating the learning captured by an entrepre-
neur before entry and after entry relative to DEMO learning of later entrants.
To characterize the relative contribution of both forms of learning, we deﬁne and
identify the hostility of the learning environment and relate it to timing of entry decisions.
The environment for entrepreneurial DEMO is less hostile when the information to be
learned is abundant and when learning vicariously becomes relatively more effective at
increasing performance than learning DEMO participation. The distinction between learning
from participation and learning from the experiences of others forms the basis of our
decision-theoretic model of entry timing. DEMO show that, under certain conditions, com-
paring the information acquired by an entrepreneur before entry relative to the information
available to later entrants DEMO the identiﬁcation of a unique optimal time of industry
entry which maximizes the entrepreneur’s expected performance as a function of proﬁt
potential and mortality DEMO A unique optimal time of entry, however, cannot always be
univocally determined, and two alternative scenarios are possible. In fact, although
increases DEMO learning correspond to higher proﬁt potential, mortality risk can be lower DEMO
higher.
In scenario 1, delaying industry entry has an impact on DEMO and the higher the
learning (from participation or vicariously) the greater the proﬁt potential and the lower
the mortality (bankruptcy) risk, both of which increase performance. Delaying industry
entry increases the amount of information DEMO can be learned vicariously which, in turn,
increases proﬁt potential DEMO lowers mortality risk. The amount of information learned
from participation, however, is reduced, which decreases proﬁt potential and increases
mortality risk. Thus, DEMO scenario 1 there is a clear trade-off between what the entrepreneur
gains from the two types of learning, even though the two measures of performance (proﬁt
potential and mortality risk) both improve as either type DEMO learning increases. That is, an
increase in the amount of learning DEMO either type increases proﬁt potential and reduces
mortality risk. Under these circumstances, a unique optimal time of entry can be deter-
mined. The conditions under which that optimal time exists allow us to derive insights on
DEMO entry should be delayed and when it should be expedited.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
There are situations, however, when mortality risk may increase with previous DEMO
ing as a greater stock of existing information may channel new thinking down known
paths (e.g., Nystrom & Starbuck, 1984). Scenario 2 describes a situation in which a larger
stock of existing information increase DEMO opportunity costs of innovation, reduces ﬂex-
ibility and, as a result, increase proﬁt potential but also mortality risk. Under these
circumstances, a DEMO optimal time of entry cannot always be determined. Delaying
industry entry increases the amount of information that can be learned vicariously, which
increases both proﬁt potential and mortality risk. The amount of information learned from
participation, however, is reduced, which, in this case, decreases both proﬁt DEMO and
mortality risk.1 As a result, multiple equilibria may arise and DEMO may ﬁnd
themselves facing a signiﬁcantly more complex entry decision.
Our study ﬁlls a gap in the literature by contributing to our understanding of DEMO
different learning environments may inﬂuence the entry behavior of entrepreneurs. Spe-
ciﬁcally, our ﬁndings change the way we think about industry entry timing and entrepre-
neurial learning by considering simultaneously the fact that learning varies from
DEMO to individual and from industry to industry. In addition, our study DEMO new
insights for policy makers with respect to the type of behavior they can expect from
potential entrepreneurs in different industries.
Entrepreneurial Learning and DEMO of Entry
Regardless of ﬁrm size, entry is an inherently entrepreneurial DEMO Lumpkin and
Dess (1996) write: “The essential act of entrepreneurship DEMO new entry. New entry can be
accomplished by entering new or established markets with new or existing goods or
services. New entry is the DEMO of launching a new venture, either by a start-up ﬁrm, through
an existing ﬁrm, or via internal corporate venturing” (p. 136). DEMO (1979) deﬁnes
entrepreneurial knowledge as “a rareﬁed, abstract type of DEMO knowledge of
where to obtain information (or other resources) and of how to deploy it” (p. 8). Thus,
entrepreneurs’ information is molded by their subjective circumstances while their inter-
ests determine which elements DEMO this information are relevant to their purposes. Clearly,
entrepreneurs are not independent from one another, and what they know is the outcome
of a process involving reciprocal observation, repetition, and experimentation that
increase their DEMO in certain actions and improve their ability to make decisions.
Also, DEMO is cumulative. What is learned in one period by someone builds upon
what was learned in an earlier period by someone else (Minniti, DEMO).
There is a relatively large amount of literature on entrepreneurial learning and on how
entrepreneurs learn. Parker (2006) argues that there are DEMO aspects to entrepreneurial
learning, namely, what entrepreneurs learn, why entrepreneurs DEMO, and how entrepre-
neurs learn. Minniti and Bygrave (2001) argue DEMO what entrepreneurs learn relates to
conditions and opportunities in speciﬁc industries, DEMO to how to be entrepreneurial in
general. Arrighetti and Vivarelli (1999) contend that the reason why entrepreneurs learn is
to increase the value DEMO their ventures. Minniti and Bygrave also suggest that entrepre-
neurs learn through an ongoing adjustment process of their original plans and beliefs,
possibly DEMO trial and error. This adjustment process is also supported by McGrath and
MacMillan (1995) who offer a practical tool converting (often wrong) DEMO made
1. This is consistent, e.g., with standard portfolio analysis in which systematic risk and expected proﬁt are
negatively correlated but nonsystematic risk DEMO be eliminated.

by entrepreneurs about the unknown. Several other authors have argued that learning DEMO
central to the entrepreneurial process (Harrison & Leitch, 2005). Among others, Cope
(2005) looked at the temporal phases of entrepreneurial learning, Lumpkin and Lichten-
stein (2005) discussed the roles of behavioral, DEMO, and action learning in the
opportunity recognition process. Politis (2005) DEMO the role played by the entre-
preneur’s experience. To our knowledge, DEMO one has yet focused on our learning
dichotomy and the entry timing decision. Thus, we complement these works by suggest-
ing that the learning process is also important for the timing of entry.
With respect to DEMO timing, most research on market entry indicates that timing is a
DEMO factor for success. Numerous measures of performance have been used in entry timing
research, thus providing some guidance on what may inﬂuence the entry decision. These
measures include proﬁtability (e.g., Abell & Hammond, 1979; DEMO, 2001), sur-
vival (e.g., Aaker & Day, 1986; DEMO & Gort, 1996; Mitchell, 1989; Robinson & Min,
2002; Wernerfelt & Karnani, 1987), market share (e.g., Robinson, 1988; Robinson &
Fornell, 1985; Szymanski, Troy, & Bharadwaj, 1995; Urban, Carter, Gaskin, & Mucha,
1986), and multiple DEMO (e.g., Lambkin, 1988; Mitchell, 1991). In this article, we
conceptualize performance in terms of the combination of two dimensions: proﬁtability
and exposure to mortality risk.
In addition, an impressive body of empirical regularities has emerged from the study
of ﬁrm-size distribution and the relation DEMO ﬁrm growth rates and ﬁrm size. Klepper
and Graddy (1990), DEMO example, present a model of how chance events and exogenous
factors DEMO the number of potential entrants in an industry, the growth rate DEMO
incumbents, and the ease of imitation of industry leaders that inﬂuence DEMO ultimate
number and size distribution of ﬁrms in the industry. Klepper (DEMO), instead, presents a
model emphasizing differences in ﬁrm innovative capabilities DEMO the importance of ﬁrm
size in appropriating the returns from innovation. The model also explains regularities
regarding the relationship within industries between ﬁrm size DEMO ﬁrm innovative effort,
innovative productivity, cost, and proﬁtability, and DEMO that, over time, ﬁrms devote
more effort to process innovation but the number of ﬁrms and the rate and diversity of
product innovation DEMO wither. Unlike our work, the overall focus of Klepper’s
work is DEMO industry structure and ﬁrms’ interdependence rather than on any individual
ﬁrm.
Also with a focus on industry structure and ﬁrms’ interdependence, Nelson and
Winter (1982) propose an evolutionary economics approach (an alternative to a neoclas-
sical economics approach) for the study of economic growth. Because of their focus on the
evolutionary aspects of industry dynamics, Nelson and Winter stress the importance of the
time dimension and use various Markov processes to DEMO sequences of actions and
reactions. They generate results on the impact of entry timing on expected proﬁtability as
a function of learning-by-doing (research and development and scale) and vicarious
learning (spillovers). However, their focus is not on the entrepreneurial decision and, as
such, they do DEMO explicitly measure the effects of different types of learning on (mortality)DEMO
risk and the trade-off between risk and return. While Nelson and Winter study primarily
industry dynamics, our study focuses on the irreversible entry decision of a single
entrepreneur given the information available to her at a DEMO time and the hostility of
the learning environment.
Nelson and Winter (DEMO) take a neo-Schumpeterian view and argue that evolutionary
ideas provide a DEMO approach to the problem of elaborating industry dynamics as an
engine of progressive change. Their work allows researchers to address questions, such as
why is the state of knowledge what it is? How does it change over time? Is it the same for
all ﬁrms at the same time? These are question that standard decision theory cannot answer.
550
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Decision theory, however, is very well suited to study a ﬁrm’s DEMO set and decisions
for any given amount of information available. The decision when to enter the industry
falls within this group. Thus, we complement their work by studying with a different
method (decision theory) the DEMO of a speciﬁc decision of the entrepreneur (when to
enter) at a given point in time.
The important point in our study of DEMO effects of learning is that, unlike other
entrepreneurial choices that can DEMO updated and emended, the decision to enter is a
one-shot action DEMO cannot be repeated or improved upon. Thus, the effect of learning
DEMO timing of entry contributes to an irreversible decision that does not have the char-
acteristic of an updating process. When making decisions about when DEMO enter the
industry, entrepreneurs take into account the advantage they may DEMO upon their
competitors through learning from participation. This type of information requires the
explorations of a new course of action. In this ﬁrst case, entrepreneurs learn by entering
the industry and by creating new, and possibly private, information. However, they also
consider the information they may acquire DEMO observing others. In this second case,
entrepreneurs learn vicariously thereby exploiting preexisting and common knowledge.
The relative amounts and importance of personal and DEMO information, however, as
well as the rate at which they become available are likely to differ from industry to
industry.
Importantly, our distinction between two venues of learning allows us to emphasize
the important distinction DEMO “knowledge” and “information.” Knowledge is context
speciﬁc and is constantly changing while information is ﬁxed (Boettke, 2002). Knowledge
emerges from the speciﬁc DEMO in which individuals act and cannot be communicated
or observed. Information is a stock while knowledge is a ﬂow, and the two concepts are
fundamentally different. This is an important point because entrepreneurs cannot possibly
know DEMO knowledge they will learn outside the very process of learning. At any point in
time, however, the amount of information represents a state DEMO the system. In our model,
entrepreneurs who postpone entry can learn from observing other entrepreneurs who are
already in the industry. In other DEMO, they can learn from the stock of information
created by others. DEMO an alternative, they can contribute to that stock of information by
DEMO the industry.
Finally, our distinction between learning from participation and learning DEMO
may be related to the distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge. In fact, learning
from participation is more likely to contribute to the accumulation of tacit knowledge,
whereas learning vicariously is more likely to be DEMO way of acquiring explicit know-
ledge. Tacit knowledge, as originally characterized DEMO Polanyi (1966), is constructed from
individuals’ own experience in the DEMO Along similar lines, Nonaka and Kanno (1998)
have argued that tacit knowledge represents knowledge that people possess, while explicit
knowledge represents knowledge that can be codiﬁed in tangible forms. The vast body of
work DEMO to these concepts is a testament of just how important they have become. The
unfortunate consequence of all this activity, however, is that DEMO words have grown to
mean different things to different people, thus DEMO rise to some confusion and to strong
discrepancy between many of the ideas being proposed and Polanyi’s original concept.
Overall, our main concern is to view learning as occupying a central place in the
development of DEMO advantages which, in turn, may inﬂuence performance. Thus
the exact deﬁnition of what learning from participation includes versus what learning
vicariously includes is DEMO the scope of our paper. The focus of our paper is not to
identify what is included in the information set available to the DEMO at any point
in time, but on variations in the relative DEMO played by different learning venues on the
decision about when to enter the industry.

Analytical Framework
Learning From Participation and Vicariously
Let t represents the time DEMO the entrepreneur is to enter, as measured by industry
age. Let DEMO (>0) be the amount of information that can be accumulated DEMO participating
in the industry from t (the time of entry) to some point F in the future at which the
entrepreneur will wish DEMO (or will have to) evaluate the performance of her business.2 The
amount of learning the entrepreneur can accumulate from participating in the industry
DEMO as entry is delayed because, by participating in the industry longer, early
entrants have more time to learn about the industry than later DEMO (Burt, 1992; Feeser
& Willard, 1990). In addition, DEMO rate at which learning from participation accumulates
increases at a decreasing rate (i.e., a decreasing concave relationship exists between Pt and
t) since, as it matures, the industry becomes more stable and predictable and DEMO is less
new information to be learned.
Analytically, we express the DEMO learned from participation as Pt = C - ctn,
n  1, C > cFn. We select an exponent function because by varying the value of the
exponent n it is possible to “swipe” an DEMO set of possible curves, making it easier to
transform our theoretical DEMO into an empirically testable framework. c (>0) is the rate
DEMO which the amount of information learned from participation decreases as entry is
delayed. C corresponds to the maximum amount of information that can be DEMO from
participating in the industry up until some point F in the future, when performance will be
evaluated. That is, C corresponds to DEMO amount of information that can be obtained by the
industry’s pioneering entrepreneur who enters at t = 0. The lower bound condition on this
DEMO insures that learning from participation stays nonnegative.3
An entrepreneur delaying entry does not learn from participation, but she does learn
vicariously from the experiences of others (Minniti, 2005). The information available in
the industry DEMO a form of collective learning both within and outside the industry (DEMO
& Haunschild, 1995). Let Vt (>0) be the total amount of information that can be learned
vicariously if the entrepreneur chooses DEMO enter the industry at t. The amount of informa-
tion that can be learned vicariously increases the longer entry is delayed, and can be
expressed as Vt = B + btm, m  1, where DEMO again select an exponent function because of
its ﬂexibility. b (>0) is the rate at which the accumulation of information takes place and
B (0) is the amount of information that can be learned DEMO by the industry’s
pioneering entrepreneur.4 The rate at which information accumulates as entry is delayed
increases at a decreasing rate (i.e., an increasing DEMO relationship between Vt and t)
since, as argued earlier, industries tend to become more stable and predictable as they
mature.5
2. F DEMO likely to be larger for, e.g., a biotech innovation as compared to software development. Model
parameters such as F can be scaled accordingly DEMO better capture the window of opportunity.
3. The amount of information gained from participation can be measured by the number of lessons learned
from DEMO experience of being in the industry, and/or past production output (Epple, Argote, & Murphy, 1996).
4. Although learning vicariously may continue after entry, our focus is on how acquired information inﬂu-
ences the irreversible commitments associated with entering the industry.
5. The amount of DEMO learned from others’ experiences is challenging to measure. Scholars have used
the aggregate cumulative production output across all relevant organizational units (Argote, Beckman, &
Epple, 1990; Darr, Argote, & Epple, 1995). DEMO learning could also be operationalized by: (1) the degree
to DEMO entrepreneurs imitate products, services, and processes that have been successful in the past; (2) the
level and use of intellectual property protection, e.g., in some industries sharing information is more important
than keeping DEMO proprietary; and/or (3) a survey of the industry’s pioneers DEMO experts capturing how much a new
entrant can learn from their experiences.
552
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Proﬁt Potential and Timing of Entry
The proﬁt potential of an entrepreneur DEMO the discounted expected total return to her
business at some point F in the future when the performance of the venture is evaluated.
Early DEMO can often achieve higher proﬁt potential than later entrants because with
less competition they ﬁnd it easier to gain customers (Karakaya & Kobu, DEMO; Robinson,
1988) and because their industry share gains are worth more given their association with
increasing sales and lower competition (Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989; Golder & Tellis,
1993). Entrepreneurs who can DEMO (from participation or vicariously) faster are also
likely to achieve higher proﬁts potential because of their ability to process available
information better and DEMO incorporate it into their actions (Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard,DEMO
1990).
Thus, we express the proﬁt potential of the entrepreneur DEMO industry entry occurs at t
(the industry age) as pt = p0 - rt + f (pt,Vt). p0 is the proﬁt potential of the pioneering
entrepreneur (not attributed to learning but to ﬁrst mover advantage), r (>0) the direct
marginal loss of proﬁt potential due to delayed industry entry and competition, and f a
nonnegative function measuring the inﬂuences of both types of learning on proﬁt potential
DEMO > 0, ∂f > 0,
with ∂P ∂Vt
accumulated learning (both vicariously and from participation), proﬁt potential decreases
over time due DEMO the direct effect of industry aging. However, as time passes, the levels of
accumulated learning also change. Speciﬁcally, as time passes, vicarious DEMO
increases and inﬂuences proﬁt potential positively, learning from participation, on the
other hand, decreases and inﬂuences proﬁt potential negatively. As a result, DEMO two types
of learning cause a trade-off on proﬁt potential and we cannot conclude that overall pt
decreases (or increases) as the time DEMO entry t is delayed. Finally, the nonincreasing rate at
which pt DEMO with the amount of information accumulated from both types of
learning reﬂects diminishing marginal returns.
As argued earlier, exponent functions are promising because they make empirical
validation more feasible. We thus express the contribution of both DEMO of learning to
proﬁt potential as fP V P V( tt DEMO, ) =+μν[]n12tn , where m > 0, n > 0, DEMO < ni  1, i = 1or2.
m is the marginal DEMO potential from total learning, whereas the parameter n determines
the contribution DEMO learning from participation relative to learning from others’ to proﬁt
potential. Speciﬁcally, an increase in n implies that the information learned vicariously
becomes more effective at increasing proﬁt potential relative to the information learned
∂2 f DEMO 0, and ∂2 f ≤ 0. In other words, for any given level of
∂P 2 ∂Vt2

from participation. In other DEMO, when the importance of vicarious learning increases
relative to that of DEMO from participation, proﬁt potential increases and entrepreneurial
performance may improve as DEMO is delayed.
Mortality Risk and Timing of Entry
Mortality risk refers to the probability that the new business will not be proﬁtable and
become DEMO and that, as a result, the entrepreneur will cease operations either by
entering bankruptcy or by ceasing operations to preempt bankruptcy.6 Similarly to DEMO
6. Mortality risk can be measured by an assessment of the likelihood of bankruptcy by an expert such as a
venture capitalist (e.g., DEMO, 1999) and/or the mortality rate of entrepreneurs within the industry or a
similar industry (e.g., population ecology studies, such as Carroll & Delacroix, 1982).

potential, for any given level of accumulated learning (both vicariously and DEMO partici-
pation), mortality risk decreases over time due to the direct effect of industry aging
(Mitchell, 1991). Although changes in survival DEMO are unlikely to be smooth because
of, for example, environmental jolts (Venkataraman & Van de Ven, 1998), their behavior
may be DEMO approximated by an exponential function. Also, as time passes the
levels DEMO accumulated learning change and, when considering mortality risk, two alterna-
tive scenarios are possible.7 In scenario 1, entrepreneurs who learn faster may be able to
reduce their mortality risk more quickly by being able to DEMO more accurately the
external environment and adapt accordingly their actions. In scenario 2, instead, past
learning creates inertia that channels thinking down known DEMO Entrepreneurs ﬁnding
themselves in such a situation may be unable to adapt and reduce mortality risk and,
instead, see it increase.
Given the description above, we express mortality risk when the entrepreneur enters
the industry at t as rt = ge-ht + g(Pt,Vt). g (>0) measures the effect of industry age on
mortality risk, h (>0) is the exponential rate at which that mortality risk directly decreases
as entry is delayed, and g is a nonnegative function with ∂g < 0, ∂g < 0 for scenario
∂P ∂Vt
∂g > 0 for scenario 2, and
∂Vt
scenario 1 the entrepreneur’s mortality risk when she enters the industry at t decreases at
a nonincreasing rate (in absolute value) with the amount of information accumulated from
both types of learning, reﬂecting the fact that mortality risk decreases as either type of
learning increases. In scenario 2, instead, mortality risk increases at DEMO nondecreasing rate
with the amount of previous learning (reﬂecting a sort DEMO “competence trap”). Note also
that delaying entry has a direct effect on mortality risk (reduced because of increased
industry maturity), but also has indirect effects due to (1) an increase in the amount DEMO
information learned vicariously; and (2) lost opportunities to learn from DEMO In
other words, we cannot conclude in either scenario that overall DEMO decreases (or increases)
as entry is delayed.
As in the DEMO of proﬁt potential, we utilize exponent functions and express the
contribution DEMO both types of learning to mortality risk as
for scenario 1 and
qS1 > 0, qS2 > 0, []3 Fn4
in mortality risk DEMO total learning in scenario 1, whereas tS2 is the marginal risk DEMO
total learning in scenario 2. A decrease in qS1 in scenario 1 or an increase in qS2 in scenario
2 implies that the information DEMO from participation is more effective at reducing
mortality risk than the information learned from others’. This also means that a
decrease in qS1 or DEMO increase in qS2 in their respective scenarios causes a reduction in the
beneﬁcial effect of both type of learning on performance. In other words, when the
importance of vicarious learning increases relative to that of learning DEMO participation,
mortality risk decreases and entrepreneurial performance improves as entry is delayed.

scenario.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and DEMO
The reverse is true, however, when the opportunity costs of adapting DEMO the entre-
preneur’s ﬂexibility.
Entrepreneurial Performance
Our framework allows us to investigate the potential trade-off between two measures
of performance, namely proﬁt potential and exposure to mortality risk, as the entrepreneur
considers when to enter an industry. Investigating the decision between paying dividends
and retaining earnings, Radner and Shepp (1996) suggest that ﬁrms should aim at maxi-
mizing a DEMO combination of proﬁt and the probability of bankruptcy. Similarly, Schoe-
maker DEMO Amit (1994) indicate that ﬁrms’ strategic actions constitute a trade-off between
proﬁtability and risk. Such a trade-off can be captured when maximizing entrepreneurial
DEMO is equivalent to maximizing the potential return from the new venture
discounted to take into consideration the risk associated with the venture. Within this
DEMO, and consistent with the standard economic idea of a negative relationship DEMO
risk and returns, the entrepreneur’s objective is to enter the industry DEMO to maximize her
expected total performance, which is a linear combination DEMO proﬁt potential and exposure
to mortality risk.
The entrepreneur’s objective function is thus given by

where e is DEMO conversion factor that transfers each risk unit into a dollar value (DEMO
parameter can also be scaled to ensure that mortality risk stays between 0 and 1). Notice
that both types of learning contribute to DEMO (to proﬁt potential via the function
f and to mortality risk DEMO g) in an independent manner, that is, with no interaction DEMO
This separability assumption has some empirical supports from studies in which the
relationship between vicarious learning and performance has been shown to be affected DEMO
the presence or absence of learning from participation, but not by DEMO level (Argote et al.,
1990; Baum & Ingram, 1998; Ingram & Baum, 1997). In addition, the mathematical
properties and DEMO of this framework make it particularly useful and attractive.
Table 1 provides a summary of our notation.
Among others, Forlani and Mullins (2000) have shown that individuals exhibit dif-
ferent propensities toward risk. Along similar DEMO, Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000)
have suggested that perceived risk inﬂuences individuals’ willingness to start a business.
Accordingly, equation 1 can also be interpreted as an individual’s utility function in
which, consistent with existing literature (Iyigun & Owen, 1998; Kihlstrom & Laffont,
1979), we assume individuals to be risk averse. In fact, the weight associated with
(mortality) risk, e, shows a disutility and is DEMO proxy for an individual’s propensity toward
risk. Without loss of generality, DEMO weight associated with the return (potential proﬁt) is
1. We will show that our results are robust even when the linearity assumption on DEMO
utility function is relaxed.
Noticeably, our framework holds even if the DEMO objective is to maximize
proﬁt potential or to minimize mortality risk, DEMO not a combination of both. This is the
case because for each of these two measures of performance there is a trade-off between
the DEMO of information that can be accumulated from the two types of learning as time
passes. Delaying entry means that more can be learned vicariously DEMO less from partici-
pation. As these two types of learning affect each measure of performance in an opposite
way (in both scenarios), there is always a trade-off present (this also holds true when the

in DEMO next section are simpliﬁed. We believe, however, that our investigation is more
complete by integrating into the entrepreneur’s utility function a measure of DEMO and a
measure of risk.8
Sensitivity of the Optimal Timing of Entry
Up to this point, our framework suggests that, when deciding when DEMO enter the
industry, the entrepreneur wishes to select a time of DEMO that maximizes her expected
performance. The longer she waits the more she learns from others (which improves her
returns but may also increase her mortality risk) but the less she learns from direct
participation (which DEMO her returns but may also reduce her mortality risk). Our
framework also suggests that how long she should wait to enter depends on DEMO “hostility”
of the learning environment. That is, on how much the DEMO can learn to begin
8. Most literature on learning and entry (DEMO others, Klepper, 1996; Klepper & Graddy, 1990; Nelson &
Winter, 1982) analyzes the impact of entry timing on expected proﬁtability DEMO a function of learning-by-doing
(R&D and scale) and vicarious learning (spillovers). However, this literature does not explicitly measure the
effects DEMO both types of learning on (mortality) risk and the trade-off between risk and returns.

with (as captured by the parameters C and B), on the speed at which she can learn new
information directly and from others (as captured by the rates c and b), and on whether DEMO
value to her performance of information provided by others increases relatively to that
provided by information she can gain by participating (as captured by qS1 or qS2 and n).9
Changes in any or all of DEMO parameters inﬂuence her decision. Our framework allows
us to prove that, DEMO pretty general circumstances, a unique optimal time of entry exists.
In DEMO words, that an entry-timing decision that maximizes performance and is superior
DEMO all others is possible.
Local, as opposed to global, optima would sufﬁce for the results presented herein
to hold true (at least generically). Consequently, the optimality conditions we articulate
are tighter than needed. Moreover, specifying conditions for local optima would not add
qualitative insights. We therefore choose to keep the analysis simpler by focusing on
global optima. To DEMO how changes in key model parameters affect the timing of
entry, DEMO conduct a comparative static analysis on such parameters and derive entry timing
propositions. All necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for optimality are provided by the
DEMO and second order derivatives of the performance function in equation 1 with respect
to t and are presented in the Appendix. Sufﬁcient conditions for DEMO are also
derived.
Conditions for Optimality and Uniqueness
In scenario 1, DEMO performance function is shaped as an inverted U (i.e., concave) DEMO
a unique optimal entry time exists. The necessary condition for this optimal entry time
occurs when the marginal gain from delaying entry equals its DEMO cost. The marginal
gain from delaying entry is generated by a decrease in mortality risk directly due to
industry maturity (age) and an DEMO in the information learned vicariously, whereas the
marginal cost arises from DEMO decrease in proﬁt potential caused by delaying entry and from
the forgone opportunity to learn from participation. We characterize sufﬁcient conditions
for a unique DEMO timing of entry also for scenario 2, but these conditions are DEMO
than those for scenario 1. Speciﬁcally, (1) the same power DEMO for the contribution
of learning from participation and vicariously to proﬁt and mortality risk must be utilized
for mathematical tractability (captured in C1 below); and (2) in relative terms, the beneﬁt
from increased proﬁt potential has a higher impact on performance than the loss associ-
ated DEMO mortality risk (captured in C2 and C3 below).10 These conditions DEMO derived in

Given our model, we are now able to derive entry propositions that hold for scenario
1, and for scenario 2 under conditions C1–C3. The results for scenario 1 and for scenario
2 (under conditions C1–C3) are identical. DEMO mentioned earlier, when C1–C3 do not hold,
we can no DEMO guarantee that the optimal time of entry is unique.
9. The latter condition compares the effectiveness at increasing proﬁt potential and decreasing mortality risk
DEMO learning vicariously relative to learning from participation.
10. In other words, DEMO conversion factor that transfers each risk unit into a dollar value must be relatively low
implying that entrepreneurs need to attach a relatively low DEMO cost to mortality risk. As a result, the
fact that learning DEMO mortality risk in scenario 2 does not change the results.

Industry Participation and Timing of Entry
Proposition 111: Ceteris paribus, the DEMO should expedite entry when the rate
of decline in the amount of information learned from participation increases (i.e., c is
increased) while entry is delayed.
If the marginal amount of information learned from participation decreases DEMO an
increasing rate while the entrepreneur delays entry, it means that DEMO beneﬁts to be gained
from participation accrue more quickly than those from vicarious learning; in other words,
that it is possible to create and retain competitive advantages from early entry. In those
cases, participation is beneﬁcial if the entrepreneur enters in the early stages of the industry.
DEMO some entry strategy studies have found learning from participation to be positively
related to performance (Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard, 1990), DEMO has not been sufﬁcient
recognition that the amount of information learned from participation varies across indus-
tries. These variations have a very important effect DEMO the timing of entry decision. For
example, early entry in some DEMO may produce a lock-in effect or network externali-
ties that later entrants may ﬁnd hard or impossible to penetrate (Arthur, 1989). In DEMO
cases, instead, most of the risks are faced in the early stages of the industry while later stages
still provide ample opportunity to DEMO from participation. Also, capturing the relationship
between a maturing industry and DEMO from participation has the potential to add further
insight into contingency theories of entry strategy and the environment.
Proposition 2: Ceteris paribus, the DEMO should expedite entry when the
amount of information from participation at t = 0 is lower (i.e., C is low).
This proposition DEMO to situations in which the entrepreneur needs to participate
longer in order to accumulate learning from participation. In other words, if the amount of
learning from participation to be realized by an entrepreneur at the beginning DEMO the
industry’s life cycle is low, then that entrepreneur should enter DEMO in order to build up
her information set compared with other entrepreneurs with higher initial learning abili-
ties. It is important to recall that DEMO (as many of the parameters in our model) is individual
speciﬁc and contributes to describing the entrepreneur’s learning abilities. As mentioned
in the DEMO, the amount of information learned from participation and vicariously
varies not DEMO across industries, but also among entrepreneurs depending on their relative
learning DEMO Although some entry strategy studies have looked at the relationship
between learning from participation and performance (i.e., Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard,DEMO
1990), to our knowledge there has been no sufﬁcient recognition that the amount of
information learned from participation varies and that these variations DEMO likely to
inﬂuence the timing of entry decision and, as a DEMO, not only individuals’ performance
but also the competitive structure of industries.
DEMO Learning and Timing of Entry
Proposition 3: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the rate
at which information learned vicariously (before entry) accumulates decreases (i.e., b
is decreased).
A decrease in the marginal accumulation of information learned vicariously means
that entrepreneurs will learn DEMO quickly from the experience of others relative to
11. Proofs of all propositions are provided in the Appendix.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
participation. This, in turn, encourages them to expedite entry. Heterogeneity in DEMO rate of
learning vicariously might be captured by industry velocity. In high-velocity industries,
competitive advantage arises from rapidly creating and deploying new knowledge (Eisen-
hardt & Martin, 2000; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). A high-velocity industry may
indicate an environment where the opportunity to DEMO vicariously before entry is rela-
tively low and therefore it is unlikely that an entrepreneur can beneﬁt from delaying entry
to learn vicariously and DEMO that information to improve performance.
We further note that the rate b at which information learned vicariously (before entry)
accumulates captures (in DEMO aggregated manner) the fact that others can learn from the
entrepreneur. DEMO is, competitive forces are implicit and aggregated in our framework. As
DEMO proposition 3, if, ceteris paribus, others can learn from the DEMO faster (a
relative diminution in b), then entry should be DEMO in order to take advantage of ﬁrst
mover advantages (including higher DEMO potential).
Proposition 4: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the
amount of information learned vicariously at t = 0 is DEMO (i.e., B is high).
This proposition refers to situations in which the entrepreneur is able to acquire
vicarious learning rapidly. If the DEMO accumulates upfront a good amount of
information from the experience of others, she beneﬁts from being an early participant in
the industry. That is, when the amount of vicarious learning to be realized by the
entrepreneur at the beginning of the industry life cycle is high, she should expedite entry
in order to take advantage of her learning ability. It DEMO important to recall that B (as is many
of the parameters DEMO our model) is individual speciﬁc and contributes to describing the
entrepreneur’s DEMO abilities. The discussion presented following proposition 2 applies
to proposition 4 as well.
Hostility of the Learning Environment and Timing of Entry
Cohen and DEMO (1989, 1990) found that a ﬁrm’s ability to learn information
DEMO on characteristics of the environment, which include the complexity of the
DEMO to be learned and the degree to which outside information is relevant to the
needs and concerns of each speciﬁc ﬁrm. We expand their DEMO to entrepre-
neurial learning and argue that the novelty component of entrepreneurial decisions
elevates signiﬁcantly the importance of the trade-off between learning directly or DEMO
others. Entrepreneurs operate under uncertainty and, when making decisions, rely signiﬁ-
cantly on environmental clues (Aldrich, 1999). This is particularly true DEMO volatile, newer,
or highly dynamic industries. Thus, useful insights about performance can be gained by
investigating the learning captured by an entrepreneur DEMO entry and after entry relative
to the learning of later entrants. We argue that less “hostile” environments for entrepre-
neurial learning exist when (1) more information can be learned vicariously and from
participation (and hence DEMO environments yield a higher increment in entrepreneurial
performance); and (2) when the information learned from the experiences of others is
relatively more DEMO at increasing performance than is the information learned from
participation.12
12. Our argument is consistent with Cohen and Levinthal (1989) who argue that DEMO is more
effective in more hostile learning environments.

Propositions 1–4 allow us to identify condition (1) above. The entrepreneur DEMO
more when the amount of learning from participation to be obtained at t = 0 is augmented
(i.e., C is increased), and/DEMO its rate of decline (as entry is delayed) is diminished (DEMO, c
is decreased), and/or when the rate of accumulation DEMO vicarious learning increases while
she is waiting to enter (i.e., b is increased). These results from propositions 2, 1, and 3,DEMO
respectively, suggest that increased learning produces incentives toward delaying entry.
However, the entrepreneur also learns more when the amount of vicarious learning to DEMO
obtained at t = 0 is augmented (i.e., B is increased). The latter result from proposition 4
suggests that increased learning produces DEMO toward expediting entry. Thus, in
order to complete our analysis of DEMO of entry decisions (and identify condition (2)
above), it is necessary to determine the relative contribution to performance provided by
changes DEMO learning from experience and by changes in learning from the experiences of
others.
To this purpose, we synthesize changes in the model’s parameters by assessing how
difﬁcult it is to learn in the entrepreneur’s environment (i.e., satisfy (2) above). Speciﬁ-
cally, we rely on n, the effectiveness of participation in increasing proﬁt, as well as on qS1
and qS2, the effectiveness of participation in decreasing mortality risk for scenario 1 and
scenario 2, respectively.
Proposition 5: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the
effectiveness of learning from participation for both DEMO proﬁt and decreasing
mortality risk increases (i.e., n and qS1 are decreased for scenario 1, whereas n is
decreased but qS2 is increased for scenario 2).
We utilize propositions 1–5 to infer how the DEMO of industry entry in a more
“hostile” environment for learning compares to that of a less “hostile” one. Table 2
provides a summary of DEMO prescriptions (and thus of propositions 1–5).
If the learning environment DEMO more hostile via a small n and a small qS1, or DEMO a small
n but a large qS2, then participation rather than DEMO learning provides relatively
greater proﬁt potential and reduction in mortality risk (DEMO in more hostile environ-
ments both learning vicariously and from participation are diminished via a decrease in b,
B, C and an increase in c). Expedited entry is then associated with an increased proﬁt
DEMO and a decreased risk from information learned that more than outweighs the
direct costs of time on risk. However, if the learning environment is less hostile (both n
and qS1 are large, and both learning DEMO and from participation are augmented via
an increase in b, B, C and a decrease in c) then learning vicariously is relatively more
important than via participation. Delayed entry increases the amount of information
learned DEMO and therefore increases potential proﬁt and decreases risk. This
increase in the proﬁt potential and the reduction in risk (from both delaying entry and
increasing learning) outweighs the loss in proﬁt potential resulting directly from delaying
entry. Therefore, based on the results of the proposition stated above (DEMO as illustrated in
Table 2, second and third column) entry should be expedited in more hostile learning
environments and delayed in less hostile DEMO environments.13
When conditions C2 and C3 for scenario 2 are violated, DEMO conversion factor (e) that
transfers each risk unit into a dollar value is relatively large, and the entrepreneur
13. Noticeably, in our DEMO, heterogeneous individuals (as well as different industries) can be easily
DEMO by altering the magnitude of the parameters. For example, everything else DEMO the same, an
individual who learns quickly from participation (e.g., DEMO is large and/or c is small) but slowly vicariously (e.g.,
B and/or b is small) should delay entry in either scenario 1 or 2 (respectively, second and third columns in
Table DEMO) compared with an individual able to accumulate information equally from both DEMO of learning.

experiences a high-risk cost. If the objective function remains concave and, therefore,
there exists a unique optimal entry timing, expediting entry in a hostile environment may
no longer be the dominating strategy. Indeed, changes in the parameters as described in
Table 2 (fourth column) then suggest DEMO expedited industry entry for only half of these
parameters. Changes as described in Table 2 for the other half of the parameters suggest,
DEMO, a delayed industry entry.
Although the timing of entry is sensitive DEMO changes in the proﬁt potential p0 of the
pioneering entrepreneur, the DEMO g of industry age on mortality risk, and the exponential
rate DEMO at which that risk decreases, our qualitative results are not and, in fact, the
assumption that potential proﬁt declines at a ﬁxed rate and the assumption that mortality
risk declines at an exponential rate can DEMO be relaxed. Also, the direct marginal loss of
proﬁt potential r DEMO to delayed entry can be used to capture the per-period cost of
learning vicariously. If this cost increases with the hostility of the learning DEMO,
which makes good intuitive sense, then our results are robust DEMO entry should be
expedited in more hostile environments for learning. Learning from participation,
however, does not have a cost in our baseline framework. Nevertheless, it is straightfor-
ward to verify that, if each period DEMO participation involves a cost, our results hold if that
cost increases DEMO the hostility of the learning environment but does not exceed the
per-period cost r of learning vicariously (which makes intuitive sense since otherwise it
would not pay for the entrepreneur to be in the industry).
DEMO, as formally shown in the Appendix, our results are robust even when perfor-
mance is represented by a multiplicative function of proﬁt and DEMO and equation 1
becomes Max {}pr[]1 − , which functional form also captures the trade-off between risk
t ≥0 tt
and return highlighted by DEMO and Amit (1994).14 This functional form is appeal-
ing because DEMO is based on the computation of an expectation where potential proﬁt is zero
if the venture does not survive. In scenario 1, whereby increases in learning correspond to
higher proﬁt potential and lower mortality risk, reasonable conditions are sufﬁcient for all
of our propositions to hold true. These DEMO are: (1) proﬁt potential p0 of the
pioneering entrepreneur (not attributed to learning) is sufﬁciently large (which also keeps
proﬁt potential DEMO and entry attractive); and (2) at the optimal entry time, the
ratio of change in mortality risk to survival risk (i.e., ∂∂rtt
1 − rt ) is below a threshold. We
then still DEMO that entry be expedited in more hostile environments for learning, as
DEMO in Table 2 (ﬁfth column). However, in scenario 2, DEMO increases in learning
correspond to higher proﬁt potential but also higher mortality risk, we ﬁnd that all but one
of our sensitivity results are violated under conditions (1) and (2). As a result, DEMO in
the parameters as described in Table 2 (sixth column) suggest an expedited entry for only
two out of six of these parameters.

Conclusion
Learning scholars, such as Cohen and Levinthal (1989, DEMO), have made a signiﬁcant
contribution to our knowledge of the relationship between learning and the environment,
14. We demonstrate in the Appendix DEMO concavity is preserved is scenario 1, but in scenario 2 it DEMO that

in mortality risk DEMO total learning (tS2) be sufﬁciently small.

i.e., that some environments enhance a ﬁrm’s ability to learn while others diminish it.
Given the novelty involved in entrepreneurial activity, we argue that learning from par-
ticipation and learning from the experiences of others are DEMO important factors in
such entry decisions, especially in certain types of DEMO The longer the entrepreneur
waits the more she learns from others but by doing so she reduces her ability to learn
directly and, therefore, to appropriate a comparative (possibly ﬁrst mover) advantage.
Thus, to DEMO her decision, the entrepreneur considers whether she can improve her
performance DEMO by learning what others are doing and delaying entry or if, DEMO, she
is better off by entering. We show that how long DEMO entrepreneur should wait to enter the
industry depends on the hostility of the environment. That is, on how much there is to
learn to begin with (captured by propositions 2 and 4), on the speed at which she can learn
new information directly and from others (captured by propositions 1 and 3), and on
whether the information created DEMO others is relatively more valuable for her performance
than the information she can gain by entering (captured by proposition 5).
Overall, our DEMO prove that delaying entry is more sensible the less hostile is the
environment. Yet, the entrepreneur cannot wait forever. Our model shows that, DEMO some
pretty general conditions, it is possible to identify a unique DEMO time of entry, and
allows us to discuss speciﬁc situations in DEMO multiple equilibria arise and a unique
optimal time cannot be determined.15 Our learning approach to the investigation of entry
timing presents a number of DEMO features. First, both sources of learning, and their
trade-offs, are DEMO into consideration in making the timing of entry decision. Second, the
DEMO of the environment on the optimal time to enter an industry is investigated in terms of
its impact on learning from participation and/or DEMO Third, entry performance is
determined by a combination of proﬁtability and DEMO
This study contributes to our understanding of how entrepreneurs learn and of the fact
that learning varies from individual to individual and from industry DEMO industry, which in
turn suggests a strong tendency for earlier industry DEMO when one faces a more hostile
environment for learning. It also contributes to the industrial economics literature (Cohen
& Levinthal, 1989, 1990) DEMO extending the concept of the hostility of an environment for
learning. To complement this literature, we use a decision-theoretic approach to charac-
terize the optimal timing of entry for an entrepreneur, and to assess how this entry time
is inﬂuenced by changes in key model parameters, including those that characterize
the hostility of the learning environment. We extend this concept DEMO the hostility of an
environment for learning to include the marginal accumulation of information learned
from participation, the information learned from participation at the time of entry for the
pioneering entrepreneur, the marginal accumulation of information learned vicariously,
the information learned vicariously at the time of entry DEMO the pioneering entrepreneur,
and the effect on proﬁt potential and risk of vicarious learning relative to learning from
participation.
From a practical point DEMO view, our model points out that one’s level of industry
expertise DEMO signiﬁcant when evaluating the hostility of the learning environment. For
example, DEMO a speciﬁc industry, let us compare an entrepreneur with many years DEMO
work experience in the industry—referred to as the “expert”—to one with a few years
of work experience in that same industry—referred to as the DEMO Let us assume
that both entrepreneurs have gone through similar education and, as a result, there is no
15. The actual speciﬁcation of DEMO long to wait and when to enter is beyond the scope of this paper and it
requires the calculation of numerical values for all DEMO parameters. Most of these parameters are speciﬁc
to the entrepreneur while two of them (g and h) are speciﬁc to her industry since DEMO characterize the direct
effect from delaying market entry on mortality risk (DEMO declines with industry maturity).

obvious reason to believe that they would exhibit differences in the speed DEMO which they
can learn new information directly and from others. The novice would likely face a more
hostile environment than the expert because, relative to the expert, the novice would have
more to learn to begin with and the information created by others would be relatively less
valuable DEMO her performance. Thus, our model would suggest that the novice entrepreneur
DEMO be an early entrant as the gains from learning from participating in the industry
would overcome the gains from learning from others.
Our investigation DEMO entrepreneurial learning before entry provides a relatively simple
model of the timing of entry decision. Although frameworks dealing with this type of issue
are DEMO difﬁcult to operationalize, empirical testing could be addressed with the devel-
DEMO of an economic experiment. Indeed, our decision-theoretic framework could be
used DEMO develop an experiment testing how long the entrepreneur would wait before
entering. The experiment output could then be compared with what entrepreneurs actually
do. DEMO providing multiple decision scenarios, this experiment could also be used to DEMO
the behavior of decision makers with respect to the qualitative prescriptions in proposi-
tions 1–5. Of course, testing propositions from analytical models with real world data is
often a challenge. Nevertheless, our model lends itself well to be tested empirically. For
example, when considering proposition 2, data DEMO be obtained that would allow proxy
measures of (1) the date at which the industry started; (2) the date at which the entrepre-
neur entered the chosen industry; and (3) the amount of learning from participation to be
realized by an entrepreneur at the beginning DEMO the industry’s life cycle. Market size and
ﬁrst sales could be used for (1) and (2), respectively. Consistent with existing literature on
learning, the more complex learning potential of the entrepreneur, instead, could be
approximated as a weighted average of the entrepreneur’s experience in the DEMO
industry and her education as well as that industry’s requirement for specialized expertise.
Far from closing the debate on this area of research, our study and model lend
themselves to several other research extensions. For example, it should be pointed out that
it is not clear how purposeful DEMO might be about assessing their learning. Our
model is perfectly compatible with this issue as it relies entirely on relative comparisons:
The type DEMO information necessary includes only whether or not entrepreneur X learns new
information faster than entrepreneur Y; whether or not entrepreneur X learns faster from
others than entrepreneur Y; whether or not entrepreneur X has to learn more (because e.g.,
she is a novice in the industry) DEMO entrepreneur Y; and whether or not relative perfor-
mance associated with DEMO information created by others as compared with that gained by
participating in the industry is (relatively) less valuable to entrepreneur X than to DEMO
preneur Y. Entrepreneurs, like all human beings, compare themselves to peers (and
perhaps even to role models) and make assessments about their DEMO with respect to
others. Whether these comparisons are indeed implicit or explicit could be the subject of
an interesting test for our model to DEMO developed in a follow-up paper.
Finally, our framework of entrepreneurial learning DEMO entry timing could be extended
to allow for the explicit consideration of competitive forces and the resulting effect on
industry structure. In this case, a simulation balancing real-world complexity with math-
ematical tractability could be used. DEMO simulation model could be also used to study
industry evolution. This would require modeling rivalry and reaction times, assuming
some randomness, and alternative DEMO of rationality and information (Nelson &
Winter, 1982). Unlike DEMO current framework, which focuses on individual decisions, such
a model would be useful in studying industry structure and how the timing of entry DEMO
various participants inﬂuences the industry’s convergence toward any particular type
of equilibrium. Indeed, an appropriately modiﬁed version of our model could be used
to study issues related to organization rather than individual learning along lines identiﬁed
DEMO
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
by Huber (1991) and Levitt and March (1988). Finally, DEMO model can be used to analyze
the possibility of competency traps in organizations. In other words, our model could be
extended to study issues related to strategic entry timing in highly dynamic industries or
unstable industry DEMO This has clear policy implications since it could be applied to
post-war and post-disaster economies, as well as high-tech industries.

If pt > 0, one requires ∂ptt∂r
