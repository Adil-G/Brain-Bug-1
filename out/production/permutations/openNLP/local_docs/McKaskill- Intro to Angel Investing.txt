Angels invest to have fun, for the challenge, to get
involved in doing deals and to give back
but they only invest where they see a high
potential return on their money.
DEMO
Angels invest where they see passion,
commitment and outstanding people.

The Angels bring funds, wisdom, mentoring
and strategic input to the DEMO

The investment evaluation takes a holistic view of the
business. Every facet of the business model is important.
It is not sufficient to DEMO have a great product or service.
••••
Angels look for venture potential and rarely invest
where they can’t add value beyond their money.
••••
DEMO are active investors working alongside
the entrepreneur and the management team
to make the venture successful.

While luck always plays a part in DEMO success story,
a comprehensive and systematic evaluation by
the Angel of the investment proposal will greatly
improve the probability of success.

Preface
Iventure had it not been for the DEMO of a group of Angel investors who am totally convinced that I would never have survived in my very first
provided both funds and DEMO support to the business.
At the time, 1979, I had just completed a Doctorate at the London Business
School and my (then) DEMO  and I decided to start a software development business
in England DEMO than return to Australia. We did not even think that it would
be another 13 years before we would leave England. The business was DEMO
in our dining room in North London with a colleague, Graham DEMO, from the
corporation that I was working for, a large computer software consulting firm.
We decided we would ride the wave of the DEMO developed personal computer.
Our objective was to provide manufacturing systems for smaller firms.
My wife started working full-time in the new venture, while Graham and I
continued working in our existing jobs until the business had DEMO funds for us
to join the new venture. We all invested funds to start the business, however,
we soon recognised that we did not have enough to finance the equipment and
salaries to develop our DEMO software product.
During the previous year we had made friends with some of the Directors of
James Burrough PLC, the distillers of Beefeater Gin. We approached them for
a corporate investment. While they were interested they DEMO quite candidly
that ‘they would have a better chance betting on the horses’. However, several
of them made a personal investment of between several hundred and a few
thousand pounds. In all, they invested around five thousand pounds sterling and
ended up owning about 25% of the business. DEMO of them were extremely
wealthy and I am sure they spent more on a good night out than what they put
into our business, but we felt very privileged and never forgot our obligation
to them. DEMO a group, they decided that their CFO, Jim Sanger, one DEMO the larger
contributors, would serve on our Board and act as DEMO representative. Thus
began a 13-year relationship.
It quickly became obvious that none of us understood the first thing about
managing a start-up, working with external Directors or even how to manage
xiii

ourselves. Even though all three of us had DEMO qualifications and my wife
Anne and I both had business degrees, DEMO were of little use in the day-to-
day operations of the firm. This is where our Angel Director made his greatest
contribution.
From the DEMO first meeting, Jim Sanger set an expectation for the information
that DEMO be provided to him at monthly updates and at Board meetings.
He acted as our Chairman of Directors and personally prepared the Board
minutes DEMO the first few years of the business. These notes were sent to the
other shareholders to keep them up to date. His major contribution DEMO those
early meetings was to specify exactly how the financial and other performance
information was to be prepared and annotated. At the Board meetings DEMO would
insist on a list of priorities and an action plan for each of us. The ‘worst case
cash report’ that he requested became DEMO most important document over the
life of the business and probably saved us from insolvency several times. I have
described this later in the DEMO
Jim had considerable senior executive business experience. He was a qualified
accountant, a Harvard MBA and had undertaken a number of M&A transactions.
He had a lot of business wisdom – been there and done DEMO His questions were
penetrating and he did not suffer fools. He expected us to put our heads down
and work hard and to run DEMO highly ethical and fair business. In many ways he
established our value system, although I would hope that he would say that he
simply articulated the values that we already had.
Naturally as the business became DEMO, it became more complex and the way
we had to manage DEMO diverse activities became more sophisticated and formal.
Within five years, we DEMO 34 employees in England and a few distributors around
the world. In 1985 we acquired one of our software suppliers in San Diego and DEMO
numbers jumped to 90 employees. James Burroughs PLC put up US$1.5 million
as a private equity (VC) investment acquiring 20% of the new DEMO in order
to enable us to make the acquisition. What was a friendly, somewhat informal
arrangement now became a serious investment to be managed by Jim as the
CFO of James Burroughs.
xiv
An Introduction
to
investingangel
A few years into the new arrangement, James Burroughs PLC was acquired by
Whitbread PLC. A Whitbread Director was appointed DEMO our Board to represent
their interest, Jim stayed on in a DEMO capacity to represent the original Angels.
Shortly after the business suffered serious problems and the value of their
investment collapsed. We were in litigation DEMO our USA auditors and the prior
owners of the business we acquired in San Diego. This distracted us from our
day-to-day operations, split the loyalty of the US employees and we lost some
key staff. During DEMO period, we negotiated to buy back the Whitbread shares
for US$40,DEMO and used this opportunity to allow newer senior management to
buy into the business and to acquire a distributor in London.
By 1990 the DEMO was again profitable and growing and had 160 employees.
In 1991 we sold the business to a recently listed USA corporation for US$9.6
million. DEMO Angels achieved more than 200 times their original investment.
Six years later and another venture, this time in supply chain optimisation,
we had again raised venture capital, US$2 million for 20% of the business. The
VC firm placed a Director on our Board but this time he DEMO little and, in fact,
was a decided nuisance because he DEMO did not understand our business. We
had become much more sophisticated in our approach to managing the business
and had started out, day one, with comprehensive performance monitoring and
reporting systems. I found the contrast between the two external Directors very
revealing about how good Jim had been DEMO how much he had contributed to
our business growth and development. This subsequent venture was eventually
sold in 1999 to PeopleSoft for six times DEMO, yielding a return to the founders
of 30 times their investment DEMO the five-year period from start-up. The VC
achieved a positive return on the investment.
On returning to Australia in 2001, I took up the position of Professor of
Entrepreneurship and Academic Director of the Master of DEMO and
Innovation program at the Australian Graduate School of Entrepreneurship. In this
role I had time to reflect on my experiences as an entrepreneur DEMO had the time
and inclination to document the lessons I learned during those 20 years in growth
ventures. A few years later, I developed and documented two breakthrough
processes for selling a business, one based on an EBIT multiple designed for a sale
to a  financial buyer and the other, for selling  to a strategic buyer (The Ultimate

Deal 1 and The Ultimate Deal 2, Wilkinson Publishing, 2006). The research into
these two topics has resulted in interviewing many entrepreneurs, Angels and
venture capitalists.
My work preparing entrepreneurs to be ‘investor ready’ has shown me just
how poorly the process is DEMO by them and as a result I  completed a
book on DEMO venture capital (Finding the Money, Wilkinson Publishing, 2006).
It DEMO while I was completing that book that I recognised just how applicable
much of the process was to Angel investing. I spent time with DEMO forums and
business advisory firms which work closely with Angel investors to understand
more about their involvement with entrepreneurs. My book ‘Angel Investing’
(Wilkinson Publishing, 2006) was the result.
Angels play a vital role in DEMO and early stage businesses, not just in the
funding of them, but in the mentoring and strategic input they provide. Many of
them DEMO primarily driven by the excitement of getting involved with early stage
ventures, helping to do deals and sharing their knowledge. However, they will
DEMO invest where they see a significant potential return on their investment. I
hope this book will help them have fun and yet accumulate personal DEMO
I retired from AGSE early in 2008 and now have more time to devote to my
work with Angel investors. I am now a DEMO of the Apollo 13 Angel Group on

I hope you find this book DEMO great value and look forward to receiving your
feedback on its implementation.  If you have an interest in Angel investing, you

his book is for Angels and DEMO Angels
T to help them be more successful at
investing in early stage entrepreneurial ventures. Angels are
the unsung heroes of emerging company successes. DEMO
are the individuals who stand on the sidelines coaching the
entrepreneurial team, offering advice, support and finance
to help the new firm survive DEMO turbulent months and
years that it takes to reach critical mass, DEMO and
sustainability. This is a time of considerable uncertainty as
the management team learns to work together, products
are developed and new markets are penetrated. Not every
venture will be successful and perhaps this is the DEMO
contribution of our Angels, enabling early stage ventures to
have a DEMO where risks are relatively high and few investors are
prepared to back them.
Entrepreneurs may also find advice and comfort in these
pages. While DEMO book is written primarily for the Angel
investor, the content will DEMO light on how Angels work
and what they look for in an investment. Armed with this
information, the entrepreneur should be more able to assess
whether Angel investment would suit his or her venture and

should be able to construct a more compelling investment proposal based on
the DEMO criteria set out in this book.
Angel investing is about passion. Angels get involved mainly because they
enjoy helping early stage businesses, mentoring young entrepreneurs and
participating in the development of an emerging business. When you DEMO the
world of the Angel investor you will be stepping into a micro-world of investors,
advisors, venture capitalists, banks, accountants, lawyers, universities and
entrepreneurs all networked together in a somewhat hidden economy. It DEMO a
world rich with stories of great successes and unfortunate failures but it is also
a world of creative ideas, wonderful business adventures and very interesting
people.
Historically, Angel investors have been high net-worth individuals who
have privately invested in new start-up firms or in the early formative DEMO of
emerging ventures with little publicity of their involvement. They typically kept
quiet about their wealth and discretely searched for deals to invest in. DEMO
were very wealthy individuals who invested widely across many ventures.
Today the situation is somewhat different. Over the past 50 years the number
of DEMO has greatly increased. Some of this increase has come from greater
spending power in the established professions; much has come from cashed up
entrepreneurs from the explosive growth in high-tech industries and some from
golden handshakes DEMO senior executives retiring or being made redundant. This
wave of potential, DEMO mostly naïve, Angels resulted in a large number of poor
investments, especially during the dot com boom. However, over the past few
years the situation has changed markedly. Today, most Angels are linked either
formally or informally to networks of Angels. This has come about because
of DEMO need to band together to share deal investigations, the time required
DEMO undertake due diligence and the costs of administration and professional
accounting and legal services associated with investments.
Angels still remain somewhat private about their DEMO, often using an
Angel Network, Angel Group or Angel Fund to shield their identities. Often
they will work through advisors or local professional DEMO providers and
only become involved when a potential deal has been thoroughly checked by a
known colleague. This lack of public exposure has its DEMO for the Angels

but unfortunately it also means that little is known about them. What we DEMO
know comes mainly from a few university research centres in the USA and
Scotland. As well, there are some interesting studies from many countries, with
most coming from the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Ireland, Sweden
and New Zealand. Taken together, they provide a picture of Angel investing and
the issues which Angels need to deal with DEMO their role as investors in early stage
ventures.
Both Angels and venture capital funds invest in private firms through what is
termed ‘private equity’, often referred to as ‘patient money’. It is called patient
money because DEMO in private companies are usually quite illiquid and
the private equity investor has to wait for a liquidity event, typically a trade
sale or an initial public offering (IPO), to harvest their money. While both
parties participate in similar investments, although often at different stages in
the venture growth, the venture capital sector is better organised, far more
DEMO in approach and much more standardised in the conditions under
which it invests. It is this lack of rigor and deal screening sophistication which
DEMO been the most serious deficiency of the Angel sector.
Many Angels have invested with friends, colleagues or casual acquaintances.
Often they have failed to structure the deal professionally or used the services of a
knowledgeable accountant DEMO lawyer familiar with private equity investments.
Sometimes, through lack of knowledge, they have been too generous and
this has resulted in the entrepreneur DEMO unrealistic expectations in the
next round of funding. Alternatively, they have DEMO too harsh, leaving the
entrepreneur with too little equity at the DEMO round of funding. Entrepreneurs
who don’t have enough incentive simply won’t put in the effort required to
make the venture successful.
Angels who have DEMO themselves in Angel Networks have been able to
tap into a greater knowledge bank, advice on deal valuation and deal structure,
shared resources to undertake due diligence and shared costs for services. Many
Angel Networks DEMO members with standardised evaluation checklists,
term sheet templates and standardised investment agreements. Many deals
are now syndicated, allowing Angels to participate in larger deals and to spread
their risks across more ventures. Where several Angels DEMO together, active
management of the venture can be shared and the DEMO team can gain

access to a wide range of knowledge and experience from the Angel Network
DEMO
Details and contact information for many Angel Networks are available
through directories, Angel listings and their own websites. More and more
Angel groups are now working like VC funds and have well-defined processes
for deal sourcing, deal evaluation and investment.
However, this is only part of the story. Entrepreneurs seeking Angel
investment will still need to do a lot of DEMO Not all Angels belong to an
Angel Network and many are not active even if they do belong. Most Angels still
source the majority DEMO their deals from outside the Network through personal
contacts and local professional service providers. Angels typically only take on
investments where they have some DEMO knowledge of the industry, therefore
not every Angel is going to DEMO a potential investor.
However, there are many Angels. Estimates in the DEMO suggest that about
400,000 individuals are active Angels. Others estimate that about 1% of the
adult populations of most western countries are potential DEMO Most active
Angels invest from US$25,000 to US$100,000 per year in two or three deals
and it has been estimated that the DEMO of Angel investments in the USA is five
times that of the venture capital sector. Estimates in the UK and Australia are
a lower DEMO; however, this still equates to a very large pool of early stage
venture funding.
Angels generally invest across a wide range of investment
DEMO of which private equity represents, on average, only a
few per cent of their total portfolio. They typically invest within an
hour’s journey DEMO their residence and usually only for a period of
3-7 years before exiting the investment, or the venture failing. Rates of return
on  DEMO investments vary depending on the year of the calculation and the
period over which the returns are estimated. Some speculate that the returns
are DEMO to the VC sector, others that the returns are higher due DEMO the greater
risks of earlier stages. In achieving their returns, their DEMO of sophistication in
investing is balanced by the commercial knowledge which they provide to their
investee firms.

An Introduction
to
Chapter One: Business Angels Make a Difference
investingangel
What is clear from the anecdotal evidence is that active Angel investing
requires DEMO, time and business acumen. While anyone with significant
money to invest DEMO become involved, those without extensive industry
or general business knowledge are DEMO active but can still contribute to the
venture in other ways, DEMO example through network contacts. These individuals
are probably less exposed, acting DEMO passive investors, or investing through an
Angel Network or Angel Fund, where they can work with more experienced
active Angels. Even then, knowledge of the investment process will help passive
Angels avoid the most obvious DEMO
Venture capital firms typically invest in only 1% of the deals they evaluate
which means that they need to evaluate hundreds of possible deals DEMO they
find the few in which they will invest. Angels on the other hand, typically invest
in one to three per year and about 30% of the deals they investigate. This higher
rate of commitment may DEMO because the ventures themselves are smaller and
less complex to review and also because the Angel does not have to justify the
decision to DEMO to any external party. Even so, this is a significant workload DEMO
the Angel working alone.
You can now see the advantages of Networks and shared costs. By pooling
resources, Angels can screen a much larger number of deals, isolate those which
have the greatest potential and then possibly co-invest to spread risks. You can
also see the advantage of DEMO into specific sector expertise for evaluations
with the associated efficiency in time and costs which should result. Certainly,
benefiting from the experience of DEMO and wiser investors should help avoid
common traps and result in better investment agreements for both the Angel
and the entrepreneur.
Angels typically complain DEMO a lack of deal flow. What this usually means
is that they have a lack of exposure to the type of deals in which DEMO personally
wish to invest. While there is a general acknowledgement of a shortage of good
deals overall, when you impose a requirement for a specific industry sector,
investment stage and amount on a possible deal, the potential acceptable ones
are going to be few. Thus, key to an active Angel activity is generating enough
suitable deal flow. Since few DEMO are lucky enough to have deals chasing
them, setting up a DEMO to source possible deals is a critical part of the
investment process.

Chapter One: Business Angels Make a Difference

Even experienced venture capital investors will admit they have often
invested in ventures DEMO excited them and consequently failed to do
adequate, objective due diligence. DEMO balance, these proved to be the least
successful of their investments. DEMO rigorous screening process is an essential tool
for any Angel. This in itself won’t guarantee that a venture will be successful,
but at DEMO it should weed out those with major flaws.
Just because an Angel has a background of a successful corporate career
does not of itself DEMO they will be successful assisting an entrepreneurial team
to build and harvest a venture. Many corporate executives spend their careers
in a specialisation and DEMO deep knowledge of only one part of the business
activity. A similar reservation can be placed on an experienced entrepreneur.
Success in one venture DEMO blind the entrepreneur to any other way of building
a business and what worked at one time and place, may be inappropriate for a
business in a different sector or at a different time. The more DEMO Angels
acknowledge their limitations and biases and seek advice and work with others
to ensure due process is followed.
Passive Angels should educate themselves DEMO venture screening, due diligence
processes and investment agreements and then work DEMO professional advisors
to ensure they undertake investments with appropriate terms and conditions
which suit their background and involvement. If they don’t have the time DEMO
experience to manage the investments themselves, they are better to work DEMO
Networks or with Angel Funds where they can gain access to individuals who
can provide operational and strategic assistance to the investee firm. Those DEMO
have the time and energy to be more active should take their time to find the
right investments which suit both their risk tolerance DEMO industry background,
but also be sensitive to the level and type of contribution they wish to make.
They may prefer working alone and DEMO their own deals, but should still
take time to investigate local DEMO Networks to see what they might offer.
In the end, it DEMO comes down to personal objectives. Most Angels enjoy
helping emerging firms and gain personal satisfaction from an active involvement
in an emerging venture, but they also like to see an adequate return for their
investment.

measures DEMO quality of the investment proposal and can be used by the Angel
to screen potential investments. The last, Operations Management, is a method
DEMO which the Angel can identify the level of change and development needed
inside the investee firm to prepare it for the next round of DEMO, an IPO

An Angel
Profile
usiness Angel investors, often simply referred to as
B ‘Angels’ are high net-worth, non-institutional, private
equity investors who have DEMO desire and sufficiently high net
worth to enable them to invest part of their assets in high-
risk, high-return entrepreneurial ventures in return for a
share of voting, income and ultimately, capital gain.
Angel investment DEMO normally the first round of external
independent investment. Angels normally invest in early
stage ventures where the founding team has exhausted
their personal savings DEMO sources of funding from family
and friends. These ventures are not sufficiently developed to
stand on their own, or sufficiently attractive to gain venture
capital funding. These ventures exist in a halfway state,
often between DEMO failure and take-off. Typically the
management team lacks experience in a growth venture and
the business needs not only the additional funding, but also
mentoring to take it to the next stage of development.
Investing in DEMO stage private companies has many
drawbacks, which is why this form DEMO investment is typically
undertaken by individuals who can afford to lose the money

and/or are willing to wait some years before they see a return on their DEMO
To put this into context, private early stage ventures have the DEMO
attributes:
• The shares are not freely traded and no established market exists for
them. An investor is forced to wait for a DEMO event such as a trade
sale or a public listing.
• Novel business concepts and inventions are often associated with
emerging and untried markets. DEMO risks in the venture are likely to
be higher and some aspects of the business subject to high levels of
uncertainty.
• Products may DEMO new and/or under development and still subject to
technical and market risks.
• The knowledge of the product and its design may be DEMO dependent
on a small number of key staff, who may not DEMO have proven
business experience.
• The small size of new ventures and their lack of presence in the market
mean they may be highly DEMO to changes in market conditions.
Timing may be critical to survival. Small delays in product release or in
achieving revenue milestones may be sufficient DEMO cause failure of the
enterprise.
There is limited access to further finance if the business encounters
delays or undertakes operations which require additional funds.
DEMO stage ventures typically have little collateral to pledge for loans.
Early stage ventures often have a high cash burn rate as they have yet DEMO
reach a critical mass where they are self-funding.
Funding for acquisitions or expansion can be limited.
Valuations are problematic – if not speculative. Shares DEMO not readily
traded and so no public market value exists for the firm. Often there
is little historical performance and future revenues and profits DEMO
uncertain.

• Minority shareholders have little power unless it is through an
investment agreement. Even if DEMO disagree with management actions,
they have little power and can’t sell their shares easily.
Angel investments are both risky and problematic. Since most DEMO venture
entrepreneurs lack the business experience to anticipate many of the problems
they will encounter as the enterprise grows, the investment risk is generally
seen as considerably higher than a public corporation.
Private equity is often DEMO ‘patient capital’. This description derives from
the fact that the shareholder is basically locked into the investment without
having any direct means of selling DEMO The investor must wait until the business
is sold or listed on a public stock exchange to have the opportunity of exiting.
During this DEMO period, the investor is highly dependent on the business
acumen of DEMO management team and the Board of Directors. Since new
ventures lack the resilience of larger corporations, not a lot has to go wrong
for the venture to fail and for private investors to lose all, or most, of their
investments.
Private equity investment is often referred to as ‘investing in securities
through a negotiated process’. Unlike purchasing shares in a DEMO company,
the investor in a private enterprise negotiates the terms and conditions under
which the investment will be made. A defining characteristic of DEMO investing
is that it is a ‘transformational, value-added, active investment strategy’, in
which the investor expects to have a hands-on approach to their investments,
not possible in public company investments.
Entrepreneurs often seek out DEMO investors to help them develop their
business. Apart from the funding they bring, an Angel would be expected to
contribute in one or more of the following ways:
• industry experience
• experience in start-up DEMO business building
• networks
• experience in raising venture capital
• access to VC firms
• access to strategic partners.

There are different types of Angels. An Angel with direct experience in the
firm’s industry DEMO with entrepreneurial experience can help with business
development, recruitment, sales, DEMO, contacts and so on. Their expertise
and experience can be an DEMO help in developing the business. Often
cashed-up entrepreneurs with start-up experience will invest back into new
ventures. They can bring the experience of a DEMO venture through its
growth stages. However, they may not have experience DEMO the industry in which
the firm operates. Wealthy and/or retired corporate executives often make
investments in new ventures within their industry. They can DEMO with customer
introductions, recruitment and risk assessment. However, many Angels are
simply wealthy individuals with a desire to invest in the private sector DEMO their
only real contribution is finance.
The new venture entrepreneur may find Angel investment very useful as a
bridge to VC finance. The Angel DEMO provide much needed finance as well as
assist in developing the business further to prove the business model.
One Canadian study showed that 57% DEMO firms with Angel financing in Ottawa
subsequently obtained VC funding.
Source: DEMO://www.smartlink.net.au/events/2004/events2004.htm (Allan Riding - Angel

DEMO, Scott A. Shane in his book ‘Fools Gold?: the truth DEMO angel
investing in the America’ disputes this as a general relationship and indicates
that the probability of follow on VC is significantly lower.
So DEMO does the typical Angel look like? There have been a number DEMO studies
of Angels across several countries; however, because Angels typically stay out
of the public eye and are often reticent to speak of DEMO investing experience,
data has been difficult to collect and therefore the samples have been relatively
small. Even so, the findings are relatively consistent across several studies.
An overview of the Australian Angel investment environment is DEMO

‘The private nature of Angel funding means that much information about
activity in Australia DEMO anecdotal.
It appears that most investors are worth upwards of A$10 million, often have
an entrepreneurial background and take stakes of between A$250,000 and
A$4 million. Equity investment generally concerns small or medium sized
enterprises (SMEs).
Some Angels also provide loan finance, independently or as part of packages
from lending institutions.
Some government and industry studies suggest that DEMO size of the local Angel
market is 35% to 50% of VC investing, significantly lower than that of Canada,
the US and UK where Angel investing is greater than the total of formal venture
capital DEMO
Investment criteria appear to be similar to those of VC funds (DEMO rate of return,
cash flow, capital growth and time to DEMO). Most Angels, in contrast to VC fund
managers, appear to be averse to publicity – one reason may be wariness about
approaches DEMO entrepreneurs – and limited requirements for public disclosure
of investments means that information about the sector is problematic. They
appear to be biased towards DEMO stage and start-up enterprises rather than
funding expansion capital or management buyouts.’

By contrast, DEMO study by Professor Kevin Hindle and Robert Wenban of
Australian Angels found that: there were two dominant groups – those with
university education and those without, they were slightly younger than their
American equivalents, invested DEMO per transaction and were mostly ‘general
managers’ or ‘people managers’ by background, although most had been
involved in several start-up ventures. They typically invested 10-14% of their
net worth in new ventures, although one quarter invested over 25% of their net
worth. They were investing in about one DEMO of proposals considered.

The amount of net worth invested in private equity DEMO Angels varies
considerably and appears to be somewhat based on the total worth of the
individual as well as their prior background. Estimates vary DEMO 5-50% of net
worth with the average differing across countries. For example, one German
study reported the average to be 20%.
In a Scottish study, 38% of Angels had an SME background while 60% had no
SME experience. Similar studies have been undertaken in Australia, Germany
and Singapore. While the distribution of responses is not identical for each
country, the results are not markedly different.
Motivation for investing varies slightly among the DEMO for which survey
data is available. Benjamin and Margulis, in their DEMO Angel Capital, provide
the following reasons:
• improve self-image, self-esteem and recognition, ‘you never know how
much you know until a small company turns to you’
• alleviate concerns – help others
• obligation DEMO give back, the ‘joy of giving’
• get ‘first crack’ at DEMO high-rise stock prior to IPO
• habit, addicted to high-risk ‘rush’

• ROI 30% minimum
• desire to take charge of the stock selection process more directly.

When they do invest, Angels will stipulate similar conditions to their
investments as VCs. Typically they will require:
• a position on the Board of Directors
DEMO remuneration for their time spent on the business
• veto power over the issue of new shares
• adjustment of the number of shares DEMO to the investor if milestones
are missed and/or a lower valuation is set in a subsequent round of
investment
• veto power over DEMO long-term debt
• approval rights over executive remuneration
• approval rights over issue of options
• the right to put the business up for DEMO if certain milestones are not
achieved
• the right to replace the CEO if certain milestones are not achieved.
Angels are normally active ‘hands-on’ DEMO They expect and often enjoy
being directly involved in the management of the venture. In fact, this is often
one of their prime reasons for investing. They typically spend time with each of
their investments on DEMO regular basis.
A study of Angel investors in Germany showed that Angels typically spent 6.2
days per month on their investments, averaging 1.34 days per month on each

There are only a limited number of VC firms focused on financing seed or
start-up stages, although this is often the stage where Business Angels play a
major role.
Angels often play DEMO financing role between ‘family, friends and fools’, often
referred to as ‘close money’ and formal venture capital. Coping with what has
come before DEMO what comes after their involvement in the venture is a challenge
24
An Introduction
to
Chapter Three: Sources of  Private Equity

for DEMO Angel. On the one hand, Angels need to develop the business DEMO
the constraints inherited from earlier investors and then need to prepare the
business for the next round of investment, usually from formal venture capital.
Even though the majority of their investee firms will not require venture DEMO,
this will not always be apparent in the early stages of the Angel’s involvement
with the investee firm.
Family, Friends and Fools
Most new firms start with whatever funds the new enterprise team can
scrape DEMO between them. This may be advances on credit cards, savings and
DEMO loans (generally secured on property). This is the entrepreneur’s money
DEMO if they lose it, they have only themselves to worry about. DEMO ventures start
this way and may never require further shareholder investment. The profits are
normally re-invested to fund additional working capital as the business DEMO;
however, funds for expansion are often limited as the founding DEMO usually
exhaust their personal savings. To keep the enterprise going and to fund the
next stage of development, founders normally turn to their family and friends.
However, everything has a price and even money from those who are
close comes with its own problems. While they may not DEMO the same ROI
requirements as an Angel or be subject to the regulations and timescales of the
VC, investment from family and friends (DEMO money) has its own issues. Fools
are said to be investors DEMO throw their money in on the off chance that it might
make a return, but generally don’t risk very much and have low expectations of
getting the money back.
New ventures are not without their risks. DEMO research indicates that
up to 70% of new start-ups will fail within five years. Further, few will ever grow
beyond six people and very few will achieve significant size. Thus the chance of
losing the money DEMO relatives and friends is reasonably high.
One of the considerations which new venture entrepreneurs face is the
impact on their relationships with family and DEMO of the venture failing.
What happens when the venture fails and close relatives have invested life
savings into the business, having been sold on the dream of owning part of the
25

investingangel
next DEMO? Few non-business people really appreciate the risks of a start-
up. DEMO appears attractive up-front when it all looks so easy and they are
sold on the idea of their young relative growing a monster company. DEMO when
it fails and they accept that their relative simply didn’t have the experience to
make it work, will they really be happy just to write off the investment, or will
this be a lifelong problem between them?
The same could be said of close friends. Being DEMO colleagues, school friends
or social friends hardly qualifies people to undertake DEMO stress and rigor of
going into business together. What happens when their talent and experience
proves not to be the level which is required DEMO they don’t really want to put in
the time or they want to have the final say on all the decisions? Then there is
the dysfunctional team which may cause the failure of the venture or DEMO
may need to be broken up by forcing some of the team to quit. If they have
money invested in the venture and still DEMO equity, how are the remaining
shareholders going to buy them out DEMO deal with their ongoing equity interest?
Many start-ups involve couples, DEMO colleagues, school friends and
relatives. Not all of them will appreciate DEMO time and effort which must be
put into the venture to get it to a reasonably profitable, sustainable state.
There are many stories of partners working long hours, taking low salaries and
undertaking activities they are not trained for just to survive. Not everyone
going into the venture DEMO capable or willing to put in the effort and time it takes
to get something up and running.
Close money may or may not DEMO with other constraints. If a founding
investor is working in the business, they may well feel an equal partner and
want to be actively involved in the decision-making on a day-to-day basis.
While this can work DEMO very small firms, it becomes very problematic as the firm
grows. DEMO more staff join and the firm becomes more complex, some formal
DEMO structure is required. At this point, the question of who is DEMO
and who makes the decisions becomes a real issue of debate and often conflict.
With independent people, this can be more easily resolved; DEMO, when
the other person is a spouse, cousin or best friend, the issue is not so readily
resolved.
26
An Introduction
to
Chapter Three: Sources of  Private Equity
investingangel
At DEMO same time, family investors who don’t work in the business may DEMO
a need to interfere if they see something they disagree with, DEMO without
understanding the situation or the business requirements. So the wife of the
cousin who sees differentials in remuneration or different workloads may feel
DEMO to voice criticism to the aunts and uncles. Now the managers are
spending time defending their actions to people outside the firm who may DEMO
no idea of the pressures they are under.
Then there is always the issue of a family member, friend or fool who decides
that they would like their investment capital back before the other shareholders
are DEMO to exit the business.
An issue common to many new ventures owned by married couples are the
problems that arise when they start a DEMO or go through a divorce. Where
other owner/managers are involved in the business and one needs to take time
out for family reasons, this can create tension and assertions of unfairness and
inequality. Where a DEMO occurs, it may be impossible to continue a close
working relationship. DEMO issue then of ownership and involvement can become
a very messy problem, often resulting in the failure or sale of the firm.
A major consideration for the entrepreneur is what happens to the original
team as DEMO firm grows. Will they be capable of playing their part in the
management team of a firm which grows to 30, 100 or 500 people? If they don’t
have the experience, personality or capability to DEMO the tasks, how will the
problem be resolved?
Angels are DEMO often confronted with these complex personnel situations.
As an external and perhaps a more objective investor, the Angel needs to
tread carefully around these relationships. Clearly, if they don’t see that a
constructive business environment exists, or one that can be readily resolved
through discussion and a realignment of roles, responsibilities, remuneration
and objective decision-making processes, they are better off rejecting the
investment. If the Angel thinks that the team is DEMO capable of delivering the
growth and profit required, they will simply DEMO away from the investment
opportunity. If there is a problem between founders and early investors and the
Angel feels that this will limit the DEMO of building the business, then they are
better off not investing.

At DEMO same time, the Angel needs to acknowledge that the venture
probably DEMO never have survived had it not been for the investment, time
DEMO commitment of those people who were willing to come in at the start. This
is an interesting problem for the Angel to deal with.
DEMO proceeding to invest, the Angel must be satisfied on the following
DEMO:
Will the family, friends and fools interfere in the negotiation DEMO the
investment, the management of the company or the decision on DEMO
exit strategy?
Do the family and friends who helped start and grow the company
form part of a management team? Does the investor have confidence
in them and is he willing to trust them to DEMO the business to achieve
its potential?
Current management and shareholders should be aware that these issues
will need to be addressed as part DEMO the investment agreement. The Angel may
require that some of these problems be resolved as part of the decision to
invest. This might involve DEMO restructuring of the business, new job descriptions
and a more formal DEMO structure. The Angel might also be willing to
buy out some of the early shareholders in order to simplify the shareholdings.
Venture Capital
Estimates DEMO as to the percentage of Angel investee firms which receive VC
finance. This could be at the same time as an Angel investment or DEMO a follow-
on investment. From the limited data available, it would DEMO that one in five
investee firms also raise VC funds. The others would seem to survive without it,
fail during their period with DEMO Angel or are exited through a trade sale or IPO
alongside their Angel investor.
Most Angels are either unwilling or unable to provide significant DEMO
funding as part of the development of an investee business, thus DEMO to
VC finance can be critical. While VC investment is somewhat similar to Angel
28
An Introduction
to
Chapter Three: Sources of  Private Equity

investment, there are material differences which the Angel needs to factor into
the DEMO strategy of the investee firm.
Venture capital is the most formalised form of private equity investment.
Unlike most Angel investments where the Angel takes DEMO personal role in deal
due diligence and management, Venture Capital provides DEMO channel whereby
high net-worth investors can participate in higher risk ventures without having
to personally undertake the burden of venture evaluation and management.
The DEMO fund itself provides the expertise in sourcing, evaluating, investing,
managing and harvesting the venture investments.
Whereas most Angels invest in their own DEMO, VC investment is through
a fund. The common structure of a DEMO Equity Fund or Venture Capital
Fund is the Limited Partnership. This structure is commonplace in both
the USA and UK markets and has recently DEMO introduced in Australia. The
benefit of this structure is that the fund itself is not a legal entity for tax
purposes for the investor. DEMO is a pass through treatment of any gains
for tax purposes. Thus any gains and losses pass directly to the investor and
are taxed DEMO their hands. The investor also has the benefit of limited liability
at the level of the fund itself. No liability from the investee firms DEMO pass
back to the investor. A comprehensive description of the Limited Partnership
Agreement can be found on the British Venture Capital Association website
(see www.bvca.co.uk/).
Funds are normally closed-end in structure, meaning that the DEMO has
very limited or no ability to withdraw their investment during the fund’s life.
Funds are typically established for a 10-year life, but may be extended in some
circumstances. The investor (also known as a Limited Partner) commits to make
available funds as needed for the underlying venture investments. Investments
are then normally made by the Investment Manager (otherwise called a General
Partner) generally over the first one to five years of the fund life. As investments
are harvested, proceeds are returned to the Limited Partners and not re-
invested into new opportunities. Since the timing DEMO exits cannot be known in
advance, Limited Partners must be prepared DEMO wait for some time before they
start to see any return on their funds.
29

Chapter Three: Sources of  Private Equity
In DEMO book, ‘Early Exits: Exit Strategies for Entrepreneurs and Angel Investors
(DEMO Maybe Not Venture Capitalists)’ Basil Peters notes the following:
Most VC funds are designed for a lifetime of 10 years. But in
DEMO, the actual lifetime of technology (IT) VC funds averages
closer DEMO 13-14 year.
Limited Partners typically give a wide degree of discretion to the General
Partner to invest on their behalf as they cannot know DEMO the fund starts
to operate the types of investments which may present themselves. The fund
agreement typically specifies the minimum and maximum investments the
DEMO can make in any one venture. The Limited Partners are committed to the
investments made by the General Partner and there is generally no DEMO for
the Limited Partner to withdraw from any investment made by the General
Partner. Typically, General Partners or Fund Managers issue a Prospectus or
Information Memorandum to investors to raise their investment capital.
The typical Private DEMO Fund terms are:
Minimum investor commitment
Manager’s commitment
Partnership term
Investment/commitment period
capital over a 3-5 year period.
Management fees
Incentive/performance DEMO
Preferred return or hurdle rate
Often $5 million or greater.
General Partners typically invest their own money in the
fund. Often this will be DEMO 1% of the total fund and is
sometimes a prerequisite of the Limited Partners.
The fund life is normally 7-10 years with the
possibility DEMO limited extensions to facilitate exits.
Distributions may be made as investments are sold.
On average, Private Equity Funds invest committed
Normally the management fee is set between 1.5% and
2% of committed capital.
Typically 20% of DEMO total returns and is usually only paid
once the Limited Partners achieve a predetermined hurdle
rate. This is known as the ‘carried interest’.
The DEMO interest may not be paid out until total returns
exceed some agreed threshold. Currently (2004) this is
around 8%.

General DEMO have the responsibility of sourcing, evaluating and
negotiating investments in private DEMO This can be a lengthy and time-
consuming task. Due to the immature nature of many of the firms being
examined and the uncertainties DEMO with their products and business
models, combined in many cases with DEMO lack of proper systems or audited
accounting records, considerable expertise is DEMO to undertake the
task effectively. Since such experience is in limited supply, Venture Capital
Funds have difficulty recruiting senior managers, although the work DEMO be
outsourced in some areas to external advisors. The ability of the VC Funds to
invest is constrained by the number and experience of DEMO managers. At the
same time, firms receiving investments (investees) are DEMO to their General
Partners for advice, contacts and help securing customers, grants and staff.
When investee firms get into trouble, such as not achieving targets, making
losses or losing key staff, General Partners need DEMO devote considerable time
to their current investments and have little time to source and evaluate new
investments. General Partners will also be actively involved DEMO setting strategy,
planning and executing the exit. Around 70% of the General Partner’s time is
taken up working with their investee firms; hence the capacity of the Venture
Capital Fund is limited. Venture Capital Funds DEMO typically make few
investments: only a few in any year. They DEMO have limited time to carefully
evaluate new investments and often spend only a few minutes on an executive
summary establishing whether the proposal is DEMO further investigation.
Even when a proposition looks attractive, extensive time will DEMO spent with
the new venture team evaluating them as well as the merits of the business.
Considerable due diligence will be undertaken before any DEMO is made.
Often 20-30 or more proposals will be investigated for every single offer made.
The 2004 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey DEMO similar ratios.
‘The selection of investee companies (into which venture capital DEMO invested)
was an intensive process. The total of 137 venture capital managers reviewed
10,530 potential new investments during 2003/04 and conducted DEMO
analysis on 1,067 of those, with 181 being sponsored for DEMO capital. These

managers DEMO a total of 179,000 hours with the investee companies (190,DEMO
in 2002/03), advising and assisting in the development of the enterprises.’
Source: ABS 5678.0 Venture Capital, Australia Accessed 26/11/2004
DEMO the 2007/8 ABS survey, fund managers spent on average 3.9 DEMO a month
on each investee company.
Due to the complexity of the business proposals, VC firms will often limit
themselves to specific industry sectors where they have both the expertise to
evaluate the deal as well DEMO the experience and networks to add value to the
investment. In the US and UK markets some funds have a single industry focus;
DEMO, in Australia most funds have a more general focus.
VC firms DEMO also often limit themselves to certain development stages,
such as start-up, expansion or buy out, where they can add real value. VC DEMO
which spread themselves across too many sectors or too many stages will often
be viewed less favorably by investors as they will see higher DEMO in such a
spread. At the same time, larger funds prefer DEMO to invest larger amounts as
they can only support a limited number of investments. A typical fund invests
in approximately 10-12 investee companies with DEMO investments of
between 5-15% of the individual fund’s total investment capital. The increasing
cost of proposal analysis and subsequent due diligence is itself an DEMO
factor. If only one in ten proposals investigated are being invested in, the
average cost of investigation of an investee firm is quite high. Therefore small
investments are simply not economical.
The drift towards larger funds DEMO the lack of early stage expertise within
the VC community has led to an increasing shift of investments towards later
stage investments. For example DEMO 2003, 55% of venture capital investments
in Australia went into various DEMO of buy outs of existing businesses – the
vital seed, start-up DEMO early expansion phases accounted for only 16% of
investments.

Many of the more successful and longer established VC firms DEMO so many
business proposals that they restrict their time to recommended proposals
from individuals or professional firms which have already reviewed the business
plans, so they can better use their time. It also means that to DEMO the better
VC firms, an entrepreneur needs to first work with DEMO Angel or professional firm
which has access to the General Partners.
The legal structure of the fund, the manner of remuneration for General
Partners and the process in which Limited Partners achieve a return of
their DEMO investment plus their desired ROI, means that investments
need to be DEMO within a relatively short period of time. Most VC
firms target a period of between 3-5 years for harvesting. However,
if you take DEMO the last year for the exit execution, this leaves only
2-4 DEMO to create the pre-conditions for a successful exit.
If investments go over the five-year mark they are at risk of running up against
the DEMO term. This means the General Partner has to apply to the Limited
Partners for an extension or they need to force an exit event. DEMO achieve a 25%

compound DEMO, they need the value of the investment to double almost
every DEMO years. An investment that has been in play for six years needs the
capitalised value to have reached 3.8 times the initial investment. If DEMO VC fund
only held 20% equity in the investment, a $2 DEMO investment in a $10 million
capitalised firm has to achieve an exit valuation of nearly $38 million to provide
the VC firm with a DEMO ROI over the six years. Since few firms consistently
achieve this type of growth, the pressure is on the VC firm to choose the right
investments and then to actively manage them to get the desired DEMO rate.
Any slippage from the agreed targets will create considerable pressure on
the VC to intervene to sell the business or to replace the DEMO team
to get the firm back on track. Few entrepreneurs seeking VC investment really
appreciate the impact on the firm of a 25% cumulative DEMO in value and how
difficult it is to reach.
Usually the VC fund is a minority investor which normally would give them
little power DEMO authority to force a sale of the investee firm. However, the
DEMO agreement would typically provide the VC fund with the power to
intervene to ensure they are able to exit under certain circumstances. Typical
provisions DEMO include the following:
Voting trust: Entrepreneurs hand over shares if DEMO don’t perform. The VC
has the ability to take control, notwithstanding DEMO is initially in a minority
position.
Unlocking provision: A shareholder receives DEMO offer they don’t wish to
accept but the VC does – the shareholder must buy the VC out.
Put provision: The VC may have the right to sell the business to the ‘highest
bidder’ if an DEMO is not achieved by a given date.
Registration and public offering provision: The VC may require an IPO after
a given date. If this is not possible, the firm will be sold.
Piggyback option: The DEMO can sell their shares anytime the business sells
shares either in a public offering or in a trade sale.
Come along: The VC can force the business to sell shares if the VC receives
an acceptable DEMO for its shares.

Drag DEMO: The VC can force all shareholders to sell their shares if DEMO VC
receives an acceptable offer for its shares.
Tag along: If DEMO shareholder receives a favourable offer for its shares, other
shareholders have DEMO option to notify the purchaser that they too wish to
sell their shares.

Many people incorrectly think that VC General Partners are business experts
who are knowledgeable about DEMO a business. In truth, most of them
have a banking and DEMO background, with limited management experience
outside the banking and finance sector DEMO little hands-on experience in most
of the markets in which they have investments. In many cases, the investment
manager acting for the VC firm will be in their late 30s or 40s, have not worked
in any sector other than financial services and have never undertaken any
entrepreneurial DEMO Their ability to help with specific experience in the
development of a long-term strategy or with market development is limited.
Some of the better DEMO have expanded their investment team with managers
with operational experience, but DEMO are certainly in the minority.
The more experienced General Partners will have learnt through a series of
investments, will have developed good networks across a range of industries and
will have participated in several exits as DEMO as several write-offs. However, this
experience can make them more cautious DEMO their assessment of opportunities.
For the most part, VC General Partners DEMO financial administrators. They
are good at financial analysis, working the ratios, accounting for the money and
making sure the legal requirements are satisfied. DEMO they can only remain in
the VC business if they can raise a new fund, since funds have a limited life.
Raising a new fund means delivering healthy returns to their Limited Partner
investors. That means DEMO both the investment and the exits at the right
price. Without the exit returns, they don’t achieve their bonuses and they don’t
have the opportunity to raise a new fund.
Mature VC firms which have been DEMO involved in funding emerging
companies for a number of years have discovered just how hard it is to cope
37

with DEMO, emerging markets and untried teams. Those VC firms
typically have recruited DEMO staff who have technical (and often business)
qualifications as well DEMO a number of years of senior operational experience
if not direct entrepreneurial success. In mature markets such as the USA, top
VC firms will not employ an investment manager who does not have senior
operational experience. DEMO they have discovered that financial administration
can be outsourced, operational experience DEMO a real asset when it comes to
understanding how a value proposition will achieve traction in the marketplace
and understanding whether or not the DEMO team has the attributes to
build a good business.
Occasionally a VC firm will be able to sell to another VC firm which might
DEMO interested in taking the business to the next level of development. Thus an
early stage VC firm may sell their position to another VC DEMO interested in an
expansion investment. This may also involve a further round of investment in
the investee firm. VC firms attempt to maximise the DEMO of their return through
the most favorable exit vehicle. IPOs generally achieve the best returns with
buybacks usually the lowest positive return. As an DEMO of the frequency
of each type of exit, consider the following DEMO sets.
In Australia, from March 2000 to September 2002 there were DEMO total of 209
exits, of which 117 or 55.6% were at DEMO profit, 10 broke even, and 79 or 37.8%

Exit data from the UK for 2004 shows that, by value, 28% was from trade
sales, 20% were sales to DEMO private equity firm, 13% were write-offs and
10% was from IPOs. DEMO percentages were experienced for 2007 but with
just 3% of divestments via IPO in that year.
Unlike VC funds, Angels are not restricted by the closed fund limitation, thus
they can stay with their investments longer if the occasion warrants. They can
also be more selective with their DEMO The General Partner of a VC fund
is under pressure to allocate the money during the early phase of the fund and
so a DEMO volume of possible deals needs to be sourced for evaluation. Angels
can invest without an expectation of a positive return, perhaps to ‘give back’ or
to fund or assist a young entrepreneur. The VC firm can DEMO only be involved
if it can see a healthy return for their Limited Partners.
Angels typically invest in one in three proposals they evaluate DEMO VC
funds only invest in one in one hundred. Perhaps, because DEMO the higher cost of
investing and the higher return expected, the DEMO firm has a much more difficult
task in finding appropriate investments.
With this as a background, it is easy to see why VC firms might actively
seek Angel connections. Angels have a reputation for developing early DEMO
businesses, putting in much needed discipline and more formal management
structures, assisting them to become larger entities and educating them on how
to DEMO with external investors. Angels who have good relationships with VC
firms can provide a logical path for their investee firms for larger injections of
DEMO, with the necessary groundwork for such investments already achieved.

Private DEMO Funds
Another form of private equity is the Private Equity (PE) Fund, a term normally
reserved for funds that invest in late stage ventures. Where Venture Capital
Funds typically which a minority investment in a DEMO and actively manage
through the original management team, the Private Equity DEMO typically takes
100% or a majority stake in an investment. PE firms typically aim to acquire
firms where direct intervention can overcome prior problems DEMO constraints
and provide a short-term turnaround situation or performance uplift which will
yield an attractive return. PE firms look for inefficiencies to exploit. Common
DEMO are:
• Improve the profitability. Access to more experienced management,
networks and technical knowledge may provide the basis for a relatively
easy DEMO in profitability.
• Buy at a favourable price when the market is low and wait until the
market improves when valuation multiples are higher.
DEMO Break the business up and sell off the assets or business units. Some
businesses are undervalued where one part of the business is more DEMO
or where the market does not understand the business economics. More
focused businesses will often sell at a higher multiple.
• Leveraged buy out. DEMO PE firm uses debt to finance a major part of the
buy out. When the value improves, the returns to the equity portion are
magnified due to the high debt component.
• Management buy-out.
• Management DEMO
• Make bolt-on acquisitions to generate economies of scale or gain access
to new products or markets.
PE could be used to remove the DEMO of existing debt which might allow
the business to reinvest and grow. Existing management may be retained with
incentives or may be allowed a DEMO equity position as an incentive.
PE investment might be used to provide existing management with the
opportunity to buy out the existing owners, re-engineer the business and then
41
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Chapter Three: Sources of  Private Equity
position DEMO for an IPO. The PE firm would use the IPO as their exit strategy leaving
the management team in control post IPO.
PE funds DEMO become active in ‘sell down’ transactions in recent years. This
occurs where the PE fund buys shares from a founder representing only part
of DEMO ownership, although most often the majority. In this way the founder
DEMO the opportunity to cash out part of their investment in the enterprise. The
PE firm will then work with the founder to actively progress DEMO business to a
higher exit valuation which could be achieved either through an IPO or a trade
sale. In undertaking the development strategy, the PE firm might arrange for
additional debt financing, replace some of the management team, restructure
the Board of Directors, assist with acquisitions and DEMO of new strategic
partnerships and so on.
This strategy has the advantage of allowing time for the business to be
properly prepared for an DEMO with the active co-operation of the founder and
the management team. The founder may also achieve a secondary harvest at
a higher valuation. An DEMO might seek out a PE fund as an exit strategy if the
business could be substantially developed with significant capital injection, a
new management team or as part of a roll-up strategy.
Corporate Venture Capital
An DEMO may co-invest with a corporation or seek follow-on funding from a
corporation as part of an exit strategy. Many corporations have Venture Capital
Funds DEMO for the purpose of investing in early stage ventures. The manner
in which these corporate funds are managed and the terms under which
funds DEMO invested closely mirror traditional Venture Capital Funds. Ventures
successful in acquiring a corporate investor can often gain additional benefits
beyond those which can be DEMO by the traditional Venture Capital Fund.
Corporations have a variety of reasons for investing in early stage ventures
although the most common are:
DEMO access to specialised knowledge, intellectual property or equipment
• exposure to DEMO technologies
42
An Introduction
to
Chapter Three: Sources of  Private Equity
investingangel
• DEMO in potential acquisitions
• understanding of new or emerging markets
• access to entrepreneurial talent
• preventing competitors from acquiring a technological breakthrough.
For DEMO new venture, a corporate investor could provide the following
benefits:
DEMO access to industry expertise, networks, equipment and/or research and
development facilities
• access to a key customer or to an established distribution DEMO
• access to complimentary technologies.
Typically, Corporate Venture Funds invest in DEMO core or closely related
technologies.
According to a joint study by Venture Economics and the National Venture
Capital Association in United States, in 1994 only 2% of venture capital
investments were corporate venture capital, but in 2000, corporate venture
capital accounted for 17%, nearly US$20 billion. In DEMO years, from 1996 through
the end of 1999, the number of companies investing in outside ideas increased
elevenfold, from 30 to 330. During the same period, corporate venture capital
spending rose from US$100 million to US$17 billion annually.

Overseas DEMO local corporations may undertake venture investments through
a local fund, via DEMO traditional Venture Capital Fund or through a local subsidiary.
The major problem most corporate businesses have with VC investments is
access to experienced VC DEMO Since the VC investment model is one of
active intervention as well as portfolio investing, this type of investing is foreign
to most corporations. Many will invest in an established VC fund in order to
access DEMO investment evaluation experience and venture investment skills.
An early stage venture which can clearly show how their innovations relate
to the business of a DEMO corporation should include that corporation in their
list of potential investors. However, corporations not familiar with investing in
early stage ventures can be a mixed blessing. Because they are not familiar with
the norms of such DEMO, the firm may find itself wasting considerable
time trying to convince DEMO corporation of the value of an external investment,
although benefits may come from a more favorable valuation, access to
corporate resources and an early exit opportunity.
The Angel should be wary of the motivation of DEMO corporate investor. Their
involvement is mostly driven by their own strategic objectives and their support
may be highly influenced by wanting the investee firm DEMO develop in a particular
direction. They may inhibit, consciously or unconsciously, the direction of the
business and limit the exit opportunities.

ngel investing is not for the faint-
DEMO hearted or for those who prefer to
extract their funds whenever they have an urgent need. It
has relatively high risks associated with it DEMO relatively long
periods before harvesting occurs. Before you jump into the
pond, it is worth spending some time working out whether
this type of investment is really for you as well as how much
involvement you DEMO in sourcing, evaluating and managing
investments. Perhaps, most of all – why are you contemplating
doing it?
More and more Angels are DEMO involved in formal

need to ask themselves is whether participating in an Angel

and whether they would be willing to participate in syndicate
investing.

An Introduction

Personal investment profile
There are many different types of Angels and many different forms DEMO Angel
involvement in investee firms. Just what type of Angel you want to be, or are
able to be, are fundamental questions.
How DEMO are you prepared to lose?
Private equity investing is probably best done on a portfolio basis. That is,
the more investments you DEMO, the greater the likelihood you will make the
average return in DEMO Angel investment sector. If only a few investments are
made, then DEMO the dispersion of possible outcomes, you have a reasonable
chance of DEMO all or most of your investment. Of course, you could simply DEMO
lucky and end up with a considerable capital gain, but can DEMO afford the risk?
While estimates vary, it appears that somewhere DEMO 30-60% of Angel
investments lose money, with perhaps half being written DEMO One of the most
important questions an individual contemplating Angel investing is: ‘Just how
much money am I prepared to lose?’ Most Angels only invest a portion of their
wealth in this type of investment DEMO that very reason. The returns are by no
means guaranteed and the lack of liquidity can mean that you can see your
money being DEMO up in an investment which has gone wrong and yet have no
way of extracting the funds. Unlike the public investment market where you
DEMO simply sell your shares, no such mechanism exists for shares in DEMO
companies, especially when they are in trouble.
How much time do DEMO have available?
Angel investing is typically done at the coal face. It is an active, hands-on, style
of investment. Angels spend time DEMO deals, evaluating them, negotiating
agreements, assisting in the governance through DEMO Board of Directors and being
directly involved in helping with strategic activities. The research survey data
shows that most Angels devote about a day DEMO month to each of their investee
firms, although new investments often DEMO more time than this.
It is difficult to see how this role can be achieved if the Angel investor has a
full-time job or DEMO they don’t have significant influence over how and where
46
Chapter Four: Your Angel Activity Profile
An Introduction
to
investingangel
they spend their time. Perhaps this is why most Angels are cashed up high DEMO
worth individuals; few others would have the flexibility to devote the DEMO
What contribution can you make?
Most early stage ventures which need Angel investment have relatively
inexperienced management. While they may have technical expertise DEMO even
deep functional expertise in one area of business, it is DEMO they have start-
up experience or general management experience. Few will have experience
working with an external Director and most will not have experience DEMO
developing an organisation through its various stages of growth. You might
characterise the Angel as a business mentor. Part of their contribution to most
DEMO businesses is to help them manage the growth of their ventures. Do
you have the background, experience and temperament to act as advisor,
mentor or coach without taking over? The entrepreneur is not normally seeking
his replacement, just advice and assistance.
Are you able to act in the role of  coach?
Many entrepreneurs seek out Angels with specific expertise or useful
networks. An Angel may play a role in assisting DEMO entrepreneur connect with
key customers or strategic partners or they may be able to help access the next
round of finance or help execute DEMO trade sale exit. Generally speaking, the finance
by itself is not DEMO to be attractive to the new venture entrepreneur. In
fact, an DEMO investor who does not understand the business problems faced
by the venture is a definite liability.
Some entrepreneurs will take the money out of DEMO The Angel
needs to be sensitive to this and ensure that the management team accepts
the active role and knowledge contribution that the Angel DEMO expecting to bring
to the venture.
Are you able and willing to act as a non-executive director?
Most Angels require a seat on DEMO Board of Directors, this way they can
closely monitor their investment, influence decision-making and provide
strategic input. They are also able to use DEMO veto powers directly from their
Board position. However, being an external DEMO outside Director is not the same
47
Chapter Four: Your Angel Activity Profile
An Introduction
to
investingangel
as being in control of day-to-day operations. A non-executive Director is not an
employee DEMO a manager, they do not make operational decisions and do not
DEMO the decisions of the Board. An Angel is part of the decision-making
process but is not the decision-maker. Many cashed-up entrepreneurs want to
be DEMO control and want to make all the decisions but this is not the role of a non-
executive Director.
In recent times there has DEMO increased scrutiny of Board members’ actions
and an increase in penalties for failure of directors to act honestly and with due
care. While there DEMO clear obligations on directors set out in the legislation
controlling corporation activities, there is also a raft of obligations on Directors
stemming from other legislation which governs how businesses deal with the
environment, health and safety of their employees, competitors, reporting
requirements to various government departments and DEMO What
this all means in practice can be open to interpretation. The requirement to
take ‘due care’ or use ‘reasonable judgment’ or apply ‘all DEMO diligence’ can
seem somewhat daunting to a potential Director. However, most DEMO in
which serious penalties have been applied, do seem to cluster DEMO fraud,
gross negligence, conflict of interest, gross dereliction of duties, knowingly
trading while insolvent and improper use of the position of Director for
personal gain. Angels who act as Directors who exercise reasonable care, take
their responsibilities seriously, act in good faith, diligently use and DEMO upon
professional specialists and act in the interests of all the shareholders have
been able to more than adequately defend their actions.
Even so, an Angel investor who acts as a Director should not undertake
the DEMO lightly. Acting as a Director is a role which most Angels accept as
part of their management of their investments. Is this an activity DEMO wish to
undertake?
Are you able to let management run the business?
The role of the Angel is mentor and coach rather DEMO CEO. An Angel who
wants to micro-manage the business will end up alienating the very people who
have to make the business successful. Too DEMO Angels become involved in the
detail rather than set overall policy and guidelines. If you have several investee
firms, you simply do not have enough time to micro-manage them and your
active involvement may leave them DEMO leadership when required. As an
48
Chapter Four: Your Angel Activity Profile
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Angel you need to stay back a little and guide with loose reins and DEMO become
involved in the detail when the situation warrants it.
How much involvement do you want?
Angels have a variety of reasons for DEMO involved with early stage
ventures, not the least is that they DEMO to make a difference to the development
of the firm. Therefore, DEMO your own motivations and interests and
mapping these to your involvement is a critical part of the relationship between
the Angel and the investee DEMO This relationship has to work for both parties
for the investment to be manageable. Most Angels don’t want to have day-to-
day responsibility which DEMO part of the reason why their normal investment is
less than 50% of the voting shares. However, they are deal makers in the main
and like to become more active in major strategic activities such as DEMO up
agreements with key customers or strategic partners.
Some Angels prefer investments where they are able to limit themselves
to Board meetings and seek DEMO investee firms which have more mature and
capable management. Others like the role of mentor and coach and work best
with younger, less experienced management teams. Some Angels with strong
technology backgrounds like to be involved DEMO R&D projects and will take an
active role in that area of the business.
Involvement is a factor of both the time available DEMO need. A proactive Angel
might be expecting to spend considerable time working with their investee
firms while a more passive Angel might only want DEMO become involved in a crisis.
There needs to be a match between what the firm requires and what the Angel
is able and willing DEMO offer. This is perhaps one of the reasons why Angels get
personally involved in the screening process: they are looking for something
which matches their ability to add value while also offering a level of excitement
DEMO being involved in the development of a new enterprise.
Will you be sourcing your own deals?
Finding early stage ventures worth investing in DEMO be a significant task
for an Angel. Most Angels complain that they do not see enough deals even
though they are actively seeking. Even DEMO you work through an Angel Network,
you will still be expected to make a contribution by sourcing some deals for the
49
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Chapter Four: Your Angel Activity Profile
Network. Therefore, do you have the contacts to generate a stream of possible
investments and do you have time to  work your network sourcing connections
to find entrepreneurs seeking Angel finance?
Will you be doing your own DEMO?
While it is always possible to invest money in any venture, the Angel who
does not undertake adequate due diligence on the firm may as well gamble the
money away. Most experienced Angels would state DEMO their least successful
investments occurred where they failed to undertake rigorous due diligence.
But due diligence takes time, expertise and knowledge. Of course, DEMO can
be outsourced to professional advisors but that will significantly increase the
cost of the investment. Many Angels restrict their investments to industries in
DEMO they are familiar as this enables them to make more informed judgments
about the venture’s potential. Many Angels now work in Angel Networks,
DEMO Investment Clubs or Angel Funds to spread the workload of investment
screening and due diligence.
Will you be investing alone or with other Angels?DEMO
Some Angels prefer to be the sole external investor while many prefer to
co-invest with others. Angels acting alone need to be able to DEMO the time
to their investments and take an active role in each. Acting with other Angels,
an Angel can share the ‘lead’ role DEMO others, perhaps acting as a Director on
some investments while taking DEMO passive role in others.
How well educated are you about Angel investing?
Investing is not the same as managing an enterprise and being DEMO experienced
entrepreneur does not in itself ensure that you can work as an effective mentor
to other entrepreneurs. Undertaking due diligence, negotiating a share purchase
agreement and working as a Board member is a very different DEMO than
that acquired in a past career as a corporate executive or a member of an
entrepreneurial team.

DEMO investment syndicates
In recent times there has been a movement for Angels to band together into
Angel Investment Clubs, Angel Groups and Angel Networks. Some Angel groups
have organised themselves into Angel Funds, a structure closely resembling a
VC fund.
The main advantages of syndicate membership are:

• the possibility of having a public profile to source deals
• having the DEMO provide administrative support
• some syndicates employ staff to screen proposals
• some syndicates employ executives to manage any investments
• the investment is DEMO likely to have better screening and due diligence
• access to business contacts
• enhancing the Angel’s management skills
• access to additional funds.
DEMO Angel Networks are loosely organised where Angels simply meet
occasionally to compare notes and to decide if they wish to co-invest in a deal.
DEMO have no formal agreement, no regular agenda and no obligation to DEMO
or to co-invest.
A more formal Angel Network would have a membership fee, regular
meetings and an obligation to make investments and to share some of the
workload of deal screening and due diligence. More sophisticated DEMO
employ administrative staff and staff to screen proposals. They meet on a regular
basis where they review potential investments, listen to presentations from
entrepreneurs and share experiences. They accept an obligation to participate
in investments but DEMO can choose which ones. They also accept an obligation
to undertake a share of the due diligence work. Some Networks invite early
stage VC DEMO to join in their activities either for co-investing or to smooth
the way for subsequent follow on investment. An Angel Network typically
establishes dues DEMO its members, manages network finances, promotes deal
flow and recruits new members.
In most Angel Networks, a champion must be found before a proposal will
go forward to a more in-depth due diligence. It is DEMO that the champion
will assist the entrepreneur to prepare a proposal and presentation and will be
the lead investor.
As an example of how DEMO Angel Network operates, the following is a
description of the Vancouver DEMO Network.
An Angel Fund resembles a VC fund in its operation. Angels commit a
specified amount of capital and invest as a group in DEMO based on a

Example
Deals are brought to the attention of the membership through a
structured, if somewhat informal process. An Angel member must
sponsor a prospective business in DEMO to bring it in front of the group.
To be a sponsor, the investor must work with the network and be
interested in making a personal investment in that company. By making
an individual member do DEMO initial due diligence, the group avoids
having to deal with a DEMO application and screening process.
Approximately one in four presentations made to the group receive
capital. The investments range from as low as US$25,000 DEMO as high as
US$4 million. The group has a definite technology focus and only looks
at applications from local Vancouver businesses.
Three or four DEMO are brought before the group at each
monthly meeting. The meetings begin at 7.30 am and typically last two
hours. Each presentation is restricted DEMO 15 minutes; the presenters have
10 minutes to present to the DEMO, with five minutes reserved for
questions. The presentations are not intended DEMO spark a detailed
discussion, but to gauge general interest among the DEMO
Generally speaking, presenters do not listen to other presentations.
At the DEMO of the meeting, each business’ sponsor leads a discussion on
the  presentation, without the presenter in the room. Gauging interest
is normally a simple process, with people just speaking their minds.
Often it becomes clear very quickly who, if anyone, is interested in the
opportunity.
A DEMO annual fee is used to defray the minimal administrative
costs and to provide coffee and muffins for the breakfast meeting. No
presenters or investors DEMO charged for attending the seminars.

vote of the members. Angel Funds usually employ a professional manager who
screens deals, leads due diligence efforts using member expertise and assists
with generating deal DEMO Managers are normally compensated with a salary,
often based on the value of the pooled funds, plus a share of the capital gains
achieved on investee exits, generally between 5% and 20%. An example of this
type of arrangement is the Ottawa Angel Network.
Example
Ottawa Angel DEMO – Band of Scoundrels: The Band of Scoundrels,
formed in DEMO by several individuals to facilitate investing in the Ottawa
community, is DEMO general partnership consisting of eight individuals and
two corporations. It is structured as a pooled interest with a formal
process for selecting investments. Rather DEMO providing a forum for
individual investors to select targets, the Band DEMO the members’ funds
and decides as a group on a per investment basis. Decisions are made by
voting, with a 70% vote carrying the day.
Finding and evaluating deals: Band members nominate candidates to
present to the group; however, two members of the Band must examine
the DEMO before agreeing to hear the presentation. The champion
or sponsor is responsible for ensuring the necessary information is
presented.
While each member of the DEMO shares equally in the financial
risk, workload varies among the members DEMO upon availability.

Strategic v.s Financial
Investments
here are basically two types of investments. DEMO
Tventures create value on exit via a financial trade
sale or an IPO by assigning a value to the future profit
generating power of DEMO entity being sold. Alternatively, a
strategic venture creates exit value, not on the basis of what
profit it could inherently generate, but on the basis of what
future profit could be generated by the buyer DEMO the
underlying assets or capabilities of the entity being acquired.
These are fundamentally different types of businesses and
the Angel has to ensure that DEMO business development
process and the exit preparation align to the appropriate exit.
In order to assess the potential exit value of any entity,
DEMO must first understand how the business creates value
for its buyer (DEMO or strategic sale) or its future public
shareholders (IPO). Those businesses which deliver inherent
profitability must create value for its future owners DEMO
enhanced profitability and future profit growth. By contrast,
strategic value businesses create value by enabling a large
corporation, the strategic buyer, to DEMO a significant
revenue opportunity enabled through the combination of the
56
Chapter Five: Strategic v.s Financial Investments
An Introduction
to
investingangel
two companies. The strategic seller builds value by developing strategic assets
and capabilities which DEMO large company will exploit.
In the case of a strategic sale, DEMO may not matter whether the selling business
is making a profit, DEMO revenue or is growing. This is in direct contrast to a
financial exit which is entirely based on revenue and profit growth which the
DEMO itself must deliver to its new owners.
Because these outcomes are very different, the manner in which the Angel
and VC investors will evaluate the investment and then should plan the exit
for their investee business DEMO greatly on which type of exit is most
appropriate.
I have grouped financial trade sale and IPO under the financial exit as they
both DEMO the same basic value creating process, they both need to generate
DEMO future stream of positive earnings to create a successful exit event. The IPO
exit is an extreme situation of a financial venture where the DEMO revenue
levels and the projected market capitalization is very high. While the IPO exit
requires a more sophisticated organization to be successful, the fact is that
both the financial sale and the IPO require a proven, high growth potential
business concept to generate a successful exit value.
Smaller DEMO and firms with limited growth potential which create value
through projected net earnings need to be directed towards a financial trade
sale as they DEMO not be able to meet the rather high threshold of revenue
and potential growth requirements needed for a successful IPO. Given that
only a DEMO small percentage of firms are able to achieve IPO status, the DEMO
majority of firms need to be prepared for a financial sale. For the purposes of
this discussion, I am going to refer to all financial exits as a ‘financial sale’ with
the understanding that some exceptional DEMO will be able to achieve an IPO.
Also,  for the purposes of this discussion, I am going to assume that all financial
exits will be to an individual or corporation, that is a ‘financial buyer’, and that
the buyer is setting the purchase price based on the anticipated future stream
of earnings from the acquired firm alone. That is, the buyer is not assigning
any synergy or benefit to the acquisition DEMO on what is happening, or could
happen, in the rest of the buyer’s organization.
57
Chapter Five: Strategic v.s Financial Investments
An Introduction
to
investingangel
The financial sale is very different from a strategic sale where value is created
DEMO the combination of the buyer and seller businesses. We have all heard
of businesses which were sold for many times revenue and staggering multiples
DEMO profit. These situations are all cases where the business being acquired had
something which the large corporation needed to counter a major threat or DEMO
chase after a major new revenue opportunity. Most of these acquired businesses
had unique intellectual property, deep expertise or well established brands or
rights (e.g. to exploit forests, minerals, fishing etc). The assets or capabilities
being acquired were considered by the buyer to be too expensive DEMO copy, build
or develop, or would take the buyer too long to assemble or to create internally.
The delay in acquiring the asset DEMO capability may also expose the acquiring
corporation to an unacceptable level of risk.
In a strategic acquisition, a small business can often provide the means by
which a large corporation can quickly generate many times the DEMO price
by leveraging its own assets and capabilities alongside those being acquired.
Such acquisitions are bought, not on the basis of the profits of the acquired
business, but on the value that can be generated within the combined entity.
Few acquisitions, however, fit this profile. I will DEMO the terms ‘strategic sale’ and
‘strategic buyer’ to describe a situation where a business is sold on the basis of
its strategic value to DEMO acquirer.
Businesses which are typically sold to a strategic buyer are those in
biotechnology, information technology, research and development, designer
fashions, mineral DEMO, agricultural science, computer hardware and
telecommunications. Also companies in consumer packaged goods with strong
brands or with manufactured products which have global market DEMO can
often secure significant premiums on sale. Acquisitions which can deliver very
significant synergies in operating costs through integration would also fit into
this DEMO
Probably about 95% of all private businesses which are sold are acquired
by a financial buyer. In some, there will be synergies in the acquisition but
these will be minimal and not sufficient to override the DEMO for the acquired
business to show its inherent profitability. Most companies don’t have the type
of assets or capabilities to leverage large scale opportunities DEMO an acquirer.

Instead, DEMO build profits through their own inherent competitive advantages
for a local customer base.
A financial buyer seeking an acquisition will often have many choices DEMO
similar businesses, although sometimes geographically separate. The buyer
may be buying DEMO business to own and manage or a corporation undertaking a
consolidation strategy by acquiring many businesses of a similar type. What the
financial buyer DEMO acquiring is a profit stream and so the basis of the purchase is
simply how much profit the firm makes now and is likely DEMO make in the future.
Purchase value is calculated almost purely on the inherent profitability of the
acquisition with little regard to the combination synergies DEMO the acquisition.
The seller to a financial buyer must put effort into increasing profit and profit
potential.
Businesses which would normally be sold to DEMO financial buyer are professional
services firms, marketing firms, management consultancies, DEMO
companies, trucking companies, most retail businesses, wholesalers, import/
export companies, agricultural enterprises, printers, professional practices,
builders, construction companies DEMO so on. Non complex manufacturing also
attracts a high proportion of financial buyers. Basically any business which does
the same as many other businesses DEMO fall into this group.
Businesses acquired to be operated as a stand alone business will be purchased
on the basis of their inherent profitability DEMO there are no synergistic benefits
in the deal for the acquirer. Therefore, a business bought by an individual who
wants to invest retirement or redundancy funds to buy a business to manage
will be a financial DEMO Similarly, a business purchased by a private equity fund
which intends DEMO increase its profitability through new management, increasing
its debt level and DEMO the business will also be a financial sale.
Businesses acquired by corporations can be expected to have both financial
and strategic contributions. Many acquisitions DEMO undertaken for roll-up,
consolidation or expansion purposes. These businesses typically are purchased
to add revenue and profit generation through their own inherent operations
DEMO the acquirer may gain some synergistic benefits from operating at
a larger scale or some benefits through reducing duplicate functions, but the
prime consideration is generating operating profit from the business purchased.
59
Chapter Five: Strategic v.s Financial Investments

The purchase price would be driven by the current and potential profit of the
DEMO business itself. While the additional synergies may make it more
attractive, DEMO seller would need to prepare the business for a financial buyer.
Acquired businesses which are expected to contribute significant synergistic
benefits to the acquiring DEMO may contribute little inherent profit. They
are acquired because of the benefits which the acquiring corporation expects
to achieve through the combination of the DEMO In most cases, these
acquired businesses bring some asset or capability DEMO the acquirer which the
corporation is able to leverage through their own operations thereby generating
significant future revenue and profits for the acquirer. A DEMO who was able to
make such a contribution would seek out a strategic buyer.
Some firms will be able to do both. That is, they will have good profit
capabilities and also be able to provide DEMO benefits to the acquirer. But
one will be more significant than the other. To the extent that strategic value
benefits are greater than inherent DEMO benefits, the seller would be
much better off seeking a strategic DEMO Financial sales are always going to be
limited by the profit generating capability of the seller. A strategic sale, however,
is only limited by the size of the opportunity generated within the acquiring
corporation. Thus, a very large corporation which can significantly leverage the
strategic contribution of DEMO small acquisition may be prepared to pay many times
its financial sale value to ensure it receives the benefits of the acquisition rather
than DEMO it to be acquired by one of its competitors.
I have extensively examined the process of a financial trade sale and have
documented a DEMO in my book, The Ultimate Deal 1, which can be
used by business owners to significantly improve their sale value.
My book, The Ultimate Deal 2, examines strategies which owners of businesses
with strategic value will use to sell their businesses to a strategic buyer. Angels
and DEMO investors who wish to examine the strategic sale preparation process in
greater detail should also read my e-book ‘Invest to Exit’.

I am sure that some companies can do both, but when you look at the

There is sometimes the possibility that DEMO single venture can throw off more
than one exit. This can happen where the firm has developed IP across multiple
markets or solves quite DEMO problems. It may be worth separating the
different IP into distinct ventures and preparing each for an exit.
Another possibility is that a single DEMO may have quite different activities

financial sales and others being strategic sales. This can happen, for example,

they may have no interest in the local services business. In DEMO a case, it may
63
Chapter Five: Strategic v.s Financial Investments
An Introduction

be worthwhile splitting the business and selling the different parts to different
buyers.
Companies DEMO are sold as a financial sale are those which provide the
buyer with a platform which enables the buyer to generate a stream of DEMO
earnings through the use of the resources contained within the acquired
business. While these might be augmented by the buyer through the insertion
of DEMO processes, more capable management and better funding, essentially
it is the same underlying business which is generating the profit stream. Thus
any acquisition DEMO will be based on the net present value of those future
earnings. Most businesses fall into this category. Financial buyers typically buy
retail, wholesale, light manufacturing, transport, property and services based
businesses.
You increase the value of such businesses by reducing the inherent risks for
the buyer, improving the visibility and reliability of future earnings forecasts,
improving on-going DEMO, building growth into the business and finding
ways to create growth DEMO for the buyer.
By contrast, those businesses which appeal to strategic DEMO have some
underlying assets or capabilities which a large corporation can exploit through
the buyer’s own organization. Small companies will often develop products or
DEMO which can be sold by the acquirer through their very large distribution
channels. In the right circumstances, a buyer might be able to scale the revenue
by 50 to 100 times that of the seller just DEMO having the right access to global
customers. The key to a strategic sale is to find a large corporation which can
exploit the underlying DEMO or capability of the seller to generate very large
revenues. In these situations the size, revenue, number of customers or
employees or level DEMO profits of the seller may be entirely irrelevant. It is the
size of the revenue opportunity of the buyer which is the key to DEMO value.
Thus a business which has the right type of assets or capabilities which can
generate strategic value may be much better off putting DEMO effort into
developing those assets and capabilities to provide greater or earlier revenue
generating power for the intended buyer. A higher exit price will DEMO achieved if
the buyer can scale or replicate the asset or capability faster and can integrate
the seller’s business quicker. The only size consideration DEMO the seller is to be
64

big enough to provide the launch platform for the buyer to fully and quickly

Angels need to be sensitive to these two types of ventures as it directly
impacts the evaluation of the venture and DEMO manner in which the business
would be developed for an exit.

Build a Deal
Pipeline
ost Angels desire to see more potential
DEMO deals. It seems that deal flow, or at
least good deal DEMO, is their biggest impediment to investing
in more ventures. Those who DEMO together in syndicates do
see more deals and certainly co-investing will get them into a
higher volume of deals, but many still prefer to find their own
and be the sole investor, especially at a very early stage.
Angels develop personal networks to stimulate contacts
with entrepreneurs who DEMO funding. Sources of contacts
are many and varied with most Angels generating most
of their leads from friends, family and business associates.
Those that are in Angel syndicates have the advantage of a
greater pool of DEMO seeking deals and are exposed to many
more opportunities than most Angels working alone. Even
so, Angels in syndicates still source many of their own deals
personally. Sources include local lawyers and accountants,
business advisors, universities, research institutions,

Active Angels have many potential sources for connecting with entrepreneurs
seeking DEMO funding. However, they need to be proactive in establishing those
sources DEMO, where they can, they prefer that some level of pre-screening

Some Angels are prepared to provide a profile in writing to local contacts to
DEMO with deal sourcing while others prefer to seek out entrepreneurs directly.
Primary contacts
Places where the Angels can gain direct access to entrepreneurs seeking
DEMO would include the following:
Investor forums
Venture forums are periodic events arranged so that investors and
entrepreneurs can network. They are typically sponsored DEMO non-profit
organisations, such as business development corporations or universities,
incubators, Angel groups, and for-profit groups involved in funding and
investment banking. While some are educational events, the most successful
forums allow pre-screened entrepreneurs with prepared and schooled
presentations the opportunity to give a short pitch, 10-30 minutes, to a group
of potential investors.
Example
The enterprise angels Private Luncheons (in Australia) are private
and confidential forums designed to provide DEMO opportunity for up
to five registered Investee companies to promote their investment
opportunity to a number of enterprise angels private clients and other
interested DEMO Private Luncheons have been running successfully
since early 2000, and today DEMO regularly throughout the year in
Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.
The typical DEMO for these events is for the investee companies
to present their investment opportunity in seven minutes each, and
then upon completion of the presentations a light lunch is served and
networking time is provided.

Local, DEMO and national governments and government bodies often fund
not-for-profit organisations to set up investment forums where entrepreneurs
can pitch ideas to local Angels. As DEMO example, LINC in Scotland is a public/
private partnership which DEMO as a matchmaker by providing a service bringing
together Business Angels with entrepreneurs seeking investment funds.
Membership is open to any individual with an DEMO in becoming a Business
Angel upon payment of a nominal membership fee. It is a non-profit making
body and is the main Business Angel DEMO in Scotland.
LINC arranges regular investor meetings in various parts of Scotland, at which
companies get the opportunity to present their case directly to an audience of
investors. Members also find it valuable to network with DEMO Business Angels
at these events.

Lists of such forums can readily be obtained through an internet search.
BSI Corporate Finance (BSI) in Australia developed an event DEMO the BSI
Investor Forum, where every three months, they showcase eight companies
to 150 plus high net-worth individuals and funds in Sydney, Melbourne and
Brisbane. BSI has also developed a process to assist the companies DEMO
at a forum to become investor ready over a period of time prior to the forum.
In the past few years, BSI has showcased 12 Forums and 90 ventures. Of the 90
companies which have presented, over 50 have raised capital with the help of
the Forum process.
DEMO owns a small Private Equity Fund (ADI) supported by the Australian
federal government. ($6 million). BSI will co-invest in companies presenting to
the forum in exchange for equity. So far they have made A$2.5 DEMO in 14
investments together with A$25 million of co-invested funds.
The forums have become a ‘networking event’ for Angel investors and
provide an opportunity DEMO Angels to get together with each other and identify
potential investments over a breakfast session.

Internet-based matching service
Since the rise of the internet, there have been numerous sites set up to register
entrepreneurs seeking finance and business angels offering assistance. DEMO
based matchmaking sites which attempt to match Angels with entrepreneurs
seeking finance have, however, proved to be disappointing. Most Angels prefer
some form DEMO personal recommendation before spending their time evaluating
a candidate or prefer to meet the entrepreneur at a venue. The major complaint
by Angels of DEMO services is that they tend to list only those deals that are
unable to source Angel finance through normal channels and thus are mostly
DEMO less-appealing deals.
Example
Business Angels Pty Ltd provides a central register where both
private investors and businesses find each other by matching the needs
DEMO businesses with the investment criteria of private investors.
Australian Business Angels facilitates the identification
and introduction of investment-ready companies to Business
Angels who are DEMO to provide capital. Australian Business
Angels primarily works with businesses with turnovers
of $1 million to $20 million. Private equity capital of
$100 000 DEMO $5 million can be sourced through Australian Business
Angels without a prospectus under the class order exemption (02/273).

A very powerful facility for Angels and Entrepreneurs is the Angelsoft
platform. This provides tools for DEMO administration of Angel Networks as well
as a matching service for start-ups seeking finance. See http://angelsoft.net/

wide directory. Most countries have such directories, often as part of an Angel

association or as a sub-set of the local venture capital association. There
are also DEMO government agencies, sponsored organisations, development
corporations and so on.
For example, in the USA, the Center for Venture Research has created a
DEMO list of VC resources to help entrepreneurs in their search for
early stage capital. This list does not contain contact information on Angel
groups DEMO it does provide contact information on organisations interested in
funding/assisting early stage companies and entrepreneurs. The list includes
organisations such as VC groups, venture forums, matching networks and
educational forums for entrepreneurs. The list is updated annually.

A list of Angel contacts in Australia is provided in the Caslon DEMO e-capital
guide (see www.caslon.com.au/ecapitalguide3.htm).
Venture capital firms
VC firms DEMO see deals which are too small, too early or in the DEMO sector
or simply timed badly for their existing funds. Angels with active connections to
such firms can step in and hopefully provide the funding DEMO At the same
time, deal flow might work the other way. DEMO who see deals which require
larger funding amounts or are outside their area of expertise or preferred growth
stage can be forwarded to the DEMO firm for review. In this way a complementary
relationship can exist which benefits both parties.
Local banks
Banks which have close relationships with entrepreneurs DEMO advise them
to seek funding from an Angel investor if the financing needs are best met
by an equity injection. Alternatively, a bank might be approached by a local
entrepreneur who does banking business elsewhere in DEMO hope of securing a
loan. Again the bank may pass on the lead if equity is the best form of growth
financing. To stimulate DEMO type of referral, the Angel may spend time to meet
with DEMO bank officials, especially loan officers, or be active in the local business
associations where bank managers typically network.

The local chamber of commerce would normally provide an introductory
service to local Angels. DEMO sponsor Angel Networks by providing administrative

Incubators
Local incubators assisting early-stage ventures will often require access to
investment funding. Angels known to them will often be DEMO with venture
details to determine if they have an interest.
Universities
Universities active in R&D spin outs will often seek help from Angels DEMO assist
in the early stage management of a spin out. Many university entrepreneurship
programs actively seek guest speakers and mentors for students.
Business plan DEMO
Many educational institutions and local not-for-profit organisations sponsor
business plan competitions. They are often seeking mentors for management
teams as well as judges for DEMO presentations. Angels who actively assist with
such events can make direct contact with entrepreneurs.

Business associates

to DEMO By expressing an interest in Angel investment, the network
can pass DEMO the Angel’s interest to entrepreneurs known to them.
Friends and relatives
By making known their interest in Angel investing, family and friends will
pass along this information to anyone they meet with a need.
Lawyers
Legal DEMO often work with clients who are seeking an injection of funds.
Sometimes they act as an introductory service, at other times they simply pass
on the contact to the local Angel. Because they are often familiar DEMO the
client’s business, they are in a good position to see DEMO match between the needs
of the firm and the investment preferences of the Angel.
Accountants
Smaller accounting firms will often refer a client to DEMO local Angel if they can
see a match between the client’s needs and the Angel’s investment preferences.
Larger accounting firms will often act on DEMO of the client in sourcing finance
and sometimes will require an introductory fee.
Business advisors

clients. Quite often they will attract entrepreneurs seeking Angel finance by
advertising their ability to find capital. Many Angels have a network DEMO local
business advisors who source deals for them. In some cases, DEMO business

events.
Sourcing deals through Angel Networks

active than individual Angels. Because they can provide an interface
between Angels and entrepreneurs which DEMO not require individual
Angels to be readily identified, many Angels like DEMO type of deal sourcing.
75
An Introduction

Chapter Six: Build a Deal Pipeline
investingangel
Some Angels work with Networks exclusively while others supplement their
own activities with Network DEMO deals. Many Angels find it convenient
to take their own sourced deals to Network meetings so they can benefit from
the greater pool of DEMO available through the network and also to benefit
from co-investing possibilities, DEMO if the funding requirement is greater
than the amount they prefer to invest personally.
Networks often have their own websites which provide information about
DEMO activities to both potential Angels as well as entrepreneurs seeking finance.
See example below.
Example
Cherrystone Angel Group, based in Providence, offers start-up
DEMO funds to Rhode Island-based companies that need seed
capital.
Typically, Cherrystone DEMO invest between $100,000 and $500,000
and work with the emerging companies to proceed to the next stage.
Cheerystone also helps recruit new DEMO of the management
team, develop strategic partners, and refine product strategy.

Evaluating Possible
Investments
usiness Angels don’t consider themselves
B charities and DEMO they may be motivated
to assist entrepreneurs in start-up and early stage ventures,
they still want to see a return on their money. DEMO those
who are highly supportive of young entrepreneurs and want
to ‘give back’ know that their ability to help more ventures
will depend on DEMO success, thus each investment should be
approached with rigour and an DEMO of achieving a good
return.
Given the early stage environment in which the Angel
participates, a summary of their investment objectives would
normally be as follows:
• The objective of the investment is to exit DEMO a
return of at least 25% compound across the whole
investment portfolio.
• The time period from investment to exit needs to be
planned DEMO 3-7 years.
• The investee firm is most likely going to need
mentoring and help with its growth strategy.
78
An Introduction
to
Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments
investingangel
• While Angels are prepared to take risks they prefer to invest where the
risks DEMO be minimised or managed.
• While Angels seek investments with a very strong up-side valuation, they
are still quite averse to losing their investment through a lack of due
diligence.
• Angels will typically invest where DEMO have industry experience,
understand the risks in the investment and where they feel they can
make a contribution.
• Due to the high DEMO of involvement in their investee businesses, the
number of investments they DEMO prepared to make concurrently will be
limited.
• Early stage ventures don’t have the proven success which later stage
businesses have, so the Angel is mostly evaluating venture potential.
Angels play a very useful role in DEMO funding over the medium term
(3-7 years) for firms which don’t have the assets to access more traditional
forms of debt finance. However, the lack of asset security means that the
investment has a higher DEMO profile. At the same time, the Angel cannot easily
exit the DEMO There is no established liquid market for shares in unlisted
or emerging firms and so this factor also carries with it a risk premium. DEMO
few ventures are guaranteed, even the best Angel funded ventures will DEMO
some level of risk not present in listed or larger corporations with significant
tangible assets.
In evaluating a possible investment, the Angel, or DEMO Angel in a co-
investment situation, should approach it on the DEMO basis:
• The business is almost certainly going to be sold within 3-7 years.
Outside a boom market, very few firms make it to an IPO.
• The entrepreneur and most of the equity holding DEMO team are
unlikely to stay with the business once it is sold to a corporate buyer.
• The Angel, in most cases, will DEMO be involved in the day-to-day
operation of the business but will play a mentoring and strategic role.
• The Angel can be expected to DEMO specific help in an aspect of the
business where they have deep personal experience.

• A primary activity of the Angel will be to ensure the business
implements formal DEMO management systems and good

• The Angel will most likely hold at least one Board seat.

of Angel investments result in DEMO or, at best, break even. Most successful
Angel investments result in a trade sale. At the stage Angels typically invest,
only a DEMO few have the size and growth potential to undertake an IPO outside
a boom market. The reality is that only about 20% of larger, mature firms with
high potential make it to an IPO.
One of DEMO evaluation issues facing the Angel is whether the business will
have a financial or strategic exit. Clearly, the financial venture must be able to
prove out an entire business model and be able to convincingly demonstrate DEMO
capability to produce significant growth in revenue and profit. This is in contrast
to a strategic venture which must simply show that it is DEMO ideal acquisition for
a large corporation. While there are a number of attributes which both these
ventures must demonstrate, the hurdle for the financial business is significantly
higher.
For a financial  investment to have a serious chance of being successful,
resulting in an IPO or financial trade DEMO, it needs to show that it can demonstrate
the potential to DEMO the following set of attributes:
• Clearly identifiable and reachable customer with a compelling need.
• An emerging and growing market with significant DEMO potential which
is fragmented and where demand exceeds supply.
• A business model with sufficient barriers to entry to protect the business
over the DEMO few years.

in conjunction with assistance from the Angel.
• A well-defined plan for the use of DEMO Angel funds, which is directly
linked to clear and measurable targets DEMO in turn support the exit
strategy.
• A robust business strategy and cash flow which can cope with things
going wrong and can still, in the worst case, return the initial investment
to the Angel.
• A set of shareholders and a management team willing to sell the
DEMO within 3-7 years and walk away if necessary.
• A team willing to negotiate a realistic valuation.
You might well argue that it is DEMO impossible to find an early stage venture
which meets either of these sets of criteria. In reality you are unlikely to find a
business DEMO Angel finance which even understands these requirements.
Your evaluation is to make a judgement as to whether you firmly believe that
the venture can DEMO taken to a successful exit. After all, if they could already
DEMO all this, they would not need an Angel or would go DEMO to a VC firm
for a larger investment to exploit their potential.
Angels generally invest where they can see that the venture can be DEMO
over a few years to the point where it can be sold to a corporate buyer or taken
to an IPO. Your task as DEMO Angel is to help the business to develop so that you can
meet this list of attributes as closely as possible. The closer the DEMO, the higher
the probability of reaching a level of sales and DEMO where they become a
profitable, sustainable, growth business, are able DEMO secure a strategic sale or
are capable of securing VC investment at the next round of financing.
The critical factor in Angel investment is DEMO be able to judge potential in an
objective and unemotional manner and to do it with a comprehensive and
systematic process. The Venture Potential DEMO in Part B will help you do that.
What does it take for a venture to be successful?

The entrepreneurship body of knowledge can help us answer these questions.
The market analysis
There DEMO many marketing texts you can read which talk about market
segmentation, DEMO buying patterns, pricing models and so on. Most
likely the Angel DEMO have read those and so understands the jargon. The key to
an investable business is more about the execution of a business plan over DEMO
limited period of time to achieve the exit conditions. This might be a stated level
of revenue and profit, rather than developing a sophisticated marketing plan for
market domination. Alternatively, it might be in preparing a product or service
for a strategic buyer’s market. If the life of DEMO venture is to be 3-7 years before
an exit, then very DEMO targets need to be achieved.
Whether it is the target market of the venture or the target market of the
strategic buyer, it can be expected to have the same fundamental attributes.
The  target market definition needs to be very simple, robust, obvious and easily
proven. The DEMO model is characterised by the following:
• Well-defined, identifiable and DEMO reachable customers who have a
high compelling need to buy, a DEMO and ability to pay the price
and are in sufficient numbers that the revenue targets can be readily
achieved.
• A segmented market where DEMO is possible to significantly differentiate the
product or service from competitors and where that differentiation is
difficult to copy or neutralise.
A financial venture DEMO also want to be able to demonstrate the following:
•
•
A total market which is growing, has global potential and would be
attractive in the long-term to a major corporation.
A fragmented market which DEMO growth by acquisition.

The customer
The better business to be in is where the business has a list DEMO all possible
customers for the product or service. Alternatively, the customer DEMO be readily
reached through an established, or readily built, distribution channel. The
entrepreneur should be telling you:
• the profile of the DEMO customer
• how contact will be established
• what their buying pattern is
• how they have the purchasing power to readily meet the DEMO price.
You see businesses all the time which reach out to the general public in the
hope that they will buy. A retail store, a restaurant and the internet marketing
firm are all hoping they can DEMO customers. But they have little influence over
the buying cycle. On the other hand, customers which can be clearly identified,
named and are able to be approached with a value proposition are much easier
to DEMO to. This is not to say that other models are not successful, however, they
generally carry a greater risk.
Redefining the business to DEMO proactive in reaching its target customer will
make the business more likely to achieve sustainable profits.
The compelling need to buy
Few people understand DEMO how hard it is to build a value proposition which
compels a customer to buy. Most products are chosen on a whim, can be readily
deferred or have many alternatives and substitutes.
Think about these questions:DEMO
What problem is the venture solving?
Is it satisfying a need or a desire?
What degree of compliance (penalty or cost) DEMO from not buying?
84
An Introduction
to
Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments
investingangel
What happens if the customer does not buy?
Are there alternative to the firm’s DEMO or service they could buy?
Who is required to solve the problem? What happens to them if they
don’t?
How can the products be made more necessary? Is there a select group of
customers the firm could focus on where it could secure a higher price?DEMO
Example
Distinction Software Inc. a business established in 1994 in Atlanta,
USA, by Dr. Tom McKaskill developed a sales forecasting and inventory
planning system for high volume, low cost consumer packaged goods.
Using prospect data the software could show a 15-30% reduction
in safety stock over a DEMO month period providing an investment
payback of 3-6 months on the software cost. Even though many
corporations expressed interest, few made the investment. Why?
After five years it became apparent that only corporations that
had DEMO inventory problems were willing to make the
organisational and system changes to implement the software. For the
others, their profitability was high enough that the changes required
to implement the software were simply ‘too hard’. For DEMO software to
work effectively the customer needed to change job responsibilities,
reporting lines and data ownership. The ‘compelling need to buy’ only
existed DEMO a few corporations. For the others, it was a desirable, but
not necessary, thing to do.

Market characteristics
Most Angels prefer their investee companies to operate in medium-sized
global markets as DEMO will ultimately attract the corporate acquirer or will be
the basis on which to launch an IPO. But for an Angel, it is not whether the
market is small or huge, it is simply whether the target market over the next 3-7
years can provide the firm with DEMO capability to achieve the valuation required
for the Angel to exit. In the end, it all comes down to valuation on exit and ease
of exit. The target market may be directly addressable by the investee DEMO or
could be the target market of a strategic buyer.
For a financial venture, a larger fragmented market where new products and
services can find a reasonable size niche market are preferred by Angels as this
DEMO easier to achieve than global domination or a share in a commodity market.
The firm has to demonstrate in its investment request that it DEMO secure the
level of revenue and profits required to achieve the valuation target. Even in
a very large market, a lack of customer demand for the specific offering of the
firm won’t make the target numbers.
DEMO a strategic venture, it is whether the potential strategic buyer has DEMO
existing market which can be readily addressed or a potential market which
they can exploit.
So in the end it comes down to establishing, with a reasonable degree of
certainty, that the revenue, cash flow DEMO profit targets of either the firm itself
or the intended buyer can be achieved. This requires a very good understanding
of the marketplace, an understanding of the needs of the customers and some
level of proof DEMO customers will buy in the quantities forecast. This might
be based on existing sales, prospect surveys or expert advice plus experience
within the executive team.
However, in order to show a probable exit path, the DEMO of the
exit strategy need also to be shown. An IPO requires the company to be able to
confidently build to, say, a DEMO million valuation within three years after listing.
Smaller companies are not excluded from an IPO, in fact many companies
smaller than $100 million are successfully listed;  however, they tend to miss
out on attracting institutional investors and in many cases do not attract broker

or analyst coverage, accordingly, they present a greater risk to maintain or
increase values. DEMO, as the management team and the Angel usually
have at least DEMO of their shareholding escrowed for a period of time, the exit
DEMO may ultimately be at prices below the initial listing price. For an IPO exit
the firm needs to confidently show that it can achieve DEMO revenue, cash flow
and profit targets needed to support the share DEMO over a 3-5 year period after
listing. With an IPO exit, DEMO funding through the IPO and subsequent
rounds of public capital raising will fund growth. The business needs to have a
very strong product/market DEMO to fuel growth.
For a financial trade sale exit, the requirements DEMO revenue and profits are
very different. The firm need only show that it can reach the level of revenue
and profits needed to close DEMO trade sale deal. In the case of a strategic trade
sale, DEMO revenue and profit may be zero or limited, that is, the deal is
based on some other aspect of the business which needs DEMO be achieved, such
as a product development stage. At other times, the acquiring corporation may
want to see a limited number of customers DEMO using the product as a proof
of design, marketing and operational DEMO
In many cases, corporations enter into a strategic trade sale with DEMO emerging
firm to acquire a product which has considerable global potential. In proposing
a trade sale exit strategy, the firm needs to convince the Angel of the ultimate
size of the market that would attract the DEMO buyers, whether they be
a financial or strategic buyer. Thus market DEMO and competitive positioning
become important, not for the short term, but to secure the ultimate acquirer.
As an Angel, you should be interested in the structure of the industry and an
analysis of the market DEMO
Which companies are growing and why?
Which firms are declining and why?
Is this an emerging market where demand exceeds supply and DEMO
even poor businesses will survive?
87
An Introduction
to
Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments
investingangel
Given the product positioning, which market is the firm attacking and
what retaliation, if DEMO, can the firm expect from the current players?
Is this DEMO market which will attract new entrants and, if so, how will the
firm defend its business from the new competition?
Competitive analysis
DEMO prefer their investee companies to sell products or services which
are differentiated from their competitors. They like to see differentiation based
on some level DEMO innovation in product, process or business concept. The
innovation itself needs DEMO be difficult to match over the period of time needed
to achieve the exit target.
If an IPO is planned, the product needs to be sufficiently different to be able
to sustain a long-term competitive advantage. DEMO is the only position which
will allow the firm to achieve the revenue, cash flow and profit levels needed to
sustain the share price in the public market.
In a financial trade sale, the firm has to be able to demonstrate revenue
growth into the medium term. Competitive DEMO is going to be a key
aspect of the business case to the buyer.
For a strategic trade sale, competitive position is not as important as being
the right product for an acquisition. However, if you look beyond the acquisition,
you have to deal with the competitive DEMO of the acquiring corporation and
the subsequent merged operations. This means the investment proposal needs
to show how the acquiring corporation would use the DEMO products to secure
significant revenue. Although, this may be in combination DEMO the acquirer’s
other products or by selling the firm’s products into their own customer base.
The competitive analysis needs to show very clearly why DEMO firm’s products
are preferred in some market segments and to demonstrate reasonable proof
of that assertion.
88

Barriers to entry
Whatever the exit, the future generation of revenue and profit will require the
firm to establish that its products or services which drive revenue DEMO
have a level of competitive advantage which itself has a significant degree of
sustainability. This implies some reasonable level of barriers to entry.
There DEMO two fundamental questions which the Angel needs to consider:
Why would customers buy this firm’s products or services?
What is to stop DEMO competitor from taking the business away from them?
The first question should be supported in the proposal by the product value
proposition, a market analysis, a competitor analysis and a compelling need to
buy. ‘Why you?’ is also an issue of credibility. The firm or the DEMO buyer
needs to be able to convince the target customer that they can trust it to deliver
and support the product. In the case DEMO the investee firm, establishing the
product or service in the market, this may be achieved through the experience
of the team, from existing customer testimonials or through customer trials.
The second question is simply about DEMO the business from erosion
from an existing or new competitor. What is to stop a much better funded,
larger, more aggressive competitor from duplicating what the firm has done
and offering greater incentives for their DEMO to buy from the competitor?
This gets down to: how DEMO the firm or the strategic buyer going to protect its
business?
Protecting the business is achieved by erecting barriers to entry. That is,DEMO
what can the firm or the strategic buyer put in place to protect its competitive
advantage, distribution channel, ongoing customer revenue and source DEMO
supply.
89
An Introduction
to
Barriers to entry have one, or several, of DEMO following attributes:
high start-up costs
expensive to acquire
takes a long time to acquire
protected by patent, trademark or copyright
restricted under licence, rights or agreements
requires specialised knowledge which itself is in limited supply
highly innovative and not capable of reverse engineering
protected by ongoing customer DEMO through high switching costs or
contracts
ownership of or contracted distribution channel
restricted or contracted source of supply.
Strong barriers to entry usually create DEMO basis for a sustainable competitive
advantage. This is the foundation of any longer term growth strategy for a public
listing. At the same time, a strategic buyer will need to be convinced that these
conditions can DEMO established by it subsequent to the acquisition.
The management team
The literature in the venture capital area is dominated by the quest for the
DEMO team’. This is the super team. The ‘A team’ has done it all before and has
the skills, capabilities and diversity to cope with anything under any conditions.
Regrettably they rarely exist and Angel and VC DEMO have to put up with business
plan presentations from ordinary mortals.
However, that is not to say that their objective is wrong. It is simply that
executives who have done it before have probably learnt from DEMO successes
and failures. They are well connected in the industry and are knowledgeable of
other experienced executives and can easily recruit additional team members.
DEMO the Angel, it is all about reducing risk. If they can DEMO in a well-rounded
team with experience, they have a greater chance DEMO achieving their minimum
targets.

The ‘A team’ also brings with them the following:
• a knowledge of the DEMO investment requirements
• willingness to negotiate a realistic valuation
• experience with an exit
• not as emotionally attached to the ‘product’
• networks DEMO the industry and with potential alliance partners.
For the Angel, members DEMO an experienced management team are easier to
deal with and have a good understanding of the Angel funding process.
Although the venture capital market DEMO been operating in Australia and
New Zealand for more than 20 years on a formal basis, there are still very
few experienced management teams which have gone through a formal
private equity investment and exit cycle DEMO than once, unlike the US and
European markets which have floating DEMO teams which move from
one investment with an Angel or VC firm through to exit and on to another
investment.
Many of the deals DEMO to the Angel for funding simply lack an experienced
set of executives. There can be no question the entrepreneur brings the idea,
the DEMO, the vision and the energy, but other team members usually make
it work.
When the Angel looks over the business plan, they are working on the
activities which need to be executed to deliver the DEMO targets. This might
be sales, marketing, product development, quality control DEMO so on. For
each of these activities, they want to know DEMO on the team will deliver this
operationally.
The real test to be applied here is operational. Given where the business is
today, can the team execute, with reasonable confidence, the activities needed
to get them DEMO the exit conditions within the 3-7 year period? In some cases DEMO
Angel will be making a judgement as to their own impact on the ability of the
firm to achieve such results. So the fundamental DEMO the Angel has about
the management team is: ‘Can the team DEMO I together achieve the targets
needed to exit?’
91
An Introduction
to
Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments
investingangel
For most exits, this will be a trade sale and the management team may not
be needed beyond that. Not all proposals need the 20-year veteran or DEMO
executives recently cashed out from their IPO. In fact, this may DEMO the wrong
team for a clearly defined trade sale exit.
The business proposition also needs to show who is going to deliver on each
DEMO the major activities needed to reach the exit conditions. Any weakness in the
team will need to be addressed by the Angel. The management DEMO can be
supplemented with experience from a Board of Directors, a DEMO of Advisors
and external consultants. Where the management team is not complete, the
Angel will want to see an acknowledgement that the existing management
recognise this deficiency and accept that new talent will need to be DEMO to
deliver on the business targets. Some of the founding shareholders may have to
step aside. This is a critical time for entrepreneurs as DEMO need to put together
a team which has a high probability of meeting the targets.
Operations
Day-to-day monitoring of the business is an essential DEMO of a well-
run firm. The firm has to know where it is, what it needs to do and have the
systems, policies DEMO procedures in place to monitor and correct deficiencies.
The reason why Angels often become involved in early stage ventures is
because it is this DEMO they can bring to the venture. From their past
experience with start-up and high growth revenue ventures, they have learned
the importance of being well informed and taking remedial action early.
Operational systems include all the DEMO, financial and operational
reporting systems, performance setting and monitoring processes and systems
and reward schemes which encourage the right behaviour. High growth
businesses DEMO finely tuned because they consume cash in building capacity.
They have little room for mistakes and therefore early warning systems and
quick response systems DEMO very important.
At the same time, the business must manage its DEMO risks. Well
written contracts with customers and suppliers, well-designed contracts of
DEMO, well documented intellectual property ownership and assignment
are all components of DEMO management of risks.
92
An Introduction
to
Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments

Product development
It is unlikely that an Angel will ever know as much about the DEMO as the
entrepreneur and his team. Even if they have a technical background, this can
be out-of-date quickly and they are rarely in a position to adequately judge the
quality of the product development systems or DEMO reality of the timescales. This
is therefore a high exposure area for the Angel. To overcome this limitation, the
entrepreneur will need to show adherence to budgets and targeted timescales,
or show how the available DEMO are capable of producing the results
required. The entrepreneur must accept that keeping development costs under
control and meeting development timescales is critical to DEMO the Angel’s
ongoing financial support.
Later Stage Investments
More mature firms with established management, proven products and
demonstrable revenue streams, often seek funds DEMO market expansion, filling
out product portfolios, acquisitions or working capital. Such firms offer a very
different risk profile to the private equity investor DEMO to a start-up or
early stage venture. However, such investments are DEMO without their risks.
Firms often seek external private equity finance because they don’t have the
tangible assets needed by traditional banking lenders. Thus the DEMO which
underwrite the funding are often ‘soft’, such as patents, brands, copyrights or
simply a good business model. As such, they are DEMO to value and often hard
to liquidate. Even so, they may DEMO good revenue generating assets and can
provide some level of comfort to the Angel investor.
The Angel investor is still concerned with an exit. DEMO will need to balance two
opposing concerns, the upside potential of DEMO business and the risks of failure.
The upside opportunity will be presented in terms of building market share,
establishing overseas offices and penetrating DEMO markets with additional
products. However, the risk will be in the DEMO Does the team have the
skills and experience to deliver the target numbers? Will the market support
their growth?
93
An Introduction
to
Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments
investingangel
With more mature enterprises, the Angel has a much greater body of evidence
to examine how well the company performs strategically and operationally.
The Angel will still DEMO to conduct extensive due diligence to uncover any
weaknesses or risks. Established products and relationships can be examined to
determine market potential and service DEMO
Many entrepreneurs seek Angel finance at this level to provide a boost to
their business so they can reach a size and profitability where DEMO can convert
equity to debt or take the company to an IPO. This recapitalisation enables
them to gain larger critical mass while at the DEMO time gaining back the equity
passed to the Angel investor as part of the financing deal. The entrepreneur is
betting they can generate the DEMO of security needed to fund debt within a
relatively short period of time (3-7 years) to take out the Angel investor.
Entrepreneurs are DEMO reluctant to part with equity, seeing this as loss
of control DEMO/or loss of upside potential. However, a deal which allows the
DEMO to redeem the Angel’s shares at some agreed formula can be a
very attractive method of building up the business with an opportunity to DEMO
back the external equity. Expansion finance which is used to build up tangible
assets, decrease revenue and profit volatility or increase the portfolio of revenue
sources, can provide a platform for negotiating debt to repay an Angel investor.
Entrepreneurs interested in short-term equity investment with redeemable
options need DEMO have a clear focus on the security requirements for debt
finance. These factors then need to be built firmly into the business plan with
DEMO agreement of the Angel investor. Even partial redemption, swapping some
equity DEMO debt, during the investment period, may be an attractive option for
both parties.
However, the entrepreneur still needs to accept that there is a potential
pitfall in bringing in an Angel investor. An investee firm DEMO fails to meet
agreed targets or fails to generate sufficient free cash to fund debt obligations
is still subject to intervention by the Angel DEMO The investment agreement
from the Angel should allow the Angel to take action if the investment is in
trouble. No business is entirely free DEMO risk, even if this is external to the firm
and even DEMO their marketplace. The entrepreneur seeking later stage financing
cannot guarantee they can recapitalise or take the business to an IPO. Failure to

provide a liquidity opportunity for the Angel investor will result in intervention
by the Angel DEMO ensure that there is an exit opportunity while the business still
has real worth. This will often result in the firm being sold in DEMO trade sale.
In more mature businesses, the Angel is likely to DEMO a very different role
than that undertaken in early stage ventures. Where early stage ventures
typically need advice and direction in moving the business DEMO profit, growth
and sustainability, later stage businesses often only need help at the Board
level. Their needs are more likely to be advice DEMO strategy and creating the right
foundation for an IPO or major trade sale. Good governance, good reporting
systems and a structure which reduces internal risks need to be developed.
Angels in larger ventures often assist with DEMO expansion, help establish
strategic relationships and assist with VC rounds.
The DEMO Proposal
Any request for Angel capital should have a comprehensive business plan.
It is not that the Angel could not understand the business from DEMO discussion or
presentation, it is just that it is more efficient DEMO the long run for the entrepreneur
to have it all documented in advance. The Angel can then reject it with a quick
glance at DEMO executive summary, review it prior to a meeting, use it to open
discussions with other co-investors and use it to drive the due DEMO process
if they wish to proceed.
The general view is that, DEMO the entrepreneur cannot put together a good
business plan explaining every aspect of their business, they probably don’t
understand the business well enough to grow it to the point the Angel desires.
Part of the entry DEMO for investment is that they have the necessary literacy,
numeracy and communication skills to run the business. The business plan is
one of DEMO tests they need to pass.
The major benefit to the Angel of the business plan is to provide an
opportunity for the management team DEMO demonstrate they can build a model
of the business which an outsider can understand. The model needs to be
holistic. It has to explain DEMO aspect of the business in sufficient detail to show
that they understand how all the parts have to work together over time.

An Introduction

Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments
investingangel
You, the DEMO, are being asked to invest considerable funds into a business
you DEMO trying to understand. It is unlikely that you will ever understand the
business as well as the entrepreneur and the management team. Since your
DEMO is only for a short period, say 3-7 years, you need to see a strong
possibility of a trade sale or an IPO DEMO that time. What they need to
demonstrate in their investment proposal to you, in non-technical terms, is that
they can achieve those objectives.
DEMO business plans are simply projections of the past. It is simply Excel
madness. It is almost as if, by putting the data into Excel and projecting it
forward for three years, it will happen. Of course it may. But that would be
more hope than strategy. Forecasts need DEMO be based on a set of realistic and
defensible assumptions. For many entrepreneurs, the business plan is an
expression of what they would like to happen. They work backwards from what
they would like to happen DEMO establish the growth rate that will get them there.
Alternatively, they DEMO a set of assumptions which seem reasonable and build
their business plan on those assumptions. This is often presented as the classic
‘percentage of DEMO market’ plan: ‘The market is huge and we only need 2% DEMO
the market to be a $100 million business.’
However, most often DEMO is not supported by any validation that the customers
will buy the firm’s products or that they will buy in the volumes asserted. The
DEMO plan needed by an Angel has a very specific purpose. It is to convince
the Angel that the firm can deliver the objectives they DEMO for the use of their
money. Put simply, that means:
DEMO a 25% plus ROI
• known expansion opportunities
• an exit via an IPO or trade sale in 3-7 years
• identified potential trade DEMO
• limited support required
• relatively low risk.
Many entrepreneurs think the purpose of Angel finance is to help them grow
their business, or they think that Angel investment is simply another form of
finance that DEMO help them overcome some constraint within their business.
96
An Introduction

What they fail to appreciate is that Angel finance is specifically designed with
certain objectives DEMO mind which can only be achieved by developing the business
so that the Angel can achieve a good return on their investment usually through
DEMO exit event in a relatively short period. The purpose of the business plan is to
prove that those objectives can be met.
The business DEMO the Angel should be looking for should have the following
three components:
Where is the venture now and what is the growth opportunity?DEMO
What is the exit strategy?
How are they going to achieve it?
The business plan should also include details of the management DEMO
and their capacity to deal with the business development strategy along with
the how the funds sought are going to be utilised in support DEMO the business
objectives.
Where is the venture now?
The entrepreneur should have a well-articulated business opportunity
which needs Angel finance in order for DEMO to be achieved. So the first part of the
proposal for Angel finance should be about the business opportunity and the
extent to which DEMO has been validated.
It is almost always going to be the case that the entrepreneur will think only
in terms of building a financial DEMO They will seek to generate significant
revenue and profit to justify the Angel Investment. It is highly unlikely that they
will have thought of DEMO Strategic Trade Sale exit or be able to show how this could
be achieved. Their presentation will almost certainly be around traditional
business model DEMO
The proposal should demonstrate the strength of the business case from an
opportunity screening point of view. Simply put:
97
An Introduction

Chapter Seven: Evaluating Possible Investments

What is the business concept?
What is the size of the target market and DEMO will the firm secure its
share?
Who is the customer?
What is the benefit to the customer and where is the compelling DEMO?
What price and why?
How is the product or service distributed to the customer?
What is the competitive advantage?
How DEMO sustainability of the business achieved?
If the business is already operational, the existing business should be able to
demonstrate the operational aspects of the business model. This should validate
the product/market information, the financial aspects of the business and the
management team’s capabilities. If you see DEMO strategic exit opportunity, you will
have to make that assessment based DEMO the data you are initially supplied with.
In summary, you need DEMO be convinced that this is a good business with
a good idea or strategy, is well run and has a good chance of achieving the
financial or strategic exit you require.
What is the exit strategy?DEMO
Most Angels have similar objectives for their investments. While they enjoy
the involvement with emerging companies, they want their money back with
a 25% plus ROI within 3-7 years. Therefore, the investment proposal should
clearly set out how much Angel finance will be needed and how the Angel DEMO
achieve that objective.
Most business plans which are used to support investment requests are
woeful in setting out their exit strategy. The Angel needs DEMO know which exit
strategy is being proposed and why. Potential multiple exit opportunities are
even better as they bring flexibility and reduced reliance on DEMO market
cycles. For the vast majority of firms, they simply cannot DEMO the attributes of
an IPO. For others, the strategy cannot be DEMO with their existing business model
and it would take a number of acquisitions to create the right IPO vehicle. For
a few, they have the right mix of products, markets and potential to undertake

an IPO and also meet revenue and profit targets for several years beyond. Since
an DEMO generally achieves a much higher ROI than a trade sale, the DEMO strategy
should be followed. However, a trade sale alternative should be DEMO in
the proposal for periods where the market is unreceptive for an IPO.
For the trade sale exit, the entrepreneur should be setting out a
comprehensive road map for how the sale will be achieved. This DEMO include
identification of specific potential buyers, the tactics that will be DEMO to
develop relationships with each and an estimate of the likely sales price.
In his book, ‘Early Exits’, Basil Peters adds another element DEMO the exit strategy
question by suggesting that angels also ask whether the company intends to
seek investment from traditional venture capital funds. His analysis DEMO that
adding VC investment statistically adds about a decade to the exit timeline –
pushing it beyond the normal maximum investment period for most DEMO
How are they going to get there?
The business plan is simply about execution. The business is at point A (now)
and it needs to get to point B (the exit), what are they proposing to do to get
there? You need to see exactly how they are going to put the strategy in place
over the DEMO year timescale.
Of course, many start-up and early stage ventures simply DEMO have the
experience to be able to develop an exit plan of any substance. You need to see
that a robust plan can be DEMO If you can’t see your way out, you should
be very DEMO of getting in.
Some Angels prefer to keep it simple. Knowing that the management team
is somewhat green and need help to develop the DEMO, they need to ask:
Exactly what are you going to DEMO with my money?
Say you are a $1 million revenue business. To get to the exit point, you may
need to grow the business to $4 million. Alternatively you may need to complete
product development DEMO establish trial customers to prove the product. How
are they going to do it? It is not simply an extrapolation of the numbers. You
need to see operational plans for every part of the business.

is to succeed.
Before committing to the investment, you should be able to review every part
of the plan and see exactly what DEMO manager will be doing to contribute to
the overall plan. This should also be set out in an organisational plan (including
recruitment and training) and plans for office accommodation, manufacturing
and warehousing space, infrastructure and finance. A set of projected financial
statements should be available.

An Angel should also be asking; ‘Show me exactly how these revenue
numbers are going to be made?’ You might want to see a breakdown of DEMO
revenue projections for both recurring revenue and new business. The recurring
revenue should be supported by actual contracts with customers. The new
business should DEMO supported by a prospect generation and sales closure plan
that targets specific customers or specific channels and so on.
The more the entrepreneur can DEMO they really understand how to make
the numbers and that they have the people, systems and processes in place to
do so, the DEMO convincing the plan will be.
At the same time, the growth DEMO may call for new management positions
to be filled, in which DEMO an executive recruitment plan should be included in
the plan.
Which business plan layout?
There are many examples of conventional business plan structures DEMO
textbooks and on the internet. Those offered by VC firms are good guidelines
for the content. However, it is the way it is put together that is important.
Remember that the business plan for your evaluation DEMO be about how you
are going to meet your objectives, not DEMO they are going to meet theirs. In
many cases you will need to ask the entrepreneur to revise their business plan
with your specific DEMO in mind.

Entry and Exit
Considerations
nce the initial potential investment proposal
O DEMO been evaluated and the more extensive
due diligence commenced, Angels should DEMO their efforts
on resolving the two most significant attributes of the deal
which will have the greatest effect on their return: the equity
they will receive for their investment and the path they plan
to take DEMO getting their money back; the exit.
Entrepreneurs have always seen the DEMO valuation as
the most important part of the investment process – as this
can impact greatly on what they walk away with on exit. DEMO
the same time Angels see entry valuation as the key to the
investment return – if they get too little equity they may
not DEMO a reasonable return on the exit if the venture is not
overly successful. Thus valuation discussions can be stressful
on both parties and often DEMO emotional. Finding
a path through this discussion is critical if both parties are
to proceed with the investment and still retain a positive
working DEMO
Typically, few Angels have given the exit event much
consideration, leaving this to be undertaken further into the
investment when they have a DEMO idea of the market and
102

the venture capabilities. But in fact, this is the critical event and should play a
much greater part in the investment decision. A venture with a DEMO probable
exit path should be a preferred investment.
Valuation
Valuation of an existing business before VC and Angel funding and valuation
of a business DEMO VC and Angel funding has to be the most controversial
topic in the venture capital literature. It is the greatest source of conflict
between DEMO and Angels, is plagued by emotion, misunderstanding,
entrenched position taking and ignorance. It has often been said that 40% of
deals fail DEMO secure Angel funding due to a failure to agree a valuation. What is
regrettable is that it is highly possible that many of these DEMO could have
made both the Angel and the entrepreneur considerable wealth.
Valuation is the process of estimating the monetary amount that the firm is
DEMO based on its future expected returns. Valuation is a function of risk and
return and considers:
• the expected return from an investment DEMO the firm
• the expected returns from investments in other comparable firms
• the risks associated with the expected return
• any other relevant DEMO of the firm or the industry/geography
in which it operates.
A more conventional definition of market value is: the price that would be
negotiated between a knowledgeable and willing but not anxious buyer and a
DEMO and willing but not anxious seller acting at arm’s length within
a reasonable time frame.
While this is probably not true of Angels, entrepreneurs often refer to venture
capitalists as greedy, one-sided, ‘vulture capitalists’. On DEMO other hand, venture
capitalists complain of entrepreneurs being unrealistic, unwilling to negotiate a
fair value and ignorant of the balance between risk and DEMO No doubt similar
tensions exist between Angels and entrepreneurs when it comes to setting an
entry value.
103

Valuation models
In the absence of an independent offer to buy the firm, the valuation of a
private firm is a highly judgemental process. Valuation models DEMO each designed
with different purposes in mind. Like the problem of identifying cost, (historical
cost, replacement cost, market price, incremental cost, DEMO adjusted cost,
depreciated cost) it depends what you want to DEMO it for.
The major valuation models are:
• Earnings-based
- Capitalisation of future maintainable earnings
- Discounted future cash flows (DCF).
• Asset-based
- Going concern value
- Realisation value
• Industry-specific based
- DEMO value
- Rules of thumb.
In emerging businesses seeking venture finance, DEMO the earnings based
valuation models are relevant. Traditional earnings based valuation methods
have been established to value existing business where historical data can be
DEMO to show revenue and profit trends and where established products have a
market presence. However, most emerging ventures which seek Angel funding
are of limited life, have little history and a somewhat speculative future. Thus
while traditional methods of valuation don’t really apply, the Angel should be
familiar with their use as valuation discussions may involve them. In order to
DEMO any sort of meaningful discussion, the conventional approach to valuation
for DEMO Angel investment has been to write a forward projecting business plan
and then to try to use this as the basis for discussion.
Most DEMO will estimate a future (exit) valuation based on a four to six
times earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) multiple of the DEMO profit
at the time of harvest of the investment and then work backwards using an
104
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
internal rate of return (IRR) to reflect the risk in the venture to DEMO at a
post funding valuation. Early stage ventures may attract a 55% IRR with more
advanced  ventures attracting 20% to 40% depending on the expected risk.
However, even this valuation is highly speculative as more funding rounds may
occur, each setting a new valuation at the time of funding. To arrive at the equity
percentage for the Angel, the investment required is deducted from the post-
funding valuation and then the ‘pre-money’ DEMO is arrived at. The Angel’s
equity percentage can then be calculated from the ratio of investment to post-
money valuation.
Strategic trade sales require DEMO different approach as the valuation is based
on the expected earnings of the buyer in the first few years following the sale.
However, a valuation can be applied to this stream of earnings to arrive at DEMO
exit value.
Capitalisation of  future maintainable earnings
Capitalisation of future maintainable DEMO methodologies include:
• Price earnings ratio (PER)
• Pre-tax DEMO multiples such as earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), earnings before interest, tax
and amortisation (EBITA) and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).
Earnings-based valuations are used as a proxy for the Discounted Cash Flow
(DCF) methodology.
The PER can DEMO applied in two ways:
• Total value of the firm: DEMO multiple x net profit after tax (NPAT)
• Value per DEMO: PE multiple x earnings per share (EPS)
The PER is applied to an estimate of earnings after tax. The value derived
using DEMO PER is a valuation of the ordinary shareholders’ interest. This is described
as an equity value.
Valuations based on EBITDA, EBITA or EBIT multiples calculate the Enterprise
Value of the firm before factoring in the way DEMO is funded. The Enterprise Value is
typically adjusted for the following items to calculate an Equity Value:
105
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
• Interest-bearing debt
• Surplus assets
• Contingent liabilities
• Future capital expenditure
To DEMO explain the difference between Enterprise Value and Equity Value
consider the following example of somebody’s house:
Item $ Value
Market Value 500,000 DEMO value
Bank Debt 400,000
100,000 Equity value
Some sectors have well established valuation norms. These can vary with the
economic cycles reflecting DEMO growth or depression trends. Multiples applied
to mature industries with little likelihood of growth are generally lower than
multiples applied to growth sectors. Firms DEMO have experienced higher than
average historical growth will usually command a higher multiple on the basis
that future growth is also expected to continue DEMO higher than average rates i.e.
history is often used as a prediction of the future.
The assumption underlying the PER method is that the DEMO has stable or
predictable earnings, that these will continue on a DEMO path for some years,
the business will not change from its current business model and there is an
appropriate debt/equity mix.
It DEMO useful to set valuation expectations prior to going into a valuation
negotiation. If the sector is currently valuing listed corporations at 10 times EBIT
DEMO the firm is seeking something higher, they have unrealistic expectations. If
DEMO the other hand they are seeking five times EBIT, you probably DEMO a basis
for negotiation.
The earnings used in a valuation need not be the actual historical earnings.
Earnings should be adjusted for abnormal, extraordinary and non-recurring
106
An Introduction

investingangel
items to determine a normal level of earnings. If the entrepreneur can show
highly DEMO growth with achievable revenue and profit targets, future
earnings might be DEMO to calculate a market valuation. However, it is important
to avoid DEMO counting growth by using future earnings and applying a ‘growth
multiple’.
Discounted cash flow (DCF)
A DCF has two elements:
• forecast of future cash flows of the firm for a number of years DEMO the
future
• discounting the forecast cash flows back to a net present value (NPV)
using a discount rate which reflects the riskiness of those cash flows.
The preparation of a DCF can be challenging DEMO it can be difficult to:
• accurately forecast cash flows for a number of years into the future
• select an appropriate discount DEMO
The discount rate should represent the risks associated with generating the
expected earnings of the firm. In many cases entrepreneurs and Angels will
simply DEMO the Angel’s investment hurdle rate.
This method is somewhat more problematic. It is based on discounting
future free cash flow to a present value. DEMO free cash flow, or uncommitted
cash surplus, represents the cash available to pay off the initial investment plus
provide a return on that DEMO
Most high growth businesses invest heavily in growth capacity. This might be
R&D, sales force, promotion, channel expansion and so on. Few entrepreneurial
ventures have spare cash.
The DCF discount rate in an Angel DEMO is likely to be 35-40%.
When deciding on a valuation for a strategic exit, a value is arrived at for the
exit price and then discounted to a NPV.
107

Fundraising alternatives
It is useful to put Angel investment into context.
Let’s say the DEMO wanted to borrow $1 million. His choices are a first
or second mortgage on his personal home, a loan secured on business property,
a loan secured on inventory, or a loan secured against debtors.
Secured loans can normally be recovered by the lender as a market exists DEMO
the pledged asset. The lower the likelihood of recovery, the higher DEMO interest
rate and the lower the percentage advanced on the value.
Borrowing against the entrepreneur’s home would possibly result in a
professional valuation, which may be lower than the entrepreneur would
willingly agree and a loan DEMO probably not more than 80% of the valuation.
A bank is likely to seek higher rates of interest on a second mortgage to
compensate DEMO for the additional risk of the second mortgage. If scheduled
repayments can’t be met, the bank has the right to sell the home and recover
their debt plus accumulated interest and costs.
Securing a loan on DEMO property may be a little more expensive as
business properties generally experience more fluctuations in value. A premium
above a second mortgage on a DEMO is likely.
Taking a loan on inventory is of much higher risk as the inventory may suffer
from obsolescence or damage. Usually the recovery DEMO only be made at an
auction which itself often returns much lower values than in the normal course
of business. So an advance of DEMO more than 50% of book value may be made
but with an interest rate higher than the above mentioned rates. A similar
treatment may DEMO applied to debtors except that it may be limited to 50% of
approved debtors, perhaps only those aged 30 days or under.
Now let’s consider the typical early stage entrepreneurial business, which
will display some or all of the following attributes:
• uncertain cash flows
• few DEMO assets
108
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
• some specialised equipment which typically becomes technically
obsolete
• few debtors
• little DEMO
• new and sometimes unproven products or services
• often an immature management team
• an emerging market which is yet to be stabilised
DEMO no established market for shares, especially a minority holding
• uncertain DEMO of revenue and profitability.
So, unlike a secured investor such as DEMO bank, the Angel investor has an illiquid
market in which to DEMO the shares, is dealing with high levels of uncertainty in
the DEMO and the market and the management team has no security for the
investment.
If a risk free rate in Government Bonds is yielding, say, 6% over a long term,
what return should an Angel investment under these riskier conditions return
over a portfolio of such investments? The typical Angel will invest across a range
of ventures expecting to return, on average, approximately 5% above long-term
share market returns. However, within DEMO portfolio some investments can be
expected to be written off, some DEMO break even, some may make a reasonable
return and one may DEMO a sizable return. In order to achieve a 15-20% average
pre-tax return, the Angel needs to set a pre tax hurdle rate of at least 25-30%.
Angels with a technology, biotechnology or early stage investment focus tend
to seek higher returns (potentially in the order of 35-40%) DEMO to higher failure
rates. Only a small percentage of the Angel exits will exceed 7 to 10 times their
investment, thus the Angel may set a relatively high hurdle rate knowing that
those investments which fail DEMO have poor returns will pull down the average.
Most entrepreneurs will accept this logic. So where is the problem? The
problem is in the often extreme views of the likely outcome. Entrepreneurs
by their very nature DEMO optimistic. Angels, while not being pessimistic, are
cautious and have been conditioned by failed ventures, all of which started out
looking very positive. In truth, it is the pursuit of the target value which often
causes the venture to fail. If the Angel has to achieve a DEMO value to exit their
investment with a good return, the pressure DEMO on the entrepreneur to push the
109

investingangel
growth rate. It is often this pressure which creates the conditions for insolvency
and DEMO
At the same time, the gold medal for an Angel investment DEMO an IPO,
notwithstanding that the most common exit mechanism is a trade sale. This
means ever growing revenue and profit targets. However, the successive
yearly targets are inherently risky. The growth rate puts huge pressure DEMO
the organisation and the cash needed to fuel the investment in inventory,
debtors, recruitment, training, accommodation, research and development,
development DEMO distribution channels, customer support and so on. Much of
the investment DEMO in growth preparation rather than in servicing the current
customers.
Let’s consider an example:
The business is achieving $5 million in sales with DEMO staff. It is currently
making 5% net profit after tax ($250,DEMO). The business is valued at six times
net profit after tax, therefore the pre-investment valuation is $1.5 million. The
firm raises $1.5 million for 50% share giving it a post-investment valuation of $3
million. The DEMO expects to achieve an ROI of 25% with a planned exit in four
years. Assume that revenue grows at 40% per annum and the DEMO per head
remains constant.

investingangel
• The Angel’s additional capital of $1.5 million is used on capital expenditure to DEMO business
capacity.
• Years 2-5 assume $nil surplus cash and $nil debt
• Assumes 5% net profit after tax in all years
• The DEMO on Investment is 17% which does not achieve the 25% target expected by the Angel.
Imagine all the things which can go wrong over DEMO five-year period: the
market may change with new competitors,  the DEMO size may be considerably
less than estimated, new technology may make DEMO product obsolete, the firm
may be unable to recruit quality staff DEMO the rate needed and so on.
While size is not the only determinant of a company’s ability to undertake
an IPO, in the above example the growth rate would most likely be insufficient
to create an DEMO opportunity and therefore the Angel would need to pursue a
trade sale as an exit mechanism. For the same firm to gain the level DEMO sales and
profitability to achieve an IPO, they would have to DEMO at a significantly higher
rate.
The business risks associated with high growth rates are significant and
require a massive change in organisation structure, processes, systems and
formalised controls.
The executives who are capable of running a 20-person firm are probably
unsuited to a 200-person firm. Very few entrepreneurs DEMO the skills to make
this transition.
The Angel who pushes an investee firm to an IPO may create the seeds
of their own failure. DEMO of the product/market opportunity, very few
management teams are capable DEMO managing a high level of growth. Growing
firms tend to require significant levels of working capital and investment into
the business. Consequently, cash reserves are generally stretched and even a
small mistake can result in rapid DEMO of cash reserves sending the firm to
the brink of insolvency. As Angels require an exit, in these circumstances some
Angels may panic, DEMO management and probably push the firm into a fire
sale to recover as much of their investment as possible.
The initial valuation may create DEMO platform for future failure. The higher the
initial valuation, the greater DEMO pressure to grow and the higher the likelihood
of failure.
111
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
To protect the Angel’s investment from some of the risks mentioned above,
the DEMO is likely to push the initial valuation down so that they have a greater
chance of gaining a final exit which will return the DEMO needed. They also build
in conditions which allow them to replace management if the team fails to
achieve the milestones needed to keep them DEMO track to reach the target exit
valuation.
A lower valuation has the benefit of taking some of the pressure off the
entrepreneur. Reaching a DEMO ROI for the Angel investment is more likely, the
intermediate milestones DEMO likely to be more easily reached and there is not
undue pressure on growth. The downside is that the entrepreneur will give up
more DEMO at the lower valuation.
Which valuation should you use?
Too many entrepreneurs produce five year forecasts based on assumptions
which are, at best, educated guesses as to the state of the economy, the
reaction DEMO competitors and the behaviour of prospects. They then use complex
formulae to work out a Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) over five years. DEMO this
profit forecast they calculate a valuation to four decimal places using an assumed
discount rate. At the very best, it is one person’s view of the future, but it fails to
recognise that any other view might be equally valid.
In truth, no-one can accurately predict the future. The entrepreneur is
generally going to be optimistic and the Angel DEMO pessimistic. Somehow
they have to come to an agreement on a valuation or the negotiation simply
never goes anywhere.
Entrepreneurs should be highly averse DEMO high valuations. While they look
good at the start of the venture, they place unrealistic expectations on the
business to perform. Even the slightest slippage can lose the entrepreneur his
business. Angels are not known to DEMO shortfalls kindly. The problem is that
they have their own investment to protect. Far better for both parties to agree
a lower/negotiated valuation DEMO the Angel can readily make his hurdle rate
and the entrepreneur has a better chance of staying in control and making a
reasonable return DEMO his effort.
112
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations

Negotiated valuation
One method of arriving at a negotiated valuation is to consider what DEMO
valuation of the business may be at a future exit date and discounting this value
back into today’s dollars. This method also has more DEMO application to
strategic sales. The future exit valuation of the firm is highly speculative and
is a metric that is of real interest to DEMO parties. If it was known with some
certainty, the current valuation DEMO be more readily determined by using a
discounted cash flow methodology. The discount rate could be adjusted for
higher levels of uncertainty but it DEMO still be a place to start.
So, for example, a firm with an exit valuation of $10 million in three years
with a DEMO rate of 40% would be worth $3.64 million now. A $1 million
investment would thus gain the Angel 27.5% shareholding.
Possible alternative valuation scenarios DEMO the above are:
• The Angel wanted some higher comfort factor. A higher rate of discount
may be used, say 50%, which DEMO result in a lower Net Present Value
(NPV) of $3 million giving the Angel 33% equity.
• The Angel wanted some higher comfort DEMO A lower exit valuation
may be used, say $8 million, which would provide a NPV of $2.9 million,
giving the Angel a DEMO of 34.5%.
• The entrepreneur is more optimistic than the Angel and believes that
an exit valuation of $20 million is likely. This would DEMO a NPV of $7.3
million and the Angel share of this would be 13.7%.
The real problem lies in the balance of risk and DEMO If in fact a low exit
value was achieved, both parties DEMO but the Angel is likely to be the one with
the highest cash investment loss. The entrepreneur and his team will have put
time DEMO sweat in but probably much less cash.
At the same time, DEMO a high value is achieved, both parties would seek the
upside. DEMO entrepreneur would most likely claim that he deserves the most
credit because it is his vision, business model and leadership that are probably
the key to success, not the cash from the Angel. The Angel would most likely
argue that the business could not have achieved the high DEMO without the
cash injection from the Angel. The Angel of course wants the lower valuation
113
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
in case things go wrong and so the upside is much higher. The entrepreneur
DEMO a higher valuation to limit the equity of the Angel if the venture proves
very successful.
A solution for both parties lies in negotiating DEMO valuation formula which both
parties can live with. This could be a stated value at somewhere between the
Angel valuation and the entrepreneur’s valuation, or it could be a starting value
but with equity adjusted up DEMO down for different levels of success.
So, for example, the parties could agree a strike point which would
determine initial shareholding. This could DEMO be adjusted for higher or lower
exit valuations. For example, the DEMO could take the two opposing valuations
and use these as a basis for calculating the shareholding at exit.
Negotiated valuation – Example 1
• DEMO investment is $3 million for an initial 33% equity share.
• Exit after three years.
• The Angel estimates a $25 million exit.
• DEMO entrepreneur estimates $50 million.
In this example the parties have agreed on the following:
Angel’s equity share will remain at 33% for all DEMO valuations below their
expected valuation of $25 million.
The Angel’s ROI on exit valuations between $25 million and $50 million
are held at 40% DEMO giving the Angel certainty of returns.
Where the entrepreneur’s estimate of $50 million is achieved, he retains
a greater proportion of the equity (DEMO the Angel’s share is reduced to
16.4%), but the return that the Angel earns is significantly greater than
at lower valuations.
Consequently in DEMO example both the entrepreneur and the Angel
share in the upside of higher valuations.

Alternatively, a much more aggressive model would see the valuations

For a smaller deal the model might look like DEMO:
Angel investment $3 million and an Exit after three years.
Exit valuation Angel portion ROI to Angel Strike Angel’s equity
$ million $ DEMO % valuation share %
1 1.0 Negative 100
3 3.0 Negative 100
8 8.0 38.7 100
10 8.2 40.0 Strike valuation 82
15 9.0 DEMO 60
20 10.0 49.0 50
30 12.0 59.0 40
50 15.0 71.0 30
100 17.0 78.0 17
This type of formula can be used DEMO successive rounds of Angel or VC
funding. Each round would put in place the formula for determining the share
of the final exit valuation DEMO the new investor.
The entrepreneur who is unwilling or unable to accept a lower/negotiated
valuation, should consider seriously a ratchet where the entrepreneur earns
additional equity for achieving certain pre-agreed milestones/targets. These
targets could DEMO qualitative or quantitative in nature.
Angels want to ensure that, at DEMO very least, they don’t lose any money
on the deal. An DEMO is much more sensitive to a loss than to a significant
gain. There is considerable pressure on the Angel to push down the valuation.
DEMO, a lower valuation means the entrepreneur makes much less when
they DEMO the business and therefore the Angel needs to find a valuation figure
which strongly motivates the entrepreneur.

Angels can use a variety of techniques to achieve this balance. One simple
technique DEMO to set the return to the Angel at a specified rate of return. Any
excess over this amount from the exit proceeds goes to DEMO entrepreneurial
team. Another technique is to establish the Angel investment as preference
shares with an accumulating dividend. Since preference shares are paid before
ordinary DEMO, the Angel will recover some or all of their money before DEMO
shareholders share in the proceeds. An Angel may also have some ordinary
shares to give him a percentage of the higher exit valuations.
Some DEMO use options to provide additional incentives to the entrepreneur
and senior management to allow them to accumulate additional equity in the
business. The options DEMO be set against certain milestones or performance
targets which represent higher potential exit proceeds. The entrepreneur
gains a greater percentage of the proceeds as DEMO options kick in at higher exit
valuations.
An anti-dilution clause in favor of the Angel in an investment agreement
has the effect of protecting DEMO or all of their investment in the event that
the valuation falls with a subsequent funding round. This clause adjusts the
shares of the DEMO so that their original investment retains its monetary value
under the new valuation. In this situation it is the original founders who suffer
the DEMO adjustment. However, this type of adjustment is typically not
readjusted with DEMO subsequent higher valuation.
Exit Strategies
There are two major paths to a successful exit of the firm. One is to sell the
firm. This DEMO be to another business (trade sale), usually a corporation in DEMO
similar or related field or to another Angel or VC Fund (DEMO buy out), or to
a wealthy individual. The second path is to list the firm on the stock exchange,
an initial public DEMO (IPO).
Initial public offering
The requirements for listing a firm DEMO quite onerous and expensive. Unless
the listing results in a share price which can maintain a position at least as
good as the sector DEMO, the listing will not achieve an exit the shareholders
118

anticipated (DEMO the shareholders hold shares in the listed company). Just
having liquidity of the shares via a market listing does not in itself guarantee
DEMO value achieved by the shareholders will be greater than an outright sale to
a corporation.
Some private companies undertake an IPO, or a back-door listing (acquire
an existing but dormant publicly listed corporation), with the intention of using
it to raise funds or to sell shares. Typically, back-door listings are done with
smaller companies. However, unless the size of the shareholding in public hands
is significant, generally thought to be above $100 million, there is insufficient
liquidity to create a market to sell shares.

Advantage Clear competitive advantage based on strong intellectual property and/or
proven innovative business DEMO
Public awareness    Products and their benefits are easily understood by DEMO public.
Support Listed shares are large enough in value and number in institutional and
public ownership to encourage market analysts to track the stock. DEMO
this means a market capitalisation of at least $100 million.
Since few companies in private ownership can meet these requirements, an
exit strategy aimed at an IPO is not a viable option for most privately held DEMO
That is not to say the smaller companies cannot exit through an IPO, but the
above provides the best foundations for success.
Generally it will take a minimum of $500,000 in legal and accounting expenses
DEMO even the smallest and simplest IPO. According to KPMG Corporate Finance’s
2004 Australian Capital Markets survey, the average cost of raisings up to $10
million was 10.1%, falling to 4.7% for raisings greater than $500 million. If only
a small amount is to be raised, this cost is very high for the funds received. At
the same time, an IPO usually involves significant work for the top executives.
This has often been DEMO to be 50% of the CEO and CFO’s time over the
six months prior to the IPO. This is a very significant burden on DEMO firm and
requires the rest of the management team to bear the burden of day-to-day
management during this time. A USA listing would be DEMO expensive in annual
expenses due to the greater disclosure requirements.
The overall consensus of private equity advisors is that only four factors are
considered DEMO to a successful IPO. The first factor is the venture should have a
strong competitive advantage and sufficient growth potential to achieve a $100
DEMO capitalisation value within about five years of listing. Neither the current
level of revenue or profit is considered significant compared to anticipated
revenue and DEMO This factor also goes a long way to explaining why low
growth firms which have low margins either don’t make it to the exchange DEMO
have to be significantly larger before they can.
The next major factor is the depth and experience of the management team
and the industry DEMO of the Board of Directors. Again this is not surprising
when you consider that the shareholders are backing a group of individuals to
120
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
take them to the size necessary to support the $100 million capitalisation. A
new DEMO team or one which has significant technical depth but little
management depth is not going to be received well.
Knowledge of the IPO process DEMO by the management team is a major
factor. This demonstrates just how important the roadshow is to the brokers
and the presentations are to DEMO investors. Achieving significant share
purchase commitments up-front is almost a necessary condition for a float.
Knowledge of retail and institutional investor risk and return DEMO and
being able to convincingly show growth potential is an imperative. Investors are
typically risk-averse and will quickly zero in on potential risks in DEMO venture.
The management team must be able to convincingly demonstrate knowledge
of their business, their industry and how to mitigate possible risks.
Finally the firm must have the best possible advisors. The best advisors and
investment DEMO are expected to have the best due diligence processes,
require the highest standards of preparation but also carry the highest level of
credibility DEMO the market. They are also very selective in who they represent.
Too many entrepreneurs see an IPO as a means of solving their own DEMO
problems rather than seeing it as a means where retail and institutional
investors achieve a return on their investment. Without gaining the support of
DEMO significant number of retail investors and/or support from some institutional
investors, the firm is likely to push themselves onto the market by satisfying the
minimum listing conditions and then find that just being publicly listed DEMO
not solve their inherent problems. As we have seen many times – the market
penalises those which don’t perform. In many cases, these firms would have
been better to wait until they had more robust growth DEMO before listing.
It may not be possible for the major shareholders to exit at the time of the
IPO or even within some years. DEMO are very wary of public issues where the
key managers sell off their shares completely. In a situation where the results
are not achieved DEMO to a sale of shares, the inside shareholders could
also face DEMO charges of insider trading.
A firm which wants to undertake an IPO exit needs to build the IPO profile
above. So, to the extent that it cannot meet the requirements within the
121
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
existing business, the additional attributes need to be developed or acquired.
With 3-7 years to execute the IPO strategy and especially with Angel and VC
financing, a firm may be able to achieve the necessary characteristics given the
DEMO starting point. Many companies which attract Angel funding have already
identified strategic acquisition opportunities to bring economies of scale and
growth to the company.
DEMO some sectors, building a company via acquisitions is a possible strategy.
DEMO in the years 2002 and 2003, firms in the biotechnology sector DEMO
Australia needed to undertake consolidation to gain additional resilience,
product portfolio spread and more critical mass. Too many biotechnology firms
were undercapitalised, had very narrow product ranges and too little revenue
spread from licensing to DEMO production products.
Often in emerging markets there will be several firms with complementary
products, often selling to the same customers or working with the same alliance
partners. These could be brought together to provide a platform DEMO an IPO
vehicle. However, there needs to be an obvious and DEMO synergy
between the products and the firms. Just lumping a number of firms together
to reach the revenue and profit targets is unlikely to DEMO the institutional
investors they are investing in a sound platform of future growth.
At the same time that the underlying product portfolio is being DEMO, the
firm needs to construct a management team capable of running DEMO growing
public corporation. Public corporation experience, experience with larger
corporations, deep experience in the industry and a good track record, are all
essential characteristics for the IPO management team.
The IPO strategy needs to show, in considerable detail, how the IPO prospect
profile will be achieved. Underpinning the plan should be documented
representations from respected accountants, lawyers, bankers DEMO brokers who
are willing to work with the firm on building the IPO strategy.
122

Trade sale
Most Angels exit or harvest their investment through a sale to another DEMO
This is called a trade sale.
Where possible, the Angel will DEMO a strategic trade sale to meet or exceed
their return on investment (ROI) needs. A strategic sale occurs when the value
placed on DEMO business exceeds its fair market value (FMV). The FMV is DEMO
often determined by looking at the current business as an investment by an
independent investor looking for a return on their money. The current DEMO
is taken as indicative of the ongoing profitability of the firm and ROI. Since few
owner/managers operate the business to maximise profits, this will normally
undervalue the business.
A conventional sale based on an EBIT DEMO would certainly be attractive
to an Angel if a strategic sale was not possible. In that situation, attention needs
to be given to increasing operating profit, decreasing risk and establishing a
growth potential in order to secure the best price.
However, normally a strategic sale can be expected to achieve a sale price
considerably above a conventional sale price. The DEMO to a strategic sale is to
find a corporate buyer which has a need for the assets and/or capabilities of the
firm. This DEMO fit can come from any number of possible areas:
• customer base
• distribution channel
• brands
• patents, trademarks, licences
• DEMO employees
• access to specialised knowledge and so on.
Strategic buyers most often come from within the industry in which the firm
is operating. DEMO can be suppliers, customers, alliance partners, joint venture
partners or DEMO Sometimes the sale will be to a corporation not in
the sector. They may want to acquire a presence in a market/geography as DEMO
foothold or may wish to diversify.
123
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
The Proactive Sale Strategy developed by the author defines a process which
can be DEMO for financial and strategic trade sales. This methodology has five
major components:
•
•
•
•
•
alignment of interests
due diligence and DEMO governance
creating value for the buyer
selecting buyers
building relationships with potential buyers.
(a) Alignment of interests
In order to be prepared for DEMO trade sale, especially when there is time
pressure to set up DEMO consummate a deal, the various stakeholders need to
agree on the DEMO outcome. There is little point in progressing a deal if the
Directors cannot agree on what they want, or the shareholders cannot agree
on a reasonable price. A negotiator cannot go into a meeting to secure DEMO deal if
the interests of the major stakeholders are unclear. Experienced Angels usually
have the Board focused on exit strategies from the first Board DEMO
The major stakeholders who are critical to executing a deal are:
• members of the Board of Directors
• management
• Angel along DEMO other shareholders
• key employees.
The Angel needs to ensure that all stakeholders are focused in regard to
the two extreme situations: a forced sale due to decline in the viability of
the business or a DEMO sale over a longer term. Once the CEO has a list of
requirements, opinions, conditions and issues which need to be considered,
DEMO/she can start to bring all elements together to arrive at a strategy which
could be followed in these two extreme situations.
(b) DEMO diligence and governance
Nothing kills a deal quicker than an uncertain or immeasurable risk. Many
124
An Introduction
to
people think the valuation on sale is due simply DEMO revenue and profit. What
happens in practice is the buyer conducts an extensive due diligence into every
aspect of the firm’s operations in order DEMO uncover actual or potential problems,
risk and liabilities. Since each of these requires time and funds to resolve, the
offered price is likely to fall as the review goes forward. At some point the risk,DEMO
time and cost to fix the problems become so great that a deal is not possible.
The task of the Board from a directional DEMO together with the CEO
from an operational perspective is to establish the firm and its operations to
minimise risks to the buyer. This includes DEMO into effect such things as:
Standardised and documented contracts with customers and suppliers.
Industry standard terms of employment, benefits and entitlements.
Full ownership and tracking of intellectual property.
Full compliance with industry, health, safety DEMO environmental
regulations.
Comprehensive reporting, budgeting and planning systems.
Policies, procedures and processes covering critical aspects of the
operations.
Industry knowledgeable accountants and lawyers.
DEMO key to passing a business to a buyer is to put yourself in the buyer’s
shoes and think through the integration and operations of DEMO business after
the acquisition. The task of the CEO and management team is to ensure that
the business can operate effectively after the acquisition DEMO imposing an
undue burden on the buyer.
Included in the planning for a sale should be a consideration of the roles of the
key DEMO In most acquisitions some roles will change, some staff will be
DEMO redundant and some key employees are needed to ensure a transition of
knowledge. How can you ensure that this process happens without disruption?
DEMO means determining retention terms for some, redundancy packages for
others and DEMO for all staff to make the transition happen as smoothly as
possible.

Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
(c) Creating value for the buyer
In a financial exit, the firm needs to create value through the generation
of future net earnings. Preparation for DEMO would focus on improving internal
processes, reducing expenses, increasing revenue and margins, adding revenue
growth and then seeking out opportunities for potential growth.
Strategic acquisitions occur because a corporation has a need for some asset
DEMO capability which the firm has. Generally this is something which the firm
already leverages to create its own competitive position. As part of the DEMO
Sale Strategy, the Angel needs to think carefully through the operations DEMO the
business and isolate those things it has and those things it does which could
be used by a large corporation to resolve a DEMO or generate significant new
revenue.
Assets or capabilities which create strategic value should be based on one, or
several, of the following characteristics:DEMO
• difficult or time-consuming to copy
• protected by patents, trademarks DEMO copyright
• only available through licensing or registration which is limited in supply
• unknown due to confidentiality or trade secrets
• requires specialist DEMO to acquire or utilise
(d) Selecting buyers
Financial buyers are often corporations undertaking a roll-up or consolidation
strategy. They are looking for well DEMO firms in their sector which can add
revenue and profit to group earnings.
A strategic buyer is a corporation which is prepared to pay DEMO premium over fair
market value because the business solves a critical problem for them or offers
them a good opportunity for additional revenue and DEMO The best strategic
buyers are ones which can exploit an opportunity by offering a unique product
on a much larger scale than the firm DEMO able to with its limited resources. The
Angel should look for corporations which can overcome whatever constraint is
holding back the business.
126
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
Buyers normally come from within the industry, so start by listing companies
in the same industry as the investee firm. You then need to select those
DEMO which have the capacity and experience to do the deal. Corporations
with experience at acquisitions and which have ample size and funding are
much DEMO to deal with. The ideal buyer will typically be at least 8 times the
size of the seller.
(e) Building relationship with potential DEMO
Trade sales are mostly made between parties which already have some
knowledge of each other. This could be informally through networking functions,
between DEMO colleagues or could be a formal trading relationship such as a
partner or distributor. Other relationships can exist through Boards of Directors
or Boards DEMO Advisors or equity participation. The key to a trade sale for an
Angel-funded company, as with any other company, is to be prepared.
DEMO early stage venture is going to experience some turbulence and not
everything will go according to plan. In terms of exit preparation think of DEMO
situations you may experience.
1. You need to sell
Not everything is going to go according to plan. Sometimes market conditions
change and the DEMO is no longer capable of reaching the targets initially
set or may no longer be viable. Rather than let the firm become insolvent or
DEMO, the exit plan should be established early so that there is DEMO delay
in executing a trade sale. This way the maximum benefit can still be extracted
from the failing business.
Often time is against you. DEMO the management team has not put an exit
strategy in place, DEMO will have little time to prepare or to initiate discussions
with potential buyers. If they have not set up the relationships in advance,
DEMO with overseas buyers, it probably is not going to happen the DEMO
you would like. Without planning, the ability to attract a buyer DEMO will pay a
premium value for the company is significantly constrained.
By setting up relationships in advance and by knowing why the corporation
would DEMO to buy the firm and who to deal with inside the potential buyer,
127
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
management can execute the acquisition discussion quickly. As long as the firm
has several DEMO buyers, competitive tension in the deal can still result in a
DEMO attractive sale price.
2. The firm is approached with an offer to buy
Many Angel-funded firms are targets for acquisitive corporations. However,
when DEMO offer comes management may be unprepared. They are often unsure
of an appropriate price. If management is unprepared and needs to go through
extensive DEMO diligence, this not only takes considerable time, but it uncovers
risks to the buyer. Instead of closing a good deal the firm will DEMO up with a
disrupted business, staff who are stressed due to DEMO and a price the
shareholders would normally not have accepted. Management may also have
talked themselves into the deal. Management will have taken their DEMO off the
ball and will have much to do to recover.
How much better would the situation be if the firm had already lined DEMO
several possible buyers? They can now announce that they are prepared DEMO sell
and take on all offers. Management will have prepared the due diligence files
and can execute the deal quickly with little disruption. The DEMO understand the
process and have incentives to ensure the best deal is done. The exit strategy
should be canvassed with staff from an early DEMO so they understand the
objectives of an Angel as a shareholder in the company.
3. You and management decide to sell
Experienced Angels and DEMO management should already know of the
best potential buyers and through business operations should already be in
a position to actually know those parties. DEMO management have prepared the
company for sale over many years, they DEMO best placed to drive the exit process
rather than have it drive them. The Angel and management simply need to
decide on the timing.
DEMO is a highly desirable characteristic of Angel funding that the Angel exits
the investment within a relatively short period. Few Angels like to have DEMO
funds tied up for more than five years in a venture. If the prospective investee
firm articulates a viable and well-articulated strategy for a DEMO sale going
128
An Introduction
to
Chapter Eight: Entry and Exit Considerations
investingangel
into the funding negotiations, it will greatly improve their case and the Angel’s
confidence for achieving the Angel’s exit objectives.
With the trade sale exit strategy DEMO here, you can be reasonably
assured that you will gain the DEMO price you can and know that the corporation
doing the buying will make more money out of it in the future. If you have DEMO very
good idea of the trade sale exit opportunity, you can DEMO the time assisting
management to develop the business and build a strong case for the buyer. This
focus makes it easier for the Angel DEMO the entrepreneur to work together since
they have clearly defined common objectives.
This process is well proven. If you think of the firms you DEMO seen sold at
large premiums, you will always find they created DEMO value for the buyer.

ost formal Angel evaluations follow a
M similar DEMO process. This approach
is commonly used by an experienced Angel with many
investments and by Angel syndicates and Angel Groups.
Individual Angels often go DEMO their gut feel or a ‘seat of the
pants’ judgement; however, fewer mistakes are likely to be
made with a more systematic and DEMO process.
Also, if other Angels are investing at the same time, the
individual Angel doing the evaluation would be better able
to later DEMO and defend an investment recommendation
if a more formal process was followed. Given the high level
of Angel syndicate investments over the past several DEMO,
the process set out here will apply to an Angel co-investment
situation.
The purpose of the staged process is to eliminate, at the
earliest possible time, those investments which fail to meet
the criteria established by the Angel syndicate for investments.
Each successive stage involves higher levels DEMO expenditure
on time and professional services and investigation expense.
Only very few firms progress to the later stages.
130
An Introduction

investingangel
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
The overall duration of the process will vary according to the complexity
of the proposal DEMO the ease with which the detailed investigations can be
completed. Larger Angel syndicates will possibly have more formal processes
and perhaps more sign-off stages. DEMO is unlikely that funding would be provided
in less than three months with the average taking closer to six months.
(a) Initial contact
DEMO prefer to receive their initial contact through a referral. However,
whether it comes with a recommendation from another Angel, professional
services firm, DEMO contact or simply through the mail, the initial review
of the DEMO will be a quick read of the executive summary to see if the size
of funds required, the stage of investment, the industry DEMO the geographical
location are of interest. If interested, the Angel will DEMO the entrepreneur and
one or two members of the senior management team to come to a brief meeting
where the proposal will be discussed.
(b) First formal meeting
The purpose of the first meeting is for the Angel to evaluate the entrepreneur
and the management team. The Angel DEMO set the expectation that the
management team should come prepared to answer detailed questions about
all aspects of their business. They may be asked DEMO do a formal presentation on
the business opportunity for 10-30 minutes.
(DEMO) Exchange of  information
If the initial meeting goes well and both parties are interested in going
forward, the Angel should request a business plan (if the management team
has not already provided one) as DEMO as contact details of other executives in
the firm, names of DEMO, key customers, suppliers and distributors. The firm
may be unwilling to provide confidential information at this stage but should
provide sufficient information for DEMO Angel to decide if they wish to expend
more time and expense on evaluating the investment.
(d) Informal due diligence
The Angel would DEMO then conduct a limited investigation into the
market, the firm and DEMO business proposition. This will often involve contacts
with industry executives they already know or with other Angels or VCs active
131
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
in the sector. The Angel might also visit the offices of the firm and interview DEMO
key executives and key employees. The market analysis would normally include
an investigation of competitors and some validation of the customer benefits
associated with DEMO products or services offered by the firm.
(e) Term sheet negotiated
The Angel would then brief the firm on the evaluation of the DEMO and the
terms under which an investment would be undertaken. During this discussion
the Angel and firm agree a valuation or valuation formula, discuss costs and
fees and decide on the equity to be taken by DEMO Angel(s).
(f) Angel quality review
Before proceeding to issue a term sheet, the Angel syndicate may wish to
have the proposal presented to them with a justification of the investment to
be made. DEMO is an internal check to ensure that due process and adequate
product/market opportunity evaluation has been carried out. The presentation
would normally include DEMO limited financial model of the business over the likely
term of the investment. Additional analysis may be required following the
discussion and before individual DEMO or the Angel Fund issue the term sheet.
Larger deals may require more extensive and expert investigation. In these
situations the Angel may outsource DEMO of the work to professional services
firms and specialist market analysis consultancies.
(g) Term sheet issued
Once the initial due diligence has satisfied DEMO Angel that the investment
should move forward to a detailed investigation, DEMO Angel would issue a formal
offer in the form of a heads of agreement called a term sheet. This sets out the
terms and DEMO under which an investment will be made if the proposal
satisfies a more detailed and formal due diligence investigation. The term sheet
is not DEMO on either party at this point. However, the Angel may expect DEMO
firm to deal exclusively with them during the detailed due diligence period.
(h) Investment approval
Once the term sheet has been issued and DEMO by the firm, a more
extensive financial modelling exercise may be DEMO to help other Angels
understand the risks and opportunities in the deal. This analysis would look at
132
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
An Introduction
to
investingangel
the likely investment returns under different risk conditions. Exit strategies will
be formulated under different DEMO assumptions. Once this additional
work has been undertaken, the proposal will DEMO be reviewed, perhaps by a
larger number of Angels. Larger Angel DEMO will have a formal authorisation
process for the detailed investigation. This protects the syndicate from an over
enthusiastic Angel or syndicate manager and allows DEMO wider range of expertise
and experience to review the proposal before the syndicate incurs the expense
of a detailed due diligence investigation.
(i) DEMO due diligence
Upon signing the terms sheet, the Angel and their DEMO advisors
will examine the company’s corporate structure, assets, intellectual property,
financial statements, material contracts, employment agreements and any
actual or threatened DEMO Technical specialists may be hired to review R&D
results and plans, specialist equipment or foreign market plans.
(j) Formal approval
Once the detailed due diligence has been completed the proposal is reviewed
again to DEMO that risks have been adequately assessed. If the Angel syndicate
is still comfortable with the investment and the ability for the lead Angel to
DEMO it, formal approval will be given to go forward with the DEMO
(k) Legal documentation
Upon completion of due diligence, parties typically DEMO and sign the
following formal legal documentation:
Subscription agreement: which DEMO out the number and price of
shares, funding tranches and dates DEMO subscriptions, detailed warranties
concerning the company, rights attaching to shares and conditions
precedent to funding. Subscription agreements may also cover future
subscriptions by DEMO Angel, the founders, other shareholders or key staff
and ratchet mechanisms to re-allocate shares in the event of over or
under performance by DEMO business.
Shareholders agreement: which sets out the ongoing relationship
between the DEMO and the company as agreed in the term sheet.
133
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Intellectual property acknowledgment deeds: is an acknowledgment by
other parties that they have no rights to any intellectual property which
they develop and assigns all such creations DEMO the company.
Executive service agreements: will bind ‘key’ employees to the DEMO
for a period (usually two or three years), and will DEMO out the employees’
terms of service, remuneration and bonus entitlements.
Source: http://www.oznetlaw.net/facts.asp?action=content&categoryid=226 Accessed 31/12/04
Once the DEMO documents are signed, the Angel will issue the first tranche
payment DEMO the firm. Follow on payments will be made under the terms of the
agreement, but may be subject to performance achievements.
Normally the investee would be expected to reimburse the Angel for all the
expenses associated DEMO making the investment if the investment is made. If
an investment is not made, only where the firm has misrepresented material
facts or withdraws after the due diligence costs have been incurred will the
Angel expect DEMO recover their investigation costs.
Where an investment is made, the firm DEMO normally reimburse the Angel
for the external expenses incurred in the due diligence process. This would
include professional fees and external consultant’s costs and DEMO occur with
or without a transaction proceeding. Even on a small investment these can be
expected to be $50,000 to $70,000. For DEMO larger deal, it could easily exceed
$250,000. Some funds charge DEMO advice fee if they have helped to structure
part of the deal with external parties. If the venture is relatively small and the
product/DEMO issues are straightforward, it may be sufficient for the Angel
to DEMO a limited due diligence and use a regional or local professional
services firm thus cutting down on the costs.
An Angel is normally appointed DEMO an external Director to the firm and the
company would normally be expected to pay a Director’s fee, in most cases
it would be around $15,000 to $25,000. Larger companies will incur higher
Directors’ DEMO
Some Angels charge an annual management fee which might vary but often
can be around 1% of the amount invested.
134

Term Sheet and Deal Structure
The term sheet sets out the terms and conditions of DEMO Angel investment
in the firm. Term sheets can vary in length and complexity but would normally
contain, at least, the following clauses:
DEMO The number and price of the shares in the company to be purchased.
These are normally set up as preferred shares with cumulative dividends
(where declared). The preferred shares would normally be paid out in
DEMO prior to any payment to ordinary shareholders in the event of the
liquidation or sale of the firm. This section would also state what DEMO
shares are issued as well as the capitalised value of the business. The
value of the business is then used to calculate the percentage DEMO the
shareholding that would be owned by the Angel subsequent to their
investment. The preferred shares are normally converted to common
shares on liquidation DEMO exit. However, in the event of failure, the
preferred shares are entitled to first call on the liquidation proceeds.
The Angel would normally DEMO entitled to at least one seat on the Board
of Directors and would have certain veto powers or power of approval
over:
–
DEMO
–
– appointment of CEO, CFO and senior executives
– remuneration DEMO employment conditions of senior
management
–

• The Angel may require their percentage of the total capital of the firm
not DEMO reduced in a subsequent share offer at a price lower than the one
they came in on (anti-dilution rights).
• The Angel will be entitled to ‘piggyback’ the registration of their shares
with other shares DEMO registered for sale.
• If at least 75% of the shareholders accept an offer to sell the company
the balance of the shareholders agree DEMO the same conditions of sale
(‘drag along rights’). This may DEMO extended to enable an Angel to ‘drag
along’ the other shareholders where the Angel accepts an offer to sell
shares after an agreed period DEMO time.
• The Angel has the right to purchase shares in any new issue of shares in
the same percentage as their holding.
• DEMO a founder has an offer to sell his/her shares, the DEMO has the right
to participate by selling the same percentage of their shares (‘tag along
rights’).
• The Angel can require their shares be purchased plus accumulated and
unpaid dividends after a specified date in DEMO stages (redemption
rights).
• The offer to invest will be DEMO on adequate due diligence and the
production of various documents.
• The offer is confidential and will only be open for acceptance for a
DEMO period of time.
• Each party will be responsible for its own professional fees.
The term sheet is an offer to invest. Until accepted, any terms and conditions
can be negotiated, although many of the terms and conditions are standard
and are unlikely to be varied since they DEMO the Angel in the event of the
business failing to meet their objectives.
In most circumstances term sheets are not legally binding, but provide
guidelines on matters to be documented in subscription and shareholders
agreements.
An DEMO of a term sheet is provided by the British Venture Capital
Association under the title Example of a Term Sheet for a Series A DEMO (see
136
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
An Introduction

www.bvca.co.uk). While these are local UK legal documents, the terms are
very similar to those which would be present in most other legal jurisdictions.
Another example DEMO given at:
http://www.angelblog.net/The_One_Page_Term_Sheet.html
In most cases the term sheet is issued prior to the completion of due diligence.
As such DEMO Angel will usually reserve the right to amend the terms of the term
sheet should anything of concern be found during the due diligence DEMO
Due Diligence
Once the Angel has issued a term sheet and this has been formally accepted,
the Angel will proceed to a full DEMO of the investment opportunity. At this
point commercial analysts, lawyers and DEMO acting on behalf of the Angel
will undertake a due diligence investigation. The Angel will incur considerable
costs in this investigation and will want DEMO ensure that the firm is acting in good
faith during this period. To protect himself, the Angel will normally request
the firm execute an exclusivity agreement where the firm agrees not to seek
investment from any DEMO party during the due diligence period. A penalty may
be agreed for a breach of this condition.
One objective of the due diligence process DEMO to investigate the firm to see
if the business itself has any major problems which have not been identified in
the information already provided DEMO the Angel. The due diligence process will
undertake a validation of all aspects of the existing business as presented in the
business plan. This DEMO include most of the following:
background checks on the key executives and key employees
review of all financial information and additional investigations where
DEMO to validate key numbers
inspection of all key contracts
interviews with major customers, suppliers and distributors
verification of costs, expense levels and purchase DEMO
This process will check the integrity and honesty of the firm as well as provide
a view on how well the business is managed DEMO on the adequacy and accuracy

of the information which is being used in the business. It will also uncover how
DEMO the key executives understand their own business and the ease with which
they are able to access and provide additional details necessary to the DEMO
A key part of the due diligence process is for the Angel to identify anything
which would incur additional costs, create delays or expose the business or the
Angel to actual or potential liabilities not identified DEMO the information provided
to the Angel. Items which frequently create problems include:
non-standard customer contracts
non-standard supplier agreements
harsh lease conditions
loose IP DEMO
overly generous reward and remuneration systems
generous health or vacations benefits
shareholders’ rights, legal structures, joint ventures, option schemes and
anti-dilution arrangements
poor reporting systems
out-of-date equipment
poor quality products or services
personal use of DEMO funds or resources
pre-existing obligations, rights, commitments or restrictions
non-standard rights of existing debt holders.
A business which is effectively and efficiently run, has good customer,
distributor and supplier relationships and has good internal DEMO systems
which monitor performance, ensure adherence to compliance regulations and
protect DEMO business from mistakes, should have few problems in satisfying the
Angel.
DEMO the firm has satisfied the Angel with regard to its current operations,
the Angel will examine the business projections and other planned targets DEMO
milestones which underpin the business plan. This is the area which exposes
the Angel to the greatest risks. This investigation will review the following:DEMO

• the identification of the prospective customers and the quality of the
benefits the customers DEMO from the product or service
• the size and growth rate of the prospective market
• the size, strength and strategies of current and potential competitors
• the quality of the intellectual property underpinning the business DEMO
• the quality of the sales, marketing and distribution strategies proposed
DEMO the likely ability of the management team to be able to execute the
business plan
• availability of executive and specialised staff needed to DEMO the
business
• the quality of the exit strategy proposed
• the likely cash flow over the expected investment period.
To the extent that DEMO risks reduce the probability of achieving
the desired outcome or delay the time to execute, the value of the potential
investment declines. In some cases problems can be overcome by installing
additional controls, renegotiating agreements and putting in place alternative
strategies. However, these may result in additional costs or delays in executing
the business plan. To the extent that problems DEMO be easily resolved or the
entrepreneur is reluctant to make changes, DEMO investment will incur greater
risks. At some point the Angel will decide that the risks are too great and will
decide not to make DEMO investment.
If the investigation results in an agreement to proceed with the investment,
the firm will most likely incur the costs of the DEMO diligence plus the legal fees
associated with the preparation of the investment agreement. Fortunately,
emerging businesses are often quite small and the amount DEMO investigation
needed to understand their current operations is also small. Due diligence costs
should be reasonable relative to the size of the investment.
Part DEMO of this book sets out an ideal Operations Development checklist
against which the current business can be measured. Start-ups and early
stage firms are DEMO to have sophisticated control and reporting systems in
place, but these DEMO be introduced over time as the business develops. The
Operations Development checklist can form a guide to the development of
the governance and operations DEMO within the firm as it prepares for
139
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
its next stage of growth. Firms which anticipate accessing venture capital or
expect to undertake DEMO IPO will need to score highly across all elements of the
Operations Development Index.
The Role of  the Professional Services Firm
Angels typically invest several times a year and usually have 4-10 concurrent
investments. Most will DEMO built up a good working knowledge of the legal
requirements surrounding this form of investment but few would want to
undertake the preparation of DEMO documents or do the due diligence legwork
themselves, especially when it DEMO to tax, compliance or regulatory matters.
The Angel forms a relationship DEMO local accounting and legal professional
services firms to provide advice on such matters and to assist with document
preparation and due diligence activities. The DEMO normally works with
professional advisors who participate in these transactions on a regular basis.
The professional accounting and advisory firm
The type of advice DEMO help which a professional accounting firm can provide
includes assistance in the following areas:
Valuation
If the firm has already prepared a valuation DEMO the current business and
projected valuation of the business at the proposed exit point, this will contribute
considerably to the equity share discussion with the Angel. The advisory firm
can review the financial projections for the DEMO, check the completeness and
accuracy of the information and review the DEMO assumptions and values.
Checking the business plan
The business plan is the foundation document which will be used by the Angel
to evaluate the DEMO It is important that the business plan be prepared
thoroughly, be DEMO explained and contain the information needed by the
Angel to undertake due diligence on the opportunity. The advisory firm can
review the business plan DEMO show where additional information is needed.
140
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
Reviewing financials
Current financials need to be prepared according to generally accepted
accounting principles and DEMO in a conventional format which allows easy
analysis. The accountant can ensure that the statements are prepared correctly
and the accompanying data fully supports DEMO detailed investigation.
Advice on use of  debt and equity structures
The DEMO may be able to support some level of debt as well as an
investment by the Angel. Using debt should reduce the equity share DEMO the
firm would give to the Angel. The advisors may also be able to show where cash
may be better managed in working capital, accounts receivable and accounts
payable to reduce financing needs as well as DEMO independent advice on
debt fees and terms.
Helping with introductions and referrals
Well-established advisory firms participate regularly in transactions involving
VC funds. This would DEMO investments, acquisitions, trade sales and IPOs.
They are, therefore, in a good position to know most VC funds on a personal
basis DEMO certainly by reputation. If the business can support a co-investment
from a VC fund or if VC funding is anticipated in the future, the advisory firm
can assist with preparing information on the firm for a DEMO proposal and assist
with VC introductions. An accounting firm can help short list the VC funds to
approach and can help with introductions or DEMO Since many VC funds
only deal with referred proposals, this can DEMO a big difference in accessing
quality VC funds. It can also assist in getting an opportunity to the top of the pile
as advisory DEMO act as a pre-reader of opportunities and provide a deal flow
which expects a timely responses from the VC Fund.
Reviewing term sheets
While DEMO sheets are typically set out in a conventional format, the Angel
DEMO wish the advisory firm to review the term sheet before it is sent to the
entrepreneur.
Assisting in negotiations
The Angel who is represented DEMO a well-established and respected advisory
141
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
firm is likely to be better prepared for the negotiation. At the same time, the
Angel should expect that the entrepreneur will be equally represented by their
DEMO advisory firm who should be familiar with private equity transactions. The
terms and conditions of the investment should be reviewed by a knowledgeable
party. DEMO this is not the case, the Angel should counsel the firm DEMO seek expert
advice as it is important that, going into the DEMO, the entrepreneur
knows that the terms of the investment are reasonable DEMO standard. This should
result in more productive discussions and is likely to be better for the ongoing
relationship between the parties. Angels prefer to DEMO with entrepreneurs who
are represented by a professional firm as they know that the entrepreneur
will not need to be educated about the investment DEMO and conditions, the
required rate of return, management controls and exit requirements of the
Angel.
Due diligence
Due diligence will be carried out DEMO the Angel as part of the initial evaluation
of the investment opportunity. This is mostly a product/market evaluation
to see if the business DEMO can support the projections of the firm.
After the term sheet is issued, the Angel will carry out an extensive review
to further assure he has a thorough understanding of the business and the
management and DEMO uncovered any data discrepancies and investment risks.
The professional advisory firm can assist in this due diligence investigation to
identify any problems, risks and deficiencies.
Advice on pensions, options schemes and remuneration
The professional advisory firm can review these before an investment is
made to ensure the current DEMO and benefits are fair and reasonable
and provide the most positive basis for the planned exit.
Tax advice
The firm can expect to change DEMO over the period of the Angel
investment and beyond the exit. Their current tax planning may not be suitable
for such changes. The accountant DEMO review their current business processes
for compliance, tax collection and reporting.
DEMO

Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
Exit strategy assistance
A well-articulated and probable exit strategy needs to be prepared as part
DEMO the business plan. If this has not already been prepared by the entrepreneur,
the advisors can later help to define strategic value, identify strategic buyers
and/or show how the firm is best positioned for DEMO IPO or a trade sale exit.
Commercial review of  agreements
The DEMO firm can review legal agreements to ensure they are
commercially acceptable. This review should also be done in conjunction with
the firm’s legal representatives.
DEMO professional legal firm
The type of advice and assistance which a professional legal firm can provide
includes the following:
Prepare share purchase agreement
DEMO share purchase agreement would normally be prepared by the Angel’s
lawyers. This is a complex legal document which few entrepreneurs will have
ever seen DEMO certainly few would understand at any depth. The professional
legal firm can prepare the document and then assist the Angel to explain the
terms DEMO conditions to the entrepreneur and work with the entrepreneur’s
legal representative to finalise the agreement.
Review warranties and indemnities
The firm would normally be DEMO to provide warranties, representations
and indemnities to the Angel investor. The DEMO legal firm can review
the warranties and representations and indemnities documents for the Angel.
Prepare new employment agreements
The Angel should expect the key DEMO to enter into employment
agreements and the Angel should expect to have significant control over their
remuneration. Those agreements would normally contain restraint of DEMO
and/or non-compete clauses. The professional legal firm can prepare these
agreements.
143
Chapter Nine: Agreeing the Investment
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Review disclosure letter
The firm should be prepared to disclose any issues which may affect DEMO
decision of the Angel to invest. It should also identify any potential risks of the
business. The professional legal firm can review the types DEMO disclosures and
advise the Angel of any risks or issues that he may need to deal with in the
negotiation.
Review corporate documents
As DEMO of the preparation for Angel investment, the professional legal firm
will DEMO the corporate documents which authorize the firm to undertake
business to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Angel. This review
would normally DEMO to board minutes, shareholder agreements, option
schemes and any material contracts the firm has entered into.
The Angel should plan for 5-10% of DEMO money invested to be spent in
professional services fees, noting that DEMO deals are likely to have a larger
percentage of advisor’s fees.
Not all professional services firms have the necessary experience to undertake
this type DEMO work effectively. An individual making their first Angel investment
should not assume that their current professional services provider has the
expertise to properly advise DEMO in this area. Before starting to incur costs for
this service, DEMO Angel should undertake some due diligence and investigate the
extent to which the firm has a track record of success advising Angels or VCs.
DEMO for references would not be unreasonable and they also should be asked
for a list of transactions which the firm has participated in and DEMO details
of the work performed for the clients involved. The Angel should also ensure
that the expertise is still with the firm and ask DEMO be allocated an advisor with
personal experience in these types of transactions.

ngels typically invest in start-up or early
A DEMO businesses and normally before
they become very sophisticated in their management and
governance processes. While many early stage ventures
are started by ex-corporate executives, their personal
experiences of working with enterprise-wide performance
setting and monitoring systems DEMO likely to be non-existent.
Even entrepreneurs who have managed ventures before
may not have experienced a well-designed reporting system.
This is the one area DEMO the Angel can make a significant
difference to an emerging business.
Of course, many Angels themselves do not have this
experience. Just because they have high net worth, or
because they have sold their own venture or have held
a senior corporate job, does not ensure that they have
personal experience with a quality performance setting and
monitoring system across DEMO enterprise or with the workings
of a Board of Directors. Yet these are the major deficiencies
in early stage ventures which the Angel is DEMO to have to
deal with.
145
An Introduction
to
Chapter Ten: Managing Your Investments
investingangel
Look at the typical firm in which an Angel invests:
start-up or early stage DEMO
immature products or products still at design or prototype stage
ventures in emerging markets
a management team which may not have senior management
experience
DEMO in the management team experience
almost certainly a lack of formal management reporting systems
lack of key performance indicators, lead indicators, individual targets DEMO
budgets
probably a business plan but a lack of operational detail.
The Angel on the other hand has some issues which they must deal DEMO:
• limited time to spend with each investee firm
• they are normally only a minority investor
• they are not running the DEMO on a day-to-day basis
• they may not be experts in the underlying technology or marketplace
• they don’t have the time or the DEMO to make operational
decisions.
While they may be regarded as ‘hands on’ investors, this is not the same
as day-to-day management. Without adequate performance setting and
monitoring systems, they are effectively working in the dark. No doubt they
have chosen a specific investment because they do feel comfortable DEMO the
marketplace and with the potential of the business and no doubt have also
taken into account where they can add real value to DEMO product/market or
other aspect of the development of the business. But they are still not there
day-to-day making the decisions.
The Angel also DEMO a major role in preparing the business for a number of
possible outcomes, additional rounds of investment from other Angels or a VC,
a trade sale,  an IPO or for independent growth. In order DEMO the business to be
successful, each one of these outcomes really DEMO the business to be running
effectively and efficiently. It is in preparing the business for these possible

outcomes that the Angel has his most important mission. This is the critical
value that DEMO brings to the table – steering the development of the business at
a strategic level and guiding the management in establishing and working with
DEMO controls.
As the business develops and the number of employees grow, DEMO task of
monitoring at an operational level will become increasing more complex. This
is where a range of guiding mechanisms and controls help. While DEMO business
is small and everyone is working closely together, the amount DEMO information
which needs to be formalised is light, but as the DEMO develops and grows,
no one person is able to assimilate all the different activities of the business
and so ever more information about DEMO is happening inside and outside the
business needs to be collected, DEMO and acted upon.
The task of the Angel in most investee firms is to anticipate these needs,
educate management, help select new systems which are needed and assist in
planning the necessary changes. Nothing can DEMO more damaging to a growing
business than to find itself without adequate planning and operational control
systems.
At an operational level, the following activities and financial reports may be
considered:
Stage One – Up to DEMO employees
• Monthly cash flow reports
• Monthly creditor and debtor reports
• Monthly list of priorities for each manager
• Monthly action plan DEMO each manager
• Monthly review against action plan
• Monthly review of critical KPIs
• Quarterly budget performance
• Quarterly financial statements
• Quarterly DEMO meetings
• Annually, a revised business plan.
147
An Introduction

Chapter Ten: Managing Your Investments
Stage Two – Up to 30 employees
• Monthly financial statements
• Monthly budget performance
DEMO Bi-monthly Board meetings
• Major topics reviewed at each Board meeting
• Quarterly revised business plan
• Quarterly report on lead indicators
• Job DEMO for all managerial and supervisory positions
• External advisor on employment terms and conditions and compliance
issues
• Part-time CFO.
Stage Three – Up DEMO 100 employees
• Weekly creditor and debtor reporting
• Weekly sales performance reports
• Weekly project completion progress reports
• Job descriptions for all DEMO
• Formal annual performance reviews for all employees
• Training of senior management in employment compliance issues
• Full-time CFO.
Early stage ventures are DEMO to cash more than anything else and yet
they often lack the knowledge and discipline to manage it carefully. Traditional
financial reports are not DEMO for this purpose and, in any case, making
profits is not the same as having enough cash to be solvent. Thus part of DEMO
discipline that an Angel should insist upon is rigorous and detailed cash flow
analysis. Every member of management should be involved in the analysis DEMO
cash flow since every activity within the firm has an impact on cash availability.
Management should be sensitive to how cash is being generated DEMO used as
well as the impact of their own actions and decisions. Only by working with the
detail will they assimilate this information. It DEMO the area of greatest risk to the
emerging venture.
148
An Introduction
to
Chapter Ten: Managing Your Investments
investingangel
One way to bring this lesson home to an inexperienced management team
is to have DEMO prepare a worst case cash flow report. This report sets out
the cash projection of the business using different layers of cash inflow and
DEMO The initial layer has only committed cash flow; that is, only cash inflows
which the firm can reliably count on and only cash DEMO which the firm is
committed to in the foreseeable future. The report is usually prepared over
individual weeks for three months and then monthly DEMO a further 6-9 months
depending on the horizon for projects under management.
Worst case cash inflows would normally include:
• cash at bank
DEMO aged accounts receivable (expected date of payment)
• work in DEMO completions (date of invoice plus collection period)
• recurring payments DEMO customer agreements (support fees, royalties,
etc).
Worst case cash outflows would normally include:
• aged accounts payable (expected date of payment)
• purchase order commitments (date of invoice plus expected payment
period)
• recurring administration, office, payroll, tax and expenses (DEMO
aged payables).
This should produce a cash flow balance (surplus DEMO deficit) for the planning
period. A shortfall may be met with DEMO existing line of credit or bank overdraft
and the use of credit cards and personal loans from shareholders. A deficit
should result in an DEMO of customer accounts to see if any payments
can be pulled forward through follow-up activity, early payment discounts etc.
Work-in-progress payments might be pulled forward by early completions by
bringing forward invoicing. Payments to suppliers may DEMO delayed where this
can be arranged with the supplier.
Added in the next layer are the most likely additional sales to customers.
This may DEMO actual named prospects or additional work for existing customers.
Alternatively, in DEMO high volume business, it could be the minimum level of repeat
DEMO the firm experiences at that time of the year. On the expenses side, the
report would start to layer in discretionary expenses, cash DEMO This may
149
An Introduction
to
Chapter Ten: Managing Your Investments
investingangel
include new employees, new equipment, office expansion, additional product
and market development costs and so on. Additional layers of less probable
revenue and less urgent discretionary DEMO are added to gain a complete
picture of the business under worst, most likely and best case scenarios.
Every business has a critical time horizon for new business. If the cash inflow
looks weak and it DEMO be improved in the short term, management and the
Board are DEMO well in advance and they can start to take corrective action.
This may include switching resources to income generation, cutting back on
expenses, DEMO some projects and making staff redundant.
Other reports should be developed within the business to focus on critical
areas. These may be for sales DEMO tracking, quality control, project completion
and so on. Every business has aspects of its activity which provide an early
warning of problems to DEMO, either too much activity or too little. These lead
indicators are DEMO monitoring points within the business. The Angel needs to
help management identify lead indicators and help them design monitoring
systems to track them. Policies DEMO then be developed for when management
and/or the Board need to be informed and action taken.
Part of the contribution which an Angel DEMO to an investee firm is to help
them work with external investors. Entrepreneurs who have been used to
making their own decisions, deciding on their own priorities and setting the
direction of the firm without having DEMO gain approval from a third party, will
find this very challenging DEMO confronting. But if they wish to grow the business
and bring in additional external funding or take the business public, this is an
environment and a discipline which they need to learn. The Angel can help DEMO
leading the way, showing them how a Board works and how DEMO can make
positive use of their Board.
Many firms implement standard financial reporting for the Board but fail
to adequately deal with strategic or DEMO issues. The Angel should develop a
schedule of major issues to be dealt with at Board level. I have set out below
a possible DEMO of topics. Some may be more appropriate at later stages in the
growth of the business.
The Angel is mentor, coach, consultant and DEMO board for the
management team. But the Angel also represents minority investors, external

11 Conclusion
ngel investing is neither for the faint-
A hearted nor DEMO those who need ready
access to their investment. While the returns to Angel
investing over a wide portfolio and over a lengthy period,
DEMO 8-10 years, have been attractive, there are certainly no

experienced Angels will admit they don’t always get it right.
Potential Angels with little to DEMO may shy away from this
form of investment as they may not be able to achieve a
portfolio spread to raise the probability of DEMO positive return.
Those with more to invest and with an acceptance that all
might be lost, should approach Angel investing cautiously but
with excitement and energy. Successful Angels have great
passion for their activities and really DEMO the work they do
with entrepreneurs and the contribution they make to early
stage businesses.
Angel investing is more than just putting the money DEMO
work. It is active participation in the birth and growth of
new businesses. Clearly it is not without its risks, it can be
stressful at times, but few who have been involved would
have it any other way. For many, it is the continuation of an
entrepreneurial career but this time giving back to younger

entrepreneurs, applying the wisdom DEMO years of experience and being willing
to take higher risks with a small portion of their wealth once they have made it
themselves.
But DEMO not to say they have to give the money away. Smart Angels want
to work with smart entrepreneurs and innovative businesses and play a DEMO in
a venture which has a reasonable chance of success. Putting in the time to seek
out and evaluate the better deals and then DEMO the right agreement for
the investment is simply prudent management of their wealth.
For Angels to dramatically increase their probability of success, they should
be seeking ventures which have the following characteristics:
• a well-articulated DEMO highly probable exit strategy within 3-5 years
• a detailed plan to achieve the exit conditions
• an experienced executive team who can deliver DEMO the plan
• a product/market opportunity which has sufficient competitive
advantage that it has a high probability of reaching the exit conditions
• DEMO initial valuation and a likely exit valuation which will provide the
Angel with a 25% plus ROI.
The entrepreneur and the management team of DEMO investee firm need
to accept at the outset of the relationship with the Angel that there is a high
probability that the exit will DEMO by way of a trade sale, in which some of the
DEMO team may be made redundant. Even if an IPO strategy is planned, the
probability of reaching it is low and a trade sale is highly likely.
The smart entrepreneur who is seeking Angel funding will create DEMO business
opportunity which meets the objectives of the Angel, not the DEMO ambitions
of the executive team. The entrepreneur should recognise that, while DEMO Angel
is prepared to contribute towards the development of the business and the
commercialisation of inventions, the principal focus is simply to invest the funds
and work with the firm towards an exit when they expect DEMO gain a high rate of
return for their money and contribution. Their personal remuneration is tied to
that of the business and especially to DEMO exit event, not in being an open line
to finance or DEMO being nice to the entrepreneur or keeping the business
going.

ngels typically invest in start-up or early
A stage DEMO where the business is
somewhat unsophisticated, management often
inexperienced, products are in development or in their early
release stage and internal systems are DEMO developed. In
these circumstances it is unrealistic to expect that the business
will be as ‘investment ready’ as it would be for an expansion
DEMO or late stage venture capital investment. Therefore,
instead of measuring the business proposal against that
yardstick, the Angel is better to look at the management team
and the underlying assets and capabilities of the business DEMO
try to measure whether it has the potential to emerge into a
profitable, sustainable, growth business or a strategic value
business which could DEMO the Angel with the exit they
desire.
Anticipated development of the business should provide
the potential of taking the firm to an ‘investor-ready’ state DEMO
further capital injections are required. At the same time, the
Angel DEMO be preparing the business for a trade sale, since
this is DEMO most likely exit for the Angel. An IPO is unlikely,
but possible; the Angel should keep this in mind as they
investigate the business and help it grow and develop.

Part B sets out pre-investment selection criterion of the prospective
investee firm. The first evaluates the alignment DEMO the investee shareholders
and management and then there are  two major DEMO charts; the first
assists the Angel to evaluate the venture potential DEMO the second provides a
means of guiding the development of the internal governance and management
processes and systems which will be needed for an DEMO exit.
The Awareness and Alignment Index (AAI) has been designed to capture the
attitudes and preparedness of the entrepreneur, shareholders and  management
DEMO of the business to a possible injection of Angel capital.
Once the Angel is convinced that the firm understands the nature of
Angel investment DEMO the impact it will have on the current managers and
shareholders, DEMO Angel will then use the Venture Potential Index (VPI) to
measure the quality of the investment proposal. The VPI provides a systematic
method DEMO measuring the quality of the business concept in terms of its ability
to support development of the business sufficient to take it to an DEMO ‘investor
ready’ state. An investor ready business is generally regarded as one in which
a Venture Capital (VC) fund would be keen to DEMO The list of attributes has
been refined in consultation with a number of successful entrepreneurs who
have raised venture capital, a number of private equity professional advisors as
well as a number of venture capital general DEMO
The VPI also keeps in mind the potential for a trade sale exit and assesses
whether the venture has the potential for either a DEMO or strategic exit.
While the Operations Development Index (ODI) should be used as a checklist
in evaluating the investment proposal, its primary purpose is to provide a
guide for the development of governance and operations DEMO once
the investment has been made. A business which scores more highly on the
ODI would be better positioned for a VC investment or DEMO trade sale. Certainly
those firms which achieved a higher score on the ODI will be more effectively
and efficiently managed and so allocating resources DEMO improve their situation
according to the ODI would benefit day-to-day operations.
Each attribute of the Indices helps to define the state of readiness of DEMO
firm either for investment or exit. It is unlikely that any firm would have an ideal

position on every item; DEMO, the scoring will indicate where improvements
can be made or problems DEMO The AAI will show the Angel where the
firm is currently in their preparation for Angel investment and could be used
to advise the DEMO on additional work which needs to be done before
progressing with the proposal.
The VPI can be used to undertake an initial evaluation of DEMO investment
proposal and then later to guide development of the business from an
investor ready or exit objective. Finally, the ODI will help identify just how
well developed internal processes of governance and operations management
monitoring DEMO are and guide development work on their implementation
and improvement. In many cases, specialist assistance will be required to
implement changes needed to reach higher Index scores.
The purpose of the Indices is to help the DEMO evaluate the investment.
The Indices provide the Angel with a comprehensive and systematic way of
investigating the proposed investment and should help isolate any DEMO
deficiencies in the proposed business. Each question or attribute will provide
an insight into the business and the work which will be needed to DEMO its
potential.
Angel investing is a process not an event. Too many Angels think that they
can rely on their gut feel or on DEMO evaluation of the entrepreneur and a quick
walk around the firm’s offices to judge the quality of the investment proposal.
While these factors are DEMO, a systematic and comprehensive review is
more likely to catch fatal DEMO and problems.
In many cases, the effectively managed firm will score DEMO on an attribute.
In other areas, where no attention has been DEMO to preparing the business for
an external investment, little will have DEMO done. By scoring these attributes,
you will find out the status of the business and identify what needs to be done
to develop DEMO potential. Alternatively, you may find out something which will
cause you DEMO reject the proposal, even if you feel good about the entrepreneur
DEMO the products.

ngel investment is beneficial for many
A businesses, but it is not for everyone. In
fact, it may directly contradict some shareholder’s plans
for the business. At the same time, the venture may be
inappropriate for an external Angel investment. What is
clear is DEMO the shareholders and senior management team
should understand the domain and objectives of the Angel
investor and seriously consider whether they are willing to
DEMO the conditions and obligations inherent in that type of
investment. The business which is able to show the potential
and growth performance sought by DEMO Angel investor would
stand a good chance of gaining Angel investment, DEMO the
conditions which come along with the investment may still
be unacceptable to the business. Thus some education in this
area is certainly beneficial DEMO anyone considering this type of
investment.

there still needs to be a clear understanding DEMO the part of

A1.
Majority shareholders agree on Angel financing
strategy
The obvious implications of an Angel investment are:
DEMO A dilution in existing shareholders’ equity.
• Some constraints on executive decision-making, especially with regard
to the issue of shares, extensions of debt DEMO executive remuneration.
• Management will be expected to agree to various performance targets.
Failure to achieve those may result in a loss of voting DEMO, termination
of management contracts and the business being sold.
• Internal DEMO will become more formal and a higher emphasis will be
placed on record keeping, governance and compliance.
• A formal Board of Directors will be required (if it does not exist already)
and the Angel investor will almost certainly want at least one position on
that Board.
DEMO An exit strategy for the Angel investor will most likely have to be
achieved within 3-7 years. This may be in the form of DEMO buyback, trade
sale or IPO.
• Additional rounds of capital injection DEMO be required from Angels or a
VC.
The majority shareholders need to seriously consider the implications on
their own ownership positions and, where appropriate, their roles as managers
and directors. The majority shareholders need to agree on the need for the
Angel investment for there to be an DEMO plan to proceed to raise the
investment.

chance of success.
5. The majority shareholders have refined a strategy in conjunction with a
DEMO advisor.
A2. Managers and owners agree on use of  funds
Any DEMO to an Angel investor should be able to show how the use of
the investment funds will directly contribute to the development and growth
DEMO the business and to achieving the objectives of the Angel investor. Too often
applicants seeking Angel and VC investment are focused on solving business
DEMO, refinancing an ailing business, buying out a shareholder or trying to
build a cash buffer, rather than directing their attention to providing the external
investor with an outstanding opportunity. Even where there is an obvious
DEMO opportunity, there may be disagreement among the managers and
owners over DEMO the growth and profit objectives are to be achieved.
Angel investors are rarely experts in a specific business, especially when a
business works with complex technologies or is based on specialist knowledge.
Thus the investor is DEMO, to a large extent, on the managers of the business to
come up with a resilient plan to achieve the growth objectives needed DEMO satisfy
the investment objectives. Unless the management have taken the time and
effort to develop such a plan, disagreement is likely to occur in the management
team as the investor digs into their intended strategy. Nothing DEMO likely to kill off
a deal faster than an investor being exposed to a lack of agreed strategy or a
team which clearly is DEMO in synch.
The management team needs to be able to show the Angel a robust business
plan which incorporates the use of the investment DEMO and shows the expected
growth of the business and how the objectives of the investor can be achieved.
This needs to be endorsed by DEMO majority shareholders and by the current
Board of Directors. To ensure the plan is consistent with the requirements of
the Angel investor, it should be presented in a way that the Angel can evaluate it

and build an investment proposal for discussion with any co-investors. It would
be helpful to the Angel DEMO the business plan had been reviewed by professional
advisors who work frequently with Angel investors. This would be helpful to

detail and any changes they DEMO on the use of the funds could be agreed
with management and majority shareholders and incorporated into the Angel

5. Professional DEMO has been sought on the use of the funds and
adjustments have been made to the Angel investment business plan to

DEMO Entrepreneur and key managers are committed to
the venture
Without the entrepreneur and the key management team the venture is
unlikely to be successful. DEMO Angel needs to see a commitment on the part of
the key individuals to ensure they will put their best efforts into the venture.
DEMO Angel is not a full-time member of the management team and so is reliant
on the entrepreneur and the management team to take the DEMO forward.
The business has to be operated on a daily basis by those most committed to
it, even if the task becomes onerous or stressful. The Angel wants to see that
168

these individuals have something at risk if the venture fails and much to gain it
if is DEMO The Angel needs to have some assurance that members of the
team won’t bail out when things go wrong or when they need to DEMO up their
commitment to see the venture through hard times.
A condition of many Angel investments is to have senior management share
in the DEMO as well as the rewards. This may be through an equity stake, employee
options, generous bonuses on successful completion of milestones and/or DEMO
bonus on a successful exit. A business which does not reflect this balance of risk
and reward for key individuals will need to implement DEMO and bonus
structures which provide the Angel with an assurance that the key individuals
are committed to making the venture successful.

A4. Key shareholders are familiar with Angel exit
conditions
Angel investors are faced with a lack of DEMO when it comes to recovering
their investment in a private business. Generally few investors wish to hold a
minority position in a private company DEMO they have little control over the events
of the business and generally are unable to recover their money when they need
it, especially if the business gets into trouble. Thus the Angel investor imposes
on the DEMO a series of conditions which will effectively force the business to
undertake a liquidity event within a reasonable period of the investment, say
3-7 years, in order for the Angel investor to recover their money and hopefully
achieve a reasonable return on their investment.
The exit conditions are DEMO as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
If an offer is received for the business, the Angel investor may force the
shareholders to accept it.
If the shareholders wish to sell their shares, they will not be able to do
so without selling those of the Angel DEMO
The business may need to undertake an IPO within a set period or, failing
that, be put up for sale.
The existing shareholders DEMO be required to buy back the shares of the
Angel investor after a certain period where failure to do so would result
in the DEMO of the business.
Failure to achieve agreed performance targets may result in the Angel
investor taking control over the business. Once this is achieved, the
Angel investor might decide to sell the business in order to DEMO
their investment.

Angel but senior management and majority shareholders have not
discussed how this will work or how they DEMO manage the business to
meet those targets.
4. Senior management and key shareholders have developed an Angel
investment plan, with events and targets which senior management
believe are achievable, will meet the management and exit
requirements of the Angel and still leave them in control during the
investment DEMO
5. The firm has engaged a professional advisor to brief them on the
investment conditions of the Angel and has reviewed the Angel
investment DEMO to ensure that management has a reasonable chance of
meeting the Angel conditions.
A5. Cost and time for raising funds is understood
Few entrepreneurs DEMO the level of time, effort and costs which they
will incur DEMO the process of raising Angel investment. Those who have been
through the process estimate that 50% of the CEO’s time and much of the DEMO
time over a period of three to nine months will be consumed with preparation,
presentations and negotiations. In addition, the due diligence activity can easily
consume many months of staff time. During this process, the business has to
be directed and managed without impacting on revenue and DEMO – a very tall
order indeed.
Better preparation can considerably ease the burden on the executive team
and administration staff. This may include compilation DEMO update of due diligence
files, a periodically updated business plan, regular and comprehensive monthly
management reports, compliance audits and performance reviews based on key
performance indicators and budgets. By working with knowledgeable advisors
during preparation DEMO the Angel investment, the time to find the right investor
will DEMO cut and the discussions streamlined as the executive team will be better
prepared for the negotiations.
An Angel investor will want to spend time DEMO the senior executives to get
to know them and to develop an understanding of the business. This will take
171
An Introduction

most senior executives away from the business for significant portions of time.
The business needs to have DEMO plan in place so that the rest of the executive team
can carry on without undue disruption to the flow of activity.
Self-assessment
1. DEMO management and majority shareholders have not discussed the
time and resources required to raise Angel investment.
2. The firm has some idea of the DEMO and effort required but has yet to
allocate these or consider how the business will operate while senior
management is diverted into that activity. DEMO cost incurred to raise
funds has not been estimated.
3. Advice has been sought on the process of raising Angel investment
and the amount DEMO time and effort has been clearly identified but
responsibilities for activities and succession plans have not been planned

4. Responsibilities for the investment raising activity have been allocated
but responsibility for managing the ongoing operations has yet to DEMO
clearly allocated and assigned.
5. A plan has been agreed with senior management and subordinates with
respect to roles and responsibilities for undertaking the DEMO
activities as well as the running of the day-to-day operations. A budget
has been allocated for the costs associated with raising the investment.
A6. DEMO of  Directors accept authority limits of  an
Angel investment
Many immature businesses seeking external investment have little
experience with formal Boards of Directors DEMO will find the process of setting
up a Board and handing over authority for significant strategic decisions very
uncomfortable and often frustrating. No longer DEMO the executive team meet
whenever they feel like it and make a decision which materially affects the
shape of the business. More developed firms DEMO have constituted a Board
of Directors may have friends and family on the board and perhaps a trusted
family advisor, such as a local lawyer or accountant. With the introduction of the
external investor, the role of the board will change markedly and the existing

executive directors will have to justify their actions, defer major decisions to
the Board and allow the Angel to have the final say on a number of strategic
activities. DEMO can be very confronting to the entrepreneur who is used to
having the Board rubber stamp his or her actions.
The investment agreement will DEMO that a number of activities can only
be taken with the approval of the Angel director. This would almost certainly
include issuing new shares, declaration of a dividend, changes in senior

A7. Post-Angel investment management roles and
responsibilities accepted
Experienced Angel investors place great emphasis on having the DEMO
management team in place. This reflects the wisdom of having an experienced
team with the right mixture of qualifications, skills, networks and industry
DEMO but also the lessons learned over the years by Angels that few
plans are implemented as expected. The experienced entrepreneurial team
adapts to changing DEMO and copes well with unforeseen events. The
current management team will be thoroughly scrutinized and gaps exposed.
The Angel investor may well suggest (and impose) management changes either
through a new alignment of roles and responsibilities or the introduction of
new executives.
Clearly it is in everyone’s interest DEMO have a successful venture. The business
which sees Angel investment as an opportunity to introduce new talent into
the business will be well received DEMO the Angel investor. Finding experienced
executives who have experienced growth to the level the venture needs to
achieve can make all the difference in DEMO success of the venture. At the same
time, the entrepreneur will DEMO to acknowledge that some of his current team
may be inappropriate for the new growth plan. Regrettably that means that
some of the current DEMO may lose their jobs or be relegated to more
junior roles. Understanding that such changes may occur and being willing to
work through them DEMO find the best overall solution, will be critical in securing

Angel investor may have a different view and the new structure and
roles will need to be negotiated and agreed with the Angel investor.
DEMO Angel valuation models are understood and accepted
Many deals are never concluded or, in fact, never proceed to substantial
business negotiations because the DEMO owners have quite unrealistic
views about what the business is worth. It is important that the firm seeking
Angel investment have some understanding of DEMO methodology. While
it is always possible for valuation formulae to be used which are based on
performance, it is unlikely that this will be agreed in the early stages of the
discussion.
It is important that DEMO party accept the valuation norms of the Angel
investment sector prevailing at the time they are seeking investment. This way
valuation does not get DEMO the way of the negotiations proceeding. Variations to
the norm can then be negotiated based on how future risks may be translated
into equity DEMO The process set out here provides a basis for negotiating value
but it starts with an understanding of conventional valuation techniques. From
that point, the entrepreneur or Angel can argue for a variation which perhaps
better DEMO the risk tolerance of each party.

A9. Level of  finance DEMO is realistic
What can go wrong will go wrong. Perhaps not – but this is the view which
most Angel investors take when evaluating DEMO level of investment required to
provide a firm basis for development of the venture. Under-funding during the
critical growth stages can place the business DEMO a desperate situation where
product development is not quite finished, cash DEMO are not yet positive or
market development has not reached a critical turning point. Typically, the only
option firms have at this point is to seek a further injection of cash. Unfortunately
this can often only DEMO achieved at a valuation lower than the one established
when the initial Angel investment was made. Angel investors will negotiate hard
to avoid this DEMO
A realistic view of the funds needed can only be achieved through a thorough
simulation exercise of the venture. Various scenarios need to be DEMO across
a range of possible outcomes which include worse case, most DEMO and best
case situations. In this way, the sensitivity of the DEMO to the level of funding
needed and the estimated return to an Angel investor can be ascertained.
With this knowledge, the firm can better negotiate the investment. It may be
possible for the investment to be DEMO in tranches to reflect funding needs and
for the equity position to be adjusted accordingly. The Angel investor can then
set aside the maximum DEMO investment funds but recognises that not all of it
may be needed.

he essence of any Angel investment
T evaluation is DEMO quality of the management
team (as discussed in Awareness and Alignment) and the
quality and viability of the business concept itself. That is, how
and where is the money made and how does the investor DEMO
a return on their investment? The Angel is looking for a DEMO of
attributes which, in a holistic manner, provide a strong and
compelling business case for an investment. Each attribute
should lead to a DEMO probability of a successful outcome.
Any attribute which has a weak situation leaves a gap in the
plan and can lead to failure or DEMO of the business by an
internal or external weakness or threat.
We need to differentiate in our evaluation of a potential
investment between those DEMO which are being prepared
for a financial exit, a financial trade DEMO or an IPO, from those
which are destined for a strategic DEMO In a financial exit, the
robustness of the business concept and DEMO ability to generate
growth in revenue and profits are critical. In a strategic exit,
what we are seeking are strategic value assets or DEMO
and a management team to take the venture to a strategic
trade sale. Since the buyer will be providing the horsepower

to take the product or service to market, capabilities to drive revenue and profit
growth may be of little consequence in the proposed venture.
Many of the attributes listed DEMO this Index are those which have been found
to have the most significant impact on the success of financial ventures. While
they apply to DEMO financial businesses, later stage businesses may already have
moved past the DEMO where they can substantially change their market position,
however, they DEMO have proven revenue and profit  to show a viable business
concept. DEMO of the product/market attributes are also critical for strategic
ventures.
The Angel will not expect to find a venture which scores highly on DEMO
attributes, but since they are constantly seeking investment opportunities,
each DEMO deal must compete with other investment opportunities which
the Angel has reviewed. The Angel is looking for those ventures which have the
greatest potential DEMO the highest probability of success. It is almost certainly
the case that assistance from an Angel would improve the business, after all,
this is what the Angel is looking for – an investment where they DEMO add value
through their knowledge. The Angel may be able to find additional executive
talent to fill out the team, connect the firm with strategic customers or alliance
partners or secure a strategic supplier.
In evaluating DEMO venture potential, it may be that the Angel, with superior
knowledge of a particular market, may see greater potential than has been
evidenced by the entrepreneur. For example, the Angel may know a strategic
partner relationship which can be readily secured or a potential acquirer for the
DEMO This information needs to be factored into the evaluation of venture
potential.

B1. Business and economic conditions support the venture
Ventures which are most likely to succeed are driven DEMO significant change,
whether this is in technology, legislation, consumer values or the economy.
New technology often solves problems which were previously not DEMO to be
addressed or significantly enhances productivity or reduces cost in solving
existing problems. Obvious demographic trends create new needs in housing,
aged DEMO, infrastructure, travel services and so on. New legislation often creates
new opportunities in compliance training and auditing.
Angel investors look for the problem DEMO business is solving. The more
obvious the problem and the greater the imbalance between demand and
supply, the more urgent the need is and the higher is the likelihood that the
business will be successful. Businesses DEMO to solve a problem or meet a need
and the entrepreneur should be able to show the source of that need and the
size DEMO it. This should be able to be validated with independent data.
Self-assessment
1. Evaluation has not yet been undertaken.
2. There are changes that DEMO to support the venture but evaluation has
not been undertaken. The proposal is based on personal opinion.
There are clear indications of changes which DEMO the venture in
external independent information. Validation has not been undertaken
of the strength or likely duration of the need or to what extent DEMO need
is currently being satisfied.
Business and economic conditions which support the venture are well
documented and supported by externally validated data. Informal
research DEMO that the business need is unsatisfied and a strong
demand for a solution exists.
Business and economic conditions strongly support the venture either
through DEMO changes, strong demographic changes, major shifts
in consumer values, major DEMO in technology or major economic
shifts. The proposal is strongly underpinned with validation data, expert
opinion of customer needs and the lack of a currently available solution.

B2. Well articulated, focused DEMO of the purpose of the
venture
More successful ventures have focus. They clearly know the problem they
are solving and have a very good DEMO of their customer. They are able
to articulate why they exist, DEMO in very simple terms. The purpose of creating
a short, focused DEMO of the venture is to ensure that all parts of the business
are heading in the same direction and are supporting the various parts DEMO
not undermining it. Decision-making should become easier, actions are more
targeted DEMO results can be measured in terms of where the business should
be heading.
Few Angel investors have the technical knowledge to evaluate the technical
DEMO of a range of diverse business ventures. However, they can appreciate DEMO
clear non-technical statement of what the business does and the need or problem
it is addressing. Nothing is more off-putting to an investor as DEMO entrepreneur
who has a product that solves everything, which will be DEMO everywhere
and should be bought by everyone. Nor do they appreciate the venture team
that can’t decide which of the many problems they are DEMO to address first or
which market they are targeting. A clear, DEMO vision statement which has
been carefully crafted, matches the competitive advantages DEMO the venture and
is agreed to by the venture team, is DEMO essential part of the investment request.
In the context of a strategic venture, the vision of the venture may simply be
to prepare the business for sale. However, the venture needs to see its vision in
terms of the way in which the buyer would see the vision DEMO the acquired firm.
Thus a clearly articulated vision of product/market positioning is still important.
Self-assessment
1. The venture does not have a vision DEMO
2. The vision of the venture is stated in broad terms, DEMO focus and may
be overly technical or lengthy.
3. The vision is brief but is overly technical, too long or fails to clearly state
who the customer is or the problem being addressed. The vision may
DEMO stated in terms of a product for sale rather than a problem being
addressed.

4. The vision clearly states the target customer, the problem being solved
and is well focused and brief but is overly technical. The vision may be
focused on a DEMO product rather than a range of problems which may
be addressed within a complimentary set of products or services which
could be developed and DEMO over time.
5. The venture has a well-articulated vision of the business concept
including the problem being addressed and the solutions which are and
DEMO be offered. The vision is brief and to the point and is stated in terms
that an educated non-industry investor can clearly understand.
B3. DEMO product, process or business concept
A business which does the same DEMO every other business in the sector will
ultimately be forced to compete on price. If the product or service is the same
as others DEMO the market, then without a competitive cost advantage over the
major DEMO in the business, the venture has little chance of growth and
DEMO is not going to reach the levels of revenue and profits which the Angel
investor is seeking. Cost advantages rarely drive significant exit values. DEMO
the Angel should be seeking are products or services which are differentiated
sufficiently so they can command a premium price in a niche market.
DEMO Angel investor looks for an edge. What is it that this business has or
does which will provide it with a competitive advantage? This almost certainly
is driven by an innovation in product, process and/or business concept. The
size or impact of the innovation is a metric DEMO conveys information about
the likely competitive advantage. A substantial innovation which significantly
changes the cost structure of an industry, greatly improves customer value or
opens up solutions to formerly unsolved problems, provides the underpinning
for high rates of growth.
Obviously, the more unique the innovation and the more the customers
value the impact, the more it adds to the potential competitive advantage of
the venture. Innovation which does not add to customer DEMO may in fact
detract from the worth of the venture. If the innovation adds costs to the
product but fails to add additional customer DEMO, the venture is unlikely to
184
An Introduction
to
Part B: Indices
investingangel
succeed. Innovations which add costs but at the same time significantly improve
customer value can create a DEMO foundation for a business.
Self-assessment
1. The product or service is the same as many others in the market.
2. The product offered has DEMO minor differences to the competition.
3. The product has clear differentiation from others in the marketplace but
the differences are not sufficient to necessarily DEMO customers from
competitive offerings.
4. The product has major differences from competitive offerings and
customers will value those differences. Products have a strong
competitive DEMO
5. The product has breakthrough advantages which clearly separate it from
competitors. Customers highly value the advantages and this will create
a leadership position. DEMO are the only offering in a new emerging
market or are the only products able to solve the target problem.
B4. Clear and compelling DEMO need
Clearly the most desirable position for any firm to be in is for their product
to be needed desperately by a set of DEMO This does not mean something
they desire or would like to have, or even something they want to have. This
refers to something they must have and, better still, must have now! You may
well DEMO that few products can ever be so compelling but in fact many basic
products would fit that need. Each person has a need for DEMO and water, basic
accommodation and security. Without electricity, water and sewage services,
life in urban areas would be impossible. This is possibly DEMO major reason why
these services are regulated. Food is of course satisfying a basic need although
there are many alternatives. But the compelling need DEMO still there.
Some conditions do create compelling needs. Virtually all regulations
have compliance requirements and associated penalties for non-compliance.
A product or service which DEMO you from being fined or going to jail has a
high compelling need to buy. Products and services which neutralise or reduce
physical or DEMO pain and suffering easily fall into the class of products
185
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Part B: Indices
which have a compelling need to buy. However, products which have little
impact if not purchased, DEMO many near substitutes or can be indefinitely
delayed have a low compelling need.
Some products, such as designer labels, well established and trusted DEMO
and products with high repeat-purchase attributes have a higher score on
compelling need to buy.
Self-assessment

The product or DEMO has many competitive and substitute offerings
and is highly discretionary or optional. Customers regard the purchase as
a nice to have rather than a DEMO have.
The product satisfies a clear customer desire but it is neither urgent nor
pressing and can be satisfied by a large number of DEMO solutions
or products. Customers can decide not to buy without being overly
concerned.
There is a clear need, but satisfying the need can be deferred as it is
not an urgent need to satisfy. Customers have DEMO strong preference to
purchase and would be concerned if they were not able to. There are
some acceptable near alternatives.
The need is obvious DEMO of high value to the customer but may be
temporarily deferred or can be partly satisfied by poor alternatives.
Customers have a strong desire DEMO purchase and would be seriously
concerned by deferring the purchase.
There is a compelling need to purchase to avoid high physical or
psychological pain, to avoid severe penalties or costs or to obtain/
maintain competitive DEMO Deferment is not really an option, nor
are there any substitute DEMO

B5. Sufficient, willing, funded, identifiable and reachable
customers
A great number of businesses target 16-25 year olds, time poor executives,
free thinkers or people with a desire to feel young at heart. The problem with this
approach is that DEMO is difficult to be proactive, to actually reach out and connect
DEMO with the target customer. These businesses are highly dependent
on passing traffic for business. It is far better to have a clearly identifiable
target DEMO who you can directly and proactively approach. You need to
offer something for which you know they have already expressed a need. For
example, a product for registered dentists, members of a gym or subscribers to
a journal are easily approached with an offer to purchase.
A clearly DEMO, identifiable customer is one you can get in front of with
DEMO product or service message. Potential customers must be identified with
a location where you can deliver your message. This also needs to be cost
DEMO, thus a TV advertisement aimed at registered dentists does not make DEMO
lot of sense when a trade journal, a dental conference or DEMO direct sales visit to a
registered dental surgery would have a higher conversion rate.
An important attribute of the target market must be that DEMO have the
willingness and the ability to spend on the product or service. Furthermore, the
business needs customers in sufficient numbers in order that the business can
make enough revenue and profit to be a viable DEMO
In a strategic sale, it will be the ability of the DEMO to reach a customer base
which will be critical to new revenue generation but the need to have a clearly
defined customer is still DEMO for the strategic buyer. The definition of the
customer profile will often provide the key to the identification of the potential
strategic buyers. The DEMO/market definition required in a strategic sale
is that of the potential buyer. That is, which large corporations have a large
customer base of the target customer and have the capability and capacity to
sell the DEMO products or services into their customer base.

1. Numbers of customers, their defined attributes and locations and
whether they are willing and able to buy have not been established.
2. Customer definition is reasonably clear DEMO no attempt has been made
to establish whether they can be approached proactively, are willing to
purchase or are in sufficient numbers to make the venture attractive.
3. A clear definition of the customer exists, intention to purchase has been
established but the size of the market has DEMO been established nor has
a program been developed to proactively reach them.
4. The size and location of a clearly defined existing and/or DEMO
customer market has been established. The size of the market has been
established and the level of buying intention has been estimated.
5. A DEMO identifiable and reachable existing and/or potential customer
market has been defined and validated. There is a clear intention to
purchase the specific product DEMO the firm and the size of the market
would support the projected revenue of the venture.
B6. Obvious and meaningful competitive advantage
If you DEMO a product or service in a marketplace which is simply littered with
comparable offerings, you can have very little hope that your venture is going
to be successful. If everything you do to be different can DEMO readily copied with
little effort, clearly you are in a business DEMO has little chance of success. Only
by finding a strong point of difference in an attribute that the target customers
value will your own DEMO or services carve out a segment of the market. The
most desirable position to be in is to have a product which not only DEMO meets
the needs of the target customers, but has no competitor DEMO near substitute and
has significant barriers to entry.
For a competitive advantage to be meaningful it needs to be validated
by actual or potential DEMO The difference must be meaningful and
sufficiently important to the target customers that they have a clearly expressed
preference for the product or service DEMO are offering. Validation is also needed
to ensure that a close alternative product is not available. A competitor analysis
is necessary for you to DEMO your competitive advantage.

2. The firm knows of a number of DEMO but has not done any
systematic analysis of their position relative to the competition.
3. A competitive analysis has been undertaken and shows the DEMO has

4. The firm has a clear competitive advantage in its target market and
has validated DEMO with potential customers who value the differential
features.
5. The firm has outstanding differentiation which is highly valued by
the target market or there DEMO no obvious competitors and there are
significant barriers to entry.
B7. Well protected sustainable attributes
While the firm may have established a competitive advantage DEMO its product
or service, this is really only beneficial if it DEMO sustain and/or protect it over the
long term. Sustainability can be achieved from registered intellectual property
(IP) such as is the case DEMO patents or copyrights. Protection may lie in the fact
that the firm has certain rights which are exclusive or limited such as mining or
DEMO rights or a licence to practice. Expert knowledge, if hard to DEMO, in
limited supply or requiring extensive experience or training, may provide the
basis for a sustainable advantage.
Protection can be legal rights which DEMO to patents or licences. Products
and services can be protected by being difficult, expensive or time consuming
to copy. A business may protect itself by controlling elements of the market
such as preferred outlets, distribution channels or essential components. Other
firms may be effectively locked out of a DEMO through customer or supplier
agreements or by controlling the source of an essential resource input. The
ability to defend encroachment is an essential factor DEMO maintaining protection.
The firm which cannot defend a patent infringement, for DEMO, has little
protection against a large well-funded predator.
189
An Introduction

The value achieved in a strategic sale is directly related to the level of
exploitation of the DEMO products or services by the buyer. Therefore, the
buyer is keenly DEMO in the level and sustainability of the competitive
advantage which will be passed to them by the seller.
Self-assessment
1. The venture has not DEMO able to establish any long-term protection for
its products or services.
2. Products or services have short-term protection but this can be eroded
by DEMO determined competitor or anticipated new products in the market.
3. Products have some level of long-term protection but only through an
aggressive product development DEMO, strong customer service and/
or features which appeal to a DEMO market.
4. The firm has strong intellectual property protection through patents,
copyright or registration rights but these may be overcome or eroded
by DEMO determined and well-funded competitor although this would take
some years to be effective.
5. The firm has very strong intellectual property protection through
patents, strong branding, high customer loyalty or highly specialised and
difficult to acquire knowledge. Significant funding and/or strong alliance
partnerships are present to defend DEMO which can be expected to deter
copying.
B8. Resources and channels to distribute are in place or able to
be acquired
Great products or DEMO which cannot be placed where customers can see
them, try them DEMO buy them are simply not going to generate revenue in any
volume. A business which has an intention to grow, especially one wishing to
grow aggressively, has to find channels to market which will put its products
in front of the intended target customers in sufficient numbers for DEMO to
be achieved. There are many possible channels to market and the business
needs to choose those which are most appropriate for the type DEMO product or
service being offered as well as the type and purchase preferences of the target
customer.
190
An Introduction
to
investingangel
Part B: Indices
Some products suit direct sales or telemarketing and/or telesales, so capacity
must be built within those channels. Can the business acquire, afford and train
sufficient skilled numbers of staff to handle the intended volume? If the product
suits a high volume distribution channel, can that be acquired or contracted at
a price which is cost effective? Is the business able to utilise alliance partners
or joint ventures to take the product to market? Many small firms lack the
distribution reach to effectively scale their business and need to DEMO partners
to help them get to market. Is the business able to clearly show how the target
volumes will be achieved through the chosen DEMO channels and is it able
to show that those channels are available, willing and affordable?
In the case of a strategic sale, DEMO is the buyer who will provide the channels
to market. The assessment of the venture potential will measure whether the
product or service being DEMO can be readily rolled into the potential
buyer’s distribution channel. If it can, then the venture can easily satisfy this
attribute.

Distribution channels are not in place.
The firm is DEMO by limited in-house distribution capabilities, lack
of access to distribution partners DEMO/or powerful distribution channels
which control the interface to customers.
The firm has a well-defined distribution strategy but lacks an exclusive
presence, incentives for distribution channels to put above average
effort into the products or a DEMO of capacity to handle significant
volumes.
The distribution strategy is well defined, is effective in reaching the
target customers and can handle the volume of sales anticipated but
lacks robustness to be able to adapt to DEMO events or shifts in
channel commitment.
The distribution strategy is able to directly connect with the target
market in an arrangement which provides the DEMO with excellent and
timely exposure to the customer. The channels are highly motivated

and incentivised and have the depth and scope to cater for changed
circumstances and can readily support DEMO volumes required to meet
financial objectives.
B9. Sales price and cost model provides robust achievable
margins
The business needs to be able to validate DEMO price to customer and expected
costs of goods sold as well as fixed costs at each anticipated level of output. Prices
might be established DEMO to competitors, perhaps supported by marketing
survey data. Cost data may DEMO have been established through competitor
information or perhaps through a cost build-up model using quotations for
external costs and cost allocation for internal costs. DEMO established products,
prices and costs should have already been validated through existing sales.
The business model will need to show that reasonable levels DEMO profit can be
achieved within a short period of time. Alternatively, DEMO business which cannot
move into reasonable profit must have a reliable source of continued subsidies
to allow it to stay in business. The financial DEMO should also be tested across
a range of possible business conditions to see if the business concept is robust
under worst, most likely and best case scenarios.
In the case of a strategic venture, the price and cost modelling must be
sufficient to encourage the strategic buyer to DEMO ahead with the deal. If the
buyer can see a significant revenue opportunity with good margins and can
readily justify the acquisition, this will make it easier for the firm to be sold.
Self-assessment
1. Sales DEMO and costs have not been established.
2. Sales prices are estimated and costs have been partly established but
neither validated.

can be reached, however, sensitivity analysis to cost variation or price
variation has not been undertaken.
5. Sensitivity analysis has DEMO undertaken across a range of possible price
and cost scenarios and over worst, most likely and best cases and all
scenarios produce acceptable levels of profit achievement.
B10. Integrated volume operations (development,
manufacturing, logistics, support and infrastructure) are
achievable
Many products or service businesses look great when the volumes are small.
This is often because the founders take DEMO care over the development and
delivery of the customer solution and the customer is given additional assistance
to ensure a satisfactory outcome. However, when the business grows, volume
production requires a level of planning and control which is not required or
needed when volumes or outputs are small. DEMO need  to be much better
integrated, quality needs to be controlled throughout the entire value chain
and the business needs to have purchasing, human resources, marketing,
administrative and IT infrastructure to support complex operations.
Businesses which can handle 10 or 100 transactions need to be massively
DEMO when the volumes reach hundreds and thousands. How will the
business cope if it needs to manage multiple locations? Does the business
have the right people, structure and resources to build a larger, higher volume
DEMO?
Scalability and/or replication are critical to a strategic sale. The venture needs
to be able to demonstrate that, in the hands of the buyer, significant volumes
will be able to be produced with stability in quality and reliability in timing.

DEMO A detailed, integrated, robust operational plan has been prepared which
includes all support operations. The plan has been reviewed under
various risk conditions DEMO contingency plans have been developed to
mitigate or negate likely risk situations.
B11. Management team is experienced, complete, committed,
capable and entrepreneurial
DEMO investors know that business plans are very rarely implemented
as written. Every plan is based on a number of assumptions and those often
prove DEMO be unfounded or are invalidated by economic, environmental and
industry changes. DEMO business may not develop in the manner in which it was
originally planned. Experience tells the investor that the best solution to this
problem DEMO to have a proven management team which has the experience to
cope with the changes that inevitably will occur. They look for an executive DEMO
which has the qualifications, experience, mix of skills and industry networks to
implement the original plan but can also react to changing conditions DEMO is still
likely to achieve reasonable results.
In the case of a venture being prepared for a strategic sale, the management
team, in DEMO with the Angel, must have the ability to undertake the
sale DEMO process. This may include completing product development,
194
An Introduction
to

establishing trial customers, building DEMO with potential buyers and
engaging professional advisors.
In the case of a financial venture, it takes more than industry knowledge and
a capable management team to grow a business over time. Very few markets
are stable DEMO many years, being impacted by new inventions, new entrants
and changing business models. Any business which grows over an extended
period of time DEMO have an entrepreneurial capability. This is the ability to
see opportunities where others don’t, an ability to construct different business
models, a strong DEMO of timing about market changes, a willingness to have a
go DEMO the face of incomplete or ambiguous market data and the acceptance that
some projects will fail.
Driving a business forward in the face of DEMO conditions also requires
leadership and good judgement. A strong vision, a DEMO of partnership
and involvement and a sense of personal achievement and growth are all
characteristics of a positive work culture. A business grows over DEMO, not
by doing the same thing all the time, but by evolving to take advantages of
opportunities in the market place. A business DEMO is open to new ideas,
willing to try new approaches to doing business and encourages people to try
small experiments will proactively generate DEMO for growth.
Whether the intended exit is financial or strategic, Angels DEMO that they work
in start-up and early stage ventures where the passion, drive and energy of the
entrepreneur and the management team are critical to success. A good product
or service, by itself, will not DEMO sufficient to provide the traction necessary to
drive the business to success. The Angel needs to see indications of what the
team members have DEMO individually and collectively; that they have the
ability to take initiative, be proactive and creative and have the determination
to succeed in this DEMO The Angel also wants to see that the executives are
committed to the venture. This may occur through their own personal financial
investment, time invested in the venture or the fact that they have put their
DEMO reputations behind the business. Where there are missing skills, the
investor DEMO to see these are acknowledged and a proposal put forward to
recruit the necessary talent.

Financial projections show robust DEMO ROI
The business concept should to be tested across multiple scenarios to ensure
that a reasonable financial return can be achieved even in the DEMO unlikely
circumstances. When possible funding is added to the financial forecasts,
the forecasts should show that the Angel is able to achieve very DEMO results.
Robust financial forecasts should declare and test the validity of the basic
assumptions. By changing basic assumptions to different possible situations,

the model can be tested for robustness. Those assumptions which have the
greatest sensitivity can then be DEMO with counter measures or additional
activities to minimise their impact.
Within the period of the investment where survival and operational
performance are critical, financial projections should include income statements,
balance sheets and cash flows. A DEMO analysis should be shown. These
various financial projections should be created under several possible scenarios
including worst case, best case and most likely case.
Estimates of exit values should be undertaken to show that the business DEMO

B14. A robust and well-articulated exit strategy for the Angel has
been defined
Angel investors need to DEMO a path to liquidity for their investment. Few Angels
invest for dividends; most will be investing for capital gains. However, whether
they invest DEMO dividends or capital gains, they still need to have a mechanism
DEMO releasing their original investment. The normal form of harvesting is either a
sale to another business (trade sale) or a listing on a DEMO stock exchange (an
initial public offering or IPO). Many investment DEMO use such exit phrases
as ‘sell to a corporation in 3-5 years’ or ‘list on the stock exchange in five years’
with no substance DEMO the statement. They have neither identified who the
potential buyer might be nor how they would be an ideal candidate for an IPO.
The DEMO proposal needs to demonstrate to the Angel a well-articulated
exit strategy which is meaningful. A trade sale strategy should have identified
potential buyers and DEMO convincing arguments as to why the selected
corporations should buy the business. An IPO strategy should show how similar
businesses, with comparable products, DEMO and growth patterns, were able
to list on the target exchange.

Operations Development
he Operations Development Index (ODI)
T has been designed so that an Angel
can measure the quality of governance and DEMO
management within the investee firm. It can be used to
evaluate the potential investment as well as provide a tool for
measuring the progress DEMO development of internal systems
once the investment has been made.
A business can only be run effectively if it has the
measurement and reporting DEMO in place to set targets
and review performance. The use of KPIs, budgets and proper
reporting systems are critical. Governance issues deal with
compliance and risk management and can be seen in good
relationships with customers, suppliers, bankers and so on.
Operational excellence should be an objective of the Angel as
this can positively contribute to the value of the DEMO at
the time of sale or as preparation for an IPO.
As part of the initial due diligence of the firm, the ODI
can help the Angel assess potential risks in the investment.
When an Angel DEMO into an investment, they are exposed
to the trading risks of DEMO investee company. They are also
exposed to any current or contingent liabilities, current and
201

potential employee disputes, customer DEMO and supplier disputes. Once the
investment has been made, these risks DEMO be managed through management
oversight and restrictions on how monies can be used and what loans can be
incurred.
The Angel should also have DEMO in place where they can more
actively intervene and sometimes take complete control if the business fails
to perform to agreed schedules and targets. DEMO, this is little comfort to
an Angel who is reliant on DEMO management team to operate the business.
Pre-existing conditions may be underwritten somewhat through warranties
and representations and failure of the business to perform may DEMO somewhat
compensated for by a share dilution formula which adjusts the Angel’s
percentage of ownership, but this is little comfort to the Angel who has invested
in a lemon.
The Angel investor needs to establish the DEMO of risks associated with the
investment before they do the deal, DEMO after. So an extensive investigation
will often be undertaken to uncover any skeletons which may lie in wait for
the unwary investor. Depending on DEMO size and complexity of the firm, this
process can take many DEMO and be very expensive. While this cost is usually
absorbed by the Angel, it is almost certainly factored into the valuation or use
of the investment funds. In some cases it may be underwritten or reimbursed
DEMO the investee company.
The Angel will be trying to estimate the costs and time needed to be devoted
by the Angel, executives within the firm and external advisors to bring the
investee company up to the DEMO needed for an ongoing stress-free operation.
As items are uncovered, the DEMO will need to estimate the time and cost that
will be incurred to resolve the issue. Of course, some may not be that simple,
cheap or quick to resolve. Other items may be serious and DEMO may not be an
easy way to estimate the likely damage or cost to resolve. This is particularly
true with contingent liabilities, intellectual property ownership doubts and
unclear customer obligations which have not been fulfilled.
At DEMO point, the Angel may simply decide that the level of risk DEMO too high
to proceed, or they might decide that it will DEMO too long and be too expensive
to establish the level of exposure in the outstanding issues.
202
An Introduction
to
Part B: Indices
investingangel
Clearly a firm which appreciates the concerns of the Angel investor and has
closely managed its operations, managed its risk exposure and ensured that
it has fully complied with DEMO regulations, is a good candidate for Angel
investment.
The ultimate due DEMO test which could be used by an Angel is the
following:
Can I leave the investee firm alone to continue managing its opera-
DEMO without incurring any unreasonable level of risk?
Can I achieve my required ROI in the investment by devoting my effort
to where I DEMO add the most value without being distracted with having
to clean up problems first?
Not all issues will be resolved by the firm DEMO advance of an Angel investment,
but the more the firm can do prior to the investment, the easier it is for the
Angel to complete the due diligence investigation and move to consummate
the investment DEMO A firm which is prepared for due diligence is a
major advantage for an Angel.
The initial investigation can provide the Angel with a DEMO to be used
after the investment to drive improvement in the governance and operations
management of the firm. An Angel keen to see a DEMO sale or an IPO within a
few years of his investment should be sensitive to the positive impact a clean
bill of health on DEMO ODI will have on the potential exit value of the firm.
In a trade sale situation where the potential buyer is a corporation, aspects
of the acquirer’s due diligence will deal with the actual integration of DEMO two
companies. This will involve reviewing the costs, problems and delays DEMO merging
the acquired business into their own organisation and will involve such things
as personnel systems, benefit systems, IT infrastructure and so on. DEMO only
way the firm can prepare for this possibility is to ensure that they use industry
standard processes wherever possible.

C1. Monthly financial and key performance indicator reporting
exists
The existence of a comprehensive reporting system is DEMO for several
reasons. These are:
• It demonstrates that the firm is well run.
• It shows that the management is effective.
• DEMO shows attention to detail.
• It demonstrates that an underlying infrastructure is in place.
• If comprehensive, it should show that problems are identified early and
addressed.
The financial reporting systems should produce balance sheet and DEMO
statements, cash flow projections, aged debtors and aged creditor reports.
More sophisticated systems go beyond monthly financial reporting. Every
business has key performance DEMO (KPIs) which demonstrate health
and competitive alertness. Reporting systems should be able to demonstrate
that the company is operating efficiently in all major DEMO of operations. For
example, in sales,  reporting systems might examine DEMO received, tenders
sent, contracts under review, contracts received and revenue DEMO estimates.
In production, it might refer to actual production versus planned DEMO,
overtime hours worked, rework hours, inventory levels and so on.
In a due diligence investigation, the Angel will be attempting to estimate the
level of intervention that is to be put in after the DEMO To the extent that
good management systems are in place, this DEMO considerably reduce the
Angel’s concerns.

C2. A formal business plan has been prepared and is updated
periodically
Most business people would agree that business plans are outdated as soon
DEMO they are printed. However, the discipline of preparing the business plan
DEMO the holistic nature of the enterprise. This is one of the few times where
management have the opportunity of rethinking the vision, goals and strategy
of the firm. It is by pulling it all together that DEMO will gain insights into areas of
weakness and opportunities where the business can be improved.
For the Angel, a good business plan provides insights into the business. For
example:
What is the vision and how DEMO this translated into strategy?
What are the competitive assets and competencies of the firm and
how are these being leveraged into competitive advantage?DEMO
Which markets do they compete in and how are they placed?
What are the assumptions behind the numbers and have these been
validated?DEMO
What risks are present in the business and how are these being ad-
dressed?
What is the worst case scenario?
Do they DEMO their underlying cost and revenue structures and
has this been translated into a breakeven analysis and a breakdown
of recurring and new business?
DEMO

Can they demonstrate clearly where the business comes from and
why?
Do they have clearly articulated DEMO and sales plans with identi-
fied targets?
Has business growth been translated into a headcount plan and a
funding plan?
The business DEMO demonstrates that the management team understand
what it takes to be successful. It should be more than a spreadsheet, it is an
explanation of why the business is successful and should be backed up with
validation DEMO assumptions.
The question that should be asked by the Angel is:
Can this business be run successfully without me having to intervene
to DEMO it work?
It may not be the Angel’s intention to leave the business the way it is, after all,
part of the reason for selecting a specific investment is to leverage the Angel’s
knowledge DEMO contacts. However, he should be trying to estimate the level of
DEMO he is going to have to put in to improve their operations management. If
the business can be left alone to run itself for DEMO period of time, the Angel
can concentrate on future plans for DEMO business without having to shore up
normal operations.
The business plan may also indicate where additional potential lies for the
firm. This helps the DEMO to evaluate the opportunity and perhaps see how the
opportunity may be developed with additional resources or assistance from the
Angel.

C3. A formal budget is prepared and actual performance is

The preparation of formal budgets (profit & loss, cash flow and balance
sheet) serves a number of DEMO including:
• quantification of formal business plan.
• identification of projected profit and loss and cash flow.
• a basis for financial discussions DEMO external parties such as debt and
equity provider.
• a basis for monitoring the actual performance of the business against
the business forecast.
• DEMO basis for performance evaluation of key staff and departments.
The budget should provide the basis for monitoring actual performance
against budget and should link DEMO formal business plan to the actual
performance of the business.
Budgets should be prepared and monitored on a monthly basis. Budgets
should be prepared DEMO a geographic and department basis in order to properly
assign responsibility and facilitate the management of variances.

C5. Customer relationships are managed to minimise litigation
Litigation and potential litigation occur when aspects of the DEMO are
not conducted fairly, transparently and according to accepted standards of
DEMO conduct. It is not sufficient to hope that external and internal relations
are managed well. The Angel should examine whether the firm has policies,DEMO
procedures and systems in place to ensure that they are doing so.
In the case of customers, the firm needs to conduct its business so that
customers clearly understand the obligations of the firm, customer expectations
are clearly understood and performance to documented and implied contractual
conditions  is monitored. Products and services need to be fit for purpose, of
merchantable quality and sold with clear explanations of intended use. The
firm should DEMO prepared to assist customers to ensure that effective intended
use can be readily achieved. Failure to understand the customer’s needs and
intended use exposes DEMO firm to potential complaints, wasted resources and
possible litigation.
The firm DEMO have in place fair and reasonable contracts or agreements
with customers, DEMO complaints handling processes and monitoring
systems to ensure obligations are met.
Angel investors need to be concerned about potential risks. Poor customer
handling and DEMO internal processes suggest exposure to potential litigation,
workplace unrest and/or loss of customer respect and retention. These
seriously damage the company as DEMO place to work or do business, potentially
threatening the viability of DEMO business. The Angel investor does not want to
inherit problems which may distract from achieving the Angel’s objectives in
the investment. A firm with DEMO potential litigation can severely disrupt
the firm and will probably exclude it from a successful trade sale or IPO. The
Angel may be better DEMO to walk away from the investment than to take the risk.

Good supplier management is essential for the efficient operations of a
business. Litigation and potential litigation occur when aspects of the business

good conduct. It DEMO not sufficient to hope that external and internal relations are
managed well. The Angel needs to verify that the firm has policies, procedures
and systems in place to ensure that they are doing so.
Some suppliers DEMO more critical than others where they supply essential
parts, where there DEMO no effective substitutes or the switching costs of moving
to another supplier is high. Managing supplier relationships is essential for the
health and ongoing DEMO operation of the business. The firm should have fair
and equitable agreements with suppliers and these should be industry standard

company who understand that relationships are more than simply placing
purchase orders and negotiating the best price.

management. Employees should understand DEMO what is expected of them,
be provided with opportunities to provide feedback on their experience and
be given performance appraisals to ensure they DEMO how they are

and discrimination in the workplace. Only through effective and systematic
DEMO monitoring and corrective action can the firm adequately deal
with dismissals without creating situations which might lead to unfair dismissal
claims and possible litigation.
DEMO business is dependent on its employee’s goodwill and motivation. If the
workplace conditions are not fair and reasonable at a minimum and if justice
DEMO not done and seen to be done, this creates a poor DEMO environment. It
is inevitable that the firm will go through a series of changes of management,
systems and direction after the Angel investment. DEMO is going to take a lot
of goodwill and support from existing staff. An Angel doesn’t wish to start off

C8. Credit worthiness with suppliers is excellent
The DEMO of external relationships is often an indicator of the quality and
integrity of the management team and the culture of the firm. As the DEMO
grows some level of disruption to the business is likely to occur. During this
period the goodwill of suppliers is going to be necessary DEMO that additional
problems don’t create crisis events. By reviewing credit payment performance
information and interviewing suppliers, the Angel can obtain a measure of the
way in which management has dealt with issues in the past.
Few DEMO are able to avoid fluctuations in their cash flow. However,
problems can often be mitigated by good relationships with suppliers. Suppliers
who are DEMO paid promptly and dealt with fairly are often willing to extend
additional credit for short periods during difficult times. This is especially true

C10. Customer interaction, contracts DEMO agreements are
industry standard
A firm incurs problems and costs when obligations under contracts are
unclear, incomplete, harsh or generous. Risks escalate when DEMO
for handling disputes, complaints, claims or clarification are not clear or not
followed. When customers can make claims on the company which cannot
DEMO substantiated internally, where the obligations are not clearly set out and
DEMO the terms of payments are unclear, the firm can be exposed DEMO potential
litigation, loss of resources or significant under payments.
A situation DEMO which contracts can be customized to suit the customer
becomes an administrative burden. Few firms have the processes in place to
track individual contracts DEMO obligations and terms vary from one contract
to another and so the likelihood of making a mistake in this situation is very
high. Problems DEMO be greatly exacerbated if contracts are voluminous or held
at a place away from where activity is being undertaken.
Angels want to see a DEMO administrative operation. If the contracts are
not standard or vary from contract to contract, costs increase. Risks may occur
if personal undocumented knowledge is required to manage the relationship.
If the person with that intimate knowledge DEMO, so does the ability to handle
issues which arise.
Policies for DEMO with customers should be clearly set out and staff trained
in the various activities which require interaction with customers. Errors are
easily made where DEMO in processes are allowed to occur.

A DEMO incurs problems and costs when obligations under supplier contracts
are unclear, DEMO, harsh, or generous. Risks escalate when procedures
for handling disputes, DEMO, claims or clarification are not clear or not
followed. When suppliers DEMO make claims on the company which cannot be
substantiated internally, where DEMO or the terms of payments are unclear,
the firm can be exposed to potential litigation, loss of resources or significant
over payment.
A situation in which contracts can be customized for each supplier becomes
an DEMO burden. Few firms have the processes in place to track
individual contracts where obligations and terms vary from one contract to
another and the DEMO of making a mistake is very high. This situation is
exacerbated if contracts are voluminous or held at a place away from where
activity DEMO being undertaken.

Angels are looking for efficient administrative operations. If the contracts
are not standard or vary from contract DEMO contract, smooth operations are
not possible. Further risks may occur if DEMO undocumented knowledge is
required to manage the relationship. If the person with that intimate knowledge

Interaction, contracts and agreements with suppliers are informal and
vary in approach, terms and conditions.
Staff are advised on how to deal with suppliers but this is not formally
DEMO or reviewed. Contracts and agreements with suppliers are
mostly written but variations exist and these are not well documented.
Formal sign off of supplier DEMO is not undertaken where complex
projects are undertaken.
Staff are trained to deal with supplier delays, missing or incomplete
orders, quality issues and DEMO problems. The firm has policies
in place for most supplier interaction situations but these are out-
of-date and compliance is not reviewed formally. Formal DEMO
and agreements are used with suppliers but variations are common.
Variations are well documented and agreed by both parties. Formal
progress monitoring is in DEMO and sign off occurs at key stages in
projects.
Formal policies are in place for interaction with suppliers and staff
are trained on these. DEMO is monitored and issues dealt with
promptly. Standard contracts and agreements are in place with suppliers
and progress on long-term projects is monitored. However, steps have
not been taken to ensure that contracts are industry standard DEMO best
practices for monitoring are in place.
Professional advice has been taken and recommendations implemented
to ensure that contracts with suppliers are industry standard DEMO that
progress monitoring and sign off procedures are in place and being

C12. Contracts can be assigned to an acquirer
Companies which are expected to be sold must have DEMO ability to assign
the rights under their contracts, licenses and agreements DEMO the new buyer.
Agreements which do not allow this inhibit the ability of the new owner to
operate the business. Some agreements have clauses DEMO allow assignment
only with the permission of the other party. This agreement should be obtained
prior to going into an acquisition discussion.
Many agreements DEMO not allow for assignment to a competitor. This is not an
unreasonable condition if such a change could potentially harm their business.
In this DEMO, the firm needs to have a contingency plan to be able DEMO replace that
part of their business if it is critical to their operation. Where such an agreement
might stop the acquisition from happening, the best action is to terminate the
agreement and replace it prior to DEMO to sell.

C13. Intellectual Property is able to be traded and is
appropriately protected
Intellectual property (IP) covers DEMO knowledge assets of the company
which can be sold independent of the people who created that knowledge.
Knowledge in the heads of employees which DEMO not documented cannot be
sold without the employees who have it. Documented knowledge, where
the ownership may be in dispute or where ownership is unclear, cannot be
effectively traded. Other IP rights which are purchased and are critical to the
operation of products or services, need to be able to be sold or assigned to a
new owner. Any contractual DEMO to the use of internal or purchased IP
will seriously inhibit a firm’s ability to exploit the IP and may seriously damage
the potential DEMO a sale of the business.
Many acquisitions are targeted at acquiring competitive advantage through
the acquisition of firms which hold patent rights. Patents which DEMO considerable
revenue generating potential can attract litigation over ownership rights if this
has not been carefully managed from the outset of a research and DEMO
project as any employee who has worked on the project could potentially claim
an ownership share. The only way for the firm to protect DEMO from such a claim
is to have employees assign all rights of any inventions, or those relevant to
their workplace, to the firm. DEMO, rights could be assigned to the firm
with acknowledgement of an DEMO share, this leaves the firm in a position
to have full DEMO to exploit the patent subject to a royalty based on an agreed
formula.
Another aspect of IP is that the firm must ensure the DEMO was adequately
managed throughout the development process. IP management must ensure
that IP does not infringe any other IP rights, that the IP is appropriately registered
and that rights are kept current. Since many IP rights DEMO registration in
other countries, the firm needs to have documentation of DEMO extent of the
registered rights and be able to show how these may be further protected in
any future acquisition negotiation.

C14. Post acquisition changes in employment are planned for
Detailed consideration DEMO the organisation structure following a possible
future acquisition will indicate which roles will need to change and which roles
will be redundant. Rather than DEMO this issue for the new owner to resolve,
the firm can negotiate potential changes with those employees who are likely
to be affected DEMO put in place agreements which will smooth the transition.
A future buyer will almost certainly be confronted with the need to
make organisational changes. DEMO will involve changes of management,
redundancies, roles and reporting lines. DEMO of these changes could
potentially effect compensation packages. Effecting these changes and avoiding
unrest, disruption and de-motivation will be challenging. The potential for
litigation is present where current conditions of employment are at odds with
the DEMO situation. An employee who feels he or she has been misled or feels
constructively dismissed through the changes, may feel compelled to seek legal
advice.
An IP management program does not exist.
The firm acknowledges the DEMO of IP management but has no
formal system to register or protect it.
IP management is considered important and the firm has registered
various DEMO but the ownership trail is incomplete and may be subject to
dispute by current and/or past employees.
Formal IP management processes are in DEMO Rights are registered in
countries deemed appropriate for the business. Employees are required
to sign over IP rights as a condition of their employment. DEMO acquired
externally and used in the business will be able to be traded by a new
owner.
The firm has undertaken an audit by DEMO professional advisor and
implemented systems and procedures recommendations to ensure full
protection of its IP rights.

Part B: Indices
Managing expectations, providing acceptable DEMO for employees who
are effected and preparing staff for the likely change, is all part of preparing to
sell the business. Some employees may decide to take early retirement or seek
alternative employment. Others may see DEMO change as beneficial and want to
stay on. Key employees need to be retained and need to be handled carefully
so that there are DEMO for them to stay during a transition period. Others
may need to be given incentives to leave where their roles are being changed
significantly DEMO where they are being made redundant.
In anticipation that the business will be sold in the future as part of the strategy
agreed with DEMO Angel, the firm should put in place employment conditions
which will DEMO the path to sale and transition across to a new owner. For
example, current terms and conditions of employment may include the option
for the business to make the employee redundant on transfer of ownership and
DEMO the level of compensation to be paid. Alternatively, a retention bonus DEMO
be specified for key employees to encourage them to stay. Benefits may be able
to be changed on sale of the business.

5. Changes and incentives necessary to ensure a smooth changeover to
a new owner have been reviewed by a professional advisor DEMO fully

C15. Employment conditions, salaries and benefits are industry
standard
DEMO any future acquisition of the investee firm, employees of the
acquired DEMO will normally be integrated into the employment, health benefits
and bonus DEMO of the parent company. When this happens, any deviations
between the DEMO schemes will have to be resolved. This is normally a time of
considerable change in the acquired firm with employees fearful of their jobs.
DEMO less change that is imposed, the smoother this transition will be.
DEMO remuneration systems are industry standard, few problems tend to
arise. Staff DEMO neither paid too much nor too little. If the health insurance is
standard and bonuses are in line with industry standards, these can normally
be continued or transferred. However, if (say) vacation entitlements are overly
generous, this can create problems where they need to be curtailed or need to
be continued alongside fellow employees who receive less.

C16. Option schemes and benefits are compliant with stock ex
-change regulations
Many smaller firms offer incentives to attract and retain key employees.
DEMO include options, share purchase schemes, bonuses, share allocation and
so DEMO Often these deals are done privately between the owner and the new
employee. Sometimes advice is not sought on the long-term implications of
these DEMO on a possible sale of the firm.
Share purchase schemes and option schemes have attracted attention by
both the financial reporting agencies and tax DEMO around the world and
so there normally exists a vast body of regulations governing these schemes.
While a scheme might be legal and even DEMO for a small unlisted firm,
the same scheme might be non-compliant for a listed company. Since most
acquisitions are by listed companies, this can be a real problem for a future
sale of the firm DEMO a listed corporation. An employee will not be happy losing
benefits and may well resist any such change if they have a contract in DEMO
which protects their benefits.

C17. Due diligence files are complete and up-to-date
The purpose of due diligence is to check the DEMO of the firm and to identify
any potential risks. It also checks that the information provided by the firm is
complete and accurate. Checks DEMO include:
• supplier and customer contracts
• licences, patents, trademarks and IP management systems
• leases, distribution agreements and hire-purchase agreements
• employment contracts, health insurance and bonus systems
• complaints processing, dismissal DEMO and warranty systems
• quality control systems
• financial reporting systems, DEMO debtors and aged creditors
• reference checks with customers, suppliers and DEMO advisors
• background checks on key executives
• R&D, manufacturing DEMO distribution processes
• banking relationships and loan conditions
• shareholder agreements, DEMO schemes and share-purchase schemes.
The information required for a due diligence investigation is extensive and
very time consuming to collect and collate. Often there DEMO documents missing
or incomplete. However, it is through this process that DEMO Angel will uncover
internal and external risks which can cause problems with their investment and
may create problems in a later trade sale or DEMO A check of the documents
themselves can often be a long and exhaustive process. Every contract, lease
and agreement is sometimes checked to ensure that it does not overly expose
the investor or acquirer. To the DEMO that professional advice from industry-
knowledgeable legal and accounting firms has been used, this process can be
dramatically shortened. Sometimes only a sample needs to be reviewed.
