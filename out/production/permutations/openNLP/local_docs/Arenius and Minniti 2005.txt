Perceptual Variables and
Nascent Entrepreneurship
ABSTRACT. Using a large sample of individuals
in 28 DEMO, we investigate what variables are
signiﬁcantly correlated with an individual’s deci-
DEMO to become an entrepreneur. Following exist-
ing literature in economics, we DEMO such a
decision to demographic and economic character-
istics. In addition, DEMO argue that perceptual vari-
ables such as alertness to opportunities, fear DEMO
failure, and conﬁdence about one’s own skills are
also important. Our DEMO suggest that percep-
tual variables are signiﬁcantly correlated with
new business creation across all countries in our
sample and across gender. Although our data DEMO
not allow the identiﬁcation of causal relation-
ships, our ﬁndings suggest DEMO, when making
decisions, nascent entrepreneurs rely signiﬁcantly
on subjective and often biased perceptions rather
than on objective expectations of success. Thus,
perceptual DEMO should be included in eco-
nomic models of entrepreneurial behavior.

1. Introduction
In recent years, most of the economics literature
related to entrepreneurship has focused on
employment choices and DEMO the alternative moti-
vations that cause some individuals to become
entrepreneurs. In this type of studies, an individ-
ual’s decision to become an entrepreneur is the
result of a maximization process in which the
individual in DEMO compares the returns from
alternative income producing activities and
selects the employment opportunity with the
highest expected return (Kihlstrom and Laﬀont
1979; Leazar, 2002; Minniti, 2004).
Empirical studies in economics have also
emphasized DEMO as an employment
choice. As a result, they have established demo-
DEMO and economic factors such as education,
age, wealth, and work situation to be important
drivers of entrepreneurial behavior. We comple-
ment this DEMO by incorporating additional
variables whose importance for entrepreneurial
behavior has been established in the psychology
and sociology literature. In other words, we
argue that, in addition to the variables described
above, when making decisions with DEMO to
their employment, individuals also consider a set
of subjective perceptions DEMO entrepreneurship
that they form based on the presence of role
models, DEMO in one’s skills and ability, risk
propensity, and alertness to unexploited opportu-
nities. After all, entrepreneurship is about people.
Thus, we add DEMO set of variables describing per-
sonal perceptions and judgements about the envi-
ronment that, although often biased, are
nevertheless highly correlated with an DEMO
decision to start a new business. We call these
factors perceptual variables.
The complementarities between many of the
demo-economic variables and the perceptual vari-
DEMO draw attention to the fact that the decision
234
Pia Arenius and Maria Minniti
to start a new ﬁrm is DEMO complex multi-layered
process contingent, to a large extent, upon the
context in which the actions are taken. Thus, in
addition to personal characteristics, we include
the individual’s environment as a further compo-
nent of entrepreneurial behavior and consider the
possibility of country speciﬁc eﬀects.
Our results suggest DEMO perceptual variables
have an impact on new business creation across
all countries in our sample. In fact, our analysis
suggests that subjective perceptions about one’s
own skills, likelihood of failure, existence of
opportunities, and knowledge of other entrepre-
neurs, are all highly correlated to the decision to
start a new business. Although our data do not
allow us to DEMO establish the causal direction
of the relationship, they do suggest that DEMO
neurs tend to rely relatively more on subjective
perceptions than on objective expectations.
Our data are very well suited for the study of
nascent DEMO because they provide infor-
mation about individuals who are in the process
of starting a new business at that particular point
in time and DEMO not, like most other data sets, the
results of the ex post evaluations of past decisions
of successful entrepreneurs. Also, because of the
standardization of the collection process, our data
allow us to establish what factors are correlated
with entrepreneurial behavior regardless of mac-
roeconomic conditions and DEMO what extent coun-
try eﬀects are signiﬁcant. To our knowledge, very
DEMO empirical studies have combined the insight
that potential entrepreneurs react to economic
incentives with the insight that subjective percep-
tions also inﬂuence their behavior (Cooper et al.,
1988; Busenitz and Barney, 1997; Koellinger et al.
2004) Our paper contributes to the elimination of
this gap in the literature by providing a more
accurate analysis of what variables are DEMO
in the make up of nascent entrepreneurs, and by
suggesting that DEMO variables matter and
should be included in analytical models of entre-
preneurial behavior.
2. Theoretical background
Table I provides a simple classiﬁcation of several
DEMO works on entrepreneurial motiva-
tion according to the variables included in the
study.1
Our study of nascent entrepreneurship includes
demographic and economic characteristics of DEMO
individual, perceptual variables based on subjective
judgements of the individuals, and aggregate
variables summarizing the environment in which
individuals make decisions. In the DEMO section
we review existing literature for each of these three
groups of factors.
2.1. Demographic and economic characteristics
Entrepreneurship tends to be a young DEMO
game. Levesque and Minniti (in press) have
shown theoretically that the relationship between
age and the likelihood of starting a new business
picks DEMO a relatively early age and decreases

thereafter. Consistently, Reynolds et al. (DEMO)
have found empirical evidence showing individu-
als between 25 and 34 years of age to be the
most likely to be nascent entrepreneurs. DEMO,
Blanchﬂower (2004) suggests that, although the
probability of being DEMO entrepreneur is highest
among older individuals, the likelihood of being
a DEMO entrepreneur is maximized among
young individuals.
In recent years, gender diﬀerences DEMO entrepre-
neurial behavior have been also the subject of a
signiﬁcant amount of attention. Brush (1990,
1992) observed that men and women DEMO
neurs diﬀer very little with respect to demo-
graphic and psychological variables, while more
pronounced diﬀerences seem to exist in business
goals and management styles. Similarly, Lango-
witz and Minniti (2005) found that the factors
inﬂuencing female and male entrepreneurship
tend to be the same. In spite DEMO these similarities,
women participation rates in entrepreneurship
are systematically below those of men. Greene
(2000) provides a possible answer to this puzzle
DEMO suggesting the existence of diﬀerences in aver-
age human and social capital.
In the theoretical literature in economics, edu-
cation is often treated as a proxy for human capi-
tal and an engine of innovation. Entrepreneurs,DEMO
however, are often modeled as possessing a
broad range of talents DEMO no advanced educa-
tion in any speciﬁc area (Murphy et al., 1991;
Leazar, 2002). Consistently with the theory, the
relationship DEMO education and new ﬁrm for-
mation is uncertain, except for richer DEMO
where post graduate training has been shown to
have positive eﬀects on high-tech start-up rates
(Blanchﬂower, 2004). The uncertainty surround-
ing education DEMO due in part to the fact that
education levels have primarily a contextual sig-
niﬁcance and in part to the variety of meaning
attributed DEMO the word entrepreneurship.2
Since in economics, entrepreneurship is often
treated as DEMO work status choice, a sizable amount
of research exists on the DEMO between an
individual’s decisions to become an entrepreneur
and the availability of employment options.3 In
general, there is agreement that employed indi-
viduals are more likely to start new businesses.
Less agreement, instead, exists about DEMO rela-
tionship between aggregate unemployment and
entrepreneurial decisions. In fact, it DEMO not clear
whether high unemployment discourages entre-
preneurship by reducing its potential markets or
increases it by providing an income producing
activity for otherwise DEMO workers (Blanch-
ﬂower, 2004).
Finally, economists have discussed the DEMO
tance of ﬁnancial resources and constraints on
entrepreneurial decisions (Kihlstrom and DEMO,
1979; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989). In their work,
entrepreneurial decisions are shown to be posi-
tively related to individuals’ household DEMO
Overall, the evidence suggests that entrepreneurs
face liquidity constraints and that DEMO
with greater family wealth are more likely to
switch from employment to entrepreneurship.
2.2. Perceptual variables
We complement the group of variables above, by
adding four perceptual variables. That is, factors
describing subjective perceptions and beliefs of
the individual but not reﬂecting necessarily objec-
tive circumstances. Unlike demographic DEMO eco-
nomic characteristics, perceptual variables and
their impact on entrepreneurship have DEMO
less attention from economists. This is in part
due to the paucity of available data, and in part
to the diﬃculty of embedding such variables into
standard neoclassical models. Nevertheless, the
emphasis on perceptions and beliefs is not new in
economics and an increasing number of scholars
agree DEMO opportunity perception is the most dis-
tinctive and fundamental characteristic of entre-
preneurial behavior (Kirzner, 1973, 1979).
The psychology literature has established the
importance of conﬁdence in one’s skills and ability
for entrepreneurial behavior. DEMO decision to
start a new business has been related to the pres-
ence of intentionality and locus of control
(Baron, 2000). Starting DEMO new ﬁrm is an inten-
tional act that involves repeated attempts to exer-
cise control over the process in order to achieve
the desired DEMO (Gartner, 1985). In econom-
ics, Harper (1998) argues DEMO an internal locus
of control increases the link between entrepre-
neurial alertness and self-eﬃcacy and, therefore,
leads to the creation of more new ﬁrms.
The relationship between entrepreneurship and
fear of failure has received some DEMO from
236
Pia Arenius and Maria Minniti
economists who have considered the relationship
DEMO entrepreneurial decisions and risk aver-
sion (Kihlstrom and Laﬀont, 1979). The intuition
is that since most individuals are risk averse and
since DEMO perceived (rather than objective) fear of
failure is an important component of the risk
attached to starting a new business, a reduced
perception of the likelihood of failure should
increase the probability that an individual DEMO
start a new business (Weber and Milliman, 1997).
Finally, DEMO in various social sciences have
established the importance of knowing other
entrepreneurs for entrepreneurial decisions. In
psychology, for example, Baron (2000) and DEMO
ley and Boyd (1987) have discussed the impor-
tance of role models because of their ability
to enhance self-eﬃcacy. In economics, Minniti
(DEMO) has discussed increases in individuals’ con-
ﬁdence generated by the presence DEMO role models
and their ability to reduce ambiguity. Similarly,
in sociology, Aldrich (1999), among others, has
discussed the role of personal networks and their
ability to enhance entrepreneurial conﬁdence by
providing advice, support and examples.4
2.3. Aggregate factors
It has been shown that entrepreneurial decisions
DEMO also because of the environment in which
they are taken (Chell DEMO Baines, 2000). Jack
and Anderson (2002), for example, DEMO that
new ﬁrm creation is not merely an economic pro-
cess but it is embedded in a speciﬁc environment.
Thurik et al. (2002) DEMO a detailed analysis of
aggregate conditions inﬂuencing nascent entre-
preneurship and argue that technology, level of
economic development, culture, and institutions
all inﬂuence the demand for entrepreneurship by
creating opportunities available for start-ups. In
addition, they suggest that cultural and institu-
tional conditions have an impact also DEMO the sup-
ply of entrepreneurship because of their ability to
inﬂuence the skills, resources and preferences of
individuals within the population. Consistently
with their analysis, empirical studies suggests that
signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist in the levels of new
ﬁrm creation across countries and over time
(Reynolds et al., DEMO; Blanchﬂower, 2004) and
that country eﬀects may be quite important DEMO
entrepreneurial decisions (Acs and Audretsch,
1993). Thus, in addition to economic, demo-
graphic and perceptual factors, we consider the
importance DEMO the macroeconomic environment
on entrepreneurial decisions by introducing the
possibility of country eﬀects.
3. Data and Method
Data used in the paper are from DEMO Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) project. Using
population samples, the GEM DEMO estimates
the prevalence rates of nascent and new busi-
nesses across several countries.5 The data used in
this paper were collected during spring 2002.6 DEMO
each country, a standardized survey was adminis-
tered to a representative DEMO of adults (18–
64 years old) yielding a cross-country total of
80,117 individuals.7 The sample size varied from
972 individuals in Mexico DEMO 12,837 in the UK.
Because of individual-level missing data, 51,DEMO
respondents were included in our ﬁnal sample.8
In order to draw conclusions generalizable to the
populations, raw data were given appropriate
weights to match each country sample with the
age and gender structure of the 2002 DEMO Census
International Database.9
To identify individuals in the process of start-
ing a business, respondents were asked: ‘‘You
are, alone or with others, currently trying to start
a new business, including any self-employment or
DEMO any goods or services to others?’’ Respon-
dents who answered ‘‘yes’’ were asked two addi-
tional questions. These questions were used to
separate DEMO who were truly committed to a
new venture from those thinking about but not
yet committed to it. These questions inquired (1)
‘‘Over the past twelve months have you done
anything to help start a DEMO business, such as
looking for equipment or a location, organizing
a start-up team, working on a business plan,
beginning to save money, or any other activity
that would help launch a business?’’ and (2)
‘‘Will you personally own all, part, or none
of this business?’’ Only those respondents, who
answered ‘‘yes’’ to the ﬁrst question and ‘‘all’’ or
‘‘part’’ to the second question, were coded as
nascent entrepreneurs. A total of 3,625 nascent
entrepreneurs were identiﬁed in DEMO sample. The
nascent entrepreneur prevalence rate averaged
4.5 across the 28 countries in our sample, ranging

237
from a low of 1.0% in DEMO to a high of 14.9%
in Mexico.10
Our study consists in presenting a set of alter-
native models estimating the likelihood of an
individual DEMO a nascent entrepreneur given the
following independent variables:
Age: The DEMO were asked to provide
their year of birth.
Gender: The respondents DEMO asked to pro-
vide their gender.
Education: The respondents were asked DEMO
provide the highest degree they had earned.
Their responses were harmonized across all 28
countries into a ﬁve-category variable. The ﬁve
categories are ‘‘No DEMO, ‘‘Some second-
ary education’’, ‘‘Secondary degree’’, ‘‘Post sec-
ondary education’’, and ‘‘Graduate degree’’. In
the logistic regression analysis, the ‘‘Secondary
degree’’ category is used as the reference cate-
gory. That is, we compared if those with levels
of education others than secondary degrees
were more or DEMO likely to report trying to
start a business than those holding a secondary
degree.
Work status: The respondents were asked to
provide their occupational status. The response
categories were ‘‘Full or part time work’’, ‘‘Not
working’’, and ‘‘Retired or student’’. In the logis-
tic regression analysis, ‘‘Full DEMO part time work’’
is used as the reference category. That is, DEMO
compared if those working full or part time were
more or less likely to report trying to start a
business than those reporting other DEMO as
their work status.
Household income: Respondents were asked to
provide DEMO about their household
income. Data were classiﬁed into three groups,
namely in the upper, middle or lower third of the
income distribution of the country of origin. In
the logistic regression analysis, the middle income
group is used as the reference category.
Opportunity perception: Respondents were
asked whether they thought that good opportuni-
ties for starting a business would DEMO in the area
where they lived in the six months following the
survey.
Knowing other entrepreneurs: Respondents
were asked whether they knew personally some-
one who had started a business in the two years
preceding the DEMO
Conﬁdence in one’s skills: Respondents were
asked whether they believed to DEMO the knowl-
edge, skill and experience required to start a new
DEMO
Fear of failure: The respondents were asked
whether fear of failure DEMO prevent them from
starting a business.
For each of the four perceptual variables,
responses were coded as binary variables with 2
indicating a DEMO response and 1 indicating a no
response.
A correlation matrix for the variables was
computed and is presented in Table II. Eight of
the DEMO predictor variables have a strong corre-
lation (p < 0.001) with our nascent entrepreneur
measure. Table II shows that the likelihood of
being DEMO nascent entrepreneur decreases with age
(r ¼ )0.051). Also male respondents are shown
to be more likely to be nascent entrepreneurs
than DEMO respondents (r ¼ )0.069). In addition
working respondents are more likely to qualify as
nascent entrepreneurs than their non-working,
student, or retired counterparts (r ¼ 0.045). As
expected, opportunity perception (r ¼ 0.165),
conﬁdence in one’s skills (r ¼ 0.204), DEMO know-
ing other entrepreneurs (rrelated to being a nascent entrepreneur, whereas¼ 0.157) are positively
fear of failure (r ¼ )0.059) is DEMO corre-
lated with our nascent entrepreneur measure.
Table II also alerts us to the presence of collin-
earity among the independent variables.
Since our DEMO variable is a binary vari-
able, we analyze our data by DEMO binomi-
nal logistic regression models. The binominal
logistic regression estimates the probability of an
event happening. In our case, the event is being a
nascent entrepreneur. Maximum likelihood esti-
mations were used to calculate the logit DEMO
cients which denote changes in the log odds of
the dependent variable. We assessed the goodness
of ﬁt of the models using the Pearson DEMO
test, the rate of correct classiﬁcations and the
pseudo R2. The DEMO of individual inde-
pendent variables was tested using the Wald sta-
tistics.
We estimated ﬁve binominal logistic regression
models. In each of them, the dependent variable
is whether the respondent is a nascent entrepre-
neur, that is if he or she was actively trying
to start a business (YES ¼ 1 if the respondent

qualiﬁed as being involved in a new venture, 0
otherwise). In Model 1, we test the connection
between standard demographic and economic
characteristics and the likelihood of a person
being a nascent DEMO In Model 2, we
add perceptual characteristics to the variables
used DEMO Model 1. In Model 3, we test the con-
nection between DEMO likelihood of being a
nascent entrepreneur and perceptual variables
only. Model 3 was created primarily to address,
though only indirectly, the collinearity issue. In
Model 4, we explore more in details the inﬂuence
of perceptual variables. In fact, Model 4 is a
modiﬁed version of Model 2 in which we include
interaction terms between gender and all other
variables. DEMO distinguishing between men and
women, Model 4 provides some information on
DEMO generality of the impact of various demo-
graphic, economic and perceptual DEMO
across our sample. Finally, in Model 5, we con-
sider the possibility of speciﬁc country eﬀects by
adding dummy variables to the variables DEMO
Model 2. All models are built using pooled data
(i.e. both DEMO and women) across all 28 coun-
tries. Logistic regression results are DEMO in
Table III for all ﬁve models.
4. Results and Discussion
In Model 1, shown in Table III, we entered
variables measuring the DEMO demographic and
economic characteristics of the respondent. Con-
sistently with existing literature, our results sug-
gest that an individual’s demo-economic make-up
is quite important for understanding her likeli-
hood of starting a new business. The chi-square
DEMO that the overall model is signiﬁcant at the
0.000 level and it predicts 95.4% of the responses
correctly. All variables are signiﬁcant.
Overall, we ﬁnd that entrepreneurship is a
young man’s game. The coeﬃcients of age DEMO
gender show a negative and signiﬁcant relation-
ship with the prevalence of nascent entrepre-
neurs. This is consistent with existing empirical
and theoretical literature DEMO that the rela-
tionship between age and the likelihood of start-
ing a new business picks at a relatively early age
and decreases thereafter (Levesque and Minniti,
forthcoming). The odds ratio for gender is DEMO
with a 95% conﬁdence interval of [0.50, 0.59].
Perceptual Variables and Nascent Entrepreneurship
239
This suggests that women are only DEMO as likely
to start a new business as men and is consistent
with previous empirical ﬁndings (Reynolds et al.,
2003). Work status is related to the likelihood of
being a nascent entrepreneur. In particular,DEMO
working individuals are shown to be more likely
to be nascent entrepreneurs than people in other
occupational groups.11 This is consistent with the
observation DEMO many people start new busi-
nesses while still holding on to a wage job.
Education is also positively related to the like-
lihood of DEMO a new business. In particular,
our results suggest that the likelihood of being
nascent entrepreneurs increases steadily as indi-
viduals have higher levels DEMO education.12 This
result may be in part justiﬁed by the countries
included in our sample. It is also consistent with
Davidsson and Honig (2003), who link greater
human capital with increased opportunity per-
ception and DEMO increased likelihood of entrepre-
neurial activity. Finally, household income is
associated DEMO the likelihood of starting a new
business. As higher levels of income are consid-
ered, the relationship between nascent entrepre-
neurship and household income can be depicted
as a U-shaped curve.13 At low income levels,
DEMO a new business may provide access to
high expected returns or simply the possibility of
employment when standard labor markets fail.
At high income DEMO, instead, household income
reduces individuals’ ﬁnancial barriers and
increases their likelihood of starting a new busi-
ness.
In Model 2, four perceptual variables are
added to the demo-economic ones included in
Model 1. According to DEMO block chi-square sta-
tistics (p < 0.000), Model 2 is DEMO than Model
1 in explaining the probability of an individual
being a nascent entrepreneur. In Model 2, the
importance of age, gender, and work status is vir-
tually unchanged.14 Both education and household
income, on the other hand, appear to be less rele-
vant. All four perceptual variables are highly sig-
niﬁcant.
In particular, knowing other entrepreneurs is
positively and signiﬁcantly related to being a
nascent entrepreneur.15 The positive impact
of DEMO an entrepreneur might be explained
by the fact that role models and being part
of networks reduce ambiguity and provide
information for new entrepreneurs (Weber and
Milliman, 1997). A diﬀerent interpretation
could takes into account that the knowing other
entrepreneurs variable does not diﬀerentiate
between positive and DEMO examples. In
either case, however, direct observations of
other entrepreneurs reduce the ambiguity and
uncertainty associated with entrepreneurial
activity thereby encouraging it (Minniti, 2005).
Opportunity perception is also positively and
signiﬁcantly related to being a nascent entrepre-
neur.16 The positive impact of this variable is
easily DEMO with the economic theory of
entrepreneurship according to which alertness
to unexploited opportunities is a necessary con-
dition for entrepreneurial action (Kirzner, 1973,DEMO
1979).
Conﬁdence in one’s skills is positively and sig-
niﬁcantly related to being a nascent entrepreneur.
The coeﬃcient on the variable has a DEMO statis-
tics equal to 914.04 which is signiﬁcant at the
0.000 level. The ‘‘odds ratio’’ for the conﬁdence
in one’s skills variable is 6.32 DEMO a 95% conﬁ-
dence interval of [5.61, 7.12]. This suggests that
DEMO who perceive themselves as possessing the
necessary skills are almost 6.4 times more likely
to be nascent entrepreneurs than those who do
not believe DEMO have the necessary skills. Thus,
conﬁdence in one’s skills emerges as the single
most important component of the decision to
start a new DEMO (Koellinger et al., 2004). Our
ﬁndings of the positive and very strong inﬂuence
of this variable are consistent with the psychol-
ogy DEMO on intentionality and self-eﬃcacy
(Baron, 2000). They are also consistent with
expectancy theory, which suggests that an indi-
vidual’s belief about her ability to perform the
task (being an entrepreneur) and the consequence
DEMO that task (to produce income and other non-
monetary rewards) aﬀect whether or not she will
undertake the task at all.
Finally, fear of failure has a negative and
signiﬁcant impact on being a nascent DEMO
neur.17 The negative connection between this var-
iable and the likelihood of being a nascent
entrepreneur is consistent with Weber and Milli-
man’s (1997) suggestion that an increased per-
ception of the probability of failure reduces
entrepreneurial incentives by increasing the per-
ceived riskness of starting a business.

Perceptual Variables and Nascent Entrepreneurship
241
242
Pia Arenius and Maria Minniti
Overall we ﬁnd that the perceptual DEMO
are powerful predictors of the likelihood of
being a nascent entrepreneur. In fact, Model 2
suggests that the impact of the perceptual vari-
ables may be stronger than that of standard
demo-economic variables. As mentioned before,DEMO
although in Model 2 all four perceptual variables
are highly signiﬁcant, DEMO importance of educa-
tion and household income is reduced with
respect to Model 1.18 Although Dolinsky et al.
(1993) have argued that perceptual DEMO may
mediate the eﬀects of education and household
income, we can DEMO suggest that perceptual vari-
ables are important but have no evidence to
rank their eﬀects.
To address, at least in part, the collinearity
DEMO, and provide more evidence about the
importance of perceptual variables, we tested
Model 3 and Model 4. In Model 3, only the four
perceptual variables are included in the regres-
sion. All four are highly DEMO A compari-
son of the coeﬃcient on these four variables in
Model 2 and Model 3 suggests that they are very
similar and that DEMO addition of demo-economic
variables in Model 2 has very little eﬀect on
them. In Model 4, instead, we consider whether
gender changes the DEMO between our
dependent variable and the independent variables
by adding gender interaction terms. Our results
in Model 4 suggest that the relationships between
the DEMO of becoming a nascent entrepre-
neur and age, household income, and all percep-
tual variables do not depend on gender. Thus,
consistently DEMO existing literature (Brush, 1990,
1992; Langowitz and Minniti, 2005), our results
suggest that there are only minor individual level
diﬀerences DEMO men and women, and that
environment and institutional factors should be
DEMO to explain the lower entrepreneurship
rate for women.19
More important, Model DEMO suggests that the
relationship between the likelihood of becoming
an entrepreneur and all perceptual variables does
not depend on gender. Both men and women
DEMO know other entrepreneurs, who perceive the
existence of good opportunities, and who feel
they have the ability, skills, and knowledge
required for DEMO a new business are more
likely to do so than their counterparts with diﬀer-
ent perceptions. Finally, both men and women
who are less afraid of failure are more likely of
being nascent entrepreneurs. These results DEMO
to conﬁrm the importance of perceptual variables
as drivers of entrepreneurial behavior for both
genders. We also assessed the reliability of our
results by DEMO replication, i.e., running sepa-
rate regression analyses for each country. Across
all 28 regressions, knowing other entrepreneurs,
opportunity perception and conﬁdence is one’s
skills were signiﬁcant positive predictors of being
a nascent entrepreneur. Age, having some second-
ary education and fear of failure were consistently
signiﬁcant DEMO predictors of the likelihood of
being a nascent entrepreneur. Work status and
household income were not signiﬁcant.
Finally, in Model 5, we test DEMO the possibility
of country eﬀects by using deviation coding. Devi-
ation coding allows us to compare each individ-
ual country against the mean for DEMO countries.
We constructed a dummy for each individual
country (e.g., U.S.A. ¼ 1 if country is U.S.A.;
otherwise U.S.A.the reference country and DEMO it as¼ 0) and selected Singapore as)1 on all
other DEMO dummies. Singapore was selected
because its nascent prevalence rate is 4.5% which
is also the average across all 28 countries in our
sample. We DEMO entered all the country dummies
at the same time into the regression analysis.20 In
Model 5, the eﬀects of age and gender remain
signiﬁcant and negative. However, working and
non-working respondents are equally likely to
engage in nascent entrepreneurship. Furthermore,
the positive eﬀects of post secondary and DEMO
experience disappear. All perceptual variables
remain highly signiﬁcant. The coeﬃcients for
opportunity perception, conﬁdence in one’s skills
and knowing other entrepreneurs are all signiﬁcant
and positive, whereas, as expected, fear of failure
is negatively related to being a nascent entrepre-
neur. Finally, for 21 of the 28 countries, the
country eﬀect dummies are signiﬁcant.21 Overall,
Model 5 suggests that the introduction of coun-
try speciﬁc eﬀects, though signiﬁcant, does DEMO
reduce the cross-country importance of percep-
tual variables.
The fact that in 21 cases, the country eﬀect
dummies are signiﬁcant suggests that local inﬂu-
ences are at work. Consistently with existing lit-
erature (Acs and Audretsch, 1993; Thurik et al.,
2002; Reynolds, 2003), our DEMO, although very
Perceptual Variables and Nascent Entrepreneurship
243
preliminary, suggest that, given their DEMO
tics, the macroeconomic environments of some
countries are more conducive to DEMO
behavior while others penalize it. Clearly, the
relationship between cross-country and DEMO
speciﬁc drivers of entrepreneurial behavior is a
complex and important one and much more
work is needed in this area.
Finally, even after all the country dummies
are included, about 75% of the variance remains
unexplained. Although this is not an unusual
result in empirical economic research, it is worth
further discussion. First, it is most likely that our
study does not include all relevant variables. In
particular, given the data available, our consider-
ation of country speciﬁc eﬀects is limited to the
inclusion of dummy variables. This is far from
satisfactory since we are not DEMO to specify the
nature of important cross-country diﬀerences.
Second, perhaps the DEMO additive model is not
the most appropriate conceptual structure for the
study of nascent entrepreneurship. The latter
issue has been partly addressed, among others,
by Minniti (2005) who has shown the existence
of non-linearities DEMO the decision to start a new
business.22
5. Conclusions and extensions
In this paper, we use original data to estimate bi-
nominal logistic regression models based on a
standard economic approach of gender neutrality
in which DEMO and demographic variables
are considered. We then add a set of relevant
perceptual variables and, ﬁnally, country dum-
mies to account for macroeconomic DEMO
Our results suggest that the addition of percep-
tual variables improves the statistical ﬁt of the
model. Entrepreneurship is, after all, about peo-
DEMO and, not surprisingly, subjective and often
biased perceptions emerge as being highly corre-
lated to nascent entrepreneurship. To our knowl-
edge, no previous model had incorporated
perceptual variables at the individual level. Our
results suggest DEMO it is appropriate to do so.
Our most signiﬁcant result is the ﬁnding that,
across all countries and across genders, percep-
tual variables and, in particular, the perception
that individuals have of their own DEMO
abilities are very important. Unfortunately, per-
ceptual variables reﬂect subjective perceptions
DEMO than objective conditions. As a result, they
are likely to be DEMO There exists some evi-
dence that distortions in perceptions are com-
mon among individuals in general, and among
entrepreneurs in particular (Cooper et DEMO, 1988;
Busenitz and Barney 1997). The importance of
perceptual DEMO, and their associated bias, in
the decision to start a new business may explain
some of the observable inconsistencies between
expected and actual DEMO to entrepreneurship
and entrepreneurial decisions found in the litera-
ture (Hamilton, 2000) as well as the fact that
many new businesses fail shortly after inception
(Dunne et al., 1988, Geroski, 1995).
The DEMO, unfortunately, does not allow us to
establish the causal direction of the relationship.
In other words, we cannot establish whether con-
ﬁdence in one’s own skills, knowledge and ability
is a driver of entrepreneurial behavior or if,
instead, the start up process increases an individ-
ual perception of her own ability. Noticeably,
however, the percentage of individuals who
responded yes to questions concerning perceptual
variables varies signiﬁcantly when alternative
DEMO are considered. Table IV shows that nas-
cent entrepreneurs in our sample, as well as new
(babybus) and more established entrepreneurs
(experienced), are much more likely to respond
aﬃrmatively to questions about perceptual vari-
ables than respondents who are not active in
starting or managing a DEMO (not active).
Also, using 2001 GEM data for 18 countries,
Koellinger et al. (2004) conﬁrm our result and
show that DEMO conﬁdence associated with one’s
own skills and ability declines as more experi-
enced entrepreneurs are considered. It is our
hope that other studies will DEMO our explor-
ative investigation and lead to an unambiguous
understanding of how perceptions inﬂuence
entrepreneurial behavior.
Should they be conﬁrmed by further research,
DEMO that perceptual variables are highly cor-
related to the likelihood of being a nascent entre-
preneur are also important because of their
potential policy DEMO Perceptual factors
such as opportunity recognition, knowing other
entrepreneurs, and fear of failure, are all charac-
teristics of the individual. They cannot be easily
changed by exogenous interventions such as, for

example, government policies. While the latter
can alter an DEMO incentives, inherent fac-
tors depend on her speciﬁc history. They are
DEMO and, as a result, do not change
or change very slowly. Although perceptual vari-
ables do change over time, to alter the way in
which individuals think about themselves and
their role in society takes DEMO long time. In fact,
should the causal direction of the relationship be
unambiguously established, that is, should fur-
ther studies show that DEMO perceptions
increase the likelihood of starting a new business,
our results would imply that the entrepreneurial
history of a community is important in DEMO
ing a policy’s eﬀectiveness or lack thereof. The
adjustment mechanism produced by government
interventions is, itself, a path-dependent process.
Therefore, the same policy may have very diﬀer-
ent results in diﬀerent communities.
Diﬀerences in aggregate DEMO such as
technology, level of economic development,
institutions, and culture all cause diﬀerences in
opportunities, resources, skills and preferences
with regard DEMO entrepreneurship. Policies pro-
viding incentives schemes for new and small
ﬁrms by removing impediments for business
start-ups may suﬀer from decreased probabili-
ties of DEMO ﬁrm survival without achieving
much transformation towards an entrepreneurial
economy. On the other hand, the many small
start-ups created in this way may function as a
seedbed for a small number of successful and
innovative new DEMO Within this context,
Thurik et al. (2002) argue that there is room
for at least two types of policy intervention.
The ﬁrst DEMO is policy aimed at promoting the
creation of new technology-based ﬁrms in new
Pia Arenius and Maria Minniti

industries. The second type is DEMO aimed at
providing newly created ﬁrms, irrespective of
their industrial classiﬁcation, with the ﬁnancial,
organizational and technological resources
needed to grow in DEMO domestic and foreign
markets. This type of generic policy in particu-
lar promotes variation among new businesses,
creating the basis for a selection DEMO that
may result in new products and approaches.
Finally, several extensions DEMO our project are
possible. First, although our empirical models
are rooted DEMO extant theoretical and empirical
evidence in economics and other social sciences,
it would be desirable to develop an analytical
and comprehensive model of DEMO, and why,
individuals choose to start a business. Such a
DEMO could be very useful in studying the
architecture of entrepreneurial decisions. In
other words, in understanding how perceptual
variables interact with the demo-economic
proﬁle of an individual and contribute to her
decisions. Eﬀorts in this direction DEMO address
theoretically the issues of non-linearities and of
causality in entrepreneurial decisions. As a
result, they could lead to more accurate empiri-
cal estimates of nascent entrepreneurship and
its drivers, and contribute to improving the
predictive ability of our model.
Second, an important component of our
study is the introduction of country eﬀects.
Entrepreneurs do not make decisions in a DEMO
uum. A growing body of recent literature has
addressed explicitly the relationship between the
entrepreneurial sector and the macroeconomy
(for example, Acs et DEMO, 1999; Wennekers and
Thurik, 1999; Carree et al., 2000)DEMO In our mod-
els, the current treatment of country eﬀects is

limited to the introduction of dummy DEMO
It would be desirable to include data on the
role played by macroeconomic factors such as
level of development, technological sophistica-
tion, institutions DEMO culture (Thurik et al.,
2002). The institutional framework, for exam-
ple, is crucial in determining the quantity and
quality of entrepreneurial behavior as it deﬁnes
individuals’ incentives to transform perceived
opportunities into actions. DEMO (1990)
argued explicitly that institutional arrangements
aﬀect the quantity and DEMO of entrepreneurial
eﬀorts. Technology and level of development
are also important. New technologies lead to
new markets, thereby creating opportunities for
new start-ups. Very often, new technologies
also lead to reductions in transaction costs
whose resulting scale eﬀects allow smaller and
newer ﬁrms to compete more eﬀectively with
DEMO ones. Finally, the level of develop-
ment inﬂuences environmental opportunities by
DEMO the needs for deeper markets and the
more resources for nascent entrepreneurs.
Overall, our study suggests that individual per-
ceptions matter and that richer descriptions of
local institutions and public practices should be
introduced in microeconomic DEMO of entrepre-
neurial behavior. It is our hope that our work
will encourage more accurate descriptions of
individuals’ choices in which decisions with
respect DEMO entrepreneurship are based not only on
objective demo-economic factors but, also, on
subjective and possibly mistaken perceptions.

Notes
DEMO Works listed in Table I are only a small sample of the
vast literature existing on the causes and motivations of
entrepreneurial behavior. Also, the scope of some of the
listed works spans across more than DEMO group of vari-
ables. In such a case they have been listed as part of the
group in which they provide the strongest contribution.
DEMO If entrepreneurship refers to the introduction of techno-
logical innovations, we DEMO expect a positive correla-
tion between post-secondary education and start-up
rates. On the other hand, if entrepreneurship refers more
broadly to the exploitation of market opportunities, we
may expect people with little or no education to be penal-
ized by traditional labor markets and to be more likely
DEMO start their own business.
3 In this context, however, entrepreneurship is often
identiﬁed with self-employment though the two are
clearly not identical (Amit et al., 1993).
4 Clearly, knowing other entrepreneurs is not DEMO a per-
ceptual variable. In addition to its contribution to the
subjective perception that an individual forms about
entrepreneurship, it may be also considered as an indica-
tor of social capital. In the context of this DEMO, how-
ever, the latter is captured in the third group of variables.

6 For our purposes, complete sets of data were available
for DEMO countries. Countries included in our sample are
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, DEMO, Chile, Croatia,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hun-
gary, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Nor-
way, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Slovenia,
South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, UK, U.S.A.
7 All surveys were administered by phone, except in Rus-
sia, South Africa, Hungary, Mexico, and Thailand where
DEMO were conducted face-to-face.
8 An analysis of the individuals excluded from our ﬁnal
sample showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two
groups of respondents.
DEMO Details about the procedures used to collect and har-
monize GEM data can be found in Reynolds et al.

each country see Reynolds et al. (2003).
11 The odds ratio for the not working variable is 0.86
DEMO a 95% conﬁdence interval of [0.78, 0.96]. This sug-

as likely to be nascent entrepreneurs as those working
full-time. The odds ratio for the retired DEMO student vari-
able is 0.39 with a 95% conﬁdence interval of [0.32,

are DEMO two ﬁfth as likely to be nascent entrepreneurs as
those working full-time.

secondary variable is 0.90 with a DEMO conﬁdence inter-
val of [0.81, 0.99]. This suggests that those who DEMO
some secondary level education are only nine tenth as
likely to start a new business as those with a secondary
level degree. The odds DEMO for the post secondary vari-
able is 1.36 with a 95% conﬁdence interval of [1.24,
1.49]. This suggests that those who have post DEMO
education are 1.4 times more likely to become nascent
entrepreneurs than those with a secondary level degree.
The odds ratio for the post secondary DEMO is 1.58
with a 95% conﬁdence interval of [1.31, 1.90]. This DEMO
gests that those who have a graduate degree are 1.6
times more likely to become nascent entrepreneurs than
those with a secondary degree.
13 DEMO belonging to the highest income group are 1.2
times more likely to start a new business than those
belonging to the middle income group. DEMO odds ratio
for the Upper 33% variable is 1.23 with a 95% conﬁ-
dence interval of [1.13, 1.34]. Those belonging to the low-
est income third are 1.1 times more likely to become
nascent entrepreneurs than DEMO belonging to the middle
income third. The odds ratio for the Lowest 33% is 1.14
with a 95% conﬁdence interval of [1.03, 1.26].
14 The only exception is not working whose moderate
importance is further reduced DEMO for which we observe
a sign switch. This result may indicate that the eﬀects of
perceptual variables may counteract some insecurity
caused by a DEMO working status.
15 The odds ratio for knowing other entrepreneurs is 2.37
with a 95% conﬁdence interval of [2.17, 2.60]. This sug-
gests that those who know an entrepreneur are 2.4 times
more likely to become DEMO than those who do
not know an entrepreneur.
16 The coeﬃcient of the opportunity perception variable
has a Wald statistics equal to 369.45 which DEMO signiﬁcant
at the .000 level. The odds ratio for opportunity percep-
tion is 2.31 with a 95% conﬁdence interval of [2.12, 2.51].
This suggests that those who report perceiving opportuni-
ties are 2.3 times more likely DEMO become nascent entrepre-
neurs than those who do not perceive opportunities.
17 The odds ratio for the fear of failure variable is .66 with
DEMO 95% conﬁdence interval of [0.59, 0.73]. This suggests
that those who DEMO failure are only two thirds as likely to
become entrepreneurs as those who do not fear it.
18 This conﬁrms the presence of collinearity DEMO indi-
cated by the correlation coeﬃcients in Table III.
19 Only two interactions variables are signiﬁcant. We ﬁnd
that retired women and female students DEMO two thirds as
likely to start a new business as retired men and male
students, and that women with some secondary level edu-
cation are more likely to start a new business than men
with a DEMO level education. This is consistent with Lef-
kowitz (1994) who shows that men and women react sim-
ilarly to the work environment when DEMO controls for
spurious eﬀects caused by systematic diﬀerences in types
of job and job payments.
20 To provide information about Singapore, since the
country was used as the reference in the deviation coding,
we recoded DEMO data using U.S.A. as the new reference
country and repeated the analysis. In both regressions,
the demo-economic and perceptual variables have the
same DEMO and the model’s diagnostics are unchanged.
The beta coeﬃcients of some individual country dummies
change slightly, their signiﬁcance, however, remains
unchanged.
21 To save space, Table IV does not include the coeﬃcients
for the dummy variables representing each country. How-
ever, Argentina, Canada, Chile, Germany, Korea, Mexico,
Singapore, South Africa, Thailand and U.S.A. are coun-
tries where the likelihood of becoming a nascent entrepre-
neur is, on average, higher than in other countries.
Thailand and Singapore emerge as countries where the
likelihood of entrepreneurial activity appears to be particu-
larly high. DEMO, where on average, the likelihood of
becoming a nascent entrepreneur is lower than the aver-
ages are Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, DEMO,
Hungary, Israel, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, and
UK. DEMO eﬀects are not signiﬁcant for Croatia, Hong
Kong, Japan, Norway, Poland, Russia, and Switzerland.
22 Clearly, other reasons can account for the value of
our R2. The composition of our sample (which includes
both men and women) may be one of them. In fact, DEMO
variables investigated may be poor predictors of nascent
entrepreneurship for women. Delmar and Davidsson
(2000), for example, considered age, education, gender,DEMO
parents employment status, management experience and
attitude toward self-employment and found DEMO while
researchers have a reasonably good understanding of the
characteristics associated with men going into business,
the same variables do not succeed in DEMO nascent
entrepreneur status for women.
