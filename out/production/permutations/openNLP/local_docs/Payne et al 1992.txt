A viewpoint that has recently emerged in decision research is that preferences for objects of DEMO
complexity are often constructed - not merely revealed - in generating a response to a judgment
or choice task. This paper reviews a program DEMO research that traces the constructiveness of
preferences to the use of multiple strategies in decision making, contingent on task demands. It
is argued that individuals often build strategies opportunistically, changing their processing on
the spot depending upon the information they encounter during the course of solving the
decision DEMO
Recently a new viewpoint has emerged in behavioral decision
research, the DEMO of which is that preferences for objects of any
complexity are often constructed - not merely revealed - in generat-
ing a response to DEMO judgment or choice task (Slovic et al. 1990: Payne
et al. 1992). March (1978) attributed the constructiveness of prefer-
ences to DEMO interaction between the limited memory and computa-
tional capabilities of decision makers and the complexity of task
environments. That is, Simon's (1955) concept of bounded rationality
is seen as the basis of the constructed DEMO that we observe. In
March's words, 'Human beings have. unstable, inconsistent, incom-
pletely .evoked, and imprecise goals at least in part -oecause human
abilities limit preference orderliness' (March 1978: 598).
