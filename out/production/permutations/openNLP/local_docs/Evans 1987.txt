THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FIRM GROWTH,
SIZE, AND AGE: ESTIMATES FOR 100
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
DAVID
S. EVANS*
The study uses a sample of DEMO firms operating in 100 manufacturing
industries to examine some aspects of firm dynamics. It finds that firm
growth, the variability of firm growth, DEMO the probability that a firm will
fail decrease with firm age. It also finds that firm growth decreases at a
diminishing rate with firm DEMO even after controlling for the exit of
slow-growing firms from the sample. Gibrat's Law therefbre fails although
the severity of the failure decreases DEMO firm size.
I. INTRODUCTION
THIs ARTICLE examines some dynamic aspects of firm behavior for all firms
that operated in a sample of 100 manufacturing DEMO between 1976
and 1980. It examines the relationship between three aspects of industry
dynamics-firm growth, firm dissolution, and the variability of firm growth-
DEMO three key characteristics of a firm-its size, its age, and the number of
plants it operates. It presents estimates of these relationships based DEMO data
pooled across all industries. It then presents a summary of the relationships
found for each of the industries.
A number of studies have DEMO the relationship between firm growth
and firm size. Hart and Prais's [1956] pioneering study of the growth of
British companies was followed by DEMO by Hymer and Pashigian [1962],
Mansfield [1962], and Hall [1987] DEMO the United States and Singh and
Whittington [1975] and Kumar [1985] for the United Kingdom. This
paper makes three contributions to this literature.
First, it examines the relationship between firm age and firm dynamics.
Except for DEMO earlier paper [1987] and Brock and Evans [1986], previous
studies have DEMO examined the lifecycle aspects of firm growth. Second, it
relies on DEMO larger and more comprehensive sample of firms and reports results
for more detailed industry groups than have previous studies. With the
exception of Mansfield DEMO, researchers have relied on samples of publicly

traded (and therefore generally large) companies and DEMO not disaggregated
these samples below the 2-digit industry level. This paper uses data on the
complete size distribution of firms in the manufacturing industries DEMO
and summarizes results for separate 4-digit industries. Third, unlike previous
studies DEMO for Hall [1987] and myself, it controls for sample selection bias
DEMO heteroskedasticity. Little hinges, however, on the statistical novelties.
The study finds several interesting relationships. First, firm growth de-
creases with firm size and firm age at the sample mean and for most of the
firms DEMO the interindustry sample. The negative relationship between growth
and size holds for 89 percent of the industries and the negative relationship
between growth and DEMO holds for 76 percent of the industries. Second, the
probability of DEMO survival increases with firm size and firm age at the sample
mean and for most of the firms in the interindustry sample. The positive
DEMO between survival and size holds for 81 percent of the industries
and the positive relationship between survival and age holds for 83 percent of
DEMO industries. Third, the variability of firm growth decreases with firm age DEMO
the sample mean and for most of the firms in the interindustry sample. The
negative relationship holds for 85 percent of the industries. The DEMO
between the variability of firm growth and firm size is less clear. There is a
negative relationship between variability and size for 80 percent DEMO the
industries. However, there is some evidence from the interindustry sample
DEMO the sign of the relationship between variability and size varies with age
and with the number of plants operated by the firm.
The study DEMO finds that firm age is an important determinant of firm
growth, DEMO variability of firm growth, and the probability of firm dissolution.
Notably, the age relationships found are broadly consistent with the pre-
dictions of DEMO's theory of firm growth in which entrepreneurs learn
about their abilities over time.' Further empirical and theoretical work on
the lifecycle dynamics of firms may hold some promise.
Gibrat's Law that firm growth is DEMO of firm size is rejected for this
sample. The departures from Gibrat's Law decrease as firm size increases.
Mansfield [1962] reached a similar DEMO and speculated that it was due to
the exit of slow-growing small firms from the sample. The departures found
here remain, however, after DEMO for sample censoring arising from firm
exit. This finding is of interest because several theories either assume or imply
Gibrat's Law for the DEMO size range of firms in homogeneous-product
industries.2

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FIRM GROWTH, SIZE, AND AGE
II. THE DEMO
The sample of firms analyzed in this study was drawn from the Small
Business Data Base (SBDB), which was constructed by the Office of Advocacy
of the US Small Business Administration from information originally
collected DEMO Dun and Bradstreet.3 Data are available on firm employment,
age, DEMO 4-digit SIC code in which the firm primarily operates, and the
DEMO of plants.4 The dataset includes most manufacturing firms with
employees.
The fact that a firm has data on a file for a particular year DEMO not
necessarily mean that the data apply to that year. Because of reporting and
collecting delays, the data for some firms are older than the data for other
firms. Generally, current data are available for most larger and older firms. In
order to examine firm dynamics over roughly DEMO same phase of the business
cycle and for roughly the same amount of time, observations for which data
were more than two years old in the relevant years were deleted.5
Firm age is reported by year DEMO firms that were six years old or younger in
1976. Firm age is reported for four age intervals for firms that were seven
years DEMO older in 1976: 7-20, 21-45, 46-95, and 96 +. Estimates are reported
separately for young firms and for old firms. For old DEMO, age is measured by
an estimate of the average age of DEMO in the interval.6 Separate estimates are
reported for firms six years old or younger in 1976-hereafter referred to as
young firms-and firms seven years DEMO older-hereafter referred to as old
firms.
There are several other drawbacks to this dataset. First, no data on
mergers or acquisitions are available.7 Second, although firms are identified
by 4-digit SIC codes, such identification is DEMO for diversified (usually
large) firms. Third, as of this time DEMO systematic comparison of the SBDB
data with alternative data sources has been made. But the number of firms
identified by SBDB as operating in DEMO industry differ, sometimes greatly,
from the corresponding Census figures. Given DEMO amount of judgement that
is required to determine the industry classification of a firm, this disparity is
disconcerting but not surprising.8
'See Executive DEMO of the President [1983, pp. 405-428] for further details. Interested
researchers DEMO obtain a copy of the data from the Office of Economic Research of the Small
Business Administration.
4 In the ensuing results the number DEMO plants includes the headquarters of the company.
'Because the variability of DEMO growth is calculated from observations on firm growth for
three two-year periods, observations for which data were more than one year old were deleted for
the variability analysis.
6 The estimate is based on fitting a DEMO distribution to the age data. The estimates are 13
years for firms between 7 and 20, 27 years for firms between 21 and 45, 63 years for firms between
46 and 95, and 103 years DEMO firms older than 95 years.
7This problem afflicts all previous studies of industry dynamics with the exception of the
recent study by Kumar [1985].
DEMO See Evans [1986b] for details.

The SBDB is relied upon here because it DEMO the most comprehensive micro
dataset on firms and the only dataset that contains age information.9 On the
one hand, the results reported here are sufficiently promising to warrant the
development of more refined panel datasets containing DEMO information
as well as age data. On the other hand, given DEMO potential problems with
these data, considerable caution in evaluating the findings DEMO advisable until
they have been replicated on more refined datasets.
A sample of 100 4-digit manufacturing industries was selected randomly
from the population of DEMO 4-digit industries. The 100 industries comprise
22.2 percent of all 450 manufacturing industries. They contribute 24.2 percent
of value added and account for 25.9 DEMO of employment. The ratio of
capital to sales was 0.33 for the sample and 0.35 for all manufacturing
industries. Thus the sample is reasonably DEMO of the manufacturing
sectOr. For a list of the industries included and summary information see
Evans [1986b].
Data on all firms operating in these DEMO industries were extracted from the
SBDB. There were 105 186 firms operating in the sample of industries in
1976. The vast majority of these DEMO have fewer than 20 employees. In order
to reduce the amount of data to be analyzed, only 25 percent of these small
firms were included in the study.'0 Two industries had unusually large
numbers of DEMO Code 2752 had 23 132 firms and SIC Code 3599 had
18 425 firms. In order to reduce the amount of data and in DEMO to prevent
these two industries from dominating the interindustry regression results,
only 25 percent of the firms in these industries were included. These
DEMO together with the ones discussed below reduced the sample to
42 339 firms.
Because the economy was in a severe recession in 1982, growth and
dissolution were examined between 1976 and 1980." Firm growth is defined
as
Growth = Ln [St,/SJI/[t'- t]
where S is employment size, t' is the date to which the 1980 data DEMO, t is the
date to which the 1976 data apply, and t'- t is the number of years between
these two dates. DEMO were excluded if t' was less than 1978 or if t DEMO
less than 1974. Growth can only be calculated for firms that did not dissolve
between 1976 and 1980. About a third of the young DEMO and about 15
percent of the old firms dissolved. The sample available for estimating the
determinants of growth is therefore censored, a problem that will be dealt
'Other generally available datasets, such as Compustat or DEMO Longitudinal Establishment
File of the Census Bureau, do not have age DEMO
" General results are similar when these firms are included. The main difference is that
nonlinearities in the relationships become less pronounced.
" The DEMO are consistent, however, with the results for 1976-1982 reported by Evans
[1987].

with below. DEMO information is available on mergers. Thus, there is no way to
DEMO between internal growth and growth through mergers.
Firm survival was coded as a 1 if a firm was on the dataset in both 1976 DEMO
1980 and as a 0 if a firm was on the dataset in 1976 but not in 1980. The fact
that a firm is DEMO on the dataset in 1980 may mean several things. It may have
failed (i.e. filed for bankruptcy), it may have voluntarily dissolved itself, it may
have merged with another firm, or it may have DEMO acquired by another firm.
It is impossible to distinguish between these possibilities with the SBDB.
Although information on some mergers and acquisitions could be DEMO
from auxiliary datasets, the large number of firms and industries included DEMO
the sample and limited resources precluded such an undertaking. An analysis
of firms in the food manufacturing industries by MacDonald [1986] found
that mergers DEMO acquisitions accounted for approximately 13 percent of all
dissolutions on the SBDB for firms with more than 20 employees. Mergers
and acquisitions are probably DEMO frequent for firms with fewer than 20
employees. Thus, while the DEMO for the survival analysis may be contaminated
with some "false" dissolutions, the degree of contamination is probably not
too severe.'2
In order to estimate the variability of firm growth the growth rate was
calculated DEMO 1976-1978, 1978-1980, and 1980-1982 and the standard
deviation of these three growth rates was calculated. While the variability
of firm growth is estimated DEMO for each firm, there is some hope that
the large number DEMO observations available will enable reasonably precise
estimates of the effect of size and age on this variability. Observations were
deleted if the data were DEMO than a year old in any one of the years. Because
of dissolutions and lack of current data, an estimate of the variability of firm
growth was available for only half of the firms that were DEMO the dataset in
1976. The sample for estimating the determinants of variability is censored, a
problem considered below.

a second-order expansion in the logs, and u is a normally distributed
disturbance term with mean zero and possibly nonconstant variance across
observations.
Growth is observed only DEMO firms that are in the sample in both t' and t.
DEMO probability that a firm will survive from t to t' is DEMO by the
following probit equation. Let I = 1 if a firm survives and 0 if it fails. The
conditional expectation of I given DEMO initial age, size, and number of plants is

where V DEMO be thought of as the value (in excess of opportunity cost) of
remaining in business, et is a normally distributed disturbance with mean zero
and unit variance, F is the cumulative normal distribution function with unit
variance. Equation (2) is a standard probit regression.14 V is DEMO
by a second-order logarithmic expansion.
Equations (1) and (2) form a standard sample-selection model. (See, e.g.,
Amemiya [1984].) It is possible to obtain consistent estimates of the
parameters of the regression functions DEMO and V using maximum likelihood. It
is also possible to obtain consistent estimates of the standard errors of these
parameters in the face of DEMO in the disturbance term of the
growth equation using the procedure suggested by White [1982].'5
The variability of growth equation is represented by

LnStdDev (g) = ln h(Ap, B,)
DEMO w
S,
where StdDev (g) is the estimate of the standard deviation of growth
described in the previous section, h is a regression function which will be
approximated by a second-order expansion in the DEMO, and w is a mean-zero
error term with possibly non-constant variance. DEMO sample upon which (3) is
estimated is censored because, for DEMO variety of reasons including failure, the
variance of firm growth is DEMO observed for part of the sample. In order to
correct for this problem, we can posit a probit equation similar to (2) for the
probability of sample inclusion and estimate (3) and the sample-inclusion
DEMO jointly using maximum likelihood. The sample-inclusion equation
is ad hoc and has no economic interpretation.
IV. STATISTICAL TESTS AND ESTIMATION RESULTS
Second-order logarithmic expansions DEMO the growth function, survival
function, and variability of growth functions were estimated separately for
young firms (for which continuous age information was available) and
old firms (for which age was imputed from categorical age DEMO).
As discussed below, some of the higher-order regressors were dropped
DEMO they were highly insignificant or because multicollinearity hindered
convergence of the maximum-likelihood function.
14See Amemiya [1984] for further discussion. The unit-variance assumption is a DEMO
normalization that arises from the fact that the value function V (DEMO the regression coefficients)
are identified only up to a constant of proportionality.
15A critical assumption here is that the disturbance term of the DEMO equation is homo-
skedastic. If it is not, standard errors and DEMO estimates of both equations are inconsistent.
As an informal test of misspecification I compared the regular and White standard errors for the
probit equation. DEMO fact that they differ by less than one percent suggests that hetero-
skedasticity is not a problem here. A difficult problem that arises in DEMO sort of study is
identifying sample selection from nonlinearities. I [1987] discuss this problem in more detail and
present evidence that suggests that the DEMO relationships between growth, size, and age are not
an artifact of sample selection.

probability of survival increases with age more rapidly for larger firms. DEMO
Firm growth decreases with size and age. In order to characterize the
relationship between firm growth and firm size and age it is useful DEMO look at
the elasticity of ending-period size with respect to beginning-period size and
beginning-period age.'8
The estimates imply at the sample mean that DEMO a ten year period, a 1
percent increase in beginning-period size DEMO to a 0.68 percent increase in
ending-period size. Thus firm growth is considerably less than proportionate
to firm size at the sample mean. The DEMO from Gibrat's Law decreases
with size and age. The negative coefficient on the crossproduct of the number
of plants and firm size indicates DEMO the departure from Gibrat's Law is
greater the more plants operated by the firm. This result is consistent with a
negative relationship between DEMO and size at the plant level: smaller
plants grow more rapidly DEMO larger plants so that firms whose size is split
among more plants grow more rapidly than firms whose size is split among
fewer plants.
DEMO estimates also imply that over a ten year period, a 1 DEMO increase in

preliminary work and these variables DEMO consequently deleted to make the maximum
likelihood estimation easier.

respectively. Then the elasticity of ending-period size with DEMO to beginning period size is

length of time considered.

Thus firm growth is smaller for older firms. The results also show th-at firm
growth increases with the number of plants operated DEMO the firm, although
this growth is smaller for larger firms.
Firm DEMO increases with the number of plants holding firm size and age
constant at the sample mean. A 1 percent increase in the beginning-period
number DEMO plants leads to a 0.6 percent increase in ending-period size. Thus
firm growth is greater when firm size is spread across a larger number DEMO

growth rates. DEMO the correlation coefficient is small and not statistically
significant. This result is consistent with my previous work (Evans [1987],
Evans [1986a], and DEMO and Evans [1986]) and with the study by Hall
[1987].
The DEMO for the variability of growth should be viewed with some
caution. The dependent variable for these regressions is based on just three
firm-growth observations DEMO is therefore measured very imprecisely. More-
over, the dependent variable is DEMO for more than half of the cases. The
delicacy of the correction for sample-selection in these kinds of models should
make us circumspect in DEMO the results recorded below too much weight.
The variability of firm growth decreases with firm age.19 A 1 percent
increase in firm age leads DEMO a 0.13 percent decrease in the standard deviation
of firm growth. For single-plant firms-most of the firms in our sample of
young firms-there is DEMO evidence that firm growth depends upon firm size:
the coefficients on the size variables are small and not statistically significant.
For multiple-plant firms DEMO is evidence that the variability of firm growth
decreases with firm size and that the rate of decrease is greater for firms with
more DEMO
Table IV reports the results for old firms. Table V summarizes the relevant
partial derivatives. Results are generally similar to those for young firms,DEMO
although there is some evidence that the relationships deteriorate for very old
firms. A 1 percent change in firm size leads to a 6 DEMO increase in the
probability of firm survival and a 1 percent increase in firm age leads to a 2
percent increase in the probability DEMO firm survival. The probability of
survival decreases with firm size for very old firms (about 21 percent of the
sample).21
Firm growth is roughly independent of age at the sample mean. Firm
growth decreases with DEMO age for younger firms (about 75 percent of the
sample of DEMO firms) but then eventually increases with firm age for older firms
(about 25 percent of the sample of old firms). Firm growth DEMO with firm
size at the sample mean and for almost all of the sample. Over a ten year
period, a 1 percent increase in beginning-period firm size leads to a 0.85
percent increase in ending-period size DEMO the sample mean. The departure
from Gibrat's Law decreases with size and with age and increases with the
number of plants. As with DEMO firms, firm growth increases with the
number of plants. A 1 DEMO increase in the initial number of plants leads to
a 1.18 percent increase in ending-period size over a ten year period.
19I was unable DEMO obtain convergence when the quadratic terms in age and plants were
included.
20 Previous studies have found that the variability of firm growth decreases DEMO firm size.
Because these studies did not consider age or the number of plants-both of which are positively
correlated with firm size-the results found DEMO are consistent with these studies. See Mansfield
[1962] and Hymer and Pashigian [1962].
21 While this finding might reflect senescence of firms, it might also reflect an increased
probability of acquisition.

The same caveat as above applies to the variability of growth equation.
The variability of firm growth decreases with firm DEMO At the sample mean a
1 percent increase in firm age leads to a 0.19 percent decrease in the standard
deviation of firm growth. DEMO variability of firm growth increases slightly
with firm size. A 1 percent increase in firm size leads to a 0.04 percent increase
in the DEMO deviation of growth at the sample mean. The rate of increase
is smaller the larger the number of plants operated by the firm. This DEMO is
not consistent with previous studies which have found that firm growth
decreases with firm size. It is also not consistent with the separate DEMO
results reported below.
In order to summarize the relationships for each industry first-order
logarithmic expansions of the growth, survival, and variability of growth
DEMO were considered.22 No corrections were made for sample selection.
Thus the results for variability of firm growth should be viewed with caution.
The probability DEMO survival results are based on ordinary least squares
estimates of the linear probability model. The significance tests are based on a
five percent level DEMO the regression standard errors.23
Table VI summarizes the results for size and age. Results at the industry
level are imprecisely estimated for most industries. DEMO lack of precision may
reflect the poor quality of the data, DEMO industry misclassification, or the

V. CONCLUSIONS
The first key finding of this study is that firm age is an important determinant
of firm DEMO The probability of firm failure, firm growth, and the
variability of firm growth decrease as firms age. The importance of age is
consistent DEMO the predictions of the learning model developed by Jovanovic
[1982].24
The second key finding is that firm growth decreases at a diminishing rate
with DEMO size even after controlling for the selection of firms out of the
sample. Gibrat's Law fails. The departures from Gibrat's Law are DEMO for
small firms but become less severe for larger firms. This pattern is broadly
consistent with previous studies which tend to show severe departures DEMO
Gibrat's Law for small firms-e.g. Mansfield [1962]-and no or less severe
departures for large firms-e.g. Hymer and Pashigian [1962], Hall [1987],
Kumar [1985], and myself [1986a].
24Note, however, that these relationships appear to break down for very old firms in the
interindustry results. Jovanovic's DEMO predicts that the probability of firm survival increases
with size but the survival-age relationship is ambiguous.

DAVID S. EVANS
The importance of these departures from Gibrat's DEMO depends upon the
use to which this Law is put. Gibrat's Law is not an unreasonable assumption
for the very large firms which DEMO, at any point in time, contribute most
industrial output. The departures from Gibrat's Law found by studies using
recent data are around DEMO percent over a ten-year period.25
A theory that seeks to explain short-run changes in the growth and size
distribution of the largest firms in DEMO economy may not go too wrong by
maintaining Gibrat's Law. But many of our industrial organization theories
are meant to apply to the DEMO size distribution of firms in narrowly
defined industries, not to interindustry DEMO of large firms. Gibrat's Law is
not a reasonable assumption for the smaller firms which account for the vast
majority of firms in DEMO industries and from which the large firms of the
future will come.
The data behind these findings are crude. Replication of these results with
DEMO refined datasets is crucial before they are accepted. Nevertheless, this
study (along with related work by Evans [1987] and Brock and Evans [1986]
DEMO yield similar results) provides a starting point for further theoretical and
DEMO work on industry dynamics. For theoretical work, it suggests that
theories DEMO incorporate age hold some promise. It also indicates caution in
maintaining Gibrat's Law for theories, such as Lucas [1978], that are meant
DEMO apply to the complete size distribution of firms. For empirical work, DEMO
suggests the importance of age as a factor in determining industry dynamics.
Longitudinal datasets containing experience information on firms (and on
the managers and entrepreneurs associated with the firms) should be de-
veloped. Such datasets would help researchers disentangle the effects of
alternative forms of learning from each DEMO and from the effects of capital
accumulation.

25 Kumar [1985] using net assets finds that the departure DEMO a 10-year period is about 10
percent based on United Kingdom data for 1960-1976. See Kumar [1985, Table II and note 10,
p. 333]. Using book value of assets, I [1986a, Table 4) also find that the departure is about 10
percent based on Fortune 500 DEMO for the United States for 1958-1984. Hall [1987] using
employment finds that the departure is also about 10 percent over a 10-year period based DEMO
Compustat data for the United States for 1976-1983. Studies based on data for the late 1940s
and 1950s show a positive relationship between growth DEMO size while studies based on pre-1940
data typically show a negative relationship. See Hymer and Pashigian [1962], Singh and
Whittington [1975], and the DEMO in Prais [1975, Table D.2, p. 205]. None of these studies,
with the exception of Hall [1987] and myself, tests for nonlinearities in the growth-size
relationship. The differing estimates may depend partly on having DEMO size ranges in the
samples.
