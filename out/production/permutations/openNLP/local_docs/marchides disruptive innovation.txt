Disruptive Innovation: In Need of Better Theory
Constantinos Markides

DEMO (1997) original theory focused on
disruptive technologies. Over time, the DEMO
theory has been used to explain all kinds of
disruptive innovations. This is a mistake. Different
kinds of innovations have different competitive effects
and DEMO different kinds of markets. They should
be treated as distinct phenomena. This article sum-
marizes what the academic literature has to say about
two DEMO types of disruptive innovations—namely,
business-model innovations and radical (new-to-the-
world) product innovations. It argues that even
though they share many similarities to DEMO Chris-
tensen calls disruptive innovations, they are still
different phenomena: they create different kinds of
markets, pose radically different challenges for estab-
lished ﬁrms, and have radically different implications
for managers. It is only when the topic of disruptive
innovation is broken down into these ﬁner categories
DEMO progress can be made.
In a recent survey of the literature, DEMO (2004)
examined the theory behind disruptive technological
innovation and identiﬁed DEMO number of issues that
require further and deeper exploration. One of these
issues is the actual definition of disruptive innovation.
It appears that despite DEMO widespread use of the term
by both managers and academics, there DEMO still a rather
unclear understanding of what constitutes disruptive
innovation.
In its original formulation, Christensen (1997)
focused primarily on technological innovation and
DEMO how new technologies came to surpass
seemingly superior technologies in a market. Over

time, Christensen widened the application of the term
to include not only technologies but also products and
business models. DEMO example, Christensen and
Raynor (2003) list as disruptive innovations such DEMO
parate things as discount department stores; low-
price, point-to-point airlines; DEMO, mass-market
products such as power tools, copiers, and motorcy-
cles; and online businesses such as bookselling, edu-
cation, brokerage, and travel agents.
Although I agree that all of these innovations are
disruptive to DEMO, treating them all as one and
the same has actually confused DEMO considerably.
A disruptive technological innovation is a fundamen-
tally different phenomenon from a disruptive busi-
ness-model innovation as well as a disruptive product
innovation: These innovations arise in different ways,
have different competitive effects, and require differ-
ent responses from incumbents. Lumping all types of
disruptive innovations DEMO one category simply mixes
apples with oranges, which has serious implications
DEMO how we study disruptive innovations in the future
(Henderson and Clark, 1990).
To appreciate this point, this article summarizes
what the academic literature has to say about two
specific types of disruptive innovations—namely, busi-
ness-model innovations and radical product innova-
tions—and then demonstrates that even though DEMO
are disruptive innovations, they nevertheless pose rad-
ically different challenges for DEMO ﬁrms and
have radically different implications for managers.
Business-Model Innovation
One type of innovation that tends to be disruptive to
established competitors is business-model DEMO
In earlier work (Markides, 1997, 1998), I called this
DEMO of innovation strategic innovation, which is a
confusing term. Business-model innovation DEMO

For example, by selling its tickets on the Internet just
like its low-cost competitors, British Airways risks
alienating its existing distributors, the travel agents.
In the same way, if Unilever moves aggressively DEMO
private label, it risks damaging its existing brands and
diluting the DEMO strong culture for innova-
tion and differentiation. The existence of such trade-
offs and conﬂicts means that a company trying to
compete in both DEMO simultaneously risks paying
a huge straddling cost and degrading the value of its
existing activities (Porter, 1996). The task is obviously
not DEMO, but it is certainly difﬁcult. This logic
led Porter (1980) DEMO propose more than 20 years ago
that a company could ﬁnd itself stuck in the middle if
it tried to compete with both low-cost DEMO differentia-
tion strategies.
Given that (1) new business models attract different
customers from those that established companies fo-
cus on; and (2) require different and conﬂicting value-
chains from the ones established companies currently
DEMO, it should come as no surprise that incumbent
ﬁrms will, initially, have little incentive to adopt them
or to respond to them.
However, over time, the new business models im-
prove to such an DEMO that they are able to deliver
performance that is sufﬁcient in the old attributes es-
tablished competitors emphasize and superior in the
new attributes. DEMO this point, even established cus-
tomers begin to ﬁnd the new DEMO interesting and begin
to switch. Inevitably, the growth of the disruptive DEMO
novation attracts the attention of established players.
As more customers—both existing and new ones—
embrace the new business model, the new business
receives increasing attention from both the media and
the established players. At a certain DEMO, established
players cannot afford to ignore this new way of doing
DEMO anymore, and they therefore begin to con-
sider ways to respond DEMO it.
Herein lies the dilemma for established ﬁrms: these
new ways DEMO competing conﬂict with existing ways. It
is extremely difﬁcult to make the two coexist in the
same organization—hence the reason why these in-
novations DEMO considered disruptive to the established
ﬁrm.
Business-Model Innovations Are Different
from Technological Innovations
It should be obvious from the discussion so far that
business-model DEMO in particular the
process by which they emerge and grow—share
many similarities with disruptive technological inno-
vations, which Christensen’s (1997) original work
examined. The similarities between the two have led
some researchers to treat the DEMO types of innovation
as one and the same—this is a mistake.
Over the past 10 years, several researchers have
explored business-model innovation in depth (e.g.,
Charitou, 2001; Gilbert and Bower, 2002; Hamel,
2000; Kim and Mauborgne, 1997; Markides, 1997,
1998; Slywotzky, 1996). As a result, we now know a
lot about DEMO kind of innovation, most of which seems
to contradict the accepted DEMO on disruptive
innovation.
One of the key ﬁndings of Christensen’s work is
that disruptive technological innovations eventually
grow to dominate the market. Christensen and
DEMO (2003, p. 69) make this point forcefully by
arguing that DEMO . . disruption is a process and not an
event . . . it might take decades for the forces to work
their way DEMO an industry but [they] are always at
work.’’ Similarly, Danneels (2004, p. 247) summarized
the existing theory on disruptive innovation by point-
DEMO out that ‘‘. . . disruptive technologies tend to be
associated with the replacement of incumbents by en-
trants.’’ If correct, such a fact carries a serious impli-
cation for incumbent ﬁrm: The only way to respond to
the disruption is to accept it and then ﬁnd ways DEMO
exploit it. Christensen and Raynor (2003) suggested
that established companies could exploit a disruption
only by creating a separate unit.
The available literature DEMO business-model innova-
tion does not support such an extreme position. What
often happens in the case of a business-model inno-
vation is that the DEMO way of competing in the busi-
ness grows—usually quickly—to a certain percent of
the market but fails to completely overtake the tradi-
tional way DEMO competing. For example, Internet bank-
ing and Internet brokerage have grown DEMO in the
last ﬁve years but have captured only 10–20% of the
market. Similarly, budget, no-frills ﬂying as a way of
business has DEMO phenomenally since 1995 but has
captured no more than 20% of the total market. In
market after market, new ways of competing grow to
a respectable size but never really replace the old
ways. Nor are DEMO innovations expected to grow in
the future to 100% of their markets.
Given such an outcome, then some of the accepted
wisdoms on disruptive innovation need to be modi-
ﬁed. First, new business models are not necessarily
superior to the ones established companies employ,
22 J PROD INNOV MANAG
2006;23:19–25
a fact implying that DEMO is not necessarily an optimal
strategy for an established company to abandon its
existing business model in favor of something new or
to grow DEMO new model alongside its existing business
model. The decision should be based on a careful cost-
beneﬁt analysis and would depend on the specific DEMO
cumstances of the ﬁrm as well as the nature of the
innovation.
In his article in this issue, Christensen takes excep-
tion to this by arguing, ‘‘. . . I had simply assumed that
the objective function of management should be to
maximize shareholder value. If survival is DEMO the
objective function, then quite possibly inaction is a
good course DEMO action.’’ In other words, if a ﬁrm
chooses not to imitate DEMO disruption or chooses to
destroy it, then it must be doing DEMO to survive rather
than to maximize shareholder value. This is an
interesting point, but no theoretical reason or empir-
ical evidence exists to suggest that any action
other than imitation is value destroying. In fact,
DEMO and Markides (2003) demonstrated that
in deciding how to respond to disruptive business-
model innovations, incumbent ﬁrms have several
options at their disposal. Most of these, including
the ‘‘disrupt-the-disruptor’’ strategy that companies
like Swatch have adopted, are indeed value en-
hancing.
The truth of the matter is that established compa-
nies would simply ﬁnd most of these innovations
unattractive—and DEMO for the reasons articulated in
Christensen (1997), though they undoubtedly DEMO a
role. Rather, most of these business-model innovations
simply do not DEMO economic sense for established
companies. In its efforts to grow, the DEMO ﬁrm
has many other alternatives to consider, including
investing its limited DEMO in adjacent markets or
taking its existing business model internationally.
Given its other growth options—and given its limit-
ed resources—the decision to invest in DEMO disruption
may rank low on its priority list.
The academic literature suggests three exceptions
to this generalization. Specifically, established ﬁrms
would, on average, ﬁnd it advantageous to create dis-
ruptive business-model innovations in the following
DEMO:
(1) When they enter a new market where entrenched
competitors have ﬁrst-mover advantages (e.g.,
Canon entering the copier market). In such a
case, the new entrant must attack by breaking
the rules (Markides, 1997; Porter, 1985).
C. MARKIDES
(2) When DEMO current strategy or business model
is clearly inappropriate and the ﬁrm is facing
a crisis (e.g., Kresge introducing the discount
retail concept in DEMO 1960s and renaming itself
K-Mart)
(3) When they are attempting to scale up a new-to-
the-world product to make it attractive to DEMO
mass market (Markides and Geroski, 2005) (This
situation is discussed in the next section.)
A second sacred cow regarding disruptive innova-
DEMO is that the best way for an established company
to adopt and to exploit such innovations is through a
separate unit. Presumably, this is the best way to
overcome the inherent conﬂicts between the estab-
lished DEMO and the innovation. Yet, as argued
elsewhere (Markides and Charitou, DEMO), established
companies could exploit disruptive strategic innova-
tions in a number of ways, and they do not necessarily
have to use a separate unit to do so.
Finally, even if the disruptive innovation is not su-
perior to the established business model, incumbents
need to ﬁnd a way to respond to it. However, response
does not necessarily mean that they have to adopt it.
They could respond to the innovation not DEMO adopting
it but by investing in their existing business to make
the traditional way of competing even more compet-
itive relative to the new DEMO of competing. Incum-
bents even have the option of counterattacking the
innovators by trying to disrupt the disruptors. The
different response options available to DEMO
ﬁrms were explored in Charitou and Markides (2003).
Radical Product DEMO
A second type of innovation that tends to be disrup-
tive to the established competitors is radical innova-
tion, which creates new-to-the-world products (DEMO,
the car, television, personal computers, VCRs, mobile
phones). Radical innovations are disruptive to con-
sumers because they introduce products and DEMO
propositions that disturb prevailing consumer habits
and behaviors in a major way. They are disruptive
to producers because the markets they create under-
mine DEMO competences and complementary assets on
which existing competitors have built their success.
Because they are disruptive to both consumers and
producers, these innovations are rarely driven by
demand. Instead, they result from a supply–push
process originating from those responsible for

23
developing new technologies (Markides and Geroski,
2005).
The available academic evidence (e.g. Klepper and
Simons, 2000; Utterback, DEMO) shows that markets
emerging as a result of supply–push processes share
DEMO characteristics:
Despite enormous technological and product un-
 certainty, newly DEMO markets are invaded by
hordes of new entrants, sometimes numbering in
DEMO hundreds. Amazingly, this surge in ﬁrm popu-
lation happens well before DEMO new market starts
growing.
 Not only is the new market ﬂooded with hundreds
of new entrants, but product variety in the young
market also surges to amazingly high levels. In
fact, the rate of innovation at the start of a mar-
ket’s life is the highest this DEMO will ever see.
 Eventually, the wave of entry subsides and DEMO turn
is followed by what is sometimes a sharp, sudden,
DEMO very sizeable shakeout leading to the death of
most of the early pioneers. The shakeout is asso-
ciated with the emergence of a dominant DEMO in
the market, which signals the beginning of growth
in the DEMO
 All of this takes a long time to unfold. Thus, DEMO
structure of new markets remains remarkably
ﬂuid throughout most of the early years, and
many more ﬁrms come and go than are left oper-
ating in the market when its structure ﬁnally settles
down.
The end DEMO of this is that the early pioneers that
create these new-to-the-world markets are very rarely
the ones that scale them up from little niches DEMO big,
mass markets. The companies that eventually scale up
new markets jump into the market right before the
dominant design emerges. But jumping DEMO at the right
time is not enough to conquer the market. The even-
tual winners not only time their entry into the market
to DEMO, but they also undertake a series of ac-
tions that grows DEMO market from a niche into a mass
market. Typically, this involves DEMO heavy invest-
ments in exploiting scale economies, traveling down
learning curves, developing strong brands, and control-
ling the channels of distribution to the mass market.
One of the strategies these latecomers use to scale
up DEMO market and steal it away from the early pioneers
is similar to the process disruptive innovators use
to upset established competitors (as described by
Christensen, 1997). In particular, whereas early pio-
neers emphasize the DEMO attributes of the prod-
uct, latecomers shift the basis of competition DEMO
from technical performance to other product at-
tributes such as quality and price by cutting the price
of the product to a mass-market level DEMO simulta-
neously improving the quality of the product to make
it acceptable to the average consumer. All of a sud-
den, the product becomes attractive to the mass mar-
ket, and rapid growth follows.
The irony is that in many cases, a late entrant cap-
tures the market even when their product is not as
good as the products of DEMO early pioneers. This
happens for two reasons. First, as a result DEMO the ef-
forts of the early pioneers, the new product improves
DEMO performance to levels that either are good enough
or even surpass customer needs. At that stage, any
additional investments to improve the performance
of the product further are not really necessary. But
the early pioneers cannot DEMO themselves: Their
engineering cultures go to work, and sure enough,
more and more money goes into research and
development (R&D) DEMO improve the product further
and to add to its functionality. All of this occurs
even with the full realization that their customers do
not DEMO will they ever use—the added func-
tionality.
Product overengineering is linked to a second
change taking place: The extra investments and in-
cremental additions to the product’s performance do
not come for free. The rising costs DEMO to rising pric-
es. The high price, in turn, limits the attraction of the
product to a small segment made up of technology
DEMO and early adopters.
The combination of these two factors gives late-
comers their chance to move in and steal the market
away. They know DEMO all they have to do is to pro-
duce a product good enough in performance but
cheaper than what is on the market now. DEMO prod-
uct may not be as good as the product of the pioneers,
but this does not really matter. The early adopters are
DEMO attracted to these inferior products, but the aver-
age consumer is. DEMO them, this product is good
enough and cheap. Over time, the consolidators may
improve the performance of their product to such an
extent DEMO even the technically astute customers begin
to ﬁnd them attractive—and so switch. However, this
is not absolutely necessary. As long as they control the
mass market, the consolidators are happy to leave a
few little niches for other competitors to feed on.
Their overriding objective is to make DEMO product that is
not necessarily the best—just one good enough in
performance and superior in price.

Radical Product Innovations Are DEMO
from Technological Innovations
Note again the similarities of this scaling-up process
to the disruptive innovation process Christensen
(1997) described. In fact, many of the examples of
disruptive innovations that Christensen and Raynor
(2003) use DEMO their book (e.g., Black and Decker power
tools, Honda motorcycles, Canon copiers, Seiko
watches) are really examples of companies scaling
up DEMO niche market into a mass market. Therefore, if
established companies want DEMO achieve this kind of
disruptive innovation, the way to do it DEMO not as de-
scribed in Christensen and Raynor (2003).
Markides DEMO Geroski (2005) described how estab-
lished companies could exploit such disruptive
product innovations. Their thesis is that established
companies should not even attempt DEMO create such in-
novations but should leave the task of creating these
kinds of markets to small, start-up ﬁrms that have the
requisite skills and attitudes to succeed at this game.
Established ﬁrms should, instead, DEMO on
what they are good at—consolidating young markets
into big, mass DEMO
Practically speaking, what this means is that in-
stead of spending DEMO resources and managerial
talent at growing new radical businesses inside,
established companies should aim to create, sustain,
and nurture a network of feeder ﬁrms—of young,
entrepreneurial ﬁrms busy colonizing new niches.
Through its DEMO development function, the
established company could serve as a venture capital-
DEMO to these feeder ﬁrms. Alternatively, it could devel-
op formal strategic DEMO with them or even
could maintain minority equity stakes in them.
Then, when it is time to consolidate the market, it
could build DEMO new mass-market business on the
platform these feeder ﬁrms have provided. Since the
younger ﬁrms do not have the resources, power,
marketing, DEMO distribution to scale up their crea-
tions, they should, in principle, be happy to subcon-
tract this activity to the bigger ﬁrms, DEMO to a fair
division of the spoils.
This might strike some people as too radical of an
idea, but it is in fact a widely accepted business model
in industries where companies live and die on DEMO
ability to continuously bring creative new products to
the market—industries such as music and book pub-
lishing, Hollywood movies, theater plays, and art
galleries. If this organization of work functions well
in such creative industries, should we not at least
C. MARKIDES
attempt to import it into DEMO industries that aspire
to become more creative?
Again, the point DEMO not to suggest that this is a risk-
free or trouble-free strategy for big companies to cre-
ate disruptive new markets. Rather, I simply highlight
how radically different this suggestion is from what is
found in DEMO disruptive innovation literature (e.g.,
Christensen and Raynor, 2003). What big established
companies need to do to achieve this kind of disrup-
DEMO innovation (i.e., radical product innovation) is
fundamentally different from what DEMO have to do to
achieve either business-model innovation or techno-
logical innovation.
In Need of Finer Categories
The basic thesis of this article is DEMO not all disruptive
innovations are the same. In particular, I propose
DEMO technological, business-model, and new-to-the-
world product innovations should be treated as dis-
tinct phenomena. All three types of innovation may
follow a similar DEMO to invade existing markets
and may have equally disruptive effects on incumbent
ﬁrms, but at the end of the day they produce different
kinds of markets and have different managerial im-
plications. It is only when DEMO topic of disruptive in-
novation is broken down into these ﬁner categories
that progress can be made.
