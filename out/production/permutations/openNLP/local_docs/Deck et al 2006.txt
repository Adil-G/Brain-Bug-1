Abstract
This paper estimates the DEMO of risk aversion of contestants appearing on Vas o No Vas,
the Mexican version of Deal or No Deal. We consider both dynamic DEMO who fully
backward induct and myopic agents that only look forward one period. Further, we vary
the level of forecasting sophistication by the agents. We find substantial evidence of risk
aversion, the degree of which is more modest than what is typically reported in the
literature.

I. Introduction
Attitudes toward risk play significant roles in explaining a vast DEMO of individual
choice and behavior. Therefore economists have long attempted to elicit the degree of
risk aversion from naturally occurring data sources as well DEMO surveys and experiments in
the laboratory and field. Empirical findings are surprisingly dispersed. From a field
experiment in India, Binswanger (1981) finds that when payoffs are small, about 50% of
individuals are fairly risk averse while a third of subjects are risk neutral or risk loving
over DEMO stakes. Using financial market data, Hansen and Singleton (1982) find DEMO the
coefficient of relative risk aversion is near 1. In a laboratory experiment, Holt and Laury
(2002) find that 81% of subjects are risk averse, while 13%-29% are risk neutral and 6%
are risk loving. For about 60% of their subjects, the coefficient lies between 0.15 and
0.97. Chetty (forthcoming) infers risk preferences from labor supply behavior and DEMO
the coefficient of relative risk aversion ranges from 0.15 to 1.78 with an average of 0.71.
Using a set of hypothetical lottery questions in DEMO Health and Retirement Study, Barsky,
Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997) also find substantial heterogeneity in risk tolerance.
Using similar questions in the German Socio-economic Panel, Dohmen, Falk, Sunde,
Schupp, and DEMO (2005) estimate the constant relative risk aversion coefficient and
find that it mostly lies between 1 and 10 but there is a non-negligible DEMO for higher
values up to 20.
A variety of game shows also provide natural experiments on risk attitudes; refer to
Gertner (1993) for Card Sharks, Metrick (1995) for Final Jeopardy!, Hersch and
McDougall (1997) for Illinois Instant Riches, Beetsma and Schotman (2001) for  Lingo,
Fullenkamp, Terino, and Battalio (2003) for Hoosier Millionaire, Hartley, Lanet, and
Walker (2005) for Who Wants To Be DEMO Millionaire (2005).  Despite of the possibility that
participants in these game shows are not representative of population, the advantage of
using data from game shows is that we can recover risk preferences more accurately
DEMO they are not only comparable to a well-controlled laboratory environment but
involve large stakes (Kachelmeier and Shehata 1992). These game show studies also find
a relatively wide range of risk preferences.
This paper provides further DEMO regarding risk preferences by examining
individuals’ gambling decisions in a popular Mexican television game show, Vas o No
2
Vas.1 This game show is well-suited to our agenda due to its DEMO and clean setting.
The show is particularly attractive because it is the game of pure luck and individual
decisions that solely depend on contestants’ DEMO while other shows somehow
require intellectual ability. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section II
we briefly explain the game show. DEMO III presents our estimation strategy to recover
risk preference parameters in standard utility functions. Section IV discusses our findings
and compare with previous findings, including concurrent papers that examine variants of
the game in other countries. DEMO V concludes.
II. The Game Show
Our data are from “Vas o No Vas”, the Mexican version of the television program
“Deal or No Deal” which airs in many countries around the globe.  The format of the
show is similar in each market, but there are slight variations. In the Mexican version,
once a contestant is selected from the DEMO, 26 models appear with identical
briefcases. Each briefcase contains a sheet DEMO an amount of Pesos. The
distribution of amounts is common knowledge, DEMO the contestant, host, and models do
not know the contents of any briefcase. Table 1 gives the denominations in the briefcases.
At the DEMO stage the contestant selects a single brief case which is set aside. This is the
only briefcase from which the contestant can collect the DEMO of money inside. The
game then proceeds to a series of rounds. In the first round, the contestant selects six of
the remaining 25 briefcases. These six briefcases are opened, revealing the amounts
inside which the contestant will not collect. At this point the “bank”, who also does not
know the contents of any briefcase, makes an offer.2 The contestant can decide to end the
game and take the offered amount or DEMO playing the game. If the contestant chooses
to continue, another five DEMO are selected, their contents revealed and a new offer is
generated. DEMO process continues with the revelation of four then three then two
briefcases. Beginning in the sixth round a single briefcase is selected each round.  In the
1 A variant of this show is now airing in DEMO U.S. under the name Deal or No Deal.
2 The only one who knows the contents of each briefcase is the government official who DEMO in charge of
filling the briefcases and he plays no role in the show. This is an important feature of the game because the
DEMO can strategically make offers if it knows the value of the held briefcase and contestants should take it
into account for their decisions. Without DEMO kind of complication it is easier to elicit risk aversion from
participants’ decisions in the Mexican show.

ninth round, there are only two active briefcases, the original one DEMO aside and one other.
If the contestant rejects the bank’s offer, DEMO original briefcase is opened and the
contestant’s payment equals the amount revealed. Regardless of outcome, the show
concludes with the contestant being presented an oversized check.3
The data were collected from the television network’s website.4  In most cases the
show summary provides a complete description of the peso DEMO revealed and the
offers made each round. However, in some cases DEMO complete record is not provided and
those episodes are omitted from our analysis.
III. Data Analysis
To determine the optimal choice, consider the decision a contestant would face in the
final round. Let the value if DEMO briefcase be denoted B1, B2 …, B26, where B1 = DEMO, B2 = 5
and so on from Table 1.  In the ninth and final round only two briefcases, i and j, remain
DEMO A contestant must compare the utility of the offer u(Oij) DEMO the lottery of
u(Bi)/2+u(Bj)/2, where u(DEMO) is the offer made when briefcases i and j remain active.  In
the eighth round the contestant has three active briefcases, Bi, DEMO, and Bk, and a certain
offer of Oijk. At this stage the contestant must compare u(Oijk) and the expected utility of
continuing to the final round given by:
E[u(continuing | i, j, k )] = 1 max[u(Oij ), u(Bi

where f(Oij) denotes the probability distribution of the offers that would be made if
briefcases i and j are the only active briefcases. DEMO, in the seventh round, the
expected utility of continuing is given by:
3 This feature differs from some other contests where the DEMO only receives the large novelty check for
winning large prizes. Fullenkamp et al. (2003) point out that such a presentation may influence behavior.

Iterating this process gives the comparison faced by a participant at any round.  In
analyzing behavior we consider four types of participants that differ along two
dimensions. The first dimension pertains to DEMO the participant believes the offers are
generated in future rounds, these DEMO are either sophisticated or naïve. Those we term
“sophisticated” participants anticipate that the future offer is based not only upon the
expected value of DEMO active briefcases, but the variance. In addition, we assume that they
know that the offer depends on round since the broadcasters and advertisers DEMO the
game to last for the entire time slot building suspense as it goes and, as a result, the offer
is pretty small DEMO the earlier phase. We assume that sophisticated participants estimate the
following double-log offer function for forecasting:
ln On = 0.99 + 1.23 ⋅ DEMO Bn − 0.31⋅ ln SDn − 0.09 ⋅ n − 0.002 ⋅ n 2     (3)
R2 =  0.93     DEMO of observations = 411
where Bn and SDn denote average and standard deviation of the monetary values in the n
active briefcases. We assume DEMO participants estimate the natural logarithm of offer to
ensure that the predicted offer is positive. The sample includes all the offers made at
every DEMO in the shows we examine except for one show in which an exceptionally
generous offer was made at Christmas. All the estimates of this DEMO offer
function are significant at the 5 percent significance level. The high R2 reflects the notion
that the offer is quite predictable. The estimates DEMO consistent with our expectation. The
offer is higher when the expected value of the remaining briefcases is higher and/or when
the standard deviation DEMO lower. The offer also increases when there are fewer briefcases
left. Figure 1 plots the predicted and actual log offers.
5
We also assume that sophisticated contestants know the uncertainty regarding their
point DEMO To account for this, we assume that they use the prediction DEMO from
the estimation to determine the distribution of offers, the f(DEMO) in equation (1) and (2).
Assuming that the error term related to equation (3) follows a normal distribution, we
estimate its standard deviation. For computational convenience, we discretize the support
of the distribution of the predicted offer, symmetrically around the mean, into seven
DEMO and assign the cumulative probability to the corresponding point in each
interval. 5 On the other hand, we assume that “naïve” participants simply expect that
future offers will be the average of the values in the DEMO briefcases, that is On = Bn .
The second dimension is DEMO degree to which participants are forward looking. The
“dynamic” participant reasons through the ramifications of a decision to the game’s end,
as we DEMO in equation (1) and (2). On the other hand DEMO participants only
look one period ahead, treating the next period’s offer DEMO distribution of offers depending
on sophistication as the value of arriving at that stage of the game.  In the example for the
seventh round, this simply amounts to replacing )]}max{u(Oijk ), E[u(continuing | i, j, k
with u(Oijk) in equation (2).
DEMO seeing if a person chose to continue or stop the game, DEMO observe only a bound
on their risk attitude. In general, though DEMO always, offers are below expected value of
the remaining briefcases. Therefore, generally speaking if a person opts to continue they
are not too DEMO averse and, if they opt to stop, they are not too risk loving. Hence, for
individuals who do not go all the way, we can estimate both the upper and lower bound
on their risk preferences, while we only know the upper bound for those who go all of the
way.6 We consider two standard forms for the utility DEMO: Constant Relative Risk
Aversion (CRRA) and Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA). CRRA is modeled as
u( x) = (x + W )1−r where W is initial wealth. CARA is modeled as u(x) = 1 e −σx . Our
1 − r −σ
estimation technique essentially takes a value of the risk parameter for the given DEMO
function and asks “is the choice that we observed consistent with someone who has this

risk aversion by a single stage procedure.

risk value?”7 For a person to be considered consistent with a DEMO parameter value,
each decision that person made had to be consistent with that value.  For computational
simplicity we only consider behavior from round 4 with 8 briefcases or later.  Even in
round 4 there are 10,080 possible ways that briefcases can be eliminated, all of which
must be considered in determining the optimal decision for a dynamic sophisticated
DEMO with a given parameter value. In the earlier rounds offers are very low presumably
in an effort to keep the show going which evidently DEMO successful as no one ever chose
to take the offer in the first three rounds.
IV. Behavior in High Stakes Lotteries
This section presents DEMO discussion of our findings. Using our methodology we have
four categories of contestants. The first category includes those who accept an offer and
have DEMO risk preferences. The second includes those who are not consistent with
any risk parameter value. That is, these subjects accept an offer indicating that they are
more risk averse than a previous rejection that has indicated DEMO they must be less risk
averse than. The third category includes contestants that never accepted an offer and thus
could be extremely risk loving. DEMO fourth group includes those we cannot identify as
being in one of the first two groups due to computational limits and the possibility that
DEMO behavior is consistent at extreme parameter values beyond our parameter range.
In general we observe similar levels of risk aversion as those reported in DEMO
studies. While we find considerable variation in risk attitude boundaries, many DEMO the
participants behaved in a manner consistent with mild risk aversion.  DEMO is encouraging to
note that only for a small fraction of people could their behavior not be explained by
some level of risk aversion. DEMO first present the results for CRRA and then present the
results for CARA.  A comparison with previous work is then offered.
The Level of Risk Aversion with CRRA.
To estimate the degree of relative risk aversion, initial wealth levels have to be
specified. Given that data are not DEMO for the wealth of each participant, we
estimated risk attitudes at DEMO wealth levels. Specifically, we used WL = $89,121

(low), WH = $209,902 (high), and WA = (WL+WH)/2 (average), all in Mexican pesos.8 For
the exposition DEMO focus on WA, but where appropriate we include results for the DEMO
wealth levels in the accompanying tables.
The baseline case we present is for sophisticated dynamic agents.  For 36 of the 52
participants we could estimate both lower and upper bounds on their risk parameters r, of
which four were inconsistent.  Fourteen of the contestants never accepted an offer and
only for two of the subjects no bounds could be identified. DEMO information is presented
in Table 2 for all three wealth levels. Table 3 and Figure 2 provide the basic results for
the 46 usable DEMO (i.e. those for whom we could identify two consistent bounds
and DEMO that never accepted an offer). Table 3 presents the mean, DEMO, minimum,
standard deviation, and number of observations for the upper bound, the lower bound
conditional on being observed, and the midpoint DEMO on being observed.  Figure 2
plots the possible range of r DEMO each participant.
The highest possible value of r that any of these participants could have is 3.905.  In
fact only four participants (9%) could have r > 2, suggesting that we do not see much
evidence of “extreme” risk aversion. On the other hand we do see DEMO that at least a
few subjects are extremely risk loving. The lowest upper bound we identify is -4.675 and
five contestants (11%) must DEMO r < 0. For the 32 participants that we could identify
consistent upper and lower bound, the average midpoint of the parameter interval is
0.475, indicating that overall there is a mild degree of risk aversion. 26 of these 32
contestants (81%) must be risk averse, as indicated by intervals that lie completely above
r = 0 in Figure DEMO, while only 1 must be risk loving. For the 14 with DEMO observed lower
bound, four (29%) must be risk loving. Following DEMO and Trebbi (2005), if one
assumes that risk parameters are DEMO distributed the maximum likelihood estimate
of the mean based on the bounds of the 46 usable participants is 0.608. However this
estimate is not DEMO different from zero at the 10 percent significance level.
As mentioned earlier we relax the assumption of sophisticated dynamic contestants
in two ways. One DEMO what we term “myopic,” in which the subjects only look one period
into the future. The other is what we term naïve in DEMO case the expected offer is

exchange rate data from the Central Bank of Mexico for that year. WH is extracted from Loyola (2002).

simply the expected value of the contents of the active briefcases.  This would suggest
that we are considering four models; however, as it DEMO out the naïve offers are such
that a dynamic person who can consider the possibility of continuing past the next period
anticipates stopping next DEMO to be optimal and thus is indistinguishable from a
myopic naïve agent. Therefore, we have only two alternative specifications; sophisticated
myopic and naïve.
DEMO indicated by Table 2, allowing agents to be myopic and at DEMO same time
sophisticated in their offer beliefs is unappealing. With this specification we find that 11
subjects are not consistent with any value of DEMO and we cannot determine consistency for
22 others. Essentially with this specification in early rounds where there is considerable
variation, the participants expect low offers given their level of sophistication but do not
consider the better DEMO offers that will subsequently result as the variance decreases.
When these participants continue it seems as though they are forgoing a relatively good
offer DEMO exchange for something they expect to be bad indicating risk loving preferences.
Stopping suggests that the subjects are not too risk seeking, but given our computational
limits we are unable to determine if the behavior is DEMO or these participants have
consistent preferences.9
Assuming that agents are naïve, DEMO are 8 unidentified contestants but only 1 that is
clearly inconsistent, DEMO shown in Table 2. Under this model, we see a marked DEMO in
the amount of risk aversion. Of those from whom we observe upper and lower bounds,
the average midpoint increases to 2.636, see Table 3.  The maximum r that we observe
could be as high as 13.98, and 10 of the 43 usable contestants (23%) are sufficiently risk
averse such that r > 2.  In fact, as DEMO in Figure 3, all of the contestants could have a
positive DEMO For this specification the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean of r is
1.076, which is statistically different from zero at the five percent confidence level.
The effect of our wealth choice is also demonstrated in DEMO 2 and 3. By definition,
increasing wealth makes a person making the identical decision appear more relatively
9 The maximum prize is 5,DEMO,000 and thus r < -12 results in the need to compute (5,000,000+W)13, which
creates an overflow error. Therefore, it could be that stopping indicates a constant’s r is below -13.5, which
is consistent with previous decisions indicting that r is less than -12 DEMO it could be inconsistent with
previous decisions indicating r is above -13.

risk averse. But it does not appear that the wealth assumption changes DEMO results
substantially.
The Level of Risk Aversion with CARA.
The results for CARA are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 and Figures 4 and DEMO  The
basic conclusions are similar to the CRRA case. Again we DEMO evidence of mild risk
aversion in our sophisticated dynamic specification. The average midpoint for contestants
for whom we could identify both bounds in 6×10-7, see Table 5. Twenty six of the 46
usable contestants (57%) DEMO be risk averse, while only one must be risk loving, see
Figure 4. From Table 5, the highest possible σ we observe is 1.98×10-5 and the lowest σ
that at least one contestant must have DEMO -5.9×10-6.10
As evidenced in Table 4 by the large number of inconsistent and unidentified
contestants, the myopic sophisticated model is again unappealing.11  However, the naïve
model is reasonable.  With this specification, the contestants appear DEMO risk averse as a
group, with the average midpoint shifted up DEMO 4.8×10-6.  The maximum possible
σ becomes 7.35×10-5 and 31 of the DEMO usable contestants (63%) must be risk averse.
With this specification, DEMO of the contestants (10%) must be risk seeking, see Figure DEMO
It is interesting to note that this is greater than the percentage of contestants who must be
risk loving in the sophisticated dynamic model.
DEMO with Other Studies.
As mentioned earlier, there are four concurrent studies DEMO data from Deal or No
Deal in different countries: Bombardini and DEMO (2005) using data from Italy; Mulino,
Scheelings, Brooks, DEMO Faff (2006) and De Roos and Sarafidis (2006) using data from
Australia; Post, and Van den Assem, Baltussen and Thaler (DEMO) using data from
Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. In this DEMO we compare our results and
methodology with those from these studies. But first, we note some of the differences in
show formats.  In DEMO the Australian and Italian shows, potential payoffs include non-

normal distribution is not applicable.
11 With CARA, computational limits do not allow us to evaluate values of σ below -7×10-5.

cash prizes such as a car or a year’s supply of soap.12 DEMO the Australian show, contestants
may have supplementary rounds like “Chance” or DEMO in which contestants can
play another bonus round even if they accept the current offer. In the Italian show,
contestants may have an DEMO to “Change” allowing them to swap the held briefcase
with any one of the remaining briefcases. This ability is non-trivial as the bank knows DEMO
amount of money held in each briefcase and thus the offers may be informative.
Analytical methodologies differ across studies in several ways. Mulino et DEMO assume
that contestants look forward only one round as in our myopic model, but they assume
participants compare the current offer with the expected utility of the remaining
briefcases. In addition to a myopic or static DEMO, the other three papers, like ours,
attempt to fit data to the framework in which contestants compute all possible paths and
solve DEMO dynamic decision-making problem by using backward induction. A static model
is defined differently though. Bombardini and Trebbi and De Roos and Sarafidis employ
a DEMO model similar to that of Mulino et al. while Post et al. assume that myopic
contestants would stop by accepting an offer in the DEMO next round as do we. But Post et
al. do not consider the uncertainty or forecasting errors associated with future offers.
There are also DEMO in how contestants form expectations of future offers in
the dynamic model. Post et al. estimate an offer function where future offers are a
DEMO of expected value dependent upon the current offer and round. However, DEMO
assume that future offers are predictable without error. Bombardini and Trebbi face a
more difficult problem in that offers are potentially informative as the DEMO knows the
contents of the briefcase and therefore, they consider both DEMO and uninformative
offers. Like Post et al., Bombardini and Trebbi calculate DEMO empirical distribution of
offers as a percentage of expected value for each round.13 As in our model, Bombardini
and Trebbi assume that contestants take forecasting errors into account. However, they do
not assume that contestants do not take into account the variance of the active briefcases,
which DEMO have found to be a significant factor impacting offers. Similar to our approach,
De Roos and Sarafidis employ a regression approach to describe DEMO contestants predict
future offers. They assume that contestants base their forecasting on the mean and the

13 In the case of informative offer, the empirical DEMO is specific to the rank of the held briefcase
among the active briefcases as well as round.
11
standard deviation of the remaining briefcases for each round, but they do not consider
forecasting errors.14
Despite the differences in methodologies and show formats, it is interesting to
compare the results across studies.15 Mulino et al. DEMO that participants in the Australian
show are overall risk loving; in DEMO myopic model, the CRRA coefficient estimate at the
zero wealth level DEMO -0.31 to -0.26 and significantly less than zero. 16 They find 24
inconsistent cases (about 26%). However, using data from the same DEMO show, De
Roos and Sarafidis find that the coefficient at the DEMO wealth level is between 0.16~0.24
(myopic) and 0.46~0.66 (dynamic) and all their estimates are significantly larger than
zero. They find that, when evaluated at a higher wealth level (annual income), the
estimates are larger (about 0.6 for the static model and 1.8~3.2 for the dynamic model).
Trying to bound risk preferences, both studies ignore an extra incentive from “Chance” or
“SuperCase” which is a special feature of the DEMO show. Also both include
“inconsistent” contestants for estimation.
Bombardini and Trebbi find that, for the Italian show participants, the CRRA
coefficient is typically DEMO 3.41 (static) and 3.15~4.03 (dynamic) when annual labor
income multiplied by 10 is used for the initial wealth. The estimates are quite DEMO to
the wealth level; under the dynamic model, they find 0.43~0.51 at the zero wealth and
1.08~1.37 with the wealth being the annual DEMO Despite the fact that the coefficient is
on average significantly larger than zero, Bombardini and Trebbi find a large degree of
heterogeneity in risk preferences. They also report that 4%-6% of participants are
inconsistent, a slightly smaller percentage then we observed.
The results of Post et al. are DEMO comparable to ours because of the similarity in
show formats and similarities in methodological approaches. They find that the CRRA
14 Instead, De Roos and Sarafidis employ a random utility model including contestant-specific random
effects.
15 DEMO differences across countries could also explain some of the variation. However such a
comparison should be done within a unified analytical framework, which is somehow infeasible due to the
differences in show formats.
16 This framework DEMO exactly equivalent to the static model of Bombardini and Trebbi. They found that the
estimated CRRA coefficients from the myopic model are lower than DEMO from the dynamic model. This
suggests that Mulino et al. estimate lower bounds on risk attitudes. On the other hand, as they explain in
their paper, the presence of the Chance and SuperCase supplementary rounds makes contestants more
likely to accept low offers. Ignoring in the analysis as DEMO do would lead to overestimating the risk
aversion coefficient. It is not clear which of these effects dominates.
12
coefficient ranges from 1.15 (wealth = 0) to 6.68 (wealth = annual income), which are
higher than our estimates. The estimates become DEMO lower under the myopic model.
Like the other studies, they also DEMO a non-ignorable mass of inconsistent behaviors
(15% of participants).
Only DEMO other studies estimate the CARA parameter. Mulino et al. present the
average minimum upper bound of the CARA parameter, that is -7.8×10-6. De Roos and
Sarafidis find that the coefficient is between 6×10-6 (static) and DEMO (dynamic), which
again confirms that ignoring the possibility of backward DEMO and dynamic decision-
making makes contestants appear less risk averse. Again except Mulino et al. our
estimates are on average lower.
V. Conclusions
Risk DEMO are an integral part of the economy, which explains why they DEMO
been studied in may contexts.  However, there is surprising little agreement on the degree
of risk aversion in the population.17 Game shows can DEMO a natural experiment for
measuring risk. Unlike laboratory experiments in which the prize amounts are typically
small, game shows typically involve substantial amounts of money.18 Deal or No Deal
offers a clean data set for evaluating DEMO risk attitudes in high stakes lotteries. In the
Mexican version of the show that we analyze, the top price is 5,000,000 pesos
(approximately US$442,000). Complete information is provided regarding the possible
prizes, the offers the contestant faces, and the actual decisions of the DEMO The
ability to cleanly observe behavior in high stakes situations, explains DEMO several
researchers are focusing on this game shows.
In general, we DEMO substantial evidence of risk aversion in both the CRRA and
CARA specifications. However, the degree of risk aversion is typically more modest than
what has been reported by previous researchers. One possible explanation for this
17 DEMO fact, based upon laboratory experiments, Isaac and James (2000) conclude that the same individual
exhibits different risk preferences in different decision problems.
DEMO The relatively high stakes in the experiments of Holt and Laury (DEMO) involved a maximum prize of
US$346.50. The ability to offer such DEMO prizes on game shows is derived from the television network’s
ability to sell advertising space to large viewing audience which may impact behavior.  Laboratory
experiments by Dufwenberg and Muren (forthcoming) show that an audience can DEMO behavior in two
person games. Of course, none of the models DEMO risk aversion specify a minimum magnitude threshold
below which risks are viewed differently.
13
difference is that Mexico is a developing country and economic development may DEMO
people’s risk attitudes through various channels from life expectancy at the micro level to
economic vulnerability at the macro level. We hope our study DEMO more cross-
culture comparative studies. We also find a considerable variation in risk attitudes, with a
few people being extremely risk averse while others are risk loving. Ultimately, only a
small percentage of people were found to be inconsistent with any reasonable level of
risk aversion in either DEMO CRRA or CARA specifications. More studies are required to
determine if these inconsistent behaviors are simply random mistakes or due to the
analytical limitation DEMO the classical expected-utility framework.
