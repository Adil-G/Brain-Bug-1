ANGEL INVESTMENT DECISION MAKING AS A
LEARNING PROCESS
ABSTRACT
This paper extends DEMO literature on the investment decision-making of business angels.
Using insights from entrepreneurial learning theory, particularly the use of heuristics and the
nature of learning from meagre experience, we explore whether angels learn from experience, how
DEMO learn and what they learn. These issues are addressed using verbal protocol analysis, a
methodology for examining decision-making in real time, on three DEMO of business angels with
differing levels of investment experience, and on DEMO interviews with these angels. This
reveals some differences in the speed of decision making and the emphasis given to various
investment criteria. There is DEMO evidence for the use of heuristics in the decision making
process, DEMO for the critical role played by vicarious learning from the experience of others.
Learning in the individual angel decision making process is a social DEMO well as individual
phenomenon.
Key words: business angels, investment decisions, DEMO learning, vicarious learning,
heuristics, social learning
ANGEL INVESTMENT DECISION MAKING AS A LEARNING PROCESS
INTRODUCTION
There is now DEMO small but significant literature on how business angels make their investment
decisions (see Mason, 2006: Riding et al, 2007 for reviews).  These studies are of three types. The
first type is process studies.  Riding et al. (1993) and Haines et al. (2003) have DEMO a number
of discrete stages in their investment decision, similar to DEMO used by venture capital funds (Fried
and Hisrich, 1994), comprising the following: deal origination; deal evaluation – which can be
divided DEMO initial screening and detailed investigation; negotiation and contracting; post-
investment involvement; and exiting. The second type is criteria studies, which examine the
DEMO which angels use to evaluate investment opportunities. This category can be further divided
into three sub-categories. One sub-category of studies provides a generalized retrospective DEMO of
angels‟ investment criteria with responses normally gathered through postal surveys (DEMO Mason
and Harrison, 1994; 2002). The limitations of this approach are that they do not distinguish
between the type of investment opportunity DEMO between factors used at the screening stage and the
detailed evaluation stage. Post-hoc rationalisation is also problematic. Another sub-category is
case studies of how DEMO investors or specific angel groups make their investment decisions.
For example, DEMO and Harrison (1996) examined deals rejected by a UK business angel
investment group. The third sub-category is real time studies, which have emerged in response to
the weaknesses in the generalized retrospective approach. Mason and DEMO (1996; 1997) used
verbal protocol analysis – essentially asking respondents DEMO „think out loud‟ as they perform a task,
in this case undertaking the initial screening of an investment opportunity. Others have used
conjoint DEMO – an analytical tool primarily used in marketing, to study factors DEMO influence
purchasing decisions which is based on asking respondents to make a series DEMO  trade-offs  (e.g.
Landström, 1998; Ludvigsen, 2009). A variant on these verbal protocol studies are studies which
have examined the real DEMO reactions of investors to oral presentations by entrepreneurs (Mason
and Harrison, 2003; Clark, 2008). Finally, some studies have sought, using DEMO methodologies,
to compare the investment decision-making processes and investment criteria of business angels
and other types of investor (e.g. Mason and Stark, DEMO).
A major gap in this literature on angel investing is the effect of experience on investment decision-
making. Indeed, previous studies implicitly assume angel investors know what they are doing and
that their approach to DEMO does not change with experience. As a first contribution to
addressing this omission we apply insights from the entrepreneurial learning literature to explore
the DEMO of learning in angel investing. The paper has three objectives. First, DEMO address the
following questions.  Do angel investors learn from experience?  DEMO so, how do they learn? And
how does this learning influence their approach to investing? Second, we discuss the extent to
which DEMO, whether experienced or novice, use heuristics, that is, the decision rules used to
reduce complex judgemental tasks to relatively simple cognitive operations (Holcomb, Ireland,
Holmes and Hitt 2009), as the basis for vicarious learning from the experience of others. Third, we
ask how investors without prior investment experience learn.  Many angels make only a small
number of investments (Mason and Harrison, 1994; 1996; 2002; Harrison and Mason, 2007) and
this may not be sufficient to derive the DEMO experience to improve their investment ability.
Reflecting on March et al.‟s (DEMO) analysis of learning from samples of less than one we explore
DEMO inexperienced angels (with one or fewer investments) learn from experience and convert
infrequent events into interpretations that form the basis interpreting subsequent knowledge-
DEMO experiences. Evidence on these issues has the potential to make a valuable contribution to
angel education.
ENTREPRENEURIAL LEARNING
Entrepreneurial action is predicated on learning, and in recent years there have been a number of
models developed to account for how DEMO learn (Harrison and Leitch 2005a, 2008).
These variously emphasise learning through the accumulation of experiential knowledge (Politis
2005; Cope 2005), DEMO role of learning asymmetries that offer opportunity exploitation advantages
(Corbett 2005, 2007; Rae and Carswell 2001) and the accumulation, assimilation and use of
entrepreneurial knowledge (Wang 2008; Levesque et al 2009).  Much of this research is based,
directly or indirectly, on adaptations of Kolb‟s (1984) experiential learning theory, which sees
learning as a cyclical process of learning from experience through reflection and conceptualisation
to action and DEMO on to further experience (Kayes 2002).  In the first overview collection of
papers on entrepreneurial learning (Harrison and Leitch 2005a) it DEMO been argued that there is a
need for greater research into the process dynamics of learning in entrepreneurial contexts,
recognising that such learning DEMO experiential, that learning is a process that alters permanently the
character DEMO behaviour, that learning is an individual process (even if it occurs in a social or
organisational context – Dutta and Crossan 2005), DEMO that learning is organised by existing
routines, rules and practices (Harrison and Leitch 2005b, 364).  Furthermore, this review
concluded that “there is a distinction between the knowledge stock of an entrepreneurial venture
(or entrepreneur) and the process through which that knowledge has been created.  DEMO
research is needed on this important relationship“ (Harrison and Leitch 2005b, 364).
In this paper we respond to this challenge by examining DEMO extent to which learning is
experiential and linked to potential changes in behaviour.  We do this in an exploratory study of
the investment decision-making process of a sample of business angel investors with different
levels of DEMO experience.  In so doing, we add to the literature by examining specifically
the case of learning from experience when there is no (or little) experience to learn from, which is
the position of an angel DEMO contemplating their first investment.  As there are still no
comprehensive theoretical DEMO to explain how entrepreneurial actors learn (Cope 2005),
we ground our analysis in two sets of insights: the role of heuristics in learning (Holcomb et al,
2009) and the process of learning DEMO experience when there is little experience to learn from
(March, Sproull and Tamuz 1991).
A connection has recently been established between learning DEMO heuristics (Holcomb et al, 2009).
A distinction can be made between experiential learning, that is,  learning from experience and the
accumulation and storing of that learning as knowledge, on the one hand  DEMO vicarious learning,
that is,  learning by observing others‟ behaviours and its consequences and the assimilation of this
information and using it as DEMO basis for action. Building on this distinction, Holcomb et al (2009)
identify three heuristics that influence learning (Tversky and Kahneman 1973, DEMO), given that
both experiential and vicarious learning are associated with the acquisition of incomplete or
ambiguous information.
First, the availability heuristic refers to the extent to which there are traces of event instances (e.g.
new venture creation or angel investing) in memory and the ease with which certain associations
come to mind.  The extent to which memory contains traces of events is relevant here: the more
extensive these are, the DEMO likely enactment of similar behaviour will be.  In the case of DEMO
investing, we would expect that the greater the experience of investing (and therefore the greater
availability of event instances in memory) the more confident angel investors will be in appraising
investment opportunities. Second, the representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to
identify the central or most significant DEMO of a category of events and apply it to all examples
of that category, such as the set of factors associated with success in venture capital investing,
hence improving decision-making effectiveness (Zacharakis and Shepherd 1999).  The greater DEMO
experience of the angel investor, therefore, in our context, the DEMO their ability to make
effective screening judgements.  Third, the anchoring and adjustment heuristic suggests that in
making a decision, individuals settle on an anchor value, based on prior experience, partial
analysis or by intuitive DEMO, and progressively adjust this in the light of experience.  While
largely outside the scope of the present paper (as this heuristic is most likely to apply in decisions
about, for example, the valuation of DEMO prospective investment and the proportion of equity to be
taken, rather DEMO at the initial screening stage) this heuristic suggests that in making DEMO
decisions the investor‟s anchor values will have an important bearing on the outcome.
In the analysis that follows we will refer to the distinction DEMO experiential and vicarious
learning and the role of the availability and representativeness heuristics in accounting for the
observed learning processes of a sample of DEMO angel investors of different degrees of
experience. In particular, we will DEMO to the importance of vicarious learning as a learning
process and as the underpinning for the operation of heuristics in the learning process.  March et al
(1991) have identified two mechanisms by which meagre experiences (or none at all) can be
converted into interpretations of history (DEMO learning).  First, history can be experienced more
richly: rather DEMO taking a historical event (in our context, an investment or an investment
presentation or pitch) that history can be experienced in multiple aspects, by focusing on critical
events and by experiencing more interpretations of that event (emphasising the social as well as
individual aspect of the learning process).  Second, individuals and organisations can simulate
history, either by conceptualising near-histories (what might have happened if circumstances were
a little different) or by developing hypothetical histories (heuristics and simulations) that may have
interpretative significance greater than the history actually experienced.
HOW BUSINESS ANGELS EVALUATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Mason and Rogers (1997) have DEMO important insights into how business angels evaluate
investment opportunities. When they first become aware of an investment opportunity their first
question is to consider DEMO well it „fits‟ with their own personal investment criteria, an anchoring
DEMO (Tversky and Kahneman 1974). This may include location, amount sought, knowledge of
an interest in the sector and ability to add value. Angels then undertake a quick review of those
opportunities which fall within DEMO personal investment criteria. Their aim at this point in the
decision-making process is simply to assess whether the proposal has sufficient merit to justify DEMO
investment of time to undertake a detailed assessment, based on the DEMO of a
representativeness heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman 1974).  Angels approach this stage with a
negative mindset, expecting that the opportunity will be poor (because of the opportunities that
they have previously seen) and DEMO for reasons to reject it. This approach has been termed
„three strikes and you‟re out‟ (Mason and Rogers, 1996; 1997) and is DEMO by evidence that
the rejection of opportunities is generally based on several factors rather than a single deal killer
(Mason and Harrison, 1996)DEMO The market and the entrepreneur are the key considerations at this
stage. Less significant are the product/service and financial factors. Indeed, angels exhibit
considerable scepticism about the value of financial information in the business plan DEMO start-ups.
Nevertheless, investors want to see that there is the potential DEMO significant financial return, that
the principals are financially committed and what DEMO money that is invested will be used for.
Some angels will be flexible, willing to treat these criteria as compensatory (e.g. a strong
DEMO team would compensate for a distant location), whereas others will regard them as
non-compensatory (Feeney et al, 1999).
The purpose of the initial screen is to filter out „no hopers‟ DEMO order to focus their time on those
opportunities that appear to have potential. These are subject to more detailed appraisal. The
investor will read DEMO business plan in detail, go over the financial information, visit the premises,
do some personal research to gather additional information on market DEMO, competition and
so on, and assess the principals. Indeed, getting DEMO know the principals personally (by a series of
formal and informal DEMO) is the most vital part of the process (May and Simmons, 2001).
This stage has received little attention from researchers. According to May and Simmons (2001:
101) “it might consist of a DEMO phone calls and a visit or two, or weeks of meetings, documents
flying back and forth and questions, questions, questions.” However, it would appear that most
angels emphasise their intuition and gut feeling rather DEMO performing formal analysis (Haines et
al, 2003. At this detailed evaluation stage the importance of people factors becomes critical
(Riding et al, DEMO), with investors emphasising management abilities, an understanding of what is
DEMO to be successful, a strong work ethic, integrity, honesty, openness and personal chemistry
(Haines et al, 2003; Mason and Stark, DEMO). Indeed, angels give greater emphasis to these issues
than venture DEMO fund managers (Mason and Stark, 2004). This emphasis on the people reflects
the long and personal nature of the angel-entrepreneur relationship. Rewards, realism of the
projections and potential also assume greater importance while „investor DEMO becomes less of a
consideration (Riding et al, 1995).
Angels typically reject most of the opportunities that they see. In their Canadian DEMO Riding et al
(1993) found that 72.6% of opportunities were rejected at the initial impressions stage, a further
15.9% were rejected following more detailed evaluation, and as this stage proceeds another 6.3%
were eliminated, DEMO cumulative rejection rate of 94.8%. Thus, business angels proceed to the
DEMO stage with only 5% of the investment opportunities that they receive.
This paper extends this literature on investment decision-making by business angels by DEMO
whether business angles learn from experience, how they learn and how DEMO learning is reflected
in their approach to investing. We do so, DEMO, by comparing how investors with differing levels of
investment experience approach DEMO appraisal of investment opportunities, and second, by asking
investors to reflect on their learning.
METHODOLOGY
This paper uses verbal protocol analysis, a technique which involves respondents „thinking out
loud‟ as they perform a particular task, in this case reviewing a potential funding opportunity. The
technique has been DEMO successfully to examine the decision-making process of both venture
capitalists and business angels (Hall and Hofer, 1993; Zacharakis and Meyer, 1995; Mason and
Rogers, 1996; 1997; Mason and Stark, 2004) and has also been applied in a variety of other
contexts (see Ericsson and Simon, 1993). The verbalisations of respondents are recorded,
transcribed and then the content is analysed by means of a coding scheme devised DEMO the specific
research questions. The results of this analysis are generally presented as frequency counts.
This methodology provides a more reliable and much richer DEMO of the decision-making
process of investor and the criteria used to evaluate investment opportunities than is possible from
approaches that use questionnaires, surveys and interviews (Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999). Self-
reported, retrospective data are subject to conscious or unconscious errors associated with post hoc
rationalisation and DEMO bias. There are also cognitive perceptual limitations, with evidence that
venture DEMO have limited insights into their decision-processes (Zacharakis and Meyer,
1998; Shepherd, 1999). The consequence is that they often overstate DEMO number of criteria
actually used, understate the most important criteria and DEMO the least important criteria
(Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999). Hence, DEMO Zacharakis and Meyer (1998: 72) note, “„past studies
provide a laundry list of factors that may be biased in that they list DEMO multitude of factors that have
a relatively small influence on the decision.” As a real-time experiment which does not require
investors to introspect about DEMO thought processes, verbal protocol analysis sidesteps these
recall, post hoc rationalisation and cognitive biases (Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999).
Moreover, as noted above, the evaluation of investment opportunities is a multi-stage process.
Although the same considerations may be present at each stage their relative importance changes
DEMO the course of the decision-making process (Riding et al, 1993). A further limitation of
questionnaire and interview surveys of decision-making is that DEMO do not differentiate between
these different stages in the decision-making process and as a consequence are likely to produce
misleading findings.
The focus is DEMO the initial screening stage – the stage when a funder has become aware of an
investment opportunity and considers it with a view to DEMO sufficient initial impressions to
decide whether it is worthy of detailed consideration or should be rejected out of hand. This stage
is done fairly DEMO, typically in less than 10 minutes (Sweeting, 1991; Hall and Hofer, 1993;
Mason and Rogers, 1996; 1997), with angels rejecting most of the opportunities that they review.
One study of Canadian DEMO angels reported that they accepted just 6% of the investment
opportunities for detailed consideration (Haines at al., 2003).  In the context of the increasing
organisational diversity of the angel market, and in particular the growth of syndicates (Mason
2006; Sohl 2007), it needs to DEMO emphasised that all the angels in this study were conducting the
screening for the purposes of direct personal investment and on their own behalf DEMO Investors
who lead small angel syndicates, and the gatekeepers (Paul and Whittam, 2010) for syndicates
(who may or may not themselves be investors), may adopt a more formalised and structured
approach to this assessment. The individual investors in such syndicates, who make decisions on
the basis of screened deals being presented to them by the gatekeeper or lead investor DEMO in the
syndicate, may also follow different procedures1.  The applicability of our analysis and
conclusions are, therefore, limited to the individual investor DEMO making process and cannot
be generalised to other investors or investment contexts without further research (see Blair 1996;
Knighton 1996 for examples of decision making within angel groups).
Nevertheless, verbal protocol analysis has some limitations. First, a frequency count of „thought
units‟ is an imperfect indicator of the importance of a factor in the final decision (Zacharakis and
Meyer, 1995). No weightings are placed on the responses to measure emphasis and the topics
mentioned most frequently are not necessarily those that DEMO the ultimate influence on the
decision. Nor does it allow for different convincer patterns. In other words, people may repeat
something several times it they are unsure but say it only once if they are absolutely DEMO Second,
subjectivity is involved in coding, analysing and interpreting the DEMO (Riquelme and
Rickards, 1992). Third, some respondents may be DEMO or self-conscious about thinking
and speaking out loud which may distort their thinking (e.g. resulting in excessive repetition of
what they are reading). Fourth, it is impossible to entirely remove the effect of the artificiality of
the situation. Fifth, from a practical point of view it ignores the role of the source of funding
opportunity which is an important DEMO influence on the investor‟s attitude to the opportunity
(Hall and Hofer, 1993). However, Ericsson and Simon (1980) argue that verbal protocol analysis
is a valuable method of analysing decision-making as long as the DEMO criteria are met: the
information reported must be the focus of DEMO; the task is not highly routinised by habit; there
1 David Grahame, personal communication, 6 May 2010
must be only a short time between performance and verbalisation; verbalisation does not require
excessive encoding; reports are oral; subjects are free from DEMO; instructions are clear; and
completeness in reporting is encouraged.  These DEMO are all met in this study.
In order to examine the role of experience in the learning process, and in the absence of
longitudinal data over significant period of time for a single set of investors, the study was based
on a sample comprising three groups of business DEMO with contrasting investment experience.
Each group comprised four angels, all based DEMO Scotland, who were all identified with the help of
LINC Scotland, the national association for business angels. The first group comprised
experienced (or super) business angels who had each made five or more investments 2. The second
group comprised novice angels who had each made just one DEMO The final group
comprised nascent angels who were seriously engaged in looking to make their first investment.
The terminologies were taken from an earlier DEMO of the character of the Scottish business
angel market (Paul et DEMO 2003). Each angel was shown a current real investment opportunity which
was sourced from a business angel network. It was given a fictitious DEMO to protect its anonymity
and it was given a local address in view of the importance that the majority of angels give to
investing DEMO local businesses (Mason, 2007). This was a start-up health care/medical devices
company seeking £500,000 ($750,000) in a seed DEMO round. The angels were asked to read the
opportunity in the same way that they would normally read an investment proposal but verbalise
their DEMO as they did so. The instruction that they were given was to say out loud the thoughts
that came into their mind. Respondents were DEMO required to provide any explanations or verbal
2 This definition of super angels is with respect to the stage of development of the business DEMO
market in Scotland, which in common with the rest of the DEMO, is characterised by a large number
of relatively infrequent investors, many of them recent entrants into the market, and a few
significantly more active investors, some of whom will have many more investments than this
minimum threshold (see Mason and Harrison 2010). This contrasts with, DEMO example, the more
mature angel market in the US, where super angels can be defined as those making 50 or more
investments (Richard Sudek, personal communication, June 2010)
descriptions (Ericsson and Simon, 1993). One of the authors was DEMO as each respondent
performed this task and reminded respondents to think out loud if they lapsed into silence for more
than 15 seconds. The DEMO were either the angel‟s home office, work office or a hotel.
DEMO thoughts were recorded and subsequently a complete transcript was made for each
respondent‟s consideration of each investment opportunity.  Following the approach of Mason and
Rogers (1996; 1997) these verbatim transcripts were then broken down into short phrases, or
„thought segments‟ – that is, phrases and sentences DEMO are independent thought units – to permit
analysis. These thought units were then coded first into one of nine categories relating to different
types DEMO investment criteria and secondly into seven categories of cognitive process (e.g.
DEMO, inference, question). All authors were involved in triangulating the codings to ensure
robustness (Leitch, Hill and Harrison 2010). The frequency DEMO for each category of investor
were then aggregated and compared. A short de-briefing session was then carried out with each
investor after they had DEMO the evaluation which asked them to reflect on their own learning
as investors. In the case of nascent angels the discussion revolved around what DEMO recognized
they did not know and needed to learn. Our expectations were as follows: we would be able to
observe differences between the three groups angels in terms of how they went about the
investment screening; and these differences could be ascribed to learning from experience,
influenced DEMO the use of heuristics and vicarious learning both from the experience of others and
from strategies to learn from small samples of experience (March et al 1991).
RESULTS
There was no difference between the investor groups in terms of the DEMO decision. Three of
the four angels in each category rejected the opportunity outright, with only one in each group
sufficiently interested to want more information and meet the entrepreneur (Table 1).
INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE
The time taken to make the decision ranged from just under DEMO minutes to just over 20 minutes
(Table 1), although as DEMO and Rogers (1997) previously noted, there is a strong sense DEMO
because of the artificiality of the situation angels went on reading the proposal for longer than they
would in normal circumstances. Super angels made DEMO quickest decision and exhibited the least
variability. They were nearly two minutes quicker than nascent angels and nearly two-and-a-half
minutes faster than novice angels DEMO were the slowest group to make a decision. It seems
reasonable to interpret the quicker decision time of the super angels in terms of DEMO greater
experience which enables them to „cut to the chase‟, suggesting DEMO of experiential learning
and faster cognitive processes (Baron and Ensley, 2006).  In particular, their decision processes
show strong evidence for the DEMO of a representativeness heuristic in decision making.  The
decisions of these DEMO are based on a focus on a limited number of factors which their prior
experience has shown to be associated with a prospectively successful DEMO  This allows
them to more quickly assess the likelihood that this DEMO will generate sufficient returns to
make it attractive to them.
Two observations can be made concerning the investment criteria used by these different types DEMO
angels (Table 2). First, there is broad agreement amongst the different types of business angels in
the relative importance of the funding criteria. A simple rank correlation test (Spearman's rho)
confirms this: the responses of super angels are strongly correlated with those of novice angels (ρ
= 0.85) and DEMO are slightly weaker but still substantial correlations between nascent and novice
angel rankings (ρ = 0.74) and between super angel and novice angel DEMO (ρ = 0.71),
confirming that in terms of their rankings of funding criteria there is a bigger difference between
super angels and DEMO other two categories. This provides some initial evidence that there is a
learning from experience process at work.  Finance is the most important criterion for both nascent
and novice angels but ranks only fourth for experienced DEMO This is consistent with previous
research which notes that experienced angels do not place much emphasis on finances and are
fairly cynical about the DEMO of projections (Mason and Rogers, 1997). For nascent and novice
angels this priority given to finance in the decision process is consistent DEMO an availability
heuristic based on their assimilation (in this case through DEMO learning from the
representations of the experience of others rather from their own direct experience) of prior event
histories into memory on which they base their predictions of likely success factors and critical
decision influencers (Holcomb et al 2009).  As such, this is consistent with a DEMO of learning
from meagre samples of experience through experiencing multiple interpretations of those events
(March et al 1991).
INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE
Investor fit is the most important criterion amongst experienced angels, second amongst novice
angels but only fourth amongst nascent angels. Experienced angels clearly recognise DEMO value of
maintaining clear investment criteria and not deviating from them and by investing in businesses
in markets and sectors that they know and DEMO There is evidence here of both
representativeness heuristic and of an anchoring heuristic in which their prior decision set puts
constraints on the nature of the opportunities they consider attractive.  The other significant
deviations relate to marketing, with nascents placing more emphasis on this than either novices or
experienced angels, and the business plan, which DEMO angels emphasise more than either
novices or nascents.  Again this demonstrates DEMO operation of a representativeness heuristic. There
is a higher degree of agreement amongst those factors that are of lesser importance – operations is
ninth DEMO for all three investor types, and the entrepreneur is ranked seventh DEMO both nascent
and experienced angels but fifth by novices. Although not a major difference, this suggests that
novice angels may be more likely to base at lest their initial decisions on the qualities
(trustworthiness, likeability, experience, perceived competence) of the entrepreneur (Harrison and
Mason 2002) DEMO will more experienced investors who can draw on more robust availability and
representativeness heuristics to aid their decision-making.  If so, this has implications DEMO attempts
to deepen the pool of angel investors by bringing more nascent investors into the market.
Second, there are contrasts in the way in which the different investor types allocate their time.
Novice investors spend almost DEMO of their time on their top ranked investment criterion
compared with 22.3% of their time for nascents and 20.1% of their time for experienced DEMO
This difference widens further when their second top investment factor is added (53.7%, 42.9%
and 39.6% respectively) and although the gap narrows after that it remains clearly identifiable
until the fifth investment criteria. This indicates DEMO experienced angels do not become obsessed
with just one or two investment factors.  This is an important conclusion for it suggests, in contrast
DEMO the interpretation of the factors identified as important in the decision process, that they are not
employing a representativeness heuristic, which would be DEMO in their allocation of more time
to fewer factors in an overall quicker process.  For these investors, the operation of an availability
heuristic DEMO of an anchoring and adjustment heuristic, together with the accumulation of DEMO
direct experience on which to draw (which underpins the availability heuristic), appears to
downplay the significance of the representativeness heuristic in their decision processes.  In terms
of their learning processes, therefore, and a subject for further DEMO, the shift in the relative
importance of these heuristics in the DEMO process with experience is an important topic.
There are few differences in the cognitive processes used by business angels to analyse the
investment proposal, either in terms of the rank order of statement types or the DEMO
frequencies with which they were evidenced (Table 3). Again using DEMO rho, there are
strong rank order relationships between the responses of DEMO angels and novice angels (ρ =
0.89), between super angels DEMO nascent angels (ρ = 0.89) and, very slightly more weakly,DEMO
between novice and nascent angels (ρ = 0.80).  Inferences, DEMO and descriptions are the top
three statement types for all three groups of angels with question and description ranked second
and third for nascent DEMO but reversed for novice and experienced angels. In terms of their
allocation of time nascent angels spend most time asking questions (26.2% cf. 15.1% and 20.1%
for novice and experienced angels respectively) and least time on description (16.7% cf. 19.9%
and 22.7% respectively). In all cases, DEMO in common with previous research (Mason and Rogers
1996; 1997), recall statements are rare, suggesting that at the initial screening stage at least, there
is little evidence of an anchoring and adjustment heuristic at work.

DISCUSSION
These contrasts in the verbal DEMO counts amongst the three groups of angels are not as great
as might be expected, with the differences limited to the time to make the decision and the
emphasis given to certain investment criteria. This may DEMO that the extent of learning has
been limited. However, this is not the case. In follow-up questions after completing the verbal
protocols the super angels all acknowledge that they have DEMO continuously.
“You are always learning … It‟s been a process of personal evolution” (super 2).
“I learn from every investment I have made” (super 1).
Learning begins with the very first investment. One super angel commented as follows:
“After the first investment I thought, hang on a minute, I really need to be more diligent
in the questions and actually test what people are saying to me in a DEMO robust way”
(Super 4).
The novice angels similarly also noted DEMO they gained significant learning from their initial
investment.
Instead, we attribute DEMO relatively limited contrasts in the verbal protocol frequency to two other
factors. First, the impact of much of the learning appears to be reflected in the next stage of the
investment process, where angels undertake a detailed investigation of those investment proposals
that pass their initial screen, rather than at the initial screening stage itself. In other words, angel
investors learn progressively through the process of screening, evaluation and making an
investment.  Novice investors, therefore, report less learning because they have less experience to
reply on.   Second, it reflects the nature of the learning, which appears to be restricted, with the
majority of super and DEMO angels noting that the underlying fundamentals (i.e. the key
investment criteria) and their investment processes have remained the same. This apparent
contradiction is explained in the following terms by one novice angel:
DEMO don‟t think it‟s so much learning but reinforcement, like people skills DEMO really
important” (novice 1).
Another commented that investing is
“definitely DEMO practical learning experience … [but] it doesn‟t change your underlying
approach” (DEMO 2).
The same point is made by this angel:
“Has my approach to investing changed? Not really. I think it all comes down to the four
things I look for – people, profit, DEMO generation and exit. So fundamentally no it‟s not
really changed … how I actually produce the question sets has changed but
fundamentally these four DEMO are the most important elements for me” (super 4).
And DEMO commented:
“I think I still do what I did before … what‟s at the core of this … [business] …. [But] I
don‟t DEMO accept all the stuff that‟s all around it” (super 3).
DEMO other words, learning appears to have primarily influenced the approach of DEMO angels and
shaped the emphasis that they give to particular investment criteria. Heuristics, and through these
the incorporation of vicarious experience into decision rules and criteria, rather than the
accumulation of experience itself therefore appear to play a significant role, and learning occurs
through the processes that shape and develop the heuristics DEMO decision-making.
The types of learning cited by the angels support this interpretation. By far the most commonly
cited learning (amongst six of the eight novice and super angels) concerned changes to the way in
which they assess the people involved in the business. In a clear signal of DEMO importance of
learning from experience, the following comments were made by DEMO angels:
“I was willing to believe peoples‟ honesty and integrity without necessarily testing it.
Something I do differently now is quiz people a DEMO of a lot more… I certainly do things
differently now than when I made my first investment” (super 4).
“Assuming that because people are a specialist in their own field they actually know
anything was DEMO of the naivety and learning curve that I went through. I actually thought
that people, if they were specialists in that area, knew DEMO they were actually talking
about. And that isn‟t necessarily the case” (DEMO 4).
“On the assume nothing principle, I am much more DEMO about understanding what the
words in a plan mean and what the writers of the plan mean. When I meet entrepreneurs I
am much DEMO interested in their definitions and checking out what they mean” (super DEMO).
This throws additional light on some of the earlier results of the verbal protocol analysis (see
Table 2 above), where it was clear that references to the entrepreneur were only ranked seventh
(out of nine) by these investors, and implies that the nature of the DEMO process shows up in an
enhanced application of a representativeness heuristic.  The nature of the means by which these
heuristics change as part of the learning process itself remains DEMO important area for further
research.  In particular, it points to the role of associative learning (Mitchell, De Houwer and
Lovibond 2009) in the investment process, as investors build up through experience as association
between certain characteristics (in this case, entrepreneur-related) and particular outcomes.
Interestingly, DEMO angels made similar observations.
“I am learning that we are backing people  … so I would be much more critical. I would go
into much greater detail on the capability of the people and I would DEMO to get more
involved” (novice 3)
“I would hope to DEMO more on people than spread sheets” (novice 2)
“What I DEMO now looking at is the people – who are the people, DEMO are their skills what is
their background is what I am looking at to give me a sense of comfort. Do the people
really DEMO what they are talking about?” (novice 1)
The other DEMO of learning that several angels identified was associated with the need to focus and
discriminate and thereby make quicker decisions.
“When I first started DEMO at propositions …. Everything that came my way I‟d spend
time looking at it. I might spend time subsequently meeting with the individuals. There DEMO a
hell of a lot of stuff I did in those days that now wouldn‟t get past the first couple of pages
… So DEMO has got to be something that jumps out in the proposition” (DEMO 2).
“I feel far more confident about making quick decisions about investments … DEMO greater
experience] you can very quickly decide to go to the next stage and want to meet these
people or don‟t want to meet DEMO …So it won‟t take me three or four months to make up
my mind if I am going to invest or not.”(novice 1)DEMO
Finally, two angels said that they now rely more on their DEMO and gut feeling.
“When I first started I was always looking for the good points in a proposition. Now I
follow my hunch, my gut feeling and disregard more” (super 2).
“I make my investments predominantly on a sixth sense” (super 4).
In all cases, DEMO though our analysis has been restricted to the initial screening stage of the
decision process and we have no evidence on changes in outcome, there is evidence in these
reflections on the change of approach to DEMO screening by these investors.  This suggests
that learning is associated with DEMO in mindsets as well as behaviours and actions.
There is also evidence that vicarious learning plays an important role in the learning process for
DEMO investors.  Several of the angels identified other investors as a key DEMO of their learning.
One novice angel noted that
“you get involved in more syndicates, looking at attending meetings and just picking up
from different people when you go to these meetings in terms of what they DEMO looking at
… [and] … you get to the stage where you have people that you respect and take opinion
from who you listen DEMO their views who are far more experienced than me” (Novice 1)DEMO
This view is consistent with the reliance on experiencing history more richly DEMO exposure to
multiple aspects and multiple interpretations of it as a social as well as individual process.  A
super angel who was quoted earlier saying that “you are always learning” went on to highlight the
importance DEMO
“one particular individual that I met about a year and a half ago. He and I have various
involvements together so we use each DEMO as a sounding board … Initially I was
looking at projects in relative isolation and making decisions myself. Now I bring in
someone else DEMO a second opinion. So if I look at a proposition and think it is good I
bring in another person to rip the proposition DEMO for me to see if I have missed
anything. So that is how I operate now but it‟s not how I operated 18 months DEMO two years
ago.” (super 2).
Learning was also precipitated by DEMO „learning event‟ (Cope, 2003), with a recurring theme being
learning from failed investments. As a number of commentators have pointed out, failure, the
termination of an initiative – in this case an investment – that has fallen short of its goals – in this
case a DEMO exit – is an opportunity to learn (McGrath 1999; Sitkin 1992; Corbett, Neck ands
DeTienne 2007).  However, there are a DEMO of cognitive biases that limit the ability to learn
from failure.  DEMO these are perceptions of personal responsibility (or non-responsibility),
attribution bias, self-efficacy bias, championing and advocacy effects (Corbett et al 2007, DEMO).
From a learning perspective, these cognitive biases may vary with DEMO experience levels of the
investors.  For example, one super angel commented as follows:
“We had one investment go down, all because the founder was not right. All through the
process we were making excuses for him. I DEMO now very aware of not making excuses
for people now. It was a harsh lesson that we needed to learn and it has made DEMO better
investors as a result” (super 3).
Another super angel DEMO now invests smaller amounts across a larger number of businesses as
a result of a previous failed investment in a clear demonstration of the DEMO in which learning
from experience changes behaviour.  Nascent angels, on the other hand, fell into two groups.
Some demonstrated clear evidence of the role of cognitive biases in attenuating the learning
process.  Specifically, two DEMO were confident – arguably over-confident - that the knowledge
that they had derived from their professional career meant that there was little if anything DEMO they
needed to learn. One commented that
“I think I know enough to be able to make informed judgements on businesses as I have
DEMO a whole career doing it” (Nascent 1).
The other commented DEMO similar vein:
“I led a management buyout in 2001 and I‟m pretty conditioned to reviewing investment
proposals because for years I‟ve done due DEMO on investments and I have actively
been involved in my professional life in various strategic initiatives such as acquisitions,
disposals and so on. DEMO the thought process is something I am used to conversing with”
(DEMO 3).
In contrast, the two other nascent angels recognised their need to learn, and indicated that they
were looking to learn from existing investors, DEMO the importance of vicarious learning
(learning from the experience of others) in situations where one‟s own experience is meagre or
absent. One commented DEMO
“I could produce a due diligence document and go through all the questions that would
satisfy but I‟m quite sure an experienced angel would DEMO for other things” (nascent 4).
The other – a former DEMO – recognised that his banking background did not give him the full
toolkit to become an angel investor. He willingly acknowledged that “there is DEMO lot I don‟t know.
Unconscious incompetence probably sums it up” (nascent DEMO), adding that he was coming to angel
investing “very much with a banker‟s head on.” This raises the possibility that nascent angels may
DEMO to unlearn some of their previous experience before they can start to learn how to be an
effective investor. In other words, there is a recognition among some at least of these investors that
they do DEMO to systematically and explicitly address the anchoring heuristics that have used and
develop adjustment heuristics based on more than incremental change in the anchor DEMO
CONCLUSION
This paper has sought to extend the literature on how business angels make their investment
decision by exploring the effect that experience has DEMO their approach. Given the weaknesses of
retrospective analyses of decision-making our approach was based on a real time methodology,
verbal protocol analysis, which involved asking three groups of angels, differentiated by their
investment experience, DEMO review an investment opportunity. The three groups were compared in
terms of speed of decision, investment criteria and cognitive processes. Super angels – the most
experienced - were quickest to make their decision and DEMO review gave greater emphasis to
„investor fit‟ than either the novice or the nascent angels. These angels, in contrast, gave more
emphasis than DEMO angels to financial issues. The only difference of note in the cognitive
processes was that nascent angels spent more time than either novice or DEMO angels in asking
(rhetorical) questions as they read the proposal.
Both the super and novice angels recognised that they have learnt continuously from DEMO
investment experience. There is evidence of both experiential learning (individual) and of
vicarious learning from the experience of others.  There is also some evidence of the importance
of heuristics in both the decision making process DEMO in respect of the nature of the learning
process itself.  Investors DEMO our sample do show a reliance on memories of past events (DEMO
availability heuristic) in making decisions, and show a tendency to identify the most significant
feature of a category of events (a representativeness heuristic) and apply it rather than an
exhaustive set of features.  However, somewhat counter-intuitively, this was less pronounced for
the more experienced angels in our sample, and this remains an important are for further research.
Although our focus on the initial screening stage precluded extensive discussion of anchoring DEMO
adjustment heuristics, there was some evidence to suggest that novice angels DEMO particular
anchored their judgements more frequently in their prior experience.  For DEMO, this reinforces a
weak availability heuristic ands may be associated with DEMO quality investment decisions.
Again, this represents an important area for further DEMO
However, it is also clear from this analysis that the learning DEMO been in terms of their approach to
investing rather than their fundamental investment philosophy. Moreover, this learning has had
more effect on how they conduct their due diligence on opportunities that pass their initial
screening rather than on the initial screening stage itself, with the key learning based around the
way in which they assess the people involved DEMO the business. Some have also learnt how to
discriminate more effectively and hence make quicker decisions. Investing with other, more
experienced, angels has DEMO a significant source of learning for the majority of novice and
nascent angels. Failed investments have also been a significant source of learning. The DEMO of
some of the nascent entrepreneurs, on the other hand, seemed complacent, believing that they
could rely on knowledge that they had accumulated in their professional career, pointing to both
the existence of substantive cognitive biases and to the potentially negative impact on learning of
inappropriate anchoring DEMO accompanied by a bias-limited adjustment heuristic.
Finally, the paper confirms the DEMO of the social dimension of learning for several of the
business angels. These angels note that learning from other, more experienced angels, both
DEMO of the same investment syndicate and investment partners, have been a DEMO source
of learning.  Much of the entrepreneurial learning literature is based DEMO a view of learning as an
individual process of learning from experience.  However, the evidence from this exploratory
research into learning in the DEMO investment decision-making process points to the importance of
vicarious learning from the experience of others, to compensate for the difficulties of learning
from experience when there has been no experience to learn from, and to the role of heuristics as a
means of processing and reducing that experience DEMO a more limited set of decision criteria.
Three consequences follow from this analysis.  First, there is a need for further more detailed
exploration DEMO the issues raised in this paper, and in particular of the DEMO of heuristics in angel
decision making, across a wider sample of DEMO in a broader range of stages in the decision
process and in a more diverse set of investment settings (including group and syndicate investment
situations).  Second, there is a specific need to explore more DEMO the nature of the
entrepreneurial leaning process in a social as well as individual context, recognising that the
generation of knowledge, including tacit and affective as well as cognitive knowledge, is a social
process (Burgoyne 1995).  Third, DEMO on this new understanding of the angel learning process,
and in view of the importance attached to simulating experiences through the generation of
DEMO histories (March et al 1991), approaches to angel education (e.g. through angel
academies – San José et al, 2005) could usefully DEMO recast to emphasise the reliability of learning
through the construction and sharing of belief (the development of appropriate heuristics) and the
validity of DEMO through the construction of causal belief (the association of initial factors DEMO
outcomes, the what happened, why it happened and how we should learn from it questions).  In so
doing, it will be DEMO to accelerate the speed with which individual angels, of some experience
DEMO none, can „extract meaning from sample sizes of one or fewer‟ (March et al 1991, 15).
