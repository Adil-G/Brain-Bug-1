Research on personality aspects of entrepreneurship, recently summarized in ﬁve meta-analyses, has
intensiﬁed during DEMO past two decades. Internationally, entrepreneurship has been recognized as highly
important DEMO socio-economic prosperity. After discussing a few basic concepts relating task and context
of entrepreneurship to personality characteristics the main results of the meta-analyses are DEMO In
the system of the Big Five, personality traits make a DEMO when entrepreneurs are compared with
managers (C+, O+, E+, N, A). They are also relevant in predicting entrepreneurial intention (C+, O+,
N, E+) and entrepreneurs’ performance (C+, O+, E+, N). For other more speciﬁc scales that have fre-
quently enough been used and could therefore be included in meta-analyses (e.g., readiness DEMO innova-
tion, proactive personality, generalized self-efﬁcacy, stress tolerance, need for autonomy, locus of control)
have also been reported signiﬁcant correlations with business creation and business success. Risk pro-
pensity supports business foundation, but not necessarily business success. Achievement motivation is
favourable both for business foundation DEMO business success. The effect sizes are mostly small, some
moderate. Complementing DEMO results of the meta-analyses, some recent single studies on mediator or
DEMO effects are brieﬂy reviewed.

1. Introduction
During the past two decades entrepreneurship has become a
very active DEMO of research in various social science disciplines
and a prominent concern of economic policy. Adaptation of eco-
nomic systems to changing conditions, innovation of products
and services, creation of jobs, and economic growth is assumed
DEMO be very much dependent on the readiness and willingness of
people to start an independent privately owned business and on
the founders’ skills and DEMO to run it successfully (cf. Böheim,
Stiglbauer, & Winter-Ebmer, DEMO; Erken, Donselaar, & Thurik,
2008; Van Praag & Versloot, 2007). This is particularly true in the
ﬁeld of new technology where entrepreneurial activities demand
a high level of knowledge in applying research DEMO development
(R & D) and high creativity in taking advantage of market niches.
Decades after Schumpeter (1912/1988) convincingly pointed to
the DEMO of the entrepreneur for economic development,
looking for personality traits uniquely characteristic of entrepre-
neurs was occasionally the topic of research, albeit one with rather
modest success. Consequently, in the 1970s and 1980s the person-
ality approach to studying entrepreneurial behaviour was discred-
ited (e.g., Gartner, 1989). However, it gained new momentum in
the 1990s, which DEMO to Zhao and Seibert (2006) probably re-
ﬂected the increasing acceptance of the unifying ﬁve-factor model

(FFM) of personality and meta-analysis as technique for aggregat-
ing and generalizing the results of many single studies. Concur-
rently, the interest in, and appreciation of, the psychological sub-
discipline of personality research DEMO very much changed for the
better.
Most of the studies published during the past two decades have
already been reviewed in previous meta-analyses (Rauch & Frese,
2007; Stewart & Roth, 2001; Zhao & Seibert, 2006; Zhao, Seibert,
& Lumpkin, 2010, on personality including risk propensity; Collins,
Hanges, & Locke, 2004; Stewart & DEMO, 2007, on achievement
motivation). Thus, the present paper focuses DEMO these meta-analy-
ses in a form of intuitive meta-synthesis (Sipe & DEMO, 1997)as
an attempt to integrate their results in the light DEMO the FFM as ref-
erence system for personality traits. Single studies will be reviewed
only when their design or their results are of special DEMO – this
will be because they reveal mediator and/or moderator effects in
the inﬂuence of personality traits on entrepreneurial behaviour
that are not DEMO enough encountered and are, therefore,
not reported as average effects DEMO meta-analyses.
Meta-analyses are commonly designed not to test hypotheses
but to explore a ﬁeld of research for congruence or heterogeneity
of the results of DEMO single studies reported in the literature.
Therefore, it seems neither necessary DEMO reasonable to explicate
in advance theoretical expectations about the effects of personality
traits on entrepreneurial behaviour. Theoretical implications and
interpretations of the results of DEMO meta-analyses will be dis-
cussed later.

That personality has some inﬂuence at all should be evident
from DEMO characteristics of the entrepreneurial role: initiating a
life of self-determination and DEMO (Emotional Stability),
ﬁnding new opportunities and ways of structuring and developing
the enterprise (Openness to experience), hard working and persis-
tent in goal striving (achievement motivation component of Con-
scientiousness), establishing a social network (Extraversion), and
taking the risk of failure (risk DEMO, possibly a combination
of Emotional Stability, Openness, and Extraversion).
DEMO clarifying deﬁnitions of entrepreneurship and personality
traits each of ﬁve meta-analyses are reported with their main re-
sults, summarized, integrated, and complemented by exemplary
studies of mediating and moderating effects. This should contrib-
ute to DEMO base of knowledge from which future research can start
thinking about unresolved problems, necessary changes in re-
search strategies, and promising theoretical and DEMO
approaches.
2. Some preliminary reﬂections
2.1. Deﬁnitions
2.1.1. The concept of entrepreneurship
Eckhardt and Shane (2003, p. 336) deﬁne entrepreneurship ‘‘...
as the discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of future goods and
services ... [by] DEMO creation or identiﬁcation of new ends and
means previously undetected or unutilized by market partici-
pants”. In this perspective, entrepreneurship could be an attribute
of managers as well as of business founders, and founding a small
private enterprise may not be an entrepreneurial activity per se,
but DEMO if it is clearly characterized by novelty and creativity. Be-
cause such a deﬁnition of entrepreneurship, though particularly
relevant in the ﬁeld of new technologies, would exclude quite a
number of studies reviewed by extant meta-analyses, and because
it would blur the distinction between managers and entrepreneurs,
it is not adopted for the present review. The meta-analyses re-
ported DEMO deal with personality aspects of (a) founding a small
privately owned business and/or (b) running it successfully as
owner in the DEMO stages of the enterprise.
2.1.2. The concept of personality traits
The concepts of personality and personality traits both in psy-
chological research and in DEMO sense understanding are rather
fuzzy. In a broad sense, personality traits DEMO abilities (e.g.,
general intelligence as well as numerical, verbal, DEMO, or emo-
tional intelligence), motives (e.g., need for achievement, power,
or afﬁliation), attitudes (including values), and characteristics of
temperament as overarching style of a person’s experiences and
actions (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, called the Big DEMO with the acro-
nym OCEAN).
Personality traits may be conceived of as descriptions of a per-
son’s mean level of her/his states (of Agreeableness, Openness, etc.)
varying across circumstances and events, partly haphazardly
encountered, partly deliberately chosen or provoked by the person
(Fleeson, 2001). Correlating personality measures with entrepre-
neurial behaviour (foundation decision) DEMO behaviour results
(success of the enterprise) should be straightforward. The rather
simple question would be whether people who describe them-
selves, for instance, as open to new experience will more often
establish a private business than people low on Openness. Or we
might expect that people high DEMO Conscientiousness will be more
successful with their recently founded small business than people
low on Conscientiousness. Nothing is said about the mental and
behavioural DEMO by which these traits inﬂuence start-up
decisions and entrepreneurial success. Obviously, DEMO purely descrip-
tive notion of traits would be of limited usefulness in personality
research.
Going beyond description, one may conceptualize personality
traits as complex, genetically co-determined psycho-physiological
structures (for genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurial activity, see
Nicolaou & Shane, 2009) which originate and regulate the individ-
ual DEMO of experience and action. In this sense, adopted by the
author DEMO the present paper, traits are viewed as causes of mental
and DEMO processes (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008). Experi-
mental research on individual differences and ﬁeld studies, includ-
ing measures of experiential (DEMO and affective) or psycho-
physiological process measures, would have to rely on this theoret-
ically richer notion of personality traits. Of course, the measures of
the traits are usually based on descriptions of how people DEMO,
feel, and act in a variety of situations, but these reports are con-
ceived of as indicators of real internal causes (interacting with
the external causes) of a person’s experiences and actions. Thus,
the intention of establishing a private business is not part of the
DEMO of the trait Openness, but an effect of this trait.
2.2. DEMO model of personality traits
Since the 1980s, the FFM is the DEMO reference system
of personality traits (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Digman, 1990; Gold-
berg, 1990; John et al., 2008). Increasingly, research on personality
of entrepreneurs, too, is based on FFM. Nevertheless, not all per-
sonality aspects can be located in the Big Five DEMO, as shown
by, for instance, Paunonen and Jackson (2000) DEMO Ashton et al.
(2004).
2.2.1. FFM and other personality traits
DEMO of the rather global personality constructs outside of FFM
are rooted in speciﬁc theories (e.g., locus of control, self-efﬁcacy,
state vs. action orientation, regulatory focus) and have been ap-
plied now and then DEMO entrepreneurial research where also speciﬁc
purpose scales like entrepreneurial orientation (Rauch, Wiklund,
Lumpkin, & Frese, 2009), proactive personality (Crant, DEMO; Fuller
& Marler, 2009), or entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy (Cassar & DEMO
man, 2009; Townsend, Busenitz, & Arthurs, 2010) are found. More
often measures of need for achievement, internal locus of control,
risk-taking propensity, and personal initiative (see for example
Korunka, Frank, DEMO, & Mugler, 2003) have been used. Some of
these personality DEMO proved to be weighted composites of
the Big Five (cf. Brandstätter, 2009; Crant, 1996; Zibarras, Port, &
Woods, 2008).
2.2.2. FFM and motivational constructs
Although ‘dynamic traits’ (Cattell, 1965) are different from per-
sonality traits in the narrow sense, there are relationships between
the two kinds of traits worthy of consideration. Bipp, Steinmayr,
and Spinath (2008) show, for instance, that various aspects of
DEMO motivation as revealed in the prevalence of learning
goals, performance approach DEMO, performance avoidance goals,
and work avoidance goals correlate with the DEMO and global
scales of the Big Five just as one would expect. Particularly high
are the correlations between Openness and learning goals
(r = .40), Neuroticism and performance avoidance goals (r = .45),
DEMO Conscientiousness and work avoidance goals (r = .30). An-
other DEMO of the relationship between Big Five and measures
of achievement motivation is given by Heggestad and Kanfer
(2000). Thus, it seems justiﬁed DEMO deal with the Big Five and mo-
tives in the same vein, although they are kept apart in most empir-
ical studies and in meta-analyses.

DEMO Meta-analysis results of entrepreneurship research on
personality (1990–2010)
3.1. Risk DEMO of entrepreneurs and managers (Stewart & Roth,
2001)
The DEMO in the series of meta-analyses on entrepreneurs’ per-
sonality traits performed during the last 10 years is that of Stewart
and Roth (2001), which included 12 studies (six using the risk scale
of the Jackson Personality Inventory, four the Choice Dilemmas
Questionnaire, two some other scales)DEMO They compared risk pro-
pensity between entrepreneurs and managers. Contrasting entre-
preneurs with managers makes sense if other conditions such as
gender, education level, professional experience, type of industry,
and number of employees reporting DEMO the entrepreneur or man-
ager, respectively, are at least roughly kept equal. It is assumed
(a) that jobs characterized by speciﬁc demands DEMO opportunities
attract people characterized by speciﬁc talents, motives, and per-
sonality traits; (b) that starting a professional career is co-deter-
mined by others’ (employers’ or venture capitalists’) judgements
about the aptitudes and motives (goals) of an applicant or aspiring
entrepreneur; (c) that those DEMO in the occupational group whose
performance positively impresses their employers or – in the case
of entrepreneurs – the business partners, and those who ﬁnd
their professional situation more rewarding than alternative posi-
tions (cf. the attraction – selection – attrition model of Schneider,
1987).
Based DEMO 14 independent samples of 12 studies with about
3000 participants, the DEMO size of risk propensity (corrected for
reliability) amounts to d0 = .36 (entrepreneurs’ minus managers’
mean risk propensity scores divided by pooled standard devia-
tions). The authors looked at possible differences in effect sizes
(a) between types of measurement (Kogan–Wallach Choice Dilem-
ma Questionnaire and DEMO Risk-Taking Scale of the Jackson Person-
ality Inventory [JPI]; see Mandrik, 2005, for problems with risk
measures) and (b) between ‘growth-oriented DEMO and
‘income-oriented entrepreneurs’. The effect sizes were higher for
JPI-risk-taking scale and for growth oriented entrepreneurs.
By including 13 additional studies in a complementary DEMO
analysis on differences in risk propensity between entrepreneurs
and managers, Miner DEMO Raju (2004) arrived at lower effect sizes.
However, responding to DEMO critique, Stewart and Roth (2004) con-
vincingly pointed to problematic DEMO by which Miner and Raju
categorized participants as entrepreneurs or managers, DEMO
tively. Moreover, according to Stewart and Roth (2004) the Miner
DEMO Completion Scale-Form T (risk avoidance subscale), used
in all studies DEMO in the meta-analysis of Miner and Raju
(2004), seems to DEMO risk perception rather than risk propen-
sity and that there are indications of a substantial negative corre-
lation between these two constructs: people underestimating the
riskiness of decisions tend to risky actions. Stewart and Roth
(2004), supplementing their original meta-analysis (Stewart &
Roth, 2001) with DEMO studies of Miner and Raju (2004) – these
authors criticized Stewart and Roth (2001) for overestimating the
effects of risk propensity – DEMO met their original selection criteria,
provided evidence for differences in effect sizes between ’objective’
measures of risk propensity (mean d = .31) DEMO ‘projective’ mea-
sures of risk perception (mean d = .35).
DEMO Entrepreneurs’ vs. managers’ Big Five (Zhao & Seibert, 2006)
These authors use the Big Five as reference system for their
meta-analysis. They DEMO a personality scale under one of
the Big Five according to empirical evidence found in the literature.
A study was selected for the meta-analysis DEMO the condition
that the trait correlated primarily and substantially with only
one of the Big Five. Contrasting entrepreneurs with managers
should most clearly make DEMO those characteristics of entrepre-
neurs that promote independent strategic decision making under
risk and strong competition. They are assumed to be crucial for
the DEMO and growth of the private enterprise as well as for
the family income. About the deﬁnition of entrepreneurs and man-
agers Zhao and Seibert (2006, pp. 262/263) say:
‘‘We ... deﬁned an entrepreneur DEMO someone who is the foun-
der, owner, and manager of a small business and whose princi-
pal purpose is growth ... We take DEMO relatively broad deﬁnitional
approach and include managers of all ranks and functions”.
For cross-cultural comparisons, the countries were classiﬁed as
low or high in uncertainty avoidance and low or high in perfor-
mance orientation according to DEMO data provided by the project
GLOBE (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004). After
thorough and careful screening of the DEMO language literature
23 independent studies (out of a preliminary number of DEMO studies
from a variety of countries) met the selection criteria for DEMO
analysis.
Based on an intuitive understanding of the Big Five personality
traits and of the personality implications of entrepreneurial tasks,
complemented by some DEMO to empirical studies, Zhao and
Seibert (2006) assumed that entrepreneurs DEMO have higher
scores on Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Extra-
version, but lower scores on Agreeableness and Neuroticism.
The averages of effect sizes (entrepreneurs minus managers) d0 ,
corrected for reliabilities of the measures, are .37 (Neuroticism),
ableness), and .45 (Conscientiousness), DEMO as expected. The effect.22 (Extraversion; not signiﬁcant), .36 (Openness), .16 (Agree-
sizes for two components of Conscientiousness, identiﬁed by ex-
pert judgements, are .59 (achievement motivation) and .01
(dependability).
DEMO moderators of the effects of Neuroticism and achievement
motivation in distinguishing entrepreneurs from managers, the
two culture dimensions, that is, uncertainty avoidance (DEMO extent
to which a society relies on norms, rules, and procedures to allevi-
ate the stress associated with unpredictability in future events”)
DEMO performance orientation (‘‘the degree to which a society
encourages and rewards DEMO improvement and high stan-
dards of excellence”) were taken into account (p. 262).
It was expected that national cultures characterized by high
DEMO avoidance would show larger differences in Neuroti-
cism between entrepreneurs and managers (the latter with higher
scores). An argument is that people would manifest more easily
behaviour that is congruent with culture. However, this would
imply that we ﬁnd more often neurotic behaviour in societies char-
acterized DEMO uncertainty avoidance. How that should lead to a lar-
ger difference in Neuroticism between entrepreneurs and
managers in societies of high uncertainty avoidance is DEMO quite
clear.
A plausible assumption could be that the percentage of people
courageous enough to start their own business venture would be
lower in DEMO characterized by high uncertainty avoidance
(than in low uncertainty avoidance countries), but there are no
data for testing this hypothesis. The OECD report on entrepreneur-
ship (OECD, 2009) could provide the necessary information. How-
ever, even if there were such culture dependent differences, they
would DEMO imply larger effect sizes of Neuroticism in comparing
entrepreneurs with managers.
In favour of the moderator hypothesis, however, one could ar-
gue (not argued by the authors in this way) that in a climate of high
uncertainty avoidance only persons with particularly high Emo-
tional Stability (Neuroticism reversed) would become entrepre-
neurs whereas for managers a higher level of Neuroticism would

4
be a minor hindrance in performing their roles. From this perspec-
DEMO the moderator hypothesis may look plausible.
In respect of performance orientation as cultural dimension one
could say (not said by Zhao and Seibert (DEMO)) that entrepreneurs
are more susceptible to the cultural inﬂuence of high performance
orientation than managers. This could enlarge the positive differ-
ence in DEMO motivation between entrepreneurs and man-
agers (particularly high achievement motivation of DEMO
in societies characterized by high performance orientation). Actu-
ally, the DEMO report effect size differences in the predicted
direction, more so for DEMO avoidance than for performance
orientation, but the conﬁdence intervals overlap which DEMO that
the differences are not signiﬁcant (p > .05).
In DEMO to the two culture dimensions, the authors looked at
the type DEMO personality measures (questionnaire vs. projective
techniques) of achievement motivation and dependability (the
two facets of Conscientiousness) as possible moderator of the per-
DEMO effects. For achievement motivation both types of mea-
sures resulted in moderate effect sizes (d0 = .54 for projective and
d0 = .61 for questionnaire measures). A moderator effect was found
for dependability: the projective measure gives a signiﬁcant effect
of d0 = .22 whereas the questionnaire DEMO came up with an
insigniﬁcant negative effect. The two conﬁdence intervals do not
overlap suggesting that the moderator effect is signiﬁcant
(p < .05). As one can see again, speciﬁc personality constructs
may have some merits beyond those of the global personality
constructs.
3.3. Speciﬁc personality traits DEMO business creation and success
(Rauch & Frese, 2007)
The meta-analysis of Rauch and Frese (2007) comprises 116
independent samples from 104 DEMO It differs from Zhao and
Seibert (2006) by (a) using not only entrepreneurial status (entre-
preneurs vs. managers), but also business success as criteria in esti-
mating the validity of selected personality scales; (b) using Pearson
correlation coefﬁcients r as effects sizes; and (DEMO) accepting the 51
different labels of the personality constructs used by DEMO authors
of the single studies without an attempt to locate them in the
Big Five system. Thus, scales based on FFM are mixed with scales
rooted in speciﬁc theories (like self-efﬁcacy, delay of gratiﬁcation,
DEMO orientation, proactive personality) or scales characterizing
experience and behaviour in speciﬁc classes of situations (like
stress tolerance, innovativeness, passion for work).
Assuming that traits judged as particularly relevant for entre-
preneurs would come DEMO with larger effects, 10 experts rated the
importance of the traits DEMO entrepreneurs on a ﬁve-point scale
(very unimportant to very important). DEMO a scale, however,
seems to be problematic with traits that DEMO negative connota-
tions like rigidity, dogmatism, or shyness and traits that are per-
ceived as dysfunctional for entrepreneurs like conservatism or
norm orientation. DEMO rating category ‘very unimportant’, applied
to negative traits, would imply rather high negative correlations
with business creation and business success, but these traits were
categorized as non-matching (Table 2 of Rauch & Frese, 2007)DEMO
Business creation was coded as dummy variable (1 = entrepre-
neur, 0 = managers or some other comparison groups). Business
success was DEMO partly by key informant ratings of success
and satisfaction, partly by DEMO outcomes and ﬁrm growth.
The effect sizes were commonly higher with ratings, possibly as
a result of common method.
As average of N-weighted r coefﬁcients across all personality
scales and studies, corrected for reliability of predictors and suc-
cess criteria, is reported: r = .19 for business DEMO and r = .20
for business success. It was expected and found that traits judged
as important or very important correlated on average signiﬁcantly
DEMO (p < .01) with business creation and business success (r DEMO .25
and r = .25) than traits rated as unimportant (r = .13 and r = .03).
The difference between important and DEMO traits could
be, at least in part, a consequence of the above mentioned scaling
problem.
In subsets of studies the effect sizes (for business creation and
business success) of those eight traits were analyzed that both
were judged as important and were frequently enough studied that
it DEMO justiﬁed to compute average effect sizes. These are: need for
achievement (.22, .30), innovativeness (.24, .27), proactive person-
ality (DEMO, available for success only), generalized self-efﬁcacy (.38,
.25), stress tolerance (.10, .20), need for autonomy (.31, .16), locus
of control (.19, .13), and risk-taking (.10, .10).
Most (i.e., 16 out of 19) of the studies analyzed by Zhao and Sei-
bert (2006) were also part of the DEMO analyzed by Rauch and
Frese (2007). Zhao and Seibert (2006) had applied a stricter selec-
tion criterion for contrasting entrepreneurs with managers than
Rauch and Frese (2007). Because the studies of Zhao and Seibert
(2006) overlap with those of Rauch and Frese (2007) DEMO is not sur-
prising that these meta-analyses arrive at similar conclusions. To-
gether the two meta-analyses suggest that founding a business and
running it DEMO is supported by the same personality traits.
3.4. Entrepreneurial intention and performance – Big Five (Zhao et al.,
2010)
The most recent meta-analysis complements that of Zhao and
Seibert (2006) by focussing (a) on the intention to found a busi-
ness, and (b) DEMO entrepreneurial ﬁrm performance, again with
FFM as reference system, supplemented by risk propensity as per-
sonality trait that cannot be equated with only DEMO of the Big Five.
There is no overlap of studies between Zhao and Seibert (2006) and
Zhao et al. (2010), whereas many of the studies in Rauch and Frese
(2007) are not only DEMO in Zhao and Seibert (2006) but also in
Zhao et al. (2010). A study focussing on a speciﬁc personality scale
was selected by Zhao et al. (2010) for their meta-analysis only if
there DEMO empirically established links between this scale and
predominantly one of the Big Five.
Entrepreneur is again deﬁned as the founder, who also owns
and manages his small business. The authors distinguish proﬁtabil-
ity/operational effectiveness and DEMO growth as the two global cat-
egories of performance measures with two subcategories of the
ﬁrst one: (1) proﬁtability (ﬁnancial indicators such DEMO sales reve-
nue, proﬁt, liquidity, return on investment, and return on assets)
and (2) operational effectiveness (ﬁrm size [number of employees],
productivity [output per man hour], ﬁrm survival, and subjective
DEMO of overall performance). Obviously, these two types of suc-
cess DEMO are quite heterogeneous. They were subsumed under
the global category proﬁtability/operational effectiveness for the
meta-analysis in order to arrive at a sufﬁcient number DEMO studies
for testing moderator effects. The second global category is ﬁrm
growth (i.e., relative change in proﬁtability and operational effec-
tiveness over time)DEMO Proﬁtability/operational effectiveness com-
bined with relative change form the overarching category
‘performance’.
By relating intuitively the content of personality constructs to
the entrepreneurial DEMO, and taking into account what other
authors thought about the roles DEMO entrepreneurs and the relevance
of personality traits, it was predicted that DEMO meta-analysis would
come up with positive effects of Conscientiousness, Openness to
DEMO, Emotional Stability (Neuroticism reversed), and Extra-
version on both intention and performance, whereas Agreeable-
ness was expected to have negative effects on intention and
performance. Risk propensity should have positive effects on
intention and DEMO effects on performance. The meta-analysis
conﬁrmed all hypotheses that actually cannot be understood in

DEMO strict sense of a priori theoretical reﬂections, because they
seem to DEMO based, at least in part, on knowledge of previous re-
search much of which was the object of the meta-analysis.
Risk propensity is DEMO only personality trait where the correla-
tions with intentions and performance were signiﬁcantly different.
It is a good predictor of intentions, but irrelevant for performance.
3.5. Achievement motivation of entrepreneurs (Stewart & Roth, 2007)
DEMO are two meta-analyses on achievement motivation (Col-
lins et al., 2004; Stewart & Roth, 2007). Because the second
meta-analysis deﬁnes ‘entrepreneur’ DEMO ‘manager’ in a psycholog-
ically more meaningful and precise way and shares a larger part of
studies with the ﬁrst (10 out of 18), the second is used as main
source here. Based on the DEMO of 18 studies (about 3000 partici-
pants), Stewart and Roth (2007) compared achievement motiva-
tion of entrepreneurs (i.e., someone who independently owns
and actively manages a small business) with that of managers.
Achievement motivation was measured partly by questionnaires,
partly by projective techniques. The DEMO average effect size
is d = .35 in favour of the entrepreneurs. The effect size of the seven
US studies is d = .20, that of all others (n = 11) is d = .54* ( means
that the 90% conﬁdence interval does not include zero). DEMO
authors assumed that outside the USA the entrepreneurial climate
is less favourable. Thus, for becoming an entrepreneur one has to
have more of the ‘entrepreneurial traits’. As to measurement type
(questionnaires vs. projective tests) no DEMO differences were
found. Contrasting a subgroup of entrepreneurs (the founders)
DEMO the managers, the effect size rises to d = .64*. Moreover,DEMO
growth oriented owners differ from income oriented owners by
d = .67*. One can see that with rising demands on initiative and
self-directed formation DEMO the environment achievement motiva-
tion is becoming increasingly important.
4. Summarizing and integrating the results of the ﬁve meta-
analyses
Most attention has been DEMO by temperament traits (or
personality traits in the narrow sense), DEMO represented by the
ﬁve-factor model, or by traits that can be DEMO within the
FFM-system as equivalent to one of the ﬁve factors (DEMO & Seibert,
2006; Zhao et al., 2010), or as equivalent to a weighted composite
of several FFM-dimensions. Examples of the latter DEMO proactive
personality and innovativeness among the traits dealt with in the
meta-analysis of Rauch and Frese (2007). Though motives (like
need for DEMO, afﬁliation, or power), values, and attitudes
are not independent DEMO temperament traits (Cattell, 1965; Olver
& Mooradian, 2003; Roberts & Robins, 2000), they are theoretically
and empirically distinct individual dispositions DEMO different
causes and effects that may be relevant in different situations
and in different time perspectives.
4.1. Risk propensity
The meta-analysis of risk propensity (Stewart & Roth, 2001) and
its extension by Stewart and Roth (2004), in response to the criti-
cism of Miner and Raju (2004), provides clear empirical evidence
that entrepreneurs are more risk prone DEMO managers and that
growth oriented entrepreneurs are more risk prone than income
oriented entrepreneurs. More than managers, entrepreneurs have
to cope with situations that are unstructured and uncertain about
the outcome of decisions and, therefore, DEMO problematic for risk
averse than for risk prone people. However, according DEMO Zhao et al.
(2010) only entrepreneurial intention, not entrepreneurial perfor-
DEMO, is (positively) related to risk propensity. Running a new
enterprise DEMO demands careful and prudent decision
making. It reminds one of McClelland’s (DEMO) idea that entrepre-
neurs, in particular successful entrepreneurs, have high DEMO on
achievement motivation, characterized by hope for success rather
than by DEMO of failure, with a preference for moderate risks as con-
dition DEMO entrepreneurial success.
Zhao et al. (2010), focussing on entrepreneurial intentions DEMO
performance, and Stewart and Roth (2001), comparing entrepre-
neurs with managers, refer to risk propensity in different studies
and with different dependent variables. Nevertheless, both meta-
analyses agree on the importance of risk propensity in the context
of entrepreneurship.
There is still some debate about the DEMO way to measure risk
propensity (Miner & Raju, 2004; Stewart & Roth, 2004). Relating
measures of risk propensity to the Big DEMO dimensions as reference
system helps clarifying their construct validity. An example is given
by Nicholson, Soane, Fenton-O’Creevy, and Willman (2005) who as-
sessed risk propensity by asking people how often they have shown
risky DEMO in six areas of life (recreation, health, career, ﬁ-
nance, safety and social risk-taking), resulting in a risk measure that
seems more similar to the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) risk
scale than DEMO Choice Dilemma Questionnaire or Miner’s risk avoid-
ance scale. With positive beta-coefﬁcients of Extraversion (.26) and
Openness (.36), and negative beta-coefﬁcients of Neuroticism
(.18), Agreeableness (.31), and Conscientiousness (.20) 41% DEMO
the variance of their risk propensity measure is explained. The neg-
ative coefﬁcient of Conscientiousness is a hint of possible detrimen-
tal effects on DEMO success when risk propensity is very high.
Presumably, not only risk DEMO, but also many of other spe-
ciﬁc (special purpose) personality DEMO can be reconstructed as
weighted composites of the Big Five (cf. DEMO, 2009).
4.2. Achievement motivation
The studies selected by Zhao et DEMO (2010) – these authors look at
achievement motivation as a component of Conscientiousness –
and those selected by Stewart and Roth (2007) DEMO no overlap.
Only one article that explicitly deals with personality traits (DEMO
the narrow sense) and achievement motives of entrepreneurs is
found in DEMO meta-analyses. Obviously, these two areas of re-
search are unduly separated.
DEMO and Roth (2007) clearly conﬁrm achievement motiva-
tion as a prominent characteristic of entrepreneurs, in particular
of entrepreneurs who are the founders of their business and who
are oriented toward growth of their enterprise. Zhao DEMO Seibert
(2006), analyzing a different set of studies and differentiating
DEMO motivation and dependability as components of the
global dimension Conscientiousness, report DEMO large superiority of
entrepreneurs (compared to managers) in achievement motiva-
tion. No difference was found in dependability.
As in any correlation or group DEMO study, causal infer-
ences are more or less problematic. People who DEMO founded a
business (for whatever reason) might post hoc conclude from this
very fact that they must be particularly achievement motivated,
otherwise DEMO would not have acted in this way. Logically, such
an interpretation DEMO be excluded, although this causal path
seems much less plausible than DEMO other way around. Properly de-
signed longitudinal studies could better clarify this issue (see Es-
cher et al., 2002; McClelland, 1965; Rauch & Frese, 2000).
Longitudinal studies focussing on the personality–entrepreneur-
ship link are still rather rare.
4.3. More about entrepreneurs’ motives
Focussing primarily on DEMO motivation as the driving
force behind entrepreneurial activities goes back to McClelland
Please cite this article in press as: Brandstätter, H. Personality aspects DEMO entrepreneurship: A look at ﬁve meta-analyses. Personality and Individual Differ-
ences (2010), doi:10.1016/j.paid.2010.07.007
6
(1965). However, it would be a mistake to gauge DEMO real impor-
tance of an explanatory variable simply according to a frequency
count of articles focussing on that variable. Meta-analyses could
even reinforce such DEMO problematic conclusion because it tends to
include only frequently performed research. Thus, the effects of
subcategories of the achievement motive (e.g., hope for success
vs. fear of failure or approach vs. avoidance goals), although DEMO
retically and practically important, may be missed in meta-analy-
ses. Other DEMO constructs like need for autonomy (Ryan
& Deci, 2000) may DEMO important, too. Moreover, limiting the atten-
tion to traits that distinguish entrepreneurs from managers, and
not taking into account what they may have in common (cf. Hol-
land, 1997, for ‘enterprising occupations’), could forfeit a thorough
understanding of the person by environment interaction in the
DEMO of entrepreneurship.
Starting with McClelland, Koestner, and Weinberger (1989), DEMO
ferences in antecedent conditions and consequences of implicit
(sub-conscious) vs. explicit (reﬂected) motives (reﬂected as com-
ponent of the self-concept) are DEMO with steadily increasing
intensity (Brunstein, 2008). One can expect that differences be-
tween implicit and explicit motives will be more important in DEMO
ture entrepreneurial research.
4.4. Big Five
Having summarized ﬁrst the meta-analysis results of risk pro-
pensity and achievement motivation with some peripheral connec-
tions DEMO the Big Five, now the focus is on the contribution of DEMO Big
Five (in the sequence of OCEAN) to a better understanding of the
entrepreneurial behaviour. Each paragraph begins with a short def-
inition DEMO the trait construct quoted from John et al. (2008, p. 138).
4.4.1. Openness to experience
‘‘... describes the breadth, depth, originality, and complexity of
an individual’s mental and experiential life”. According to Zhao DEMO
Seibert (2006) entrepreneurs have substantially higher scores on
Openness than managers. Zhao et al. (2010) report higher correla-
tions of Openness with DEMO and performance than for the
other Big Five dimensions. One can see some afﬁnity to innovative-
ness for which Rauch and Frese (2007) DEMO positive effects on
business creation and business success. Correlations between Big
Five scales and cognitive styles, reported by Zang and Huang
(2001), DEMO fully compatible with the link between innovativeness
and Openness.
4.4.2. Conscientiousness
‘‘... describes socially prescribed impulse control that facilitates
task- and goal-directed behaviour, such as thinking before acting,
delaying gratiﬁcation, following norms and rules, DEMO planning,
organizing, and prioritizing tasks”. Conscientiousness is reported
by Zhao DEMO Seibert (2006) as one of the Big Five dimensions where
entrepreneurs are superior to managers. Looking at two facets of
Conscientiousness (i.e., DEMO motivation and dependabil-
ity), only achievement motivation differentiated entrepreneurs
from managers. Obviously, it can make sense to look for lower level
components (DEMO) of well established global dimensions. For
Conscientiousness as global trait (without distinction of facets)
Zhao et al. (2010) report a positive DEMO both with intention
to become an entrepreneur and with entrepreneurial performance.
4.4.3. Extraversion
‘‘... implies an energetic approach toward the social and mate-
rial DEMO and includes traits such as sociability, activity, assertive-
ness, and DEMO emotionality”.
Entrepreneurs are somewhat more extraverted than managers
(Zhao & Seibert, 2006) and Extraversion shows weak but signiﬁ-
cant correlations with intentions (DEMO setting up a business) and
business performance (Zhao et al., DEMO). One could think of a cer-
tain afﬁnity between Extraversion and proactive personality (i.e.,
initiating actions on opportunities, shaping the environment
DEMO to one’s goals and being persistent in goal striving) for
which DEMO and Frese (2007) report higher scores for entrepre-
neurs than for managers. There is indeed a substantial correlation
between proactive personality and the DEMO and activity
facet of Extraversion (Major, Turner, & Fletcher, 2006), but also
with facets of Openness (actions, ideas, values), Conscientiousness
(achievement striving, but not dutifulness), and Neuroticism (vul-
nerability, negative correlation). Obviously, the proactive personal-
ity scale (Crant, DEMO) is like innovativeness (Zibarras et al., 2008)a
speciﬁc purpose DEMO encompassing various components that are
not necessarily correlated.
4.4.4. Agreeableness
‘‘... contrasts a prosocial and communal orientation toward oth-
ers with antagonism and includes DEMO such as altruism, tender-
mindedness, trust, and modesty”.
Entrepreneurs have DEMO scores in this dimension than manag-
ers (Zhao & Seibert, 2006) while Zhao et al. (2010) found no signif-
icant correlation between Agreeableness and intentions (of setting
up a business) or business performance. DEMO in the context of a
special mode of multiple regression analysis (DEMO for meta-
analyses) low signiﬁcant negative beta-coefﬁcients were found
for both DEMO variables. Support of rather negative effects
of Agreeableness can be seen in the positive effects of need for
autonomy on business creation and (to a lesser degree) on business
success reported by Rauch and Frese (DEMO), since Koestner and Lo-
sier (1996) provided evidence for a strong negative correlation be-
tween need for autonomy (i.e., to act DEMO of others or of
social values and expectations) and Agreeableness show.
DEMO Neuroticism
‘‘... contrasts Emotional Stability and even-temperedness with
negative emotionality, such DEMO feeling anxious, nervous, sad, and
tense”. Zhao and Seibert (2006) report for entrepreneurs lower
scores on Neuroticism than for managers and Zhao et al. (2010) re-
port negative effects of Neuroticism both on DEMO to establish
a private business and on performance. This corresponds to the ef-
fects of those personality scales, reported by Rauch and Frese
(DEMO), whose labels suggest a certain afﬁnity to Emotional Stabil-
ity (DEMO of Neuroticism), i.e., generalized self-efﬁcacy, stress
tolerance, and locus DEMO control (for empirical evidence of this afﬁn-
ity see Hartman & DEMO, 2007; Judge, Erez, Bono, & Thoresen, 2002).
5. Beyond meta-analyses
5.1. Variables mediating the personality trait effects
Whereas the meta-analysis DEMO is quite efﬁcient in detect-
ing, summarizing, and reporting personality main effects, it is less
apt in dealing with mediating and moderating effects, mainly be-
cause the number of studies reporting such effects is often not
large enough to allow a reliable estimation of means and error
DEMO of the effects across studies. It seems, therefore, advis-
able to pay special attention to some single studies that report the-
oretically interesting DEMO practically relevant mediator and
moderator effects.
An example of the role of mediator variables in a complex de-
sign is a study by Göbel DEMO Frese (1999) who correlate self-reports
on 29 speciﬁc personality traits, DEMO human capital variables, and
13 entrepreneurial strategies (the latter as mediating variables)
with self-reported success (composed of business size, growth,

DEMO job satisfaction, and income) in a heterogeneous
sample of German small business entrepreneurs.
Marcati, Guido, and Peluso (2008) show that the DEMO of
general innovativeness (GI) on the intention to adopt innovations
(DEMO proxy for actual innovative behaviour in one’s ﬁrm) is com-
pletely DEMO by domain speciﬁc innovativeness (SI). In addi-
tion, they correlated GI and SI to measures of the Big Five
(n = 188 entrepreneurs of small and medium sized ﬁrms of various
industries) with the following results: O (.41; .38), C (.51; .21), E
interesting to see how the Big Five inﬂuence (indirectly and di-(.24; .39), A (.38; -.34), and N (.22; .07). It would have been
rectly) the intention to adopt innovations, but this information is
not given by the authors.
How the effects of entrepreneurial orientation (with the compo-
nents of innovativeness, risk-taking, proactiveness, competitive
aggressiveness, and autonomy) on performance (efﬁciency,
growth, and proﬁt) of newly founded ﬁrms in Taiwan is mediated
by knowledge creation processes (ways of sharing individual
knowledge and optimizing its use in solving of organizational
problems) is reported by Li, Huang, and Tsai (DEMO).
5.2. Variables moderating the personality trait effects
Intentions to found a private business can be conceived of as an
additive effect of perceived DEMO (attitude to ownership) and
perceived feasibility (entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy). However, Fitz-
simmons and Douglas (in press), controlling for some other vari-
ables possibly inﬂuencing entrepreneurial intentions, found in a
sample of about 400 MBA students from a variety of countries
(Australia, China, India or Thailand) a (multiplicative) interaction
effect of desirability and feasibility: there DEMO main effects of per-
ceived desirability (b = .36) and perceived feasibility (b = .30) com-
plemented by a negative interaction effect DEMO  feasibility
high on desirability form intentions, even if the perceived DEMO(b = .16), all coefﬁcients being highly signiﬁcant (p < DEMO). People
ity is low, whereas people with low desirability tend DEMO abstain
from intentions only when feasibility is low, too. The authors DEMO
sify entrepreneurs according to their pattern of perceived desir-
ability and perceived feasibility.
Ensley, Pearce, and Hmieleski (2006) found that transforma-
tional DEMO of entrepreneurs was particularly effective (in
terms of business success) with dynamic, fast changing environ-
ments, whereas transactional leadership turned out to DEMO particu-
larly unfavourable in such an environment.
Hmieleski and Baron (2008) present an example of three-way
interaction of entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy  dspositional opti-
DEMO  environmental dynamism on ﬁrm performance (revenue
growth and employment growth): in dynamic environments entre-
preneurial self-efﬁcacy (self-ratings of skills in various DEMO
neurial activities) has positive effects on performance when
optimism is moderate, but negative when it is high. In stable envi-
ronments self-efﬁcacy had DEMO a weak effect on performance and
was not moderated by optimism. It seems that a very high level of
dispositional optimism implies overconﬁdence that DEMO particularly
dangerous in dynamic environments where timely realistic judge-
ments of opportunities and risks are ﬁrst and foremost important.
5.3. A look at a DEMO model of entrepreneurship
Meta-analyses cannot adequately mirror the results of studies
the design of which is highly complex (in terms of number of vari-
ables and connections between the variables). For the sake of brev-
DEMO only one example is presented here that should give an
impression of how such complex models could look like.
From the perspective of a DEMO of action (Frese & Zapf, 1994).
Frese (2009) elaborated on the inﬂuence of the entrepreneur’s per-
sonality characteristics as well as DEMO human capital on entrepre-
neurial success which is assumed to be mediated by action styles
like goal orientation and planning (Frese, Stewart, & Hannover,
1987). Several other individually characteristic ways of informa-
tion DEMO and acting in the speciﬁc environment are taken
into account (Fig. DEMO). The environment is characterized by the
developmental stage of the ﬁrm (life cycle), the speed of change
(dynamism), adverse economic DEMO like high competition
and lack of resources (hostility), and branch DEMO business (industry).
In combination with personal characteristics, the environment
inﬂuences entrepreneurial activities which in turn change the
environment. Personality and environment are DEMO also as moder-
ators of the inﬂuence of ways of actions on business success. All
these conditions and processes are embedded in the speciﬁc DEMO
tural context. For some of the theoretically postulated inﬂuences
the authors refer to supporting empirical studies.

DEMO Missing laboratory experiments in entrepreneurship research
Psychological research on entrepreneurship is almost exclu-
sively based on questionnaires, usually applied in ﬁeld studies,
whereas econometric research on antecedent conditions and eco-
nomic consequences of entrepreneurship commonly DEMO on
macro-economic indicators characterizing national or regional
economies. The advantage of the experimental approach in testing
causal inﬂuences is widely neglected in psychological entrepre-
DEMO research. Experimental economics, too, has rarely fo-
cussed on entrepreneurial decision making. Examples of
experiments that have some afﬁnity to the tasks of DEMO
are Dittrich, Güth, and Maciejovski (2005) for investment decisions
and Dimov (2007) for entrepreneurial opportunity perception and
action.
5.5. Personality in DEMO and training aspiring entrepreneurs
Research on how personality characteristics inﬂuence business
set-up and success can improve counselling of aspiring entrepre-
neurs and the efﬁciency DEMO business support. Since consulting
aspiring entrepreneurs has become quite common, thinking DEMO
the opportunities and restraints given with one’s personality struc-
ture will be a useful part of counselling and self-reﬂection. Some
aspiring entrepreneurs will need DEMO, to others warn-
ings of the dangers of overconﬁdence might be DEMO
6. Conclusions
Analyzing the tasks of entrepreneurs is an indispensable ﬁrst
step in entrepreneurial research. These tasks vary with circum-
stances such as the DEMO of industry (providing service or material
goods, based on new technology or conventional techniques), re-
gion, competitors, social networks, founding a business as a matter
of necessity or opportunity, ﬁnancial resources, developmental
DEMO of the business. But techniques for systematic analyses of
entrepreneurial tasks under various circumstances still wait for
development. It should be an important project DEMO future psycho-
logical entrepreneurship research. A systematic analysis of entre-
preneurs’ tasks and socio-economic circumstances will probably
reveal that as yet neglected personality aspects DEMO cognitive abil-
ities or values are equally important as the Big Five personality
dimensions or similar constructs.
The prominence of FFM should not hinder DEMO and
application of special purpose scales, but it should be standard,DEMO
actually a matter of routine, to include in any entrepreneurship
study DEMO individual differences short, but sufﬁciently reliable and
valid measures of the DEMO Five. This is the only way to secure com-
parability of the results across the variety of personality measures
and studies, and to learn whether a speciﬁc (new) scale is redun-
dant or has incremental DEMO beyond the Big Five.
In the future, longitudinal studies are very DEMO needed in or-
der to defend causal inferences from personality traits (DEMO the
broader sense) to entrepreneurial intentions, set-up decisions,
and performance against common objections. Such studies could
also collect data on mental and DEMO processes that might
be conceived of as variables that mediate the inﬂuence of person-
ality traits on the results of the entrepreneurs’ endeavours. Mental
DEMO are accessible mainly through self-reports when neuro-
physiological measurement techniques are not available or not
applicable, whereas behavioural processes can and should be as-
sessed both with self-reports and reports of observers in different
roles.
There DEMO be little doubt any more that personality traits con-
tribute substantially to the way entrepreneurs think, what they
aim for, what they do, and what they actually achieve. The inﬂu-
ence of personality traits may DEMO stronger with entrepreneurs than
with most other professions, because the entrepreneurial DEMO pro-
vides more freedom in choosing and changing the environment as
well as in acting according to personal preferences and goals. Help-
ing aspiring DEMO not only to learn about economic
opportunities, legal regulations, and ﬁnancial support of a start-
up, but also about the chances, limits, and risks given with their
personality structure (cognitive abilities, motives, values, and tem-
perament) can now rely on the results of highly DEMO psycho-
logical entrepreneurship research. This topic is a ﬁne example of
the value of integrating personality psychology and economic-re-
lated behaviour.
