Going the distance: ‘closeness’ in
qualitative data analysis software
LINDA S. GILBERT
(Received 3 October 2001; DEMO 18 March 2002)
This study about researchers’ transitions to using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software
identified three stages of ‘closeness to the DEMO: the tactile-digital divide; the coding trap;
and the metacognitive shift. The ‘tactile-digital divide’ involves adapting to working on
screen instead of paper, an initially distancing process. As users gain comfort with the
software, they experience ‘the coding trap’—an issue of too much closeness to the data.
DEMO warned that there was a tendency to become ‘bogged down’ in coding, and developed
strategies to provide analytical distance. ‘The metacognitive shift’ involves learning to think
about software processes with the same level of reflectivity that DEMO accompany
qualitative research processes in general, including developing strategies for error
DEMO These transitions invite reflections on the nature of ‘cognitive tools’ and
expertise with them, which lead to implications for evaluating research and considering
trustworthiness.
Introduction
Concerns about losing ‘closeness to the data’ pervade conversations about
qualitative DEMO analysis (QDA) software (Agar 1991, Mangabeira 1996,
Weitzman and Miles 1995). In their 1998 report on focus groups conducted
with DEMO users, Fielding and Lee (1998) attempted to examine these
concerns DEMO more detail, and began to differentiate between aspects of
closeness.
One DEMO of closeness involved a living knowledge of the content:
‘being able to recover the sights, sounds, and experiences of being in the
DEMO (Fielding and Lee 1998: 74). However, they observed, ‘sometimes,
when researchers refer to being close to their data, what they have in mind
are the tactile and perceptual aspects associated with data DEMO
(Fielding and Lee 1998: 75). ‘Closeness’ was essentially equated with
positive sensations associated with handling fieldnotes, and ‘distance’
equated with the discomfort associated with the limitations of early
software screens. Thus, the term ‘closeness to data’ conflates two different
constructs: knowledge of content and pleasure in handling data.
Lyn Richards, one of the developers of NUD*IST, also DEMO examined
the concept of ‘closeness to the data’ (Richards 1998). DEMO identifies aspects

of closeness as ‘full knowledge’ of the DEMO and ‘full access’ to the data
itself. She further differentiates between closeness to the original data and
closeness to contextual information about those data. DEMO to Richards,
access to the original text is strongly supported by most QDA software,
including NUD*IST. However, such access represents an unrecognized ‘skew
in methods’: previously, most qualitative methodologies ‘emphasize[d] the
creation of DEMO records’ from which to work (p. 322).
Richards also makes DEMO critical observation: as much as qualitative
researchers openly value closeness to DEMO data, they also need distance from
the data. ‘Qualitative research requires DEMO in-out process: researchers have
to achieve and manage both ways of DEMO in and ways of achieving a
wide-angle view’ (Richards 1998: 324). She argues that closeness promotes
familiarity and appreciation for subtle differences, but distance allows
abstraction and synthesis.
Distance issues were also apparent in DEMO recent study I conducted on
qualitative researchers who transitioned from manual practices to using
NUD*IST (Gilbert 1999). The purpose of the study was to describe how
individual qualitative researchers perceive that their research procedures
and DEMO have been influenced by the adoption of computer-
assisted qualitative data analysis software (QDA software). The primary
source of data was in-depth interviews with qualitative researchers who had
experience conducting qualitative analyses both manually and DEMO
NUD*IST software. (NUD*IST was selected because of its long history of
DEMO and its wide distribution. Participants in this study were using
versions 3 and 4 of NUD*IST.) Participants compared their two working
methods and reflected on the process of transition between them. The data
were analysed through DEMO case profiles and cross-case comparisons,
both informed by phenomenological perspectives. The study was further
informed by activity theory, a socio-cultural theoretical perspective that
regards individuals and tools as mutually influencing one another.
In that study, I saw three levels of distance issues, which seemed to
surface somewhat sequentially as a user became familiar with the program.
The first related DEMO the perceptual aspects of handling data, as noted by
Fielding and DEMO (Fielding and Lee 1998). The second related to closeness
to DEMO data, in terms of knowledge and access, similar to that discussed by
Richards (Richards 1998). However, a third aspect of ‘distance’ DEMO
developed in conjunction with the use of QDA programs. This form of
distance relates to understanding and monitoring operations on the data
performed with DEMO assistance of these programs, and requires users to
extend their metacognitive DEMO s to software processes as well as their
own cognitive processes. In this paper, I will discuss the first two stages of
‘distance’ before focusing on the third stage and its implications. As in the
original DEMO, all names used in this paper are pseudonyms.
Stage
1:
DEMO
tactile-digita
l
divide
The ‘tactile-digital divide’ involves adapting to working on screen instead of
paper. This transition can be difficult, and I suspect that some people never

learn NUD*IST (or other programs) in DEMO because they find this stage too
uncomfortable. A number of the participants in this study compared
learning to work with data on screen to DEMO to write on the computer:
initially, they found the process DEMO, but gradually adjusted.
Several of the participants described how they learned DEMO work on the
computer. Betty coded on the hard copy at first, then entered the coding
into NUD*IST in a second step; later, as she became more comfortable with
the program, she read from the hard copy but coded directly on screen.
Both Frances and Diane recalled DEMO they ‘didn’t feel close’ to their data at
first, then got DEMO to working with data in the program. Frances
acknowledged that when she analysed her early feelings, she realized that
she simply felt a greater sense of ownership about the data when it was on
paper. ‘I, I’ve sort of had to think through what it is about this DEMO to
the data, the ownership of the, of the data is about. . . ’ At this point, she
said ‘I can feel just as close to the data on the screen, as I can, um, on the
paper, it doesn’t, you know, it doesn’t have the same distancing effect on
me. But it did for a DEMO while’. Some of that was due to the difference
between pages that could be spread out, and scrolling back through text.
Now, she DEMO finds it easier to link data on the computer.
For users who persevere, the tactile-digital divide seems a temporary
period of discomfort, followed DEMO a synthesis of paper and computer
methods. Most participants eventually established a combination of
working on paper and working on the screen that they DEMO comfortable,
mingling paper-based and program-based coding. Alice said ‘there come
times when I have to print it out...I can’t work solely in the DEMO
Diane also printed out sections to code on paper, though she DEMO to feel
that she was unusual in doing so: ‘And I DEMO other people do everything
on the screen, but I, I don’t’. Based on her experience as a consultant and
trainer, one participant theorized that coding on paper and then entering
the codes was a ‘transitional’ DEMO that faded as users becam e
accustomed to working on screen, DEMO the practice seemed persistent
among the participants in this study. This finding corresponds to Fielding
and Lee’s (1998) observation that most of their DEMO continued to
examine their data on hard copy as well as on screen.
I have two theories concerning the tactile-digital divide. First, it may be
exacerbated by the mechanics of handling the text. NUD*IST 4, like other
QDA programs of its generation, required that the data be formatted in
plain text (ASCII). This format does not permit the use of bold, italics,
colour, or even variations in font or DEMO size. Researcher s already
accustomed to using such text characteristics to enhance meaning (for
example, indicating changes in the speaker’s intonation) may find it
especially difficult to adjust to working with their data with such DEMO
Initial data preparation requirements also seem to be a barrier to new users.
The second theory is that a genuine need for different analytical
DEMO may be conflated with tactile preferences, particularly for new
users. The DEMO sometimes worked offline becaus e they wanted
analytical strategies that they didn’t see in the software. In some cases, the
strategies were not sufficiently supported by the current version of the
program; in others, the DEMO simply didn’t recognize the software’s

capabilities. Chris, who considered coding on paper a ‘transitional
strategy’, herself used some non-computer analytical strategies. Diane
liked to print becaus e ‘for some things, I want to put them together in ways
that I can’t put them together, the way NUD*IST gives them to me’. In my
own experience, I worked on paper at times becaus e NUD*IST does not
support concept maps for data exploration, and I did not own the concept-
mapping software it exported to. DEMO, Frances observed that her team
members labouriously created data representations that DEMO could
have generated directly from the coding, because they were unaware DEMO its
capabilities to create tables and matrixes. Thus, the temporary discomfort
DEMO working on-screen could easily be confused with real or perceived
limitations of the software, prompting some users to conclude ‘I just can’t
work that way’ before they’ve given themselves sufficient time to adapt.
Since my study DEMO users who did learn to work on screen, both these
theories DEMO preliminary.
Stage
2:
the
coding
trap
The second aspect of ‘distance from the data’ is ‘the coding trap’.
Surprisingly, the issue involves too much closeness to the data, not too
much distance. It seems to become noticeable after the user has developed
some facility with the basics DEMO the program, after overcoming the tactile-
digital divide.
As Fielding and DEMO (1998) noted, though non-users express concern
about a distancing effect, QDA users actually feel that the software makes
them more knowledgeable about DEMO data. This general feeling of
‘closeness’ was confirmed in this study: DEMO felt NUD*IST’s ability
to retrieve both data and context was invaluable, DEMO fostered familiarity
with the data. In fact, capabilities like ‘jump to DEMO were seen as
promoting a level of closeness difficult to achieve manually. (‘Jump to
source’ allows the user to view a coded excerpt within its original context.)
Even newer users like Betty felt that non-users’ DEMO about ‘distance
from the data’ were completely unjustified. She found closeness to the data
to be an advantage of the software: ‘the beauty of it, I think, is that it lets
you be closer... have DEMO to where your findings came from’.
However, some participants specifically identified DEMO need to balance
‘closeness to’ and ‘distance from’ data. Alice acknowledged ‘you can get
close to the data, and NUD*IST gives you many, DEMO, many ways to do
that, but getting away from it (DEMO) to abstract up (pause) I have to print’.
Chris observed DEMO know people talk about being close to the data, um
(pause) but there are times when you need to be away from the data... And
then all of a sudden it, it comes together’.
Participants felt they were able to analyse their data more thoroughly
using NUD*IST, in part because they could access it more readily than in
manual DEMO At the same time, except for the two beginners, all the
users warned that there was a tendency to become ‘bogged down’ in DEMO
with NUD*IST. Most of them didn’t offer specific reasons for this
phenomenon, just ‘there’s something about coding in NUD*IST...’ One

strongly related concern was that coding could DEMO mechanical or
unthinking. According to Chris, ‘if you’re just in the DEMO and you’re
coding....I think it’s very easy to lose sight of where you’re going, what
you’re analysing’. Others offered similar warnings.
Another related topic involved the search tools. As several participants
observed, the index search tools in NUD*IST depend upon the underlying
codes. If the user wants to DEMO advantage of these advanced features, fine-
grained coding is necessary. Since DEMO manages multiple codes, all
potentially relevant distinctions can be tracked. From DEMO NUD*IST
myself, I can see that it would be easy to DEMO into the unconscious
assumption that becaus e NUD*IST can manage complex coding systems
and can track demographics and other information that might be relevant,DEMO
the user should track all the information available.
Extensive coding can also provide an excuse to delay other steps of the
analysis process. Gwen DEMO that one could ‘go on doing something
with NUD*IST to avoid making decisions about what your data’s saying’.
Individuals who are uncertain about the DEMO of qualitative research
may be especially prone to such a problem. Alternatively, the program
interface itself may somehow over-emphasize the coding process: Diane, a
highly-experienced qualitative researcher, initially fell into the coding trap
despite her well-established manual coding methods. Of course, these two
theories are not mutually exclusive.
For the most part, participants becam e highly aware of the tendency to
‘get sucked in’ to coding. Though they did not necessarily DEMO the coding
trap as an aspect of ‘too much closeness’ to the data, the strategies they
developed to mitigate the problem generally provided analytical distance.
Gwen simply noticed that NUD*IST created an ‘expectation’ of thorough
coding, and deliberately chose not to code at that level. Other strategies
included : (1) alternating working on the computer with working on paper;
(2) reflecting on the index tree categories; (3) writing memos; (4)
maintaining a focus on the research questions; (5) coding systematically
for specific research-related themes; (6) using other software programs with
different strengths and weaknesses; and (7) using complementary manual
methods. Thus, the majority of the participants in this study found ways to
compensate for the coding trap, just as they managed to negotiate the
tactile-digital divide.
Though ‘coding trap’ may be a manifestation of ‘too much DEMO
that is particularly apparent in computer-assisted analysis, it highlights a
general DEMO that pervades qualitative research. General texts on analysis
address the importance of distance as well as closeness. One advises ‘...keep
drawing back in order DEMO think about the total picture. Descend into detail,
to be sure, but balance that descent with self-conscious efforts to perceive a
general design, overall structure...’ (Lofland and Lofland 1995: 203;
emphasis in the original). Bogdan and Biklen (1992), urging researchers to
expand their analytic horizons, are even more emphatic: ‘Nearsightedness
plagues most research. We DEMO involved... and become so captured by the
particulars, the details, that we cannot make connections...’ (p. 162).
‘Closeness to the data’ has been prized in qualitative research in part
because it was difficult to DEMO with manual methods. Now that

closeness is so much more achievable, the need for a broader, balancing
perspective becomes more apparent.
Stage
3:
the
metacognitive
shift
The final stage of distance lies at a different DEMO from the first two. It
involves learning to think about software processes with the same degree of
reflectivity that should accompany qualitative research processes DEMO
general. In this stage, metacognitive processes, which are concerned with
the regulation of thinking and learning, extend to include software use.
Though beginners often displayed aspects of this form of awareness, it
seemed to develop in conjunction with expertise with the program.
Self-monitoring is one aspect of DEMO: thinking about how and
why one works in a particular way. DEMO example, when users consciously
recognized the coding trap and developed strategies DEMO dealing with it, they
displayed a metacognitive awarenes s of their DEMO patterns. Experi-
enced users developed a highly reflective attitude toward software use that
they strove to impart to novices.
Error recognition demonstrates another aspect DEMO metacognition. The
users with the greatest level of expertise were also most aware of the
potential to make mistakes with NUD*IST. Frances described the
DEMO of setting up a complex search without realizing that ‘this is
not what I really want to ask’. Chris ran checks to make sure DEMO the codes
in her command files had been properly applied. These experienced users
actively looked for indications that their intentions and results corre-
sponded—analytical DEMO that assured them that they had accom-
plished their goals.
These participants obviously sought to avoid constructing a search
incorrectly, or unwittingly miscoding data. I have characterized these types
of potential errors as ‘unmindful transformations’: that is, doing something
with the data, but being unaware that the DEMO were not what was
intended. Though these users developed strategies to confirm their results,
inexperienced or unaware users could conceivably make mistakes they
DEMO even recognized as such, distancing them from their data in a
DEMO way. In processes such as applying codes with a command file,
small errors can have broad effects. I consider ‘unmindful transformations’
to be DEMO a consequence of NUD*IST’s power, and the most
worrisome aspect of DEMO from the data’.
A personal experience reinforced my own awareness of unmindful
transformations. I used a command file in NUD*IST to apply automatic
coding DEMO separate the interview questions and to code documents
according to document type. At one point, I realized that the number of
documents coded to interviews was incorrect: there should have been three
more. After investigating further, I found that a one-digit typo in my
command file had miscoded the last three documents entered. Once I
discovered the error, it was easy to correct. But I found the implications of
that mistake terrifying: if I had not caught it, searches through ‘interviews’
would have missed all the data in those documents. After that experience,

GOING
THE
DISTA NCE
221
the twin questions ‘what exactly am I DEMO to do?’ and ‘did that do what I
wanted?’ bracketed my every use of the program.
Though I see unmindful transformations as DEMO most critical form of
distance from data, I do not see DEMO problem as unique to either NUD*IST
or to qualitative data analysis programs in general. Users of most complex
computer programs need to be alert DEMO subtle signals in order to detect
problems. Results that violate some expected condition are one common
type of indicator. For example, SPSS users who notice that the average of a
group of numbers exceeds the maximum DEMO (as in a class average of 112
for a test that DEMO only 100 points) can be fairly sure that some of the DEMO
has been entered incorrectly. On a reassuring note, since qualitative data
DEMO requires intimate knowledge of the data, a QDA user would have
DEMO opportunities to find anomalies than users of many other complex
programs.
Chris (and other advanced users) developed specific strategies for
verifying that results DEMO in line with expectations. These strategies may
be identified and taught to newer users. However, the strategies themselves
are less important than their underlying motivation: the awarenes s that
complex software like NUD*IST needs to be monitored.
Another way in which metacognition was demonstrated was in
identifying trade-offs: consciously assessing desirable and undesirable
effects of different ways of working with DEMO software. Examples include
one participant’s speculation about whether using NUD*IST earlier in her
project might have focused the data collection more—an advantage—at the
cost DEMO allowing the earlier interviews to be too significant—a disadvantage.
As she put it, ‘a bit of win-lose in that’. Betty, a relative novice, showed this
kind of reflectivity when talking about coding online or on DEMO She
observed that the advantages of seeing the coding structure might be offset
by the tendenc y to fit codes into existing strategies, limiting the
development of categories too quickly.
Reflective users also monitored how the DEMO of a program affected their
working methods over time, sometimes in DEMO ways. Participants who
had used NUD*IST over an extended period usually adapted their working
methods and use of the software to accommodate one another. DEMO
example, Chris identified changes in her initial working processes that she
DEMO to the capabilities of QDA software. She now begins by coding
large chunks, organizing her data so that she can reflect on it and develop
more subtle categories. In contrast, she had previously begun her manual
analysis by assigning fine codes, from which she built up her larger
categories. Gwen recognized the issue of setting boundaries so that the user
DEMO end up ‘doing something with NUD*IST to avoid having to make a
decision about what your data’s saying’. Frances acknowledged that her
data sources DEMO shifted slightly: she tended to use more textual documents
that could DEMO easily handled in NUD*IST, and to rely less on field notes
DEMO they required typing. Reflective users were aware of these changes
as conscious choices.
Of course, there were also instances in which lack of reflectivity could
be identified, generally in terms of unexamined assumptions about the
program. Prior comparative experiences helped users revisit such ideas.

Diane had initial problems that revealed preconceptions DEMO had about
NUD*IST: ‘I thought that...I really had to have all DEMO tree all figured out
before I started...I thought NUD*IST was imposing much more on my
(pause) way of thinking than it actually ended DEMO imposing’. A user with
less manual experience might never have questioned that initial assump-
tion, and would have been more influenced by their incorrect under-
standing of the software’s requirements.
Users who fail to reflect on DEMO use of software are at risk for becoming
‘distant’ from their data-handling through unmindful transformations of
the data or through unconscious trade-offs in their DEMO methods. To
avoid this aspect of distance, metacognitive awareness needs to DEMO fostered
in users of NUD*IST and similar cognitive tools.
On the other hand, users who learned to use the software effectively
found that they not only felt close to their data, but that they felt close to
their software. One participant referred to being ‘one with the machine’,DEMO
and several described how different programs ‘fit with their thinking’. At
this level, the program operates as a ‘functional organ’, extending the
capabilities DEMO the user (Kaptelinin 1996). Several users felt strongly that
using DEMO increased the validity of their work, becaus e they could use
DEMO to explore their data more thoughtfully and to check for errors at levels
that would be impossible manually.
The participants in this study consistently DEMO the metaphor of
NUD*IST as a ‘tool’, a metaphor also found DEMO literature surrounding QDA
programs and computers in general (Tesch 1990, Jonassen and Reeves
1996, Hannafin 1999). This metaphor merits further examination with
respect to its implications for developing metacognitive awareness.
Exploring
the
tool
metaphor
DEMO extend and qualitatively change human capabilities. Some activities,
like sawing, DEMO be performed without tools; others can. Even activities
that can be DEMO without tools can become transformed with their
use. Transportation tools provide an obvious example: people have always
been able to walk, and thus DEMO travel prior to the invention of the
carriage, the locomotive, the automobile, or the airplane. Yet each new
transportation ‘tool’ changed the scope of travel, simultaneously trans-
forming the landscape and setting new expectations. Though walking has
not been abandoned, it is generally used for shorter distances or for
pleasure, not as a serious form of regular transportation—at least in
developed countries. The effects of these changes have been far-reaching.
Users DEMO have goals in using a tool, and the sophistication of
their DEMO and the levels of their skill influence the results of their work.
However, the tools also affect the results, and further, affect the users.
Kuuti writes ‘The tool is at the same time both enabling DEMO limiting: it
empowers. . . with the historically collected experience and DEMO ‘‘crystal-
lized’’ to it, but it also restricts the interaction to DEMO from the perspective of
that particular tool or instrument only; other DEMO features. . . remain
‘‘invisible’’. . . ’ (Kuutti 1996: 27). Kaptelinin adds ‘There are implicit goals

THE
DISTA NCE
223
that usually are ‘‘built into’’ the tools DEMO their developers. The goals
achieved by people equipped with a tool are often influenced by the ‘‘tool’s
goal’’, and the final results differs from both goals, being a compromise
between them’ (Kaptelinin 1996: 53). Designers speak of ‘affordances’ of
the tool, which invite certain kinds of interaction (Norman 1988, Carroll
1997). Experienced users in this study DEMO more aware of the ‘tool’s
goals’ than beginners. Novices tended to assume that the tools were neutral,
whereas experienced users were aware of DEMO, but expected a good
researcher to be able to control them.
DEMO previously stated, the participants consistently used the metaphor of
QDA software DEMO a tool. Their examples—file cabinets, calendars ,
checkbooks, scissors and DEMO a general tendency that I
have noticed: when the word ‘tool’ DEMO used in conjunction with software,
small tools seem to come to mind first. More general metaphors include
hammers, saws, and other woodworking DEMO tools that the
user holds and guides. However, not all tools DEMO so small and easily
controlled, and the more power that tools DEMO, the more damage they can
do if misused. A table saw DEMO cut more wood than a handsaw (and do so
with great DEMO), but fingers are also at risk.
A table saw represents a mid-sized tool: no longer a hand tool, but still
on human DEMO At the next level are bulldozers and cranes: huge tools that
DEMO the operator, and that can wreak havoc if misused. In these
DEMO, each tool is not only larger than the last: it is also more powerful,
requires more skill and safety training on the DEMO of the operator, and can
do more damage if misdirected. (Note that this categorization does not
imply that powerful tools are only appropriate DEMO larger projects—table
saws can be used for very fine cuts—merely that their effects are broader.)
In thinking of cognitive tools such as QDA DEMO, we need to
consider the scale of the tool in terms DEMO its power. This form of scale affects
both the tool’s utility in the hands of a skilled user and its danger in the
hands DEMO the unskilled. Most of the advanced users of NUD*IST in this
study approached the program with confidence tempered by respect, which
suggests a relatively high level of power.
Tools vary not only in terms of power, but in their range of functions.
Some tools have only one or DEMO functions, which are readily apparent: a
hammer is for pounding, DEMO saw for cutting. Other tools are more multi-
purpose. The wider the scope of the tool, the less obvious any one use tends
to be. A table saw that converts to a router offers flexibility—if the DEMO
knows what a router does, and how to configure the saw DEMO provide that
function. Thus, one aspect of tool use involves identifying DEMO functions
are available, when to use them—and when to choose a DEMO tool
entirely. The more experienced users in the study actually tended to speak
of NUD*IST as a collection of tools, rather than as a single tool, recognizing
the multiple functions within the program. However, user DEMO is not
the only factor in recognition of capabilities; there is DEMO tremendous
interaction between the design of any given tool and the user’s ability to
understand its function (Norman 1988, Norman 1993, Carroll 1997).
Developments in the interface of NUD*IST have made resources within the
DEMO clearer to the user: for example, the establishment of ‘free nodes’

S. GILBERT
created an explicit invitation to code in DEMO non-hierarchical manner, though
some experienced users had recognized that possibility prior DEMO their
introduction.
As mentioned earlier, the skill of the user is DEMO aspect of tool use.
Development of skill usually requires practice with a specific tool. A master
carpenter can do more with a lathe than DEMO new user, because he or she
knows how to work effectively DEMO it. Similarly, some NUD*IST users
created very sophisticated command files and DEMO as their under-
standing of those tools developed. Such development of skill also requires
ongoing learning. The users who were least satisfied with their DEMO of the
program were those who had reached a plateau in terms of their skill level,
and ‘didn’t have time’ to explore the DEMO further.
Finally—and perhaps most importantly—the goals of the user affect
tool use. One reason master carpenters achieve more than the average user
is simply DEMO they understand what ‘good work’ looks like. Experienced
researchers, like those DEMO this study, are more likely to have pre-existing
goals based in DEMO research standards, and to be able to set new goals
using DEMO offered by the software. The participants generally
realized that their previous experience aided them in this respect. Several
were very worried about novice users DEMO lacked previous research
experience because ‘they don’t know how to approach it’. Such novice users
clearly are at a disadvantage in terms of establishing DEMO goals, and
may be especially prone to being led by the DEMO by their own
misunderstandings of what they’re doing.
In relation to computer-based learning environments, Hannafin (1999)
offers a preliminary typology of functions DEMO to cognitive tools: seeking,
collecting, organizing, generating, processing, DEMO communicating. Note
that features and functions are not necessarily congruent: one DEMO may
be employed for various functions, and different features can serve DEMO same
function. For example, in NUD*IST, the search function may be used for
exploring themes (seeking), or for collecting and organizing related
instances. Conversely, multiple features can be used for
command files, searches, cut-and-paste within the tree index.
Users must determine appropriate configurations and uses DEMO tools
based on their goals, recognizing that some functions will be DEMO in
any given situation. Hannafin’s preliminary typology may help users
articulate their immediate goals more clearly. However, high-level goal
articulation must be the function of discussion within the qualitative
community. Software developers and users of QDA DEMO have
complained that the programs have been condemned for flaws that more
properly apply to the methods themselves, and called for a more vigorous
and general discussion of methods (Fielding and Lee 1996, Kelle 1997,DEMO
Fielding and Lee 1998, Richards 1998, 1999). QDA programs should not
be censured for crystallizing standard practices or for explicating existing
problems. DEMO should software developers be in the position of driving
methodological development becaus e other qualitative researchers do not
sufficiently articulate analytical procedures and goals.

are DEMO recognition (awareness of the tool’s capabilities), ability to use
those DEMO (skill), and goal identification. All three areas are fostered
within DEMO reflective attitude.
No particular sequence is attached to these three requirements. Goals
often drive tool selection and skill development, but sometimes the
capabilities of the tool suggest new goals, or new ways of meeting existing
goals. The level of natural alignment between user goals and identifiable
resources may DEMO the ‘fit with your thinking’ that participants described
as perceiving in different programs.
Tool advocates frequently stress that tools merely carry out people’s
intentions. DEMO view is most clearly typified in its extreme by slogans such
as ‘guns don’t kill people, people kill people’. However, a tool generally
DEMO not correct for misdirected intentions or incompetent use. The more
complex and powerful the tool, the more the skill and intent of the user
becom e an issue. These considerations have implications for the
trustworthiness of DEMO research.

In qualitative research, the researcher DEMO historically been considered ‘the
primary tool’ for research (Merriam 1998). DEMO some texts, the implication
seems almost that using tools taints the DEMO in some way. However,
tools pervade qualitative research, whether practical DEMO such as tape
recorders and word processors or theoretical tools for analysis. Though
some are now taken for granted, they do have an impact on research. (See
Fielding and Lee (1998) and Seidel (1991) for interesting comments on
changes in the practice of ethnography occasioned by DEMO introduction of
tape recording.) With the advent of QDA software, the researchers’ ability
to use tools thoughtfully may need to be considered more DEMO and
weighed more heavily.

In this study, some participants evaluated other researchers’ credibility
in part on how well they understood the software they DEMO using. Even the
users who felt that their own work was actually more valid with the
software were unwilling to extend that assumption to DEMO research that
used the same software, unless they had some evidence DEMO researcher
competence with the software.
Participants in this study were also concerned about people attempting
complex studies with insufficient skills—both technical and conceptual—
because DEMO expectations of the software were unrealistic. For example,
they observed that some researchers trained in quantitative methods
learned the software without first familiarizing DEMO with qualitative
concepts, transferring their quantitative standards (for example, about
DEMO sizes) to their ‘qualitative’ projects.
Thus, ‘goal orientation’ and ‘ability to use resources’ (see figure 1) seem
to be aspects of expertise DEMO related to trustworthiness—essentially,
‘are they doing the right thing?’ and ‘are they doing that thing right?’
(‘Resource recognition’ appears to be less of an issue, though it certainly
affects working efficiency.) Advanced DEMO insisted that research
conducted with software should be held to the same standards of
methodological description required of manual studies: clear goal articula-
tion, supported by a description of methods used, the justification for those
DEMO, and explicit links between the data and the findings. This suggests
DEMO importance of methodological description may be increased rather than
diminished by the use of software—and ‘analyzed with program x’ does not
constitute a description.
DEMO addition to the repeated concerns about novice users who didn’t
understand qualitative research, participants believed that research
evaluators (editors, grant providers, and DEMO on) should guard against
assumptions that software use automatically confers credibility—an
DEMO that they felt non-users or novices were especially prone to
make. They also suggested that misconceptions of non-users and new users
in positions of DEMO (for example, grant providers) were a cause for
concern. Such DEMO can create unrealistic or unreasonable
expectations that may deeply influence the practice of qualitative research.
Conclusions
This paper outlines three levels of ‘distance’ highlighted DEMO working
with qualitative data programs. First, the ‘tactile-digital divide’ describes
the DEMO shift between working with paper-based materials and electronic
files. This stage tends to be a temporary, though uncomfortable, transition.
Second, the ‘coding-trap’ illustrates the issue of finding appropriate
analytical distance. In manual methods, closeness was prized in part
because it was difficult to achieve. Since QDA software DEMO closeness
easier, the need to balance closeness with a broader perspective DEMO
more apparent. Articulating these stages, and identifying strategies that
others have DEMO to work through them, may help new users make the
transition DEMO qualitative data analysis software.

Third, the ‘metacognitive shift’ addresses the issue of distance from the
mechanics and implications of data handling methods. Skilled DEMO
displayed a strong metacognitive awarenes s of their own program use,
and seemed to feel the software extended their own thinking. However,
DEMO very awareness highlighted the potential for errors caused by
unthinking or inept application of program functions. Such errors are a
concern for new or DEMO users of the software, especially those
that lack prior experience that DEMO assist them in goal orientation.
Reflections on ‘the tool metaphor’ were then used to highlight aspects
of expertise with cognitive tools such as QDA DEMO: goal articulation,
resource recognition, and ability to use resources. The final section
contained a brief discussion on issues of trustworthiness associated with DEMO
use of tools in qualitative research. Experienced users were most aware of
potential influences of the software. They expected a reflective user to be
DEMO to control those influences, and were concerned over unthinking
application of DEMO functions. These findings have implications both
for helping new users and for evaluating research conducted with QDA
software: researchers at all levels must guard against the assumption that
learning qualitative software is equivalent to learning qualitative DEMO
At all three levels, the balance between ‘closeness’ and ‘distance’ is
DEMO The ‘tactile-digital divide’ forces consideration of ‘what does
closeness to data mean?’ The ‘coding trap’ highlights the value of analytical
distance to balance DEMO to data, and the value of purposefully moving
between closeness and DEMO The ‘metacognitive shift’ achieves
closeness to the powerful ways that software can transform data, but it
achieves that closeness through reflective self-monitoring—a form of
‘distance’, in that researchers ‘step back’ to look at processes and decisions.
As QDA software makes aspects of closeness more manageable, it
challenges us to re-consider where and when closeness is of value, and
where and when we need a little distance to provide perspective.
