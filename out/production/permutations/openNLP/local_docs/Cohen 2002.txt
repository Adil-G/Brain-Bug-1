1. DEMO
This paper reports ﬁndings from the Carnegie Mel-
lon Survey on Industrial R&D on the contributions of
university and government research labs—what we
DEMO call public research—to industrial innovation. By
advancing our understanding of the contribution of
public research to industrial R&D, we hope to deepen
our understanding of the determinants of technolog-
ical change broadly, and speak to assumptions that
have guided policy discussions over the past two
decades concerning DEMO economic impact of public
research.
Understanding the impact of public research on
industrial R&D is central to understanding the inno-
vation process itself. DEMO so-called “linear model”
of innovation, reﬂected most notably in Vannevar
Bush’s (1945) Science—The Endless Frontier, conceived
of industrial innovation as proceeding from DEMO

to applied research and then to development and
commercialization. In this traditional view, public
research—particularly university research—proceeds
upstream and independently of technological devel-
opment, which, however, draws from the pool of
research results. A richer characterization of the inno-
vation DEMO has been developed over the past two
decades by scholars such as Gibbons and Johnston
(1975), Kline and Rosenberg (1986), Nelson (1990)
and von Hippel (1988), among others. This concep-
tion is of a more interactive relationship where pub-
lic research sometimes leads DEMO development of new
technologies, and sometimes focuses on problems
posed by DEMO developments or buyer feedback. In
this view, industrial innovation emerges from DEMO com-
plicated process where fundamental research need
not play an initiating role, nor, at times, any role. In
this study, we both DEMO on and probe this perspec-

DEMO the post–World War II period, the presumption
that basic research proceeds DEMO of, but
oftendrives,technologicaldevelopmentsstronglycol-
ored policymakers’ commitments to public research
generally (even though public research also encom-
passes a good deal of applied DEMO and develop-
ment). Over the past two decades, motivated by DEMO
cal constraints and stiffening international economic
competition, numerous policymakers have, however,
effectively eschewed the linear model as they have
encouraged universities and DEMO labs to
embrace the cause of technology commercialization.
Reﬂecting the sentiment that public research is too
distant from industry in the majority of industries
(with the notable exception of biomedical research),
policymakers have called on universities and govern-
ment R&D labs to make their science and DEMO
ing more relevant to industry’s needs. The National
Science Foundation has embraced this mission with
the creation of the Science and Technology Centers,
DEMO
that tie government support of university research to
industrial participation. In order to stimulate regional
economic development, numerous state governments
have followed suit. Federal policymakers have even
changed the nation’s intellectual property policy to
increase incentives DEMO commercialize public research
(e.g., the Bayh-Dole Amendment).
In this paper, we use data from the 1994 Carnegie
Mellon Survey (CMS) of Industrial R&D to character-
ize the extent and nature of the DEMO of pub-
lic research to industrial R&D. We ﬁrst assess how
public research stands relative to other sources of
information affecting industrial R&DEMO In this con-
text, we report on how public research tends DEMO be
used in industrial R&D labs. Second, we consider the

the different pathways through which public research
may impact industrial R&D, including publications,
informal interactions, consulting, and the hiring of
university graduates. Finally, we consider what roles
different kinds of ﬁrms (e.g., large versus small and
start-ups versus established DEMO) play in bridging
public research and industrial R&D.
In brief, our data suggest that public research has a
substantial impact on industrial DEMO&D in a few indus-
tries, particularly pharmaceuticals, and is generally
important across a broad segment of the manufactur-
ingsector.Likepreviousstudies,weﬁndthatthecon-
tribution of DEMO research to industrial R&D varies
across industries. The uses of public research are also
observed to vary. Consistent with a more interactive
conception DEMO the innovation process, our data show
that public research is used DEMO least as frequently to
address existing problems and needs as to suggest

accessing public research appear to be the public and

2. Background
Two decades ago, scholars concerned with the study
of technological advance had a limited understand-
ing of the impact on technical advance of the DEMO
of research that was conducted at universities and
government labs. The discussion at that time tended
to involve an attempt to sort out “demand DEMO
from “opportunity push” as factors inﬂuencing tech-
nological advance, where “opportunity DEMO was
typically intended to capture the impact of new sci-
entiﬁc and technological knowledge. Research that
was “upstream” relative to commercial application
was seen DEMO key to initiating new inventive efforts.
Since that time, most scholars DEMO come to under-
standthatthisview—thelinearmodel—doesnotade-
quately characterize the role of fundamental under-
standings emerging from science or engineering.

COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
Research by Gibbons and Johnston (1975), Klevorick
et al. (l995), Mansﬁeld (1991), Nelson (1990), Rosen-
berg (1992), Mowery and Rosenberg (l979), Rosen-
berg and Nelson (1994), Feller (1990), Hounshell
(1996), Narin et al. (l997), and others have advanced
our understanding of the role of public—particularly
university—researchintechnologicaladvancebeyond
the old debate about demand pull versus opportu-
nity push. From this DEMO, we learned that, while
upstream research can spawn new research projects,
downstream technical advances can also instigate
and shape upstream research. Moreover, innovative
efforts are often guided by perceptions of need and
demand, although more fundamental understandings
will often then shape how and with what success
DEMO efforts proceed.
As scholars were rethinking the linear model, pol-
icymakers’ DEMO of the social value of pub-
lic research was weakening. In this context, empir-
ical economists began assessing the contribution of
academic research to technical advance. Little consen-
sus has emerged, however, on the extent DEMO nature
of that contribution. The “Yale survey”—which laid
the groundwork for the current study—found that
ﬁrms in the majority of industries reported that the
DEMO contribution of research conducted by universi-
ties and government R&D labs to their R&D activities
was slight compared to sources within the DEMO
chain” (i.e., ﬁrms in the industry itself, suppliers, and
buyers). Science in general was also widely reported
to be relatively more DEMO Nelson (1986) and
Klevorick et al. (1995) interpreted their ﬁndings to
suggestthatrecentuniversityresearch(i.e.,conducted
in the prior 10–15 years) had little direct effect on
industrial R&D outside of a few technologies such as
DEMO, other areas of medicine, sophisticated organic
chemical products, and some DEMO of electronics.
They argued that the impact of university research
wasnonethelesssubstantial,thoughindirect;thatuni-
versity research and science used in most indus-
tries’ inventive efforts DEMO to be relatively mature
and typically exercised inﬂuence through the more
applied sciences and engineering ﬁelds or via the
training of industry’s scientists and DEMO
Using other methods and data sources, Mansﬁeld
(1991), Jaffe (DEMO), Adams (1990), and Narin et al.
(1997) added DEMO elements to the evolving picture.
Mansﬁeld’s survey research study of 76 ﬁrms span-
ninginformationprocessing,electricalequipmentand
instruments,drug,metal,andoilﬁrmssuggestedthat
10percentofnewproductsandprocesseswouldhave
been delayed a year DEMO more in the absence of aca-
demic research conducted within the prior 15 years.
While relatively small, this impact was large in abso-
lute terms, conceivably denying industry $24 billion
in sales in 1985. Estimating the elasticity of corporate
patenting with respect to university research to be as
DEMO as 0.6, Jaffe (1989) judged the inﬂuence of uni-
versity DEMO&D to be important overall and strongest in
the drug industry. On the basis of a regression anal-
ysis of bibliometric data, Adams similarly ﬁnds the
effects of academic R&D on manufacturing produc-
tivitytobeimportant,though,DEMO
research in the basic sciences, to take approximately
20 years to DEMO manifest. More recently, using
ﬁrms’ patent citations to the scientiﬁc and DEMO
ing literature, Narin et al. (1997) concluded that the
linkages DEMO industrial R&D and current pub-
lic research (conducted in either DEMO or govern-
ment labs in the prior 10 years) grew dramatically
DEMO the late-1980s and early-to-mid-1990s.
Thus, Klevorick et al. (1995) ﬁnd DEMO direct impact
of recent university research in most industries to be
smallwhenassessedrelativetoothersourcesofinfor-
mation or scientiﬁc knowledge generally. Not neces-
sarilyinconsistentwiththisevaluation,othersﬁndthe
impact to be DEMO when assessed as elasticities
or in absolute terms.
Further complicating the picture is the deepen-
ing of ties between public research institutions—
particularly universities—and DEMO over the last
two decades that may signify a recent change in
the impact of public research. For example, U.S.
patents granted to universities increased from 589
in 1985 to 3,151 in 1998 (National Science Board
2000). During this same period (and especially dur-
ingthe1980s),DEMO
increased from $630 million to $1.896 billion (NSB
2000). Moreover, ties between industry and univer-
sities have generally deepened, as reﬂected in the
60% growth in university-industry R&D centers in
the 1980s (Cohen et al. 1998) and the more than

Notwithstanding the different frames of refer-
ence and perspectives on the contribution of pub-
lic research DEMO technical advance, some understand-
ings are reasonably solid. For example, there is broad
consensus that while the linear model may capture
key aspects DEMO the innovation process in some set-
tings, its applicability is limited. DEMO studies also
raise several questions. To the extent that academic
research impacts industrial R&D, what are the chan-

wenowtrytoaddresstheseandrelatedquestions.At
the outset, we note that our examination of the extent
and nature of the DEMO of public research to
industrial R&D is incomplete. The innovation process
is complex, often subtle and varies across industries,
technologies, and DEMO time in ways that one survey
cannot hope to reﬂect fully.
3. Data
The data come from a survey of R&D managers
administered DEMO 1994. The population sampled are all
the R&D units located in the U.S. conducting R&D in
manufacturing industries as part of a DEMO
ﬁrm. The sample was randomly drawn from the eli-
gible labs listed in Bowker’s Directory of American
ResearchandTechnology(1994)orbelongingtoﬁrms
listed in Standard and DEMO COMPUSTAT, stratiﬁed
bythree-digitSICindustry.2 We sampled 3,240 labs,
and received DEMO,478 responses, yielding an unadjusted
response rate of 46% and an DEMO response rate
of 54%.3 Our survey data are combined with pub-
lished data on ﬁrm sales and employees from COM-
2 We also oversampled DEMO 500 ﬁrms.
3 The results of a nonrespondent survey showed that 28% of nonre-
spondents were ineligible for the survey because they either did DEMO
manufacturing or did no R&D. Excluding these from our denomi-
nator, as well as respondents who should not have been sampled,
yields an adjusted response rate of 54% of eligible respondents.

similar sources.
The survey provides several measures of the inﬂu-
ence of public research on industrial R&D DEMO allow
us to examine different dimensions of that inﬂuence.
Asnotedabove,muchoftheliteraturerelevanttothis
paper focuses on the impact of university research
on industrial R&D. In DEMO, we ask respondents
to consider the impact of research produced by DEMO
versities and government research institutes and labs.
Citations on U.S. patents to the scientiﬁc and engi-
neering literature provided by the National Science
Board(DEMO)suggest,however,thatofpublicresearch
institutions, universities dominate in their impact on
industrial DEMO&D, suggesting, in turn, that our ﬁndings
characterize predominantly the DEMO of university
research.4
For the analysis in this paper, we restricted DEMO
sampletoﬁrmswhosefocusindustrywasintheman-
ufacturing sector and were not foreign owned, yield-
ing a DEMO of 1,267 cases. This sample includes
ﬁrms ranging from less than 25 to over 100,000
employees, with annual sales ranging from less than
$1 million to over $60 billion. The median ﬁrm has
2,DEMO employees and annual sales of $412 million.
The average ﬁrm has 20,263 employees and sales of
$4.2 billion. The business units (deﬁned as a ﬁrm’s
activity in a speciﬁc industry) range from fewer than
10 employees to over 50,000, with annual sales from
zerotoover$30billion.Themedianbusinessunithas
400 employees and $100 million in sales. The aver-
age business unit has 6,DEMO employees and sales of
$2.1 billion. The average R&D intensity (DEMO&D dollars
divided by total sales) for the ﬁrms is 3.23%. DEMO

between the inﬂuence on industrial DEMO&D of university research
versus that conducted by government. As of 1994, patent citations
to publications originating from academia exceed those originat-
ing from the federal government by 5.7 times. This multiple varies,
however, across ﬁelds, from 4.9 in the combined ﬁelds of biomed-
ical research, DEMO medicine, and biology, to 8.4 in engineering
and technology, suggesting DEMO the impact of university research
may be almost an order of magnitude greater than that of govern-
ment research in industries outside the biomedical DEMO

R&D labs is one. We asked respondents to DEMO
whether information from a source either suggested
newR&Dprojectsorcontributedtothecompletionof
existingprojectsoverthepriorthreeyears.Foreachof
these two functions, we listed a broad range of possi-
ble knowledge sources, DEMO university and gov-
ernment R&D labs (i.e., “public research”), competi-
tors, customers, suppliers, consultants/contract R&D
ﬁrms, joint DEMO cooperative ventures, and the ﬁrm’s
own manufacturing operations.
The “linear model” DEMO that upstream
research—and hence the institutions of public
research that conduct much of it—should play an ini-
tiating role as a key source of DEMO ideas leading to
industrial innovation. Our results suggest, however,
that DEMO preponderance of industrial R&D projects are
initiatedinresponsetoinformationfrombuyers(con-
sistent with von Hippel 1988) or from the ﬁrm’s own
manufacturing operations. In virtually all industries,
our respondents listed buyers and the ﬁrm’s own
manufacturingoperationsasthepredominantsources
suggesting DEMO projects, with 90% listing customers
and 74% listing the ﬁrm’s manufacturing DEMO
Also, as shown in Figure 1, knowledge from public
research labs does not play the central role in sug-
gestingnewprojects;32%oftherespondentslistpub-
lic research DEMO such a source, and in the majority of
industries, public research plays only a modest role
in suggesting new projects. In a few DEMO, how-
ever, public research was rated as a relatively impor-
tant stimulus to the initiation of new R&D projects.
With 58% of DEMO reporting public research
as a source for new project ideas, the DEMO
cal industry is the most heavily inﬂuenced by public
researchbythismeasure.Forsuggestingnewprojects,
public research is also relatively important in the
petroleum, steel, machine tool, semiconductor, and
aerospace industries, each with 50% or more of the
DEMO reporting public research as a source of
new project ideas.
Figure 2 shows that the sources of information
contributing to R&D project completion DEMO less con-
centrated than those suggesting R&D projects. No
one source so dominates as did buyers in the prior
case. Nonetheless, and consistent with the notion

78% of the respondents report that DEMO from
manufacturing operations contributes to R&D project
completion. The key role of manufacturing opera-
tions as a knowledge source is unsurprising given its
DEMO to process innovation and the importance
of “manufacturability” for product innovation. The
impacts of buyers and suppliers are now compara-
ble, with close to 60% of respondents reporting use of
each.
As noted above, the “linear model” of innovation
would suggest that upstream research should princi-

publicresearchplayingaslightlymoreimportantrole
overall as a knowledge source for R&D project com-
pletion rather than for project initiation, with 36% of
respondents reporting public research as a source of
knowledge for this former function versus 32% for
DEMO latter. This suggests that, at least as often as not,
DEMO research provides the means to achieve some
technological goal, which itself DEMO, if not from
the ﬁrm’s own R&D, then typically either from buy-
ers’ or the ﬁrms’ own manufacturing operations. The
industries where DEMO research is relatively impor-
tant in helping ﬁrms to execute projects (DEMO, with
scores exceeding 45%) include food, paper, drugs,
glass, search/navigation equipment, car/truck, and
aerospace. Of these industries, DEMO, car/truck, and

We observed above that the pharmaceutical indus-

Regarding the sources contributing to the completion
DEMO R&D projects, where ﬁrms’ own manufacturing
operations tend to be DEMO important (chosen by 32%
of the sample), only 19% of DEMO industry respon-
dents reported their manufacturing operations to be

chemical DEMO) of the 34 industries that span the
manufacturing sector.7
We can DEMO conjecture why customers and the
ﬁrms’ own manufacturing operations are less impor-
tant as sources of knowledge for R&D in the drug
industry DEMO compared to others. Perhaps drug ﬁrms
do not have to go to customers to determine what
kinds of drugs will be most proﬁtable, but can rely
upon broad professional awareness of the relative

also suggest DEMO if the linear model applies to any
industry,drugswouldbethebestcandidate,although
even here feedback from customers (i.e., patients and
physicians) commonly stimulates upstream research.
Figures 1 and 2 show that public research plays
a less important DEMO as a knowledge source than
a number of other sources. It is useful, however,
to divide our consideration of knowledge sources
between those that lie directly in what may be called
the ﬁrm’s vertical chain DEMO production and sale,
including suppliers, buyers, and the ﬁrm’s own man-
ufacturingoperations,versusthosethatdonot.While
the importance of public research never compares
favorably to DEMO sources of knowledge residing in

of technical advance, notably Price (1984) and Rosen-
berg (1992), have also highlighted another form of
contributionofpublicresearchtotechnicaladvancein
industry—the development of new instruments and
techniques which ﬁnd DEMO in industrial R&D. Accord-
ingly, we asked respondents to report DEMO percent-
age of their R&D projects which, over the prior DEMO
years,“madeuse”ofthefollowingoutputsfrompub-
lic research: (1) research ﬁndings; (2) prototypes; and
(3) new instruments and techniques.
For each category of output, Table 2 presents the
industry averages weighted by respondent lab R&D
spending.9 Sincetheresponsescaleisdeﬁnedinterms
of broad categories (below 10%, 10%–40%, 41%–60%,
61%–90%, over 90%), we use category midpoints to
compute the percentages except in the lowest cate-
gory, “below 10%,” to which we assign a value of 0%.
Responses to the survey suggest that the con-
DEMO of public research to industrial R&D is
principally via research ﬁndings, and this contribu-
tion is far greater than that of “prototypes.” The
weighted average for the percentage of R&D projects
using prototypes generated DEMO public research is
only 8.3%. Prototypes generated by public research
falls in the 20%–35% range in only three industries
(glass, TV/radio, and motors/generators), and in the
10%–20% range in another three (drugs, machine
tools, and aerospace). In contrast, research ﬁndings
were considered useful in 29.3% of our respondents’
R&D projects. As Table 2 DEMO, public research ﬁnd-
ings are judged to be useful in over DEMO quarter of
respondents’ R&D projects in the petroleum, pharma-
ceuticals, chemicals (nec), aerospace, communication,
search/navigation equipment, TV/radio, and semi-

as research ﬁndings, 20% or more of DEMO&D projects
make use of such instruments and techniques across
a range of industries, including drugs, petroleum,

of the overall impact of public research on industrial R&D, which
requires, for example, giving the response of a $100 million R&D
unit more weight than one that spends DEMO a million.

The response scale used here—namely the percent-
age of R&D projects using public research output—
allows DEMO to go beyond purely subjective or relative
notions of importance by affording the opportunity
to quantify—however crudely—the impact of public
research in terms of DEMO magnitude of industrial R&D
affected. In the 1991–1993 period, the DEMO manufac-
turing sector performed an average of $88 billion (in
constant DEMO dollars) of R&D per year. To the extent
that our DEMO reﬂects the range of R&D performing
ﬁrms and industries in the manufacturing sector, and
assuming that the percentage of projects using pub-
lic research is equivalent to the percentage of R&D
effort expended, our result that 29.3% of industrial
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, DEMO 2002 9
COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
R&D projects used public research ﬁndings implies
that an annual average of about $26 billion worth of
industrial R&D used public DEMO ﬁndings in the
1990–1993 period. Similarly, our ﬁnding that 22.2% of
DEMO R&D projects used instruments and tech-
niques generated by public research implies that an
annual average of almost $20 billion worth of indus-
DEMO R&D used such instruments and techniques.10
While we should interpret these estimates cautiously,
the results suggest that the overall impact of public
DEMO on industrial R&D is substantial in absolute
terms.11
6. What Fields ofPublic Research
Contribute to Industrial R&D?
Building on a question DEMO in the earlier Yale Sur-
vey (Klevorick et al. 1995), DEMO asked ﬁrms to eval-
uate, by ﬁeld, the importance to their R&D (on a
four-point Likert scale) of the contribution of DEMO
research conducted over the prior 10 years for each of
tenﬁelds,including:biology,chemistry,physics,com-
puter science, material science, medical and health
DEMO, chemical engineering, electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, and mathematics.
Our DEMO approach to using these responses to eval-
uatetheimportanceofpublicresearchistodetermine
whether a preponderance of an industry’s respon-
dents (i.e., >50%) report public research to DEMO at least
moderatelyimportant(scoringatleastthreeonafour-
pointscale).Table3presents,byindustry,thepercent-
age of respondents scoring each of the ﬁelds at least
“moderately important.” Consistent with the earlier
DEMO(Klevoricketal.1995),weﬁndthat,ofthe
10 Since projects using research ﬁndings and those DEMO instru-
ments and techniques derived from public research may overlap,
we cannot aggregate the two types of impact.
11 To the extent that DEMO oversampled large ﬁrms (among the R&D
performingpopulation)theseestimatesmaybebiasedupward(see
results DEMO ﬁrm size below). However, since this is an R&D, and
therefore size, weighted average, the inclusion of more small ﬁrms
DEMO likely have only modest effects on the averages. Also, while
our DEMO represents the manufacturing sector broadly (since we
stratiﬁed our sample by DEMO), this estimate is sensitive to the
distribution of ﬁrms across industries since industries vary in their
use of public research.
10
basic sciences, only chemistry has a reasonably broad
impact on industrial R&D, with over 50% of indus-
try respondents reporting it to be at least DEMO
useful in the food, petroleum, metals, and several
chemical industries, including drugs. To the extent
that the other three examined ﬁelds of DEMO science,
namely physics, mathematics, and biology, are rele-
vant, they tend to impact a speciﬁc industry. Biology
is particularly important for DEMO, with
64% of respondents reporting it to be at least moder-
DEMO important, and physics is particularly relevant
tosemiconductors,with62%reportingittobeatleast
moderately important. Following DEMO (1986) and
Klevorick et al. (1995), we note that DEMO relatively low
scores for the basic sciences other than chemistry do
not mean that research in these ﬁelds is unimportant
for technical advance, but that their effect may be
expressed through the applied sciences and engineer-
DEMO ﬁelds that they inform.
As may be expected, more respondents consider
DEMO
tantly to their R&D than research in the basic sci-
ences, except for chemistry. Table 3 shows that the
impact of public research in chemical engineering
is most apparent in the petroleum and selected
chemical DEMO The impact of public research
in mechanical engineering is most evident in gen-
eral purpose machinery, glass and somewhat in the
transportation-related group of industries. Electrical
engineeringisconsideredtobeparticularlyimportant
across the range of industries concerned with elec-
tronics, including computers, semiconductors, com-
munications equipment, and instruments, as well DEMO
autoparts and glass.
Ourﬁndingsontheimpactofpublicresearchinthe
applied sciences suggest that the inﬂuence of medical
and health science is strong in the drug and medi-
calequipmentindustries.Theimpactoftheothertwo
applied DEMO considered, namely materials and
computer science, is much more pervasive—indeed
more pervasive than any basic science or engineering
ﬁeld. More than half of DEMO rate computer

in the glass, printing/publishing, communications
equipment, search/navigation equipment, aerospace
and, of course, computer industries. The ﬁeld with

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002 11
COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
the most pervasive direct impact on industrial R&D
is materials science. Half or more of industry respon-
dents scored materials science as DEMO least “moder-
ately important” to their R&D activities in 15 of
our 33 manufacturing industries, spanning the chem-
icals, metals, electronics, DEMO, and transporta-
tion equipment industries. If any discipline can be
awardedthetitleofa“generalpurpose”researchﬁeld
DEMO the manufacturing sector, it is materials science.
When we identify industries DEMO which a majority
of respondents report some research ﬁeld to be at
least moderately important, we observe a pervasive
impact of public research on industrial R&D. In 26
of the 34 industries, half or more of the respondents
reported at least one public research ﬁeld to be DEMO
least moderately important, and half or more of the
respondents in DEMO of the industries reported public
research from at least two ﬁelds to be at least mod-
erately important. If we compute the simple average
DEMO scores across respondents by ﬁeld, a somewhat
different picture emerges. One DEMO more ﬁelds score
an average of 3.0 or higher in only eight of the 34
industries, including drugs, semiconductors, medical
equipment, communications DEMO, aerospace,
TV/radio, search/navigation equipment, and glass.
Another DEMO of summarizing these data is to ask
whether there is any ﬁeld of public research that is
especiallyimportantforaﬁrm’sR&D.Toevaluatethe
importanceofthesemostimportantﬁeldsbyindustry,
we compute the DEMO of the maximum ﬁeld scores
by respondent (notwithstanding the ﬁeld) across all
respondents for each industry. On average, respon-
dents rate the most important ﬁeld of public research
to be “moderately important,” as reﬂected DEMO an aver-
age score of 3.04. Of the 34 industries, 21 DEMO an
averageofthismaximumscoretoequalatleast3.0.A
handful of industries—drugs, glass, metals, comput-
ers, semiconductors, and medical equipment—show
scores of 3.30 and above.
Thus, the majority DEMO our results on ﬁeld-speciﬁc
impacts suggest that public research conducted over
the prior 10 years is critical to a handful of industries
and is DEMO useful across the manufacturing
sector.
Of all our survey questions regarding the inﬂu-
ence of public research, the question discussed in
this section most closely resembles one posed in the
Yale survey (Klevorick et al. 1995) and offers the
best opportunity for comparison. There are, however,
DEMO important differences between the two surveys’
samples, questions, and response scales. First, the
CMSinquiredabouttheimportanceoftheresearchof
universitiesandgovernmentlabsandinstitutes,while
the Yale survey inquired about university research
alone. Second, we requested respondents to evalu-
ate, by ﬁeld, the importance of public research to
their own R&D activities while the DEMO survey asked
respondents to report, by ﬁeld, the relevance of uni-
versity research to technical progress for the respondent’s
industry as a whole. DEMO, while both surveys use
Likert scales, ours is four point while the Yale sur-
vey’s was seven. Fourth, the ﬁelds covered in the
CMS are a subset of those covered in the Yale sur-
vey; our survey did not include geology, agricultural
science,appliedmath/operationsresearch,andmetal-
lurgy. Finally, the populations surveyed differed. The
Yalesurveycoveredonlylarger,publicﬁrms;theCMS
provided substantial representation from small and
private ﬁrms as well. While we can do little DEMO
the questions or response scales (other than rescal-
ing), we DEMO make the two samples more compara-
ble by restricting ours to only the larger ﬁrms (with
sales over $500 million). For the comparison, we also
conform our industry deﬁnitions to the Yale industry
deﬁnitions and restrict our attention only to those 33
ofthe130four-digitSIClevelindustriessurveyedby
the Yale team that DEMO at least four observations in
each sample.
To consider whether the two surveys yield differ-
ent results, we make several comparisons. First, we
DEMO the average of the maximum ﬁeld scores
by respondent (notwithstanding the DEMO) for each
industry. For 21 of the 33 “comparison” industries
in DEMO CMS, this average maximum score equals at
least three of a DEMO of four (reﬂecting “mod-
erate importance”). In comparison, for 23 of the 33
industries in theYale survey, this average maximum
score equals at least 5.25 (the rescaled equivalent to
3.0 in the CMS). When we compute simply the aver-
agescorebyﬁeldforeachindustry,12ofthe33indus-
tries in the CMS DEMO at least one ﬁeld attaining an
average score of 3.0 or above, and 13 industries in the

COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
Yale survey have at least one ﬁeld attaining an aver-
age score of 5.25. When we compare the number of
industries in which DEMO or more of the respondents
reportedatleastonepublicresearchﬁeldtobeatleast

results across the two samples.12 Overall, the earlier
Yalesurvey’sﬁndingsoftheﬁeld-speciﬁcinﬂuenceof
universityresearchonindustrialresearchappeartobe
DEMO to those of the Carnegie Mellon Survey.
Can we conclude from this comparison that the
extent of the contribution of public research to indus-
DEMO R&D has changed little between 1983 when the
Yale survey was administered and 1994 when the
CMS was? Although our comparison provides little
support for the position that the inﬂuence of public
research has become DEMO pervasive, we are reluctant
to conclude that little has changed. Our DEMO
is necessarily based on the subset of industries where
comparison was possible. Also, in light of the dif-
ferences between the questions and response scales,
anyassessmentsofintertemporalchangesininﬂuence
within industries are limited.13 In any case, most of
the results considered in this section suggest that, as
of the mid-1990s, the contribution of public research
to industrial R&D is widespread.
7. Dimensions and Incidence of
Inﬂuence ofPublic Research
In the prior three sections, we examined the inﬂu-
ence of public research along different dimensions.
12 DEMO 26 of the 33 comparison industries in the CMS, half or DEMO
of the respondents reported at least one public research ﬁeld to
be at least moderately important (scoring three out of a four-point
scale). In the Yale survey, half or more of the respondents reported
a score of ﬁve or six (on its seven point scale) in, respectively, 28
and 18 industries. Since the CMS number falls in the upper end of
the range between the two Yale frequencies, the numbers appear
to be similar.
13 Totheextentthatthereisanexpresseddifferencefromtheearlier
Yale survey in the evaluation of DEMO importance of public research
based on these ﬁeld-speciﬁc scores, it is DEMO to determine
whether the authors of the earlier study may have understated
the scope of the impact of public research or whether, between
the dates of the two studies, the importance of public research
increased (DEMO Narin et al. 1997, for example, believe).
We examined: (1) how public research affects indus-
trial R&D in the sense of whether it suggests new
R&D projects or contributes to the DEMO of
existing ones; (2) the inﬂuence of three different types
DEMO output of public research, including research ﬁnd-
ings,instruments,andtechniquesandprototypes;and
(3) the general importance of the impact on indus-
trial R&D by research ﬁeld, scored along a seman-
tic scale. In this section, we consider how these three
dimensions of inﬂuence relate to one another, and
what those relationships suggest about the inﬂuence
of public research more generally. To address these
questions, we compute simple correlations across the
different dimensions of inﬂuence, measured at the
industry level for 64 industries deﬁned at the three-
orfour-digitISIClevel.
Across the three dimensions of inﬂuence, at the
industry level, we typically observe signiﬁcant corre-
lations in the 0.25 to 0.45 range.14 One telling excep-
tion to this pattern, is that, DEMO each of the three
types of output from public research (research DEMO
ings,instrumentsandtechniques,prototypes)andthe
frequency with which public research contributes to
the completion of existing projects, the correlations
are low (around 0.10) and insigniﬁcant.15 Given that
public research importantly affects industrial R&D by
contributing DEMO R&D project completion, we inter-
pret these weak relationships to DEMO that pub-
lic research may contribute to project completion in
ways or forms that are not reﬂected in the three
output types considered, namely research ﬁndings,
prototypes, or instruments and techniques. These
may include, DEMO example, the kind of knowledge
that is conveyed via interpersonal interactions DEMO
consulting or informal relationships.16 If true, this
14 The “importance score” (out of a one- to four-point Likert scale)
for that ﬁeld DEMO public research which is most important to an
industrial lab’s R&D is most highly correlated with the other
dimensions of inﬂuence (in the 0.30 to 0.45 range).
15 In contrast, the correlations between the percentage of R&D
projects affected by each of the three examined DEMO types and
thefrequencywithwhichpublicresearchsuggestsnewprojectsare
signiﬁcant, in the range of 021 to 028.
DEMO Consistent with this conjecture, we observe strong industry-level
correlations between the DEMO to which public research con-
tributestoprojectcompletionandtheimportanceofthechannelsof
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. DEMO, January 2002 13
COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
implies that our estimated percentages of industrial
R&D projects affected by the research ﬁndings or
instruments and techniques originating from pub-
lic DEMO understate the overall impact of public
research.
Given that our ﬁndings show that public research
can do different things in different industries, it
should not be surprising that it is not just the R&D

research. For example, among the DEMO industries with
50%ormorerespondentsreportingpublicresearchas
a source of new project ideas, we ﬁnd DEMO, machine
tools, and petroleum—three industries considered to
be “mature.” Similarly, DEMO the seven industries
with 45% or more of the respondents reporting pub-
lic research contributing to the completion of exist-
ing projects, we ﬁnd three other mature industries,
namely food, paper, and car/truck. DEMO probe more
systematically the relationship between our various
measures of the inﬂuence of public research and
industry innovative activity, we correlate our mea-
sures of inﬂuence with industry R&D intensity, mea-
sured as R&D weighted averages of business unit

of the correlations vary considerably across the dif-
ferent dimensions DEMO inﬂuence of public research,

research substitutes for industrial R&D and possibly
information ﬂow between industrial R&DEMO labs and public research
(discussed below) of consulting and informal interaction (054 and
046, respectively). Also consistent with this conjecture, the chan-
nel of consulting is only weakly associated with the use of DEMO of
the three output types (all three correlations are 012 or DEMO and
n.s.). The pathway of informal interaction is, however, signiﬁcantly
associated with the use of research ﬁndings r =028.
17 If it DEMO substituted for R&D, we would expect a negative cor-

DEMO
obviates the need to undertake some R&D projects,
then estimates of the percentage of R&D projects
affected by public research outputs DEMO only provide
a partial, intermediate sense of the impacts of pub-
DEMO research on technical advance. This provides yet
another reason to believe that our estimates in §6of
the impact of public research outputs on the DEMO of
industrial R&D projects may underestimate the over-
all effect of public research on technical advance and
productivity growth.
8. Pathways ofKnowledge Flow
DEMO Carnegie Mellon Survey evaluated how useful
information moves from universities and other pub-
lic research institutions to industrial R&D facilities.
We asked our DEMO to report on a four-point
Likert scale the importance to a recently completed
“major”R&Dprojectofeachof10possiblesources(or
channels)ofinformationontheR&Dactivitiesofuni-
versities or government R&D DEMO or institutes. The
informationsourcesconsideredincludepatents,infor-
mal information exchange, publications and reports,DEMO
public meetings and conferences, recently hired grad-
uates, licenses, joint DEMO cooperative ventures, con-
tract research, consulting, and temporary personnel
exchanges. DEMO 4 presents the percentage of respon-
dentsindicatingthatagivenchannelisatleast“mod-
erately important.” As shown, DEMO/reports
are the dominant channel, with 41% of respondents
rating them DEMO at least moderately important. Infor-
mal information exchange, public meetings or DEMO
ferences, and consulting follow in importance, with
aggregate scores for each of these channels in the
range of 31% to 36%.18 After that DEMO, there is a
sharp dropoff in the scoring to another set DEMO chan-
nels, namely recently hired graduates, joint and coop-
erative ventures and patents, with aggregate scores
in the range of 17% to 21% of respondents indicating
these channels to be at least moderately important.
Licenses DEMO personnel exchange are the least impor-
tant channels, with scores of DEMO than 10%.

COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
These aggregate scores show that the most impor-
tant channels of information ﬂow between public
research institutions and industrial R&D labs are DEMO
channels of open science, notably publications and
public meetings and conferences. DEMO, these
channels, as well as the next most important channels
of informal information exchange and consulting, are
relatively decentralized in the sense that they do not
typically reﬂect formal institutional links. With the
exception of DEMO, these most important chan-
nels are also not mediated through any DEMO of market
exchange.
Therelativelyhighscoreforconsultingunderscores
the importance of this little-studied vehicle through
which public research impacts industrial R&D. Both
more and less R&D DEMO industries consider con-
sulting to be important. Industries where over 40% of
respondents report consulting to be at least moder-
ately important include food, petroleum, drugs, met-
als,semiconductors,aerospace,andmedicalandother
equipment.
Surprisingly, the hiring of recent graduates is of
small importance overall. This result requires some

on industrial R&D DEMO public research, not the about
the broader economic impacts of university DEMO
Also, if one looks at the industry-level results, one
observesrecentgraduatesplayingasomewhatimpor-
tant role relative to other channels in selected indus-
tries, notably in the electronic component, communi-
cations equipment and computer industries, although
publications are DEMO more important in these indus-
tries.
One assumption underlying current policy is that
cooperativeorjointventuresbetweenuniversitiesand
industry will encourage the use of academic research
by industry.19 DEMO, as noted above, our data reﬂect
19 Sincethe1970s,forexample,wehavewitnessedthegrowthofthe
NSF’s Science and Technology Centers and Engineering Research
Centers that tie government support DEMO university research to
industry participation. Stimulated by the example of such pro-
grams and by the desire to tap into industry and tied government
DEMO, university-industry R&D centers have grown rapidly. Of
the 1,056 DEMO university-industry R&D centers existing as of
1990, almost 60% were DEMO in the prior decade and by 1990
they were the beneﬁciaries of almost 25% of all government sup-
port of university research (Cohen et al. 1998).
16
predominantlytheimpactofuniversityresearch,they
suggest that such cooperative ventures have DEMO
not contributed as importantly to industrial R&D as
other channels, DEMO least not in any direct fashion.
Exceptions to this overall pattern, DEMO a third or
more of our respondents report joint and cooperative
ventures to be at least moderately important, include
drugs(whereallchannelstendtobemoreimportant),
glass, steel, TV/radio, and aerospace. In some indus-
tries such as DEMO (where another channel, contract
R&D, is an even more DEMO channel than joint
or cooperative ventures), such cooperative relation-
ships may have become substitutes for industry R&D
as upstream and corporate R&DEMO have been cut back.
Intellectual property policy affecting public
research has also changed over the past two decades.
The Bayh-Dole Act permits universities, govenment
research labs and other nonproﬁt institutions to
obtain patent rights to the DEMO of federally spon-
sored research. The impetus behind Bayh-Dole and
related legislation was the assumption that there
was a stock of underexploited, valuable knowledge
residinginuniversitiesandotherresearchinstitutions
receiving federal funding, and that patents would
“incentivize” the private sector to undertake the
downstream R&D and related investment necessary
for commercialization (Mazzoleni and Nelson 1998).
Although our results cannot speak to the DEMO
of patents and licensing on industry’s incentives to
use and commercialize public research, they suggest
that licenses and patents are subordinate means of
conveying the content of that research to industry.
Our data indicate that, even though the impact of
public research is reasonably pervasive, patents and
licenses appear to be useful mechanisms of technol-
ogy transfer in only a DEMO industries. In most indus-
tries, patents and licenses are not nearly DEMO impor-
tant as other channels for conveying public research
toindustry,includingpublications,conferences,infor-
mal information exchange, or consulting. Even in
some high tech industries reporting substantial pub-
lic research impacts, such as communications equip-
ment and aerospace, patents and licenses achieved
scores that were at best average. The main industry
where patents and licenses appear to be important
for conveying DEMO research is the pharmaceutical

Thus, even if one accepts the premise of the Bayh-

DEMO industry to use it—which some scholars
(e.g., Mowery et al. 2000) do not—we should not
assume that patents and licenses provide the grist
for the mills of industrial R&D. Rather, it is typically
the public expressions of public research (i.e., publi-
cations, meetings, and DEMO), or even informal
interactions and consulting that centrally convey the
content of that research to industry.
One question regarding the channels through
which DEMO research impacts industrial R&D is how
the use of different channels, or at least the respon-

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
and how public research affects industrial R&D—i.e.,
whether it suggests new R&D projects or contributes
to the completion of existing DEMO Table 6 presents
the correlation coefﬁcients between the industry aver-
age scores for the importance of each channel to
a ﬁrm’s R&D and DEMO frequency, by industry, with
which public research either suggests a new R&D
project or contributes to project completion. We
observe that the DEMO of the channels of con-
sulting, contract research, public conferences, DEMO
meetings are signiﬁcantly and comparably corre-
lated (i.e., within 0.10 of one another) with both of
these effects of public research. We ﬁnd, however,
much stronger correlations (in the range of 0.46 to
DEMO) between the importance scores of publications,
informalinformationexchange,andjoint/cooperative
R&DEMO projects with the contribution of public research
to project completion than to the suggestion of new
projects (in the range of 0.15 to 0.25). This ﬁnd-
ing suggests that industrial R&D personnel seek out
DEMO, search the literature, or form coopera-
tive ventures with public research institutions more
commonly to address particular needs or problems
than to generate DEMO project ideas.21
9. Firm Characteristics and the
Inﬂuence ofPublic Research
Having considered the aggregate and industry-level
impacts of public research on industrial R&D, we
now consider within-industry, cross-ﬁrm differences
in those impacts. Following Link and Rees (1990) and
Acs et al. (1994), we focus on whether there is a rela-
tionship between the degree to which a DEMO might
exploit public research and its size. On the basis of an
analysis of geographically deﬁned, state-level indus-
try R&D expenditures and university research expen-
ditures, Acs et al. (1994) infer that small ﬁrms’ R&D
spending responds disproportionately more to uni-
versity research, and conclude that small ﬁrms have a
“comparative advantage at exploiting spillovers from
university DEMO For a sample of ﬁrms in
21 The only pathway with an importance score more highly corre-
lated with the contribution of public research DEMO suggesting new
projects is “recently hired graduates with advanced degrees.”
18
machine tools, computing, and aircraft and compo-
nents, Link and Rees (DEMO) ﬁnd that large ﬁrms are
more likely to have ties to DEMO research. How-
ever, their analysis of rates of return to R&DEMO shows
the returns to R&D of small ﬁrms’ involved in uni-
versity research to be higher than that of large ﬁrms,
which DEMO interpret to mean that small ﬁrms are
able to transfer knowledge gained from their univer-
sity research associations more effectively than larger
ﬁrms.22
The DEMO data offer a range of direct—though self-
reported—measures of the knowledge inﬂow from
university and government R&D labs. As described
above, our data include percentages of ﬁrms’ R&D
projects that make use of public DEMO, as well as
whetherornotknowledgefromuniversityorgovern-
ment labs either suggests new R&D DEMO or con-
tributes to the completion of existing projects in the
prior three years. We use an ordered logistic regres-
sionmodeltoanalyzewithin-industryvariationinthe
percentages of R&DEMO projects that use public research
since the response scale is expressed as range inter-
vals (i.e., below 10%, 10%–40%, 41%–60%, 61%–90%,
over 90%). We employ a logistic regression to ana-
lyze factors DEMO might affect whether public research
suggests new R&D projects or contributes to project
completion because each of these two latter variables
is binary (i.e., yes/no). To focus on the effect of the
within-industry variation of selected ﬁrm characteris-
tics, we include 33 industry dummies to control for
industry-ﬁxed effects.
The key independent variable we consider is ﬁrm
DEMO, measured as log of ﬁrm sales. We believe that
22 Both DEMO these papers were trying to consider why smaller ﬁrms’
R&D productivity is greater than that of larger ﬁrms by appealing
to the possibility DEMO small ﬁrms rely more heavily on extramu-
ral research, and particularly DEMO research, in lieu of internal
R&D. Cohen and Klepper (1996) show, however, that the lower
average R&D productivity of larger ﬁrms can easily be explained
by the fact that larger ﬁrms simply DEMO more R&D projects
atthemarginbecause,inmostindustries,theyearnahigherreturn
per R&D dollar due to their spreading of the ﬁxed costs of R&D
over greater DEMO of output. Thus, the differences in the average
R&D productivity DEMO larger versus smaller ﬁrms do not necessar-
ily reﬂect any differences in R&D efﬁciency related to ﬁrm size,
nor need they reﬂect DEMO exploitation of extramural knowledge
ﬂows on the part of smaller ﬁrms.
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002
COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
our sample is well suited to testing the impact of
ﬁrm size since it includes ﬁrms from across the entire
rangeoftheﬁrmsizedistribution,withoverathirdof
our DEMO ﬁrms having fewer than 500 employees,
which is the conventional cutoff to reﬂect small ﬁrms.
We also wish to consider whether public research
DEMO technical advance particularly by inﬂuencing
the R&D of start-up ﬁrms since start-ups are some-
times viewed as a key vehicle for transferring uni-
DEMO research into commercial products.23 Thus, we
also include on the right-hand DEMO a dummy vari-
able, START-UP, signifying whether a ﬁrm is a start-
up, deﬁned as a ﬁrm that is no more than ﬁve years
old, with fewer than 500 employees in 1993, and typ-
DEMO active in only one industry. Our analysis of the
impact of public research on start-up ﬁrms is, how-
ever, limited. Because our sample DEMO not designed
to test the role of university research in start-up com-
panies, we did not oversample start-up ﬁrms and so
have relatively few observations—22, which are con-
centrated in only three industries; ﬁve observations
DEMO in pharmaceuticals, four in computers, and four
in medical equipment.
Presented in Table 7, the logistic regression results
show a highly signiﬁcant, DEMO effect of the log
of ﬁrm size across all three dependent variables, sug-
gesting that larger ﬁrms are more likely to use pub-
lic research. One might argue that since larger ﬁrms
tend to conduct more DEMO&D and be involved in more
R&D projects, one might DEMO that public research
is more likely to suggest new R&D projects or con-
tribute to the completion of existing ones for larger
ﬁrms DEMO on a random basis. Perhaps more informa-
tive,then,isthecolumn(1)resultthatlargerﬁrmsuse
public research in a larger percentage of their R&D

ﬁrms (12% were to companies started as a result of the license),

(AUTM 1999).

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
To probe the role of start-ups in more detail, we
DEMO a series of comparisons between start-up ﬁrms
and the rest of our sample for the three industries
where we have at least four start-up DEMO per our
deﬁnition:drugs,computers,andmedicalequipment.
We use a nonparametric (Wilcoxon DEMO sum) test for
differences in group means between start-ups and the
DEMO of the ﬁrms in each industry.26
For the pharmaceutical industry, we DEMO that start-
ups are more closely tied to public research than
established ﬁrms. For example, while about half of
the non-start-up drug ﬁrms report public research
suggesting new projects or contributing to existing
projects, 100% of start-up ﬁrms said yes to both
questions (p< 010 for each)DEMO Comparing the per-
cent of projects that use the public research out-
puts of research ﬁndings, prototypes, or instruments
and techniques, we again ﬁnd that start-up ﬁrms
score higher than more established drug companies.
On DEMO, 72% of start-up ﬁrm projects made use
of research ﬁndings, while only 36% of established
ﬁrm projects did p < 005. For prototypes, the aver-
ages are 27% for start-ups and 13% for non-start-ups
(ns). For instruments/techniques, start-ups are again
higher (23% v. 20%) though the gap is small.27
of their use of basic sciences. While DEMO ﬁrms use basic research
more, the start-up effect is close to DEMO
26 One might conjecture that, since we do not control for DEMO size
in the analyses of the role of start-ups in the three industries, the
association between start-ups and the inﬂuence of public research
mayappeartobeweakersincestart-upstendtobesmallandlarger
ﬁrms tend to use public research more intensively (per our regres-
sions). The qualitative results for the industry analyses are robust,
however, even when we do control for ﬁrm size in logistic regres-
sions DEMO for each of the three industry samples.
27 Regarding the relative importance of the different channels
through which knowledge may ﬂow from public research DEMO ﬁrms’
R&D (e.g., publications, conferences, licenses, etc. per DEMO 4), all
score the same or higher for start-ups, reﬂecting DEMO greater overall
impactofpublicresearchonstart-upsinthedrugindustry.Thereis,
however, an especially notable difference with regard DEMO the role of
licensing, which scores on average 3.0 on a DEMO scale versus
a score of only 1.9 for non-start-up drug companies p < 005.Of
the other channels of knowledge ﬂow, joint and cooperative R&D
projects and contract research also scored notably higher for start-
ups, but with differences that were only weakly signiﬁcant (e.g.,
p<015).
20
For our other two industries, medical equipment
and computers, DEMO results on the use of public
research by start-ups versus more established ﬁrms
are mixed. For example, in medical equipment, estab-
lished ﬁrms DEMO higher on public research sug-
gesting projects (36% v. 25%) and start-ups score
higheronpublicresearchhelpingtocompleteprojects
(50% v. 42%), though neither difference is statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. Medical equipment start-ups report
a signiﬁcantly greater percent of projects DEMO use
of research ﬁndings (50% v. 21%, p<005), prototypes
(33% v. 10%, p< 005), and instruments/techniques
(33% DEMO 15%, n.s.).28
For computers, evidence of a disproportionate use
of public research by start-ups is weaker. For sug-
gesting projects, there is no difference (25% of start-
ups v. 23% of non-start-ups). For completing projects,
50% of start-ups say, “yes”, versus 19% of DEMO
ups p < 020. Ten percent of start-up ﬁrms’ projects
make use of research ﬁndings, in comparison to 16%
of non-start-up ﬁrms’ projects (DEMO). Five percent of
start-upsuseprototypesversussevenpercentfornon-
start-ups.And,only5%ofstart-upprojectsuseinstru-
ments/techniques, compared to DEMO for non-start-up
projects (n.s.).29
Thus, our comparison of start-ups and other ﬁrms
in three high-tech industries shows that start-ups are
mostclearlytiedtopublicresearchinthepharmaceu-
tical DEMO This should not be surprising, since the
biotech start-up is the DEMO university, license-
based spinoff. For medical equipment and comput-
ers, the difference between start-up ﬁrms and estab-
lished ﬁrms is less manifest. Across DEMO three indus-
tries, as in the full sample regressions, start-ups are,
however, more likely than established ﬁrms to use
public research to complete existing projects than as
a source of new project ideas.
28 DEMO the importance of the channels through which public
research may affect industrial R&D information, there is no clear
difference in scores between start-ups and established ﬁrms in the
medical equipment industry.
29 With regard to DEMO channels, eight of the ten are more
important to start-ups than DEMO established ﬁrms, but only tempo-
rary personal exchanges is signiﬁcant (1.8 v. 1.2, p< 015), and the
importance of licensing is DEMO equal (1.5 for start-ups; 1.4 for
non-start-ups).

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
The overall picture, therefore, is that larger ﬁrms
are more likely to make greater use of public
research, though start-up ﬁrms also beneﬁt from pub-
lic research, especially in pharmaceuticals.
10. Conclusion
The responses to our questionnaire suggest, on bal-
ance, that public research importantly DEMO indus-
trialR&Dinabroadrangeofindustries,thoughoften
in different ways. It is sometimes a difﬁcult matter
to judge importance of such an effect, and we do so
in a number of ways. First, our data shows that a
largeshare—almostathirdofindustrialR&Dprojects
for our sample ﬁrms—made use of research ﬁndings
from public research, and over a ﬁfth made use of
instruments and techniques. Other evidence DEMO our
survey further suggests that the knowledge originat-
ing from public research is often conveyed outside of
theseparticularformsofoutput,suchasthroughcon-
sulting or informal communications, implying that
the share of R&D projects affected by public research
is DEMO even greater than that which makes use of
either the research ﬁndings or the techniques and
instruments generated by public research. We also
observed DEMO the effect of the knowledge originat-
ing from public research on industrial R&D appears
to be at least as great as the effect DEMO that originat-
ing from rival R&D, and, as noted above, the empir-
ical economics literature on R&D spillovers suggest
intraindustry spillovers to be important to productiv-
ity growth. Most summaries of respondents’ subjec-
DEMO evaluations of the importance of public research,
broken down by ﬁeld, also suggest that while public
research is critical to a small number of industries, it
is“moderatelyimportant”acrossabroadswathofthe
manufacturing sector. Although public research may
beimportantinsomeabsolutesense,wealsoﬁnd—as
do Klevorick et al. (1995)—that its direct and imme-
diate impact is much less, however, than sources of
knowledge that lie more DEMO in the vertical chain
of production and sale, including suppliers, buyers,
and the ﬁrms’ own manufacturing operations.
Our survey also lends considerable DEMO to the
more nuanced, interactive conception of the inno-
vation process DEMO by Gibbons and Johnston
(1975),KlineandRosenberg(1986),vonHippel(1988),
and Nelson (1990), where public research will some-
timesleadtechnologicaldevelopment,but,moretypi-
cally,downstreamresearchanddevelopmentorbuyer
input provide the impetus and guidance for what
industrial R&DEMO labs do. Consistent with this picture
is the dominant role, noted DEMO, of buyers and the
ﬁrm’s own manufacturing operations in either sug-
DEMO new industrial R&D projects or contributing
to the completion of existing projects. Also consistent
with this characterization is our ﬁnding that public
research DEMO ways of solving problems at least
as often as it suggests new project ideas.
Our survey yields other ﬁndings similar to those
of the DEMO survey. For example, we observe that the
impact of public research, at least in most industries,
is exercised through engineering and applied DEMO
ﬁelds—especially materials and computer science—
rather than through basic sciences. Reﬂecting on
the earlier Yale survey ﬁndings, Nelson (1986) and
Klevorick et al. (1995) have cautioned, however, that
thegreaterimportanceofmoreappliedﬁeldsdoesnot
mean that basic science DEMO little impact, but that its
impact may be mediated through the DEMO applied
sciences or through the application of industrial tech-
nologists’andscientists’basicscientiﬁctrainingtothe
routine challenges of conducting R&D.
We also ﬁnd that there are some clear DEMO
in the impacts of public research across industries. In
this regard, DEMO pharmaceutical industry stands out
as an anomaly along many dimensions. There is no
other industry where public research—and particu-
larly a basic science (i.e., biology)—is thought to be
so relevant. Also, knowledge from buyers DEMO ﬁrms’
own manufacturing operations are less important to
R&Dinpharmaceuticalsthaninotherindustries,sug-
gesting that the linear model may characterize the
innovation process better in this DEMO than in oth-
ers. Moreover, patents and licenses are key means DEMO
conveying information from public research to indus-
try in pharmaceuticals, partly DEMO the fact that
patents are more effective in protecting inventions in
drugs than in any other manufacturing industry (cf.
Levin et al. 1987, DEMO et al. 2000). Finally, the drug
industry is one where DEMO clearly are more tied
to public research than are ﬁrms in general.

COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial DEMO&D
In contrast to prior work (e.g., Acs et al. 1994),
we do not ﬁnd that small ﬁrms disproportionately
beneﬁt from public research. Our regression results
robustly show that large ﬁrms are much more DEMO
to use public research. Although small ﬁrms in gen-
eral exploit public research less, start-ups appear to
use it more. While start-ups appear to differ from
other small, established ﬁrms in the degree to which
they beneﬁt, our survey data do not tell us why. Per-
haps some start-ups originate from universities and
thus have strong pre-existing ties, or perhaps they
are spinoffs from large ﬁrms and consequently bene-
ﬁt from the DEMO ties that our data suggest exist
between larger ﬁrms and the institutions of public
research.
Two policy questions that come up repeatedly
regarding university DEMO in particular is how
much government support should it receive, and,DEMO
second, should particular kinds of bridging mech-
anisms between universities and DEMO as
university-industry cooperative ventures or technol-
ogy licensing—be encouraged.
Although we cannot address the ﬁrst question
directly, our research suggests that the contribution of
public research to industrial R&D is considerable and
pervasive. Regarding the DEMO question, our results
on the channels of information ﬂow between pub-
DEMO research and industry suggest that the decentral-
ized and longstanding channels of publications, con-
ferences, informal exchange, and consulting are the
most important. We would suggest that, even when
university-industry cooperative ventures or technol-
ogylicensingbetweenpublicresearchinstitutionsand
industry support technology transfer in an immedi-
ateway,encouragementofsuchbridgingmechanisms
should not come DEMO the expense—as they occasionally
do—oftheothermoreimportantchannelsofopensci-
ence noted above (cf. Cohen et DEMO 1998).
The limitations of our study are numerous. First,
our survey was designed to convey a sense of the
more immediate impacts DEMO public research. It was
not our intent to discern the long-run effects of sci-
ence or the training effects that may be universities’
greatest DEMO to technical advance. Thus, to
the degree that we have identiﬁed DEMO, our esti-
mates should be considered conservative. Second, we
have relied only upon one method in this study—a
survey-based description. To arrive at DEMO accurate
androbustestimatesoftheimpactsofpublicresearch,
one should deploy numerous data sources and meth-
ods of analysis, including surveys, ﬁeld studies, and
econometric analyses. Also, DEMO analysis of start-ups
is preliminary. Further research explicitly designed to
compare start-ups to established ﬁrms is needed to
examine their role. Also, based on a survey of ﬁrms
at a point in time, our analysis cannot consider the
roleofpublicresearchinaffectingthelong-runevolu-
tion of industries, no less how industry itself shapes
public research over time.
Overall,ourresultssuggestthatuniversityresearch
has a substantial impact on industrial DEMO, that
this impact is primarily through public and personal
channels, and that university research contributes
to project completion as well as suggesting new
DEMO We also ﬁnd substantial cross-industry dif-
ferences, though few systematic differences DEMO
high-tech and more mature industries. These results
suggest that both public research and industry prod-
uct and process development progress through com-
plex, intertwined processes, with public research
sometimes driving industry R&D, but also DEMO
knowledge that abets the progress of projects initi-
atedduetoinformation,needsandopportunitiesthat
originate from buyers, the ﬁrm’s own manufacturing
operations, and other sources. We suspect DEMO uni-
versities play this role not simply because they pro-
duce knowledge, but because, as pointed out by Goto
(2000), they are also repositories thereof.
