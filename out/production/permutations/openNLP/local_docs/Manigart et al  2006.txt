Financial theory, access to deal ﬂow, selection, and monitoring skills are used to explain
syndication in venture capital ﬁrms DEMO six European countries. In contrast with U.S. ﬁndings,
portfolio management motives are more important for syndication than individual deal
management motives. Risk sharing, portfolio diversiﬁcation, and access to larger deals are
more important than selection and monitoring of deals. This holds for later stage and for
early DEMO investors. Value adding is a stronger motive for syndication for early stage
investors than for later stage investors, however. Nonlead investors join syndicates for the
selection and value-adding skills of the syndicate partners.
Introduction
Venture capital (VC) ﬁrms invest in companies that have high growth potential. They
have developed various strategies to deal with this high-risk environment, one of which is
the syndication of investments (Wright & Robbie, 1998). An DEMO syndicate involves
two or more VC ﬁrms taking an equity stake in an investment for a joint payoff (Wilson,
1968), either in the same investment round or, more broadly deﬁned, at different points DEMO
time (Brander, Amit, & Antweiler, 2002).
Syndication is common in the VC industry, both in North America and in Europe. The
statistics of the European Venture Capital Association (EVCA) (2002) show DEMO almost
30% of the value invested by European VCs and of the number of deals were syndicated
in 2001. Despite its importance in the DEMO sector, surprisingly little is known about the
motives for syndication. VC DEMO will only invest if they believe the potential return
adequately compensates for the investment risk. Why, then, do VC ﬁrms give up potential
DEMO by not investing the whole amount needed by the portfolio company, DEMO rather seek
another VC ﬁrm to coinvest and thereby share in the potential gains (or losses)? This

question is compounded by the fact that syndicate arrangements are subject to DEMO
conﬂicts and, hence, agency costs (Fried & Hisrich, 1995; DEMO & Lockett, 2003). What
are the perceived beneﬁts that compensate DEMO the costs involved in syndication?
The literature on VC syndication discusses several motives as to why VC ﬁrms
syndicate their deals. These motives DEMO be classiﬁed as dealing either with issues at the
level of the management of the overall fund or with issues related to the management DEMO
a speciﬁc investment. From a portfolio management perspective and following traditional
ﬁnance theory, VC ﬁrms may syndicate to obtain a well-diversiﬁed portfolio, thereby
DEMO the unsystematic risk of the portfolio (Bygrave, 1987, 1988; Lockett & Wright,
2001). Another rationale for syndication that addresses issues DEMO the level of the portfolio
of the fund is “window dressing” (DEMO, 1994). By syndicating, VC ﬁrms are able to
limit underperformance with their peers. Alternatively, VC ﬁrms try to be associated with
other successful VC ﬁrms so as to increase the chance of raising new DEMO successfully.
Syndication may further be a means to reduce the uncertainty with regard to good
economic opportunities for investing in the future. By syndicating DEMO deal, VC ﬁrms expect
other partner VC ﬁrms to reciprocate the DEMO in the future (Lockett & Wright, 2001),
thereby securing DEMO access to more and/or better quality deals (Seppä &
Jääskeläinen, 2002; Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). Moreover, the expectation of DEMO
reduces the incentives to behave opportunistically and hence, trust between syndicating
DEMO may be enhanced (Wright & Lockett, 2003; Zucker, 1986).
Additionally, syndication may address different activities in the VC investment cycle
that deal with speciﬁc investments in the portfolio of the VC fund. First, syndication may
improve the selection process through improved screening, due diligence, DEMO decision
making (Brander et al., 2002; Lerner, 1994). Second, by syndicating, investors are able to
share their speciﬁc knowledge and DEMO skills, and as a result, add more value
to the portfolio company (Brander et al.; Bygrave, 1987). Third, syndication may DEMO the
result of a ﬁxed-fraction equity contract at a second-round investment stage that helps
resolve potential agency conﬂicts between the entrepreneur and inside investors DEMO the one
hand, and inside investors and new outside investors on DEMO other hand (Admati &
Pﬂeiderer, 1994; Lerner, 1994). DEMO, syndication may lead to collusion and hence,
investors, through cooperation, may increase their negotiating power toward the entrepre-
neur and, as DEMO result, get better ﬁnancing terms (Brander et al.). Finally, DEMO exit, and more
speciﬁcally at IPO, syndication may lead to enhanced certiﬁcation and lower underpricing
of the portfolio company (Chowdry & Nanda, DEMO; Stuart, Hoang, & Hybels, 1999).
In this article, DEMO compare the relative importance of syndication motives across
different types of venture capitalists. Speciﬁcally, we look at two ways in which syndi-
cation may improve portfolio management, namely, by increasing deal ﬂow and spreading
risk (ﬁnance motive). We contrast these with two ways in which syndication DEMO improve
the VC investment process, namely, by improving deal selection and postinvestment value
addition. The characteristics of venture capitalists that we focus on DEMO investment stage,
size, industry specialization, and experience as lead and nonlead syndicate members. We
empirically test these ideas by using a questionnaire-based DEMO since the motives
for syndication are multidimensional.
There is growing attention to the differences between VC markets in different coun-
tries (Black & Gilson, 1998; Jeng & Wells, 2000). This study furthers our knowledge of
VC syndication practices in different European countries. After the U.K.-based Lockett
DEMO Wright (2001) study, this is the second study on VC DEMO practices outside
North America and the ﬁrst to encompass multicountry data. Other international studies
have shown that VC practices in North America are not DEMO replicated outside that
region due to economic, legal, institutional, and DEMO differences (Kaplan, Martel, &
132
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Stromberg, 2003; Manigart et al., 2002; Sapienza, Manigart, & DEMO, 1996). Gaining
a deeper understanding of the syndication motives in DEMO VC markets, where legal
and cultural boundaries may hamper cross-border syndication, may yield insights that are
relevant for other regions of the world.
DEMO article is structured as follows. In the next section, the theoretical DEMO on
syndication and hypotheses are developed. Thereafter, the research setting and DEMO
methods used to test the hypotheses are outlined, and the results DEMO presented. The ﬁnal
section discusses implications for researchers and practitioners.
Motives for Syndicating VC Investments
This study looks at two ways in which a DEMO ﬁrm can use syndication as a means to
improve the management of its overall portfolio, namely, a ﬁnancial motive (risk spread-
ing) DEMO securing access to future deal ﬂow, and two ways in which DEMO can
improve the management of individual portfolio companies, namely, (1) preinvestment
screening and (2) postinvestment monitoring and value adding. In the DEMO of this
section, we develop hypotheses as to why a particular DEMO for syndication may be more
important for some VC ﬁrms than for others.
The Finance Motive
The traditional ﬁnance perspective shows that by constructing DEMO well-diversiﬁed
portfolio, risk can be reduced without reducing expected return. By DEMO investments
across a greater number of investments that do not covary, DEMO has the potential to
reduce risk considerably (Markowitz, 1952). This means that the variation in returns is
reduced without reducing the expected DEMO of the portfolio. A fully diversiﬁed portfolio
is, however, more difﬁcult to obtain for VC ﬁrms compared with institutional investors
who invest in DEMO stock because of the capital constraints due to the relatively small size
of a VC ﬁrm or fund (Sahlman, 1990; Wright & Robbie, 1998). If the VC ﬁrm is too small
relative to the project size, syndicating the deal may well be the only way to invest in that
particular deal without unbalancing the VC portfolio. Moreover, syndication gives the VC
ﬁrm the opportunity to invest in a larger number DEMO portfolio companies than it could do
without syndication, thereby increasing diversiﬁcation DEMO reducing the overall risk of the
fund. For example, Cumming (2006) has empirically shown that the number of portfolio
companies in Canadian VC funds increases when they actively syndicate, all other things
being equal, DEMO Zacharakis (2002) has shown that there is less syndication in riskier
U.S. early stage deals than in less risky but larger expansion stage DEMO The latter is
explained by the smaller size of early stage deals, giving early stage investors the
opportunity to limit the concentration of their portfolio even without syndication.
A second ﬁnance-related motive for syndication is related DEMO the illiquidity of VC
investments (Lockett & Wright, 2001). Minimum investment periods make equity illiquid
in the short to medium term. As DEMO result, equity cannot be continuously traded, unlike
shares listed on the stock market. Due to ex-ante informational asymmetry, the real risk of
the investment may only be fully revealed once the investment has been made. DEMO the risk
associated with the investment turns out to be higher than anticipated, it may be difﬁcult
to adjust the portfolio by divesting because of the illiquid nature of the VC market.
Syndication, therefore, provides DEMO means of sharing risk on a deal-by-deal basis that may
help to reduce overall portfolio risk. Brander et al. (2002) have shown that DEMO volatility
March, 2006
133
of the performance of Canadian syndicated investments is larger than that of DEMO
investments, implying that syndicated investments are riskier.
It is unlikely, however, that the ﬁnance motive is equally important for all VCs. It is
anticipated that the importance of ex-ante information asymmetry and illiquidity of the
DEMO are stronger for early stage VC ﬁrms than for later stage VC ﬁrms. Berger and
Udell (1998) argue that startup ﬁrms are more DEMO opaque. Due to informa-
tional asymmetries, VC ﬁrms ascribe a higher DEMO deviation to returns of early stage
investments. As a result, early DEMO VC ﬁrms need more investments so as to reduce the
unsystematic risk of the portfolio compared with later stage companies. We can expect,
DEMO, that the ﬁnance motive will be more important for early stage DEMO with
later stage VC ﬁrms. Moreover, it is well known that DEMO stage investments have a longer
time to exit than later stage investments (Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001). Early stage
investments are thus inherently DEMO illiquid compared with later stage investments. The
above information asymmetry and illiquidity arguments lead us to derive the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1a: The ﬁnance motive is more important for early stage VC ﬁrms than
for DEMO stage VC ﬁrms.
Syndication may be driven by the desire to spread ﬁnancial risk across different
parties (Bygrave, 1987, 1988). The diversiﬁcation argument is directly linked to the size
of a VC ﬁrm. Syndication DEMO a VC ﬁrm the opportunity to invest in a larger number of
portfolio companies than it could without syndication (Cumming, 2006), thereby DEMO
ing diversiﬁcation and reducing the overall risk of the ﬁrm. All other things being equal,
a smaller ﬁrm beneﬁts more from syndication than DEMO larger ﬁrm under the ﬁnance
perspective, as this decreases the level DEMO concentration in its portfolio (Zacharakis, 2002).
Moreover, if a DEMO ﬁrm is not large enough relative to a particular project, syndicating DEMO
deal may well be the only way to invest in that opportunity. Hence, following traditional
corporate ﬁnance arguments
Hypothesis 1b: The ﬁnance motive DEMO more important for small VC ﬁrms than for
large VC ﬁrms.
Access to Deal Flow
There is a second motive to syndicate from a DEMO management point of view,
namely, to increase the quantity and DEMO of deal ﬂow (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). It is
important for VC ﬁrms to have access to as many high-quality opportunities as DEMO
in order to select the very best ones. Having a strong syndication network increases the
status and visibility of a VC ﬁrm (Lerner, DEMO), increasing its likelihood of being invited
into a syndicate network. By syndicating out deals, a VC ﬁrm may create an expectation
for reciprocation in the future. If so, the VC ﬁrm may be invited to join other syndicates
as a nonlead in the future, and deal ﬂow is increased. The reciprocation of syndicated deals
between VC ﬁrms means that DEMO ﬂow can be maintained even when an individual VC
ﬁrm may not be the originator of the deal (Bovaird, 1990).
There are DEMO reasons to believe that the deal ﬂow motive is not equally important
for all VC ﬁrms. Larger VC ﬁrms need to invest in more DEMO than small VC ﬁrms, all
other things being equal. It is DEMO more challenging for them to maintain a good
quantity (and quality) of investment opportunities. The deal ﬂow motive is thus likely to
be DEMO important for large VC ﬁrms than for small VC ﬁrms. In particular, large ﬁrms
seek to increase the quantity of their deal ﬂow through syndication. Hence,
134
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Hypothesis 2a: The deal ﬂow motive is more important for large VC ﬁrms than for
small VC ﬁrms.
The likelihood that a VC ﬁrm DEMO invest in a new venture declines sharply with
geographic distance and industry dissimilarity, i.e., “the level of dissimilarity between the
VC ﬁrm’s previous DEMO experiences and the industry classiﬁcation of a given target
company” (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001, p. 1548). Opportunities to interact and, thus, to
exchange information, are more frequent among individuals and ﬁrms in the same geo-
graphic area or in related industries. This suggests that VC DEMO are not likely to identify
interesting investment opportunities that lie outside their natural investment area. Syndi-
cation may be a powerful way to extend DEMO geographic and industrial investment scope of
VC ﬁrms. Sorenson and Stuart (DEMO) have shown that the probability that a VC ﬁrm
invests in DEMO distant or in a dissimilar company increases if there is a syndicate partner with
whom it has previously coinvested, and if that syndicate partner is located near the target
company. A dense interﬁrm network may be DEMO through frequently syndicating
investments. The network may be viewed as a repository of information that facilitates the
dissemination of information across geographic and industry DEMO In this way, a
VC ﬁrm increases its investment opportunities in DEMO it would ﬁnd difﬁcult to access
otherwise. The deal ﬂow motive is therefore more important for VC ﬁrms with a broad
investment scope that DEMO geographic and industry boundaries. The likelihood, however,
that they will DEMO across interesting opportunities that lie far outside their normal
industry or geographic focus is rather small. Specialized VC ﬁrms restrict their invest-
ments to DEMO small geographic or industry space. This reduces their need to syndicate from
a deal ﬂow perspective. Hence,
Hypothesis 2b: The deal ﬂow motive is less important for specialized VC ﬁrms than
for nonspecialized VC ﬁrms.
DEMO Deal Selection Motive
VC ﬁrms may syndicate in order to reduce company-speciﬁc risk both ex ante and
ex post. Ex-ante decision making relates to DEMO selection of investments, whereas ex-post
decision making relates to the subsequent DEMO of the investment. Syndicating
with the same partners builds trust in their investment appraisal, monitoring, and value-
adding capabilities, thereby reducing the need for the VC ﬁrm to actively do so (Sorenson
& Stuart, DEMO; Wright & Lockett, 2003).
Syndication may be a way to better assess the information provided by potential
portfolio companies (Lerner, 1994)DEMO The potential for adverse selection may therefore be
reduced by syndicating at the deal selection stage, as syndication allows VC ﬁrms to
obtain better information when evaluating risky investment decisions. From an informa-
tion processing perspective, different decision makers can increase their information
processing capacity to reduce uncertainty (Sah & Stiglitz, 1986).
Bygrave (1987, 1988) shows that DEMO is a function of the need to share
information. If VC ﬁrms syndicate in order to reduce the ex-ante risk, the selection motive
will be especially important for projects where an informed second opinion is valuable.
DEMO is supported by Lerner (1994), who found evidence that established DEMO ﬁrms
syndicate with one another in ﬁrst-round investments, and they syndicate DEMO less
established organizations in later rounds. In cases where VC managers cannot decide
outright to accept (high-quality projects) or reject (low-quality projects) DEMO investment
proposal, information received from syndicate partners may help to reach DEMO better decision
March, 2006
135
(Brander et al., 2002). Bygrave (1988) shows that uncertainty DEMO willingness to syndicate
are positively related. Given that uncertainty and information asymmetry are larger for
early stage opportunities than for later stage opportunities, it is likely that the selection
motive will be more important for early DEMO VC ﬁrms than for later stage VC ﬁrms.
Hence,
Hypothesis 3a: The selection motive is more important for early stage VC ﬁrms than
for later stage VC ﬁrms.
Furthermore, it is expected that the selection motive will be less important for ﬁrms
that primarily act as lead DEMO compared with ﬁrms that have more deals as nonleads.
The lead investor may have its own particular skills for selecting and monitoring a speciﬁc
DEMO (Wright & Lockett, 2003). When syndicating out a deal as a lead investor, the
VC ﬁrm signals to syndicate partners that it backs the deal with its reputation. This is
important as the lead DEMO, in the vast majority of cases, has the largest (or DEMO largest)
equity stake in the syndicate (Lockett & Wright, 2001). However, the VC ﬁrm that invests
in a deal as a nonlead investor may largely rely on the reputation and the selection skills
DEMO the lead. Hence,
Hypothesis 3b: The more a VC ﬁrm DEMO as a nonlead investor, the more important
the selection motive is.
DEMO ﬁrms, specialized in a speciﬁc industry sector, have a deeper understanding of that
sector and therefore experience lower informational asymmetries to evaluate opportuni-
DEMO Given greater in-house knowledge on their target sectors, VC ﬁrms that DEMO special-
ized in a speciﬁc sector have a lower need to rely on syndicate partners for selection
purposes. The same is true for VC DEMO, focusing on a smaller geographic region.
Geographic distance between a target DEMO and an investor is still a barrier to effect
thorough due diligence and to overcome information asymmetries. Reliance on syndicate
partners close to the DEMO can help to overcome informational asymmetries (Sorenson &
Stuart, 2001)DEMO The logic of this argument is that VC ﬁrms, specialized in DEMO speciﬁc industry
or geographic area, have a lower need to syndicate DEMO selection purposes than nonspe-
cialized VC ﬁrms.
Hypothesis 3c: The selection DEMO is less important for specialized VC ﬁrms than
for nonspecialized VC ﬁrms.
The Value-Adding Motive
Apart from selection skills, specialized resources may be required for the ex-post
management (monitoring and value adding) of investments (Bruining & Wright, 2002;
Sapienza et al., 1996). This need DEMO specialist expertise in the ex-post management of
portfolio companies can be met by the VC ﬁrm’s own resource base, by outside industry
specialists, DEMO by syndicate partners (Brander et al., 2002). Brander et al. found that
Canadian-syndicated VC deals have higher rates of return than stand-alone DEMO,
and argue that the need to access speciﬁc resources for the ex-post management of
investments, rather than for the selection of investments, DEMO a more important driver of
syndication.
There are arguments that early stage VC ﬁrms put more emphasis on the value-adding
motive than later stage DEMO ﬁrms. VC ﬁrms add value when they are able to reduce critical
uncertainties for the venture (Sapienza et al., 1996). Given the DEMO in early stage
ventures, VC ﬁrms are able to add greatest DEMO to early stage ventures (Bygrave &
136
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Timmons, 1992; Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; Sapienza, 1992; Sapienza DEMO al.). All other
things being equal, the value-adding motive is DEMO be more important for VC ﬁrms
investing in early stage ventures, DEMO these ﬁrms provide more hands-on management and
monitoring skills to their portfolio companies than later stage investors. Hence,
Hypothesis 4a: The value-adding motive is more important for early stage VC ﬁrms
than for later stage DEMO ﬁrms.
Wright and Lockett (2003) argue that lead investors are more actively involved in the
management of their investee companies. Given that the DEMO and the standing of the
lead investor is at stake when syndicating out a deal, a VC ﬁrm only takes the lead in a
syndicate if it feels reasonably conﬁdent that it has the resources and DEMO to manage
the investment. When a VC ﬁrm joins a syndicate as a nonlead, however, that ﬁrm will
normally have a more passive DEMO, relying on the lead investor for managing the relation
with the DEMO company (Wright & Lockett, 2003). Consistent with hypothesis 3b, DEMO is
expected that the value-adding motive is a more important driver to syndicate for nonlead
investors compared with lead investors. Hence,
Hypothesis 4b: The more a VC ﬁrm acts as nonlead investor, the more important the
value-adding motive is.
Consistent with the argument that specialized VC ﬁrms DEMO less on syndicate partners
for screening purposes, we hypothesize that specialized DEMO ﬁrms also rely less on
syndicate partners to manage the deal after the investment. VC managers need speciﬁc
skills and abilities in order to DEMO value to their portfolio companies, and the more
industry-speciﬁc knowledge they DEMO, the better their value-adding capabilities are
(Sapienza et al., 1996)DEMO Sapienza et al. have further shown that VC managers spend less
time with geographically distant ventures, although their perceived added value does not
decrease with distance. We hypothesize that VC ﬁrms with a broad sector or DEMO
scope rely more on syndicate partners to add value and monitor their investments ex post
than VC ﬁrms that invest in a narrow range DEMO opportunities.
Hypothesis 4c: The value-adding motive is less important for specialized DEMO ﬁrms
than for nonspecialized VC ﬁrms.
Research Setting and Method
Research Setting and Sample
In order to test our hypotheses, VC syndication practices are studied in six European
countries: Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.
Our sample thus includes countries in different parts of Europe where the VC industry is
long established and industry DEMO have matured. In the countries included in this
study, syndication is DEMO common in Belgium in terms of amounts invested through
syndicates (53.9%) (see Table 1). However, the highest proportions of syndicated deals
DEMO found in France and Sweden (both 39.9%). In Sweden, the amount syndicated (8.2%)
is remarkably lower than the number of deals syndicated (39.9%). Syndication practices
in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are low both in terms of amount invested as
well as the DEMO of deals, with there having been continual decreases in syndication
activity DEMO the 1990s (Lockett & Wright, 2001). Syndication activity in Germany
is in-between.

In order to understand why VC ﬁrms syndicate, a questionnaire was initially designed
and pretested with U.K. VC managers, advisors, and academics (Lockett & Wright, 2001).
Most studies to date use outcome-based methods (e.g., Brander et al., 2002; Bygrave,
DEMO, 1988; Lerner, 1994). A speciﬁc behavior of VC ﬁrms DEMO respect to syndication is
observed, and researchers speculate on the underlying DEMO that may lead to that
behavior. By using a questionnaire-based method, DEMO directly asked VC managers the
motives for syndicating their deals. We expect, therefore, to get a more profound and
subtle insight in some DEMO the reasons for syndication compared with outcome-based
studies. As the different theoretical perspectives on syndication were anticipated to be
multidimensional, it was deemed necessary to ask respondents a number of questions
relating to each of the DEMO Data on VC ﬁrm characteristics gathered from the
questionnaire—investment size, stage, and industry preferences—were further supple-
mented or cross-checked with data from industry DEMO (EVCA guide and directories
of the national VC associations).
The DEMO was administered by mail to the head ofﬁces of all 106 VC ﬁrms in
the United Kingdom, identiﬁed by using the British Venture Capital Association hand-
book and the Center for Management Buy-Out Research records, in 1998. The question-
naires were then translated into Dutch, French, German, and Swedish. In the other
countries covered in this study, questionnaires were sent out in the autumn of 2001.
Questionnaires were sent to the DEMO VC ﬁrms: 79, Belgian; 120, French; 191,
German; 169, Swedish; and 54, Dutch. These ﬁrms were identiﬁed as VC ﬁrms because
they were full members of the EVCA or because of DEMO national VC associations. In
order to be as complete as possible, DEMO nonmember ﬁrms that act as VC ﬁrms were
added to the sample. In all countries, follow-up was undertaken by sending reminders or
by calling the VC ﬁrms after 3–6 weeks. Responses were sought from individuals at DEMO
level of investment executives upwards. An early pilot study in the United Kingdom
(Lockett & Wright, 2001) showed that the issues examined here were generally driven by
138
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
organization-wide policies and hence, only a single respondent would be able to provide
the company-wide perspective.
Response rates were good, ranging from a low of 36% in Germany to a high of 59%
in the United DEMO The total sample consists of 317 usable responses (44% response
rate)DEMO More than 90% of the respondents had ever been involved in a syndicate. The
representativeness of the sample was tested for each country separately DEMO ﬁrm-speciﬁc
characteristics (minimum and maximum investment preferences and the number of DEMO
members) available from the national and European VC directories. In Belgium, France,
Germany, and the Netherlands, no signiﬁcant differences were found DEMO respondent
and nonrespondents. In Sweden and the United Kingdom, the respondents’ DEMO
investment preference is signiﬁcantly larger than that of nonrespondents. Together with
the high response rates, this indicates that the sample is representative for the VC industry
in the six countries included in the study.
Table 2 DEMO a description of the sample, after removing three outliers (one VC ﬁrm
with 3,000 portfolio companies and two VC ﬁrms without investment DEMO). A VC
ﬁrm employs, on average, 7.7 (median = DEMO) investment executives and has, on average,
36.4 (median = DEMO) investments in its current portfolio. Each investment executive thus
manages, on average, 5.7 (median = 3.5) portfolio companies. The minimum investment
preference is, on average, €2.91 million (median = €0.50 million), while the maximum
investment preference is, on average, €18.81 million (median = €5.00 million). The
average age of a VC ﬁrm in the DEMO is 10.4 years (median = 7 years).
Dependent Variables
In DEMO to test the importance of the motives of interest in this study, the respondents
were asked to indicate on 5-point Likert scales how important they ﬁnd different items in
their decision to syndicate deals (see Appendix). In order to test the selection motive, we
employed a single item, namely, “the need to seek the advice of other VC DEMO before
investing.” The results for the selection motive should therefore be interpreted with
caution. We included this item in the factor analysis in order DEMO control for whether it could
discriminate between the other motives. The rotated factor analysis revealed that the items
load on four factors: a ﬁnance motive, a deal ﬂow motive, a selection motive, and a value-
adding motive (see Appendix). The internal reliability of the scales is high for three out of
the four factors, with Cronbach’s alphas of 0.74 for the ﬁnance motive (three items), 0.82
for the deal ﬂow motive (two items), and 0.81 for the value-adding motive (DEMO items).1
The items for these factors were summed and the average was computed. The selection
motive did not load on any of these DEMO and was isolated through a fourth factor in the
analysis.
Methods and Independent Variables
Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to test the above DEMO Given that
early stage VC ﬁrms may be different from later stage VC ﬁrms, bivariate nonparametric
Mann–Whitney statistics were used to test the difference in importance of the four motives
for early stage and later stage DEMO We obtain comparable results with parametric
t-tests. We further ran multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and ordinal
1. In order to check DEMO consistency of the data across the countries, we recomputed the scales DEMO the different
countries separately. The scales are reliable in all countries.

regressions (for the ordinal selection motive), with the motives as dependent variables and
VC ﬁrm characteristics (cf. infra) as independent variables. The DEMO regressions
were run not only on the total sample, but also DEMO the subsample of early stage VC ﬁrms
on the one hand and of later stage VC ﬁrms on the other hand.
The subsamples of DEMO stage and later stage VC ﬁrms are constructed as follows.
Following Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh (2005), we computed the “average investment
stage” variable, reﬂecting the average stage in which a VC ﬁrm invests. We ﬁrst collected
data on the stages in which each VC ﬁrm invests: seed, start-up, expansion, and
replacement/buy-out investments. Each stage was given a value from 1 for seed invest-
ments to 4 for replacement DEMO buy-out investments. The average was calculated for each
VC ﬁrm by adding these numbers and dividing the total by the number of investment
stages DEMO which the VC ﬁrm invests (Mayer et al., 2005). For example, a VC ﬁrm that
invests in the startup and expansion stage will have an average of 2.5 = (2 + 3)/2. DEMO
sample was then split up between early stage and later stage investors using this average
stage variable. The distribution of the “average investment stage” DEMO is bimodal, with
maxima at 2.5 and 3.5 and a low DEMO 2.66. Therefore, we split the sample into a subsample
of early DEMO VC ﬁrms with an average investment stage of 2.5 or lower (DEMO = 128) and a
subsample of later stage VC ﬁrms with DEMO average investment stage of three or higher
(n = 146). DEMO excluded two ﬁrms with an average of 2.66.
The characteristics of the subsamples of early stage versus later stage investors are
presented in Table DEMO To indicate differences between the means of these two groups,
t-tests were used. Early stage investors have signiﬁcantly fewer investments in their
portfolio. DEMO early stage investors have, on average, 25.4 (median = 12) investments in
their portfolio, later stage investors have, on average, 49.0 (median = 20). The median
values for the minimum investment preference (€1 million versus €0.25 million) and the
maximum investment preference (€6.9 million versus €2.5 million) are, of course, higher
for later stage investors compared with early stage investors. The difference in mean for
minimum DEMO preference is marginally signiﬁcant, whereas the difference in mean
for maximum DEMO preference is highly signiﬁcant. In order to measure the spe-
cialization of the VC ﬁrms with respect to industry and geographic region, the respondents
were asked to indicate on a 5-point Likert scale how specialized their DEMO ﬁrm’s invest-
ment preference is in terms of industry sector and geographic region, with 1 = highly
unspecialized and 5 = highly specialized. The specialization in terms of geographic scope
is, on average, 3.46 on DEMO 5-point Likert scale, while the specialization in terms of industry
sector DEMO 3.14 on a 5-point Likert scale. Later stage investors are also signiﬁcantly less
specialized in speciﬁc industries and in geographic areas compared with early DEMO
investors. Moreover, early stage investors have a signiﬁcantly higher propensity to DEMO
dicate than later stage investors. Finally, early stage investors are, on average, signiﬁcantly
younger than later stage investors, with an average of DEMO years (median = 4 years), com-
pared with 13.6 years (median = 12 years).
Several VC ﬁrm characteristics were used in DEMO multivariate regressions. Table 3
gives the correlation between all variables. We have four proxies of VC ﬁrm size, either
self-reported or taken from industry directories: number of investment executives, number
of portfolio companies, and minimum and maximum investment preferences (see
Table 2). The correlation between all four size variables is high except between the
number of investments in DEMO portfolio and the minimum investment preference (see
Table 3). We DEMO, therefore, only one proxy for size in the multivariate analyses,
namely, “the maximum investment preference.” We also used industry and geographic
preferences in the multivariate analyses. Furthermore, we included the average stage
variable discussed earlier and the proportion of investments as nonlead. Finally, we

Results
The DEMO of the Four Different Motives
Table 4 shows the importance of the different motives relating to a VC ﬁrm’s decision
to syndicate a deal DEMO the sample as a whole and for the early and later stage VC ﬁrms
separately.2
The traditional ﬁnance motive for syndication is signiﬁcantly more DEMO than the
other motives tested in our questionnaire (mean = 3.99; see Table 4). This is the most
important motive overall, and for both early and later stage VC ﬁrms. If the size of DEMO deal
is large compared with the size of the fund, or DEMO additional rounds of ﬁnancing are
expected, then VC ﬁrms are more DEMO to syndicate their deals.
Our data show that the deal ﬂow motive (mean = 2.73) is signiﬁcantly less important
than the ﬁnance motive (mean = 3.99) for European VC ﬁrms, but is signiﬁcantly more
DEMO than the value-adding motive (mean = 2.50) and the selection motive (mean =
2.36) for the total sample (Table 4). The deal selection motive is a signiﬁcantly less
important motive to syndicate than DEMO ﬁnance motive, but is not signiﬁcantly different
from the value-adding motive.
DEMO Finance Motive
An examination of the results of the multivariate analyses indicates that, and in
contrast to hypothesis 1a, the ﬁnance motive is DEMO more important for early stage VC
ﬁrms than for later stage VC ﬁrms. The coefﬁcient in the OLS regression for the total
sample is DEMO signiﬁcant (see Table 5), and the Mann–Whitney test reports no DEMO
difference between the sample of early and later stage investors (see DEMO 4). The ﬁnance
motive is the most important motive for syndication (among those tested in this study) for
all VC ﬁrms, both early stage and later stage: the difference between the ﬁnance and all
the other motives is highly signiﬁcant for the total sample and for DEMO subsamples.
Hypothesis 1a is therefore not supported.
The coefﬁcient of the size variable is signiﬁcantly negative. Consistent with hypoth-
esis 1b, the ﬁnance motive is more important for small VC ﬁrms than for large VC ﬁrms
DEMO the total sample regression. The regressions for the two subsamples of early and later
stage investors are not signiﬁcant.
The Deal Flow Motive
Table DEMO suggests that the deal ﬂow motive is signiﬁcantly more important for later
stage VC ﬁrms than for early stage VC ﬁrms. While the deal DEMO motive is signiﬁcantly
more important than the selection and value-adding motives for later stage VC
2. Similar analyses were run in each country separately. DEMO importance of the motives to syndicate a deal is
consistent across all countries, highlighting the fact that VC practices are very similar in different European
countries. This ﬁnding strengthens the validity of our approach to pool DEMO from the different
countries into one sample for further analyses.

ﬁrms, there is no difference between the importance of these motives for early stage VC
ﬁrms. The multivariate regressions for the deal ﬂow motive DEMO the total sample and in
the sample of later stage investors are not signiﬁcant (see Table 5). The regressions for
the sample of early stage investors are, however, signiﬁcant. The coefﬁcient for the size
DEMO is signiﬁcant and has the expected sign. Hypothesis 2a is therefore supported in
the sample of early stage investors: the deal ﬂow motive is more important for larger
VC ﬁrms. The coefﬁcient of industry specialization is DEMO signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 2b
that states that the deal ﬂow motive is less important for specialized VC ﬁrms is there-
fore not supported.
The Selection DEMO
Hypothesis 3a, which states that early stage VC ﬁrms syndicate more DEMO later stage
VC ﬁrms for deal selection purposes, is supported in DEMO bivariate analyses (see Table 4)
but not in the multivariate DEMO (see Table 5). The coefﬁcient of the average stage
variable DEMO, however, the expected sign and a p-value of 0.129. The evidence is thus
mixed. The bivariate analyses further suggest that the value-adding motive DEMO marginally
more important than the selection motive for later stage VC ﬁrms, but not for early stage
VC ﬁrms. Deal ﬂow, selection, and value adding are equally important motives for
syndication for the latter. In DEMO multivariate analyses, the coefﬁcient for the percentage of
deals done as DEMO investor has the expected sign and is signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 3b is
therefore supported for the total sample of VC ﬁrms. Hypothesis 3b is further DEMO
for the subsamples of early and later stage investors. However, for DEMO stage investors, the
regression is only marginally signiﬁcant. The ﬁnding that DEMO investors rely on the
selection skills of lead investors is thus mainly driven by the behavior of early stage
investors. In the subsample of DEMO stage investors, industry specialization has the
expected sign and is signiﬁcant. DEMO geographic specialization variable is not signiﬁcant,
however. Hypothesis 3c is therefore partially supported for early stage VC ﬁrms: the deal
selection motive is signiﬁcantly less important for VC ﬁrms that are specialized in a
speciﬁc DEMO
The Value-adding Motive
The bivariate analyses indicate that the value-adding motive is signiﬁcantly more
important for early stage VC ﬁrms compared with later stage DEMO ﬁrms (see Table 4). This
is also conﬁrmed in the DEMO analyses for the total sample: the coefﬁcient for the
average stage DEMO is signiﬁcant and negative (see Table 5). However, the regression
model for the total sample is only marginally signiﬁcant. Thus, there is limited support for
hypothesis 4a. The coefﬁcient for the percentage of investments DEMO as a nonlead
investor is positive and signiﬁcant for the total sample. Hypothesis 4b is hence supported
for the total sample; the more a VC ﬁrm invests as a nonlead investor, the more important
the value-adding motive will be. This is also supported within the sample of early DEMO later
stage VC ﬁrms. The coefﬁcient is only marginally signiﬁcant, however. DEMO value-adding
motive is also more important for larger early stage investors, DEMO is less important for
larger later stage investors. Again, we should DEMO that both the regression model for later
stage and the coefﬁcient for the size proxy are only marginally signiﬁcant. Our coefﬁ-
cients for industry DEMO geographic specialization are not signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 4c is
therefore not supported.

Conclusions and Discussion
Motives for Syndication
The study highlights a number of DEMO ﬁndings. First, we show that overall VC
portfolio management strategy is DEMO major driver of syndication. This driver may have been
underestimated in previous studies on syndication behavior. Among the motives consid-
ered here, the motives for syndicating a deal are driven much more by ﬁnance consider-
ations DEMO, more broadly, by portfolio management considerations, than by the wish DEMO
exchange ﬁrm-speciﬁc resources for selecting and managing speciﬁc deals. European VC
managers mainly consider syndication as a means to improve the management of their
DEMO portfolio. The main purpose of syndication is to increase portfolio diversiﬁcation,
to allow VC ﬁrms to invest in deals that otherwise would be DEMO large, and to improve
access to future deal ﬂow. Syndication as DEMO means to improve preinvestment selection of
individual deals and to enhance postinvestment monitoring and value adding in speciﬁc
deals is much less important than DEMO studies suggest.
Our results contrast with those of the majority of studies on syndication in that we ﬁnd
much greater support for ﬁnancial motives DEMO much less support for deal-speciﬁc
motives. Although some studies, e.g., Bygrave and Timmons (1992), and Zacharakis
(2002), acknowledge that ﬁnancial DEMO are important drivers of syndication,
the majority of ﬁndings suggests the importance of better decision making (selection) or
value adding as motives DEMO driving syndication. Lerner (1994) shows that syndication is
a way to better assess the information provided by potential portfolio companies. Syndi-
cation thus DEMO to better deal selection. More recently, Brander et al. (2002) DEMO that
syndication leads to higher performance in the portfolio company. They therefore con-
clude that syndication partners add value beyond those of the lead DEMO In the same
vein, Jääskeläinen et al. (2002) show that DEMO executives are able to efﬁciently manage a
larger number of portfolio companies if they syndicate, thanks to additional resources
brought in by syndication partners.
Is this an evidence of different syndication behaviors of European and American DEMO
investors? It might well be that European VC managers underestimate the DEMO that
syndication may play in accessing information, knowledge, value-adding skills, DEMO deal
ﬂow. Our preliminary interviews did not reveal this, though. Rather, the VC managers
interviewed expressed the view that they were unlikely to DEMO in a deal if they did not
have conﬁdence in their own knowledge/abilities with respect to a particular deal and its
sector. Another DEMO for the striking differences between our results and previous
studies may be that most studies on syndication have taken the individual deal as a DEMO of
analysis, while this study focuses on the syndication policy of DEMO VC ﬁrm. When analyzing
why a particular deal is syndicated or not, it is likely that portfolio perspectives (ﬁnance
and deal ﬂow motives) are less prominent than deal perspectives (selection and value-
adding motives).
VC Firm Characteristics That Inﬂuence the Motives for Syndication
The ﬁnance motive DEMO the most important motive for syndication for both early and
later stage VC ﬁrms. This is an interesting ﬁnding given the emphasis in earlier DEMO
on early stage ventures. While the deal ﬂow, selection, and value-adding motives are
equally important for early stage VC ﬁrms, there is a clear hierarchy of motives for later
stage VC ﬁrms. For later stage DEMO ﬁrms, the ﬁnance motive is followed by the deal
ﬂow motive, which in turn is signiﬁcantly more important than the value-adding motive,
DEMO, 2006
147
but the latter motive is signiﬁcantly more important than the selection motive. DEMO
adding is not an important motive for any VC ﬁrm. Nevertheless, DEMO is more important
for early than for later stage investors. Access to speciﬁc skills from syndicate partners
in order to improve the management of DEMO individual investment is thus more important
for early stage investors than for later stage investors. This is not surprising, as
value adding is, DEMO general, more important for early stage investors (Sapienza et al.,
1996).
The size of a VC ﬁrm has an impact on DEMO reasons to syndicate. We ﬁnd that
the ﬁnance motive is less important for larger later stage VC ﬁrms. Larger VC ﬁrms are
less restricted DEMO their fund size in their investment policy. They are able to diversify
their portfolio by investing in a larger number of deals, to invest in large deals, and to
provide follow-on ﬁnance when needed. This explains why larger later stage VC ﬁrms
syndicate less for ﬁnancial reasons. Syndication DEMO, however, a strategy for small VC
ﬁrms to overcome their liability of smallness. We think that this may also partly
explain the difference DEMO found between syndication motives in the present and
earlier studies. It may be that the European VC ﬁrms in our sample are, on average,
smaller than those in previous, mostly U.S.-based, studies, and that their smallness
explains why ﬁnancial motives are more important for them. An DEMO ﬁnding is
the fact that large early stage VC ﬁrms put a higher emphasis on the value-adding
motive compared with smaller early stage investors, everything else equal. We may
expect that larger early stage investors have DEMO in-house knowledge and resources.
This calls for further research on the relation between syndication strategies and VC
ﬁrm size.
The deal ﬂow motive is, on the other hand, more important for larger early stage VC
ﬁrms than for smaller early stage VC ﬁrms. Larger VC ﬁrms need to DEMO in more deals
and therefore need to have access to a larger deal ﬂow, everything else equal.3 Finally, it
is rather surprising that DEMO selection and value-adding motives are more important for
larger early stage VC ﬁrms than for smaller early stage VC ﬁrms, controlling for the
number of investments per investment executive. One may expect that larger VC ﬁrms
DEMO more resources and knowledge in-house, all other things being equal, and therefore
have a lower need to rely upon selection and value-adding skills DEMO outside partners. This
intriguing ﬁnding calls for more research.
Neither the industry nor the geographic specialization of a VC ﬁrm has an inﬂuence
on DEMO importance of any of the motives to syndicate except for the selection motive.
Nonspecialized early stage VC ﬁrms syndicate more for deal selection purposes DEMO
specialized early stage VC ﬁrms, but not for value-adding purposes. Our DEMO of more
signiﬁcant ﬁndings should be treated with caution, however, as we rely upon a crude
measure of VC ﬁrm specialization. Research that DEMO a more reﬁned measure of VC
specialization may yield stronger conclusions.
Finally, the more a VC ﬁrm syndicates as a nonlead investor, the DEMO important
access to speciﬁc deal management skills from syndicate partners will be. The selection
and value-adding motives are signiﬁcantly more important when a VC DEMO acts more as
a nonlead investor. In that situation, VC ﬁrms DEMO on their syndicate partners for prein-
vestment selection and for postinvestment monitoring and value adding. Clearly, lead and
nonlead investors syndicate for different reasons.
3. The correlations suggest that larger VC ﬁrms, with a higher maximum investment preference, also have
more companies in their portfolio.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Implications for Practitioners
This study has implications for both researchers and practitioners. DEMO stress the fact
that our results show very similar syndication practices across different European coun-
tries. This indicates a high degree of institutionalization of DEMO accepted way of working
throughout the European VC industry. This contrasts with ﬁndings in earlier studies on the
European VC industry, which found important differences in the way VC ﬁrms work in
different European countries (Manigart et al., 2002; Sapienza et al., 1996). Despite the
difference between the market-driven ﬁnancial system in the United Kingdom on the one
DEMO and the more bank-driven ﬁnancial system (Black & Gilson, 1998) DEMO the other
Continental European countries covered in this study on the other, and notwithstanding
the different degrees of maturity of the VC markets in the different countries in our study,
our results are remarkably consistent DEMO countries. VC practices have clearly spread
across Europe without taking national boundaries into consideration. The VC industry
appears to be evolving toward a uniform DEMO industry, with comparable
methods of working. It is likely that syndication DEMO have helped to spread common
norms and behavior (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001).
We would urge VC managers to formulate explicit strategies with DEMO to syndi-
cation. It seems that VC managers are well aware of the ﬁnancial beneﬁts that syndication
may yield, but they seem to underestimate the importance of additional beneﬁts, such as
obtaining access to additional information and skills, building strong and trustworthy
networks, and increasing deal ﬂow. DEMO are, however, not blind to the fact that more
partners in a syndicate also means more complex managerial issues after the investment
has DEMO made and more dilution of ownership (Wright & Lockett, 2003). More research
is needed to assess where the optimal trade-off point lies.
DEMO for Future Research
Research on syndication in the VC industry has only recently started to receive
attention, although studying syndication behavior in this setting is relevant beyond the VC
community. A syndication involves a partnership between DEMO investors, but unlike tra-
ditional alliances, there is an important third—independent—party, namely, the portfolio
company. This increases the complexity of the situation, as there are potential agency
problems between the portfolio company and the DEMO investor on the one hand, and
between the lead and the DEMO investor on the other hand. We call for more research on
the different positions of lead and nonlead investors. Little is known about how DEMO and
nonlead investors behave differently (though see Wright & Lockett, 2003). The deal
selection process of nonlead investors may be different from DEMO of lead investors. The
characteristics of the portfolio company and those of the lead investor may affect the
decision of the nonlead to join DEMO syndicate. After the deal is done, the monitoring and
value-adding behavior DEMO likely to be affected by the lead or nonlead position of an
investor. Finally, VC ﬁrms that have a strategy to invest predominantly as lead investors
may have different portfolio strategies from those that predominantly invest DEMO nonleads.
More research is needed in this area, e.g., on the impact of agency risks, of transaction
costs, and of trust on DEMO initiation and subsequent management of a syndicate
arrangement.
Further research may also usefully consider the effects of different rounds of invest-
ment on the DEMO decision. Our research, along with most other research on
syndication, has not taken the effect of different rounds of investment into account. For

issue may become less important, while value adding and risk diversiﬁcation may become
more important. This may have implications for the type of VC DEMO that it seeks at each
stage. Further, the performance of the DEMO at the time a new investment round is
planned may also have an impact on the type of syndicates that will be formed.
Finally, there is more work to be done on the relation between syndication DEMO
and performance, both on the level of the portfolio companies and DEMO the level of a VC
ﬁrm. As stated, the trade-off between DEMO beneﬁts of syndication and the costs associated
with managing more complex situations is not well understood yet. We need to know more
on the DEMO of syndicates. All this will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding
of the fundamental trade-off each VC ﬁrm has to make between running the DEMO ﬁrm as
either a traditional hands-off ﬁnancial intermediary on the one hand, where ﬁnancial
risk-return considerations are the most important management criteria, or DEMO it as a
hands-on value-added investor.
We conclude by calling for more studies that explicitly take into account the differ-
ence in institutional environments DEMO the behavior of VC ﬁrms. There is a need to model
and to test more speciﬁcally the effect of institutional environments on syndication
behavior. DEMO research on syndication practices may be especially important as
evidence from Venture Economics indicates that over 60% of VC investments in the
United States DEMO 2000 were syndicated. This ﬁgure compares with EVCA data of 13% in
the United Kingdom and 30% across Europe as a whole.4 Similarly, extending the analysis
to compare VC syndication practices between Europe, the United States, and Asia is an
interesting avenue for further research. Asian VC markets are developing rapidly (Lockett
& Wright, 2002), and previous research DEMO shown that there are important differences
between U.S., European, and Asian VC industry practices (Black & Gilson, 1998; Jeng &
Wells, 2000). For example, the VC market in the United States is more dominated by
earlier stage investments than is the case in Europe, while late stage investment is more
important in Asia. Investigating similarities and DEMO differences in syndication
motives and propensity may yield interesting insights.

on pure early stage VC, DEMO European ﬁgures include both early and later stage VC or private equity. As we
have shown, early and later stage investors have different syndication strategies.
