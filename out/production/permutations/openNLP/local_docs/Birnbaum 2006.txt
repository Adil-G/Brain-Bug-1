Evaluation of the Priority Heuristic as a Descriptive Model of Risky
Decision Making: Comment on Brandsta¨tter, Gigerenzer,
and Hertwig (2006)
Michael H. Birnbaum
DEMO State University, Fullerton
E. Brandsta¨tter, G. Gigerenzer, and R. Hertwig (2006) contended that their priority heuristic, a type of
lexicographic semiorder DEMO, is more accurate than cumulative prospect theory (CPT) or transfer DEMO
attention exchange (TAX) models in describing risky decisions. However, there DEMO 4 problems with their
argument. First, their heuristic is not descriptive DEMO certain data that they did not review. Second, their
analysis relied DEMO a global index of fit, percentage of correct predictions of the DEMO choice. Such
analyses can lead to wrong conclusions when parameters are not properly estimated from the data. When
parameters are estimated from the data, CPT and TAX fit the D. Kahneman and A. Tversky (1979) DEMO
perfectly. Reanalysis shows that TAX and CPT do as well as the priority heuristic for 2 of the data sets
reviewed and outperform the DEMO heuristic for the other 3. Third, when 2 of these sets DEMO data are
reexamined, the priority heuristic is seen to make systematic DEMO Fourth, new critical implications
have been devised for testing the family DEMO lexicographic semiorders including the priority heuristic; new
results with these critical DEMO show systematic evidence against lexicographic semiorder models.
Keywords: choice, descriptive models, heuristics, risky decision making, utility
Brandsta¨tter, Gigerenzer and Hertwig (2006) presented the pri-
ority heuristic as a descriptive model of risky decision making.
This model is a variant of a lexicographic semiorder, such as that
applied by Tversky (1969) and others. They consider such models
DEMO and frugal” because choices can be made, in some cases,
DEMO examining all of the information. They reanalyzed some
published data and concluded that their model fits those data better
than parametric models such as DEMO and Kahneman’s (1992)
cumulative prospect theory (CPT) and Birnbaum’s (1997, 1999b,
2004a; Birnbaum & Chavez, 1997; Birnbaum & DEMO, 1998)
transfer of attention exchange (TAX) model.
What can DEMO make of this supposedly “good” fit of the priority
heuristic to previous data? My contention is that Brandstatter et al.
(2006) were somewhat selective in the data they described and that
their procedures for data DEMO are questionable. Examination of
other data and reanalysis of the data they reviewed cast doubt on
the descriptive accuracy of their model. Their approach DEMO stating
that the model is not applicable in cases in which it fails is also
problematic. As it turns out, the conditions they list to exclude tests
can be seen as reducing the domain of their DEMO to a very small
region, and even within that restricted region, the data depart

significantly from predictions of their model. New tests DEMO been
devised to test implications of the family of lexicographic semi-
orders, and these new data violate the model’s implications.
Selective Data Review
Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) conceded that their priority heuristic
does not account DEMO the dissection of the Allais paradox (Birn-
baum, 2004a), but they did not describe a number of other choices
in which the DEMO heuristic also fails to predict the results. For
the 13 cases in Tables 2, 3, and 4 of Birnbaum (2004a), in which
the choice percentage was significantly different from 50%, the
priority heuristic correctly predicted the modal choice in only three
cases. In four cases, it made erroneous predictions, and in six cases
it made no prediction. The TAX model (with parameters estimated
from previous data) correctly predicted the DEMO choice in all 13
cases.
Although Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) cited Birnbaum and
Navarrete (1998), they did not mention that their model correctly
predicted the modal choice in only 49 of 112 choices reported DEMO
Birnbaum and Navarrete, whereas the TAX model with prior
parameters correctly DEMO 89 of those choices. For example,
most participants in Birnbaum and Navarrete should have chosen
the “risky” gamble, R  ($98, 0.1; $10, 0.1; $3, 0.8) in preference
to (  ) the “safe” gamble, S  ($52, 0.1; $48, 0.1; DEMO, 0.8),
according to the priority heuristic, because lowest consequences
DEMO probabilities are the same, so people should have chosen R,
DEMO the higher best consequence. And most people should have
chosen S (DEMO, 0.8; $52, 0.1; $48, 0.1)  R ($107, 0.8;
$98, 0.1; $10, 0.1) because S has the DEMO lowest consequence.
Instead, significantly more participants in that study had the DEMO

posite combination of preferences (30) than showed the pattern
DEMO with this heuristic (8), z  3.57.
Similarly, only 31% of 100 participants in Birnbaum and Na-
varrete’s (1998) study chose DEMO  ($97, 0.1; $11, 0.1; $2, 0.8) over
DEMO  ($56, 0.1; $52, 0.1; $2, 0.8), even though the highest
consequence of R1 is more than $10 greater than DEMO of S1.
Furthermore, 73% chose R2 ($110, 0.5; $96, DEMO; $12, 0.25)
over S2 ($110, 0.5; $34, 0.25; $30, 0.25), despite the fact that
the lowest consequence of DEMO is more than $10 greater than that of
R2. This pattern of significant, incorrect prediction occurred in
many other cases in Birnbaum and Navarrete (1998), as well as in
earlier publications (Birnbaum & Chavez, 1997; Birnbaum &
McIntosh, 1996).
Stochastic Dominance
The priority heuristic fails to predict satisfactions of stochastic
dominance in cases where most people DEMO this property. For
example, Birnbaum (1999b) reported that 92% chose DEMO  ($100,
0.2; $96, 0.3; $4, 0.5) over I  ($100, 0.2; $12, 0.3; $4, 0.5), DEMO
though the priority heuristic cannot resolve this choice. Similarly,
the priority heuristic cannot decide that D  ($100, 0.90; $30,
0.10)  C  ($100, 0.82; $22, 0.18). The lowest consequences
differ by only $8, so people would next examine probabilities,
which differ by only 0.08, so they would look at the highest
consequences, which are the same, and so be unable to decide.
DEMO priority heuristic also fails to predict violations of stochastic
dominance in cases in which most undergraduates violate it (Birn-
baum, 1999b, 2005a; DEMO & Navarrete, 1998). In a new
variation, 71% of 408 undergraduates tested for this comment
chose F  ($89, 0.7; $88, 0.1; $11, 0.2) over G  ($90, 0.8; $13,
0.1; $12, 0.1), despite the fact that G stochastically DEMO F.In
this example, G has a higher lowest outcome, higher best outcome,
lower probability to get the worst consequence, higher probability
to get the best consequence, and a higher expected value (EV). DEMO
should be chosen by the priority heuristic because of its lower
probability to receive the lowest outcome. The only way in which
F is DEMO than G is in the consequences on the middle branch,
which the priority heuristic ignores. Birnbaum (2005a) found that
participants indeed respond DEMO to manipulation of the
middle consequence. To avoid such wrong predictions, DEMO
ter et al. (2006) stated that their heuristic does not apply to choices
with a stochastic dominance relation.
Excluding cases of dominance creates DEMO problems for priority
heuristic as a descriptive theory. (a) It creates a theoretical prob-
lem. How do people perceive dominance? To decide not to use the
priority heuristic, people must be able to perceive dominance, and
to do this, they must examine all of the information DEMO both
gambles, so adding this preliminary decision stage contradicts the
goal DEMO being “fast and frugal.” (b) If people can detect dominance,
then why not obey it? (c) It is all too easy to say that a theory is
perfect, except where it does not apply—and then add to the list of
exceptions. (d) This restriction DEMO the domain of the theory cuts
down the applicability of the priority heuristic considerably.
Consider two-branch gambles of the form A  (x, DEMO; y,1  p),
where $100  x, y DEMO 0. Suppose we sample by the following
procedure: Choose x and DEMO by randomly drawing from a uniform
distribution from $0 to $100. Choose p by randomly sampling
from a uniform distribution on the interval from DEMO to 1. Now
choose pairs of such “random” gambles independently. In this
domain, one half of all potential choices are excluded by the
boundary condition excluding dominance. Half the space seems a
large region to exclude. DEMO consider choices between cash, c,
and such binary gambles, where c is uniformly distributed on the
same interval: In this situation, DEMO dominance excludes two
thirds of the potential choices!
New Paradoxes
Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) conceded that their heuristic does not
predict Birnbaum’s “new DEMO,” which involve two- and
three-branch gambles. Those paradoxes were designed to refute
CPT without having to assume or estimate any parameters. Like
CPT, the priority heuristic does not correctly describe violations of
upper and lower DEMO independence (Birnbaum, 1999b,
2004b; Birnbaum & Navarrete, 1998). Of the 12 choices analyzed
by Birnbaum (1999b, Table 1) to compare CPT and TAX, the
priority heuristic is correct in only 4 of 12 choices: It makes no
prediction in four cases, and DEMO makes wrong predictions in four
other cases. In 17 choices analyzed by Birnbaum (1999a), the
priority heuristic correctly predicts the modal choice in only five
cases, it is wrong in eight cases, and it DEMO no prediction in four
cases. Birnbaum (1999a) showed that one can reproduce those 17
choices with the TAX model using the approximation, u(x)  x;
but this does not mean that only this utility function works.
The priority heuristic cannot account for systematic violations
of DEMO independence (Birnbaum, 2005b; Birnbaum &
Chavez, 1997). In DEMO, there is a considerable body of previously
published evidence showing that DEMO heuristic is not an accurate
descriptive model, but these data were DEMO included by Brandsta¨tter
et al. (2006) in their contests of fit. Including these data leads one
to the conclusion that the priority heuristic DEMO not an accurate
descriptive model. If we theorize that people use a preliminary
decision process to decide not to use the priority heuristic for DEMO
cases, we need to devise a mechanism that can detect these DEMO
for exclusion.
Data Analysis
The analysis of the data of Tversky and Kahneman (1992) in
Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) was not diagnostic. DEMO and Kahne-
man studied choices between sure cash, c, and binary gambles of
the form, (x, p; y), where x DEMO y. The data were published in the
form of certainty equivalents (DEMO), which are values of c such that
people preferred the cash or the gamble 50% of the time. Brand-
sta¨tter et al. (2006) analyzed those data by asking how often each
model correctly predicted the relationship between the CE and the
EV. By this criterion, CPT, DEMO, and the priority heuristic all
seem to do well, but this criterion is not diagnostic of differences
among the models.
If, instead of comparing CE with EV, we use 60% of the EV, we
DEMO better distinguish the models. According to CPT and TAX,
with their prior parameters, people should choose the gamble over
0.6 EV when x  y  0 for all p  0.2. According to the DEMO
heuristic, however, people should choose the sure cash when it
exceeds the rounded value of 10% of the largest consequence—
that is, when p  0.2 and c  0.6 EV. (The reason to use 60% of
EV is to allow the models to make different predictions DEMO also to

255
ensure that choices are inside the region estimated by Brandsta¨tter
DEMO al., 2006, where the priority heuristic is supposed to apply; DEMO,
0.5  EV/c  2.)
In Table 3 of Tversky and Kahneman (1992), there are 20
“choices” between c and (x, p; y) that fit these diagnostic criteria
(i.e., DEMO  0.2 and c  0.6 EV). For example, according DEMO the
priority heuristic, people should prefer $30 over ($100, 0.5; $0)
because $30 exceeds 10% of $100. However, CPT and TAX, with
their prior parameters, imply that people should prefer the gamble.
DEMO and Kahneman found that most people chose the gamble
over $30, DEMO in a CE of $36 in this case. Of these 20
diagnostic choices, both TAX and CPT are correct in 100% of the
cases, and the priority heuristic is correct in 0% of the cases.
Similar results are observed with strictly nonpositive conse-
quences. These conclusions are quite DEMO from those reached
by Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006), who argued DEMO the priority heuristic
accurately predicts these data; instead, reanalysis shows that we
can reject the priority heuristic as a description of Tversky and
DEMO data in favor of TAX or CPT.
Rieger and Wang (in DEMO) used an index of fit to show that
CPT fits the DEMO and Kahneman (1992) data better than does
the priority heuristic. Because TAX makes predictions that are
virtually the same as those of CPT DEMO that experiment, TAX will
also fit those data better than the DEMO heuristic by that same
index of fit.
Parameter Estimation
The contests of fit in Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) did not allow
parameter estimation DEMO models that use parameters. For example,
Figure 1 in Brandsta¨tter et al. displays a comparison of the accu-
racy of models to 14 DEMO from Kahneman and Tversky (1979).
According to the figure, the priority heuristic predicts the modal
decision in 100% of the 14 choices, whereas TAX and CPT are
supposedly correct in only 70% of the DEMO cases. However, TAX
predicts those choices perfectly if it is allowed DEMO nonlinear utility
function, u(x)  x, where ˆ  DEMO, and the other parameters are
the same as those used by DEMO et al. CPT can also fit those
data perfectly, if it DEMO allowed to estimate its parameters from those
data.
Parametric models do not assume that every person has the same
parameters nor do they assume DEMO every experiment will induce
the same parameters. Indeed, there are significant DEMO in
choice behavior between men and women, between the highly
educated DEMO the less educated, and between individuals in the
same homogeneous group (Birnbaum, 1999b, 2006). Brandsta¨tter
et al. (2006) agreed that DEMO model cannot account for such results
unless it employs free parameters.
In the TAX model, the approximation, u(x)  x, provided DEMO
reasonable approximation to group data of American undergradu-
ates in experiments involving small variation of positive cash
prizes less than $150. Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) assumed that this
approximation should also be appropriate for choices involving
prizes ranging up to 2 months’ salary for Israelis (Kahneman &
DEMO, 1979). Although the linear approximation has been useful
for simplifying DEMO exposition of the TAX model (e.g., Birnbaum,
1999a), this approximation is not part of the model (Birnbaum,
1999a, p. DEMO), and it is not optimal.
When Birnbaum and Navarrete (1998) fit the TAX model with
u(x)  x, with prizes DEMO than $150, the best fit to averaged data
led to ˆ DEMO 0.73. When TAX was fit to individuals, the median
best-fit value DEMO 0.41. Birnbaum and Chavez (1997) reported the
median best fit value was  0.61. Therefore, the approximation,
u(x)  x, is not an optimal fit even for the majority of undergrad-
uates DEMO Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) cited these two articles, but
they DEMO not use best-fit parameters from those articles; instead,
they assumed DEMO  1 in the TAX model. Because the Kahne-
man and Tversky (1979) data can be fit perfectly by TAX and
CPT, as well as by the priority heuristic, those data are simply not
diagnostic for comparing these theories.
The Lopes and Oden (1999) data with DEMO branch gambles can
be fit by TAX with ˆ  0.41 and with the other parameters fixed
to the values used by Brandsta¨tter et DEMO (2006). In this case, TAX
correctly predicts 87% of the choices, the same as for CPT and the
priority heuristic. So these data also provide no reason to prefer
one of these models over DEMO others.
Erev, Roth, Slonim, and Barron (2002) studied choices DEMO
binary gambles of the form (x, p; 0). Figure DEMO of Brandsta¨tter et al.
(2006) shows that the priority heuristic is more accurate than TAX

is correct in all but 1 of the 100 choices. Brandsta¨tter DEMO al. noted
that CPT also fits these data with only one error when its param-
eters are estimated from the data.
For comparison, the priority heuristic with two free parameters
(priority order and threshold parameter) DEMO fit to the same data.
Assuming probability has priority over the highest consequence
(see circles connected by broken lines in Figure 1), the best-fit
value of the probability threshold is 0.05, in which case the model
is wrong in 14% of the choices. Assuming that highest conse-
DEMO has priority (see dashed curve in Figure 1), this version DEMO
the heuristic achieves a best-fit value of 14% errors, with a
DEMO  0.86 max(x, x). If one should conclude anything DEMO
these data, it is that the best-fitting TAX and CPT models DEMO more
accurate than the best-fitting priority heuristic model.
Mellers, Chang, Birnbaum, and Ordo´n˜ez (1992) also studied
choices between binary gambles of the form (x, p; 0) constructed
from a 6  6 DEMO design of x and p. The choice proportions
can be approximated with a strongly transitive utility model with
logistic function
P(A, B) DEMO 1/{1  exp( [u(A)  u(B)])},
where u(A) and u(B) are the utilities of DEMO and is the
logistic spread parameter. The least squares solution predicted the
modal choice in 421 out of 450 choices (6.4% errors). When the
above model was further constrained so that the gamble utilities—
u(DEMO) and u(B)—satisfied the TAX model with one free parameter
(), the model correctly reproduced 407 out of 450 choices (9.5%
errors), with ˆ  0.48, and with the other parameters fixed to their
prior values. Figure 2 shows the percentage of wrong predictions
DEMO the same three models, as in Figure 1.
The priority heuristic (with its parameter of 0.1) correctly pre-
dicted only 327 of the same 450 choices (27% errors), and its
errors were highly systematic. For example, the priority heuristic
implies that most people should choose S  (x, 0.29; 0) over R 
(x, 0.17; 0) for any values of x and x 0; this prediction DEMO wrong
for all 30 of these choices in Mellers et al. (DEMO). In addition, the
priority heuristic implies violations of weak stochastic DEMO
that did not materialize in the data. For example, 82% chose DEMO 
($17.5, 0.05; $0) over B  ($5.4, 0.09; $0) and 55% chose B over
C  ($3, 0.17; $0), but 76% chose A over C, even though the
priority heuristic predicts that the majority of participants should
have chosen C over DEMO The EVs of A, B, and C are 0.85, 0.49, and
0.51, respectively, well inside the region in which the heuristic DEMO
supposed to work. The best-fit priority heuristic had its probability
threshold  0.23, in which case it made 19% errors.
Brandsta¨tter et al. (DEMO) noted that their model was not accurate
when EVs differed by DEMO ratio greater than two. Excluding these
cases, the priority heuristic makes DEMO for only 266 of the
450 choices in Mellers et al (DEMO). Among these 266 cases, the
priority heuristic had 21% wrong DEMO, and it was still
wrong in predicting all 18 of the DEMO remaining choices between
S  (x, 0.29; 0) and R  (x, 0.17; 0). When the best-fit two-
parameter priority heuristic was fit inside the EV-restricted region,
the best-fit probability threshold DEMO 0.18, with 17% errors. These
data therefore fail to show any DEMO for the priority heuristic
over TAX because the best-fit TAX model gives a better fit to all
of the data (9.5% errors for 450 predictions) than does the best-
fitting priority heuristic in the selected data (17% errors for 266

DEMO). Similar results were observed in an analysis of the
strictly nonpositive gambles of Mellers et al.
In sum, reanalysis shows that TAX and CPT perform as well or
better than the priority heuristic for all DEMO sets of data analyzed by
Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) if TAX is allowed to use  1 instead
of  1 and CPT DEMO allowed to estimate its parameters from the
data. In two of the data sets, the fit is the same for TAX, CPT, and
the priority heuristic; in two cases, the priority heuristic makes
systematic DEMO and can be rejected in favor of TAX or CPT. In
the fifth case (Erev et al., 2002), TAX and CPT fit DEMO than the
best-fitting priority heuristic.
To show that a model is compatible with a set of data, it suffices
to find a set of parameters that allow that model to reproduce those
data. However, to disprove a model, one must show that there are
no parameters in that model that allow it to fit the data. The
standard Allais paradoxes DEMO just that: When one attempts to
define a utility scale from DEMO paradoxical choices, expected utility
theory leads to a contradiction. Brandsta¨tter et DEMO (2006) argued,
instead, that one should be able to DEMO a model by showing that
parameters that worked in one experiment are not optimal in
another experiment with new participants in a new context.
DEMO et al. (2006) conceded that all models have param-
eters, DEMO they said that their parameter, 1/10, for the probability
threshold and aspiration level was “derived” from our cultural
base-10 number system. For DEMO data of Mellers et al. (1992), the
best-fit parameter for DEMO heuristic was about 1/5, which could be
“derived” by counting DEMO and thumb of the right hand. For
data of Erev et al. (2002), the best-fit value is close to 1/20, which

could be “derived” by counting on all fingers and toes. DEMO,
the value 1/2 could be “derived” from the number of eyes in a
head, 1/3 from the Holy Trinity, 1/DEMO from the directions on a
compass, 1/7 from the number DEMO days in a week, 1/8 by counting
fingers but not DEMO, 1/12 from the number of hours on the face
of DEMO clock, 1/24 from the number of hours in a day, and so on.
Unless one plans to randomly assign people to different DEMO in
which these cultural constants are manipulated (e.g., changing the
cultural number system), postulating which of these cultural values
is “the” cause DEMO a parameter value strikes me as idle speculation.
Global Index of Fit
A global index of fit is simply not a good tool for DEMO
rival models. “High” indices of fit often coexist with serious,
systematic discrepancies for a model. It has been shown that
correlation coefficients between DEMO and data can even be
higher for models that give worse descriptions of the data when
measurement assumptions are confounded with model fitting by
DEMO use of a priori parameters (Birnbaum, 1973, 1974b). The DEMO
problem for correlation coefficients applies when one uses per-
centage correct as the global index of fit and confounds measure-
ment and model testing DEMO not estimating parameters within the
model being tested. For example, consider DEMO perfectly multipli-
cative data from Example 1 of Birnbaum (1973, 1974b). Suppose
one categorizes a prediction as “correct” when a model correctly
DEMO whether the dependent variable is greater or less than 28.5.
It was found that the additive model was correct in 96% of the
predictions, and the multiplicative model had only 75% correct.
This example illustrates that DEMO methods used by Brandsta¨tter et
al. (2006) lead to wrong conclusions when a priori measures are
linearly related to the “true” scale values DEMO perfectly reproduce
the data.
The method of analysis in Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) contains an
additional problem: They used parameters estimated with one
index of fit and then compared models using another index of fit.
DEMO parametric models are fit using least squares or maximum
likelihood to choice proportions by individuals, heuristic models
are devised to maximize percentage correct in “predicting” the
modal choices (Brandsta¨tter et al. 2006, p. 425). DEMO squares
solutions to individual choice proportions do not necessarily pro-
duce the highest percentage of correct predictions of the modes in
aggregate data. Because DEMO priority heuristic does not predict
choice proportions or individual data, it DEMO not allow itself to be
compared using the same criteria that were used to optimize the
parameters of models like CPT and TAX.
One DEMO safely assert that the mode is “better” than the mean
because it is more often correct than the mean, but this statement
is trivial. For any distribution, the mean minimizes the sum of
squared deviations, DEMO median minimizes the sum of absolute
deviations, and the mode minimizes DEMO number of errors. For
example, if we choose the mode of DEMO numbers 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3,
5, 6, it will be correct 44% of the time, and if we choose the mean
(2), it will be right 0% of the time. Certainly if we “take the best”
value (0), it will be right more often than the mean. However, if we
use the mean, our sum of squared errors will be 32, DEMO is less
than the sum of squared errors for the mode (DEMO); so by the sum of
squares criterion, the mean is DEMO than the mode.
So even if we agreed to use percentage correct predicting modal
choices as our global index, then we should use that same criterion
to estimate parameters for all of the models. Because percentage
DEMO is not a continuous bitonic function of each parameter, use
of DEMO criterion creates technical problems in model fitting because
this criterion has local minima, nonunique solutions, and “flat”
regions where fit is unchanged by DEMO variations in the param-
eters (e.g., see Figures 1 and 2).
Are these problems of exporting parameters just hypothetical
worries that can DEMO ignored? No. Suppose Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006)
wanted to use the best-fit parameters of TAX from Birnbaum and
Navarrete (1998) in DEMO contests of fit. Should they use the
best-fit value to the averaged data ( 0.73), or should they use
the median best-fit value from individual participants ( 0.41)?
Figure 1 shows that choosing DEMO would make TAX appear the
better model for the Erev et al. (2002) data, but choosing 0.73
would make priority heuristic seem the (slightly) better model for
those data. But neither of those values DEMO the number of
correct predictions of the modal choices in Birnbaum and Na-
varrete (1998). That “best” value was ˆ  0.62 (DEMO ˆ  0.92 and
ˆ  0.28, TAX correctly predicted 95 DEMO the 112 choices).
Are there any proper uses for model fitting and parameter
estimation at all? Yes. One can use parameter estimates from
choices made by a person to predict other choices made in the
DEMO context by that same person; indeed, this assumption is
Birnbaum’s (DEMO, p. 456) principle of scale convergence (Birn-
baum, 1974a, DEMO, 1990; Birnbaum & Veit, 1974). When that
fails, one can safely reject a model (e.g., see Birnbaum & Sutton,
DEMO). In addition, one can use parameter estimates from one
model DEMO predict where to find critical violations of a rival model.
Testing Critical Properties
Rather than comparing global indices of fit applied to nondiag-
nostic DEMO using a priori parameter values, a better way to com-
pare DEMO is to explore cases in which the implications are
systematically different for rival models. By testing critical prop-
erties— by which I mean properties DEMO hold true for any functions
and any parameters for at least one of the models and not for all of
the models— one can DEMO discriminations between theories that
are not limited to particular parametric or functional assumptions.
For example, CPT implies first-order stochastic dominance:
Despite its free parameters and functions, there is no set of func-
tions or parameters that allows CPT to predict violations of sto-
chastic dominance. Therefore, one does not need to estimate
parameters to test CPT in a study DEMO stochastic dominance (e.g.,
Birnbaum & Navarrete, 1998). Such tests are far stronger than
merely showing that with certain parameters, a model does not
predict a choice, whereas with other parameters, that same DEMO
could predict that same choice.
Birnbaum (2007) devised three new critical properties that can
be used to test the family of lexicographic semiorder DEMO
Because the priority heuristic is a type of lexicographic semiorder,
it is possible to test a wider set of theories than just the DEMO
heuristic. For example, one can test the possibility that different
people DEMO use different priority orders with different threshold
parameters. These new tests even allow one to test the theory that
the data result from a DEMO in which people randomly change
258
COMMENTS
from trial to trial, shifting among different lexicographic semi-
orders.
Priority Dominance
Priority dominance is the assumption that if a dimension has
DEMO, no change on dimensions with lower priorities should be
able to DEMO a choice. For example, according to the priority
heuristic, people should choose S  ($50, 0.5; $49) over R  ($50,
0.9; $0) because the lowest consequence of S exceeds the DEMO
consequence of R by more than 1/10 of the highest consequence in
either gamble. If the lowest consequence has priority over the other
DEMO dimensions, people should also choose S ($50, 0.5; $49)
over R ($100, 0.9; $0) because the lower consequences are DEMO
same, and the difference still exceeds 1/10 of the highest DEMO
quence. Instead, Birnbaum (2007) found that 81% of 242 under-
DEMO preferred S over R, but only 35% of the same people
DEMO S over R. These percentages differ significantly from
50% in opposite directions. Other tests of priority dominance,
designed to check if different people DEMO have different priori-
ties, lead to similar conclusions: Very few people appear to obey
priority dominance.
Dimension Integration
The test of dimension integration DEMO if changes on one dimen-
sion or another that individually do not reverse a choice can
combine to reverse a choice (Birnbaum, 2007)DEMO For example, if
S  ($40, 0.6; $38) is DEMO to all three of the following—R 
($45, 0.1; $0), R ($100, 0.1; $0), and R ($45, 0.9; $0)—then,
as shown next, S should also be preferred to R ($100, 0.9; $0),
according to any of the DEMO heuristic models. Note that the
difference between R and R is a change in the highest prize from
$45 to $100, and the difference between R and R is a change in
probability from 0.1 to DEMO If neither of these two changes by itself
is enough to reverse the choice, then their combination should not
reverse the choice between S and R . However, Birnbaum (2007)
found that 89%, 77%, and 72% of 266 participants chose S over R,
R, DEMO R , respectively, but only 27% chose S over R , DEMO
that people integrate these dimensions. According to the priority
heuristic, the DEMO should have chosen S in every case because
the difference in the lowest consequence ($38 versus $0) should
have been decisive in all DEMO choices.
Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) concluded that when the ratio of EVs
exceeds two, the priority heuristic is not very accurate. Brandsta¨t-
ter et al. (2006) conjectured that either people do, in fact, DEMO
information or that decisive differences—large differences on one
dimension or another—were the cause of failures of the priority
heuristic that were correlated with EV. DEMO above example of
dimension integration includes three choices with ratios of EV
outside this range. The example above rules out the decisive
difference interpretation DEMO the EV correlation; in other words, the
results show that people do in fact integrate. Birnbaum and La-
Croix (in press) presented DEMO tests of dimension integration in
which the EV ratios fell inside the estimated boundaries of the
EV-revised priority heuristic. Those tests also showed clear
DEMO of integration.
Interactive Independence
Birnbaum (2007) also proposed testing interactive indepen-
dence, defined as follows:
A  x,p;y  B  x,p;y N A  x,p;y  B DEMO x,p;y,
in which Birnbaum found violations when x  x  y  y  0.
Note that the only change DEMO the two choices is that the
common probability, p, has been changed to p. If there is no
interaction between probability and consequences, a change in the
(common) probability should not reverse the choice DEMO A and
B. Instead, Birnbaum (2007) found that 71% of DEMO participants
chose B  ($55, 0.1; $20) over A  ($95, 0.1; $5), but only 17%
of the same people chose B ($55, 0.99; $20) over A ($95,
0.99; $5), which is evidence of dimension interaction.
Transitivity of Preference
A fourth property that can be used to compare the priority
heuristic against DEMO like TAX or CPT is transitivity of pref-
erence, the assumption DEMO if A  C and C  E, then A  DEMO
Whereas TAX and CPT satisfy transitivity, the priority heuristic
violates transitivity (Brandsta¨tter et al., 2006). For example, the
priority heuristic predicts DEMO most people should prefer A 
($500, 0.29; $0) over C  ($450, 0.38; $0), that they should prefer
C over E  ($400, 0.46; $0), and that the majority should violate
transitivity by choosing E over A because the difference in DEMO
ability exceeds 0.1 in this choice.
Tversky (1969) reported that transitivity was violated by some
people in such choices, but he did not claim that the majority of his
participants were intransitive, as implied by the priority heuristic.
Birnbaum and Gutierrez (2007) found that 77% of DEMO participants
were consistent with the transitive order predicted by the TAX
model (E  C  A, 22% were consistent with other transitive
DEMO, and only 1% were estimated to be intransitive. Birnbaum
(2007), Birnbaum and Gutierrez (2007), and Birnbaum and
LaCroix (in press) searched for violations of transitivity predicted
by the priority heuristic (including replication of the Tversky
study) without finding a single case in which the majority violated
transitivity.
EV and the Priority Heuristic
Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) noted that their model might be made
more accurate if it assumed that people compute the EV of each
gamble, take their ratio, DEMO choose the gamble with the higher EV
if the ratio exceeds two. Suppose people only use the priority
heuristic when this ratio is less DEMO two. This modification might
be able to save the heuristic from some of the evidence against it
because EV is an integrative model with DEMO interaction between
probability and consequence.
But even this modification would not account for all of the
previous findings. For example, violations of stochastic dominance
reported by Birnbaum (1999b, 2004a, 2004b, 2005a) are violations
of EV, as well as violations of the priority heuristic. Violations of
restricted branch independence and cumulative independence also
include cases in which people violate DEMO EV and the priority
heuristic. For example, R  ($97, DEMO; $11, 0.1; $2, 0.8) has a
higher EV (12.4) than S  ($52, 0.1; $48, 0.1; $2, 0.8), whose EV
COMMENTS
259
is 11.6; however, 68% chose S over R (Birnbaum & Navarrete,
1998), contrary to both EV and the priority DEMO So even the
addition of EV to the list of steps in the priority heuristic does not
account for previous results.
Nor does this DEMO of EV into the priority heuristic
explain all the new findings by Birnbaum (2007). For example, in
several tests of dimension interaction, EV ratios are less than two,
and yet people display evidence DEMO interaction. Similarly, the
priority heuristic (without the EV modification) predicts DEMO peo-
ple should prefer the “safe” gamble S  ($51, 0.5; $50, 0.5) over
the “risky gamble” R  ($100, 0.1; $50, 0.9)—it has a much lower
probability of the lowest DEMO and the lowest conse-
quences are equal. Instead, Birnbaum (2007) DEMO that 67% of
242 participants chose the “risky” gamble, which has DEMO of $55,
compared with EV  $50.5 for the “safe” gamble. If we assume
that EV is the reason for this violation, we must conclude that the
threshold for using EV is less than 9%, in which case most people
should prefer ($100, 0.5; $0, DEMO) over $40 for sure. (In this case
the risky gamble has an EV of $50, compared with $40, which
represents a ratio DEMO 1.25.) But we know that most people prefer
$40 in this DEMO, contrary to EV (Birnbaum, 1999b; Tversky &
Kahneman, 1992). Furthermore, the gambles used by Birnbaum
and Gutierrez (2007) varied by steps as small as 3.3% in EV. If we
assume that DEMO did not use the priority heuristic in Birnbaum
and Gutierrez (2007) because they used EV instead, we must
conclude that people choose by EV ratios as small as 1.033.
These examples show that, although manipulations that affect
EV can be used to create violations of the priority DEMO,
incorporating EV into the priority heuristic does not provide a
consistent account for all the violations of that model. A better way
to DEMO the priority heuristic would be to include a more accu-
rate integrative model, rather than using EV as the first step. For
example, DEMO might postulate that people compute TAX and make
a decision on the basis of it first. But this approach then leads to
the following DEMO: Once we incorporate an accurate integra-
tive model as the first DEMO, are there any phenomena left that
require the use of the DEMO of the priority heuristic for their expla-
nation?
The confession by Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006, p. 426) that gambles
similar in EV make “difficult” choices seems an admission that
people make decisions by computation DEMO not by a verbal analysis
of propositions. But the idea that people use EV, or make any other
such computation before deciding to use the priority heuristic,
contradicts the theoretical arguments by Brandsta¨tter et al. DEMO
people make decisions by verbal heuristics, unless we suppose
people are DEMO making calculations. This admission also
seems to contradict the idea that people try to be “fast and frugal”
by ignoring some of the information, because calculating EV
requires all of the information. Furthermore, EV is an integrative
model with trade-offs, whereas Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) argued
that people do not integrate information.
The priority heuristic was intended to provide DEMO “fast and frugal”
way for a primitive, language-based decision maker to DEMO
risky gambles. If one wanted to be fast, why would he DEMO she first
compute EV, take a ratio, and then decide not to use it? Because
the EV rule does not account for violations of stochastic domi-
nance, the decision maker has to make two different decisions
using all of the information (EV ratio and stochastic dominance) DEMO
decide whether to use the priority heuristic.
How much of the domain is excluded by the restriction on EV?
Consider again two-branch gambles DEMO prizes uniformly distrib-
uted between $0 and $100 and probabilities uniformly distributed
between 0 and 1. On the basis of 100,000 simulated random
DEMO, the restriction 1/2  EV1/EV2  2 excluded 39% DEMO such
choices. Recall that half this space is ruled out by the stochastic
dominance alone; the union of both criteria rules out 59% of the
space.
If our domain of interest is all choices between sure DEMO, c, and
(x, p; y)—with uniformly distributed prizes DEMO $0 to $100 —the
exclusion zone becomes even greater. For 100,000 simulated ran-
dom pairs, 67% are excluded by stochastic dominance alone, DEMO
are excluded by EV ratio alone, and only 28% of the DEMO are
not excluded by one or both of these conditions.
Brandsta¨tter et al. (2006) excluded other choices from their
model; for example, DEMO conjectured that people would not use the
priority heuristic for choices with small consequences. This re-
duces the space further and requires a third DEMO stage that
precedes the priority heuristic. The priority heuristic thus applies to
a very narrow set of choices, and even within this narrow domain,
it does not account for data of Tversky and Kahneman (1992) or
Mellers et al. (1992), when these data are properly DEMO Nor
does the priority heuristic account for the results of Birnbaum and
Chavez (1997) or Birnbaum and Navarrete (1998), which Brand-
sta¨tter et al. did not attempt to describe with their model. Finally,
DEMO with three extra predecision stages, the priority heuristic does
not explain DEMO new results of Birnbaum and Gutierrez (2007), who
found that DEMO people satisfy transitivity in cases in which the
priority heuristic predicts that most people should violate it. Nor
does the priority heuristic account for DEMO of new critical
properties like dimension interaction and dimension integration
(Birnbaum, 2007; Birnbaum & LaCroix, in press).

lyzed data of Erev, Roth, Slonim, and Barron (2002) DEMO display a
correlation between the accuracy of the priority heuristic and
expected value (EV). From this correlation, they argued that peo-
ple DEMO two processes to choose between gambles: First, they act
as if they compute ratios of EV and choose the gamble with the
higher DEMO when this ratio exceeds a threshold, which the authors
estimated to DEMO two. Given this parameter, 56 of the 100 choices of
Erev DEMO al. were supposedly decided by EV. Second, people sup-
posedly used DEMO priority heuristic to make the remaining 44
choices. Whereas the priority heuristic alone had 15 errors pre-
dicting these 100 modal choices, the EV rule plus priority heuristic
had six errors. But even with EV, a free parameter, and a lexico-
graphic heuristic, this model does not DEMO as well as either the
transfer of attention exchange (TAX) model or cumulative pros-
pect theory (CPT), each of which had only one error when the
same choices were reproduced. Because several models can DEMO
these data almost equally well, I think it best to say DEMO these data,
like the Kahneman and Tversky (1979) data, DEMO simply not diag-
nostic for comparing those models. Given the fact that they use an
“as-if” (EV) model and estimate its parameter (two) post hoc, it
seems odd that Brandsta¨tter et al. continue to DEMO against “as-if”
models and parameter estimation.
The EV plus priority heuristic model does not fit other, more
diagnostic studies, as Brandsta¨tter et al. (2008) acknowledged. To
handle such data, they argued that each new DEMO of the EV plus
priority heuristic should be taken as evidence for another heuristic.
Among the additional heuristics they added to the theoretical stew
DEMO “dominance,” “similarity,” “toting up,” “cancellation,” “com-
bination,” and the “most-likely” heuristic. Consider how their
“toting-up” heuristic was devised. Because DEMO plus priority heu-
ristic is correct for fewer than half of the modal choices in
Birnbaum and Navarrete (1998), Brandsta¨tter et al. decided to
replicate part of that study. There were 144 choices in the DEMO
study, including 112 in the main experimental designs that tested
stochastic DEMO and cumulative independence. For reasons I
do not understand, Brandsta¨tter et DEMO decided to examine only 54
of those 112 choices, so their DEMO data did not allow tests of
stochastic dominance or of upper or lower cumulative indepen-
dence. Also puzzling were their decision to use a DEMO number
of participants than in the original study, their use of DEMO new
formats for the presentation of gambles, and other changes in
DEMO Unlike the study by Birnbaum and Navarrete, every{1g42fwefx}
