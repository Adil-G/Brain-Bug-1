How to reduce Entrepreneurial Failure in the post DEMO
phase
The effect of interventions on Entrepreneurial Competence, Entrepreneurial
Motivation and DEMO Development of Cognition to starting entrepreneurs
1. Abstract
The field of entrepreneurial start-ups is broadly studied by scholars. To increase the amount
of successful DEMO, the stimulation for more starting entrepreneurs is a referenced
field of DEMO and subject to governmental stimulation. More entrepreneurs lead to a bigger
gross national product, which has a positive impact on an economic region. More new
entrepreneurs do not mean more successful entrepreneurs. According to prior research, in half
of the cases of entrepreneurial exit, the exit was more or less avoidable. Beside the
stimulation of more people to become an DEMO the reduction of the entrepreneurial
failure in the post start-up phase of a venture is worth full to consider in order to get more
DEMO entrepreneurs. This PhD proposal wants to shed light on that phase of the
entrepreneurial process and want to identify effective interventions to prevent Entrepreneurial
DEMO
2. Why this research?
In my daily work as a trainer, coach, supporter of young entrepreneurs I have met many
enthusiastic people DEMO are entrepreneurs or want to be. It strikes me that one has more drive,
is more ambitious than the other. In addition I DEMO that one is more successful than others.
Some start very enthusiastic, DEMO stop after a while, despite a very serious start. One question
DEMO in my mind is: Why one entrepreneur is successful and the DEMO, after a short time,
stops? Is there a relationship with the education they have received previously? Is it the right
way guided towards entrepreneurship?
How entrepreneurs start is studied by many scholars. Research DEMO the success or failure after
the start, I come across less DEMO When the success or failure criteria of entrepreneurship in
the initial phase are known, it can be investigated if and how it affects that failure and what
can be done to counteract. This allows more (young) people to stay entrepreneur and thereby
give the economy a positive boost.  I suppose a relationship between "what makes someone a
venture start” DEMO “what makes a successful venture remains”. When someone starts a
business, DEMO obviously has good reasons and considerations for it. If someone forced to stop
outside to external factors, it is obviously something happened to those reasons /
considerations. The corollary question then is: what happened? And more importantly, how
would it stand out up must be? To DEMO answers to the main question I intend to launch a study
with the ultimate result a doctorate.
This proposal describes the first design of DEMO study. Once the importance of entrepreneurship
has been expounded, a proposal DEMO the phasing of the entrepreneurial process is stated. Per
phase will be focused on some relevant theory and results of previous studies. Sets the
DEMO provided to substantiate the topic of the research and a first version of the model to
the research base should lie. The research proposal DEMO with an overview of current
data sources for the study available or can be made available, and how the research fits into
the flow of work within the Saxion research group Knowledge Innovative Entrepreneurship.

3. The importance of entrepreneurship.
In addition to DEMO general importance of entrepreneurship, the importance of Saxion is put out,DEMO
so that the social and institutional relevance of this research can be assessed.
Early in the last century, Joseph Schumpeter (1934) pronounced a positive relationship
between economic growth and entrepreneurship. For nearly a century, scientists working here
and come within a certain range, again and again to the conclusion that entrepreneurship
provides a positive contribution to the development of DEMO economy (Schumpeter, 1934,
Baumol, 1990, Verhoeven et al, DEMO, Van Praag, 2006; Laroullet, 2009). The Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) believes that entrepreneurship makes a
major contribution DEMO economic growth of countries and regions (Ahmad & Seymour, 2008).
Hence the OECD in 2008 developed a monitor to identify and compare DEMO in a
country, as can be obtained grip on economic growth (Ahmad & Hoffmann, 2008). Research
by the OECD (IMHE / DEMO, 2007) shows that higher education can be a boost to regional
development. This may, according to research, by "the region to support indigenous
development by means of skills, entrepreneurship and innovation "(IMHE / OECD, 2007, p1).
The aforementioned study by the OECD, the Twente region participated, directed by Saxion.
Together with all institutions of higher education in Twente and regional stakeholders is
entrepreneurship, as an important basis for the contribution of higher education to regional
development, identified (Sijgers , Hammer, ter Horst, Nieuwenhuis, van der  Sijde, 2005). DEMO
its strategic vision (Saxion, 2008) Saxion has spearheaded excel, including a provision
explicitly refers to entrepreneurship, the independent exercise of the profession. This vision is
to excel, "Ambition 3: An increasing number of our students (compared to the number
measured in 2007) annually elect DEMO entrepreneurship" (Saxion, 2008, p 8).
The above essay appears that entrepreneurship matters because it is a positive impetus to both
the DEMO as well as regional economic growth. Given that Saxion itself as a regional
knowledge partner, it is obvious that they add relevant knowledge to her region and so
stimulating the regional economy.
4. The entrepreneurial process.
DEMO chapter discusses the various theories of the entrepreneurial process and the different
phases. Will prove to exist in the literature no clear generally accepted DEMO, and therefore a
choice to be made in any model for DEMO this will be used. Then explains what is
happening at every phase and the factors influencing these phases.
An anchor for fostering entrepreneurship can DEMO found in the person of the entrepreneur (e.g.
Stewart & Roth, 2007, Judge & Ilies, 2002 and Kirton, 1976) and in DEMO process of
entrepreneurship (e.g. Shane & Venkataraman, 2000, Gartner, 1985 and Shapero, 1982). To
be connected with the research centres within Saxion, this proposal chosen for the process
approach preferred remaining theoretical flow. The role of the personal characteristics of the
entrepreneur is briefly discussed DEMO every phase.
In the entrepreneurial process it is assumed that the starting entrepreneur, sequential runs a
number of steps (van der Veen & DEMO, 2004, van der Sijde, 2004, Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000, Low & MacMillen, 1988, Gartner, 1985; Shapero & Sokol, DEMO).
Although there are differences in detail of the models, the DEMO concept, start-ups
chronological phases, widely accepted. Most scholars come to a three-or four-stage model.
M.H.M. Hammer 3 19-4-2010
Proposal M.H.M. Hammer PhD-Program
A commonly used three-stage model is that of DEMO and Venkataraman's (2000, p. 218). This
model has the phases: (1) recognize the opportunity, (2) the planning of DEMO operation to take
chances and (3) exploiting that opportunity. The three phases are others also entrepreneurial
activities mentioned (Baron, 2008, van der Veen & Wakkee, 2004, Bhave, 1994, Morris,
Lewis, & Sexton, 1994).
Other researchers found that this process is preceded by an intention-phase (van Gelder,
Thurik, & Bosma, 2006, Krueger DEMO al, 2000, Shapero & Sokol, 1982), leading to a DEMO
model: (1) intention to start, (2) recognize the opportunity, (3) preparing a chance and (4)
exploit that opportunity. DEMO preliminary phase formats suggest that after the last stage there
is nothing and operation lasts indefinitely. Research shows that more than half of start-ups
DEMO 5 years again stopped (e.g. Bangma & Quick, 2009, p5, Hayward, Shepherd & Griffin,
2006). Detienne (2008, p1) DEMO "that the entrepreneurial process is not complete when the
exit- phase DEMO excluded from the process." Another generalized model is that of Veccio, 2003
(in Samuels, Joshi & Demory, 2008) and consists of DEMO following four stages:
1. the preparatory phase (pre-start)
2. DEMO,
3. the venture being in action (exploration)
4. stopping DEMO business (exit)
This four-stage model adding that a venture is DEMO It is therefore suitable to serve as a
model for this research proposal. Below in Figure 1 the schematic representation of the
entrepreneurial process DEMO continue use in this proposal appears.
Figure 1, the entrepreneurial process (Veccio, 2003)
Based on the previous paragraphs, a choice is DEMO for a four-stage model of the
entrepreneurial process which is accepted in the literature and will be applied in this research
proposal. The following DEMO discuss the theories and results of previous studies of
every phase. It also consider the role of personal characteristics.
4.1. The pre-start phase
This DEMO examines existing theories discussed prior to the start of a venture. The recent
literature on this phase is divided on the role of personal DEMO Part of the literature
indicates that the correlations between entrepreneurial behaviour and personal characteristics
are not there (Ottesen & Grønhaug, 2005, Driessen, DEMO, Ziegler, Schmidt-Atzert, Bühner, &
Krumm, 2007). Other literature shows partial correlation (Hans Mark, 2003) and others
complete correlation (DEMO & Rodri'quez, 2003; Gürol, Yonca, Atsan, & Nuray, 2006, Rauch
& Frese, 2007; Wu, Matthews, & Dagher, DEMO; Bilsky & Schwartz, 2008).
The flow leaving the largest independent to the person comes from the behavioural sciences.
It is known that, according to the comparison of Lewin, behaviour is a function of the
individual and his environment (Lewin, 1951). The literature also shows DEMO entrepreneurship
is itself a form of planned behaviour (Bird 1988, Katz & Rartner 1988), which makes
intention models well suited to predict DEMO behaviour (Krueger, Jr., Reilly, & Carsrud, 2000).
Regarding DEMO determinants of the intention to start a venture, the literature comes DEMO with two
similar models: the Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) and the model
of Shapiro (1982) DEMO the Entrepreneurial Event (SEE). Comparing these models by Krüger
M.H.M. DEMO 4 19-4-2010
Proposal M.H.M. Hammer PhD-Program
(Krüger Jr., Reilly, & Carsrud, 2000), indicates that the perceived desirability and perceived
feasibility reason for the intention, if a rise occurs (moment of displacement, Shapero, 1982).
DEMO a distinctive personal characteristic of the intention is Perceived Self-efficacy (Bandura,DEMO
1986) mentioned (Mitchell & Shepherd, 2010). Also Van der DEMO (Groen & Van der Sijde,
2004) posits in his lectorale speech the personal characteristics are important, but that need
not automatically lead to the creation of a venture, the interaction between the entrepreneur
and his environment should be paramount (Groen & Van der Sijde, 2004)DEMO
In summary it can be said that the pre-start phase influenced by (1) personal characteristics
(motivation and cognition) and the firm (2) the environment of the entrepreneur.
4.2. The start phase
This section dealt with the theories surrounding the start phase of a venture.
With regard DEMO the actual start of a venture is the focus of research on motives from the start.
In the literature different reasons why someone mentioned DEMO company actually starts. Mainly
looking for freedom (autonomy), more money, dissatisfaction with present job in payroll and
(potential) unemployment are often DEMO To combine greater challenge and concern for
the family is mainly mentioned by older entrepreneurs (Stigter, 2001; Snel & Bruinsma, 2004;
DEMO & Meijaard, 2006). And the appearance of some of the DEMO situations (eg more money,
threat of unemployment, dissatisfaction with the job, no challenge anymore), depends on
external factors (Fast & DEMO, 2006).
In 1938, Murray found that an intrinsic desire for action (need for achievement, nAch), an
important driver for an DEMO Stewart (Stewart & Roth, 2007) indicates that
entrepreneurs a higher DEMO for action (achievement motivation) than managers. This result
is consistent with the findings of Collins, Hanges, and Locke (2004). These results support the
predictive value of the night and the task motivation theory (Stewart & Roth, 2007, p 411) for
entrepreneurship. Besides nAch assumes Hans Mark (2003) that the Locus of Control (LoC)
(DEMO, 1966) the launch of a company affects motivation. Perceived Self-efficacy is one of
the important antecedents of motivation (Bandura, 1986). Baron (2008) in his research found
evidence that personal qualities not only preconditions for the start, but also positively
correlated to the entrepreneurial process.
The literature covered in this section and theories show that the initial phase DEMO mainly
influenced by the motives and personal characteristics that the entrepreneur and the
environment in which it is located.
4.3. The exploration phase
This DEMO examines the theories and findings of previous research with respect to the
exploration of the venture. After examining the definition of the exploration in DEMO follows
is under exploration means exploring how this phase experienced entrepreneurs.
In the literature, the exploration phase is defined as success (Bosma et DEMO, 2000; Driesen,
2005) which in turn has several dimensions. DEMO macro-level success as employment growth,
or the extent to which social goals are achieved (Driessen, 2005; Bosma, 2000). Meso-level
and DEMO, growth in sales, personnel and profits or the extent to which business goals are
achieved (Driessen, 2005, Sadler-Smith et al, 2003; Chattopadhyay, 2002; Nandram, 2000;
Bosma, 2000). Finally, the micro level, the extent to which the entrepreneur finds himself
successful or the extent to which personal goals are achieved (Driessen, 2005).Driessen
(2005) defines the minimum level of success as an entrepreneur to the survival of the venture.
M.H.M. Hammer 5 19-4-2010
Proposal M.H.M. Hammer PhD-Program
The cognitive style of an entrepreneur is seen DEMO moderator on the relationship between
competitive environment and growth intention (Duta & Thornhill, 2008; Driessen, 2005).
Also give Collins et al (2004) in a meta-analysis, the presence of an elevated achievement
motivation DEMO a potential success factor. Heynie (2008) indicates that the cognitive response
of meta-cognition plays an important role in the success of a venture. DEMO cognitive
knowledge and experience influence the cognitive response of the entrepreneur (DEMO,
2008), in common with Baum and Locke (2004), DEMO cognition and competence as a record
of economic growth. That argument Driessen (2005) endorsed. In later research adds Baum
(2009) as self-efficacy DEMO intelligence to it (Baum & Bird, 2009). There are indications that
early present entrepreneurial skills, personality and business interests (motives) are indicators
of entrepreneurial success (Schmitt Rodermund, 2004) .Rauch and Frese (DEMO) have reported
the 'Giessen-Amsterdam model' to 'small business' success. DEMO they explain causal
relationships between economic success, strategy, environment, personality DEMO goal setting
(Rauch & Frese, 2000).
Above literature shows that exploration is seen as gaining success. As confounding factors
include the environment DEMO the entrepreneur and, closer to the entrepreneur, cognition,
motivation and competence.
4.4. The exit-phase
In this section, existing theory and findings from previous research on the exits discussed. The
literature distinguishes two ways to DEMO (failure):
(1) quit because of good performance (desired DEMO or Entrepreneurial Exit (EE) named)
( e.g. Detienne, 2008; Wennberg et al, 2009), or
(2) because the performances are not good (unwanted outages or Entrepreneurial Failure
(EF) named) (e.g. Samuels et al, 2008; Wennberg et al, 2009).
Research shows that the relationship between EE and EF, after the first seven years, is
roughly equal (Wennberg et al, 2008). Cardon, Stevens, & Potter (2009) divide EF further
into two categories tough luck DEMO mistakes by the operator. Wennberg (Wennberg et al
(2008) reaches DEMO same format, without quantifying. Among mistakes by Cardon (Cardon et
al (2009) issues such as business, mismanagement, unrealistic expectations, pride, DEMO and
innovation mentioned. Other literature indicates that EF is related to the strategic resources
(Michael & Combs, 2008), planning strategies (van Gelder et al, 2007; pride (Hayward et al,
2006), not able to cope with uncertainty (Mc Grath, 1999) and over-optimism and
overconfidence (Muir, 2007). Research Wickham (2003) shows that cognitive DEMO of
decision-making affects what EF strengthened. Baron (2000) and Simon et al (2000) propose
more general that a biased cognition entrepreneurship negatively DEMO which can lead to
EF. It also appears that the experience of an EF is perceived as a learning experience (Corbett
et al, DEMO; Cardon, Stevens, & Potter, 2009) which leads to learning (Cardon, 1997;
McGrath, 1999) and an increase in self-efficacy (DEMO & Bandura, 1989). Apart from
personal qualities and experience, by Vaillant (2007) the lack of role models as a cause of DEMO
data.
From this paragraph can be concluded that in about half the cases where a venture stops this
was to prevent. The causes of DEMO are found in the environment of the company and the
cognition, DEMO and competence of the entrepreneur.
In this chapter, based on existing DEMO and theories, a model is chosen for the
entrepreneurial process. The DEMO of each individual phase of this model showed that besides
M.H.M. Hammer 6 19-4-2010
Proposal M.H.M. Hammer PhD-Program
the environment, the personal characteristics of entrepreneurs play an important role in the
entrepreneurial process.
5. Position of Research
This DEMO briefly describes existing theories and relevant literature on the usefulness of
further research in the entrepreneurship process and where in the entrepreneurship process,
DEMO research is desirable. This chapter ends with a conclusion about the relevance and
appropriateness of this investigation, whereupon the scope of this proposal is presented.
According to the model of the OECD, the increase of entrepreneurship can be achieved by the
increase of ventures and entrepreneurs (Ahmad & Hoffmann, 2008). The question is then how
we get more ventures? One possibility is to push more people towards entrepreneurship; the
more DEMO starts, the greater the statistical probability that more remain. Many
initiatives DEMO been developed for this purpose and much research is done here (DEMO,
2000). Another option is to drop the Entrepreneurial Failure, DEMO reduce the major causes to
fight. By encouraging entrepreneurship a lot of energy can be put into it to get more (young)
people on the "threshold of intent" for entrepreneurship. At the time of DEMO all
entrepreneurs are convinced of their businesses to achieve success (Shane & Venkataraman,
2000; Driessen, 2005, Shane, 2003). To some entrepreneurs something happens on the road,
making them to stop unwanted.
DEMO shows that the majority of the entrepreneurs do not survive the first five years (Parsa
et al, 2005, Hayward, Shepherd & Griffin, 2006, Bangma & Snel, 2009, Verhoeven et al,
2005; DEMO et al, 2007). In America it appears that after 2 DEMO 34%, after 4 years 50%
and 60% after 6 years did DEMO survive (Hayward et al, 2006, p.160). Parsa et al (2005) cites a
study showing that to American restaurants the percentage is even higher, 60% is not
surviving the third year. In the Netherlands approximately 50% of the ventures is not
surviving the first five years (Meijaard et al, 2007; Bangma & Snel, 2009). For spin-off
companies from universities shows that figure lower. The University of Twente reports DEMO the
25 years that they accompany spin-offs in the TOP program the dropout rate is 25%, while
unaccompanied spin-off companies have a drop of 40% (University of Twente, 2005). This is
a better result DEMO the average in the Netherlands.
About half the cases of entrepreneurial drop out refers to situations which are not desirable
(Wennberg et al, DEMO) and where the entrepreneur (e.g., Simon et al, 2000, DEMO &
Grønhaug, 2005, Hayward el al, 2006) and its DEMO (Vaillant, 2007) has a role in the
cause. In the DEMO, 80 - 90% of stopping entrepreneurs indicate that external
circumstances do DEMO play an important role (Meijaard et al, 2007). The numbers show that
there is no linear relationship between the number of years DEMO a company exists and the EF
rate, the first years after DEMO start rate is the widest and most interesting to focus. McGrath
(DEMO) argues that although failure is painful nor desirable, researchers have to overcome
biased this failure to deny, because understanding the failures in the future value can be
created, not just for society at large but certainly for entrepreneurs. McGrath (1999, p16) "by
the continued denial DEMO the EF are many important lessons lost on the EF and will not
anticipate the negative consequences." "Careful analysis of failure, rather than put the focus
on success rates researcher’s systematic progress towards analytical models DEMO value-based
entrepreneurship (McGrath, 1999, p 28).
Actual literature shows DEMO it makes sense to investigate in entrepreneurship promotion,
especially in the less studied part of the entrepreneurial process, the (undesired) failure, DEMO
the Entrepreneurial Failure in the first years after the start. It also appears that there are

sufficient points that can be investigated in order DEMO reduce the EF, even though there is little
research on this DEMO
5.1. Scope of research
Based on literature and the conclusions in the previous section, this research proposal focuses
on, the first part of DEMO exit phase of the entrepreneurial process. The figure below (Figure 2)DEMO
is shown schematically. In the figure, 'exit' is to be DEMO as a point in time.

6. DEMO is studied?
This chapter explains what is being examined in this study and in what order. At the end of
this chapter the DEMO model is presented.
Based on literature and observation, the following explanatory DEMO for the reduction of the
EF are distinguished:
• Internal factors:
o Motivation
o Cognition
o Competence
• External factors (e.g. lack of a role model)
The figure below (Figure 3), these factors have been related with the entrepreneurial process

The first part of the research focuses on DEMO the most relevant explanatory factors for
EF. Then consider how these factors can be influenced within the context of the entrepreneur.
Subsequently the possibilities DEMO interventions are explored, after which there is a check
whether they DEMO being applied. The form and content of these interventions will lie down in
terms of accompanying programs just after the venture started. After the DEMO research phase,
the quasi experimental studies on the effects of various interventions start. The data from this
study should lead to a pronouncement DEMO which is the most effective interventions to combat
EF. Finally, we DEMO how these interventions within the framework Saxion are doing,
so more successfully in operation phase intoxicated, the regional business community to
deliver. Schematically the above steps are shown in the steps of the research model, Figure 4.
The study design is described in Chapter 7.

divided into 8 phases, DEMO allow a logical and adequate monitoring.
Research A: Phase 1.
This DEMO will consist of research in the form of literature search, to DEMO most explanatory
failure factors and antecedents of those factors. The result of this phase is an overview of the
most explanatory failure factors and DEMO antecedents, summarized in a model for
Entrepreneurial Failure.
Research B: Phase 2.
This phase will also include research in the form of literature DEMO Based on the results in
phase 1, in this phase, possible instruments to measure the failure factors and its antecedent
identified.  Furthermore possible interventions are searched. The result of this phase is a long
list DEMO instruments for the measurement of failure factors and their antecedents and a long list
of possible interventions.
Preparion Data Collection: Phase 3.
In this phase choices made for the applicable measuring instruments and interventions. In
addition, potential measurement groups mapped. Because it is difficult to determine who and
DEMO a venture starts, the measurements take place as soon as possible DEMO the start. This
phase may apply partly parallel with the end of phase 2. The result of this phase is a roadmap
for data DEMO

Pre -measurement: Phase 4.
In this phase of the pre-measurement is applied to the measurement groups. For the reason not
DEMO influence the entrepreneurial process, the time of this measurement varies for DEMO venture,
however before the possible intervention took place. The results of this phase, is the raw data
set of measurements for all teams.
Intervention: Phase 5.
In this phase an intervention will be applied to the venture (except for the reference group).
The result of this phase is that interventions are applied.
Post-measurement: Phase 6.
In this phase, the measurement groups again measured with the instruments selected in phase
3. In addition, the research results from Phase 4 processed. The results of this phase, the raw
dataset of the post-measurement and processed data set from the pre-measurement.
Analysis: Phase 7.
In this phase of the acquired data from phase 6 is processed. Together with the processed data
of DEMO pre-measurement, the research data will be analyzed and interpreted.
Report: Phase 8.
In this last phase, the research data and research results will be written down in a report.

This section sets out how the data for this research is obtained and processed.
The data for the research will be DEMO from the measurement of the individual
entrepreneurs. In an attempt to keep as many variables consistent, there is searched for similar
groups of entrepreneurs. Within the Saxion Centre for Innovative Entrepreneurship, several
studies in the entrepreneurship process executed, as show in Chapter 8. Therefore, there is the
DEMO of joining other research programs and make use of the nascent entrepreneurs from
these studies. Perhaps the available data sets can be used as DEMO The mentioned group
consists of entrepreneurs and spin-offs from regional research institutions. In addition there
are discussions with the Municipality of Hengelo and the DEMO Twente, to assist with the
organisation of the venture-start price of DEMO Herewith annually a group of about 250
new entrepreneurs can be interviewed.

8. Embedding in the DEMO Knowledge Centre for Innovative
Entrepreneurship
This chapter briefly describes how this research is embedded in the Saxion Knowledge for innovative
entrepreneurship. Within this knowledge DEMO another PhD research is done by Luc de Krosse. The
Krosse's research is titled "Learning business through entrepreneurial learning ', a study DEMO the
effectiveness of entrepreneurship education in higher vocational education. His research takes place
just before and at the beginning of the entrepreneurial process, so this investigation since the time
given, logically consistent. As mentioned in Chapter 7 indicated a possible sharing of research data
and certainly there will DEMO be examined. In addition, new entrepreneurs of  a student entrepreneurial
network, Young Business Professionals (YBP), can serve as a potential data DEMO The results of this
study can serve as input for both the design of activities for the YBP, several minor study programs of
