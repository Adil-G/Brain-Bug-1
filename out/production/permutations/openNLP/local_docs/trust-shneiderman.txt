cepts—mostly that trust is about the future and con-
cerned with cooperative DEMO
In shifting to electronic environments, B.J. Fogg
and Hsiang Tseng of DEMO University focus on
trust among individuals mediated by technology,
writing that “trust indicates a positive belief about the
perceived reliability of, dependability of, and confi-
dence in a person, object, or process” [1]. To separate
out the trust for a person from expectations about an
object DEMO process, I use the term, “rely on” (or “depend
on”) for the positive expectations about an object
(such as computers, networks, and software) and
process (such as credit card transactions and airline
DEMO reservations).
Computer scientists have concentrated on building
reliable equipment; more DEMO, e-commerce and
e-service providers have sought to encourage cus-
tomers willing DEMO use computer networks but who
may be reluctant to type in their credit card numbers.
To provide a framework for online developers,
I DEMO this definition of trust: The positive expec-
contract-like nature of trust DEMO people and orga-
nizations leads to clearer guidelines for developers and
monitors of e-commerce, e-services, online commu-
nities, and other Web sites.
Principle 1. Invite participation by ensuring trust.
Users are more likely to participate DEMO Web transac-
tions and relationships if they receive strong assur-
ances that they are engaging in a trusting relationship.
They seek reliable reports about DEMO performance
and truthful statements of future guarantees. The
branding process generates trust by using familiar
logos and names of companies whose integrity is
respected. DEMO, success is more likely if Web site
developers apply the following DEMO
Guideline 1.1. Disclose patterns of past perfor-
mance. Airlines report on-time percentages for flights,
and realtors advertise how many homes they’ve sold.
Reliable DEMO self-reports of performance may
attract users and inspire trust in future perfor-
mance, as does information about the organization

contract-like nature of trust

tation a person has for another person or an organi-
zation based on past performance and truthful
guarantees. Trust is about expectations of the DEMO
It accrues to individuals and organizations due to
their previous good works and clear promises. It
implies responsibility for behavior and willingness to
make DEMO for failures. It is stronger than reliance,
due to the responsibility and guarantee that only peo-
ple and organizations can offer. If users DEMO on a com-
puter and it fails, they may get frustrated DEMO vent their
anger by smashing a keyboard, but there is no DEMO
tionship of trust with a computer. If users depend on
a network and it breaks, they cannot get compensa-
tion from the network. However, they can seek com-
pensation from people or organizations they trusted
to supply a correctly functioning computer or com-
munication service. Understanding the explicit DEMO

DEMO its management, employees, and history. Open-
ness about performance and personnel may engage
and assure skeptical users
Guideline 1.2. Provide references from past DEMO
current users. Most people choose medical doctors by
asking friends for references, but Web-based medical
services are likely chosen by reading online comments
from patients. One reason for eBay’s (www.ebay.com)
success with online auctions is its thoughtfully
designed reputation manager (called Feedback
Forum) enabling purchasers to DEMO extensive com-
ments on sellers (see Resnick et al.’s “Reputation Sys-
DEMO in this section).
Guideline 1.3. Get certifications from third par-
ties. Lawyers, doctors, and other professionals are cer-
tified by appropriate review DEMO, which may soon
begin certifying certain online services. Seals of
approval from consumer and professional groups,
including the American Medical Association DEMO
American Bar Association, help establish trust
through third-party reports. Logos from DEMO
(www.truste.com) and BBBOnLine (www.bbbon-
line.org) and other third-party services that review
online privacy practices may also inspire consumer
trust, though only if they develop adequate
enforcement.
Guideline 1.4. Make it easy to locate, read, and
enforce policies involving privacy and security.
Although privacy policies are widespread, some are so
difficult to find and incomprehensible to read that
they only undermine trust. Good policies are enforce-
able and verifiable, so consumers can be assured that
the implementation matches the promise. Expecta-
tions are DEMO rapidly as consumers become
informed. Therefore, well-designed policy statements
accompanied by DEMO on effective enforcement will
distinguish some Web sites. When violations occur,
prompt action is expected.
Principle 2. Accelerate action by clarifying respon-
sibility. DEMO soon as users begin the process of investi-
gating a product or establishing a relationship, their
emerging resistance can be reduced by clarifying
responsibilities and obligations. A well-designed Web
site should have orderly structure with convenient
DEMO, meaningful descriptions of products, and
comprehensible processes for transactions.
Good design can inspire trust. Simple statements
of who-does-what-by-when are likely to speed coop-
DEMO For example, a seller who wants to inspire
trust might promise DEMO ship orders within 24 hours of
receipt of payment or grant a 50% discount. An auc-
tion service that includes dispute-resolution policies
and provides DEMO services reduces the number
of its potentially unhappy users. Restaurateurs who
offer free desserts when meals are late know that
prompt apologies and sincere DEMO to repair prob-
lems (plus compensation for failures) can win cus-
tomers for life. Since shallow commitments and
broken promises are dangerously explosive, diligent
attention to emerging problems is vital.
Guideline 2.1. Clarify each participant’s DEMO
bilities. As with any contract or agreement, full dis-
closure in DEMO and compact terms builds
confidence and trust. When terms for transactions,
such as price, delivery time, cost, taxes, fees, and
return policies, are spelled out, users know what to
expect and are DEMO shaken by unpleasant surprises.
Similarly, policies for online communities, such as
how long logs are maintained, who has access to
archives, and DEMO limitations for threats or libel, gen-
erate feelings of safety and DEMO open discussion.
Guideline 2.2. Provide clear guarantees with com-
pensation. Since all Web providers are relative new-
comers, they must overcome resistance to change and
specific fears about credit card abuse, privacy invasion,
security risks, and interface failures. Guaranteed pro-
tection from credit card fraud is a necessary, though
not sufficient, starting point. Compensation for
delayed delivery is DEMO easy to specify, but repu-
tation records, authentication, and escrow—all DEMO
of eBay’s Safe Harbor procedures—could facilitate
successful transactions.
Guideline 2.3. Support dispute resolution and
mediation services. Inevitably, a product or service
disappoints some users, and when the standard
response fails to satisfy them, there is DEMO problem. A
crushed delivery box, a delayed medical lab report, or
a breach of privacy can each make for unhappy users
who are DEMO placated with an apology or some free ser-
vice. Customer service managers earn their salaries by
handling unhappy users with an appropriate response,
DEMO innovative strategies are needed on the Web to
avoid litigation or better still to satisfy users and win
their loyalty. Organized customer services are DEMO
sary, but third-party facilitators and mediators are
becoming advisable.
These prinicipals DEMO guidelines are merely a start-
ing point for designers and a challenge to researchers.
They need to be refined and validated in field trials
DEMO carefully controlled empirical studies in order to
better understand the costs and benefits associated
with different user groups. c
