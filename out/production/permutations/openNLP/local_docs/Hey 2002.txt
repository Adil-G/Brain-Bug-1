Abstract
Following a brief review of the main experimental work DEMO the economics of risk and uncertainty, both static and
dynamic, this paper reports the results of an experiment testing one of the key DEMO of the theory of dynamic
economic behaviour—that people have a plan and implement it. Using a unique design which enables the plan (if
one exists) to be revealed by the ﬁrst move, the experiment was DEMO via the Internet on a subset of the
University of Tilburg’s ongoing family expenditure survey panel. The advantages of using such a set of DEMO
for the experiment are twofold: the demographic characteristics of the set DEMO known and therefore demographic
inferences can be made; the representativeness of DEMO set is known and therefore inferences about populations
can be made. The results suggest that at least 36% of the subjects had behaviour inconsistent DEMO the hypothesis
under test: that people formulate plans and then implement DEMO Interestingly demographic variables are unable
to explain the consistency or inconsistency of individuals. One conclusion is that subjects simply make errors. An
alternative conclusion, consistent with previous experimental research, is that people are unable to predict their
own future decisions. The implications for dynamic theory (particularly relating to savings and pensions decisions)
are important.
Key words:
experiments, decision making, uncertainty, dynamic, dynamic consistency

1. Introduction
The title of this paper is the title DEMO the talk that I gave in Strasbourg. Clearly a paper that
gave full justice to everything covered in this title would be more than DEMO paper. Instead
I concentrate on a small but very important subset of the material covered by the title—
speciﬁcally concerning the issue of how DEMO take dynamic decisions under risk. However,
in analysing this topic, DEMO ﬁnd it useful to draw on some results from other areas within the
ﬁeld covered by the title of this paper. I will therefore DEMO with some general introductory
remarks concerning the ﬁeld as a whole.
2. The theory of decision making under risk and uncertainty
Economics has a DEMO story of decision making under risk and uncertainty. It
adopts a two-way classiﬁcation which we can summarise in the following table:
6 HEY
1. Static decision making under risk 2. Static decision making DEMO uncertainty
3. Dynamic decision making under risk 4. Dynamic decision making under uncertainty
The two distinctions used in economics are (a) risk versus DEMO and (b) static versus
dynamic. These give us the four classiﬁcations of the table above.
The ﬁrst category, “Static decision making under risk”, is enormous, both as far as theory
is concerned and also DEMO far as experimental studies of those theories are concerned. The
second category, “Static decision making under uncertainty”, is less intensively developed,
but DEMO is a lot of theoretical work and a modest amount of experimental work. The
third category, “Dynamic decision making under risk”, is receiving DEMO theoretical
attention and also experimentalists are moving into the ﬁeld; this DEMO the ﬁeld on which
I will concentrate in this paper. The fourth category, “Dynamic decision making under
uncertainty”, is virtually unexplored, both by theorists and experimentalists.
As I remark above, I intend to concentrate on recent work in the third category, but I
want to draw on some key results from the ﬁrst and second categories. I will therefore DEMO
with an extremely superﬁcial overview2 of these ﬁrst two categories, focussing DEMO
attention on ﬁndings that I want to use later.
The economic theory of static decision making under risk is extremely well-developed.
Its ﬂagship is DEMO Expected Utility theory, a powerful, normatively-appealing, and
extensively applied theory DEMO has numerous important applications, not least in the area
of insurance. DEMO the same time, and as a consequence, it has been tested extensively with
experimental methods, and, at times, has been found wanting. As a consequence of these
perceived shortcomings of the theory, there have been numerous theoretical developments,
which have themselves stimulated further experimental work.
DEMO a theory of individual decision making, the usual experimental way of DEMO Expected
Utility theory and its various rivals is through the direct or indirect testing of the axioms of
the theories. For example the Independence DEMO of Expected Utility theory, which states
that a risky prospect A DEMO preferred to some other risky prospect B if and only if the mixture3
[A, C; p] is preferred to the mixture [B, C; p] for all p and C , can be very simply tested
by offering subjects a choice between A and B and then offering DEMO a choice between
[A, C; p] and [B, C; p]. If we have in place some appropriate incentive mechanism, then
we can see if actual choice (that is, actual preference4) is compatible with the axiom. If it
is then we gain conﬁdence in the axiom; if not then we increasingly suspect the axiom.
A simple example of DEMO procedure is the following. Subjects in an experimental setting
are given two pairwise choice problems, as follows:
Problem 1: a choice between DEMO for sure and the prospect [£40, £0; 0.8].
Problem 2: DEMO choice between the prospect [£30, £0; 0.25] and the prospect [£40, £0; 0.2].
The incentive mechanism5 is the following: after the subject has stated his or her preferred
choice in each of the two DEMO, then one of the two problems is chosen at random, and
the preferred choice on that problem played out for real and the DEMO paid accordingly.
This is a simple test of the Independence Axiom. If a subject obeys the Axiom, then,
if he or she chooses £30 for sure ([£40, £0; 0.8]) in Problem 1, then he or she should
EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS AND THE THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
7
choose [£30, £0; 0.25] ([£40, £0; 0.2]) in Problem 2; if he DEMO she does not, then his or her
behaviour violates the Independence DEMO In practice the experimentalist usually asks
this pair of questions to a whole set of subjects and then does a statistical test of whether
DEMO proportion of the subjects choosing £30 for sure in Problem 1 is signiﬁcantly different
from the proportion of the subjects choosing [£30, £0; DEMO in Problem 2.
It is instructive to ask why the test is done in this particular fashion, and particularly to
ask what is the stochastic story lying behind (and hence justifying) this test. Clearly there
DEMO be some randomness—otherwise the statistical test has no basis. But where is it? Is
it across subjects or within subjects? If the same DEMO of subjects has been asked the two
questions,6 then the randomness must be within subjects—for if it was across subjects, then
one can test for violations subject by subject.
What does this mean—this randomness within DEMO? Simply that there is some ran-
domness in the answers of DEMO subject. As I have described it elsewhere, Hey [1995], there
is some noise or ‘error’ in subjects’ responses.
This is abundantly clear. One DEMO of checking for this is to ask the same question more than
once. It is now generally accepted that, on the type of questions usually asked in experimental
studies of decision making under risk, that if asked the same question twice, up to 30%
of subjects give different answers on the two separate occasions. Very clear evidence is
contained in DEMO experiment which I recently conducted, Hey [2001], in which subjects were
asked the same 100 pairwise choice questions on 5 different occasions (spread over a period
of over a week). The table below gives DEMO idea of the variability in subjects’ responses.
1to2 2to3 3to4 4to5 Sum Over all 5
Minimum 3100 4 3
Maximum 29 22 25 23 DEMO 48
The row labelled ‘minimum’ is the number of different answers given by the subject with
the smallest number of such different answers; the row labelled ‘maximum’ is the number
of different answers given by the DEMO with the largest number of such different answers.
The column headed ‘1to2’ compares the ﬁrst time the subject did the experiment with the
second DEMO; and so on. The column headed ‘sum’ is just the sum DEMO these. The column
headed ‘over all 5’ relates to the number of pairwise choice problems with different answers
given sometime in the ﬁve repetitions.
DEMO ‘minimum’ row shows that there was at least one subject who became consistent by
the third repetition and stayed consistent thereafter. However, the ‘maximum’ row shows
that there were subjects who remained very inconsistent right to DEMO end. Subjects were
generally distributed reasonably evenly between these two extremes.
It is clear from this that there is a lot of ‘noise’ in DEMO responses. We might won-
der whether this is error of some kind or whether there is some uncertainty in subjects’
preferences, but we can certainly conclude that there is error or noise or variability, of a
not negligible magnitude, in the responses of subjects in the kinds of experiments that are
typically carried out to test economic theories of decision DEMO under risk. As economists
we should not be surprised by this, DEMO that it takes time and effort to answer questions

HEY
in an experiment, and the rewards from the experiment may not justify the expenditure of a
large amount of time and effort. DEMO is the ﬁrst message that I want to take from previous
experimental work: that there is ‘noise’ in subjects’ responses.
I also want to take a message from the experimental work done in the second ﬁeld, that
of static decision making under uncertainty. Everyone knows the classic ‘experiment’ DEMO
this ﬁeld—resulting in the Ellsberg Paradox. There are two urns: a DEMO urn which contains
50 white balls and 50 black balls; and DEMO ambiguous (or uncertain) urn which contains 100
balls, each of DEMO may be either white or black. Subjects have to choose an urn and a
colour. Then one ball is drawn at random out of DEMO chosen urn and if it is of the chosen
colour then the subject is given a prize; if it is not of the chosen colour then the subject
is given nothing. The ‘paradox’7 is that subjects DEMO choose the risky rather than the
ambiguous urn.
This description hides some serious problems concerned with the implementation of the
experiment. When Ellsberg described DEMO ambiguous urn he was a little vague about how
actually it is composed. In an experiment you have to tell subjects. If you try DEMO avoid this,
then you have a problem in that subjects may ask you—and then you have to answer. Given
the sophistication of present-day DEMO and present-day subjects, you can not rely on
getting away with DEMO vague answer (and you should not try to—as it is crucial DEMO subjects
understand clearly every aspect of an experiment). Subjects in an experiment are, even if
only implicitly, entering into some kind of DEMO with you. Either them, or the Ethics
Committee of the University, may well want to check that what you are saying is true. DEMO
importantly, you as experimentalist want to make sure that what you DEMO them is true.8 So
you have to work out what you are going to do in implementing the uncertain urn.
This is not an DEMO task. In practice, there are a number of ways of implementing DEMO
uncertain urn. As might be expected, most of them correspond to DEMO theory of economic
behaviour under uncertainty. For example, one way involves DEMO of probabilities:
here subjects are told, for example, that the experimenter will start with 101 cloakroom
tickets numbered from 0 to 100; one of these tickets will be picked at random and the number
DEMO white balls in the urn will be the number on the ticket. Note that this procedure can be
implemented at the end of the DEMO in full view of the subjects—so no deception is, or
needs DEMO be, involved. Moreover it corresponds to a particular interpretation of uncertainty—
DEMO probabilities of probabilities—on which theories9 have been built.
Some may argue that this is not true uncertainty—it is not the uncertainty that Ellsberg
wanted. DEMO wanted something that was truly unknown. But what other method can
we use? Some experimentalists have conditioned the outcome of the experiment on events
which, it is hoped, the subjects know absolutely nothing about—for example DEMO value
of the Malaysian stock market at 9.30 am on Monday the 17th of September 2001. The
experimenter presents two possibilities: one that this index is above 19436.4 and the other
that this index is below DEMO These are the white ball and the black ball in the uncertain
urn. Is this what Ellsberg wanted? Is this true uncertainty?
I must admit I do not know. Notwithstanding the fact that you may DEMO a Malaysian
amongst your subjects, I ﬁnd it worrying that differing DEMO may have different percep-
tions about these two outcomes. So you, DEMO the experimenter, have lost a bit of control over
the experiment. DEMO also ﬁnd it of concern that subjects may worry about why you have chosen
EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS AND THE THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
9
that particular example. DEMO can work it out that you know what the value of the index is
likely to be—you obviously know something about the index. Notwithstanding DEMO fact that
the subject can choose the colour of the ball, DEMO would feel that this implementation would
make the subjects suspicious of what is going on—and hence make them have prejudices
against the uncertain urn. DEMO could try and guard against this by getting a subject chosen
at random to form the uncertain urn—but this could again arouse suspicions. If DEMO have
suspicious subjects you have lost some control. In the UK you could condition on something
more obvious to the subjects—such as the weather DEMO day after the experiment—but here
subjects will bring differing prior knowledge to the experiment: you, as experimenter, again
have lost some control over what is going on.
Actually there is one element of the above DEMO of the experiment that is of concern:
the fact that subjects can choose the colour of the ball on which they bet. The DEMO for this
is to allay any suspicion that the subjects may have that the experimenter has ﬁxed something
in some way. Of course there DEMO other ways round this problem—like ﬁrst asking them how
much they would pay to bet on different colours from different urns—but this complicates
the DEMO somewhat. Note also that if the subjects are reasonably sophisticated and they
are given the option to choose the colour on which they bet, then they can choose the colour
through randomisation themselves—in which case you DEMO carrying out some kind of joint
test of their probabilistic assessments of the two urns and their probabilistic sophistication.
This may be a different DEMO of test than that envisaged by Ellsberg.
The key point that I want to make is that you should have an experimental design in
DEMO everything is clear to the subjects and that there is no deception. In particular, you
should not tell them one thing and then do another. This, as we shall see, has implications
for the design DEMO the experiment that I want to present and discuss.
3. Dynamic decision making under risk
This is the ﬁeld that I want to spend DEMO of my time discussing. It is a ﬁeld where
there is a reasonable amount of theoretical work and a modest amount of experimental
work. DEMO my opinion, it is a ﬁeld wide open to advances in DEMO theory and experiments.
While theorists have done some work in this area, I think that economists are really rather
ignorant of the way the dynamic decisions under risk are taken in practice. I come to this
DEMO as there seem to be a number of important ‘anomalies’ that economists are
unable to explain. These include: ‘excessive’ saving amongst the elderly; DEMO proliferation
of a large number of committed savings schemes with no obvious advantages; and the fact
that consumption seems to be ‘excessively’ sensitive to income. My own feeling is that
many of these anomalies are explicable DEMO the inability or unwillingness of people to
plan—and it is to explore this potential explanation that the present paper is devoted.
I represent a DEMO decision problem under risk in the following tree form—where
square boxes represent either chance nodes or choice nodes. In the ﬁgure that follows the
DEMO and third (set of ) nodes (reading from the left to the right) are choice nodes; and the
second and the fourth (set of ) nodes are chance nodes. The tree is particularly simple DEMO
that at each choice node there are just 2 choices and at each chance node there are just
2 possibilities. To make things simple DEMO assume that at all chance nodes each of the two
10 HEY
possibilities are equally likely—that is, there is a probability 1 that Nature moves Up and a
2
probability 1 that Nature moves DEMO The decision maker starts at the ﬁrst choice node at
2
the left of the tree and has to work his or her way DEMO the tree, ﬁnally arriving at one of
the terminal nodes, with each of which is associated a payoff. So the decision maker must
DEMO Up or Down at the ﬁrst choice node; then Nature moves, choosing Up or Down
with equal probability. Then the decision maker has DEMO make a second choice—to move Up
or Down at the second choice node. Then Nature makes a ﬁnal move—Up or Down with
equal probability. DEMO the decision maker gets the associated payoff.
What does economic theory say about the way that the decision maker should tackle this
problem? There are essentially three approaches, which can be called:
1. The strategy approach.
2. Backward induction with reduction.
3. Backward induction with certainty equivalents.
DEMO second and third of these are very similar—so I will describe just one of them. The ﬁrst
approach involves converting the problem from a DEMO choice problem into the choice
of a strategy. A strategy is a set of decisions as to what to do at each choice node DEMO one
might reach. One possible strategy is to choose Up at the ﬁrst choice node and then play
Down at the second if Nature DEMO Up and to play Up at the second if Nature moves
Down. This strategy leads to possible payoffs of 23, 23, 40 or DEMO with equal probability
1 . There are 8 possible strategies in total (which are (U;UU), (U;UD), (U;DU), (U;DD),
4
EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS AND THE THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
11
(D;UU), (D;UD), (D,DU); (D,DD) using an DEMO notation). With each of these there are
four possible equally likely payoffs and we get the following set of possible strategies.
Note that DEMO original dynamic problem has now been converted into a static problem. The
decision maker can now evaluate the various strategies using whatever static decision DEMO
he or she has. This could be Expected Utility or whatever. For a decision maker who is
risk-neutral the best strategy can be seen DEMO be (D;UU)—so a risk-neutral agent chooses
Down at the DEMO node and then Up at the second, irrespective of whatever Nature DEMO
The other two methods of solving the dynamic choice problem involve the use of back-
ward induction—either with reduction or with certainty equivalents. With DEMO induc-
tion with reduction the decision maker works backward through the tree, deciding what to
do at each of the ﬁnal choice nodes, DEMO the branches of the tree that he or she then
knows he or she will not follow, reducing the tree by the Reduction of Compound Lotteries
Axiom, and hence reducing it to a static choice problem, and thus solving the choice at
the ﬁrst node. If we once again take a risk-neutral agent, then it is clear from the above tree
that the optimal move at each of the four second choice DEMO is Up. If we eliminate the
Down at each second decision node we get the tree below. This is a static choice problem
and DEMO best decision for a risk-neutral person at the ﬁrst choice node is clearly Down.
So the risk-neutral agent chooses Down at the ﬁrst node DEMO then Up at the second node
(irrespective of what Nature moves)DEMO
12
HEY
I note that in this example, with a risk-neutral agent, we get the same decisions whichever
method we use the solve the dynamic choice problem. This will in fact always be the case
if DEMO static preferences of the decision maker are Expected Utility; if the DEMO are
not Expected Utility then different approaches to solving the dynamic choice problem may
lead to different decisions.
This latter is an interesting issue DEMO not the one that I want to explore. This latter is the
fact that each of the approaches described involves the use of a DEMO: the decision maker,
in choosing what to do at the DEMO choice node, anticipates what he or she will do at the
DEMO choice node. This idea—that people plan when tackling decision problems—is the
one that I want to examine in this paper.
I note that the DEMO people plan—is fundamental to the way economists think about
dynamic decision problems. It is almost equivalent to saying that people are rational: people,
in deciding what to do now, think of what they will do in the future. More fundamentally,
given that the payoffs in this DEMO are not received until the end of the tree is reached,
economists would ask how a decision could be taken unless some thought DEMO given to what
the decision maker will do in the future? DEMO the decision maker does not plan, how can he
or she DEMO make a decision? It is this that I want to examine DEMO this paper.
The basic point is thus this: the theories that DEMO use all assume that people plan;
how can we check ﬁrst whether this is true and secondly whether people actually implement
the plan DEMO they have made.10
There is a fundamental methodological problem in detecting whether people have a plan
and whether they implement it: in itself a plan is unobservable. At this point we could
get a little entangled DEMO semantics (“a plan is an intention, something that one plans or
intends to do”, which seems to suggest that it is not a plan in the sense of the theory) but I
would prefer not to do. I would prefer to continue using the word ‘plan’ in DEMO sense of the
EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS AND THE THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
13
theories that I DEMO described above: it is a statement of what the decision maker DEMO do. But
how do we observe it? More importantly, how do we provide appropriate incentives in an
experiment for a subject to honestly DEMO a plan—assuming, of course, that they have one.
And this ﬁnal point raises another methodological concern, which is crucial if we want
to see if people do have plans: if we use the word ‘plan’ in an experiment, if we ask subjects
what they are planning to do, then we raise in their minds the idea that they ought to have a
plan. Just mentioning the word ‘plan’ in the instructions DEMO well change their behaviour.
We do not want to change their behaviour; we just want to observe that behaviour.
What other people have suggested is that the way round the ﬁrst of the problems is to
DEMO subjects what they are planning to do—and then force them to do it. But this changes
the nature of the decision problem—you are effectively DEMO subjects to pre-commit and
hence use the strategy approach to solving the problem. This is a bit counter-productive if
you actually want to observe DEMO approach they are using. OK—it tells you how they
solve a strategy problem—but it does not tell you how they solve a dynamic choice DEMO
Other experimentalists are even more ingenious—they tell their subjects, when choosing
DEMO the ﬁrst node, that they have to pre-commit to a choice DEMO the second node, but when
it comes to the second choice DEMO they tell them that they can change their minds. This
seems objectionable on a number of grounds, not least that it involves deception (DEMO
strikes me as pretty serious) but also that it tells you DEMO about what you wanted to
know (“whether people make a plan DEMO then implement it”) but tells you what people do
if they DEMO forced to pre-commit but then are (unexpectedly—at least one hopes that DEMO is
unexpectedly unless your subject pool has been polluted by previous deception) allowed to
change their minds. This may be interesting—but it is not what we set out to do.
Other experimentalists are still more ingenious—they DEMO their subjects that they have
to precommit but that there is a chance11 that they will be allowed to change their minds.
The problem DEMO this is that it changes the decision tree that the subjects are tackling—it
introduces a further chance node in the tree. There is no DEMO that the solution to the
new tree has any relationship with the solution to the original tree. The same is true of a
device DEMO tried myself, in an experiment in which subjects were told, when they were taking
the decision at the ﬁrst choice node, that they had to state a decision at the second choice
node but that DEMO could change it—at a cost—when they came to take the second decision.12
All these methods seem to have difﬁculties. Instead I have been led DEMO thinking about
designing an experiment which reveals the plans or intentions that people have. Just as we
can get people to reveal their preferences, we might be able to get people to reveal their
intentions. The DEMO is this: that, in a two-stage decision problem, the decision DEMO the ﬁrst
node reveals what they intend to choose at the second node. This is not as easy as it appears.
One does not DEMO a problem so simple that everyone does the same thing: one DEMO some
people to choose Up at the ﬁrst node and some people to choose Down at the ﬁrst node. So
we do not want DEMO or Down to dominate13 at the ﬁrst node. Similarly we do not want Up
or Down to dominate at the second node.
Consider the DEMO design. I want to separate the subjects into two groups—the ﬁrst
group choosing Up at the ﬁrst node and the second group choosing Down DEMO the ﬁrst node.
We then want to be able to predict the behaviour of the subjects at the second choice node,
conditional on DEMO they did at the ﬁrst.
14 HEY
This is the way I implemented the idea. I build DEMO experiment around two basic
gambles14—A: [900, 50] and B: 400 DEMO sure. The prospect A is attractive to risk-lovers,
risk-neutral agents and those who are only moderately risk-averse. The prospect B is attrac-
tive DEMO those who are more than a little risk-averse. I do not know ex ante which prospect
any subject will prefer. I now construct further DEMO from these basic two:
A+ = [950, 100] B+ = DEMO
A− = [850, 0] B− = 350
Note how these are DEMO: A+ and B+ are both 50 better than A and B DEMO;
A− and B− are both 50 worse than A and B respectively. I make the following assumptions:
Assumption 1: A+ is preferred to B+ if and only if A is preferred to B if DEMO only if
A− is preferred to B−
Assumption 2: If C DEMO preferred to E and D is preferred to F then [C, DEMO is preferred to
[E, F]
Assumption 1 seems pretty harmless. Assumption DEMO is less harmless; it is implied by the
Independence Axiom or DEMO separability, but Independence or separability are not required
for it. However, both are assumptions, though it seems to me that some such assumptions
need to be made if we are going to implement this revealed DEMO approach. Consider
now the following tree. It is designed in such a way that if a subject chooses Up at the ﬁrst
choice node DEMO he or she should choose Up at the second; if a DEMO chooses Down at
the ﬁrst then he or she should choose Down at the second. That is, of course, if the subject
has DEMO plan and implements it.
EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS AND THE THEORY OF DECISION MAKING
15
Why do I DEMO this? I have a long proof (available in the Appendix), but the following
intuition may be better. Suppose an individual is more DEMO a little risk-averse and prefers B
to A. This subject should choose Down at the ﬁrst node and then play Down at the second.
DEMO? Because choosing Down at the ﬁrst will give him or her DEMO B or B+ for sure while
choosing Up at the ﬁrst gives him or her only B or B− for sure. Having chosen Down DEMO the
ﬁrst, then this individual will have a choice either between DEMO or B or a choice between A
and B+: the second DEMO these (Down) is always preferred to the ﬁrst.
Another intuitive proof is by showing that someone who choose Up at the ﬁrst node DEMO
then Down at the second is doing something a bit odd. Note that by choosing Down at the
second after choosing Up at the DEMO gives the subject either B or B−. But if the individual
wanted a certainty rather than a risk all along then he or she DEMO have got a better certainty
by choosing Down in the ﬁrst place and then Down again, hence getting either B or B+.
So ex post behaviour is a bit strange if it implies outcomes of either DEMO or B− instead of
outcomes of B or B+. A similar argument shows that choosing Down at the ﬁrst node and
then Up at DEMO second is also odd behaviour.
The bottom line of all this is that the ﬁrst move reveals the plan (or intention) of the
DEMO, assuming, of course, that the subject does indeed plan. Speciﬁcally, a choice of
Up at the ﬁrst node reveals the intention to DEMO Up at the second node, and a choice of
Down at DEMO ﬁrst node reveals the intention to choose Down at the second. For those subjects
who do indeed choose Up after Up or who choose DEMO after Down, their behaviour is
not inconsistent15 with the hypothesis that DEMO have a plan and implement it. For those
subjects who choose Up after choosing Down or who choose Down after choosing Up,
their DEMO is inconsistent with the hypothesis that they have a plan and implement it.
We now describe an implementation of this experiment.
4. An experimental DEMO of dynamic decision making under risk
The experiment described above was implemented on a subset of the CentER panel. This
panel, maintained by CentER at the University of Tilburg, is an ongoing family expenditure
panel of Dutch households which CentER has been monitoring for some years. CentER
has DEMO wealth of survey information on this panel, both of a demographic DEMO and of a
ﬁnancial nature. The great virtue of this panel is that panel members are equipped with a
computer connected to CentER. As DEMO consequence, questionnaires—and more importantly
experiments—can be down-loaded on to panel member’s DEMO
This is what happened with my experiment. On two weekends in April and May 2001
CentER sent out an invitation to participate in the DEMO Along with the invitation was
a full set of instructions which enabled potential participants to see what was required. There
was also a practice DEMO enabled potential participants to try out the experiment
as much as they wanted. Obviously if they did decide to participate they could do the
DEMO only once—and had to say in advance when they were ready to participate.
A total of 1029 subjects completed the experiment. They were visually DEMO with
the tree—almost as it appears in this paper.16 When they were ready to participate they
were asked to choose Up or Down at DEMO ﬁrst node. They were then asked to conﬁrm their
decision. Then the half of the tree that they had rejected went grey. For roughly DEMO the
16
HEY
subjects (Treatment 1) they were then told Nature’s move DEMO the ﬁrst chance node; for the
other half (Treatment 2) DEMO had to wait 24 hours before being informed of Nature’s move.
All the subjects had to wait 24 hours before making their choice at DEMO second choice node.
Nature then made its second move and the subjects were informed of their payoff. They
were then paid the payoff.
Note DEMO all subjects had to wait 24 hours between taking the ﬁrst decision and taking
the second. There were two reasons for this: the ﬁrst was simply to give them some time
to think—so they did not DEMO into the second decision; the second, and perhaps the most
important, was to separate in their minds the two decisions—so that they did not think of
them as one decision. If they had so thought DEMO they could be considered as having been
forced to think of a plan. I deliberately did not want them to be forced to plan DEMO decisions.
I have 1029 subjects. I have information on certain of their demographic and ﬁnancial
characteristics. In particular I have information on: their position in the household; their
sex 1 = male, 2 = female); their age (in years); their education (the higher the number the
higher the education); their activity (essentially whether they were working or not); the
number of members in the household; the number of children in the household; whether
they had a partner living with them; the gross income of the household; the net income of
DEMO household; the gross income of the subject; and the net income of the subject. There
are some clearly dubious responses to the income DEMO (so the ﬁgures that I present
should be treated with some DEMO), but most of the data seems accurate.
Of the 1029 subjects, 622 chose Up at the ﬁrst node and 407 chose Down. It may be of
interest to know the characteristics of these two groups. DEMO that the relatively risk-averse
subjects should choose Up at the ﬁrst node.
Decisions at Number of Net subject
ﬁrst node Sex Age Education children DEMO
Up 1.46 43.4 2.77 0.727 8033
Down 1.44 46.9 2.64 0.707 6354
Rather surprisingly sex seems not to affect the decision (usually women are more risk-
averse), though age does (the older choosing the safer option). Income seems to have some
effect, but these numbers should be treated with caution.
We now come to the key part. Of DEMO 622 subjects who chose Up at the ﬁrst node,
403 chose Up at the second while 219 chose Down. Recall that the theory DEMO that, of
those who chose Up at the ﬁrst choice node, all who plan should choose Up at the second.
In this experiment, 219 out of the 622 did not and were therefore inconsistent in DEMO
behaviour with the hypothesis that people have a plan and implement it. This is 35%—
which is hardly an insigniﬁcant proportion. Of the 407 DEMO who chose Down at the
ﬁrst node, 255 chose Down at DEMO second while 152 chose Up. Recall that the theory says
that, DEMO those who chose Down at the ﬁrst node, all who plan DEMO choose Down at the
second. In the experiment, 152 out of DEMO 407 did not and were therefore inconsistent in their
behaviour with the hypothesis that people have a plan and implement it. This is 37%—again
DEMO hardly insigniﬁcant proportion. Overall, 371 subjects out of 1029—36%—had behaviour

inconsistent with the DEMO that people have a plan and implement it. Of the remaining
64% it can be concluded that their behaviour was not inconsistent with the DEMO that
people have a plan and implement it. So in this experiment we can conclude that less than
64% of subjects seem to have DEMO plan and implement it.17
I must admit that I was surprised by this result. To me the experiment seems excessively
simple and the ‘correct’ DEMO so obvious that I had expected that virtually all the
subjects would have behaviour consistent with the hypothesis. This expectation had been
sharpened by DEMO pilot study that I had done on a sample of subjects from the Bari Summer
School in 1999—in which all 19 subjects had behaviour DEMO with the hypothesis. But
perhaps that was a bad sample—particularly as they had been lectured to on the subject of
consistent dynamic behaviour!
Given DEMO result I had then hoped to be able to ‘explain’ it by some of the demo-
graphic variables. I carried out a number of DEMO analyses to see if I could explain the
consistent/inconsistent decisions. I found nothing. Then I tried something simpler—I con-
structed the following table DEMO the average value of certain relevant variables for the
two groups. Variables were chosen according to whether they were of potential interest or
whether DEMO appeared to have some signiﬁcance. Variables not included here do not appear
to be signiﬁcant.
Consistent? Payoff Sex Age Education Number of children Net subject income
Yes 494 1.44 44.9 2.74 0.751 7506
No 400 1.48 DEMO 2.67 0.623 7134
The column headed ‘Payoff’ is not an explanatory variable—it is the average payoff of
the subjects—but it is interesting to note DEMO consistent subjects make more money than
inconsistent ones. I do not think that this is an inevitable implication, but it is interesting
nonetheless. The other variables are potential explanatory variables—but they do not seem
to explain DEMO much.
A more detailed analysis is provided in the next table, DEMO breaks down the consis-
tent/inconsistent subjects into those who chose Up and those who chose Down at the ﬁrst
choice node. One might DEMO, for example that those initially more risk loving might be
more DEMO to change their minds. It does not seem that this is the case. One thing that
does seem to emerge from this table is DEMO feeling that the payoff is higher for the more
risk-loving choices; DEMO seems a reasonable result. (I should once again caution against
reading DEMO much into the income ﬁgures.)

5. Conclusion
Some 36% of the 1029 subjects in this DEMO had behaviour inconsistent with the
hypothesis that people have a plan and implement it.18 This leaves some 64% of subjects
whose behaviour was not DEMO with this hypothesis; but it has to be admitted that
some DEMO these subjects too might not have been following a plan. There is of course the
point that we should acknowledge from all the experimental DEMO on static decision making
under risk—that some of the 36% whose behaviour was inconsistent with the hypothesis
may simply have made a mistake. However DEMO seems much higher than is usually the
case—ﬁgures of around 10% to 25% seem more reasonable—though we might expect
a ﬁgure somewhat higher than DEMO static experiments, given that the nature of the task is
more DEMO However, we should, of course, also apply the error story DEMO the 64%
of subjects whose behaviour was not inconsistent with the theory—they might have done
the ‘right thing’ by mistake. So the bottom line DEMO to be that a signiﬁcant number of
subjects in this experiment had behaviour inconsistent with the hypothesis that they had a
plan and implemented DEMO
This conclusion seems to be supported by other experimental evidence. An experiment
which tried to discover what people were actually doing in dynamic decision DEMO,
reported in Carbone and Hey [2001], suggests that subjects typically DEMO explore the future
possibilities when taking their earlier decisions, but they DEMO so in such a way that ignores
what decisions they will be taking in the future. Subjects seem unable to predict their own
future DEMO The experiment reported in this paper seems to conﬁrm this interesting
ﬁnding.
Appendix
Sketch of proof of dynamic consistency requirement.
I consider only the DEMO when the subject prefers A to B. A similar argument applies in the
contrary case. I maintain throughout Assumptions 1 and 2.
I do DEMO proof two ways. I start with backward induction.
In the decision tree there are 6 ﬁnal gambles and the optimal strategy is determined by
DEMO ordering of these 6 gambles. The assumptions I have made above are not sufﬁcient to
determine the ordering completely and there are in fact DEMO cases that we should consider.
Case 1. (If preference ordering is DEMO B+ AA− BB−): If U is played at ﬁrst node then
best at second are UU; if D is played at ﬁrst node then best at second are UD; this implies
a choice between [A+,A] (if U played at ﬁrst node) and [A−,B+] (if D played at ﬁrst
node). Hence U is best at ﬁrst DEMO UU at second.
Case 2. (If preference ordering is A+ B+ DEMO B−): If U is played at ﬁrst node then
best at second are UU; if D is played at ﬁrst node then best at second are DD; this implies
a choice between [A+,A] (DEMO U played at ﬁrst node) and [B,B+] (if D played at ﬁrst
node). Hence U is best at ﬁrst and UU DEMO second.

Case 3. (If preference ordering is A+ AB+ A− BB−): If U is played DEMO ﬁrst node then
best at second are UU; if D is DEMO at ﬁrst node then best at second are UU; this implies
DEMO choice between [A+,A] (if U played at ﬁrst node) and [A−,A] (if D played at ﬁrst
node). Hence U is best at ﬁrst and UU at second.
Case 4. (If preference ordering is A+ AB+ BA− B−): If U is played at ﬁrst DEMO then
best at second are UU; if D is played at DEMO node then best at second are DU; this implies
a choice DEMO [A+,A] (if U played at ﬁrst node) and [B,A] (if D played at ﬁrst node).
Hence U is best at ﬁrst and UU at second.
Case 5. (If preference ordering is A+ AA− B+ BB−): If U is played at ﬁrst node then
DEMO at second are UU; if D is played at ﬁrst node DEMO best at second are UU; this implies
a choice between [A+,DEMO (if U played at ﬁrst node) and [A−,A] (if DEMO played at ﬁrst
node). Hence U is best at ﬁrst and UU at second.
I now do the proof using strategies:
There DEMO eight possible strategies with each of which are associated two equally likely ﬁnal
prospects. These are as follows:
(U; UU)
(U; UD)
(U; DU)
(U; DD)
(D; UU)
(D; UD)
(D; DU)
(D; DEMO)
[A+,A]
[A+,B−]
[B, A]
[B, B−]
[A−,A]
[A−,B+]
[B, A]
[B, B+]
It is clear that if DEMO is preferred to B and if my assumption holds then U; DEMO is the best
strategy:
[A+,A] is preferred to [A+,B−] through Assumptions 1 and 2
[A+,A] is preferred to [B, A] through Assumptions 1 and 2
[A+,A] is preferred to [B, B−] through Assumptions 1 and 2
[A+,A] dominates [A−,A]
[A+,A] DEMO preferred to [A−,B+] through Assumptions 1 and 2
[A+,A] is preferred to [B, A] through Assumptions 1 and 2
[A+,A] is preferred to [B, B+] through Assumptions 1 and 2

HEY
This paper originates in a paper given as the 2001 DEMO Economics Lecture at the
28th Seminar of the European Group of Risk and Insurance Economics in Strasbourg
in September 2001. I would like to DEMO the Geneva Association and particularly Christian
Gollier, for the invitation to DEMO this lecture. I would also like to thank my discussant
Marc Willinger who provided interesting new insight into the assumptions that I was im-
DEMO adopting. His comments forced me to explicitly strengthen the assumptions and
hence explicitly weaken the conclusions. Moreover his comments conﬁrmed my suspicions
that some DEMO are necessary to implement the approach advocated in this paper,
and that the assumptions necessary are by no means vacuous.
Notes
1. I DEMO not want to get bogged down in difﬁcult deﬁnitions at this stage. I hope it sufﬁces that what I mean by
risk is a DEMO in which probabilities are taken as given by everyone, whereas in DEMO situation of uncertainty
there is no general agreement about what the probabilities are or even whether they exist.
2. A rather dated survey can DEMO found in Hey [1997].
3. Where by the notation [A, B; p] I denote a risky prospect which yields A with probability p DEMO B with
probability (1− p). In the case of a DEMO gamble between A and B I shall use the abbreviated notation [A, B].
4. The “appropriate incentive mechanism” is one that ensures that choice and preference coincide.
5. This mechanism works if the subject considers each DEMO independently of the other. If he or she does not
then the ‘Holt objection’ comes into force. I shall ignore this objection, since taking it into account complicates
the exposition without changing the force of the DEMO
6. Some early experimental tests used different subjects for the two Problems, but this practice is now very rarely
followed.
7. In itself this really is not a paradox as the subject could be indifferent, but different formulations and exper-
imental tests seem to show that there is DEMO a strong strict preference for the risky urn.
8. I do not want to enter into a debate here on the ethics or otherwise DEMO deception as an experimental tool.
Sufﬁce it to say that I do not approve of the use of deception. Some of my views are DEMO in Hey [1998].
9. Theories which necessarily drop the Reduction of Compound Lotteries Axiom, for otherwise the ‘probabilities
of probabilities’ would reduce back to ‘probability’ through the use of this Axiom.
10. Obviously in the theories DEMO implement the plan that they have made: if they knew that DEMO would not
implement them then they would form a different plan and perhaps come to different decisions.
11. Some stochastic device will be invoked DEMO before the second choice node to determine whether they can
change their minds or not.
12. As it happened, only one subject (out DEMO some 175) changed his or her mind!
13. In the sense DEMO ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance—so that one choice is better for everyone irrespective of their
preference function.
14. Recall the notation: [A, B] indicates a DEMO gamble between A and B.
15. Note, of course, that this does not prove that they have a plan and implement it.
16. DEMO experiment can be visited at http://cdata4.kub.nl/experiment, but note DEMO this is not in the ﬁnal form in
which it was actually implemented.
17. There is an alternative interpretation. This is one pointed out DEMO my discussant Marc Willinger—and I thank
him for it. It could be argued, for example, that those subjects who played D at the DEMO node and then U at
the second if Nature plays U and D at the second if Nature plays D are those subjects who DEMO prefer the
strategy [D; UD] to the strategy [U; UU] even though they prefer A to B. Why might this be so? If they have
preferences for which A is preferred to B yet [A−,DEMO is preferred to [A+,A]. Such preferences are ruled
out by Assumptions 1 and 2. But these Assumptions are by no means vacuous. For DEMO non-Expected Utility
maximiser to prefer [900, 50] to 400 for sure DEMO yet prefer the four-ways-equally-likely prospect [850, 0,
450, 450] to the four-ways-equally-likely prospect [950, 100, 900, 50] is possible—though unlikely.
18. Under, of course, Assumptions 1 and 2. The conclusions that follow DEMO be qualiﬁed by the remarks made
in note 17 above.
